Math Word Problems For Dummies 
xx

Introduction
M
ath word problems (or story problems, depending on where and when
you went to school). What topic has caused more hair to be pulled
from tender heads, more tears and anguish, and, at the same time, more feel-
ing of satisfaction and accomplishment? When I told friends that I was writing
this book, their responses were varied, but none was mild or without a strong
opinion one way or the other. Oh, the stories (pardon the pun) I heard. And,
lucky you, I’ve taken some of the accounts and incorporated the better stories
in this book. Everyone has his favorite word problem, most of them starting
with, “If Jim is twice as old as Ted was. . . .”
I was never crazy about math word problems until I got to teach them. It’s all
a matter of perspective. I’ve taken years (and years and years) of experience
of trying to convey the beauty and structure of math word problems to others
and put the best of my efforts in this book. I hope that you enjoy the problems
and explanations as much as I’ve enjoyed writing them.
About This Book
Math word problems are really a part of life. Pretty much everything is a word
problem until you change it into an arithmetic problem or algebra problem or
logic problem and then solve it. In this book, you first find the basic steps or
processes that you use to solve any math word problem. I list the steps, illus-
trated by examples, and then later incorporate those steps into the different
types of word problems throughout the rest of the book. The same basic tech-
niques and processes work whether you’re doing a third-grade arithmetic
problem or a college geometry problem.
You’ll see that I use the processes and steps over and over in the examples —
reinforcing the importance of using such steps. Because the steps are carried
throughout, you can start anywhere you want in this book and be able to either
backtrack or jump forward and still find a familiar friend in a similar step.
The different types of word problems are divided into categories, in case
you’re only looking for help with age problems or in case you’re only inter-
ested in interest problems. Most of the examples have a firm basis in reality,
but a few are off the wall, just because you need to have a good sense of
humor when dealing with math word problems.

Conventions Used in This Book
For the most part, when I use a specific math word or expression, I define it
right then and there. For example, if you read a math word problem about a
regular hexagon, you immediately find the definition of regular (all sides and
all angles are the same measure), so you don’t have to hunt around to under-
stand what’s being asked.
You’ll find lots of cross-referencing in the chapters. If a problem requires the
use of the quadratic formula, I send you to the chapter or section where I
introduce that formula. Each section and each chapter stands by itself — you
don’t really need to go through the chapters sequentially. You’re more than
welcome to go back and forth as much as you want. This isn’t a murder mys-
tery where the whole plot will be exposed if you go to the end first. When
reading this book, do it your way!
What You’re Not to Read
Math can get pretty technical — whether you want it to or not. So you’ll find
this book to be pretty self-contained. All you need to get you through the
technical formulas and complicated algebraic manipulations is found right
here in this book. You won’t need a table of values or computer manual to
understand what I present here.
You’ll find the material in this book peppered with sidebars. What are side-
bars? They’re the text you see in gray boxes throughout the book. Most of
the sidebars in this book are brainteasers. You have your mental juices flow-
ing as you’re reading this book, so you’re probably in the mood to tackle a
little twist of logic or a sassy question. The answers to the brainteasers
follow immediately, so you won’t have to wait or be frustrated at not having
the answer. And if you’re not in the mood to have your brain teased, just skip
on over them. (In fact, you can skip any sidebar, whether it’s a brainteaser
or not.)
Foolish Assumptions
The math word problems in this book span some basic problems (using arith-
metic) to the more complex (requiring algebraic skills). Even though I like to
make example problems come out with whole-number answers, sometimes
2
Math Word Problems For Dummies 

fractions or decimals are just unavoidable. So I’m assuming that you know
your way around adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing fractions and
that you can reduce fractions to the lowest terms.
Another assumption I make is that you have access to a calculator. A scien-
tific calculator works best, because you can raise numbers to powers and
take roots. But you can always make do with a nonscientific calculator.
Graphing calculators are a bit of overkill, but they come in handy for making
tables and programming different processes.
For the math word problems requiring algebra, all you need to know is how
to solve some basic linear equations, such as solving for x in 4x + 7 = 9. For
the problems ending up with the need to solve a quadratic equation, you may
want to review factoring techniques and the quadratic formula. Algebra For
Dummies, written by yours truly (and published by Wiley) is a great reference
for many of the basic algebraic skills. Other great sources for math review
are Everyday Math For Dummies, by Charles Seiter (Wiley), and Basic Math &
Pre-Algebra For Dummies, by Mark T. Zegarelli (Wiley).
If you’re reading this book, I’m making the not-so-foolish assumption that you
know your way around basic arithmetic and algebra. With the rest, I’m here
to help you!
How This Book Is Organized
This book is broken into five different parts, each with a common thread or
theme. You can start anywhere — you don’t have to go from Part I to Part II,
and so on. But the logical arrangement of topics helps you find your way
through the material.
Part I: Lining Up the Basic Strategies
The four chapters in this part contain general plans of attack — how you
approach a word problem and what you do with all those words. I introduce
the basic vocabulary of math in word problems, and I outline the steps you
use for solving any kind of word problem. You see how to work your way
through the various units: linear, area, volume, rate. And finally, I use a grand
example of handling a math word problem to demonstrate the various tech-
niques you use to solve the rest of the problems in the book.

Introduction

Part II: Taking Charge of the Math
The main emphasis of the chapters in this part is on using the correct opera-
tions and formulas. You get to use probability and proportions, money and
mixtures, formulas and figuring. One of the first hurdles to overcome when
doing math word problems is choosing the correct process, operation, or
rule. Money plays a big part in these chapters — as it plays a big part in most
people’s lives.
Part III: Tackling Word Problems
from Algebra
These chapters and problems may be the ones that you’ve really been looking
forward to all along. Here you see how to take foreign-sounding, confounding,
baffling, challenging word combinations and change them into mathematical
problems that you can perform. Or, on the other hand, maybe these chapters
present a new experience for you — math word problems that aren’t based on
simple, practical applications. Enjoy this journey into the word problems that
so many people remember with such delight (or a shudder).
Part IV: Taking the Shape of Geometric
Word Problems
The problems in this part are solid or geometric in nature. Most people are
very visual, too, finding that a picture clears up the confusing and gives direc-
tion to the perplexing. The geometric word problems in this section almost
always have a rule or formula attached. You’ll use perimeter, area, and
volume formulas, and you’ll find Pythagoras very useful when approaching
these problems.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The chapters in this part are short, sweet, and to the point. The first chapter
contains classic brainteasers and their solutions. The second chapter con-
tains very brief descriptions of mathematicians — or pseudo-mathematicians.
You’ll find a president and world conqueror among the ten listed.

In this part . . .
You ﬁnd how to deal with problems that include words
such as sum, twice, ratio, and difference. Throw in
units such as inches and quarts and rates such as miles per
hour. If you mix it all up in a mathematical container, such
as a box, you have the ingredients for a math word prob-
lem. You ﬁnd the basic strategies and procedures for
doing word problems. The methods I present in this part
follow you throughout the entire book.

M
athematicians decided long ago to conserve on words and explana-
tions and replace them with symbols and single letters. The only prob-
lem is that a completely different language was created, and you need to
know how to translate from the cryptic language of symbols into the lan-
guage of words. The operations have designations such as +, –, ×, and ÷.
Algebraic equations use letters and arrangements of those letters and num-
bers to express relationships between different symbols.
In this chapter, you get a refresher of the math speak you’ve seen in the past.
I review the vocabulary of algebra and geometry and give examples using the
appropriate symbols and operations.
Latching onto the Lingo
Words used in mathematics are very precise. The words have the same mean-
ing no matter who’s doing the reading of a problem or when it’s being
done. These precise designations may seem restrictive, but being strict is
necessary — you want to be able to count on a mathematical equation or
expression meaning the same thing each time you use it.

For example, in mathematics, the word rational refers to a type of number or
function. A person is rational if he acts in a controlled, logical way. A number
is rational if it acts in a controlled, structured way. If you use the word ra-
tional to describe a number, and if the person you’re talking to also knows
what a rational number is, then you don’t have to go into a long, drawn-out
explanation about what you mean. You’re both talking in the same language,
so to speak.
Defining types of numbers
Numbers are classified by their characteristics. One number can have more
than one classification. For example, the number 2 is a whole number, an
even number, and a prime number. Knowing which numbers belong in which
classification will help you when you’re trying to solve problems in which the
answer has to be of a certain type of number.
Naming numbers
Numbers have names that you speak. For example, when you write down a
phone number that someone is reciting, you hear two, one, six, nine, three,
two, seven, and you write down 216-9327. Some other names associated with
numbers refer to how the numbers are classified.
 Natural (counting): The numbers starting with 1 and going up by ones
forever: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . .
 Whole: The numbers starting with 0 and going up by ones forever.
Whole numbers are different from the natural numbers by just the
number 0: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .
 Integer: The positive and negative whole numbers and 0: . . . ,–3, –2, –1,
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .
 Rational: Numbers that can be written as q
p where both p and q are 
integers, but q is never 0:

 Odd: Numbers not evenly divisible by 2: . . . ,–3, –1, 1, 3, 5, 7, . . .
 Prime Numbers divisible evenly only by 1 and themselves: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,
13, 17, 19, 23, 29, . . .
 Composite: Numbers that are not prime; numbers that are evenly divisi-
ble by some number other than just 1 and themselves: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12,
14, 15, . . .
10
Part I: Lining Up the Basic Strategies 

Relating numbers
Numbers of the same or even different classifications are often related in
another way that makes them usable in problems. For example, if you want
only multiples of five, you draw from evens, odds, and integers — several
types to create a new relationship.
 Consecutive: A listing of numbers, in order, from smallest to largest, that
have the same difference between them: 22, 33, 44, 55, . . . are consecu-
tive multiples of 11 starting with 22.
 Multiples: Numbers that all have a common multiplier: 21, 28, and 63 are
multiples of 7.
Gauging the geometric
Geometric figures appear frequently in mathematical applications — and in
life. Geometric figures have names, classifications, and characteristics. The
figures are also measured in two or more ways. Flat figures have the lengths
of their sides, their whole perimeter, or their area measured. Solid figures
have their surface area and volume measured. You can find all the formulas
you need on the Cheat Sheet and in Chapters 18, 19, and 20. What you find
here is a description of what the measures mean.
Plying perimeter
The perimeter is a linear measure: inches, feet, centimeters, miles, kilometers,
and so on. Perimeter is a measure of distance — the distance around the out-
side of a flat figure. The perimeter of a figure made up of line segments is
equal to the sum of the length of all the segments. The perimeter of a circle is
also called its circumference and is always slightly more than three times the
circle’s diameter. In Figure 1-1, you see several sketches and their respective
perimeters.
P = 3 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 16"
P = 8 + 9 + 4 + 2 + 3 = 26 mi.

Chapter 1: Getting Comfortable with Math Speak

Assembling the area
The area of a figure is a two-dimensional measure. The area is a measure of
how many squares you can fit into the figure. If the figure doesn’t have 90-
degree or squared-off angles, then you have to count up pieces of squares —
break them up and put them back together — to get the whole area. Think
about putting square tiles in a room — you have to cut some of them to go
around cabinets or fit along a wall. The formulas that you use to compute
areas help you with the piecing-together of squares.
In Figure 1-2, you see a triangle with an area of exactly 12 square units. See if
you can figure out how the pieces go together to form a total of 12 squares.
If that doesn’t work, you can compute the area by just looking up the formula
for the area of a triangle.
Coming to the surface with surface area
The surface area of a solid figure is the sum of the areas of all the sides. A four-
sided figure has a triangle on each side, so you add up the areas of each of the
triangles to get the total surface area. How do you get the area of each triangle?
You go back to the formula for finding the area of triangles of that particular
size — or just count how many squares! Figure 1-3 shows three of the six sides
of a right rectangular prism and how each side has its area determined by all
the squares it can fit on that side.

Figure 1-2:

12
Part I: Lining Up the Basic Strategies 

The prism in Figure 1-3 has a surface area of 112 square units. That’s how
many squares cover the six surfaces of this solid figure. Formulas are much
easier to use than actually trying to count squares.
Vanquishing volume
The volume of a solid figure is a three-dimensional type of unit. When you
compute the volume of something, you’re determining how many cubes (like
sugar cubes or dice) will fit inside the figure. When the sides slant, of course,
you have to slice, trim, and fit to make all the cubes go inside — or you can
use a handy-dandy formula. Figure 1-4 shows how you can set cubes next to
one another and then stack them to determine the volume of a solid.
Formulating financials
Most people are interested in money, in one way or another. Money is the
way people keep count of whether they can trade for what they want or need.
Financial formulas aid with the computation of money-type situations.
The financial formulas here are divided into two different types: interest for-
mulas and revenue formulas. The interest formulas both involve a percentage
that needs to be changed into a decimal before being inserted into the for-
mula. To change a percent into a decimal, you move the decimal point two
places to the left. So 3.4 percent becomes 0.034 and 67 percent becomes 0.67.
The interest formulas are of two types: simple interest and compound interest.
The simple-interest formula is I = Prt. The I indicates how much interest your
money has earned — or how much interest you owe. The P is the principal —
how much money you invested or are borrowing. The r represents the interest
rate — the percentage that gets changed to a decimal. And the t stands for
time, which is usually a number of years.
Figure 1-4:
Cubes all in
a row.
13
Chapter 1: Getting Comfortable with Math Speak

Compounding interest means that you split up the rate of interest into a des-
ignated number of subintervals (every three months, twice a year, daily, and
so on), figure the interest earned during that subinterval, add the interest to
the principal, and then figure the next interval’s interest on the sum of the
original principal plus the interest you’ve added. As you may expect, you’ll
have more money in the end if you deposit it where you can earn compound
interest rather than just a flat amount. The formula for compound interest 
is A
P
nr
1
nt
=
+
c
m . The A represents the total amount of money — all the 
principal plus the interest earned. The r and t are the same as in simple inter-
est. The n represents the number of times each year that the interest is com-
pounded. Most banks compound quarterly, so the value of n is 4 in those cases.
Interpreting the Operations
What would mathematics be without its operations? The basic operations are
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You then add raising to
powers and finding roots. Many more operations exist, but these six basic
operations are the ones you’ll find in this book. Also listed here are some of
the special names for multiplying by two or three.
Naming the results
Each operation has a result, and just naming that result is sometimes more
convenient than going into a big explanation as to what you want done. You
can economize with words, space, time, and ink. The following are results of
operations most commonly used.
 Sum: The result of adding
 Difference: The result of subtracting

“Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya, tomorrow . . .”
If yesterday had been Wednesday’s tomorrow,
and if tomorrow is Sunday’s yesterday, then
what day is it today?
Answer: It’s Friday.

 Product: The result of multiplying
 Twice or double: The result of multiplying by two
 Thrice or triple: The result of multiplying by three
 Quotient: The result of dividing
 Half: The result of dividing by two
Assigning the variables
A variable is something that changes. In mathematics, a variable is repre-
sented by a letter — usually one from the end of the alphabet — and it always
represents a number (usually an unknown number). For example, if you’re
doing a problem involving Jake and Jim and their ages, you can let x represent
Jake’s age, but you can’t let x represent Jake.
As you work on a problem, it’s a good idea to make a notation as to what
you’re letting the variable or variables represent, so you don’t forget or get
confused when constructing an equation to solve the problem.
Aligning symbols and word forms
One of the things that people see as a challenge in word problems is that
they’re full of words! After you’ve changed the words to symbols and equations,
it’s smooth sailing. But you have to get from there to here. Table 1-1 lists some
typical translations of words into symbols and an example of their use.

Drawing a Picture
One of the most powerful tools you can use when working on word problems
is drawing a picture. Most people are very visual — they understand relation-
ships between things when they write something down and/or draw a picture
illustrating the situation.
Visualizing relationships
The words in a math problem suggest how different parts of the situation are
connected — or not connected. Drawing a picture helps to make the connec-
tions and, often, suggests how to proceed with a solution.
For example, consider a word problem starting out with: “A plane is flying
east at 600 mph while another plane is flying north at 500 mph. . . .” You need
more information than this to determine what the question and answer are,
but a picture suggests what process to use. Look at Figure 1-5, where two
possible scenarios for the statement are illustrated.

500
600

Figure 1-5:
The

one another.
16
Part I: Lining Up the Basic Strategies 

The precise relationship between the planes has to be given, but both sketches
suggest that a triangle can be formed by connecting the ends of the arrows.
Right triangles suggest the Pythagorean theorem, and other triangles come
with their respective perimeter and area formulas. In any case, the picture
solidifies the situation and makes interpretations possible.
Another example where a picture is helpful involves a situation where you’re
cutting a piece of paper. The word problem starts out with: “A rectangular
piece of paper has equal squares cut out of its corners. . . .” You draw a rec-
tangle, and you show what it looks like to remove squares that are all the
same size. Figure 1-6 illustrates one interpretation.
With the figure in view, you see that the lengths of the outer edges are
reduced by two times some unknown amount. The picture helps you write
expressions about the relationships between the original piece of paper and
the cut-up one.
Labeling accurately
Pictures are great for clarifying the words in a problem, but equally important
are the labels that you put on the picture. By labeling the different parts — 
especially with their units in feet, miles per hour, and so on — you improve
your chances of writing an expression or equation that represents the situation.
You’re told “A trapezoidal piece of land has 300 feet between the two parallel
sides, and the other two sides are 400 feet and 500 feet in length, while the
two parallel bases are 600 feet and 1,200 feet.” This statement has five differ-
ent numbers in it, and you need to sort them out. Figure 1-7 shows how the
different measures sort out from the statement.

Chapter 1: Getting Comfortable with Math Speak

Constructing a Table or Chart
A really nice way to determine what’s going on with a word problem is to
make a list of different possibilities and see what fits in the list or what pat-
tern forms. Patterns often suggest a formula or equation; the values in the
listing sometimes even provide the exact answer. Just as with pictures,
making a chart is a way of visualizing what’s going on.
Finding the values
When creating a table or chart, designate a variable to represent a part of the
problem, and see what the results are as you systematically change that vari-
able. For example, if you’re trying to find two numbers the product of which
is 60 and the sum of which is as small as possible, let the first number be x.
Then the other number is x60. Add the two numbers together to see what you 
get. Table 1-2 shows the different values for the two numbers and the sum —
if you stick to whole numbers.

Watch out for the black cat
A completely black cat was ambling down the
street during a total blackout — electricity was
down throughout the entire town. Not a single
streetlight had been on for hours. Just as the cat
was crossing the middle of the street, a Jeep
with two broken headlights came racing toward
where the cat was. Just as the Jeep got to
where the cat was crossing, it swerved out of
the way to avoid hitting the cat. How could the
driver of the Jeep have seen the cat in time to
swerve and avoid hitting it?
Answer: This happened in the middle of the day. It didn’t matter that no street
lights were on — everyone could see just fine.

I stop here, because I’m just going to get the same pairs of numbers in the
opposite order. If the rule is that the numbers can’t be fractions, then the two
numbers with a product of 60 and with the smallest possible sum are 6 and 10.
Increasing in steps
When making a table or chart, you want to be as systematic as possible so
you don’t miss anything – especially if that anything is the correct answer.
After you’ve determined a variable to represent a quantity in the problem,
you need to go up in logical steps — by ones or twos or halves or whatever is
appropriate. In Table 1-2, in the preceding section, you can see that I went up
in steps of 1 until I got to the 6. One more than 6 is 7, but 7 doesn’t divide into
60 evenly, so I skipped it. Even though the work isn’t shown here, I mentally
tried 7, 8, and 9 and discarded them, because they didn’t work in the prob-
lem. When you’re working with more complicated situations, you don’t want
to skip any steps — show them all.

Planning Your Attack 
on a Word Problem

G
etting ready to solve a math word problem involves more than sharp-
ening your pencil, aligning your sheets of paper, and taking a deep
breath. Math word problems have the reputation of being obscure, difficult,
confusing — you name it. The only way to overcome this bad rep is to be
ready, able, and willing to take them on. Start with the right attitude and
preparation so that you can approach math word problems in a confident,
organized fashion.
In this chapter, I review the importance of isolating the question, determining
just what information is needed, and ignoring the fluff. Math word problems
often contain information that makes the wording of the problem more inter-
esting but adds nothing to what’s needed for the solution. Also in this chap-
ter, you see the importance of doing a reality check — does the answer really
make sense? Is it what you expected? If not, why not?
Singling Out the Question
A math word problem is full of words — big surprise! Word problems really
represent the real world. When you have a problem to solve at the office
involving ordering new file cabinets, you don’t sit down to write out your
times tables, and you aren’t handed a piece of paper with an algebra problem
asking you to solve 2x + 3 = 27. To be successful with a word problem, you

have to translate from words to symbols, formulate the equation or problem
needed, and then perform the operations and arithmetic correctly to find
the answer.
Wading through the swamp of information
One of my favorite sayings is: “When you’re knee deep in alligators, it’s hard
to remember that your mission is to drain the swamp.” This certainly applies
to math word problems and sorting out what the question is from all the
other stuff. Consider the following problem. See if you can find the question
in all the verbiage.
The Problem: The 17 office workers and 4 managers at Super Mart all need
new file cabinets before the end of this month, which has 31 days. The file
cabinets cost $300 each, and the supplier of file cabinets will haul away the
old cabinets for $5 each. How much will it cost to replace the file cabinets if
each of the office workers takes his old file cabinet home and each of the
managers elects to have them hauled away?
There’s a lot of information in this problem, but you need to first look for the
question — what is it that you want to find? Look for what, how many, how
much, when, find, or other questioning or seeking words. Ignore the rest for
now until you determine what you’re looking for. Is it a number of file cabi-
nets? Is it an amount of money? Is it a number of people? Get your question
nailed down, and then worry about how to put it all together. In this problem,
the question is basically: “How much money?”
If you can’t stand to let a problem go unanswered and you want to solve this
one, the answer is $6,320. You figure out how much money it costs by deter-
mining how much was spent on each office worker and then adding the total
to how much the managers spent. Each of the 17 office workers spent just
$300 (just the cost of the cabinets), so 17 × $300 = $5,100. The managers had
their file cabinets hauled away, which added $5 on to the cost. The total for
each manager is $305, so 4 × $305 = $1,220. Add the amounts together, and
the cost of the file cabinets for the entire office is $5,100 + $1,220 = $6,320.

5 chickens. If he decides to call the pigs cows,
how many cows does he have?
Answer: The farmer has 10 cows. He can call the pigs whatever he wants,
but they’re still pigs.

Going to the end
In 95 percent of all math word problems, the question is at the end of the
description. No, I didn’t do a scientific survey. This is just my best guess
based on years of experience and reading way too many problems. Just trust
me. Most of the questions in word problems are at the end. That’s just the
way word problems are most efficiently constructed.
Reading the last sentence first isn’t a bad idea. When you find the question that
you need to answer, you can go back and wade through all the information and
sort out what’s needed to find the answer. The following questions are exam-
ples of how word problems are constructed and how the question seems to
come more naturally at the end.
The Problem: In a particular parking garage, you have spaces for regular-size
cars, compact cars, and large vans. The regular-size cars can park in the spaces
designed for a van, and the compact cars can fit in the spaces designed for
either a regular-size car or a van. If there are 200 spaces for regular-size cars,
40 spaces for compacts, and 30 spaces for vans, how many regular-sized cars
can park in the garage if vans are not allowed on a particular day?
The Problem: A magazine salesman gets a 5 percent commission on all one-
year subscriptions, a 10 percent commission on all two-year subscriptions, a
20 percent commission on all three-year subscriptions, and a flat fee of $5 for
every subscription he sells in excess of 100 subscriptions in any one week.
On Monday, he sold 14 one-year subscriptions, 23 two-year subscriptions,
and 6 three-year subscriptions. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, he
sold 12 of each type of subscription. On Friday, he sold 60 two-year subscrip-
tions. One-year subscriptions cost $20, two-year subscriptions cost $35, and
three-year subscriptions cost $52. On which day did he earn the most?
The Problem: If Tom is twice as old as Dick was ten years ago, and if the sum
of their ages five years ago was 90, then how old is Tom now?
You want the answers to these questions? Okay, you’ll get them, but you’ll
have to read on in this chapter where I cover eliminating the unwanted and
doing the operations in order.
Organizing the Facts, Ma’am, 
Just the Facts
Some writers of word problems seem to need to wax poetic — they go on and
on with unnecessary facts just to make the problem seem more interesting.
You know that it isn’t necessary to make these more interesting — they’re
fascinating enough already, right? Okay, don’t answer that.

Chapter 2: Planning Your Attack on a Word Problem

Eliminating the unneeded
After you’ve isolated the question, you go back to the problem to sort out
the needed information from the extra fluff. Look at the three problems from
the previous section again. I’ve drawn lines through the interesting-but-
unnecessary.
The Problem: In a particular parking garage, you have spaces for regular-size
cars, compact cars, and large vans. The regular-size cars can park in the spaces
designed for a van, and compact cars can fit in the spaces designed for either a
regular-size car or a van. If there are 200 spaces for regular-size cars, 40 spaces
for compacts and 30 spaces for vans, how many regular-size cars can park in
the garage if vans are not allowed on a particular day?
The Problem: A magazine salesman gets a 5 percent commission on all one-
year subscriptions, a 10 percent commission on all two-year subscriptions, a
20 percent commission on all three-year subscriptions, and a flat fee of $5 for
every subscription he sells in excess of 100 subscriptions in any one week.
On Monday, he sold 14 one-year subscriptions, 23 two-year subscriptions,
and 6 three-year subscriptions. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, he
sold 12 of each type of subscription. On Friday, he sold 60 two year subscrip-
tions. One-year subscriptions cost $20, two-year subscriptions cost $35, and
three-year subscriptions cost $52. On which day did he earn the most?
The Problem: If Tom is twice as old as Dick was ten years ago, and if the sum
of their ages five years ago was 90, then how old is Tom now?
You see that quite a bit is eliminated in the first problem, just a bit is elimi-
nated in the second problem, and nothing is eliminated in the third problem.
The information that’s been eliminated may be useful to answer some other
question, but it isn’t needed for the question at hand.
Doing the chores in order
You’ve isolated the question and eliminated the riff-raff. Now it’s time to set
up the arithmetic problems or equations needed to solve the problems. The
order in which you perform the operations is pretty much dictated by what
the question is. The last operation performed is what gives you the final
answer. I’ll take the problems one at a time.
The Problem: In a particular parking garage, you have spaces for regular-size
cars, compact cars, and large vans. The regular-size cars can park in the
spaces designed for a van, and compact cars can fit in the space designed for
either a regular-size car or a van. If there are 200 spaces for regular-size cars,
24
Part I: Lining Up the Basic Strategies 

40 spaces for compacts and 30 spaces for vans, how many regular-sized cars
can park in the garage if vans are not allowed on a particular day?
To solve this problem, you need to answer the question how many, which is a
total of two types of parking spaces. The total is the sum of 200 spaces plus
30 spaces, which is 200 + 30 = 230 spaces. For more problems of this type,
turn to Chapter 5.
The Problem: A magazine salesman gets a 5 percent commission on all one-
year subscriptions, 10 percent commission on all two-year subscriptions, a
20 percent commission on all three-year subscriptions, and a flat fee of $5 for
every subscription he sells in excess of 100 subscriptions in any one week.
On Monday he sold 14 one-year subscriptions, 23 two-year subscriptions, and
6 three-year subscriptions. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, he sold 12
of each type of subscription. On Friday, he sold 60 two-year subscriptions.
One-year subscriptions cost $20, two-year subscriptions cost $35, and three-
year subscriptions cost $52. On which day did he earn the most?
Solving this problem requires comparing the commissions made on three dif-
ferent days. Only three days are necessary, because the commissions are the
same for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Comparing the commissions
requires finding the total commission for each day by multiplying the number
of each type times the rate for that type times the price; then the commissions
from the different types are all added together. A table or chart is helpful in this
case to keep everything in order (see Table 2-1). You can do the commission
amount computations ahead of time. For one-year subscriptions, 5 percent of
$20 is $1. I got that by multiplying 0.05 × $20. Two-year subscriptions earn the
salesman 10 percent of $35, or $3.50; and three-year subscriptions are worth 20
percent of $52, which equals $10.40. Refer to Chapter 6 for more on percentage
problems involving decimals and percents.

Chapter 2: Planning Your Attack on a Word Problem

He had his highest commission on Friday. In Chapter 14, you see many prob-
lems involving quality × quantity — more like this type of problem.
The Problem: If Tom is twice as old as Dick was ten years ago, and if the sum
of their ages five years ago was 90, then how old is Tom now?
This problem is more like the word problems that most people remember
from their high school years. The problem almost seems like double-speak
when you first read it. I hate to give too much away right here, because I
cover age problems in great detail in Chapter 15, but let this be a tickler —
something to get you all enthused about doing more age problems.
You want to answer the question “How old is Tom?” So let Tom’s age be repre-
sented by t. You’re comparing Tom’s age to Dick’s age. So let Dick’s age be rep-
resented by d. But Tom’s age is compared to Dick’s age ten years ago. How old
was Dick ten years ago? You get that by subtracting 10, so Dick was d – 10 ten
years ago, and Tom is twice that or 2(d – 10). So you can say that t = 2(d – 10).
Well, there are lots of numbers that satisfy the equation t = 2(d – 10), so you
need a bit more information. You’re told that five years ago. . . . Their ages five
years ago were t – 5 and d – 5. The sum of their ages at that time was 90, so 
t – 5 + d – 5 = 90, which simplifies down to t + d = 100. So their ages today must
add up to 100. The algebraic way of solving the system of equations t = 2(d – 10)
and t + d = 100 is found in Chapter 17. For now, I’ll let you off the hook and tell
you that the solution is that Tom is 60 and Dick is 40.
Estimating an Answer to Check for Sense
No matter how easy or complicated a math word problem, you should always
have some guess or inkling or idea as to what the answer may be before you
even get started on solving it. Even if you’re way off with your guess, this
exercise is very useful. You’re more apt to check the work if you think that
the answer is way out there. Many times, you just find that you didn’t do a
very good job of guessing. Other times, you find that you made a mistake in
the arithmetic and you can go back and correct your error.
Guessing an answer
One of a student’s favorite instructions on a test is: Must show work. And here
I am, encouraging you to guess the answer. I’m a firm advocate of showing
work, too. But guessing is a great skill to have, and it’s useful when doing
these word problems. Showing the work and all the steps involved is good
practice, too, so you can apply the same steps and techniques on problems
that aren’t quite as easy to guess for the answers.
26
Part I: Lining Up the Basic Strategies 

The Problem: You have $10,000 to invest over the next year and will put
some of the money in an account earning 12 percent (risky) and three times
as much as that in an account earning 4 percent (safer). How much interest
will you earn?
You’re going to multiply some money by 12 percent and the rest by 4 percent.
(Refer to Chapter 10 on using formulas and Chapters 6 and 14 for more prob-
lems like this.) You make an estimate of the total amount of interest you’ll
earn by picking a percentage somewhere between 12 percent and 4 percent
and multiplying the $10,000 by that percent. Because more money is going to
be invested at the lower rate, you’ll probably use either 5 percent or 6 per-
cent. Let your guess be the 6 percent, making your estimate on the interest
earned be 6 percent of $10,000, or $600. Now, when you actually do the prob-
lem, if you get some out-of-the-world answer like $8,000, you’ll know that
you’ve put a decimal point in a wrong place or done some other silly compu-
tation. What’s the actual answer, you ask? It really is $600. Sometimes I even
surprise myself. I multiplied $2,500 by 12 percent and $7,500 (three times as
much as $2,500) by 4 percent and got a total of $600.
Doing a reality check
Some math word problems have answers that just don’t seem right. These
answers are the ones that definitely need checking. Other answers are just
obviously wrong, meaning that the problem needs reworking.
Being struck by the obvious
Math problems sometimes require solving algebraic equations. The algebra is
wonderful, but you run the risk of creating some extraneous roots. Extraneous
roots or solutions are answers that satisfy the algebraic equation but don’t
really mean a thing in the situation.
The Problem: If Folabo leaves home and drives 400 miles north while her
sister Fatima leaves home at the same time and drives 300 miles east, how far
apart are they?
A line segment drawn 400 miles upward connected to a line segment drawn
300 miles eastward forms two sides of a right triangle. You find out how far
apart they are by finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle. (In Chapter 18,
Pythagoras and his famous triangle are discussed at length. Pardon the pun.)
Anyway, to solve this you solve 4002 + 3002 = c2 for c and get c = ±500.
Obviously, the distance can’t be negative, so you just use the positive value
and determine that they’re 500 miles apart.
27
Chapter 2: Planning Your Attack on a Word Problem

Getting a firm grip on reality
Sometimes a weird answer looks good at first, and it takes careful checking to
show that it doesn’t work.
The Problem: I’m thinking of a number. If you subtract 1 from the number
and find the square root of the difference, you get the same answer as when
you subtract the number from 7. What is my number?
This problem requires a nice algebraic equation. (Chapter 11 has lots of prob-
lems like this, if these are up your alley.) Letting the number be represented 
by x, the equation to use is 
x

The two answers to this equation are x = 10 and x = 5. They both look per-
fectly wonderful, don’t they? Not! If you put 10 back in for x in the equation,
you get that 3 = –3. Doesn’t work. But putting the 5 in for x, you get that 2 = 2.
The 5 is a solution, and the 10 is extraneous — it satisfies the quadratic equa-
tion, but it makes no sense in the answer. (If you like this type of number
problem, you’ll find lots of them in Chapter 11.)

any mathematical problems involve units of length, weight, volume,
or money. You incorporate the units into your computations and
then report them in the answers so the solution makes sense and is useful.
Sometimes you’re confronted with problems that have two or more different
units — such as feet and inches or pounds and ounces — and you have to
make a decision as to which unit to use.
In this chapter, I offer suggestions on how to choose the unit or units and
then how to work with the unit or units you’ve chosen. This chapter also
covers the tricky conversions of square feet to square inches or cubic yards
to cubic feet. And, of course, no discussion of units is complete without intro-
ducing meters and kilograms, so you get conversions involving metric and
English measures.
Choosing the Best Measure
When a problem involves two different measures, you choose one or the other
measure to work with and convert the unchosen measure to the unit you want
so that they’re all the same. You may even decide to change measures when
they’re already all the same — just because you think that another measure
may work better.

Using miles instead of inches
A mile is much longer than an inch. In fact, there are 12 × 5,280 = 63,360 inches
in 1 mile. If you’re measuring how far it is from one side of the desk to another,
you’ll use inches. If you’re measuring how far it is from your home to your
workplace, you’ll usually measure in miles.
The Problem: Train tracks are made of metal, and metal expands when it gets
hot and shrinks when the weather is cold. When the tracks are put in place, a
gap should be left between the adjacent tracks to allow for expansion. A metal
track that’s 1 mile long expands with the heat and increases in length by 12
inches. There was no gap between the tracks, however, so it buckled in the
middle and formed a V shape. (See Figure 3-1 for a picture of what the track
looks like.) How high up did the track rise?
Two different measures are given: 1 mile and 12 inches. You can work with
inches, and change the 1 mile to 63,360 inches, or you can work with miles 
and write the 12 inches (1 foot) as ,5 280
1
mile. The choice here is between 
using really large numbers and using fractions or decimals.
I choose to go with the fractions — to work with pieces of a mile. To find out
how high the rise in the track is, I use the Pythagorean theorem (Chapter 18 is
completely devoted to that theorem of Pythagoras) and one right triangle
going halfway down the track. The bottom segment of the triangle is 1⁄2 mile 
long, and the hypotenuse (longest side) is 1⁄2 mile plus 6 inches or

The height or rise of 0.009732 doesn’t seem like much, but, remember, this is in

Working with square feet instead
of square yards
When you buy carpeting, you usually buy it in square yards — 3 feet by
3 feet. But you probably bought your last tile floor in terms of a number of
square feet.
The Problem: Using your yardstick, you measure the length of a room to be
6 yards and its width to be 5 yards. You plan on putting in 1-foot-square tiles.
How many tiles will you need?
Before determining the area of the room, first change the yards to feet using
1 yard = 3 feet. So 6 yards is 6 × 3 = 18 feet. Five yards is 5 × 3 = 15 feet. A room
that’s 18 feet by 15 feet is 18 × 15 = 270 square feet.
But what if you preferred finding the area in square yards, first, and then chang-
ing the area to square feet? The area of the room is 6 × 5 yards or 30 square
yards. A square yard is equal to 9 square feet (3 feet × 3 feet). So multiply 30 × 9
to get 270 square feet.
Converting from One Measure to Another
When a problem contains more than one measure, you change everything to
the same measure before doing the computing on the problem or solving the
equation. You can’t add 6 inches to 4 feet and get 10 — you have to change
the inches to feet or feet to inches. Knowing when to multiply and when to
divide sometimes gets confusing, so your best bet is to write down the equiv-
alence or change of units and then work from the equation.
31
Chapter 3: Coordinating the Units

Changing linear measures
First, here’s a list of some common equivalences used when working with
lengths. I cover the English and metric equivalences later, in “Mixing It Up
with Measures.”
1 foot = 12 inches
1 yard = 3 feet
1 mile = 5,280 feet
The measure equivalences are used to convert from one measure to another.
You may need to do more than one computation if there isn’t a direct equiva-
lence between units — such as changing inches to yards or yards to miles.
The Problem: Cheryl has 48 rolls of satin ribbon, each containing 15 yards of
ribbon. She plans to wrap packages to send overseas as gifts, and each pack-
age requires 30 inches of ribbon. How many packages can she wrap?
First, determine how many yards of ribbon are in those 48 rolls. Then change
the yards to feet using 1 yard = 3 feet and the feet to inches using 1 foot = 12
inches. After you have the total number of inches, you can divide by 30 to get
the number of packages that can be wrapped.
Multiplying 48 rolls × 15 yards you get 720 yards. Start with the equivalence
involving yards and feet. To change 720 yards to feet, you multiply each side
of the equation 1 yard = 3 feet by 720.

Part I: Lining Up the Basic Strategies 

Adjusting area and volume
Area is a two-dimensional measure. You’re counting up how many squares —
all the same size — fit into some flat region. You use area measures for floors
in buildings and spaces in parking lots, as well as when you want to find out
how much room there is in a backyard.
Volume is a three-dimensional measure and tells you how many cubes of a
particular size fit into an object. Volume measures tell you about the inside of
a refrigerator or the size of a cardboard carton.
1 square foot = 144 square inches (12 inches × 12 inches)
1 square yard = 9 square feet (3 feet × 3 feet)
1 square mile = 640 acres
1 cubic foot = 1,728 cubic inches (12 inches × 12 inches × 12 inches)
1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet (3 feet × 3 feet × 3 feet)
The Problem: Jimmy is going to play a prank on his dad and fill the refrigera-
tor with ice cubes that are 1 inch on a side. The refrigerator can hold 6 cubic
feet. How many ice cubes will Jimmy need?
Determine the number of cubic inches in 6 cubic feet by using the equiva-
lence 1 cubic foot = 1,728 cubic inches and multiplying each side of the 
equation by 6.

and he gets frostbite.
The Problem: Timothy bought 3,200 acres of land and intends to plant
seedling trees on it. If each seedling requires an area of 9 square yards to
grow properly, how many seedlings can he plan on his new acreage?
First, change the acres to square miles using 1 square mile = 640 acres and
then the square miles to square feet. Determine how many square feet are in
9 square yards using 1 square yard = 9 square feet and dividing the result into
the number of square feet in the acreage.

So 3,200 acres is equivalent to 5 square miles. Change the square miles
to square feet by multiplying each side of the equation 1 square mile =

139,392,000 square feet.
Now find the number of square feet that each tree needs. If each seedling needs
9 square yards, use the equivalence that 1 square yard = 9 square feet and mul-
tiply each side of the equation by 9 to get 9 square yards = 81 square feet.
Now divide 139,392,000 square feet by 81 square feet to get the number of
trees that will fit on the acreage. 139,392,000 divided by 81 = 1,720,888.89 trees.
That’s a lot of seedlings.
Keeping It All in English Units
Many countries, including the United States, use primarily the English units
of measurement. Pressure to change to metric hasn’t been strong enough,
even though advocates have proposed changing to metric for over 40 years.
The awkwardness of the English units is that they have all sorts of different
numbers in their equivalences — as compared to the metric system where all
the numbers are multiples of 10.
Comparing measures with 
unlikely equivalences
As disjointed as the English measurement system seems to be, it has a long
tradition and some interesting and charming equivalences. Here are some
more uncommon but historic measures, plus, to finish it off, a rate.

The Problem: The Preakness, one of the horse races in the Triple Crown, has
a distance of 9.5 furlongs. How many miles is that?
Change the furlongs to yards using 1 furlong = 220 yards and the yards to feet
using 1 yard = 3 feet. Then change the feet to miles using 1 mile = 5,280 feet.
The race is 9.5 furlongs, so multiply 9.5 × 220 to get 2,090 yards. Multiply
the number of yards by 3 to get the number of feet: 2,090 × 3 = 6,270. Now 
divide the 6,270 feet by 5,280 to get the number of miles: ,

in the denominator, a power of 10 that has as many zeros as there are digits

thunder, then how far away was the lightning strike in miles? And what is

First, determine how many feet the sound traveled by multiplying 1,100 feet
by 6 to get 6,600 feet. Determine the number of miles using 1 mile = 5,280 feet.
You divide 6,600 feet by 5,280 and you get 1.25 miles. According to what I was
told, the number of seconds you count is the number of miles away. I don’t
think I was told right.
Now, to the speed of sound in miles per hour, use the equivalence that 1 mile 
per hour is equal to 115
7 feet per second. The speed of sound is about 1,100 
feet per second. Write a proportion using these figures, letting the speed of
sound in miles per hour be represented by x. Then solve for x.

The speed of sound comes out to be about 750 miles per hour. This is a bit
over the speed you usually see quoted. The textbooks say that the speed of
sound is actually 1,088 feet per second at 32° F. I rounded the number up to
1,100 feet for ease in computation and assumed that the temperature during
a thunderstorm would be a bit warmer than 32°F.

Working for a bar of gold
Television’s favorite billionaire is interviewing
yet another group of potential employees. To
keep from being told, “You’re fired!” the finalists
have the following problem posed to them, and
the first person to come up with the solution will
not hear the dreaded words. The problem:
You’ve hired someone to work for you for the
next seven days. You must pay him 1⁄7 of a bar of
gold per day, but he requires a daily payment
of 1⁄7 of that bar of gold — no credit. It’s expen-
sive to cut through a bar of gold, so what are the
fewest number of cuts necessary to meet his
requirements?
Answer: You need make only two cuts. On Day 1, cut the bar at the 1⁄7 mark
and give it to the worker. On Day 2, cut off 2⁄7 of the bar, give that to the worker
and take the first 1⁄7 back. On Day 3, give the worker the original 1⁄7 to be
added to the 2⁄7 he already has. On Day 4, give the worker the remaining 4⁄7
of a bar and take back the 1⁄7 and 2⁄7 pieces. On Day 5, give the worker back
the 1⁄7 piece, so he’ll have the 4⁄7 piece and the 1⁄7 piece. On Day 6, take back
the 1⁄7 piece and give him the 2⁄7 piece. On Day 7, give him the last 1⁄7 piece.

Loving you a bushel and a peck
Volumes and weights take on some historically interesting values when work-
ing with equivalences. Do you buy your apples by the bushel, or is a peck all
you need?
1 quart = 2 pints = 4 cups
1 gallon = 4 quarts = 32 gills
1 bushel = 4 pecks
1 pound = 16 ounces
1 ton = 2,000 pounds = 20 hundredweights
The Problem: According to a recent census, the typical American ate 13.8
pounds of turkey in a recent year. If this represents the total amount of turkey
eaten at 12 different meals, then how many ounces of turkey were consumed
at each meal?
Change the number of pounds to ounces using 1 pound = 16 ounces by multi-
plying 16 × 13.8. Then divide the total number of ounces by 12. The product
of 16 × 13.8 = 220.8 ounces. Divide 220.8 ÷ 12 and you get 18.4 ounces per
meal. That’s over a pound of turkey at a sitting!
The next problem involves a phenomenon of agriculture and requires that
fruit growers adopt a good balance in their orchards. Consider an orchard
where a certain number of apples are produced by each tree in an average
year. If the number of trees in the orchard is increased, there’ll be more trees
producing apples, but the crowding causes a reduction in the number of
apples per tree. The balancing act for growers amounts to adding enough
trees to increase production but not too many to decrease the production
per tree by too much.
The Problem: An orchard contains 240 apple trees, which produce, on aver-
age, 2 bushels of apples per year. If the orchard manager increases the
number of trees in the orchard by 60, she calculates that the amount of
apples will be reduced by 1 peck per tree. If she goes ahead and plants those
60 additional trees, will the total crop be greater or smaller than the crop
obtained from the original 240 trees?
37
Chapter 3: Coordinating the Units

First, determine how many bushels of apples are produced by 240 apple trees
by multiplying 240 × 2 = 480 bushels. Increasing the number of trees by 60
results in 300 apple trees. The production of 300 trees will be 2 bushels less
1 peck. Change pecks to bushels with 1 bushel = 4 pecks, giving you that
1 bushel is 1⁄4 peck. Subtract 1⁄4 bushel from 2 bushels, and the yield per tree 
will be 1 4
3 bushels. Multiply the number of trees by the new yield, and you 
get a total of

Mixing It Up with Measures
Most of the problems in this book use the English measures of length,
volume, and weight. But metric measures are very important to know,
because of the great incidence of foreign travel and trade with other coun-
tries that use metrics.
Matching metric with metric
The metric measurement system is extremely easy to use, because all the
units and equivalents are powers of 10. A kilogram is 1,000 times as big as a
gram, and a centimeter is 0.01 as big as a meter. The multiplication and divi-
sion problems using metric measures are really a piece of cake. When you
learn what the different prefixes stand for, you can navigate your way through
the metric measurement system.
In the metric system, kilo means 1,000 times as much, hecto means 100 times
as much, deca means 10 times as much, deci means 1⁄10 as much, centi means
1⁄100 as much, and milli means 1⁄1,000 as much.
The Problem: Stephen is the track manager at a race-car competition that’s
16 kilometers long. If he wants to put a spotter every 25 meters for the length
of the race, then how many spotters will he need?
Change kilometers to meters using 1 kilometer = 1,000 meters and then divide
the total number of meters by 25. The 16-kilometer race is 16 × 1,000 = 16,000
meters long. Divide 16,000 ÷ 25 to get 640 spotters. That’s a lot of people!
The Problem: Stephanie works for a candy company and got permission to
produce a piece of licorice that’s 12 meters long. She’s going to take the
licorice to a party (just for the effect) and then divide it into individual pieces
that are each 3 centimeters long. How many pieces of licorice will she have?
38
Part I: Lining Up the Basic Strategies 

A centimeter is 1⁄100 of a meter, so there are 100 centimeters in a meter.
Multiply the 12 meters by 100, and you get 1,200 centimeters of licorice.
Divide that total by 3, and Stephanie will have 400 pieces of candy.
Changing from metric to English
You’ve decided to go to Europe and you want to be sure that you order the
right size beverage, know how far you’ll be traveling by car, and dress appro-
priately for the weather on any particular day. All these functions relate to
changing from English units of measure to metric measure. Here are some of
the more useful conversion equivalences you’ll need for your travels. For
help with the temperatures, refer to Chapter 10 for conversions from Celsius
to Fahrenheit and back again.
1 meter = 39.37 inches
1 kilometer = 0.621 mile
1 liter = 1.057 quarts
1 kilogram = 2.205 pounds
The Problem: You’re in Europe and about to take a day trip with a rented car
and trusty map. You’re going to drive from your hotel to a famous cathedral.
According to the map, the distance is 500 kilometers. How far is that in miles?
Use the equivalence 1 kilometer = 0.621 mile and multiply each side of the
equation by 500. You get that 500 kilometers = 310.5 miles. That’s a pretty
long trip, depending on what kinds of roads you’re going to find. You may
want to check on an overnight stop.
The Problem: You’re driving along and notice that you’ll be needing fuel very
soon. You spot a service station and pull over to buy fuel. The price on the
sign is $2.25. You gulp after you realize that the price is for 1 liter of fuel.
What is the price per gallon?
First, use the equivalence 1 liter = 1.057 quarts in a proportion with the price
of 1 liter = $2.25 to determine how much the fuel costs per quart. Then you
multiply that price by 4 because 1 gallon = 4 quarts.

Changing from English to metric
You’re on your European tour and you’ve brought some fabric samples to
make curtains for your hostess and a recipe so you can cook up a thank-you
dinner. Now you have the challenge of converting some of your measures
into the measures of the country you’re visiting.
1 yard = 0.9144 meter
1 pound = 0.454 kilogram
1 cup = 0.2365 liter
Part of the challenge of cooking in another country is trying to find the ingre-
dients that you’re used to working with at home. The other challenge comes
when you need to measure those ingredients.
The Problem: Your recipe for lasagna calls for a 16-ounce jar (2 cups) of
tomato sauce. You find a can of tomato puree (which you’ll have to spice up
a bit), and the can contains 3⁄4 liter of puree. How many cans of the puree will
you need to buy?
Create a proportion using 1 cup = 0.2365 liter and 2 cups = x liters. Solve for x,
which will be the amount of tomato sauce you need in terms of liters. Then
compare that amount to 3⁄4 or 0.75 liter.

You’ve had way too good of a time on your trip to Europe. You’ve been avoid-
ing getting on the scale to see if you’ve gained any weight, but you finally
decide, the day before leaving for home, to get on the scale to see what the
damage is. Omigosh! You’ve lost weight! You’ve lost a lot of weight! Then you
realize that the scale is in kilograms.
The Problem: You weigh yourself on a metric scale and it says 68. How many
pounds do you really weigh?
Use the equivalence 1 kilogram = 2.205 pounds and multiply each side of the
equation by 68. You get that 68 kilograms = 149.9 or 150 pounds.

S
olving a math word problem may seem daunting at first, but it doesn’t
have to be if you have a plan and the proper mindset. You don’t have to
use all the steps and procedures in this chapter for every math problem, but
here you see how different techniques are useful when attempting to solve a
problem.
In this chapter, I tell you what to look for in terms of the question and informa-
tion needed. I fill you in on all the steps used to solve an equation — and the
proper order to do them in. And I show you the need for checking your answer
at the end.
Laying Out the Steps to a Solution
A math word problem presents challenges in understanding, organization, and
launching the mathematical problem to be solved. To illustrate all these steps
(and more), consider a problem involving two friends and their walking adven-
ture. They both leave the same place at the same time; one walks north and the
other walks east. One walks faster than the other. And, for some reason known
only to them, they can determine how far apart they are after a period of time.
The Problem: Shelly and Shirley leave their dorm at 8 a.m. and start walking
in different directions. Shelly starts walking due north, and Shirley walks due
east. Shirley takes her time to smell the flowers and Shelly walks at a pretty
steady pace. So, at noon, when they stop walking, Shelly has gone 1 mile less
than twice as far as Shirley. At noon, they are 17 miles apart. How far did
Shelly walk?

Words, words, words. Somewhere in the description of the problem, you find
the question that needs to be answered, information that needs to be orga-
nized, other information that can be ignored, an appropriate drawing that can
be made, and an algebra problem begging to be written. In the following sec-
tions, I walk you through the various steps — steps you can apply to any
math word problem.
Step 1: Determine the question
The main thing that empowers you when you’re attempting a math word
problem is determining the question. You wade through all that information
and wonder what in the world you’re going to do with everything. So, find the
question, and you’ll have more direction. The question is usually at the end
of the problem description.
In this problem, the question is, indeed, at the end. How far did Shelly walk?
The only unit mentioned is miles — because they’re 17 miles apart — so your
answer should be something like: “Shelly walked _____ miles.”
Step 2: Organize the information
After you’ve determined what the question is (see the preceding section),
you can go back to the problem and decide what information is needed and
in what order you want to do the various steps. If you have an answer guess
or goal in mind, it’ll help you determine how the steps get arranged.

Part I: Lining Up the Basic Strategies 
How old was the wife?
At the time a man and woman married, the man
determined that his wife’s age was 3⁄4 of his age.
After 12 years of marriage, he found that his
wife’s age was now 5⁄6 of his age. How old was
his wife when they were married?
Answer: The wife was 18 years old. If she was 3⁄4 his age, then he was 24 and
she was 18. After 12 years of marriage, she was 30 and he was 36, and her age
was 5⁄6 his age.

Eliminating the unneeded
The problem mentions the distance that Shelly and Shirley walked and the dis-
tance they’re apart. Also, in the problem description you see times listed. You
don’t need the time they started and finished, because there’s no mention of
rates — requiring you to use d = rt. So just eliminate or ignore the mention
of the times. It’s just fluff. It also doesn’t matter why Shirley walked slower;
it could have been that her legs are shorter.
Shelly and Shirley leave their dorm at 8 a.m. and start walking in different direc-
tions. Shelly starts walking due north, and Shirley walks due east. Shirley takes
her time to smell the flowers, and Shelly walks at a pretty steady pace. So, at
noon, when they stop walking, Shelly has gone 1 mile less than twice as far as
Shirley. At noon, they are 17 miles apart. How far did Shelly walk?
Making an educated guess
The problem involves two people walking in different directions and ending
up 17 miles apart. If they walked in opposite directions — one north and one
south — you’d expect the sum of the distances they walked to be 17. Neither
could have walked more than 17 miles. In this case, they walked at right
angles from one another, so the sum of the distances that they walked has
to be less than 17. Keeping in mind a reasonable answer, you’re more likely to
set up the process (equations and operations) properly. So some possible
answers are that Shelly walked 10 miles and Shirley walked 5 miles. The num-
bers don’t really need to fit or be the right answer. You just have a relation-
ship in mind — that Shelly walked farther and the sum of their distances is
less than 17.
Getting organized
The question asks for the distance that Shelly walked. So you want some 
algebraic expression involving that distance. You could let the distance be
represented by x. But look back at the problem to see what other distances
are involved. You have the number 17 representing the distance between
them, so you don’t need a symbol for that distance. The only other distance
is the distance that Shirley walked. You could let the distance that Shirley
walked be represented by y, but then you’d have two different variables —
x and y — to worry about. You want to keep to one variable, if possible.
The last bit of information that hasn’t been used is that Shelly has gone 1 mile
less than twice as far as Shirley. The two distances are compared to one
another. Letting the distance that Shirley traveled be represented by y, you
can let Shelly’s distance be written in terms of y. Shelly went 2y – 1 miles:
twice Shirley’s less 1. Now you have y for Shirley’s distance and 2y – 1 for
Shelly’s distance.
43
Chapter 4: Stepping through the Problem

Step 3: Draw a picture or make a chart
This problem just begs to have a picture drawn. But a chart or table may be
helpful, too. In the following sections, I show you both options and let you
decide which works best.
Providing some artwork
Shelly walks north and Shirley walks east. You have to assume that it’s possible
for them to stay exactly on track and walk due north and due east, respectively,
and not have to veer off. Math problems are usually about optimal situations,
not the reality of how roads are laid out.
Figure 4-1 shows you a sketch of the paths taken by Shelly and Shirley. The
representations of their distances — y for Shirley and 2y – 1 for Shelley —
are shown, as is their distance apart.
The picture of their paths seems to suggest a right triangle. And a right trian-
gle comes with that most famous formula, the Pythagorean theorem. If you
hadn’t thought of that theorem before you saw the picture, you probably did
after seeing it.
Figuring out possible values with a table
This problem has Shelly traveling one less than twice as far as Shirley. You
could make a table of possible values for the distances they traveled. You’d
probably be interested only in whole-number values, which won’t solve the
problem if the answer is a fraction, but you may get fairly close to the answer.
Table 4-1 has some possible numbers or distances, starting with Shirley going
1 mile and ending to keep the total distance from getting larger than 17.

This table doesn’t really get you any closer to the answer, but it shows you
how the distances are related. You know that the total distance has to be less
than 17, so several of the entries in the table give possible solutions to the
problem.
Step 4: Align the units
Many problems come with two or more different units. You may have informa-
tion on time in terms of minutes and seconds, information on distance in
terms of feet and yards, or some combination of all these. You can’t really

Counting cars
On a warm, sunny day, Clark went to the car
races to watch an automobile race. As the
cars sped around the track and Clark tried to
watch them, he got dizzy. So he decided to keep
his eyes on one particular car — the bright
green one.
Clark then decided to count how many cars were
in the race. He noticed that the total number of
cars was equal to one-third of the cars in front of
the green car plus three-quarters of the cars
behind the green car plus the green car. How
many cars were in the race?
Answer: The total number of cars was 13. In the problem, you’re given infor-
mation about one-third and three-quarters of the cars in front of and behind
the green car. This total has to be divisible by 12, so the number of cars must
be 12, 24, 36, and so on. Using the 12, you get a winner. Add the green car,
and you get 13.

change minutes and feet into the same unit, but feet and yards can be changed
to feet, and minutes and seconds can be changed into minutes (or seconds).
(Turn to Chapter 3 for a full coverage of how to deal with units.)
In this problem, because the only unit mentioned (after the time was elimi-
nated) is miles, you just leave the unit as is. You’re finished in terms of the
units.
Step 5: Set up the operations or tasks
This is where all the previous steps should be coming together. You have the
question in mind and a picture of what’s happening. You have an estimate or
guess of how the answer should come out. You have variable expressions
representing the distances traveled. Now you need to set up a process or
equation. Sometimes the process is no more than multiplying a number by 2
or 3. That’s the best-case scenario. But it’s much more fun when you set up
an equation to be solved.
The previous work on this problem suggests an equation. You have two dif-
ferent distances represented by expressions involving a y. Write an equation
and solve for y. What equation? Why Pythagoras’s, of course!
In a right triangle whose shorter sides are a and b in length and whose
longest side is c long, the following is always true: a2 + b2 = c2.
The distances that Shirley and Shelly walked are the a and b of a right triangle.
The distance that they’re apart, 17 miles, is the c value. Substituting into the
Pythagorean theorem, the equation a2 + b2 = c2 becomes (y)2 + (2y – 1)2 =172.

Finding a concrete solution
Mike had just finished pouring and smoothing
out a new concrete sidewalk when he noticed
that someone had written in the numbers 777
111 999 in the walk. He should have been angry
or disgusted, but instead, he made a puzzle
of the numbers. His puzzle: Cross out six of
these nine numbers, leaving three, such that the
sum of the numbers remaining is 20. How did he
get 20?
Answer: Mike crossed out the three 7s, the first 1, and two of the 9s. That left
him with 11 + 9 = 20.

Solving the Problem
A math word problem is different from other arithmetic and algebra prob-
lems, because you first have to translate from the words to the symbols
before you do the operations or solve the equation for the answer.
Step 6: Perform the operations 
or solving the equation
The problem involving Shelly and Shirley boils down to an equation to solve.
The equation is quadratic — requiring either factoring (coupled with the mul-
tiplication property of zero) or the quadratic formula. Some operations are
performed on the equation first — squaring the binomial and simplifying
terms, and the result of the simplifying is a quadratic equation set equal to 0.
The equation (y)2 + (2y – 1)2 =172 can actually be solved by factoring, but I’ll
show it both that way and with the quadratic formula, because the factoring
may not be entirely obvious to you.
Solving the equation using factoring
The equation (y)2 + (2y – 1)2 =172 is quadratic. You first square each of the
terms, including the binomial, and then simplify the terms by combining what
you can. Then move all the terms to the left to set it equal to 0.

The factorization of this quadratic is the product of two binomials. The first
terms in the binomials have to be 5y and y. There’s no other choice. It’s the
second numbers that will be the challenge. You have to find two numbers
whose product is 288 — that’s challenge enough. But then you have to figure
out how to arrange the factors so that the difference between the outer and
inner products is 4y.

The two factors that work are 36 and 8. Their product is 288, and, when you
multiply the 8 by 5 and the 36 by 1 you get 40 and 36, respectively. The differ-
ence between the two products is 4. The product 40y has to be negative for
47
Chapter 4: Stepping through the Problem

the difference 4y to come out negative. So the factor 8 is negative and the
factor 36 is positive in the factorization.
(5y + 36)(y – 8) = 0
Setting the two factors equal to 0, you get y

= -
or y = 8. The negative 
fraction doesn’t make any sense if this is supposed to represent distance, so
you go with the solution y = 8, only.
Solving the equation using the quadratic formula
Not all quadratic equations can be solved by factoring. And sometimes those
that can be solved by factoring are more easily solved using the quadratic
formula. On the other hand, all quadratic equations can be solved using the
formula. It’s just that factoring is usually quicker, easier, and more accurate
(not as many opportunities for error).
The quadratic formula says that if a quadratic equation is written in the form
ax2 + bx + c = 0, then its solutions are found with x

Step 7: Answer the question
After working hard at solving the quadratic equation, it’s tempting to just sit
back, relax, and think that your work is done. Not so. The solution of the equa-
tion that you think will work is that y = 8. What is y? Does its value answer the
question?
48
Part I: Lining Up the Basic Strategies 

First, y represents the distance that Shirley walked. The question asks how
far Shelly walked, so the number 8 is not the answer to the question. To
determine how far Shelly walked, use 2y – 1 and replace the y with 8. You get
that 2(8) – 1 = 16 – 1 = 15. So Shelly walked 15 miles.
Step 8: Check for accuracy 
and common sense
Accuracy and common sense go hand in hand. You can’t have one without the
other. The accuracy part goes to the arithmetic or algebra involved in solving
the problem and whether the relationships hold. The common sense refers to
whether the answer — even though it’s the solution of an equation — really
fits the problem and the real world.
In the case of Shirley and Shelly who walked away from each other in direc-
tions that are right angles from one another, you find that Shirley walked
8 miles and Shelly walked 15 miles. They’re only 17 miles apart — even
though they walked a total of 23 miles — because their journeys and the dis-
tance between them formed a right triangle. They didn’t walk in opposite
directions. As far as the accuracy of the solution, check out the Pythagorean
theorem with the distances:

f you’re like most people, you’re leery of word problems because the tasks
involved in solving them aren’t always immediately apparent. The task or
operation doesn’t cooperate by standing up and shouting, “Here I am!” Sure,
everyone is more comfortable with a simple addition problem or maybe a
combination multiply-then-subtract problem. Give me a + or × any day, and
I’m in hog heaven. (Well, that may be stretching it a bit.) The challenge of
doing a word problem comes when you have to decide which operations
to use and in what order.
In this chapter, you get some down-to-earth tips — so you can change a wordy
description or situation into a standard arithmetic problem. Here I show you
how to spot the clues that lie along the path toward a word problem’s solution.
Does It All Add Up?
The easiest arithmetic operation you encounter is addition. The first things
that kids master in school are addition rules and addition tables. So it’s always
comforting to find a word problem that involves the operation of addition. A
big clue that you’re probably dealing with an addition problem is the word and.
(See Chapter 1 for more on the mathematical meanings of everyday words.)
Determining when the sum is needed
The word and indicates that you want a sum, but you can’t assume that
everything on one side of an and and everything on the other side of an and
gets added up. For example, if you’re talking about Jim and Jon going to a

hockey game, you don’t add Jim and Jon together. You can add their ages or
their weights or the number of hamburgers that they eat, but you don’t add
people or colors. You just add numbers.
The Problem: Michael and Owen went shopping. Michael bought new jeans
that cost $49.95 and a T-shirt that cost $12.50. What was the total cost of his
purchase?
The last sentence tells you that you need a total; the word and between the
prices of the clothing suggests that you add. So, finding the sum of $49.95 +
$12.50, you get $62.45. (Note: This sum doesn’t include any sales tax; I cover
finding and adding in sales tax in Chapter 6.)
Adding up two or more
You probably remember your second-grade teacher (mine was Mrs. Dopke —
haven’t thought about her in years) and those splendid columns of numbers
that you added for days and days and days. For example, you got to find the
sum of 299 and 401 and 650 and 850 and 76 and 24. Notice the repeated use of
the word and? That’s your signal to add and add and add.
As you do the addition problem, you want to take advantage of any grouping
of numbers that makes the sum more convenient. Notice in the listing in the
preceding paragraph that the 99 in 299 and the 1 in 401 add up to an even
100. The 50s in the 650 and 850 add up to an even 100. Nice combinations like
these don’t happen all the time, but you can take advantage of the nice sums
if you catch them in time.
The Problem: Liam and Cassidy spent the day picking strawberries — a hot
and backbreaking job, but someone has to do it. Every time they filled a flat
with fresh fruit, they took it back to the weighing shed and picked up a new,
empty box to fill. In all, they filled 12 flats of strawberries weighing: 9.3 pounds,
10.4 pounds, 8.7 pounds, 11.2 pounds, 9.5 pounds, 10.5 pounds, 11.0 pounds,
8.9 pounds, 9.8 pounds, 8.6 pounds, 10.1 pounds, and 9.1 pounds. What is the
total weight of all the strawberries that they picked that day?
It’s probably pretty obvious that you want to add all the numbers together.
Multiplying 12 numbers at a time or in a row doesn’t sound like a good idea —
or like a lot of fun. The and tells you to add, and the last digits in the weights
are just begging for you to take advantage of grouping numbers together
before adding. Specifically, group the numbers whose decimal values add up
to 10. (Actually, they add up to 1: 0.3 and 0.7 = 1.0 or 1.) Rewriting the 12 num-
bers in groups of nicely-combining numbers, you get: (9.3 + 8.7) and (10.4 + 8.6)
and (11.2 + 9.8) and (9.5 + 10.5) and (8.9 + 10.1) and (11.0 + 9.1). Actually, the
54
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

last two don’t have decimals that add up to 1, they’re just left over, and it
seemed nice to let them form a group, too. Adding up the numbers in the
parentheses and then summing the sums, you get 18.0 + 19.0 + 21.0 + 20.0 +
19.0 + 20.1 = 37.0 + 41.0 + 39.1 = 117.1 pounds.
Did you notice how I grouped the groups to make the addition easier? I wish
Mrs. Dopke had shown me that trick earlier, to avoid all the pain and agony of
those huge columns of numbers.
What’s the Difference — When You
Subtract?
Subtraction is an operation that’s just a little harder than addition. Subtraction
is still a basic operation, though, and shouldn’t pose too much of a problem for
you. The main challenge in subtraction is getting the order of the numbers
right. Do you subtract 90 minus 47 or 47 minus 90? It’s pretty obvious, when
doing word problems about practical matters, such as weights and money,
which number you subtract from which — it’s more in the algebra word prob-
lems, where you can end up with negative numbers, that you have to be espe-
cially careful about the order of subtraction.

Chapter 5: Deciding On the Operation
An old counting trick
Old Mother Hubbard had more problems than a
bare cupboard. She also had to figure out where
to put all her children when they went to bed.
She had 11 children to put in 10 beds, and she
had promised them that each would have his or
her own bed. She accomplished this great feat
by putting two children in the first bed — with the
promise that the second would have a bed to
himself later, after all the others were settled in.
Then she put the third child in the second bed,
the fourth child in the third bed, the fifth in the
fourth bed, the sixth in the fifth bed, the seventh
in the sixth bed, the eighth in the seventh bed, the
ninth in the eighth bed, and the tenth in the ninth
bed. She then put the eleventh child, who was
temporarily located in the first bed, in the bed
that was left. What an amazing woman! How did
she do it?
Answer: Poor old Mother Hubbard must have been extra tired, not extra
clever. She assumed that the eleventh child was the extra child in the first
bed. She actually had ten children in the first nine beds, with the eleventh
child still left standing. She had counted the second child and the eleventh
child as being the same.

Deciphering the subtraction lingo
Here are some words that tell you to use the operation of subtraction: less,
lower, fewer, difference, minus, and, of course, subtract. Someone can weigh
10 pounds less than another person (fie on them). Your colleague can make
a lower salary than you (but you deserve it). To make comparisons of things
such as weights or money or temperatures, you subtract.
The Problem: Avery lives 47 miles from Grandma’s house, and Reid lives 63
miles from Grandma’s house. How many fewer miles from Grandma does Avery
live than Reid?
The problem suggests subtraction, because there’s a comparison of numbers.
You subtract 47 miles from 63 miles to get: 63 – 47 = 16 miles, and the answer
is that Avery lives 16 miles fewer from Grandma than Reid.
Actually, the question could have been: “How many more miles away does
Reid live from Grandma than Avery?” Notice that the word fewer changed to
more and that the names got reversed, too. It’s sort of like negating things
twice. The answer is the same, it’s just stated differently.
When combining signed (positive and negative) numbers in algebra, two nega-
tives or reverses can make a positive. For instance, the opposite of negative 4,
written –(–4), is equal to positive 4.
Subtracting for the answer
Sometimes a clue or key word isn’t really apparent in a word problem; it may
be there and you don’t recognize it, or it just may not be there at all. You
have to determine which operation or operations are needed without much
help. In the case of problems that finally end up using subtraction, you’ll find
that the situation has to do with finding the difference between two values —
how much bigger one is than the other.

How many apples?
If I took 12 apples from a pile of 23 apples, how
many apples would I have?
Answer: Is your answer 11 apples? Wrong! If I took 12 apples from the pile,
then I have 12 apples!

The Problem: Ruby is taking a mathematics class where 4 tests, 10 quizzes,
and 20 homework assignments determine her grade. She has one test left to
take and needs 920 points to get an A in the course. She currently has 847
points, and the test is worth 100 points. How many points does she have to
get on the test to get an A? Is it possible for her to get an A?
This problem is an example of a situation where you have to wade through all
the information to figure out what’s needed to answer the question. The fact
that there are 4 tests, 10 quizzes, and 20 homework assignments has nothing
to do with the question. Also, there aren’t any clue words such as difference
or less. To answer the question, Ruby needs to subtract 847 from 920 to see
how many points she needs. Then she can compare that answer to the
number of points possible. Doing the subtraction, 920 – 847 = 73. It looks like,
if Ruby gets 73 percent of the points on the test, she’ll get her A.
How Many Times Do I Have to Tell You?
Multiplication is really just repeated addition. If you’re adding the same number
to itself over and over again, then you’re really doing multiplication, and the
multiplication facts are very helpful. Some of the key or clue words for multipli-
cation are: times, multiplied, twice, and thrice. (Okay, so nobody says “thrice”
anymore, but if they did, it would be a clue that multiplication was involved.)
Doing multiplication instead of 
repeated addition
Addition is a comfortable operation, but it can get tedious after a while, if you
have to repeat the same task over and over again. Word problems involving

Using four 4s
Can you create the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
using four 4s and the operations of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division, only?
Answer: To write the number 1, use 44 ÷ 44 = 1. To write the number 2, how
about (4 × 4) ÷ (4 + 4) = 2? And then 3 = (4 + 4 + 4) ÷ 4. The number 4 should
be the easiest, but it isn’t. Here’s the trick: 4 + 4 (4 – 4) = 4. And the number
5 is found with [(4 × 4) + 4] ÷ 4. These aren’t the only ways to write the num-
bers 1 through 5 using four 4s. See if you can find other ways to do the task.
Also, try writing 6 through 10 using four 4s.

multiplication may be spelled out pretty clearly, or they may be masked with
some math jargon such as thrice or quadruple.
Dealing with clear-cut multiplications
You already know that you aren’t interested in repeated additions when mul-
tiplication is so much easier to handle. The multiplication problems can be
fairly simple or bordering on the challenging. No matter what the situation,
you can handle it.
The Problem: Sydney has a new job and wants to draw up a timetable for
every day of the week so she can get everything done at home as well as at
her job. She wants to know, “How many hours are in the month of January?”
With 24 hours in a day, and 31 days in the month of January, Sidney can add
24 plus 24 plus 24 a total of 31 times. Of course, it makes much more sense to
multiply 31 × 24 to get 744 hours.
The Problem: Have you ever been amazed that your heart keeps beating and
beating without your thinking about it or doing anything to help? Just how
hard does your heart work? An average adult’s heart beats 72 times each
minute; a child’s heart beats faster than that — more like 90 times each minute.
Use the heart rate of an average adult — 72 times each minute — to answer the
question: How many times does the heart of an average adult beat in one day?
You want to multiply to get this answer, and there are actually two different
multiplication problems to deal with. First, you need to know how many min-
utes there are in one day; you determine that by multiplying 60 minutes times
24 hours. Then you can multiply the number of minutes times the number of
heart beats. For the number of minutes in one day, 60 × 24 = 1,440 minutes.
Multiplying that by 72, you get 1,440 × 72 = 103,680 beats of the heart. That’s
just in one day!
The problem involving minutes and hours and heart beats involved several
ratios of units. There are minutes per hour, hours per day, and beats per
minute. And your answer comes out to be beats per day. How does the answer
work out to be in the correct number of units? Look at the preceding problem,
written as fractions multiplied together.

Doubling or tripling your pleasure
The special math words that deal with multiplying something a number
of times are somewhat recognizable. Here are the more commonly used 
multipliers:
 Double: Two times
 Twice: Two times
 Triple: Three times
 Thrice: Three times, in Shakespeare’s day
 Quadruple: Four times
 Quintuple: Five times
The Problem: Juan was told that he had to quadruple the amount of his sales
in the next six months in order to win that trip to Tahiti. His sales are currently
at $230,000, so what level of sales does he have to reach in the next six months
to get that vacation?
The word quadruple means to multiply by 4, so $230,000 × 4 = $920,000. Aw,
Juan can do it!
Taking charge of the number of times
Multiplying numbers can result in quite large results. This isn’t a bad thing —
especially if you’re talking about your bank account. It’s just that large num-
bers can get unwieldy — to write and to deal with in a calculator. Here are
two options for handling large numbers: Write the numbers in scientific nota-
tion, or change the units.
Writing numbers using scientific notation
Scientific notation was developed to allow scientists, mathematicians, and
people like you and me to write really, really large numbers or teeny, tiny small
numbers without using up a full page to express the numbers for the reader.
The format for a number written in scientific notation is a number
between 1 and 10 times a power of 10: n × 10p. For example, the number
230,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 is written as 2.3 × 1026 in scientific nota-
tion. The number 2.3 is between 0 and 10, and it multiplies a power of 10.
See how much shorter the number in scientific notation is than the number
written out the long way? Also, comparing two large numbers is easier when
they’re written in scientific notation. You look at the power of 10, first, and
then compare the multiplier.
59
Chapter 5: Deciding On the Operation

To change a number into scientific notation, you move the decimal point
from the right end of the number until there’s just one digit to the left of the
decimal point. With just one digit in front of the decimal point, you automati-
cally have a number between 1 and 10. The power that you put on the 10 is
the number of places that you had to move the decimal point. Moving the
decimal point to the left gives you a positive exponent, and moving the deci-
mal point to the right requires a negative exponent.
For really small numbers, the power on the 10 is a negative number. So,
the number 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000123 is written as
1.23 × 10–39 in scientific notation.
Many scientific calculators write scientific notation using the letter E instead
of a power of 10. On your calculator screen, you’ll see 2.3E26 instead of 
2.3 × 1026 or 1.23E–39 instead of 1.23 × 10–39. This isn’t a big problem — you
just want to be aware of this cryptic notation so that you know what it means
and can write it correctly.
Changing units to make numbers smaller
Keep in mind how units are related when working with a large number — that
happens to be of one type of unit. For example, because there are 5,280 feet in
a mile, you can say 45 miles instead of 23,760 feet. With 16 ounces in a pound
and 2,000 pounds in a ton, you can say 9 tons instead of 288,000 ounces.
The Problem: Don has 150 drafting rulers, each of which is 18 inches long. If
he lays the rulers end to end, how long a line of rulers can he form?
Multiply 150 × 18 to get 2,700 inches. That’s a perfectly good answer. But Don
can also report that the line is 225 feet or 75 yards. How do you get the other
units? There are 12 inches in a foot and 36 inches in a yard. So you can divide
2,700 either by 12 or by 36 to get the feet or yards, respectively.
60
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 
Rolling out the barrel
A man wants to fill a barrel exactly half full of oil,
but there are no markings on the barrel to tell
where the halfway mark is, and there are no
measuring instruments to do any measurements.
The man is very clever, though (he’s read this
book), and he is able to fill the barrel exactly
halfway. How did he do it?
Answer: As the oil flowed into the barrel, the man kept the barrel tipped to
one side (with some help — it got pretty heavy). He watched until the oil in
the barrel just reached the lip of the barrel and, at the same time, just covered
the bottom of the barrel. The oil was then exactly half the volume of the barrel.

Another way to look at the problem is to change the 18 inches to feet or
yards first, before you multiply by 150. Eighteen inches is 1.5 feet. Multiplying
1.5 × 150, you get 225 feet. Eighteen inches is also half a yard. Multiplying 1⁄2 ×
150 you get 75 yards. The answers are the same, of course. You just have to
choose how you want to deal with the numbers — and when to change them
to smaller units.
Dividing and Conquering
Division is usually the last of the four basic operations that kids study in
school. Why? Because many of the results are not whole numbers. When you
add, subtract, or multiply whole numbers together, you always get a whole
number as a result (or an integer — in the case of subtracting a larger
number from a smaller number). Not so with division. Not every division
problem comes out evenly, and dealing with a remainder can be a bit unset-
tling or even daunting.
Using division instead of subtraction
Just as multiplication is used instead of repeated addition, you can say that
division is used instead of repeated subtraction. For example, if Keisha wants
to hand out 4 pieces of candy to each of her friends and she has 38 pieces of
candy, she can give 4 pieces to the first friend and 4 pieces to the second
friend and so on until 9 friends have 4 pieces of candy each — and Keisha has
2 left over. Of course, you would do the division problem 38 ÷ 4 = 9 with a
remainder of 2. The remainder can also be written as a fraction (2⁄4, which can
be simplified to 1⁄2).
The Problem: Clara ordered a barrel of M&M’s online and was billed for
11,000 ounces of candy. How many pounds of M&M’s did Clara order?

The world’s smallest computer
This morning, I bought a word processor small
enough to fit in my pocket. It can write in any
language that I want and use any alphabet I
need. It can also add, subtract, multiply, and
divide. It has a delete capability that will correct
all errors. No battery or power outlet is needed.
And, believe it or not, it only cost me a quarter.
How is this possible?
Answer: My word processor is a pencil.

One pound is equivalent to 16 ounces, so divide 11,000 by 16. This doesn’t
come out even: 11,000 ÷ 16 = 687 with a remainder of 8. Clara ordered 6878⁄16
(or 6871⁄2) pounds of M&M’s.
Making use of pesky remainders
When a division problem doesn’t come out even — when the number you’re
dividing into isn’t a multiple of the number you’re dividing by — you have
several options:
 You can report the remainder as a number, which is the actual value of
the remainder.
 You can report the remainder as a fraction.
 You can round the number up to the next higher number.
 You can just lop off the remainder and ignore it.
The following problems give examples of when and how to use the different
options.
Reporting the amount remaining
You report the amount of a remainder if the amount left over is to be treated
in a different way — that is, if it doesn’t figure into the answer to the problem.
An example involves a doughnut shop and a worker putting a certain number
of doughnuts into boxes.
The Problem: Pete works at a doughnut shop and is packing the morning’s
supply of doughnuts into boxes containing one dozen doughnuts each. The
owner of the doughnut shop tells Pete that he can keep any that are left after
filling as many boxes as possible. Pete started with 4,000 doughnuts. How
many doughnuts does he get to keep?
Pete has to put one dozen doughnuts in each box. It takes 12 donuts to make
a dozen. Divide 4,000 by 12 and determine the remainder — if there is one:
4,000 ÷ 12 = 333 with 4 left over. The owner of the shop has 333 boxes of
donuts to sell, and Pete gets the last 4. This is a case where it didn’t make
sense to change the remainder to a fraction or decimal. The last four dough-
nuts weren’t going to be sold — but the number of doughnuts remaining was
pretty important to Pete!
Creating a fraction or decimal of the remainder
When you’re dividing one number by another, you often have the situation
where the division doesn’t come out even. This happens when the number
62
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

being divided isn’t a multiple of the number doing the dividing. The remainder
may or may not have importance. Examples of cases where the remainder does
have importance are when vendors sell fractions of pounds of candy or meat
or some other product. In these cases, the vendors include the remainder in
the computations — they don’t want to lose even a small fraction of the amount.
The Problem: Chuck, the candy-store owner, has a large box of jelly beans
that weighs 480 pounds. He wants to divide this large box into 100 smaller
boxes and sell each of the smaller packages for $2.50 per pound. How much
does each of the smaller boxes weigh?
The 480 pounds of candy divided into 100 smaller units doesn’t come out to a
whole number of pounds of candy in smaller boxes. Chuck changes the remain-
der into a fraction and uses it in determining the cost of each small box. To
answer the question, you don’t need to know the cost per pound — that’s just
extra information needed by Chuck. Just do the division: 480 ÷ 100 = 4 with a
remainder of 80. Change the 80 to a fraction or decimal, and the result of the 
division is 4

Rounding up — numbers, not cattle
Rounding the answer of a division problem to a whole number results in a
new answer that’s an approximation of the real, exact answer. Rounding
answers is practical and makes sense in many situations.
The standard rule for rounding numbers is to round down when the fractional
or decimal part is less than half (when the remainder is less than half of the
divisor), round up when the fractional part is more than half, and round to
the closer even number when the fractional part is exactly half.
Some businesses can’t (or don’t choose to) use the standard rule of round-
ing. They round all fractions up to the next higher whole number. For exam-
ple, with some phone companies, you pay for a whole number of minutes,
and any fraction of a minute is considered to be the whole thing.
The Problem: Stefanie made some homemade jelly and wants to divide it
among ten of her best friends. She has a total of 64 ounces of jelly. She has
some jars that hold 6 ounces of jelly, other jars that hold 7 ounces of jelly,
and still other jars that hold 8 ounces of jelly. What size jars will she use if
she wants to distribute all the jelly evenly, and not have any left over?
If Stefanie has 64 ounces of jelly and divides that among ten friends, then you
divide 64 ÷ 10 = 6.4 ounces per friend. You can’t force 6.4 ounces of jelly into a
6 ounce jar, so you round up to 7 and leave a little room at the top of each of
those jars. The 8-ounce jars are overkill. Rounding up does have its practical
applications.
63
Chapter 5: Deciding On the Operation

Rounding down or truncating the remainder
Most scientific calculators round up or down automatically when an answer
has more decimal places than are available in the display. Back in the good old
days of early, handheld calculators, you were more apt to see long decimal
answers being truncated — meaning that the extra decimal values were just
dropped off with no consideration given for rounding one way or the other.
The Problem: Ebenezer announced to his employees that he would be doing
some profit-sharing with them. The nine employees would each get one-ninth
of the $75 profit each month — and be paid in silver dollars. So the employ-
ees each got $8 per month, for a total of $96 for the year. How could Ebenezer
have been just a bit more fair to his employees?
First, dividing 75 by 9, you get 8 with a remainder of 3. In decimals, this is .8 3.
(That line over the 3 indicates that the number repeats forever.) It looks like
Ebenezer just lopped off the remainder and kept it himself — because he paid
in silver dollars and no other coins, he couldn’t give his employees the fraction
of the total. But if Ebenezer really wanted to be fair, he would multiply the 75
times the 12 months of the year to get 900. Dividing that by 9, each employee
would get 100 dollars for the whole year instead of 96 dollars (8 × 12). He could
give the extra as a holiday bonus.
Mixing Up the Operations
Most of the interesting problems — the ones that you find in real life — are
made up of words describing a situation or question that is solved using one or
more operations. The best problems are those that involve more than one oper-
ation. Okay, that’s from my perspective, but I’m going to try to win you over to
my side with some scintillating examples.

Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 
Pocketing the difference
The story goes (and it may just be one of
those urban legends) that an enterprising bank
employee figured out how to program the bank’s
computers so that any fractions of cents that
occurred when the interest was computed on a
savings account got deposited in his own per-
sonal account. So, if a person was supposed to
earn $37.43255 in interest, the $0.00255 was
lopped off the interest amount and placed in the
employee’s account. This fraction of a dollar
doesn’t seem like much, but, if you add up the
fractions of dollars from every account, the
amount grows and grows. Again, according to
the story, he got away with it for a few years.
But, as happens to those who go astray, he
finally got caught.

When more than one operation is involved, you need to be cautious about
which operations to use and in what order to use them. Making decisions
about the operations and the order requires a mixture of good old common
sense and a willingness to tackle a problem, slightly seasoned with some
good old math rules.
Doing the operations in the correct order
One challenge of dealing with two or more operations is determining the
order in which you do these operations. Sometimes the path or order is clear
cut. Sometimes the problem is loaded with pitfalls or opportunities to flub.
You need to keep in mind the order of operations from algebra when doing
multiple operations in story problems.
The order of operations says that, when you have more than one operation to
do, first perform any powers or roots, then do any multiplication or division,
and end by doing any addition or subtraction. The order of operations can be
interrupted, though, by parentheses or brackets or other grouping symbols.
Here are some examples of using the order of operations:
4 + 12 ÷ 3 – 1 = 7
First you do the division, 12 ÷ 3 = 4. Then you
have the problem 4 + 4 – 1. Do these operations
in order, moving from left to right: 8 – 1 = 7.
(62 – 10) ÷ 13 + 5 = 7
First you have to simplify the terms in the paren-
theses. Square the 6 to get 36. Subtract 10 from
36 to get 26. The problem now reads: 26 ÷ 13 + 5.
Do the division and then add. 2 + 5 = 7.
This is just a quick review of the order of operations. If you need more of an
explanation, refer to my book Algebra For Dummies (Wiley), where I give a
more thorough explanation.
Now I’ll show you how the order of operations works in a practical situation.
Consider a problem where you have to figure out the cost of lunch, and see
how it works.
The Problem: You have a buy-one-get-one-free coupon from a local restaurant.
The coupon is good for the cheaper of the two lunches. The amount of that
meal is deducted after the tax is added. You and a friend go to lunch. You have
the $6.95 chef salad, and she has the $6.50 fruit plate (you’re both eating so
healthy). The tax comes to $1.08, and you want to leave a tip of $2.80. You’re
going to split the total cost of the lunch equally, so what will lunch cost you?
65
Chapter 5: Deciding On the Operation

Whew! It’s going to take several operations to solve this problem. You have to
add up all the costs, subtract the amount for the coupon, and then divide the
resulting amount by 2. You’ll use parentheses and brackets so that the correct
amount is divided by 2. Here’s what the problem looks like using the opera-
tions and grouping symbols:
[(6.95 + 6.50 + 1.08 + 2.80) – 6.50] ÷ 2
Even though parentheses are around all the addition, you can drop the paren-
theses and include the subtraction of 6.50 with that group. You want to do
this, because you get a 0 by cleverly adding and subtracting the same
number (+ 6.50 – 6.50). The new version of the problem is:
[6.95 + 1.08 + 2.80] ÷ 2 = [10.83] ÷ 2 = 5.415
You can’t split a penny in half, so your friend very generously offers to pay
the extra penny because you brought the coupon. You pay $5.41 and she
pays $5.42. (It doesn’t make sense to round up or down with that 1⁄2 of a cent,
because you’d be paying too little or too much if you both paid the same
amount after rounding.)
Determining which of the many
operations to use
Using the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division isn’t
all that taxing. It’s deciding when to use which operation — and how often. You
pick up on the word clues and try out something that makes sense. Check to
see if your answer is what you expected or is something very surprising.
Surprising isn’t bad, but it should make you go back to see if you’ve made
some sort of calculation error or if it’s just your estimate that was wrong.

Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 
Operating on the digits
I’m thinking of a number in which the second
digit is smaller than the first digit by 4. When you
divide the number by the sum of the digits, the
quotient is 7. What is the number I’m thinking of?
Answer: To do this, think of all the two-digit numbers where the second digit
is smaller than the first by 4. Those numbers are: 51, 62, 73, 84, and 95. (You
use subtraction to figure out those numbers.) Now use addition to get the
sums of the digits in the five numbers: 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14, respectively. Only
one of the two-digit numbers is evenly divisible by the sum of its digits —
the number 84 divided by 12 is 7. Now you know that my number is 84.

The following examples incorporate several operations in each, for your
perusal. The first problem uses multiplication and division.
The Problem: Ted can use a disposable razor six times before it gets too dull
to do a good job. He shaves twice on Saturday — to look his very best on
Saturday night. He buys the razors in packs of 10. Each pack of razors costs
$4.95. How much does Ted spend on razors every year?
First, you want to wade through all the information to get to the pertinent
facts. And, for a problem like this, make an estimate in your head. If he buys a
pack of razors every month (which is more than he needs) and spends $5 per
pack (rounding up to make the math easier), then that’s 12 × $5 = $60. You
know that the estimate is high, but it gives you a ballpark figure to aim at.
Now you need to determine how many shaves Ted has per year, divide that
number by 6 to get the number of razors, divide that number by 10 to get
the number of packs, and multiply the result by $4.95. Yes, you could divide
the number of shaves by 60 instead of doing two separate divisions, but I
want to show every step and not make big leaps.
Start with the number of shaves. You take the number of weeks in a year, 52,
and multiply that by 8. (Why 8? Because Ted shaves twice on Saturday, and
you add 1 to the number of days in a week.) So 52 × 8 = 416 shaves per year.
Divide the number of shaves by 6 (the number of shaves per razor), and you
get 416 ÷ 6 = 69 and a remainder of 2, which is the number of razors needed.
How do you handle the remainder in this case? (If you need help, see “Making
use of pesky remainders,” earlier in this chapter.) Because this is a number of
razors needed, and you can’t break apart a razor, you choose to round up to
70 razors. Now divide 70 by 10, the number of razors in a pack. Ted needs
70 ÷ 10 = 7 packs. At $4.95 per pack, that’s $4.95 × 7 = $34.65 per year for razors.
That’s much cheaper than going to the barber every day — and it’s much lower
than the estimate of $60. This doesn’t necessarily fit in the surprising category.
The estimate in these types of problems are especially useful if you make an
error in the decimal point. For instance, if you came out with an answer of
$346.50, you’d know that something was very wrong with your answer.
The next problem uses addition — with a tad of multiplication — and sub-
traction. You need to be careful about the grouping — keeping the additions
separate before subtracting.
The Problem: Twins Jake and Jill are always competing with each another.
They’re in the same math class and want to compare their quiz scores to see
who has done the best on quizzes. Jake’s scores are 19, 18, 17, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 20, and 20; Jill’s scores are 20, 20, 20, 20, 14, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20. Who has the
higher total, and by how much?
67
Chapter 5: Deciding On the Operation

You first want to total each person’s quizzes and take advantage of repeated
scores to cut down on the number of computations. By grouping and multi-
plying, Jake’s scores look like the following:
([2 × 19] + [2 × 18] + [2 × 17] + 16 + [3 × 20]) = (38 + 36 + 34 + 16 + 60) = 184
Now, grouping and multiplying Jill’s scores you get:
([5 × 20] + [2 × 14] + 13 + 15 + 16) = (100 + 28 + 13 + 15 + 16) = 172
It looks like Jake has the better total. You subtract 184 – 172 = 12, which
means that Jake’s score is better than Jill’s by 12 points.
This last problem uses addition, multiplication and division. Again, you have
to group the correct values and then do the division at the end.
The Problem: Five friends — Adam, Ben, Charlie, Duncan, and Eduardo —
have decided to work together on a project and then split up the proceeds
evenly. A neighbor has offered to pay them $6.50 per hour to paint the fence
around his pasture. (If you’ve never painted a fence — with all the surfaces
and nooks and crannies — you’ve never lived. Oh, yeah.) The boys were to
come when they could and report the number of hours that they spent paint-
ing. They’d all be paid at the end. Adam worked for 81⁄2 hours, Ben worked for
6 hours, Charlie worked for 91⁄4 hours, Duncan worked for 7 hours, and
Eduardo worked for 9 hours. How much did each boy make?
First, you need to total all the hours by adding them up. Then multiply the
number of hours by $6.50. Last, divide the total amount paid by 5 to get
each person’s share. Adding, 81⁄2 + 6 + 91⁄4 + 7 + 9 = 393⁄4 hours. Then multiply
393⁄4 × $6.50 and you get $258.375. Now, dividing the total by 5, you get
$258.375 ÷ 5 = $51.675, which rounds up to $51.68. That seemed like good
money to the boys, but I think that the neighbor made out pretty well, too.

Tricky arithmetic
Divide 30 by 1⁄2 and add 10. What is the answer?
Answer: Did you get 25? Gotcha! If that was your answer, then you divided 30
by 2 instead of 1⁄2. When you divide 30 by 1⁄2, you get 60. Adding 10 gives you
a final answer of 70.

D
ecimals and percents are really just fractions — in a more manageable
format. Doing problems that involve percents of things involves changing
the percents to decimals and then doing the indicated operations. That’s not a
big deal, if you handle the decimals correctly. And the computations are much
easier than with fractions, which can have very uncooperative denominators.
In this chapter, you see how to figure percent increase and percent decrease
and determine whether what you see advertised is a good deal. Everyone is
affected by interest on money — whether you’re borrowing or saving — so I
include problems dealing with computing interest as well.
Relating Fractions, Decimals,
and Percents
The usual move from fractions to percents is through decimals — the deci-
mal format is the middleman in the process. You probably already know
some of the more common equivalences of percents and fractions. You know
that 50 percent is equivalent to 1⁄2 and 25 percent is equivalent to 1⁄4. Well, I’m
assuming that you know this, but, just in case, here are some properties and
techniques that you can use to make the transitions easier. You don’t have to
memorize these properties, but having some of them in mind as you’re work-
ing on percentage problems is helpful.

Changing from fractions to decimals 
to percents
A decimal is a fraction and vice versa. To change a fraction to a percent, you
first determine the decimal value and then fiddle with the decimal point.
That’s all there’s to it — really.
To write a fraction as a decimal, you divide the numerator by the denomina-
tor, inserting the decimal point where needed. To change a decimal to a per-
cent, you move the decimal point two places to the right and use a percent
sign (%).
For instance, changing the fraction 16
7 to a percent, you first find the decimal 
by dividing the numerator, 7, by the denominator, 16. The decimal that you
get is 0.4375. Here’s what the division looks like:
.
.
16 7 0000
64
60
48
120
112
80
80
0 4375
g
To change the decimal to a percent, you move the decimal point two places
to the right to get 43.75 percent. This makes sense, because 7 is not quite half
of 16, and 43.75 percent is just short of half of 100 percent.
Finding terminating decimal values
Fractions all have decimal values, but some of these decimals terminate
(come to an end) and some repeat (never end). As long as the denominator
of the fraction is the product of 2s and 5s and nothing else, then the decimal
equivalent of the fraction will terminate. To find this terminating decimal, you
divide the denominator (bottom) of the fraction into the numerator (top) and
keep dividing until there’s no remainder. You may have to keep adding 0s in
the divisor for a while, but the division will end.
70
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

For example, to find the decimal equivalent for the fraction 25
14 , you divide 25 
into 14. To begin the division, you put a decimal point to the right of the 4
and add a 0 to the right of the decimal point. You keep adding 0s as needed in
the division. This is what I get when I do the division.

. As you see, this decimal terminates. The division stopped 
because I eventually ended up with no remainder. You can predict that this
will happen (the termination of the decimal), because the denominator, the
25, is equal to 5 times 5. The only factors of 25 are 5s.
Next, you see the division required to find the decimal equivalent of the 
fraction 160
9 . This decimal will terminate, too, because the denominator is 
equal to 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5. Only 2s and 5s are factors of the denominator. It
doesn’t matter what the numerator is; the decimal will terminate. Finding the
decimal equivalent:

Computing decimals that keep repeating themselves
Terminating decimals are just dandy, but they’re in no way the only type of
decimal value out there. Repeating decimals occur when you change a frac-
tion to a decimal and the denominator of the fraction has some factor other
than 2 or 5. It only takes one such factor to create the repeating situation. For 
71
Chapter 6: Improving Your Percentages

example, the fraction 12
5 repeats when you divide the numerator by the 
denominator, because the denominator has a factor of 3.

g
As you can see, the remainder will now forever be 8, and the corresponding
number in the quotient (answer of a division problem) will be 6. The three
dots following the last 6 shown indicates that the 6 keeps repeating forever
and ever.
To indicate a repeating decimal, you can either write three dots (ellipsis)
after some repeated digits, or you can draw a horizontal bar across the digits
that repeat. For instance, 0.41666 . . . can also be written .0 416. Note that the
bar is over the 6 only. The first two digits don’t repeat.
When you’re using repeating decimals in a problem, you decide how many
decimal places you want and then round the number to that approximate
value. Rounded decimals aren’t exactly the same value as the repeating deci-
mals, but you can make them pretty accurate in an application by using
enough digits in the decimal equivalent.
Making the switch from fractions to percents
The middle step in changing a fraction to a percent is finding the decimal
equivalent (or, in the case of a repeating decimal, the approximate). Table 6-1
shows you some fractions, their decimal value, and then the percent that you
get by moving the decimal point two places to the right.

Changing from percents back to fractions
Percents are very descriptive — they tell you how many you have out of 100
things. The only problem with percents is that you can’t use the percent
format when doing computations. You need to change a percent back to a
decimal or a fraction, if you want to multiply or divide using the percent.
To change a percent to a decimal number, move the decimal place in the per-
cent two places to the left, adding 0s if necessary. To change that decimal
number to a fraction, write the digits in the decimal over a power of 10 that
has as many zeros in it as there are digits in the decimal — then reduce the
fraction if you can.
For example, 45 percent has a decimal value of 0.45, and the fraction equiva-
lent is 100

Tackling Basic Percentage Problems
The nice thing about percents is that their values are easy to relate to. If
you’re 75 percent finished with a project, then you know that you’re well on
your way. You compare the percentage to 100 — a nice, round number — and
have a good idea of what the value is in the comparison. To be more exact
with an answer, though, you need to convert percentages to decimals and
create a more exact value to use in computations. Using the decimal equiva-
lents, you can solve for the percent of a value and get the answer in items, and
you can also solve for how many items are needed to reach a certain percent.
73
Chapter 6: Improving Your Percentages

Finding the percent amount
When you’re told that you have 60 percent of the work done or 85 percent of
the problems correct, you multiply the total number of hours needed to do
the work or the total number of problems on the test by the percent to get the
numerical value of what you’re discussing. Percents are convenient amounts
for comparison. You convert percents to decimals to use them in problems.
The Problem: You sign up for Weight Watchers, and you’re told that you need
to lose 10 percent of your current weight. If you weigh 160 pounds, how much
do you need to lose?
Changing 10 percent to a decimal, you get 0.10. Multiply 160 × 0.10 and you get
16 pounds. That should be a piece of cake. Oops! Not on Weight Watchers —
make that a carrot stick.
The Problem: You’re told that 95 out of 100 of the people who buy a Honda
motorcycle will buy another Honda when they need to buy another motorcy-
cle. Last year, the number of Honda motorcycles sold in North America was
570,000. How many of these owners will buy a Honda when they make their
next motorcycle purchase?
First, change the fraction 100
95 to a decimal. The value of 95 out of 100 is 95 
percent, but you can’t use the percentage in a computation — you want the
decimal value. This fraction is equal to 0.95, so 570,000 × 0.95 = 541,500 people
who will buy a Honda motorcycle the next time they make a purchase.
The Problem: To get an A in your math class, you need to have an average
of 92 percent of all the points available. You currently have 540 out of a
possible 600 points, and you still have the 200-point final to take. What do
you need to score on the final to get an A?
This problem involves several operations: addition, multiplication, and 
subtraction. First, determine the total number of points needed. Add 
600 + 200 for a total of 800 points. You need 92 percent of 800 points to
get an A, so multiply 0.92 × 800 = 736 points. You currently have 540 points.
Subtract 736 – 540 = 196. You need a score of 196 out of 200 points, which 
is

percent. You have your work cut out for you.
Finding the whole when given the percent
Working backward to find out where you get a certain percent amount
requires division instead of multiplication. This process of using division
makes sense, because multiplication and division are inverse operations —
one undoes the other.
The Problem: Forty-five percent of the class is boys. And you’re told that the
class has 18 boys in it. How many students are in the class?
74
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

Divide 18 by 45 percent — 18 ÷ 0.45 = 40. There are 40 students in the class.
You don’t believe this works so easily? Then check the work by finding 45
percent of 40 to see if you get 18 boys. Multiplying 0.45 × 40 = 18 boys. By
golly, it works!
The Problem: In a large bag of Skittles, 20 percent of the candy is colored
yellow and 18 percent is colored red. If you counted 100 yellow candies, then
how many are red?
First, determine how many pieces of candy there are altogether, and then
determine what 18 percent of that number is to find out how many are red.
You know that 20 percent of the candy corresponds to 100 pieces, so divide
100 by 20 percent — 100 ÷ 0.20 = 500 pieces of candy. Now multiply 500 times
18 percent, or 500 × 0.18 = 90 pieces of candy that are red in color.
Looking At Percent Increase
and Percent Decrease
You’ve been drawn to a store when it advertises “All Prices Slashed 20
Percent” or “Take 15 Percent Off the Reduced Price.” Who wouldn’t be
tempted when you’re offered such deals? And what about that meeting with
the boss when she says that you need to increase productivity by 25 percent?
Where does that put you as far as output? Can you do it? Percent decrease
and percent increase are both based on changing the amount from 100 per-
cent, or the full amount. You use the difference from 100 percent to help you
when doing the problems.
75
Chapter 6: Improving Your Percentages
Falling golf balls
Two large barrels contain the same amount of
water. The water temperature in the first barrel
is 49°F, and the temperature in the other is 29°F.
Two identical golf balls, positioned at the same
height above the two barrels, are dropped at
exactly the same time. Which ball will touch the
bottom of the barrel first?
Answer: Did you catch the temperature in the second barrel? Yes, the water
is frozen. The golf ball in the second barrel won’t touch bottom until spring,
when the ice melts. So the golf ball dropped into the barrel with 49°F water
will reach the bottom first.

Decreasing by percents
Figuring a percent decrease — or the new value of an item after the decrease
is applied — just takes a deep breath and a little common sense. You can get
messed up with the arithmetic if you don’t think about what the answer
should be ahead of time. In general, you multiply the total amount by the per-
cent to get the decrease in the amount. You can then subtract that decrease
from the original amount to get the new result. Another way of finding the
resulting amount is to subtract the percent decrease from 100 percent and
multiply this difference times the original amount.
To determine the net result or amount after applying a percent decrease, you
use one of the following methods (either one works):
 Total amount × percent decrease = decrease in amount
Total amount – decrease in amount = net result
 100 percent – percent decrease = decreased percent
Total amount × decreased percent = net result
The Problem: A local store is going out of business and has advertised that
all items are 60 percent off the original price. You buy a toaster oven that’s
currently marked $49.95. What will you pay for the toaster oven after the
store applies the discount?
Using the first method, earlier, you first multiply $49.95 × 0.60 = $29.97. This is
the amount of the decrease. Next, subtract $49.95 – $29.97 = $19.98. Wow!
Such a deal!
Now, using the second method, you subtract 100 percent – 60 percent = 40
percent. The item will cost 40 percent of the original cost. Taking $49.95 ×
0.40 = $19.98. You get the same answer, of course.
You’re pretty happy with your purchase of the toaster oven until, the next
day, you see that the same store is offering to reduce the previously reduced
price by another 20 percent. Does that mean that the new reduction is 80 per-
cent, or is the reduction 20 percent of the previous 60 percent? Is there even
a difference? Oh, yes, there is.
The Problem: What is the difference between an 80 percent decrease and a
60 percent decrease followed by a 20 percent decrease? For the sake of com-
parison, use an item that has an original cost of $100.
76
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

To see if there is a difference at all, do the computations two different ways:
Find the price after an 80 percent decrease. Then go back to the original price
and figure a 60 percent decrease followed by a 20 percent decrease.
Determining the cost of the item if there’s an 80 percent decrease in the price,
you subtract 100 percent – 80 percent, giving you a final cost of 20 percent of
$100. Multiplying 100 × 0.20 = $20. That’s the cost of the item with a straight
80 percent decrease.
Now, find the cost when there’s first a 60 percent decrease in cost followed
by a 20 percent decrease in that result — 100 percent – 60 percent = 40 per-
cent. Multiplying 100 × 0.40 = $40. A 20 percent decrease becomes 100 per-
cent – 20 percent = 80 percent. And, multiplying, $40 × 0.80 = $32. That’s quite
a bit different from the $20 when figured the other way.
Not that I’m beating up on this poor store that’s going out of business, but
here’s another scenario to consider when dealing with percent decreases.
Consider a less-than-scrupulous manager who advertises that prices are
going to be decreased by 60 percent off the original amount. What you don’t
know is that he changes all the prices the night before the big sale so that the
60 percent decreases result in the cost of the items all being the same as they
were the previous day. How does he do the necessary math?
The Problem: A store advertises a 60 percent decrease in cost on all items.
What does the price tag have to read so that an item costing $100 originally
will still cost $100 after the 60 percent decrease?
Go back to the same process of subtracting the 60 percent from 100 percent
to get a net cost of 40 percent. Then divide instead of multiplying to get the
required price. Dividing $100 ÷ 0.40 = $250. The price needed on the item is
$250. When you apply a 60 percent decrease to $250, you get back to the orig-
inal price of $100. Somehow, I think that the shoppers just may notice the
price hike.

Matching socks
You have 40 socks in a drawer in your bedroom.
The power is out, though, and you can’t see what
color the socks are. You know that 35 percent of
the socks are black and 65 percent of the socks
are blue. How many socks do you have to take
out of the drawer to be absolutely sure that you
have a matching pair of socks? You don’t care
which color, as long as they match.
Answer: You need to take just three socks out of the drawer. At least two of
them have to be the same color. Did the percentages throw you off? I was
hoping so.

Making the discount count
You’re going to take advantage of the end-of-year discounts being offered at
the local hardware store. You get a 25 percent discount on all items, but you
have to figure in the 8 percent sales tax.
The Problem: You have purchases totaling $75.45 and get to the checkout
counter. Your coupon says 25 percent off, but there’s an 8 percent sales tax,
so the clerk tells you that she’ll just subtract the 8 percent from the 25 per-
cent, leaving a 17 percent discount, which means that you pay 83 percent of
the total before all this magic arithmetic. Is this right?
You sense a shell game going on. The numbers are flashing through your
head like those visions of sugar plums. Take a deep breath, and do the com-
putations yourself. First, find the reduced cost, and then add the sales tax.
The discount is 25 percent off, so you’ll only be paying 75 percent of the
original price. (Refer to “Decreasing by Percents,” earlier in this chapter,
for more on figuring the discounted price.) Computing 75 percent of $75.45,
you get 0.75 × $75.45 = $56.5875 or $56.59. Now add on the 8 percent tax by
multiplying $56.59 times 108 percent. (This is the same as finding 8 percent
and adding that amount on to the price. See “Determining an increase with
percents,” later in this chapter, for more information on this process.) The
computation is 56.59 × 1.08 = $61.12. The tax was 8 percent of $56.59 or $4.53.
How does this compare to the clerk’s suggestion of just giving you a 17 per-
cent discount? Computing 83 percent of $75.45, you multiply 0.83 × $75.45 =
$62.6235. You would pay $62.62, which is $1.50 more than you should.
Determining an increase with percents
A percent increase may involve your goal in productivity or the amount of
rainfall one summer or the amount that a price is increased due to sales tax.
In general, to find the new amount after a percent increase, you either deter-
mine the increase in the amount that results from the percent increase and
add it to the original, or you add the percent increase to 100 percent and mul-
tiply by the new percentage.
To determine the net result or amount after applying a percent increase, you
use one of the following methods:
 Total amount × percent increase = increase in amount
Total amount + increase in amount = net result
 100 percent + percent increase = increased percent
Total amount × increased percent = net result

Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

The Problem: A sheep shearer figures that he can improve upon his average
per day shearing of 100 sheep. He’s set a goal of increasing the number of
sheep by 15 percent. How many sheep per day will he have to shear to make
that goal?
Using the first method, he first determines that 15 percent of 100 is 0.15 ×
100 = 15. Add 15 to the usual 100 sheep, and he sees that he needs to shear
115 sheep per day.
Using the second method, if the shearer adds 15 percent + 100 percent, he
gets 115 percent. Multiply 100 × 1.15, and he gets 115 sheep.
Percentages of more than 100 percent have decimal equivalents that are
greater than 1. Be careful when moving the decimal point. For instance, 250
percent = 2.5, 800 percent = 8 and 1,000 percent = 10.
Problems involving sales tax are pretty much just percent increase problems.
They get even more interesting when you figure in both a percent decrease
because of a sale price and also sales tax.
The Problem: You purchase new shoes that were advertised as being 25 per-
cent off the original price. You look at the sales receipt and don’t agree with
the total price. You suspect that the sales tax was computed on the original
price of the shoes, not the sale price. The shoes were originally $120, and the
sales tax is 81⁄4 percent. The amount you’re being asked to pay is $97.43. Is
this the correct amount?
First, figure out the new price due to the decrease. Then figure the increase in
price due to the sales tax. For the decrease in price, multiply the original cost
times 75 percent. If you need help in determining where the 75 percent came
from, go back to “Decreasing By Percents,” earlier in this chapter. After you
get the new, lower cost of the shoes, multiply that amount by 108.25 percent.
This percentage is the result of applying a percent increase and adding the
sales tax percentage to 100 percent.

Doubling up on amoebas
A jar contains seven amoebas. These particu-
lar amoebas multiply so fast (split into two) that
they double in volume every minute. If it takes
40 minutes for the amoebas to fill the jar (for it
to be 100 percent full), how long did it take to fill
half the jar (50 percent full)?
Answer: Did you say 20 minutes? Nope. Higher. It would take 39 minutes for
the jar to be half full, and then, because they double in 1 minute, they’d fill the
jar in that next minute.

The new price of the shoes is $120 × 0.75 = $90. Now, to figure the total cost
with tax, take $90 × 1.0825 = 97.425. The amount on the bill is correct, when
you round up to the higher penny. No error was made here. If the tax had
been figured on the original amount, the total would have been $99.90. I get
this amount by figuring the tax on $120 to be $120 × 0.0825 = $9.90 and adding
that tax to the reduced price of the shoes. It doesn’t hurt to check — errors
easily can be made when figuring discounted prices and taxes.
Tipping the Waitress without
Tipping Your Hand
Did you know that the word tip is an acronym for To Insure Promptness? The
word tip may not have started out to stand for those words, but it does seem
to fit the situation. Waiters and waitresses are at your mercy when it comes
to tipping them properly, so you want to be able to compute their payment
with a minimum of hassle and struggle — and do it accurately. Sometimes the
restaurant makes it easy for you and adds on a 15 percent tip. Also, if you
charge the meal, you’re given a nice slip of paper to do your addition on — if
you know how much you want to tip. A bit of a problem arises when you use
a discount coupon. All these things have to be taken into consideration —
and I walk you through them all in this section.
Figuring the tip on your bill
Even when the service is questionable, most people leave a tip. The amount
can serve to indicate to the waiter just what you think of the service. The
most commonly used tip percentages are 10 percent, 15 percent, and 20 per-
cent. The first and last are fairly easy to compute. But 15 percent, is a bit of a
challenge.
Adding on 10 percent or 20 percent
To figure a tip of 10 percent — which means that you aren’t particularly
impressed with the waiter’s work — all you need do is take the total and
move the decimal point one place.
Multiplying by 10 percent is accomplished by moving the decimal point one
place to the left. If you multiply 48 × 10 percent this is 48 × 0.10 = 4.80 or 4.8.
80
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

The Problem: How much tip do you leave if you’re going to pay 10 percent on
a bill of $18.80? And what is the total payment after adding the tip?
Move the decimal in $18.80 one place to the left to get $1.88. Add $18.80 +
$1.88 to get a total of $20.68.
To figure a 20 percent tip, all you do is figure the 10 percent tip and double it.
You can do this by either doubling the cost and then moving the decimal
point, or you can figure the 10 percent amount by moving the decimal and
then doubling that amount for the tip.
The Problem: How much tip will you give the hairdresser if the charge for a
haircut and perm is $85 and you want to give a 20 percent tip?
When you’re moving the decimal point in 85 one place to the left, you have to
remember that there is a decimal point in the number. The decimal point is
always assumed to be at the far right of the number, if it isn’t showing. So one
place to the left gives you 8.5 — which is $8.50. Double that to get $17. Add
that tip to the bill for a total of $85 + $17 = $102.
Computing a 15 percent tip
Multiplying a number by 15 isn’t the hardest thing to do, but it isn’t quite as
sweet as multiplying by 10 or 20. So it won’t come as a shock to find that fig-
uring a 15 percent tip is a bit more involved than figuring a 10 percent or 20
percent tip.
81
Chapter 6: Improving Your Percentages
Figuring the tip in your head
When you’re in a situation where you’re going
to give only a 10 percent tip (and I hope that the
situation doesn’t come up very often), you can
do a quick, neat calculation in your head to find
the total amount — the tip plus the charge for
the meal. This little method works because it’s
a quick computation used to multiply any
number by 11.
The method you use is to picture a 0 in front of
the meal cost and add the adjacent digits
together. If any of the pairs add up to more than
9, you’ll have to carry 1 to the next sum. For
example, if your bill is $45.32, then picture in
your mind 045.32. Start on the right end and add
2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8, 5 + 4 = 9 and 4 + 0 = 4. Write
these sums in reverse order, with the decimal
point in the correct place, and you get 49.85 —
the sum of the meal plus a 10 percent tip. This
calculation is going to be off by a penny if the
last digit in the meal cost is bigger than 5 —
because of the rounding. But, for a quick com-
putation, it works pretty well.

The simplest approach is just to multiply the amount by 15 percent and be
done with it.
The Problem: How much do you tip the waiter if the bill is $164, and you’re
going to tip 15 percent? What is the total bill after the tip is added?
Multiply 164 × 15 percent = 164 × 0.15 = $24.60. So, adding $164 + $24.60, you
get a total of $188.60 for the bill.
If you like to figure out the tip in her head, there’s a trick to computing the
amount of the tip when you want to leave a tip of 15 percent. First figure the
10 percent tip by moving the decimal point one place to the left. Then take
half of that tip and add it on to the whole tip. There’s your 15 percent tip —
10 percent and half of 10 percent.
The Problem: You’ve gone to lunch with nine of your friends and you’ve all
agreed to just split the whole bill equally — ten ways — and leave a 15 per-
cent tip. You’re in charge of collecting everyone’s money and then settling up
at the cash register. The charge for the ten lunches is $188. How much will
each person give you for her share?
You first have to figure the tip, add it on to the cost of the meal, and then divide
the total by 10. You’re going to do this in your head — and hope you can do it
correctly, or you’re going to get stuck with any shortfall. A 15 percent tip is 10
percent plus half of 10 percent, so it’s $18.80 + $9.40 = $28.20. Add the tip to the
bill to get $188 + $28.20 = $216.20. To divide that by 10, you just have to move
the decimal point again and get that everyone’s share is $21.62. Of course, what
are the chances that everyone will have the correct change? Oh, sure.
Taking into account the discount
Everyone just loves those buy-one-get-one-free coupons or the percentage off
the total discounts. These promotions get you in the door and are good for
everyone involved. Sometimes you have to pay tax on the amount before the
discount, and sometimes you pay tax on the lesser amount. It depends on
what the product is — and if the merchant knows how to figure it correctly.
That’s why you need to be aware of what’s going on so you can check the
computations.
The Problem: Your favorite restaurant is offering a free second entree, as long
as it costs less than the entree you’re paying for. This is how most of the buy-
one-get-one-free promotions work. You’ll pay tax on the reduced price, but you
need to tip the waitress based on the total cost before the discount. Your
entree costs $19.95, and your friend’s entree costs $21.95. You’ve ordered bev-
erages totaling $16 and shared an appetizer that costs $6.95. The tax (sales
plus restaurant tax) comes to 10.5 percent, and you want to give a 20 percent
tip. You and your friend will split the bill. How much will each of you pay?
82
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

You’re going to pay tax on all the items except the less-pricey meal, so add up
all the items — food and beverages — except the $19.95 and compute the tax
on that. You’re going to figure the tip on all the items except the tax, so you’ll
need a different sum to do that computation. Last, you’ll add up the cost of
the items you’re paying for, the tax, and the tip. Divide that total by 2, and
you’ll have the amount that each of you owes.
First, computing the tax, add $21.95 + $16 + $6.95 = $44.90. The tax on that is
$44.90 × 10.5 percent = 44.90 × 0.105 = $4.7145, making the tax $4.71.
Next, to compute the tip, add up the cost of all the items, $19.95 + $21.95 +
$16 + $6.95 = $64.85. Multiplying $64.85 × 20 percent = 64.85 × 0.20 = $12.97.
Your total cost is the cost of the meals plus the tax plus the tip. Add $44.90 +
$4.71 + $12.97 = $62.58. Divide that by 2, and each of you owes $31.29. Now, I
know that in practice, most people would round the tip up to $13, but that
doesn’t really change the amount by much.
KISS: Keeping It Simple, Silly —
with Simple Interest
Simple interest is the interest computed when compounding doesn’t occur.
The interest in a savings account compounds, because, if you don’t withdraw
any of the money you’ve invested, your interest earns interest. With com-
pound interest, the amount of interest earned is added to the account total,
and then the new interest is figured on the new total. Simple interest is com-
puted only on the beginning amount.
The formula for simple interest is I = prt, where I is the amount of interest
earned, p is the principal or amount of money involved, r is the interest rate
(a percent changed to a decimal for the computation), and t is the amount of
time involved — usually a number of years.
Determining how much
interest you’ve earned
Problems involving interest are two types: interest earned, and interest you
have to pay. The interest earned is the more-fun type. You get to add money
to your savings account without even working at it.
The Problem: How much simple interest is earned on $10,000 if this money is
deposited for 6 years in an account that earns 41⁄4 percent interest?
83
Chapter 6: Improving Your Percentages

Using the formula for simple interest and replacing the letters with their cor-
responding values, you get I = $10,000 × 0.0425 × 6 = 2,550. You earn $2,550 in
interest, so now the total in the account is $12,550.
The Problem: How much simple interest is earned on $10,000 if you have it in
one account for 61⁄2 years at 4 percent interest and then move that money and
the interest it’s earned to another account earning 6 percent interest for
another 31⁄2 years?
To determine the total amount of interest earned, you have to add the two
different interest amounts. One amount comes from the interest earned at 4
percent, and the other amount comes from the interest earned at 6 percent.
Apply the simple-interest formula on $10,000 at 4 percent for 61⁄2 years with 
I = 10,000 × 0.04 × 6.5 = $2,600.
Next, apply the simple-interest formula on $12,600 at 6 percent for 31⁄2 years.
Why is the amount of money different? Because the total amount from the
first 61⁄2 years, the principal plus interest, is all deposited in the new account.
You get I = $12,600 × 0.06 × 3.5 = $2,646.
Now, to answer the question, “How much interest is earned?”, you add the
two interest values together — $2,600 + $2,646 = $5,246.
Figuring out how much you need to invest
The simple-interest formula, I = prt, gives you the amount that your money
has earned for you over a particular period of time. You have a set number of
dollars and invest it for a chosen number of years. Of course, the longer you
invest the money, the more interest you’ll earn. Another situation is that you
may have a target amount of interest or a target total of money, and you need
to know how much to invest right now to reach that target. For example, you
may want to set up an account (usually called an endowment) where only the
interest is spent each year while the amount in the account stays the same
and is never withdrawn. Or you may want to have a particular total amount
of money to buy a boat in ten years and need to make a deposit today so that
the money in the account will grow to that target amount over the years.
Spending only the interest
A benefactor wants to donate money to a local charity but doesn’t want the
charity to spend it. How does this help the charity? The arrangement is that
the charity gets to spend only the interest, every year, and the amount in the
account stays there to earn interest the next year and the next and so on.
84
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

The Problem: How much money must be invested in an account that earns 5
percent simple interest per year if the interest must come out to be $6,000?
Use the simple-interest formula, I = prt, replacing the letters with the corre-
sponding values in the problem. You’ll be solving for p, the principal. The
equation becomes: $6,000 = p × 0.05 × 1 or $6,000 = 0.05p. Divide each side of
the equation by 0.05 to get p = $120,000. The person donating the money
needs to put $120,000 in the account for there to be $6,000 of spendable
money (or interest) each year.
Aiming at a future purchase
You have your eye on a new powerboat — one that seats up to 12 people and
moves fast enough to pull a skier. You figure that the boat you want will cost
close to $100,000 when you’re ready to buy it. You’re going to put away a
lump sum of money today, and let it grow in value for ten years — at which
time you’ll take all the money and the interest to buy the boat.
The Problem: How much money do you have to deposit in an account earn-
ing 8 percent simple interest if you want to have a total of $100,000 in princi-
pal and interest in ten years?
If you use the simple-interest formula, I = prt, you’ll get varying amounts of
interest, depending on what the principal is. What you want is for the princi-
pal, p, and the interest, prt, to have a total of $100,000. Your equation would
look like: p + prt = $100,000. You can solve for the principal by dividing the
$100,000 by 1 + rt. Just add 1 to the product of the rate times the time and
divide that into the $100,000. You’ll be dividing $100,000 by 1 + (0.08 × 10),
which is: $100,000 ÷ 1.8 = $55,555.56. Actually, the money grows even faster if
you use compound interest, but this is pretty impressive just as it is here.

Inheriting a fortune
A sheikh had two sons who were equally likely
to inherit his position and his fortune. He
devised a contest to see which son would be his
successor. In this contest, the two sons would
race their camels to a distant city. The winner
would be the one whose camel was slower!
The sons started the race and wandered about
aimlessly for several days; neither wanted to be
the first to the city, because each wanted his
camel to be the slower one. They happened
upon a wise man and asked him for advice on
how they could finish this contest. The wise
man gave it his best. After hearing what he had
to say, the two sons jumped on the camels and
raced as fast as they could to the city. What did
the wise man tell them?
Answer: The wise man told each son to ride the other son’s camel.

Working out the payments
Many people use credit cards to pay for large purchases, but some stores still
offer convenient short-term payment plans on their merchandise. If you want
to buy an item, the store figures out the total cost of the item plus the inter-
est over a period of time, divides the total into equal payments, and then lets
you purchase the item paying back the same amount for a certain number of
months or years.
The Problem: You want to buy an all-leather sectional sofa that costs $3,500.
The store will let you pay for it over the next 36 months at 9 percent interest.
How much will your monthly payment be if you’re going to be paying for the
sofa and three years’ simple interest in equal monthly payments?
Figure out the interest on $3,500 at 9 percent for 3 years. Add the interest to the
cost of the sofa and divide the total by 36. The interest is $3,500 × 0.09 × 3 =
$945. Add $3,500 + $945 to get $4,445. Divide $4,445 ÷ 36 = $123.47222. . . . You
can’t just lop off the remainder. The 0.00222 . . . represents a remainder of 8
cents in the division, so you’ll pay $123.48 for 8 months and $123.47 for the
other 28 months.
How do you get the 8¢ remainder? You multiply $123.47 by 36, and you get
$4444.92, which is 8¢ short of the total. Long division gives you a remainder
of 8¢. Calculators give you the decimal. And, if you’re so lucky, you have a
graphing calculator that changes decimals into fractions automatically.

roportions are nothing more than two ratios or fractions set equal to
one another. Proportions have several very handy properties that make
working with them much easier to manage. In this chapter, you see how to
set up the proportions correctly and how to solve the problems you’ve cre-
ated with the proportions. You see how to apply the properties of propor-
tions to make the solutions easier.
Working with the Math of Proportions
A proportion is an equation involving two fractions. The ratio of the numera-
tors and denominators of the fractions must be equal. A proportion is a state-
ment saying that two fractions are equivalent or equal in value. The fractions
can be reduced in the normal way — the way you’ve see since third grade —
and they can be reduced in some rather unique ways, too. You use this prop-
erty and several others to solve for unknown parts of a proportion.

Solving proportions by multiplying 
or flipping
Equations involving proportions are solved using the properties of propor-
tions. When you cross-multiply, you get rid of the fraction format, which gives
you an equation that is usually simpler to deal with. Also, if you flip the pro-
portion, you make the problem more to your liking — easier to solve.

Flipping your lid over a proportion
Even though cross-multiplying is a great tool to use when solving propor-
tions, you can often take an easier route: Flip the fractions (set the reciprocals
equal to one another) and then multiply each side by the same number to
solve the equation. For example, in the following equation, I flip the propor-
tion and then just have to multiply each side by the number under the x,
reduce, and get the answer.

Going every which way with reducing
Reducing fractions in proportions is a blast! You can reduce across the tops,
across the bottoms, up and down on the left, or up and down on the right.
You just can’t reduce going diagonally — the crisscross motion is for multi-
plying only. By reducing the proportion, first, before cross-multiplying, you
get to work with smaller numbers. That’s a good idea not only for the ease of
the problem, but also because it helps prevent errors.
88
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

Reducing vertically
Proportions are created from fractions, and the traditional way of reducing
fractions is to find a number that divides the numerator and denominator
evenly and divide each part of the fraction by that number. Reducing frac-
tions is sometimes referred to as cancelling. In the following proportion, the
numbers in the fraction on the left are each divisible by 5. After reducing
the fraction on the left, you can cross-multiply and solve the equation for x.

You could also have reduced horizontally in this equation, because 8 and 16
are both divisible by 8. The next section shows you how that works.
Reducing horizontally
The property of proportions that allows you to cross-multiply and have a
true statement is the same property that allows for reducing across the pro-
portion horizontally. Both of these clever tools are due to the commutative
property of multiplication — the fact that reversing the order of the numbers
in a multiplication property doesn’t change the answer. It’s just neat that this
property comes in so handy when working with proportions. In the following
proportion, the two numerators are each divisible by 11. Then you see that
the two numbers in the right fraction are divisible by 7. Reduce that fraction
so that, when you cross-multiply, you don’t have to multiply by 63.

Chapter 7: Making Things Proportional

Dividing Things Up Equitably
Everyone should play fair. Whether it’s in basketball or a card game, you
expect to be treated fairly. The same can be said for sharing candy or money or
time. If everyone gets an equal share (all the same amount), then the computa-
tion is easy — you just divide by the number of people who are involved. It
gets a little more complicated when the shares are to be unequally divided, like
someone getting twice as much as another because she did twice the work.
Splitting things between two people
unevenly
If two children are to share equally in an inheritance, you just divide the total
amount by two. It gets a bit stickier when one person gets more than the
other. It strains the family relationship and the mathematics.
The Problem: Henry and Hilda are to share their father’s $2.5 million estate.
Their father said that Henry is to get 65 percent of the estate and Hilda is to
get the other 35 percent. How much does Henry get?

Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 
Dividing $17
Sneaky Pete thought that he could pull one over
on his buddies and keep all the money that was
paid to all of them for taking care of the neigh-
bor’s dog. The neighbor gave Pete $17 and told
him to divvy it up according to how much time
each friend spent taking care of the dog. Pete
took the money and posed this problem: “In my
hand, I have $17. Tom can have one-ninth of the
money, because he worked one-ninth of the
time. Tim can have one-third of the money,
because he worked one-third of the time. And
Ted can have one-half of the money, because
he worked half of the time. You aren’t allowed to
tear any of the dollar bills, and there’s no
change. If you can’t figure out how to divide up
the $17, then I’ll just keep it all.” Pete’s buddies
were just too smart for him and divided up the
money equitably. How did they do it?
Answer: Tom had a dollar in his pocket and added it to the $17, making the
amount $18. One-ninth of eighteen is 2; one-third of eighteen is 6; and one-
half of eighteen is 9. The sum of 2 + 6 + 9 = 17. Tom took $2, gave Tim $6, and
Ted $9; then Tom then took the extra dollar he’d put in the pot. Sorry, Pete.

Using proportions, think of Henry’s 65 percent as being 65 out of 100, where
100 is the total amount. Write the proportion with x being the unknown 
amount out of $2.5 million. The proportion is 
,
,
x
100
65
2 500 000
=
. The propor-
tion says that 65 out of 100 is equal to some unknown value out of 2,500,000
(2.5 million).
When writing proportions, put related amounts either horizontally or verti-
cally from one another. Units that are alike should be either across from one
another or above and below one another.
In the problem, the units that are related are the $2,500,000, which is all of the
inheritance and the 100 which represents 100 percent or all. The x and the 65
each represent a part of the whole thing. To solve the proportion and deter-
mine Henry’s share, first reduce across the bottom of the proportion, and
then cross-multiply and solve for x.

Henry gets $1,625,000 of the $2.5 million in their father’s estate.
Figuring each person’s share
Another possible scenario when dividing things up is that three or more
people are involved, and they each get a different share or fraction of the
total amount. A situation like this occurs when people do different amounts
of the total work or when they are different ages or different weights or what-
ever makes them different from one another.
The proportion or proportions used to solve problems where three or more
people get differing shares all have a common theme. You’re always concerned
with the total amount — and all the parts must add up to the total amount.
If a pie is to be divided among four people, and the shares are one-twelfth,
one-sixth, one-fourth, and one-half of the pie, you have to be sure that these
fractions all add up to 1 — which is the whole pie.

Chapter 7: Making Things Proportional

Consider a situation where contestants share in the total prize depending on
the number of points that they’ve scored.
The Problem: In a fishing tournament, a sports-equipment company has
offered a prize of $100,000 to be divided among the top five winners in pro-
portion to their scores. The points earned by the top five winners are: 60, 40,
30, 20, and 10. How much money does each get?
Determine the total number of points, and then figure out the proportion or
part of the prize that each gets. The total number of points is: 60 + 40 + 30 +
20 + 10 = 160 points.

Comparing the proportions for differing
amounts of money
Some very interesting problems occur when an estate is divided up between
all the heirs. And then there’s the executor’s share to be considered in the
mix. Proportions are very handy when you’re determining who gets how
much money.
92
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

The Problem: A woman’s estate totals $5 million. She leaves 1⁄20 of her estate to
her butler, 3⁄20 to her chauffer, 1⁄10 to her daughter, 1⁄4 to her son, and 9⁄20 is to be put
in a trust to take care of her dog, Puddles. But all these bequests aren’t to be
made until after the executor of her will gets 10 percent of the original amount.
The others get their share of the net amount. How much does each person get?
You first deduct the amount that the executor gets. Because she gets 10 per-
cent of the estate, you multiply $5,000,000 × 0.10 = $500,000. Subtract that
from the estate, and it leaves $4,500,000 to be divided among the others. The
other shares are determined using proportions, letting the fractional share be
one side of the proportion and an x divided by $4,500,000 be the other side of
the proportion. The value of x in each case is that person’s share.

Chapter 7: Making Things Proportional
Diophantus’s life
Diophantus was a Greek mathematician who
had an impact on algebra back in the day. A
puzzle that’s attributed to his life goes:
“Diophantus’s boyhood lasted for one-sixth of
his life. He married after one-seventh more. His
beard grew after one-twelfth more of his life,
and his son was born 5 years later. The son lived
to half his father’s age, and Diophantus died four
years after the son. How long did Diophantus
live?
Answer: Diophantus lived for 84 years. His boyhood lasted for 14 years, he
married at 26, which was 12 years, or one-seventh, more. His beard grew
after 7 more years, when he was 33, and his son was born 5 years later,
when he was 38. His son died at 42, when Diophantus was 80. And
Diophantus died four years later, at 84. The simplest way to do this problem
is to find a number divisible by 6, 7, and 12, because fractions with those
denominators are used in the problem. The smallest number divisible by all
those numbers is 84.

Comparing Apples and Oranges
One of the nicest things about proportions is that they can be used to solve
problems involving items that don’t seem to have anything in common
except for their ratios to one another. For instance, if you’re told that three
apples can be traded for four oranges, then you can figure out how many
apples you can get for 28 oranges by using a proportion.
The Problem: How many apples can you trade for your 28 oranges if the cur-
rent trading rate is that three apples are worth four oranges?
Write the apples over the oranges in one fraction, and then put the 28
oranges on the bottom of the other fraction — opposite the oranges in the
first fraction. Let the unknown number of apples be represented by x.
x

It takes 21 apples to get 28 oranges. As long as you have apples across from
apples and oranges across from oranges, the proportion will work. Another
format for this is to have apples over apples and oranges over oranges, with
the equivalence of 3 and 4 across from one another. (Refer to “Working with
the Math of Proportions,” earlier in this chapter, if you need help with the
manipulations of proportions.)
Determining the amounts in recipes
If you’re a cook — or even if you don’t have much interest in the culinary
arts — you’re apt to come across a situation where you need to double a
recipe for a bigger crowd, halve a recipe that makes too much food, or com-
pute some such multiple or part of a recipe. Even if the recipe is for cement,
getting the amounts correct is important. Otherwise, the chili will taste too
salty or the cake won’t rise or the cement will never harden. Proportions are
a huge help with these recipe challenges.
The Problem: Your favorite chili recipe calls for 2 pounds of hamburger and
3 onions. You’re going to make enough chili for your whole fraternity and
plan to use 28 pounds of hamburger. How many onions do you need?
94
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

Set up a proportion with pounds of hamburger divided by number of onions
in one fraction and pounds of hamburger divided by onions in the other frac-
tion. Place an x for the unknown number of onions. Be sure to put the 28
pounds of hamburger in the same fraction as the x number of onions.

Solving this proportion is easier if you reduce across the top by dividing each
numerator by 2. Then flip the proportion before cross-multiplying. (Refer to
“Working with the Math of Proportions,” earlier in this chapter, if you need a
refresher on these techniques.)

You will need 42 onions. I feel a crying session coming on.
I inherited my grandmother’s recipe box, and there are some wonderful, old
recipes in it. One of my favorites (just because I’m trying to imagine my very
proper grandmother, Marion Jones Roby Ingersoll, making this much food) is
for sausage. The recipe calls for 100 pounds of pork, 1⁄4 pound of sage, 1⁄4
pound of pepper, 2 pounds of salt, 1 tablespoon of mustard and a “little”
summer savory. The recipe says to put the stuff in a crock by layers and
“weigh it down.”
The Problem: I want to try my grandmother’s recipe, but not in that huge
quantity. If I start with 5 pounds of pork instead of 100, how much sage and
mustard will I need?
Even though the quantities are in pounds and tablespoons, I can still use pro-
portions to solve for the amounts needed. Write a proportion with the origi-
nal number of pounds of pork and sage in the numerator and denominator of
the first fraction, and then write the 5 pounds of pork in the other fraction
across from the 100 pounds. Solve for the reduced pounds of sage. Do the
same thing with the original measures to solve for the amount of mustard.

When I divided each side by 20, I got 1⁄80 pound of sage. It makes more sense to
change the fraction of a pound to ounces. If there are 16 ounces in a pound,
then multiply 16 × 1⁄80 pound to get 1⁄5 ounce. And now, for the mustard, write a
new proportion and solve it.

Figuring out weighted averages
Weighted averages are used to give more importance or emphasis to one
thing than another. A prime example of weighted averages is when they’re
used to determine your grade in a college course. The weighting can go
something like this: Tests count three times as much as papers, the final
exam counts twice as much as a test, and attendance counts one-fourth as
much as a paper. In general, to find a weighted average, you set up a propor-
tion and multiply the weights times their respective amounts. Look at these
next two problems, and you’ll see what I mean.
The Problem: An Astrodollars Coffee shop sells several different types of
whole coffee beans. Last Monday they sold 100 pounds of Honduran coffee
beans, 70 pounds of Guatemalan coffee beans, 40 pounds of Nicaraguan
coffee beans, and 40 pounds of Chilean coffee beans. The Honduran beans
cost $8 per pound, the Guatemalan beans cost $9 per pound, the Nicaraguan
beans cost $10.50 per pound, and the Chilean beans cost $13.50 per pound.
What was the average cost per pound of the coffee beans sold on Monday?
Set up a proportion where each poundage multiplies its respective price. Put
the sum of all the products you get in the numerator of a fraction, and divide
by the total number of pounds. That’s one side of the proportion. Set that
fraction equal to another fraction with a 1 in the denominator (opposite the
total number of pounds) and an x in the numerator.

Truck on a bridge
A large truck is crossing a bridge that measures
1 mile in length. The bridge can only hold 14,000
pounds, which happens to be the exact weight
of the truck and all its cargo. The truck makes it
halfway across the bridge and stops. A bird
lands on the truck. Does the bridge collapse?
Answer: No, not to worry. The truck has driven half a mile and has used up
a goodly amount of fuel. You can subtract the weight of the fuel, and the bird
can land safely.

A college grade point average (GPA) is usually a weighted average. Different
courses are a different number of hours or quarters or other units, which
serve to determine their relative worth. Consider a student who attends a
college that measures courses in semester hours and uses grades of A, B, C,
D, and F. The corresponding point values for the grades are: 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0
points.
The Problem: Nick took five courses last semester and needs to determine
his GPA. He got an A in his 4-semester-hour calculus course, an A in his 1-
semester-hour computer course, a B in his 5-semester-hour biology course, a
C in his 3-semester-hour English course, and a B in his 3-semester-hour
Spanish course. What is his GPA for the semester?
Multiply each number of semester hours by its worth in terms of points for
that grade, and add up all the points; divide by the total number of semester
hours. Set that fraction equal to x divided by 1.

Chapter 7: Making Things Proportional

Computing Medicinal Doses
Using Proportions
Modern medicine offers many wonderful options to reduce pain and suffer-
ing. The amount of the medication for a particular person has to be correct,
though. The amount of medicine prescribed may depend on a person’s
weight, age, or current health status — or, often, a mixture of all these things.
Proportions are used to determine dosages of many medications and the
number of tablets needed per dose.
Figuring the tablets for doses
A scored tablet is a medicine tablet that is designed so that it can be broken
into halves or quarters, making it possible to administer a dose that is less
than the amount in the tablet. For purposes of these problems, assume that
the tablets are scored into quarters. (You can break the tablet into four equal
pieces.)
The Problem: A doctor prescribes 0.375 mg of Digoxin, and the scored
tablets that are available contain 0.25 mg each. How many tablets should be
administered?
Set up a proportion with the amount per tablet in one fraction and the
needed dosage and number of tablets in the other fraction.

The patient needs 11⁄2 tablets.
The Problem: A patient is to take 0.5 g of Ampicillin, and the capsules avail-
able are 250 mg. How many capsules are needed?
From the metric system: 1 gram = 1,000 milligrams or 1 g = 1,000 mg.
98
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

Change the 0.5 grams to milligrams using a proportion with 1 gram over
1,000 milligrams in one fraction and 0.5 grams over x milligrams in the other
fraction. Solve for x.

So 0.5 g = 500 mg. If the patient is to take 500 mg of Ampicillin, and the cap-
sules are 250 mg, then the patient will need two capsules.
Making the weight count
A person’s weight can affect the dosage of the medication they’re given. You
use a proportion to determine the amount of medication based on that weight.
The Problem: Robert has been taking 80 mg of a medication every day. When
it was prescribed, he weighed 170 pounds. He’s lost 30 pounds, so how much
should the new dosage be?
Create a proportion with 80 mg and 170 pounds in one fraction and 140
pounds in the other fraction. The 140 is found by subtracting 170 – 30 to
determine Robert’s new weight. Be sure to put the 140 pounds opposite the
170 pounds in the proportion.

Reduce either vertically in the left fraction or horizontally across the bottom.
Then cross-multiply and solve for x.

Figuring the Probability and Odds
In This Chapter
 Covering the mathematics of probability computations
 Computing the probabilities of desired outcomes
 Figuring the odds
T
he concept of probability is all around us. You can’t turn on the TV or
radio or pick up a newspaper or magazine without hearing or reading
about the probability of some event. From predicting the probability of a 
hurricane hitting land to declaring the odds that a horse will win the
Kentucky Derby, predictions are rampant. The predictions themselves
may not be correct, but probability isn’t a for sure, it’s just a probably.
This chapter starts out by showing you how to do the computations needed
for solving probability problems. (If you need a more thorough review of the
relationships between fractions, decimals, and percents, and how to change
from one to another, refer to Chapter 5.) In this chapter, you use the percent-
ages to make the predictions. And you see what the odds are that you’ll just
love this topic.
Defining and Computing Probability
The probability of an event is the likelihood that it’ll happen. The most common
way to express a probability is with a percent, such as 60 percent probability of
rain or 70 percent likelihood that he’ll hit the ball. Probability is also expressed
in terms of fractions — in fact, a fraction supplies one of the nicest ways of
defining how you get the probability of something happening.
When the probability of something happening is 95 percent, you can be pretty
sure that the event will happen — 95 out of 100 times it does. A probability of
15 percent is pretty low. That sounds like the chance that I’ll make a free throw
in basketball.

Counting up parts of things for probability
Following is a standard version of a probability formula. This formula allows
for you to count up how many different ways something can be done and
then determine the probability that just a few of those things will happen.
The probability, P, that an event, e, will happen is found with:
P e
e
total number of ways all events can happen
number of ways event
can happen

For example, consider a jar of marbles and the probability that you’ll pick a
red one. Or you look at the seats in an airplane and determine the probability
of your getting a particular seat. Or how about the number of boys in a family?
How does a number of boys become a probability problem? (Well, boys can be
a problem — I don’t know about the probability part.)
Dealing with a jar that contains 10 red, 20 yellow, 
and 50 green marbles
Picture a jar containing marbles and a task of drawing a marble out of the jar.
You have your eyes blindfolded, and you can’t tell the difference between the
marbles by feeling them — they’re all the same size.
The Problem: What is the probability that you get a green marble when you
choose a marble at random out of the jar that contains 10 red, 20 yellow, and
50 green marbles?
Make a fraction that has the number of green marbles in the numerator and
the total number of marbles in the denominator. Then reduce the fraction
and write your final answer as a percent. (Go to Chapter 5 if you need help
changing a fraction to a percent.)

A probability of 62.5 percent isn’t particularly high, but it’s better than half. If
you had to guess which color marble you might draw at random, you’d pick
the green marble, because it has the highest probability (more greens than
any other color).
The Problem: What is the probability that you’ll choose a marble at random
and that it’s not green if the jar contains 10 red, 20 yellow, and 50 green 
marbles?
102
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

You have two ways of doing this. The first is to find the number of marbles
that are not green and divide by the total number of marbles.

Even adding the red and yellow marbles together, you still have a better
chance of drawing a green marble. The other way of solving a probability
problem that has a not in it is to subtract from 100 percent.
The probability than an event, e, will not occur is 100 percent minus the prob-
ability that it will occur. P(not e) = 100 percent −P(e).
So, to solve for the probability that the marble is not green, you take the
probability that it is green and subtract that from 100 percent. Subtracting,
you get 100 percent −62.5 percent = 37.5 percent.
The Problem: You have a jar that contains 10 red, 20 yellow, and 50 green
marbles, and you take a marble out of the jar and put it in your right pocket
without looking at the color. Now you draw another marble out of the same
jar and put it in your left pocket. What is the probability that both marbles
are red?
Right away, you should be thinking about how unlikely the probability is that
both marbles are red. The red marbles are the fewest in the jar. The probabil-
ity should be pretty low. To do the problem, first find the probability of draw-
ing a red marble out of the 80 marbles, and then find the probability of
drawing another red marble out of the 79 remaining marbles.
The probability that an event, e, and another event, f, will both occur is equal
to the product of the two probabilities. P(e and f ) = P(e) × P(f ).
The probability of drawing a red marble is

Looking at 40 rows of seats on an airplane, with 7 seats per row
Nowadays, you can make your plane reservations online and, in some cases,
even pick your seats. The following problems involve the case where you’re
on standby and don’t get a seat assignment choice — you’ll be happy just to

get on the airplane. So assume that the seat assignment is selected at random.
Imagine that all 40 rows in the airplane have 7 seats across: 2 seats on either
side along the windows, and 3 seats in the middle. So there are 40 × 7 = 280
seats possible.
The Problem: What is the probability that your seat will be in row 10 if there
are 40 rows with 7 seats in a row?
Take the number of seats in row 10, which is 7, and divide by the total 
number of seats, 280.

The Problem: What is the probability that you’ll get a window seat if there
are 40 rows with 7 seats in a row?
Determine the number of window seats. With 40 rows and a window seat at
each end of each row, that gives you 40 × 2 = 80 window seats. Divide 80 by the
total number of seats.

Notice that you’d get the same answer if you just did the computation on a 
single row. Two of the seven seats are window seats. The fraction 7
2 applies 
to figuring the probability of a window seat either in one row or the whole
plane.
The Problem: What is the probability that you’ll get a seat either in the last
4 rows or a window seat, if there are 40 rows and 7 seats in a row?
When counting the number of seats for this problem, you have to be careful
not to count the same seats more than once. Some of the seats in the last
four rows are also window seats.
When counting a number of items in two sets or categories, you first add up
the number of items in one category plus the number of items in the second
category, and then you subtract the number of items that they share. Let n
represent “the number in”:
n(Set 1 or Set 2) = n(Set 1) + n(Set 2) – n(Set 1 and Set 2)
Applying this rule to the seats on the plane, there are 4 × 7 = 28 seats in
the last four rows and 2 × 40 = 80 window seats. The last four rows have 
4 × 2 = 8 window seats. So the number of seats you want is: 28 + 80 – 8 = 
100 seats that are either in the last four rows or a window seat (or both). 
The probability that you’ll get one of those seats is found with

Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

Seeing whether a family of three children 
has a certain number of boys
Some classic probability problems have to do with children in a family and
determining the likelihood that all three are boys or, maybe, that there are
two boys and a girl, and so on. A wonderful way to handle problems like this
(when it’s possible) is listing all the possibilities and counting the number
of possibilities you want. In a family of three children, the eight possible
arrangements of boys (B) and girls (G), listing the children in order, are: BBB,
BBG, BGB, GBB, BGG, GBG, GGB, and GGG. Notice that two of the arrange-
ments are all one sex, three of the arrangements have two boys and one girl,
and three of the arrangements have one boy and two girls. None of the
arrangements is the same.
The Problem: When choosing a three-child family at random, what is the
probability that the children are all the same sex?
Count the number of arrangements with all the same sex and divide by the
total number of arrangements. Three children in a family can be arranged in
the following eight ways: BBB, BBG, BGB, GBB, BGG, GBG, GGB, and GGG.

GBG, GGB, and GGG have one or more girls and find that there are seven of 
them.

Using probability to determine
sums and numbers
When you have a percent or fraction that represents a probability, you can
use the decimal equivalent of the percent or the fraction to determine a

Chapter 8: Figuring the Probability and Odds

number of times that something may happen. The number answer may repre-
sent how many coins in a pouch are gold or how many moves you may be
making while playing a board game. The probability value always assumes
that you’re using fair dice (each face equally likely to appear) or a fair coin
(not weighted on one side or the other) or aren’t peeking or aren’t in some
way altering the numerical value.
Rolling a die with faces of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
When you roll a die, one of the faces lies on the table, and the other five faces
are showing. The face that counts, in most games, is the face on the top of
the die, after it’s been rolled.
The Problem: You’re nearing the end of a game of Trivial Pursuit and are just
three spaces away from trying for the last pie piece (for non-Pursuit people,
it’s the last of six categories). You shake and shake and shake your die before
rolling it. What is the probability that you’ll roll either a 3 or a 5 (a 5 will allow
you to roll again)?
Make a listing of all the possible results of the roll and a listing of all the num-
bers that you want to get. With six faces on the die, there are six different
possibilities: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. You want one of two different rolls: 3 or 5
(although you’d prefer the number 3), so you divide 2 by 6 to get about
0.3333 or 33.33 percent.
Rolling a die and flipping a coin at the same time
When you roll a standard die, you get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. When you flip a coin,
you get either heads or tails. Do the two actions at the same time (which
takes some coordination not to have at least one fall on the floor) and you
have the following results possible (let H represent heads and T represent
tails): 1H, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H, 1T, 2T, 3T, 4T, 5T, or 6T.
106
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 
Sons and daughters
In the Jefferson family, each daughter has the
same number of brothers as she has sisters,
and each son has twice as many sisters as he
has brothers. How many sons and daughters
are there in this family?
Answer: There are three sons and four daughters. If each daughter has the
same number of brothers as sisters, she has one brother and one sister
(making the family two girls and one boy), two brothers and two sisters
(making it three girls and two boys), three brothers and three sisters (making
it three boys and four girls), and so on. But each son has twice as many sis-
ters as brothers, with a possible scenario of two sisters and one brother
(making the family two girls and two boys) or possibly four sisters and two
brothers, making the family four girls and three boys — a match.

The Problem: When you roll a die and flip a coin at the same time, what is
the probability that you get an even number on the die with tails?
Count up how many of the results have an even number (2, 4, or 6) and tails,
at the same time. The results you want are: 2T, 4T, or 6T. That’s 3 out of the 
12 possible results.

The Problem: When you roll a die and flip a coin at the same time, what is
the probability that you get either an even number or tails?
Note that this problem is different from the previous problem where you
wanted both an even number and tails at the same time. In this case, you’ll
take either an even number or tails, or both. You can’t just add up the
number of even numbers and the number of tails. That sum is 6 + 6 = 12,
which is the same number as all the choices. You can look through the list
and find all the choices that have either an even number or tails (or both)
and get: 2H, 4H, 6H, 1T, 2T, 3T, 4T, 5T, or 6T, which is 9 items. The other
method to use is the counting rule (refer to “Looking at 40 rows of seats on
an airplane” for more on the counting rule) and get n(even or tails) = n(even)
+ n(tails) – n(both even and tails) = 6 + 6 – 3 = 9. In any case, the probability 
is computed

Rolling two dice at the same time
Board games like Monopoly involve moves based on the results of rolling two
dice at the same time and adding up the face values. The sums that you get
from adding the two numbers on the dice are any of the 11 numbers from 2
through 12, but there are 36 different ways to get those 11 numbers. The
sums are best shown with a table of values. In Table 8-1, the face values of the
two dice are shown along the top and down the left side. The sums are shown
in the table.

You probably notice, in the table, that the numbers increase as you move
down a column or across a row. Did you also notice that the sums in the diag-
onals are the same? The longest diagonal is the one with the sums of 7 — it
has six entries that add up to 7.
The Problem: What is the probability that, when you roll two dice, you’ll get
a sum of 6?
Referring to the table, you see that there are five different ways to get a sum
of 6; the sums are all found on a diagonal starting under the 5s column and
moving downward to the left. Make a fraction putting 5 in the numerator and 
36 in the denominator.

The Problem: You’re playing Monopoly and sitting on the railroad right
before reaching Go. You’re also looking at Park Place and Boardwalk with
your opponent’s hotels, waiting for you to land on them. What is the proba-
bility that you’ll roll a sum large enough to miss those hotels completely
(you need a sum of 5 or more)?
You can refer to Table 8-1 and count up all the sums that are 5 or greater.
Then put the number of sums you count over 36 and divide. An even easier
task would be to count up those sums that are less than 5, find the probabil-
ity, and then subtract that probability from 100 percent. (Refer to the “Counting
up parts of things for probability” section for more on how the rule for not
works.) You see six different entries in the table that are sums of 4 or less.

The Problem: When you roll two dice, what is the probability that the sum
will be even or that the roll will be a doubles (both faces the same)?
Count up the number of rolls that have an even sum, and then go along the
diagonal to count up all the doubles. Subtract the rolls that the two cate-
gories have in common. n(even sums) + n(doubles) – n(even sums that are
doubles) = 18 + 6 – 6 = 18. All of the doubles are even sums, of course. Twice a
number (any number) is an even number. So the probability is found by divid-
ing 18 ÷ 36, which is half, and the probability is 50 percent.
Making words from words — or not
If you’re like me, you’ve have had at least one teacher who sought to entertain
you and your classmates on the day before a school holiday by having you
make words from the letters in the name of the holiday, whatever the holiday
was. Being a word junky, myself, I always liked these exercises. Those who
aren’t that much into words will just have to indulge me a bit.
108
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

The rules for making words in statistical or probability problems is that the
arrangement of letters doesn’t have to actually form a real word. A better
term than word in this process is arrangement. You just list all the different
arrangements of letters possible. For example, you can make a list of 12 differ-
ent 2-letter words (arrangements) formed from the letters in MATH. These
words are: MA, MT, MH, AM, TM, HM, AT, AH, TA, HA, TH, HT. Of those
12 arrangements, the only words that are actually found in the dictionary
are: MA, AM, AT, AH, and HA. (No, you can’t use TA; it’s an abbreviation
for one of the elements in the periodic table, for teaching assistant, and for
numerous other things as well.)
The Problem: You have the four Scrabble tiles M, A, T, and H in a bag.
Drawing out two of the letters, what is the probability that you can form an
English word with the two letters?
Of the 12 different arrangements possible with the four letters in the
word MATH, five of them form words, so the probability computed is

15 different possibilities are: ST, SA, SR, SE, SD, TA, TR, TE, TD, AR, AE, AD,

Predicting the Outcomes
Some probabilities are empirical (determined by observations or experi-
ments) and other probabilities are theoretical (determined using mathematical
formulas). For instance, the probability that a person will have type-O blood is
empirical — determined over the years from testing the blood of millions of
people. The probability that a person will win the lottery is theoretical — it
can be computed using mathematical formulas. But these are just probabili-
ties. Neither guarantees or forbids anything. Each determines a likelihood of
something occurring. No matter how likely something will happen, there’s still
the chance that it won’t happen.
109
Chapter 8: Figuring the Probability and Odds

Predicting using empirical probabilities
The weather is one of the most frequently talked-about probability situations.
You get predictions on temperature, precipitation, humidity, and long-term
trends.
Seeing that the probability of rain is 70 percent
You hear on the radio that for the month of April, the probability of rain will
be 70 percent. This means that, 70 percent of the time, it’ll be raining on a
day in April. This is just a prediction, of course, but it’s computed using past
trends and observations of what’s going on around the world.
The Problem: You’re planning on an April wedding. If the prediction is that
there’s a 70 percent chance of rain on any day in April, how many days does
that leave you to try to plan a dry-weather wedding?
You’re going to assume that the dry periods will occur on full days — just to
make the math simpler. (And you certainly don’t want it to rain for 70 percent
of the time every day!) If it’s going to rain on 70 percent of the days, then it
should be dry for 30 percent of them. Multiply the number of days in April,
30, by 30 percent to get 30 × 0.30 = 9. You have nine days to choose from for
your wedding. Lots of luck!
Using the probability of being struck by lightning
The probability of being struck by lightning is a pretty low number, even if
that probability is applied to every year of your life. Of course, your lifestyle
can change that probability somewhat — depending on how much you go
golfing or sailing.
The Problem: If the population of the United States is 300 million, and the
probability of a person being hit by lightning is 0.00003 percent, then how
many people do you expect to be hit by lightning this year?
You will multiply the number of people by the probability of being hit by
lightning. Watch out for the two numerical challenges. The 300 million has to
have zeros added, and the percentage has to have its decimal place changed
before multiplying. The computation: 300,000,000 × 0.0000003 = 90 people in
the United States who are expected to be hit by lightning.
Working with a probability of having type-O blood
If you have type-O blood, then you’re very popular with the local hospitals
and blood banks, because you’re a universal donor. Approximately 45 per-
cent of the population has type-O blood, 40 percent has type-A blood, 11 per-
cent has type-B blood, and 4 percent has type-AB blood. Along with the four
blood types in terms of letters, you are either RH+ or RH–. So, technically,
there are eight different blood types: O+, O–, A+, A–, B+, B–, AB+, and AB–.
110
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

The Problem: You have type B+ blood and need a blood transfusion. You can
use either type-O or type-B blood and can use either a + or – RH factor. What
is the probability that a person selected at random can be a donor for you?
Determine the total percentage of eligible donors by adding the probabilities
together: 45 percent + 11 percent = 56 percent.
The Problem: You work for the Red Cross blood services and need to secure
some O– blood to have on hand for the imminent birth of quadruplets at the
local hospital. Of the 45 percent of the population that has type-O blood,
about 16 percent of the type-O people are O–. About how many people out of
100 has O– blood (what is the probability that a person selected at random
out of 100 has O– blood)?
Percentages are out of 100. So, if 45 percent of the population has type-O blood,
then chances are that 45 out of 100 have type-O blood. If 16 percent of the type
O people have O– blood, then find 16 percent of 45 with 0.16 × 45 = 7.2. About
7 people in 100 have O– blood. The probability of a person at random having
O– blood is about 7.2 percent.
Counting on Jimmy batting 300
When you say that a baseball player is batting .300, this means that his per-
centage is 300 out 1,000 or 30 percent. So the probability that he’ll get a hit
when he goes to bat is 30 percent.
The Problem: Jimmy is first in the lineup and typically gets to bat four times
each game. His team is playing Chicago this weekend and they’ll play four
games in all. Jimmy is batting .300. How many hits do his fans expect him
to get?
In the four-game series, Jimmy expects to bat 4 × 4 = 16 times. The probability
of a hit at any time at bat is 30 percent, so multiply 16 × 0.30 = 4.8. Jimmy is
expected to get about five hits.
Using theoretical probabilities
Theoretical probabilities are determined using mathematical counting tech-
niques and mathematical formulas. These probabilities are still just that: 
predictions or likelihoods of events happening.
Betting on heads or tails
When flipping a fair coin, the probability is 50 percent that it’ll be heads and
50 percent that it’ll be tails.
111
Chapter 8: Figuring the Probability and Odds

The Problem: What is the probability of flipping three heads in a row?
This problem can be done one of two ways: Multiply the probability three
times or make a list of possibilities and write a fraction. The probability
of getting heads is 50 percent. The probability of heads the first time and

three flips, and you get 50 percent × 50 percent × 50 percent = 0.50 × 0.50 
× 0.50 = 0.125 = 12.5 percent. The chance of three heads in a row isn’t
very good. The other method, making a list instead of multiplying, has
you write down all the possibilities of flipping three coins: HHH, HHT,
HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT. You see 8 different arrangements, and

Working with the probability of winning the lottery
You have a better chance of being struck by lightning than of winning the lot-
tery! Earlier in this chapter, I tell you that the probability of a person being
hit by lightning is 0.00003 percent. And, as low as that probability is, it’s
better than your chance of winning the lottery. The probability of winning
the lottery is mathematically generated; the lightning probability comes
from observations (and not all strikes are reported).
A certain state has a lottery in which you have to guess which 6 of 54 numbers
will be drawn on Saturday night. Your favorite numbers are: 10, 16, 17, 19, 26,
and 28.
The Problem: The probability of winning a lottery, where you have to pick six
numbers from the numbers 1 through 54, is 0.00000387 percent. How many
tickets do you have to buy (and combinations of numbers do you have to
choose) to be sure that you have a ticket with all the winning numbers on it?
The percentage is the probability that one ticket will be the winning ticket.
Divide the number 1 by the percentage to get the number of tickets needed
(the probability is 1 out of that number of tickets). 1 ÷ 0.0000000387 ≈
25,830,000 tickets. This is a rounded number, because the probability was
rounded and most scientific calculators won’t give the exact value. In any
case, there isn’t enough time in a week to buy all the tickets, even if you
had the money to do it.
Dealing with the probability of drawing an ace
A standard deck of playing cards has four different suits (spades, hearts, dia-
monds, clubs) and 13 different cards in each suit. Whether you’re playing
poker or bridge or hearts or euchre, the probability of a particular card or a
particular suit plays a big part in the result of the game. The rest of the game
depends on your skill and your partner.
112
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

The Problem: You’re playing hearts with three other players. You’re trying to
decide what card to play. What are the chances that the person to your left
has the queen of spades?
First, assume that you do not have the queen of spades. (Otherwise, why
would you need to find the probability?) The cards remaining to be played are
divided among four players. It doesn’t matter how many cards have yet to be
played — and you’re only worried about three-fourths of them, because you
know what cards you have. One out of the other three players has the queen
of spades. Back to the question: what is the probability that the person to
your left has the queen of spades? After wading through all the extra informa-
tion, you determine that the probability is 1 ÷ 3 = 0.3333 or about 33.33 per-
cent chance that it’s the person to your left with the queen of spades.
The Problem: You’re drawing a card from a standard deck of playing cards.
What is the probability that you’ll draw either an ace or a club?
Use the counting method from the “Counting up parts of things for probability”
section to get the number of cards in the category that you want: an ace or a
club. n(aces) + n(clubs) – n(ace of clubs) = 4 + 13 – 1 = 16 cards. A full deck has 
52 cards, so divide 16 ÷ 52.

Figuring Out the Odds
The probability that something will happen and the odds of it happening are
closely tied by the mathematics involved. If the probability of an event is 50
percent, then the odds of the event are 1 to 1 (one that it will, and one that it
won’t).
113
Chapter 8: Figuring the Probability and Odds
The birthday problem
Even though there are 366 different birthdays
possible, you only need to have about 24 people
in a room to have a better than 50 percent
chance that two people will have the same
birthday (not the year, necessarily, just the
date). In a room of 40 people, the probability is
almost 90 percent that two people will have the
same birthday. Next time you’re in a boring
meeting, try it by surveying the gathering.

Changing from probability
to odds and back again
The probability of an event is a percentage between 0 percent and 100 per-
cent, which is computed by dividing the number of ways an event can
happen by the total number of ways that all the events can happen. For
example, in a family of two children, the probability of there being at least
one girl is 75 percent, because in the listing of all the possibilities: BB, BG,
GB, GG, you see that three of the choices have at least one girl. Divide 3 ÷ 4 to
get 0.75 or 75 percent.
The odds of there being at least one girl in a two-child family are 3 to 1 (also
written 3:1). You read the odds as being three ways for the event to happen
and one way for it not to happen.
Computing odds given the probability
The easiest way to compute the odds when you’re given the probability is let
the probability be represented by p percent and write: p to (100 – p) and
reduce the two numbers as if they were fractions. For example, if the proba-
bility is 75 percent, you write: 75 to (100 – 75) which becomes 75 to 25. Then
divide each number by 25 to get 3 to 1.
Computing probability given the odds
When you’re given the odds of an event, you need to write a fraction to com-
pute the probability. If the odds are a to b, write the fraction a
b
a
+
and then 
determine the decimal and the percentage. So, for example, if the odds are 4

The Problem: You had 49¢ (in American coins) in your pocket, but your
pocket has a hole in it, and one coin fell out. If you had exactly seven coins in
your pocket, what are the odds that it was a dime that fell out?
First, determine what the coins are. You know that the sum of the two num-
bers in the odds a to b will have to be seven, but you need more information.
To have exactly 49 cents in American coins, and for there to be only 7 coins,
you have to have had 1 quarter, 2 dimes, and 4 pennies (this is the only com-
bination of seven coins that equals 49 cents). So the odds that a dime fell out
are 2 to 5. Of course, this doesn’t take into account the fact that a dime is
smaller than the other coins and more likely to slip through the hole.

M
oney is a common denominator. We deal with money just about every
day — from the spending end, the earning end, or both. Counting
coins is one of the earliest number exercises for a small child. And collecting
coins is a passion of many historians and numismatists.
This chapter deals with computing totals of money and figuring out the
number of coins from the totals. You even get a short primer on monetary
units from several different countries and see how the basic properties are
the same for just about any monetary system.
Determining the Total Count
Counting up the coins in your pocket or from your piggy bank involves more
than just knowing that you have 80 coins. The number of coins doesn’t tell
you how much money you have. You usually have different denominations,
so you need to count each type of coin differently. Each type of coin gets mul-
tiplied by its monetary value.
Equating different money amounts
Each country has its own monetary system with its set of coins and other
currency. Often, the money is imprinted with pictures of historic figures and
places. In the United States, for example, each state is honored (or soon will

be) with its own quarter. What is similar to the coinage of different countries
is that different coins take on different values. In the United States, it takes
more nickels to make a dollar than it does quarters, but it sure feels like you
have more money when you have a dollar’s worth of nickels rather than a
dollar’s worth of quarters.
The Problem: You want to change your $5 bill into nickels or quarters. How
many nickels and how many quarters are needed to equal $5?
A nickel is worth 5¢, and a quarter is worth 25¢. Five dollars is equal to 500¢.
To determine the number of nickels in $5, divide 500¢ by 5¢: 500 ÷ 5 = 100
nickels. The number of quarters is determined by dividing 500 cents by 25
cents: 500 ÷ 25 = 20 quarters.
The Problem: A roll of quarters from the bank equals $10, a roll of dimes
equals $5, a roll of nickels equals $2, and a roll of pennies equals 50¢. How
many rolls of dimes is worth the same as 20 rolls of nickels?
Sort through the information, first. You only need to know about the dimes
and nickels. Determine the total of 20 rolls of nickels. Then figure out how
many rolls of dimes you can get for that amount of money. Twenty rolls of
nickels is 20 × $2 = $40. Divide 40 by 5: $40 ÷ $5 = 8 rolls of dimes.
The Problem: A roll of dimes is worth $5, a roll of nickels is worth $2, and a
roll of pennies is worth 50¢. Which is worth more: 10 rolls of nickels, 4 rolls of
dimes, or 50 rolls of pennies?
Multiply the number of rolls of nickels by $2, the number of rolls of dimes by
$5, and the number of rolls of pennies by half a dollar, or 50¢. (An alternative
would be to change the $2 and $5 to cents; in any case, the units all have to
be the same to make a comparison.) Doing the calculations: 10 rolls of nickels
× $2 = $20; 4 rolls of dimes × $5 = $20; 50 rolls of pennies × $0.50 = $25. The
pennies are worth more than the nickels or dimes by $5.
Adding it all up
To find the total amount of money you have in coins or bills, you multiply the
number of each by their monetary value and add up all the products for the
total.
The Problem: You open up your piggy bank and find 177 pennies, 123 nickels,
59 dimes, 33 quarters, and 5 half-dollars. What is the total amount of money
in your piggy bank?
118
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

Multiply the number of pennies by 1, nickels by 5, dimes by 10, quarters by
25, and half-dollars by 50. This gives you the number of cents. It’s easier to
multiply by whole numbers, at first, and then change to dollars by moving
the decimal point two places to the left. Doing the computation:
177 × 1¢ = 177¢
123 × 5¢ = 615¢
59 × 10¢ = 590¢
33 × 25¢ = 825¢
5 × 50¢ = 250¢
The sum of the products is: 177 + 615 + 590 + 825 + 250 = 2,457¢. Moving the
decimal point two places (or dividing by 100), you get that the total in the
piggy bank is $24.57.
The Problem: You are in charge of the concession stand at Friday’s football
game. You need to bring enough coins and bills to make change for the pur-
chases of the customers. You’re given a check for $200 to pay for the change
and decide to get 50 $1 bills, 20 $5 bills, and the rest of the change in quarters
and nickels. Quarters come in rolls worth $10, and nickels come in rolls
worth $2. How many rolls of quarters and nickels can you get?
You first determine how much money in coins you’ll be getting after taking
care of the $1 bills and $5 bills. Add up the total for the $1 bills and $5 bills.
Then subtract the total of the bills from $200. Many different combinations of
rolls of quarters and nickels add up to the amount you’ll need in coins. Make
a chart, putting the number of rolls of quarters in one column, its worth in
the next column, the value remaining in the third column (after spending this
much on the quarters), and then the number of rolls of nickels you can buy in
the last column.

Chapter 9: Counting Your Coins
Ancient coin
An archaeologist claims that he found an
ancient coin dated 46 B.C. He put it on eBay and
hoped to sell it for a small fortune. Fortunately,
all people who use eBay are much too smart for
him. Why didn’t anyone bid on the coin?
Answer: In the year 46 B.C., the break in the years between B.C. and A.D.
hadn’t been determined yet. If the coin was really from 46 B.C., whoever cre-
ated the coin wouldn’t have known that it was B.C. and would have put on a
year based on whatever calendar he was using at the time.

Determining the amount in bills: 50 × $1 = $50 and 20 × $5 = $100. The total of
$150 leaves $50 in coins ($200 – $150 = $50). In Table 9-1, I filled in the number
of rolls of quarters first. Then I computed the value of the quarters, leaving
the amount for nickels. Finally, I computed the number of rolls of nickels.

You’ll need no quarters with 25 rolls of nickels, 1 roll of quarters and 20 rolls
of nickels, 2 rolls of quarters with 15 rolls of nickels, 3 rolls of quarters and 10
rolls of nickels, 4 rolls of quarters and 5 rolls of nickels, or 5 rolls of quarters
with no nickels.
Working Out the Denominations of Coins
If you have enough different kinds of coins, you can create any number of
money amounts. Some money amounts are possible with several different
combinations of coins. You want to be creative. The standard U.S. coins are
used in the problems in this section: penny (1¢), nickel (5¢), dime (10¢), quar-
ter (25¢), half-dollar (50¢), and dollar (100¢ or $1).
Having the total and figuring out the coins
Some people like to have lots of coins in their pockets. It gives them a feeling
of wealth. Others don’t like to have their pockets bulge too much, so they
prefer not to have a lot of extra coins around. There are problems in this sec-
tion for both types of people — depending on which type you are.
The Problem: Stefanie wants to give each of her children 42¢. How can she
do this with the least number of coins for each child?
120
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

Make a chart of the different denominations of coins and the number of each
type of coin that is needed to add up to 42¢. The table won’t have to contain
50-cent pieces or dollars, because they’re both worth more than the total
needed. See the chart I created in Table 9-2.

I’ll stop here with the table. The numbers aren’t getting any better. It looks
like one quarter, one dime, one nickel, and two pennies are the fewest
number of coins needed to add up to 42¢.
The Problem: How many different ways can you make change for a quarter?
Haul out another chart. As you fill in the different amounts, do this in an orga-
nized fashion, using dimes as many ways as you can, nickels as many ways as
you can, and so on, just to make it less likely that you’ll miss something.
Table 9-3 has just the totals for each coin, not the number of coins.

Chapter 9: Counting Your Coins
Two strange coins
A certain country has just two kinds of coins.
One coin is called a sevna and is worth 7 units.
The other coin is a levna, and it’s worth 11 units.
Because of these strange units, some prices
can’t be paid for exactly using these coins.
Residents can pay for items costing 7 units or 14
units or 18 units, and so on. What is the highest
priced item that can’t be paid for with any com-
bination of these coins?
Answer: You may think that it’s a pretty high price that can’t be paid for, but
it isn’t. The highest priced item that isn’t a multiple of 7 or 11 or a combina-
tion of 7s and 11s is the number 59. Any number bigger than 59 can be paid
for with sevnas and levnas.

As you see, you can make change for a quarter in 12 different ways, using
standard U.S. coins.
The Problem: How can you have a total of $1.40 using exactly 24 coins?
You can do this problem with a chart — a big chart. But another, not-too-
glamorous way, is to try to work it out through trial and error and reasoning.
For example, you could try using five quarters (the greatest number of quar-
ters possible), leaving 140¢ – 125¢ = 15 cents. Even if you used all pennies for
the rest of the coins, that’s only a total of 5 + 15 = 20 coins, which isn’t
enough, if you’re aiming for 24 coins.
Next, you could try using four quarters, leaving 140 – 100 = 40¢. You now
need to use 20 more coins to add up to 40¢. One dime and 30 pennies is too
many coins. Two dimes and 20 pennies is still too many coins. Three dimes
and ten pennies is too few coins. Are you ready to go to a chart yet? No, I’m
not giving up that easily.
Think about the pennies. If you’re going to use pennies, they have to be a
multiple of 5 for the total to come out to an even 140¢. You need to use 5, 10,
15, or 20 pennies so that the other coins will add up with them and come out
right. Start with 20 pennies (the most you can use without exceeding 24
122
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

coins) and work downward. Using 20 pennies, you now need 4 more coins to
add up to $1.20. You can do this in two different ways: a dollar coin plus a
dime and two nickels, or two 50-cent pieces plus two dimes. Whew! Two
answers! And there are more. For example, 2 quarters plus 8 dimes plus 9
nickels plus 5 pennies are 24 coins that add up to $1.40. Can you find any
more? If so, e-mail me at sterling@bradley.edu, and I’ll post them on my
Web site (http://hilltop.bradley.edu/~sterling/facinfo.html)!
Going with choices of coins and bills
The coins used in the United States have several things in common with the
coins used in other countries. The biggest commonality is having 100¢ in $1.
Most countries have monetary systems with 100 of some coin being equal to
the main monetary unit.
In the metric system, each unit is ten times or one-tenth of another unit. Not
so in our money system. Even with five nickels in a quarter and ten dimes in a
dollar, there is still no way to divide a quarter into an equal number of dimes.
Our paper currency is a bit more forgiving, but there are still challenges with
the dividing and multiplying.
The Problem: How many nickels, dimes, quarters, and half-dollars are equal
in value to $5?
Divide 500¢ (5 × 100¢) by the cents value of each of the coins. For nickels,
500¢ ÷ 5¢ = 100 nickels. With dimes, 500¢ ÷ 10¢ = 50 dimes. Quarters give you
500¢ ÷ 25¢ = 20. And half-dollars yield 500¢ ÷ 50¢ = 10 half-dollars.
The Problem: How many quarters are equivalent to $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50,
and $100?
123
Chapter 9: Counting Your Coins
Sliding the pennies
Look at the triangle of pennies shown in the
figure. Can you reverse the triangle so that it
points downward instead of upward — and do
it by moving only three pennies?
Answer: Move penny 7 up next to penny 2 and penny 10 up next to penny 3.
Then move penny 1 down, below pennies 8 and 9.

If you divide $1 by 25¢, that’s 100 ÷ 25 = 4 quarters. Two dollars divided by
25¢ is 200 ÷ 25 = 8 quarters. You can do the divisions for the rest of the bills,
but an easier way than dividing by 25 is multiplying by 4. Because $1 is equal
to 4 quarters, $20 is equal to 20 × 4 = 80 quarters, $50 is equal to 50 × 4 = 20
quarters, and so on.
Figuring Coins from around the World
Most of the countries in the world have coin systems in which one of the
coins is worth 100 of another. Other coins are then multiples of that smaller
coin — usually 10 times, 20 times, or 50 times. The exceptions are few.
The coin names are usually pretty interesting, though, and probably have
some historical significance.
Making change in another country
In India, the monetary unit is the rupee. You find banknotes of 5, 10, 20, 50,
and 100 rupees. There are also 1-rupee, 2-rupee, and 5-rupee coins. The
smaller coins in India are paise. One rupee is equal to 100 paise. The coins
that are multiples of the paise are 10-paise coins, 20-paise coins, 25-paise
coins, and 50-paise coins.
The Problem: Is there a single coin in India that is equal to: three rupees, one
50-paise coin, three 20-paise coins, three 25-paise coins, and 15 paise? (In
other words, if you have all that in your pocket, can you exchange it for a
single coin?)
Determine the total amount of money all these coins are worth. Then look at
the equivalence between rupees and paise and see if a coin in the list is equal
to the sum. Just concentrate on the paise, at first. When you get a total, you
can see if you’ll need to change the rupees to paise or paise to rupees.
Multiplying each of the paise coins by how many of each you have: (1 × 50) +
(3 × 20) + (3 × 25) + (15 × 1) = 50 + 60 + 75 + 15 = 200 paise. Because 100 paise
equals 1 rupee, the 200 paise are worth 2 rupees. Add these two rupees to
the three rupees you already have, and you can exchange the five 1-rupee
coins for a 5-rupee coin.
The Problem: Some interesting Indian coins are no longer used. In the late
1940s, you got 16 annas for 1 rupee, 4 pice for 1 anna, and 3 pies for 1 pice.
How many pies could you get for 12 rupees?
124
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

Multiply the number of rupees by 16 to get the number of annas. Multiply
that product by 4 to get the number of pies. Then multiply that product by 3

The Problem: In China, the monetary unit is yuan. One yuan is equal to 10
jiao, and 1 jiao is equal to 10 fen. The multiples and powers of ten are at work
here, making the computation much easier. What is the fewest number of
coins (or paper bills) you need if you have 6,348 fen?
First determine how many fen in a yuan. Then divide 6,348 by that number to
get as many yuan as possible. Next, divide the remainder by 10 to convert
them to jiao. The rest will have to be in fen, and there should be fewer than
10 fen. If there are 10 fen in 1 jiao and 10 jiao in 1 yuan, then there are 10 × 10
fen in 1 yuan. Divide 6,348 by 100 to get 63 yuan with a remainder of 48. Divide
48 by 10 to get 4 jiao with 8 left over. 63 yuan + 4 jiao + 8 fen is equal to 75 coins
or bills.
Converting other currency to U.S. dollars
A common challenge for people traveling in foreign countries is converting
their money to the currency of that country and back again. If you’re unfamiliar
with a particular monetary unit, you need to get acquainted with the relative

Pushing a coin through paper
Can you push a quarter through a dime-sized
hole in a piece of paper? Take a dime and trace
around it on a piece of paper. Then carefully cut
out along the circle you’ve drawn, leaving a hole
in the paper. Now push a quarter through the
hole without tearing the paper. How can you do
this?
Answer: Fold the paper so that the fold goes through the hole. Then take the
ends of the fold and bend them (and the paper) down, toward each other.
The quarter will slip through the hole that has been flattened out.

you’re buying. The exchange rates change daily, so the problems in this section
use approximate values to give you an idea of the different conversions.
The Problem: If one U.S. dollar is equal to 8.28 Chinese yuan, then what is the
approximate cost, in dollars, of a silk robe that’s selling for 3,000 yuan?
The biggest challenge to doing these problems is in deciding whether to mul-
tiply or divide — and by what. A good approach to doing money conversions
is to use proportions. Chapter 7 goes into more detail on the properties of
proportions. In the case of dollars and yuans, write a fraction with $1 divided
by 8.28 yuan. Then set that fraction equal to x dollars divided by 3,000 yuan.
Note that the dollars are opposite dollars, in the numerator, and the yuans
are opposite yuans in the denominator.

A
mathematical formula is a rule, comprised of different operations. A
formula works and is true no matter how many times you use it. A for-
mula is created either by observing something that repeats and writing down
the pattern, or by doing some creative mathematical manipulations. For
instance, Pythagoras observed that there is a relationship between the sides
of a right triangle. Hence, the famous formula called the Pythagorean theorem.
(Chapter 18 is completely devoted to Pythagoras’s contribution.)
In this chapter, you see how to handle, manipulate, and come to terms with
different types of formulas. The mathematical computations must be done
correctly, so I cover that here. Plugging values into a formula nets the formula
output or result, but you’ll also see how to determine what input gave you a
particular output.
Solving for the Formula Amount
Working with a formula requires that you have the formula written accu-
rately, that you know what the symbols in the formula represent (so you can
put the right numbers in the right places), and that you do the mathematics
correctly. You should also make a prediction or plan ahead so that you have a
fairly good idea of what the answer will be. This helps you spot an obvious
error in computations, if it occurs.

Inserting the values correctly for area
and perimeter formulas
The formula for the area of a rectangle is A = lw. Interpreting the symbols and
operation, this formula says that the area of a rectangle, A, is equal to the
product of the length of the rectangle, l, and the width of the rectangle, w.
The Problem: Find the area of a rectangle with a length of 14 inches and a
width of 7 inches.
The information in this problem is pretty straightforward. Let l = 14 and w = 7,
and you get that the area is A = 14 × 7 = 98 square inches.
It’s nice when the values for a formula are laid out for you clearly. But some-
times you have to work out the details from pictures or charts. A trapezoid
is a four-sided polygon in which one pair of opposite sides is parallel. The 
formula for the area of a trapezoid is A

i. Figure 10-1 shows you 
the sketch of a trapezoid with segments labeled by size. The formula for the
area of a trapezoid says that the area is equal to 1⁄2 times the height of the
trapezoid times the sum of the two bases (the parallel sides). The height of
a trapezoid is the distance between the two bases.
The Problem: Find the area of the trapezoid pictured in Figure 10-1 using the
dimensions shown in the figure.
First, identify the values that correspond to the different letters in the for-
mula. Then replace the letters with the numbers and simplify the expression.
In the trapezoid in Figure 10-1, the height of the trapezoid is 2 inches. The
two bases are 4 inches and 6 inches in length. The other two lengths —
the sides — aren’t needed to find the area of the trapezoid. Filling in the 
numbers, the area problem becomes A

Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

If you were unhappy about not being able to use the lengths of the sides of
the trapezoid in Figure 10-1, you need be unhappy no longer. The perimeter
(distance around the outside) of a trapezoid is found with P = s1 + s2 + s3 + s4.
The formula for the perimeter of a trapezoid isn’t very elegant, because the
lengths of the sides are often all different. you don’t see pairs of lengths as in
rectangles and parallelograms. But the formula for the perimeter of a trape-
zoid really just defines what the perimeter of any figure is: the distance
around the outside.
The Problem: Find the perimeter of the trapezoid in Figure 10-1.
Replace the side symbols in the formula with the measures of the sides. Do
not use the height of the trapezoid. So P = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18 inches.
When a polygon has some regularity to it — when opposite sides are parallel
or the adjacent sides are congruent or some such situation — then the
perimeter formula is more elegant than just adding up the measures of the
sides. The perimeter formula can contain time-saving, computation-easing
operations and groupings. The perimeter of a parallelogram (a four-sided
polygon with opposite sides that are parallel to one another) is found with P
= 2(l + w). The perimeter is equal to twice the sum of the length and width.
Figure 10-2 shows four parallelograms, all with the same perimeter. The first
(left-most) parallelogram is just that — your standard, run-of-the-mill parallel-
ogram. The second parallelogram is also called a rhombus, a parallelogram
with all the sides equal in measure. The next is a rectangle, a parallelogram
with 90-degree angles, and the last is the most special of all parallelograms, a
square.
The Problem: Find the perimeters of the parallelogram, rhombus, rectangle,
and square from Figure 10-2 using P = 2(l + w) for the parallelogram and rec-
tangle and P = 4s for the rhombus and square.
First, identify the values of l, w, and s in the figures. Then replace the letters
with the correct number values in the formulas and simplify. The l and w
represent the length and width of the parallelogram and rectangle. So the
perimeter of each is P = 2(4 + 2) = 2(6) = 12 units. The letter s represents the
length of any side of the rhombus or square. So the perimeter of these two
figures is P = 4(3) = 12 units.

Chapter 10: Formulating a Plan with Formulas

Using the correct order of operations
when simplifying formulas
Mathematical formulas are made up of symbols and operations. The opera-
tions need to be performed in the correct order so that you get the correct
answer.
The order of operations states that, when two or more operations are to be
performed in a computation, you do the operations in the following order:
1. Powers or roots
2. Multiplication or division
3. Addition or subtraction
The order of operations is interrupted if you find grouping symbols.
Operations inside parentheses or brackets or braces are performed before
the results inside those grouping symbols are combined with other opera-
tions. Fraction lines also act as grouping symbols.

where A is the total

number of years that all this is occurring. Find the total amount of money

The horse eats the hay
A horse is tied to a 20-foot rope, and there is a
bail of hay that’s 35 feet away from him. But the
horse still is able to eat the bail of hay. How is
this possible?
Answer: Sure, the horse is tied to the rope, but the other end of the rope isn’t
tied to anything. So the horse can go anywhere it wants and just drag the
rope behind it.

Replace the letters in the formula with the corresponding numbers. The
value of the expression inside the parentheses has to be computed first. But
there’s both addition and division inside the parentheses, so do the division,
and then add the results to the 1.

the sides. Find the area of a triangle with sides that measure 7 yards, 18 feet,
and 108 inches.
First, notice that the measures are all different units. Change all the measures
to the same unit. The best choice is to change everything to yards, because
inches will result in some really big numbers. Also, the sides all come out to
being a whole number of yards. The second step is to find the perimeter of
the triangle. P = a + b + c. The semi-perimeter, s, is half the perimeter. Then,
finally, put all the values in their correct places in the formula and simplify.
Changing the measures, 18 feet is equal to 18 ÷ 3 = 6 yards, because there are
3 feet in a yard. And 108 inches is equal to 108 ÷ 36 = 3 yards, because there
are 36 inches in a yard. The perimeter is: 7 + 6 + 3 = 16 yards. So the semi-
perimeter is 8 yards (half the perimeter).

Delving into a Formula and Its Input
A formula is used to find an answer to a problem that’s computable. You use
one of several formulas to find the area of a triangle. The area is predictable,
because the area of a triangle can be computed exactly using one of those
132
Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

formulas. The choice of a formula depends on what information or input you
have available. The input into a formula consists of numbers that are particu-
lar to that problem or question. For the area of a triangle, the input may be
the length of the base and the height of the triangle, or the input may be the
measures of the three sides. It all depends on the formula being applied that
time.
Taking an answer and finding the question
Using the formula for the area of a square, you can find the area when you
know how long the sides are. The formula for the area of a square is: A = s2
where A is the area and s is the length of a side. This area formula also allows
you to find the question if you’re given the answer. This is sort of like the
game show Jeopardy!, where you give the question.
The Problem: If the area of a square is 144 square inches, then what is the
length of the sides of that square?
Replace the A in the formula with 144 and solve for the value of s. You get
that 144 = s2. Two numbers have squares that are 144, 12 and –12. Because it
doesn’t make any sense to have a side of a square be a negative number, then
the answer must be s = 12.
The Problem: The area of a rectangle is found with the formula A = lw, where
l is the length and w is the width. If the area of a rectangle is 70 square feet,
and the length of the rectangle is 10 feet, then what is the perimeter of that
rectangle?
This problem has two parts. First, you solve for the width of the rectangle.
Then you use the length and width in the perimeter formula P = 2(l + w) to
find the perimeter of that rectangle.
Since A = lw, replace the A with 70 and the l with 10. You get 70 = 10w. Dividing
each side of the equation by 10, you get that w = 7. The width of the rectangle
is 7 feet. Use this information to find the perimeter, replacing the l with 10 and
the w with 7. The perimeter is found: P = 2(10 + 7) = 2(17) = 34 feet.
Consider a traveler who rents a car for $30 per day plus mileage. He returns
the car after a few days and is shocked by the bill, so he asks about the
charge for the mileage.
The Problem: Clay rented a car for three days. The contract reads that the
charge is $30 per day plus mileage. The number where the mileage rate is given
is all blurry. His total bill is $310, and he drove 400 miles, so what is the charge
per mile?
133
Chapter 10: Formulating a Plan with Formulas

The total charge was based on the formula: C = (rate × m) + ($30 × d). This for-
mula says that the charge, C, is equal to the mileage rate times the number of
miles, m, plus $30 times the number of days, d. Clay has all of the information
he needs except for the rate per mile. Filling in the information that he has,
Clay knows that $310 = (rate × 400 miles) + ($30 × 3 days). Letting the mileage
rate be represented by R, the formula simplifies to: 310 = 400R + 90. Subtract
90 from each side to get that 220 = 400R. Divide each side by 400, and you get
that R = 0.55. So it appears that the mileage rate was 55¢ per mile.
Comparing several inputs resulting
in the same output
You can reconstruct exactly what input resulted in a certain output as long as
the formula contains just one input variable. For example, if the perimeter of
a square is found with P = 4s, and you’re told that the perimeter is 48 yards,
then solving 48 = 4s, you get that s, the length of the side of the square, is 12
yards. Reconstructing the input gets a bit more challenging when the formula
contains two or more input variables.
The Problem: The area of a triangle is 20 square inches. If the lengths of the
base and height are whole numbers, then what are the base and height of this
triangle?
The area of a triangle is found with the formula A
bh
2
1
=
where b represents 
the length of the base of the triangle, and h represents the height of the trian-
gle. (The height is drawn from the base up to the vertex of the triangle and is
perpendicular to the base.) You find several possibilities for b and h that
result in an area of 20 using the formula. Because the product of b and h is
being multiplied by 1⁄2, the product must be 40 before it’s multiplied. Table
10-1 shows the possibilities resulting in an area of 20. Remember: The base
and height are whole numbers.

Each of the triangles given in the table has an area of 20 square inches.
Figure 10-3 shows you three of the triangles as examples. Notice how differ-
ent the shapes of the triangles are.
If you need to find out exactly which triangle the original 20 square inches
came from, then you need more information about the triangle. For example,
if you were told that the base was 6 inches longer than the height, then you
know that the base of 10 inches and the height of 4 inches were the original
input. In Chapter 13, you see how to write algebraic equations using this kind
of additional information to solve problems.
The Pythagorean theorem is a formula saying that a2 + b2 = c2. The Pythagorean
theorem gives the relationship between the three sides of a right triangle. The
letters a and b represent the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right trian-
gle, and the letter c represents the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side,
opposite the 90-degree angle) of a right triangle.
The Problem: What are the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle
if the hypotenuse is 25 cm? (You want only whole-number answers, no deci-
mal approximations.)

Using the Pythagorean theorem and replacing the c with 25, you get that a2 +

squares is 625. A table works well here (see Table 10-2). You solve for b in the

way up. Solving for b, you get b

Going the Distance with Formulas

between two points graphed in a coordinate system. A third distance for-
mula, s = –16t2 + vot + so, is actually a height formula, telling you how high
something is after it travels for a period of time. You get to experience all
three of these formulas here.
Distance, rate, and time are related to one another with a formula that says
distance = rate × time. The distance is usually given in terms of miles or feet or
inches. The rate is often in miles per hour, feet per second, or inches per
year. And the time is in hours, minutes, seconds, or years. In any case, the d =
rt formula is used to answer the questions: “How far have we gone?”, “Can
you step on it?”, or, my all-time favorite from the kids sitting in the backseat,
“Are we there yet?”
Solving for distance traveled
Depending on which distance formula you’re using, the input is quite differ-
ent. One distance formula inputs the rate and time. The second distance for-
mula inputs coordinates of points. And the third formula inputs just time. In
all three cases, the output is a distance measure.
Distance is rate times time
When using the d = rt formula, you need to watch out for the units. If the rate
is miles per hour, then you need to multiply by hours.
The Problem: How far has a car traveled if it averaged 40 mph for 21⁄2 hours
and then sped up to 55 mph for the next 45 minutes?

first distance that’s traveled at 40 mph and the second distance that’s traveled 
at 55 mph. The 45 minutes is changed to 60

hour. Computing the first 
distance, d = 40 mph × 2.5 hours = 100 miles. And the second distance is 
d = 55 miles per hour × 0.75 hours = 41.25 miles. Adding distances, 100 + 41.25 =
141.25 miles.
Multiplying miles per hour times hours or feet per second times seconds
results in the distance because the fractions reduce, cancelling out units, as
shown here.

The Problem: A glacier moves at the rate of 1.5 inches per month. How far
does it travel in 20 years?
You can either change the inches per month to inches per year, using a pro-
portion, or change 20 years to months and then use the formula. Instead of
changing to a number of months, it’s probably preferable to stay with years.
Changing 1.5 inches per month into inches per year, use the following 
proportion:

Finding the distance between two points
The formula for the distance between two points on a graph uses the x and
the y coordinates of the points. You find the difference between the pairs of
coordinates, square the differences, and add them together. Then take the
square root of the sum. The distance is in terms of units on the graph.

Crossing the bridge
During a war, there was a bridge between two
countries that was heavily guarded on the east
side. A sentry tower on the east side was
manned 24 hours a day. Every three minutes, a
guard would come out of the tower to check on
the bridge. His orders were to turn back anyone
who was trying to cross the bridge to come to
the east and to shoot anyone who was trying to
get out of the country on the east and go to the
west. A woman desperately wanted to get into
the western country. She knew that it would
take her five minutes to cross the bridge, but
she managed to do it. How did she cross from
the east to the west? (No, she didn’t swim.)
Answer: The lady started crossing the bridge to the west as soon as the
sentry went back into his tower. After 2 minutes and 50 seconds, she turned
around and started walking back to the east. The guard thought she was
coming from the West and ordered her to turn around and go back.

Finding the height of the ball
When a ball is tossed into the air, it has an initial velocity (the speed it’s trav-
eling at the very beginning) that slows down after time because of the pull of
gravity. The formula for the height of an object after a certain amount of time,
t, is s = –16t2 + vot + so where s is the height of the object, –16t2 represents the
effects of the pull of gravity after t amount of time, vo is the initial velocity,
and so is the initial height of the object.
The Problem: How high is a baseball 5 seconds after it’s hurled straight up into
the air by a pitching machine if the ball is, at first, traveling at 100 mph and the
pitching machine is sitting on the top of a building 30 feet up in the air?
The units in this problem are all over the place. The question involves sec-
onds; the rate is in miles and hours; and one of the dimensions is in feet.
First, change everything to seconds and feet. Then use the formula for the
height. To change the miles per hour to feet per second, multiply miles per
hour × hour per seconds × feet per mile. Notice how the units cancel to give
you the rate you want.

The rate is about 146.67 feet per second. Substituting all the information into
the formula for the height, s = –16(5)2 + 146.67(5) + 30 = –400 + 733.35 + 30 =
363.35 feet. After 5 seconds, the ball is 363.35 feet in the air. In case you’ve
ever considered taking calculus, here’s some further encouragement. In this
problem, calculus tells you that this ball is on its way back down after reach-
ing its highest point when t was equal to about 4.5 seconds. Now, don’t you
want to know more — and what else calculus can do for you?
Solving for rate or time
The distance formula, d = rt gives you the distance traveled when you know
how fast you’re traveling and how long it’s been since you started. With some
simple algebraic manipulations, you change the formula into a new formula
that gives you the speed when you have the distance and time, or you change
the formula to one that gives you time when you’re given the distance and
rate.
The following formulas are all derived from one another:

The Problem: Your friend shows up at your doorstep at 2 a.m. with baggage

Part II: Taking Charge of the Math 

The Problem: During that fabled race between the tortoise and the hare, a
ladybug was clinging to the back of the tortoise for the first 0.2 mile. The tor-
toise lumbered along at 3 feet per minute. As the hare passed by the tortoise,
the ladybug jumped onto the neck of the hare and traveled for the next 0.3
mile of the race at a rate of 50 feet per minute, until the hare decided to take
a nap. How long did the ladybug get to travel on these two racers before nap
time took over?
Find the two different times and add them together. The time that the lady-
bug spent on the tortoise is found by dividing 0.2 mile by 3 feet per minute.
Of course, first, the miles have to be changed to feet. Then find the amount of
time on the hare by dividing 0.3 mile by 50 feet per minute. Add the two times
together.
Changing 0.2 mile and 0.3 mile to feet, use the fact that 1 mile = 5,280 feet.

The distance formula s = –16t2 + vot + so gives you the height of an object when
you know how much time has elapsed. You determine the input, the amount
of time, by solving the quadratic equation for t.
The Problem: A toy rocket is shot into the air at 144 feet per second from the
top of a platform that’s 2 feet high. How long does it take for the rocket to
reach a height of 130 feet?

Chapter 10: Formulating a Plan with Formulas
Divided by the mighty Mississippi
The Mississippi River is the dividing line
between Tennessee and Arkansas. If an air-
plane crashed exactly in the middle of the
Mississippi River, where the distance between
the two banks is exactly the same, then where
would the survivors be buried?
Answer: This is an oldie but goodie. Goodness, you wouldn’t bury survivors!

Using the formula, and filling in 130 for s, 144 for vo, and 2 for so, the equation
becomes 130 = –16t2 + 144t + 8. Subtract 130 from each side of the equation,
and you get the quadratic equation 0 = –16t2 + 144t – 128. This equation fac-
tors into 0 = –16(t2 – 9t + 8) = –16(t–1)(t–8). Setting the two binomial factors
equal to 0, you get that t = 1 or t = 8. The question is: How long does it take for
the rocket to reach 130 feet? The answer is that it only takes 1 second. It then
goes higher until it turns back down toward the ground. At 8 seconds after
launching, the rocket is back down to 130 feet and eventually hits the ground
(assuming there’s no parachute attached).
Testing the Temperature
of Your Surroundings
Temperature is an important measure to everyone. When the snow is falling
and the wind blowing, it’s much too cold. When the sun is blazing and the air
not stirring, it’s too hot. If you want your pie to bake to a perfect golden
brown, you need the right setting on your oven. And if that isn’t enough,
more challenges arise when the thermometer is scaled in degrees Celsius
instead of Fahrenheit — or vice versa, depending on your choice of measure.
Changing from Fahrenheit to Celsius
The Fahrenheit temperature scale registers freezing at 32°F and boiling at
212°F, a difference of 180°. The Celsius scale (also called centigrade) has freez-
ing at 0°C and boiling at 100°C, a difference of 100°. The ratios of 180:100 and
100:180 are what make up a major part of the formulas for changing from one
temperature to another. The formula for converting Fahrenheit temperatures 
to Celsius temperatures is C

The Problem: A good friend of yours lives in England, and, when you told her
that it was 104° outside yesterday, she gasped and said that it just couldn’t
be. You remembered that she uses the Celsius system, so you converted the
temperature to one that she is more accustomed to. What new temperature
did you give her?

Cooling off with Newton’s Law
Newton’s Law of Cooling says that the greater the difference in temperature
of an object is from its surroundings, the more quickly the object’s tempera-
ture will change toward the surrounding temperature. For instance, when you
pour a cup of hot coffee and set it on the counter in a room that’s 72°F, the
coffee cools off much faster during the first few minutes than it does as it gets
closer to the temperature of the room. This is the same with heating (oppo-
site of cooling). Have you ever waited impatiently for that turkey to finish
cooking on Thanksgiving day? The last couple of degrees on the thermometer
always seem to take the longest — and they do!
143
Chapter 10: Formulating a Plan with Formulas

The formula for Newton’s Law of Cooling is: T (t) = Ta + (To – Ta) e–kt where T is
the temperature of the object after the amount of time t, Ta is the temperature
of the environment or room, To is the original temperature of the object, and
the multiplier e–kt has the number e which is about 2.71828 and the constant k
which changes, depending on the density of the object.
The Problem: You’ve just cooked your pizza in a 450°F oven. You take it out
and set it in a room that’s 72°F. For the density of this pizza, the constant, k,
in Newton’s Law of Cooling is 0.0843. What will the temperature of your pizza
be after five minutes? Will it be cool enough to eat?
Using Newton’s Law of Cooling, let the temperature, t, be 5, the initial temper-
ature of the pizza be 450°F, the temperature of the environment be 72°F, and
the value of k = 0.0843. Replacing all the letters in the formula with these
numbers and simplifying, you get:

ord problems in algebra are problems that seem to take on a life of
their own. You start out with a simple sentence in English and end up
with an equation that, you hope, will answer the question that’s been posed.
In this chapter, you see how to use word clues to convert from English sen-
tences to algebraic statements that can be solved and checked. The prob-
lems in this chapter aren’t really themed — they’re all over the place — but
they show how to put algebra to its best use.
Writing Equations Using
Number Manipulations
Basic number problems are like the riddles or brainteasers that your fifth-
grade teacher gave you to get you interested in doing numbers in your head.
Your teacher may have said: “I’m thinking of a number. If I double it and sub-
tract five, then I get a number that’s two more than the original number.” The
first member of your class to guess the number got a prize, like a new, spiffy-
doodle pencil. In this section, you find number problems like this. (Before
starting, you may want to refer back to Chapter 5 for a review of operations
and their corresponding words.)

Changing from words to math expressions
The word and is equivalent to addition; difference refers to subtraction. It’s
the variations on and the subtle use of these words that affect how the math-
ematical expression is written. Look at the following interpretations.
The sum of three times x and y
3x + y
Three times the sum of x and y
3(x + y)
The product of x and four more than y
x(y + 4)
Four more than the product of x and y
xy + 4
Five less than the sum of x and y
(x + y) – 5
Five minus the sum of x and y
5 – (x + y)
The sum of four and the square of x
4 + x2
The square of the sum of x and 4
(x + 4)2
Twice the square of the sum of six and y
2(6 + y)2
The square of the sum of six and twice y
(6 + 2y)2
The subtleties in the wording are important in the interpretation. The implied
grouping symbols need to be written when translated into mathematics. The
English language can be misinterpreted (in world relations, too, of course), so
it’s usually a good idea to use as many descriptive words as necessary to be
sure that your mathematical meaning is understood.
Solving equations involving one number
Many algebra word problems involve a single number and some operations
performed on it. The problems of this sort are good for practice in writing
algebraic equations, because you only need to worry about one unknown, or
variable. For simplicity, I’ll use x for the unknown.
The translations from word problems to algebraic problems have two stan-
dard rules:
 The variable always represents a number.
 The sentence is translated directly (in order) letting the verb be
replaced by an equal sign.
The Problem: The sum of a number and 12 is 18. What is the number?
148
Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

Let the number be represented by x. The word sum implies addition, so add
the x and 12. Put an equal sign after the sum and before the 18. The equation
you want reads: x + 12 = 18. Solving this linear equation, you subtract 12 from
each side to get x = 6. Now, check your answer. Replace a number in the prob-
lem with 6, and it now reads: The sum of 6 and 12 is 18. You got it!
The Problem: The sum of a number and 12 is twice the number. What is that
number?
This problem is different from the one earlier only in the result, or the value
on the right side of the equation sign. You write twice the number using 2x. So
this equation is written: x + 12 = 2x. Subtracting x from each side, you get that
12 = x. So, checking, “The sum of 12 and 12 is twice 12.” Well, sure! It just
sounded more complicated in math speak.
The Problem: The sum of a number and three more than twice the number is
36. What is the number?
The operation that’s suggested here is addition. You want the sum of a
number and some stuff. You now tackle the expression three more than twice
the number. The words more than suggests addition, too. So you write three
more than twice a number as 3 + 2x. Now, back to the original sentence, you
write x + (3 + 2x) to represent the sum of a number and three more than twice
the number. The parentheses aren’t really necessary. I just put them there to
emphasize the two different numbers in the sum. Writing the complete equa-
tion to replace the complete sentence: x + (3 + 2x) = 36. To solve this equa-
tion, you first combine the terms on the left and get 3x + 3 = 36. Now subtract
3 from each side, giving you 3x = 33. Dividing by 3, you get x = 11. Going back
to the original problem, you check to see if the sum of 11 and three more
than twice 11 is 36. Three more than twice 11 is 25. And the sum of 11 and 25
is, indeed, 36.
The Problem: When five is subtracted from twice a number, the result is two
more than the number. What is that number?
This equation has operations on each side. Letting the unknown number be
x, you write five subtracted from twice the number as 2x – 5. Notice the order
of the subtraction. You can’t reverse subtraction and get the same result.
Now, for the other side of the equation, you write two more than the number
as 2 + x. You could also have written x + 2, because addition is commutative
and can be written in either order. Putting the two parts together, you get the
equation 2x – 5 = 2 + x. Add 5 to each side and subtract x from each side to
get x = 7. Checking this with the original problem, you see that when 5 is sub-
tracted from twice 7, you subtract 5 from 14 and get 9. Two more than 7 is
also equal to 9. It checks. Do you recognize this problem? It’s the example I
accused your fifth-grade teacher of giving you (flip back to the first page of
this chapter).
149
Chapter 11: Solving Basic Number Problems

Comparing Two Numbers in a Problem
Number problems can contain situations involving one, two, or even more
different integers, whole numbers, or fractions. The more numbers you have
to solve for, the more interesting the problem becomes. Usually, when more
than one number is involved in one of these problems, there’s some sort of
relationship between the numbers — some mathematical comparison.
Chapter 12 is completely devoted to consecutive integers, so you’ll find other
types of problems here. Other problems requiring that you find two or more
solutions are solved with systems of equations. (You’ll find systems in
Chapter 17.)
Looking at the bigger, the smaller,
and the multiple
Children compare their bicycles or cookies or even their fathers by saying
that theirs is bigger or faster or smarter or whatever comes to mind.
Mathematical expressions take over where childish comparisons leave off,
using operations to combine and compare different numbers.
The Problem: I’m thinking of two numbers. One of the numbers is four less
than the other, and their sum is 100. What are the numbers?

Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 
How many goats?
Avery and Reid both are raising goats for a 4-H
project. Avery says to Reid, “If you let me have
one of your goats, then I’ll have twice as many
goats as what you have left.” Reid then counters
with, “If you let me have one of your goats, then
we’ll have the same number of goats.” How
many goats does each have right now?
Answer: Avery has seven goats, and Reid has five goats. The quickest way
to do this problem is by trial and error. (If the answer involved hundreds of
goats, then you may have wanted to use algebraic equations.) Start out by
letting Reid have two goats and Avery have one goat. If Reid gives Avery one
of his goats, then Avery will have two and Reid will have one. That takes care
of the first part of the problem, but it doesn’t work for the second part. Keep
trying numbers — increasing the number of goats for one, then the other,
until you stumble on the answer. Just keep track of which numbers you’ve
tried so you don’t repeat yourself. Use a system; be methodical.

Select a variable to represent one of the numbers, such as x. Now write an
expression, using the x, to describe the other number. Even though it may be
tempting to let the other number be represented by a new variable, y, you
stay with just one unknown or variable. Because the other number is four
less than the first, you can write the other number as x – 4. The sum of the
two numbers is 100, so write the sum of x and x – 4 as being equal to 100.
Your equation is x + (x – 4) = 100. Remove the parentheses and simplify the
expression on the left. 2x – 4 = 100. Now add 4 to each side, and you have 2x =
104. Divide by 2, and x = 52. The other number is four less than 52. So x – 4
becomes 52 – 4 = 48. The two numbers are 52 and 48.
What if you had decided, in the preceding problem, that the x should be the
smaller number, so the larger number is written as x + 4? Note that x is four less
than x + 4. How will that affect the answer? Try adding the numbers together
and solving for x. You get x + (x + 4) = 100, 2x + 4 = 100, 2x = 96, and x = 48. The
smaller number is 48, and the number four bigger than that is 52. You get the
same two numbers! As long as you write the relationship between the numbers
correctly, it really doesn’t matter which of the two you solve for first.
The Problem: Separate the number 20 into two parts so that five times the
smaller part plus eight is equal to the larger part. What are the two numbers?
One way to do this problem is to hope that the numbers are whole numbers
and make a list or chart, guessing what they may be. The number 20 is small
enough that a chart is reasonable. A more efficient way, though, is to use an
algebraic equation. You’d definitely choose the equation route if the two
numbers added up to 200 or 2,000 instead of a nice, civilized 20.
Let x be one of the parts. The sum of x and some other number is supposed
to be 20. So you can write the other number as 20 – x. (If the sum of two num-
bers is 20, and one of the numbers is 7, then the other number is 20 – 7 = 13.)
Now you have the two parts of 20, x, and 20 – x. Back to the problem. The
problem says to multiply 5 times the smaller part. You choose the smaller
part to be x. Yes, you can do that! Writing five times the smaller part plus eight,
you get 5x + 8. This sum is equal to the larger part (the other number), so
your equation becomes 5x + 8 = 20 – x. To solve the equation, add x to each
side and subtract 8 from each side to get 6x = 12. Now divide each side, and
you get that x = 2. If the number 2 is one part of 20, then the other is 20 – 2 =
18. Does this check with the original problem? Is 5 × 2 + 8 equal to 18? Doing
the math, 5(2) + 8 = 10 + 8 = 18. By golly, it works!
The Problem: One number is three less than two times another number, and
their sum is 21. What are the numbers?
151
Chapter 11: Solving Basic Number Problems

Choose x to be one of the numbers, and then write the other number using
mathematical operations to express how they compare. If the second number
is three less than two times x, you write that as 2x – 3. Notice that the 3 is sub-
tracted from the 2x. So now you have the two numbers, x and 2x – 3. The sum
of the two numbers is 21. The equation expressing this is x + (2x – 3) = 21.
Combine the terms on the left to get 3x – 3 = 21. Add 3 to each side, and the
equation becomes 3x = 24. Divide by 3, and x = 8. The number 8 and another
number are supposed to add up to 21. That other number has to be 13. Is the
number 13 equal to three less than twice 8? Yes, 2(8) – 3 = 16 – 3 = 13.
Varying the problems with variation
The word variation has a special definition in mathematics. When two num-
bers vary directly, it means that one of the numbers is a direct multiple of the
other. The numbers 7 and 21 vary directly, because 21 is three times 7. When
two numbers vary inversely, it means that one number is some multiple of the
reciprocal of the other.
If y varies directly with x, then y = kx, where k is some constant.
If y varies inversely with x, then y
xk
=
, where k is some constant.
The usual situation with variation problems is that you’ll be told that two
numbers vary either directly or inversely with a specific result. Then you
have to figure out what that particular variation is and how it applies to
another number.
Varying directly
When two values vary directly, then one of the numbers is a multiple of the
other. You need to determine what the multiplier (the value of the constant,
k) is. Formulas and applications from the sciences often use direct variation.
The Problem: If y varies directly with x, and y is equal to 20 when x is equal
to 5, then what is the value of y when x is 2?

By special arrangement
What is so special about the following sequence
of numbers? 8, 5, 4, 9, 1, 7, 6, 10, 3, 2, 0
Answer: They’re in alphabetical order!

First solve the direct variation equation y = kx for the value of k, the constant
that is particular to this problem. Substituting the values of y and x that are
given, you get 20 = k5. Dividing each side of the equation by 5, you find that
k = 4. Now rewrite the relationship equation as y = 4x. When x is 2, you solve
for y by putting 2 into the formula. y = 4 × –2 = 8. When x is 2, y is 8.
The Problem: If the square of y varies directly with the cube of x, and if y is
equal to 3 when x is equal to 2, then what is the value of x when y is 24?
The variation equation is written y2 = kx3, and you solve for k by solving the
equation (3)2 = k(2)3. You get that 9 = 8k. Dividing each side of the equation 
by 8, you see that k

The Problem: The volume of a sphere varies directly with the cube of its
radius. If a sphere with a radius of 3 yards has a volume of about 113.10 cubic
yards, then what is the volume of a sphere that has a radius of 5 yards?
The variation equation is V = kr3, where V represents the volume of the
sphere and r represents the radius. Using the values given, rewrite the equa-
tion as 113.10 = k(3)3 or 113.10 = 27k. Dividing each side by 27, k is about 4.19.
Now the relationship between the volume of a sphere and its radius is written
V = 4.19r3 . Replacing the radius, r, with 5, you get V = 4.19(5)3 = 4.19(125) =
523.75 cubic yards.

where the attendant offered the following: “If I
write your exact weight on this piece of paper,
then you have to give me 25¢. If I can’t do
that, then I’ll give you $1.” The boy was pretty
confident, so he said, “You’re on!” The atten-
dant took a slip of paper, wrote something on it,
and gave it to the boy. The boy paid him the 25¢.
What was on the paper?
Answer: The attendant had written: “Your exact weight.”

Squaring Off Using Quadratic Equations
A quadratic equation has a squared term in it. For instance, x2 + 2x – 3 = 0 is a
quadratic equation. An interesting feature of these equations is that many
quadratic equations have two completely different solutions. In the equation
x2 + 2x – 3 = 0, x is equal to either +1 or –3. Either number works. Number
problems using quadratic equations in their solutions may or may not use
both answers. After solving the problem, you go back and look at the original
question to see if both answers make sense.

Stefanie was hired to paint the numbers on the
doors of the offices in a new academic building.
There are 100 offices, numbered 1 through 100.
How many times did Stefanie have to paint the

Answer: Did you remember to include the 9s in the nineties? She had to paint
the number 9 a total of 20 times: 9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93,

Doubling your pleasure, doubling your fun
Number problems that need two answers or end up with two solutions have
to be checked carefully. The equations used when solving these number
problems frequently involve expressions relating one of the numbers to the
other number using mathematical operations.
The Problem: The sum of a number and eight times its reciprocal is 6. What
are the two numbers?
First write expressions for the number and its reciprocal. Letting x be the 
number, then its reciprocal is x1 . Multiplying that reciprocal by 8, 
x

Now write an equation that represents the sentence exactly. The word sum
indicates that the number and its reciprocal are added. The word is indicates
where the equal sign goes. The equation you write is x
x8
6
+
=
. Multiply 
each term in the equation by x, and the quadratic equation x2 + 8 = 6x
emerges. Subtract 6x from each side to set the equation equal to 0.
When solving a quadratic equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, you either
factor the expression and set the factors equal to 0 to solve for x, or you use
the quadratic formula. (You’ll find the quadratic formula in the Cheat Sheet.)
The quadratic equation x2 – 6x + 8 = 0 factors into (x – 2)(x – 4) = 0. Setting the
factor x – 2 = 0, you get that x = 2. Setting the factor x – 4 = 0, you get the
answer x = 4. Each answer needs to be checked. Is the sum of 2 and eight 
times its reciprocal equal to 6? Checking this out, 2

The Problem: The sum of two numbers is 7 and the sum of the squares of the
two numbers is 29. What are the numbers?
You first write the two numbers in terms of the same unknown or variable. If
the first number is x, then the other number is 7 – x. How did I pull the 7 – x
out of my hat? Think about two numbers having a sum of 7. If one of them is 5,
then the other is 7 – 5, or 2. If one of them is 3, then the other number is 7 – 3,
or 4. Sometimes, when you do easy problems in your head, it’s hard to figure
out how to write what you’re doing in math speak. So, if the two numbers are
x and 7 – x, then you have to square each of them, add them together, and set
the sum equal to 29. The equation to use is x2 + (7 – x)2 = 29. To solve this
equation, you square the binomial, combine like terms, subtract 29 from each
side, factor the quadratic equation, and then set each of the factors equal to 0.

When x – 2 = 0, you get that x = 2. Subtracting 7 – 2 for the other number, you
get 5. The square of 2 is 4, and the square of 5 is 25. The sum of 4 and 25 is 29,
so the 2 works. You don’t have to check the other solution from the quadratic
equation, because x – 5 = 0 gives you the number 5. Both solutions work and
are just repeats of one another. But sometimes the numbers that appear as
the two solutions aren’t the two numbers that answer the problem.
The Problem: The product of two integers is 48, and one of the integers is
two less than the other. What are the two numbers?
If one of the numbers in the product is x, then the other number is x48 . 
Writing that one number is two less than the other, you can either write an
equation where one of the numbers equals the other minus 2 or where one is
equal to the other plus 2. It doesn’t really matter, because you’d be writing a
statement making one side two more than the other. One equation you may 
use to solve this problem is x

If you let x – 8 = 0, you get that x = 8. 
The other number is found by dividing 48 by 8, so you get that the other
number is 6. And the number 6 is 2 less than 8. The other factor of the equa-
tion gives you that x + 6 = 0. The value of x this time is –6. The –6 doesn’t
work with the 8, because the product of –6 and 8 is –48, and the two numbers
are different by 14, not 2. But what about the –6? If it’s one of the numbers,
then dividing 48 by –6 you get –8. The product of –6 and –8 is 48, and the –8 is
two less than –6. So there are two different sets of answers, each with the two
numbers required.

Disposing of the nonanswers
Quadratic equations may yield two different answers. Sometimes both
answers work in a word problem. But in some instances, only one works or
neither of the answers actually answers the question. Just because you can
solve a quadratic equation for a correct answer to the equation, it doesn’t
mean that what you get will solve the original question. The question may be
unsolvable.
The Problem: The square of a positive number is six more than five times
that number. What is the number?
Let the number be represented by x. The square of x is written x2. The expres-
sion six more than five times the number is written 6 + 5x. Put an equal sign
between the two expressions, to represent the is, and you have x2 = 6 + 5x.
Subtracting 6 and 5x from each side, x2 – 5x – 6 = 0 factors into (x – 6)(x + 1) =
0. When x – 6 = 0, you get the answer 6. The number 6 squared is 36, and six
more than five times 6 is 6 + 30 = 36. The other factor gives you that x + 1 = 0,
or x = –1. You don’t consider this answer, because the problem asks for a pos-
itive number. This problem has just the one answer.
The Problem: One positive integer is three more than twice another positive
integer, and the difference of their squares is nine. What are they?

Guessing the money in the box
A new television game show starts out by elim-
inating contestants from the audience by having
them guess the amount of money in four differ-
ent boxes. One hundred contestants are shown
the four boxes and told to guess which box has
$1, which has $5, which has $1,000, and which
has $10,000. Those who guess all four boxes
correctly get to come on stage for round two.
When the entries are tallied, the game-show
host announces that 50 people have none cor-
rect, 20 people have one correct guess, and 15
people have two correct. Those who got three
correct would be given $100 each, and those
who got all four correct would get to come up
on stage to compete again. How many people
got to come up on stage?
Answer: No one could have gotten three correct, if they guessed a different
amount of money for each box. If they missed one, then they had to miss two
(switch the boxes). So 15 people went up on stage for round two (100 – 50 –
20 – 15 = 15).

The two numbers are represented by x and 3 + 2x. Their squares are x2 and 
(3 + 2x)2. Their difference can be written as either x2 – (3 + 2x)2 or (3 + 2x)2 – x2.
Either works. I’m going to use the second version, because I don’t want to
have to distribute the negative sign over the three terms in the square of the
binomial. Writing that the difference is equal to 9, (3 + 2x)2 – x2 = 9.

Chapter 12
Charting Consecutive Integers
In This Chapter
 Creating lists of consecutive integers from descriptions
 Focusing on consecutive odds and evens
 Solving for one of several in a list
 Applying consecutive integers to practical problems
You became familiar with your first list of consecutive integers when you
were taught to count. You may not remember when you held up fingers
and counted, “One, two, three. . . .” But we all did it — except maybe Einstein,
who probably counted by threes.
In this chapter, you find consecutive integers, consecutive even integers, con-
secutive multiples of fives, and so on. The word problems come in as puzzles
to find the first, the middle, or the last in a list of consecutive integers. After
an introduction on ways to find the sum of a large number of consecutive
numbers, you’ll see some interesting applications from seating charts to
orchards.
Adding Up Sets of Consecutives
A list of consecutive integers may be one of the following:
 3, 4, 5, 6, 7: Five consecutive integers starting with 3
 –12, –10, –8, –6: Four consecutive even integers ending with –6
 15, 20, 25, 30, 35: Five consecutive multiples of 5 starting with 15
 0, 4, 8, 12, 16: Five consecutive multiples of 4, with middle 8
Any list of consecutive integers can be described in many different ways. You
may give the overall pattern that describes how far apart the numbers in the
list are, and then you give one of the numbers in the list and its position. Or

you may give the rule on how far apart the numbers are and then some char-
acteristic of the list. You may give the first and last numbers and tell how
many are in the list. All you need is enough information to distinguish your
list from any others.
Writing the list algebraically
A list of consecutive integers consists of numbers that are all the same dis-
tance apart. You structure the distance apart by adding some constant value
repeatedly, until you have the desired number of integers in the list. For
example, if you want a list of the first six multiples of 3, starting with the
number 0, you find the numbers by starting with 0, then adding 3 to 0 to get
3, then adding another 3 to 3 to get 6, and so on. Here’s how to create that
list: 0, 0 + 3, 0 + 3 + 3, 0 + 3 + 3 + 3, 0 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3, 0 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3.
Simplifying these terms, I write them: 0, 0 + 3, 0 + 6, 0 + 9, 0 + 12, 0 + 15. You’re
probably wondering why I can’t take that final leap and add the zeros in.
You’ll see my point shortly.
When writing a list of consecutive integers, you let the first integer in the list be
signified with a variable. Some people like to use x, because that’s the universal
unknown or variable. In this chapter, you see a consistent use of another vari-
able, n. Using n for consecutive integers is pretty standard notation, too.
So, if the first integer in the list is n, then the next integer in the list is n +
something. The something is that common difference between the terms in
the list. Writing a list of any six multiples of 3, I start with n, then n + 3, n + 6,
n + 9, n + 12, and finally n + 15. You see that the list hinges on two things:
 That the terms are all the same distance apart
 That the first integer is what you say it is
I declared, here, that n is a multiple of 3. I can do that! You can do that!
Following are more examples of the algebraic representation of lists of con-
secutive integers. You choose the number for n, and the rest fall in line. Of
course, if you want even integers, you have to pick an even integer for n:
 n, n + 2, n + 4, n + 6: Four consecutive even integers
 n, n + 2, n + 4, n + 6: Four consecutive odd integers (Yes, this list can be
even or odd. It all depends on what that first n is.)
 n, n + 5, n + 10, n + 15: Four consecutive multiples of 5
 n, n + 14, n + 28: Three consecutive multiples of 14
 n, n + 1, n + 2, n + 3, n + 4: Five consecutive integers
160
Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

Reconstructing a list
When solving consecutive integer problems, you solve for n and use that
value to answer some question about the list or some number on that list.
For example, assume that you’ve solved an equation and found that n = 4.
Using that value of n, you can then reconstruct a list of numbers by substitut-
ing in the 4 for the n’s. Or you can answer a question about the third number
in the list or some such thing.
If n = 4 and you’re trying to find three consecutive integers, then your three
integers are: 4, 5, and 6.
If n = 4 and your goal is to find five consecutive even integers, then your five
integers are: 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.
If n = 4 is what you got, and you want to find three consecutive multiples of 4,
then your three integers are: 4, 8, and 12.
If n = 4 is the solution of your equation, and you want the second number in
the list of consecutive multiples of 4, then your answer is: 8.
And if the answer n = 4 is what you get when you solve an equation to find
four consecutive odd integers, then you’ve done something wrong — or the
problem was written incorrectly. The number 4 isn’t odd. When the equations
are set up and solved correctly, you get a number belonging to the category
you want.
Writing up sums and solving them
Consecutive integer problems have a common theme: Take a list of consecu-
tive integers, perform a certain operation, and you get a numerical result.
When writing the equations needed to solve these problems, you use a fairly
common pattern: Let n represent the first number in the list, let n + d (where
d is the common difference) be the second number, let n + 2d be the third
number, and so on. The most common operation performed in these prob-
lems is addition — so add ’em up.
The Problem: The sum of three consecutive integers is 45. What are the 
integers?
Write the three integers symbolically as: n, n + 1, and n + 2. Now write the
three numbers all added together and set them equal to 45: n + (n + 1) + (n +
2) = 45. Drop the parentheses, and combine the terms on the left to get 3n + 3
= 45. Subtract 3 from each side, and 3n = 42. Divide each side by 3, and you
get n = 14. The three consecutive integers with a sum of 45 are 14, 15, and 16.
161
Chapter 12: Charting Consecutive Integers

The Problem: The sum of four consecutive integers is 38. What is the largest
number?
Write the four integers symbolically as: n, n + 1, n + 2, and n + 3 . Add them up,
and let the sum be equal to 38. n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) + (n + 3) = 38. Simplifying
the terms on the left, the equation becomes 4n + 6 = 38. Subtract 6 from each
side to get 4n = 32. Dividing each side by 4, you get n = 8. So the four terms are
8, 9, 10, and 11. The largest of the four consecutive integers is 11.
The Problem: The sum of eight consecutive integers is 4. What is their 
product?
You may think that there’s been some error here. How can eight consecutive
integers add up to a number smaller than the number of integers? The
answer to that question is: “Negative numbers.” Keep that in mind as you
answer the question posed in this problem.
Write the eight consecutive integers as n, n + 1, n + 2, n + 3, n + 4, n + 5, n + 6,
and n + 7. Adding them all up, you get n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) + (n + 3) + (n + 4) +
(n + 5) + (n + 6) + (n + 7) = 4. Simplifying, the equation becomes 8n + 28 = 4.
Subtract 28 from each side, and the equation 8n = –24 is ready to have each
side divided by 8. With n = –3, the eight terms are: –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Multiplying all the terms together, you get that the product is 0, because one
of the terms is 0.
Looking At Consecutive Multiples
Consecutive integers are lists of integers that have a common difference
between the terms. Odd and even numbers have a common difference of 
two between each term. Multiples of three have a common difference of 
three between the consecutive terms, and so on.
Working with evens and odds
The hardest part of doing problems involving consecutive even and consecu-
tive odd integers is accepting the fact that the expressions for consecutive
even and consecutive terms are the same. If you say that n, n + 2, n + 4, and n
+ 6 are four consecutive even numbers, and that n = 10, then you just add 2, 4,
and 6 to the 10 and get 12, 14, and 16. Now, take the same four numbers, n, n
+ 2, n + 4, and n + 6, and say that they’re all odd numbers. Letting n = 11 this
time, you see that when you add 2 to 11 you get 13. Adding 4 gives you 15,
and adding 6 gives you 17. It’s the value of n that sets the pattern.
162

The Problem: The sum of four consecutive odd numbers is 64. What are the

First write the four numbers symbolically as n, n + 2, n + 4, and n + 6. Adding
them together and setting the sum equal to 64, n + (n + 2) + (n + 4) + (n + 6) =
64. Simplifying the equation, you get 4n + 12 = 64. Subtract 12 from each side,
giving you 4n = 52. Dividing each side of the equation by 4, n = 13. The other
odd numbers are 15, 17, and 19.
The Problem: The sum of five consecutive even integers is 100. What is the
difference between the largest and the smallest of these integers?
The five consecutive even integers are written as n, n + 2, n + 4, n + 6, and n +
8. Adding them together and setting the sum equal to 100, n + (n + 2) + (n + 4)
+ (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 100. Simplifying the equation, 5n + 20 = 100. Subtract 20
from each side to get 5n = 80. Dividing each side by 5, you get that n = 16.
Rather than list the five integers, just find the largest even integer in the list
by using n + 8 where n = 16. Since 16 + 8 = 24, you know that the largest inte-
ger is 24 and the smallest is 16. The difference between the two integers is 8.
In the previous problem, you really didn’t need to find the even numbers in
the list. If you have five consecutive even integers, they’re always n, n + 2, n +
4, n + 6, and n + 8, no matter what n is. The difference between the largest and
the smallest is (n + 8) – n = 8.
Expanding to larger multiples
Pick a number, and you can make a list of integers that are multiples of that
number. You can also make a symbolic list (using math symbols) of integers
that are multiples of a number by starting with n and adding the number
repeatedly. For example, a list of six consecutive multiples of 7, starting with
63 is: 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98. Symbolically, a list of any six multiples of 7 is: n, n +
7, n + 14, n + 21, n + 28, n + 35.
The Problem: The sum of four consecutive multiples of 5 is 210. What is the
largest of the four multiples?
Write the four integers as n, n + 5, n + 10, and n + 15. Add them up and set the
sum equal to 210. The equation is: n + (n + 5) + (n + 10) + (n + 15) = 210.
Simplifying on the left, the equation becomes 4n + 30 = 210. Subtract 30 from
each side, and the equation 4n = 180 is solved by dividing both sides by 4.
The value of n = 45. The original question asks for the largest of these consec-
utive integers. From the list of integers, the largest is n + 15. So, if n = 45, then
n + 15 = 45 + 15 = 60. Or, another approach is to just write the four multiples
of 5, starting with 45: 45, 50, 55, 60. That’s a nice way to check your work.
163
Chapter 12: Charting Consecutive Integers

The Problem: The sum of five consecutive multiples of 3 is 15. What is the
product of the largest two of the numbers?
Write the five integers as n, n + 3, n + 6, n + 9, and n + 12. Adding them
together and setting the sum equal to 15, you get 5n + 30 = 15. Subtract 30
from each side and divide by 5 to get 5n = –15 and n = –3. The two largest
numbers in the list of consecutive integers are found with n + 9 and n + 12,
making them equal to 6 and 9. The product of 6 and 9 is 54.
Operating on consecutive integers
Consecutive integers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided. Many
interesting problems come from performing various operations on the inte-
gers and not just limiting yourself to addition. Also, consecutive integers can
be squared and cubed and more, before being combined in some fashion —
just to mix things up a bit.
Doing more than addition to consecutive integers
One nice thing about just adding consecutive integers is that you always have
a linear equation to solve. The equations formed from adding consecutive
integers all seem to boil down to something in the form ax + b = c, which is
solved by subtracting and dividing. But, on the other hand, isn’t it nice that
some other types of equations, such as quadratic equations, are created as
soon as other operations arrive on the scene?
The Problem: The product of two consecutive integers is 20. What are the
integers?
Write the two consecutive integers as n and n + 1. Multiply them together and
set the equation equal to 20. You get a quadratic equation that’s solved by
setting the equation equal to 0, factoring, and solving for the numbers.

The quadratic equation gives you two different answers. When n = 4, you get
the two consecutive integers 4 and 5. The product of 4 and 5 is, indeed, 20.
But what about the solution n = –5? If n = –5, then n + 1 = –5 + 1 = –4. The prod-
uct of –5 and –4 is also 20. This problem has two different solutions. As long
as you’re happy with negative integers, too, then you accept both sets of
answers.

The Problem: The product of two positive consecutive odd integers is 143.
What are the integers?
The product of the two consecutive odd integers is written as n(n + 2). Set

dratic equation that results.

The solution n = 11 is used to find the other odd integer by adding 2. The two
consecutive integers are 11 and 13. You don’t bother with the solution n =
–13, because the problem specifies that you’re to find positive integers.
Working with consecutive squares and cubes
The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 are four consecutive integers. The numbers 1, 4, 9,
and 16 are four consecutive squares of those first four numbers. And the
cubes of the same four numbers are 1, 8, 27, and 64. Squares and cubes of
consecutive numbers are squared and cubed, respectively, before being
added together or having some other operation performed upon them.
The Problem: The sum of the squares of two consecutive integers is 145.
What are the numbers?
First write the two consecutive integers as n and n + 1. The squares of those
two numbers are n2 and (n + 1)2. To write the equation, add the two squares
together and set them equal to 145. Then do the squaring on the left, com-
bine like terms, subtract 145 from each side to set the equation equal to 0,
and solve the quadratic equation.

When n = 8, then n + 1 = 9. The sum of their squares is 64 + 81 = 145. The
other solutions works as well. When n = –9, then n + 1 = –8. Their squares are
81 and 64 and also have a sum of 145.

The Problem: The difference between the cubes of two consecutive numbers
is 127. What are the numbers?
First write the cubes of the numbers as n3 and (n + 1)3. Subtract the smaller
number from the larger number and set the difference equal to 127. The equa-
tion you write is (n + 1)3 – n3 = 127. Now cube the binomial and simplify the
terms on the left. The resulting equation is quadratic, which factors and
yields two solutions.

When n = 6, you get 6 and 7 whose cubes are 216 and 343, respectively. The
difference between their cubes is 127. When n = –7, you get –7 and –6 whose
cubes are –343 and –216. Subtracting –216 – (–343) you also get 127.
The expansion of the binomial (n + 1)3 results in a polynomial where the co-
efficients of the terms have a distinctive, symmetric pattern. Refer to the
Cheat Sheet for some of the other powers of a binomial. You’ll see that the
cube of (n + 1) has coefficients in the 1-3-3-1 pattern.
Finding Sums of Sequences of Integers
A sequence of numbers is a list of numbers created by a particular pattern or
mathematical rule. An arithmetic sequence is a list of numbers in which there
is a common difference between the consecutive numbers in the sequence. So
consecutive integers are a special type of arithmetic sequence. The rule that
allows you to add up any number of terms in an arithmetic sequence also lets
you solve some problems involving the sums of consecutive integers.
Setting the stage for the sums
Before applying the rule for the sum of a certain number of terms in an arith-
metic sequence, you need to be able to find the nth term in a sequence when
166
Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

given the first term or find the n when given the first and last terms. Then you
can apply the general rule for the sum of the terms.
Finding the nth term or finding the difference
The nth term of an arithmetic sequence may be the fourth term or the tenth
term or any number of term. You don’t want to have to list the first 99 terms
in order to find the hundredth term, so the following rule comes in handy.
The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is an, which is equal to a1 + d(n – 1),
where a1 is the first term and d is the difference between each of the terms in
the sequence.
You use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, an = a1 + d(n –
1), to find a particular term in the sequence.
The Problem: In the sequence of terms beginning with 7 and with a common
difference of 5, what is the tenth term in that sequence?
Using the formula and replacing d with 5 and n with 10, a10 = 7 + 5(10 – 1) = 7 +
5(9) = 7 + 45 = 52. You can check this answer, because you only have ten
terms to worry about. Here are the first ten terms of the sequence: 7, 12, 17,
22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47, 52. Yes, the tenth term is 52. You want to be sure that the
formula works when the sequence has 100 or 1,000 terms.
The Problem: If the first term of an arithmetic sequence is 3 and the 50th
term is 297, then what is the common difference between the terms?
Using the formula for finding the nth term, you fill in values for everything
except the difference and then solve for that difference. The equation is writ-
ten 297 = 3 + d(50 – 1). Simplifying on the right, the equation becomes 297 =
3 + 49d. Subtract 3 from each side for 294 = 49d. Dividing each side of the
equation by 49, you get that d = 6.
Summing up the terms
The generalized formula for the sum of any number of terms of an arithmetic
sequence allows you to add up the terms no matter where you start and
where you stop in the sequence.
The sum of n terms of an arithmetic sequence is equal to half n times the sum
of the first and last terms of the sequence.

. Do you wonder what those terms are? You find them by using
the formula for the nth term. Using 60 = 15 + d(16 – 1) which becomes 60 =
15 + 15d, 45 = 15d, or d = 3. So the numbers are 15, 18, 21, 24, . . . 57, 60. (Okay,
I was curious about the numbers but not interested enough to write out all 16
of them.)
The Problem: If the sum of the ten terms in an arithmetic sequence is 1,135
and if the difference between the terms is 3, then what are the first and last
terms?
First, write the first and last terms in an expression that relates one to the
other. The tenth term is a10 = a1 + 3(10 – 1) = a1 + 27, using the formula found
in Finding the nth term or finding the difference. Now use the sum formula,
replacing each letter in the formula with its equivalent.

Finding the sums of consecutive integers
In most consecutive integer problems, you’re given the sum of a certain
number of integers and told to figure out what those integers were that gave
you a particular sum. For a change of pace, in the problems in this section,
it’s the sums that you compute. And, because the problems involve lots and
lots of consecutive integers, you find the formulas to be very nice.
The Problem: Find the sum of the 20 consecutive multiples of 4 that begin
with the number 60.
168
Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

The formula for finding the sum of a list of consecutive integers requires that
you have the first and last terms in the list. The multiples of 4 are all four
units apart. You have an arithmetic sequence with terms the difference of
which is 4. (You can find more on arithmetic sequences in “Setting the stage
for the sums,” earlier in this chapter.) So, to find the 20th term in the list of
multiples of 4 that start with 60, use the formula an = a1 + d(n – 1), giving you
that a20 = 60 + 4(20 – 1) = 60 + 4(19) = 60 + 76 = 136. Now, using the formula
for the sum of the terms, and letting 60 be the first term and 136 be the
20th term,

Applying Consecutive Integers
Adding up lists of numbers is always a huge amount of fun — or not. It
depends on what you like to do with your leisure time, I suppose. When for-
mulas are available to make arithmetic computations easier and more accu-
rate, you jump at the chance to use those formulas. Here I give you some
applications of sums of consecutive integers.
Adding up building blocks
A child’s set of building blocks usually consists of many wooden cubes — all
the same size and decorated with letters of the alphabet, numbers, animals,
or different colors. A typical stacking exercise involves making a row of
blocks, with each block touching the one next to it, and then making a row on

Answer: It’s called a dictionary.

top of that first row where each block in the second row straddles two blocks
beneath it (it sits on the crack between the two blocks). In this way, as more
rows are added, each row has one less block than the row it’s sitting on.
The Problem: Little Jimmy is stacking his cube-shaped blocks. His first row
has 20 blocks, and each subsequent row has one block less than the one
below. If there are 250 blocks in Jimmy’s set, will he have enough blocks to
build a structure all the way up to one block on the top?
Find the sum of the consecutive integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . 19, 20 by using the
formula for the sum of consecutive integers. The first term is 1; the last term
is 20; and the number of terms, n, is 20. Compare that sum with the number
of blocks to see if Jimmy will have enough blocks.

Jimmy has more than enough blocks. In fact, he’ll probably throw those extra
blocks at his brother.
Finding enough seats
In most theaters, you have more seats in the rows toward the back and fewer
seats in the rows up front as the room narrows toward the stage. Imagine
having to clean up after a performance attended by a rowdy bunch of chil-
dren who were all given huge bags of popcorn. You need to plan the amount
of time needed to do the job.
The Problem: The theater at a local civic center has 13 seats in the first 3
rows, 15 seats in the next 3 rows, and the number of seats increases by 2
seats every third row until there are a total of 45 rows in the theater. How
many seats are there?
Because the number of seats in a row is repeated three times, just figure out
how many seats in one of each of those different rows and multiply the result
by three. With 45 rows total, then there are 15 different numbers of seats in
the rows (45 ÷ 3 = 15). The first row has 13 seats, and the number of seats per
row increases by 2, so the number of seats per row is: 13, 15, 17, 19. . . . The
15th different row has a1 + d(n – 1) = 13 + 2(15 – 1) = 41 seats. The sum of the
15 numbers starting with 13 and ending with 41 is:

If there were just one of each of these 15 different rows, you’d have 405 seats.
But there are 45 rows — 3 of each of those 15 different ones. Multiplying 405
by 3, you get 405 × 3 = 1,215 seats all together.
Laying bricks for a stairway
Stairways to monuments get a lot of wear and tear, so paving bricks are used,
because they can take all the punishment of many feet over many years.
The Problem: A brick stairway to a monument has 40 steps. The first step has
250 bricks, and each successive step has 3 fewer bricks. How many bricks are
in the last step, and how many total bricks are there in the stairway?
You use the formula for the nth term of a sequence of numbers letting the 
difference be –3. So the 40th step has a1 + d(n – 1) = 250 – 3(40 – 1) = 133
bricks. The sum of the bricks in the 40 steps, going from 250 bricks down 
to 133 bricks, is

his chapter contains lots of rules, hints, tidbits, and procedures for you
to use when changing from the written language to letters — variables
that represent the unknown quantity — and operations in the mathematical
language. The equations you write are usually quite easy to solve — after you
manage to write them.
Changing from words to equations involves identifying what the variables
(the x’s or y’s or t’s) represent and how to arrange them in an equation.
Solving an equation requires algebraic know-how, but, if your equation is non-
sense or doesn’t fit the problem, then the answer to the equation will get you
no closer to the answer to the problem than you were before you started.
You’ll see how sometimes more than one option exists for writing an equa-
tion. Sometimes one way is better than another. Other times it makes no dif-
ference which format you use. And, unfortunately, you’ll see that some
problems are just unsolvable — no method or means will ever answer the
question.
This chapter also allows me to cover some word-problem topics that just
don’t seem to fit anywhere else. You can call this the miscellaneous chapter —
it contains word problems that you’re likely to come across but that don’t
have any particular place with all the others. These problems are great for
illustrating some more of the techniques that are helpful when solving math
word problems.

Assigning the Variable
When translating from the written language to an algebraic equation, one rule
that absolutely must be followed is that the variable (letter) that you choose
to solve for in the equation has to represent a number. The letter x might rep-
resent Jack’s age or the number of chickens in the yard, but the x can’t repre-
sent Jack or the chickens themselves. Getting past this hurdle (of assigning
the variable to be a number) sets you off on the right track toward solving an
equation and answering a question.
After you’ve solved an equation for the value of the variable, then you either
have the answer directly or you may have to do some additional steps to
completely answer the question that’s been posed.
Getting the answer directly 
from the variable
It’s always nicest to have the answer just plopped in your lap as soon as you
come up with the solution to an equation. It isn’t always possible to easily
create equations that behave this way, but, when you can, take advantage of
the situation.
The Problem: Ken, Kyle, and Keith worked on a project and kept track of how
much time each spent. They determined that the total was 48 hours. Keith
worked 3 hours longer than Ken, and Kyle worked 9 hours less than Keith.
How many hours did Ken work?
To have this problem work out so that the solution of the equation is the
answer of the question, you let the variable represent the number of hours
that Ken worked. Then you write the number of hours that Kyle and Keith
worked in terms of Ken’s hours. If you let x represent the number of hours
that Ken worked, then x + 3 represents the number of hours that Keith
worked. Using Keith’s hours, you write that the number of hours that
Kyle worked is x + 3 – 9 = x – 6 hours. The total number of hours is 48, 
so x + (x + 3) + (x – 6) = 48. Simplifying on the left, you get 3x – 3 = 48. Add 3
to each side, and the equation becomes 3x = 51. Dividing by 3, x = 17. So Ken
worked for 17 hours. To check the answer, just figure out how many hours
Keith and Kyle worked, and see if the sum is 48. Keith worked three hours
longer than Ken, so Keith worked for 20 hours. Kyle worked nine hours less
than Keith, so he worked for 11 hours. The men worked for 17 + 20 + 11 hours
which is, indeed, 48 hours.

The Problem: It cost $12 for a man to drive his van to work every day, but he
had passengers, so he divided this cost equally among the passengers and
himself. After a few weeks, two more passengers were added, which reduced
everyone’s cost by $1 per day. How many people are now riding in the van?
Look at the last sentence and the final question: “How many people . . . ?”
To have the solution of the equation come out to be the final answer, you
let the variable, x, be equal to the number of passengers now riding in the
van. The cost per person now is $1 less than it used to be, so the equation
you write will be something to the effect that $12 divided by the number
of riders now is equal to $1 less than $12 divided by the number of
riders that there used to be. Math speak is much easier to write:

Chapter 13: Writing Equations Using Algebraic Language
Fly away fly
I’m sitting at a table, and 12 flies land in front
of me. I use a fly swatter and smash 4 flies. How
many remain on the table?
Answer: Well, if I smashed four flies, those four stay on the table and the
rest fly away.

Only the positive value makes sense — you can’t have a negative number of
people. If x = 6, then that’s the number of people now in the van. Dividing the
$12 by 6, each person is paying $2. There used to be only x – 2 or 4 people in
the van. Each paid $3 then, or $1 more than now.
Adding a step to get the answer
It’s not always convenient or easy to write your equation so that the variable
is equal to the answer. Sometimes you have to write an equation that makes
sense, and then figure out the answer to the question from the solution of the
equation that you construct and solve.
The Problem: A landlord wants to have a total of $42,000 income from the
monthly rents in his apartment complex. Right now, he gets $400 per month
for each of his 100 apartments, giving him a total of $40,000. For every $20 he
raises the rent, he loses three tenants who don’t want to pay the higher rent.
He will get more income, to offset the vacant apartments, but he can’t raise
the rent too high, or he’ll lose too much money. What should he charge per
unit to get to that goal of $42,000?
You compute the total amount of the money collected by multiplying the rent
charged per apartment times the number of apartments. The amount of rent
and the number of apartments keep changing, depending on how many times
he raises the rent by $20. So let x represent the number of $20 increases he
adds to the rent of $400. This way, the rent per unit is written as 400 + 20x.
For every $20 increase, the number of tenants is going to decrease by three.
Write the number of apartments that will be paying rent as 100 – 3x. You write
the income from rents as the money charged times the number of units, so
now you can write an equation setting the total rent money goal of $42,000
equal to the new rent amount, 400 + 20x, times the new number of apart-
ments being rented, 100 – 3x.
42,000 = (400 + 20x)(100 – 3x)
Multiplying the binomials on the right and combining terms, you get a qua-
dratic equation that is solved by setting everything equal to 0 and factoring.

, which is how much money 
the landlord wants. The main problem with this answer is that the amount
charged per apartment is a fraction that can’t be changed into an exact
number of cents. Rounding the rent amount to $467 or even $470 would
make sense, resulting in just a little more total income than the $42,000.
Trying the other solution of the quadratic equation, when x = 10, then the
rent charged is (400 + 20 × 10) = 400 + 200 = 600, and the number of apart-
ments that will be rented is (100 – 3 × 10) = 100 – 30 = 70 apartments.
Multiplying the rent of $600 times 70 you get exactly $42,000. The rent is
higher, but fewer apartments will be occupied. That would probably cut
down on the cost of maintenance and upkeep, but there are a lot of vacant
apartments. Now it’s up to the landlord (and his conscience).

subtraction problem when decrease or less or how many left are part of the
problem description. Multiplication is suggested with twice or times or the
obvious multiply. And the word half can create a division problem or a multi-
plication problem, depending on how you want to handle the computations.
In general, you try to replace the verbs is and are with an equal sign, and you
align the different expressions created for the equation on either side of the
equal sign, in the same positions as the words they came from on either side
of the verb.
Making the most of addition
Problems involving addition are nice in several respects:
 They’re fairly easy to spot, and the expressions to algebra translations
are usually straightforward.
 The terms in addition problems are reversible, because addition is 
commutative (you can add two terms in either order and get the same
answer).
 The equations that you create are relatively easy to solve.
The Problem: A service club is selling Super Bowl coffee mugs for a
fundraiser. The setup charge for creating the design that goes on the mugs is
a flat $75. The mugs will cost the club 90¢ each if they order no more than
200 mugs, 85¢ each if they order between 201 and 500 mugs, and 80¢ each if
they order more than 500 mugs. What is the total cost for 100 mugs, 300
mugs, and 1,000 mugs?
A cost function or equation consists of the fixed part and the variable part.
Each of the three cost schedules in this problem has a fixed cost of $75, but
the variable part changes, depending on the number of mugs ordered. An effi-
cient way of writing the equations in this problem is to use a piecewise func-
tion, which lists each rule and the input associated with each. The C in this
function represents the total cost, and the x represents the number of mugs.

Use the top rule to determine the total cost of 100 mugs. C(100) = 
75 + 0.90(100) = 75 + 90 = 165. Use the middle rule for 300 mugs. C(300) = 
75 + 0.85(300) = 75 + 255 = 330. And the bottom rule works for finding the
total cost of 1,000 mugs. C(1,000) = 75 + 0.80(1,000) = 75 + 800 = 875.

Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

Subtracting and multiplying solutions
The word less implies subtraction. You can even make a case for more indi-
cating subtraction, although addition is usually an easier way to go with
those problems. In any case, be careful when you write the algebra indicating
subtraction. The terms need to be in the correct order. Subtraction is not
commutative. The order that you subtract numbers makes a huge difference.
When multiplying shows up in a word problem, it’s often an outright instruc-
tion to multiply by two or three or one-half. Otherwise, it may be disguised as
twice or thrice. The next problem has a little of each of these operations.
The Problem: The number of boys in a high school senior class is ten less than
twice the number of girls. Also, six fewer than half the students in the class
have cars. If 202 students own cars, then how many boys are in the class?
Write an equation letting x represent the number of girls. You can solve for
the number of boys (to answer the question) after solving the equation for x.
The number of boys is represented by 2x – 10, which is ten less than twice
the number of girls. Note the order of the subtraction. Next, write the total
number of students as girls plus boys: x + 2x – 10. Multiply the total by 1⁄2 and
subtract 6. Set that expression equal to 202. Then simplify the equation and
solve for x.

Answer: You give one person the crate with an orange in it.

Dividing and conquering
You use division in problems when you want to break some total amount of
stuff into equal shares. After setting up the division problem, though, the best
course of action for solving the equation is usually to get rid of the division
operation. Do this by multiplying each term in the equation by some common
denominator; then solve the simpler equation that’s been created.
The Problem: A man bought two apartment buildings for $210,000 apiece. If
there are a total of ten apartments in the two buildings, and if the apartments
in one of the buildings cost $40,000 more than the apartments in the other
building, then what did he pay for the apartments in the two buildings?
Assume that each apartment in a building costs the same amount. You deter-
mine the cost of one apartment in the building by dividing $210,000 by the
number of apartments. Let x represent the number of apartments in one of
the buildings. Then, since the total number of apartments in the two build-
ings is 10, you write the number of apartments in that building as 10 – x.
Divide 210,000 by x on one side of the equation. On the other side of the
equation, divide 210,000 by 10 – x and add 40,000 to the result to show that
the first apartments are $40,000 more.

Tackling an earlier problem
In Chapter 10, I suggest that you can solve for the base and height of a triangle
if you’re given enough information. Just having the area of a triangle doesn’t
tell you the length of the base or the height, you need to know one or the
other measure, or you need to know something about how the measures
relate to one another.
The Problem: The area of a triangle is 20 square inches, and the base is 6 inches
longer than the height. What are the measures of the base and height?
Use the formula for the area of a triangle, and write the base and height,
b and h, in terms of one or the other of the variables. If you let h represent
the height, then the base is written as 6+h. (If you had chosen to use b
instead of h, you’d represent the height with b – 6.) Now let the area, A,
be equal to 20 and solve for h.

The solutions of the quadratic equation are h = –10 and h = 4. The negative

the height being 4 inches. The base is 6 inches longer than the height, so it
measures 4 + 6 = 10 inches.
Solving for Answers from
Algebraic Solutions
When algebraic equations or inequalities are used to find the answer to a
question or problem, you write the equation or inequality carefully, you solve
the algebraic equation or inequality using all the correct rules, and then you
check to be sure that the solution from the algebra really answers the ques-
tion that’s been posed.
181
Chapter 13: Writing Equations Using Algebraic Language

Comparing the types of 
algebraic expressions
Many different types of equations and inequalities are used to solve math
word problems. Each type has its own methods for solution, and many have
some quirks to watch out for when solving. Here are some more frequently
used equations and inequalities:
 Linear equations: ax + b = c, with one possible solution
 Quadratic equations: ax2 + bx + c = 0, with two solutions
 Rational (proportions) equations: ax
cb
=
, with one solution
 Absolute value linear equations: |ax + b| = c, with two solutions
 Linear inequalities: ax + b > c or ax + b < c, with infinite solutions
 Systems of linear equations: ax + by = c and dx + ey = f, with one possible
solution (see Chapter 17)
Using linear equations ax + b = c to find answers
The variable, x, in a linear equation has an exponent of 1. That’s why you’ll
only get one solution from these equations. You solve the equation by isolat-
ing the variable on one side of the equation.
The Problem: A realty manager gets a base salary of $4,000 per month plus
3 percent of whatever his agents earn in commissions. In February, the man-
ager had total earnings of $11,050. What did his agents earn in commissions?
The equation used to determine the manager’s salary any month is T(x) =
4,000 + 0.03x, where T is the total earnings by the manager, and x is the
amount of commissions earned by his agents. Substituting in the values you
know, the equation becomes 11,050 = 4000 + 0.03x. Subtract 4,000 from each
side to get 7,050 = 0.03x. Now divide each side by 0.03, and x = $235,000.
Quibbling over quadratic solutions to answer questions
Quadratic equations can, and often do, provide two completely different solu-
tions. Sometimes both solutions work in the problem. Other times only one
or even neither works. You need to check to determine which situation
applies in each case. (Refer to “Checking to see if a solution is an answer”
later in this section for more on the checking.)
The Problem: If you add 5 to a number and multiply that by what you get if
you subtract 4 from the same number, then the answer is 36. What is the
number?
182
Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

Let the number be represented by x. Adding 5 gives you x + 5, and subtract-
ing 4 is written x – 4. Multiplying (x + 5)(x – 4) and setting the product equal
to 36, you get a quadratic equation that’s solved by setting everything equal
to 0 and solved by factoring.

The two solutions you get are x = –8 and x = 7. Letting x = –8, the number you
get when you add 5 is –3. Subtracting 4 from –8, you get –12. The product
(–3)(–12) = 36. So –8 is an answer. Checking on x = 7, (7 + 5)(7 – 4) = (12)(3) =
36. Both answers work.
Rationalizing with rational equations
A rational equation has one or more fractions in it — usually with the vari-
able appearing in more than one numerator or denominator. In the “Dividing
and conquering” section, earlier in this chapter, you see how to clear the
equation of fractions by multiplying everything by the common denominator.
Another type of rational equation is one in which you have two fractions set
equal to one another. This is called a proportion. (Refer to Chapter 7 for a full
description of what you can do with proportions.) One of the nicest features
of proportions is that their cross products are always equal.
The Problem: In an orchard, it requires 3 workers for every 16 trees to keep
them pruned and cared for during the summer. How many trees could be
tended by 40 workers?
Write a proportion in which one fraction is 3 divided by 16 and the other frac-
tion is 40 divided by x. This keeps the number of workers across from a
number of workers, in the numerators, and trees across from trees, in the
denominators. Then cross-multiply and solve for x.

Chapter 13: Writing Equations Using Algebraic Language

Being absolutely sure with absolute value
The absolute value operation |a| takes the number a and measures its dis-
tance from 0. Another way of putting this is that the absolute value of any
number is positive. So |3| = +3 and |–3| = +3. When solving absolute-value
equations, you have to take into account the fact that what’s inside the oper-
ation could be either positive or negative, so there could be more than one
answer.
The Problem: Mike’s salary and Matt’s salary differ by $10,000. If Mike makes
$165,000, then what does Matt make?
You aren’t told if Matt makes more or less than Mike. Letting Matt’s salary be
represented by x, you write the absolute value equation |x – 165,000| =
10,000. Solve two different linear equations. One equation assumes that the
result in the absolute value operation is positive, and the other assumes that
it’s negative. The first equation is written x – 165,000 = 10,000. Solving for x,
you get x = 175,000. The other equation is formed by negating the expression
inside the absolute value. You get –(x – 165,000) = 10,000 which becomes 
–x + 165,000 = 10,000. Subtract 165,000 from each side and divide by –1,
and you get x = 155,000. So Matt makes either $175,000 or $155,000.
Lingering a while with linear inequalities
Linear inequalities are solved using almost all the same rules as those you
use with linear equations. The one big exception is that when you multiply or
divide each side of the inequality by a negative number, you have to switch
the sign around from > to < or vice versa.
The Problem: Jennifer has grades of 87, 95, 99, 83, and 100 on her first five
exams. What does she have to get on her next exam to end up with an aver-
age of at least 92 on all six exams?

Fickle friend
It’s found in Minnesota, but Wisconsin it will
avoid. It’s always in the timber, but not in woods,
so they’re annoyed. It’s never into you, but it’s
always into me. With anything so fickle, what,
oh what then can it be?
.Answer: Try the letter m.

An average of 92 on all six exams means that the total number of points has to
be at least 92 × 6 = 552 points. Let x represent the next test grade and solve the
inequality: 87 + 95 + 99 + 83 + 100 + x > 552. Simplify on the left by adding up
the tests to get 464 + x > 552. Subtract 464 from each side, and you get x > 88.
Jennifer has to get a score of 88 or better to have a minimum average of 92.
Checking to see if a solution is an answer
You get that feeling of satisfaction when an algebraic equation or inequality
works out and you get one or more solutions. The next step in word prob-
lems is then, of course, to see if the solution of the equation or inequality is
an answer to the problem. If the solution doesn’t work, then you go back to
see if you’ve done some miscomputation. But sometimes, no amount of good
mathematics is going to get you an answer. It could be that the question just
doesn’t have an answer.
Several problems in this chapter illustrate how there can be two answers that
work or just one of two solutions that works for an answer. How can it possi-
bly be that there is no answer?
The Problem: Ted and Jeff were comparing how many Christmas gifts they got.
If Ted got 10 less than 3 times as many as Jeff, and if the total number of gifts
they got is equal to the number of Jeff’s gifts minus 13, then how many gifts
did they each get?
Let the number of gifts that Jeff got be x. Then Ted got 3x – 10 gifts. Add the
two numbers of gifts together and set it equal to x – 13. So the equation to
solve is x + 3x – 10 = x – 13. Simplifying, you get 4x – 10 = x – 13. Subtract x
from each side and add 10 to each side, and the equation becomes 3x = –3.
Dividing each side by 3, you get x = –1. Oops! How can Jeff get a negative
number of gifts? The equation accurately represents the problem that’s pre-
sented. It’s just that the problem posed is impossible. There’s no answer to
the problem, even though the equation has a solution.

In this chapter, you find problems that multiply numbers of coins times their
monetary value, pints of coolant with their concentrations and cartons of
goodies with their product count. All these make for some interesting and,
yes, even useful problems. So you can put your spoon away and find out what
mixture problems are all about.
Standardizing Quality Times Quantity
The common theme in all mixture problems is that you take two or more dif-
ferent amounts (quantities) of two different concentrations (or qualities) and
mix them together to get an amount (quantity) that’s the sum of the two
ingredient quantities and a concentration (quality) that’s somewhere
between the concentration of the two ingredients that you started with.
Figure 14-1 illustrates this property or theme with containers.

The figure shows that when you add two quantities together, you get an
amount or new quantity that’s the sum of the two quantities that are put
together. The concentration or quality of the resulting mixture is a blend of
the two starting substances — its concentration is somewhere between the
two that are being combined.
Mixing It Up with Mixtures
Mixture problems involving actual substances occur when you take two or
more different solutions or granular compounds or anything that will com-
bine or mix and create a new combination that’s no longer purely one or
the other. When you pour chocolate syrup into milk, you add volume to the
liquid in the glass, and the color of the milk mixture isn’t as dark as the
chocolate or as white as the milk. The more chocolate, the darker the mix-
ture. Yum!
Improving the concentration of antifreeze
The radiators of cars serve to cool down the engine with liquid that circu-
lates around and pulls the heat away. The concentration of the fluid in the
radiator can be changed to reflect the temperatures of the particular season.
The concentration of antifreeze should be greater in the winter or cold
months and less in the warmer months.

The Problem: A service station owner wants to mix up some 35 percent
antifreeze. He wants to use up his current supply of 100 gallons of 20 percent
antifreeze and add enough 40 percent antifreeze to bring the mixture up to 35
percent. How many gallons of 40 percent antifreeze should he add?
Keep in mind quality × quantity for the two solutions being added together
and the quality and quantity of the resulting solution. Let x represent the
number of gallons of 40 percent antifreeze that needs to be added. The quali-
ties are the percentages of the solutions, and the quantities are the gallons of
the respective solutions.
Starting with [20 percent × 100 gallons] + [40 percent × x gallons] = [35 per-
cent × (100 + x) gallons], you see that the desired concentration, 35 percent,
is between 20 percent and 40 percent. Also, the resulting quantity is the sum
of the two quantities x and 100. Now rewrite the equation so it can be solved,
replacing percentages with the decimal equivalents. Solving for x,

It’ll take 300 gallons of the 40 percent antifreeze to bring the concentration up
to what he wants. Hope he has a large enough container!
The Problem: The same service station owner from the previous problem
still wants to make his 100 gallons of 20 percent antifreeze into 35 percent
antifreeze. How many gallons of pure antifreeze will it take to raise the 
concentration?
You can use the same basic equation of quality × quantity and multiply
the unknown amount, x, by 100 percent. The equation takes the form of 
[20 percent × 100 gallons] + [100 percent × x gallons] = [35 percent × (100 + x)
gallons]. Writing this in a form to be solved,

Chapter 14: Improving the Quality and Quantity of Mixture Problems

If you want to add pure antifreeze to what’s in your radiator right now, to
increase the concentration, you have to take some of the mixture out of the
radiator, first. The radiator holds only so much fluid. So, an even more inter-
esting problem involves removing a certain amount of what’s in the radiator
now and replacing it with pure antifreeze to achieve the level of concentra-
tion that you want.
The Problem: A man has a 16-quart radiator that now contains 16 quarts of
20 percent antifreeze. How much of the current mixture has to be removed
and replaced with pure antifreeze to raise the level of concentration to
35 percent?
The basic structure for the mixture problem will have one more term in it.
You’ll have a quality × quantity term that’s subtracted from the original
amount. Let x represent the number of quarts taken out and put back into
the radiator. The end quantity will have to be the original 16 quarts.
[20 percent × 16 quarts] – [20 percent × x quarts] + [100 percent × x quarts] =
[35 percent × 16 quarts]

Coffee, tea, or not
Two friends were at a restaurant and ordered
coffee to have with their dessert. One of the
friends found a fly in his coffee and called for the
waiter to take it away and bring a fresh cup of
coffee. The waiter came back with another cup.
But the friend became very upset and returned it
again, saying that the second cup was the same
as the first cup. How did he know?
Answer: The friend had put sugar in the first cup of coffee. When he tasted
the new cup, he could taste the sugar in it and knew it was the same cup
with the fly removed.

Watering down the wine
Just as concentrations of solutions are increased by adding a pure substance,
the concentrations can also be decreased by adding pure water. You perform
this type of operation all the time, such as when mixing up orange juice from
frozen concentrate or when fixing mixed drinks such as bourbon and water.
The Problem: How much water must be added to 8 ounces of 40 percent
alcohol to produce a mixture that’s 7 percent alcohol?
Water is 0 percent alcohol, so use the quality × quantity setup to solve for x,
the number of ounces of water needed.
[40 percent × 8 ounces] + [0 percent × x ounces] = [7 percent × (8 + x) ounces]

Mixing up insecticide
Farmers know how important it is to keep destructive insects out of their
crop-producing fields. They apply enough insecticide to keep the bugs away,
but they don’t want to overdo it and poison the field for the future. Mixing the
insecticides and applying them where necessary is a complicated problem.
The Problem: To get rid of a nasty strain of root worm, an insecticide mix-
ture should have a concentration that’s 9 percent insecticide. A farmer has
two mixtures on hand — one with 5 percent insecticide and the other with
15 percent insecticide. What is the ratio of the 5 percent to 15 percent mix-
tures that should be combined to get a 9 percent mixture? If the farmer needs
40 gallons of mixture, how many gallons of each should she use?
191
Chapter 14: Improving the Quality and Quantity of Mixture Problems

First solve for the ratio of the different mixtures and then apply it to the
quantity of 40 gallons. Use the quality × quantity setup. Let x represent the
fraction of 5 percent solution and 1 – x represent the fraction of 15 percent
solution. Adding x + 1 – x you get 1, which is all of the final mixture.
[5 percent × x ] + [15 percent × (1 – x)] = [9 percent × 1]
Solving for x in the related equation,

The farmer needs to let 5
3 , or 60 percent, of the insecticide be made up of 
the 5 percent solution and 5
2 , or 40 percent, of the mixture be 15 percent 
solution. In a 40-gallon situations, 60 percent is 0.60 × 40 = 24 gallons and the
other 40 percent is 0.40 × 40 = 16 gallons.
Counting on the Money
Problems concerning money — no, I’m talking about math problems, not just
any problem over money — involve the value of the currency or coin or
vending unit along with the number of each of these monetary values. The
theme of the quality × quantity applies very well here, where the quality is the
coin value, bill value, or commodity value in the problem.

Filling the pitcher
What can you fill a pitcher with so that it’s
lighter than if it’s full of air?
Answer: You can fill it with holes.

Determining how many of 
each denomination
Coins and paper money come in many different denominations, allowing people
to carry a lot of money with just a few bills or to make change for purchases
using smaller bills and coins. What’s consistent for all money in all countries is
that you determine the total amount that you have by multiplying the value
of the coin or bill times the number of them that you’re carrying.
The Problem: Cassie has a total of $4.10 in dimes and quarters. If she has
twenty coins in all, how many of them are quarters?
Multiply the value (quality) of a quarter, $0.25, times the number of quarters
and the value of a dime, $0.10, times the number of dimes. The sum of the
two results is set equal to $4.10. You know that the number of quarters and
dimes equals 20. Also, you want to solve for quarters. So let q represent the
number of quarters, leaving 20 – q to represent the number of dimes. Setting
up the equation and solving,

Cassie has 14 quarters. You check your answer by determining the number
of dimes, 20 – q = 20 – 14 = 6. Multiply 14 × 0.25 = 3.50 and 6 × 0.10 = 0.60. The
sum 3.50 + 0.60 = 4.10. So the solution checks.

Adding up the money
How can you make 30¢ with only two coins if
one of the coins is not a nickel?
Answer: You let the other coin be the nickel and use that nickel and a quarter.

The Problem: Grace has twice as many nickels as quarters and five less than
three times as many dimes as quarters. If she has a total of $6, then how
many of each coin does she have?
Because both the nickels and dimes are compared to quarters, let q represent
the number of quarters and write expressions for the number of nickels and
dimes using the relationships. The number of nickels is written as 2q, and the
number of dimes is 3q – 5. Multiply each quantity of coin by its quality and
add up the products, setting the sum equal to 6.

Grace has 10 quarters. If she has twice as many nickels as quarters, that
makes it 20 nickels. And 5 less than 3 times 10 is 30 minus 5 or 25 dimes.
Checking on the total, 0.25(10) + 0.05(20) + 0.10(25) = 2.50 + 1 + 2.50 = 6.
It isn’t always clear-cut which coin or piece of currency you want to use to
have their amount represent the variable. You almost always have more than
one choice for x. Your goal is to pick the money amount that makes writing
the problem as easy as possible.
The Problem: A cash drawer contains singles, fives, tens, and twenties.
There are two more tens than fives, eight less than twice as many twenties
as tens, and ten more than twice as many singles than twenties. If the total
amount of money in the cash drawer is $650, then how many of each bill
is there?
Several different comparisons are going on here, each with the number of
bills of a particular denomination being compared to the number of bills of
another denomination. You need to pick a variable to represent how many
you have of one type of bill and work from that amount.
One suggestion is to start by letting the number of fives be represented by f.
Then the number of tens is represented by f + 2. Comparing twenties to tens,
you write eight less than twice as many twenties as tens by subtracting 8 from
2 times the number of tens, or 2(f + 2) – 8. Now take that number of twenties
and write the number of singles (ten more than twice as many singles as 
twenties) as 2[2(f + 2) – 8]+10.
You then write an equation taking the number of each type of bill times its
monetary value, adding up all these products, and setting the sum equal to
$650. But first, it’s a good idea to simplify the expressions for the numbers of
194
Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

each bill. The number of fives is f, which is fine. The number of tens, f + 2, is
also as simple as it can get. But the number of twenties can be simplified. 
2(f + 2) – 8 = 2f + 4 – 8 = 2f – 4. And the number of singles has a long way to go,
because 2[2(f + 2) – 8]+10 = 2[2f + 4 – 8] + 10 = 2[2f – 4] + 10 = 4f – 8 + 10 = 4f + 2.
Now you’re set to go. Write the equation.

There are 12 five-dollar bills, two more tens than fives (or 14 ten-dollar bills),
eight less than twice as many twenties as tens (or 20 twenties), and ten more
than twice as many singles as twenties (or 50 singles). Checking this out for
the total: 5(12) + 10(14) + 20(20) + 1(50) = 60 + 140 + 400 + 50 = 650.
Making a marketable mixture of candy
Some people prefer dark chocolate. Others go for the gooey chocolate-
covered cherries. Many don’t care for coconut in their sweets. And most
people are happy with any mixture of any kind. Different kinds of candies
have different prices, depending on the ingredients. When you combine dif-
ferent candies in packages, the quality or price of each type is multiplied by
the quantity or weight to determine the price of the mixture.
The Problem: Malted milk balls sell for $3 per pound, and chocolate-covered
peanuts cost $4 per pound. How many pounds of each type of candy should
be used to create a 5-pound box of candy that costs $3.60 per pound?
Let m represent the number of pounds of malted milk balls. Because the total
amount of candy is to be 5 pounds, then 5 – m can represent the number of
pounds of chocolate-covered peanuts. Multiply $3 times m and add it to the
product of $4 and 5 – m. Set that sum equal to $3.60 times 5. Each term has
the price times the weight. Solve for m.

If you use 2 pounds of malted milk balls, you’ll need 3 pounds of the peanuts
to make 5 pounds. Checking, 3(2) + 4(3) = 6 + 12 = 18. If you divide the total
price of $18 by 5 pounds, you get $3.60, the cost per pound.

Chapter 14: Improving the Quality and Quantity of Mixture Problems

The Problem: A box of candy is to contain chocolate covered cherries that
cost $5 per pound, nougats that cost $3 per pound, assorted crèmes that cost
$2 per pound, and caramels that cost $6 per pound. There should be an equal
amount (by weight) of the caramels and cherries. You want twice as many
nougats as caramels and twice as many crèmes as nougats. How much of
each type of candy should be used if the box is to cost $4.25?
First, you have to stop drooling and think about the mathematics, not the
candy. Because the caramels and cherries will have equal weight, it makes
sense to assign a variable to represent the weights of those two candies. Let
c be the number of pounds of caramels and c be the number of pounds of
chocolate-covered cherries. For the nougat, you want twice as much as there
are caramels, so that’s represented by 2c. And twice as much of the nougat is
2(2c) = 4c, for the weight of the crèmes. Now multiply each weight of candy
by the respective cost, add them together, and set the sum equal to 4.25.

Running a concession stand
Picture this: It’s game night, and you’ve made a dash to the food vendor to
get a quick snack. So did half the people in the stadium. Now you have time
to stand in line and wait and ponder the problem of combining different
foods and drinks available in the concession stand so that you can spend
every penny of the money in your pocket — no more, no less.
The Problem: Stan had exactly $20.40 in his pocket and managed to spend it
all at the concession stand. He bought three hot dogs, two servings of cheese
fries, and one large drink for that amount of money. One hot dog costs $1.80
more than one serving of cheese fries. And a drink costs $1.20 less than a hot
dog. How much did each item cost?
The number of items have to be multiplied by their respective prices, and the
costs totaled. Set that total equal to $20.40 to solve for the individual prices.
Let the cost of cheese fries be represented by c. Then a hot dog costs c + 1.80.
A drink is $1.20 less than a hot dog, so it costs c + 1.80 – 1.20 = c + 0.60.

So cheese fries cost $2.40, the hot dogs are $1.80 more than that (or $4.20),
and the drink is $0.60 more than the fries (or $3).
The Problem: You’re buying supplies for the concession stand Friday night
and need to purchase candy and pretzels and gum in bulk. Twix candy bars
are 35¢ each if you buy a case of 36. M&M’s bags are 36¢ each if you buy a
case of 48. Pretzels are 19¢ a bag if you buy a case of 30. Cookies are 24¢ a
package if you buy a case of 33. And gum costs 18¢ a pack if you buy a case of
40. You buy the same number of cases of cookies and gum. You buy twice as
many cases of M&M’s as cookies. You buy two less than twice as many cases
of pretzels as cookies. And you buy five fewer cases of Twix than M&M’s. If
you spend $270.72 on all these supplies, then how many individual items do
you have on hand to sell Friday night?
This problem just begs to be organized. A spreadsheet would be a big help
here. But the next best thing is a table showing the item name, the number
of items in a case, the cost per case, and a representation of the number of
cases ordered. Because the number of cases of cookies and gum is the same,
let the number of cases of these items be represented by g. The number of
cases of M&M’s is 2g. The number of cases of pretzels is 2g – 2; and the
number of cases of Twix is 2g – 5. Table 14-1 shows all the entries.

Being Interested in Earning Interest
Earning interest on money invested is of utmost importance to the wise
investor. Some funds pay a higher rate of interest but may be a bit risky. To
offset the risk, the shrewd investor puts some money in a high-risk fund and
the rest in a fund that doesn’t pay as well but one that can be trusted to give
a return and not lose any of the investment.
Making your investment work for you
The problems in this section assume the use of the simple-interest formula,
compounded annually. In actuality, financial institutions use compound inter-
est and computer programs to figure out these problems. But you get a good
idea of how it works — and a pretty good estimate of the actual answer using
the less complex simple-interest formula.
The simple-interest formula says that the interest earned, I, is equal to the
amount invested (principal), p, times the percentage rate, r, written as a deci-
mal, times the number of years (time), t. The formula is: I = prt.
The Problem: Robert has $50,000 to invest. He wants to put some of this
money in an account that earns 8 percent interest and the rest in a riskier
account that promises to earn at the rate of 12 percent. He needs yearly earn-
ings of a total of $4,500. How much of his $50,000 should he invest in each
account?

Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

Write an equation in which the first interest plus the second interest is equal to
$4,500. The first interest and second interest are expressions that you write
using the interest formula. This is another quality times quantity situation. Let
x represent the amount of money invested in the first account and 50,000 – x
be the amount of money in the second account. Assume that the time is one
year. Then solve for x.

Robert needs to invest $37,500 at 8 percent and the rest, $50,000 – $37,500 =
$12,500, at 12 percent.
The Problem: Stella has been watching several investment funds and has
decided that she’ll deposit some of her $100,000 in each. She will put twice as
much in the fund earning 5 percent as that earning 4 percent, $5,000 more in
the fund earning 10 percent than in the fund earning 4 percent, and $5,000
less in the fund earning 6 percent as in the fund earning 4 percent. How much
will she get in total interest earnings at the end of the year? How much did
she invest in each fund?
First, determine how much she’s investing in each fund by letting x represent
the amount in the 4 percent fund, let 2x represent the amount in the 5 per-
cent fund, let x + 5,000 represent the amount in the 10 percent fund, and let
x – 5,000 represent the amount in the 6 percent fund. Add up all the fund
amounts and set them equal to 100,000 to solve for x.

If x = 20,000, then the amounts in the 4 percent, 5 percent, 10 percent, and 6

each fund amount and percentage together to get the total interest.
$20,000(0.04) + $40,000(0.05) + $25,000(0.10) + $15,000(0.06) = $800 + $2,000 +
$2,500 + $900 = $6,200. Stella should earn $6,200 in interest.

Chapter 14: Improving the Quality and Quantity of Mixture Problems

Determining how much is 
needed for the future
It’s all well and good if you have $100,000 or some such amount of money to
invest. Wouldn’t we all just love that? Frequently, though, the question is more
like, “How much do I need to invest in order to get that kind of interest?”
Nonprofit organizations like to have endowment funds (money put aside that’s
never touched, with only the interest used to pay expenses). They want to
know how much is needed in the endowment fund in order to have a particu-
lar income every year from the interest.
The Problem: The local Kiwanis Club needs $20,000 in interest annually in
order to adequately fund its benevolence programs. It currently has $120,000
invested — one-third of it in a mutual fund earning 5 percent interest and the
rest in a money-market fund earning 10 percent interest. This division of the
funds is mandated by its endowment agreement. How much more money
does the Kiwanis Club need, and how much does it have to have in each fund
in order to earn that $20,000 annual interest?
First determine the total amount of money needed to generate the $20,000
interest each year when one-third goes into the 5 percent fund and two-thirds
into the 10 percent fund. Then, after you find out how much is needed, you can
see what the difference is between that and what the Kiwanis Club already has.
Think of the division of money as being divided into three parts — one part
in the 5 percent fund and two-thirds in the 10 percent fund. Rather than use
fractions, let the whole three-thirds be represented by 3x. Then let x repre-
sent the amount of money invested at 5 percent and 2x represent the amount
invested at 10 percent. Write the two interest terms, add them up, and set
them equal to 20,000.

It needs to have $80,000 invested at 5 percent and twice that, $160,000
invested at 10 percent. So a total of $240,000 is needed in the two funds.
Subtracting what it already has, $240,000 – $120,000 = $120,000. The Kiwanis
Club is halfway to its goal. Looks like it’ll have to host a few more pancake
breakfasts to get there!

Feeling Your Age with
Age Problems
In This Chapter
 Making sense of problems involving comparisons of ages
 Adding and subtracting the years to solve problems
 Dealing with complications of real puzzlers in age problems
O
ne of my favorite Funky Winkerbean cartoons starts out with something
like, “When Henry was twice as old as Hank was two years after half of
Hank’s age. . . .” And the punch line: “How many apples is an orange worth?”
Some people think this is hilarious. Others don’t find a bit of humor in these
very involved, contrived, convoluted problems.
In this chapter, I acquaint you with techniques and procedures to use when
tackling word problems involving the ages of one, two, or more people. When
broken down into their component parts, age problems seem much less
intimidating. Here you see how to deal with aging — well, ages of people after
a certain amount of time. I hope you’ll see the humor in the cartoon, too.
Doing Age Comparisons
Age comparisons are done almost as soon as a person can talk. Children take
advantage of being older than one another to get first in line or get to stay up
later or get whatever the prize. Doing age comparisons makes for interesting
math problems, too. The usual rules apply: Always let the variable represent
a number, and use the math words for clues about adding, subtracting, and
so on.

Warming up to age
Before getting into some serious algebra word problems, here are a few
warm-ups to get you in the mood.
The Problem: A 40-year-old man married a 25-year-old woman. The woman
died at the age of 40, and her husband was so saddened that he wept for years
after that. He died 5 years after he stopped weeping, on his 80th birthday. How
many years was he a widower?
First, just do some mental calculations. The couple was married when he was
40 and she was 25; he was 15 years older than she was. If she died when she
was 40, then he was still 15 years older than she was, so he was 55. It doesn’t
matter how many years he wept and that for 5 years he had stopped weep-
ing. The only figuring you need to do is to take the age when he died, 80, and
subtract the age he was when his wife died, 55. Subtracting 80 – 55 = 25, so he
was a widower for 25 years.
The next problem involves more counting and logic than algebra to figure out
the ages.
The Problem: A man has three children. The oldest child is three times as
old as the youngest. The second child is six years older than the youngest
and six years younger than the oldest. How old are the children?
The second or middle child’s age is halfway between two numbers that are
six years away in either direction. So the ages could be 1, 7, and 13; 2, 8, and
14; 3, 9, and 15; and so on. Go back to the beginning of the problem. The
oldest child is three times as old as the youngest, so the age of the oldest has
to be a multiple of 3. The multiple has to be larger than 13, so the oldest is 15,
18, 21, or some other multiple of three. Also, the oldest is 12 years older than
the youngest. So what number can you multiply by 3 and have it turn out to
be 12 larger than the original number? It’s the number 18, that you want. If
the children are 6, 12, and 18, then the oldest is three times as old as the
youngest.
Okay, so you can’t stand not using algebra and an equation to do this prob-
lem. I give. Here goes: Let the middle child’s age be x. Then the oldest
child’s age is x + 6 and the youngest child’s age is x – 6. If the oldest child’s
age is equal to three times the youngest child’s age, you write that as x + 6 =
3(x – 6). Distributing the 3 on the right, the equation becomes x + 6 = 3x – 18.
Subtract x from each side and add 18 to each side, and you get 24 = 2x. Dividing
by 2, 12 = x. The middle child is x years old, or 12, the oldest is x + 6 years
older, or 18, and the youngest is x – 6 years old, or 6.
202
Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

Making age an issue
Traditional age word problems use algebraic expressions to write compar-
isons such as twice the age of or four years older than and then solve for one or
more person’s age. You’ll see lots of parentheses in the equations that are first
written so that the meaning is clearly defined and the people’s ages are clearly
identified. Age problems can get pretty wordy and confusing, so you want to
be sure that you’ve written something to parallel the wording.
The Problem: To be a member of a certain club, you have to meet its strin-
gent age requirement. Three more than twice your age must be equal to 21
more than your age. What is the age requirement (in simpler terms)?
First, decide if the club is worth it. That decided, now tackle the problem. Let
x represent your age. Write three more than twice your age as 3 + 2x. Then 21
more than your age becomes 21 + x. Set the two expressions equal to one
another, and the equation to solve is 3 + 2x = 21 + x. Subtracting x and 3 from
each side, you get x = 18.
You double your pleasure and double your fun when you introduce twins into
the mix. The ages of twins is the same (I won’t get into the special case of
twins born on two different days even though minutes apart), so you have to
be sure to include the age of the twins twice into the problem.
The Problem: The mother of a pair of twins is 30 years older than they are.
If the sum of the ages of all three of them (the mother and the twins) is 12
greater than the mother’s age, then how old is the mother?
Let the age of the twins be represented with x. Then their mother’s age is rep-
resented with x + 30. Adding the ages of the three people together, you get
the expression x + x + (x + 30). Because this sum is 12 greater than the age of
the mother, you set this sum equal to (x + 30) + 12. The final equation and its
solution is as follows.
203

The age of the twins is 6, so their mother is 6 + 30 = 36 years. The sum of all
three people is 6 + 6 + 36 = 48, and 48 is 12 greater than the mother’s age of 36.
The Problem: Libin is three times as old as Larry. If the sum of their ages is
16 more than twice Larry’s age plus 4, then how old is Libin?
Even though the problem asks for Libin’s age, it’ll be easier to let the variable,
x, represent Larry’s age and then answer the question after solving the equa-
tion. Letting x represent Larry’s age, then 3x represents Libin’s age. The sum
of their ages is x + 3x. You write 16 more than twice Larry’s age plus 4 with
numbers and a variable in exactly that same order: 16 + 2x + 4. Now write the
entire equation with the two expressions separated by an equal sign and
solve.

Going Back and Forth into 
the Future and the Past
Age problems get even more exciting when you get out your crystal ball and
make predictions about the future or look back in a photo album to reminisce
about the past. The equations used to solve age problems about the future
and past get more complicated because the same amount of time has to be
added to or subtracted from each variable expression.
Looking to the future
How old will you be in seven years? Some of us grimace at the thought of
another significant birthday, but it’s better than the alternative. Add seven to
your age, and you know how many candles go on your birthday cake.

Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

The Problem: Jake is six years older than Jack. In 7 years, the sum of their
ages will be 52. How old are Jake and Jack now?
Let Jack’s age be represented with x and Jake’s age represented with x + 6.
(An alternative would be to let Jake’s age be x and Jack’s be x – 6; most
people prefer to work with addition instead of subtraction.) Now deal with in
7 years. Add 7 to both ages, so Jack’s age will be x + 7 and Jake’s age will be
x + 6 + 7 or x + 13 in seven years. The sum of their ages in seven years will be
52, so the equation and its solution are as follows:

So Jack is 16, and Jake, who is 6 years older, is 22. In seven years, Jack will be
16 + 7 = 23 and Jake will be 22 + 7 = 29. The sum 23 + 29 = 52.
Some age problems also use comparisons where one person is twice as old
or four times as old in a number of years.
The Problem: Molly is 30 years older than Margaret. In 18 years, Molly will
be twice as old as Margaret. How old will Molly be when she’s twice
Margaret’s age?
Let Margaret’s age be represented by x and Molly’s age be represented by 
x + 30. In 18 years, Margaret will be x + 18 and Molly will be (x + 30) + 18 = 
x + 48. At that time, 18 years from now, Molly will be twice as old as Margaret,
so you write that Molly’s age, x + 48 = 2(x + 18), twice Margaret’s age. Solving
the equation, you multiply through by 2 on the right to get x + 48 = 2x + 36.
Subtract x from each side and subtract 36 from each side to get 12 = x. So
Margaret is 12 years old now, and Molly, who is 30 years older than Margaret
is 12 + 30 = 42 years old. In 18 years, when Molly is twice Margaret’s age,
Molly will be 42 + 18 = 60 and Margaret will be 12 + 18 = 30.
205
Chapter 15: Feeling Your Age with Age Problems
Catching up in age
In an old Abbott and Costello movie, there’s a dis-
cussion about the ages of a husband and wife.
When they marry, the husband is four times as
old as his bride. Eight years later he’s three times
as old as she is. And 24 years after that he’s only
twice her age. Abbott asks Costello how long
it’ll take for her to catch up with him in age. Of
course, that’s impossible, but what were the ages
of the couple when they married? (Try to keep it
legal in most states.)
Answer: If he was 64 and she was 16 when they were married, then he was
4 times her age. Eight years later, he was 72 and she was 24 — his age was
three times hers. Twenty-four years after that, he was 96 and she was 48;
he was twice her age.

The Problem: Stan is four times as old as Steve. In ten years, Stan will be
twice as old as Steve. How old are Stan and Steve?
Let Steve’s age be represented by x and Stan’s age by 4x. In ten years, Steve
will be x + 10 and Stan will be 4x + 10. Because Stan’s age in ten years will be
twice Steve’s, you write that 4x + 10 = 2(x + 10). Multiplying through by 2 on
the right, 4x + 10 = 2x + 20. Subtract 2x from each side and 10 from each side
to get 2x = 10, or x = 5. So Steve is 5 and Stan is four times that, or 20. In ten
years, Steve will be 15 and Stan will be 30.
Going back in time
Looking back on things, you recall those good times with close friends and
what you did when you were all younger — by two years or ten years or
more. Just as with adding years in word problems, when you have so many
years ago in a problem, you subtract the same number of years from each
age involved in the situation.
The Problem: Today, Ernest’s age is four years more than twice Christine’s age.
Three years ago, the sum of their ages was 31. How old is Christine right now?
Let x represent Christine’s age right now. That means that Ernest’s age is rep-
resented by 4 + 2x. To adjust for three years ago, you subtract 3 from each age,
so Christine was x – 3 and Ernest was 4 + 2x – 3 = 2x + 1 years old. The sum of
those two ages, three years ago, was 31. The equation and solution are:

Christine is 11 years old right now, so Ernest is 4 + 2(11) = 26 years old. Three
years ago, Christine was 8 and Ernest was 23. The sum 8 + 23 = 31.
With multiple births comes multiples of the same age. Each person involved
has his age adjusted in the same way.
The Problem: Three years ago, the sum of the ages of the quintuplets and
their older sister was 155. If Sis is five years older than her siblings, then how
old are the quints today?
206
Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

First, quintuplets refers to five siblings born at the same time. Designate the
variable x as the age of the quints today. Their sister’s age is then x + 5 years.
Three years ago, the quints were x – 3 years old, and their sister was x + 5 – 3
or x + 2 years old. The sum of the ages of these six children is written by 
multiplying the quints’ age by five and adding the sister’s age: 5(x – 3) + (x + 2),
and that sum is set equal to 155 for the equation.

The quints are each 28 today. Their sister is five years older, so she’s 33 years
old. Three years ago, the quints were 25 and Sis was 30. Multiplying 25 × five
you get 125. Add 30, and the sum of the six ages is 155.
The Problem: Amanda’s age is two years more than twice Bill’s age. Nine
years ago, her age was three years more than three times Bill’s age. How old
will they be in five years?
Let Bill’s age be represented with x so that Amanda’s age can be represented
with 2 + 2x. Nine years ago, Bill was x – 9 years old and Amanda was 2 + 2x – 9
or 2x – 7 years old. Amanda’s age nine years ago was equal to three years
more than Bill’s age at that time. The equation to use is 2x – 7 = 3 + 3(x – 9).
Notice that both ages in the equation are those representing nine years ago.

Facing Some Challenges of Age
My Funky Winkerbean story, at the beginning of this chapter, is an example
of how some age problems can seem awfully complicated and difficult. The
problems in this section may seem impossible at first, but, by taking them
apart and putting them back together again as logical equations, you see how
those challenges of age aren’t all that bad after all.
The Problem: Mike and Ike are good friends and like to challenge new
acquaintances with the following riddle, saying that they’ll pick up the tab
at the restaurant if the riddle can be solved. Here’s what they pose to the
unsuspecting: Mike is twice as old as Ike was when Mike was as old as Ike is
now. Right now, Mike is 36 years old. How old is Ike right now?
The most common plan of action is to let Ike’s age be represented with x and
then write some expressions and equations involving that variable. In this case,
because you know Mike’s age already, it makes more sense to figure out how
many years ago the riddle is referring to — solve for x. Here’s what you know:
Mike is twice as old as Ike was . . . so, since Mike is 36, Ike was 18.
Mike was as old . . . letting x be the number of years ago, Mike was 36 – x.
Ike is now . . . the number of years since Ike was 18 is 18 + x.
Does that look like sleight-of-hand? Look at Table 15-1, showing possible ages
of Mike and Ike if x is the number of years since Ike was 18.
Table 15-1

36 – 9 = 27
18 + 9 = 27
208
Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

Nine years ago, Mike was 27, which is the same age that Ike is now. When
Mike was 27, Ike was 18 (or half Mike’s age now). If I had just written the
equation 36 – x = 18 + x and solved it to get 18 = 2x or x = 9, you might not
have believed me. For the naturally skeptical, Table 15-1 helps.
The next problem uses more number theory than algebra. Haul out your
prime factorizations to do this problem.
The prime factorization of a number is the unique set of all the prime num-
bers whose product is that number. For example, the prime factorization of
the number 105 = 3 × 5 × 7. The prime factorization of 100 = 22 × 52.
The Problem: Mike and Ike are back at it again. They point to a family with
three children enjoying their dinner at a nearby table. They offer to buy
dinner for that entire family and the person they’re making the bet with if this
poor, unsuspecting person can figure out the riddle (otherwise, this person
pays). The riddle: At the nearby table, the product of the ages of the three chil-
dren is 72, and the sum of their ages is today’s date. How old are the children?
The bet-taker thinks for a while and then says, “But that isn’t enough informa-
tion!” Mike takes pity and offers him a clue, “Okay, I’ll tell you that the oldest
child doesn’t like pizza.” Can you determine the ages of the children?
Haul out another list or chart. The prime factorization of the number 72 is 
23 × 32. Use the factors to figure out all the different numbers that divide 72
evenly — and include the number 1 (which isn’t a prime number, but is a
factor of 72). All the possible ages — numbers that divide 72 evenly are: 1, 2,
3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72. Using these numbers, you create a list of the
possible ages of the three children from combinations that multiply to give
you 72. For example, 72 and 1 and 1 multiply to give you 72. The numbers
aren’t very probable for the ages of three children, but I’m sure it’s happened.
Another combination is 36 and 2 and 1. Making this list is fine, but a table is
more helpful, because you want the sum of the ages, too. Table 15-2 lists all of
the possible ages and their sums. Notice that the ages multiplied together are
always 72.

You see all the possibilities for the ages. So, if the bet-taker had worked out
all the possible ages and sums and compared the sum with today’s date, he
could have answered the question — unless today is the 14th. That’s why he
needed more information. By giving the hint that the oldest child doesn’t like
pizza, the answer to the riddle is clear. The children must be 8, 3, and 3 years
old, because the other combination with a sum of 14 is 6, 6, and 2 where
there are two older children.
One more age problem to consider mixes in a little number sense with ages
now and in the past.
The Problem: Ben is a teenager. Bob is one-third as old as Ben was when Bob
was half as old as Ben is now. How old are Ben and Bob?

Identical applications
Two men apply for the same job. They are iden-
tical in appearance. They have the same mother
and father and birth date. The person doing the
hiring asks, “Are you two twins?” They respond,
quite honestly, “No, we aren’t.” How is this 
possible.
Answer: The men are two children from a set of triplets (or quadruplets or
quintuplets, and so on).

First, you can narrow down Ben’s age to being either 14, 16, or 18. This con-
clusion comes from the fact that he’s a teenager and Bob is half his age; Ben’s
age has to be evenly divisible by two. Of course, this assumes that the prob-
lem only deals with whole numbers, and that’s a good assumption. You can
just play around with the three guesses to see whatever numbers work, or
you can be a bit more systematic. Let x represent the number of years ago in
the problem:

his chapter deals with a lot of moving around. People and cars and trains
are moving around all the time. Liquids in containers are moving from
one place to another. The first problems involve moving around and the 
distance traveled. The typical distance problems use the relationship that
distance is equal to rate times time, d = rt. By using this equation, you deal
with trains meeting somewhere in the middle of nowhere and wives catching
up to forgetful husbands.
Another type of moving around occurs with the classic work problems —
how many hands it takes for a lighter workload — and how long it takes when
everyone works together.
And, lastly, you’ll find a lot of moving around when fluids move from one con-
tainer to an other. If you’re trying to fill a tub while the tub is leaking, you
have to work quickly to find out how long it takes to actually make the tub
overflow.
Summing Up the Distances
These first distance problems have a common theme: that the sum of the dis-
tances that two people travel, along the same straight line, equals the total
distance. Sometimes, people are traveling toward one another, and the sum

of the distances is how far each has traveled until they meet. Other times,
people are traveling in opposite directions, and you sum up the distances
traveled to compute how far apart they are.
Meeting somewhere in the middle
Two lovers spy each other on opposite sides of the room and run toward one
another. They meet somewhere between where they started running — and
where they meet depends on how fast each can run. You can assume that
there are no chairs to dodge in their mad dashes. The setup used to solve
this problem is pretty much the same as a problem involving two bulls rush-
ing at one another from either side of the arena or two trains approaching
one another from opposite directions along the same track.
Keep in mind the formula d = rt or distance = rate × time. When two different
distances are added together to equal a total distance, the individual rates
and times are multiplied together first and then the products are added
together:

Making good time
With distance problems, you can solve for the distance traveled or the speed
at which objects are traveling or the amount of time spent. The two problems
in this section involve solving for how much time it takes to reach a goal.
The Problem: Betsy and Bart see each other from opposite sides of a gymna-
sium that measures 440 feet across. They both start running toward one
another at the same time. If Betsy can run at the rate of 4 feet per second and
Bart runs at 7 feet per second, then how long does it take for them to meet?
The total distance to be covered is 440 feet. Set that amount equal to the sum
of the distances that each runner covers. Betsy can run at the rate of 4 feet
per second, and she runs for t seconds. Bart can run at 7 feet per second and
also runs for t seconds. So your equation is 440 = 4t + 7t. Simplify on the right
to get 440 = 11t. Divide each side of the equation by 11, and you get that t = 40
seconds. It’ll take less than a minute for the two to reach one another, with
Betsy running 4(40) = 160 feet and Bart running 7(40) = 280 feet.
In the preceding problem, the two people see each other and start running at
the same time. What if one starts before the other, and they run for different
amounts of time?

Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

The Problem: Jon leaves Chicago at noon and heads south toward
Bloomington traveling at 45 mph. Jane leaves Bloomington heading north
for Chicago at 1 p.m., traveling at 55 mph. If Chicago and Bloomington are
145 miles apart, then what time will they meet?
The total distance to be traveled is 145 miles. If Jon drives for t hours, then
Jane, who left an hour later, will drive for t – 1 hours. Take each rate in terms
of miles per hour and multiply it by the respective amount of time traveled.
Jon will drive for 45t miles and Jane will travel for 55(t – 1) miles. Add the two
distances together and set the sum equal to 145. Solve the equation for t.

Because t is the number of hours that Jon drives, he drives for two hours and

Speeding things up
Distance is equal to rate times time. Participants in these distance problems
may travel for the same amount of time or different amounts of time. They
can travel at the same speed or different speeds. The next two problems let
you determine how fast things are moving.
The Problem: Two trains leave the same station traveling in opposite direc-
tions. The first train leaves at 2 p.m. The second train leaves a half-hour later
and travels at a speed averaging 15 miles per hour faster than the first train.
By 8 o’clock that evening, they’re 600 miles apart. How fast are the two trains
traveling?
Use the same d = rt format, setting the sum of the distances traveled equal to
600. The first train travels for 6 hours at rate r, and the second train, leaving
a half-hour later, only travels for 5.5 hours but at a greater speed, r + 15. The

The Problem: Alberto can bicycle 2 miles per hour less than twice as fast as
Ollie, so Alberto didn’t leave for the rally until two hours after Ollie left. If the
total distance they traveled was 504 miles and if Ollie traveled for 10 hours,
then how fast can Alberto bicycle?
Let the rate at which Ollie can bicycle be r. Then Alberto’s rate is 2r – 2. If Ollie
traveled for 10 hours, then Alberto traveled for 8 hours. The total distance is
equal to the sum of the distances the two traveled. Ollie traveled 10r miles,
and Alberto traveled 8(2r – 2) miles.

Making a beeline
You can solve for the time it takes to travel, and you can solve for how fast
cars or trains travel. Determining the total distance that someone or some-
thing travels can also be very interesting. Consider the story of Super Bee
who flies at the speed of 90 mph. He leaves the engine of a westbound train
that’s traveling at 60 mph and flies until he reaches an eastbound train that’s
traveling at 75 mph along the same track. After barely touching the east-
bound train, he flies back to the westbound train, touches it, and flies back

Taxi driver
Imagine that you’re a taxi driver in Chicago and
that you’re driving a 1994 yellow cab. Your pas-
sengers are college students, and they want to
travel 4 miles from home to school. You’re driving
30 mph, and the tank is half full of fuel. One mile
into the trip, the tank is down to two-fifths full of
fuel, and the trip is over 15 minutes later. What is
the name and age of the cab driver?
Answer: Did you divide by one-half or multiply by two? How big was the tank?
All that was unnecessary. At the beginning of the story, it said to imagine that
you are the taxi driver. What are your name and age? There’s your answer!

and forth and back and forth between the trains until the trains finally meet.
Figure 16-1 shows you the two trains and Super Bee, flying between them.
The Problem: How far does a bee travel if it flies back and forth between
trains that are approaching each other on the same track — one train travel-
ing at 60 mph and the other traveling 75 mph — if the bee flies at 90 mph and,
when it started this journey, the trains were 648 miles apart?
You could determine how far the bee had to fly until it flew from the first train
to the second train — while the trains are getting closer to one another —
and then how far it had to fly back to the first train, and so on, until the trains
meet. Or, a much simpler way to do this is to figure out how long it will take
the trains to meet if they start 648 miles apart and are approaching each
other at the rate of 135 mph (the sum of 60 mph and 75 mph). When you’ve
determined how much time it takes, then you know how long the bee has
been flying and can multiply the time and the rate of 90 mph to get the dis-
tance. Because d = rt, in this case 648 = 135t. Dividing each side of the equa-
tion by 135, you get that t = 4.8 hours — the time it takes the trains to meet.
Multiplying 90 × 4.8, you get a distance of 432 miles. That’s one tired bee.
Equating the Distances Traveled
Many distance problems have the scenario that one person catches up with
another or one train or plane leaves later and finally passes the first one. The
common thread or theme for these problems is that the distance traveled by
the two participants is the same. You equate the distances. Some problems
have you solve for time — how long it took to catch up. Or you may solve for
how fast one or the other is traveling. And the question may even be about
the distance — how far they traveled before arriving at the same place. In
each case, though, the equation setup is the same.

Making it a matter of time
When two people leave the same place at different times, one has to travel
more quickly than the other to catch up — assuming that they’re both using
the same route.
The Problem: Henry left for work at 7 a.m. and drove at an average speed of
45 mph. Unfortunately, he forgot to put some important papers in his brief-
case. At 7:30, Betty found the papers, jumped in her car, and chased after
Henry. She averaged 55 mph. How long did it take for Betty to catch up to
Henry?
The distance that Henry drives and the distance that Betty drives is the
same — at the moment Betty catches up to Henry. So multiply the rate that
Henry drives times how long he drives and equate that to the rate that Betty
drives times her amount of time. Let the amount of time that Henry drives be
represented by t hours. Then Betty drives for t – 0.5 hours. Multiplying rate
times time, the equation and solution are:

Henry drove for 2.75 hours, or 2 hours and 45 minutes. If Betty drove for half
an hour less than that, she drove for 2 hours and 15 minutes.
You can solve directly for the amount of time that Betty traveled by letting
Betty’s time be t and Henry’s time be t + 0.5. The equation is just a bit differ-
ent, but the answer will still come out that Betty drove for 2.25 or 2 hours and
15 minutes.
In the classic story of the tortoise and the hare, the tortoise is slow and
steady, and the hare is just too sure of himself. Consider the next problem as
something that may have been the specific details of that story.
218
Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

The Problem: The tortoise and the hare are both poised at the starting line
of a 1-mile race. The tortoise can muster up a full 1-mile-per-hour speed,
and the hare boasts a hopping speed of 8-miles-per-hour. The starter’s gun
sounds, and both take off at their top speed. After one minute, the hare
decides he has time to take a nap and snoozes for the next 54 minutes. He
wakes up and makes a dash for the finish line. How long does it take him to
catch up to the tortoise?
The distance that both the tortoise and the hare travel are the precise
moment that the hare catches up to the tortoise. The rates are 1-mile-per-
hour for the tortoise and 8-miles-per-hour for the hare. The tortoise moves
along for t hours, and the hare has t minus 54 minutes (which has to be 
changed to miles per hour) so it’s

So the distances are equal and the hare catches up in a little more than one

and the hare hadn’t caught up to him yet, so the tortoise wins, yet again.

Trains in a tunnel
At 7 o’clock, a train enters a tunnel on the only
track that runs through that tunnel. Another
train enters the exact same tunnel at 7 o’clock
on the same day. There is no way for the trains
to pass, go around, over or under one another
in the tunnel. However, it was possible for the
trains to make it to the other end of the tunnel
untouched. How can that be?
Answer: One train entered the tunnel at 7 a.m. and the other at 7 p.m.

The Problem: Don left home with his fishing gear and headed for his favorite
spot at 6 a.m. Don bicycles at 6 mph. Don’s younger brother, Doug, left home
at 6:30 and caught up with Don at 6:45 a.m.. How fast did Doug have to travel
to catch up to Don at that time?
The distance traveled by the brothers is the same, so set the products of the
rates and respective times equal to one another. Don bicycled at 6 mph for
45 minutes. Doug traveled for just 15 minutes. Changing 45 minutes to
0.75 hour and 15 minutes to 0.25 hour, then the only unknown is Doug’s rate
of speed, which is represented by r. The equation 6(0.75) = r(0.25) sets the
two distances equal to one another. Simplifying on the left, you get 4.5 = 0.25r.
Dividing each side by 0.25, you get that r = 18 mph. Doug must be riding a
bike or driving.
The Problem: Carole left Tampa one hour after Warren. Carole caught up to
Warren 200 miles from Tampa, because she drove at a rate of speed that’s
125 percent Warren’s speed. How fast did Carole and Warren drive?
Both Carole and Warren drove 200 miles. Let r represent Warren’s speed and t
represent how long Warren drove to make that 200 miles. For Warren, you
write the equation 200 = rt. Carole drove the same 200 miles, but she drove
faster and for one hour less than Warren. For Carole, you write the equation
200 = (1.25r)(t – 1). Going back to Warren’s equation, solve for t in terms of
the 200 and r, and replace the t in Carole’s equation with that expression.

Warren drove at 40 mph, so it took him 5 hours (200 ÷ 40) to drive that
200 miles. Carole drove at 125 percent of Warren’s speed, so she drove at
50 mph. It took her four hours (200 ÷ 50) to drive the same distance — one
hour less than the time it took Warren.
220
Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

Solving for the distance
The main element of the distance = rate × time problems is the distance. You
solve for rate or time when given the distance or given the fact that the dis-
tances traveled by the participants are equal. Just as important is finding out
just how far people have traveled.
The Problem: Paula caught a bus to travel from school to home. Three hours
later, her brother, Ken left school to go home driving his own car. If Ken drove
20 miles per hour faster than the bus, and arrived home at the same time as
Paula, how far is it from school to home?
The distances are the same. You solve for the rate and time and then compute
the distance. Letting r represent the rate at which Paula is traveling on the bus,
Ken is driving at the rate of r + 20 mph. The time that Paula traveled is t hours,
and Ken traveled t – 3 hours. Letting the two distances be the same, you get the
equation rt = (r + 20)(t – 3). Multiplying on the right, you get rt = rt –3r + 20t – 60.
Subtracting rt from each side and adding 60 to each side, the equation becomes
60 = 20t – 3r. It appears that there are many different times and rates that fit
the solution as it’s given. Using the equation 60 = 20t – 3r you can try out some
values for t and r. Some possibilities are shown in Table 16-1.

Chapter 16: Taking the Time to Work on Distance

Several of the entries in the table are reasonable scenarios for Paula and Ken.
To actually finish the problem, you need a little more information. Assume,
for instance, that Ken drove 60 mph. That means that the bus Paula is riding
on is driving at 40 mph. The equation now becomes 40t = 60(t – 3), which mul-
tiplies out to be 40t = 60t – 180. Simplifying, you get 180 = 20t or t = 9. If Paula
rode 9 hours at 40 mph, then the distance from school to home is 40 × 9 =
360 miles.
When you’re racing against someone bigger or older or faster, and she wants
to make a contest of it, you can ask for a head start. Applying this situation to
a distance problem, you equate the distances by adding or subtracting the
head start to make the finish come out the same. Getting a head start helps
to even the playing field. It makes a race more of a contest and more interest-
ing if the runners appear to have an equal chance of winning.
The Problem: The contestant from Kenya can run the 10,000-meter race at an
average of 6 meters per second. The contestant from Ethiopia has a best time
so far of 5.5 meters per second. How far back should the runner from Kenya
start to have the expectation that they would cross the finish line at the same
time if they both start at the same time?
In this problem, the distances aren’t really equal. You have to add on x
number of meters to represent the additional distance that the runner from
Kenya must cover. The rates are also different, but the times will be the same,
if they start at the same time and finish at the same time. Take the distance
formula, d = rt and solve for t, giving you t
rd

. Now set the time it takes the
runner from Kenya equal to the time for the runner from Ethiopia. Then
change the times to distances and rates.

The runner from Kenya will have to start over 900 meters behind the other
runner. And that’s assuming that she can run her usual pace for an extra
900 meters.
Working It Out with Work Problems
Work problems usually involve two or more people pitching in together to
make a lighter load for everyone involved. Different people work at different
rates of speed, so some people accomplish more of the total job than others.
Here are the overriding principals or procedures to use in doing these 
problems:

4 f represent how much of the whole job is accomplished by 
the person who can do the job in 2, 3, 4, . . . days, respectively.
 Add up all the fractions with x in the numerator and set them equal to
the number 1 for the whole job (or a fraction for part of the job).
A traditional problem is that two or more people get together to paint a
house. You assume that everyone has a paint brush, paint, ladder, and any
other supplies needed to do the job. Working together, they reduce the
amount of time necessary to complete the whole job.
The Problem: Tom, Dick, and Harry arrive early one morning at the job site
and get ready to paint a huge, old, Victorian mansion. Tom, working by him-
self, could paint the whole house in 14 days. It would take Dick 10 days to do
the job by himself. And Harry could do the job in 8 days. How long does it
take for the three men to do the job working together?
Let x represent the amount of time needed to do the whole job. Then Tom 
will do x
14 of the job, Dick will do x
10 of the job, and Harry will do x
8 of the 
job. Add the fractions together and set them equal to 1.

It will take the men not quite three and a half days to do the job by working
together.
In some instances, though, the whole crew doesn’t show up at the same time.
The Problem: A three-man crew can harvest the field in six hours, while a
four-man crew can harvest the field in four hours. If the three-man crew
worked for one hour and then were joined by the fourth man, how long will it
take the four-man crew to finish the job? How long does it take from start to
finish to do the whole job?
First, determine how much is accomplished by the three-man crew before the
fourth man shows up. Then determine how long it’ll take to finish up the job.
If the three-man crew can do the harvesting in six hours, then in one hour, 
they’ve done 6
1 of the job and have 6
5 left to finish. Let x represent how long 
it’ll take to finish the job, divide by 4 (the amount of time it takes the four-
man crew to do the whole job) and set x
4 equal to the fraction of the job 
that’s left. Solve for x by cross-multiplying.

It’ll take another 3 hours and 20 minutes to finish the job. Add that to the
hour spent by the three-man crew, and the whole harvesting process took
4 hours and 20 minutes.
What if someone leaves before finishing the job? After all, people get tired or
have other commitments. Have you ever been left to finish up a project that
many other people had started? I’ll at least make this next job something fun
to do.

The Problem: Sarah, Sue, and Sybil are making chocolate-chip cookies for the
annual club bake sale. Working alone, it would take Sarah 8 hours to do all
the baking. Sue could do the whole job in 10 hours, and it would take Sybil
12 hours by herself. They all started working early in the morning. But, after
2 hours, Sybil said that she had to leave for an appointment and wouldn’t be
back. One hour after that, Sue got tired of listening to Sarah’s griping and left.
How long did it take Sarah to finish up the job by herself, after the other
two left?
First, figure out how much of the job got accomplished during the first two
hours, before Sybil left. If Sarah can do the job alone in 8 hours, then she did

Incoming and Outgoing
Filling and draining pools and tanks are just other variations on work prob-
lems. When you have more than one water pipe pumping water into a tank,
it takes less time than one pipe doing the filling by itself. An added twist to
these problems is that the tanks can be emptying, too. If your pool has a leak
in it, then water is going out one hole at the same time it’s coming in a pipe.
The Problem: A backyard swimming pool is being filled by two different hoses.
One hose can fill the pool in 10 hours, and it takes the other hose 14 hours to
fill the pool. How long will it take for the two hoses to fill the pool if they’re
turned on at the same time?
Let x represent the amount of time it’ll take the two hoses, working together,
to fill the pool. Then write two fractions, one with x divided by 10 and the
other with x divided by 14 to represent how much of the whole job each hose
can accomplish. Add the two fractions together, set the sum equal to 1, and
solve for x.

It took another 5 hours and 15 minutes to fill the pool after the drain was
closed, so the total time was 8 hours and 15 minutes.
The Problem: In the tank of a water tower, the intake valve closes automati-
cally when the tank is full and opens up again when 5
3 of the water is drained 
off. The intake fills the tank in 4 hours, and the outlet drains the tank in 12
hours. If the outlet is open continuously, then how long a time is it between
two different instances when the tank is completely full?
Start with the first instance that the tank is full. The intake valve closes, and
only the outlet valve is working, emptying the tank. You need to determine 
how long it takes for the outlet valve to empty the tank by 5
3 , leaving it 5
2 full. 
Divide x, the amount of time it’ll take to lower the amount in the tank, by 12.

It takes 7 hours and 12 minutes for the amount of water in the tank to reach
the level at which the intake valve switches on. Now you determine how long
it takes to fill the tank again. Let x represent the total amount of time needed.
Divide x by 4 for the intake value and subtract the fraction formed by dividing 
x by 12 for the outlet. Set the difference equal to 5

that needs to be filled. Solve for x by first multiplying each term by 60, the

It’ll take another 3 hours and 36 minutes to fill the tank. Add the 7 hours and

riting an equation to use for solving a story problem is more than half
the battle. Once you have a decent equation involving a variable that
represents some number or amount, then the actual algebra needed to solve
the equation is typically pretty easy.
Many word problems lend themselves to more than one equation with more
than one variable. It’s easier to write two separate equations, but it takes
more work to solve them for the unknowns. And, in order for there to be a
solution at all, you have to have at least as many equations as variables.
Most of the problems in this chapter deal with the more typical two-equation
solutions, but I include a section on dealing with three or more equations, too.
Writing Two Equations and Substituting
Word problems often deal with how many of two or more coins, how many
ducks and elephants, how much to invest in this or that, how many red and
green jelly beans, and so on. You let variables represent the numbers of coins
or ducks or dollars or jelly beans. When working with two different equations
written about the same situation, then you have two different variables and
need to do some algebra to knock that down to one equation. That’s where
substitution comes in.

Solving systems by substitution
A system of two linear equations, such as 2x + 3y = 31 and 5x – y = 1 is usually
solved by elimination or substitution. (Refer to Algebra For Dummies if you
want a full explanation of each type of solution method.) For the problems in
this chapter, I use the substitution method, to solve for a variable. This means
that you change the format of one of the equations so that it expresses what
one of the variables is equal to in terms of the other, and then you substitute
into the other equation. For example, you solve for y in terms of x in the
equation 3x + y = 11 if you subtract 3x from each side and write the equation
as y = 11 – 3x.
Consider solving the system 2x + 3y = 31 and 5x – y = 1. First go to the second
equation and rewrite it with y on one side and everything else on the other
side. You choose the second equation, because the y variable has a coeffi-
cient of –1. Having a coefficient of 1 or –1 is desirable, because you can avoid
working with fractions.
A coefficient is a factor or multiplier of a variable. The term 3x has a coeffi-
cient of 3, and the term kx has a coefficient of k.
To solve for y in terms of x in 5x – y = 1, you first add y to each side of the
equation and then subtract 1 from each side.
x

Now substitute into the first equation. Because y = 5x – 1, replace the y in the

You determine that x = 2. Now determine what y is equal to by putting the 2 in
for x in the equation y = 5x – 1. You get that y = 5(2) – 1 = 10 – 1 = 9. So the
solution of the system of equations is that x = 2 and y = 9.
The rest of this chapter deals with how to use substitution in systems of
equations to solve word problems.

Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

Working with numbers 
and amounts of coins
Some problems involving coins are more easily solved using two equations
rather than just one, as you find in Chapter 8. If you’re nickeling and diming,
then you let n represent the number of nickels and d represent the number of
dimes. And if you have a total of ten coins, then n + d = 10. The rest of the
information in the problem helps you write the other equation.
The Problem: You have ten coins in nickels and dimes. You have two less
than five times as many dimes as nickels. How much money do you have?
First, you solve for the number of each type of coin. Then you determine
what the total worth is, multiplying the number of nickels by 5¢ and dimes by
10¢. Let the number of nickels be represented by n and the number of dimes
be represented by d. You write that the total number of coins is ten with the
equation n + d = 10. You write that the number of dimes is two less than five
times the number of nickels with the equation d = 5n – 2. As you see, the
second equation already has d in terms of n and –2, so substitute 5n – 2 in for
d in the first equation and solve for n.

You have two nickels, so there are 5(2) – 2 = 10 – 2 = 8 dimes. Two nickels are
10¢, and eight dimes are 80¢, so you have a total of 90¢.
The Problem: You have a total of 40 coins in nickels and quarters. If you
double the number of quarters and add 12, you’ll get the same number of
coins as you’d have if you multiply the number of nickels by 4 and subtract 4.
How much money do you have in quarters?
First, determine how many nickels and quarters by writing one equation
where the sum of the number of each type of coin is 40. Then write another
equation involving the relationship between the number of each coin. You
can determine how much money you have in quarters when you know how
many quarters you have.
Let n represent the number of nickels and q represent the number of 
quarters. Your first equation is n + q = 40. The second equation sets the
two relationships between the number of coins equal to one another. Let
double the number of quarters and add 12 be represented by 2q + 12, and
231
Chapter 17: Being Systematic with Systems of Equations

let multiply the number of nickels by 4 and subtract 4 be represented by 4n – 4.
The second equation reads: 2q + 12 = 4n – 4. You can do some simplifying
and rearranging with the second equation, but I’m going to just solve for q
in the first equation and substitute into the second equation. If n + q = 40,
then q = 40 – n. Substituting and solving for q,

You have 24 quarters, giving you 24(0.25) = $6. Does the number of coins
check out? If you have 40 coins in all, and 24 are quarters, then you have 16
nickels. Doubling the number of quarters and adding 12 gives you 2(24) + 12 =
48 + 12 = 60. Multiplying the number of nickels by 4 and subtracting 4, you get
4(16) – 4 = 64 – 4 = 60. It checks.
Figuring out the purchases of fast food
You’re sent out to pick up some refreshments for the guys working on a proj-
ect. You’ve gotten their orders and collected the money, but you’ve lost the
piece of paper with the exact listing of what everyone wants. Good thing you
know how to solve word problems with numbers of items and cost per item.
Math saves the day, yet again.
The Problem: You collected a total of $25 for hamburgers and soft drinks. The
hamburgers cost $2.50 each, and the soft drinks cost $1.50 each. Also, the
number of hamburgers ordered is three less than twice as many soft drinks.
How many hamburgers and how many soft drinks were ordered?
Write two equations — one involving the number of each item times its
respective cost, and the other involving the total number of items ordered.
Let the number of hamburgers be represented by h and the number of soft
drinks be represented by d. Multiplying h by 2.50 and d by 1.50, the total for
the whole order is 2.50h + 1.50d = 25. The number of hamburgers, h, is three
less than twice the number of soft drinks, 2d – 3. Set h = 2d – 3. Now replace
the h in the first equation with 2d – 3 and solve for h.

So 5 soft drinks were ordered. The number of hamburgers is 2(5) – 3 = 10 – 3 = 7
hamburgers. Five soft drinks at $1.50 each is $7.50. Seven hamburgers at $2.50
each is $17.50, for an order that totals $25.
The Problem: Last night, the Fish House Diner sold some crab-cake dinners
and shrimp baskets for a total of $705. The crab-cake dinners cost $9, and the
shrimp baskets cost $11.50. If you multiply the number of crab-cake dinners
by three and add it to twice the number of shrimp baskets, you get 180 din-
ners. How many of each were sold?
Let the number of crab-cake dinners be represented with c and the number of
shrimp baskets be represented with b. Multiply the number of each type item
by its price and set the sum equal to $705. The equation is 9c + 11.50b = 705.
Now write an equation involving the relationship between the numbers of
orders. Three times the number of crab-cake dinners is 3c, and twice the
number of shrimp baskets is 2b. So 3c + 2b = 180. This system of equations
doesn’t have a variable with a coefficient of 1 or –1.

Breaking Even and Making a Profit
Anyone in business will tell you that she’s interested in making a profit. Oh,
well, the movie and musical The Producers violates that premise, but you
don’t hold with make-believe. In general, the profit from a venture is com-
puted by taking the revenue earned and subtracting the cost that it takes to
earn the revenue. Different factors keep pulling the costs up and the prices
down, so it’s a real balancing act to be in business nowadays and make that
profit.
Finding the break-even point
The break-even point in business is when the revenue (the money brought in)
is equal to the cost (the money spent to earn the revenue). When a business
gets past the break-even point, it shows a profit. To find the break-even point,

Weighing in on a million dollars
You’re on one of those game shows where you
get to pick a box or a curtain or some container
so you can win lots of money. You make your
choice and see the words One Million flashing

lie on the floor with $1 million in $1 bills on your
chest for one minute, then you get to take all
that money home. Your other choice is to take
$50,000 in cash. Which do you choose?
Answer: A $1 bill weighs 1 gram. There are 454 grams in a pound, so $454
weighs 1 pound. Consequently, $1 million weighs over 1 ton. You’ll never
survive to spend the money. Take the $50,000 and run — fast!

you determine when the revenue and the costs are equal. You use a system of
equations to solve the problem.
The Problem: You decide to go into the sandal-making business. Your startup
costs are $1,600, and it costs you $40 per pair of sandals to produce them.
You write your total cost function as C = 1,600 + 40x, where x is the number of
pairs of sandals that you produce. The price at which you sell the sandals is
dependent on the number of pairs you sell, so there isn’t a fixed price (you
lower the price to be able to sell more). In this case, the amount of revenue
you get from selling x pairs of sandals is found with R = 100x – 0.5x2. What is
the break-even point? How many pairs of sandals do you have to produce and
sell to start making a profit?
Consider some cost and revenue values. Table 17-1 shows the revenue, total
cost, and net result for x = 10, 20, 30, and 40 pairs of sandals.

When 40 pairs of sandals are produced, the revenue and the cost are the
same, so x = 40 is the break-even point.
Making this table is helpful, but it isn’t very practical. A better method is to
solve the system of equations. The two equations involved are C = 1,600 + 40x
and R = 100x – 0.5x2. Replace the C and the R with y, letting the y represent
the amount of money spent in the cost function and the amount of money
earned in the revenue function. You want to find out when those two amounts
are the same to find the break-even point. Then replace the y in y = 1,600 + 40x
with 100x – 0.5x2 from the equation y = 100x – 0.5x2. Solve for the value of x.

You end up with a quadratic equation. You can factor the equation or you can
use the quadratic formula. (See the Cheat Sheet for the formula.) I show you
factoring, in the following equation, after multiplying every term by 2 so that
the coefficient of the x2 term becomes a 1.

You end up with two different solutions. The first solution is the one shown
in Table 17-1. After you hit sales of 40 pairs of sandals, you’ve broken even
and can start to make money. Unfortunately, if you make and sell more than
80 pairs, you start to lose money. Your expenses get too high, and it becomes
too costly to produce and sell at that level.
Determining the profit
The break-even point can be where you start seeing some profit to your ven-
ture. After you’ve reached the point where increased sales will start making
you some money, you earn profit. The amount of the profit is determined by
subtracting the cost from the revenue. P = R – C. What level of sales will earn
a particular amount of profit?
The Problem: A businessman wants to know when the sale of a particular
item reaches a profit level of $2,000. The revenue equation is R = 200x – 0.4x2,
and the cost to produce x items is determined with C = 4,000 + 100x. How
many items have to be produced and sold to net a profit of $2,000?
Use the equation P = R – C and replace the P with 2,000. Put the revenue equa-
tion and cost equation in their respective positions and solve the equation
for x.

Mixing It Up with Mixture Problems
Mixture problems are covered in great detail in Chapter 14. You mix so many
quarts of one substance with quarts of another substance. Some rather inter-
esting solutions or mixture problems are made possible by introducing the
second equation and solving the system.
Gassing up at the station
It’s no easy choice when you pull up at the gas station to fill up your vehicle.
First, you have to take a deep breath about the price, and then you have to
choose between regular gas, premium gas, or even gas that contains ethanol.
The Problem: Stefanie finds that she gets 19 miles per gallon with regular gas
that costs $2.70 per gallon and 23 miles per gallon with the premium gas that
costs $3.15 per gallon. She paid a total of $104.40 for gas on a trip of 748 miles.
How many gallons of each type gas did she buy?
One of the equations you need deals with cost, and the other deals with the
number of miles. The common element in both equations is the number of gal-
lons of each type of gas — and the number of gallons answers the question,
too. Let r represent the number of gallons of regular gas and p represent the
number of gallons of premium gas. The total cost, $104.40 = $2.70r + $3.15p.
The total number of miles, 748 = 19r + 23p. None of the coefficients of the vari-
ables is equal to 1, so you have to make a choice as to which variable to solve
for. Because the coefficient 19 is the smallest number, I opt to solve for r in
the second equation and replace the r in the first equation with that equiva-
lence in terms of p.

Distributing the 2.70 and simplifying don’t make for very pretty computa-
tions, but a calculator makes short work of all the operations. I choose to find
a common denominator to combine the fractions and decimals, because the
decimal you get with a denominator of 19 just keeps repeating. Then you
solve for p by multiplying each side of the equation by the reciprocal of its
coefficient.

Stefanie used 16 gallons of premium gas. Substitute the 16 for p in the equation
19r + 23p = 748, and you get 19r + 23(16) = 748. This simplifies to 19r + 368 = 748.
Subtracting 368 from each side, the equation becomes 19r = 380. Dividing each
side by 19, you get that r = 20. She bought 20 gallons of regular gas.
Backtracking for all the answers
Problems involving mixtures have the upfront answers of how many gallons
of this or how many items of that. Applications of these problems often
involve more than just the numbers. In a gallons-of-gasoline problem, you
may want to know the average cost per gallon for the trip. In a fund-raising
project, you probably want to know something about the total profit.
The Problem: A service group is selling candy bars and bags of almonds for a
fund-raiser. They’re selling the candy bars (which cost them 40 cents each)
for $1 and the bags of almonds (which cost them 50¢ each) for $1.25. Their
total receipts (revenue) for the sale of 1,350 items was $1,500. How many of
each item did they sell, and what was their profit?
Write an equation about the total receipts by multiplying the amount charged
by the number of each type of item. Write an equation about the total number
of items by adding the number of each type together and setting it equal to
1,350. Letting the number of candy bars be represented by c and the number
of bags of almonds be represented by a, the two equations are: $1c + $1.25a =
$1,500 and c + a = 1,350. Solve for c in the second equation and substitute the
equivalent into the first equation.

Now simplify the equation, subtract 1,350 from each side, and solve for a by

The group sold 600 bags of almonds. That means that 1,350 – 600 = 750 candy
bars were sold. To figure out the cost for these items, multiply 750 times 40¢
and 600 times 50¢. Their cost was 750($0.40) + 600($0.50) = $300 + $300 = $600.
If the total receipts were $1,500, then subtract the $600 from $1,500 to get
$900 profit.
Making Several Comparisons with
More Than Two Equations
Some situations have more than two or three things acting on an outcome.
The type of gasoline used may involve not only the cost of the fuel and the
mileage the car gets on the fuel, but it also may involve the availability of the
fuel or the speed at which the pump flows. When a problem involves three
or more different influences, a system of equations involving three or more
equations is used.
Picking flowers for a bouquet
Florists make up bouquets by mixing complementary colors and types of
flowers and greenery. The cost of the bouquet depends on the different types
of flowers and materials used.
239
Chapter 17: Being Systematic with Systems of Equations
Cows and hens
In a recent Ask Marilyn column in the Sunday
Parade magazine, the following question was
posed: If a barnyard of 30 animals — cows and
hens — had a total of 74 feet, then how many
cows and how many hens were in the barnyard?
Answer: Most people reading that column didn’t have the benefit of being
able to write two equations and solving them. The answer is 7 cows and 23
hens. Did you do it without a system of equations? Do you want to know the
equations needed? Okay, they’re c + h = 30 and 4c + 2h = 74.

The Problem: A bouquet is to contain 24 flowers, made up of roses, carna-
tions, and daisies. The person buying the bouquet wants twice as many car-
nations as roses and doesn’t want to spend more than $8.20. If roses cost 50¢
each, carnations 25¢ each, and daisies 40¢ each, then what composition of
flowers should be used to match that maximum price?
Write three different equations: one involving the total number of flowers, one
involving the total cost for the bouquet, and one involving the relationship
between the number of carnations and roses. Letting the number of roses be
represented by r, the number of carnations represented by c, and the number
of daisies by d, the three equations are: r + c + d = 24, 0.50r + 0.25c + 0.40 d =
8.20, and c = 2r. You can hone this system of three equations down to two
equations by substituting 2r for c in each of the first two equations. Then you
have the two equations:

Coming up with a game plan for 
solving systems of equations
In the example in the preceding section, one of the equations in the system of
equations had a convenient relationship. The equation c = 2r allowed for a
quick substitution back into the other two equations, creating a nice system
240
Part III: Tackling Word Problems from Algebra 

of equations that solved by substitution. When you aren’t quite so lucky to
have a problem with such a nice feature to it, you need a more general game
plan for solving.
When solving a system of three or more linear equations, the following guide-
lines will help with the solution:
 Select variables to represent the different amounts or units.
 Create a table or chart with the variables and their descriptions down
one side and the different relationships (prices, numbers, and so on)
across the top.
 Write equations using the variables and relationships from the table.
 Solve for one of the variables in one of the equations and substitute
back into the other equations. Repeat the process until you have one
equation with just one variable.
Graphing calculators and spreadsheets are very useful when doing problems
involving a large number of variables. The following problem shows you
something quite manageable using the substitution method.
The Problem: Sherrill bought 40 dozen cookies for $350. The chocolate-chip
cookies cost $10 per dozen; the oatmeal-raisin cookies cost $9 per dozen;
and the peanut-butter cookies and snickerdoodles each cost $8 per dozen.
Sherrill got two more dozen chocolate-chip cookies than peanut-butter cook-
ies, and she bought twice as many snickerdoodles as oatmeal-raisin cookies.
How many dozen of each type did she buy?
This problem is solved by writing four different equations. Let c represent
how many dozen chocolate-chip cookies, r represent the number of dozen of
oatmeal-raisin cookies, p the number of dozen of peanut-butter cookies, and
d the number of dozen snickerdoodles. Make a table representing the differ-
ent relationships (see Table 17-2).

Now write equations using the columns of the table. In the “Dozen Of”
column, you add up the dozens and let the sum be 40, giving you:
c + r + p + d = 40
Next, write an equation multiplying the prices times their respective types
and having the total be $350:
10c + 9r + 8p + 8d = 350
Next, write the relationship between the dozens of chocolate-chip and
peanut-butter cookies: c = p + 2. And finally, write the relationship between
the dozens of oatmeal-raisin and snickerdoodles: d = 2r. The following shows
the system of equations written in rectangular form, with all the same vari-
ables lined up under one another. This is the form you’d use in a calculator,

Sherrill bought 6 dozen oatmeal-raisin cookies. She bought twice as many (or
12 dozen) snickerdoodles. Replacing r with 6 in the equation 2p + 3r = 38, you
get 2p + 18 = 38, which becomes 2p = 20, or p = 10. She bought 10 dozen
peanut-butter cookies. And, if she bought two more dozen chocolate chip
than peanut butter, she bought 12 dozen chocolate-chip cookies.
Solving Systems of Quadratic Equations
A quadratic equation occurs when you have one or more terms containing a
variable raised to the second power. For example, the equation y = 3x2 + 2x is a
quadratic equation. Solving systems of equations involving quadratic equa-
tions leads to some interesting results. You usually end up with more than one
solution to the system. Sometimes more than one solution means that there’s
more than one answer. Often, though, it means that one of the answers fits the
situation and the other is just extraneous — it satisfies the system of equa-
tions, but it doesn’t really have any meaning in the practical problem.
Counting on number problems
A common type of problem involving systems of equations is a number problem,
where you solve for a certain number that has a particular relationship to one
or more other numbers. You incorporate operations such as addition and multi-
plication, and you often use squares of numbers or their reciprocals.
The Problem: The sum of two numbers is 40, and the product of those same
two numbers is 204. What are the numbers?
243
Chapter 17: Being Systematic with Systems of Equations
Drawing money out of a bag
A bag contains ten $5 bills, ten $10 bills and ten
$20 bills. Jack is blindfolded and told that he
may draw bills out of the bag, one at a time, until
he has three of the same denomination of bill.
He can keep all the money drawn from the bag
until he has to stop. What is the greatest amount
of money Jack may draw from the bag?
Answer: Jack can get, at most $90. If he draws two $5 bills, two $10 bills,
and two $20 bills, he still doesn’t have three of the same type. That’s a total
of $70 dollars. The third $20 bill makes it $90, and he has to stop.

Let the two numbers be represented by the variables x and y. Writing that
their sum is 40, the equation is x + y = 40. You write that their product is 204
with xy = 204. Solve for y in the first equation to get y = 40 – x. Now replace
the y in the second equation with 40 – x, simplify the equation by setting it
equal to 0, and solve the quadratic equation by factoring.

You get that x is either 34 or 6. These are the two numbers whose sum is 40
and whose product is 204.
The Problem: The difference between two positive numbers is 20. If you
square the larger number and subtract ten times the smaller number from
the square, you get 575. What are the two numbers?
Let the two numbers be represented by x and y. Write their difference as 
x – y = 20. Squaring the larger number and subtracting ten times the smaller,
you get x2 – 10y = 575. Why does x have to be the larger number? It’s because
the two numbers are positive, and the result of subtracting y from x has to be
a positive 20.
Now, solve for x in the first equation to get x = 20 + y. Substitute this into the
second equation and solve for y.

The two solutions of the equation are y = 5 and y = –35. You discard the 
y = –35, because the problem asks for positive numbers. If y = 5, then 
x = 20 + 5 = 25. The two numbers are 25 and 5.
The Problem: One integer is four smaller than another. The sum of their 
reciprocals is 24
5 . What are the numbers?
Let the two numbers be represented by x and x – 4. Writing that the sum of the 
reciprocals of these two numbers is equal to 24, you have: x

Technically, this is a system-of-equations problem, because you could write

done here almost automatically.

Picking points on circles
The equation of a circle with its center at the origin is x2 + y2 = r2, where r is
the radius of the circle. It isn’t always easy to pick nice numbers — integers
or fractions — that are coordinates of the points on a circle. For example, if a
circle has a radius of 5, you can use 3s and 4s for the xs and ys. The points
(3,4), (–3,4), (–4,–3) and so on work. So do combinations of 0s and 5s. The
number of nice coordinates is limited.
You can find an infinite number of nice fractions that work for the coordinates
of the points on a unit circle (a circle with a radius of 1).
Let m be any rational number, and the ordered pair

The Problem: Find the coordinates of the points on the unit circle with its
center at the origin that are shared with any line going through the point
(–1,0) on that circle. Distinguish between the different lines that go through
(–1,0) by letting m represent the slopes of the different lines.
Find the common solution of the circle, x2 + y2 = 1 and the line y = mx + b. The
particular line that goes through the point (–1,0), has an equation that can be
written a little more specially. Finding the slope of this line, m, using the slope 
formula and the points (x, y) and (–1,0), you get m

eometry: You either love it or hate it. Geometry word
problems really are your friends. They almost always
involve a formula that you insert and then solve. The main
challenge to doing word problems involving geometry is in
ﬁnding the right formula for the right problem. Draw a pic-
ture, insert the given numbers, and you’re on your way!

f you’ve taken a math class, you’ve probably heard of the Pythagorean 
theorem. You may not remember what it does, but you probably remem-
ber it has something to do with triangles. In this chapter, I reintroduce you to
Pythagoras and his theorem. I cover applications where you assume that
buildings are at right angles with the ground and that streets are perpendicu-
lar to one another at the corner. These assumptions aren’t always completely
accurate, but the answers you get using these assumptions are close enough
that you can forgive a little variance.
The Pythagorean theorem says that, in a right triangle whose two shorter sides
(or legs) measure a and b, and whose longest side (or hypotenuse) measures c,
it’s always true that a2 + b2 = c2. Figure 18-1 shows you how these parts go
together in a right triangle.

Finding the Height of an Object
You measure your own height with a tape measure or yardstick, and you mea-
sure the walls in a room by standing on a chair and using a tape measure or
other instrument. But what about finding the height of a tree or building
that’s too tall to reach the top of or inaccessible to you? Enter, our hero,
Mr. Pythagoras and the Pythagorean theorem.
Determining the height of a tree
You want to decorate the tree in your front yard and put a light on the top. You
can rent a cherry picker that reaches 20 feet into the air (and you’re brave
enough to get into the basket). Right now, you have a kite string stretching
from the top of the tree to a point on the ground. Figure 18-2 shows you the
string and the tree and the point on the ground.
The Problem: How tall is a tree if a kite string stretched from the top of the
tree to a point on the ground measures 39 feet, and the distance from the
base of the tree to that same point on the ground measures 36 feet? (Will you
be able to put your star on the top of the tree if you can reach 20 feet high?)
You want to use the Pythagorean theorem, but must be careful to assign
the right numbers to the different variables. Assume that the tree is perpen-
dicular to the ground, making the right angle opposite the kite string. The
hypotenuse is 39 feet, and one of the shorter sides is 36 feet. Using a2 + b2 = c2,
39 feet
36 feet
Figure 18-2:

how tall the

252
Part IV: Taking the Shape of Geometric Word Problems 

and letting a = 36 and c = 39, the equation reads 362 + b2 = 392. Simplifying, you
get 1,296 + b2 = 1,521. Subtract 1,296 from each side, and you find that b2 = 225.
Taking the square root of each side, the solution of the equation is that b = ±15.
You ignore the negative answer — you want a positive height. So, if the tree is
only 15 feet high, you’ll be able to reach the top to attach the star.
Sighting a tower atop a mountain
You’re waiting patiently in line to catch a ride to the top of a mountain so you
can ski down. You know the height of the mountain and the length of the
cable carrying the skiers on their T-bars. But just how tall is that tower that’s
sitting on top of the mountain?
The Problem: A 1,230-foot cable stretches from the starting point of a ski
lift to the top of a tower that sits on the highest point of a ski slope (see
Figure 18-3). The mountain is 1,150 feet tall, and the starting point of the ski
lift is 270 feet from a point directly under the tower. How tall is the tower?
When you determine the combined height of the tower and the top of the ski
slope, you can subtract the height of the ski slope from that combined height
to get the height of the tower. The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the
cable carrying the skiers. Using a2 + b2 = c2, let a represent the total height,
b represent the horizontal distance, and c represent the length of the cable.
Your equation becomes a2 + 2702 = 1,2302. Simplifying, you get a2 + 72,900 =
1,512,900. Subtracting 72,900 from each side, a2 = 1,440,000. The positive
square root of 1,440,000 is 1,200. Because the mountain is 1,150 feet tall, the
tower must be 1,200 – 1,150 = 50 feet tall.

Finding the height of a window
How tall is the window in a building? You can’t go inside the building to take
the measurements, but you have information about some distances outside.
The distance from the top of the window and the bottom of the window to a
single point on the ground are known numbers.
The Problem: From a point on the ground 33 feet away from the base of a
building, the distance from the point to the top of a window is 65 feet, and the
distance from the same point to the bottom of the window is 55 feet (see
Figure 18-4). How tall is the window?
Two different right triangles are in play with this problem. You have one right
triangle with a hypotenuse of 55 feet and side of 33 feet, and another right tri-
angle with a hypotenuse of 65 feet and same side of 33 feet. Find the missing
side of each right triangle and, then, find the difference between the two sides
to determine the height of the window. The smaller right triangle is solved
using a2 + 332 = 552, and the larger right triangle is solved with a2 + 332 = 652.

Determining Distances between Planes
Planes travel at different speeds and different heights. A traffic controller has
the responsibility of keeping the planes a safe distance from one another. Air
traffic control is just another opportunity for Pythagoras to be of assistance.
Working with the distance apart
Two fighter jets leave the same airbase at the same time and travel at right
angles from one another. How far apart are they after a certain amount of time?
The Problem: Jet A leaves the airport at 4 p.m. traveling due east at 550 mph.
Jet B leaves the same airport at 4 p.m. traveling due south at 480 mph. How
far apart are the jets at 7 p.m.?
Let the distances traveled by the jets be the two legs of a right triangle. Use
d = rt to determine the distance traveled by each jet in the three hours that
they flew. The eastbound jet traveled 550 × 3 = 1,650 miles, and the south-
bound jet traveled 480 × 3 = 1,440 miles. Using the Pythagorean theorem,
1,6502 + 1,4402 = c2 , where c is the distance between the two jets. Simplifying,
you get that 2,722,500 + 2,073,600 = c2 or 4,796,100 = c2. Taking the square root
of each side and considering only the positive root, you get that c = 2,190.
The two jets are 2,190 miles apart after three hours.
What if two jets leave at different times, and you want to determine the speed
at which a particular jet is traveling? Use the distance formula and the
Pythagorean theorem.
The Problem: One jet leaves the airport at noon traveling north at 800 mph.
Another jet leaves the same airport at 2 p.m. traveling west. At 3 p.m., the
two jets are 2,500 miles apart (see Figure 18-5). What is the speed of the 
westbound jet?

Figure 18-5:
The planes

255
Chapter 18: Plying Pythagoras

The hypotenuse of the right triangle formed is 2,500 miles. The jet traveling
north flew for three hours. Using d = rt, d = 800 × 3 = 2,400 miles. The jet trav-
eling west flew for one hour, so d = r × 1 or d = r. After you find that distance,
d, you have the rate of the jet. Using the Pythagorean theorem and letting the
horizontal (westward) distance be d, you get 2,4002 + d 2 = 2,5002. Simplifying,
5,760,000 + d 2 = 6,250,000. Subtracting 5,760,000 from each side, d 2 = 490,000
or d = 700. The westbound jet is traveling at 700 mph.
Taking into account the wind blowing
When the plane you’re traveling in has a good tailwind, you make even better
time than anticipated. A headwind slows things down a bit. The blowing wind
is taken into consideration when figuring how fast a plane is moving and in
what direction it’s actually heading.
The Problem: Two planes leave the same airport at the same time. The plane
traveling due east is moving at 190 mph but has a headwind blowing against
it at 40 mph. The plane traveling due north has a tail wind of 70 mph to help it
along. At the end of one hour, the planes are 250 miles apart. How fast is the
northbound plane traveling (what’s its speed)?
Use the Pythagorean theorem with the eastbound and northbound distances
as the legs of the triangle and the hypotenuse as the 250-mile distance apart
that the planes are after an hour. The rate of the eastbound plane is 190 – 40
or 150 mph. Let the speed of the northbound plane be represented with r,
and add 70 to that amount. Writing the values in their appropriate places in
the Pythagorean theorem, you have 1502 + (r + 70)2 = 2502. Squaring the two
numbers and the binomial and solving for r,

The answer that r = –270 is discarded as being extraneous. The northbound

Figuring Out Where to Land the Boat
A fisherman is out in his boat, a certain distance from the shoreline. He needs
to come ashore, walk down the beach a bit, and then walk inland to his home.
256
Part IV: Taking the Shape of Geometric Word Problems 

The rate at which he can row is different from the rate at which he can walk.
Where he comes ashore affects how far he rows and how far he walks. In
Figure 18-6, you see a generalized picture for the problems presented in this
section.
Conserving distance
If a fisherman rows straight to shore, then walks along the beach until his
home is the closest distance to the shoreline and walks inland, then he actu-
ally will have traveled farther than necessary. He probably will have taken
more time than necessary, too. Aiming for a point down the shore to land his
boat and then walking diagonally to his home will save time.
Computing the distance saved
Comparing the distance traveled along the sides of a right triangle and com-
paring the sum to the distance along the hypotenuse requires an application
of the Pythagorean theorem. Applying this to a fisherman and his trip home,
you find the difference in the distance traveled to get home the long way and
the shortcut. The long way would be to go straight to shore, walk along the
shore until he’s opposite his home, and then walk to his home. The shortcut
involves heading for a point down the beach and then traveling diagonally to
and from the point.
The Problem: Fisherman Fred is 3 miles off shore in his boat. His home is
19 miles down the shore and 8 miles inland. How much shorter is it to cut
diagonally toward a point 4 miles down the beach and then travel diagonally
from that point to his home?

Figure 18-6:

257
Chapter 18: Plying Pythagoras

The long way and the shortcut involve the sides and hypotenuses of two
right triangles. In Figure 18-7, you see the sides of the right triangle as being
the long way and the diagonals as the shortcut.
If Fred goes directly to shore (3 miles) and then travels along the shore to
the point where he can head straight inland toward home, he travels a total
of 3 + 19 + 8 = 30 miles. Heading diagonally for a point 4 miles down the
shore and then diagonally across the land toward home, the distances are
the hypotenuses of two right triangles. The first right triangle has legs mea-
suring 3 and 4 miles. Using the Pythagorean theorem, 32 + 42 = c2. 25 = c2, so c,
or the hypotenuse, is 5 miles. The other triangle has one side that’s 8 miles
long. The other side is 19 – 4 or 15 miles long. Using the Pythagorean
Theorem, 82 + 152 = c2. Squaring the numbers and adding, 64 + 225 = 289 = 172.
So that hypotenuse is 17. Add the 5 and 17 to get 22 miles, which is 8 miles
shorter than going along the sides.
Considering rate and time
Two other considerations of taking a shorter route are the time that can
be saved and the rates at which each leg of the journey are traveled. Some
people can walk faster than they can row a boat, but others can really move
through the water. Also, if the boat has a motor, then water travel may be
the more efficient, but a bicycle or car can change the whole scenario.
The Problem: Kayaker Katie is 7 miles from shore, paddling along on a
bright, sunny day. She needs to get to the store to pick up some sunscreen.
The store is 32 miles down the coast and 6 miles inland. Katie can paddle
two-and-a-half times as fast as she can walk, so she lands x miles down the
shore and walks directly to the store. If Katie spends as much time paddling
as walking, then how far down the shore does she land? Figure 18-8 shows
you the relative positions and helps you see the triangles formed.

Find the two distances along the hypotenuses (in terms of x) using the
Pythagorean theorem. After finding the distances, use the distance formula 
d = rt, and solve for t, t

=
. The time it took for each part of the trip along a 
hypotenuse was the same, so the two distances divided by their respective
rates are equal to one another. Because Katie paddles more quickly than she
walks, let the rate at which she walks be r and the rate at which she paddles
be 2.5r.
First, writing the distance paddled, 72 + x2 = cp

Chapter 18: Plying Pythagoras

The quadratic equation can be factored, but the factors aren’t easy to come
by. Using the quadratic formula, while messy, is quicker in this case. You get
that x = 24 or x is a number greater than 52. The second number doesn’t
make any sense and is extraneous, because the total distance down the coast
is only 32 miles. Katie landed 24 miles down the coast.
The Problem: Shrimper Stanley is 10 miles from shore in his boat. The store
where he sells his daily catch of shrimp is 60 miles down the coast and x miles
inland. Stanley lands his boat 24 miles down the coast and bicycles directly
to the store. His boat moves at 13 miles per hour, and he bicycles at 15 miles
per hour. If the trip from his boat to the store takes a total of 5 hours, then
how far is it from the shore to the store? Figure 18-9 shows you the layout of
the distances and speeds.
First determine how far Stanley traveled in his boat. After you have the dis-
tance traveled in the boat, you determine how much time he spent in the boat
by dividing by 13 mph. Whatever time is left is what he spent bicycling, so you
can compute the distance bicycled and then the distance from the shore to
the store.
Completing the right triangle involving the boat, 102 + 242 = 100 + 576 = 676 =
262. The distance traveled in the boat is 26 miles. Dividing 26 by 13, you have
that Stanley traveled for 2 hours in his boat. The total trip was 5 hours, so he
spent 3 hours bicycling. The distance bicycling is equal to the rate of 15 mph
times the time, so Stanley bicycled 45 miles. The distance of 45 miles is the
hypotenuse of a right triangle. Solving for the distance from the shore to the
store, subtract 60 – 24 = 36 miles along the shore. Then 362 + x2 = 452. 1,296 +
x2 = 2,025, x2 = 729. The square root of 729 is 27, so x (the distance to the
store) is 27 miles.

Placing Things Fairly and Economically
When towns are separated by a number of miles but want to share things
like electrical transformers or new shopping centers, the placement of the
equipment or buildings has to take into account distances, convenience, and
economics.
The Problem: Town A is 33 miles from the main highway, and Town B is
16 miles from that same highway. The two towns are 119 miles apart. A devel-
oper wants to build a mall along that highway and connecting roads that go
directly from the mall to the two towns. Where should he place the mall so
that it’s the same distance from each town? Figure 18-10 shows you a layout
for the towns and mall, so you can see how the triangles work in the situation.
The two towns will be the same distance from the mall if the hypotenuse of
each right triangle is the same. Let the distance along the highway from the
point closest to Town A and the new mall be represented by x. Then the dis-
tance along the highway from the mall to the place closest to Town B is 119 – x.
Use the x and 119 – x to represent the distances along the highway. Then solve
for the diagonal distance in each triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. Set
the two hypotenuses equal to one another. Square both sides of the equation
to get rid of the radicals. Simplify and subtract the squared term from each
side. Solve the resulting linear equation for x.

Sometimes it’s more economical to have the direct or diagonal distances
from different towns to a centralized point be different from one another —
if it saves money by reducing the total distance of the two.
The Problem: A utility needs to place a transformer along an existing
power line that will serve two different customers. The two customers are
12 and 24 miles from the power line, and the customers are 42 miles apart.
The utility has three possible locations for the transformer: 9 miles from the
closest customer, 16 miles from the closest customer, or 35 miles from that
customer. Which location will provide a transformer that’s the shortest total
distance from the two customers? It’s hard to picture all this without a
sketch; Figure 18-11 shows you how this all sorts out.
Determine the sum of the lengths of the hypotenuses of the right triangles for
each placement of the transformer.
When it’s 9 miles from the closest customer, the first triangle has sides
9 and 12, and the second triangle has sides 33 and 24.
When it’s 16 miles from the closest customer, the first triangle has sides
16 and 12, and the second triangle has sides 26 and 24.
When it’s 35 miles from the closest customer, the first triangle has sides
35 and 12, and the second triangle has sides 7 and 24.

Placing the transformer on the highway 16 miles from the closest customer

Watching the Tide Drift Away
When a boat is tied to a dock, enough line (rope) has to be attached to account
for changes in the distance from the boat to the dock occurring due to the
tides. When the tide comes in, the boat sits higher and is closer to the dock.
When it goes out, the distance is greater. And the movement of the tide will
make the boat change positions.
The Problem: A boat is tied to a dock with a rope that’s 17 feet long. If the
height difference from where the rope is tied to the dock and where it’s tied
to the boat is 8 feet, then how far from the dock is the boat?
Let the height difference be vertical and the distance from the boat to the
dock be horizontal — giving you a right triangle whose hypotenuse is the
rope stretched from the dock to the boat. Figure 18-12 shows those vertical
and horizontal distances — and the rope as hypotenuse of the triangle.
Using the Pythagorean theorem, and letting the distance from the dock to
the boat be represented by a, you have 82 + a2 = 172. Simplifying, you get 
a2 = 289 – 64 = 225. So a = 15 feet.
When a boat moves away from a dock because of the movement of the water,
the rope that’s on a slant and attached to the boat pulls away at a different
rate of speed than the speed at which the boat and tide are moving.

17 feet
Figure 18-12:
The tide
is out.
263
Chapter 18: Plying Pythagoras

The Problem: The tide is moving out at a rate of 2 feet per second. The height
difference between where a rope is connected to the dock and the boat is
8 feet. How far out did the boat drift after 5 seconds, how long is the rope
extended, and how fast is the rope playing out? Do the same computations
for 10 seconds and 20 seconds.
Find the distance the boat has moved and use it to complete the right triangle.
The hypotenuse is the length of the rope. Divide the length of the rope by the
time elapsed to determine the average rate at which the rope is playing out.
After 5 seconds, at a rate of 2 feet per second, the boat has moved 10 feet.
Using the height of the dock as 8 feet and the distance from the dock as
10 feet, then 82 + 102 = 164 = c2. The value of c (length of the rope) is about
12.81 feet. Divide that by 5 seconds, and the rope is playing out (being
pulled out) at an average rate of about 2.56 feet per second.
Now do the same thing for 10 seconds. At 2 feet per second, the distance
is 20 feet. Completing the right triangle, 82 + 202 = 464 = c2. This time c is about
21.54 feet. Divide that by 10 seconds, and the rope is playing out at about
2.15 feet per second.
Finally, computing for 20 seconds, 82 + 402 = 1664 = c2. This time c is about
40.79 feet. Dividing by 20, the rope is playing out at about 2.04 feet per
second.
Did you notice that, as the length of the hypotenuse gets closer to the hori-
zontal length, the rates get closer, too?

reas and perimeters of polygons (geometric figures with segments for
sides) and circles have many practical applications. You need the
perimeter of your yard before you order new fencing. You want the total area
of your living room before purchasing carpeting. You need to know the area of
a walkway around your circular pool when you’re choosing between cement
or gravel. The challenges to doing problems involving perimeter and area are
in determining what type of figure you have and then in finding and applying
the correct formula.
Keeping the Cows in the Pasture
Cows and sheep are standard fare when it comes to problems involving fenc-
ing in a pasture. You may have a set amount of fencing available, or you may
need a particular minimum area for your herd. The pasture doesn’t have to be
rectangular, but rectangles are nice figures to work with in these problems.
Working with a set amount of fencing
You have several rolls of fencing and you need to create a rectangular area
for your herd of cattle. How can you best make use of the fencing? In this
case, the better or best use is when you can create the largest possible area.

In Figure 19-1, you see how 60 feet of fencing is used to create several differ-
ent rectangular regions, each with a different area.
The areas of the figures created by the same 60 feet of fencing are 200 square
units, 125 square units, 29 square units, and 225 square units. The way a cer-
tain amount of fencing is used makes a huge difference in the area.
The Problem: You have 680 feet of fencing and want to create a rectangular
pasture whose length is 10 feet more than twice its width. What dimensions
do you make your pasture?
The perimeter of a rectangular figure is determined with the formula P = 2l + 2w
where l and w represent the length and width of the rectangle. If your length is
to be 10 more than twice the width, then let w represent the width and 10 + 2w
represent the length. Replace the perimeter, P, with 680 and solve the equation
for w.

The width of the pasture is 110 feet. Replacing the w with 110 in 10 + 2w, you
get that the length is 10 + 2(110) = 10 + 220 = 230 feet. Checking the perimeter,
you get that P = 2(230) + 2(110) = 460 + 220 = 680 feet.

Part IV: Taking the Shape of Geometric Word Problems 

Having a nice, rectangular pasture or yard is fine and dandy, but what if you
need to keep the little boy sheep separated from the little girl sheep — or
some other such arrangement?
The Problem: You have 1,200 yards of fencing and want to create a rectangular
pasture that has two dividing fences running down the middle. If the width is to
be 30 feet less than the length, then what is the area of the pasture?
Figure 19-2 shows you the layout of the fencing. Let the length be represented
by x and the width be represented by x – 30. Solve for the length; then deter-
mine the width. And, finally, compute the area by multiplying the length times
the width.
The total perimeter plus the dividers is equal to 1,200 yards. So you add up
all the fencing to get 1,200 = x + x + x – 30 + x – 30 + x – 30 + x – 30 = 6x – 120.
The equation is now 1,200 = 6x – 120. Solving for x by adding 120 to each side,
6x = 1,320. Now, dividing each side by 6, you get that x = 220. The length
is 220 yards. The width is 30 yards less than that or 190 yards. The area is 
220 × 190 = 41,800 square yards.
Aiming for a needed area
You’re told that llamas need a certain amount of grazing area in order to
thrive. Armed with the area constraints, you can go about figuring out how
to create the needed room for a hungry llama.
The Problem: You need to create a rectangular area encompassing 6,400
square feet, in which the length is 40 feet less than three times the width.
One side of the rectangular area will be along a river, so you don’t need to
put a fence there. What is the least amount of fencing needed to partition off
that rectangular area?

Chapter 19: Going around in Circles with Perimeter and Area

The two different scenarios are:
 Have the length of the area be along the river.
 Let the width be along the river.
Look at Figure 19-3 for the two different layouts. The w represents the width,
and the 3w – 40 represents the length.
In both cases, the area is length times width or (3w – 40)w. So solve the equa-
tion A = lw, replacing the A with 6,400.

The two solutions of the quadratic equation are 531⁄3 and –40. The negative
solution makes no sense, of course. Letting the width be 531⁄3, then the length,
which is 40 less than three times that is 120 feet. The dimensions of the area
needed are 531⁄3 by 120.
Now determine which layout will use the least amount of fencing. If you let
the width be along the river, then you need two lengths and one width of
the fencing or 2931⁄3 feet. If you let the length run along the river, then you
need one length and two widths or 2262⁄3 feet — the better choice for econ-
omy’s sake.

Part IV: Taking the Shape of Geometric Word Problems 

Getting the Most Out of Your Resources
You can’t always create a rectangular yard or area, but the rectangular shape
does seem to be the most popular with most builders and their projects. If
you could use any shape you wanted, you could do a lot better with your
resources because you could economize on fencing and maximize the area
enclosed.
Triangulating the area
A triangular area requires just three sides of fencing. The area of a triangle is
found using one of two formulas, depending on whether you have a perpendic-
ular measure from one of the sides to the opposite vertex or just the measures
of the sides.
The area of the triangle shown in Figure 19-4 is computed:

(This is called Heron’s formula.)
The Problem: You have 72 feet of fencing and need to enclose an area that’s
triangular. Which triangle will give you more area: a right triangle that has
sides measuring 18, 24, and 30 feet, or an equilateral triangle that’s 24 feet on
each side?

square feet. To find the area of the

square feet. So the equilateral triangle has the greater area,
even though the perimeter of each triangle is the same.
Squaring off with area
In the “Working with a set amount of fencing” section, earlier in this chapter,
you see how the same amount of fencing creates several different areas. What
size rectangle creates the greatest area? Does the shape of the rectangle or
proportion of the lengths of the sides of a rectangle depend on the perimeter?
Or is there some optimum shape?
The Problem: A rectangle is to have a perimeter of 36 feet and the greatest
area possible. What are the dimensions of the rectangle that has the greatest
area?
Let the width of the rectangle be 1 foot, 2 feet, 3 feet, and so on. For each
width, determine the length of the rectangle by subtracting the width from 18.
You subtract from 18 because the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w).
When the perimeter is 36 feet, you get 36 = 2(l + w). Dividing each side of the
equation by 2, 18 = l + w, and l = 18 – w. When you get the width and length,
compute the area of the resulting rectangle. Table 19-1 lays it all out.

You see that the area values start decreasing when you pass the point where
the rectangle is a square. A rectangle that’s actually a square has the greatest
possible area for a given perimeter. This statement is most easily proved
using calculus. For now, the demonstration with the table should suffice.
Taking the hex out with a hexagon
A hexagon is a six-sided polygon. A regular hexagon is special, because all the
sides are the same measure, and all the interior angles are 120 degrees. An
even more special feature of the regular hexagon is the fact that it’s made up
of six equilateral triangles, all nestled together. In Figure 19-5, you find two
hexagons, one made up of a rectangle topped by a trapezoid, and the other a
regular hexagon. You get to find out which has the greater area for a set
amount of perimeter.
The Problem: Each of the hexagons shown in Figure 19-5 has a perimeter of
36 inches. Which has the greater area?
The house-shaped hexagon on the left is a rectangle topped by a trapezoid.
Add the two areas together to get the total area. The area of the rectangle is

Multiply that area by 6 to get 93.54 square inches. The regular hexagon has
the greater area.
Coming full circle with area
Each of the problems in this section deals with making the most of perimeter
to get the biggest possible area. A common theme that you find is that a regular
polygon has the greatest area of any other polygon of its type. Also, the more
sides you add to a regular polygon, the more the polygon seems to resemble a
circle. In this section, you compare the area of a hexagon that has a perimeter
of 36 inches with the area of a circle that has a circumference of 36 inches.
The Problem: Which has the greater area: a regular hexagon with a perimeter
of 36 inches or a circle with a circumference of 36 inches?
First, refer to the problem in the preceding section, “Taking the hex out with
a hexagon,” and you find that a regular hexagon with a perimeter of 36 inches
has an area of about 93.54 square inches. To find the area of a circle that has
a circumference of 36 inches, you need to find the radius of the circle, first.
The circumference of a circle is found with: C = 2πr, where r is the radius. The
area of a circle is found with: A = πr2, where r is the radius.
If the circumference of a particular circle is 36 inches, then 2πr = 36. Dividing
each side of the equation by 2π, you get that r is about 5.73 inches. Use 5.73
as the radius in the formula for the area of the circle, and you get that the
area is about 103.15 square inches. The area of the circle is almost 10 square
inches larger than that of the hexagon. The area of a circle will always be
greater than a polygon with the same perimeter.
Putting in a Walk-Around
You’ve finally hit the big time and decide you can afford to put in a pool and
party area in the backyard. A pool has water in it — well, let’s hope so. With
water comes mud and a mess, so you need to put a nice cement walk around
the perimeter of the pool.
272
Part IV: Taking the Shape of Geometric Word Problems 

Determining the area around the outside
When you have an existing pool or other area that needs to be surrounded,
then you take measurements of the structure in the middle and determine what
you want around the outside — how wide and how deep.
The Problem: You have a rectangular pool that’s 40 feet long and 30 feet
wide. You want to put in a cement walkway that’s 6 feet wide on all four sides,
and the corners will be 6-foot squares. How many square feet of cement will
you need? (Refer to Figure 19-6 which shows both the square corners for this
problem and rounded corners for the next problem.)
To figure the total area of the cement walkway, divide the walkway into four
rectangles. Include the square corners in rectangles that go across the top
and bottom. The rectangles across the top and bottom now have dimensions
42 feet by 6 feet (the 42 comes from 30 + 6 + 6 for the two ends). Multiplying
42 × 6, you get 252 square feet for each of the two sections. The side sections
are 40 feet by 6 feet, so each of their areas are 40 × 6 = 240 square feet. Double
each section type and add the areas together: 2(252) + 2(240) = 504 + 480 =
984 square feet.
But what if you want curved corners? It may be that you want to make mowing
easier by making the corners curves. Or, perhaps, you think that the curved
corners are more aesthetically pleasing. Also, there’s always the chance that
you’re just very frugal and want to save some money.
The Problem: You want a 6-foot cement walkway around the outside of your
40 foot by 30 foot rectangular pool. The walkway is to be 6-feet wide at the
corners, too, so they’ll be pieces of circles with a radius of 6 feet. How many
square feet, total, will your walkway contain? (Refer to Figure 19-6 to see what
this type walkway would look like.)

The four corners of the walkway are each one-fourth of the same 6-foot-
radius circle. Just find the area of a circle with a radius of 6 feet, and add it
onto the four rectangular sections. The four rectangular sections have dimen-
sions matching the sides of the pool. Two sections are 40 × 6, and the other
two are 30 × 6.
The total area of the walkway is the area of the circle plus twice the area of
each rectangular section.

Adding up for the entire area
You’re contemplating putting in a circular above-ground swimming pool, but
you’re not sure whether you have enough room. There’s not only the pool
itself, but also the 3-foot-wide deck to consider.
The Problem: Your backyard is 120 feet long and 40 feet wide. The neighbor-
hood ordnance dictates that a pool and its surround can’t take up more than
25 percent of your yard. How big a pool can you get if you’re going to put a 
3-foot-wide deck around a circular pool? (Figure 19-7 shows you a possible
scenario for the pool and the yard.)
First, determine the total square footage allowed by the ordnance. Then try
to maximize the size of the pool. Your main constraint will be the width of
the yard — you may have to settle for a smaller pool than allowed or go for
another shape. Your total square footage is 120 × 40 = 4,800 square feet.

Twenty-five percent of 4,800 square feet is 1,200 square feet. To get the
biggest pool possible, you want the area of the pool plus the deck to be
1,200 square feet (25 percent). Let the radius of your pool be represented
by r. Add a 3-foot deck, and the total radius is r + 3. Now use the area formula
to solve for r.

Creating a Poster
You see posters all over the place announcing events. Garage sale signs crop
up every spring, and fundraising dinners are plastered all over the place before
the big night. Creating an eye-catching yet economical poster is an art — which
is why some people take courses to learn how to do it effectively. Color is
important, but so is the use of white space. The problems in this section
assume that you have a certain portion of the poster dedicated to the print
and pictures and the rest of it is a plain, white border.

Avoiding wet feet
You have a fish pond on your property that’s a
perfect circle with a diameter of 100 feet. In the
exact center of your fish pond, there’s a flag-
pole. You want to tie a rope to that flagpole, but
your rope is only 101 feet long, and you don’t
have a boat, a raft, or even waders. You’re a
clever sort, though, and you figure out how to
tie the rope to the flagpole without getting your
feet wet. How do you do it?
Answer: You first find a peg or small stick and push it into the ground at the
edge of the pond. Tie your rope to the peg. Now, holding the other end of the
rope, walk all the way around the pond and back to the peg. Make a loop in
the end of your rope, and push the end that was tied to the peg through the
loop. Pull on the end of the rope until it tightens around the flag pole.

Starting with a certain amount of print
You’re in charge of printing up campaign posters for your favorite candidate.
The person running for office has a lot to say and wants to devote 120 square
inches of the poster to information about her position on the issues. You get
to create the most economical size poster (use the least amount of print).
The Problem: What are the dimensions of the poster that uses the least
amount of material if you have to include 120 square inches of print, 2-inch
borders on the sides, and 3-inch borders on the top and bottom? (To make it
more reasonable to solve, the measures all have to be whole numbers.)
Determine the different dimensions that rectangular areas of printed material
can be in to get 120 square inches. Then determine the amount of border
material that has to be added to each rectangle.
Figure 19-8 shows two possibilities for shapes of the resulting poster. Each
poster has printed material in the middle taking up a total of 120 square
inches. After you determine a height and width that gives you an area of
120 square inches, add 6 inches to the height (3 on the top and 3 on the
bottom) and 4 inches to the width (2 and 2). Compute the new total area by
multiplying the two new dimensions together. Look at Table 19-2 for the pos-
sibilities. (I haven’t included choices like 120 by 1 or 60 by 2 because they’re
impractical.)

Two different sizes yield the least amount of material: either a poster that’s

more aesthetically pleasing to the eye and would be the choice.

Climbing the ladder
Pete the painter is on a ladder leaning up against
the wall that he’s working on at the time. He
starts on the middle rung of the ladder, goes up
four rungs, down nine rungs, up three rungs and
then up ten more rungs to reach the top bar of
the ladder. How many rungs are on this ladder?
Answer: There are 17 rungs on the ladder. Think of the middle rung as being
0 on a number line or thermometer. Going up four takes you to +4. Down nine
from there takes you to –5. Up three brings you to –2, and up ten more brings
you to +8. That’s the top of the ladder. Take 2 × 8 and add 1 for the middle,
giving you 16 + 1 = 17 rungs.

Working with a particular poster size
You’re to create a poster with a certain number of square inches. The white
border around the printed material is to be 2 inches on each side and 3 inches
across the top and bottom. Now you have to determine the amount of material
left for pictures and words.
The Problem: You are to create a poster with a total area of 300 square
inches. In the center of the poster you’ll put the printed material in a rectan-
gular box with 2-inch borders on either side. You’ll also put 3-inch borders
on the top and bottom. The material in the borders is included in the total
area of 300 square inches. If the width of the poster is to be 3⁄4 the length,
then what are the dimensions of the rectangular area containing the printed
material? (Refer to Figure 19-9 to help you picture the situation.)
Let the dimensions of the print in the poster be l × w. Adding in the white bor-
ders, the dimensions of the overall poster are (l + 6) by (w + 4). The width of
the poster is to be 3⁄4 the length, so replace the (w + 4) with 3⁄4 (l + 6). If the
poster is to have an area of 300 square inches, then multiply the length times
the width and set it equal to 300.

So the inside length of the poster (for the written part) is to be 14 inches.
Add 6 to get the outside length of 20 inches. The width is to be 3⁄4 of the
length, which makes it 15 inches. The inside width (for the printed material)
is 15 inches less the border of 4 inches or 11 inches. To recap: The whole
poster is to be 20 by 15 inches, giving you 300 square inches. The inside rec-
tangle is 14 by 11 inches, giving you 154 square inches to put all the print and
pictures.
Shedding the Light on a Norman Window
Houses have windows to let in the light and fresh air. The most common
shape for a window is a rectangle, but you also see round windows and
hexagonal windows and other creative shapes. A Norman window is made up
of two geometric shapes: a semicircle on top of a rectangle. One side of the
rectangle is the same measure as the semicircle’s diameter. Figure 19-10
shows two Norman windows.
Maximizing the amount of light
A window lets in light and fresh air. Adding a semicircle to the top of a rectan-
gular window not only lets in more light, but adds a decorative touch.
The Problem: You’re planning on putting in a Norman window in a room
on the north side of your home. You want as much light as possible to be let
in through the window. The rectangular part of the window is to be 6 feet by
4 feet, and the semicircle will sit on top. Which will let in more light: if the rec-
tangular base is 4 feet and the sides 6 feet, or if the rectangular base is 6 feet
with 4 foot sides? (Refer to Figure 19-10 for approximate figures.)

The curve is

Chapter 19: Going around in Circles with Perimeter and Area

Find the total area of each window. The rectangular part of each window is
24 square feet, so the main interest is in the respective areas of the semi-
circles on top. The window with a 4-foot base has a semicircle on top with a
diameter of 4 feet — or a radius of 2 feet. The area of a circle is found with 
A = πr2. The semicircle has half the area of the full circle, so the area of this 
semicircle is

square feet. Clearly, the wider window will let in more

The areas of the two Norman windows in the preceding problem are different
by almost 8 square feet — a fairly large difference. You may be surprised to
know that the perimeters of these two windows aren’t nearly so different.
The Problem: Which has the greater perimeter: a Norman window with a 
4-by-6-foot base or a Norman window with a 6-by-4-foot base?
The perimeter of a Norman window consists of the three sides of the rectan-
gle and the circumference of the semicircle. The circumference of a full circle
is found by multiplying the diameter by π. Because you only want half that
area, you multiply half the diameter (the radius) by π. The Norman window
with the base of 4 feet and sides of 6 feet has a semicircle with radius 2 feet,
so the total perimeter is 4 + 6 + 6 + 2π = 16 + 2π ≈22.28 feet. The Norman
window with the base of 6 feet and sides of 4 feet has a semicircle with radius
3 feet, so the total perimeter is 6 + 4 + 4 + 3π = 14 + 3π ≈23.42 feet. The
perimeters of these two windows differ by just a little over 1 foot.
Making the window proportional
What if you want the area of the rectangular part of a Norman window to
be equal to the area of the semicircular part? This arrangement just may be
more esthetically pleasing to you.
The Problem: How long should the base of a Norman window be if the two
sides of the rectangle are 2 feet high and the area of the rectangle is to be
equal to the area of the semicircle?
First, let the length of the base be represented by x. Because the area of a rec-
tangle is length times width, the area of the rectangle is 2x. You want the area
of the semicircle also to be equal to 2x. The area of the semicircle is found by
taking half the area of a circle whose radius is half the base of the rectangle, 
so the radius is x

Fitting a Rectangular Peg 
into a Round Hole
An old adage says that you can’t fit a square peg into a round hole. (Or is it a
round peg in a square hole?) Mathematicians must have found this statement
to be a challenge. No, they still couldn’t fit the peg into the hole, but the
statement opened up all sorts of questions and answers as to how large a
round peg could fit into a square hole or how large a rectangular peg could
fit into a semicircular hole. Oh, the possibilities!
Putting rectangles into circles
A rectangle has a set length and width and doesn’t fit very neatly into a
circle. See Figure 19-11 for some examples of rectangles working their ways
into circles.
Figure 19-11:
The circle

281
Chapter 19: Going around in Circles with Perimeter and Area

Just how large a rectangle will fit into a circle, if you have some particular
constraints?
The Problem: You want to fit a rectangle with length 8 inches into a circle
with radius 5 inches. What width will the rectangle have if each of the ver-
tices of the rectangle are to be on the circle?
Take advantage of the symmetry of a rectangle, the radius of the circle, and
good old Pythagoras. First, a rectangle’s “center” is where the two diagonals
(from opposite corners) intersect. The center of the rectangle is also where the
center of the circle is. The radius of this circle is 5 inches, so that’s the distance
from the center of the rectangle to any of its vertices, because the vertices are
on the circle. The length of the rectangle is 8 inches, so a segment drawn from
the center of the rectangle horizontally to one of the sides is half that, or
4 inches. Refer to the left circle in Figure 19-11 and you’ll see the radius and
segment drawn in. The horizontal segment is perpendicular to the side of the
rectangle — using the symmetry and angle measures of a rectangle — so the
triangle formed is a right triangle. Solving for the length of the third side of
the right triangle (I’ll call the length b) using the Pythagorean theorem, you
get that 42 + b2 = 52 or b2 = 25 – 16 = 9. The length of the third side of the triangle
is 3 inches, so the length of the entire side of the rectangle is 6 inches. You can
fit an 8-by-6-inch rectangle into a circle whose radius is 5 inches.
A rectangle measuring 8 by 6 inches has an area of 48 square inches. A rec-
tangle with these dimensions is not the largest rectangle that you can fit into
a circle with a radius of 5 inches. In calculus, you prove that the largest rec-
tangle that fits into a circle is really a square. So, if that’s the case, what size
square fits into a particular circle?
The Problem: What is the length of any side of a square that fits into a circle
whose radius is 5 inches?
Use the diagonal of the square and the Pythagorean theorem to solve this
problem. The diagonal of the square is the same as the diameter of the circle.
A circle with a 5-inch radius has a 10-inch diameter. Let the lengths of the
sides of the square be x inches long. Because the angles of a square are all
right angles, you have a right triangle whose hypotenuse is 10 inches long
and whose sides are each x units long. Filling in values in the Pythagorean
theorem and solving for x,

So a square with sides measuring about 7.07 inches is the largest that will fit
into the circle. The area of this square is about 49.98 square inches — larger
than the rectangle measuring 8 by 6 inches.
Working with coordinate axes
Circles, rectangles, and squares are easily described using the coordinate
axes and some points and equations. The distance formula for the coordinate
plane allows you to solve for lengths of segments if you have the values of
the coordinates at either end.
Using coordinate axes,
 The equation of a circle with its center at the origin is x2 + y2 = r2, where r
is the radius of the circle.
 The distance between the two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is found with the

In Figure 19-12, you see a triangle drawn inside a semicircle. Even though a
semicircle is only half a full circle, the equation for the circle is used when
solving problems involving one of its semicircles.
The Problem: A rectangle is inscribed inside a semicircle (its vertices are all
on some part of the semicircle). If the semicircle has its center at the origin
and a radius of 5 units, then what are the coordinates of the vertices (x,y) in
the first quadrant if the length of the rectangle is four times its height?

Chapter 19: Going around in Circles with Perimeter and Area

The y coordinate of the vertex you want also represents the height of the rec-
tangle. The x coordinate is actually half the length, because the x is just the
distance from the origin to the right. So the length of the rectangle is repre-
sented by 2x. Writing that the length is four times the height, the equation is 
2x = 4y, which simplifies to x = 2y.
The equation of a circle with its center at the origin and with a radius of 5 is
x2 + y2 = 25. Replacing the x in this equation with 2y and solving for y,

Any triangle that has two of its vertices at the endpoints of a diameter and
the third vertex on the circle is a right triangle. You don’t prove this fact here,
but the next problem allows you to see, from the coordinates of the points,
that the rule holds.
The Problem: A triangle has one side along the flat part of a semicircle, with
the endpoints of that side of the triangle at the endpoints of that diameter
(refer to Figure 19-12). The radius of the semicircle is 10 units. What are the
coordinates of the vertex of the triangle if it lies on the circle, and the distance
from that vertex to the left endpoint is 2 10?
You see that the endpoints of the diameter lie along the x-axis. If the radius
of the semicircle is 10 units, then the coordinates of the endpoints of the 
diameter are (–10,0) and (10,0). The left endpoint is at (–10,0). Use the dis-
tance formula, and set that distance equal to the value you get by substituting
in the points (x, y) and (–10,0) into the formula.

The x-coordinate is –8. Substituting back into the equation for the circle, you
get that y2 = 100 – (–8)2 = 100 – 64 = 36. Taking the square root of each side,
you get that y is either +6 or –6. The point you’re looking for is above the 
x-axis, so you want the +6. The coordinates of the vertex are (–8,6).
Back to the fact that you have a right triangle here, you can show that it’s true
by using the Pythagorean theorem on the lengths of the sides of the triangle.
The side along the x-axis is 20 units long. The side that goes from the point
(–8,6) to (–10,0) is 40 units long. (You can check me by using the distance
formula.) And the side that goes from the point (–8,6) to (10,0) is 360 units
long. Plugging these values into the Pythagorean theorem,

hree-dimensional figures are a part of our life, so they are measured,
weighed, and stacked. A prism is a solid figure with a top and bottom that
are exactly the same. Pyramids and cones come to a single point or vertex.
In this chapter, you see how problems are posed and answered by considering
the various solid figures and their properties. The surface area of a solid figure
is a measure of the number of squares covering the outside, and the volume
of a solid figure is a measure of the number of cubes you can fit inside. The
respective formulas for surface area and volume are a big help, but just as
important is some common sense and being able to picture the situation and
the solid figure being used.
The Pictures Speak Volumes
The volume of a prism is found by multiplying the area of the base of the
prism by its height. The top and bottom or two bases of a prism are always
congruent (exactly the same). The sides are always rectangles. The prisms
being considered in this chapter are technically right rectangular prisms,
meaning that the sides are perpendicular to the bases — the sides don’t slant
like the Leaning Tower of Pisa — and the bases are parallel to one another.

Boxing up rectangular prisms
A rectangular prism has rectangles for its bases as well as its sides. Because
all the surfaces of a rectangular prism are rectangles, you can actually turn it
so that any pair of parallel sides are the bases. Pick your favorites.
The volume of a right rectangular prism is equal to the area of the base
times the height. Because the base is also a rectangle, the volume formula is
more conveniently written V = lwh, where l is the length of the base rectangle,
w is the width of the base rectangle, and h is the height or the distance
between the two bases.
The Problem: What is the height of a rectangular prism that has a square
base 6 inches on a side and a volume of 288 cubic inches?
Use the formula for the volume of a prism replacing the V with the 288 cubic
inches, the l with 6, and the w with 6. Then solve for h.

The height is 8 inches.
The Problem: A rectangular prism has a length that’s twice the width and a
height that’s twice the length. If its volume is eight times the height, then
what is the volume?
You use the formula for the volume, even though you don’t really have a
numerical value to put in for V. The length, height, and volume can all be
expressed in terms of the width. First, if the length is twice the width you write
that l = 2w. Because the height is twice the length, you write h = 2l = 2(2w) = 4w.
And the volume is eight times the height, so V = 8h = 8(4w) = 32w.
Now, using the formula for the volume, V = lwh, filling in the equivalences and
solving for w,

The solutions for w in the equation are 0, 2, and –2. You discard the 0 and –2,
because, even though they’re solutions of the equation, they don’t answer
the question. Letting w = 2, you get that the volume is 32(2) = 64 cubic units.
The width of the prism is 2 units, the length is twice that or 4 units, and the
height is 4 times the width, or 8 units.
Venturing out with pyramids
A pyramid is a solid figure that has a polygon (a figure with segments for its
sides) for a base and sides that are triangles — all meeting in one point called
the vertex.
The volume of a pyramid is found by multiplying the area of the base of the
pyramid by its height and taking one-third of that product. The height of
a pyramid is the perpendicular distance from the center of the base up to
the vertex. Figure 20-1 shows a square pyramid and a hexagonal pyramid.
Traditionally, the name of the pyramid is determined by the shape of the base.
The Problem: The volume of a pyramid with a square base is 216 cubic inches.
If the sides of the square base are 9 inches, then what is the pyramid’s height?
Use the formula for the volume of a pyramid, V

and replace the V with 
216. The area of the base, B, is the area of a square. The area of a square is
found by squaring the length of a side. If the sides of the square base are
9 inches, then the area of the base is 81 square inches. Replace the B in the
formula with 81 and solve for h.

The Problem: A hexagonal-based pyramid has sides (of the base) measuring
8 inches. The length along any edge of the pyramid from a base corner to the
vertex is 10 inches. What is the pyramid’s volume?
You need to find the pyramid’s height. Think of the height of the pyramid as
being one side of a right triangle whose hypotenuse is the 10-inch edge. (See
Figure 20-2 for a sketch of the pyramid and embedded right triangle.)
The hexagonal base is made up of equilateral triangles whose sides are all
8 inches, so the distance from the outer corner to the center of the hexagon
is 8 inches. You have a right triangle whose hypotenuse is 10 inches with one
leg of 8 inches. Using the Pythagorean theorem, you get that the measure of
the other leg is 6 inches. That other leg is the height of the pyramid.
Now, armed with the height of the pyramid, 6 inches, you need to find the
area of the base. Each of the six equilateral triangles making up the hexagonal
base has sides of 8 inches. Use Heron’s formula to find the area of one of the
triangles and multiply that area by 6. (If you need a refresher on using
Heron’s formula to find the area of a triangle, refer to Chapter 10.)

Dropping eaves with trapezoidal prisms
A trapezoid is a four-sided polygon with one side parallel to another side.
A container with slanted sides so that the top or opening is larger than the
bottom might have a trapezoidal cross-section. In Figure 20-3, you see a
trapezoidal prism with the two parallel sides on the top and bottom. (Refer
to Chapter 10 if you need a refresher on trapezoids and finding their area.)
The volume of a trapezoidal prism is equal to the area of its base times
its height, V = Bh. Replacing the B, for the area of the base, with the
formula for the area of a trapezoid, the formula for volume becomes

. The subscripts t and p on the height measures are there to 
differentiate between the height of the trapezoid (the distance between the
two parallel bases) and the height of the prism (the distance between the two
trapezoidal bases.
The Problem: A watering trough for cattle is a trapezoidal prism. The trapezoid
has a bottom base of 2 feet and an opening, at the top, of 3 feet. The trough is
2 feet deep. If the trough contains 60 cubic feet of water, how long is it?

Fire-breathing dragon
A man is trapped in a cell that has only two pos-
sible exits. Through one of the exits, he’d have to
pass through a room constructed from a magni-
fying glass; the blazing sun would instantly fry
anyone trying to pass through it. The other exit
opens onto a fire-breathing dragon. How can the
man escape?
Answer: He just has to wait until nighttime and go through the first door with
the magnifying glass.

You’re looking for the height of the prism — the distance between the two
trapezoidal bases on either end of the trough. Find the area of the trapezoidal
base (end) and insert it into the formula for the volume. Replace the V in the
formula with 60 and solve for the height of the prism.
The area of the trapezoid is A

square feet. Replacing 
the V and B in the volume formula with 60 and 5, respectively, you get that
60 = 5h. Dividing each side of the equation by 5, your answer is that the
height of the prism (in this case, the length of the trough) is 12 feet.
Most homes have rain gutters attached at the edge of the roof to catch water
coming down the roof surface; the water is then directed to a downspout.
The gutters are often trapezoidal prisms where one side of the trapezoid is
perpendicular to the two parallel sides so that it forms a flat attachment to
the side of the house.
The Problem: An aluminum gutter in the shape of a trapezoidal prism is to
go across the 32-foot front portion of a house. If the two parallel sides of the
trapezoid are 6 inches and 9 inches, then how deep must the trapezoid be
so that the gutter can hold 10 cubic feet of water?
The first chore is to change all the units so they’re the same — right now
they’re in inches and feet. You could change everything to inches, but a cubic
foot is 12 × 12 × 12 cubic inches, and that makes the numbers a bit big to
work with. Instead, you can change the 6 and 9 inches to feet and work with
relatively nice fractions. The area of the trapezoidal end of the gutter is

m where the inches are changed to fractions

the depth of the gutter, which is the height of the trapezoid in this case. Now
use the formula for the volume of the prism, replacing the V with 10, the area
of the base, B, with the result of the area of the trapezoid, and the height of
the prism, h, with 32 feet. Then solve for h.

Mailing triangular prisms
You want to mail an umbrella to a friend. An umbrella is long and has a
handle. You don’t want to use a flat, rectangular prism, because the long
package may get bent and damage the umbrella. A long tube or cylinder may
work, but an even better idea is to use a triangular prism that has strength
from the three sides and flatness to help pack up the umbrella and keep
it from flopping about inside.
The surface area of a triangular prism is equal to the sum of the areas of the
two bases (the triangles) plus the area of each of the three rectangular sides.
Figure 20-4 shows you a triangular prism and, also, what the ends look like if
they’re extended for tabs so they can be glued to the sides of the prism.
The Problem: You want to mail an umbrella that’s 3 feet long with a handle
that’s 5 inches wide. You choose a mailing container that’s a triangular prism
made of cardboard. The ends of the prism are equilateral triangles 6 inches
on a side, and the length (height) of the prism is 2 inches longer than the
umbrella. How much cardboard is needed for the container, if the sides of
the triangles are extended by 1 inch for glue tabs?
Break this problem into three different area computations: the areas of the
sides of the prisms, the areas of the two triangles that make up the bases,
and then the areas of the glue tabs.
Each of the sides of the prism is a rectangle that’s 3 feet, 2 inches long and
6 inches wide. The prism has three sides. Changing the length measure to
inches, the three rectangles are 38 inches by 6 inches or 228 square inches
in area. Three of them makes 3(228) = 684 square inches.

The six tabs are each 6 inches by 1 inch or 6 square inches. The six tabs add
a total of 36 square inches to the area. So the total area of the entire triangu-
lar prism is 684 + 31 + 36 = 751 square inches.
Folding Up the Sides for an Open Box
A classic calculus problem involves taking a rectangular piece of paper or card-
board or metal, cutting equal squares from the four corners, and folding up the
sides to construct an open box. Figure 20-5 shows you how this is done.
The Problem: A 9-by-12-inch piece of cardboard is to be made into an open
box by cutting slits into square-shaped corners, folding up the sides, and
gluing the tabs to the ends. What is the volume of the open box if the corner
squares are 2 inches on a side?
The volume of the right rectangular prism that’s formed is found with the for-
mula V = lwh. The height, h, of the prism is 2 inches — the size of the squares
at the corners. The length of the prism is 12 inches minus the two squares
in the corners; 12 – 4 = 8 inches for the length. The width of the prism is
Figure 20-5:
Fold up the
sides and
glue the
edges
together.
294
Part IV: Taking the Shape of Geometric Word Problems 

9 inches minus the two corners or 9 – 4 = 5 inches. The volume of the prism
is V = 8(5)(2) = 80 cubic inches.
In the calculus problem involving the open box, you get to determine the
size of squares in the corners that gives you the largest possible volume. If
the squares are small, then the box isn’t very deep, but the area of the base
is big. If the squares are large, then the box is deep, but the area of the base is
small. Calculus allows you to balance the depth and the base area to find the
best dimensions. In the next problem, you get to do somewhat the same
process with a table of the possible values.
The Problem: A sandbox is to be formed from a 9 foot square piece of metal
by cutting equal squares from the corners and folding up the sides. The
edges are then welded together to form the box. What size squares should be
cut from the corners to form a box that will hold the greatest amount of sand
possible (have the greatest volume)?
First, determine the dimensions of the box in terms of the length in feet of the
sides of the squares, x. The height is, of course, x. The length and width are
both 9 minus the two squares (one on either end) or 9 – 2x feet. The volume
of the sandbox is V = lwh = (9 – 2x)(9 – 2x)x. In Table 20-1, you see measures
for x in half-foot increments and the resulting volumes.
Table 20-1
The Volumes of Sandboxes
x (Height 
9–2x (Length and 
(9–2x)(9–2x)x = V

8(8)(0.5) = 32 cubic feet

7 feet
7(7)(1) = 49 cubic feet
1.5 feet
6 feet
6(6)(1.5) = 54 cubic feet
2 feet
5 feet
5(5)(2) = 50 cubic feet
2.5 feet
4 feet
4(4)(2.5) = 40 cubic feet
As you see, after 1.5 feet for the height, the volume is decreasing as the
squares get bigger. In half-foot increments, the greatest possible volume is
obtained when the sandbox is 1.5 feet deep and 6 feet on a side. Using calcu-
lus to solve this problem and find the greatest volume you get the same
answer. (Of course, I picked a very convenient size box to demonstrate this.)
295
Chapter 20: Volumizing and Improving Your Surface

Following Postal Regulations
Postal services have regulations regarding the weight and size and contents
of packages that you take to be mailed. You may remember taking a package
in and watching the clerk wrap a chain around the middle of the box and then
holding the remainder of the chain along the height. Regulations dictate
that the height plus the girth of the box can’t exceed 108 inches. The girth
is that measure around the two shorter dimensions.
The height plus the girth of a rectangular prism is equal to h + 2l + 2w.
Refer to Figure 20-6 for a picture of how the height and girth are measured.
Finding the right size
With the limitations on the total of the height plus the girth, you have to be
careful what size package you prepare to send. Everything has to fit into a
carton that passes muster. It takes a balance between a package being wide
enough and long enough but not too much of either.
The Problem: How tall a box will the postal service accept if it has a base
that’s 16 inches by 18 inches and if the height plus the girth can’t exceed
108 inches?
The measures of 16 and 18 inches represent the width and length of the base.
Put these measures into the formula h + 2l + 2w and set the expression equal
to 108. Then solve for h.

Part IV: Taking the Shape of Geometric Word Problems 

If you’re sending something that will fit into any size box and are restricted
only by the total volume, then you have more flexibility with the postal rules.
For example, if you’re sending Ping-Pong balls or nails, the shape of the box
doesn’t matter very much.
The Problem: You have to send wrapped candies that take up 1,000 cubic
inches of space. Because of the weight of the candy, the rule is that the
height plus the girth can’t exceed 50 inches. If the base of the box is a square,
then what are the dimensions of the carton you’ll be using?
Write two equations: one about the volume and the other about the height
and girth. Find the common solution or solutions to the system of equations.
The volume of this box is found with V = wwh, because the base is a square.
Replacing the V with 1,000, the equation becomes 1,000 = w2h. Write the equa-
tion involving the height and girth with 50 = h + 2w + 2w or 50 = h + 4w. Solve
the second equation for h, and you get h = 50 – 4w. Substitute this equivalence
for h into the volume formula and solve.

Discard the negative number and just consider the solution that w = 6.4. It
appears that two different sets of dimensions satisfy the requirements that
the box contain 1,000 cubic inches of space and that the height plus the girth
doesn’t exceed 50 inches.
297
Chapter 20: Volumizing and Improving Your Surface

If w = 10, then h + 4w = 50 yields h + 40 = 50 and h = 10. The box is a perfect
cube that’s 10 by 10 by 10.
If w = 6.4, then h + 4w = 50 yields h + 25.6 = 50 and h = 24.4. The box is
roughly 6.4 by 6.4 by 24.4. The choice is which works better for the sup-
plier and the customer.
Maximizing the possible volume
If the mailing regulations dictate that you can’t send a rectangular box whose
height plus girth exceeds 108 inches, then how can you make the most of that
108 inches? What’s the greatest volume you can create?
The Problem: What are the dimensions of a rectangular prism (box) with a
square base that has the greatest possible volume if the height plus the girth
can be at most 108 inches?
Write an expression for the volume using the relationship that h + 4w = 108.
The base of the box is a square, so w represents both the length and the
width. Solving for h, you get h = 108 – 4w. Substitute that into the volume for-
mula, and you have V = w2(108 – 4w). Create a table, trying out different
values for w and seeing what volumes you obtain (see Table 20-2).

wondering how I knew to jump to the higher numbers and skip up to where

the width is 18 inches? The answer is simple: calculus! I got impatient with
putting in values and used calculus to tell me the exact answer — and then
just looked like a hero by going to the right spot.
Making the Most of a 12-Ounce Can
Cylindrical shapes are found in grocery stores, at oil refineries, and attached to
space shuttles. A cylinder has circles for its top and bottom and a rectangle
wrapped around its sides. The circular and rectangular shapes lend themselves
to the formulas needed to find the volume and surface area of a cylinder. The
volume of a cylinder is found by multiplying the area of the circular base times
the height of the cylinder (the distance between the circles). The surface area
is found by adding the areas of the two circles to the area of the rectangle; the
width of the rectangle is the same as the circle’s circumference.
The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr2h where r is the radius of
the circular base and h is the height between the bases or circles. To find the
surface area of a cylinder, use SA = 2πr2 + 2πrh = 2πr(r + h).
Filling a cylindrical tank
The volume of a cylindrical tank may be measured in cubic feet or cubic
yards, or you may get to work with liquid measures such as gallons or quarts.
Equivalences are used to change from one unit to another.
Equivalences:
1 cubic foot ≈7.481 gallons
1 gallon ≈0.134 cubic foot
1 ounce ≈1.805 cubic inches
The Problem: A cylindrical tank has a height that’s equal to its diameter and
it contains 128,000π cubic feet of liquid. What is the height of the tank?
Use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, replacing the V with the number
of cubic feet. The radius of a circle is half the diameter, so, if the height is
equal to the diameter, then the height is equal to twice the radius. Replace
the h in the volume formula with 2r and solve for r.

The radius of the tank is 40 feet, so the height is 80 feet.
The Problem: A cylindrical tank is to be filled with vanilla ice cream. The tank
is 6 feet tall and has a radius of 4 feet. How many gallons of ice cream will it
take to fill the tank?
First, find the volume in terms of cubic feet. Then use the equivalence for
changing cubic feet to gallons to determine the amount of ice cream needed.
The volume of the tank is V = π(4)2(6) = 96π ≈301.44 cubic feet. One cubic foot
is equal to about 7.481 gallons, so multiply 301.44 by 7.481 to get 2,255.07 gal-
lons of vanilla ice cream. Yum!
Economizing with the surface area
You see 12-ounce containers all over the place in the form of cans for soft
drinks, fruit beverages, and more potent brews. The traditional 12-ounce con-
tainer is about 4.5 inches tall and has a diameter of about 2.5 inches. The
shapes and exact sizes vary a bit, but the size is pretty standard. When you go
to the grocery store, you need to check the shelves and see how many different
heights and diameters of cans all contain 12 ounces. Looks can be deceiving. In
Figure 20-7, you see two cylinders drawn to the approximate size of the tradi-
tional 12-ounce container and the most efficient 12-ounce container. What do
you think?

Part IV: Taking the Shape of Geometric Word Problems 

The Problem: A 12-ounce beverage can has a diameter of 2.5 inches and a
height of 4.5 inches. The optimum size for a 12-ounce container (one that
uses less material to contain the same amount of fluid) is one that has a
diameter of 3 inches and a height of 3 inches. How much more material is
used to produce the traditional beverage can?
Use the formula for surface area to determine the amount of material needed
for each size can.
Diameter 2.5 = radius 1.25, height 4.5: SA = 2πr(r + h) = 
2π(1.25)(1.25 + 4.5) ≈45.14
Diameter 3 = radius 1.5, height 3: SA = 2πr(r + h) = 2π(1.5)(1.5 + 3) ≈42.39
The difference in the amount of material is almost 3 square inches. Multiply
that by millions of cans, and it’s a significant amount of material.
One of the factors that must have determined the size and shape of the tradi-
tional 12-ounce container is the cost of materials. Before the days of pop-tops,
you had to open the containers with can openers that puncture the top of
the can. The material had to be a bit stronger and heavier — and was more
expensive.
The Problem: What if the cost of the material on the sides of a 12-ounce con-
tainer is 1¢ per square inch and the cost of the material on the top and
bottom is 2¢ per square inch. How much more does it cost for the material in
a cylinder that’s 3 inches high with a 1.5-inch radius than it does for a cylin-
der that’s 4.5 inches high with a 1.25-inch radius?
The side of a cylinder is a rectangle that’s as long as the circumference of the
circle and as high as the height of the cylinder. Multiply the length times
the height to get the area. The two bases of the cylinder are circles. Find the
area of one and double it. Multiply the areas times their respective costs.
The cylinder with a radius of 1.5 inches has a circumference of 2πr = 2π(1.5) ≈
9.42 inches. Multiply that by the height, 3, and the area of the side is about
28.26 square inches. The circular bases have an area of πr2 = π(1.5)2 ≈
7.07 square inches. The total cost for the material is 28.26(1) + 2(7.07)(2) =
56.54 cents.
The cylinder with a radius of 1.25 inches has a circumference of 2πr = 2π(1.25) ≈
7.85 inches. Multiply that by the height, 4.5, and the area of the side is
about 35.33 square inches. The circular bases have an area of πr2 = π(1.25)2 ≈
4.91 square inches. The total cost for the material is 35.33(1) + 2(4.91)(2) =
54.97 cents.
The difference in the cost is about 1.5¢. Multiply that by millions of cans. . . .

Piling It On with a Conical Sand Pile
A cone has a circle for a base. The sides slant upward to meet at a single
point called the vertex. The volume of a cone is one-third the volume of a
cylinder that has the same base and same height.
The volume of a circular cone is V

, where r is the radius of the cone 
and h is the height — the distance from the center of the circular base to the
vertex or top of the cone.
The Problem: What is the height of a cone if its diameter is twice the height
and the volume of the cone is 72π cubic inches?
Use the formula for the volume of a cone, replacing the V with 72π and the
height, h, with r. Why replace the height measure with r? The diameter of a
circle is twice the radius, so the diameter is equal to 2r. If the diameter is
twice the height, then the diameter, 2r = 2h. The length of the radius is equal
to the height.

The radius is 6 inches. Because the radius and height are the same, the
height is also 6 inches.
Have you ever tried to pile sand? It doesn’t cooperate all that well. The grains
of sand don’t stick together unless they’re wet. When sand is poured from a
container, it tends to form a cone-shaped pile, spreading out farther than it
is high.
The Problem: Sand is falling off a conveyer belt and forming a conical shape
as the falling sand runs down the sides of the pile. If the height of the pile is
always one-third the diameter, then by how much does the volume of the pile
change when the pile grows from 10 feet tall to 12 feet tall?
302
Part IV: Taking the Shape of Geometric Word Problems 

Find the volume of a pile of sand that’s 10 feet tall and compare it to the
volume of a pile of sand that’s 12 feet all. The pile of sand that’s 10 feet tall
has a diameter of 30 feet — which means a radius of 15 feet. The pile of sand
that’s 12 feet tall has a diameter of 36 feet — or a radius of 18 feet.

T
he math word problems that I present in earlier chapters of this book
are categorized, grouped, and discussed for their common elements and
special properties. I provide suggestions and procedures for handling the
types of problems in each chapter.
The ten brainteasers in this chapter are some that you may have seen else-
where, some that seem vaguely familiar, and others that are completely new
to you. These brainteasers are meant to be fun and mind boggling at the
same time. Try to work them out before you peek at the answers. You’ll feel
so clever.
Three Pirates on an Island
Three pirates arrived on an island after successfully relieving a merchant
of his bars of gold. The pirates put their booty in a pile in the center of the
island and all fell asleep while guarding the gold. After a while, the first pirate
woke up and decided to take his share of the gold and hide it. So he buried
his fair share of the gold bars under a palm tree and went back to sleep.
The second pirate woke up and took what he thought was his fair share and
buried those gold bars next to a boulder. He then went back to sleep, too.
Then the third pirate awoke, took what he thought was his fair share, and hid
it under a boat. He went back to sleep. In the morning, all three pirates woke
up and discovered that there were eight bars of gold in the pile. How many
bars were in the pile in the beginning?

Answer: Working backward, the 8 bars that remained must have been two-
thirds of what was there when the third pirate did the splitting up. So the third
pirate saw 12 bars, took his 4, and left 8. If the second pirate left 12 bars, then
12 was two-thirds of what he saw, so he saw 18 bars — he took 6 and left 12.
The first pirate left 18 bars, which was two-thirds of what was there in the
beginning. One-third of 27 is 9, leaving 18 bars. There were 27 bars of gold
when the pirates all went to sleep.
Letter Arithmetic
A father received yet another letter from his son asking for money. The father
was tired of doling out the cash. So, instead of money, the father sent the fol-
lowing addition problem for his son to solve.
S

E

N
R
D
E
M

He said that if his son could figure out which digit each of the letters stood
for, he would send his son another installment of cash. What does each letter
represent to make this addition problem correct?
Answer: S = 9, E = 5, N = 6, D = 7, M = 1, O = 0, R = 8, Y = 2 
9

You figure this out with a little trial and error and a smattering of reasoning
things out. You’re pretty sure that the letter M represents 1, because it’s the
carryover from adding the number that M represents to the number that S
represents. If M represents 1, then S must represent 8 or 9 in order for the
sum to be large enough to have a carryover. Work your way backward,
trying out different digits for the different letters until you find the unique
solution.

Pouring 4 Quarts
A farmer needs to add exactly 4 quarts of weed killer to the fertilizer mix that
he’s preparing to spread over his field. Unfortunately, he has only a 3-quart
container and a 5-quart container, not a 4-quart container. He can’t just guess.
The accuracy of his measurement is most important. How can he measure
exactly 4 quarts with the two containers he has? (There are several possible
solutions, but the farmer wants the one that takes the fewest number of steps.)
Answer: The farmer fills the 5-quart container and empties 3 quarts from
that container into the 3-quart container, leaving 2 quarts in the 5-quart con-
tainer. Then he empties the 3-quart container and pours the 2 quarts from the
5-quart container into the 3-quart container, leaving room in the 3-quart con-
tainer for another quart. He fills the 5-quart container again and pours 1
quart into the 3-quart container that already contains 2 quarts. That leaves
exactly 4 quarts in the 5-quart container.
If this is a bit confusing, use Figure 21-1 to visualize it.

Magic Square
A magic square is a square array of numbers — three by three, four by four,
and so on — such that the sum of the numbers in any column, row, or diago-
nal always adds up to the same number. Place the digits from 1 through 9 into
Figure 21-2 so that each row, column, and diagonal adds up to 15.
Answer: Figure 21-3 is a solution for the magic square. You solve this pretty
much by trial and error, but you also make some strategic moves, such as
putting the number 5 in the middle, because it’s the middle value in the list
of digits. You need to put the larger digits in positions where they won’t be
added together. Play around with the numbers a bit, and you’ll find the solu-
tion. That solution is a pattern for any other list of nine consecutive numbers
to be put in a magic square and have a particular sum.
Getting Her Exercise
Seven-year-old Caitlin lives on the 50th floor of her apartment building. Every
morning she gets on the elevator outside her door and rides down to the
ground level where she waits for the school bus to pick her up for school.
Every evening Caitlin gets on the elevator on the ground floor, rides to the
40th floor, and walks up the last ten flights of stairs to her apartment. Why
does she do this?

Answer: Caitlin can’t reach the elevator button for the 50th floor — she can
only reach as high as the button for the 40th floor. So she takes the elevator
to the 40th floor and walks the rest of the way.
Liar, Liar
You approach two doors. One leads to a fabulous prize, and the other leads
to a pile of coal that needs shoveling. If you pick the door to the fabulous
prize, you get to take it home. If you pick the other door, you’ll be busy for
quite a while. Each door has a huge guard, protecting what’s on the other
side. The guard in front of the prize always tells the truth, and the guard in
front of the coal always lies. You’re allowed to ask just one question of one of
the guards to determine which door leads to the prize. What question do you
ask to determine which door goes to the prize?
Answer: You ask a guard, “If I were to ask the other guard which door leads
to the prize, what would he say?” And then pick the opposite door of what he
tells you.
If you ask that question of the guard who always tells the truth (and who
stands in front of the prize), he’ll know that the other guard lies and would
have answered that you should pick his door (the one with the coal). So the
guard telling you the truth will tell you, honestly, that the other guard would
get you to pick the door in front of the coal.
If you ask the question of the guard who always lies (and who stands in
front of the coal), he lies and say that the truth-speaking guard would tell
you to pick his (the liar’s) door. So, in either case, you want to pick the oppo-
site door.
Weighing Nine Nuggets
You’re given nine identical-looking nuggets and are told that eight of them are
fool’s gold and the ninth is real gold. The nuggets are so close in weight that
you can’t tell, by holding them in your hand, which is the heavier nugget. You
have a balance scale (shown in Figure 21-4) that you’re allowed to use exactly
twice. You can put as many nuggets in the pans of the scale as you want. How
can you single out the heavier nugget?
311
Chapter 21: Ten Classic Brainteasers

Answer: Put three nuggets in one tray and three nuggets in the other tray.
If the scale is balanced, then you know that one of the three nuggets not on
the scale is the heaviest. If one side of the scale is heavier, then you know
that the gold nugget is one of those three. In any case, you’ve isolated a
group of three nuggets that contains the gold nugget. Do another weighing
with the three nuggets, putting one nugget on each tray. If the trays are the
same height, then the nugget not being weighed is the heaviest and is the
gold. If one side is heavier, then you’ve spotted your gold nugget in that tray.
Where Did the Dollar Go?
Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel went out for lunch together. The waitress brought
them a bill for $30, so each one paid her $10. When the waitress took the cash
to the register, she realized that there’d been an error, and she should have
charged them only $25. So, when she brought the change back, Monica,
Phoebe, and Rachel each took $1 and left the other $2 as a tip (they hadn’t
read Chapter 6 of this book and didn’t know how to figure out a fair tip).
Because each friend paid $10 and got $1 back, each person actually paid $9.
Multiply $9 by 3 and add the $2 tip, and you get $27 + $2 or $29. What hap-
pened to the other dollar?
Answer: This puzzle definitely belongs in the category of sleight of hand.
Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel actually paid only $9 each, totaling $27. The bill
was $25, so subtract $25 from $27 and you have the $2 left to leave for a tip.

How Many Weights?
A merchant has a balance scale (refer to Figure 21-4) and wants to be able
to weigh any item between 1 and 50 pounds, to the nearest pound. How many
different weights does he need to buy?
Answer: He only needs six different weights to weigh anything from 1 to
50 pounds. The weights are: 1 pound, 2 pounds, 4 pounds, 8 pounds, 16 pounds
and 32 pounds. Any number from 1 through 50 (actually, you can go up to
63 pounds with these weights) can be created using combinations of the
weights.
Transporting a Fox, a Goose, and Corn
A farmer has a dilemma. She needs to transport her fox, her goose, and her
corn across a small river. She only has room for herself and one of the others
in her small boat. She’ll have to take one across the river, leave it, and go
back for the others. But if she leaves the fox alone with the goose, the fox will
eat the goose. If she leaves the goose alone with the corn, the goose will eat
the corn. How can she get everything across without someone being eaten?
Answer: For simplicity’s sake, let the fox be represented by F, the goose by G,
and the corn by C. I map it out for you in Table 21-1. The arrows indicate the
direction of the boat.

Ten Unlikely Mathematicians
In This Chapter
 Identifying a president famous for a mathematical proof
 Naming a world conqueror who did a proof while in exile
 Pointing out some contemporary figures
M
athematics has inspired so many people over the centuries. Picture a
future U.S. president sitting through a wonderfully exciting meeting of
Congress. Was he paying attention? No, he was discovering a proof of the
Pythagorean theorem, of course! Other mathematicians came from wealthy
families or monasteries. Mathematicians are found in all walks of life. Anyone
can be a mathematician with just a bit of curiosity, respect for the basic
mathematical rules, and willingness to stick her neck out a bit.
Pythagoras
How can Pythagoras be an unlikely mathematician when practically everyone
knows his name? His contributions to the world of music and mathematics
are legendary, although he would have preferred to keep his discoveries a
secret. Pythagoras was a prophet and mystic. He established a secret society
that had a strict code of conduct. Members of the society were vegetarians
who were forbidden from eating beans (lentils). The Pythagoreans, as the
society members were called, believed that odd numbers had male attributes
and even numbers had female attributes. They based their worship on
numerology and let it influence their way of life. The Pythagoreans believed
that all numbers were rational (could be written as a fraction), even though
the Pythagorean theorem belies this with its need for numbers under radicals
(irrational numbers).

Napoleon Bonaparte
Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte is known for many things, but not many people
know how much he contributed to mathematics. Napoleon was always a great
supporter of mathematical inquiry and promoted mathematical study when-
ever he could. One of his better-known contributions is his discovery that, if
you construct an equilateral triangle on each side of any other triangle, the
centers of those equilateral triangles are the vertices of another equilateral 
triangle.
Figure 22-1 shows you three different triangles — one scalene, one isosceles,
and one right. According to Napoleon, you construct an equilateral triangle (one
with all the sides the same measure) on each side of any kind of triangle — the
equilateral triangle has its sides measuring the same as that particular side of
the base triangle. When the centers of the equilateral triangles are connected
by segments, you see that Napoleon’s discovered another equilateral triangle
formed in the middle.
René Descartes
Descartes was born into a wealthy family and received a thorough, general
education at a Jesuit college. He studied law for a while but wasn’t really all
that interested in it. For some years he traveled around with various military
campaigns. Descartes wasn’t really a professional soldier. He took time off
from his accompaniment of military campaigns for some interesting travel
and study. He is known as the father of modern philosophy. His most serious
interest in mathematics may have coincided with wanting to stay warm. He
was traveling with the Bavarian army during a cold, winter campaign, and
chose to stay in bed until 10 a.m. thinking about mathematical problems.
Doesn’t sound like any army I know. In any case, Descartes made huge contri-
butions to mathematics.

President James A. Garfield
President Garfield was the first ambidextrous U.S. president and the second
president to be assassinated. He earned money to attend college by driving
canal boat teams. He was a classics professor, then college president. He
tired of the academic life, so he studied law and became a politician. While
a member of the House of Representatives, in 1876, he discovered a novel
proof of the Pythagorean theorem. Figure 22-2 shows his construction of a
trapezoid, starting with a right triangle. His proof involves the areas of the 
triangles and trapezoid.
President Garfield was shot in 1881 and died two months later of an infection.
Alexander Graham Bell tried to find the bullet with a metal detector that he
had invented, but failed — probably due to the metal in the president’s bed
frame.
Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll)
More famous for his Alice in Wonderland and Alice through the Looking-Glass,
Charles Dodgson is also well-known in mathematics circles for his work in
probability, theory of elections, and algebra. Charles Dodgson studied at and
later taught at Christ Church College, Oxford. He spent most of his time
teaching and tutoring in algebra and developed study materials for students
who were struggling with the material. His two Alice books have many refer-
ences to mathematics and logic. Dodgson liked working with children and
amused them with his stories and word games — including an early version
of Scrabble.

Chapter 22: Ten Unlikely Mathematicians

M. C. Escher
M. C. Escher was a Dutch graphic artist. His works are easily recognizable
because of the many impossible-looking constructions and titillating tessella-
tions. Figure 22-3 shows an example of the type of tessellation that Escher
might have produced. (A tessellation is a tiling or filling of the plane with fig-
ures that leave no gaps between them.)
Escher was born in 1903 in the Netherlands and lived in and traveled to many
other countries as world and political events affected his life. Although he
didn’t have any formal mathematical training, his work has strong mathemati-
cal components including order and symmetry. His journey to the Alhambra in
Spain resulted in his trying to improve upon those artworks using geometric
grids as a basis for his own work. His art took many forms from his earliest
work in 1937 until his death in 1972.
Sir Isaac Newton
Isaac Newton is probably best known for his discovery of the Law of Gravity,
supposedly due to an apple falling on his head. Whether the apple story is
true or not, his mathematical discoveries are even more remarkable, because
most of his work was done during a two-year period when he had retired to
the countryside to think and wait out the bubonic plague that was sweeping
Europe. Even more startling is the fact that this two-year period ended with
his 25th birthday.
Newton is recognized as the co-inventor of calculus. Both Newton and
Gottfried Leibniz discovered calculus at the same time, and independently,
Figure 22-3:
An Escher-
like
tessellation.
318
Part V: The Part of Tens 

but Newton waited about 20 years to publish his findings, while Leibniz pub-
lished almost immediately. Newton also discovered three laws of motion, the
Corpuscular Theory of Light, and the Law of Cooling. He built telescopes and
used them to calculate orbits of planets, but Newton’s main interest was really
alchemy. After his early discoveries in mathematics and physics, he really did
little more to add to the knowledge in these fields.
Marilyn vos Savant
Marilyn vos Savant’s column Ask Marilyn is found weekly in Parade magazine.
She started writing this column after being featured in a Parade article for her
high IQ and then responding to a selection of questions in a follow-up article.
Marilyn solves mathematical and logical problems in her column and also
answers questions on physics, philosophy, and human nature.
Perhaps you remember her response to what has been dubbed the “Monty
Hall problem” (see the nearby sidebar). In a 1990 column, she responded that
you’d have a better chance of winning if you switched doors. This lead to all
sorts of responses from academics and other readers — much of it criticism
of her answer. She was, of course, found to be correct.
Marilyn, in addition to writing her column, is Chief Financial Officer of Jarvik
Heart and assists her husband, Robert Jarvik, with cardiovascular disease
research.

Chapter 22: Ten Unlikely Mathematicians
The Monty Hall problem
Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re
given the choice of three doors. Behind one
door is a car, and behind the other two doors
are goats. You pick a door, say door #1, and the
host, who knows what’s behind the doors,
opens another door, say door #3, which has a
goat. He says to you: “Do you want to pick door
#2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your
choice of doors?
Marilyn’s answer was that you should switch,
giving you a two-thirds chance of winning
rather than one-third, if you stayed with door #1.
Why was Marilyn correct? Consider the situation
where the car is behind door #1 and goats are
behind doors #2 and #3. The game show host is
always going to show you one of the goats.
 If you pick door #1, the host will show one
of the goats behind door #2 or door #3, and
if you switch, you lose.
 If you pick door #2, the host will show you
door #3, so if you switch to door #1, you win.
 If you pick door #3, the host will show you
door #2, so if you switch to door #1, you win.
You win two-thirds of the time if you switch. This
same chance will appear, no matter where you
put the car and where you put the goats.

Leonardo da Vinci
When you think of Leonardo da Vinci, you probably think first of the artist.
As an artist, Leonardo turned to science as a means of improving his artwork.
His study of anatomy and nature led to his remarkably realistic paintings. He
was recognized as an inventor, scientist, engineer, musician, mathematician,
astronomer, and painter.
His interest in the mathematics of art and nature led him to show how the dif-
ferent parts of the human body are related by the golden rectangle. Leonardo
believed that artists should know the laws of nature as well as the rules of
perspective.
Martin Gardner
Martin Gardner first came to my attention with his Mathematical Games
column in Scientific American, which he wrote for about 25 years. In addition
to this column, he has published over 60 books.
Martin Gardner grew up in Oklahoma, served in the U.S. Navy during World
War II, and later earned his bachelor’s degree in philosophy from the
University of Chicago. He decided to try for a life as a freelance writer after
selling a humorous short story to Esquire. His second sale was a story based
on mathematical topology — a story in science fiction. He is considered to be
almost single-handedly responsible for creating the interest in recreational
mathematics in the later part of the 20th century. Some subjects that he has
popularized are
 Flexagon: A flexagon is a hexagon made up from a long strip of equilat-
eral triangles (most easily constructed from adding-machine tape).
Folding and refolding reveals the three different faces of a trihexa-
flexagon, the six faces of a hexahexaflexagon, and so on.
 Polyomino: A polyomino is a grouping of squares — three, four, five, and
so on — such that no grouping is the same shape as any other, even
when the grouping is flipped or rotated.
 Soma cubes: Soma cubes are the three-dimensional versions of polyomi-
noes. Cubes are stacked or otherwise connected, producing different
shapes that can’t be duplicated by any rotations or flips of the grouping.
 Hex: The game of Hex is played on a game board consisting of hexagons.
Players take turns choosing hexagons (usually with different-colored
game pieces) trying to form a path from one side of the board to the
other.
320
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Tangram: A seven-piece tangram starts out as a square. The different
pieces — triangles, squares, parallelogram, and so on — are rearranged
to form other shapes and pictures.
 Penrose tiling: A penrose tiling consists of rhombi (a rhombus has all
four sides the same measure) that appear to have no pattern or symme-
try but that, in fact, have repeated patterns within the tiling.
 Fractal: A fractal is a geometric shape that can be continuously broken
down into parts that are reduced copies of the original shape. The book
Jurassic Park introduced the dragon fractal and referred to chaos theory.
