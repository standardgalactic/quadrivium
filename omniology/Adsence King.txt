The VERY Black Hat AdSense with Google Trends Method
It seems that more and more often people are dropping AdSense a revenue stream do to ever 
decreasing ad clicks and the fact that traffic is just worth more through affiliate sales or CPA offers. With 
every intention of being banned from AdSense and just playing around before dropping them 
completely I started a VERY black hat AdSense campaign which, my to my initial surprise, is still going 
strong 5 months later and getting me a paid a ton!
I will not lie; this is very against AdSense ToS so you do risk being banned. All that I can say is that I have 
not gotten banned and I get paid. If you are a bit faint of heart or perhaps using your AdSense account 
for white hat things and do not want to risk it that is 100% fine just check out other programs, who do 
not care so much about quality for their advertisers and do NO manual checking. These networks 
include:

BidVertiser

MSN

AdBrite

YSM
All of these networks pay out slightly lower, on a cost per click basis, than Google AdSense but they do 
still pay and with this method you will still earn big! I can also attest to the fact that my friends who use 
this method have never been banned from AdSense either. As I said though, use it at your own risk and 
perhaps consider applying to another network so a ban will not hurt your current or future AdSense 
prospects.
Alright, now that you’ve made up your mind about what pay-per-click program you’re going to use how 
about we go ahead and get on to the method…
Set Up
The first step for setup here is start out a brand new site. You will need hosting for this, a domain is 
optional as you can always use a redirect/shortening service but you will need your own hosting as you 
are going to be editing some .php files. You can use 000webhost.com for free hosting but it does not 
look clean so I recommend moving away from it once you get paid. Since Google Trends, and our traffic 
technique, are both very short lived you will be spending about 5-10 minutes each day setting up a new 
page based around a new trend. It gets more simple next time as you have your template and only have 
to edit the URL for the new picture as well as put it the dimensions for it. This can be done on hosted 
sites only! Blogger.com/BlogSpot.com blogs will NOT work as you need to edit a .php page to make the 
code for this work!
Your very first step for the day is to head over to Google.com/trends and look for a suitable Google 
trend for the day. An ideal trend, for this method, will need to posses one of the following attributes:


Not covered by the major media networks such as Associated Press, CNN or Fox News. These 
networks will be the only things that will outrank you in Google, which is going to be your traffic 
source. Generally speaking about 1/3 of the top 100 trends fit this criterion and you can run with 
them!

The Google Trend needs to be about some sort of content that people are dying to get. This 
works with mainly two things – videos and pictures. For this method to work you will need your 
visitor to click on the picture, you will see why later.
In this example I am a bit limited today because it is the 4th of July so that takes up a ton of Google 
Trends and is not too useable to me. However, there are always at least a few Trends out there that I 
can work with. Today I went with ‘versus cycling’ which holds some great qualities; it is not covered by 
the big networks, it is related to TV so I can put up a clip and it even has a related Trend a little further 
down the list which means the possibility to add some extra traffic (this method will let you target up to 
2 Google Trends per blog post)! Here is a little shot for y’all:
Now it is time to get a little content for my new page for the day. I will head over to Google Image 
search and just type in ‘versus cycling’. I found a suitable image in about a minute, anything that looks 
like it could be a frame from a video will do just fine. Here is the image that I went with:
Now I want to make it look like a video, this is pretty darn simple! All we are going to do is to stick a play 
button right on top of it. You don’t even need Photo Shop to make this look good; I’m doing it in MS 
Paint on my laptop as a matter of fact! I have found the perfect button for you and you can get it at:

http://i869.photobucket.com/albums/ab256/bomaj4/play.jpg
Just take that image and paste it right on top of the picture that you found. My final product, for my new 
web page, is this bad boy:
Nothing too fancy but since you have to do this daily I prefer to only spend about 2 minutes total to slap 
up this picture! From here you can upload it straight to your server for use in your new web page.
You may be thinking that it is pretty black hat to get a person to click on something that isn’t what you 
make it out to be. Well, you’ve been warned this is a VERY black hat method and you haven’t seen 
anything yet! I am about to show you how to get credited for an AdSense, or other network of your 
choosing, click every time someone clicks on that video!
Now it is time to generate your AdSense code. The big thing here is that you do NOT want a 100% CTR. 
Since Google made clicks only count on the text links and not the whole ad this helped a lot. Although 
you could easily still get 80%+ CTR it WILL get you banned as it initiates a manual review by Google! 
Because of this you want to make your Ad Unit smaller than the picture size. What is going to happen is 
that this will make it so that people will have to click the correct area of the picture – your fake video –
in order to get an AdSense click. This way only a percentage of people clicking on the image will also be 
clicking your AdSense ad unit so you have a reasonable looking CTR.
So, it is now time to take this picture and hide it over your AdSense ads. In order to do this simply use 
the template that is on the following page. Create a new .txt document and paste all of it in there, then I 
will show you what needs to be changed to make it have your current image up and your AdSense ads 
behind it. Also please note AdSense now uses a new format for ads, I use copied+pasted ad units from 
my old site so it looks like this. If you do the newer ones just stick that code where my AdSense code 
shows up
Ok then, here it goes for ya:

<style>
iframe{
opacity: 0;
border: 0px none transparent;
position: absolute;
top: 0px;
left: 0px;
height: 300px;
width: 250px;
filter:alpha(opacity=0);
}
img{
position: absolute;

}
</style>

<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "pub-YOURPUBID";
google_ad_width = 300;

google_ad_channel = "YOURCHANNEL";

As you can see this is designed for a 300x250 ad unit. If you use a smaller ad unit (a must do if your 
picture is somewhat smaller) then just also change the dimensions, highlighted above in blue, to the 
dimensions of your ad unit. The areas highlighted in green reflect the height of width of your picture, be 
sure to change these to reflect whatever picture you use as well. If you are using a fairly large picture 
and do not need a smaller ad then simply change the parts highlighted in yellow. The first thing to 
change is to add the URL of the image that you created earlier (in the img src area). Next just replace the 
Google AdSense code area, also highlighted in yellow, to reflect the code that you have generated in 
your account.

The part highlighted in red is for keywords. As you know AdSense displays ads based on keywords so if 
there is no text here you will be showing VERY low paying public service ads. You will also note that I put 
a <br> in between sentences. Keep it short and keep that <br> after the first sentence or else it will get 
moved behind your image and look a bit fishy.
If you are using a different advertiser such as AdBrite then obviously you would place the AdBrite code 
in place of the AdSense code at the bottom.
This is now the end of your page set up. So to cover things, we have identified a Google Trend and built 
a page that will get all the interested traffic clicking on ads. Now, aside from my very handy promotion 
trick, all that is left is to create your ‘safe’ page to keep a manual review from slamming you – just in 
case!
We are going to go and make a new .txt document in wordpad. This guy will be extremely generic and 
safe, just slap in the following code:

A fire that destroyed Team Type 1's rider transport van threatened to burn up the team's lead 
Sunday morning in the Arizona desert at the Race Across America (RAAM).
But quick action by the crew kept the eight-rider team going and Team Type 1 led by more than 
an hour Sunday afternoon at Time Station No. 7 in Cottonwood, Ariz., 437 miles (704 km) into 
the race.
The fire started beneath the mini-van that hauls the riders and pulls the trailer carrying their 
Orbea bicycles. It happened when the van's hot catalytic converter came in contact with tall 
grass on the side of the road while the vehicle was pulled off to make a rider exchange.
Fortunately, no one was hurt. But the van was permanently damaged and a large area of the 
pavement was scorched.
Team Type 1 General Manager Tom Schuler, who is serving as a crew member for the team 

during RAAM, said he was amazing by how fast riders and staff responded to the situation.
"They had to put out the fire, disconnect the trailer hitch, reconnect the trailer to another vehicle, 
move the bikes around and get a new vehicle," Schuler said. "We were really fortunate that we 
were able to disconnect that trailer from the frame of the burned-out vehicle and move it onto a 
different van."
As a temporary stop-gap, Team Type 1 and Team Type 2 RAAM manager Dave Eldridge put 
his utility van into action as the rider vehicle until he was able to secure a new rental. Eldridge is 
the father of Joe Eldridge, who co-founded Team Type 1 with Phil Southerland in 2004.
In the wake of the fire, RAAM organizers put out a message to the more than 70 other crews 
following teams or individuals in the transcontinental race. It read, in part:
RAAM wish to extend their appreciation for the quick reaction of the crew to mitigate what could 
have been a very dangerous event. RAAM is unable to control all aspect of the Race and 
therefore they cannot take responsibility for unfortunate events that may occur during the Race. 
Please be aware of your surroundings (especially the dry ground cover in California) and the 
impact you may have on them during the race.
Follow the progress of Team Type 1 and Team Type 2 during RAAM by going to teamtype1.org. 
Both squads are providing inspiration to people affected by diabetes around the world.
Now what you will have to change is simple:
The stuff highlighted in yellow will, of course, be your ad code from before. What I have highlighted in 
blue is content. Just Google the Trend you chose and grab a short article. Copy and paste it in there and 
you have your ‘safe’ page ready to throw up. When you start to get a good burst of ad clicks simply 
throw up the safe page after you earned your goal for the day ($100? $300?) and the ‘safe’ page will 
replace your old one. This is dual purpose, first of all it will now greatly lower your CTR because you have 
the same ad up but no sneaky technique to get it clicked. Second this method will also give you a ‘safe’ 
page so that by the time an AdSense rep comes to manually check it, if you happened to go a bit 
overboard, everything will look 100% legit to them!
That’s it for the site creation. Just remember, watch it closely and throw this up once you have a 
comfortable amount of cash in for the day. Even if you do not hit your goal for the day still throw this up 
nice and early so that you can lower your CTR and avoid suspicion.
Now all that is left to do is to get some traffic. Simply head over to Digg and submit your new site. In the 
title box put your first Trend keyword exactly as it appears, in this instance it will be ‘versus cycling’. In 
the second box put your second Trend exactly as it appears also. Although this is optional as you will 
often only have 1 Trend at a time that fits well. Also put a little link bait at the end of this in the 
description, after all you do want people to click through.
As an example my title now reads: Versus Cycling
And my description reads: Versus TV – Watch versus cycling here, great clip of today’s action!

Now just go ahead and submit it. The way that this trick works is that Digg.com is LOVED by Google, at 
least short term. So, since you are not competing with CNN and Fox News your Digg.com story (not the 
actual site but the Digg submission) will hit the top of Google in about an hour for your Trend and 
remain there for 12-24 hours. This way people searching for this Trend will click on your Digg.com story 
and the click through the link there which will lead them to the page that you setup. You now have a 
TON of traffic ready to click your invisible AdSense ad!
Enjoy it and please do not get greedy and forget to throw your ‘safe’ page up. It really is some great 
money so be sure to do this and milk it long term instead of getting banned!
