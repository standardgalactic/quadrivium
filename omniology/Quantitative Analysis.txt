Preface
Preface
‚Ä¢ acknowledgements‚Ä¶
First of all, I would like to thank Lynn Dietrich (director of the Math Learning Center at Monmouth 
University, West Long Branch, New Jersey, USA) for her help in producing this tutorial text. Without her 
help, many typographical errors might not have been caught before submitting the final draft.
I would also like to extend my thanks to Sophie Tergeist (bookboon.com Ltd. ‚Äì Davenport House, 16 Pepper 
Street, London E14 9RP, United Kingdom) for her constant patience in answering my numerous questions 
during the production of this text.
‚Ä¢ explanation of how the textbook is organized‚Ä¶
This tutorial textbook has been organized into 4 chapters (units) with several individual tutorial lessons 
within each chapter. As presented in the table of contents, each of the tutorials has been listed separately 
with its objective and its starting page. For coding purposes: ‚ÄúTutorial N.M‚Äù means that the tutorial is the 
Mth lesson in chapter N.
I attempted to present each of the tutorials as if a person (teacher, tutor) was sitting next to the reader 
talking each of the concepts through. My goal was to make sure that each of the lessons was fully explained 
but still fully understandable. Hopefully this goal was met. 
‚Ä¢ description of whom I believe might be interested in using these tutorials‚Ä¶
The purpose of this tutorial textbook is to present mathematical skills (algebraic concepts) and their various 
applications that may be important to students of management (business) science. The applications included 
should allow readers to view math in a practical setting relevant to their intended careers.

Equations, Inequalities & Linear Programming
1	 Equations, Inequalities & Linear 
Programming
Tutorial 1.1	 Solve one-step equations in one variable.
The equations below are considered one-step linear equations because they are each expressed using one 
variable (x) and take exactly one step to solve:
x + 5 = 12	
x ‚Äì 7 = 18	
8x = 72	
x√∑6 = 8
Whenever we need to solve a one-step linear equation, we can talk ourselves through the process by 
asking these questions:
1.	 What value do we wish to address?
2.	 Within the given equation, what operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) 
are we doing with the value that needs to be addressed?
3.	 What is the opposite of the operation answered in question #2? (Apply the operation named 
here to both sides of the equation and we will derive the solution to the given equation.)
example 1.1a	
	
Solve for the variable: x + 5 = 12
x + 5 = 12 ‚Üí x + (5 ‚Äì 5) = (12 ‚Äì 5) ‚Üí x = 7
We wish to address the 5 that is being added to the variable x. Since the 5 is 
being added, we need to subtract it from both sides of the equation. And, since 
12 ‚Äì 5 = 7, the answer to the equation is: x = 7.
example 1.1b	
	
Solve for the variable: x ‚Äí 7 = 18
x ‚Äì 7 = 18 ‚Üí x + (‚Äì7 + 7) = (18 + 7) ‚Üí x = 25
We wish to address the 7 that is being subtracted from the variable x. Since the 
7 is being subtracted, we need to add it to both sides of the equation. And, since
18 + 7 = 25, the answer to the equation is: x = 25.

We wish to address the 8 that is being multiplied with the variable x. Since the 8 
is being multiplied, we need to divide it on both sides of the equation. And, since  
72 √∑ 8 = 9, the answer to the equation is: x = 9.

Solve for the variable: x √∑ 6 = 8
x √∑ 6 = 8 ‚Üí x (√∑ 6 √ó 6) = (8 √ó 6) ‚Üí x = 48
We wish to address the 6 where the variable x is being divided by 6. Since the 
6 is being divided, we need to multiply it on both sides of the equation. And, 
since 8 √ó 6 = 48, the answer to the equation is: x = 48.

Tutorial 1.2	 Solve two-step equations in one variable.
The equations below are considered two-step linear equations because they are each expressed using one 
variable (x) and take exactly two steps to solve:
2x + 5 = 17	
	
3x ‚Äì 7 = 26

x +

x ‚àí

When solving a two-step equation, we will be performing the order of operation (PEMDAS) in reverse 
order‚Ä¶which means that we should address any values that are being added or subtracted first and then 
address any values that are being multiplied or divided. Therefore, whenever we need to solve a two-step 
linear equation, we can talk ourselves through the process by asking these questions:
1.	 What value is being added to or subtracted from the variable term? (This is the value that 
needs to be addressed first.)
2.	 How should we undo the value that is being added to or subtracted from the variable 
term? (We will need to transform the given equation into a one-step equation by adding 
or subtracting the value that needs to be addressed as we did in a previous tutorial. 
Remember to apply the opposing operation to both sides of the equation and we will derive 
a transformed equation that will lead to the solution to the given equation.)
3.	 Within the transformed equation, how should we undo the value that is being multiplied 
with the variable? Or, how should we undo the value that is the divisor of the variable? 
(Remember to apply the opposing operation named here to both sides of the equation and 
we will derive the solution to the given equation.)
example 1.2a	
	
Solve for the variable: 2x + 5 = 17
2x + 5 = 17 ‚Üí 2x + (5 ‚Äì 5) = (17 ‚Äì 5) ‚Üí 2x = 12 ‚Üí 2

We should first address the 5 that is being added to the variable term of 2x. Since 
the 5 is being added, we need to subtract it from both sides of the equation. 
And, since 17 ‚Äì 5 = 12, the transformed equation should read: 2x = 12. Secondly, 
since the 2 is being multiplied with the variable x in the transformed equation, 
we will need to divide each side to the transformed equation by 2. After doing 
this, the solution to this equation is: x = 6.

We should first address the 7 that is being subtracted from the variable term 
of 3x. Since the 7 is being subtracted, we need to add it to both sides of the 
equation. And, since 26 + 7 = 33, the transformed equation should read: 3x = 33. 
Secondly, since the 3 is being multiplied with the variable x in the transformed 
equation, we will need to divide each side to the transformed equation by 3. 
After doing this, the solution to this equation is: x = 11.

And, since ‚Äì3 ‚Äì 4 = ‚Äì7, the transformed equation should read: 7
x  = ‚Äì7. Secondly, 
since the x is being divided by the 7, we will need to multiply each side of the

Tutorial 1.3	 Solve multi-step equations involving like-terms.
Terms that have exactly the same variable combination (or lack thereof) are considered like-terms‚Ä¶
which can then be combined into a transformed term. For example, consider the like-terms of 2x and 3x. 
When added: 2x + 3x = 5x. Or, when subtracted: 2x ‚Äì 3x = ‚Äì1x. We can use this combining like-terms 
strategy to simplify linear equations as those given below:
3x + 5 + 5x ‚Äì 9 = 12	 	
4x ‚Äì 3 ‚Äì 7x + 3 = 12	
	
2x ‚Äì 6 + 3x + 8 = ‚Äì33
example 1.3a	
	
Solve for the variable: 3x + 5 + 5x ‚Äì 9 = 12
3x + 5 + 5x ‚Äì 9 = 12 ‚Üí (3x + 5x) + (5 ‚Äì 9) = 12 ‚Üí 8x ‚Äì 4 = 12 ‚Üí

Combining like-terms, 3x + 5x = 8x and 5 ‚Äì 9 = ‚Äì4. We have now transformed 
the given equation into a two-step equation: 8x ‚Äì 4 = 12. We should next 
address the 4 that is being subtracted from 8x by adding 4 to both sides of the  
equation‚Ä¶which results into the one-step equation: 8x = 16. To determine the 
final solution of the given equation, divide both sides of the equation by 8. Thus 
the solution is: x = 2.

Tutorial 1.4	 Solve multi-step equations involving parentheses.
Occasionally, linear equations will contain parentheses or other grouping symbols. Following the order 
of operations (PEMDAS), we need to address the grouping symbols first. Therefore, we will use the 
Distributive Property to clear these parentheses (or other grouping symbols).
Distributive Property over Addition:
a(b + c) = ab + ac
Distributive Property over Subtraction:
a(b ‚Äì c) = ab ‚Äì ac
example 1.4a	
	
Solve for the variable: 5(3x ‚Äì 8) = ‚Äì70
5(3x ‚Äì 8) = ‚Äì70 ‚Üí 5(3x) + 5(‚Äì8) = ‚Äì70 ‚Üí 15x ‚Äì 40 = ‚Äì70 ‚Üí

Since the 5 is being multiplied with the entire contents of the parentheses, we 
need to apply the Distributive Property‚Ä¶multiplying the 5 with the 3x and 
then the 5 with the ‚Äì8. We have transformed the given equation into a two-step 
equation: 15x ‚Äì 40 = ‚Äì70. We must than address the 40 that is being subtracted 
from 15x by adding 40 to both sides of the equation‚Ä¶which results into a one-
step equation: 15x = ‚Äì30. To determine the final solution of the given equation, 
divide both sides of the equation by 15. Therefore, the solution of the given 
equation is: x = ‚Äì2.

equation: ‚Äì28x + 56 = 140. We must than address the 56 that is being added 
to ‚Äì28x by subtracting it from both sides of the equation‚Ä¶which results into a 
one-step equation: ‚Äì28x = 84. To determine the final solution, divide both sides 
of the equation by ‚Äì28 which results in the solution: x = ‚Äì3.

multi-step equation: 10x ‚Äì 24 + 15x = 26. After combining the like-terms of 
10x and 15x, we now have the transformed two-step equation: 25x ‚Äì 24 = 26. 
We must than address the 24 that is being subtracted from 25x by adding 24 
to both sides of the equation‚Ä¶which results into the one-step equation: 25x = 
50. To determine the final solution, divide both sides of the equation by 25‚Ä¶
resulting in the solution: x = 2.

Tutorial 1.5	 Solve multi-step equations where the variable appears on each side of 
the equation.
Occasionally, linear equations will have variables on both sides of the equation. We will need to transform 
the given equation so that the variable appears on only one side of the new equation.
example 1.5a	
	
Solve for the variable: 7x = 2x ‚Äì 25
7x = 2x ‚Äì 25 ‚Üí (7x ‚Äì 2x) = (2x ‚Äì 2x) ‚Äì 25 ‚Üí 5x = ‚Äì25 ‚Üí 5

‚àí

 ‚Üí x = ‚Äì5
Since the variable x appears on both sides of the given equation, we need to bring 
one of the variable terms to the other side. Since it is usually preferable (although 
not absolutely necessary) to move the smaller coefficient of the variable terms 
to the larger, we should subtract 2x from both sides of the equation‚Ä¶resulting 
in the one-step equation: 5x = ‚Äì25. Dividing both sides of the transformed 
equation by 5, we obtain the final solution: x = ‚Äì5.
example 1.5b	
	
Solve for the variable: 16x ‚Äì 4 = 38x + 84
16x ‚Äì 4 = 38x + 84 ‚Üí (16x ‚Äì 16x) ‚Äì 4 = (38x ‚Äì 16x) + 84 ‚Üí ‚Äì4 = 22x + 84 ‚Üí

terms on both sides, we need to bring one of them to the other side. It is usually 
preferable (although not absolutely necessary) to move the smaller coefficient 
of the variable terms to the larger‚Ä¶so, we should subtract 16x from both sides 
of the equation to handle the variable terms and subtract 84 from both sides of 
the equation to handle the numeral terms. These actions result in the one-step 
equation: ‚Äì88 = 22x. Dividing both sides of the transformed equation by 22, we 
obtain the final solution: x = ‚Äì4.

Tutorial 1.6	 Solve multi-step inequalities in one variable.
We can apply the strategies of solving multi-step equations to solve multi-step inequalities‚Ä¶especially 
since the only difference between these number sentences is the relationship symbols used. Equations 
will always use the ‚Äúis equal to‚Äù (=) sign while inequalities will use one of these comparison signs:
<
‚Ä¶which is read: ‚Äúis less than‚Äù
>
‚Ä¶which is read: ‚Äúis greater than‚Äù
‚â§
‚Ä¶which is read: ‚Äúis less than or equal to‚Äù
‚â•
‚Ä¶which is read: ‚Äúis greater than or equal to‚Äù
‚â†
‚Ä¶which is read: ‚Äúis not equal to‚Äù

2.	 Dividing both sides by 8‚Ä¶resulting in: x < 3.
NOTE: Any value less than 3 would be considered a correct solution.

2.	 Dividing both sides by 36‚Ä¶resulting in: x ‚â† 2.
NOTE: Any value other than 2 would be considered a correct solution.
Whenever we multiply or divide by a negative number in the solution of an inequality, we must ‚Äúflip‚Äù 
the given relationship‚Ä¶so that < (is less than) will become > (is greater than) or vice-versa. The same 
thing would happen when the relationship symbol was an = (is equal to) or a ‚â† (is not equal to)‚Ä¶but, 
when we flip these symbols we don‚Äôt see any physical change.

Tutorial 1.7	 Graph the solution of multi-step equations or inequalities (in one 
variable) on a number line.
Occasionally, we will need to graph the solutions to a linear equation or inequality on a number line. 
How we do this depends on the relationship symbol used in the given number sentence. In general, 
solve each given number sentence so that the variable is on the left of the solution sentence and then 
use the relationship symbol to determine how the solution graph will look. If the reference value is 
included within the solution set, we need to use a solid dot and if the reference value is not included in 
the solution set, we need to use an open dot.
example 1.7a	
	
Graph the solution on a number line: 45 ‚Äì 13x = 19
45 ‚Äì 13x = 19 ‚Üí (45 ‚Äì 45) ‚Äì 13x = (19 ‚Äì 45) ‚Üí ‚Äì13x = ‚Äì26 ‚Üí

1.	 Subtracting 45 from both sides‚Ä¶resulting in: ‚Äì13x = ‚Äì26.
2.	 Dividing both sides by ‚Äì13‚Ä¶resulting in: x = 2.
3.	 Since just +2 is the only number value that will satisfy the given 
equation, we just need to place a solid dot on +2 as shown below:
example 1.7b	
	
Graph the solution on a number line: 16x ‚Äì 55 < ‚Äì7
16x ‚Äì 55 < ‚Äì7 ‚Üí 16x + (‚Äì55 + 55) < (‚Äì7 + 55) ‚Üí 16x < 48 ‚Üí 16

2.	 Dividing both sides by 16‚Ä¶resulting in: x < 3.
3.	 Since the solution set for the given inequality is x < 3, we need to place an 
open dot on +3 and an arrow going to the left (the same direction that the 
relationship symbol points) from the open dot as shown below:

Tutorial 1.8	 Graph a line that passes through two given points.
To graph a line that passes through two given points, we must first plot the given points as described 
by the ordered pairs. Every ordered pair (x, y) refers to a specific movement on the coordinate grid 
(sometimes called a Cartesian Plane). The first number in the ordered pair (sometimes called the abscissa) 
indicates a horizontal movement from the origin (0, 0) which is the point at which the two perpendicular 
number lines that define the coordinate grid intersects each other. The second number in the ordered 
pair (sometimes called the ordinate) indicates a vertical movement from the desired horizontal position.
The two perpendicular number lines divide the coordinate plane into four quadrants (sections) that are 
designated as shown in the diagram below:

‚Ä¢ Any point in the first quadrant (Q1) has a positive x and a positive y.
‚Ä¢ Any point in the second quadrant (Q2) has a negative x and a positive y.
‚Ä¢ Any point in the third quadrant (Q3) has a negative x and a negative y.
‚Ä¢ Any point in the fourth quadrant (Q4) has a positive x and a negative y.
‚Ä¢ Any point on the x-axis (the horizontal number line) has a y of zero (0).
‚Ä¢ Any point on the y-axis (the vertical number line) has an x of zero (0).

Tutorial 1.9	 Graph a linear equation using its x- and y-intercepts.
The x-intercept of a linear equation is the point where its graphed line will cross the horizontal (x) axis. 
All x-intercepts are similar in that the ordinates are zero (0). Thus, the coordinate of an x-intercept takes 
the form of: (x, 0).
The y-intercept of a linear equation is the point where its graphed line will cross the vertical (y) axis. 
All y-intercepts are similar in that the abscissas are zero (0). Thus, the coordinate of a y-intercept takes 
the form of: (0, y).
To use the x- and y-intercepts to graph a linear equation, determine the ordered pairs (coordinates) for 
the points of intersection on each of the axes of the coordinate grid. Plot these calculated points. Use 
these points to draw the desired linear graph.

Tutorial 1.10	 Graph a linear equation (in slope-intercept form) using its slope and 
y-intercept.
Linear equations can be expressed using two different formats:
‚Ä¢ Slope-Intercept form (y = mx + b) where the m represents the slant (slope; rise over run) 
and b represents the y-intercept of the graphed line.
‚Ä¢ Standard form (Ax + By = C) where A represents any non-negative integer while B and C 
represent any integers.

When a linear equation is formatted in its slope-intercept format, the b value that is being added or 
subtracted from the x term can be rewritten into coordinates of: (0, b). As done previously, we can use 
this point to graph the linear equation. The coefficient (value in front) of the x will aid us in determining 
a second point to be used in our graphing task. The numerator (top value) of a fractional slope indicates 
the rise (vertical movement) that the desired line will take while the denominator (bottom value) indicates 
the run (horizontal movement). A second plot point can be calculated by: (0 + h, b + v)

moving horizontally from the origin (0, 0) but then 
making a vertical move of 5 units up. (See the blue point 
located on the upper portion of the vertical axis.)
2.	 Use the fractional slope to determine the needed vertical 
(rise) and horizontal (run) moves off of the y-intercept. 
For this example, we will need to move 3 units up and 4 
units to the right from the y-intercept of (0, 5). Make a 
mark at this position: (0 + 4, 5 + 3) or (4, 8). (See the blue

Tutorial 1.11	 Graph a linear equation (in standard form) using its slope and 
y-intercept.
The easiest way to graph a linear equation when it is presented in its standard form (Ax + By = C) is 
to use its x- and y-intercepts as we did in a previous tutorial. However, there may be times when the 
x-intercept is not easily plotted. Therefore, another way to graph a standard form equation is to convert 
it into its slope- intercept form (y = mx + b).
example 1.11a	 	
Use the slope and the y-intercept to graph: 4x + 3y = 12
Using the axis intercepts for this equation, we can see that the x-intercept is (3, 0) while the y-intercept 
is (0, 4). So, this equation can be easily graphed using these points. However, let‚Äôs use the slope-intercept 
conversion so that we can compare methods. To rewrite the given standard form equation into its slope-
intercept format:
1.	 Subtract 4x from both sides of the equation: 4x + 3y = 12 ‚Üí 3y = 12 ‚Äì 4x
2.	 Divide both sides of the equation by 3: 3y = 12 ‚Äì 4x ‚Üí y = (12‚ÅÑ‚ÇÉ) ‚Äì (‚Å¥‚ÅÑ‚ÇÉ)(x) = 4 ‚Äì (‚Å¥‚ÅÑ‚ÇÉ)(x)
3.	 Reformat the equation into proper slope-intercept format: y = 4 ‚Äì (‚Å¥‚ÅÑ‚ÇÉ)(x) ‚Üí y = (‚Äì‚Å¥‚ÅÑ‚ÇÉ)(x) + 4 
We can see from our result of this step that the y-intercept of this given equation is (0, 4) 
and the fractional slope is ‚Äì‚Å¥‚ÅÑ‚ÇÉ. Now, graph the given equation using its slope-intercept form.

5.	 Use the fractional slope to determine the needed 
vertical (rise) and horizontal (run) moves off of the 
y-intercept. For this example, we will need to move 4 
units down and 3 units to the right from the y-intercept 
of (0, 4). Make a mark at this position: (0 + 3, 4 ‚Äì 4) or 
(3, 0).

‚Ä¢ It can run vertically (where the top and the bottom portions are on the same level and the 
graphed line is parallel to the y-axis) and will then have a slope that is undefined (diagram 
#4).
The slant of any graphed line is determined by the (x, y) coordinates that are either given or are derived 
by a companion linear equation. So, let‚Äôs take a look at the coordinate sets that might produce each of 
the diagrams above.

Notice that for diagram #1 each successive ordinate (y) has a common difference of ‚Äì4 and that each 
successive abscissa (x) has a common difference of ‚Äì4. To go from point to point we would need to ‚Äúrise‚Äù 
‚Äì4 units (which means go down 4 units) and then ‚Äúrun‚Äù ‚Äì4 units (which means go to the left). Thus, the

Tutorial 1.13	 Use the slope-intercept formula to write the equation of a line with a 
given slope and point.
If we know the slope and the y-intercept of a linear equation, we can easily write the slope-intercept  
(y = mx + b) form of the desired equation‚Ä¶
example 1.13a	 	
Write the slope-intercept equation for the line that has the given slope and 
passes through the given point: slope = ‚Äì2, P = (0, 3)
Since we know the slope, we know that m = ‚Äì2‚Ä¶and, since we know the y-intercept, we know (0, b) 
and that b = 3. All we need to do is to substitute these values into the slope-intercept (y = mx + b) form 
of the equation: y = mx + b ‚Üí y = ‚Äì2x + 3 ‚Üí equation: y = ‚Äì2x + 3

Since we know the slope, we know that m = 3

(0, b) and that b = ‚Äì5. All we need to do is to substitute these values into the slope-intercept (y = mx + 
b) form of the equation: y = mx + b ‚Üí y = (0.75)(x) + ‚Äì5 ‚Üí equation: y = 0.75x ‚Äì 5

If we know the slope and a point that is not a y-intercept, we can still use the slope-intercept (y = mx + b) 
format to write the desired equation‚Ä¶
example 1.13c	 	
Write the slope-intercept equation for the line that has the given slope and 
passes through the given point: slope = ‚Öî, P = (3, 2)
Since we know the slope, we know that m = 
‚Ä¶and, since we know a point through which the graphed 
line will pass, we know (x, y) and that x = 3 when y = 2. All we need to do is substitute these values into 
the slope-intercept (y = mx + b) form of the equation to solve for the value of b:
y = mx + b ‚Üí 2 = ( 23 )(3) + b ‚Üí b = 2 ‚Äì ( 23 )(3) = 2 ‚Äì 2 = 0
With the value of b = 1 and the value of m = 23 , we can write the slope-intercept form of the equation:
y = ( 2

example 1.13d	 	
Write the slope-intercept equation for the line that has the given slope and 
passes through the given point: slope = 0, P = (1, 2)
Since we know the slope, we know that m = 0‚Ä¶and, since we know a point through which the graphed 
line will pass, we know (x, y) and that x = 1 when y = 2. All we need to do is substitute these values into 
the slope-intercept (y = mx + b) form of the equation to solve for the value of b:
y = mx + b ‚Üí 2 = (0)(1) + b ‚Üí b = 2 ‚Äì (0)(1) = 2 ‚Äì 0 = 2
With the value of b = 2 and the value of m = 0, we can write the slope-intercept form of the equation:
y = (0)(x) + 2‚Ä¶or, simply: y = 2. (NOTE: Since the slope was zero, the graphed line will be horizontal. 
Any horizontal line graphed on a coordinate grid will have the general equation of: y = b.)
example 1.13e	 	
Write the slope-intercept equation for the line that has the given slope and 
passes through the given point: slope = undefined, P = (‚Äì3, ‚Äì1)
When the slope of the line is undefined, we cannot really use the slope-intercept formula to determine 
the desired equation. Since we know that the slope is undefined, we know that the difference of the 
abscissas is zero (0)‚Ä¶which means that the y-values of all graphed points are identical. And, since the 
slope is undefined, the graphed line will be vertical. Any vertical line graphed on a coordinate grid will 
have the general equation of: x = N (which is the given abscissa value). So, for this particular example, 
the equation is: x = ‚Äì3

Tutorial 1.15	 Write the standard form of an equation of a line given its slope and a 
point.
Although the slope-intercept (y = mx + b) form is used most often when using graphing technology, 
there may be times when we want to express the desired equation in its standard (Ax + By = C) form. 
We can accomplish this desired format in one of three ways:
‚Ä¢ Reformat the slope-intercept (y = mx + b) form into standard (Ax + By = C) form.
‚Ä¢ Reformat the point-slope (y2 ‚Äì y1 = m(x2 ‚Äì x1)) form into standard (Ax + By = C) form.
‚Ä¢ Use the slope and some arithmetic to determine the standard (Ax + By = C) form.
example 1.15a	 	
Write a slope-intercept equation for the line that has the given slope and 
passes through the given point: slope = ‚Äì2, P = (0, 3)
method #1:	
reformatting the slope-intercept form‚Ä¶
Since all of the values in the slope-intercept (y = mx + b) form of the equation are integers, just rearrange 
the terms so that the x and y terms are on the left-hand side of the equation while the non-variable term 
is on the right-hand side.
slope = ‚Äì2 and P = (0, 3) ‚Üí slope-intercept: y = ‚Äì2x + 3
Adding 2x to both sides of the equation, we get: 2x + y = 3
method #2:	
reformatting the point-slope form‚Ä¶
1.	 Use the point-slope format to structure an equation:
y ‚Äì y1 = m(x ‚Äì x1) ‚Üí y ‚Äì 3 = ‚Äì2(x ‚Äì 0) ‚Üí y = ‚Äì2(x ‚Äì 0) + 3 = ‚Äì2x + 0 + 3 = ‚Äì2x + 3 ‚Üí y = ‚Äì2x + 3
Adding 2x to both sides of the equation, we get: 2x + y = 3
method #3:	
using the slope‚Ä¶
Since the slope of any linear equation is ‚ÄìA/B and the slope for this example is ‚Äì2, we know that A = 2 
when B = 1. Since the given point is (0, 3), we know that x = 0 when y = 3. Using all of this information, 
we can determine the value of C in the standard (Ax + By = C) form of the desired equation:
(A)(x) + (B)(y) = C ‚Üí C = (2)(0) + (1)(3) = 0 + 3 = 3 ‚Üí equation is: 2x + y = 3

example 1.15b	 	
Write a slope-intercept equation for the line that has the given slope and 
passes through the given point: slope = 3
4 , P = (0, ‚Äì5)
method #1:	
reformatting the slope-intercept form‚Ä¶
The slope and the y-intercept is given:
slope = 3
4 and P = (0, ‚Äì5) ‚Üí slope-intercept: y = ( 3
4 )(x) ‚Äì 5
Since the slope value in the slope-intercept (y = mx + b) form of the equation is not an integer, we need 
to multiply the entire equation through by the denominator of the slope‚Ä¶for this example, that would 
be 4. After multiplying both sides of the equation by 4, we get the transformed equation: 4y = 3x ‚Äì 20. 
We can now rearrange the terms so that the x and y terms are on the left-hand side of the equation 
while the non-variable term is on the right-hand side. Subtracting 3x from both sides of the transformed 
equation, we get: ‚Äì3x + 4y = ‚Äì20. However, recall that in standard form, the value of A should be  
positive‚Ä¶therefore, we need to multiply the entire equation by ‚Äì1‚Ä¶which results in: 3x ‚Äì 4y = 20.
method #2:	
eformatting the point-slope form‚Ä¶
1.	 Use the point-slope format to structure an equation:
y ‚Äì y1 = m(x ‚Äì x1) ‚Üí y ‚Äì (‚Äì5) = ( 3
4 )(x ‚Äì 0) ‚Üí y + 5 = ( 3
4 )(x ‚Äì 0) 
y = ( 3
4 )(x ‚Äì 0) ‚Äì 5 ‚Üí y = ( 3
4 )(x) ‚Äì 5
2.	 Multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator (4): 4y = 3x ‚Äì 20
3.	 Subtract 4y from both sides of the equation: 0 = 3x ‚Äì 4y ‚Äì 20
4.	 Add 20 to both sides of the equation: 3x ‚Äì 4y = 20
method #3:	
using the slope‚Ä¶
Since the slope of any linear equation is ‚ÄìA/B and the slope for this example is 3
4 , we know that A = 3 
when B = ‚Äì4. (NOTE: Since the A value needs to be positive, make it positive now rather than later.) 
Since the given point is (0, ‚Äì5), we know that x = 0 when y = ‚Äì5. Using all of this information, we can 
determine the value of C in the standard (Ax + By = C) form of the desired equation:
(A)(x) + (B)(y) = C ‚Üí C = (3)(0) + (‚Äì4)(‚Äì5) = 0 + 20 = 20 ‚Üí equation: 3x + 4y = 20
example 1.15c	 	
Write a slope-intercept equation for the line that has the given slope and 
passes through the given point: slope = 2
3 , P = (3, 2)
method #1:	
reformatting the slope-intercept form‚Ä¶
slope = 23 and P = (3, 2) ‚Üí y = ( 23 )(x) + b ‚Üí 2 = ( 23 )(3) + b
b = 2 ‚Äì ( 23 )(3) = 2 ‚Äì 2 = 0 ‚Üí y = ( 23 )(x)

Since the slope value in the slope-intercept (y = mx + b) form of the equation is not an integer, we need 
to multiply the entire equation through by the denominator of the slope‚Ä¶for this example, that would 
be 3. After multiplying both sides of the equation by 3, we get the transformed equation: 3y = 2x. We 
can now rearrange the terms so that the x and y terms are on the left-hand side of the equation while 
the non-variable term is on the right-hand side. Since we want 2x to be positive, subtract 3x from both 
sides of the transformed equation, to get: 0 = 2x ‚Äì 3y (which can also be written as: 2x ‚Äì 3y = 0).
method #2:	
 reformatting the point-slope form‚Ä¶
1.	 Use the point-slope format to structure an equation:
y ‚Äì y1 = m(x ‚Äì x1) ‚Üí y ‚Äì 2 = ( 23 )(x ‚Äì 3) ‚Üí y = ( 23 )(x ‚Äì 3) + 2
y = ( 23 3)(x) ‚Äì 2 + 2 ‚Üí y = ( 23 )(x) + 0 ‚Üí y = ( 23 )(x)
2.	 Multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator (3): 3y = 2x
3.	 Subtract 3y from both sides of the equation: 0 = 2x ‚Äì 3y
method #3: 	
using the slope‚Ä¶
Since the slope of any linear equation is ‚ÄìA/B and the slope for this example is 2/3, we know that A = 2 
when B = ‚Äì3. Since the given point is (3, 2), we know that x = 3 when y = 2. Using all of this information, 
we can determine the value of C in the standard (Ax + By = C) form of the desired equation:
(A)(x) + (B)(y) = C ‚Üí C = (2)(3) + (‚Äì3)(2) = 6 + ‚Äì6 = 0 ‚Üí equation: 2x ‚Äì 3y = 0

Tutorial 1.17	 Determine whether the lines for a pair of equations are parallel, 
perpendicular or coincide with each other.
When two linear equations are graphed on the same coordinate grid, these lines can interact with each 
other in one of three ways:
‚Ä¢ The two graphed lines can intersect each other‚Ä¶meeting at exactly one point. If the two 
lines form right angles, they are considered perpendicular with each other‚Ä¶but, the lines 
will still only have one point of intersection. (See diagram #1 below for an example.)
‚Ä¢ The two graphed lines can be parallel with each other‚Ä¶meaning that they do not touch each 
(intersect with) other at all. (See diagram #2 below for an example.)
‚Ä¢ The two graphed lines can coincide‚Ä¶meaning that the lines will lie on top of each other. 
Although there will be two equations, the finalized graph will look as if there was only one 
line drawn. (See diagram #3 below for an example.)

6x ‚Äì 4y = 12
3x ‚Äì 2y = 18
5x ‚Äì 2y = 10
10x ‚Äì 4y = 20

(x, 0) = (2, 0)
slope = 10/4
(0, y) = (0, ‚Äì5)
(x, 0) = (2, 0)
We can analyze what elements of the linear equations will produce each of the possible interactions. 
Below each of the graphed equations, we have listed the slope, y-intercept and x-intercept for the graphed 
lines. Notice that:
‚Ä¢ The two graphed lines will intersect when the two slopes are not equal (diagram #1).
‚Ä¢ The two graphed lines will be perpendicular to each other when the two slopes are negative 
reciprocals of each other‚Ä¶meaning that the product of the two slopes will be ‚Äì1. (diagram #1)

‚Ä¢ The two graphed lines will coincide when both the two slopes and the y-intercepts are equal 
to each other. (diagram #3)
We can use these observations to determine whether two lines will be parallel, perpendicular, coincide 
or just intersect directly from their equations. Just follow these steps:
1.	 Find the slope for each given equation.
2.	 Find the y-intercept for each given equation.
3.	 Use the information obtained to determine how the lines will interact with each other.

given line.
For two graphed lines to be parallel to each other, they must have equal slopes but different y-intercepts. 
Thus, to find the slope-intercept equation for the line that is parallel to a given line and passes through 
a given point, just do these steps:
1.	 Determine the slope of the given line.
2.	 Determine the values of x and y are to be used to complete the task.
3.	 Verify that the given point is not a solution for the given line‚Ä¶otherwise, the new line will

Tutorial 1.19	 Write the equation of a line through a given point that is 
perpendicular to a given line.
For two graphed lines to be perpendicular to each other they must have slopes that are negative reciprocals 
of each other‚Ä¶that is, the product of the two slopes must be ‚Äì1. Thus, to find the slope-intercept equation 
for the line that is perpendicular to a given line and passes through a given point:
1.	 Determine the slope of the given line.
2.	 Determine the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line.
3.	 Determine the values of x and y are to be used to complete the task.
4.	 Verify that the given point is not a solution for the given line‚Ä¶otherwise, the new line will 
coincide with the given line and will not be perpendicular to the given line.
5.	 Decide in what format to express the desired equation and then determine the desired 
equation.

Tutorial 1.20	 Solve a system of linear equations by graphing
When we solve a system of linear equations, we are looking for the one point (ordered pair) that will be 
a solution for all of the equations in the system. When we solve a system by graphing, we are looking 
for the point of intersection contained in the graphs of the equations in the system. Therefore, we can 
accomplish the desired task by:
1.	 Graph each of the equations contained within the given system on the same coordinate grid.
(Remember that we can use whatever graphing method we prefer: the x- and y-intercepts, the 
slope and y-intercept, the slope and any solution point, or a full set of solution points.)
2.	 Determine the coordinates for the point of intersection (if it exists). This will be the solution 
of the given system.
NOTE #1	
If the lines do not intersect at all, then there is no solution to the system.
NOTE #2	
If the lines coincide, then there are infinitely many solutions‚Ä¶all of the points 
that lie on the graphed line(s).
Solve the given system of linear equations by graphing on a coordinate grid:

Tutorial 1.21	 Solve a system of linear equations by substitution.
Although solving a system of equations by graphing is not that difficult, not too many people walk around 
with graph paper. So, an algebraic solution method might be preferable. One such algebraic method is 
using substitution‚Ä¶where one of the variables (either x or y) is replaced with a value and/or an expression 
containing the remaining variable. The goal here is to work with an equation that contains only one 
variable rather than two. Basically, just follow these steps to solve a system of equations by substitution:
1.	 Solve one of the given equations (no difference which one) for one of the variables (again, 
no difference which one).
2.	 Replace the result from step #1 into the second equation‚Ä¶solving the second equation for 
the remaining variable.
3.	 Take the answer from step #2 and substitute back into the first equation to find the value of 
the second variable.
4.	 Form the solution for the system by putting the values into an ordered pair (x, y).
5.	 Check the proposed solution ordered pair by substituting the values into each of the given 
equations.
example 1.21a	 	
Solve the given system of linear equations through algebraic substitution:
3x = 12 4x ‚Äì 3y = 10
1.	 3x = 12 ‚Üí x = 12 √∑ 3 = 4 (For this example, the solution is a value rather than an 
expression.)
2.	 4x ‚Äì 3y = 10 ‚Üí 4(4) ‚Äì 3y = 10 ‚Üí 16 ‚Äì 3y = 10 ‚Üí ‚Äì3y = 10 ‚Äì 16 = ‚Äì6 ‚Üí y = ‚Äì6 √∑ ‚Äì3 = 2
3.	 No need to complete step #3 for this particular example since we already know the value of 
x (as determined in step #1) as well as the value of y (as determined in step #2).
4.	 system solution: x = 4, y = 2 ‚Üí (4, 2)
5.	 3x = 12 ‚Üí x = 4 ‚Üí 3(4) = 12‚Ä¶passed 1st test
6.	 4x ‚Äì 3y = 10 ‚Üí x = 4, y = 2 ‚Üí 4(4) ‚Äì 3(2) = 16 ‚Äì 6 = 10‚Ä¶passed 2nd test
example 1.21b	 	
Solve the given system of linear equations through algebraic substitution:
x + 3y = 3 3x ‚Äì 2y = 31
1.	 x + 3y = 3 ‚Üí x = 3 ‚Äì 3y (For this example, the solution is an expression in terms of y.)
2.	 3x ‚Äì 2y = 31 ‚Üí 3(3 ‚Äì 3y) ‚Äì 2y = 31 ‚Üí 9 ‚Äì 9y ‚Äì 2y = 31 ‚Üí 9 ‚Äì 11y = 31 ‚Üí
‚Äì11y = 31 ‚Äì 9 = 22 ‚Üí y = 22 √∑ ‚Äì11 = ‚Äì2
3.	 x + 3y = 3 ‚Üí y = ‚Äì2 ‚Üí x + 3(‚Äì2) = 3 ‚Üí x ‚Äì 6 = 3 ‚Üí x = 3 + 6 = 9
4.	 system solution: x = 9, y = ‚Äì2 ‚Üí (9, ‚Äì2)
5.	 x + 3y = 3 ‚Üí x = 9, y = ‚Äì2 ‚Üí (9) + 3(‚Äì2) = 9 ‚Äì 6 = 3‚Ä¶passed 1st test
3x ‚Äì 2y = 31 ‚Üí x = 9, y = ‚Äì2 ‚Üí 3(9) ‚Äì 2(‚Äì2) = 27 + 4 = 31‚Ä¶passed 2nd test

In some ‚Äúspecial‚Äù cases, all of the variables will be eliminated leaving a numeric equation. When all of 
the variables disappear, we need to determine whether the numeric equation is a true statement or a false 
statement. If true, then the given system has infinitely many solutions because the lines will coincide on 
a coordinate grid. If false, then the given system will have no solution because the lines will be parallel 
to each other and not intersect each other at all.

Tutorial 1.22	 Solve a system of linear equations by elimination.
Substitution is only one of the algebraic methods to solve a system of linear equations. The second 
method is an elimination process using addition and/or subtraction (which is sometimes called linear 
combination). Again the goal is to work with an equation that contains only one variable rather than 
two. Basically, just follow these steps to solve a system of equations by elimination:
1.	 Determine which of the given variables is the easiest to eliminate. (It makes no difference 
which of the two variable is eliminated first.)
2.	 Determine the best strategy to eliminate the chosen variable. (This strategy may involve just 
adding straight down, just subtracting straight down, or multiplying then adding straight 
down.)
3.	 After applying the strategy from step #2, solve the resulting equation for its variable.
4.	 Using the result from step #3, substitute back into one of the original equations (no 
difference which one) and solve for the remaining variable.
5.	 Form the solution for the system by putting the values into an ordered pair (x, y).
6.	 Check the proposed solution ordered pair by substituting the values into each of the given 
equations.
example 1.22a	 	
Solve this system of linear equations through algebraic elimination:
2x + y = 8
5x ‚Äì y = 13
1.	 The easiest variable to eliminate is the y.
2.	 Take advantage of the opposite signs in front of the y-terms and 
add straight down: 7x = 21
3.	 Solve for x by dividing both sides by 7: 7

4.	 Substituting back into either of the original equations, solve for y:

Equations, Inequalities & Linear Programming
In some ‚Äúspecial‚Äù cases, all of the variables will be eliminated leaving a numeric equation. When all of 
the variables disappear, we need to determine whether the numeric equation is a true statement or a false 
statement. If true, then the given system has infinitely many solutions because the lines will coincide on 
a coordinate grid. If false, then the given system will have no solution because the lines will be parallel 
to each other and not intersect each other at all.
example 1.22e	 	
Solve the given system of linear equations through algebraic elimination:
6x + 4y = 24
3x + 2y = 12
1.	 The easiest variable to eliminate is the y.
2.	 Needing both y coefficients to be the same number, multiply 
the second equation by ‚Äì2: ‚Äì2(3x + 2y = 12) ‚Üí ‚Äì6x ‚Äì 4y = ‚Äì24
3.	 Adding straight down: 0 = 0
Since all of the variables disappeared, this system is a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù 
case and we must determine whether the resulting numeric 
equation is true or false. Since 0 = 0 is true, this system has 
infinitely many solutions.

Tutorial 1.23	 Solve a system of 3 equations in 3 variables.
We can adapt the elimination (or linear combination) method to solve systems that contain more than 
two equations. One such adaptation is called the left to right method where we eliminate the variable 
on the far left first and then work our way to the right‚Ä¶
example 1.23a
Solve the given system
x ‚Äì 3y ‚Äì z = ‚Äì5
x ‚Äì 2y + z = 3
2x ‚Äì 6y + z = ‚Äì1
Follow these steps:
1.	 Group the given equations so that they are in pairs.
2.	 	Following the left to right method, we will need to eliminate the z variable first. Taking 
advantage of the +/‚Äì sign before the z terms, add straight down:

3.	 Following the left to right method, we will need to eliminate 
the y variable next. Pair the two-variable equations from step 
#2 and then solve for x:
‚Ä¢ Multiply 1st equation by 9 ‚Üí 9(2x ‚Äì 5y = ‚Äì2) ‚Üí 18x ‚Äì 45y = ‚Äì18
‚Ä¢ Multiply 2nd equation by ‚Äì5 ‚Üí ‚Äì5(3x ‚Äì 9y = ‚Äì6) ‚Üí ‚Äì15x + 45y = 30
‚Ä¢ Add straight down ‚Üí 3x = 12
‚Ä¢ Now, divide both sides of the equation by 3 ‚Üí x = 4

Another adaptation of the elimination (or linear combination) method is called the right to left method 
where we eliminate the variable on the far right first and then work our way to the left‚Ä¶following the 
same process that we did with the left to right method.
example 1.23a
Solve the given system
x ‚Äì 3y ‚Äì z = ‚Äì5
x ‚Äì 2y + z = 3
2x ‚Äì 6y + z = ‚Äì1
Follow these steps:
1.	 Group the given equations so that they are in pairs.
2.	 Following the right to left method, we will need to eliminate the x variable first. Multiply the 
top equation for the first pair by ‚Äì1 and then add straight down. Multiply the top equation 
for the second pair by ‚Äì2 and then add straight down:
x

3.	 Following the left to right method, we will need to eliminate the y variable next. Since the 
y was eliminated in step #2 for the second pair of equations, all we need to do is use the 
second pairing to solve for z. Dividing both sides of the equation, we get: z = 3
4.	 Using the z value obtained in step #3, we would normally use either of the equations 
obtained in step #2‚Ä¶however, since the second equation already has y eliminated, just use 
the first equation obtained in step #2 to solve for y:
‚ÄÉ y + 2z = 8 ‚Üí y + 2(3) = 8 ‚Üí y = 8 ‚Äì 6 = 2 ‚Üí y = 2

annual return of 10% of her investment and the other (y) returns 15% per 
year on her investment. Her total amount return from the two investments 
is $55,000. How much is invested in each property?
1.	 Translate the given information sentences into their equivalent equations:

Divide both sides of the equation by ‚Äì0.5
y
=
200,000
3.	 Use the value of y obtained above and either of the original equations to solve for x:
x + y = 450,000 ‚Üí x + 200,000 = 450,000 ‚Üí x = 450,000 ‚Äì 200,000 ‚Üí x = 250,000
0.10x + 0.15y = 55,000 ‚Üí 0.10x + 0.15(200,000) = 55,000 ‚Üí 0.10x = 55,000 ‚Äì 30,000 ‚Üí
0.10x = 25,000 ‚Üí x = (25,000)(10) ‚Üí x = 250,000
4.	 Use the derived solutions to answer the word problem:
solution: The woman invested $250,000 at the 10% rate and $200,000 at the 15% rate.
example 1.24b	 	
A bank lent $250,000 to a company for the development of two products. 
If the loan for product ‚ÄúA‚Äù was for $75,000 more than that for product ‚ÄúB‚Äù, 
how much was lent for each product?
1.	 Translate the given information sentences into their equivalent equations:
‚Ä¢ A bank lent $250,000 to a company for the development of two products.
translation ‚Üí A + B = 250,000
‚Ä¢ The loan for product ‚ÄúA‚Äù was for $75,000 more than that for product ‚ÄúB‚Äù.
translation ‚Üí A = B + 75,000
2.	 Solve the system of equations obtained from the translations using the substitution method:
A = B + 75,000
A + B = 250,000
(B + 75,000) + B = 250,000
Substitute the expression for A into the second equation.
2B + 75,000 = 250,000
Combine like-terms.
2B = 250,000 ‚Äì 75,000 = 175,000
Subtract 75,000 from both sides of the equation.
B = 175,000 √∑ 2 = 87,500
Divide both sides of the equation by 2.

The Monmouth Emergency Management Agency is charged with providing 
services to three types of clients (A, B, C) after a major crisis. A total of 
1000 clients are to be served, with $445,000 available for counseling and 
$285,000 available for food/shelter. Type A clients require an average of $300 
for counseling and $400 for food/shelter. Type B clients require an average 
of $600 for counseling and $300 for food/shelter. Type C clients require 
an average of $400 for counseling and $200 for food/shelter. Under these 
constraints, how many of each type of client can be served?
1.	 Translate the given information sentences into their equivalent equations:
‚Ä¢ A total of 1000 clients are to be served.
translation ‚Üí A + B + C = 1000
‚Ä¢ counseling: A @ $300, B @ $600, C @ 400, total available = $400,000
translation ‚Üí 300A + 600B + 400C = 445,000
‚Ä¢ food/shelter: A @ $400, B @ $300, C @ $200, total available = $312,500
translation ‚Üí 400A + 300B + 200C = 285,000
2.	 Solve the system of equations obtained from the translations:
‚Ä¢ Pair the equations:
300A + 600B + 400C = 445,000 with A + B + C = 1000
400A + 300B + 200C = 285,000 with A + B + C = 1000
‚Ä¢ Using the right to left method, eliminate C first by multiplying the second equations so 
that the C terms cancel each other out:

the vertical (y) intercept. Occasionally, the variable costs are also referred to as marginal costs.
In a linear total revenue function, the x represents the number of units being produced. The variable 
revenue can be thought of as the rate of change or slope of the function. Notice that a linear total revenue 
function will have a vertical (y) intercept of zero. The variable revenue may also be referred to as marginal 
revenue.

Profit is the difference between the amount received from sales (revenue) and the total amount spent to 
produce the product (cost). Thus, when the revenue and the costs are known, profit can be calculated 
by: Profit = (Total Revenue) ‚Äì (Total Cost)‚Ä¶or‚Ä¶P(x) = R(x) ‚Äì C(x)
In a linear profit function, the x represents the number of units being produced. The variable profits can 
be thought of as the rate of change or slope of the function while the fixed profits can be thought of as 
the vertical (y) intercept. The variable profits may also be referred to as marginal profits.

Suppose a stereo receiver manufacturer has the given total cost function and 
the given total revenue function: C(x) = 200x + 3500 and R(x) = 450x
a)	 If 1000 units are produced, find the total costs for this product.
x = 1000 ‚Üí C(1000) = 200(1000) + 3500 = $203,500 ‚Üí answer: $203,500
b)	 If 1000 units are produced, find the total revenue for this product.
x = 1000 ‚Üí R(1000) = 450(1000) = $450,000 ‚Üí answer: $450,000
c)	 If 1000 units are produced, find the total profits for this product.
profit = revenue ‚Äì cost = 450,000 ‚Äì 203,500 = 246,500 ‚Üí answer: $246,500

Tutorial 1.28	 Find the break-even point for cost & revenue functions.
The phrase break-even point refers to the point at which the total cost and the total revenue are equal 
to each other: C(x) = R(x). Or, in other words, when there is no profit: P(x) = 0. When we use the total 
cost and the total revenue functions to determine the break-even point, we are actually solving a system 
of linear equations‚Ä¶
example 1.28a	 	
Find the number of units (x) that must be sold to break even if a manufacturer 
has these given total cost and total revenue functions	 C(x) = 200x + 3500
R(x) = 450x
solution #1:
break-even: C(x) = R(x) ‚Üí 200x + 3500 = 450x
Subtracting 200x from both sides ‚Üí 3500 = 450x ‚Äì 200x = 250x ‚Üí 3500 = 250x
Dividing both sides by 250 ‚Üí x = 3500 √∑ 250 = 14
Evaluate the C(x) function when x = 14 ‚Üí C(14) = 200(14) + 3500 = 6300
Evaluate the R(x) function when x = 14 ‚Üí R(14) = 450(14) = 6300 
answer: The break-even point occurs when x = 14 and y = 6300.
solution #2:
C(x) = 200x + 3500; R(x) = 450x ‚Üí P(x) = R(x) ‚Äì C(x) ‚Üí
 P(x) = 450x ‚Äì (200x + 3500) = 450x ‚Äì 200x ‚Äì 3500 = 250x ‚Äì 3500
break-even: P(x) = 0 ‚Üí 250x ‚Äì 3500 = 0 ‚Üí 250x = 3500 ‚Üí x = 14
Evaluate the C(x) function when x = 14 ‚Üí C(14) = 200(14) + 3500 = 6300
Evaluate the R(x) function when x = 14 ‚Üí R(14) = 450(14) = 6300 
answer: The break-even point occurs when x = 14 and y = 6300.

Tutorial 1.29	 Evaluate and graph supply & demand functions.
The Laws of Supply and Demand state that:
‚Ä¢ The quantity (x) supplied will increase as the price of a product increases‚Ä¶or‚Ä¶will decrease 
as the price of a product decreases.
‚Ä¢ The quantity (x) demanded will increase as the price of a product decreases‚Ä¶or‚Ä¶will 
decrease as the price of a product increases.
If the supply function for a particular product is linear, then the slope of its graph will be positive since 
the quantity and the price both go up together or down together. If the demand function for a particular 
product is linear, then the slope of its graph will be negative since the quantity goes up while the price 
goes down‚Ä¶or vice-versa: the quantity goes down while the price goes up.
If S(x) = the supply function and D(x) = the demand function, comparing S(x) with D(x) will help us 
determine whether there will be a surplus (having more than needed to satisfy the demand) or a shortage 
(not having enough to satisfy the demand) of the product in question:
‚Ä¢ A surplus will occur when S(x) > D(x).
‚Ä¢ A shortage will occur when S(x) < D(x).

product are shown. Use these graphs to answer the following questions:

c)	 How many units are supplied when the price is $300?
answer: 200‚Ä¶Using graph #2, we can see that the point of intersection of 
the supply function (black line) and the P = 300 (red) line is: (200, 300)‚Ä¶

example 1.29b	 	
Suppose that a certain product has the following supply and demand 
functions:
S(x) = 0.5x + 10 D(x) = ‚Äì0.5x + 40
Will there be a market surplus or shortage for this product when its price 
is $32?
answer #1: Both of the given functions have 
been graphed on the coordinate grid at the 
right. Since we are interested in the price of 
$32, we have drawn a horizontal (red) line 
where P = 32. Notice that the horizontal (red) 
line intersects with the D(x) function before 
it intersects with the S(x). Thus, S(x) > D(x) 
which means that there will be a market 
surplus.

Tutorial 1.30	 Write the equation (in slope-intercept form) for a supply function and/
or a demand function.
The supply function for a given scenario defines the amounts and unit prices that the manufacturer 
(supplier, wholesaler) is willing to supply a particular product. The demand function for a given scenario 
defines the amounts and unit prices that the retailer (customer, buyer) is willing to purchase a particular 
product.
example 1.30a	 	
Suppose that the owner of a local shoe store will buy only 10 pairs of a 
certain shoe if the unit price is $90 but 20 pairs if the unit price is $65. The 
manufacturer of the shoes is willing to provide 75 pairs if the unit price 
is $130 but only 45 pairs if the unit price is $70. If both of the supply and 
demand functions are linear:
a)	 Write the equation (in slope-intercept form) for the supply function.
b)	 Write the equation (in slope-intercept form) for the demand function.
To write the equation for the supply function, determine that the sentence about the manufacturer should 
be used. Then just follow these steps‚Ä¶
‚Ä¢ Use the given information to create two ordered pairs (Q, P): P1 = (75, 130), P2 = (45, 70)

Recall that the slope of all linear demand functions will be negative while the slope of all linear supply 
functions will be positive. If we are not sure which given information should be used for the supply 
function or which given information should be used for the demand function, just determine the slope 
for each of the sentences‚Ä¶the negative slope will be the demand function.
NOTE:	 Although the same slope values were used for the supply functions in each of these examples 
that may not always be the case. And, although the same slope values were used for the demand 
functions in each of these examples that may not always be the case.

Tutorial 1.31	 Determine the market equilibrium for a given scenario.
Market equilibrium is the point of compromise between the suppliers and the demanders of a product. 
In other words, the market equilibrium is the point of intersection when the supply function is equal 
to the demand function: S(x) = D(x). The point at which the market equilibrium occurs is sometimes 
called the equilibrium point (Q, P).
example 1.31a	 	
Suppose that the owner of a local shoe store will buy only 20 pairs of a 
certain shoe if the unit price is $80 but 30 pairs if the unit price is $55. The 
manufacturer of the shoes is willing to provide 60 pairs if the unit price is $70 
but only 50 pairs if the unit price is $50. If both of the supply and demand 
functions are linear, find the market equilibrium for this scenario.
Just follow these steps to answer this word problem‚Ä¶
‚Ä¢ Determine which sentence refers to the supply function: manufacturer = supplier
‚Ä¢ Determine which sentence refers to the demand function: owner = retailer
‚Ä¢ Use the given information to create ordered pairs (Q, P)‚Ä¶two ordered pairs for the supply 
function and two ordered pairs for the demand function:
‚ÄÉ supply function: P1 = (60, 70); P2 = (50, 50)
‚ÄÉ demand function: P1 = (20, 80); P2 = (30, 55)

Tutorial 1.32	 Graph a linear inequality in two variables.
When we graph a linear equation, the correct display will only be a straight line with a certain slope and 
y-intercept. All of the points on the graphed line will be included in the solution set for the equation.
However, when we graph a linear inequality, there will be a lot more points that should be included in 
the solution set for the inequality. In order to properly graph a linear inequality, we need to determine 
a feasible solution region by plotting a boundary line and then shading the portion of the coordinate 
plane that is appropriate for the given linear inequality. Sometimes the boundary line will be included 
in the feasible solution region and sometimes it won‚Äôt. The relationship symbol used in the given linear 
inequality will determine whether or not the boundary line is to be included:
‚Ä¢ If the ‚Äúis less than‚Äù symbol (<) or the ‚Äúis greater than‚Äù symbol (>) is used in the given linear 
inequality, the boundary line should not be included in the feasible solution region and 
should be shown as a dotted line on the coordinate graph.
‚Ä¢ If the ‚Äúis less than or equal to‚Äù symbol (¬£) or the ‚Äúis greater than or equal to‚Äù symbol (‚â•) 
is used in the given linear inequality, the boundary line should be included in the feasible 
solution region and should be shown as a solid line on the coordinate graph.
example 1.32a	 	
Graph this linear inequality on a coordinate grid: y < 2x + 4 
1.	 Graph the boundary line by plotting: y = 2x + 4
m = 2, y-intercept = (0, 4), x-intercept = (‚Äì2, 0)
Since < is used, the boundary line should be dotted.
2.	 Use a test point (any point that is not on the boundary 
line) to determine which side of the coordinate plane 
should be shaded. The easiest test point to use is (0, 0). If 
x = 0 and y = 0 then substitute these values into the given 
linear inequality to determine whether (0, 0) will be part 
of its solution set:
y < 2x + 4 ‚Üí 0 < 2(0) + 4 ‚Üí 0 < 4
Since this numeric statement is true, shade over the test point.

If (0, 0) is on the boundary line, then select any other point that is not on the boundary line for the 
test point and substitute the x and y values into the given linear equation. Suppose we chose (6, 4) as 
the test point for this inequality, then: y < 2x + 4 ‚Üí 4 < 2(6) + 4 ‚Üí 4 < 16. This numeric statement is  
true‚Ä¶therefore, shade over the test point (0, 0).

Tutorial 1.33	 Solve a system of linear inequalities in two variables.
We can find the solution of a system of linear inequalities by graphing on a coordinate grid just as we 
can for a system of linear equations. The only difference is that we are not looking for the intersection 
of lines (as we do with a system of linear equations) but for the intersection of feasible solution regions.
All we need to do to graph any system of linear inequalities is to graph each inequality individually 
(boundary line plus shading) and see where the shaded regions will overlap. It does not matter how 
many inequalities are contained in the given system‚Ä¶just repeat the same steps.
Remember that:
‚Ä¢ The boundary lines may be dotted (when < or > are used) or solid (when ¬£ or ‚â• are used).
‚Ä¢ If the boundary line is dotted, then it is not part of the feasible solution region.
‚Ä¢ If the boundary line is solid, then it is part of the feasible solution region.
‚Ä¢ The shaded area will be determined by using any test point (x, y).
‚Ä¢ The easiest test point to use is (0, 0) but any will do ‚Äì just as long as it is not on the 
boundary line.
‚Ä¢ Shade over the test point (x, y) if it produces a true statement when substituted into the inequality.
‚Ä¢ Shade away from the test point (x, y) if it produces a false statement.
‚Ä¢ When graphing a system of inequalities graph each inequality individually and then see 
where the shaded parts will overlap.

Tutorial 1.34	 Name the vertices for the feasible solution region for the given system 
of linear inequalities.
When we use graphing a system of linear inequalities in a business application, we will often need to 
use numbers greater than zero as the domain (the permissible replacements for x) and the range (the 
permissible replacements for y). Therefore, we will often restrict the possible values to be used by including 
these additional inequalities: x ‚â• 0, y ‚â• 0‚Ä¶and so on‚Ä¶one additional inequality for each variable needed 
to complete the task of graphing a system of linear inequalities. These additional inequalities will guarantee 
that the entire graph will be displayed in the first quadrant (top right quarter) of the coordinate plane 
and that all of the numbers used will be greater than zero.
When we graph a system of linear inequalities, the feasible solution region is polygonal in shape. The 
number of inequalities contained in the given system will determine how many sides the polygonal 
shape will have. The points (coordinates) at which these sides intersect are called the vertices of the 
feasible solution region.

NOTE:	 The last two inequalities (x ‚â• 0, y ‚â• 0) will guarantee that the final graph will be displayed in the 
first quadrant (top right quarter) of the coordinate plane. When graphing technology (such as 
MS Excel) is used, we can format the axes of the graph to reflect that the horizontal and vertical 
axes begin at (0, 0). If we had not restricted the display to the first quadrant, point (0, ‚Äì30) would 
be displayed.
Now we need to examine the feasible solution region for the given 
system of linear inequalities to determine its vertices (the points where 
the sides of the polygonal region intersect). The feasible solution 
region for the given system of linear inequalities is displayed at 
the right without any extra lines or shading. Because of the given 
constraints (inequalities), this feasible solution region is a polygonal 
region with 4 sides. The red dots are the vertices of the feasible solution 
region. The coordinates of these vertices can be determined from the 
graph itself since each one is considered a lattice point (located at the 
intersection of two grid lines).

Therefore, the vertices of the given system are: (0, 0), (0, 60), (20, 0) and (40, 30)
However, there may be times when the vertex coordinates will not be located at the intersection of grid 
lines. In that case, we can always determine these coordinates by solving a series of systems that use 
pairs of equations that are derived from the given inequalities.

Tutorial 1.35	 Determine the optimal minimum or maximum value of a given linear 
function that is subject to constraints as defined by the given system 
of inequalities.
In business, it is often useful to determine the minimum or the maximum values that can occur for a 
particular situation: minimum costs, maximum revenue, maximum profits, and the like. If the constraints 
for the particular task can be represented by linear inequalities, then we can graph the inequalities to 
determine the vertices for the appropriate feasible solution region. We then can use the vertices to 
determine the requested minimum or maximum value possible for a given linear objective function.

Notice that the last two given inequalities (constraints) will guarantee 
that all of the desired graphs will be in the first quadrant (top right 
quarter) of the coordinate plane. Also, since the first three inequalities 
(constraints) are all using the relationship symbol of ‚Äú¬£‚Äù (is less than 
or equal to), all of the lines should be ‚Äúsolid‚Äù (which means that the 
points on these lines are included in the solution region) and the 
shading should be towards (0, 0) on the coordinate plane.
Now that we have each of the main inequalities graphed, we need to 
determine where they overlap. Since the shading of all three main 
inequalities (constraints) are toward (0, 0), the shading that should 
be displayed in the solution region will also be towards (0, 0).

Equations, Inequalities & Linear Programming
Notice that the last two given inequalities (constraints) will guarantee that all of the desired graphs will 
be in the first quadrant (top right quarter) of the coordinate plane. Also, since the first three inequalities 
(constraints) are all using the relationship symbol of ‚Äú‚â§‚Äù (is less than or equal to), all of the lines should be 
‚Äúsolid‚Äù (which means that the points on these lines are included in the solution region) and the shading 
should be towards (0, 0) on the coordinate plane. 
Now that we have each of the main inequalities graphed, we need to determine where they overlap. 
Since the shading of all three main inequalities (constraints) are toward (0, 0), the shading that should 
be displayed in the solution region will also be towards (0, 0).

To evaluate the objective function, substitute the values of x and y using the coordinates of each vertex. 
Then, examine the results: 30, 18, 21, 32‚Ä¶
‚Ä¢ Which one is the smallest? That would be the minimum value possible for the given 
constraints.
‚Ä¢ Since this solution region continues on indefinitely away from (0, 0), there will be no 
maximum value for the given objective function.
When the feasible solution region is contained on all sides (as shown in the graph for example 1.35a), 
there will be a minimum as well as a maximum value for the given objective function.
When the feasible solution region is an ‚Äúunbounded‚Äù region and the shading is going infinitely towards 
the positive regions of the coordinate plane (as shown in the final graph for example 1-35b), there will 
be no maximum value of the given objective function. On the other hand, when the feasible solution 
region is an ‚Äúunbounded‚Äù region and the shading is going infinitely towards the negative regions of the 
coordinate plane, there will be no minimum value of the given objective function.

Using the vertex coordinates, we obtain the 
evaluations of 50, 60, 110 and 180. The lowest 
of these evaluations is 50. Therefore, the optimal 
minimum value for the given constraints is 50 
when x = 0 while y = 50.
MAX = 50 when x = 0, y = 50
Remember that if we cannot read the vertex coordinates from the grid, we can always determine the 
intersection points by solving system of linear equations:
think of: x + 3y ‚â• 60
think of: 2x + y ‚â• 50
think of: x + y ‚â• 40

Tutorial 1.38	 Solve applications involving linear programming.
When we are solving real-world applications where linear programming might be useful, we will need 
to translate the written word into an appropriate (equivalent) set of inequalities that can then be solved 
as a system (as was explained in previous tutorials). 
example 1.38a	 	
The Monmouth Bakery Company makes regular cake mixes as well as 
gourmet pancake mixes that are sold at various groceries stores in the area:
‚Ä¢ Each pound of the regular cake mix uses 0.4 pound of flour and 0.1 
pound of shortening.
‚Ä¢ Each pound of the gourmet pancake mix uses 0.6 pound of flour, 0.1 
pound of shortening and 0.4 pound of sugar.
‚Ä¢ Suppliers can deliver at most 8400 pounds of flour, at least 800 
pounds of shortening, and at most 2000 pounds of sugar.
If the profit per pound is 25¬¢ for regular cake mix and 35¬¢ for gourmet 
pancake mix, how many pounds of each mix should be made to earn 
maximum profit? What is that maximum profit?

Sometimes, translation is made a bit easier by organizing the given information into a data table (as has 
been done in the table at the left below). We can then use the organized table to write the constraints for 
the given word problem. Notice that the supplier can deliver at most one quantity and at least another. 
In mathematical translations, at most is translated into the ‚â§ (is less than or equal to) sign because the 
amount delivered cannot go over the stated amount. The phrase at least is translated into the ‚â• (is greater 
than or equal to) sign because the amount delivered cannot be any lower than the stated amount. Also, 
remember that when completing a real-world business application, we want to use numbers that are 
greater than or equal to zero‚Ä¶thus: x ‚â• 0 and y ‚â• 0. The information given about the profit will aid us 
in creating the objective function for this scenario.

0.4y ¬£ 2000
x-values:
x ‚â• 0
y-values:
y ‚â• 0
objective:
F = 0.25x + 0.35y
Now that we have the system of inequalities and the objective function translated from the given word 
problem, we can now go about the task of graphing the system on a coordinate grid, shading in the 
feasible solution region, determining the coordinates of any appropriate vertices and then determining 
the values of x and y that produce the optimal maximum profit for this given situation.
Note that one of the constraints (inequalities) has a different relationship sign than the others‚Ä¶thus, we 
have a system with mixed constraints. When shading, we will need to pay attention to this fact so that 
we arrive at the correct feasible solution region.

The last two inequalities (constraints) guarantee that the 
graph will be in the first quadrant. We have graphed each 
of the first three inequalities (constraints). Now we just 
need to determine where the overlap exists among all 
of the given inequalities (constraints). Then we need to 
determine the vertex coordinates of the points where the 
graphed lines intersect and form the polygonal solution 
region.

F = 0.25x + 0.35y
3000
5000
F = 0.25(3000) + 0.35(5000) = 2500
13,000
5000
F = 0.25(13000) + 0.35(5000) = 5000
21,000
0
F = 0.25(21000) + 0.35(0) = 5250
8000
0
F = 0.25(8000) + 0.35(0) = 2000

Finally, just find the highest (maximum) value of these evaluations. Using the vertex coordinates, we 
obtain the evaluations of: 2500, 5000, 5250 and 2000‚Ä¶the highest of these evaluations being: 5250. 
Therefore, the optimal maximum value for the given constraints is:
MAX = 5250 when x = 21000 and y = 0

The Monmouth Drapery Company makes 3 types of draperies at 2 different 
locations:
‚Ä¢ At location #1, it can make 20 pairs of deluxe drapes, 15 pairs of 
better drapes, and 6 pairs of standard drapes per day.
‚Ä¢ At location #2, it can make 10 pairs of deluxe drapes, 20 pairs of 
better drapes, and 12 pairs of standard drapes per day.
The company has orders for 2000 pairs of deluxe drapes, 2250 pairs of better 
drapes, and 1200 pairs of standard drapes. If the daily costs are $900 per 
day at location #1 and $750 per day at location #2, how many days should 
be scheduled at each location in order to fill the orders at minimum cost? 
What is that minimum cost?

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet‚Äôs 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF‚Äôs innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world‚Äôs wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

F = 900(200) + 750(0) = 180,000
Finally, just find the highest (maximum) value of these evaluations. Using the vertex coordinates, we 
obtain the evaluations of	
150,000
120,000
127,500
180,000
The lowest of these evaluations is: 120,000. Therefore, the optimal minimum value for the given constraints 
is: MAX = $120,000 when x = 50 and y = 100 (which means that the company should schedule 50 days 
at location #1 and 100 days at location #2 to make enough draperies to satisfy the given orders).

Tutorial 2.4	 Identify the element (entry) at a given location (MRC).
Although what each of the rows/columns represent is important when using matrices, there may be times 
when we need to address just one element (member, entry) of the data being displayed in a matrix. We 
can do this by thinking of any location within a matrix as being defined by coordinates that use the row/
column position as its basis. Any position (location) within a given matrix can be described by using the 
name of the matrix and the row/column numbers in which the desired element is located.

Tutorial 2.6	 Find the transpose of a matrix.
The order of a given matrix is important. However, a given matrix may not have an appropriate order 
(dimensions) for a particular use. Therefore, there may be times when we want to rearrange or transpose 
the order of a matrix. When we perform a transposition for a given matrix, we swap the elements 
(members, entries) so that the first row becomes the first column, the second row becomes the second 
column, the third row becomes the third column, and so on.
The mathematical symbol for a transposed matrix name ‚ÄúM‚Äù is: MT

Tutorial 2.7	 Determine the negative of a matrix.
Just as we have negative numbers (which is really nothing more than a number with a minus sign in 
front), we also have negative matrices‚Ä¶which is nothing more than putting a minus sign in front of 
each of the given elements (members, entries).
The mathematical symbol for a negative matrix name ‚ÄúM‚Äù is: ‚ÄìM

Tutorial 2.8	 Use matrices to present and interpret given data.
example 2.8	
	
A poll of 5004 people was completed asking the respondents their registered 
political party and their opinion about how they felt about the NJ Governor‚Äôs 
job performance: 
‚Ä¢ Of those registered as Democrats (D), 387 approved, 680 did not 
approve and 139 had no opinion.
‚Ä¢ Of those registered as Republicans (R), 1270 approved, 640 did not 
approve and 1131 had no opinion.
‚Ä¢ Of those registered as Independents (I), 204 approved, 192 did not 
approve and 58 had no opinion.
‚Ä¢ Of those who were not registered (NR), 139 approved, 97 did not 
approve and 67 had no opinion.
a)	 Use the given information to create a 4 √ó 3 matrix.
b)	 Use the given information to create a 3 √ó 4 matrix.
c)	 What is the relationship between the two matrices?
d)	 How many Democrats (D) were included in the poll results?
e)	 How many Republicans (R) were included in the poll results?
f)	 How many Independents (I) were included in the poll results?
g)	 How many poll respondents were not registered?
h)	 How many poll respondents approved of the Governor‚Äôs job 
performance?
i)	 How many poll respondents did not approve of the Governor‚Äôs job 
performance?
j)	 How many poll respondents had no opinion toward the Governor‚Äôs job 
performance?
answers:
a)	 Since the desired matrix is to have 4 rows 
and 3 columns, we need to determine the 
labels for these rows and columns. We have 
4 political affiliations, so these affiliations 
should be the labels for the rows. We have 
3 approval ratings so these ratings should 
be the labels for the columns.

Tutorial 2.9	 Add matrices.
When we need to add two or more matrices together, we must first make sure that the order of each 
matrix to be added is the same as the others. We cannot add matrices if these dimensions are different. 
Once we have established that the given matrices can in fact be added, we just add elements (members, 
entries) that are located in the same spot of each matrix. The sum of these multiple additions will be 
written in the common location in the answer matrix:

The first matrix has an order of: 3 √ó 4 while the second matrix has an order 
of: 4 √ó 3. Since these dimensions are not identical, these matrices cannot be 
added together.
NOTE:	 As long as the dimensions of the matrices that are to be added are the same, it makes no difference 
which of the matrices comes first. Therefore, the Commutative Property applies to the addition 
of matrices.
Tutorial 2.10	 Subtract matrices.
When we need to subtract two or more matrices, we must first make sure that the order of each matrix 
to be added is the same as the others. We cannot subtract matrices if these dimensions are different. 
Once we have established that the given matrices can in fact be subtracted, we just subtract elements 
(members, entries) that are located in the same spot of each matrix. The difference of these multiple

The first matrix has an order of: 3 √ó 4 while the second matrix has an order of:  
4 √ó 3. Since these dimensions are not identical, these matrices cannot be 
subtracted.
NOTE:	 Since the second matrix in each matrix subtraction becomes its negative, the order in which the 
problem is presented makes a difference. Therefore, the Commutative Property does not apply 
to matrix subtraction.

a)	 Use the proper array (matrix) operation to produce the matrix that 
represents the total production at the two plants for September and 
October by performing the proper matrix operation.
b)	 Use the proper array (matrix) operations involving matrices ‚ÄúM‚Äù, ‚ÄúP‚Äù 
and ‚ÄúS‚Äù to create the matrix that represents the inventories at the end of 
September.
c)	 If matrix ‚ÄúP‚Äù also represents the inventories at the plants at the beginning 
of October and matrix ‚ÄúS‚Äù also represents shipments from the plants 
during October, use the proper array (matrix) operations to create the 
matrix that represents the inventories at the end of October.

Matrices & Array Operations
Tutorial 2.12	 Multiply a matrix by a scalar (real number).
Each element (member, entry) within a matrix can be multiplied by one number called the scalar. This 
scalar multiplication might be useful when we want to increase (decrease) the entries within a matrix 
by the same rate‚Ä¶such as a 15% mark-up (as will be done in example 2.12b) or a 15% mark-down (as 
will be done in example 2.12c).

Tutorial 2.13	 Find the product of given matrices.
Two matrices (of any dimension R √ó C) may be multiplied if the number of columns (which run up 
and down) in the first matrix equals the number of rows (which run left to right) in the second matrix.
The two matrices presented below may be multiplied together. The order (R √ó C) of the first matrix is 3 √ó 2 
while the order (R √ó C) of the second matrix is 2 √ó 4. Since the number of columns in the first matrix 
is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix, the given matrices may be multiplied as presented.

However, if these same matrices are reversed, the order (R √ó C) of the first matrix is 2 √ó 4 while the 
order (R √ó C) of the second matrix is 3 √ó 2. Since the number of columns in the first matrix no longer 
equals the number of rows in the second matrix, the given matrices cannot be multiplied as presented.

Therefore, it is very important that we pay attention to the dimensions of the given matrices and in the 
order in which we pose a matrix multiplication problem.
When we multiply two matrices that are appropriately presented, we take the elements (members, entries) 
from the first row of the first matrix, multiply them with the respective elements (members, entries) 
from each of the columns from the second matrix and then add the products together. Notice how the 
product of the matrices from above is achieved:

NOTE:	 Since the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second 
matrix (C1 = R2), these matrices can be multiplied as presented. The product of these matrices 
will have the dimensions defined by the number of rows in the first matrix by the number of 
columns in the second matrix: R1 √ó C2
	
As shown above, the order in which the matrices appear in the problem makes a difference. 
Therefore, the Commutative Property does not apply to matrix multiplication unless the two 
matrices being multiplied are both the same size square matrices.

Notice that the given matrices in example 2.13c have been reversed to create example 2.13d. As seen in 
example 2.13e and example 2.13f, the reversal of the matrices will produce a very different answer. Since 
both of these presentations can be multiplied and matrix multiplication is not normally commutative, it 
is very important that we put the desired matrices into the proper order to achieve the desired product. 
If these matrices were derived from a real-world application, we would definitely need to pay attention 
to the order in which the matrix multiplication is presented.

Notice that whether the zero matrix comes first or second, the product is still a zero matrix with the same 
dimensions. Assuming that the presentation of matrix multiplication will allow for the multiplication 
process, multiplying by a zero matrix is an exception to the fact that matrix multiplication is not 
commutative.

Tutorial 2.15	 Complete matrix multiplication involving identity matrices.
When working with matrices, an identity matrix is a square matrix that contains the value of one (1) as 
the entries on the main diagonal and all of the other entries are zero. Two examples of identity matrices 
are shown below. Notice where the ones (1) are located.

Notice that when multiplying by an identity matrix, the product will be the matrix that is not the identity. 
If the identity matrix is second in the multiplication presentation, its dimensions must agree with the 
number of columns in the first matrix. If the identity matrix is first, then its dimensions must agree with 
the number of rows in the second matrix.

a)	 Create a matrix that is to be multiplied with the given matrix above 
so that the product of the two matrices will reflect at 15% increase in 
manufacturing, sales and shipping but a 7.5% decrease in the other 
departments (office, accounting, management).
b)	 Multiply the given matrix from above and the matrix created in part A: 
[G] √ó [A]
c)	 Create a matrix that is to be multiplied with the given matrix above 
so that the product of the two matrices will reflect at 25% increase in 
manufacturing, a 5% increase in office, a 7.5% increase in sales, a 25% 
increase in shipping, a 7.5% increase in accounting and a 5% decrease in 
management.
d)	 Multiply the given matrix from above and the matrix created in part C: 
[G] √ó [C]
answers:
a)	 The matrix that displays the given information is a 6 √ó 6 matrix. Therefore, the requested 
matrix should also be a 6 √ó 6 matrix. Since we want to display a 15% increase in the entire 
first, third and fourth columns, we should place 1.15 (100% + 15% = 115%) in these 
positions: A1,1 A3, 3 A4,4. Since we want to display a 7.5% decrease in the entire second, fifth 
and sixth columns, we should place 0.925 (100% ‚Äì 7.5% = 92.5%) in these positions: A2, 2 
A5, 5 A6, 6. The remaining positions within the requested matrix should be filled with zeroes. 
Thus, the requested matrix is:

c)	 The matrix that displays the given information is a 6 √ó 6 matrix. Therefore, the requested 
matrix should also be a 6 √ó 6 matrix. We want to display a 25% increase in the entire first 
column, a 5% increase in the entire second column, a 7.5% increase in the entire third 
column, a 25% increase in the entire fourth column, a 7.5% increase in the entire fifth 
column and a 5% decrease in the entire sixth column. Thus:
‚Ä¢ We should place 1.25 (100% + 25% = 125%) in position C1, 1.
‚Ä¢ We should place 1.05 (100% + 5% = 105%) in position C2, 2.
‚Ä¢ We should place 1.075 (100% + 7.5% = 107.5%) in position C3, 3.
‚Ä¢ We should place 1.25 (100% + 25% = 125%) in position C4, 4.
‚Ä¢ We should place 1.075 (100% + 7.5% = 107.5%) in position C5, 5.
‚Ä¢ We should place 0.95 (100% ‚Äì5% = 95%) in position C6, 6.
The remaining positions within the requested matrix should be filled with zeroes.

Matrices & Array Operations
Tutorial 2.17	 Write the augmented matrix for a system of equations.
We can use the Gauss-Jordan Row Operations method to solve systems of equations by:
1.	 Rewriting the given system into an augmented matrix.
2.	 Perform one or more of these row operations‚Ä¶
a)	 Interchange any two rows.
b)	 Add a multiple of one row to another.
c)	 Multiply a row by a non-zero constant.
3.	 Use the reduced matrix to determine the solutions for the given system.
Let‚Äôs look at the very first step of the Gauss-Jordan Row Operations method‚Ä¶
An augmented matrix removes the variables from a given system and then displays the coefficients 
(those number that were multiplied with the variables) to the left of a vertical line while the constants 
that were to the right of the equals signs to the right of the vertical line. Any coefficients that are being 
multiplied are thought of as negatives numbers. If a variable is missing from an equation, its coefficient 
should be thought of as zero.
Write the augmented matrices for:

3.	 Use the reduced matrix to determine the solutions for the given system.
Once the Gauss-Jordan row operations have successfully been applied, an identity matrix will appear 
to the right of the vertical line while the solutions appear to the left of the vertical line. The first row 
provides the solution for the first variable, the second row provides the solution for the second variable, 
the third row provides the solution for the third variable, and so on.

Matrices & Array Operations
Tutorial 2.19	 Use matrices to solve systems with unique solutions.
We can use the Gauss-Jordan Row Operations method to solve systems of equations by:
1.	 Rewriting the given system into an augmented matrix.
2.	 Perform one or more of these row operations‚Ä¶
a)	 Interchange (swap) any two rows.
b)	 Multiply a row by a non-zero constant (any positive or negative rational number).
c)	 Multiply any row by a non-zero constant and then add the row to another row.
3.	 Use the reduced matrix to determine the solutions for the given system.
Remember that the goal of this process is to transform an augmented matrix into a ‚Äúreduced matrix‚Äù 
that displays an identity matrix to the left of the vertical line and the proper solutions of the system to 
the right.

Tutorial 2.20	 Use matrices to solve systems with non-unique solutions.
We would hope that every system that we encounter has a unique solution. However, that is not always 
the case. When solving a system of equations, there are actually 3 different outcomes that might happen. 
We can distinguish these outcomes by looking at their possible ‚Äúreduced matrix‚Äù:
unique solution:
no solution:
general solution:

1x + 0y + 0z = 400 ‚Üí x = 400
0x + 1y + 0z = 500 ‚Üí y = 500
0x + 0y + 1z = 500 ‚Üí z = 600
1x + 0y + 0z = 300 ‚Üí x = 300
0x + 1y + 0z = 400 ‚Üí y = 400
0x + 0y + 0z = 500 ‚Üí impossible
1x + 0y + 2z = 5 ‚Üí x = 5 ‚Äì 2z
0x + 1y ‚Äì 3z = 7 ‚Üí y = 7 + 3z
0x + 0y + 0z = 0 ‚Üí z = any real #
When we have a unique solution, there will be an identity matrix to the left of the vertical line and we 
can read the solution values directly from the reduced matrix.
When we have a ‚Äúno solution‚Äù situation, the bottom row will be an impossible feat. In the display above, 
the third row reads: 0x + 0y + 0z = 500. There are no numbers that can replace the variables so that their 
combination will equal 500. This is a definite indication that there is no solution for the given system.
When we have a ‚Äúgeneral solution‚Äù situation, the bottom row will contain all zeroes. In the display 
above, the third row reads: 0x + 0y + 0z = 0‚Ä¶which will be true for any number that we use to replace 
the variables. This is a definite indication that there will be a general solution for the given system. It is 
normally expected that the last variable (in this case z) will be considered any real number‚Ä¶then, the 
other variables will be expressed in terms of this last variable. So for the third display above, x = 5 ‚Äì 2z 
and y = 7 + 3z when z is any real number that is applicable for the system.
So, we attempt to complete the Gauss-Jordan Row Operations as we normally would:
1.	 Rewrite the given system into an augmented matrix.
2.	 Perform one or more of the permissible row operations.
3.	 Use the reduced matrix to determine the solutions for the given system.
It is not until we get close to the reduced matrix that we can then determine what type of solution we 
will actually have for the given system.

The goal of this process is to transform an augmented matrix into a ‚Äúreduced matrix‚Äù that displays an 
identity matrix to the left of the vertical line and the proper solutions of the system to the right. We 
will not be able to determine the actual type of solutions until we have attempted to achieve the desired 
‚Äúreduced matrix‚Äù.

The next step for this example would be to get a 1 into the R3C3 position‚Ä¶BUT, this is impossible to do

Tutorial 2.21	 Find the inverse of a 2 √ó 2 square matrix.
If the product of two given matrices results in the identity matrix, then the two given matrices are 
‚Äúinverses‚Äù of each other. And conversely, if two matrices are ‚Äúinverses‚Äù of one another, their product 
will be an identity matrix. Therefore: [A] √ó [A‚Äì1] = identity matrix. The symbol A‚Äì1 is the symbol for 
the inverse matrix of A.

The denominator of the fraction above is called the determinant because its value will determine whether 
there actually is an inverse. If the determinant (ad ‚Äì bc) equals zero, there will be no inverse for the 
given matrix.

Tutorial 2.22	 Use 2 √ó 2 inverse matrices to solve systems of equations.
Any system of equations may be rewritten as a matrix equation where the coefficient matrix is multiplied 
by the variable matrix to obtain the constant matrix. The matrix equation can then be solved by multiplying 
the constant matrix by the inverse of the coefficient matrix. Notice that the inverse matrix must appear 
before the constant matrix in the proper matrix multiplication problem.

NOTE:	 The desired matrix inverse may contain fractions. Remember that when we add or subtract 
fractions, we need common denominators. So, it is a good idea not to simplify the fractions 
within the inverse before we use the inverse in a matrix multiplication.
NOTE:	 If a system does not have an inverse, it does not have a unique solution. However, it may have a 
general solution or no solution at all. Completing proper row operations will determine which 
of these alternatives is the better choice.

Tutorial 2.23	 Use row operations to find the inverse of a square matrix.
To find the inverse of any N √ó N matrix, we can transform an augmented matrix using ‚Äúrow operations‚Äù 
where the original matrix (on the left of the vertical line) is converted into an identity matrix. The 
resulting ‚Äúinverse‚Äù will now be displayed to the right of the vertical line within the transformed matrix.

Since the first three columns of the third row contain zeroes, there is no way to create the desired 3 √ó 3 
identity matrix. Thus, there is no inverse for the given matrix for this example.
NOTE:	 When the coefficient matrix for any system does not have an inverse, it does not have a unique 
solution. Whether the system will have no solution or a general solution will depend on the 
completion of the proper row operations needed to solve the system.

Tutorial 2.25	 Use matrix inverses to solve real-world applications.
Just as we solved real-world applications using 2 √ó 2 systems, we may also need to solve a real-world 
application that involves larger N √ó N systems‚Ä¶
example 2.25a	 A woman who has $270,000 to invest would like to have an annual income of 
$33,000 from her investments. One safe investment pays 10% per year while a riskier 
investment pays 15% per year. How much should she invest in each of these accounts?
Just as we have done in the past, we need to translate the given information into equations that can be 
solved as a system. First thing to do is to select variables to be used during the solution of the problem:
x = investment at 10% rate	
y = investment at 15% rate
Then, we need to translate sentences into equations: 
total investment amount ‚Üí x + y = 270,000
annual income desired ‚Üí 0.10x + 0.15y = 33,000
We then need to rewrite the system as a matrix equation:

Tutorial 2.26	 Use a computer spreadsheet to determine the number of rows and 
columns contained in a matrix and thereby determine the order of the 
matrix.
A computer spreadsheet is a series of small blocks (cells) where the columns are labeled with capital 
letters and the rows are labeled by numbers. To enter a matrix into Microsoft Excel, simply type each 
matrix element into its own small block (cell).

For example, suppose we want to determine the number of rows and columns contained in the matrix 
at the right. First thing we would need to do is to enter the data entries onto a computer spreadsheet 
(see the partial screen shot) by typing 1 into cell A1, by typing 2 into cell B1, by typing 3 into cell C1, 
by typing 4 into cell D1, by typing 5 in cell A2, by typing 6 in cell B2, by typing 7 in cell C2, by typing 
8 in cell D2, by typing 9 in cell A3, by typing 10 in cell B3, by typing 11 in cell C3, by typing 12 in cell 
D3, by typing 13 in cell A4, by typing 14 in cell B4, by typing 15 in cell C4, by typing 16 in cell D4, by 
typing 17 in cell A5, by typing 18 in cell B5, by typing 19 in cell C5, by typing 20 in cell D5.
To use the computer spreadsheet to determine the number of rows and the number of columns contained 
in this matrix, highlight all of the entries (as was done on the partial screen shot at the right) with a 
computer mouse.
While holding down the left button on the mouse, notice that the computer displays the desired 
information (as is indicated by the red oval). Therefore, this matrix has 5 rows and 4 columns‚Ä¶making 
its order (dimensions): 5 √ó 4.

columns and the given columns for rows. So, if the given matrix as an order of R √ó C then its transpose 
will have an order of C √ó R.)

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet‚Äôs 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF‚Äôs innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world‚Äôs wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Enter the data from each of the given matrices. Highlight another section of the worksheet that has the 
dimensions of the product for these matrices‚Ä¶for this example (as can be seen in the partial screen shot 
below on the left) that is a 5 √ó 3 section. (Recall that when multiplying matrices, the number of columns 
in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix and that the product of these 
matrices will then have the dimensions defined by the number of rows in the first matrix by the number 
of columns in the second matrix: R1 √ó C2. For this example, the order of the first matrix is 5 √ó 4 while 
the order of the second matrix is 4 √ó 3‚Ä¶which makes the product of these two arrays a 5 √ó 3 matrix.)
While the 5 √ó 3 section is still highlighted, type this array (matrix) formula (which will appear in the 
formula bar): =MMULT(A1:D5, F1:H4). Since this is an array (matrix) formula, we will need to do 
the special CRTL+SHIFT+ENTER key-stroke combination to enter the desired formula. (Braces will 
surround the formula indicating that it is an array formula.) As we can see from the partial screen shot 
above on the right, the cells have been filled with the data produced by multiplying the given matrices.
NOTE:	 Recall that multiplication of matrices is NOT commutative. So, if we reversed the two matrices, 
we would be attempting to multiply a 4 √ó 3 matrix by a 5 √ó 4 matrix. Since the two middle 
numbers do not match, the multiplication cannot be completed.

Recall that the goal of the Gauss-Jordan row operations method is to convert all but the last column 
into an N√óN identity matrix so that the solutions for the given system will appear in the last column. 
For this example, we need a 3 √ó 3 identity matrix and the solutions will appear in the fourth column.

Recall that the goal of the first step in the Gauss-Jordan process is to get a 1 in the R1C1 position (cell 
D2 in the partial screen shot at the right) of the desired identity matrix. Since we already have that step 
accomplished, we then need to convert the other entries in C1 (cells D3 and D4) into zeroes:
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D6 and type: =D2‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from cells D6 to G6.
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D7 and type: =D3-2*D2‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from cells D7 to G7.
‚Ä¢ Click into dell D8 and type: =D4‚Äì3*D2‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from cells D8 to G8.
We now have the first column of the desired identity matrix completed. The next step is to get a 1 into 
the R2C2 position (cell E7 in the partial screen shot above to the right). Since the non-zero entries of the 
third row are all multiplies of 5, it would be better to have these entries as the second row rather than 
the third. So, we can swap the last two rows around:
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D10 and type: =D6‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from D10 to G10.
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D11 and type: =D8‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from D11 to G11.
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D12 and type: =D7‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from D12 to G12.
Now that we have the rows swapped around, we still need to get a 1 in the R2C2 position of the desired 
identity matrix. So, we need to divide the entire second row by 5:
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D14 and type: =D10‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from D14 to G14.
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D15 and type: =D11/5‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from D15 to G15.
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D16 and type: =D12‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from D16 to G16.

We now have to convert the other entries in C2 (cells E14 and E16) into zeroes:
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D18 and type: =D14+3*D15‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from D18 to G18.
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D19 and type: =D15‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from D19 to G19
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D20 and type: =D16‚Äì8*D15‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from D20 to G20.
We now have the first and the second columns of the desired identity matrix completed. The next step 
is to get a 1 into the R3C3 position of the desired identity matrix. Since there is a 9 in that position (cell 
F20 in the partial screen shot on the previous page), we just need to divide the third row by 9:
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D22 and type: =D18‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from D22 to G22.
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D23 and type: =D19‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from D23 to G23.
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D24 and type: =D20/9‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from D24 to G24.
We now have to convert the other entries in C3 (cells F22 and F23) into zeroes:
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D26 and type: =D22+2*D24‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from D26 to G26.
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D27 and type: =D23+2*D24‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from D27 to G27.
‚Ä¢ Click into cell D28 and type: =D24‚Ä¶and then copy this formula from D28 to G28.
We now have the desired identity matrix completely finished. The only thing to do is now read the 
solutions to the given system:	
x = 4 (based on the entry in cell G26)
	
	
	
	
y = 2 (based on the entry in cell G27)
	
	
	
	
z = 3 (based on the entry in cell G28).
NOTE:	 This process can be duplicated using any sized system. The only difference will be the number 
of rows and columns that will be handled based on the size of the system.

While this 3 √ó 3 section is still highlighted, type this array (matrix) formula (which will appear in the

and type: =MDETERM(A1:C3). Although this is an array (matrix) formula, only one value will be  
displayed‚Ä¶so, we can just press ENTER rather than the special CRTL+SHIFT+ENTER key-stroke 
combination used for other array (matrix) formulas. As can be seen in the partial screen shot below to

Then, we need to highlight another section of the worksheet that will contain the inverse of the 
coefficient matrix. For this example, we would need to highlight a 3 √ó 3 section (cells G2 to I4 in 
the partial screen shot above to the left). While the section is highlighted, type this array (matrix) 
formula: =MINVERSE(A2:C4). Since this is an array (matrix) formula, we will need to do the special 
CRTL+SHIFT+ENTER key-stroke combination to enter the desired formula. (Braces will surround the 
formula indicating that it is an array formula.) As can be seen in the partial screen shot above to the 
right, cells G2 to I4 now contain the inverse matrix for the coefficient matrix.
Now all we need to do is multiply the inverse matrix (cells G2 to I4) with the constant matrix (cells E2 
to E4) to obtain the solutions. Since the inverse is a 3 √ó 3 matrix and the constants form a 3 √ó 1 matrix, 
the product of these two matrices will be a 3 √ó 1 matrix. Highlight a 3 √ó 1 section on the worksheet (cells 
K2 to K4 in the partial screen shot to the right above) and type: =MMULT(G2:I4,E2:E4). Remember 
we need to do the CRTL+SHIFT+ENTER key-stroke combination to enter the formula. As can be seen 
in the partial screen shot to the right (above), cells K2 to K4 now contain the solutions to the given 
system:	
x = 4 (based on the entry in cell K2)
y = 2 (based on the entry in cell K3)
z = 3 (based on the entry in cell K4).
NOTE:	 It may be wise to have the computer spreadsheet find the determinant of the coefficient matrix 
before proceeding with the steps listed in this tutorial. If the determinant is zero, then there will 
be no inverse. If there is no inverse, these steps will not help in finding the desired solutions. If 
necessary, we may need to use row operations to determine whether a given system has a general 
solution or no solution at all.

Tutorial 3.1	 Find the greatest common factor of a polynomial.
First, some vocabulary‚Ä¶
‚Ä¢ A monomial is a one-termed expression. Some sample monomials are: 2x, 8a2b, ‚Äì7, and 12
‚Ä¢ A binomial is a two-termed expression joined by an addition or a subtraction sign. Some 
sample binomials are: x + y, 8a2b ‚Äì 4bc2, and 4x + 5
‚Ä¢ A trinomial is a three-termed expression joined together by addition or subtraction signs. 
Some sample trinomials are: x + y ‚Äì z, 12a3b + 4ab2 ‚Äì 8a2b3, and 5x2 + 3y ‚Äì 7
‚Ä¢ A polynomial is a multi-termed expression where the terms are joined together by addition 
or subtraction signs. The set of polynomials consist of all monomials, all binomials, all 
trinomials as well as any other expressions that might have more than three terms.
Occasionally, we might need to express polynomials in factored form. One way to factor a polynomial 
expression is to factor out its greatest common monomial factor. We can use prime factorization to 
determine the greatest common factor (GCF) of any set of numbers. All we need to do is determine 
what prime factors the given numbers share at most:
example 3.1a	
	
Find: GCF(4, 8, 12)
prime factorization: 4 = 22‚Ä¶8 = 23‚Ä¶12 = 22 √ó 31
shared at most: 22 = 4 ‚Üí GCF(4, 8, 12) = 4
example 3.1b	
	
Find: GCF(10, 40, 60)
prime factorization: 10 = 21 √ó 51‚Ä¶40 = 23 √ó 51‚Ä¶60 = 22 √ó 31 √ó 51
shared at most: 21 √ó 51 = 10 ‚Üí GCF(10, 40, 60) = 10
example 3.1c	
	
Find: GCF(10, 15, 25)
prime factorization: 10 = 21 √ó 51‚Ä¶15 = 31 √ó 51‚Ä¶25 = 52
shared at most: 51 = 5 ‚Üí GCF(10, 15, 25) = 5
NOTE:	 The greatest common factor (GCF) of any set of numbers is the one value that will divide evenly 
into all of the given numbers.

We can extend the prime factorization idea when variables and exponents are introduced into the mix. 
In fact, when variables and exponents are included, they are already in ‚Äúprime factorization‚Äù since the 
variable is a base raised to a power (exponent).
example 3.1d	 	
Find: GCF(4x4, 8x3, 12x2)
prime factorization: 4x4 = 22 √ó x4‚Ä¶8x3 = 23 √ó x3‚Ä¶12x2 = 22 √ó 3 √ó x2
shared at most: 22 √ó x2 ‚Üí GCF = 4x2
example 3.1e	
	
Find: GCF(10x5y3, 40x4y4, 60x3y5)
prime factorization	
10x5y3 = 21 √ó 51 √ó x5 √ó y3
		
	
	
40x4y4 = 23 √ó 51 √ó x4 √ó y4
		
	
	
60x3y5 = 22 √ó 31 √ó 51 √ó x3 √ó y5
shared at most: 21 √ó 51 √ó x3 √ó y3 ‚Üí GCF = 10x3y3
example 3.1f	
	
Find: GCF(‚Äì10ab, ‚Äì15a2b3, ‚Äì25a3b5)
prime factorization	
10ab = ‚Äì1 √ó 21 √ó 51 √ó a1 √ó b1
		
	
	
15a2b3 = ‚Äì1 √ó 31 √ó 51 √ó a2 √ó b3
		
	
	
25a3b5 = ‚Äì1 √ó 52 √ó a3 √ó b5

Tutorial 3.2	 Factor a polynomial expression by grouping.
Extending the idea of factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF) from a given polynomial, we 
can establish another method of factoring‚Ä¶that of ‚Äúgrouping‚Äù. Sometimes all of the terms in the given 
polynomial to be factored may not have one common factor‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶some of them may. Therefore, we 
can ‚Äúgroup‚Äù the terms into smaller sets and factor out the GCF from them.
example 3.2a	
	
Factor by grouping: 5b2 ‚Äì 20b ‚Äì a3b + 4a3
‚Ä¢ Decide how to group given polynomial: (5b2 ‚Äì 20b) + (‚Äìa3b + 4a3)
‚Ä¢ Factor out the GCF from each group: 5b(b ‚Äì 4) ‚Äì a3(b ‚Äì 4)
‚Ä¢ Then, factor out the GCF from the two sub-groups: (b ‚Äì 4)(5b ‚Äì a3)
example 3.2b	
	
Factor by grouping: a3 ‚Äì a2 ‚Äì 6a + 6
‚Ä¢ Decide how to group given polynomial: (a3 ‚Äì a2) + (‚Äì6a + 6)
‚Ä¢ Factor out the GCF from each group: a2(a ‚Äì 1) ‚Äì 6(a ‚Äì 1)
‚Ä¢ Then, factor out the GCF from the two sub-groups: (a ‚Äì 1)(a2 ‚Äì 6)
example 3.2c	
	
Factor by grouping: 10x ‚Äì 10y + 7bx ‚Äì 7by
‚Ä¢ Decide how to group given polynomial: (10x ‚Äì 10y) + (7bx ‚Äì 7by)
‚Ä¢ Factor out the GCF from each group: 10(x ‚Äì y) + 7b(x ‚Äì y)
‚Ä¢ Then, factor out the GCF from the two sub-groups: (x ‚Äì y)(10 + 7b)
example 3.2d	
	
Factor by grouping: 7x3 ‚Äì 21x2 + 2x ‚Äì 6
‚Ä¢ Decide how to group given polynomial: (7x3 ‚Äì 21x2) + (2x ‚Äì 6)
‚Ä¢ Factor out the GCF from each group: 7x2(x ‚Äì 3) + 2(x ‚Äì 3)
‚Ä¢ Then, factor out the GCF from the two sub-groups: (x ‚Äì 3)(7x2 + 2)
NOTE:	 If we use extended distributive property (sometimes called FOIL when multiplying two 
binomials) to multiply the first factor by the second, we will go back to the given polynomial 
that was to be factored in the first place.
NOTE:	 Although the examples above paired the given four terms, we are not restricted to that grouping. 
It is quite possible that four terms could be grouped into a trio then a single‚Ä¶or, they might be 
grouped into a single and then a trio. It all depends on how we think to group the given terms. 
However, notice that after the first greatest common factor has been factored out of the ‚Äúgroups‚Äù, 
there will be a common factor in the parentheses. If this does not happen, then the grouping 
was done incorrectly.

Tutorial 3.3	 Factor a polynomial expression (x2 + bx + c) as a product of binomials.
When we multiply one binomial by another, we do so by applying extended distributive property. 
Examining these products will aid us in reversing the process and factoring a trinomial (ax2 + bx + c).
example 3.3a	
	
Multiply: (x + 5)(x + 6)
‚Ä¢ multiplying: 	x(x + 6) = x2 + 6x + 30
multipl	 	
5(x + 6) = x2 + 5x + 30
‚Ä¢ combining like-terms: x2 + [6x + 5x] + 30 = x2 + 11x + 30
example 3.3b	
	
Multiply: (x ‚Äì 5)(x ‚Äì 6)
‚Ä¢ multiplying: 	x(x ‚Äì 6) = x2 ‚Äì 6x + 30
multiplyin	
‚Äì5(x ‚Äì 6) = x2 ‚Äì 5x + 30
‚Ä¢ combining like-terms: x2 + [‚Äì6x ‚Äì 5x] + 30 = x2 ‚Äì 11x + 30
example 3.3c	
	
Multiply: (x + 5)(x ‚Äì 6)
‚Ä¢ multiplying:	 x(x ‚Äì 6) = x2 ‚Äì 6x + 30
multiplying:	
5(x ‚Äì 6) = x2 + 5x ‚Äì 30
‚Ä¢ combining like-terms: x2 + [‚Äì6x + 5x] + 30 = x2 ‚Äì 1x ‚Äì 30
example 3.3d	 	
Multiply: (x ‚Äì 5)(x + 6)
‚Ä¢ multiplying:	 x(x + 6) = x2 + 6x + 30
multiplying: 	
‚Äì5(x + 6) = x2 ‚Äì 5x ‚Äì 30+ 30
‚Ä¢ combining like-terms: x2 + [6x ‚Äì 5x] + 30 = x2 + 1x ‚Äì 30
Although we only did four specific problems, we can use them to make some observations that can be 
applied to other binomial multiplication:
‚Ä¢ When the signs within the factors are the same (whether positive or negative, as is the case 
in example 3.3a or example 3.3b), the last term in the trinomial product will be positive.
‚Ä¢ When the signs within the factors are different (as is the case in example 3.3c and example 
3.3d), the last term in the trinomial product will be negative.
‚Ä¢ No matter what signs are used within the factors, the middle term in the trinomial product 
will be the sum of the numbers (along with their respective signs) within the binomials 
being multiplied:
For 3.3a: Since +5 and +6 appear in the binomials, the middle term is: 5x + 6x = 11x
For 3.3b: Since ‚Äì5 and ‚Äì6 appear in the binomials, the middle term is: ‚Äì5x + ‚Äì6x = 11x
For 3.3c: Since +5 and ‚Äì6 appear in the binomials, the middle term is: 5x ‚Äì 6x = ‚Äì1x
For 3.3d: Since ‚Äì5 and +6 appear in the binomials, the middle term is: ‚Äì5x + 6x = +1x

Now to use the observations and product trinomials from above to reverse the process and to factor 
each trinomial into its two binomials factors‚Ä¶

Factor: x2 + 11x + 30
To factor this trinomial, we are looking for two factors of +30 that will also add 
to be +11. The only correct set of numbers that satisfy these two conditions is: 
+5 and +6. Thus, the factors of the given trinomial are: (x + 5)(x + 6)
example 3.3f	
	
Factor: x2 ‚Äì 11x + 30
To factor this trinomial, we are looking for two factors of +30 that will also add 
to be ‚Äì11. The only correct set of numbers that satisfy these two conditions is: 
‚Äì5 and ‚Äì6. Thus, the factors of the given trinomial are: (x ‚Äì 5)(x ‚Äì 6)
example 3.3g	
	
Factor: x2 ‚Äì 1x ‚Äì 30
To factor this trinomial, we are looking for two factors of ‚Äì30 that will also add 
to be ‚Äì1. The only correct set of numbers that satisfy these two conditions is: +5 
and ‚Äì6. Thus, the factors of the given trinomial are: (x + 5)(x ‚Äì 6)

Tutorial 3.4	 Factor a polynomial expression (ax2 + bx + c) as a product of 
binomials.
We can apply the grouping method of factoring to help us factor most ax2 + bx + c trinomials. Let‚Äôs look 
back at some previous examples‚Ä¶
example 3.4a	
	
Factor: x2 + 9x + 18
Since a = 1 and c = 18 in the given trinomial, we are looking for two numbers 
that multiply to be (+1)(+18) = +18 and that also add to be +9. Since the 18 
is positive, the two desired numbers will have the same sign‚Ä¶and, since the 
9 is also positive, these signs will be positive. Therefore, the desired numbers  
are: +3, +6. Regrouping the middle term of the given trinomial: x2 + 9x + 18 = 
x2 + 3x + 6x + 18. Using grouping to factor: (x2 + 3x) + (6x + 18) = x(x + 3) + 
6(x + 3) = (x + 3)(x + 6)
example 3.4b	
	
Factor: x2 ‚Äì 7x + 12
Since a = 1 and c = 12 in the given trinomial, we are looking for two numbers 
that multiply to be (+1)(+12) = +12 and that also add to be ‚Äì7. Since the 12 is 
positive, the two desired numbers will have the same sign‚Ä¶and, since the 7 is 
negative, these signs will be negative. Therefore, the desired numbers are: ‚Äì4, 
‚Äì3. Regrouping the middle term of the given trinomial: x2 ‚Äì 7x + 12 = x2 ‚Äì 4x 
‚Äì 3x + 12. Using grouping to factor: (x2 ‚Äì 4x) + (‚Äì3x + 12) = x(x ‚Äì 4) ‚Äì 3(x ‚Äì 4) 
= (x ‚Äì 4)(x ‚Äì 3)
example 3.4c	
	
Factor: x2 ‚Äì 2x ‚Äì 24
Since a = 1 and c = ‚Äì24 in the given trinomial, we are looking for two numbers 
that multiply to be (+1)(‚Äì24) = ‚Äì24 and that also add to be ‚Äì2. Since the 24 is 
negative, the two desired numbers will have different sign‚Ä¶and, since the 2 is 
also negative, the larger absolute value of these numbers will be negative while 
the smaller absolute value will be positive. Therefore, the desired numbers 
are: ‚Äì6, +4. Regrouping the middle term of the given trinomial: x2 ‚Äì 2x ‚Äì 24 = 
x2 ‚Äì 6x + 4x ‚Äì 24. Using grouping to factor: (x2 ‚Äì 6x) + (4x ‚Äì 24) = x(x ‚Äì 6) + 
4(x ‚Äì 6) = (x ‚Äì 6)(x + 4)

Since a = 1 and c = ‚Äì36 in the given trinomial, we are looking for two numbers

is negative, the two desired numbers will have different sign‚Ä¶and, since the 
5 is positive, the larger absolute value of these numbers will be positive while 
the smaller absolute value will be negative. Therefore, the desired numbers are: 
+9, ‚Äì4. Regrouping the middle term of the given trinomial: x2 + 5x ‚Äì 24 = x2

Since a = +9 and c = +8 in the given trinomial, we are looking for two numbers

is positive, the two desired numbers will have the same sign‚Ä¶and, since the 
18 is negative, these signs will be negative. Therefore, the desired numbers are:  
‚Äì12, ‚Äì6. Regrouping the middle term of the trinomial: 9x2 ‚Äì 18x + 8 = 9x2 ‚Äì 12x 
‚Äì 6x + 8. Using grouping to factor: 
(9x2 ‚Äì 12x) + (‚Äì6x + 8) = 3x(3x ‚Äì 4) ‚Äì 2(3x ‚Äì 4) = (3x ‚Äì 4)(3x ‚Äì 2)

Since a = +9 and c = ‚Äì10 in the given trinomial, we are looking for two numbers

negative, the two desired numbers will have different signs‚Ä¶and, since the 1 is 
also negative, the larger absolute value of these numbers will be negative while 
the smaller absolute value will be positive. Therefore, the desired numbers are: 
+9, ‚Äì10. Regrouping the middle term of the given trinomial: 9x2 ‚Äì 1x ‚Äì 10 = 
9x2 + 9x ‚Äì 10x ‚Äì 10. Using grouping to factor: 
(9x2 + 9x) + (‚Äì10x ‚Äì 10) = 9x(x + 1) ‚Äì 10(x + 1) = (x + 1)(9x ‚Äì 10)
example 3.4h	 	
Factor: 8x2 + 29x ‚Äì 12
Since a = +8 and c = ‚Äì12 in the given trinomial, we are looking for two numbers 
that multiply to be (+8)(‚Äì12) = ‚Äì96 and that also add to be +29. Since the 96 is 
negative, the two desired numbers will have different signs‚Ä¶and, since the 29 
is positive, the larger absolute value of these numbers will be positive while the 
smaller absolute value will be negative. Therefore, the desired numbers are: +32, 
‚Äì3. Regrouping the middle term of the given trinomial, we get: 8x2 + 29x ‚Äì 12 
= 8x2 + 32x ‚Äì 3x ‚Äì 12. Using grouping to factor:
(8x2 + 32x) + (‚Äì3x ‚Äì 12) = 8x(x + 4) ‚Äì 3(x + 4) = (x + 4)(8x ‚Äì 3)

NOTE:	 To double check the factors, we can always multiply the binomials together. The proper product 
should be the given trinomial before it was factored.
NOTE:	 When regrouping the middle term of the original trinomial, it makes no difference which of the 
two ‚Äúdesired‚Äù numbers are place first and which is placed second. The final factors should be the 
same. Remember that the commutative property works for the multiplication of polynomials.

Tutorial 3.5	 Factor ‚Äúspecial‚Äù polynomials through patterning.
Mathematicians always look for easier or quicker ways to complete tasks. Thus, some factoring tasks can 
be completed through the use of previously established patterns. If we know these patterns, we can just 
present the factors without doing too much back-up work.
When we multiply two identical binomial factors, we get a perfect square trinomial:
(a + b)2 = (a + b)(a + b) = a(a) + a(b) + b(a) + b(b) = a2 + 2ab + b2
(a ‚Äì b)2 = (a ‚Äì b)(a ‚Äì b) = a(a) ‚Äì a(b) ‚Äì b(a) ‚Äì b(‚Äìb) = a2 ‚Äì 2ab + b2
When we multiply two binomials such as (a + b)(a ‚Äì b), we get a difference of squares binomial:
(a + b)(a ‚Äì b) = a(a) + a(‚Äìb) + b(a) + b(‚Äìb) = a2 ‚Äì b2
NOTE: There is no such thing as the sum of squares binomial. 
When we multiply three identical binomial factors, we get a perfect cube trinomial:
(a + b)3 = (a + b)(a + b)(a + b)
	
(a + b) √ó [(a + b)(a + b)]
	
(a + b) √ó [a(a) + a(b) + b(a) + b(b)]
	
(a + b) √ó [a2 + 2ab + b2]
	
a(a2) + a(2ab) + a(b2) + b(a2) + b(2ab) + b(b2)
	
a3 + 2a2b + ab2 + a2b + 2ab2 + b3
	
a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3

Two other special polynomials are displayed below:
sum of cubes:
a3 + b3 = (a + b)(a2 ‚Äì ab + b2)
difference of cubes:
a3 ‚Äì b3 = (a ‚Äì b)(a2 + ab + b2)
NOTE:	 If the given binomial is a sum of cubes, then the smaller binomial factor will also be a sum and 
the middle term of the trinomial factor will be subtracted. However, if the given binomial is a 
difference of cubes, then the smaller binomial factor will also be a difference and the middle 
term of the trinomial factor will be added. 
When we attempt to factor polynomials through patterning, we should follow these guidelines:
1.	 Factor out the greatest common monomial factor (if one exists).
2.	 Determine which of the factoring patterns might apply for the given polynomial.
3.	 Factor the given polynomial using the proper pattern.
example 3.5a	
	
Factor: 9x2; ‚Äì 12x + 4
Since a = +9 and c = +4 in the given trinomial, we are looking for two numbers 
that multiply to be (+9)(+4) = +36 and that also add to be ‚Äì12. Since the 36 is 
positive, the two desired numbers will have the same sign‚Ä¶and, since the 12 
is negative, these signs will be negative. Therefore, the desired numbers are: ‚Äì6, 
‚Äì6. Since both of these numbers are identical, the given trinomial is a perfect 
square. Thus, we can use a pattern to complete this task‚Ä¶
given polynomial:
9x2
‚Äì12x
+ 4
= (a ‚Äì b)2
perfect square pattern:
a2
‚Äì2ab
+ b2
= (a ‚Äì b)2
Using the pattern:
a2 = 9x2 = (3x)2
a = 3x
‚Äì2ab = ‚Äì12x
‚Äì2(3x)b = ‚Äì12x
(‚Äì6x)b = ‚Äì12x
b = 2
b2 = 4 = (2)2
b = 2
Therefore: 9x2 ‚Äì 12x + 4 = (3x ‚Äì 2)2 = (3x ‚Äì 2)(3x ‚Äì 2)

Factor: 16x2 + 40x + 25
Since a = +16 and c = +25 in the given trinomial, we are looking for two numbers 
that multiply to be (+16)(+25) = +400 and that also add to be +40. Since the 
400 is positive, the two desired numbers will have the same sign‚Ä¶and, since the 
40 is also positive, these signs will be positive. Therefore, the desired numbers 
are: +20, +20. Since both of these numbers are identical, the given trinomial is 
a perfect square. Thus, we can use a pattern to complete this task‚Ä¶
given polynomial:
16x2
+40x
+ 25
= (a + b)2
perfect square pattern:
a2
+2ab
+ b2
= (a + b)2
Using the pattern:
a2 = 16x2 = (4x)2
a = 4x
+2ab = +40x
+2(4x)b = +40x
(+8x)b = +40x
b = 5
b2 = 25 = (5)2
b = 5
Therefore: 16x2 + 40x + 25 = (4x + 5)2 = (4x + 5)(4x + 5)

Factor: 4x2 ‚Äì 9
Since a = 4 and c = ‚Äì9 in the given trinomial, we are looking for two numbers 
that multiply to be (+4)(‚Äì9) = ‚Äì36 and that also add to be zero (since b = 0). 
Since the 36 is negative, the two desired numbers will have different signs‚Ä¶and, 
since b = 0, these two numbers will be opposites of each other. Therefore, the 
desired numbers are: ¬±6. Whenever these conditions exist, we have the difference 
of squares and we can use a pattern to complete this task‚Ä¶
given polynomial:
4x2
‚Äì 9 
= (a + b)(a ‚Äì b)
difference of squares pattern:

Using the pattern:
a2 = 4x2 = (2x)2

Therefore: 4x2 ‚Äì 9 = (2x + 3)(2x ‚Äì 3)

3(x2)b = 12x2
3b = 12
b = 4

+3(x)b2 = +48x
+3b2 = +48
b2 = 16
b = 4
b3 = 64 = (4)3
b = 4
Therefore: x3 ‚Äì 12x2 + 48x ‚Äì 64 = (x ‚Äì 4)3 = (x ‚Äì 4)(x ‚Äì 4)(x ‚Äì 4)

Tutorial 3.6	 Use factoring to complete business applications.
On occasion, various business applications may involve the use of polynomial factoring in order to 
complete a desired task‚Ä¶
example 3.6a	
	
The revenue (R) from the sale of x units of a product or commodity is found by 
multiplying the price by the number of items sold: R = (price)(units). Suppose 
that the revenue of a certain product is given by the algebraic expression of: 
R = 500x ‚Äì x2. If x is the number of units sold, what is the expression for the 
price of this item?
answer: We need to factor out the greatest common factor from the algebraic 
binomial that appears to the right of the equals sign: R = 500x ‚Äì x2 = x(500 ‚Äì x). 
If x is the number of units sold, then 500 ‚Äì x represents the price of the item.

Suppose that the revenue (R) for a boat tour is: R = 1050 ‚Äì 20x ‚Äì 0.5x2, 
where x is the number of passengers above the minimum of 50. The revenue 
expression can be factored into two binomials where one of the binomials 
represents the total number of passengers and the other represents the cost 
of the boat tour. Express the revenue formula in its factored form.
answer: We first need to factor out the greatest common factor from the algebraic 
expression that appears to the right of the equals sign: 
R = 1050 ‚Äì 20x ‚Äì 0.5x2 = (‚Äì0.5)(x2 + 40x ‚Äì 2100)
We then need to factor the resulting trinomial into its two binomials by obtaining 
two numbers that multiply to be ‚Äì2100 and also add to be +40: 70, ‚Äì30. Now 
we just need to complete the factoring through ‚Äúgrouping‚Äù:
x2 + 40x ‚Äì 2100 = x2 + 70x ‚Äì 30x ‚Äì 2100
	 	
	
= (x2 + 70x) + (‚Äì30x ‚Äì 2100)
	 	
	
= x(x + 70) ‚Äì 30(x + 70)
	 	
	
= (x + 70)(x ‚Äì 30)
Putting the GCF back into the mix: (‚Äì0.5)(x2 + 40x ‚Äì 2100) = (‚Äì0.5)(x + 70)
(x ‚Äì 30). So, the final binomial factors are: (‚Äì0.5x ‚Äì 35)(x ‚Äì 30) or (x + 70)
(‚Äì0.5x + 15)
example 3.6c	
	
The consumer (C) expenditure (in dollars) for a commodity is the product of 
its market price (p) and the number of units demanded. Suppose that for a 
certain commodity, the consumer expenditure is given by: C = 9600p ‚Äì 150p2. 
Factor this given expression in order to find an expression for the number 
of units demanded.
answer: We need to factor out the p from the algebraic binomial that appears 
to the right of the equals sign: C = 9600p ‚Äì 150p2 = p(9600 ‚Äì 150p). Then, the 
p represents the price while the 9600 ‚Äì 150p represents the number of units 
demanded.

Tutorial 3.7	 Solve quadratic equations by factoring.
Just as we solved linear equations (standard form: Ax + By = C; slope-intercept form: y = mx + b) to 
complete some business applications, we may also need to solve quadratic equations (ax2 + bx + c = 0) 
to complete other such applications.
One way to solve quadratic equations is through factoring and the application of: 
Zero Product Property: The product of any two real numbers will equal zero if either 
or both of these numbers is equal to zero. Expressed differently, if (a)(b) = 0, then  
a = 0 (alone), b = 0 (alone), or both a and b equal zero.

Solve by factoring: 16x2 ‚Äì 25 = 0
1.	 Set the quadratic equation to zero. (This step is already completed.)

16x2 ‚Äì 25 = (4x)2 ‚Äì (5)2 = (4x + 5)(4x ‚Äì 5)
3.	 Set each factor equal to zero and solve each ‚Äúmini-equation‚Äù:
4x + 5 = 0 ‚Üí 4x = ‚Äì5 ‚Üí x = ‚Äì5/4 = ‚Äì1.25
4x ‚Äì 5 = 0 ‚Üí 4x = +5 ‚Üí x = +5/4 = +1.25
4.	 Determine the solutions for the given quadratic: x = ¬±5/4 = ¬± 1.25
example 3.7b	
	
Solve by factoring: x2 ‚Äì 4x = 5x2
1.	 Set the quadratic equation to zero:

2.	 Factor: 4x2 + 4x ‚Üí Factor out the greatest common factor: 4x(x + 1)
3.	 Set each factor equal to zero and solve each ‚Äúmini-equation‚Äù:

Tutorial 3.8	 Solve quadratic equations by completing the square.
Another way to solve quadratic equations is through a method called ‚Äúcompleting the square‚Äù which 
follows these steps:
1.	 Add/Subtract the constant from both sides of the equation.
2.	 Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the quadratic (x2) term‚Ä¶simplifying 
wherever possible.
3.	 Divide the coefficient of the linear (x) term by two (2) and square the quotient. Add this 
result to both sides of the equation‚Ä¶simplifying wherever possible.
4.	 Factor the trinomial on the left side of the equation into its (a ¬± b)2 form.
5.	 Take a square root of each side of the equation. 
6.	 Solve for x‚Ä¶simplifying wherever possible. Normally, there will be two solutions so we will 
need to solve two ‚Äúmini-equations‚Äù for x.
example 3.8a	
	
Solve by completing the square: x2 ‚Äì 14x = 72
1.	 This step has already been accomplished in the given example.
2.	 No need to complete this step since the coefficient of ax2 is one (1).
3.	 14 √∑ 2 = 7 ‚Üí 72 = 49 ‚Üí x2 ‚Äì 14x + 49 = 72 + 49 ‚Üí x2 ‚Äì 14x + 49 = 121
4.	 x2 ‚Äì 14x + 49 = (x ‚Äì 7)2
5.	 (x ‚Äì 7)2 = 121 ‚Üí ¬± 121  = ¬±11 ‚Üí x ‚Äì 7 = ¬±11
6.	 Solve each ‚Äúmini-equation‚Äù:
x ‚Äì 7 = ‚Äì11 ‚Üí x = ‚Äì11 + 7 = ‚Äì4
x ‚Äì 7 = +11 ‚Üí x = +11 + 7 = +18
Therefore, the solutions to this quadratic equation are: x = ‚Äì4, x = 18
example 3.8b	
	
Solve by completing the square: x2 + 16x = ‚Äì60
1.	 This step has already been accomplished in the given example.
2.	 No need to complete this step since the coefficient of ax2 is one (1).
3.	 16 √∑ 2 = 8 ‚Üí 82 = 64 ‚Üí x2 + 16x + 64 = ‚Äì60 + 64 ‚Üí x2 + 16x + 64 = 4
4.	 x2 + 16x + 64 = (x + 8)2
5.	 (x + 8)2 = 4 ‚Üí ¬±
4  = ¬±2 ‚Üí x + 8 = ¬±2
6.	 Solve each ‚Äúmini-equation‚Äù:
x + 8 = ‚Äì2 ‚Üí x = ‚Äì2 ‚Äì 8 = ‚Äì10
x + 8 = +2 ‚Üí x = +2 ‚Äì 8 = ‚Äì6
Therefore, the solutions to this quadratic equation are: x = ‚Äì10, x = ‚Äì6

Tutorial 3.11	 Determine the number and the nature of the solutions for a quadratic 
equation.
Occasionally, it will be useful to know the number and the nature of the solutions for a given quadratic 
equation. This information can be derived from part of the quadratic formula‚Ä¶specifically, the 
discriminant: b2 ‚Äì 4ac (the part of the formula that appears beneath the square root sign:
Given ax2 + bx + c = 0 (where a ‚â† 0),
‚Ä¢ If b2 ‚Äì 4ac > 0, the equation has 2 distinct real solutions.
‚Ä¢ If b2 ‚Äì 4ac = 0, the equation has exactly 1 real solution.
‚Ä¢ If b2 ‚Äì 4ac < 0, the equation has no real solutions.
example 3.11a	 	
Determine the number and nature of the solutions of: 3x2 + 4 = 8x
1.	 Set the given quadratic equation to zero: 3x2 ‚Äì 8x + 4 = 0
2.	 Identify the values of a, b and c: a = 3, b = ‚Äì8, c = 4
3.	 Substitute the values for a, b and c into the discriminant and evaluate the 
numeric expression: b2 ‚Äì 4ac = (‚Äì8)2 ‚Äì 4(3)(4) = 64 ‚Äì 48 = 16
4.	 Use the value of the discriminant to determine the number and nature 
of the solutions for the given equation: b2 ‚Äì 4ac = 16 ‚Üí 16 > 0 ‚Üí this 
equation will have 2 distinct real solutions. NOTE: Look back at example 
3.10d, the actually solutions are: x = 2/3, x = 2.
example 3.11b	 	
Determine the number and nature of the solutions of: 4x2 + 25 = 20x
1.	 Set the given quadratic equation to zero: 4x2 ‚Äì 20x + 25 = 0
2.	 Identify the values of a, b and c: a = 4, b = ‚Äì20, c = 25
3.	 Substitute the values for a, b and c into the discriminant and evaluate the 
numeric expression: b2 ‚Äì 4ac = (‚Äì20)2 ‚Äì 4(4)(25) = 400 ‚Äì 400 = 0
4.	 Use the value of the discriminant to determine the number and nature of 
the solutions for the given equation: b2 ‚Äì 4ac = 0 ‚Üí 0 = 0 ‚Üí this equation 
will have 1 distinct real solution. NOTE: Solving this quadratic equation 
by factoring, we can see that the quadratic trinomial is a perfect square 
which can be factored in identical binomials: 4x2 ‚Äì 20x + 25 = (2x ‚Äì 5)2‚Ä¶
which will have one double root solution of 5/2 (or 2.5).
example 3.11c	 	
Determine the number and nature of the solutions of: x2 + 12 = 5x
1.	 Set the given quadratic equation to zero: x2 ‚Äì 5x + 12 = 0
2.	 Identify the values of a, b and c: a = 1, b = ‚Äì5, c = 12

3.	 Substitute the values for a, b and c into the discriminant and evaluate the 
numeric expression: b2 ‚Äì 4ac = (‚Äì5)2 ‚Äì 4(1)(12) = 25 ‚Äì 48 = ‚Äì13
4.	 Use the value of the discriminant to determine the number and nature 
of the solutions for the given equation: b2 ‚Äì 4ac = ‚Äì13 ‚Üí ‚Äì13 < 0 ‚Üí this 
equation will have no real solutions.
There will be times when the discriminant is a perfect square‚Ä¶and, thus the solutions will be rational 
numbers ‚Äì meaning that the solutions can be expressed as fractions, decimals, or integers. However, there 
will also be times when the discriminant is a not perfect square‚Ä¶and, these solutions will be irrational 
numbers ‚Äì meaning that the solutions can be expressed using a square root (radical) sign or will have 
to be rounded to a situation-appropriate place value.
example 3.11d	 	
Determine the number/nature of the solutions and then solve: 2x2 ‚Äì 15 = x
1.	 Set the given quadratic equation to zero: 2x2 ‚Äì x ‚Äì 15 = 0
2.	 Identify the values of a, b and c: a = 2, b = ‚Äì1, c = ‚Äì15
3.	 Substitute the values for a, b and c into the discriminant and evaluate the 
numeric expression: b2 ‚Äì 4ac = (‚Äì1)2 ‚Äì 4(2)(‚Äì15) = 1 + 120 = 121
4.	 Use the value of the discriminant to determine the number and nature 
of the solutions for the given equation: b2 ‚Äì 4ac = 121 ‚Üí 121 > 0 ‚Üí this 
equation will have 2 distinct real solutions.

Tutorial 3.12	 Solve business applications involving quadratic functions.
There may be times when solving a quadratic equation will be needed to solve real-world business 
applications. In most of these cases, using the quadratic formula will be the way to go‚Ä¶the only other 
decision will be whether to use ‚Äúpaper & pencil‚Äù or a spreadsheet to complete the computation.
example 3.12a	 	
Suppose the profit from the sale of x units of a product is: P = 90x ‚Äì 200 ‚Äì x2
What level(s) of production will yield a profit of $1600?
‚Äúpaper & pencil‚Äù solution:
1.	 Replace P with its given value (P = 1600): 1600 = 90x ‚Äì 200 ‚Äì x2
2.	 Set the equation to zero: 0 = 90x ‚Äì 200 ‚Äì 1600 ‚Äì x2 = ‚Äìx2 + 90x ‚Äì 1800
3.	 Identify the values of a, b and c: a = ‚Äì1, b = 90, c = ‚Äì1800
4.	 Use the quadratic formula to determine the solutions:

Based on these solutions, there will be two levels that will yield a profit of $1600, when x = 30 
units or when x = 60 units. 
spreadsheet solution:
1.	 Replace P with its given value (P = 1600): 1600 = 90x ‚Äì 200 ‚Äì x2
2.	 Set the equation to zero: 0 = 90x ‚Äì 200 ‚Äì 1600 ‚Äì x2 = ‚Äìx2 + 90x ‚Äì 1800
3.	 Identify the values of a, b and c: a = ‚Äì1, b = 90, c = ‚Äì1800
4.	 Use a spreadsheet to aid in the calculation of the quadratic formula:
a)	 Enter the values for a, b and c onto to spreadsheet.
(These values have been entered into cells B2, C2 and D2 in the partial screen-shot.)

b)	 Determine the value of the discriminant by typing: =C2^2‚Äì4*B2*D2.
(This formula was entered into cell B4 in the partial screen-shot.)
c)	 Determine the value of the first solution by typing: =(‚Äì1*C2+SQRT(B4))/(2*B2).
(This formula was entered into cell B7 in the partial screen-shot.)
d)	 Determine the value of the second solution by typing: =(‚Äì1*C2‚ÄìSQRT(B4))/(2*B2).
(This formula was entered into cell B10 in the partial screen-shot.)
The only difference between arriving at these solutions is that the spreadsheet can be saved to be used 
for another problem while the ‚Äúpaper & pencil‚Äù method must be repeated.
example 3.12b	 	
Suppose the profit from the sale of x units of a product is: P = 16x ‚Äì 100 ‚Äì 0.1x2
What level(s) of production will yield a profit of $500?
‚Äúpaper & pencil‚Äù solution:
1.	 Replace P with its given value (P = 500): 500 = 16x ‚Äì 100 ‚Äì 0.1x2
2.	 Set the equation to zero: 0 = 16x ‚Äì 100 ‚Äì 500 ‚Äì 0.1x2 = ‚Äì0.1x2 + 16x ‚Äì 600
3.	 Identify the values of a, b and c: a = ‚Äì0.1, b = 16, c = ‚Äì600

Tutorial 3.13	 For any quadratic function:
a)	 Determine whether its graph opens up or down.
b)	 Determine whether its vertex is a minimum or maximum point.
c)	 Determine its zeroes (horizontal intercepts).
d)	 Define its axis of symmetry.
e)	 Determine the coordinates of its vertex.
f)	 Sketch its graph.
The graph of any quadratic function will be a parabola ‚Äì a U-shaped curved that can open up or down ‚Äì 
depending on the value of the coefficient (a) of the quadratic (ax2) term:
If a > 0, the parabola will open upward.
If a < 0, the parabola will open downward.

The point at which the curve changes direction is called the vertex of the parabola. This vertex will either 
be the optimal minimum point or the optimal maximum point of the quadratic function ‚Äì depending 
on the value of the coefficient (a) of the quadratic (ax2) term:
If a > 0, the vertex will be a minimum point.
If a < 0, the vertex will be a maximum point.

Another way to determine whether the vertex is the optimal minimum point or the optimal maximum 
point is to determine whether the parabola will open upward or downward:
‚Ä¢ If the parabola opens upward, then the vertex will be the optimal minimum point.
‚Ä¢ If the parabola opens downward, then the vertex will be the optimal maximum point.

The parabola for any given quadratic function will be symmetrical to its axis of symmetry which is a 
vertical line that runs through the vertex. Other than the vertex, all of the other points on the parabola 
will be equidistant from its axis of symmetry.

For each of the parabolas displayed above, notice that:
‚Ä¢ The zeroes are equidistant (the same distance) from the axis of symmetry. For y = x2 ‚Äì 8x + 
12 (on the left), the distance between (2, 0) and (6, 0) is 4 units‚Ä¶with the axis of symmetry 
2 units from each of these points. For y = ‚Äì1x2 + 10x ‚Äì 16 (on the right), the distance 
between (2, 0) and (8, 0) is 6 units‚Ä¶with the axis of symmetry 3 units from each of these 
points.

‚Ä¢ The y-intercept has a ‚Äúpartner point‚Äù that is the same distance from the axis of symmetry 
as it is. For y = x2 ‚Äì 8x + 12 (on the left), point (0, 12) is 4 units to the left of the axis of 
symmetry. Therefore, there is a ‚Äúpartner point‚Äù that is 4 units to the right of the axis of 
symmetry‚Ä¶namely, (8, 12). For y = ‚Äì1x2 + 10x ‚Äì 16 (on the right), point (0, ‚Äì16) is 5 units 
to the left of the axis of symmetry. Therefore, there is a ‚Äúpartner point‚Äù that is 5 units to the 
right of the axis of symmetry‚Ä¶namely, (10, ‚Äì16).
The zeroes of the parabola are nothing more than the solutions for the equation that was used to produce 
the parabola. Therefore, all we need to do is solve the given quadratic equation to determine the zeroes 
for the given function. Using the quadratic formula, we can determine a general formula to find the 
axis of symmetry of any given quadratic function. We can also use the quadratic formula to determine a 
general formula to find the vertex of any given quadratic function. Since the axis of symmetry ‚Äúdivides‚Äù 
the parabola into two equal parts, the zeroes of the parabola are equidistant from each other‚Ä¶with the 
axis of symmetry running between these points. Therefore, the x-value for the axis of symmetry is the 
average between the x-values of the zeroes.
By completing just two steps, we can generate a general formula to determine the axis of symmetry and 
vertex for any parabola:

Tutorial 3.14	 Use quadratic functions to find market equilibrium.
Market equilibrium is when the supply function equals the demand function: S(x) = D(x). Recall that 
when we first worked with this concept, we completed a system of equations. We will do the same thing 
even though we may be working with one or two quadratic functions.
example 3.14a	 	
The supply function for a commodity is: S(x) = x2 + 600
	
	
	
The demand function for this same commodity is: D(x) = 3000 ‚Äì 20x
a)	 Use this graph to find the point of market equilibrium for this 
commodity.
b)	 Use algebraic means to find the point of market equilibrium.

S(x) = x2 + 600 = (40)2 + 600 = 1600 + 600 = 2200
D(x) = 3000 ‚Äì 20x = 3000 ‚Äì 20(40) = 3000 ‚Äì 800 = 2200

NOTE: Since this is a business application, negatives cannot be used. Therefore, the ‚Äì10.5 is an 
extraneous solution and must be thrown out. That means that 10 is the only possible 
value for x.
‚Ä¢ Using x = 10, evaluate S(x) or D(x):
S(x) = x2 + 8x + 16 = (10)2 + 8(10) + 16 = 100 + 80 + 16 = 196
D(x) = 436 + 6x ‚Äì 3x2 = 436 + 6(10) ‚Äì 3(10)2 = 436 + 60 ‚Äì 300 = 196
‚Ä¢ Therefore, the point of market equilibrium occurs at (10, 196)‚Ä¶which means that 10 units 
of the commodity are sold at $196 per unit.

Quadratic & Other Special Functions
Tutorial 3.15	 Use quadratic functions to find break-even point(s).
The break-even points occur when the cost function equals the revenue function: C(x) = R(x). Recall 
that when we first worked with this concept, we completed a system of equations. We will do the same 
thing even though we may be working with one or two quadratic functions.
example 3.15a	 	
The total cost per week of producing a certain product is: C(x) = 600 + 80x
The total revenue per week for this same product is: R(x) = 150x ‚Äì x2 
a)	 Use this graph to find the break-even points for this commodity.
b)	 Use algebraic means to find the break-even points for this 
commodity.
c)	 Write the profit function for this commodity.
d)	 What are the zeroes of this profit function?
e)	 Compare the zeroes of the profit function with the break-even 
points (established in parts A-B) for this commodity.

answers:
a)	 The break-even points occur when: C(x) = R(x). As displayed by the graph provided, there 
are two break-even points: (10, 1400) and (60, 5400). NOTE: The area between these two 
points is where any possible profits will occur.
b)	 C(x) = R(x) ‚Üí 600 + 80x = 150x ‚Äì x2
‚Ä¢ Set the equation to zero: x2 ‚Äì 70x + 600 = 0

Tutorial 3.16	 Maximize quadratic revenue and/or profit functions. 
Minimize quadratic cost functions.
Businesses will often be interested in maximizing their revenue and/or profit while attempting to minimize 
any business costs. When we worked with linear functions, we determined the minimum or maximum 
values through linear programming. However, when working with quadratic functions, we will need to 
work with the vertex of the appropriate parabolas for the given functions.
Recall that:
‚Ä¢ The vertex of a parabola will be a minimum point when a > 0 or the parabola opens 
upward.
‚Ä¢ The vertex of a parabola will be a maximum point when a < 0 or the parabola opens 
downward.
‚Ä¢ The coordinates of the vertex of a parabola can be determined by:

Tutorial 3.17	 Use quadratic functions to solve real-world applications.
Although it may not be initially obvious, we can use the concept of quadratics and maximization to solve 
other real-world applications. As long as the situation can be described by a quadratic function, we can 
use the vertex coordinates to help answer many maximization problems.
example 3.17a	 	
Suppose that tickets for a high school concert cost $4 each and that 800 
people are expected to attend the concert. However, for each 25¬¢ increase 
in the ticket price attendance will decrease by 20 people.
a)	 What quadratic function is appropriate for this situation?
b)	 What ticket price will yield the maximum income?
c)	 How many people should attend to achieve this maximum income?
d)	 What is the maximum income for this concert?
answers:
a)	 F(x) = (ticket price)(people) = (4 + 0.25x)(800 ‚Äì 20x) ‚Üí F(x) = 3200 + 120x ‚Äì 5x2

Tutorial 3.18	 Identify the graphs of basic functions.
When graphed, a proper function will pass the ‚Äúvertical line‚Äù test. If a vertical line is drawn on top of 
any graphed equation and the vertical line only intersects the graphed equation in exactly one point, 
then the graphed equation is a function. Another way to determine a ‚Äúproper function‚Äù is to examine 
the ordered pairs for the given equation. If the x-values of these ordered pairs do not repeat and are 
paired with a unique y-value, then the given equation will be a function.
The first ‚Äúbasic‚Äù functions that we should examine are displayed below‚Ä¶that of an identity function (on 
the left)‚Ä¶or, a constant function (in the middle). Both of these functions will have equations that will 
produce straight lines as their graphs. These graphs will also pass the ‚Äúvertical line‚Äù test as described above.

The domain of a function is the set of values that may be used as the ‚Äúinput‚Äù (normally, the x) for the 
given function. We can determine the domain of a function by looking at how its graph ‚Äúcovers‚Äù the 
x-axis. If the graph indicates that positive, negative and zero x-values are used, then the domain will be 
the set of real numbers (as is the case for the identity or constant functions). If one of these value-types 
is not used, then the domain is restricted accordingly.

The range of a function is the set of values that are the ‚Äúoutput‚Äù (normally, the y) after a particular domain-
value is substituted into the given function. We can determine the domain of a function by looking at 
how its graph ‚Äúcovers‚Äù y-axis. If the graph indicates that positive, negative and zero y-values have been 
achieved by the evaluation of the function, then the range will be the set of real numbers (as it is for the 
identity function). If one of these value-types is not used, then the range is restricted accordingly (as it 
is for the constant function).
The graph of a vertical line shown (on the right of the previous page) is being displayed so that we can 
compare it with the two linear functions. Any graphed vertical line is NOT a function‚Ä¶mainly because it 
will not pass the ‚Äúvertical line‚Äù test‚Ä¶and, each of the x-values repeat and is paired with a different y-value. 
Another set of functions that we should examine are the power functions. Notice that each of these 
graphs will pass the ‚Äúvertical line‚Äù test and therefore each of the x-coordinates are paired with a unique 
y- coordinate. Each of these functions will produce a curved graph.

Notice that for the basic quadratic function, we may use any real number (negative, positive or zero) for 
the x-value‚Ä¶thus, its domain is the set of real numbers. However, because the parabola appears from 
the x-axis up, its range must be restricted to be y ‚â• 0 (greater than or equal to zero).
Notice that for the basic cubic function, both the x-values and y-values for this function will include 
negatives, positives and zero‚Ä¶thus, both the domain and the range for these functions will be the set 
of real numbers.

Notice that for the basic square root function, we need to restrict the x-values to be used. Since we 
cannot take the square root of a negative number, the domain for this type of function must be x ‚â• 0. 
And, since we are taking the square root of non-negative numbers, the answers (range) must also be 
restricted to y ‚â• 0.

Notice that the translated (red) quartic curve has been moved three (3) units to the left and two (2) 
units down from the original position as displayed by the grey quartic curve. Also notice that the values 
of h and k from the translated equation are: h = ‚Äì3, k = ‚Äì2‚Ä¶the same number of units translated (h = 
horizontally, k = vertically) from the original position.
We have seen how the horizontal and vertical translations can be determined by the values of h and k. 
How the graphs can be widened or narrowed from a parent (basic original) function can be determined 
by the value of a (the number that is multiplied by the variable expression within a function).
Consider the parent function of: y = x2 ‚Äì which is the black parabola. 
‚Ä¢ The red parabola has the equation of: y = (¬º)x2 and 
a = ¬º. Notice that its opening is wider than that of the 
black one. Whenever the value of a is a fraction (that 
is, 0 < a < 1), the opening of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù parabola will be 
wider than that of the parent function.
‚Ä¢ The blue parabola has the equation of: y = 4x and a = 4. 
Notice that its opening is thinner than that of the black 
one. Whenever the value of a is larger than one (1), the 
opening of the ‚Äúnew parabola will be thinner than that of 
the parent function.

When a polynomial function is expressed in its factored form (as are the three examples below), we can 
see that the zeroes of the function are where the graph will intersect (cross) the x-axis.

The number of variable factors can lead to the degree of the polynomial function:
‚Ä¢ For polynomial function #1, we have two (2) variable factors. If we express the function 
in its unfactored form, the numerator of the function would be: x2 ‚Äì 2x. Notice that this 
polynomial has a degree of two (2).
‚Ä¢ For polynomial function #2, we have three (3) variable factors. If we express the function 
in its unfactored form, the numerator of the function would be: x3 ‚Äì 4x. Notice that this 
polynomial has a degree of three (3).
‚Ä¢ For polynomial function #3, we have four (4) variable factors. If we express the function in 
its unfactored form, the numerator of the function would be: x4 + 4x3 ‚Äì 4x2 ‚Äì 16x. Notice 
that this polynomial has a degree of four (4).
The change in direction can also lead to the degree of the polynomial function:
‚Ä¢ For polynomial function #1, if we started to trace the graph starting on its far left, we would 
come down the parabola, hit the vertex and then go up the other side. We changed direction 
twice. Recall that this polynomial function has a degree of two (2).
‚Ä¢ For polynomial function #2, if we started to trace the graph starting on its far left, we would 
go up the curve to about point (‚Äì1, 3), we would then change directions and come down 
the curve to about point (1, 3) and then change directions one more time‚Ä¶for a total of 3 
changes. Recall that this polynomial function has a degree of three (3).

‚Ä¢ For polynomial function #3, if we started to trace the graph starting on its far left, we would 
come down the curve, we would then change directions and go up the curve, we would then 
change directions and go down the curve, and then finally, change direction one more time 
and go up the curve‚Ä¶for a total of 4 changes. Recall that this polynomial function has a 
degree of four (4).
Using all of this information, we can estimate a possible polynomial function for a given graph. We can 
only approximate a polynomial function based on the x-intercepts. We would need to refine the possible 
coefficients through examination of the range (y-values) that was displayed.
polynomial function #4
This graph appears to have five (5) zeroes‚Ä¶five (5) points where 
the graph intersects the x-axis: (‚Äì2, 0), (‚Äì1, 0), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0). 
Therefore, the polynomial function for this graph probably has a 
degree of at least five (5)‚Ä¶which means that the polynomial has as 
its highest exponent a five (5) or higher. Using the x-values from the 
five (5) points of intersection (in order from smallest to largest), we 
can obtain a possible polynomial function for this graph:
y = (x + 2)(x + 1)(x + 0)(x ‚Äì 1)(x ‚Äì 2)

Notice that the main difference among these three rational functions is their domains. Since the 
denominator of any algebraic fraction cannot ever equal zero, we must determine what value would 
make that happen and then restrict that value from the domain (values allowed to be used as inputs).
The hyperbola for any rational function will always have two asymptotes ‚Äì a vertical one as well as 
a horizontal one ‚Äì that will be used as guideline in sketching the actual graph. While the horizontal 
asymptote for each of these hyperbolas is: y = 0, notice that:
‚Ä¢ The vertical asymptote in the first diagram above is: x = 0 (domain: x ‚â† 0).
‚Ä¢ The vertical asymptote in the second diagram above is: x = ‚Äì1 (domain: x ‚â† ‚Äì1)
‚Ä¢ The vertical asymptote in the third diagram above is: x = + 1 (domain: x ‚â† +1).
Another basic function that needs to be addressed is an absolute value 
function that will result in a V-shaped graph (as seen at the right):
‚Ä¢ basic function: F(x) = a | x |
‚Ä¢ distinctive shape: V-shaped piece-wise function‚Ä¶that has 
two branches
‚Ä¢ domain: x = real numbers
‚Ä¢ range: y ‚â• 0
For this specific display, the function is: y = | x |, with a domain where 
x = real numbers, and a range where y ‚â• 0.

Tutorial 4.1	 Find the amount of interest for a simple interest loan or investment.
Many financial applications involve algebraic formulas that need to be evaluated to complete the desired 
task. One such application would be finding the amount of simple interest on a loan or investment which 
uses the formula that appears below.
Simple Interest: I = Prt
where	
I = interest
	
P = principal (dollars)
	
r = annual interest rate (as a decimal)
	
t = time (years)
example 4.1a	
	
Find the amount of interest that will be earned if $5000 is invested for 10 
years at an annual simple interest rate of 5%.
This real-world application can be solved by following these simple steps:
1.	 Determine the known values for the variables within the formula‚Ä¶
‚ÄÉ P = principal = dollars invested = 5000
‚ÄÉ r = annual interest rate = 5% ‚Üí as a decimal = 0.05
‚ÄÉ t = time in years = 10 years = 10
‚ÄÉ I = simple interest amount = unknown for this problem
2.	 Using the known values, evaluate the formula‚Ä¶
‚ÄÉ I = Prt = (5000)(0.05)(10) = 2500 ‚Üí $2500 of simple interest was earned

Tutorial 4.2	 Find the future value for a simple interest investment.
The future value (S) of a loan or investment is the amount that occurs after the simple interest (I = Prt) 
has been added to the amount (P) that was invested or borrowed, as is expressed by the formula below.
Future Value of Investment or Loan: S = P + I = P + Prt
where	 S = future value (in dollars)
	
P = principal (in dollars)
	
r = annual interest rate (as a decimal)
	
t = time (years)
example 4.2a	
	
Find the future value amount (in dollars) if $5000 is invested for 10 years at 
an annual simple interest rate of 5%.
This real-world application can be solved by following these simple steps:
1.	 Determine the known values for the variables within the formula‚Ä¶
P = principal = dollars invested = 5000
r = annual interest rate = 5% ‚Üí as a decimal = 0.05
t = time in years = 10 years = 10
2.	 Using the known values, evaluate the formula for simple interest‚Ä¶
I = Prt = (5000)(0.05)(10) = 2500
3.	 Add the interest found to the original principal amount‚Ä¶
S = P + I = 5000 + 2500 = 7500 ‚Üí future value = $7500
S = P + I = P + Prt = 5000 + 5000(0.05)(10) = 5000 + 2500 = 7500
example 4.2b	
	
Find the future value amount (in dollars) if $7500 is invested for 3 years at 
an annual simple interest rate of 1.25%.
Following the same three steps as mentioned above:
P = 7500‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ r = 1.25% = 0.0125‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ t = 3
I = Prt = (7500)(0.0125)(3) = 281.25
S = P + I = 7500 + 281.25 = 7781.25 ‚Üí future value = $7781.25
example 4.2c	
	
Find the future value amount (in dollars) if $10,000 is invested for 3 months 
at an annual simple interest rate of 1.5%.
P = 10,000‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ r = 1.5% = 0.015‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ t = 3 months = 3/12 years = 0.25
I = Prt = (10,000)(0.015)(0.25) = 37.5
S = P + I = 10,000 + 37.5 = 10,037.5 ‚Üí future value = $10,037.50

Tutorial 4.3	 Find the amount that was invested into an account where simple 
interest is used.
Occasionally, we might know the future value amount along with the simple interest rate and the length 
of time the simple interest rate was in effect but we do not know the initial amount (P = principal) that 
was invested. When this happens, we need to work backwards to determine the desired initial amount.
Recall that the future value of a simple interest investment can be determined by the formula on the left 
below. We can adapt this formula to solve for the principal (P) by performing some simple algebraic 
steps as shown in the box on the right below.
Future Value of Investment or Loan: S = P + Prt
where	 S = future value (in dollars)
	
P = principal (in dollars)

example 4.3a	
An investor wants to have $30,000 in 9 months. If the best available interest rate is 
7.05% per year, how much (to the nearest dollar) must be invested now to yield the 
desired amount?
This real-world application can be solved by following these simple steps:
1.	 Determine the known values for the variables within the formula‚Ä¶
S = future value = dollars that will be in the account = 30,000
r = annual interest rate = 7.05% ‚Üí as a decimal = 0.0705
t = time in years = 9 months = 9/12 years = 3/4 years = 0.75 years
2.	 Using the known values, evaluate the adjusted formula version for P‚Ä¶
P = S √∑ (1 + rt) = 30,000 √∑ (1 + (0.0705)(0.75)) = 28493.41089
Rounding mathematically to the nearest dollar: $28,493
example 4.3b	
What is the present value (to the nearest dollar) of an investment at 9% annual simple 
interest if it is worth $1060 in 8 months?
Following the same two steps as mentioned above:
S = 1060‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ r = 9% = 0.09‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ t = 8 months = 8/12 years = 2/3 years = 0.666‚Ä¶ years
P = S √∑ (1 + rt) = 1060 √∑ (1 + (0.09)(2/3)) = 1000

rate. At the end of the 10 years, the future value of this account is $7500. What annual 
simple interest rate was used?
This real-world application can be solved by following these simple steps:
1.	 Determine the known values for the variables within the needed formulas‚Ä¶
P = principal = dollars invested = 5000
t = time in years = 10 years = 10
S = future value (in dollars) = 7500

rate. At the end of the 3 months, the future value of this account is $10,037.50 exactly. 
What annual simple interest rate was used?
Following the same two steps as mentioned above:

If a $5000 investment grows to $5937.50 in 15 months, find the simple interest rate 
(to the nearest hundredth of a percent) earned on this investment.
P = 5000‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ t = 15 months = 15/12 years = 1.25‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ S = 5937.50

Tutorial 4.8	 Find the amount that was invested into an account that is 
compounded periodically.
Occasionally, we might know the future value amount along with the interest rate, the number of 
compounding periods per year and the length of time for a particular account that has been periodically 
compounded but we do not know the initial amount (principal) that was invested. When this happens, 
we need to work backwards to determine the desired principal (P). Recall that the future value of an 
investment can be determined by the formula on the left below. We can adapt this formula to solve for 
the principal (P) by performing some simple algebraic steps as shown in the box on the right below.

Tutorial 4.9	 Find the interest rate for a periodically-compounded account.
Occasionally, we might know the future value and the principal amounts along with the number of 
compounding periods per year and the length of time for a particular account that has been periodically 
compounded but we do not know the annual interest rate at which the principal was invested. When 
this happens, we need to work backwards to determine the desired interest rate (r). Recall that the 
future value of an investment can be determined by the formula in the first box below. We can adapt 
this formula to solve for the annual interest rate (r) by performing some simple algebraic steps as shown 
in the second box below.

Tutorial 4.10	 Solve an exponential equation using logarithms.
Occasionally, the unknown that we wish to determine appears in the exponent. Therefore, we need to 
know how to solve an exponential equation. To accomplish this task, we may use the logarithm of a 
power property. Two versions of this property are shown below (one for common logarithms and one 
for natural logarithms):

example 4.10a	 Solve for the variable: 4(25)2x = 312,500
1.	 Isolate (25)2x by dividing both sides of the given equation by 4:
4(25)2x √∑ 4 = 312,500 √∑ 4 ‚Üí (25)2x = 78,125
2.	 Apply the logarithm of a power property:
common logarithms version:
log(25)2x = log(78,125)
(2x)(log(25)) = log(78,125)
natural logarithms version:
ln(25)2x = ln(78,125)
(2x)( ln(25)) = ln(78,125)
3.	 Solve for the variable x:
2x = log(78,125) √∑ log(25)
2x = 3.5
x = 3.5 √∑ 2 = 1.75 ‚Üí x = 1.75
2x = ln(78,125) √∑ ln(25)
2x = 3.5
x = 3.5 √∑ 2 = 1.75 ‚Üí x = 1.75

Tutorial 4.11	 Find the time needed for an account that is compounded periodically 
to reach a certain future value.
Occasionally, we might know the future value and the principal amounts along with the interest rate 
and the number of compounding periods per year for a particular account that has been compounded 
periodically but we do not know the time (number of years) at which the principal has been invested. 
When this happens, we need to work backwards to determine the desired time (t). Recall that the future 
value of an investment can be determined by the formula in the first box below:

where	 S = future value (dollars)

Also depending on what calculator is being used, we might have to search for the ‚Äúlog‚Äù and the ‚Äúln‚Äù 
functions. Each one might be a button on the face of the calculator or might be hidden within a menu 
list that can be found on the calculator. 
Although we may use a different logarithm type to adapt the ‚Äúfuture value‚Äù formula, the final numeric 
result will be the same for either version. So, if we wish to use only one type of logarithm function for 
all problems, the one to choose would be the natural logarithm (ln).
example 4.11a	 How many years (to the nearest tenth) would it take $10,000 invested in an account 
with an annual interest rate of 6% (compounded quarterly) to reach $20,000?
1.	 Determine the known values for the variables within the formula‚Ä¶
P = principal = dollars invested = $10,000
r = annual interest rate = 6% = 0.06
m = compounding periods per year = quarterly = 4
t = time in years = unknown for this problem
S = future value amount = $20,000

Tutorial 4.12	 Find the future value for an account when interest is compounded 
continuously.
Many financial applications involve algebraic formulas that need to be evaluated to complete the desired 
task. One such application would be finding the amount of continuously compounded interest on a loan 
or investment which uses the formula that appears below. 
Future Value (Continuous Compounding): S = Pert
where	
S = future value (dollars)
	
P = principal (dollars)
	
e = irrational number of approximately 2.718281828
	
r = annual interest rate
	
t = time (years)
graphing calculator notation: S = P * e^(r * t)
Depending on what calculator being used, we might have to type the exponential value (rt) into the 
calculator first and then access the e function and then multiply by P.
example 4.12a	 Find the future value (to the nearest cent) if $6200 is invested for 5 years at 8% 
compounded continuously. 
1.	 Determine the known values for the variables within the formula‚Ä¶
P = principal = dollars invested = 6200
r = annual interest rate = 8% ‚Üí as a decimal = 0.08
t = time in years = 5 years = 5
S = future value amount = unknown for this problem
2.	 Using the known values, evaluate the formula‚Ä¶
S = Pert = 6200 √ó e(0.08)(5) = 6200 √ó e0.4 = (6200)(1.491824698) = 9249.313125
graphing calculator solution: S = 6200 * e^(0.08 * 5) = 9249.313125
future value (to nearest cent) = $9249.31
example 4.12b	 Find the future value (to the nearest cent) if $1000 is invested for 20 years at 10% 
compounded continuously. 
P = 1000‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ r = 0.10‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ t = 20
S = Pert = 1000 √ó e(0.10)(20) = 1000 √ó e2 = (1000)(7.389056099) = 7389.056099
graphing calculator solution: S = 1000 * e^(0.10 * 20) = 7389.056099
future value (to nearest cent) = $7389.06

compounded continuously. 
P = 10,000‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ r = 0.05‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ t = 18
S = Pert = 10,000 √ó e(0.05)(18) = 10,000 √ó e0.9 = (10,000)(2.459603111) = 24596.03111
graphing calculator solution: S = 10,000 * e^(0.05 * 18) = 24596.03111
future value (to nearest cent) = $24,596.03

Tutorial 4.13	 Find the amount that was invested into an account that is 
compounded continuously.
Occasionally, we might know the future value amount along with the interest rate and the length of 
time for a particular account that has been compounded continuously but we do not know the initial 
amount (principal) that was invested. When this happens, we need to work backwards to determine the 
desired principal (P). Recall that the future value of an investment can be determined by the formula 
on the left below. We can adapt this formula to solve for the principal (P) by performing some simple 
algebraic steps as shown in the box on the right below:
Future Value (Continuous Compounding): S = Pert
where	 S = future value (dollars)

Tutorial 4.18	 Compute the future value of an ordinary annuity.
We often invest (or save) money by depositing small amounts at different times. When we make equal 
deposits at regular intervals, we are contributing to an annuity. The deposits (or payments) may be 
made at any preset period: annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly and so on. If these deposits (or 
payments) are made at the end of the preset period, the annuity is called an ordinary annuity. The 
sum of all of these deposits (or payments) plus all of the interest earned is call the future value of the 
ordinary annuity and can be calculated by using the formula below:

Tutorial 4.19	 Compute the payment amounts required in order for an ordinary 
annuity to have a specified future value.
Occasionally, we might know the future value amount needed for an ordinary annuity along with the 
interest rate, the number of compounding periods per year and the length of time for a particular annuity 
that has been periodically compounded but we do not know the payment amount needed to accomplish 
the desired monetary goal. When this happens, we need to work backwards to determine the desired 
payment (R). Recall that the future value of an ordinary annuity can be determined by the formula in 
the top box below. We can adapt this formula to solve for the deposit amount (R) by performing some 
simple algebraic steps as shown in the second box below.

Tutorial 4.20	 Find out how long it will take for an ordinary annuity to reach a savings goal.
Occasionally, we might know the future value and the periodic payment amounts along with the interest rate and 
the number of compounding periods per year for a particular account that has been compounded periodically but 
we do not know the time (number of years) at which the annuity payments have been invested. When this happens, 
we need to work backwards to determine the desired time (t). Recall that the future value of an ordinary annuity 
can be determined by the formula in the top box below. We can adapt this formula to solve for the deposit amount 
(R) by performing some simple algebraic steps as shown in the second box below:

Tutorial 4.21	 Compute the future values of an annuity due.
We often invest (or save) money by depositing small amounts at different times. When we make equal 
deposits at regular intervals, we are contributing to an annuity. The deposits (or payments) may be 
made at any preset period: annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly and so on. If these deposits (or 
payments) are made at the beginning of the preset period, the annuity is called an annuity due. The 
sum of all of these deposits (or payments) plus all of the interest earned is call the future value of the 
annuity due and can be calculated by using the formula below:

to have specified future values.
Occasionally, we might know the future value along with the interest rate, the number of compounding 
periods per year and the length of time for a particular account that has been compounded periodically 
but we do not know the periodic payment amount (R). When this happens, we need to work backwards 
to determine the desired value. Recall that the future value of an annuity due can be determined by 
the formula in the top box below. We can adapt this formula to solve for the deposit amount (R) by

Tutorial 4.23	 Find out how long it will take for an annuity due to reach a savings 
goal.
Occasionally, we might know the future value and the periodic payment amounts along with the interest 
rate and the number of compounding periods per year but we do not know the number of years (time) 
for the given future value to be reached. When this happens, we need to work backwards to determine 
the desired value. Recall that the future value of an annuity due can be determined by the formula in the 
top box below. We can adapt this formula to solve for the time (t) by performing some simple algebraic 
steps as shown in the second box below.

Tutorial 4.24	 Compute the present value of an ordinary annuity.
Recall that an ordinary annuity is a set of equal payments that occur at the end of evenly spaced periods 
(intervals). The present value of an ordinary annuity is the amount invested today in an ordinary annuity 
account at a specified interest rate so that future equal withdrawals (payments) can be made based on 
the original principal and all of the accumulated interest. The idea here is that these equal withdrawals 
(payments) will completely exhaust the accumulated amount at the end of the annuity.

i = interest rate per period (as a decimal) = nominal annual rate as a decimal
total compounding periods per year

=
	
n = total number of compounding periods = (compounding periods per year)
(years) = (m)(t)
graphing calculator notation:
An = R * (1 ‚Äì (1 + i)^‚Äìn) √∑ i
So, if we know the approximate amount of equal withdrawals (payments) needed, we can use the formula 
above to determine the present value needed to fund the desired annuity plan.
example 4.24a	 How much (to the nearest dollar) is needed in an account that earns 8.4% compounded 
monthly in order to withdraw $900 at the end of each month for 20 years?
1.	 Determine the known values for the variables within the formula‚Ä¶
‚ÄÉ R = 900‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ r = 8.4% = 0.084‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ m = 12 (monthly)‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ t = 20

Tutorial 4.25	 Compute the payments for a specified present value for an ordinary 
annuity.
Occasionally, we might know the present value amount along with the interest rate and the length of 
time the interest rate was in effect but we do not know the payment (withdrawal) amount that will be 
possible from the accumulated principal and interest of the established ordinary annuity. When this 
happens, we need to work backwards to determine the desired payment (withdrawal) amount. Recall 
that the present value of an ordinary annuity can be determined by the formula in the first box below. 
We can adapt this formula to solve for the payment (withdrawal) amount (R) by performing some simple 
algebraic steps as shown in the second box below:

Tutorial 4.26	 Compute the present value of an annuity due.
Recall that an annuity due is a set of equal payments that occur at the beginning of evenly spaced 
periods (intervals). The present value of an annuity due is the amount invested today in an annuity due 
account at a specified interest rate so that future equal withdrawals (payments) can be made based on 
the original principal and all of the accumulated interest. The idea here is that these equal withdrawals 
(payments) will completely exhaust the accumulated amount at the end of the annuity. So, if we know 
the approximate amount of equal withdrawals (payments) needed, we can use the formula below to 
determine the present value needed to fund the desired annuity plan.

example 4.26a	 If the money is worth 6% (compounded quarterly), find the present value (to the 
nearest dollar) of an annuity due that pays $6000 at the beginning of each quarter 
for the next 12 years.
1.	 Determine the known values for the variables within the formula‚Ä¶
‚ÄÉ R = 6000	
r = 5.8% = 0.058

Tutorial 4.28	 Compute the present value of a deferred annuity.
Recall that with an ordinary annuity, payments (withdrawals) are made at the end of the payment period. 
With an annuity due, payments (withdrawals) are made at the beginning of the payment period. A 
deferred annuity is an annuity where the first payment is not made at the end or the beginning of the 
first possible period but is postponed for a length of time.
The present value of a deferred annuity is the amount invested today in an annuity account at a specified 
interest rate so that future equal withdrawals (payments) can be made based on the original principal and 
all of the accumulated interest. The idea here is that these equal withdrawals (payments) will completely 
exhaust the accumulated amount at the end of the annuity. So, if we know the approximate amount of 
equal withdrawals (payments) needed, we can use the formula below to determine the present value 
needed to fund the desired annuity plan.

example 4.28a	 The terms of a single parent‚Äôs last will & testament indicate that a niece will receive 
an annuity of $50,000 per year from age 18 to age 24 (so the niece can attend college) 
and that the balance of the estate goes to a daughter. If the single parent dies on the 
niece‚Äôs 14th birthday, how much money (to the nearest dollar) must be removed from 
the estate to purchase the annuity? (Assume an interest rate of 6%, compounded 
annually.)

Tutorial 4.29	 Compute the payments for a specified present value for a deferred 
annuity.
Occasionally, we might know the present value amount needed for a deferred annuity along with the 
interest rate, the number of compounding periods per year, the total number of compounding periods 
for the life of the annuity and the number of periods that will be deferred‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶we do not know the 
payment (withdrawal) amount that will be possible from the accumulated principal and interest of the 
established deferred annuity. When this happens, we need to work backwards to determine the desired 
payment (withdrawal) amount.
Recall that the present value of a deferred annuity can be determined by the formula in the first box 
below. We can adapt this formula to solve for the payment (withdrawal) amount (R) by performing some 
simple algebraic steps as shown in the second box below.

Tutorial 4.30	 Find the regular payments to amortize a debt.
Most people purchase large-ticket items through installment loans. The process of repaying such a loan 
is called amortization. We can determine the regular payments for an amortized debt through the use 
of the formula below:

nominal annual rate as a decimal
total compounding periods per year
r
m
=
	
n = total number of equal periodic payments = (compounding periods per year)
(years) = (m)(t)
graphing calculator notation:
R = An * i √∑ (1 ‚Äì (1 + i)^‚Äìn)
example 4.30a	 A debt of $50,000 is to be amortized by equal payments at the end of each year for 
5 years. If the interest charged is 8% (compounded annually), find the periodic 
payment (to the nearest dollar).
1.	 Determine the known values for the variables within the formula‚Ä¶
‚ÄÉ An = 50,000‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ r = 8% = 0.08‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ m = 1 (annually)‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ t = 5

Tutorial 4.31	 Find the amount that can be borrowed for a specified payment.
When we attempt to live within a preset budget, we might need to determine how much of a repayment 
amount we can afford before purchasing a large-ticket item that needs to be amortized. Therefore, we 
might need to use the amortization formula to solve for the amount of the debt‚Ä¶which means that we 
need to work the formula backwards. The first box below is the amortization formula while the second 
box is the adjusted formula after applying some simple algebraic steps.

Tutorial 4.32	 Find the unpaid balance of a loan.
There may be times when we have purchased a home (vehicle) through an amortization process and are 
still paying the loan off when we decide that we would like to purchase a different home (vehicle). Before 
we can make the new purchase, we have to determine the unpaid balance (amount still remaining on 
the loan) so that we can make arrangements for the repayment of the old loan. We can calculate this 
unpaid balance by using the formula below.

I received my BS degree from Trenton State College (now known as the College of New Jersey, Ewing 
Township, New Jersey 08618, USA) in 1973. From February 1977 to the end of June 2003, I worked as a full 
time mathematics teacher at Point Pleasant Borough High School (Point Pleasant, New Jersey 08742, USA). 
Throughout my years at this school, I taught several courses offered through the mathematics department: 
Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Algebra 2 Honors, Basic Skills Math, Computer Programming (BASIC), Computer 
Programming (QBASIC), Discrete Mathematics, Geometry, Geometry Honors, SAT Preparation.
I received my MA degree from Georgian Court College (now known as Georgian Court University, 
Lakewood, New Jersey 08701) in 1983 after following the Supervision & Curriculum Graduate Program.
I taught at Monmouth University (West Long Branch, New Jersey 07764, USA) as an adjunct professor 
(through the Mathematics Department) during three semesters (SP98, SP99, FA98) while still working 
full-time at Point Pleasant Borough High School. Due to a conflict with my full-time teaching position, 
I declined any adjunct teaching duties until several years later.
After teaching secondary mathematics for more than 25 years, I retired from the Point Pleasant Borough 
School district at the end of June 2003. After taking some time off, I discovered that I was still in love 
with teaching mathematics. So, I asked to return to the list of adjunct professors at Monmouth University.
I returned to Monmouth University in September 2004. During my time at Monmouth, I have taught 
several courses offered through the University‚Äôs Mathematics Department:
‚Ä¢ MA050 ‚Äì Pre-Algebra Math
‚Ä¢ MA100 ‚Äì Quantitative Reasoning & Problem Solving
‚Ä¢ MA101 ‚Äì College Algebra
‚Ä¢ MA105 ‚Äì Mathematical Modeling in the Social Sciences
‚Ä¢ MA117 ‚Äì Quantitative Analysis for Business I
‚Ä¢ MA203 ‚Äì Foundations of Elementary Mathematics I
‚Ä¢ MA204 ‚Äì Foundations of Elementary Mathematics II
Always looking to expand my academic achievements, I agreed to compose an e-book for Bookboon.
com during the latter part of 2012‚Ä¶the result being this tutorial e-book entitled Quantitative Analysis ‚Äì 
Algebra with a Business Perspective.
