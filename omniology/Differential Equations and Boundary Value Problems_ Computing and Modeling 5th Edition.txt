his is a textbook for the standard introductory differential equations course
taken by science and engineering students.
Its updated content reﬂects the
wide availability of technical computing environments like Maple, Mathematica,
and MATLAB that now are used extensively by practicing engineers and scientists.
The traditional manual and symbolic methods are augmented with coverage also
of qualitative and computer-based methods that employ numerical computation and
graphical visualization to develop greater conceptual understanding. A bonus of
this more comprehensive approach is accessibility to a wider range of more realistic
applications of differential equations.
Principal Features of This Revision
This 5th edition is a comprehensive and wide-ranging revision.
In addition to ﬁne-tuning the exposition (both text and graphics) in numerous
sections throughout the book, new applications have been inserted (including bio-
logical), and we have exploited throughout the new interactive computer technology
that is now available to students on devices ranging from desktop and laptop com-
puters to smart phones and graphing calculators. It also utilizes computer algebra
systems such as Mathematica, Maple, and MATLAB as well as online web sites
such as WolframjAlpha.
However, with a single exception of a new section inserted in Chapter 5 (noted
below), the classtested table of contents of the book remains unchanged. Therefore,
instructors’ notes and syllabi will not require revision to continue teaching with this
new edition.
A conspicuous feature of this edition is the insertion of about 80 new computer-
generated ﬁgures, many of them illustrating how interactive computer applications
with slider bars or touchpad controls can be used to change initial values or param-
eters in a differential equation, allowing the user to immediately see in real time the
resulting changes in the structure of its solutions.
Some illustrations of the various types of revision and updating exhibited in
this edition:
New Interactive Technology and Graphics
New ﬁgures inserted through-
out illustrate the facility offered by modern computing technology platforms
for the user to interactively vary initial conditions and other parameters in
real time. Thus, using a mouse or touchpad, the initial point for an initial
value problem can be dragged to a new location, and the corresponding solu-
tion curve is automatically redrawn and dragged along with its initial point.
For instance, see the Sections 1.3 (page 28) application module and 3.1 (page
148). Using slider bars in an interactive graphic, the coefﬁcients or other pa-
rameters in a linear system can be varied, and the corresponding changes in its
direction ﬁeld and phase plane portrait are automatically shown; for instance,
vii

Preface
see the application module for Section 5.3 (page 319). The number of terms
used from an inﬁnite series solution of a differential equation can be varied,
and the resulting graphical change in the corresponding approximate solution
is shown immediately; see the Section 8.2 application module (page 516).
New Exposition
In a number of sections, new text and graphics have been
inserted to enhance student understanding of the subject matter. For instance,
see the treatments of separable equations in Section 1.4 (page 30), linear equa-
tions in Section 1.5 (page 45), isolated critical points in Sections 6.1 (page
372) and 6.2 (page 383), and the new example in Section 9.6 (page 618)
showing a vibrating string with a momentary “ﬂat spot.” Examples and ac-
companying graphics have been updated in Sections 2.4–2.6, 4.2, and 4.3 to
illustrate new graphing calculators.
New Content
The single entirely new section for this edition is Section
5.3, which is devoted to the construction of a “gallery” of phase plane por-
traits illustrating all the possible geometric behaviors of solutions of the 2-
dimensional linear system x0 D Ax. In motivation and preparation for the
detailed study of eigenvalue-eigenvector methods in subsequent sections of
Chapter 5 (which then follow in the same order as in the previous edi-
tion), Section 5.3 shows how the particular arrangements of eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the coefﬁcient matrix A correspond to identiﬁable patterns—
“ﬁngerprints,” so to speak—in the phase plane portrait of the system x0 D Ax.
The resulting gallery is shown in the two pages of phase plane portraits that
comprise Figure 5.3.16 (pages 315-316) at the end of the section. The new 5.3
application module (on dynamic phase plane portraits, page 319) shows how
students can use interactive computer systems to “bring to life” this gallery, by
allowing initial conditions, eigenvalues, and even eigenvectors to vary in real
time. This dynamic approach is then illustrated with several new graphics in-
serted in the remainder of Chapter 5. Finally, for a new biological application,
see the application module for Section 6.4, which now includes a substan-
tial investigation (page 423) of the nonlinear FitzHugh-Nagumo equations in
neuroscience, which were introduced to model the behavior of neurons in the
nervous system.
Computing Features
The following features highlight the computing technology that distinguishes much
of our exposition.

Over 750 computer-generated ﬁgures show students vivid pictures of direction
ﬁelds, solution curves, and phase plane portraits that bring symbolic solutions
of differential equations to life.

About 45 application modules follow key sections throughout the text. Most
of these applications outline “technology neutral” investigations illustrating
the use of technical computing systems and seek to actively engage students
in the application of new technology.

A fresh numerical emphasis that is afforded by the early introduction of nu-
merical solution techniques in Chapter 2 (on mathematical models and nu-
merical methods). Here and in Chapter 4, where numerical techniques for
systems are treated, a concrete and tangible ﬂavor is achieved by the inclu-
sion of numerical algorithms presented in parallel fashion for systems ranging
from graphing calculators to MATLAB.

Modeling Features
Mathematical modeling is a goal and constant motivation for the study of differen-
tial equations. To sample the range of applications in this text, take a look at the
following questions:

What explains the commonly observed time lag between indoor and outdoor
daily temperature oscillations? (Section 1.5)

What makes the difference between doomsday and extinction in alligator pop-
ulations? (Section 2.1)

How do a unicycle and a twoaxle car react differently to road bumps? (Sec-
tions 3.7 and 5.4)

How can you predict the time of next perihelion passage of a newly observed
comet? (Section 4.3)

Why might an earthquake demolish one building and leave standing the one
next door? (Section 5.4)

What determines whether two species will live harmoniously together, or
whether competition will result in the extinction of one of them and the sur-
vival of the other? (Section 6.3)

Why and when does non-linearity lead to chaos in biological and mechanical
systems? (Section 6.5)

If a mass on a spring is periodically struck with a hammer, how does the
behavior of the mass depend on the frequency of the hammer blows? (Section
7.6)

Why are ﬂagpoles hollow instead of solid? (Section 8.6)

What explains the difference in the sounds of a guitar, a xylophone, and drum?
(Sections 9.6, 10.2, and 10.4)
Organization and Content
We have reshaped the usual approach and sequence of topics to accommodate new
technology and new perspectives. For instance:

After a precis of ﬁrst-order equations in Chapter 1 (though with the cover-
age of certain traditional symbolic methods streamlined a bit), Chapter 2 of-
fers an early introduction to mathematical modeling, stability and qualitative
properties of differential equations, and numerical methods—a combination
of topics that frequently are dispersed later in an introductory course. Chapter
3 includes the standard methods of solution of linear differential equations of
higher order, particularly those with constant coefﬁcients, and provides an es-
pecially wide range of applications involving simple mechanical systems and
electrical circuits; the chapter ends with an elementary treatment of endpoint
problems and eigenvalues.

Chapters 4 and 5 provide a ﬂexible treatment of linear systems. Motivated
by current trends in science and engineering education and practice, Chap-
ter 4 offers an early, intuitive introduction to ﬁrst-order systems, models, and
numerical approximation techniques. Chapter 5 begins with a self-contained

x
Preface
treatment of the linear algebra that is needed, and then presents the eigenvalue
approach to linear systems. It includes a wide range of applications (ranging
from railway cars to earthquakes) of all the various cases of the eigenvalue
method. Section 5.5 includes a fairly extensive treatment of matrix exponen-
tials, which are exploited in Section 5.6 on nonhomogeneous linear systems.

Chapter 6 on nonlinear systems and phenomena ranges from phase plane anal-
ysis to ecological and mechanical systems to a concluding section on chaos
and bifurcation in dynamical systems. Section 6.5 presents an elementary in-
troduction to such contemporary topics as period-doubling in biological and
mechanical systems, the pitchfork diagram, and the Lorenz strange attractor
(all illustrated with vivid computer graphics).

Laplace transform methods (Chapter 7) and power series methods (Chapter 8)
follow the material on linear and nonlinear systems, but can be covered at any
earlier point (after Chapter 3) the instructor desires.

Chapters 9 and 10 treat the applications of Fourier series, separation of vari-
ables, and Sturm-Liouville theory to partial differential equations and bound-
ary value problems. After the introduction of Fourier series, the three clas-
sical equations—the wave and heat equations and Laplace’s equation—are
discussed in the last three sections of Chapter 9. The eigenvalue methods of
Chapter 10 are developed sufﬁciently to include some rather signiﬁcant and
realistic applications.
This book includes enough material appropriately arranged for different courses
varying in length from one quarter to two semesters. The briefer version Differen-
tial Equations: Computing and Modeling (0-321-81625-0) ends with Chapter 7 on
Laplace transform methods (and thus omits the material on power series methods,
Fourier series, separation of variables and partial differential equations).
Student and Instructor Resources
The answer section has been expanded considerably to increase its value as a learn-
ing aid. It now includes the answers to most odd-numbered problems plus a good
many even-numbered ones. The Instructor’s Solutions Manual (0-321-79701-
9) available at www.pearsonhighered.com/irc provides worked-out solutions
for most of the problems in the book, and the Student Solutions Manual (0-321-
79700-0) contains solutions for most of the odd-numbered problems. These manu-
als have been reworked extensively for this edition with improved explanations and
more details inserted in the solutions of many problems.
The approximately 45 application modules in the text contain additional prob-
lem and project material designed largely to engage students in the exploration
and application of computational technology. These investigations are expanded
considerably in the Applications Manual (0-321-79704-3) that accompanies the
text and supplements it with additional and sometimes more challenging investi-
gations. Each section in this manual has parallel subsections Using Maple, Using
Mathematica, and Using MATLAB that detail the applicable methods and tech-
niques of each system, and will afford student users an opportunity to compare the
merits and styles of different computational systems. These materials—as well as
the text of the Applications Manual itself—are freely available at the web site
www.pearsonhighered.com/mathstatsresources.

First-Order
Differential Equations
1.1 Differential Equations and Mathematical Models
T
he laws of the universe are written in the language of mathematics. Algebra
is sufﬁcient to solve many static problems, but the most interesting natural
phenomena involve change and are described by equations that relate changing
quantities.
Because the derivative dx=dt D f 0.t/ of the function f is the rate at which
the quantity x D f .t/ is changing with respect to the independent variable t, it
is natural that equations involving derivatives are frequently used to describe the
changing universe. An equation relating an unknown function and one or more of
its derivatives is called a differential equation.
Example 1
The differential equation
dx
dt D x2 C t2
involves both the unknown function x.t/ and its ﬁrst derivative x0.t/ D dx=dt. The differential
equation
d 2y
dx2 C 3 dy
dx C 7y D 0
involves the unknown function y of the independent variable x and the ﬁrst two derivatives
y0 and y00 of y.
The study of differential equations has three principal goals:
1. To discover the differential equation that describes a speciﬁed physical
situation.
2. To ﬁnd—either exactly or approximately—the appropriate solution of that
equation.
3. To interpret the solution that is found.
In algebra, we typically seek the unknown numbers that satisfy an equation
such as x3 C 7x2  11x C 41 D 0. By contrast, in solving a differential equation, we
1

2
Chapter 1 First-Order Differential Equations
are challenged to ﬁnd the unknown functions y D y.x/ for which an identity such
as y0.x/ D 2xy.x/—that is, the differential equation
dy
dx D 2xy
—holds on some interval of real numbers. Ordinarily, we will want to ﬁnd all
solutions of the differential equation, if possible.
Example 2
If C is a constant and
y.x/ D Cex2;
(1)
then
dy
dx D C

2xex2
D .2x/

Cex2
D 2xy:
Thus every function y.x/ of the form in Eq. (1) satisﬁes—and thus is a solution of—the
differential equation
dy
dx D 2xy
(2)
for all x. In particular, Eq. (1) deﬁnes an inﬁnite family of different solutions of this differen-
tial equation, one for each choice of the arbitrary constant C. By the method of separation of
variables (Section 1.4) it can be shown that every solution of the differential equation in (2)
is of the form in Eq. (1).
Differential Equations and Mathematical Models
The following three examples illustrate the process of translating scientiﬁc laws and
principles into differential equations. In each of these examples the independent
variable is time t, but we will see numerous examples in which some quantity other
than time is the independent variable.
Example 3
Newton’s law of cooling may be stated in this way: The time rate of change (the rate of
change with respect to time t) of the temperature T .t/ of a body is proportional to the differ-
ence between T and the temperature A of the surrounding medium (Fig. 1.1.1). That is,
dT
dt D k.T  A/;
(3)
where k is a positive constant. Observe that if T > A, then dT=dt < 0, so the temperature is
a decreasing function of t and the body is cooling. But if T < A, then dT=dt > 0, so that T
is increasing.
Thus the physical law is translated into a differential equation. If we are given the
values of k and A, we should be able to ﬁnd an explicit formula for T .t/, and then—with the
aid of this formula—we can predict the future temperature of the body.
Temperature T
Temperature A
FIGURE 1.1.1.
Newton’s law of
cooling, Eq. (3), describes the cooling
of a hot rock in water.
Example 4
Torricelli’s law implies that the time rate of change of the volume V of water in a draining
tank (Fig. 1.1.2) is proportional to the square root of the depth y of water in the tank:
dV
dt D kpy;
(4)
where k is a constant. If the tank is a cylinder with vertical sides and cross-sectional area A,
then V D Ay, so dV=dt D A  .dy=dt/. In this case Eq. (4) takes the form
dy
dt D hpy;
(5)
where h D k=A is a constant.

1.1 Differential Equations and Mathematical Models
3
Example 5
The time rate of change of a population P.t/ with constant birth and death rates is, in many
simple cases, proportional to the size of the population. That is,
dP
dt D kP;
(6)
where k is the constant of proportionality.
Let us discuss Example 5 further. Note ﬁrst that each function of the form
P.t/ D Cekt
(7)
is a solution of the differential equation
dP
dt D kP
in (6). We verify this assertion as follows:
y
Volume V
FIGURE 1.1.2.
Newton’s law of
cooling, Eq. (3), describes the cooling
of a hot rock in water.
P 0.t/ D Ckekt D k

Cekt
D kP.t/
for all real numbers t. Because substitution of each function of the form given in
(7) into Eq. (6) produces an identity, all such functions are solutions of Eq. (6).
Thus, even if the value of the constant k is known, the differential equation
dP=dt D kP has inﬁnitely many different solutions of the form P.t/ D Cekt, one for
each choice of the “arbitrary” constant C. This is typical of differential equations.
It is also fortunate, because it may allow us to use additional information to select
from among all these solutions a particular one that ﬁts the situation under study.
Example 6
Suppose that P.t/ D Cekt is the population of a colony of bacteria at time t, that the pop-
ulation at time t D 0 (hours, h) was 1000, and that the population doubled after 1 h. This
additional information about P.t/ yields the following equations:
1000 D P.0/ D Ce0 D C;
2000 D P.1/ D Cek:
It follows that C D 1000 and that ek D 2, so k D ln 2  0:693147. With this value of k the
differential equation in (6) is
dP
dt D .ln 2/P  .0:693147/P:
Substitution of k D ln 2 and C D 1000 in Eq. (7) yields the particular solution
P.t/ D 1000e.ln 2/t D 1000.eln 2/t D 1000  2t
(because eln 2 D 2)
that satisﬁes the given conditions. We can use this particular solution to predict future popu-
lations of the bacteria colony. For instance, the predicted number of bacteria in the population

The condition P.0/ D 1000 in Example 6 is called an initial condition because
we frequently write differential equations for which t D 0 is the “starting time.”
Figure 1.1.3 shows several different graphs of the form P.t/ D Cekt with k D ln 2.
The graphs of all the inﬁnitely many solutions of dP=dt D kP in fact ﬁll the entire
two-dimensional plane, and no two intersect. Moreover, the selection of any one
point P0 on the P -axis amounts to a determination of P.0/. Because exactly one
solution passes through each such point, we see in this case that an initial condition
P.0/ D P0 determines a unique solution agreeing with the given data.

Mathematical Models
Our brief discussion of population growth in Examples 5 and 6 illustrates the crucial
process of mathematical modeling (Fig. 1.1.4), which involves the following:
1. The formulation of a real-world problem in mathematical terms; that is, the
construction of a mathematical model.
2. The analysis or solution of the resulting mathematical problem.
3. The interpretation of the mathematical results in the context of the original
real-world situation—for example, answering the question originally posed.

The process of mathematical modeling.
In the population example, the real-world problem is that of determining the
population at some future time. A mathematical model consists of a list of vari-
ables (P and t) that describe the given situation, together with one or more equations
relating these variables (dP=dt D kP , P.0/ D P0) that are known or are assumed to
hold. The mathematical analysis consists of solving these equations (here, for P as
a function of t). Finally, we apply these mathematical results to attempt to answer
the original real-world question.
As an example of this process, think of ﬁrst formulating the mathematical
model consisting of the equations dP=dt D kP , P.0/ D 1000, describing the bac-
teria population of Example 6. Then our mathematical analysis there consisted of
solving for the solution function P.t/ D 1000e.ln 2/t D 1000  2t as our mathemat-
ical result. For an interpretation in terms of our real-world situation—the actual
bacteria population—we substituted t D 1:5 to obtain the predicted population of
P.1:5/  2828 bacteria after 1.5 hours. If, for instance, the bacteria population is
growing under ideal conditions of unlimited space and food supply, our prediction
may be quite accurate, in which case we conclude that the mathematical model is
adequate for studying this particular population.
On the other hand, it may turn out that no solution of the selected differential
equation accurately ﬁts the actual population we’re studying. For instance, for no
choice of the constants C and k does the solution P.t/ D Cekt in Eq. (7) accurately
describe the actual growth of the human population of the world over the past few
centuries. We must conclude that the differential equation dP=dt D kP is inadequate
for modeling the world population—which in recent decades has “leveled off” as
compared with the steeply climbing graphs in the upper half (P > 0) of Fig. 1.1.3.
With sufﬁcient insight, we might formulate a new mathematical model including
a perhaps more complicated differential equation, one that takes into account such
factors as a limited food supply and the effect of increased population on birth and
death rates. With the formulation of this new mathematical model, we may attempt
to traverse once again the diagram of Fig. 1.1.4 in a counterclockwise manner. If
we can solve the new differential equation, we get new solution functions to com-

pare with the real-world population. Indeed, a successful population analysis may
require reﬁning the mathematical model still further as it is repeatedly measured
against real-world experience.
But in Example 6 we simply ignored any complicating factors that might af-
fect our bacteria population. This made the mathematical analysis quite simple,
perhaps unrealistically so. A satisfactory mathematical model is subject to two con-
tradictory requirements: It must be sufﬁciently detailed to represent the real-world
situation with relative accuracy, yet it must be sufﬁciently simple to make the math-
ematical analysis practical. If the model is so detailed that it fully represents the
physical situation, then the mathematical analysis may be too difﬁcult to carry out.
If the model is too simple, the results may be so inaccurate as to be useless. Thus
there is an inevitable tradeoff between what is physically realistic and what is math-
ematically possible. The construction of a model that adequately bridges this gap
between realism and feasibility is therefore the most crucial and delicate step in
the process. Ways must be found to simplify the model mathematically without
sacriﬁcing essential features of the real-world situation.
Mathematical models are discussed throughout this book. The remainder of
this introductory section is devoted to simple examples and to standard terminology
used in discussing differential equations and their solutions.
Examples and Terminology

on any interval of real numbers not containing the point x D C. Actually, Eq. (8) deﬁnes a
one-parameter family of solutions of dy=dx D y2, one for each value of the arbitrary constant
or “parameter” C. With C D 1 we get the particular solution
y.x/ D

that satisﬁes the initial condition y.0/ D 1. As indicated in Fig. 1.1.5, this solution is contin-
uous on the interval .1; 1/ but has a vertical asymptote at x D 1.
Example 8
Verify that the function y.x/ D 2x1=2  x1=2 ln x satisﬁes the differential equation

for all x > 0.

First we compute the derivatives

2x1=2 ln x
and
y00.x/ D 1
4x3=2 ln x  1
2x3=2:
Then substitution into Eq. (10) yields

4x3=2 ln x  1
2x3=2
C 2x1=2  x1=2 ln x D 0
if x is positive, so the differential equation is satisﬁed for all x > 0.

Chapter 1 First-Order Differential Equations
The fact that we can write a differential equation is not enough to guarantee
that it has a solution. For example, it is clear that the differential equation
.y0/2 C y2 D 1
(11)
has no (real-valued) solution, because the sum of nonnegative numbers cannot be
negative. For a variation on this theme, note that the equation
.y0/2 C y2 D 0
(12)
obviously has only the (real-valued) solution y.x/  0. In our previous examples
any differential equation having at least one solution indeed had inﬁnitely many.
The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative that
appears in it. The differential equation of Example 8 is of second order, those in
Examples 2 through 7 are ﬁrst-order equations, and
y.4/ C x2y.3/ C x5y D sin x
is a fourth-order equation. The most general form of an nth-order differential
equation with independent variable x and unknown function or dependent variable
y D y.x/ is
F

x; y; y0; y00; : : : ; y.n/
D 0;
(13)
where F is a speciﬁc real-valued function of n C 2 variables.
Our use of the word solution has been until now somewhat informal. To be
precise, we say that the continuous function u D u.x/ is a solution of the differential
equation in (13) on the interval I provided that the derivatives u0, u00, : : : , u.n/ exist
on I and
F

x; u; u0; u00; : : : ; u.n/
D 0
for all x in I. For the sake of brevity, we may say that u D u.x/ satisﬁes the
differential equation in (13) on I.
Remark Recall from elementary calculus that a differentiable function on an open interval
is necessarily continuous there. This is why only a continuous function can qualify as a
(differentiable) solution of a differential equation on an interval.

Example 7
Figure 1.1.5 shows the two “connected” branches of the graph y D 1=.1  x/. The left-hand
branch is the graph of a (continuous) solution of the differential equation y0 D y2 that is
deﬁned on the interval .1; 1/. The right-hand branch is the graph of a different solution of
the differential equation that is deﬁned (and continuous) on the different interval .1; 1/. So
the single formula y.x/ D 1=.1  x/ actually deﬁnes two different solutions (with different
domains of deﬁnition) of the same differential equation y0 D y2.
Example 9
If A and B are constants and
y.x/ D A cos 3x C B sin 3x;
(14)
then two successive differentiations yield
y0.x/ D 3A sin 3x C 3B cos 3x;
y00.x/ D 9A cos 3x  9B sin 3x D 9y.x/
for all x. Consequently, Eq. (14) deﬁnes what it is natural to call a two-parameter family of
solutions of the second-order differential equation
y00 C 9y D 0
(15)
on the whole real number line. Figure 1.1.6 shows the graphs of several such solutions.

Although the differential equations in (11) and (12) are exceptions to the gen-
eral rule, we will see that an nth-order differential equation ordinarily has an n-

rameters.
In both Eqs. (11) and (12), the appearance of y0 as an implicitly deﬁned func-
tion causes complications. For this reason, we will ordinarily assume that any dif-
ferential equation under study can be solved explicitly for the highest derivative that
appears; that is, that the equation can be written in the so-called normal form
y.n/ D G

x; y; y0; y00; : : : ; y.n1/
;
(16)
where G is a real-valued function of n C 1 variables. In addition, we will always
seek only real-valued solutions unless we warn the reader otherwise.
All the differential equations we have mentioned so far are ordinary differ-
ential equations, meaning that the unknown function (dependent variable) depends
on only a single independent variable. If the dependent variable is a function of
two or more independent variables, then partial derivatives are likely to be involved;
if they are, the equation is called a partial differential equation. For example, the
temperature u D u.x; t/ of a long thin uniform rod at the point x at time t satisﬁes
(under appropriate simple conditions) the partial differential equation
@u
@t D k @2u
@x2 ;
where k is a constant (called the thermal diffusivity of the rod). In Chapters 1
through 8 we will be concerned only with ordinary differential equations and will
refer to them simply as differential equations.
In this chapter we concentrate on ﬁrst-order differential equations of the form
dy
dx D f .x; y/:
(17)
We also will sample the wide range of applications of such equations. A typical
mathematical model of an applied situation will be an initial value problem, con-
sisting of a differential equation of the form in (17) together with an initial condi-
tion y.x0/ D y0. Note that we call y.x0/ D y0 an initial condition whether or not
x0 D 0. To solve the initial value problem
dy
dx D f .x; y/;
y.x0/ D y0
(18)
means to ﬁnd a differentiable function y D y.x/ that satisﬁes both conditions in
Eq. (18) on some interval containing x0.

Given the solution y.x/ D 1=.C  x/ of the differential equation dy=dx D y2 discussed in
Example 7, solve the initial value problem

y.1/ D 2:

We need only ﬁnd a value of C so that the solution y.x/ D 1=.C  x/ satisﬁes the initial

The central question of greatest immediate interest to us is this: If we are given
a differential equation known to have a solution satisfying a given initial condition,
how do we actually ﬁnd or compute that solution? And, once found, what can we do
with it? We will see that a relatively few simple techniques—separation of variables
(Section 1.4), solution of linear equations (Section 1.5), elementary substitution
methods (Section 1.6)—are enough to enable us to solve a variety of ﬁrst-order
equations having impressive applications.

To satisfy an initial condition y.x0/ D y0, we need only substitute x D x0 and
y D y0 into Eq. (3) to obtain y0 D G.x0/ C C, so that C D y0  G.x0/. With this
choice of C, we obtain the particular solution of Eq. (1) satisfying the initial value

We will see that this is the typical pattern for solutions of ﬁrst-order differential
equations. Ordinarily, we will ﬁrst ﬁnd a general solution involving an arbitrary
constant C. We can then attempt to obtain, by appropriate choice of C, a particular
solution satisfying a given initial condition y.x0/ D y0.
Remark As the term is used in the previous paragraph, a general solution of a ﬁrst-order
differential equation is simply a one-parameter family of solutions. A natural question is
whether a given general solution contains every particular solution of the differential equa-
tion. When this is known to be true, we call it the general solution of the differential equation.
For example, because any two antiderivatives of the same function f .x/ can differ only by a
constant, it follows that every solution of Eq. (1) is of the form in (2). Thus Eq. (2) serves to
deﬁne the general solution of (1).

Velocity and Acceleration
Direct integration is sufﬁcient to allow us to solve a number of important problems
concerning the motion of a particle (or mass point) in terms of the forces acting
on it. The motion of a particle along a straight line (the x-axis) is described by its
position function
x D f .t/
(5)
giving its x-coordinate at time t. The velocity of the particle is deﬁned to be
v.t/ D f 0.t/I
that is,
v D dx

(6)
Its acceleration a.t/ is a.t/ D v0.t/ D x00.t/; in Leibniz notation,

which you should recognize as a statement of the fundamental theorem of calculus

Newton’s second law of motion says that if a force F.t/ acts on the particle
and is directed along its line of motion, then
ma.t/ D F.t/I

Chapter 1 First-Order Differential Equations
where m is the mass of the particle. If the force F is known, then the equation
x00.t/ D F.t/=m can be integrated twice to ﬁnd the position function x.t/ in terms
of two constants of integration. These two arbitrary constants are frequently deter-
mined by the initial position x0 D x.0/ and the initial velocity v0 D v.0/ of the
particle.
Constant acceleration. For instance, suppose that the force F , and therefore the

(11)
Thus, with Eq. (10) we can ﬁnd the velocity, and with Eq. (11) the position, of
the particle at any time t in terms of its constant acceleration a, its initial velocity
v0, and its initial position x0.
Example 2
A lunar lander is falling freely toward the surface of the moon at a speed of 450 meters per
second (m=s). Its retrorockets, when ﬁred, provide a constant deceleration of 2.5 meters per
second per second (m=s2) (the gravitational acceleration produced by the moon is assumed
to be included in the given deceleration). At what height above the lunar surface should the
retrorockets be activated to ensure a “soft touchdown” (v D 0 at impact)?
Solution
We denote by x.t/ the height of the lunar lander above the surface, as indicated in Fig. 1.2.4.
We let t D 0 denote the time at which the retrorockets should be ﬁred. Then v0 D 450

(m=s, negative because the height x.t/ is decreasing), and a D C2:5, because an upward
thrust increases the velocity v (although it decreases the speed jvj). Then Eqs. (10) and (11)
become
v.t/ D 2:5t  450
(12)
and
x.t/ D 1:25t2  450t C x0;
(13)
where x0 is the height of the lander above the lunar surface at the time t D 0 when the
retrorockets should be activated.
From Eq. (12) we see that v D 0 (soft touchdown) occurs when t D 450=2:5 D 180 s
(that is, 3 minutes); then substitution of t D 180, x D 0 into Eq. (13) yields
x0 D 0  .1:25/.180/2 C 450.180/ D 40;500
meters—that is, x0 D 40.5 km  25 1
6 miles. Thus the retrorockets should be activated when
the lunar lander is 40.5 kilometers above the surface of the moon, and it will touch down
softly on the lunar surface after 3 minutes of decelerating descent.

Physical Units
Numerical work requires units for the measurement of physical quantities such as
distance and time. We sometimes use ad hoc units—such as distance in miles or
kilometers and time in hours—in special situations (such as in a problem involving
an auto trip). However, the foot-pound-second (fps) and meter-kilogram-second
(mks) unit systems are used more generally in scientiﬁc and engineering problems.
In fact, fps units are commonly used only in the United States (and a few other
countries), while mks units constitute the standard international system of scientiﬁc
units.

The last line of this table gives values for the gravitational acceleration g at
the surface of the earth. Although these approximate values will sufﬁce for most
examples and problems, more precise values are 9:7805 m=s2 and 32:088 ft=s2 (at
sea level at the equator).
Both systems are compatible with Newton’s second law F D ma. Thus 1 N is
(by deﬁnition) the force required to impart an acceleration of 1 m=s2 to a mass of 1
kg. Similarly, 1 slug is (by deﬁnition) the mass that experiences an acceleration of
1 ft=s2 under a force of 1 lb. (We will use mks units in all problems requiring mass
units and thus will rarely need slugs to measure mass.)
Inches and centimeters (as well as miles and kilometers) also are commonly
used in describing distances. For conversions between fps and mks units it helps to
remember that
1 in. D 2.54 cm (exactly)
and
1 lb  4.448 N:
For instance,
1 ft D 12 in.  2:54cm
in. D 30.48 cm;
and it follows that
1 mi D 5280 ft  30:48cm
ft D 160934.4 cm  1.609 km:
Thus a posted U.S. speed limit of 50 mi=h means that—in international terms—the
legal speed limit is about 50  1:609  80:45 km=h.
Vertical Motion with Gravitational Acceleration
The weight W of a body is the force exerted on the body by gravity. Substitution of
a D g and F D W in Newton’s second law F D ma gives
W D mg
(14)

14
Chapter 1 First-Order Differential Equations
for the weight W of the mass m at the surface of the earth (where g  32 ft=s2  9:8
m=s2). For instance, a mass of m D 20 kg has a weight of W D (20 kg)(9.8 m=s2) D
196 N. Similarly, a mass m weighing 100 pounds has mks weight
W D (100 lb)(4.448 N=lb) D 444.8 N;
so its mass is
m D W
g D 444.8 N
9.8 m=s2  45.4 kg:
To discuss vertical motion it is natural to choose the y-axis as the coordinate
system for position, frequently with y D 0 corresponding to “ground level.” If we
choose the upward direction as the positive direction, then the effect of gravity on a
vertically moving body is to decrease its height and also to decrease its velocity v D
dy=dt. Consequently, if we ignore air resistance, then the acceleration a D dv=dt of
the body is given by
dv
dt D g:
(15)
This acceleration equation provides a starting point in many problems involving
vertical motion. Successive integrations (as in Eqs. (10) and (11)) yield the velocity
and height formulas
v.t/ D gt C v0
(16)
and
y.t/ D  1
2gt2 C v0t C y0:
(17)
Here, y0 denotes the initial (t D 0) height of the body and v0 its initial velocity.
Example 3
(a) Suppose that a ball is thrown straight upward from the ground (y0 D 0) with initial
velocity v0 D 96 (ft=s, so we use g D 32 ft=s2 in fps units). Then it reaches its maximum
height when its velocity (Eq. (16)) is zero,
v.t/ D 32t C 96 D 0;
and thus when t D 3 s. Hence the maximum height that the ball attains is
y.3/ D  1
2  32  32 C 96  3 C 0 D 144 (ft)
(with the aid of Eq. (17)).
(b) If an arrow is shot straight upward from the ground with initial velocity v0 D 49 (m=s,
so we use g D 9:8 m=s2 in mks units), then it returns to the ground when
y.t/ D  1

Figure 1.2.5 shows a northward-ﬂowing river of width w D 2a. The lines x D ˙a

brakes were fully applied for a distance of 75 m before
it came to a stop. The car in question is known to have
a constant deceleration of 20 m=s2 under these condi-
tions. How fast—in km=h—was the car traveling when
the brakes were ﬁrst applied?
32. Suppose that a car skids 15 m if it is moving at 50 km=h

ﬁre the retrorockets to insure a soft touchdown? (As in
Example 2, ignore the moon’s gravitational ﬁeld.)
43. Arthur Clarke’s The Wind from the Sun (1963) describes
Diana, a spacecraft propelled by the solar wind. Its alu-
minized sail provides it with a constant acceleration of
0:001g D 0:0098 m/s2. Suppose this spacecraft starts from
rest at time t D 0 and simultaneously ﬁres a projectile
(straight ahead in the same direction) that travels at one-
tenth of the speed c D 3  108 m/s of light. How long will
it take the spacecraft to catch up with the projectile, and
how far will it have traveled by then?
44. A driver involved in an accident claims he was going only
25 mph. When police tested his car, they found that when
its brakes were applied at 25 mph, the car skidded only
45 feet before coming to a stop.
But the driver’s skid
marks at the accident scene measured 210 feet. Assum-
ing the same (constant) deceleration, determine the speed
he was actually traveling just prior to the accident.
1.3 Slope Fields and Solution Curves
Consider a differential equation of the form
dy
dx D f .x; y/
(1)
where the right-hand function f .x; y/ involves both the independent variable x and
the dependent variable y. We might think of integrating both sides in (1) with re-
spect to x, and hence write y.x/ D
R
f .x; y.x// dx C C. However, this approach
does not lead to a solution of the differential equation, because the indicated integral
involves the unknown function y.x/ itself, and therefore cannot be evaluated explic-
itly. Actually, there exists no straightforward procedure by which a general differen-
tial equation can be solved explicitly. Indeed, the solutions of such a simple-looking
differential equation as y0 D x2 C y2 cannot be expressed in terms of the ordinary
elementary functions studied in calculus textbooks. Nevertheless, the graphical and
numerical methods of this and later sections can be used to construct approximate
solutions of differential equations that sufﬁce for many practical purposes.
Slope Fields and Graphical Solutions
There is a simple geometric way to think about solutions of a given differential
equation y0 D f .x; y/. At each point .x; y/ of the xy-plane, the value of f .x; y/
determines a slope m D f .x; y/. A solution of the differential equation is simply
a differentiable function whose graph y D y.x/ has this “correct slope” at each

18
Chapter 1 First-Order Differential Equations
point .x; y.x// through which it passes—that is, y0.x/ D f .x; y.x//. Thus a so-
lution curve of the differential equation y0 D f .x; y/—the graph of a solution of
the equation—is simply a curve in the xy-plane whose tangent line at each point
.x; y/ has slope m D f .x; y/. For instance, Fig. 1.3.1 shows a solution curve of
the differential equation y0 D x  y together with its tangent lines at three typical
points.


slope m2 D x2  y2 at the point .x2; y2/; and

slope m3 D x3  y3 at the point .x3; y3/.
This geometric viewpoint suggests a graphical method for constructing ap-
proximate solutions of the differential equation y0 D f .x; y/. Through each of a
representative collection of points .x; y/ in the plane we draw a short line segment
having the proper slope m D f .x; y/. All these line segments constitute a slope
ﬁeld (or a direction ﬁeld) for the equation y0 D f .x; y/.
Example 1
Figures 1.3.2 (a)–(d) show slope ﬁelds and solution curves for the differential equation
dy
dx D ky
(2)
with the values k D 2, 0:5, 1, and 3 of the parameter k in Eq. (2). Note that each slope
ﬁeld yields important qualitative information about the set of all solutions of the differential
equation. For instance, Figs. 1.3.2(a) and (b) suggest that each solution y.x/ approaches ˙1
as x ! C1 if k > 0, whereas Figs. 1.3.2(c) and (d) suggest that y.x/ ! 0 as x ! C1
if k < 0. Moreover, although the sign of k determines the direction of increase or decrease
of y.x/, its absolute value jkj appears to determine the rate of change of y.x/. All this is
apparent from slope ﬁelds like those in Fig. 1.3.2, even without knowing that the general
solution of Eq. (2) is given explicitly by y.x/ D Cekx.
A slope ﬁeld suggests visually the general shapes of solution curves of the
differential equation. Through each point a solution curve should proceed in such
a direction that its tangent line is nearly parallel to the nearby line segments of the
slope ﬁeld. Starting at any initial point .a; b/, we can attempt to sketch freehand an
approximate solution curve that threads its way through the slope ﬁeld, following
the visible line segments as closely as possible.
Example 2
Construct a slope ﬁeld for the differential equation y0 D x  y and use it to sketch an approx-
imate solution curve that passes through the point .4; 4/.
Solution

of slope segments as in Fig. 1.3.4. However, most computer algebra systems in-
clude commands for quick and ready construction of slope ﬁelds with as many line
segments as desired; such commands are illustrated in the application material for
this section. The more line segments are constructed, the more accurately solution
curves can be visualized and sketched. Figure 1.3.6 shows a “ﬁner” slope ﬁeld for
the differential equation y0 D x  y of Example 2, together with typical solution
curves treading through this slope ﬁeld.
If you look closely at Fig. 1.3.6, you may spot a solution curve that appears
to be a straight line! Indeed, you can verify that the linear function y D x  1 is
a solution of the equation y0 D x  y, and it appears likely that the other solution
curves approach this straight line as an asymptote as x ! C1. This inference
illustrates the fact that a slope ﬁeld can suggest tangible information about solutions
that is not at all evident from the differential equation itself. Can you, by tracing the
appropriate solution curve in this ﬁgure, infer that y.3/  2 for the solution y.x/ of
the initial value problem y0 D x  y, y.4/ D 4?

Applications of Slope Fields
The next two examples illustrate the use of slope ﬁelds to glean useful information
in physical situations that are modeled by differential equations. Example 3 is based
on the fact that a baseball moving through the air at a moderate speed v (less than
about 300 ft/s) encounters air resistance that is approximately proportional to v. If
the baseball is thrown straight downward from the top of a tall building or from a
hovering helicopter, then it experiences both the downward acceleration of gravity
and an upward acceleration of air resistance. If the y-axis is directed downward,
then the ball’s velocity v D dy=dt and its gravitational acceleration g D 32 ft/s2 are
both positive, while its acceleration due to air resistance is negative. Hence its total
acceleration is of the form
dv
dt D g  kv:
(3)
A typical value of the air resistance proportionality constant might be k D 0:16.
Example 3
Suppose you throw a baseball straight downward from a helicopter hovering at an altitude of
3000 feet. You wonder whether someone standing on the ground below could conceivably
catch it. In order to estimate the speed with which the ball will land, you can use your laptop’s

The result is shown in Fig. 1.3.7, together with a number of solution curves correspond-
ing to different values of the initial velocity v.0/ with which you might throw the baseball
downward. Note that all these solution curves appear to approach the horizontal line v D 200
as an asymptote. This implies that—however you throw it—the baseball should approach the
limiting velocity v D 200 ft/s instead of accelerating indeﬁnitely (as it would in the absence
of any air resistance). The handy fact that 60 mi/h D 88 ft/s yields
v D 200ft

88 ft/s  136.36 mi
h :
Perhaps a catcher accustomed to 100 mi/h fastballs would have some chance of ﬁelding this
speeding ball.
Comment
If the ball’s initial velocity is v.0/ D 200, then Eq. (4) gives v0.0/ D 32 
.0:16/.200/ D 0, so the ball experiences no initial acceleration. Its velocity therefore remains
unchanged, and hence v.t/  200 is a constant “equilibrium solution” of the differential
equation. If the initial velocity is greater than 200, then the initial acceleration given by
Eq. (4) is negative, so the ball slows down as it falls. But if the initial velocity is less than

1.3 Slope Fields and Solution Curves
21
200, then the initial acceleration given by (4) is positive, so the ball speeds up as it falls. It
therefore seems quite reasonable that, because of air resistance, the baseball will approach a
limiting velocity of 200 ft/s—whatever initial velocity it starts with. You might like to verify
that—in the absence of air resistance—this ball would hit the ground at over 300 mi/h.
In Section 2.1 we will discuss in detail the logistic differential equation
dP
dt D kP.M  P /
(5)
that often is used to model a population P.t/ that inhabits an environment with
carrying capacity M. This means that M is the maximum population that this
environment can sustain on a long-term basis (in terms of the maximum available
food, for instance).
Example 4
If we take k D 0:0004 and M D 150, then the logistic equation in (5) takes the form
dP
dt D 0:0004P.150  P / D 0:06P  0:0004P 2:

(with time t measured in years). The negative term 0:0004P 2 represents the inhibition of
growth due to limited resources in the environment.
Figure 1.3.8 shows a slope ﬁeld for Eq. (6), together with a number of solution curves
corresponding to possible different values of the initial population P.0/. Note that all these
solution curves appear to approach the horizontal line P D 150 as an asymptote. This implies
that—whatever the initial population—the population P.t/ approaches the limiting popula-
tion P D 150 as t ! 1.
Comment
If the initial population is P.0/ D 150, then Eq. (6) gives
P 0.0/ D 0:0004.150/.150  150/ D 0;
so the population experiences no initial (instantaneous) change. It therefore remains un-
changed, and hence P.t/  150 is a constant “equilibrium solution” of the differential equa-
tion. If the initial population is greater than 150, then the initial rate of change given by (6)
is negative, so the population immediately begins to decrease. But if the initial population is
less than 150, then the initial rate of change given by (6) is positive, so the population imme-
diately begins to increase. It therefore seems quite reasonable to conclude that the population
will approach a limiting value of 150—whatever the (positive) initial population.
Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions
Before one spends much time attempting to solve a given differential equation, it
is wise to know that solutions actually exist. We may also want to know whether
there is only one solution of the equation satisfying a given initial condition—that
is, whether its solutions are unique.
Example 5
(a) [Failure of existence] The initial value problem
y0 D 1
x ;
y.0/ D 0
(7)
has no solution, because no solution y.x/ D
R
.1=x/ dx D ln jxjCC of the differential equation
is deﬁned at x D 0. We see this graphically in Fig. 1.3.9, which shows a direction ﬁeld and
some typical solution curves for the equation y0 D 1=x. It is apparent that the indicated
direction ﬁeld “forces” all solution curves near the y-axis to plunge downward so that none
can pass through the point .0; 0/.

y.0/ D 0
(8)
has the two different solutions y1.x/ D x2 and y2.x/  0 (see Problem 27). Figure 1.3.10
shows a direction ﬁeld and these two different solution curves for the initial value problem in
(8). We see that the curve y1.x/ D x2 threads its way through the indicated direction ﬁeld,
whereas the differential equation y0 D 2py speciﬁes slope y0 D 0 along the x-axis y2.x/ D 0.
Example 5 illustrates the fact that, before we can speak of “the” solution of
an initial value problem, we need to know that it has one and only one solution.
Questions of existence and uniqueness of solutions also bear on the process of
mathematical modeling. Suppose that we are studying a physical system whose be-
havior is completely determined by certain initial conditions, but that our proposed
mathematical model involves a differential equation not having a unique solution
satisfying those conditions. This raises an immediate question as to whether the
mathematical model adequately represents the physical system.
The theorem stated below implies that the initial value problem y0 D f .x; y/,
y.a/ D b has one and only one solution deﬁned near the point x D a on the x-axis,
provided that both the function f and its partial derivative @f=@y are continuous
near the point .a; b/ in the xy-plane. Methods of proving existence and uniqueness
theorems are discussed in the Appendix.

THEOREM 1
Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions
Suppose that both the function f .x; y/ and its partial derivative Dyf .x; y/ are
continuous on some rectangle R in the xy-plane that contains the point .a; b/
in its interior. Then, for some open interval I containing the point a, the initial
value problem
dy
dx D f .x; y/;
y.a/ D b
(9)
has one and only one solution that is deﬁned on the interval I. (As illustrated in
Fig. 1.3.11, the solution interval I may not be as “wide” as the original rectangle
R of continuity; see Remark 3 below.)
Remark 1
In the case of the differential equation dy=dx D y of Example 1 and
Fig. 1.3.2(c), both the function f .x; y/ D y and the partial derivative @f=@y D 1 are con-

1.3 Slope Fields and Solution Curves
23
tinuous everywhere, so Theorem 1 implies the existence of a unique solution for any initial
data .a; b/. Although the theorem ensures existence only on some open interval containing
x D a, each solution y.x/ D Cex actually is deﬁned for all x.
Remark 2
In the case of the differential equation dy=dx D 2py of Example 5(b) and
Eq. (8), the function f .x; y/ D 2py is continuous wherever y > 0, but the partial derivative
@f=@y D 1=py is discontinuous when y D 0, and hence at the point .0; 0/. This is why it is
possible for there to exist two different solutions y1.x/ D x2 and y2.x/  0, each of which
satisﬁes the initial condition y.0/ D 0.
Remark 3
In Example 7 of Section 1.1 we examined the especially simple differential
equation dy=dx D y2. Here we have f .x; y/ D y2 and @f=@y D 2y. Both of these functions
are continuous everywhere in the xy-plane, and in particular on the rectangle 2 < x < 2,
0 < y < 2. Because the point .0; 1/ lies in the interior of this rectangle, Theorem 1 guarantees
a unique solution—necessarily a continuous function—of the initial value problem
dy
dx D y2;
y.0/ D 1
(10)
on some open x-interval containing a D 0. Indeed this is the solution
y.x/ D
1
1  x
that we discussed in Example 7. But y.x/ D 1=.1x/ is discontinuous at x D 1, so our unique
continuous solution does not exist on the entire interval 2 < x < 2. Thus the solution interval
I of Theorem 1 may not be as wide as the rectangle R where f and @f=@y are continuous.
Geometrically, the reason is that the solution curve provided by the theorem may leave the
rectangle—wherein solutions of the differential equation are guaranteed to exist—before it
reaches the one or both ends of the interval (see Fig. 1.3.12).

The following example shows that, if the function f .x; y/ and/or its partial
derivative @f=@y fail to satisfy the continuity hypothesis of Theorem 1, then the
initial value problem in (9) may have either no solution or many—even inﬁnitely
many—solutions.

Consider the ﬁrst-order differential equation

must have a unique solution near any point in the xy-plane where x 6D 0. Indeed, we see
immediately by substitution in (11) that
y.x/ D Cx2
(12)
satisﬁes Eq. (11) for any value of the constant C and for all values of the variable x. In
particular, the initial value problem
x dy
dx D 2y;
y.0/ D 0
(13)
has inﬁnitely many different solutions, whose solution curves are the parabolas y D Cx2
illustrated in Fig. 1.3.13. (In case C D 0 the “parabola” is actually the x-axis y D 0.)
Observe that all these parabolas pass through the origin .0; 0/, but none of them passes
through any other point on the y-axis. It follows that the initial value problem in (13) has
inﬁnitely many solutions, but the initial value problem
x dy
dx D 2y;
y.0/ D b
(14)
has no solution if b 6D 0.

24
Chapter 1 First-Order Differential Equations
Finally, note that through any point off the y-axis there passes only one of the parabolas
y D Cx2. Hence, if a 6D 0, then the initial value problem
x dy
dx D 2y;
y.a/ D b
(15)
has a unique solution on any interval that contains the point x D a but not the origin x D 0.
In summary, the initial value problem in (15) has

a unique solution near .a; b/ if a 6D 0;

no solution if a D 0 but b 6D 0;

inﬁnitely many solutions if a D b D 0.
Still more can be said about the initial value problem in (15). Consider a
typical initial point off the y-axis—for instance the point .1; 1/ indicated in Fig.
1.3.14. Then for any value of the constant C the function deﬁned by
y.x/ D

half of the parabola y D x2 and the right half of the parabola y D Cx2. Thus the
unique solution curve near .1; 1/ branches at the origin into the inﬁnitely many
solution curves illustrated in Fig. 1.3.14.
We therefore see that Theorem 1 (if its hypotheses are satisﬁed) guarantees
uniqueness of the solution near the initial point .a; b/, but a solution curve through
.a; b/ may eventually branch elsewhere so that uniqueness is lost. Thus a solution
may exist on a larger interval than one on which the solution is unique. For instance,
the solution y.x/ D x2 of the initial value problem in (17) exists on the whole x-axis,
but this solution is unique only on the negative x-axis 1 < x < 0.

open interval I containing the point x D a and, moreover, that
if in addition the partial derivative @f=@y is continuous near
.a; b/, then this solution is unique on some (perhaps smaller)
interval J. In Problems 11 through 20, determine whether ex-

lem is thereby guaranteed and, if so, whether uniqueness of
that solution is guaranteed.

do some graphing calculators (see Figs. 1.3.27–29).
The applications manual accompanying this textbook includes discussion of
MapleTM, MathematicaTM, and MATLABTM resources for the investigation of dif-
ferential equations. For instance, the Maple command
with(DEtools):
DEplot(diff(y(x),x)=sin(x--y(x)), y(x), x=--5..5, y=--5..5);
and the Mathematica command
VectorPlot[{1, Sin[x--y]}, {x, --5, 5}, {y, --5, 5}]
produce slope ﬁelds similar to the one shown in Fig. 1.3.29.
Figure 1.3.29 it-
self was generated with the MATLAB program dfield [John Polking and David
Arnold, Ordinary Differential Equations Using MATLAB, 3rd edition, Upper Sad-
dle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2003] that is freely available for educational use
(math.rice.edu/dfield). This web site also provides a stand-alone Java ver-
sion of dfield that can be used in a web browser. When a differential equation is
entered in the dfield setup menu (Fig. 1.3.30), you can (with mouse button clicks)
plot both a slope ﬁeld and the solution curve (or curves) through any desired point
(or points). Another freely available and user-friendly MATLAB-based ODE pack-
age with impressive graphical capabilities is Iode (www.math.uiuc.edu/iode).

1.4 Separable Equations and Applications
In the preceding sections we saw that if the function f .x; y/ does not involve the
variable y, then solving the ﬁrst-order differential equation
dy
dx D f .x; y/
(1)
is a matter of simply ﬁnding an antiderivative. For example, the general solution of
dy
dx D 6x
(2)
is given by
y.x/ D
Z
6x dx D 3x2 C C:
If instead f .x; y/ does involve the dependent variable y, then we can no longer
solve the equation merely by integrating both sides: The differential equation
dy
dx D 6xy
(3a)
differs from Eq. (2) only in the factor y appearing on the right-hand side, but this
is enough to prevent us from using the same approach to solve Eq. (3a) that was
successful with Eq. (2).
And yet, as we will see throughout the remainder of this chapter, differential
equations like (3a) often can, in fact, be solved by methods which are based on the
idea of “integrating both sides.” The idea behind these techniques is to rewrite the
given equation in a form that, while equivalent to the given equation, allows both
sides to be integrated directly, thus leading to the solution of the original differential
equation.
The most basic of these methods, separation of variables, can be applied to
Eq. (3a). First, we note that the right-hand function f .x; y/ D 6xy can be viewed
as the product of two expressions, one involving only the independent variable x,
and the other involving only the dependent variable y:
dy
dx D .6x/  y:
(3b)
Next, we informally break up the derivative dy=dx into the “free-ﬂoating” differen-
tials dx and dy—a notational convenience that leads to correct results, as we will
see below—and then multiply by dx and divide by y in Eq. (3b), leading to
dy
y D 6x dx:
(3c)

1.4 Separable Equations and Applications
31
Equation (3c) is an equivalent version of the original differential equation in (3a),
but with the variables x and y separated (that is, by the equal sign), and this is what
allows us to integrate both sides. The left-hand side is integrated with respect to y
(with no “interference” from the variable x), and vice versa for the right-hand side.
This leads to
Z dy
y D
Z
6x dx;
or
ln jyj D 3x2 C C:
(4)
This gives the general solution of Eq. (3a) implicitly, and a family of solution curves
is shown in Fig. 1.4.1.
In this particular case we can go on to solve for y to give the explicit general
solution
y.x/ D ˙e3x2CC D ˙e3x2eC D Ae3x2;
(5)
where A represents the constant ˙eC, which can take on any nonzero value. If we

impose an initial condition on Eq. (3a), say y.0/ D 7, then in Eq. (5) we ﬁnd that
A D 7, yielding the particular solution
y.x/ D 7e3x2;
which is the upper emphasized solution curve shown in Fig. 1.4.1. In the same way,
the initial condition y.0/ D 4 leads to the particular solution
y.x/ D 4e3x2;
which is the lower emphasized solution curve shown in Fig. 1.4.1.
To complete this example, we note that whereas the constant A in Eq. (5) is
nonzero, taking A D 0 in (5) leads to y.x/  0, and this is, in fact, a solution of the
given differential equation (3a). Thus Eq. (5) actually provides a solution of (3a)
for all values of the constant A, including A D 0. Why did the method of separation
of variables fail to capture all solutions of Eq. (3a)? The reason is that in the step
in which we actually separated the variables, that is, in passing from Eq. (3b) to
(3c), we divided by y, thus (tacitly) assuming that y 6D 0. As a result, our general
solution (5), with its restriction that A 6D 0, “missed” the particular solution y.x/  0
corresponding to A D 0. Such solutions are known as singular solutions, and we
say more about them—together with implicit and general solutions—below.
In general, the ﬁrst-order differential equation (1) is called separable provided
that f .x; y/ can be written as the product of a function of x and a function of y:
dy
dx D f .x; y/ D g.x/k.y/ D g.x/
h.y/;
where h.y/ D 1=k.y/. In this case the variables x and y can be separated—isolated
on opposite sides of an equation—by writing informally the equation
h.y/ dy D g.x/ dx;
which we understand to be concise notation for the differential equation
h.y/ dy
dx D g.x/:
(6)

32
Chapter 1 First-Order Differential Equations
(In the preceding example, h.y/ D 1
y and g.x/ D 6x.) As illustrated above, we can
solve this type of differential equation simply by integrating both sides with respect
to x:
Z
h.y.x// dy
dx dx D
Z
g.x/ dx C CI
equivalently,
Z
h.y/ dy D
Z
g.x/ dx C C:
(7)
All that is required is that the antiderivatives
H.y/ D
Z
h.y/ dy
and
G.x/ D
Z
g.x/ dx
can be found. To see that Eqs. (6) and (7) are equivalent, note the following conse-
quence of the chain rule:
DxŒH.y.x// D H 0.y.x//y0.x/ D h.y/ dy
dx D g.x/ D DxŒG.x/;
which in turn is equivalent to
H.y.x// D G.x/ C C;
(8)
because two functions have the same derivative on an interval if and only if they
differ by a constant on that interval.

is separable, and thus we can proceed in much the same way as in Eq. (3a). Before doing
so, however, we note an important feature of Eq. (9) not shared by Eq. (3a): The function
k.y/ D
1
3y2  5 is not deﬁned for all values of y. Indeed, setting 3y2  5 equal to zero shows
that k.y/, and thus dy
dx itself, becomes inﬁnite as y approaches either of ˙
q
5
3. Because
an inﬁnite slope corresponds to a vertical line segment, we would therefore expect the line
segments in the slope ﬁeld for this differential equation to be “standing straight up” along
the two horizontal lines y D ˙
q
5
3  ˙1:29; as Fig. 1.4.2 shows (where these two lines are
dashed), this is indeed what we ﬁnd.
What this means for the differential equation (9) is that no solution curve of this equa-
tion can cross either of the horizontal lines y D ˙
q
5
3 , simply because along these lines dy
dx
is undeﬁned. Effectively, then, these lines divide the plane into three regions—deﬁned by the
conditions y >

3, and y < 

3—with all solution curves of Eq. (9)
remaining conﬁned to one of these regions.
With this in mind, the general solution of the differential equation in Eq. (9) is easy to
ﬁnd, at least in implicit form. Separating variables and integrating both sides leads to
Z
3y2  5 dy D
Z

1.4 Separable Equations and Applications
33
and thus
y3  5y D 4x  x2 C C:
(10)
Note that unlike Eq. (4), the general solution in Eq. (10) cannot readily be solved for y; thus
we cannot directly plot the solution curves of Eq. (9) in the form y D y.x/, as we would
like. However, what we can do is rearrange Eq. (10) so that the constant C is isolated on the
right-hand side:
y3  5y  .4x  x2/ D C:
(11)
This shows that the solution curves of the differential equation in Eq. (9) are contained in the
level curves (also known as contours) of the function
F.x; y/ D y3  5y  .4x  x2/:
(12)
Because no particular solution curve of Eq. (9) can cross either of the lines y D ˙
q
5

despite the fact that the level curves of F.x; y/ freely do so—the particular solution curves
of Eq. (9) are those portions of the level curves of F.x; y/ which avoid the lines y D ˙
q
5
3.
For example, suppose that we wish to solve the initial value problem
dy
dx D 4  2x
3y2  5;
y.1/ D 3:
(13)
Substituting x D 1 and y D 3 into our general solution (10) gives C D 9. Therefore our
desired solution curve lies on the level curve
y3  5y  .4x  x2/ D 9
(14)
of F.x; y/; Fig. 1.4.2 shows this and other level curves of F.x; y/. However, because the
solution curve of the initial value problem (13) must pass through the point .1; 3/, which lies
above the line y D
q
5
3 in the xy-plane, our desired solution curve is restricted to that portion
of the level curve (14) which satisﬁes y >
q
5
3. (In Fig. 1.4.2 the solution curve of the initial
value problem (13) is drawn more heavily than the remainder of the level curve (14).) In the
same way, Figure 1.4.2 also shows the particular solutions of Eq. (9) subject to the initial
conditions y.1/ D 0 and y.1/ D 2. In each of these cases, the curve corresponding to the
desired particular solution is only a piece of a larger level curve of the function F.x; y/. (Note
that in fact, some of the level curves of F themselves consist of two pieces.)

nonetheless “solve” for y in the sense that, when a speciﬁc value of x is substituted in (14),
we can attempt to solve numerically for y. For instance, taking x D 4 yields the equation
f .y/ D y3  5y  9 D 0I
Fig. 1.4.3 shows the graph of f . Using technology we can solve for the single real root
y  2:8552, thus yielding the value y.4/  2:8552 for the solution of the initial value problem
(13). By repeating this process for other values of x, we can create a table (like the one
shown below) of corresponding x- and y-values for the solution of (13); such a table serves
effectively as a “numerical solution” of this initial value problem.

Implicit, General, and Singular Solutions
The equation K.x; y/ D 0 is commonly called an implicit solution of a differential
equation if it is satisﬁed (on some interval) by some solution y D y.x/ of the differ-
ential equation. But note that a particular solution y D y.x/ of K.x; y/ D 0 may or

34
Chapter 1 First-Order Differential Equations
may not satisfy a given initial condition. For example, differentiation of x2 Cy2 D 4
yields
x C y dy
dx D 0;
so x2 C y2 D 4 is an implicit solution of the differential equation x C yy0 D 0. But
only the ﬁrst of the two explicit solutions
y.x/ D C
p
4  x2
and
y.x/ D 

satisﬁes the initial condition y.0/ D 2 (Fig. 1.4.4).

Remark 1
You should not assume that every possible algebraic solution y D y.x/ of
an implicit solution satisﬁes the same differential equation. For instance, if we multiply the
implicit solution x2 C y2  4 D 0 by the factor .y  2x/, then we get the new implicit solution
.y  2x/.x2 C y2  4/ D 0
that yields (or “contains”) not only the previously noted explicit solutions y D C
p
4  x2
and y D 
p
4  x2 of the differential equation x C yy0 D 0, but also the additional function
y D 2x that does not satisfy this differential equation.
Remark 2
Similarly, solutions of a given differential equation can be either gained or lost
when it is multiplied or divided by an algebraic factor. For instance, consider the differential
equation
.y  2x/y dy
dx D x.y  2x/
(15)
having the obvious solution y D 2x. But if we divide both sides by the common factor
.y  2x/, then we get the previously discussed differential equation
y dy
dx D x;
or
x C y dy
dx D 0;
(16)
of which y D 2x is not a solution. Thus we “lose” the solution y D 2x of Eq. (15) upon its
division by the factor .y  2x/; alternatively, we “gain” this new solution when we multiply
Eq. (16) by .y  2x/. Such elementary algebraic operations to simplify a given differential
equation before attempting to solve it are common in practice, but the possibility of loss or
gain of such “extraneous solutions” should be kept in mind.
A solution of a differential equation that contains an “arbitrary constant” (like
the constant C appearing in Eqs. (4) and (10)) is commonly called a general so-
lution of the differential equation; any particular choice of a speciﬁc value for C
yields a single particular solution of the equation.
The argument preceding Example 1 actually sufﬁces to show that every partic-
ular solution of the differential equation h.y/y0 D g.x/ in (6) satisﬁes the equation
H.y.x// D G.x/ C C in (8). Consequently, it is appropriate to call (8) not merely a
general solution of (6), but the general solution of (6).
In Section 1.5 we shall see that every particular solution of a linear ﬁrst-order
differential equation is contained in its general solution. By contrast, it is com-
mon for a nonlinear ﬁrst-order differential equation to have both a general solu-
tion involving an arbitrary constant C and one or several particular solutions that
cannot be obtained by selecting a value for C. These exceptional solutions are
frequently called singular solutions. In Problem 30 we ask you to show that the
general solution of the differential equation .y0/2 D 4y yields the family of parabo-
las y D .x  C/2 illustrated in Fig. 1.4.5, and to observe that the constant-valued
function y.x/  0 is a singular solution that cannot be obtained from the general
solution by any choice of the arbitrary constant C.

serves as a mathematical model for a remarkably wide range of natural
phenomena—any involving a quantity whose time rate of change is proportional
to its current size. Here are some examples.
POPULATION GROWTH:
Suppose that P.t/ is the number of individuals in a
population (of humans, or insects, or bacteria) having constant birth and death rates
ˇ and ı (in births or deaths per individual per unit of time). Then, during a short
time interval t, approximately ˇP.t/ t births and ıP.t/ t deaths occur, so the
change in P.t/ is given approximately by

an annual interest rate r. (Note that 10% annual interest means that r D 0:10.)
Continuous compounding means that during a short time interval t, the amount of

RADIOACTIVE DECAY:
Consider a sample of material that contains N.t/ atoms
of a certain radioactive isotope at time t. It has been observed that a constant fraction
of those radioactive atoms will spontaneously decay (into atoms of another element
or into another isotope of the same element) during each unit of time. Consequently,
the sample behaves exactly like a population with a constant death rate and no births.
To write a model for N.t/, we use Eq. (18) with N in place of P , with k > 0 in place
of ı, and with ˇ D 0. We thus get the differential equation
dN
dt D kN:
(20)
The value of k depends on the particular radioactive isotope.
The key to the method of radiocarbon dating is that a constant proportion
of the carbon atoms in any living creature is made up of the radioactive isotope
14C of carbon. This proportion remains constant because the fraction of 14C in the
atmosphere remains almost constant, and living matter is continuously taking up
carbon from the air or is consuming other living matter containing the same constant
ratio of 14C atoms to ordinary 12C atoms. This same ratio permeates all life, because
organic processes seem to make no distinction between the two isotopes.
The ratio of 14C to normal carbon remains constant in the atmosphere be-
cause, although 14C is radioactive and slowly decays, the amount is continuously
replenished through the conversion of 14N (ordinary nitrogen) to 14C by cosmic
rays bombarding the upper atmosphere. Over the long history of the planet, this
decay and replenishment process has come into nearly steady state.
Of course, when a living organism dies, it ceases its metabolism of carbon
and the process of radioactive decay begins to deplete its 14C content. There is
no replenishment of this 14C, and consequently the ratio of 14C to normal carbon
begins to drop. By measuring this ratio, the amount of time elapsed since the death
of the organism can be estimated. For such purposes it is necessary to measure the
decay constant k. For 14C, it is known that k  0:0001216 if t is measured in years.
(Matters are not as simple as we have made them appear. In applying the tech-
nique of radiocarbon dating, extreme care must be taken to avoid contaminating the
sample with organic matter or even with ordinary fresh air. In addition, the cosmic
ray levels apparently have not been constant, so the ratio of 14C in the atmosphere
has varied over the past centuries. By using independent methods of dating sam-
ples, researchers in this area have compiled tables of correction factors to enhance
the accuracy of this process.)
DRUG ELIMINATION:
In many cases the amount A.t/ of a certain drug in the
bloodstream, measured by the excess over the natural level of the drug, will decline
at a rate proportional to the current excess amount. That is,
dA
dt D A;
(21)
where  > 0. The parameter  is called the elimination constant of the drug.
The Natural Growth Equation
The prototype differential equation dx=dt D kx with x.t/ > 0 and k a con-
stant (either negative or positive) is readily solved by separating the variables and
integrating:
Z 1
x dx D
Z
k dtI
ln x D kt C C:

1.4 Separable Equations and Applications
37
Then we solve for x:
eln x D ektCC I
x D x.t/ D eC ekt D Aekt:
Because C is a constant, so is A D eC. It is also clear that A D x.0/ D x0, so the
particular solution of Eq. (17) with the initial condition x.0/ D x0 is simply
x.t/ D x0ekt:
(22)
Because of the presence of the natural exponential function in its solution, the
differential equation
dx
dt D kx
(23)
is often called the exponential or natural growth equation. Figure 1.4.7 shows a
typical graph of x.t/ in the case k > 0; the case k < 0 is illustrated in Fig. 1.4.8.

Example 3
According to data listed at www.census.gov, the world’s total population reached 6 bil-
lion persons in mid-1999, and was then increasing at the rate of about 212 thousand persons
each day. Assuming that natural population growth at this rate continues, we want to answer
these questions:
(a) What is the annual growth rate k?
(b) What will be the world population at the middle of the 21st century?
(c) How long will it take the world population to increase tenfold—thereby reaching the 60
billion that some demographers believe to be the maximum for which the planet can provide
adequate food supplies?
Solution
(a) We measure the world population P.t/ in billions and measure time in years. We take
t D 0 to correspond to (mid) 1999, so P0 D 6. The fact that P is increasing by 212,000, or
0.000212 billion, persons per day at time t D 0 means that
P 0.0/ D .0:000212/.365:25/  0:07743
billion per year. From the natural growth equation P 0 D kP with t D 0 we now obtain
k D P 0.0/
P.0/  0:07743

 0:0129:
Thus the world population was growing at the rate of about 1.29% annually in 1999. This
value of k gives the world population function
P.t/ D 6e0:0129t:
(b) With t D 51 we obtain the prediction
P.51/ D 6e.0:0129/.51/  11.58 (billion)
for the world population in mid-2050 (so the population will almost have doubled in the just
over a half-century since 1999).

38
Chapter 1 First-Order Differential Equations
(c) The world population should reach 60 billion when
60 D 6e0:0129tI
that is, when t D ln 10
0:0129  178;
and thus in the year 2177.
Note
Actually, the rate of growth of the world population is expected to slow somewhat
during the next half-century, and the best current prediction for the 2050 population is “only”
9.1 billion. A simple mathematical model cannot be expected to mirror precisely the com-
plexity of the real world.
The decay constant of a radioactive isotope is often speciﬁed in terms of an-
other empirical constant, the half-life of the isotope, because this parameter is more
convenient. The half-life  of a radioactive isotope is the time required for half of
it to decay. To ﬁnd the relationship between k and , we set t D  and N D 1
2N0 in
the equation N.t/ D N0ekt, so that 1
2N0 D N0ek. When we solve for , we ﬁnd
that
 D ln 2
k :
(24)
For example, the half-life of 14C is   .ln 2/=.0:0001216/, approximately 5700
years.
Example 4
A specimen of charcoal found at Stonehenge turns out to contain 63% as much 14C as a
sample of present-day charcoal of equal mass. What is the age of the sample?
Solution
We take t D 0 as the time of the death of the tree from which the Stonehenge charcoal was
made and N0 as the number of 14C atoms that the Stonehenge sample contained then. We are
given that N D .0:63/N0 now, so we solve the equation .0:63/N0 D N0ekt with the value
k D 0:0001216. Thus we ﬁnd that
t D  ln.0:63/
0:0001216  3800 (years):
Thus the sample is about 3800 years old. If it has any connection with the builders of Stone-
henge, our computations suggest that this observatory, monument, or temple—whichever it
may be—dates from 1800 B.C. or earlier.
Cooling and Heating
According to Newton’s law of cooling (Eq. (3) of Section 1.1), the time rate of
change of the temperature T .t/ of a body immersed in a medium of constant tem-
perature A is proportional to the difference A  T . That is,
dT
dt D k.A  T /;
(25)
where k is a positive constant. This is an instance of the linear ﬁrst-order differential
equation with constant coefﬁcients:
dx
dt D ax C b:
(26)
It includes the exponential equation as a special case (b D 0) and is also easy to
solve by separation of variables.
Example 5
A 4-lb roast, initially at 50ıF, is placed in a 375ıF oven at 5:00 P.M. After 75 minutes it is
found that the temperature T .t/ of the roast is 125ıF. When will the roast be 150ıF (medium
rare)?

1.4 Separable Equations and Applications
39
Solution
We take time t in minutes, with t D 0 corresponding to 5:00 P.M. We also assume (somewhat
unrealistically) that at any instant the temperature T .t/ of the roast is uniform throughout.
We have T .t/ < A D 375, T .0/ D 50, and T .75/ D 125. Hence

Now T .0/ D 50 implies that B D 325, so T .t/ D 375  325ekt. We also know that T D 125
when t D 75. Substitution of these values in the preceding equation yields

roast was placed in the oven at 5:00 P.M., it should be removed at about 6:45 P.M.
Torricelli’s Law
Suppose that a water tank has a hole with area a at its bottom, from which water
is leaking. Denote by y.t/ the depth of water in the tank at time t, and by V.t/ the
volume of water in the tank then. It is plausible—and true, under ideal conditions—
that the velocity of water exiting through the hole is
v D
p
2gy;
(27)
which is the velocity a drop of water would acquire in falling freely from the surface
of the water to the hole (see Problem 35 of Section 1.2). One can derive this formula
beginning with the assumption that the sum of the kinetic and potential energy of the
system remains constant. Under real conditions, taking into account the constriction
of a water jet from an oriﬁce, v D cp2gy, where c is an empirical constant between
0 and 1 (usually about 0.6 for a small continuous stream of water). For simplicity
we take c D 1 in the following discussion.
As a consequence of Eq. (27), we have

This is a statement of Torricelli’s law for a draining tank. Let A.y/ denote the hori-
zontal cross-sectional area of the tank at height y. Then, applied to a thin horizontal
slice of water at height y with area A.y/ and thickness dy, the integral calculus
method of cross sections gives
V.y/ D

The fundamental theorem of calculus therefore implies that dV=dy D A.y/ and
hence that

rived from a single original language and that a language
family develops into 1.5 language families every 6 thou-
sand years. About how long ago was the single original

53. Thousands of years ago ancestors of the Native Americans
crossed the Bering Strait from Asia and entered the west-
ern hemisphere. Since then, they have fanned out across
North and South America. The single language that the
original Native Americans spoke has since split into many
Indian “language families.” Assume (as in Problem 52)
that the number of these language families has been mul-
tiplied by 1.5 every 6000 years. There are now 150 Native
American language families in the western hemisphere.

54. A tank is shaped like a vertical cylinder; it initially con-
tains water to a depth of 9 ft, and a bottom plug is removed
at time t D 0 (hours). After 1 h the depth of the water has
dropped to 4 ft. How long does it take for all the water to
drain from the tank?
55. Suppose that the tank of Problem 54 has a radius of 3 ft
and that its bottom hole is circular with radius 1 in. How

the tank be empty?
59. A water tank has the shape obtained by revolving the

drain completely?
61. A spherical tank of radius 4 ft is full of water when a cir-

80ıF and at 1 P.M. it is 75ıF. Assume that the temperature

66. Early one morning it began to snow at a constant rate. At
7 A.M. a snowplow set off to clear a road. By 8 A.M. it
had traveled 2 miles, but it took two more hours (until
10 A.M.) for the snowplow to go an additional 2 miles.
(a) Let t D 0 when it began to snow, and let x denote the
distance traveled by the snowplow at time t. Assuming

pose now that by 8 A.M. it had traveled 4 miles and that by
9 A.M. it had moved an additional 3 miles. What time did
it start snowing? This is a more difﬁcult snowplow prob-
lem because now a transcendental equation must be solved
numerically to ﬁnd the value of k. (Answer: 4:27 A.M.)
68. Figure 1.4.11 shows a bead sliding down a frictionless
wire from point P to point Q. The brachistochrone prob-
lem asks what shape the wire should be in order to min-
imize the bead’s time of descent from P to Q. In June
of 1696, John Bernoulli proposed this problem as a pub-
lic challenge, with a 6-month deadline (later extended to
Easter 1697 at George Leibniz’s request). Isaac Newton,
then retired from academic life and serving as Warden
of the Mint in London, received Bernoulli’s challenge on
January 29, 1697. The very next day he communicated
his own solution—the curve of minimal descent time is an
arc of an inverted cycloid—to the Royal Society of Lon-
don. For a modern derivation of this result, suppose the
bead starts from rest at the origin P and let y D y.x/ be
the equation of the desired curve in a coordinate system
with the y-axis pointing downward. Then a mechanical
analogue of Snell’s law in optics implies that

1.4 Application The Logistic Equation
As in Eq. (7) of this section, the solution of a separable differential equation reduces
to the evaluation of two indeﬁnite integrals. It is tempting to use a symbolic algebra
system for this purpose. We illustrate this approach using the logistic differential
equation
dx
dt D ax  bx2
(1)
that models a population x.t/ with births (per unit time) proportional to x and deaths
proportional to x2. Here we concentrate on the solution of Eq. (1) and defer discus-
sion of population applications to Section 2.1.
If a D 0:01 and b D 0:0001, for instance, Eq. (1) is

order) in your student ID number.

number of solution curves that you can see what happens to the population as
t ! C1. State your inference plainly.
(b) Next use a computer algebra system to solve the differential equation symboli-
cally; then use the symbolic solution to ﬁnd the limit of x.t/ as t ! C1. Was
your graphically-based inference correct?
(c) Finally, state and solve a numerical problem using the symbolic solution. For
instance, how long does it take x to grow from a selected initial value x0 to a
given target value x1?
1.5 Linear First-Order Equations
We turn now to another important method for solving ﬁrst-order differential equa-
tions that rests upon the idea of “integrating both sides”. In Section 1.4 we saw that
the ﬁrst step in solving a separable differential equation is to multiply and/or divide
both sides of the equation by whatever is required in order to separate the variables.
For instance, to solve the equation
dy
dx D 2xy
.y > 0/;
(1)
we divide both sides by y (and, so to speak, multiply by the differential dx) to get
dy
y D 2x dx:
Integrating both sides then gives the general solution ln y D x2 C C.
There is another way to approach the differential equation in (1), however,
which—while leading to the same general solution—opens the door not only to the
solution method discussed in this section, but to other methods of solving differen-
tial equations as well. What is common to all these methods is the idea that if a
given equation is difﬁcult to solve, then perhaps multiplying both sides of the equa-
tion by a suitably chosen function of x and/or y may result in an equivalent equation
that can be solved more easily. Thus, in Eq. (1), rather than divide both sides by y,
we could instead multiply both sides by the factor 1=y. (Of course algebraically
these two are the same, but we are highlighting the fact that often the crucial ﬁrst

46
Chapter 1 First-Order Differential Equations
step in solving a differential equation is to multiply both of its sides by the “right”
function.) Applying this to Eq. (1) (while leaving dx in place) gives
1
y  dy
dx D 2x:
(2)
The signiﬁcance of Eq. (2) is that, unlike Eq. (1), both sides are recognizable as a
derivative. By the chain rule, the left-hand side of Eq. (2) can be written as
1
y  dy
dx D Dx.ln y/;
and of course the right hand side of Eq. (2) is Dx.x2/. Thus each side of Eq. (2) can
be viewed as a derivative with respect to x:
Dx.ln y/ D Dx.x2/:
Integrating both sides with respect to x gives the same general solution ln y D x2 C
C that we found before.
We were able to solve the differential equation in Eq. (1), then, by ﬁrst multi-
plying both of its sides by a factor—known as an integrating factor—chosen so that
both sides of the resulting equation could be recognized as a derivative. Solving the
equation then becomes simply a matter of integrating both sides. More generally,
an integrating factor for a differential equation is a function .x; y/ such that mul-
tiplication of each side of the differential equation by .x; y/ yields an equation in
which each side is recognizable as a derivative. In some cases integrating factors
involve both of the variables x and y; however, our second solution of Eq. (1) was
based on the integrating factor .y/ D 1=y, which depends only on y. Our goal
in this section is to show how integrating factors can be used to solve a broad and
important category of ﬁrst-order differential equations.
A linear ﬁrst-order equation is a differential equation of the form
dy
dx C P.x/y D Q.x/:
(3)
We assume that the coefﬁcient functions P.x/ and Q.x/ are continuous on some in-
terval on the x-axis. (Can you see that the differential equation in Eq. (1), in addition
to being separable, is also linear? Is every separable equation also linear?) Assum-
ing that the necessary antiderivatives can be found, the general linear equation in (3)
can always be solved by multiplying by the integrating factor

This formula should not be memorized. In a speciﬁc problem it generally is
simpler to use the method by which we developed the formula. That is, in order
to solve an equation that can be written in the form in Eq. (3) with the coefﬁcient
functions P.x/ and Q.x/ displayed explicitly, you should attempt to carry out the
following steps.
METHOD: SOLUTION OF LINEAR FIRST-ORDER EQUATIONS
1. Begin by calculating the integrating factor .x/ D e
R
P.x/ dx.
2. Then multiply both sides of the differential equation by .x/.
3. Next, recognize the left-hand side of the resulting equation as the derivative
of a product:
Dx Œ.x/y.x/ D .x/Q.x/:
4. Finally, integrate this equation,
.x/y.x/ D
Z
.x/Q.x/ dx C C;
then solve for y to obtain the general solution of the original differential equa-
tion.
Remark 1
Given an initial condition y.x0/ D y0, you can (as usual) substitute x D x0 and
y D y0 into the general solution and solve for the value of C yielding the particular solution
that satisﬁes this initial condition.
Remark 2
You need not supply explicitly a constant of integration when you ﬁnd the
integrating factor .x/. For if we replace
Z
P.x/ dx
with
Z
P.x/ dx C K
in Eq. (4), the result is
.x/ D eKC
R
P.x/ dx D eKe
R
P.x/ dx:
But the constant factor eK does not affect materially the result of multiplying both sides of
the differential equation in (3) by .x/, so we might as well take K D 0. You may there-
fore choose for
R
P.x/ dx any convenient antiderivative of P.x/, without bothering to add a
constant of integration.

types of behavior are separated by the particular solution y.x/ D  33

in Eq. (8), so y0 D  33
32 for the solution curve that is dashed in Fig. 1.5.1. If y0 >  33
32,
then C > 0 in Eq. (8), so the term ex eventually dominates the behavior of y.x/, and hence
y.x/ ! C1 as x ! C1. But if y0 <  33
32, then C < 0, so both terms in y.x/ are negative
and therefore y.x/ ! 1 as x ! C1. Thus the initial condition y0 D  33
32 is critical
in the sense that solutions that start above  33
32 on the y-axis grow in the positive direction,
while solutions that start lower than  33
32 grow in the negative direction as x ! C1. The
interpretation of a mathematical model often hinges on ﬁnding such a critical condition that
separates one kind of behavior of a solution from a different kind of behavior.

word “equilibrium” connotes “unchanging,” so by an equilibrium solution of a differential
equation is meant a constant solution y.x/  c, for which it follows that y0.x/  0. Note that
substitution of y0 D 0 in the differential equation (9) yields 3xy D 6x, so it follows that y D 2
if x 6D 0. Hence we see that y.x/  2 is the only equilibrium solution of this differential
equation, as seems visually obvious in Fig. 1.5.2.
A Closer Look at the Method
The preceding derivation of the solution in Eq. (6) of the linear ﬁrst-order equation
y0 C Py D Q bears closer examination. Suppose that the coefﬁcient functions P.x/
and Q.x/ are continuous on the (possibly unbounded) open interval I. Then the
antiderivatives
Z
P.x/ dx
and
Z 
Q.x/e
R
P.x/ dx
dx
exist on I. Our derivation of Eq. (6) shows that if y D y.x/ is a solution of Eq. (3)
on I, then y.x/ is given by the formula in Eq. (6) for some choice of the constant
C. Conversely, you may verify by direct substitution (Problem 31) that the function
y.x/ given in Eq. (6) satisﬁes Eq. (3). Finally, given a point x0 of I and any num-
ber y0, there is—as previously noted—a unique value of C such that y.x0/ D y0.
Consequently, we have proved the following existence-uniqueness theorem.
THEOREM 1
The Linear First-Order Equation
If the functions P.x/ and Q.x/ are continuous on the open interval I containing
the point x0, then the initial value problem
dy
dx C P.x/y D Q.x/;
y.x0/ D y0
(11)
has a unique solution y.x/ on I, given by the formula in Eq. (6) with an appro-
priate value of C.
Remark 1
Theorem 1 gives a solution on the entire interval I for a linear differential
equation, in contrast with Theorem 1 of Section 1.3, which guarantees only a solution on a
possibly smaller interval.
Remark 2
Theorem 1 tells us that every solution of Eq. (3) is included in the general solu-
tion given in Eq. (6). Thus a linear ﬁrst-order differential equation has no singular solutions.

Comment
In general, an integral such as the one in Eq. (14) would (for given x) need to
be approximated numerically—using Simpson’s rule, for instance—to ﬁnd the value y.x/ of
the solution at x. In this case, however, we have the sine integral function

which appears with sufﬁcient frequency in applications that its values have been tabulated. A
good set of tables of special functions is Abramowitz and Stegun, Handbook of Mathematical

The sine integral function is available in most scientiﬁc computing systems and can be used
to plot typical solution curves deﬁned by Eq. (15). Figure 1.5.3 shows a selection of solution
curves with initial values y.1/ D y0 ranging from y0 D 3 to y0 D 3. It appears that on
each solution curve, y.x/ ! 0 as x ! C1, and this is in fact true because the sine integral
function is bounded.

In the sequel we will see that it is the exception—rather than the rule—when a
solution of a differential equation can be expressed in terms of elementary functions.
We will study various devices for obtaining good approximations to the values of
the nonelementary functions we encounter. In Chapter 2 we will discuss numerical
integration of differential equations in some detail.

Mixture Problems
As a ﬁrst application of linear ﬁrst-order equations, we consider a tank containing
a solution—a mixture of solute and solvent—such as salt dissolved in water. There
is both inﬂow and outﬂow, and we want to compute the amount x.t/ of solute in
the tank at time t, given the amount x.0/ D x0 at time t D 0. Suppose that solution
with a concentration of ci grams of solute per liter of solution ﬂows into the tank
at the constant rate of ri liters per second, and that the solution in the tank—kept
thoroughly mixed by stirring—ﬂows out at the constant rate of ro liters per second.
To set up a differential equation for x.t/, we estimate the change x in x
during the brief time interval Œt; t C t. The amount of solute that ﬂows into the
tank during t seconds is rici t grams. To check this, note how the cancellation
of dimensions checks our computations:

ri
liters

 
ci


.t seconds/
yields a quantity measured in grams.
The amount of solute that ﬂows out of the tank during the same time interval
depends on the concentration co.t/ of solute in the solution at time t. But as noted
in Fig. 1.5.4, co.t/ D x.t/=V.t/, where V.t/ denotes the volume (not constant unless
ri D ro) of solution in the tank at time t. Then

We now divide by t:
x
t  rici  roco:
Finally, we take the limit as t ! 0; if all the functions involved are continuous and
x.t/ is differentiable, then the error in this approximation also approaches zero, and
we obtain the differential equation
dx

(16)
in which ri, ci, and ro are constants, but co denotes the variable concentration
co.t/ D x.t/
V.t/
(17)
of solute in the tank at time t. Thus the amount x.t/ of solute in the tank satisﬁes
the differential equation
dx
dt D rici  ro
V x:
(18)
If V0 D V.0/, then V.t/ D V0 C.ri ro/t, so Eq. (18) is a linear ﬁrst-order differential
equation for the amount x.t/ of solute in the tank at time t.
Important
Equation (18) need not be committed to memory. It is the process we used to
obtain that equation—examination of the behavior of the system over a short time interval
Œt; t C t—that you should strive to understand, because it is a very useful tool for obtaining
all sorts of differential equations.
Remark It was convenient for us to use g/L mass/volume units in deriving Eq. (18). But
any other consistent system of units can be used to measure amounts of solute and volumes
of solution. In the following example we measure both in cubic kilometers.

Chapter 1 First-Order Differential Equations
Example 4
Assume that Lake Erie has a volume of 480 km3 and that its rate of inﬂow (from Lake Huron)
and outﬂow (to Lake Ontario) are both 350 km3 per year. Suppose that at the time t D 0
(years), the pollutant concentration of Lake Erie—caused by past industrial pollution that
has now been ordered to cease—is ﬁve times that of Lake Huron. If the outﬂow henceforth
is perfectly mixed lake water, how long will it take to reduce the pollution concentration in
Lake Erie to twice that of Lake Huron?
Solution
Here we have
V D 480 (km3);
ri D ro D r D 350 (km3=yr);
ci D c (the pollutant concentration of Lake Huron), and
x0 D x.0/ D 5cV;
and the question is this: When is x.t/ D 2cV ? With this notation, Eq. (18) is the separable

A 120-gallon (gal) tank initially contains 90 lb of salt dissolved in 90 gal of water. Brine
containing 2 lb=gal of salt ﬂows into the tank at the rate of 4 gal=min, and the well-stirred
mixture ﬂows out of the tank at the rate of 3 gal=min. How much salt does the tank contain
when it is full?
Solution
The interesting feature of this example is that, due to the differing rates of inﬂow and outﬂow,
the volume of brine in the tank increases steadily with V.t/ D 90 C t gallons. The change x

Problems 45 and 46 deal with a shallow reservoir that has
a one-square-kilometer water surface and an average water
depth of 2 meters. Initially it is ﬁlled with fresh water, but at
time t D 0 water contaminated with a liquid pollutant begins
ﬂowing into the reservoir at the rate of 200 thousand cubic

pollutant (in millions of liters) in the reservoir after t months.

reservoir’s long-term pollutant content. How long does it
take the pollutant concentration in the reservoir to reach

1.5 Application Indoor Temperature Oscillations
For an interesting applied problem that involves the solution of a linear differen-
tial equation, consider indoor temperature oscillations that are driven by outdoor
temperature oscillations of the form
A.t/ D a0 C a1 cos !t C b1 sin !t:
(1)
If ! D =12, then these oscillations have a period of 24 hours (so that the cycle of
outdoor temperatures repeats itself daily) and Eq. (1) provides a realistic model for
the temperature outside a house on a day when no change in the overall day-to-day
weather pattern is occurring. For instance, for a typical July day in Athens, GA with
a minimum temperature of 70ıF when t D 4 (4 A.M.) and a maximum of 90ıF when
t D 16 (4 P.M.), we would take
A.t/ D 80  10 cos !.t  4/ D 80  5 cos !t  5

Chapter 1 First-Order Differential Equations

get a0 D 80, a1 D 5, and b1 D 5

If we write Newton’s law of cooling (Eq. (3) of Section 1.1) for the corre-
sponding indoor temperature u.t/ at time t, but with the outside temperature A.t/
given by Eq. (1) instead of a constant ambient temperature A, we get the linear
ﬁrst-order differential equation
du

that is,
du
dt C ku D k.a0 C a1 cos !t C b1 sin !t/
(3)
with coefﬁcient functions P.t/  k and Q.t/ D kA.t/. Typical values of the propor-
tionality constant k range from 0:2 to 0:5 (although k might be greater than 0:5 for
a poorly insulated building with open windows, or less than 0:2 for a well-insulated
building with tightly sealed windows).
SCENARIO:
Suppose that our air conditioner fails at time t0 D 0 one midnight,
and we cannot afford to have it repaired until payday at the end of the month. We
therefore want to investigate the resulting indoor temperatures that we must endure
for the next several days.
Begin your investigation by solving Eq. (3) with the initial condition u.0/ D
u0 (the indoor temperature at the time of the failure of the air conditioner). You
may want to use the integral formulas in 49 and 50 of the endpapers, or possibly a
computer algebra system. You should get the solution
u.t/ D a0 C c0ekt C c1 cos !t C d1 sin !t;
(4)
where
c0 D u0  a0  k2a1  k!b1
k2 C !2
;
c1 D k2a1  k!b1
k2 C !2
;
d1 D k!a1 C k2b1
k2 C !2
with ! D =12.
With a0 D 80, a1 D 5, b1 D 5
p
3 (as in Eq. (2)), ! D =12, and k D 0:2
(for instance), this solution reduces (approximately) to
u.t/ D 80 C et=5 .u0  82:3351/ C .2:3351/ cos t
12  .5:6036/ sin t
12 :
(5)
Observe ﬁrst that the “damped” exponential term in Eq. (5) approaches zero
as t ! C1, leaving the long-term “steady periodic” solution
usp.t/ D 80 C .2:3351/ cos t
12  .5:6036/ sin t
12 :
(6)
Consequently, the long-term indoor temperatures oscillate every 24 hours around
the same average temperature 80ıF as the average outdoor temperature.

1.6 Substitution Methods and Exact Equations
57
Figure 1.5.10 shows a number of solution curves corresponding to possible
initial temperatures u0 ranging from 65ıF to 95ıF. Observe that—whatever the
initial temperature—the indoor temperature “settles down” within about 18 hours
to a periodic daily oscillation. But the amplitude of temperature variation is less
indoors than outdoors. Indeed, using the trigonometric identity mentioned earlier,
Eq. (6) can be rewritten (verify this!) as
u.t/ D 80  .6:0707/ cos

D 80  .6:0707/ cos 

Do you see that this implies that the indoor temperature varies between a minimum
of about 74ıF and a maximum of about 86ıF?

Finally, comparison of Eqs. (2) and (7) indicates that the indoor temperature
lags behind the outdoor temperature by about 7:5082  4  3:5 hours, as illustrated
in Fig. 1.5.11. Thus the temperature inside the house continues to rise until about
7:30 P.M. each evening, so the hottest part of the day inside is early evening rather
than late afternoon (as outside).
For a personal problem to investigate, carry out a similar analysis using av-
erage July daily maximum=minimum ﬁgures for your own locale and a value of k
appropriate to your own home. You might also consider a winter day instead of
a summer day. (What is the winter-summer difference for the indoor temperature
problem?) You may wish to explore the use of available technology both to solve
the differential equation and to graph its solution for the indoor temperature in com-
parison with the outdoor temperature.
1.6 Substitution Methods and Exact Equations
The ﬁrst-order differential equations we have solved in the previous sections have
all been either separable or linear. But many applications involve differential equa-
tions that are neither separable nor linear. In this section we illustrate (mainly with
examples) substitution methods that sometimes can be used to transform a given
differential equation into one that we already know how to solve.
For instance, the differential equation
dy
dx D f .x; y/;
(1)

58
Chapter 1 First-Order Differential Equations
with dependent variable y and independent variable x, may contain a conspicuous
combination
v D ˛.x; y/
(2)
of x and y that suggests itself as a new independent variable v. Thus the differential
equation
dy
dx D .x C y C 3/2
practically demands the substitution v D x C y C 3 of the form in Eq. (2).
If the substitution relation in Eq. (2) can be solved for
y D ˇ.x; v/;
(3)
then application of the chain rule—regarding v as an (unknown) function of x—
yields
dy
dx D @ˇ
@x
dx
dx C @ˇ
@v
dv
dx D ˇx C ˇv
dv
dx ;
(4)
where the partial derivatives @ˇ=@x D ˇx.x; v/ and @ˇ=@v D ˇv.x; v/ are known
functions of x and v. If we substitute the right-hand side in (4) for dy=dx in Eq. (1)
and then solve for dv=dx, the result is a new differential equation of the form
dv
dx D g.x; v/
(5)
with new dependent variable v. If this new equation is either separable or linear,
then we can apply the methods of preceding sections to solve it.
If v D v.x/ is a solution of Eq. (5), then y D ˇ.x; v.x// will be a solution of
the original Eq. (1). The trick is to select a substitution such that the transformed
Eq. (5) is one we can solve. Even when possible, this is not always easy; it may
require a fair amount of ingenuity or trial and error.
Example 1
Solve the differential equation
dy
dx D .x C y C 3/2:
Solution
As indicated earlier, let’s try the substitution
v D x C y C 3I
that is,
y D v  x  3:
Then
dy
dx D dv
dx  1;
so the transformed equation is
dv
dx D 1 C v2:
This is a separable equation, and we have no difﬁculty in obtaining its solution
x D
Z
dv
1 C v2 D tan1 v C C:
So v D tan.x  C/. Because v D x C y C 3, the general solution of the original equation
dy=dx D .x C y C 3/2 is x C y C 3 D tan.x  C/; that is,
y.x/ D tan.x  C/  x  3:

equation of Example 1. We see that, although the function f .x; y/ D .x C y C 3/2 is contin-
uously differentiable for all x and y, each solution is continuous only on a bounded interval.
In particular, because the tangent function is continuous on the open interval .=2; =2/,
the particular solution with arbitrary constant value C is continuous on the interval where
=2 < x  C < =2; that is, C  =2 < x < C C =2. This situation is fairly typical of non-
linear differential equations, in contrast with linear differential equations, whose solutions
are continuous wherever the coefﬁcient functions in the equation are continuous.
Example 1 illustrates the fact that any differential equation of the form
dy
dx D F.ax C by C c/
(6)
can be transformed into a separable equation by use of the substitution v D ax C
by C c (see Problem 55). The paragraphs that follow deal with other classes of
ﬁrst-order equations for which there are standard substitutions that are known to
succeed.
Homogeneous Equations
A homogeneous ﬁrst-order differential equation is one that can be written in the
form
dy
dx D F
y
x

:
(7)
If we make the substitutions
v D y
x ;
y D vx;
dy
dx D v C x dv
dx ;
(8)
then Eq. (7) is transformed into the separable equation
x dv
dx D F.v/  v:
Thus every homogeneous ﬁrst-order differential equation can be reduced to an inte-
gration problem by means of the substitutions in (8).
Remark A dictionary deﬁnition of “homogeneous” is “of a similar kind or nature.” Con-
sider a differential equation of the form
Axmyn dy
dx D Bxpyq C Cxrys;
./
whose polynomial coefﬁcient functions are “homogeneous” in the sense that each of their
terms has the same total degree, m C n D p C q D r C s D K. If we divide each side of ./
by xK, then the result—because xmyn=xmCn D .y=x/n, and so forth—is the equation

which evidently can be written (by another division) in the form of Eq. (7). More generally,
a differential equation of the form P.x; y/y0 D Q.x; y/ with polynomial coefﬁcients P and
Q is homogeneous if the terms in these polynomials all have the same total degree K. The
differential equation in the following example is of this form with K D 2.

Bernoulli Equations
A ﬁrst-order differential equation of the form
dy
dx C P.x/y D Q.x/yn
(9)
is called a Bernoulli equation. If either n D 0 or n D 1, then Eq. (9) is linear.
Otherwise, as we ask you to show in Problem 56, the substitution
v D y1n
(10)
transforms Eq. (9) into the linear equation
dv
dx C .1  n/P.x/v D .1  n/Q.x/:
Rather than memorizing the form of this transformed equation, it is more efﬁcient
to make the substitution in Eq. (10) explicitly, as in the following examples.
Example 4
If we rewrite the homogeneous equation 2xyy0 D 4x2 C 3y2 of Example 2 in the form

we see that it is also a Bernoulli equation with P.x/ D 3=.2x/, Q.x/ D 2x, n D 1, and

Exact Differential Equations
We have seen that a general solution y.x/ of a ﬁrst-order differential equation is
often deﬁned implicitly by an equation of the form
F.x; y.x// D C;
(21)
where C is a constant. On the other hand, given the identity in (21), we can recover
the original differential equation by differentiating each side with respect to x. Pro-
vided that Eq. (21) implicitly deﬁnes y as a differentiable function of x, this gives
the original differential equation in the form
@F
@x C @F
@y
dy
dx D 0I
that is,
M.x; y/ C N.x; y/ dy
dx D 0;
(22)
where M.x; y/ D Fx.x; y/ and N.x; y/ D Fy.x; y/.
It is sometimes convenient to rewrite Eq. (22) in the more symmetric form
M.x; y/ dx C N.x; y/ dy D 0;
(23)
called its differential form.
The general ﬁrst-order differential equation y0 D
f .x; y/ can be written in this form with M D f .x; y/ and N  1. The preceding
discussion shows that, if there exists a function F.x; y/ such that
@F
@x D M
and
@F
@y D N;
then the equation
F.x; y/ D C
implicitly deﬁnes a general solution of Eq. (23). In this case, Eq. (23) is called an
exact differential equation—the differential
dF D Fx dx C Fy dy
of F.x; y/ is exactly M dx C N dy.
Natural questions are these: How can we determine whether the differential
equation in (23) is exact? And if it is exact, how can we ﬁnd the function F such
that Fx D M and Fy D N? To answer the ﬁrst question, let us recall that if the

1.6 Substitution Methods and Exact Equations
65
mixed second-order partial derivatives Fxy and Fyx are continuous on an open set
in the xy-plane, then they are equal: Fxy D Fyx. If Eq. (23) is exact and M and N
have continuous partial derivatives, it then follows that
@M
@y D Fxy D Fyx D @N
@x :
Thus the equation
@M
@y D @N
@x
(24)
is a necessary condition that the differential equation M dx C N dy D 0 be exact.
That is, if My 6D Nx, then the differential equation in question is not exact, so we
need not attempt to ﬁnd a function F.x; y/ such that Fx D M and Fy D N—there
is no such function.
Example 8
The differential equation
y3 dx C 3xy2 dy D 0
(25)
is exact because we can immediately see that the function F.x; y/ D xy3 has the property
that Fx D y3 and Fy D 3xy2. Thus a general solution of Eq. (25) is
xy3 D CI
if you prefer, y.x/ D kx1=3.
But suppose that we divide each term of the differential equation in Example
8 by y2 to obtain
y dx C 3x dy D 0:
(26)
This equation is not exact because, with M D y and N D 3x, we have
@M
@y D 1 6D 3 D @N
@x :
Hence the necessary condition in Eq. (24) is not satisﬁed.
We are confronted with a curious situation here. The differential equations in
(25) and (26) are essentially equivalent, and they have exactly the same solutions,
yet one is exact and the other is not. In brief, whether a given differential equation
is exact or not is related to the precise form M dx C N dy D 0 in which it is written.
Theorem 1 tells us that (subject to differentiability conditions usually satisﬁed
in practice) the necessary condition in (24) is also a sufﬁcient condition for exact-
ness. In other words, if My D Nx, then the differential equation M dx C N dy D 0
is exact.
THEOREM 1
Criterion for Exactness
Suppose that the functions M.x; y/ and N.x; y/ are continuous and have contin-
uous ﬁrst-order partial derivatives in the open rectangle RW a < x < b, c < y < d.
Then the differential equation
M.x; y/ dx C N.x; y/ dy D 0
(23)
is exact in R if and only if
@M
@y D @N
@x
(24)
at each point of R. That is, there exists a function F.x; y/ deﬁned on R with
@F=@x D M and @F=@y D N if and only if Eq. (24) holds on R.

Chapter 1 First-Order Differential Equations
Proof:
We have seen already that it is necessary for Eq. (24) to hold if
Eq. (23) is to be exact. To prove the converse, we must show that if Eq. (24) holds,
then we can construct a function F.x; y/ such that @F=@x D M and @F=@y D N.
Note ﬁrst that, for any function g.y/, the function
F.x; y/ D
Z
M.x; y/ dx C g.y/
(27)
satisﬁes the condition @F=@x D M. (In Eq. (27), the notation

an antiderivative of M.x; y/ with respect to x.) We plan to choose g.y/ so that

(28)
To see that there is such a function of y, it sufﬁces to show that the right-hand side in
Eq. (28) is a function of y alone. We can then ﬁnd g.y/ by integrating with respect
to y. Because the right-hand side in Eq. (28) is deﬁned on a rectangle, and hence on
an interval as a function of x, it sufﬁces to show that its derivative with respect to x
is identically zero. But

Instead of memorizing Eq. (29), it is usually better to solve an exact equation
M dx C N dy D 0 by carrying out the process indicated by Eqs. (27) and (28). First
we integrate M.x; y/ with respect to x and write
F.x; y/ D
Z
M.x; y/ dx C g.y/;
thinking of the function g.y/ as an “arbitrary constant of integration” as far as the
variable x is concerned. Then we determine g.y/ by imposing the condition that
@F=@y D N.x; y/. This yields a general solution in the implicit form F.x; y/ D C.

1.6 Substitution Methods and Exact Equations

Solution
Let M.x; y/ D 6xy y3 and N.x; y/ D 4y C3x2 3xy2. The given equation is exact because
@M
@y D 6x  3y2 D @N
@x :
Integrating @F=@x D M.x; y/ with respect to x, we get
F.x; y/ D
Z
.6xy  y3/ dx D 3x2y  xy3 C g.y/:
Then we differentiate with respect to y and set @F=@y D N.x; y/. This yields
@F
@y D 3x2  3xy2 C g0.y/ D 4y C 3x2  3xy2;
and it follows that g0.y/ D 4y. Hence g.y/ D 2y2 C C1, and thus
F.x; y/ D 3x2y  xy3 C 2y2 C C1:
Therefore, a general solution of the differential equation is deﬁned implicitly by the equation
3x2y  xy3 C 2y2 D C
(31)
(we have absorbed the constant C1 into the constant C).
Remark Figure 1.6.7 shows a rather complicated structure of solution curves for the differ-
ential equation of Example 9. The solution satisfying a given initial condition y.x0/ D y0
is deﬁned implicitly by Eq. (31), with C determined by substituting x D x0 and y D y0 in
the equation. For instance, the particular solution satisfying y.0/ D 1 is deﬁned implicitly
by the equation 3x2y  xy3 C 2y2 D 2. The other two special points in the ﬁgure—at .0; 0/
and near .0:75; 2:12/—are ones where both coefﬁcient functions in Eq. (30) vanish, so the
theorem of Section 1.3 does not guarantee a unique solution.

Reducible Second-Order Equations
A second-order differential equation involves the second derivative of the unknown
function y.x/, and thus has the general form
F.x; y; y0; y00/ D 0:
(32)
If either the dependent variable y or the independent variable x is missing from a
second-order equation, then it is easily reduced by a simple substitution to a ﬁrst-
order equation that may be solvable by the methods of this chapter.
Dependent variable y missing.
If y is missing, then Eq. (32) takes the form
F.x; y0; y00/ D 0:
(33)
Then the substitution
p D y0 D dy
dx ;
y00 D dp
dx
(34)
results in the ﬁrst-order differential equation
F.x; p; p0/ D 0:
If we can solve this equation for a general solution p.x; C1/ involving an arbitrary
constant C1, then we need only write
y.x/ D
Z
y0.x/ dx D
Z
p.x; C1/ dx C C2
to get a solution of Eq. (33) that involves two arbitrary constants C1 and C2 (as is to
be expected in the case of a second-order differential equation).

simply vertical translates of the parabola y D x2 (for which C1 D C2 D 0). Figure 1.6.8
shows this parabola and some typical solution curves with C2 D 0 but C1 6D 0. Solution
curves with C1 and C2 both nonzero are vertical translates of those (other than the parabola)
shown in Fig. 1.6.8.

constants A and B are both positive, we readily verify that y.x/ D AeBx satisﬁes yy00 D .y0/2
for all real values of A and B. With B D 0 and different values of A, we get all horizontal
lines in the plane as solution curves. The upper half of Fig. 1.6.9 shows the solution curves
obtained with A D 1 (for instance) and different positive values of B. With A D 1 these
solution curves are reﬂected in the x-axis, and with negative values of B they are reﬂected in
the y-axis. In particular, we see that we get solutions of yy00 D .y0/2, allowing both positive
and negative possibilities for both y and y0.

1.6 Application Computer Algebra Solutions
Computer algebra systems typically include commands for the “automatic” solution
of differential equations. But two different such systems often give different results
whose equivalence is not clear, and a single system may give the solution in an
overly complicated form. Consequently, computer algebra solutions of differential
equations often require considerable “processing” or simpliﬁcation by a human user
in order to yield concrete and applicable information. Here we illustrate these issues
using the interesting differential equation
dy
dx D sin.x  y/
(1)
that appeared in the Section 1.3 Application. The Maple command
dsolve( D(y)(x) = sin(x -- y(x)), y(x));
yields the simple and attractive result
y.x/ D x  2 tan1
x  2  C1
x  C1

(2)
that was cited there. But the supposedly equivalent Mathematica command
DSolve[ y'[x] == Sin[x -- y[x]], y[x], x]
and the WolframjAlpha query
y’ = sin(x -- y)
both yield considerably more complicated results from which—with a fair amount
of effort in simpliﬁcation—one can extract the quite different looking solution

This apparent disparity is not unusual; different symbolic algebra systems, or
even different versions of the same system, often yield different forms of a solution
of the same differential equation. As an alternative to attempted reconciliation of
such seemingly disparate results as in Eqs. (2) and (3), a common tactic is sim-
pliﬁcation of the differential equation before submitting it to a computer algebra
system.

1.6 Substitution Methods and Exact Equations
73
Chapter 1 Summary
In this chapter we have discussed applications of and solution methods for several
important types of ﬁrst-order differential equations, including those that are separa-
ble (Section 1.4), linear (Section 1.5), or exact (Section 1.6). In Section 1.6 we also
discussed substitution techniques that can sometimes be used to transform a given
ﬁrst-order differential equation into one that is either separable, linear, or exact.
Lest it appear that these methods constitute a “grab bag” of special and unre-
lated techniques, it is important to note that they are all versions of a single idea.
Given a differential equation
f .x; y; y0/ D 0;
(1)
we attempt to write it in the form
d
dx ŒG.x; y/ D 0:
(2)
It is precisely to obtain the form in Eq. (2) that we multiply the terms in Eq. (1) by an
appropriate integrating factor (even if all we are doing is separating the variables).
But once we have found a function G.x; y/ such that Eqs. (1) and (2) are equivalent,
a general solution is deﬁned implicitly by means of the equation
G.x; y/ D C
(3)
that one obtains by integrating Eq. (2).
Given a speciﬁc ﬁrst-order differential equation to be solved, we can attack it
by means of the following steps:

Is it separable? If so, separate the variables and integrate (Section 1.4).

Is it linear? That is, can it be written in the form
dy
dx C P.x/y D Q.x/‹
If so, multiply by the integrating factor  D exp
R
P dx
	 of Section 1.5.

Is it exact? That is, when the equation is written in the form M dx CN dy D 0,
is @M=@y D @N=@x (Section 1.6)?

If the equation as it stands is not separable, linear, or exact, is there a plausible
substitution that will make it so? For instance, is it homogeneous (Section
1.6)?
Many ﬁrst-order differential equations succumb to the line of attack outlined
here. Nevertheless, many more do not. Because of the wide availability of com-
puters, numerical techniques are commonly used to approximate the solutions of
differential equations that cannot be solved readily or explicitly by the methods of
this chapter. Indeed, most of the solution curves shown in ﬁgures in this chapter
were plotted using numerical approximations rather than exact solutions. Several
numerical methods for the appropriate solution of differential equations will be dis-
cussed in Chapter 2.

2.1 Population Models
I
n Section 1.4 we introduced the exponential differential equation dP=dt D kP ,
with solution P.t/ D P0ekt, as a mathematical model for natural population
growth that occurs as a result of constant birth and death rates. Here we present
a more general population model that accommodates birth and death rates that are
not necessarily constant. As before, however, our population function P.t/ will be
a continuous approximation to the actual population, which of course changes only
by integral increments—that is, by one birth or death at a time.
Suppose that the population changes only by the occurrence of births and
deaths—there is no immigration or emigration from outside the country or envi-
ronment under consideration. It is customary to track the growth or decline of a
population in terms of its birth rate and death rate functions deﬁned as follows:

ˇ.t/ is the number of births per unit of population per unit of time at time t;

ı.t/ is the number of deaths per unit of population per unit of time at time t.
Then the numbers of births and deaths that occur during the time interval
Œt; t C t is given (approximately) by
births:
ˇ.t/  P.t/  t;
deaths:
ı.t/  P.t/  t:
Hence the change P in the population during the time interval Œt; t C t of
length t is
P D fbirthsg  fdeathsg  ˇ.t/  P.t/  t  ı.t/  P.t/  t;
so
P
t  Œˇ.t/  ı.t/ P.t/:

Chapter 2 Mathematical Models and Numerical Methods
The error in this approximation should approach zero as t ! 0, so—taking
the limit—we get the differential equation
dP
dt D .ˇ  ı/P;
(1)
in which we write ˇ D ˇ.t/, ı D ı.t/, and P D P.t/ for brevity. Equation (1) is the
general population equation. If ˇ and ı are constant, Eq. (1) reduces to the natural
growth equation with k D ˇ  ı. But it also includes the possibility that ˇ and ı
are variable functions of t. The birth and death rates need not be known in advance;
they may well depend on the unknown function P.t/.
Example 1
Suppose that an alligator population numbers 100 initially, and that its death rate is ı D 0 (so
none of the alligators is dying). If the birth rate is ˇ D .0:0005/P —and thus increases as the
population does—then Eq. (1) gives the initial value problem
dP
dt D .0:0005/P 2;
P.0/ D 100
(with t in years). Then upon separating the variables we get
Z

Substitution of t D 0, P D 100 gives C D 1=100, and then we readily solve for
P.t/ D 2000
20  t :
For instance, P.10/ D 2000=10 D 200, so after 10 years the alligator population has
doubled. But we see that P ! C1 as t ! 20, so a real “population explosion” occurs in
20 years. Indeed, the direction ﬁeld and solution curves shown in Fig. 2.1.1 indicate that
a population explosion always occurs, whatever the size of the (positive) initial population
P.0/ D P0. In particular, it appears that the population always becomes unbounded in a ﬁnite
period of time.

Bounded Populations and the Logistic Equation
In situations as diverse as the human population of a nation and a fruit ﬂy population
in a closed container, it is often observed that the birth rate decreases as the popu-
lation itself increases. The reasons may range from increased scientiﬁc or cultural
sophistication to a limited food supply. Suppose, for example, that the birth rate ˇ is
a linear decreasing function of the population size P , so that ˇ D ˇ0  ˇ1P , where
ˇ0 and ˇ1 are positive constants. If the death rate ı D ı0 remains constant, then
Eq. (1) takes the form
dP
dt D .ˇ0  ˇ1P  ı0/P I
that is,
dP
dt D aP  bP 2;
(2)
where a D ˇ0  ı0 and b D ˇ1.
If the coefﬁcients a and b are both positive, then Eq. (2) is called the logistic
equation. For the purpose of relating the behavior of the population P.t/ to the
values of the parameters in the equation, it is useful to rewrite the logistic equation
in the form
dP
dt D kP.M  P /;
(3)
where k D b and M D a=b are constants.

limt!1 P.t/ D 150, whatever the initial value P0 > 0.
Limiting Populations and Carrying Capacity
The ﬁnite limiting population noted in Example 2 is characteristic of logistic pop-
ulations. In Problem 32 we ask you to use the method of solution of Example 2 to
show that the solution of the logistic initial value problem

(7)
Actual animal populations are positive valued. If P0 D M, then (7) reduces
to the unchanging (constant-valued) “equilibrium population” P.t/  M. Other-
wise, the behavior of a logistic population depends on whether 0 < P0 < M or
P0 > M. If 0 < P0 < M, then we see from (6) and (7) that P 0 > 0 and

Chapter 2 Mathematical Models and Numerical Methods
In either case, the “positive number” or “negative number” in the denominator has
absolute value less than P0 and—because of the exponential factor—approaches 0
as t ! C1. It follows that
lim
t!C1 P.t/ D
MP0
P0 C 0 D M:
(8)
Thus a population that satisﬁes the logistic equation does not grow without
bound like a naturally growing population modeled by the exponential equation
P 0 D kP . Instead, it approaches the ﬁnite limiting population M as t ! C1.
As illustrated by the typical logistic solution curves in Fig. 2.1.3, the population
P.t/ steadily increases and approaches M from below if 0 < P0 < M, but steadily
decreases and approaches M from above if P0 > M. Sometimes M is called the
carrying capacity of the environment, considering it to be the maximum population

that the environment can support on a long-term basis.
Example 3
Suppose that in 1885 the population of a certain country was 50 million and was growing
at the rate of 750;000 people per year at that time. Suppose also that in 1940 its population
was 100 million and was then growing at the rate of 1 million per year. Assume that this
population satisﬁes the logistic equation. Determine both the limiting population M and the
predicted population for the year 2000.
Solution
We substitute the two given pairs of data in Eq. (3) and ﬁnd that
0:75 D 50k.M  50/;
1:00 D 100k.M  100/:
We solve simultaneously for M D 200 and k D 0:0001. Thus the limiting population of the
country in question is 200 million. With these values of M and k, and with t D 0 correspond-
ing to the year 1940 (in which P0 D 100), we ﬁnd that—according to Eq. (7)—the population
in the year 2000 will be
P.60/ D
100  200
100 C .200  100/e.0:0001/.200/.60/ ;
about 153:7 million people.
Historical Note
The logistic equation was introduced (around 1840) by the Belgian mathematician
and demographer P. F. Verhulst as a possible model for human population growth.
In the next two examples we compare natural growth and logistic model ﬁts to the
19th-century U.S. population census data, then compare projections for the 20th
century.
Example 4
The U.S. population in 1800 was 5:308 million and in 1900 was 76:212 million. If we take
P0 D 5:308 (with t D 0 in 1800) in the natural growth model P.t/ D P0ert and substitute
t D 100, P D 76:212, we ﬁnd that
76:212 D 5:308e100r;
so
r D
1
100 ln 76:212
5:308  0:026643:
Thus our natural growth model for the U.S. population during the 19th century is
P.t/ D .5:308/e.0:026643/t
(9)
(with t in years and P in millions). Because e0:026643  1:02700, the average population
growth between 1800 and 1900 was about 2:7% per year.

2.1 Population Models
79
Example 5
The U.S. population in 1850 was 23:192 million. If we take P0 D 5:308 and substitute the
data pairs t D 50, P D 23:192 (for 1850) and t D 100, P D 76:212 (for 1900) in the logistic
model formula in Eq. (7), we get the two equations
.5:308/M
5:308 C .M  5:308/e50kM D 23:192;
.5:308/M
5:308 C .M  5:308/e100kM D 76:212
(10)
in the two unknowns k and M. Nonlinear systems like this ordinarily are solved numerically
using an appropriate computer system. But with the right algebraic trick (Problem 36 in this
section) the equations in (10) can be solved manually for k D 0:000167716, M D 188:121.
Substitution of these values in Eq. (7) yields the logistic model

(11)
The table in Fig. 2.1.4 compares the actual 1800–1990 U.S. census population ﬁgures
with those predicted by the exponential growth model in (9) and the logistic model in (11).
Both agree well with the 19th-century ﬁgures. But the exponential model diverges appre-
ciably from the census data in the early decades of the 20th century, whereas the logistic
model remains accurate until 1940. By the end of the 20th century the exponential model
vastly overestimates the actual U.S. population—predicting over a billion in the year 2000—
whereas the logistic model somewhat underestimates it.

a percentage of the actual population—are shown for the 1800–1950 period. We see that the
logistic model tracks the actual population reasonably well throughout this 150-year period.
However, the exponential error is considerably larger during the 19th century and literally
goes off the chart during the ﬁrst half of the 20th century.
In order to measure the extent to which a given model ﬁts actual data, it is customary
to deﬁne the average error (in the model) as the square root of the average of the squares
of the individual errors (the latter appearing in the fourth and sixth columns of the table in
Fig. 2.1.4). Using only the 1800–1900 data, this deﬁnition gives 3:162 for the average error
in the exponential model, while the average error in the logistic model is only 0:452. Conse-
quently, even in 1900 we might well have anticipated that the logistic model would predict the
U.S. population growth during the 20th century more accurately than the exponential model.
The moral of Examples 4 and 5 is simply that one should not expect too much
of models that are based on severely limited information (such as just a pair of data
points). Much of the science of statistics is devoted to the analysis of large “data
sets” to formulate useful (and perhaps reliable) mathematical models.
More Applications of the Logistic Equation
We next describe some situations that illustrate the varied circumstances in which
the logistic equation is a satisfactory mathematical model.
1. Limited environment situation. A certain environment can support a popula-
tion of at most M individuals. It is then reasonable to expect the growth rate
ˇ  ı (the combined birth and death rates) to be proportional to M  P , be-
cause we may think of M  P as the potential for further expansion. Then
ˇ  ı D k.M  P /, so that
dP
dt D .ˇ  ı/P D kP.M  P /:
The classic example of a limited environment situation is a fruit ﬂy population
in a closed container.
2. Competition situation. If the birth rate ˇ is constant but the death rate ı is
proportional to P , so that ı D ˛P , then
dP
dt D .ˇ  ˛P /P D kP.M  P /:
This might be a reasonable working hypothesis in a study of a cannibalistic
population, in which all deaths result from chance encounters between indi-
viduals. Of course, competition between individuals is not usually so deadly,
nor its effects so immediate and decisive.
3. Joint proportion situation. Let P.t/ denote the number of individuals in a
constant-size susceptible population M who are infected with a certain con-
tagious and incurable disease. The disease is spread by chance encounters.
Then P 0.t/ should be proportional to the product of the number P of indi-
viduals having the disease and the number M  P of those not having it, and
therefore dP=dt D kP.M  P /. Again we discover that the mathematical
model is the logistic equation. The mathematical description of the spread of
a rumor in a population of M individuals is identical.
Example 6
Suppose that at time t D 0, 10 thousand people in a city with population M D 100 thousand
people have heard a certain rumor. After 1 week the number P.t/ of those who have heard it
has increased to P.1/ D 20 thousand. Assuming that P.t/ satisﬁes a logistic equation, when
will 80% of the city’s population have heard the rumor?

2.1 Population Models

Solution
Substituting P0 D 10 and M D 100 (thousand) in Eq. (7), we get
P.t/ D

(12)
Then substitution of t D 1, P D 20 gives the equation

thus after about 4 weeks and 3 days.
Doomsday versus Extinction
Consider a population P.t/ of unsophisticated animals in which females rely solely
on chance encounters to meet males for reproductive purposes. It is reasonable to
expect such encounters to occur at a rate that is proportional to the product of the
number P=2 of males and the number P=2 of females, hence at a rate proportional
to P 2. We therefore assume that births occur at the rate kP 2 (per unit time, with
k constant). The birth rate (births=time=population) is then given by ˇ D kP . If
the death rate ı is constant, then the general population equation in (1) yields the
differential equation
dP
dt D kP 2  ıP D kP.P  M/
(13)
(where M D ı=k > 0) as a mathematical model of the population.
Note that the right-hand side in Eq. (13) is the negative of the right-hand side
in the logistic equation in (3). We will see that the constant M is now a threshold
population, with the way the population behaves in the future depending critically
on whether the initial population P0 is less than or greater than M.
Example 7
Consider an animal population P.t/ that is modeled by the equation
dP
dt D 0:0004P.P  150/ D 0:0004P 2  0:06P:

We want to ﬁnd P.t/ if (a) P.0/ D 200; (b) P.0/ D 100.

(a) Substitution of t D 0 and P D 200 into (15) gives B D 4. With this value of B we solve
Eq. (15) for
P.t/ D 600e0:06t
4e0:06t  1:
(16)
Note that, as t increases and approaches T D ln.4/=0:06  23:105, the positive denominator
on the right in (16) decreases and approaches 0. Consequently P.t/ ! C1 as t ! T . This
is a doomsday situation—a real population explosion.
(b) Substitution of t D 0 and P D 100 into (15) gives B D 2. With this value of B we solve
Eq. (15) for
P.t/ D
300e0:06t

2 C e0:06t :
(17)
Note that, as t increases without bound, the positive denominator on the right in (16) ap-
proaches C1. Consequently, P.t/ ! 0 as t ! C1. This is an (eventual) extinction situa-
tion.
Thus the population in Example 7 either explodes or is an endangered species
threatened with extinction, depending on whether or not its initial size exceeds the
threshold population M D 150. An approximation to this phenomenon is sometimes
observed with animal populations, such as the alligator population in certain areas
of the southern United States.
Figure 2.1.6 shows typical solution curves that illustrate the two possibilities
for a population P.t/ satisfying Eq. (13). If P0 D M (exactly!), then the popula-
tion remains constant. However, this equilibrium situation is very unstable. If P0

the initial (positive) population is less than M (however slightly), then it decreases
(more gradually) toward zero as t ! C1. See Problem 33.

be one year later?
10. Suppose that the ﬁsh population P.t/ in a lake is attacked

to reproduce (so that the birth rate is ˇ D 0) and the death
rate ı (deaths per week per ﬁsh) is thereafter proportional
to 1=

14. Repeat part (a) of Problem 13 in the case ˇ < ı. What now
happens to the rabbit population in the long run?
15. Consider a population P.t/ satisfying the logistic equa-
tion dP=dt D aP  bP 2, where B D aP is the time rate

deaths occur. If the initial population is P.0/ D P0, and
B0 births per month and D0 deaths per month are occur-
ring at time t D 0, show that the limiting population is
M D B0P0=D0.
16. Consider a rabbit population P.t/ satisfying the logistic
equation as in Problem 15. If the initial population is 120
rabbits and there are 8 births per month and 6 deaths per
month occurring at time t D 0, how many months does it
take for P.t/ to reach 95% of the limiting population M?
17. Consider a rabbit population P.t/ satisfying the logistic
equation as in Problem 15. If the initial population is 240
rabbits and there are 9 births per month and 12 deaths per
month occurring at time t D 0, how many months does it
take for P.t/ to reach 105% of the limiting population M?
18. Consider a population P.t/ satisfying the extinction-
explosion equation dP=dt D aP 2  bP , where B D aP 2
is the time rate at which births occur and D D bP is the

month are occurring at time t D 0, show that the threshold
population is M D D0P0=B0.
19. Consider an alligator population P.t/ satisfying the
extinction-explosion equation as in Problem 18. If the ini-
tial population is 100 alligators and there are 10 births per
month and 9 deaths per month occurring at time t D 0,
how many months does it take for P.t/ to reach 10 times
the threshold population M?
20. Consider an alligator population P.t/ satisfying the
extinction-explosion equation as in Problem 18. If the ini-
tial population is 110 alligators and there are 11 births per
month and 12 deaths per month occurring at time t D 0,
how many months does it take for P.t/ to reach 10% of
the threshold population M?
21. Suppose that the population P.t/ of a country satisﬁes the
differential equation dP=dt D kP.200  P / with k con-
stant. Its population in 1960 was 100 million and was
then growing at the rate of 1 million per year. Predict this
country’s population for the year 2020.
22. Suppose that at time t D 0, half of a “logistic” population
of 100;000 persons have heard a certain rumor, and that the
number of those who have heard it is then increasing at the
rate of 1000 persons per day. How long will it take for this
rumor to spread to 80% of the population? (Suggestion:
Find the value of k by substituting P.0/ and P 0.0/ in the
logistic equation, Eq. (3).)
23. As the salt KNO3 dissolves in methanol, the number x.t/

(a) What is the maximum amount of the salt that will ever
dissolve in the methanol?
(b) If x D 50 when t D 0, how long will it take for an

24. Suppose that a community contains 15,000 people who
are susceptible to Michaud’s syndrome, a contagious dis-
ease. At time t D 0 the number N.t/ of people who have
developed Michaud’s syndrome is 5000 and is increasing
at the rate of 500 per day. Assume that N 0.t/ is propor-
tional to the product of the numbers of those who have
caught the disease and of those who have not. How long
will it take for another 5000 people to develop Michaud’s
syndrome?
25. The data in the table in Fig. 2.1.7 are given for a certain

and when P D 47:54. Then substitute these values in the
logistic equation and solve for k and M.)

29. During the period from 1790 to 1930, the U.S. population

[This problem is based on a computation by Verhulst, who
in 1845 used the 1790–1840 U.S. population data to pre-
dict accurately the U.S. population through the year 1930
(long after his own death, of course).]

there are P0 D 106 cells and that P.t/ is then increasing

(b) How does the behavior of P.t/ as t increases depend
on whether 0 < P0 < M or P0 > M?
34. If P.t/ satisﬁes the logistic equation in (3), use the chain
rule to show that
P 00.t/ D 2k2P.P  1
2M/.P  M/:
Conclude that P 00 > 0 if 0 < P < 1
2M; P 00 D 0 if P D 1
2M;
P 00 < 0 if 1
2M < P < M; and P 00 > 0 if P > M. In partic-
ular, it follows that any solution curve that crosses the line
P D 1
2M has an inﬂection point where it crosses that line,
and therefore resembles one of the lower S-shaped curves
in Fig. 2.1.3.
35. Consider two population functions P1.t/ and P2.t/, both
of which satisfy the logistic equation with the same lim-
iting population M but with different values k1 and k2 of
the constant k in Eq. (3). Assume that k1 < k2. Which
population approaches M the most rapidly? You can rea-
son geometrically by examining slope ﬁelds (especially
if appropriate software is available), symbolically by an-
alyzing the solution given in Eq. (7), or numerically by
substituting successive values of t.
36. To solve the two equations in (10) for the values of k and
M, begin by solving the ﬁrst equation for the quantity
x D e50kM and the second equation for x2 D e100kM .
Upon equating the two resulting expressions for x2 in
terms of M, you get an equation that is readily solved for
M. With M now known, either of the original equations
is readily solved for k. This technique can be used to “ﬁt”
the logistic equation to any three population values P0,
P1, and P2 corresponding to equally spaced times t0 D 0,
t1, and t2 D 2t1.
37. Use the method of Problem 36 to ﬁt the logistic equation
to the actual U.S. population data (Fig. 2.1.4) for the years
1850, 1900, and 1950. Solve the resulting logistic equa-
tion and compare the predicted and actual populations for
the years 1990 and 2000.
38. Fit the logistic equation to the actual U.S. population data
(Fig. 2.1.4) for the years 1900, 1930, and 1960. Solve the
resulting logistic equation, then compare the predicted and
actual populations for the years 1980, 1990, and 2000.
39. Birth and death rates of animal populations typically are
not constant; instead, they vary periodically with the pas-
sage of seasons. Find P.t/ if the population P satisﬁes
the differential equation
dP
dt D .k C b cos 2t/P;
where t is in years and k and b are positive constants. Thus
the growth-rate function r.t/ D k C b cos 2t varies peri-
odically about its mean value k. Construct a graph that
contrasts the growth of this population with one that has
the same initial value P0 but satisﬁes the natural growth
equation P 0 D kP (same constant k). How would the two
populations compare after the passage of many years?

2.1 Population Models

2.1 Application Logistic Modeling of Population Data
These investigations deal with the problem of ﬁtting a logistic model to given pop-
ulation data. Thus we want to determine the numerical constants a and b so that the
solution P.t/ of the initial value problem
dP
dt D aP C bP 2;
P.0/ D P0
(1)
approximates the given values P0, P1, : : : , Pn of the population at the times t0 D 0,
t1, : : : , tn. If we rewrite Eq. (1) (the logistic equation with kM D a and k D b) in
the form
1
P
dP
dt D a C bP;
(2)
then we see that the points

P.ti/; P 0.ti/

;
i D 0; 1; 2; : : : ; n;
should all lie on the straight line with y-intercept a and slope b (as determined by
the function of P on the right-hand side in Eq. (2)).
This observation provides a way to ﬁnd a and b. If we can determine the ap-
proximate values of the derivatives P 0
1; P 0
2; : : : corresponding to the given population
data, then we can proceed with the following agenda:

First plot the points .P1; P 0
1=P1/, .P2; P 0
2=P2/, : : : on a sheet of graph paper
with horizontal P -axis.

Then use a ruler to draw a straight line that appears to approximate these points
well.

Finally, measure this straight line’s y-intercept a and slope b.
But where are we to ﬁnd the needed values of the derivative P 0.t/ of the (as
yet) unknown function P ? It is easiest to use the approximation

2.2 Equilibrium Solutions and Stability
In previous sections we have often used explicit solutions of differential equations
to answer speciﬁc numerical questions. But even when a given differential equation
is difﬁcult or impossible to solve explicitly, it often is possible to extract qualitative
information about general properties of its solutions. For example, we may be able
to establish that every solution x.t/ grows without bound as t ! C1, or approaches
a ﬁnite limit, or is a periodic function of t. In this section we introduce—mainly by
consideration of simple differential equations that can be solved explicitly—some

2.2 Equilibrium Solutions and Stability
87
of the more important qualitative questions that can sometimes be answered for
equations that are difﬁcult or impossible to solve.
Example 1
Let x.t/ denote the temperature of a body with initial temperature x.0/ D x0. At time t D 0
this body is immersed in a medium with constant temperature A. Assuming Newton’s law of
cooling,
dx
dt D k.x  A/
(k > 0
constant);
(1)
we readily solve (by separation of variables) for the explicit solution
x.t/ D A C .x0  A/ekt:
It follows immediately that
lim
t!1 x.t/ D A;
(2)
so the temperature of the body approaches that of the surrounding medium (as is evident to
one’s intuition). Note that the constant function x.t/  A is a solution of Eq. (1); it corre-
sponds to the temperature of the body when it is in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding
medium. In Fig. 2.2.1 the limit in (2) means that every other solution curve approaches the
equilibrium solution curve x D A asymptotically as t ! C1.

FIGURE 2.2.1.
Typical solution
curves for the equation of Newton’s
law of cooling, dx=dt D k.x  A/.
Remark The behavior of solutions of Eq. (1) is summarized brieﬂy by the phase diagram
in Fig. 2.2.2—which indicates the direction (or “phase”) of change in x as a function of x
itself. The right-hand side f .x/ D k.x  A/ D k.A  x/ is positive if x < A, negative if
x > A. This observation corresponds to the fact that solutions starting above the line x D A
x = A
x < A
x > A
x' < 0
x' > 0
FIGURE 2.2.2.
Phase diagram for
the equation
dx=dt D f .x/ D k.A  x/.
and those starting below it both approach the limiting solution x.t/  A as t increases (as
indicated by the arrows).
In Section 2.1 we introduced the general population equation
dx
dt D .ˇ  ı/x;
(3)
where ˇ and ı are the birth and death rates, respectively, in births or deaths per
individual per unit of time. The question of whether a population x.t/ is bounded or
unbounded as t ! C1 is of evident interest. In many situations—like the logistic
and explosion=extinction populations of Section 2.1—the birth and death rates are
known functions of x. Then Eq. (3) takes the form
dx
dt D f .x/:
(4)
This is an autonomous ﬁrst-order differential equation—one in which the indepen-
dent variable t does not appear explicitly (the terminology here stemming from the
Greek word autonomos for “independent,” e.g., of the time t). As in Example 1,
the solutions of the equation f .x/ D 0 play an important role and are called critical
points of the autonomous differential equation dx=dt D f .x/.
If x D c is a critical point of Eq. (4), then the differential equation has the
constant solution x.t/  c. A constant solution of a differential equation is some-
times called an equilibrium solution (one may think of a population that remains
constant because it is in “equilibrium” with its environment). Thus the critical point
x D c, a number, corresponds to the equilibrium solution x.t/  c, a constant-valued
function.
Example 2 illustrates the fact that the qualitative behavior (as t increases) of
the solutions of an autonomous ﬁrst-order equation can be described in terms of its
critical points.

Chapter 2 Mathematical Models and Numerical Methods
Example 2
Consider the logistic differential equation
dx
dt D kx.M  x/
(5)
(with k > 0 and M > 0). It has two critical points—the solutions x D 0 and x D M of the
equation
f .x/ D kx.M  x/ D 0:
In Section 2.1 we discussed the logistic-equation solution
x.t/ D
Mx0
x0 C .M  x0/ekMt
(6)
satisfying the initial condition x.0/ D x0. Note that the initial values x0 D 0 and x0 D M
yield the equilibrium solutions x.t/  0 and x.t/  M of Eq. (5).
We observed in Section 2.1 that if x0 > 0, then x.t/ ! M as t ! C1. But if x0 < 0,
then the denominator in Eq. (6) initially is positive, but vanishes when
t D t1 D
1
kM ln M  x0
x0
> 0:
Because the numerator in (6) is negative in this case, it follows that
lim
t!t

if
x0 < 0:
It follows that the solution curves of the logistic equation in (5) look as illustrated in

Typical solution
curves for the logistic equation
dx=dt D kx.M  x/.
Fig. 2.2.3. Here we see graphically that every solution either approaches the equilibrium
solution x.t/  M as t increases, or (in a visually obvious sense) diverges away from the
other equilibrium solution x.t/  0.
Stability of Critical Points
Figure 2.2.3 illustrates the concept of stability. A critical point x D c of an au-
tonomous ﬁrst-order equation is said to be stable provided that, if the initial value
x0 is sufﬁciently close to c, then x.t/ remains close to c for all t > 0. More precisely,
the critical point c is stable if, for each 
 > 0, there exists ı > 0 such that
jx0  cj < ı
implies that
jx.t/  cj < 
(7)
for all t > 0. The critical point x D c is unstable if it is not stable.
Figure 2.2.4 shows a “wider view” of the solution curves of a logistic equation
with k D 1 and M D 4. Note that the strip 3:5 < x < 4:5 enclosing the stable

Remark 1
We can summarize the behavior of solutions of the logistic equation in (5)—in
terms of their initial values—by means of the phase diagram shown in Fig. 2.2.5. It indicates
that x.t/ ! M as t ! C1 if either x0 > M or 0 < x0 < M, whereas x.t/ ! 1 as t

increases if x0 < 0. The fact that M is a stable critical point would be important, for instance,
if we wished to conduct an experiment with a population of M bacteria. It is impossible to
count precisely M bacteria for M large, but any initially positive population will approach
M as t increases.

is the “predictability” of M for an actual population. The coefﬁcients a and b are unlikely
to be known precisely for an actual population. But if they are replaced with close approx-
imations a? and b?—derived perhaps from empirical measurements—then the approximate
limiting population M ? D a?=b? will be close to the actual limiting population M D a=b. We
may therefore say that the value M of the limiting population predicted by a logistic equation
not only is a stable critical point of the differential equation, but this value also is “stable”
with respect to small perturbations of the constant coefﬁcients in the equation. (Note that one
of these two statements involves changes in the initial value x0; the other involves changes in
the coefﬁcients a and b.)
Example 3
Consider now the explosion=extinction equation
dx

of Eq. (10) in Section 2.1. Like the logistic equation, it has the two critical points x D 0 and
x D M corresponding to the equilibrium solutions x.t/  0 and x.t/  M. According to
Problem 33 in Section 2.1, its solution with x.0/ D x0 is given by
x.t/ D

(with only a single difference in sign from the logistic solution in (6)). If x0 < M, then (be-
cause the coefﬁcient of the exponential in the denominator is positive) it follows immediately
from Eq. (10) that x.t/ ! 0 as t ! C1. But if x0 > M, then the denominator in (10) initially
is positive, but vanishes when

The behavior of the solutions of Eq. (9) is summarized by the phase diagram in Fig. 2.2.7,

Harvesting a Logistic Population
The autonomous differential equation
dx
dt D ax  bx2  h
(11)
(with a, b, and h all positive) may be considered to describe a logistic population
with harvesting. For instance, we might think of the population of ﬁsh in a lake
from which h ﬁsh per year are removed by ﬁshing.
Example 4
Let us rewrite Eq. (11) in the form
dx
dt D kx.M  x/  h;
(12)
which exhibits the limiting population M in the case h D 0 of no harvesting. Assuming
hereafter that h > 0, we can solve the quadratic equation kx2 C kMx  h D 0 for the two

assuming that the harvesting rate h is sufﬁciently small that 4h < kM 2, so both roots H and
N are real with 0 < H < N < M. Then we can rewrite Eq. (12) in the form
dx
dt D k.N  x/.x  H/:
(14)
For instance, the number of critical points of the equation may change abruptly as the value
of a parameter is changed. In Problem 24 we ask you to solve this equation for the solution

Note that the exponent k.N  H/t is negative for t > 0. If x0 > N, then each of the
coefﬁcients within parentheses in Eq. (15) is positive; it follows that
If
x0 > N
then

assuming that 4h < kM 2—look as illustrated in Fig. 2.2.8. (Can you visualize a funnel along
the line x D N and a spout along the line x D H?) Thus the constant solution x.t/  N is an
equilibrium limiting solution, whereas x.t/  H is a threshold solution that separates differ-
ent behaviors—the population approaches N if x0 > H, while it becomes extinct because of
harvesting if x0 < H. Finally, the stable critical point x D N and the unstable critical point
x D H are illustrated in the phase diagram in Fig. 2.2.9.

Example 5
For a concrete application of our stability conclusions in Example 4, suppose that k D 1 and
M D 4 for a logistic population x.t/ of ﬁsh in a lake, measured in hundreds after t years.
Without any ﬁshing at all, the lake would eventually contain nearly 400 ﬁsh, whatever the
initial population. Now suppose that h D 3, so that 300 ﬁsh are “harvested” annually (at
a constant rate throughout the year). Equation (12) is then dx=dt D x.4  x/  3, and the
quadratic equation
x2 C 4x  3 D .3  x/.x  1/ D 0
has solutions H D 1 and N D 3. Thus the threshold population is 100 ﬁsh and the (new)
limiting population is 300 ﬁsh. In short, if the lake is stocked initially with more than 100
ﬁsh, then as t increases, the ﬁsh population will approach a limiting value of 300 ﬁsh. But
if the lake is stocked initially with fewer than 100 ﬁsh, then the lake will be “ﬁshed out” and
the ﬁsh will disappear entirely within a ﬁnite period of time.
Bifurcation and Dependence on Parameters
A biological or physical system that is modeled by a differential equation may de-
pend crucially on the numerical values of certain coefﬁcients or parameters that
appear in the equation. For instance, the number of critical points of the equation
may change abruptly as the value of a parameter is changed.
Example 6
The differential equation
dx
dt D x.4  x/  h
(19)
(with x in hundreds) models the harvesting of a logistic population with k D 1 and limiting
population M D 4 (hundred). In Example 5 we considered the case of harvesting level h D 3,
and found that the new limiting population is N D 3 hundred and the threshold population is
H D 1 hundred. Typical solution curves, including the equilibrium solutions x.t/  3 and
x.t/  1, then look like those pictured in Fig. 2.2.8.

2.2 Equilibrium Solutions and Stability
91
Now let’s investigate the dependence of this picture upon the harvesting level h. Ac-
cording to Eq. (13) with k D 1 and M D 4, the limiting and threshold populations N and H
are given by
H; N D 1

(20)
If h < 4—we can consider negative values of h to describe stocking rather than harvesting
the ﬁsh—then there are distinct equilibrium solutions x.t/  N and x.t/  H with N > H
as in Fig. 2.2.8.
But if h D 4, then Eq. (20) gives N D H D 2, so the differential equation has only the
single equilibrium solution x.t/  2. In this case the solution curves of the equation look like
those illustrated in Fig. 2.2.10. If the initial number x0 (in hundreds) of ﬁsh exceeds 2, then
the population approaches a limiting population of 2 (hundred ﬁsh). However, any initial
population x0 < 2 (hundred) results in extinction with the ﬁsh dying out as a consequence
of the harvesting of 4 hundred ﬁsh annually. The critical point x D 2 might therefore be

Solution curves of

If, ﬁnally, h > 4, then the quadratic equation corresponding to (20) has no real solu-
tions and the differential equation in (19) has no equilibrium solutions. The solution curves
then look like those illustrated in Fig. 2.2.11, and (whatever the initial number of ﬁsh) the
population dies out as a result of the excessive harvesting.
If we imagine turning a dial to gradually increase the value of the parameter h
in Eq. (19), then the picture of the solution curves changes from one like Fig. 2.2.8
with h < 4, to Fig. 2.2.10 with h D 4, to one like Fig. 2.2.11 with h > 4. Thus the
differential equation has

two critical points if h < 4 ;

one critical point if h D 4 ;

no critical point if h > 4.
The value h D 4—for which the qualitative nature of the solutions changes as h
increases—is called a bifurcation point for the differential equation containing the
parameter h. A common way to visualize the corresponding “bifurcation” in the
solutions is to plot the bifurcation diagram consisting of all points .h; c/, where
c is a critical point of the equation x0 D x.4  x/ C h . For instance, if we rewrite
Eq. (20) as
c D 2 ˙
p
4  h;
.c  2/2 D 4  h;
where either c D N or c D H, then we get the equation of the parabola that is shown
in Fig. 2.2.12. This parabola is then the bifurcation diagram for our differential
equation that models a logistic ﬁsh population with harvesting at the level speciﬁed
by the parameter h.

2.2 Problems
In Problems 1 through 12 ﬁrst solve the equation f .x/ D 0
to ﬁnd the critical points of the given autonomous differential
equation dx=dt D f .x/. Then analyze the sign of f .x/ to de-
termine whether each critical point is stable or unstable, and
construct the corresponding phase diagram for the differen-
tial equation. Next, solve the differential equation explicitly
for x.t/ in terms of t. Finally, use either the exact solution
or a computer-generated slope ﬁeld to sketch typical solution
curves for the given differential equation, and verify visually
the stability of each critical point.

a logistic population with harvesting at rate h. Determine

a population with stocking at rate s. Determine the depen-

21. Consider the differential equation dx=dt D kx  x3.

x is stable. (b) If k > 0, show that the critical point c D 0
is now unstable, but that the critical points c D ˙
p
k are
stable. Thus the qualitative nature of the solutions changes
at k D 0 as the parameter k increases, and so k D 0 is a
bifurcation point for the differential equation with param-
eter k. The plot of all points of the form .k; c/ where c is a
critical point of the equation x0 D kx x3 is the “pitchfork
diagram” shown in Fig. 2.2.13.

taining the parameter k. Analyze (as in Problem 21) the
dependence of the number and nature of the critical points
on the value of k, and construct the corresponding bifur-
cation diagram.
23. Suppose that the logistic equation dx=dt D kx.M  x/
models a population x.t/ of ﬁsh in a lake after t months
during which no ﬁshing occurs. Now suppose that, be-
cause of ﬁshing, ﬁsh are removed from the lake at the rate
of hx ﬁsh per month (with h a positive constant). Thus
ﬁsh are “harvested” at a rate proportional to the existing
ﬁsh population, rather than at the constant rate of Exam-
ple 4.
(a) If 0 < h < kM, show that the population is
still logistic. What is the new limiting population? (b) If
h = kM, show that x.t/ ! 0 are t ! C1, so the lake is
eventually ﬁshed out.
24. Separate variables in the logistic harvesting equation
dx=dt D k.N  x/.x  H/ and then use partial fractions
to derive the solution given in Eq. (15).

of the solution in (15) to establish the conclusions stated
in (17) and (18).
Example 4 dealt with the case 4h > kM 2 in the equation
dx=dt D kx.M  x/  h that describes constant-rate harvest-
ing of a logistic population. Problems 26 and 27 deal with the
other cases.
26. If 4h D kM 2, show that typical solution curves look
as illustrated in Fig. 2.2.14.
Thus if x0 = M=2, then
x.t/ ! M=2 as t ! C1. But if x0 < M=2, then x.t/ D 0
after a ﬁnite period of time, so the lake is ﬁshed out. The
critical point x D M=2 might be called semistable, because
it looks stable from one side, unstable from the other.

population approaches a limiting population N that is less

population reaches extinction.

2.3 Acceleration–Velocity Models
In Section 1.2 we discussed vertical motion of a mass m near the surface of the earth
under the inﬂuence of constant gravitational acceleration. If we neglect any effects
of air resistance, then Newton’s second law .F D ma) implies that the velocity v of
the mass m satisﬁes the equation
mdv
dt D FG;
(1)
where FG D mg is the (downward-directed) force of gravity, where the gravita-
tional acceleration is g  9:8 m=s2 (in mks units; g  32 ft=s2 in fps units).
Example 1
Suppose that a crossbow bolt is shot straight upward from the ground (y0 D 0) with initial
velocity v0 D 49 (m=s). Then Eq. (1) with g D 9:8 gives
dv
dt D 9:8;
so
v.t/ D .9:8/t C v0 D .9:8/t C 49:
Hence the bolt’s height function y.t/ is given by
y.t/ D
Z
Œ.9:8/t C 49 dt D .4:9/t2 C 49t C y0 D .4:9/t2 C 49t:
The bolt reaches its maximum height when v D .9:8/t C 49 D 0, hence when t D 5 (s).
Thus its maximum height is
ymax D y.5/ D .4:9/.52/ C .49/.5/ D 122.5 (m):
The bolt returns to the ground when y D .4:9/t.t  10/ D 0, and thus after 10 seconds
aloft.
Now we want to take account of air resistance in a problem like Example 1.
The force FR exerted by air resistance on the moving mass m must be added in
Eq. (1), so now
mdv
dt D FG C FR:
(2)

Chapter 2 Mathematical Models and Numerical Methods
Newton showed in his Principia Mathematica that certain simple physical assump-
tions imply that FR is proportional to the square of the velocity: FR D kv2. But
empirical investigations indicate that the actual dependence of air resistance on ve-
locity can be quite complicated. For many purposes it sufﬁces to assume that
FR D kvp;
where 1 5 p 5 2 and the value of k depends on the size and shape of the body, as
well as the density and viscosity of the air. Generally speaking, p D 1 for relatively
low speeds and p D 2 for high speeds, whereas 1 < p < 2 for intermediate speeds.
But how slow “low speed” and how fast “high speed” are depend on the same factors
that determine the value of the coefﬁcient k.
Thus air resistance is a complicated physical phenomenon. But the simplify-
ing assumption that FR is exactly of the form given here, with either p D 1 or p D 2,
yields a tractable mathematical model that exhibits the most important qualitative
features of motion with resistance.
Resistance Proportional to Velocity

of air resistance that is proportional to velocity (so that p D 1) and of course directed
opposite the direction of motion of the body. If we set up a coordinate system with
the positive y-direction upward and with y D 0 at ground level, then FG D mg
and
FR D kv;
(3)
where k is a positive constant and v D dy=dt is the velocity of the body. Note that
the minus sign in Eq. (3) makes FR positive (an upward force) if the body is falling
(v is negative) and makes FR negative (a downward force) if the body is rising (v is
positive). As indicated in Fig. 2.3.1, the net force acting on the body is then
F D FR C FG D kv  mg;
and Newton’s law of motion F D m.dv=dt/ yields the equation
mdv
dt D kv  mg:
Thus
dv
dt D v  g;
(4)
where  D k=m > 0. You should verify for yourself that if the positive y-axis were
directed downward, then Eq. (4) would take the form dv=dt D v C g.
Equation (4) is a separable ﬁrst-order differential equation, and its solution is

Thus the speed of a body falling with air resistance does not increase indeﬁnitely;
instead, it approaches a ﬁnite limiting speed, or terminal speed,

This fact is what makes a parachute a practical invention; it even helps explain
the occasional survival of people who fall without parachutes from high-ﬂying air-
planes.
We now rewrite Eq. (5) in the form

Integration gives
y.t/ D 1
.v0  v/et C vt C C:
We substitute 0 for t and let y0 D y.0/ denote the initial height of the body. Thus
we ﬁnd that C D y0 C .v0  v/=, and so
y.t/ D y0 C vt C 1
.v0  v/.1  et/:
(9)
Equations (8) and (9) give the velocity v and height y of a body moving ver-
tically under the inﬂuence of gravity and air resistance. The formulas depend on
the initial height y0 of the body, its initial velocity v0, and the drag coefﬁcient ,
the constant such that the acceleration due to air resistance is aR D v. The two
equations also involve the terminal velocity v deﬁned in Eq. (6).
For a person descending with the aid of a parachute, a typical value of  is 1:5,
which corresponds to a terminal speed of jvj  21:3 ft=s, or about 14:5 mi=h. With
an unbuttoned overcoat ﬂapping in the wind in place of a parachute, an unlucky
skydiver might increase  to perhaps as much as 0:5, which gives a terminal speed
of jvj  65 ft=s, about 44 mi=h. See Problems 10 and 11 for some parachute-jump
computations.
Example 2
We again consider a bolt shot straight upward with initial velocity v0 D 49 m=s from a
crossbow at ground level. But now we take air resistance into account, with  D 0:04 in
Eq. (4). We ask how the resulting maximum height and time aloft compare with the values
found in Example 1.
Solution
We substitute y0 D 0, v0 D 49, and v D g= D 245 in Eqs. (5) and (9), and obtain
v.t/ D 294et=25  245;
y.t/ D 7350  245t  7350et=25:
To ﬁnd the time required for the bolt to reach its maximum height (when v D 0), we solve
the equation
v.t/ D 294et=25  245 D 0
for tm D 25 ln.294=245/  4:558 (s). Its maximum height is then ymax D v.tm/  108:280
meters (as opposed to 122:5 meters without air resistance). To ﬁnd when the bolt strikes the
ground, we must solve the equation
y.t/ D 7350  245t  7350et=25 D 0:
Using Newton’s method, we can begin with the initial guess t0 D 10 and carry out the iteration
tnC1 D tn  y.tn/=y0.tn/ to generate successive approximations to the root. Or we can simply

96
Chapter 2 Mathematical Models and Numerical Methods
use the Solve command on a calculator or computer. We ﬁnd that the bolt is in the air for
tf  9:411 seconds (as opposed to 10 seconds without air resistance). It hits the ground with
a reduced speed of jv.tf/j  43:227 m=s (as opposed to its initial velocity of 49 m=s).
Thus the effect of air resistance is to decrease the bolt’s maximum height, the total
time spent aloft, and its ﬁnal impact speed. Note also that the bolt now spends more time in
descent (tf  tm  4:853 s) than in ascent (tm  4:558 s).
Resistance Proportional to Square of Velocity
Now we assume that the force of air resistance is proportional to the square of the
velocity:
FR D ˙kv2;
(10)
with k > 0. The choice of signs here depends on the direction of motion, which
the force of resistance always opposes. Taking the positive y-direction as upward,
FR < 0 for upward motion (when v > 0) while FR > 0 for downward motion (when
v < 0). Thus the sign of FR is always opposite that of v, so we can rewrite Eq. (10)
as
FR D kvjvj:

our crossbow bolt—between linear air resistance and air resistance proportional to the square
of the velocity. And in Fig. 2.3.2, where the corresponding height functions are graphed, the
difference is hardly visible. However, the difference between linear and nonlinear resistance
can be signiﬁcant in more complex situations—such as, for instance, the atmospheric reentry
and descent of a space vehicle.
Variable Gravitational Acceleration
Unless a projectile in vertical motion remains in the immediate vicinity of the earth’s
surface, the gravitational acceleration acting on it is not constant. According to
Newton’s law of gravitation, the gravitational force of attraction between two point
masses M and m located at a distance r apart is given by
F D GMm
r2
;
(19)
where G is a certain empirical constant (G  6:6726  1011 N(m=kg)2 in mks
units). The formula is also valid if either or both of the two masses are homogeneous
spheres; in this case, the distance r is measured between the centers of the spheres.
The following example is similar to Example 2 in Section 1.2, but now we
take account of lunar gravity.
Example 4
A lunar lander is free-falling toward the moon, and at an altitude of 53 kilometers above the
lunar surface its downward velocity is measured at 1477 km/h. Its retrorockets, when ﬁred
in free space, provide a deceleration of T D 4 m/s2. At what height above the lunar surface
should the retrorockets be activated to ensure a “soft touchdown” (v D 0 at impact)?
Solution
Let r.t/ denote the lander’s distance from the center of the moon at time t (Fig. 2.3.3). When
we combine the (constant) thrust acceleration T and the (negative) lunar acceleration F=m D
GM=r2 of Eq. (19), we get the (acceleration) differential equation
d 2r

(20)
where M D 7:35  1022 (kg) is the mass of the moon, which has a radius of R D 1:74  106
meters (or 1740 km, a little over a quarter of the earth’s radius). Noting that this second-order
differential equation does not involve the independent variable t, we substitute

where the constant C2 D 4R  GM=R is obtained by substituting the values v D 0, r D R

At the instant of ignition the lunar lander’s position and velocity satisfy both (21a)
and (21b). Therefore we can ﬁnd its desired height h above the lunar surface at ignition by
equating the right-hand sides in (21a) and (21b). This gives r D 1

Moreover, substitution of this value of r in (21a) gives the velocity v D 450 m/s at the
instant of ignition.

of the initial velocity necessary for a projectile ﬁred from the surface of the earth
to reach the moon. Similarly, we can ask what initial velocity v0 is necessary for
the projectile to escape from the earth altogether. This will be so if its velocity
v D dr=dt remains positive for all t > 0, so it continues forever to move away from
the earth. With r.t/ denoting the projectile’s distance from the earth’s center at time
t (Fig. 2.3.4), we have the equation
dv
dt D d 2r
dt2 D GM

(22)
similar to Eq. (20), but with T D 0 (no thrust) and with M D 5:975  1024 (kg)
denoting the mass of the earth, which has an equatorial radius of R D 6:378  106
(m). Substitution of the chain rule expression dv=dt D v.dv=dr/ as in Example 4
gives

Chapter 2 Mathematical Models and Numerical Methods
In Problem 27 we ask you to show that, if the projectile’s initial velocity exceeds
p
2GM=R, then r.t/ ! 1 as t ! 1, so it does, indeed, “escape” from the earth.
With the given values of G and the earth’s mass M and radius R, this gives v0 
11;180 (m=s) (about 36,680 ft=s, about 6:95 mi=s, about 25,000 mi=h).
Remark Equation (24) gives the escape velocity for any other (spherical) planetary body
when we use its mass and radius. For instance, when we use the mass M and radius R for the
moon given in Example 4, we ﬁnd that escape velocity from the lunar surface is v0  2375
m=s. This is just over one-ﬁfth of the escape velocity from the earth’s surface, a fact that
greatly facilitates the return trip (“From the Moon to the Earth”).

ference between 250 km=h and the velocity of this sports

consistent with the observed behaviors of x.t/ as t ! 1?

8. Rework both parts of Problem 7, with the sole difference
that the deceleration due to air resistance now is .0:001/v2

and  D 1:5 with the parachute. (Suggestion: First deter-
mine her height above the ground and velocity when the
parachute opens.)
11. According to a newspaper account, a paratrooper survived
a training jump from 1200 ft when his parachute failed to
open but provided some resistance by ﬂapping unopened

falling for 8 s. Test the accuracy of this account. (Sugges-
tion:

the bolt reaches its maximum height of about 108:47 m in
about 4:61 s.
18. Continuing Problem 17, suppose that the bolt is now
dropped (v0 D 0) from a height of y0 D 108:47 m. Then
use Eqs. (16) and (17) to show that it hits the ground about
4:80 s later with an impact speed of about 43:49 m=s.
19. A motorboat starts from rest (initial velocity v.0/ D v0 D

To derive the equation of motion of the rocket, we use Newton’s second law

where P is momentum (the product of mass and velocity) and F denotes net external

But here m is not constant. Suppose m changes to m C m and v to v C v
during the short time interval from t to t C t. Then the change in the momentum
of the rocket itself is
P  .m C m/.v C v/  mv D m v C v m C m v:
But the system also includes the exhaust gases expelled during this time interval,
with mass m and approximate velocity v  c. Hence the total change in momen-
tum during the time interval t is
P  .m v C v m C m v/ C .m/.v  c/
D m v C c m C m v:
Now we divide by t and take the limit as t ! 0, so m ! 0, assuming continuity
of m.t/. The substitution of the resulting expression for dP=dt in (1) yields the

PROBLEM 4
The V-2 rocket that was used to attack London in World War II had
an initial mass of 12,850 kg, of which 68.5% was fuel. This fuel burned uniformly
for 70 seconds with an exhaust velocity of 2 km/s. Assume it encounters air resis-
tance of 1.45 N per m/s of velocity. Then ﬁnd the velocity and altitude of the V-2 at
burnout under the assumption that it is launched vertically upward from rest on the
ground.

Chapter 2 Mathematical Models and Numerical Methods
PROBLEM 5
Actually, our basic differential equation in (3) applies without qual-
iﬁcation only when the rocket is already in motion. However, when a rocket is
sitting on its launch pad stand and its engines are turned on initially, it is observed
that a certain time interval passes before the rocket actually “blasts off” and begins
to ascend. The reason is that if v D 0 in (3), then the resulting initial acceleration
dv
dt D c
m

dt  g
of the rocket may be negative. But the rocket does not descend into the ground;
it just “sits there” while (because m is decreasing) this calculated acceleration in-
creases until it reaches 0 and (thereafter) positive values so the rocket can begin to
ascend. With the notation introduced to describe the constant-thrust case, show that
the rocket initially just “sits there” if the exhaust velocity c is less than m0g=ˇ, and
that the time tB which then elapses before actual blastoff is given by
tB D m0g  ˇc
ˇg
:
Free Space
Suppose ﬁnally that the rocket is accelerating in free space, where there is neither
gravity nor resistance, so g D k D 0. With g D 0 in Eq. (8) we see that, as the mass
of the rocket decreases from m0 to m1, its increase in velocity is
v D v1  v0 D c ln m0
m1
:
(11)
Note that v depends only on the exhaust gas speed c and the initial-to-ﬁnal mass
ratio m0=m1, but does not depend on the burn rate ˇ. For example, if the rocket
blasts off from rest (v0 D 0) and c D 5 km/s and m0=m1 D 20, then its velocity at
burnout is v1 D 5 ln 20  15 km/s. Thus if a rocket initially consists predominantly
of fuel, then it can attain velocities signiﬁcantly greater than the (relative) velocity
of its exhaust gases.
2.4 Numerical Approximation: Euler’s Method
It is the exception rather than the rule when a differential equation of the general
form
dy
dx D f .x; y/
can be solved exactly and explicitly by elementary methods like those discussed in
Chapter 1. For example, consider the simple equation
dy
dx D ex2:
(1)
A solution of Eq. (1) is simply an antiderivative of ex2. But it is known that every
antiderivative of f .x/ D ex2 is a nonelementary function—one that cannot be
expressed as a ﬁnite combination of the familiar functions of elementary calculus.
Hence no particular solution of Eq. (1) is ﬁnitely expressible in terms of elementary
functions. Any attempt to use the symbolic techniques of Chapter 1 to ﬁnd a simple
explicit formula for a solution of (1) is therefore doomed to failure.

2.4 Numerical Approximation: Euler’s Method
105
As a possible alternative, an old-fashioned computer plotter—one that uses an
ink pen to draw curves mechanically—can be programmed to draw a solution curve
that starts at the initial point .x0; y0/ and attempts to thread its way through the slope
ﬁeld of a given differential equation y0 D f .x; y/. The procedure the plotter carries
out can be described as follows.

The plotter pen starts at the initial point .x0; y0/ and moves a tiny distance
along the slope segment though .x0; y0/. This takes it to the point .x1; y1/.

At .x1; y1/ the pen changes direction, and now moves a tiny distance along
the slope segment through this new starting point .x1; y1/. This takes it to the
next starting point .x2; y2/.

At .x2; y2/ the pen changes direction again, and now moves a tiny distance
along the slope segment through .x2; y2/. This takes it to the next starting
point .x3; y3/.
Figure 2.4.1 illustrates the result of continuing in this fashion—by a sequence

see a polygonal curve consisting of line segments that connect the successive points
.x0; y0/; .x1; y1/; .x2; y2/; .x3; y3/; : : : However, suppose that each “tiny distance”
the pen travels along a slope segment—before the midcourse correction that sends
it along a fresh new slope segment—is so very small that the naked eye cannot
distinguish the individual line segments constituting the polygonal curve. Then the
resulting polygonal curve looks like a smooth, continuously turning solution curve
of the differential equation. Indeed, this is (in essence) how most of the solution
curves shown in the ﬁgures of Chapter 1 were computer generated.
Leonhard Euler—the great 18th-century mathematician for whom so many
mathematical concepts, formulas, methods, and results are named—did not have a
computer plotter, and his idea was to do all this numerically rather than graphically.
In order to approximate the solution of the initial value problem
dy
dx D f .x; y/;
y.x0/ D y0;
(2)
we ﬁrst choose a ﬁxed (horizontal) step size h to use in making each step from
one point to the next. Suppose we’ve started at the initial point .x0; y0/ and after
n steps have reached the point .xn; yn/. Then the step from .xn; yn/ to the next
point .xnC1; ynC1/ is illustrated in Fig. 2.4.2. The slope of the direction segment

through .xn; yn/ is m D f .xn; yn/. Hence a horizontal change of h from xn to
xnC1 corresponds to a vertical change of m  h D h  f .xn; yn/ from yn to ynC1.
Therefore the coordinates of the new point .xnC1; ynC1/ are given in terms of the

The iterative formula in (3) tells us how to make the typical step from yn to
ynC1 and is the heart of Euler’s method. Although the most important applications
of Euler’s method are to nonlinear equations, we ﬁrst illustrate the method with a
simple initial value problem whose exact solution is available, just for the purpose
of comparison of approximate and actual solutions.

High accuracy with Euler’s method usually requires a very small step size and
hence a larger number of steps than can reasonably be carried out by hand. The
application material for this section contains calculator and computer programs for
automating Euler’s method. One of these programs was used to calculate the table
entries shown in Fig. 2.4.4. We see that 500 Euler steps (with step size h D 0:002)
from x D 0 to x D 1 yield values that are accurate to within 0.001.

accurate to within about 1 ft/s. Note also that after 10 seconds the falling ball has attained

Local and Cumulative Errors
There are several sources of error in Euler’s method that may make the approxima-
tion yn to y.xn/ unreliable for large values of n, those for which xn is not sufﬁciently
close to x0. The error in the linear approximation formula
y.xnC1/  yn C h  f .xn; yn/ D ynC1
(6)

2.4 Numerical Approximation: Euler’s Method
109
is the amount by which the tangent line at .xn; yn/ departs from the solution curve
through .xn; yn/, as illustrated in Fig. 2.4.6. This error, introduced at each step in
the process, is called the local error in Euler’s method.
The local error indicated in Fig. 2.4.6 would be the total error in ynC1 if the
starting point yn in (6) were an exact value, rather than merely an approximation
to the actual value y.xn/. But yn itself suffers from the accumulated effects of all
the local errors introduced at the previous steps. Thus the tangent line in Fig. 2.4.6
is tangent to the “wrong” solution curve—the one through .xn; yn/ rather than the
actual solution curve through the initial point .x0; y0/. Figure 2.4.7 illustrates this
cumulative error in Euler’s method; it is the amount by which the polygonal step-
wise path from .x0; y0/ departs from the actual solution curve through .x0; y0/.

The usual way of attempting to reduce the cumulative error in Euler’s method
is to decrease the step size h. The table in Fig. 2.4.8 shows the results obtained in
approximating the exact solution y.x/ D 2ex  x  1 of the initial value problem
dy
dx D x C y;
y.0/ D 1;
using the successively smaller step sizes h D 0:1, h D 0:02, h D 0:005, and h D
0:001. We show computed values only at intervals of x D 0:1. For instance, with
h D 0:001, the computation required 1000 Euler steps, but the value yn is shown
only when n is a multiple of 100, so that xn is an integral multiple of 0:1.
By scanning the columns in Fig. 2.4.8 we observe that, for each ﬁxed step
size h, the error yactual  yapprox increases as x gets farther from the starting point
x0 D 0. But by scanning the rows of the table we see that for each ﬁxed x, the
error decreases as the step size h is reduced. The percentage errors at the ﬁnal point
x D 1 range from 7:25% with h D 0:1 down to only 0:08% with h D 0:001. Thus the
smaller the step size, the more slowly does the error grow with increasing distance
from the starting point.

FIGURE 2.4.8.
Approximating the solution of dy=dx D x C y, y.0/ D 1 with successively
smaller step sizes.
The column of data for h D 0:1 in Fig. 2.4.8 requires only 10 steps, so Euler’s
method can be carried out with a hand-held calculator. But 50 steps are required to
reach x D 1 with h D 0:02, 200 steps with h D 0:005, and 1000 steps with h D 0:001.
A computer is almost always used to implement Euler’s method when more than 10
or 20 steps are required. Once an appropriate computer program has been written,
one step size is—in principle—just as convenient as another; after all, the computer
hardly cares how many steps it is asked to carry out.
Why, then, do we not simply choose an exceedingly small step size (such as
h D 1012), with the expectation that very great accuracy will result? There are two
reasons for not doing so. The ﬁrst is obvious: the time required for the computation.
For example, the data in Fig. 2.4.8 were obtained using a hand-held calculator that
carried out nine Euler steps per second. Thus it required slightly over one second
to approximate y.1/ with h D 0:1 and about 1 min 50 s with h D 0:001. But with
h D 1012 it would require over 3000 years!
The second reason is more subtle. In addition to the local and cumulative
errors discussed previously, the computer itself will contribute roundoff error at
each stage because only ﬁnitely many signiﬁcant digits can be used in each calcu-
lation. An Euler’s method computation with h D 0:0001 will introduce roundoff
errors 1000 times as often as one with h D 0:1. Hence with certain differential equa-
tions, h D 0:1 might actually produce more accurate results than those obtained with
h D 0:0001, because the cumulative effect of roundoff error in the latter case might
exceed combined cumulative and roundoff error in the case h D 0:1.
The “best” choice of h is difﬁcult to determine in practice as well as in theory.
It depends on the nature of the function f .x; y/ in the initial value problem in (2), on
the exact code in which the program is written, and on the speciﬁc computer used.
With a step size that is too large, the approximations inherent in Euler’s method
may not be sufﬁciently accurate, whereas if h is too small, then roundoff errors may
accumulate to an unacceptable degree or the program may require too much time to
be practical. The subject of error propagation in numerical algorithms is treated in
numerical analysis courses and textbooks.
The computations in Fig. 2.4.8 illustrate the common strategy of applying a
numerical algorithm, such as Euler’s method, several times in succession, beginning
with a selected number n of subintervals for the ﬁrst application, then doubling n for
each succeeding application of the method. Visual comparison of successive results

often can provide an “intuitive feel” for their accuracy. In the next two examples we
present graphically the results of successive applications of Euler’s method.

solution curves obtained by applying Euler’s method on the interval 0 5 x 5 5 with n D 5, n D
10, and n D 20 subintervals. Each of these “curves” actually consists of line segments joining
successive points .xn; yn/ and .xnC1; ynC1/. The Euler approximation with 5 subintervals
is poor, and the approximation with 10 subintervals also overshoots the limiting value y D 8
of the solution before leveling off, but with 20 subintervals we obtain fairly good qualitative
agreement with the actual behavior of the solution.

with n D 50, n D 100, n D 200, and n D 400 subintervals. Even with this many subintervals,
Euler’s method evidently has considerable difﬁculty keeping up with the oscillations in the
actual solution. Consequently, the more accurate methods discussed in succeeding sections
are needed for serious numerical investigations.
A Word of Caution
The data shown in Fig. 2.4.8 indicate that Euler’s method works well in approximat-
ing the solution of dy=dx D x C y, y.0/ D 1 on the interval Œ0; 1. That is, for each
ﬁxed x it appears that the approximate values approach the actual value of y.x/ as
the step size h is decreased. For instance, the approximate values in the rows corre-
sponding to x D 0:3 and x D 0:5 suggest that y.0:3/  1:40 and y.0:5/  1:80, in
accord with the actual values shown in the ﬁnal column of the table.
Example 5, in contrast, shows that some initial value problems are not so well
behaved.

But instead of naively accepting these results as accurate approximations, we decided
to use a computer to repeat the computations with smaller values of h. The table in Fig. 2.4.11
shows the results obtained with step sizes h D 0:1, h D 0:02, and h D 0:005. Observe that
now the “stability” of the procedure in Example 1 is missing. Indeed, it seems obvious that
something is going wrong near x D 1.
Figure 2.4.12 provides a graphical clue to the difﬁculty. It shows a slope ﬁeld for
dy=dx D x2 C y2, together with a solution curve through .0; 1/ plotted using one of the
more accurate approximation methods of the following two sections. It appears that this
solution curve may have a vertical asymptote near x D 0:97. Indeed, an exact solution using
Bessel functions (see Problem 16 in Section 8.6) can be used to show that y.x/ ! C1 as
x ! 0:969811 (approximately). Although Euler’s method gives values (albeit spurious ones)
at x D 1, the actual solution does not exist on the entire interval Œ0; 1. Moreover, Euler’s
method is unable to “keep up” with the rapid changes in y.x/ that occur as x approaches the
inﬁnite discontinuity near 0:969811.

The moral of Example 5 is that there are pitfalls in the numerical solution of
certain initial value problems. Certainly it’s pointless to attempt to approximate a
solution on an interval where it doesn’t even exist (or where it is not unique, in which
case there’s no general way to predict which way the numerical approximations will

branch at a point of nonuniqueness). One should never accept as accurate the results
of applying Euler’s method with a single ﬁxed step size h. A second “run” with
smaller step size (h=2, say, or h=5, or h=10) may give seemingly consistent results,
thereby suggesting their accuracy, or it may—as in Example 5—reveal the presence
of some hidden difﬁculty in the problem. Many problems simply require the more
accurate and powerful methods that are discussed in the ﬁnal two sections of this
chapter.
2.4 Problems
In Problems 1 through 10, an initial value problem and its ex-

step size h D 0:25, then with step size h D 0:1. Compare the
three-decimal-place values of the two approximations at x D 1

with step size h D 0:005. Make a table showing the approxi-

step sizes h D 0:1, 0:02, 0:004, and 0:0008 to approximate to
four decimal places the values of the solution at ten equally
spaced points of the given interval. Print the results in tabular
form with appropriate headings to make it easy to gauge the
effect of varying the step size h. Throughout, primes denote

propriately, the name BASIC is an acronym describing the Beginner’s All-purpose
Symbolic Instruction Code introduced in 1963, intially for instructional use at Dart-
mouth College.)
To increase the number of steps (and thereby decrease the step size) you need
only change the value of N speciﬁed in the ﬁrst line of the program. To apply Euler’s
method to a different equation dy=dx D f .x; y/, you need change only the single
line that calculates the function value F.
Any other procedural programming language (such as FORTRAN or CCC)
would follow the pattern illustrated by the parallel lines of TI-84 Plus and BASIC
code in Fig. 2.4.13. Some of the modern functional programming languages mirror
standard mathematical notation even more closely. Figure 2.4.14 shows a MATLAB
implementation of Euler’s method. The euler function takes as input the initial
value x, the initial value y, the ﬁnal value x1 of x, and the desired number n of
subintervals. For instance, the MATLAB command
[X, Y] = euler(0, 1, 1, 10)
then generates the xn- and yn-data shown in the ﬁrst two columns of the table of
Fig. 2.4.8.
You should begin this project by implementing Euler’s method with your own
calculator or computer system. Test your program by ﬁrst applying it to the initial
value problem in Example 1, then to some of the problems for this section.

2.5 A Closer Look at the Euler Method
The Euler method as presented in Section 2.4 is not often used in practice, mainly
because more accurate methods are available. But Euler’s method has the advantage
of simplicity, and a careful study of this method yields insights into the workings of
more accurate methods, because many of the latter are extensions or reﬁnements of
the Euler method.
To compare two different methods of numerical approximation, we need some
way to measure the accuracy of each. Theorem 1 tells what degree of accuracy we
can expect when we use Euler’s method.
THEOREM 1
The Error in the Euler Method
Suppose that the initial value problem
dy
dx D f .x; y/;
y.x0/ D y0
(1)
has a unique solution y.x/ on the closed interval Œa; b with a D x0, and assume
that y.x/ has a continuous second derivative on Œa; b. (This would follow from
the assumption that f, fx, and fy are all continuous for a 5 x 5 b and c 5
y 5 d, where c 5 y.x/ 5 d for all x in Œa; b.) Then there exists a constant
C such that the following is true: If the approximations y1; y2; y3; : : : ; yk to the
actual values y.x1/; y.x2/; y.x3/; : : : ; y.xk/ at points of Œa; b are computed using
Euler’s method with step size h > 0, then
jyn  y.xn/j 5 Ch
(2)
for each n D 1; 2; 3; : : : ; k.
Remark The error
yactual  yapprox D y.xn/  yn
in (2) denotes the [cumulative] error in Euler’s method after n steps in the approximation,
exclusive of roundoff error (as though we were using a perfect machine that made no roundoff
errors). The theorem can be summarized by saying that the error in Euler’s method is of order
h; that is, the error is bounded by a [predetermined] constant C multiplied by the step size
h. It follows, for instance, that (on a given closed interval) halving the step size cuts the
maximum error in half; similarly, with step size h=10 we get 10 times the accuracy (that is,
1=10 the maximum error) as with step size h. Consequently, we can—in principle—get any
degree of accuracy we want by choosing h sufﬁciently small.
We will omit the proof of this theorem, but one can be found in Chapter 7 of
G. Birkhoff and G.-C. Rota, Ordinary Differential Equations, 4th ed. (New York:
John Wiley, 1989). The constant C deserves some comment. Because C tends to
increase as the maximum value of jy00.x/j on Œa; b increases, it follows that C must
depend in a fairly complicated way on y, and actual computation of a value of C

2.5 A Closer Look at the Euler Method

such that the inequality in (2) holds is usually impractical. In practice, the following
type of procedure is commonly employed.
1. Apply Euler’s method to the initial value problem in (1) with a reasonable
value of h.
2. Repeat with h=2, h=4, and so forth, at each stage halving the step size for the
next application of Euler’s method.
3. Continue until the results obtained at one stage agree—to an appropriate num-
ber of signiﬁcant digits—with those obtained at the previous stage. Then the
approximate values obtained at this stage are considered likely to be accurate
to the indicated number of signiﬁcant digits.
Example 1
Carry out this procedure with the initial value problem
dy
dx D  2xy
1 C x2 ;
y.0/ D 1
(3)
to approximate accurately the value y.1/ of the solution at x D 1.
Solution
Using an Euler method program, perhaps one of those listed in Figs. 2.4.13 and 2.4.14, we
begin with a step size h D 0:04 requiring n D 25 steps to reach x D 1. The table in Fig. 2.5.1
shows the approximate values of y.1/ obtained with successively smaller values of h. The
data suggest that the true value of y.1/ is exactly 0:5. Indeed, the exact solution of the initial
value problem in (3) is y.x/ D 1=.1 C x2/, so the true value of y.1/ is exactly 1

The ﬁnal column of the table in Fig. 2.5.1 displays the ratio of the magnitude
of the error to h; that is, jyactual  yapproxj=h. Observe how the data in this column
substantiate Theorem 1—in this computation, the error bound in (2) appears to hold
with a value of C slightly larger than 0:1.
An Improvement in Euler’s Method
As Fig. 2.5.2 shows, Euler’s method is rather unsymmetrical. It uses the predicted
slope k D f .xn; yn/ of the graph of the solution at the left-hand endpoint of the
interval Œxn; xn C h as if it were the actual slope of the solution over that entire
interval. We now turn our attention to a way in which increased accuracy can easily
be obtained; it is known as the improved Euler method.

use the Euler method to obtain a ﬁrst estimate—which we now call unC1 rather than
ynC1—of the value of the solution at xnC1 D xn C h. Thus
unC1 D yn C h  f .xn; yn/ D yn C h  k1:
Now that unC1  y.xnC1/ has been computed, we can take
k2 D f .xnC1; unC1/
as a second estimate of the slope of the solution curve y D y.x/ at x D xnC1.
Of course, the approximate slope k1 D f .xn; yn/ at x D xn has already been
calculated. Why not average these two slopes to obtain a more accurate estimate of
the average slope of the solution curve over the entire subinterval Œxn; xnC1? This
idea is the essence of the improved Euler method. Figure 2.5.3 shows the geometry
behind this method.
ALGORITHM
The Improved Euler Method
Given the initial value problem
dy
dx D f .x; y/;
y.x0/ D y0;
the improved Euler method with step size h consists in applying the iterative
formulas
k1 D f .xn; yn/;
unC1 D yn C h  k1;

y.x2/, y.x3/; : : : of the [exact] solution y D y.x/ at the points x1; x2; x3; : : : ,
respectively.
Remark The ﬁnal formula in (5) takes the “Euler form”
ynC1 D yn C h  k
if we write
k D k1 C k2

for the approximate average slope on the interval Œxn; xnC1.
The improved Euler method is one of a class of numerical techniques known
as predictor-corrector methods. First a predictor unC1 of the next y-value is com-
puted; then it is used to correct itself. Thus the improved Euler method with step
size h consists of using the predictor
unC1 D yn C h  f .xn; yn/

Remark Each improved Euler step requires two evaluations of the function f .x; y/, as com-
pared with the single function evaluation required for an ordinary Euler step. We naturally
wonder whether this doubled computational labor is worth the trouble.
Answer
Under the assumption that the exact solution y D y.x/ of the initial value problem
in (4) has a continuous third derivative, it can be proved—see Chapter 7 of Birkhoff and
Rota—that the error in the improved Euler method is of order h2. This means that on a given
bounded interval Œa; b, each approximate value yn satisﬁes the inequality
jy.xn/  ynj 5 Ch2;
(8)
where the constant C does not depend on h. Because h2 is much smaller than h if h itself is
small, this means that the improved Euler method is more accurate than Euler’s method itself.
This advantage is offset by the fact that about twice as many computations are required. But
the factor h2 in (8) means that halving the step size results in 1=4 the maximum error, and
with step size h=10 we get 100 times the accuracy (that is, 1=100 the maximum error) as with
step size h.

method with those obtained previously using the “unimproved” Euler method. When the
same step size h D 0:1 is used, the error in the Euler approximation to y.1/ is 7:25%, but the
error in the improved Euler approximation is only 0:24%.

Indeed, the improved Euler method with h D 0:1 is more accurate (in this example) than
the original Euler method with h D 0:005. The latter requires 200 evaluations of the function
f .x; y/, but the former requires only 20 such evaluations, so in this case the improved Euler
method yields greater accuracy with only about one-tenth the work.
Figure 2.5.5 shows the results obtained when the improved Euler method is applied
to the initial value problem in (9) using step size h D 0:005. Accuracy of ﬁve signiﬁcant
ﬁgures is apparent in the table. This suggests that, in contrast with the original Euler method,
the improved Euler method is sufﬁciently accurate for certain practical applications—such as
plotting solution curves.
An improved Euler program (similar to the ones listed in the project material
for this section) was used to compute approximations to the exact value y.1/ D 0:5

In the following two examples we exhibit graphical results obtained by em-
ploying this strategy of successively halving the step size, and thus doubling the

Figure 2.4.9 shows an obvious difference between the exact solution y.x/ D 8=.1 C 7e8x=3/
and the Euler approximation on 0 5 x 5 5 using n D 20 subintervals. Figure 2.5.7 shows
approximate solution curves plotted using the improved Euler’s method.
The approximation with ﬁve subintervals is still bad—perhaps worse! It appears to
level off considerably short of the actual limiting population M D 8. You should carry out
at least the ﬁrst two improved Euler steps manually to see for yourself how it happens that,
after increasing appropriately during the ﬁrst step, the approximate solution decreases in the
second step rather than continuing to increase (as it should). In the project for this section
we ask you to show empirically that the improved Euler approximate solution with step size
h D 1 levels off at y  4:3542.
In contrast, the approximate solution curve with n D 20 subintervals tracks the exact
solution curve rather closely, and with n D 40 subintervals the exact and approximate solution
curves are indistinguishable in Fig. 2.5.7. The table in Fig. 2.5.8 indicates that the improved
Euler approximation with n D 200 subintervals is accurate rounded to three decimal places
(that is, four signiﬁcant digits) on the interval 0 5 x 5 5. Because discrepancies in the fourth
signiﬁcant digit are not visually apparent at the resolution of an ordinary computer screen,
the improved Euler method (using several hundred subintervals) is considered adequate for
many graphical purposes.

Figure 2.5.9 shows the exact solution curve and approximate solution curves plotted
using the improved Euler method with n D 50, n D 100, and n D 200 subintervals. The
approximation obtained with n D 200 is indistinguishable from the exact solution curve, and
the approximation with n D 100 is only barely distinguishable from it.
Although Figs. 2.5.7 and 2.5.9 indicate that the improved Euler method can
provide accuracy that sufﬁces for many graphical purposes, it does not provide the
higher-precision numerical accuracy that sometimes is needed for more careful in-
vestigations. For instance, consider again the initial value problem
dy
dx D  2xy
1 C x2 ;
y.0/ D 1
of Example 1. The ﬁnal column of the table in Fig. 2.5.6 suggests that, if the im-
proved Euler method is used on the interval 0 5 x 5 1 with n subintervals and step
size h D 1=n, then the resulting error E in the ﬁnal approximation yn  y.1/ is given
by
E D jy.1/  ynj  .0:12/h2 D 0:12
n2 :
If so, then 12-place accuracy (for instance) in the value y.1/ would require that
.0:12/n2 < 5  1013, which means that n = 489;898. Thus, roughly half a million
steps of length h  0:000002 would be required. Aside from the possible imprac-
ticality of this many steps (using available computational resources), the roundoff
error resulting from so many successive steps might well overwhelm the cumula-
tive error predicted by theory (which assumes exact computations in each separate
step). Consequently, still more accurate methods than the improved Euler method
are needed for such high-precision computations. Such a method is presented in
Section 2.6.

other and with the exact solution? If the exact solution

(b) its impact velocity after 9:41 s in the air.
30. Consider now the crossbow bolt of Example 3 in Section
2.3. It still is shot straight upward from the ground with
an initial velocity of 49 m=s, but because of air resistance

The symbolic solution discussed in Section 2.3 required
separate investigations of the bolt’s ascent and its descent,
with v.t/ given by a tangent function during ascent and
by a hyperbolic tangent function during descent. But the
improved Euler method requires no such distinction. Use
a calculator or computer implementation of the improved
Euler method to approximate v.t/ for 0 5 t 5 10 using both
n D 100 and n D 200 subintervals. Display the results at

then generates the ﬁrst and fourth columns of data shown in Fig. 2.5.4.
You should begin this project by implementing the improved Euler method
with your own calculator or computer system. Test your program by applying it
ﬁrst to the initial value problem of Example 1, then to some of the problems for this
section.
Famous Numbers Revisited
The following problems describe the numbers e  2:7182818, ln 2  0:6931472,
and   3:1415927 as speciﬁc values of certain initial value problems. In each case,
apply the improved Euler method with n D 10, 20, 40, : : : subintervals (doubling n
each time). How many subintervals are needed to obtain—twice in succession—the
correct value of the target number rounded to ﬁve decimal places?
1. The number e D y.1/, where y.x/ is the solution of the initial value problem
dy=dx D y, y.0/ D 1.
2. The number ln 2 D y.2/, where y.x/ is the solution of the initial value problem
dy=dx D 1=x, y.1/ D 0.

Logistic Population Investigation
Apply your improved Euler program to the initial value problem dy=dx D 1
3y.8y/,
y.0/ D 1 of Example 3. In particular, verify (as claimed) that the approximate
solution with step size h D 1 levels off at y  4:3542 rather than at the limiting
value y D 8 of the exact solution. Perhaps a table of values for 0 5 x 5 100 will
make this apparent.
For your own logistic population to investigate, consider the initial value prob-
lem
dy
dx D 1
ny.m  y/;
y.0/ D 1
where m and n are (for instance) the largest and smallest nonzero digits in your
student ID number. Does the improved Euler approximation with step size h D 1
level off at the “correct” limiting value of the exact solution? If not, ﬁnd a smaller
value of h so that it does.
Periodic Harvesting and Restocking
The differential equation

models a logistic population that is periodically harvested and restocked with period
P and maximal harvesting/restocking rate h. A numerical approximation program
was used to plot the typical solution curves for the case k D M D h D P D 1 that
are shown in Fig. 2.5.12. This ﬁgure suggests—although it does not prove—the
existence of a threshold initial population such that

Beginning with an initial population above this threshold, the population os-
cillates (perhaps with period P ?) around the (unharvested) stable limiting
population y.t/  M, whereas

The population dies out if it begins with an initial population below this thresh-
old.
Use an appropriate plotting utility to investigate your own logistic population with
periodic harvesting and restocking (selecting typical values of the parameters k, M,
h, and P ). Do the observations indicated here appear to hold for your population?
2.6 The Runge–Kutta Method
We now discuss a method for approximating the solution y D y.x/ of the initial
value problem
dy
dx D f .x; y/;
y.x0/ D y0
(1)
that is considerably more accurate than the improved Euler method and is more
widely used in practice than any of the numerical methods discussed in Sections 2.4
and 2.5. It is called the Runge–Kutta method, after the German mathematicians who
developed it, Carl Runge (1856–1927) and Wilhelm Kutta (1867–1944).
With the usual notation, suppose that we have computed the approximations
y1, y2, y3, : : : , yn to the actual values y.x1/, y.x2/, y.x3/, : : : , y.xn/ and now want
to compute ynC1  y.xnC1/. Then

2.6 The Runge–Kutta Method
127
k4 D f .xnC1; yn C hk3/
(5d)

This is the Euler method slope at xnC1, using the improved slope k3 at the
midpoint to step to xnC1.
When these substitutions are made in (4), the result is the iterative formula
ynC1 D yn C h
6 .k1 C 2k2 C 2k3 C k4/:
(6)
The use of this formula to compute the approximations y1, y2, y3, : : : successively
constitutes the Runge–Kutta method. Note that Eq. (6) takes the “Euler form”
ynC1 D yn C h  k
if we write
k D 1
6.k1 C 2k2 C 2k3 C k4/
(7)
for the approximate average slope on the interval Œxn; xnC1.
The Runge–Kutta method is a fourth-order method—it can be proved that the
cumulative error on a bounded interval Œa; b with a D x0 is of order h4. (Thus the
iteration in (6) is sometimes called the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method because
it is possible to develop Runge–Kutta methods of other orders.) That is,
jy.xn/  ynj 5 Ch4;
(8)
where the constant C depends on the function f .x; y/ and the interval Œa; b, but
does not depend on the step size h. The following example illustrates this high
accuracy in comparison with the lower-order accuracy of our previous numerical
methods.
Example 1
We ﬁrst apply the Runge–Kutta method to the illustrative initial value problem
dy
dx D x C y;
y.0/ D 1
(9)
that we considered in Fig. 2.4.8 of Section 2.4 and again in Example 2 of Section 2.5. The
exact solution of this problem is y.x/ D 2ex  x  1. To make a point we use h D 0:5, a
larger step size than in any previous example, so only two steps are required to go from x D 0
to x D 1.
In the ﬁrst step we use the formulas in (5) and (6) to calculate
k1 D 0 C 1 D 1;
k2 D .0 C 0:25/ C .1 C .0:25/  .1// D 1:5;
k3 D .0 C 0:25/ C .1 C .0:25/  .1:5// D 1:625;
k4 D .0:5/ C .1 C .0:5/  .1:625// D 2:3125;
and then
y1 D 1 C 0:5
6 Œ1 C 2  .1:5/ C 2  .1:625/ C 2:3125  1:7969:
Similarly, the second step yields y2  3:4347.
Figure 2.6.1 presents these results together with the results (from Fig. 2.5.4) of apply-
ing the improved Euler method with step size h D 0:1. We see that even with the larger step
size, the Runge–Kutta method gives (for this problem) four to ﬁve times the accuracy (in
terms of relative percentage errors) of the improved Euler method.

Runge–Kutta and improved Euler results for the initial value problem
dy=dx D x C y, y.0/ D 1.
It is customary to measure the computational labor involved in solving
dy=dx D f .x; y/ numerically by counting the number of evaluations of the function
f .x; y/ that are required. In Example 1, the Runge–Kutta method required eight
evaluations of f .x; y/ D x C y (four at each step), whereas the improved Euler
method required 20 such evaluations (two for each of 10 steps). Thus the Runge–
Kutta method gave over four times the accuracy with only 40% of the labor.
Computer programs implementing the Runge–Kutta method are listed in the
project material for this section. Figure 2.6.2 shows the results obtained by apply-
ing the improved Euler and Runge–Kutta methods to the problem dy=dx D x C y,
y.0/ D 1 with the same step size h D 0:1. The relative error in the improved Euler
value at x D 1 is about 0:24%, but for the Runge–Kutta value it is 0:00012%. In this
comparison the Runge–Kutta method is about 2000 times as accurate, but requires
only twice as many function evaluations, as the improved Euler method.

Runge–Kutta and improved Euler results for the initial value problem
dy=dx D x C y, y.0/ D 1, with the same step size h D 0:1.
The error bound
jy.xn/  ynj 5 Ch4
(8)
for the Runge–Kutta method results in a rapid decrease in the magnitude of errors
when the step size h is reduced (except for the possibility that very small step sizes
may result in unacceptable roundoff errors). It follows from the inequality in (8) that
(on a ﬁxed bounded interval) halving the step size decreases the absolute error by
a factor of
 1

the step size until the computed results “stabilize” is particularly effective with the
Runge–Kutta method.

obtained using step sizes h D 0:002, h D 0:001, and h D 0:0005. Our ﬁnal approximate result
is y.0:95/  50:4723. The actual value of the solution at x D 0:95 is y.0:95/  50:471867.
Our slight overestimate results mainly from the fact that the four-place initial value in (12)
is (in effect) the result of rounding up the actual value y.0:9/  14:304864; such errors are
magniﬁed considerably as we approach the vertical asymptote.
Example 3
A skydiver with a mass of 60 kg jumps from a helicopter hovering at an initial altitude of
5 kilometers. Assume that she falls vertically with initial velocity zero and experiences an
upward force FR of air resistance given in terms of her velocity v (in meters per second) by
FR D .0:0096/.100v C 10v2 C v3/
(in newtons, and with the coordinate axis directed downward so that v > 0 during her descent
to the ground). If she does not open her parachute, what will be her terminal velocity? How
fast will she be falling after 5 s have elapsed? After 10 s? After 20 s?
Solution
Newton’s law F D ma gives

dt D mg  FRI
that is,
60dv
dt D .60/.9:8/  .0:0096/.100v C 10v2 C v3/

because m D 60 and g D 9:8. Thus the velocity function v.t/ satisﬁes the initial value problem
dv
dt D f .v/;
v.0/ D 0;
(14)
where
f .v/ D 9:8  .0:00016/.100v C 10v2 C v3/:
(15)
The skydiver reaches her terminal velocity when the forces of gravity and air resistance
balance, so f .v/ D 0. We can therefore calculate her terminal velocity immediately by solving
the equation
f .v/ D 9:8  .0:00016/.100v C 10v2 C v3/ D 0:
(16)
Figure 2.6.7 shows the graph of the function f .v/ and exhibits the single real solution v 
35:5780 (found graphically or by using a calculator or computer Solve procedure). Thus the
skydiver’s terminal speed is approximately 35:578 m=s, about 128 km=h (almost 80 mi=h).
Figure 2.6.8 shows the results of Runge–Kutta approximations to the solution of the
initial value problem in (14); the step sizes h D 0:2 and h D 0:1 yield the same results (to
three decimal places). Observe that the terminal velocity is effectively attained in only 15 s.
But the skydiver’s velocity is 91:85% of her terminal velocity after only 5 s, and 99:78% after
10 s.

Runge–Kutta attempts to solve numerically the initial value problem in Eq. (17).
The ﬁnal example of this section contains a warning: For certain types of
initial value problems, the numerical methods we have discussed are not nearly so
successful as in the previous examples.
Example 4
Consider the seemingly innocuous initial value problem
dy
dx D 5y  6ex;
y.0/ D 1
(17)
whose exact solution is y.x/ D ex. The table in Fig. 2.6.9 shows the results obtained by
applying the Runge–Kutta method on the interval Œ0; 4 with step sizes h D 0:2, h D 0:1, and
h D 0:05. Obviously these attempts are spectacularly unsuccessful. Although y.x/ D ex ! 0
as x ! C1, it appears that our numerical approximations are headed toward 1 rather than
zero.
The explanation lies in the fact that the general solution of the equation dy=dx D 5y 
6ex is
y.x/ D ex C Ce5x:
(18)
The particular solution of (17) satisfying the initial condition y.0/ D 1 is obtained with C D 0.
But any departure, however small, from the exact solution y.x/ D ex—even if due only to
roundoff error—introduces [in effect] a nonzero value of C in Eq. (18). And as indicated in
Fig. 2.6.10, all solution curves of the form in (18) with C ¤ 0 diverge rapidly away from the
one with C D 0, even if their initial values are close to 1.

Difﬁculties of the sort illustrated by Example 4 sometimes are unavoidable,
but one can at least hope to recognize such a problem when it appears. Approxi-
mate values whose order of magnitude varies with changing step size are a common
indicator of such instability. These difﬁculties are discussed in numerical analysis
textbooks and are the subject of current research in the ﬁeld.
2.6 Problems
A hand-held calculator will sufﬁce for Problems 1 through 10,
where an initial value problem and its exact solution are given.
Apply the Runge–Kutta method to approximate this solution on
the interval Œ0; 0:5 with step size h D 0:25. Construct a table

solution on the given interval, ﬁrst with step size h D 0:2, then
with step size h D 0:1. Make a table showing the approximate

Velocity-Acceleration Problems
In Problems 29 and 30, the linear acceleration a D dv=dt of a
moving particle is given by a formula dv=dt D f .t; v/, where
the velocity v D dy=dt is the derivative of the function y D y.t/
giving the position of the particle at time t. Suppose that the
velocity v.t/ is approximated using the Runge–Kutta method
to solve numerically the initial value problem
dv
dt D f .t; v/;
v.0/ D v0:
(19)
That is, starting with t0 D 0 and v0, the formulas in Eqs. (5)
and (6) are applied—with t and v in place of x and y—to
calculate the successive approximate velocity values v1, v2,
v3, : : : , vm at the successive times t1, t2, t3, : : : , tm (with
tnC1 D tn C h). Now suppose that we also want to approx-
imate the distance y.t/ traveled by the particle. We can do this
by beginning with the initial position y.0/ D y0 and calculat-
ing
ynC1 D yn C vnh C 1
2anh2
(20)
(n D 1, 2, 3, : : : ), where an D f .tn; vn/  v0.tn/ is the par-
ticle’s approximate acceleration at time tn. The formula in
(20) would give the correct increment (from yn to ynC1) if
the acceleration an remained constant during the time interval
Œtn; tnC1.
Thus, once a table of approximate velocities has been
calculated, Eq. (20) provides a simple way to calculate a table
of corresponding successive positions. This process is illus-
trated in the project for this section, by beginning with the ve-
locity data in Fig. 2.6.8 (Example 3) and proceeding to follow
the skydiver’s position during her descent to the ground.
29. Consider again the crossbow bolt of Example 2 in Sec-
tion 2.3, shot straight upward from the ground with an ini-
tial velocity of 49 m=s. Because of linear air resistance,

(c) If the exact solution were unavailable, explain how

30. Now consider again the crossbow bolt of Example 3 in
Section 2.3. It still is shot straight upward from the ground
with an initial velocity of 49 m=s, but because of air resis-

(a) and n D 400 subintervals for two-place accuracy in
part (b)). According to the results of Problems 17 and 18

2.6 Application Runge–Kutta Implementation

Runge–Kutta method to approximate the solution of the initial value problem
dy

y.0/ D 1
considered in Example 1 of this section. The comments provided in the ﬁnal column
should make these programs intelligible even if you have little familiarity with the
BASIC and TI programming languages.
To apply the Runge–Kutta method to a different equation dy=dx D f .x; y/,
one need only change the initial line of the program, in which the function f is
deﬁned. To increase the number of steps (and thereby decrease the step size), one
need only change the value of n speciﬁed in the second line of the program.
Figure 2.6.12 exhibits a MATLAB implementation of the Runge–Kutta
method. Suppose that the function f describing the differential equation y0 D
f .x; y/ has been deﬁned. Then the rk function takes as input the initial value x,
the initial value y, the ﬁnal value x1 of x, and the desired number n of subintervals.
As output it produces the resulting column vectors X and Y of x- and y-values. For
instance, the MATLAB command
[X, Y] = rk(0, 1, 1, 10)
then generates the ﬁrst and third columns of data shown in the table in Fig. 2.6.2.
You should begin this project by implementing the Runge–Kutta method with
your own calculator or computer system. Test your program by applying it ﬁrst to
the initial value problem in Example 1, then to some of the problems for this section.

The results of these calculations are shown in
the table in Fig. 2.6.13. It appears that the skydiver falls 629:866 m during her
ﬁrst 20 s of descent, and then free falls the remaining 4370:134 meters to the
ground at her terminal speed of 35:578 m=s. Hence her total time of descent is
20 C .4370:134=35:578/  142:833 s, or about 2 min 23 s.
For an individual problem to solve after implementing these methods using

Linear Equations
of Higher Order
3.1 Introduction: Second-Order Linear Equations
I
n Chapters 1 and 2 we investigated ﬁrst-order differential equations. We now turn
to equations of higher order n = 2, beginning in this chapter with equations that
are linear. The general theory of linear differential equations parallels the second-
order case (n D 2), which we outline in this initial section.
Recall that a second-order differential equation in the (unknown) function
y.x/ is one of the form
G.x; y; y0; y00/ D 0:
(1)
This differential equation is said to be linear provided that G is linear in the depen-
dent variable y and its derivatives y0 and y00. Thus a linear second-order equation
takes (or can be written in) the form
A.x/y00 C B.x/y0 C C.x/y D F.x/:
(2)
Unless otherwise noted, we will always assume that the (known) coefﬁcient func-
tions A.x/, B.x/, C.x/, and F.x/ are continuous on some open interval I (perhaps
unbounded) on which we wish to solve this differential equation, but we do not
require that they be linear functions of x. Thus the differential equation
exy00 C .cos x/y0 C .1 C px /y D tan1 x
is linear because the dependent variable y and its derivatives y0 and y00 appear lin-
early. By contrast, the equations
y00 D yy0
and
y00 C 3.y0/2 C 4y3 D 0
are not linear because products and powers of y or its derivatives appear.
136

3.1 Introduction: Second-Order Linear Equations
137
If the function F.x/ on the right-hand side of Eq. (2) vanishes identically on
I, then we call Eq. (2) a homogeneous linear equation; otherwise, it is nonhomo-
geneous. For example, the second-order equation
x2y00 C 2xy0 C 3y D cos x
is nonhomogeneous; its associated homogeneous equation is
x2y00 C 2xy0 C 3y D 0:
In general, the homogeneous linear equation associated with Eq. (2) is
A.x/y00 C B.x/y0 C C.x/y D 0:
(3)
In case the differential equation in (2) models a physical system, the nonhomoge-
neous term F.x/ frequently corresponds to some external inﬂuence on the system.
Remark Note that the meaning of the term “homogeneous” for a second-order linear differ-
ential equation is quite different from its meaning for a ﬁrst-order differential equation (as in
Section 1.6). Of course, it is not unusual—either in mathematics or in the English language
more generally—for the same word to have different meanings in different contexts.
A Typical Application
Linear differential equations frequently appear as mathematical models of mechan-

ical systems and electrical circuits. For example, suppose that a mass m is attached
both to a spring that exerts on it a force FS and to a dashpot (shock absorber) that
exerts a force FR on the mass (Fig. 3.1.1). Assume that the restoring force FS of
the spring is proportional to the displacement x of the mass from its equilibrium
position and acts opposite to the direction of displacement. Then
FS D kx
(with k > 0)
so FS < 0 if x > 0 (spring stretched) while FS > 0 if x < 0 (spring compressed).
We assume that the dashpot force FR is proportional to the velocity v D dx=dt of
the mass and acts opposite to the direction of motion. Then

(with c > 0);
so FR < 0 if v > 0 (motion to the right) while FR > 0 if v < 0 (motion to the left).
If FR and FS are the only forces acting on the mass m and its resulting accel-
eration is a D dv=dt, then Newton’s law F D ma gives

that is,
md 2x

(5)
Thus we have a differential equation satisﬁed by the position function x.t/ of the
mass m. This homogeneous second-order linear equation governs the free vibrations
of the mass; we will return to this problem in detail in Section 3.4.
If, in addition to FS and FR, the mass m is acted on by an external force
F.t/—which must then be added to the right-hand side in Eq. (4)—the resulting
equation is
md 2x
dt2 C c dx
dt C kx D F.t/:
(6)
This nonhomogeneous linear differential equation governs the forced vibrations of
the mass under the inﬂuence of the external force F.t/.

Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
Homogeneous Second-Order Linear Equations
Consider the general second-order linear equation
A.x/y00 C B.x/y0 C C.x/y D F.x/;
(7)
where the coefﬁcient functions A, B, C, and F are continuous on the open interval
I. Here we assume in addition that A.x/ ¤ 0 at each point of I, so we can divide
each term in Eq. (7) by A.x/ and write it in the form
y00 C p.x/y0 C q.x/y D f .x/:
(8)
We will discuss ﬁrst the associated homogeneous equation
y00 C p.x/y0 C q.x/y D 0:
(9)
A particularly useful property of this homogeneous linear equation is the fact that the
sum of any two solutions of Eq. (9) is again a solution, as is any constant multiple
of a solution. This is the central idea of the following theorem.
THEOREM 1
Principle of Superposition for Homogeneous
Equations
Let y1 and y2 be two solutions of the homogeneous linear equation in (9) on the
interval I. If c1 and c2 are constants, then the linear combination
y D c1y1 C c2y2
(10)
is also a solution of Eq. (9) on I.
Proof:
The conclusion follows almost immediately from the linearity of the
operation of differentiation, which gives
y0 D c1y0
1 C c2y0
2
and
y00 D c1y00
1 C c2y00
2:
Then

1 C qy1/ C c2.y00
2 C py0
2 C qy2/
D c1  0 C c2  0 D 0
because y1 and y2 are solutions. Thus y D c1y1 C c2y2 is also a solution.
Example 1
We can see by inspection that
y1.x/ D cos x
and
y2.x/ D sin x
are two solutions of the equation
y00 C y D 0:
Theorem 1 tells us that any linear combination of these solutions, such as
y.x/ D 3y1.x/  2y2.x/ D 3 cos x  2 sin x;

3.1 Introduction: Second-Order Linear Equations
139
is also a solution. We will see later that, conversely, every solution of y00 C y D 0 is a
linear combination of these two particular solutions y1 and y2. Thus a general solution of
y00 C y D 0 is given by
y.x/ D c1 cos x C c2 sin x:
It is important to understand that this single formula for the general solution encompasses
a “twofold inﬁnity” of particular solutions, because the two coefﬁcients c1 and c2 can be
selected independently. Figures 3.1.3 through 3.1.5 illustrate some of the possibilities, with
either c1 or c2 set equal to zero, or with both nonzero.

Earlier in this section we gave the linear equation mx00 C cx0 C kx D F.t/ as
a mathematical model of the motion of the mass shown in Fig. 3.1.1. Physical con-
siderations suggest that the motion of the mass should be determined by its initial
position and initial velocity. Hence, given any preassigned values of x.0/ and x0.0/,
Eq. (6) ought to have a unique solution satisfying these initial conditions. More
generally, in order to be a “good” mathematical model of a deterministic physical
situation, a differential equation must have unique solutions satisfying any appro-
priate initial conditions. The following existence and uniqueness theorem (proved
in the Appendix) gives us this assurance for the general second-order equation.
THEOREM 2
Existence and Uniqueness for Linear Equations
Suppose that the functions p, q, and f are continuous on the open interval I
containing the point a. Then, given any two numbers b0 and b1, the equation
y00 C p.x/y0 C q.x/y D f .x/
(8)
has a unique (that is, one and only one) solution on the entire interval I that
satisﬁes the initial conditions
y.a/ D b0;
y0.a/ D b1:
(11)
Remark 1
Equation (8) and the conditions in (11) constitute a second-order linear initial
value problem. Theorem 2 tells us that any such initial value problem has a unique solution
on the whole interval I where the coefﬁcient functions in (8) are continuous. Recall from
Section 1.3 that a nonlinear differential equation generally has a unique solution on only a
smaller interval.
Remark 2
Whereas a ﬁrst-order differential equation dy=dx D F.x; y/ generally admits
only a single solution curve y D y.x/ passing through a given initial point .a; b/, Theorem

140
Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
2 implies that the second-order equation in (8) has inﬁnitely many solution curves pass-
ing through the point .a; b0/—namely, one for each (real number) value of the initial slope
y0.a/ D b1. That is, instead of there being only one line through .a; b0/ tangent to a solu-
tion curve, every nonvertical straight line through .a; b0/ is tangent to some solution curve of
Eq. (8). Figure 3.1.6 shows a number of solution curves of the equation y00 C 3y0 C 2y D 0
all having the same initial value y.0/ D 1, while Fig. 3.1.7 shows a number of solution curves
all having the same initial slope y0.0/ D 1. The application at the end of this section suggests
how to construct such families of solution curves for a given homogeneous second-order
linear differential equation.

Example 1
We saw in the ﬁrst part of Example 1 that y.x/ D 3 cos x  2 sin x is a solution (on the entire
real line) of y00 C y D 0. It has the initial values y.0/ D 3, y0.0/ D 2. Theorem 2 tells us
that this is the only solution with these initial values. More generally, the solution
y.x/ D b0 cos x C b1 sin x
satisﬁes the arbitrary initial conditions y.0/ D b0, y0.0/ D b1; this illustrates the existence of
such a solution, also as guaranteed by Theorem 2.
Example 1 suggests how, given a homogeneous second-order linear equation,
we might actually ﬁnd the solution y.x/ whose existence is assured by Theorem 2.
First, we ﬁnd two “essentially different” solutions y1 and y2; second, we attempt to
impose on the general solution
y D c1y1 C c2y2
(12)
the initial conditions y.a/ D b0, y0.a/ D b1. That is, we attempt to solve the simul-
taneous equations
c1y1.a/ C c2y2.a/ D b0;
c1y0
1.a/ C c2y0
2.a/ D b1
(13)
for the coefﬁcients c1 and c2.
Example 2
Verify that the functions
y1.x/ D ex
and
y2.x/ D xex
are solutions of the differential equation
y00  2y0 C y D 0;
and then ﬁnd a solution satisfying the initial conditions y.0/ D 3, y0.0/ D 1.

y.x/ D 3ex  2xex:
Figure 3.1.8 shows several additional solutions of y00  2y0 C y D 0, all having the same
initial value y.0/ D 3.
In order for the procedure of Example 2 to succeed, the two solutions y1 and
y2 must have the elusive property that the equations in (13) can always be solved for
c1 and c2, no matter what the initial conditions b0 and b1 might be. The following
deﬁnition tells precisely how different the two functions y1 and y2 must be.
DEFINITION
Linear Independence of Two Functions
Two functions deﬁned on an open interval I are said to be linearly independent
on I provided that neither is a constant multiple of the other.
Two functions are said to be linearly dependent on an open interval provided
that they are not linearly independent there; that is, one of them is a constant multi-
ple of the other. We can always determine whether two given functions f and g are
linearly dependent on an interval I by noting at a glance whether either of the two
quotients f=g or g=f is a constant-valued function on I.
Example 3
Thus it is clear that the following pairs of functions are linearly independent on the entire real
line:
sin x
and
cos xI
ex
and
e2xI
ex
and
xexI
x C 1
and
x2I
x
and
jxj:
That is, neither sin x=cos x D tan x nor cos x=sin x D cot x is a constant-valued function;
neither ex=e2x D e3x nor e2x=ex is a constant-valued function; and so forth. But the
identically zero function f .x/  0 and any other function g are linearly dependent on every
interval, because 0  g.x/ D 0 D f .x/. Also, the functions
f .x/ D sin 2x
and
g.x/ D sin x cos x
are linearly dependent on any interval because f .x/ D 2g.x/ is the familiar trigonometric
identity sin 2x D 2 sin x cos x.
General Solutions
But does the homogeneous equation y00 C py0 C qy D 0 always have two linearly
independent solutions? Theorem 2 says yes! We need only choose y1 and y2 so that
y1.a/ D 1; y0
1.a/ D 0
and
y2.a/ D 0; y0
2.a/ D 1:

142
Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
It is then impossible that either y1 D ky2 or y2 D ky1 because k  0 ¤ 1 for any
constant k. Theorem 2 tells us that two such linearly independent solutions exist;
actually ﬁnding them is a crucial matter that we will discuss brieﬂy at the end of
this section, and in greater detail beginning in Section 3.3.
We want to show, ﬁnally, that given any two linearly independent solutions y1
and y2 of the homogeneous equation
y00.x/ C p.x/y0.x/ C q.x/y.x/ D 0;
(9)
every solution y of Eq. (9) can be expressed as a linear combination
y D c1y1 C c2y2
(12)
of y1 and y2. This means that the function in (12) is a general solution of Eq. (9)—it
provides all possible solutions of the differential equation.
As suggested by the equations in (13), the determination of the constants c1
and c2 in (12) depends on a certain 2  2 determinant of values of y1, y2, and
their derivatives. Given two functions f and g, the Wronskian of f and g is the
determinant
W D
ˇˇˇˇˇ
f
g
f 0
g0
ˇˇˇˇˇ D fg0  f 0g:
We write either W.f; g/ or W.x/, depending on whether we wish to emphasize the
two functions or the point x at which the Wronskian is to be evaluated. For example,
W.cos x; sin x/ D
ˇˇˇˇ
cos x

 sin x
cos x
ˇˇˇˇ D cos2 x C sin2 x D 1
and
W.ex; xex/ D
ˇˇˇˇ
ex
xex
ex
ex C xex
ˇˇˇˇ D e2x:
These are examples of linearly independent pairs of solutions of differential equa-
tions (see Examples 1 and 2). Note that in both cases the Wronskian is everywhere
nonzero.
On the other hand, if the functions f and g are linearly dependent, with f D
kg (for example), then
W.f; g/ D
ˇˇˇˇ
kg
g
kg0
g0
ˇˇˇˇ D kgg0  kg0g  0:
Thus the Wronskian of two linearly dependent functions is identically zero. In
Section 3.2 we will prove that, if the two functions y1 and y2 are solutions of a
homogeneous second-order linear equation, then the strong converse stated in part
(b) of Theorem 3 holds.
THEOREM 3
Wronskians of Solutions
Suppose that y1 and y2 are two solutions of the homogeneous second-order linear
equation (Eq. (9))
y00 C p.x/y0 C q.x/y D 0
on an open interval I on which p and q are continuous.
(a) If y1 and y2 are linearly dependent, then W.y1; y2/  0 on I.
(b) If y1 and y2 are linearly independent, then W.y1; y2/ 6D 0 at each point of I.

3.1 Introduction: Second-Order Linear Equations
143
Thus, given two solutions of Eq. (9), there are just two possibilities: The
Wronskian W is identically zero if the solutions are linearly dependent; the Wron-
skian is never zero if the solutions are linearly independent. The latter fact is what
we need to show that y D c1y1 C c2y2 is the general solution of Eq. (9) if y1 and y2
are linearly independent solutions.
THEOREM 4
General Solutions of Homogeneous Equations
Let y1 and y2 be two linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous equation
(Eq. (9))
y00 C p.x/y0 C q.x/y D 0
with p and q continuous on the open interval I. If Y is any solution whatsoever
of Eq. (9) on I, then there exist numbers c1 and c2 such that
Y.x/ D c1y1.x/ C c2y2.x/
for all x in I.
In essence, Theorem 4 tells us that when we have found two linearly inde-
pendent solutions of the second-order homogeneous equation in (9), then we have
found all of its solutions. We therefore call the linear combination Y D c1y1 C c2y2
a general solution of the differential equation.
Proof of Theorem 4: Choose a point a of I, and consider the simultaneous
equations
c1y1.a/ C c2y2.a/ D Y.a/;
c1y0
1.a/ C c2y0
2.a/ D Y 0.a/:
(14)
The determinant of the coefﬁcients in this system of linear equations in the un-
knowns c1 and c2 is simply the Wronskian W.y1; y2/ evaluated at x D a. By The-
orem 3, this determinant is nonzero, so by elementary algebra it follows that the
equations in (14) can be solved for c1 and c2. With these values of c1 and c2, we
deﬁne the solution
G.x/ D c1y1.x/ C c2y2.x/
of Eq. (9); then
G.a/ D c1y1.a/ C c2y2.a/ D Y.a/
and
G0.a/ D c1y0
1.a/ C c2y0
2.a/ D Y 0.a/:
Thus the two solutions Y and G have the same initial values at a; likewise, so do Y 0
and G0. By the uniqueness of a solution determined by such initial values (Theorem
2), it follows that Y and G agree on I. Thus we see that
Y.x/  G.x/ D c1y1.x/ C c2y2.x/;
as desired.
Example 4
If y1.x/ D e2x and y2.x/ D e2x, then
y00
1 D .2/.2/e2x D 4e2x D 4y1
and
y00
2 D .2/.2/e2x D 4e2x D 4y2:
Therefore, y1 and y2 are linearly independent solutions of
y00  4y D 0:
(15)

144
Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
But y3.x/ D cosh 2x and y4.x/ D sinh 2x are also solutions of Eq. (15), because
d 2
dx2 .cosh 2x/ D d
dx .2 sinh 2x/ D 4 cosh 2x
and, similarly, .sinh 2x/00 D 4 sinh 2x. It therefore follows from Theorem 4 that the functions
cosh 2x and sinh 2x can be expressed as linear combinations of y1.x/ D e2x and y2.x/ D
e2x. Of course, this is no surprise, because
cosh 2x D 1
2e2x C 1
2e2x
and
sinh 2x D 1
2e2x  1
2e2x
by the deﬁnitions of the hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine.
Remark Because e2x, e2x and cosh x, sinh x are two different pairs of linearly indepen-
dent solutions of the equation y00  4y D 0 in (15), Theorem 4 implies that every particular
solution Y.x/ of this equation can be written both in the form
Y.x/ D c1e2x C c2e2x
and in the form
Y.x/ D a cosh 2x C b sinh 2x:
Thus these two different linear combinations (with arbitrary constant coefﬁcients) provide
two different descriptions of the set of all solutions of the same differential equation y00 4y D
0. Hence each of these two linear combinations is a general solution of the equation. Indeed,
this is why it is accurate to refer to a speciﬁc such linear combination as “a general solution”
rather than as “the general solution.”
Linear Second-Order Equations with Constant Coefﬁcients
As an illustration of the general theory introduced in this section, we discuss the
homogeneous second-order linear differential equation
ay00 C by0 C cy D 0
(16)
with constant coefﬁcients a, b, and c. We ﬁrst look for a single solution of Eq. (16)
and begin with the observation that
.erx/0 D rerx
and
.erx/00 D r2erx;
(17)
so any derivative of erx is a constant multiple of erx. Hence, if we substituted
y D erx in Eq. (16), then each term would be a constant multiple of erx, with the
constant coefﬁcients dependent on r and the coefﬁcients a, b, and c. This suggests
that we try to ﬁnd a value of r so that these multiples of erx will have sum zero. If
we succeed, then y D erx will be a solution of Eq. (16).
For example, if we substitute y D erx in the equation
y00  5y0 C 6y D 0;
we obtain
r2erx  5rerx C 6erx D 0:
Thus
.r2  5r C 6/erx D 0I
.r  2/.r  3/erx D 0:
Hence y D erx will be a solution if either r D 2 or r D 3. So, in searching for a
single solution, we actually have found two solutions: y1.x/ D e2x and y2.x/ D e3x.

3.1 Introduction: Second-Order Linear Equations
145
To carry out this procedure in the general case, we substitute y D erx in
Eq. (16). With the aid of the equations in (17), we ﬁnd the result to be
ar2erx C brerx C cerx D 0:
Because erx is never zero, we conclude that y.x/ D erx will satisfy the differential
equation in (16) precisely when r is a root of the algebraic equation
ar2 C br C c D 0:
(18)
This quadratic equation is called the characteristic equation of the homogeneous
linear differential equation
ay00 C by0 C cy D 0:
(16)
If Eq. (18) has two distinct (unequal) roots r1 and r2, then the corresponding solu-
tions y1.x/ D er1x and y2.x/ D er2x of (16) are linearly independent. (Why?) This
gives the following result.
THEOREM 5
Distinct Real Roots
If the roots r1 and r2 of the characteristic equation in (18) are real and distinct,
then
y.x/ D c1er1x C c2er2x
(19)
is a general solution of Eq. (16).
Example 5
Find the general solution of
2y00  7y0 C 3y D 0:
Solution
We can solve the characteristic equation
2r2  7r C 3 D 0
by factoring:
.2r  1/.r  3/ D 0:
The roots r1 D 1
2 and r2 D 3 are real and distinct, so Theorem 5 yields the general solution
y.x/ D c1ex=2 C c2e3x:
Example 6
The differential equation y00 C 2y0 D 0 has characteristic equation
r2 C 2r D r.r C 2/ D 0
with distinct real roots r1 D 0 and r2 D 2. Because e0x  1, we get the general solution
y.x/ D c1 C c2e2x:
Figure 3.1.9 shows several different solution curves with c1 D 1, all appearing to approach
the solution curve y.x/  1 (with c2 D 0) as x ! C1.
Remark Note that Theorem 5 changes a problem involving a differential equation into one
involving only the solution of an algebraic equation.

only the single solution y1.x/ D er1x of Eq. (16). The problem in this case is to
produce the “missing” second solution of the differential equation.
A double root r D r1 will occur precisely when the characteristic equation is
a constant multiple of the equation
.r  r1/2 D r2  2r1r C r2
1 D 0:
Any differential equation with this characteristic equation is equivalent to
y00  2r1y0 C r2
1y D 0:
(20)
But it is easy to verify by direct substitution that y D xer1x is a second solution of
Eq. (20). It is clear (but you should verify) that
y1.x/ D er1x
and
y2.x/ D xer1x
are linearly independent functions, so the general solution of the differential equa-
tion in (20) is
y.x/ D c1er1x C c2xer1x:
THEOREM 6
Repeated Roots
If the characteristic equation in (18) has equal (necessarily real) roots r1 D r2,
then
y.x/ D .c1 C c2x/er1x
(21)
is a general solution of Eq. (16).
Example 7
To solve the initial value problem
y00 C 2y0 C y D 0I
y.0/ D 5;
y0.0/ D 3;
we note ﬁrst that the characteristic equation
r2 C 2r C 1 D .r C 1/2 D 0
has equal roots r1 D r2 D 1. Hence the general solution provided by Theorem 6 is
y.x/ D c1ex C c2xex:
Differentiation yields
y0.x/ D c1ex C c2ex  c2xex;
so the initial conditions yield the equations

y0.0/ D c1 C c2 D 3,
which imply that c1 D 5 and c2 D 2. Thus the desired particular solution of the initial value
problem is

This particular solution, together with several others of the form y.x/ D c1ex C 2xex, is

3.2 General Solutions of Linear Equations
We now show that our discussion in Section 3.1 of second-order linear equations
generalizes in a very natural way to the general nth-order linear differential equa-
tion of the form
P0.x/y.n/ C P1.x/y.n1/ C    C Pn1.x/y0 C Pn.x/y D F.x/:
(1)
Unless otherwise noted, we will always assume that the coefﬁcient functions Pi.x/
and F.x/ are continuous on some open interval I (perhaps unbounded) where we

150
Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
wish to solve the equation. Under the additional assumption that P0.x/ ¤ 0 at each
point of I, we can divide each term in Eq. (1) by P0.x/ to obtain an equation with
leading coefﬁcient 1, of the form
y.n/ C p1.x/y.n1/ C    C pn1.x/y0 C pn.x/y D f .x/:
(2)
The homogeneous linear equation associated with Eq. (2) is
y.n/ C p1.x/y.n1/ C    C pn1.x/y0 C pn.x/y D 0:
(3)
Just as in the second-order case, a homogeneous nth-order linear differential equa-
tion has the valuable property that any superposition, or linear combination, of so-
lutions of the equation is again a solution. The proof of the following theorem is
essentially the same—a routine veriﬁcation—as that of Theorem 1 of Section 3.1.
THEOREM 1
Principle of Superposition for Homogeneous
Equations
Let y1, y2, : : : ; yn be n solutions of the homogeneous linear equation in (3) on
the interval I. If c1, c2, : : : ; cn are constants, then the linear combination
y D c1y1 C c2y2 C    C cnyn
(4)
is also a solution of Eq. (3) on I.
Example 1
It is easy to verify that the three functions
y1.x/ D e3x;
y2.x/ D cos 2x;
and
y3.x/ D sin 2x
are all solutions of the homogeneous third-order equation
y.3/ C 3y00 C 4y0 C 12y D 0
on the entire real line. Theorem 1 tells us that any linear combination of these solutions, such
as
y.x/ D 3y1.x/ C 3y2.x/  2y3.x/ D 3e3x C 3 cos 2x  2 sin 2x;
is also a solution on the entire real line. We will see that, conversely, every solution of the
differential equation of this example is a linear combination of the three particular solutions
y1, y2, and y3. Thus a general solution is given by
y.x/ D c1e3x C c2 cos 2x C c3 sin 2x:
Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions
We saw in Section 3.1 that a particular solution of a second-order linear differential
equation is determined by two initial conditions. Similarly, a particular solution of
an nth-order linear differential equation is determined by n initial conditions. The
following theorem, proved in the Appendix, is the natural generalization of Theorem
2 of Section 3.1.

3.2 General Solutions of Linear Equations
151
THEOREM 2
Existence and Uniqueness for Linear Equations
Suppose that the functions p1, p2, : : : ; pn, and f are continuous on the open
interval I containing the point a. Then, given n numbers b0, b1, : : : ; bn1, the
nth-order linear equation (Eq. (2))
y.n/ C p1.x/y.n1/ C    C pn1.x/y0 C pn.x/y D f .x/
has a unique (that is, one and only one) solution on the entire interval I that
satisﬁes the n initial conditions
y.a/ D b0;
y0.a/ D b1;
: : : ;
y.n1/.a/ D bn1:
(5)
Equation (2) and the conditions in (5) constitute an nth-order initial value
problem. Theorem 2 tells us that any such initial value problem has a unique so-
lution on the whole interval I where the coefﬁcient functions in (2) are continuous.
It tells us nothing, however, about how to ﬁnd this solution. In Section 3.3 we will
see how to construct explicit solutions of initial value problems in the constant-
coefﬁcient case that occurs often in applications.

on the entire real line. This particular solution has initial values y.0/ D 0, y0.0/ D 5, and
y00.0/ D 39, and Theorem 2 implies that there is no other solution with these same initial
values. Note that its graph (in Fig. 3.2.1) looks periodic on the right. Indeed, because of the
negative exponent, we see that y.x/  3 cos 2x  2 sin 2x for large positive x.
Remark Because its general solution involves the three arbitrary constants c1, c2, and c3,
the third-order equation in Example 1 has a “threefold inﬁnity” of solutions, including three
families of especially simple solutions:

y.x/ D c1e3x (obtained from the general solution with c2 D c3 D 0),

y.x/ D c2 cos 2x (with c1 D c3 D 0), and

y.x/ D c3 sin 2x (with c1 D c2 D 0).
Alternatively, Theorem 2 suggests a threefold inﬁnity of particular solutions corresponding
to independent choices of the three initial values y.0/ D b0, y0.0/ D b1, and y00.0/ D b2.
Figures 3.2.2 through 3.2.4 illustrate three corresponding families of solutions—for each of
which, two of these three initial values are zero.
Note that Theorem 2 implies that the trivial solution y.x/  0 is the only
solution of the homogeneous equation

are two different solutions of
x2y00  4xy0 C 6y D 0;
and that both satisfy the initial conditions y.0/ D y0.0/ D 0. Why does this not contradict
the uniqueness part of Theorem 2? It is because the leading coefﬁcient in this differential
equation vanishes at x D 0, so this equation cannot be written in the form of Eq. (3) with
coefﬁcient functions continuous on an open interval containing the point x D 0.
Linearly Independent Solutions
On the basis of our knowledge of general solutions of second-order linear equations,
we anticipate that a general solution of the homogeneous nth-order linear equation
y.n/ C p1.x/y.n1/ C    C pn1.x/y0 C pn.x/y D 0
(3)
will be a linear combination
y D c1y1 C c2y2 C    C cnyn;
(4)
where y1, y2, : : : ; yn are particular solutions of Eq. (3). But these n particular
solutions must be “sufﬁciently independent” that we can always choose the coef-
ﬁcients c1, c2, : : : ; cn in (4) to satisfy arbitrary initial conditions of the form in
(5). The question is this: What should be meant by independence of three or more
functions?
Recall that two functions f1 and f2 are linearly dependent if one is a constant
multiple of the other; that is, if either f1 D kf2 or f2 D kf1 for some constant k. If
we write these equations as
.1/f1 C .k/f2 D 0
or
.k/f1 C .1/f2 D 0;
we see that the linear dependence of f1 and f2 implies that there exist two constants
c1 and c2 not both zero such that
c1f1 C c2f2 D 0:
(6)
Conversely, if c1 and c2 are not both zero, then Eq. (6) certainly implies that f1 and
f2 are linearly dependent.

3.2 General Solutions of Linear Equations
153
In analogy with Eq. (6), we say that n functions f1, f2, : : : ; fn are linearly
dependent provided that some nontrivial linear combination
c1f1 C c2f2 C    C cnfn
of them vanishes identically; nontrivial means that not all of the coefﬁcients c1, c2,
: : : ; cn are zero (although some of them may be zero).
DEFINITION
Linear Dependence of Functions
The n functions f1, f2, : : : ; fn are said to be linearly dependent on the interval
I provided that there exist constants c1, c2, : : : ; cn not all zero such that
c1f1 C c2f2 C    C cnfn D 0
(7)
on I; that is,
c1f1.x/ C c2f2.x/ C    C cnfn.x/ D 0
for all x in I.
If not all the coefﬁcients in Eq. (7) are zero, then clearly we can solve for at least
one of the functions as a linear combination of the others, and conversely. Thus the
functions f1, f2, : : : ; fn are linearly dependent if and only if at least one of them is
a linear combination of the others.
Example 3
The functions
f1.x/ D sin 2x;
f2.x/ D sin x cos x;
and
f3.x/ D ex
are linearly dependent on the real line because
.1/f1 C .2/f2 C .0/f3 D 0
(by the familiar trigonometric identity sin 2x D 2 sin x cos x).
The n functions f1, f2, : : : ; fn are called linearly independent on the interval
I provided that they are not linearly dependent there. Equivalently, they are linearly
independent on I provided that the identity
c1f1 C c2f2 C    C cnfn D 0
(7)
holds on I only in the trivial case
c1 D c2 D    D cn D 0I
that is, no nontrivial linear combination of these functions vanishes on I. Put yet
another way, the functions f1, f2, : : : ; fn are linearly independent if no one of them
is a linear combination of the others. (Why?)
Sometimes one can show that n given functions are linearly dependent by
ﬁnding, as in Example 3, nontrivial values of the coefﬁcients so that Eq. (7) holds.
But in order to show that n given functions are linearly independent, we must prove
that nontrivial values of the coefﬁcients cannot be found, and this is seldom easy to
do in any direct or obvious manner.
Fortunately, in the case of n solutions of a homogeneous nth-order linear equa-
tion, there is a tool that makes the determination of their linear dependence or inde-
pendence a routine matter in many examples. This tool is the Wronskian determi-
nant, which we introduced (for the case n D 2) in Section 3.1. Suppose that the n

154

functions f1, f2, : : : ; fn are each n  1 times differentiable. Then their Wronskian

We write W.f1; f2; : : : ; fn/ or W.x/, depending on whether we wish to emphasize
the functions or the point x at which their Wronskian is to be evaluated. The Wron-
skian is named after the Polish mathematician J. M. H. Wronski (1778–1853).
We saw in Section 3.1 that the Wronskian of two linearly dependent functions
vanishes identically. More generally, the Wronskian of n linearly dependent func-
tions f1, f2, : : : ; fn is identically zero. To prove this, assume that Eq. (7) holds on
the interval I for some choice of the constants c1, c2, : : : ; cn not all zero. We then
differentiate this equation n  1 times in succession, obtaining the n equations

which hold for all x in I. We recall from linear algebra that a system of n lin-
ear homogeneous equations in n unknowns has a nontrivial solution if and only
if the determinant of coefﬁcients vanishes. In Eq. (9) the unknowns are the con-
stants c1, c2, : : : ; cn and the determinant of coefﬁcients is simply the Wronskian
W.f1; f2; : : : ; fn/ evaluated at the typical point x of I. Because we know that the
ci are not all zero, it follows that W.x/  0, as we wanted to prove.
Therefore, to show that the functions f1, f2, : : : ; fn are linearly independent
on the interval I, it sufﬁces to show that their Wronskian is nonzero at just one point
of I.

Thus W.x/ ¤ 0 for x > 0, so y1, y2, and y3 are linearly independent on the interval x > 0.

Provided that W.y1; y2; : : : ; yn/ ¤ 0, it turns out (Theorem 4) that we can

that satisfy any given initial conditions of the form in (5). Theorem 3 provides the
necessary nonvanishing of W in the case of linearly independent solutions.

THEOREM 3
Wronskians of Solutions
Suppose that y1, y2, : : : ; yn are n solutions of the homogeneous nth-order linear
equation
y.n/ C p1.x/y.n1/ C    C pn1.x/y0 C pn.x/y D 0
(3)
on an open interval I, where each pi is continuous. Let
W D W.y1; y2; : : : ; yn/:
(a) If y1, y2, : : : ; yn are linearly dependent, then W  0 on I.
(b) If y1, y2, : : : ; yn are linearly independent, then W ¤ 0 at each point of I.
Thus there are just two possibilities: Either W D 0 everywhere on I, or W ¤ 0
everywhere on I.
Proof:
We have already proven part (a). To prove part (b), it is sufﬁcient
to assume that W.a/ D 0 at some point of I, and show this implies that the solu-
tions y1, y2, : : : ; yn are linearly dependent. But W.a/ is simply the determinant of
coefﬁcients of the system of n homogeneous linear equations

in the n unknowns c1, c2, : : : ; cn. Because W.a/ D 0, the basic fact from linear
algebra quoted just after (9) implies that the equations in (12) have a nontrivial
solution. That is, the numbers c1, c2, : : : ; cn are not all zero.
We now use these values to deﬁne the particular solution
Y.x/ D c1y1.x/ C c2y2.x/ C    C cnyn.x/
(13)
of Eq. (3).
The equations in (12) then imply that Y satisﬁes the trivial initial
conditions
Y.a/ D Y 0.a/ D    D Y .n1/.a/ D 0:
Theorem 2 (uniqueness) therefore implies that Y.x/  0 on I. In view of (13)
and the fact that c1, c2, : : : ; cn are not all zero, this is the desired conclusion that
the solutions y1, y2, : : : ; yn are linearly dependent. This completes the proof of
Theorem 3.
General Solutions
We can now show that, given any ﬁxed set of n linearly independent solutions of
a homogeneous nth-order equation, every (other) solution of the equation can be
expressed as a linear combination of those n particular solutions. Using the fact
from Theorem 3 that the Wronskian of n linearly independent solutions is nonzero,
the proof of the following theorem is essentially the same as the proof of Theorem
4 of Section 3.1 (the case n D 2).

3.2 General Solutions of Linear Equations

THEOREM 4
General Solutions of Homogeneous Equations
Let y1, y2, : : : ; yn be n linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous equa-
tion
y.n/ C p1.x/y.n1/ C    C pn1.x/y0 C pn.x/y D 0
(3)
on an open interval I where the pi are continuous. If Y is any solution whatso-
ever of Eq. (3), then there exist numbers c1, c2, : : : ; cn such that
Y.x/ D c1y1.x/ C c2y2.x/ C    C cnyn.x/
for all x in I.
Thus every solution of a homogeneous nth-order linear differential equation
is a linear combination
y D c1y1 C c2y2 C    C cnyn
of any n given linearly independent solutions. On this basis we call such a linear
combination a general solution of the differential equation.
Example 6
According to Example 4, the particular solutions y1.x/ D e3x, y2.x/ D cos 2x, and y3.x/ D
sin 2x of the linear differential equation y.3/ C 3y00 C 4y0 C 12y D 0 are linearly independent.
Now Theorem 2 says that—given b0, b1, and b2—there exists a particular solution y.x/
satisfying the initial conditions y.0/ D b0, y0.0/ D b1, and y00.0/ D b2. Hence Theorem 4
implies that this particular solution is a linear combination of y1, y2, and y3. That is, there
exist coefﬁcients c1, c2, and c3 such that
y.x/ D c1e3x C c2 cos 2x C c3 sin 2x:
Upon successive differentiation and substitution of x D 0, we discover that to ﬁnd these
coefﬁcients, we need only solve the three linear equations
c1 C
c2
D b0,
3c1
C 2c3 D b1,
9c1  4c2
D b2.
(See the application for this section.)
Nonhomogeneous Equations
We now consider the nonhomogeneous nth-order linear differential equation
y.n/ C p1.x/y.n1/ C    C pn1.x/y0 C pn.x/y D f .x/
(2)
with associated homogeneous equation
y.n/ C p1.x/y.n1/ C    C pn1.x/y0 C pn.x/y D 0:
(3)
Suppose that a single ﬁxed particular solution yp of the nonhomogeneous
equation in (2) is known, and that Y is any other solution of Eq. (2). If yc D Y  yp,

158
Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
then subsitution of yc in the differential equation gives (using the linearity of differ-
entiation)

Thus yc D Y yp is a solution of the associated homogeneous equation in (3). Then
Y D yc C yp;
(14)
and it follows from Theorem 4 that
yc D c1y1 C c2y2 C    C cnyn;
(15)
where y1, y2, : : : ; yn are linearly independent solutions of the associated homo-
geneous equation. We call yc a complementary function of the nonhomogeneous
equation and have thus proved that a general solution of the nonhomogeneous equa-
tion in (2) is the sum of its complementary function yc and a single particular solu-
tion yp of Eq. (2).
THEOREM 5
Solutions of Nonhomogeneous Equations
Let yp be a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation in (2) on an open
interval I where the functions pi and f are continuous. Let y1, y2, : : : ; yn be
linearly independent solutions of the associated homogeneous equation in (3). If
Y is any solution whatsoever of Eq. (2) on I, then there exist numbers c1, c2, : : : ;
cn such that
Y.x/ D c1y1.x/ C c2y2.x/ C    C cnyn.x/ C yp.x/

Example 7
It is evident that yp D 3x is a particular solution of the equation
y00 C 4y D 12x;
(17)
and that yc.x/ D c1 cos 2x C c2 sin 2x is its complementary solution. Find a solution of
Eq. (17) that satisﬁes the initial conditions y.0/ D 5, y0.0/ D 7.
Solution
The general solution of Eq. (17) is
y.x/ D c1 cos 2x C c2 sin 2x C 3x:
Now
y0.x/ D 2c1 sin 2x C 2c2 cos 2x C 3:
Hence the initial conditions give
y.0/ D

y0.0/ D 2c2 C 3 D 7:
We ﬁnd that c1 D 5 and c2 D 2. Thus the desired solution is
y.x/ D 5 cos 2x C 2 sin 2x C 3x:

36. Suppose that one solution y1.x/ of the homogeneous
second-order linear differential equation
y00 C p.x/y0 C q.x/y D 0
(18)
is known (on an interval I where p and q are continuous
functions). The method of reduction of order consists
of substituting y2.x/ D v.x/y1.x/ in (18) and attempting
to determine the function v.x/ so that y2.x/ is a second
linearly independent solution of (18). After substituting
y D v.x/y1.x/ in Eq. (18), use the fact that y1.x/ is a
solution to deduce that
y1v00 C .2y0
1 C py1/v0 D 0:
(19)
If y1.x/ is known, then (19) is a separable equation that
is readily solved for the derivative v0.x/ of v.x/. Integra-
tion of v0.x/ then gives the desired (nonconstant) function
v.x/.
37. Before applying Eq. (19) with a given homogeneous
second-order linear differential equation and a known so-
lution y1.x/, the equation must ﬁrst be written in the form
of (18) with leading coefﬁcient 1 in order to correctly
determine the coefﬁcient function p.x/. Frequently it is
more convenient to simply substitute y D v.x/y1.x/ in
the given differential equation and then proceed directly
to ﬁnd v.x/. Thus, starting with the readily veriﬁed solu-
tion y1.x/ D x3 of the equation
x2y00  5xy0 C 9y D 0

substitute y D vx3 and deduce that xv00 C v0 D 0. Thence
solve for v.x/ D C ln x, and thereby obtain (with C D 1)
the second solution y2.x/ D x3 ln x.
In each of Problems 38 through 42, a differential equation and
one solution y1 are given. Use the method of reduction of or-
der as in Problem 37 to ﬁnd a second linearly independent
solution y2.

Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
3.3 Homogeneous Equations with Constant Coefﬁcients
In Section 3.2 we saw that a general solution of an nth-order homogeneous linear
equation is a linear combination of n linearly independent particular solutions, but
we said little about how actually to ﬁnd even a single solution. The solution of a
linear differential equation with variable coefﬁcients ordinarily requires numerical
methods (Chapter 2) or inﬁnite series methods (Chapter 8). But we can now show
how to ﬁnd, explicitly and in a rather straightforward way, n linearly independent
solutions of a given nth-order linear equation if it has constant coefﬁcients. The
general such equation may be written in the form
any.n/ C an1y.n1/ C    C a2y00 C a1y0 C a0y D 0;
(1)
where the coefﬁcients a0, a1, a2, : : : ; an are real constants with an ¤ 0.
The Characteristic Equation
We ﬁrst look for a single solution of Eq. (1), and begin with the observation that
d k
dxk .erx/ D rkerx;
(2)
so any derivative of erx is a constant multiple of erx. Hence, if we substituted
y D erx in Eq. (1), each term would be a constant multiple of erx, with the constant
coefﬁcients depending on r and the coefﬁcients ak. This suggests that we try to ﬁnd
r so that all these multiples of erx will have sum zero, in which case y D erx will
be a solution of Eq. (1).
For example, in Section 3.1 we substituted y D erx in the second-order equa-
tion
ay00 C by0 C cy D 0
to derive the characteristic equation
ar2 C br C c D 0
that r must satisfy.
To carry out this technique in the general case, we substitute y D erx in Eq. (1),
and with the aid of Eq. (2) we ﬁnd the result to be
anrnerx C an1rn1erx C    C a2r2erx C a1rerx C a0erx D 0I
that is,
erx 
anrn C an1rn1 C    C a2r2 C a1r C a0
	
D 0:
Because erx is never zero, we see that y D erx will be a solution of Eq. (1) precisely
when r is a root of the equation
anrn C an1rn1 C    C a2r2 C a1r C a0 D 0:
(3)
This equation is called the characteristic equation or auxiliary equation of the
differential equation in (1). Our problem, then, is reduced to the solution of this
purely algebraic equation.
According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, every nth-degree poly-
nomial—such as the one in Eq. (3)—has n zeros, though not necessarily distinct
and not necessarily real. Finding the exact values of these zeros may be difﬁcult
or even impossible; the quadratic formula is sufﬁcient for second-degree equations,
but for equations of higher degree we may need either to spot a fortuitous fac-
torization or to apply a numerical technique such as Newton’s method (or use a
calculator=computer solve command).

3.3 Homogeneous Equations with Constant Coefﬁcients
163
Distinct Real Roots
Whatever the method we use, let us suppose that we have solved the characteristic
equation. Then we can always write a general solution of the differential equation.
The situation is slightly more complicated in the case of repeated roots or complex
roots of Eq. (3), so let us ﬁrst examine the simplest case—in which the characteristic
equation has n distinct (no two equal) real roots r1, r2, : : : ; rn. Then the functions
er1x; er2x; : : : ; ernx
are all solutions of Eq. (1), and (by Problem 34 of Section 3.2) these n solutions are
linearly independent on the entire real line. In summary, we have proved Theorem 1.
THEOREM 1
Distinct Real Roots
If the roots r1, r2, : : : ; rn of the characteristic equation in (3) are real and distinct,
then
y.x/ D c1er1x C c2er2x C    C cnernx
(4)
is a general solution of Eq. (1).
Example 1
Solve the initial value problem
y.3/ C 3y00  10y0 D 0I
y.0/ D 7;
y0.0/ D 0;
y00.0/ D 70:
Solution
The characteristic equation of the given differential equation is
r3 C 3r2  10r D 0:
We solve by factoring:
r.r2 C 3r  10/ D r.r C 5/.r  2/ D 0;
and so the characteristic equation has the three distinct real roots r D 0, r D 5, and r D 2.
Because e0 D 1, Theorem 1 gives the general solution
y.x/ D c1 C c2e5x C c3e2x:
Then the given initial conditions yield the linear equations
y.0/ D c1 C
c2 C
c3 D 7,
y0.0/ D
 5c2 C 2c3 D 0,
y00.0/ D
25c2 C 4c3 D 70
in the coefﬁcients c1, c2, and c3. The last two equations give y00.0/  2y0.0/ D 35c2 D 70,
so c2 D 2. Then the second equation gives c3 D 5, and ﬁnally the ﬁrst equation gives c1 D 0.
Thus the desired particular solution is
y.x/ D 2e5x C 5e2x:

Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
Polynomial Differential Operators
If the roots of the characteristic equation in (3) are not distinct—there are repeated
roots—then we cannot produce n linearly independent solutions of Eq. (1) by the
method of Theorem 1. For example, if the roots are 1, 2, 2, and 2, we obtain only
the two functions ex and e2x. The problem, then, is to produce the missing linearly
independent solutions. For this purpose, it is convenient to adopt “operator notation”
and write Eq. (1) in the form Ly D 0, where the operator
L D an
d n
dxn C an1
d n1
dxn1 C    C a2
d 2
dx2 C a1

operates on the n-times differentiable function y.x/ to produce the linear combina-
tion
Ly D any.n/ C an1y.n1/ C    C a2y.2/ C a1y0 C a0y
of y and its ﬁrst n derivatives. We also denote by D D d=dx the operation of
differentiation with respect to x, so that
Dy D y0;
D2y D y00;
D3y D y.3/;
and so on. In terms of D, the operator L in (5) may be written
L D anDn C an1Dn1 C    C a2D2 C a1D C a0;
(6)
and we will ﬁnd it useful to think of the right-hand side in Eq. (6) as a (formal) nth-
degree polynomial in the “variable” D; it is a polynomial differential operator.
A ﬁrst-degree polynomial operator with leading coefﬁcient 1 has the form
D  a, where a is a real number. It operates on a function y D y.x/ to produce
.D  a/y D Dy  ay D y0  ay:
The important fact about such operators is that any two of them commute:
.D  a/.D  b/y D .D  b/.D  a/y
(7)
for any twice differentiable function y D y.x/. The proof of the formula in (7) is
the following computation:
.D  a/.D  b/y D .D  a/.y0  by/
D D.y0  by/  a.y0  by/
D y00  .b C a/y0 C aby D y00  .a C b/y0 C bay
D D.y0  ay/  b.y0  ay/
D .D  b/.y0  ay/ D .D  b/.D  a/y:
We see here also that .D  a/.D  b/ D D2  .a C b/D C ab. Similarly, it can
be shown by induction on the number of factors that an operator product of the
form .D  a1/.D  a2/    .D  an/ expands—by multiplying out and collecting
coefﬁcients—in the same way as does an ordinary product .x  a1/.x  a2/   
.x  an/ of linear factors, with x denoting a real variable. Consequently, the al-
gebra of polynomial differential operators closely resembles the algebra of ordinary
real polynomials.

3.3 Homogeneous Equations with Constant Coefﬁcients
165
Repeated Real Roots
Let us now consider the possibility that the characteristic equation
anrn C an1rn1 C    C a2r2 C a1r C a0 D 0
(3)
has repeated roots. For example, suppose that Eq. (3) has only two distinct roots, r0
of multiplicity 1 and r1 of multiplicity k D n  1 > 1. Then (after dividing by an)
Eq. (3) can be rewritten in the form
.r  r1/k.r  r0/ D .r  r0/.r  r1/k D 0:
(8)
Similarly, the corresponding operator L in (6) can be written as
L D .D  r1/k.D  r0/ D .D  r0/.D  r1/k;
(9)
the order of the factors making no difference because of the formula in (7).
Two solutions of the differential equation Ly D 0 are certainly y0 D er0x and
y1 D er1x. This is, however, not sufﬁcient; we need k C 1 linearly independent
solutions in order to construct a general solution, because the equation is of order
k C 1. To ﬁnd the missing k  1 solutions, we note that
Ly D .D  r0/Œ.D  r1/ky D 0:
Consequently, every solution of the kth-order equation
.D  r1/ky D 0
(10)
will also be a solution of the original equation Ly D 0. Hence our problem is
reduced to that of ﬁnding a general solution of the differential equation in (10).
The fact that y1 D er1x is one solution of Eq. (10) suggests that we try the
substitution
y.x/ D u.x/y1.x/ D u.x/er1x;
(11)
where u.x/ is a function yet to be determined. Observe that
.D  r1/ Œuer1x D .Du/er1x C u.r1er1x/  r1.uer1x/ D .Du/er1x:
(12)
Upon k applications of this fact, it follows that
.D  r1/k Œuer1x D .Dku/er1x
(13)
for any sufﬁciently differentiable function u.x/. Hence y D uer1x will be a solution
of Eq. (10) if and only if Dku D u.k/ D 0. But this is so if and only if
u.x/ D c1 C c2x C c3x2 C    C ckxk1;
a polynomial of degree at most k  1. Hence our desired solution of Eq. (10) is
y.x/ D uer1x D .c1 C c2x C c3x2 C    C ckxk1/er1x:
In particular, we see here the additional solutions xer1x, x2er1x, : : : ; xk1er1x of
the original differential equation Ly D 0.
The preceding analysis can be carried out with the operator D  r1 replaced
with an arbitrary polynomial operator. When this is done, the result is a proof of the
following theorem.

166
Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
THEOREM 2
Repeated Roots
If the characteristic equation in (3) has a repeated root r of multiplicity k, then
the part of a general solution of the differential equation in (1) corresponding to
r is of the form
.c1 C c2x C c3x2 C    C ckxk1/erx:
(14)
We may observe that, according to Problem 29 of Section 3.2, the k functions
erx, xerx, x2erx, : : : ; and xk1erx involved in (14) are linearly independent on
the real line. Thus a root of multiplicity k corresponds to k linearly independent
solutions of the differential equation.
Example 2
Find a general solution of the ﬁfth-order differential equation
9y.5/  6y.4/ C y.3/ D 0:
Solution
The characteristic equation is
9r5  6r4 C r3 D r3.9r2  6r C 1/ D r3.3r  1/2 D 0:
It has the triple root r D 0 and the double root r D 1
3. The triple root r D 0 contributes
c1e0x C c2xe0x C c3x2e0x D c1 C c2x C c3x2
to the solution, while the double root r D 1
3 contributes c4ex=3 C c5xex=3. Hence a general
solution of the given differential equation is
y.x/ D c1 C c2x C c3x2 C c4ex=3 C c5xex=3:
Complex-Valued Functions and Euler’s Formula
Because we have assumed that the coefﬁcients of the differential equation and its
characteristic equation are real, any complex (nonreal) roots will occur in complex
conjugate pairs a ˙ bi where a and b are real and i D
p
1. This raises the question
of what might be meant by an exponential such as e.aCbi/x.
To answer this question, we recall from elementary calculus the Taylor (or
MacLaurin) series for the exponential function

3.3 Homogeneous Equations with Constant Coefﬁcients
167
Because the two real series in the last line are the Taylor series for cos  and sin ,
respectively, this implies that
ei D cos  C i sin :
(15)
This result is known as Euler’s formula. Because of it, we deﬁne the exponential
function e´, for ´ D x C iy an arbitrary complex number, to be
e´ D exCiy D exeiy D ex.cos y C i sin y/:
(16)
Thus it appears that complex roots of the characteristic equation will lead to
complex-valued solutions of the differential equation. A complex-valued function
F of the real variable x associates with each real number x (in its domain of deﬁni-
tion) the complex number
F.x/ D f .x/ C ig.x/:
(17)
The real-valued functions f and g are called the real and imaginary parts, respec-
tively, of F . If they are differentiable, we deﬁne the derivative F 0 of F by
F 0.x/ D f 0.x/ C ig0.x/:
(18)
Thus we simply differentiate the real and imaginary parts of F separately.
We say that the complex-valued function F.x/ satisﬁes the homogeneous lin-
ear differential equation LŒF.x/ D 0 provided that its real and imaginary parts in
(17) separately satisfy this equation—so LŒF.x/ D LŒf .x/ C iLŒg.x/ D 0.
The particular complex-valued functions of interest here are of the form
F.x/ D erx, where r D a ˙ bi. We note from Euler’s formula that
e.aCbi/x D eaxeibx D eax.cos bx C i sin bx/
(19a)
and
e.abi/x D eaxeibx D eax.cos bx  i sin bx/:
(19b)
The most important property of erx is that
Dx.erx/ D rerx;
(20)
if r is a complex number. The proof of this assertion is a straightforward computa-
tion based on the deﬁnitions and formulas given earlier:
Dx.erx/ D Dx.eax cos bx/ C iDx.eax sin bx/
D .aeax cos bx  beax sin bx/ C i .aeax sin bx C beax cos bx/
D .a C bi/.eax cos bx C ieax sin bx/ D rerx:

168
Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
Complex Roots
It follows from Eq. (20) that when r is complex (just as when r is real), erx will be a
solution of the differential equation in (1) if and only if r is a root of its characteristic
equation. If the complex conjugate pair of roots r1 D a C bi and r2 D a  bi are
simple (nonrepeated), then the corresponding part of a general solution of Eq. (1) is
y.x/ D C1er1x C C2er2x D C1e.aCbi/x C C2e.abi/x
D C1eax.cos bx C i sin bx/ C C2eax.cos bx  i sin bx/
y.x/ D .C1 C C2/eax cos bx C i.C1  C2/eax sin bx;
where the arbitrary constants C1 and C2 can be complex. For instance, the choice
C1 D C2 D 1
2 gives the real-valued solution y1.x/ D eax cos bx, while the choice
C1 D  1
2i, C2 D 1
2i gives the independent real-valued solution y2.x/ D eax sin bx.
This yields the following result.
THEOREM 3
Complex Roots
If the characteristic equation in (3) has an unrepeated pair of complex conjugate
roots a ˙ bi (with b ¤ 0), then the corresponding part of a general solution of
Eq. (1) has the form
eax.c1 cos bx C c2 sin bx/:
(21)
Example 3
The characteristic equation of
y00 C b2y D 0
.b > 0/
is r2 C b2 D 0, with roots r D ˙bi. So Theorem 3 (with a D 0) gives the general solution
y.x/ D c1 cos bx C c2 sin bx:
Example 4
Find the particular solution of
y00  4y0 C 5y D 0
for which y.0/ D 1 and y0.0/ D 5.
Solution
Completion of the square in the characteristic equation yields
r2  4r C 5 D .r  2/2 C 1 D 0;
so r  2 D ˙
p
1 D ˙i. Thus we obtain the complex conjugate roots 2 ˙ i (which could
also be found directly using the quadratic formula). Hence Theorem 3 with a D 2 and b D 1
gives the general solution
y.x/ D e2x.c1 cos x C c2 sin x/:
Then
y0.x/ D 2e2x.c1 cos x C c2 sin x/ C e2x.c1 sin x C c2 cos x/;
so the initial conditions give
y.0/ D c1 D 1
and
y0.0/ D 2c1 C c2 D 5:
It follows that c2 D 3, and so the desired particular solution is
y.x/ D e2x.cos x C 3 sin x/:

In applications we are seldom presented in advance with a factorization as
convenient as the one in Example 6. Often the most difﬁcult part of solving a homo-
geneous linear equation is ﬁnding the roots of its characteristic equation. Example 7
illustrates an approach that may succeed when a root of the characteristic equation
can be found by inspection. The project material for this section illustrates other
possibilities.
Example 7
The characteristic equation of the differential equation
y.3/ C y0  10y D 0
is the cubic equation
r3 C r  10 D 0:
By a standard theorem of elementary algebra, the only possible rational roots are the factors
˙1, ˙2, ˙5, and ˙10 of the constant term 10. By trial and error (if not by inspection) we
discover the root 2. The factor theorem of elementary algebra implies that r  2 is a factor
of r3 C r  10, and division of the former into the latter produces as quotient the quadratic
polynomial
r2 C 2r C 5 D .r C 1/2 C 4:
The roots of this quotient are the complex conjugates 1 ˙ 2i. The three roots we have found
now yield the general solution
y.x/ D c1e2x C ex.c2 cos 2x C c3 sin 2x/:

3.3 Application Approximate Solutions of Linear Equations
To meet the needs of applications such as those of this section, polynomial-solving
utilities are now a common feature of calculator and computer systems and can be
used to solve a characteristic equation numerically even when no simple factoriza-
tion is evident or even possible. For instance, suppose that we want to solve the
homogeneous linear differential equation

approximate roots of a polynomial equation. As indicated in Figs. 3.3.3 and 3.3.4,
we ﬁnd that the roots of Eq. (2) are given by r  0:5321, 0:6527, and 2:8794. Some

3.4 Mechanical Vibrations
The motion of a mass attached to a spring serves as a relatively simple example
of the vibrations that occur in more complex mechanical systems. For many such
systems, the analysis of these vibrations is a problem in the solution of linear differ-
ential equations with constant coefﬁcients.

3.4 Mechanical Vibrations
173
We consider a body of mass m attached to one end of an ordinary spring that
resists compression as well as stretching; the other end of the spring is attached to
a ﬁxed wall, as shown in Fig. 3.4.1. Assume that the body rests on a frictionless
horizontal plane, so that it can move only back and forth as the spring compresses
and stretches. Denote by x the distance of the body from its equilibrium position—
its position when the spring is unstretched. We take x > 0 when the spring is
Equilibrium

stretched, and thus x < 0 when it is compressed.
According to Hooke’s law, the restorative force FS that the spring exerts on
the mass is proportional to the distance x that the spring has been stretched or com-
pressed. Because this is the same as the displacement x of the mass m from its
equilibrium position, it follows that
FS D kx:
(1)
The positive constant of proportionality k is called the spring constant. Note that
FS and x have opposite signs: FS < 0 when x > 0, FS > 0 when x < 0.
Figure 3.4.1 shows the mass attached to a dashpot—a device, like a shock
absorber, that provides a force directed opposite to the instantaneous direction of
motion of the mass m. We assume the dashpot is so designed that this force FR is
proportional to the velocity v D dx=dt of the mass; that is,
FR D cv D c dx
dt :
(2)
The positive constant c is the damping constant of the dashpot. More generally,
we may regard Eq. (2) as specifying frictional forces in our system (including air
resistance to the motion of m).
If, in addition to the forces FS and FR, the mass is subjected to a given exter-
nal force FE D F.t/, then the total force acting on the mass is F D FS C FR C FE.
Using Newton’s law
F D ma D md 2x
dt2 D mx00;
we obtain the second-order linear differential equation
mx00 C cx0 C kx D F.t/
(3)
that governs the motion of the mass.
If there is no dashpot (and we ignore all frictional forces), then we set c D 0
in Eq. (3) and call the motion undamped; it is damped motion if c > 0. If there is
no external force, we replace F.t/ with 0 in Eq. (3). We refer to the motion as free
in this case and forced in the case F.t/ ¤ 0. Thus the homogeneous equation
mx00 C cx0 C kx D 0
(4)
describes free motion of a mass on a spring with dashpot but with no external forces
applied. We will defer discussion of forced motion until Section 3.6.
For an alternative example, we might attach the mass to the lower end of a
spring that is suspended vertically from a ﬁxed support, as in Fig. 3.4.2. In this case
the weight W D mg of the mass would stretch the spring a distance s0 determined
by Eq. (1) with FS D W and x D s0. That is, mg D ks0, so that s0 D mg=k. This
gives the static equilibrium position of the mass. If y denotes the displacement of
the mass in motion, measured downward from its static equilibrium position, then
we ask you to show in Problem 9 that y satisﬁes Eq. (3); speciﬁcally, that

The Simple Pendulum
The importance of the differential equation that appears in Eqs. (3) and (5) stems

FIGURE 3.4.3.

from the fact that it describes the motion of many other simple mechanical systems.
For example, a simple pendulum consists of a mass m swinging back and forth on
the end of a string (or better, a massless rod) of length L, as shown in Fig. 3.4.3.
We may specify the position of the mass at time t by giving the counterclockwise
angle  D .t/ that the string or rod makes with the vertical at time t. To analyze
the motion of the mass m, we will apply the law of the conservation of mechanical
energy, according to which the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy
of m remains constant.
The distance along the circular arc from 0 to m is s D L, so the velocity of
the mass is v D ds=dt D L.d=dt/, and therefore its kinetic energy is
T D 1

D 1

We next choose as reference point the lowest point O reached by the mass (see
Fig. 3.4.3). Then its potential energy V is the product of its weight mg and its
vertical height h D L.1  cos / above O, so
V D mgL.1  cos /:
The fact that the sum of T and V is a constant C therefore gives

after removal of the common factor mL2.d=dt/. This differential equation can
be derived in a seemingly more elementary manner using the familiar second law
F D ma of Newton (applied to tangential components of the acceleration of the mass
and the force acting on it). However, derivations of differential equations based on
conservation of energy are often seen in more complex situations where Newton’s
law is not so directly applicable, and it may be instructive to see the energy method
in a simpler application like the pendulum.
Now recall that if  is small, then sin    (this approximation obtained by
retaining just the ﬁrst term in the Taylor series for sin ). In fact, sin  and  agree
to two decimal places when jj is at most =12 (that is, 15ı). In a typical pendulum
clock, for example,  would never exceed 15ı. It therefore seems reasonable to
simplify our mathematical model of the simple pendulum by replacing sin  with 
in Eq. (6). If we also insert a term c0 to account for the frictional resistance of the
surrounding medium, the result is an equation in the form of Eq. (4):
00 C c0 C k D 0;
(7)

3.4 Mechanical Vibrations
175
where k D g=L. Note that this equation is independent of the mass m on the end
of the rod. We might, however, expect the effects of the discrepancy between  and
sin  to accumulate over a period of time, so that Eq. (7) will probably not describe
accurately the actual motion of the pendulum over a long period of time.
In the remainder of this section, we ﬁrst analyze free undamped motion and
then free damped motion.
Free Undamped Motion
If we have only a mass on a spring, with neither damping nor external force, then
Eq. (3) takes the simpler form
mx00 C kx D 0:

It is convenient to deﬁne

The general solution of Eq. (80) is
x.t/ D A cos !0t C B sin !0t:

To analyze the motion described by this solution, we choose constants C and
˛ so that

the interval =2 < x < =2). Instead, ˛ is the angle between 0 and 2 whose cosine

If the initial position x.0/ D x0 and initial velocity x0.0/ D v0 of the mass are
given, we ﬁrst determine the values of the coefﬁcients A and B in Eq. (10), then ﬁnd
the amplitude C and phase angle ˛ by carrying out the transformation of x.t/ to the
form in Eq. (12), as indicated previously.
Example 1
A body with mass m D 1
2 kilogram (kg) is attached to the end of a spring that is stretched 2
meters (m) by a force of 100 newtons (N). It is set in motion with initial position x0 D 1 (m)
and initial velocity v0 D 5 (m/s). (Note that these initial conditions indicate that the body
is displaced to the right and is moving to the left at time t D 0.) Find the position function of
the body as well as the amplitude, frequency, period of oscillation, and time lag of its motion.
Solution
The spring constant is k D .100 N/=.2 m/ D 50 (N=m), so Eq. (8) yields 1
2x00 C 50x D 0;
that is,
x00 C 100x D 0:
Consequently, the circular frequency of the resulting simple harmonic motion of the body
will be !0 D

OVERDAMPED CASE: c > ccr (c2 > 4km).
Because c is relatively large in this
case, we are dealing with a strong resistance in comparison with a relatively weak
spring or a small mass. Then (17) gives distinct real roots r1 and r2, both of which
are negative. The position function has the form
x.t/ D c1er1t C c2er2t:
(19)
It is easy to see that x.t/ ! 0 as t ! C1 and that the body settles to its equilibrium
position without any oscillations (Problem 29). Figure 3.4.7 shows some typical
graphs of the position function for the overdamped case; we chose x0 a ﬁxed positive
number and illustrated the effects of changing the initial velocity v0. In every case
the would-be oscillations are damped out.

Fig. 3.4.8, and they resemble those of the overdamped case (Fig. 3.4.7). In the
critically damped case, the resistance of the dashpot is just large enough to damp
out any oscillations, but even a slight reduction in resistance will bring us to the
remaining case, the one that shows the most dramatic behavior.

envelope” curves x D Cept and x D Cept and touches them when !1t  ˛ is
an integral multiple of . The motion is not actually periodic, but it is nevertheless
useful to call !1 its circular frequency (more properly, its pseudofrequency), T1 D
2=!1 its pseudoperiod of oscillation, and Cept its time-varying amplitude.
Most of these quantities are shown in the typical graph of underdamped motion in
Fig. 3.4.9. Note from Eq. (22) that in this case !1 is less than the undamped circular
frequency !0, so T1 is larger than the period T of oscillation of the same mass
without damping on the same spring. Thus the action of the dashpot has at least two
effects:
1. It exponentially damps the oscillations, in accord with the time-varying
amplitude.
2. It slows the motion; that is, the dashpot decreases the frequency of the motion.
As the following example illustrates, damping typically also delays the motion
further—that is, increases the time lag—as compared with undamped motion with
the same initial conditions.
Example 2
The mass and spring of Example 1 are now attached also to a dashpot that provides 1 N of
resistance for each meter per second of velocity. The mass is set in motion with the same
initial position x.0/ D 1 and initial velocity x0.0/ D 5 as in Example 1. Now ﬁnd the
position function of the mass, its new frequency and pseudoperiod of motion, its new time
lag, and the times of its ﬁrst four passages through the initial position x D 0.
Solution
Rather than memorizing the various formulas given in the preceding discussion, it is better
practice in a particular case to set up the differential equation and then solve it directly.
Recall that m D 1
2 and k D 50; we are now given c D 1 in mks units. Hence Eq. (4) is
1
2x00 C x0 C 50x D 0; that is,
x00 C 2x0 C 100x D 0:
The characteristic equation r2 C 2r C 100 D .r C 1/2 C 99 D 0 has roots r1, r2 D 1 ˙

9. Derive Eq. (5) describing the motion of a mass attached to
the bottom of a vertically suspended spring. (Suggestion:
First denote by x.t/ the displacement of the mass below
the unstretched position of the spring; set up the differ-
ential equation for x. Then substitute y D x  s0 in this
differential equation.)
10. Consider a ﬂoating cylindrical buoy with radius r, height
h, and uniform density  5 0:5 (recall that the density of
water is 1 g=cm3). The buoy is initially suspended at rest
with its bottom at the top surface of the water and is re-
leased at time t D 0. Thereafter it is acted on by two
forces: a downward gravitational force equal to its weight
mg D r2hg and (by Archimedes’ principle of buoy-
ancy) an upward force equal to the weight r2xg of wa-
ter displaced, where x D x.t/ is the depth of the bottom
of the buoy beneath the surface at time t (Fig. 3.4.12).
Assume that friction is negligible. Conclude that the buoy
undergoes simple harmonic motion around its equilibrium
position xe D h with period p D 2

s. Find the radius of the buoy.
12. Assume that the earth is a solid sphere of uniform density,
with mass M and radius R D 3960 (mi). For a particle of
mass m within the earth at distance r from the center of
the earth, the gravitational force attracting m toward the

(b) Now suppose
that a small hole is drilled straight through the center of
the earth, thus connecting two antipodal points on its sur-
face. Let a particle of mass m be dropped at time t D 0

distance from the center of the earth at time t, where we
take r < 0 when the mass is “below” the center of the
earth. Conclude from Newton’s second law and part (a)

The remaining problems in this section deal with free damped
motion. In Problems 15 through 21, a mass m is attached
to both a spring (with given spring constant k) and a dash-
pot (with given damping constant c). The mass is set in mo-
tion with initial position x0 and initial velocity v0. Find the
position function x.t/ and determine whether the motion is
overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped. If it is un-
derdamped, write the position function in the form x.t/ D
C1ept cos.!1t  ˛1/.
Also, ﬁnd the undamped position
function u.t/ D C0 cos.!0t  ˛0/ that would result if the mass
on the spring were set in motion with the same initial position
and velocity, but with the dashpot disconnected (so c D 0). Fi-
nally, construct a ﬁgure that illustrates the effect of damping
by comparing the graphs of x.t/ and u.t/.

22. A 12-lb weight (mass m D 0:375 slugs in fps units)
is attached both to a vertically suspended spring that it
stretches 6 in. and to a dashpot that provides 3 lb of re-
sistance for every foot per second of velocity. (a) If the
weight is pulled down 1 ft below its static equilibrium po-
sition and then released from rest at time t D 0, ﬁnd its po-
sition function x.t/. (b) Find the frequency, time-varying
amplitude, and phase angle of the motion.
23. This problem deals with a highly simpliﬁed model of a car
of weight 3200 lb (mass m D 100 slugs in fps units). As-
sume that the suspension system acts like a single spring
and its shock absorbers like a single dashpot, so that its
vertical vibrations satisfy Eq. (4) with appropriate values
of the coefﬁcients.
(a) Find the stiffness coefﬁcient k
of the spring if the car undergoes free vibrations at 80 cy-
cles per minute (cycles=min) when its shock absorbers are
disconnected.
(b) With the shock absorbers connected,
the car is set into vibration by driving it over a bump, and
the resulting damped vibrations have a frequency of 78
cycles=min. After how long will the time-varying ampli-
tude be 1% of its initial value?
Problems 24 through 34 deal with a mass–spring–dashpot sys-
tem having position function x.t/ satisfying Eq. (4). We write

Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
Note: The result of Problem 33 provides an accurate method
for measuring the viscosity of a ﬂuid, which is an important
parameter in ﬂuid dynamics but is not easy to measure directly.
According to Stokes’s drag law, a spherical body of radius a
moving at a (relatively slow) speed through a ﬂuid of viscosity
 experiences a resistive force FR D 6av. Thus if a spheri-
cal mass on a spring is immersed in the ﬂuid and set in motion,
this drag resistance damps its oscillations with damping con-
stant c D 6a. The frequency !1 and logarithmic decrement
 of the oscillations can be measured by direct observation.
The ﬁnal formula in Problem 33 then gives c and hence the
viscosity of the ﬂuid.
34. (Underdamped) A body weighing 100 lb (mass m D 3:125
slugs in fps units) is oscillating attached to a spring and
a dashpot. Its ﬁrst two maximum displacements of 6:73
in. and 1:46 in. are observed to occur at times 0:34 s and
1:17 s, respectively. Compute the damping constant (in
pound-seconds per foot) and spring constant (in pounds
per foot).
Differential Equations and Determinism
Given a mass m, a dashpot constant c, and a spring constant
k, Theorem 2 of Section 3.1 implies that the equation
mx00 C cx0 C kx D 0
(26)
has a unique solution for t = 0 satisfying given initial condi-
tions x.0/ D x0, x0.0/ D v0. Thus the future motion of an ideal
mass–spring–dashpot system is completely determined by the
differential equation and the initial conditions. Of course in
a real physical system it is impossible to measure the param-
eters m, c, and k precisely. Problems 35 through 38 explore
the resulting uncertainty in predicting the future behavior of a
physical system.
35. Suppose that m D 1, c D 2, and k D 1 in Eq. (26). Show
that the solution with x.0/ D 0 and x0.0/ D 1 is
x1.t/ D tet:
36. Suppose that m D 1 and c D 2 but k D 1  102n. Show
that the solution of Eq. (26) with x.0/ D 0 and x0.0/ D 1
is
x2.t/ D 10net sinh 10nt:
37. Suppose that m D 1 and c D 2 but that k D 1 C 102n.
Show that the solution of Eq. (26) with x.0/ D 0 and
x0.0/ D 1 is
x3.t/ D 10net sin 10nt:
38. Whereas the graphs of x1.t/ and x2.t/ resemble those
shown in Figs. 3.4.7 and 3.4.8, the graph of x3.t/ exhibits
damped oscillations like those illustrated in Fig. 3.4.9, but
with a very long pseudoperiod. Nevertheless, show that
for each ﬁxed t > 0 it is true that
lim
n!1 x2.t/ D lim
n!1 x3.t/ D x1.t/:
Conclude that on a given ﬁnite time interval the three solu-
tions are in “practical” agreement if n is sufﬁciently large.
3.5 Nonhomogeneous Equations and Undetermined Coefﬁcients
We learned in Section 3.3 how to solve homogeneous linear equations with constant
coefﬁcients, but we saw in Section 3.4 that an external force in a simple mechanical
system contributes a nonhomogeneous term to its differential equation. The general
nonhomogeneous nth-order linear equation with constant coefﬁcients has the form
any.n/ C an1y.n1/ C    C a1y0 C a0y D f .x/:
(1)
By Theorem 5 of Section 3.2, a general solution of Eq. (1) has the form
y D yc C yp
(2)
where the complementary function yc.x/ is a general solution of the associated
homogeneous equation
any.n/ C an1y.n1/ C    C a1y0 C a0y D 0;
(3)
and yp.x/ is a particular solution of Eq. (1). Thus our remaining task is to ﬁnd yp.
The method of undetermined coefﬁcients is a straightforward way of doing
this when the given function f .x/ in Eq. (1) is sufﬁciently simple that we can make
an intelligent guess as to the general form of yp. For example, suppose that f .x/
is a polynomial of degree m. Then, because the derivatives of a polynomial are

3.5 Nonhomogeneous Equations and Undetermined Coefﬁcients
185
themselves polynomials of lower degree, it is reasonable to suspect a particular
solution
yp.x/ D Amxm C Am1xm1 C    C A1x C A0
that is also a polynomial of degree m, but with as yet undetermined coefﬁcients. We
may, therefore, substitute this expression for yp into Eq. (1), and then—by equating
coefﬁcients of like powers of x on the two sides of the resulting equation—attempt
to determine the coefﬁcients A0, A1, : : : ; Am so that yp will, indeed, be a particular
solution of Eq. (1).
Similarly, suppose that
f .x/ D a cos kx C b sin kx:
Then it is reasonable to expect a particular solution of the same form:
yp.x/ D A cos kx C B sin kx;
a linear combination with undetermined coefﬁcients A and B. The reason is that
any derivative of such a linear combination of cos kx and sin kx has the same form.
We may therefore substitute this form of yp in Eq. (1), and then—by equating co-
efﬁcients of cos kx and sin kx on both sides of the resulting equation—attempt to
determine the coefﬁcients A and B so that yp will, indeed, be a particular solution.
It turns out that this approach does succeed whenever all the derivatives of
f .x/ have the same form as f .x/ itself. Before describing the method in full gener-
ality, we illustrate it with several preliminary examples.
Example 1
Find a particular solution of y00 C 3y0 C 4y D 3x C 2.
Solution
Here f .x/ D 3x C 2 is a polynomial of degree 1, so our guess is that
yp.x/ D Ax C B:
Then y0
p D A and y00
p D 0, so yp will satisfy the differential equation provided that
.0/ C 3.A/ C 4.Ax C B/ D 3x C 2;
that is,
.4A/x C .3A C 4B/ D 3x C 2
for all x. This will be true if the x-terms and constant terms on the two sides of this equation
agree. It therefore sufﬁces for A and B to satisfy the two linear equations 4A D 3 and
3A C 4B D 2 that we readily solve for A D 3
4 and B D  1
16. Thus we have found the
particular solution
yp.x/ D 3
4x  1
16:
Example 2
Find a particular solution of y00  4y D 2e3x.
Solution
Any derivative of e3x is a constant multiple of e3x, so it is reasonable to try
yp.x/ D Ae3x:
Then y00
p D 9Ae3x, so the given differential equation will be satisﬁed provided that
9Ae3x  4.Ae3x/ D 2e3xI
that is, 5A D 2, so that A D 2
5. Thus our particular solution is yp.x/ D 2
5e3x.

186
Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
Example 3
Find a particular solution of 3y00 C y0  2y D 2 cos x.
Solution
A ﬁrst guess might be yp.x/ D A cos x, but the presence of y0 on the left-hand side signals
that we probably need a term involving sin x as well. So we try
yp.x/ D
A cos x C B sin x;
y0
p.x/ D A sin x C B cos x;
y00
p.x/ D A cos x  B sin x:
Then substitution of yp and its derivatives into the given differential equation yields
3.A cos x  B sin x/ C .A sin x C B cos x/  2.A cos x C B sin x/ D 2 cos x;
that is (collecting coefﬁcients on the left),
.5A C B/ cos x C .A  5B/ sin x D 2 cos x:
This will be true for all x provided that the cosine and sine terms on the two sides of this
equation agree. It therefore sufﬁces for A and B to satisfy the two linear equations
5A C B D 2,
A  5B D 0
with readily found solution A D  5
13, B D

13. Hence a particular solution is
yp.x/ D  5
13 cos x C 1
13 sin x:
The following example, which superﬁcially resembles Example 2, indicates
that the method of undetermined coefﬁcients is not always quite so simple as we
have made it appear.
Example 4
Find a particular solution of y00  4y D 2e2x.
Solution
If we try yp.x/ D Ae2x, we ﬁnd that
y00
p  4yp D 4Ae2x  4Ae2x D 0 ¤ 2e2x:
Thus, no matter how A is chosen, Ae2x cannot satisfy the given nonhomogeneous equation.
In fact, the preceding computation shows that Ae2x satisﬁes instead the associated homo-
geneous equation. Therefore, we should begin with a trial function yp.x/ whose derivative
involves both e2x and something else that can cancel upon substitution into the differential
equation to leave the e2x term that we need. A reasonable guess is
yp.x/ D Axe2x;
for which
y0
p.x/ D Ae2x C 2Axe2x
and
y00
p.x/ D 4Ae2x C 4Axe2x:
Substitution into the original differential equation yields
.4Ae2x C 4Axe2x/  4.Axe2x/ D 2e2x:
The terms involving xe2x obligingly cancel, leaving only 4Ae2x D 2e2x, so that A D 1
2.
Consequently, a particular solution is
yp.x/ D 1
2xe2x:

3.5 Nonhomogeneous Equations and Undetermined Coefﬁcients
187
The General Approach
Our initial difﬁculty in Example 4 resulted from the fact that f .x/ D 2e2x satisﬁes
the associated homogeneous equation. Rule 1, given shortly, tells what to do when
we do not have this difﬁculty, and Rule 2 tells what to do when we do have it.
The method of undetermined coefﬁcients applies whenever the function f .x/
in Eq. (1) is a linear combination of (ﬁnite) products of functions of the following
three types:
1. A polynomial in x;
2. An exponential function erx;
(4)
3. cos kx or sin kx.
Any such function, for example,
f .x/ D .3  4x2/e5x  4x3 cos 10x;
has the crucial property that only ﬁnitely many linearly independent functions ap-
pear as terms (summands) in f .x/ and its derivatives of all orders. In Rules 1 and
2 we assume that Ly D f .x/ is a nonhomogeneous linear equation with constant
coefﬁcients and that f .x/ is a function of this kind.
RULE 1
Method of Undetermined Coefﬁcients
Suppose that no term appearing either in f .x/ or in any of its derivatives satisﬁes
the associated homogeneous equation Ly D 0. Then take as a trial solution for
yp a linear combination of all linearly independent such terms and their deriva-
tives. Then determine the coefﬁcients by substitution of this trial solution into
the nonhomogeneous equation Ly D f .x/.
Note that this rule is not a theorem requiring proof; it is merely a procedure to
be followed in searching for a particular solution yp. If we succeed in ﬁnding yp,
then nothing more need be said. (It can be proved, however, that this procedure will
always succeed under the conditions speciﬁed here.)
In practice we check the supposition made in Rule 1 by ﬁrst using the charac-
teristic equation to ﬁnd the complementary function yc, and then write a list of all
the terms appearing in f .x/ and its successive derivatives. If none of the terms in
this list duplicates a term in yc, then we proceed with Rule 1.
Example 5
Find a particular solution of
y00 C 4y D 3x3:
(5)
Solution
The (familiar) complementary solution of Eq. (5) is
yc.x/ D c1 cos 2x C c2 sin 2x:
The function f .x/ D 3x3 and its derivatives are constant multiples of the linearly independent
functions x3, x2, x, and 1. Because none of these appears in yc, we try
yp D Ax3 C Bx2 C Cx C D;
y0
p D 3Ax2 C 2Bx C C;
y00
p D 6Ax C 2B:
Substitution in Eq. (5) gives
y00

Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
We equate coefﬁcients of like powers of x in the last equation to get

6A C 4C D 0;
2B C 4D D 0
with solution A D 3

y00  3y0 C 2y D 3ex  10 cos 3xI

y0.0/ D 2:
(6)
Solution
The characteristic equation r2  3r C 2 D 0 has roots r D 1 and r D 2, so the complementary
function is
yc.x/ D c1ex C c2e2x:
The terms involved in f .x/ D 3ex 10 cos 3x and its derivatives are ex, cos 3x, and sin 3x.
Because none of these appears in yc, we try
yp D

y0
p D Aex  3B sin 3x C 3C cos 3x;
y00
p D
Aex  9B cos 3x  9C sin 3x:
After we substitute these expressions into the differential equation in (6) and collect coefﬁ-
cients, we get
y00
p  3y0
p C 2yp D 6Aex C .7B  9C/ cos 3x C .9B  7C/ sin 3x
D 3ex  10 cos 3x:
We equate the coefﬁcients of the terms involving ex, those involving cos 3x, and those
involving sin 3x. The result is the system

7B  9C D 10,
9B  7C D

with solution A D 1

yp.x/ D 1
2ex C 7
13 cos 3x C 9
13 sin 3x;
which, however, does not have the required initial values in (6).
To satisfy those initial conditions, we begin with the general solution
y.x/ D yc.x/ C yp.x/
D c1ex C c2e2x C 1
2ex C 7

with derivative

2ex  21
13 sin 3x C 27

The initial conditions in (6) lead to the equations

y0.0/ D c1 C 2c2  1

189
Example 7
Find the general form of a particular solution of
y.3/ C 9y0 D x sin x C x2e2x:
(7)
Solution
The characteristic equation r3 C 9r D 0 has roots r D 0, r D 3i, and r D 3i. So the
complementary function is
yc.x/ D c1 C c2 cos 3x C c3 sin 3x:
The derivatives of the right-hand side in Eq. (7) involve the terms
cos x;
sin x;
x cos x;
x sin x;
e2x;
xe2x;
and
x2e2x:
Because there is no duplication with the terms of the complementary function, the trial solu-
tion takes the form
yp.x/ D A cos x C B sin x C Cx cos x C Dx sin x C Ee2x C F xe2x C Gx2e2x:
Upon substituting yp in Eq. (7) and equating coefﬁcients of like terms, we get seven equations
determining the seven coefﬁcients A, B, C, D, E, F , and G.
The Case of Duplication
Now we turn our attention to the situation in which Rule 1 does not apply: Some of
the terms involved in f .x/ and its derivatives satisfy the associated homogeneous
equation. For instance, suppose that we want to ﬁnd a particular solution of the
differential equation
.D  r/3y D .2x  3/erx:
(8)
Proceeding as in Rule 1, our ﬁrst guess would be
yp.x/ D Aerx C Bxerx:
(9)
This form of yp.x/ will not be adequate because the complementary function of
Eq. (8) is
yc.x/ D c1erx C c2xerx C c3x2erx;
(10)
so substitution of (9) in the left-hand side of (8) would yield zero rather than
.2x  3/erx.
To see how to amend our ﬁrst guess, we observe that
.D  r/2Œ.2x  3/erx D ŒD2.2x  3/erx D 0
by Eq. (13) of Section 3.3. If y.x/ is any solution of Eq. (8) and we apply the
operator .D  r/2 to both sides, we see that y.x/ is also a solution of the equation
.D  r/5y D 0. The general solution of this homogeneous equation can be written
as
y.x/ D c1erx C c2xerx C c3x2erx
„
ƒ‚
…
yc
C Ax3erx C Bx4erx
„
ƒ‚
…
yp
:
Thus every solution of our original equation in (8) is the sum of a complementary
function and a particular solution of the form
yp.x/ D Ax3erx C Bx4erx:
(11)

190
Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
Note that the right-hand side in Eq. (11) can be obtained by multiplying each term
of our ﬁrst guess in (9) by the least positive integral power of x (in this case, x3)
that sufﬁces to eliminate duplication between the terms of the resulting trial solution
yp.x/ and the complementary function yc.x/ given in (10). This procedure succeeds
in the general case.
To simplify the general statement of Rule 2, we observe that to ﬁnd a particular
solution of the nonhomogeneous linear differential equation
Ly D f1.x/ C f2.x/;
(12)
it sufﬁces to ﬁnd separately particular solutions Y1.x/ and Y2.x/ of the two equa-
tions
Ly D f1.x/
and
Ly D f2.x/;
(13)
respectively. For linearity then gives
LŒY1 C Y2 D LY1 C LY2 D f1.x/ C f2.x/;
and therefore yp D Y1 C Y2 is a particular solution of Eq. (12). (This is a type of
“superposition principle” for nonhomogeneous linear equations.)
Now our problem is to ﬁnd a particular solution of the equation Ly D f .x/,
where f .x/ is a linear combination of products of the elementary functions listed in
(4). Thus f .x/ can be written as a sum of terms each of the form
Pm.x/erx cos kx
or
Pm.x/erx sin kx;
(14)
where Pm.x/ is a polynomial in x of degree m. Note that any derivative of such
a term is of the same form but with both sines and cosines appearing. The proce-
dure by which we arrived earlier at the particular solution in (11) of Eq. (8) can be
generalized to show that the following procedure is always successful.
RULE 2
Method of Undetermined Coefﬁcients
If the function f .x/ is of either form in (14), take as the trial solution
yp.x/ D xsŒ.A0 C A1x C A2x2 C    C Amxm/erx cos kx
C .B0 C B1x C B2x2 C    C Bmxm/erx sin kx;
(15)
where s is the smallest nonnegative integer such that no term in yp duplicates
a term in the complementary function yc. Then determine the coefﬁcients in
Eq. (15) by substituting yp into the nonhomogeneous equation.
In practice we seldom need to deal with a function f .x/ exhibiting the full
generality in (14). The table in Fig. 3.5.1 lists the form of yp in various common
cases, corresponding to the possibilities m D 0, r D 0, and k D 0.
On the other hand, it is common to have
f .x/ D f1.x/ C f2.x/;
where f1.x/ and f2.x/ are different functions of the sort listed in the table in
Fig. 3.5.1. In this event we take as yp the sum of the trial solutions for f1.x/
and f2.x/, choosing s separately for each part to eliminate duplication with the
complementary function. This procedure is illustrated in Examples 8 through 10.

Example 8
Find a particular solution of
y.3/ C y00 D 3ex C 4x2:
(16)
Solution
The characteristic equation r3 C r2 D 0 has roots r1 D r2 D 0 and r3 D 1, so the comple-
mentary function is
yc.x/ D c1 C c2x C c3ex:
As a ﬁrst step toward our particular solution, we form the sum
.Aex/ C .B C Cx C Dx2/:
The part Aex corresponding to 3ex does not duplicate any part of the complementary func-
tion, but the part B C Cx C Dx2 must be multiplied by x2 to eliminate duplication. Hence
we take
yp D Aex C Bx2 C Cx3 C Dx4;

y00
p D Aex C 2B C 6Cx C 12Dx2;

The system of equations

tion is
yc.x/ D e3x.c1 cos 2x C c2 sin 2x/:
This is the same form as a ﬁrst attempt e3x.A cos 2x C B sin 2x/ at a particular solution, so
we must multiply by x to eliminate duplication. Hence we would take
yp.x/ D e3x.Ax cos 2x C Bx sin 2x/:

Solution
The characteristic equation .r  2/3.r2 C 9/ D 0 has roots r D 2, 2, 2, 3i, and 3i, so the
complementary function is
yc.x/ D c1e2x C c2xe2x C c3x2e2x C c4 cos 3x C c5 sin 3x:
As a ﬁrst step toward the form of a particular solution, we examine the sum

To

the

Variation of Parameters
Finally, let us point out the kind of situation in which the method of undetermined
coefﬁcients cannot be used. Consider, for example, the equation
y00 C y D tan x;
(17)
which at ﬁrst glance may appear similar to those considered in the preceding ex-
amples. Not so; the function f .x/ D tan x has inﬁnitely many linearly independent
derivatives
sec2 x;
2 sec2 x tan x;
4 sec2 x tan2 x C 2 sec4 x;
: : : :
Therefore, we do not have available a ﬁnite linear combination to use as a trial
solution.
We discuss here the method of variation of parameters, which—in principle
(that is, if the integrals that appear can be evaluated)—can always be used to ﬁnd a
particular solution of the nonhomogeneous linear differential equation
y.n/ C pn1.x/y.n1/ C    C p1.x/y0 C p0.x/y D f .x/;
(18)
provided that we already know the general solution

(19)
of the associated homogeneous equation
y.n/ C pn1.x/y.n1/ C    C p1.x/y0 C p0.x/y D 0:
(20)
Here, in brief, is the basic idea of the method of variation of parameters. Sup-
pose that we replace the constants, or parameters, c1, c2, : : : ; cn in the complemen-
tary function in Eq. (19) with variables: functions u1, u2, : : : ; un of x. We ask
whether it is possible to choose these functions in such a way that the combination
yp.x/ D u1.x/y1.x/ C u2.x/y2.x/ C    C un.x/yn.x/
(21)

3.5 Nonhomogeneous Equations and Undetermined Coefﬁcients
193
is a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation in (18). It turns out that
this is always possible.
The method is essentially the same for all orders n = 2, but we will describe
it in detail only for the case n D 2. So we begin with the second-order nonhomoge-
neous equation
LŒy D y00 C P.x/y0 C Q.x/y D f .x/
(22)
with complementary function
yc.x/ D c1y1.x/ C c2y2.x/
(23)
on some open interval I where the functions P and Q are continuous. We want to
ﬁnd functions u1 and u2 such that
yp.x/ D u1.x/y1.x/ C u2.x/y2.x/
(24)
is a particular solution of Eq. (22).
One condition on the two functions u1 and u2 is that LŒyp D f .x/. Because
two conditions are required to determine two functions, we are free to impose an
additional condition of our choice. We will do so in a way that simpliﬁes the com-
putations as much as possible. But ﬁrst, to impose the condition LŒyp D f .x/, we
must compute the derivatives y0
p and y00
p. The product rule gives
y0
p D .u1y0
1 C u2y0
2/ C .u0
1y1 C u0
2y2/:
To avoid the appearance of the second derivatives u00
1 and u00
2, the additional condition
that we now impose is that the second sum here must vanish:
u0
1y1 C u0
2y2 D 0:
(25)
Then
y0
p D u1y0
1 C u2y0

(26)
and the product rule gives
y00
p D .u1y00

1y0
1 C u0
2y0
2/:
(27)
But both y1 and y2 satisfy the homogeneous equation
y00 C Py0 C Qy D 0
associated with the nonhomogeneous equation in (22), so
y00

(31)
of two linear equations in the two derivatives u0

of coefﬁcients in (31) is simply the Wronskian W.y1; y2/. Once we have solved
the equations in (31) for the derivatives u0
1 and u0
2, we integrate each to obtain the
functions u1 and u2 such that
yp D u1y1 C u2y2
(32)
is the desired particular solution of Eq. (22). In Problem 63 we ask you to carry
out this process explicitly and thereby verify the formula for yp.x/ in the following
theorem.
THEOREM 1

If the nonhomogeneous equation y00 C P.x/y0 C Q.x/y D f .x/ has complemen-

where W D W.y1; y2/ is the Wronskian of the two independent solutions y1 and
y2 of the associated homogeneous equation.
Example 11
Find a particular solution of the equation y00 C y D tan x.
Solution
The complementary function is yc.x/ D c1 cos x C c2 sin x, and we could simply substitute
directly in Eq. (33). But it is more instructive to set up the equations in (31) and solve for u0
1
and u0
2, so we begin with
y1 D cos x;
y2 D sin x;
y0
1 D  sin x;
y0

Hence the equations in (31) are

We easily solve these equations for

The variation of parameters formula in (33) is especially amenable to implementa-
tion in a computer algebra system when the indicated integrals would be too tedious
or inconvenient for manual evaluation. For example, suppose that we want to ﬁnd a
particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation
y00 C y D tan x
of Example 11, with complementary function yc.x/ D c1 cos x C c2 sin x. Then the
Maple commands
y1 := cos(x):

f := tan(x):
W := y1*diff(y2,x) -- y2*diff(y1,x):
W := simplify(W):
yp := --y1*int(y2*f/W,x) + y2*int(y1*f/W,x):

3.6 Forced Oscillations and Resonance
In Section 3.4 we derived the differential equation
mx00 C cx0 C kx D F.t/
(1)
that governs the one-dimensional motion of a mass m that is attached to a spring
(with constant k) and a dashpot (with constant c) and is also acted on by an external
force F.t/. Machines with rotating components commonly involve mass-spring
systems (or their equivalents) in which the external force is simple harmonic:
F.t/ D F0 cos !t
or
F.t/ D F0 sin !t;
(2)
where the constant F0 is the amplitude of the periodic force and ! is its circular
frequency.
For an example of how a rotating machine component can provide a sim-
ple harmonic force, consider the cart with a rotating vertical ﬂywheel shown in
Fig. 3.6.1. The cart has mass m  m0, not including the ﬂywheel of mass m0. The
centroid of the ﬂywheel is off center at a distance a from its center, and its angular
speed is ! radians per second. The cart is attached to a spring (with constant k)

as shown. Assume that the centroid of the cart itself is directly beneath the center
of the ﬂywheel, and denote by x.t/ its displacement from its equilibrium position
(where the spring is unstretched). Figure 3.6.1 helps us to see that the displacement
x of the centroid of the combined cart plus ﬂywheel is given by
x D .m  m0/x C m0.x C a cos !t/
m
D x C m0a
m cos !t:
Let us ignore friction and apply Newton’s second law mx00 D kx, because the
force exerted by the spring is kx. We substitute for x in the last equation to obtain
mx00  m0a!2 cos !t D kxI

198
Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
that is,
mx00 C kx D m0a!2 cos !t:
(3)
Thus the cart with its rotating ﬂywheel acts like a mass on a spring under the in-
ﬂuence of a simple harmonic external force with amplitude F0 D m0a!2. Such a
system is a reasonable model of a front-loading washing machine with the clothes
being washed loaded off center. This illustrates the practical importance of analyz-
ing solutions of Eq. (1) with external forces as in (2).
Undamped Forced Oscillations
To study undamped oscillations under the inﬂuence of the external force F.t/ D
F0 cos !t, we set c D 0 in Eq. (1), and thereby begin with the equation
mx00 C kx D F0 cos !t
(4)
whose complementary function is xc D c1 cos !0t C c2 sin !0t. Here
!0 D
r
k
m
(as in Eq. (9) of Section 3.4) is the (circular) natural frequency of the mass–spring
system. The fact that the angle !0t is measured in (dimensionless) radians reminds
us that if t is measured in seconds (s), then !0 is measured in radians per second—
that is, in inverse seconds (s1). Also recall from Eq. (14) in Section 3.4 that di-
vision of a circular frequency ! by the number 2 of radians in a cycle gives the
corresponding (ordinary) frequency  D !=2 in Hz (hertz D cycles per second).
Let us assume initially that the external and natural frequencies are unequal:
! 6D !0. We substitute xp D A cos !t in Eq. (4) to ﬁnd a particular solution. (No
sine term is needed in xp because there is no term involving x0 on the left-hand side
in Eq. (4).) This gives
m!2A cos !t C kA cos !t D F0 cos !t;
so
A D
F0
k  m!2 D
F0=m
!2
0  !2 ;
(5)
and thus
xp.t/ D
F0=m
!2
0  !2 cos !t:
(6)
Therefore, the general solution x D xc C xp is given by
x.t/ D c1 cos !0t C c2 sin !0t C
F0=m
!2
0  !2 cos !t;
(7)
where the constants c1 and c2 are determined by the initial values x.0/ and x0.0/.
Equivalently, as in Eq. (12) of Section 3.4, we can rewrite Eq. (7) as
x.t/ D C cos.!0t  ˛/ C
F0=m
!2
0  !2 cos !t;
(8)
so we see that the resulting motion is a superposition of two oscillations, one with
natural circular frequency !0, the other with the frequency ! of the external force.

Find x.t/ if x.0/ D x0.0/ D 0.
Solution
Here the natural frequency !0 D 3 and the frequency ! D 5 of the external force are unequal,
as in the preceding discussion. First we substitute xp D A cos 5t in the differential equation
and ﬁnd that 25A C 9A D 80, so that A D 5. Thus a particular solution is
xp.t/ D 5 cos 5t:

increase without bound (as ! ! !0) in the amplitude of oscillations of an undamped
system with natural frequency !0 in response to an external force with frequency

We have been assuming that ! ¤ !0. What sort of catastrophe should one
expect if ! and !0 are precisely equal? Then Eq. (4), upon division of each term by
m, becomes
x00 C !2

(13)
Because cos !0t is a term of the complementary function, the method of undeter-
mined coefﬁcients calls for us to try

We substitute this in Eq. (13) and thereby ﬁnd that A D 0 and B D F0=.2m!0/.

as reinforcement of the natural vibrations of the system by externally impressed

3.6 Forced Oscillations and Resonance

Example 3
Suppose that m D 5 kg and k D 500 N=m in the cart with the ﬂywheel of Fig. 3.6.1. Then
the natural frequency is !0 D
p
k=m D 10 rad=s; that is, 10=.2/  1:59 Hz. We would
therefore expect oscillations of very large amplitude to occur if the ﬂywheel revolves at about
.1:59/.60/  95 revolutions per minute (rpm).
In practice, a mechanical system with very little damping can be destroyed by
resonance vibrations. A spectacular example can occur when a column of soldiers
marches in step over a bridge. Any complicated structure such as a bridge has many
natural frequencies of vibration. If the frequency of the soldiers’ cadence is approx-
imately equal to one of the natural frequencies of the structure, then—just as in our
simple example of a mass on a spring—resonance will occur. Indeed, the resulting
resonance vibrations can be of such large amplitude that the bridge will collapse.
This has actually happened—for example, the collapse of Broughton Bridge near
Manchester, England, in 1831—and it is the reason for the now-standard practice
of breaking cadence when crossing a bridge. Resonance may have been involved
in the 1981 Kansas City disaster in which a hotel balcony (called a skywalk) col-
lapsed with dancers on it. The collapse of a building in an earthquake is sometimes
due to resonance vibrations caused by the ground oscillating at one of the natural
frequencies of the structure; this happened to many buildings in the Mexico City
earthquake of September 19, 1985. On occasion an airplane has crashed because of
resonant wing oscillations caused by vibrations of the engines. It is reported that
for some of the ﬁrst commercial jet aircraft, the natural frequency of the vertical
vibrations of the airplane during turbulence was almost exactly that of the mass–
spring system consisting of the pilot’s head (mass) and spine (spring). Resonance
occurred, causing pilots to have difﬁculty in reading the instruments. Large modern
commercial jets have different natural frequencies, so that this resonance problem
no longer occurs.
Modeling Mechanical Systems
The avoidance of destructive resonance vibrations is an ever-present consideration
in the design of mechanical structures and systems of all types. Often the most
important step in determining the natural frequency of vibration of a system is the
formulation of its differential equation. In addition to Newton’s law F D ma, the
principle of conservation of energy is sometimes useful for this purpose (as in the
derivation of the pendulum equation in Section 3.4). The following kinetic and
potential energy formulas are often useful.
1. Kinetic energy: T D 1
2mv2 for translation of a mass m with velocity v;
2. Kinetic energy: T D 1
2I!2 for rotation of a body of a moment of inertia I
with angular velocity !;
3. Potential energy: V D 1
2kx2 for a spring with constant k stretched or com-
pressed a distance x;
4. Potential energy: V D mgh for the gravitational potential energy of a mass m
at height h above the reference level (the level at which V D 0), provided that
g may be regarded as essentially constant.

Find the natural frequency of a mass m on a spring with constant k if, instead of sliding

Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
where E is a constant (the total mechanical energy of the system). We note that v D a! and
recall that I D ma2=2 for a uniform circular disk. Then we may simplify the last equation to

4mv2 C 1
2kx2 D E:
Because the right-hand side of this equation is constant, differentiation with respect to t (with
v D x0 and v0 D x00) now gives

We divide each term by 3

Thus the natural frequency of horizontal back-and-forth oscillation of our rolling disk is
p
2k=3m, which is
p
2=3  0:8165 times the familiar natural frequency
p
k=m of a mass
on a spring that is sliding without friction rather than rolling without sliding. It is interesting
(and perhaps surprising) that this natural frequency does not depend on the radius of the disk.
It could be either a dime or a large disk with a radius of one meter (but of the same mass).
Example 5
Suppose that a car oscillates vertically as if it were a mass m D 800 kg on a single spring (with
constant k D 7  104 N=m), attached to a single dashpot (with constant c D 3000 Ns=m).
Suppose that this car with the dashpot disconnected is driven along a washboard road surface
with an amplitude of 5 cm and a wavelength of L D 10 m (Fig. 3.6.6). At what car speed will

The “unicycle

Solution
We think of the car as a unicycle, as pictured in Fig. 3.6.7. Let x.t/ denote the upward
displacement of the mass m from its equilibrium position; we ignore the force of gravity,
because it merely displaces the equilibrium position as in Problem 9 of Section 3.4. We write
the equation of the road surface as
y D a cos 2s
L
(a D 0:05 m, L D 10 m).
(15)
When the car is in motion, the spring is stretched by the amount x  y, so Newton’s second
law, F D ma, gives
mx00 D k.x  y/I
that is,
mx00 C kx D ky:

Damped Forced Oscillations
In real physical systems there is always some damping, from frictional effects if
nothing else. The complementary function xc of the equation
mx00 C cx0 C kx D F0 cos !t
(17)
is given by Eq. (19), (20), or (21) of Section 3.4, depending on whether c > ccr D
p
4km, c D ccr, or c < ccr. The speciﬁc form is not important here. What is important
is that, in any case, these formulas show that xc.t/ ! 0 as t ! C1. Thus xc is a
transient solution of Eq. (17)—one that dies out with the passage of time, leaving
only the particular solution xp.
The method of undetermined coefﬁcients indicates that we should substitute
x.t/ D A cos !t C B sin !t
in Eq. (17). When we do this, collect terms, and equate coefﬁcients of cos !t and
sin !t, we obtain the two equations
.k  m!2/A C c!B D F0;
c!A C .k  m!2/B D 0
(18)
that we solve without difﬁculty for
A D
.k  m!2/F0
.k  m!2/2 C .c!/2 ;
B D

.k  m!2/2 C .c!/2 :
(19)
If we write
A cos !t C B sin !t D C.cos !t cos ˛ C sin !t sin ˛/ D C cos.!t  ˛/
as usual, we see that the resulting steady periodic oscillation

Note that if c > 0, then the “forced amplitude”—deﬁned as a function C.!/ by
(21)—always remains ﬁnite, in contrast with the case of resonance in the undamped
case when the forcing frequency ! equals the critical frequency !0 D
p
k=m. But
the forced amplitude may attain a maximum for some value of !, in which case we
speak of practical resonance. To see if and when practical resonance occurs, we
need only graph C as a function of ! and look for a global maximum. It can be
shown (Problem 27) that C is a steadily decreasing function of ! if c =
p
2km. But
if c <
p
2km, then the amplitude of C attains a maximum value—and so practical
resonance occurs—at some value of ! less than !0, and then approaches zero as
! ! C1. It follows that an underdamped system typically will undergo forced
oscillations whose amplitude is

Large if ! is close to the critical resonance frequency;

Close to F0=k if ! is very small;

Very small if ! is very large.
Example 6
Find the transient motion and steady periodic oscillations of a damped mass-and-spring sys-
tem with m D 1, c D 2, and k D 26 under the inﬂuence of an external force F.t/ D 82 cos 4t
with x.0/ D 6 and x0.0/ D 0. Also investigate the possibility of practical resonance for this
system.
Solution
The resulting motion x.t/ D xtr.t/ C xsp.t/ of the mass satisﬁes the initial value problem
x00 C 2x0 C 26x D 82 cos 4tI
x.0/ D 6,
x0.0/ D 0.
(23)
Instead of applying the general formulas derived earlier in this section, it is better in a concrete
problem to work it directly. The roots of the characteristic equation
r2 C 2r C 26 D .r C 1/2 C 25 D 0
are r D 1 ˙ 5i, so the complementary function is
xc.t/ D et.c1 cos 5t C c2 sin 5t/:
When we substitute the trial solution
x.t/ D A cos 4t C B sin 4t
in the given equation, collect like terms, and equate coefﬁcients of cos 4t and sin 4t, we get
the equations
10A C 8B D 82,
8A C 10B D 0
with solution A D 5, B D 4. Hence the general solution of the equation in (23) is
x.t/ D et.c1 cos 5t C c2 sin 5t/ C 5 cos 4t C 4 sin 4t:
At this point we impose the initial conditions x.0/ D 6, x0.0/ D 0 and ﬁnd that c1 D 1 and
c2 D 3. Therefore, the transient motion and the steady periodic oscillation of the mass are
given by
xtr.t/ D et.cos 5t  3 sin 5t/

clearly what it means for the transient solution xtr.t/ to “die out with the passage of time,”
leaving only the steady periodic motion xsp.t/. Indeed, because xtr.t/ ! 0 exponentially,
within a very few cycles the full solution x.t/ and the steady periodic solution xsp.t/ are
virtually indistinguishable (whatever the initial position x0).

Automobile Vibrations
Problems 29 and 30 deal further with the car of Example

Its upward displacement function satisﬁes the equation
mx00 C cx0 C kx D cy0 C ky when the shock absorber is con-

this differential equation becomes

C.!/ using the numerical data given in Example 5 (in-
cluding c D 3000 Ns=m). It indicates that, as the car
accelerates gradually from rest, it initially oscillates with
amplitude slightly over 5 cm. Maximum resonance vibra-

To simplify the notation, let’s take m D p2, c D 2p, and k D p2q2 C 1, where p > 0

with several illustrative possibilities for the external force F.t/. For your personal

An inductor with an inductance of L henries, and
A capacitor with a capacitance of C farads
in series with a source of electromotive force (such as a battery or a generator)
that supplies a voltage of E.t/ volts at time t. If the switch shown in the circuit
of Fig. 3.7.1 is closed, this results in a current of I.t/ amperes in the circuit and
a charge of Q.t/ coulombs on the capacitor at time t. The relation between the
functions Q and I is

Kirchhoff’s laws:
The (algebraic) sum of the voltage drops across the elements in a

Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
If we substitute (1) in Eq. (2), we get the second-order linear differential equation
LQ00 C RQ0 C 1
C Q D E.t/
(3)
for the charge Q.t/, under the assumption that the voltage E.t/ is known.
In most practical problems it is the current I rather than the charge Q that is
of primary interest, so we differentiate both sides of Eq. (3) and substitute I for Q0
to obtain
LI 00 C RI 0 C 1
C I D E0.t/:
(4)
We do not assume here a prior familiarity with electrical circuits. It sufﬁces to
regard the resistor, inductor, and capacitor in an electrical circuit as “black boxes”
that are calibrated by the constants R, L, and C. A battery or generator is described
by the voltage E.t/ that it supplies. When the switch is open, no current ﬂows in the
circuit; when the switch is closed, there is a current I.t/ in the circuit and a charge
Q.t/ on the capacitor. All we need to know about these constants and functions is
that they satisfy Eqs. (1) through (4), our mathematical model for the RLC circuit.
We can then learn a good deal about electricity by studying this mathematical model.
The Mechanical–Electrical Analogy
It is striking that Eqs. (3) and (4) have precisely the same form as the equation
mx00 C cx0 C kx D F.t/
(5)
of a mass–spring–dashpot system with external force F.t/. The table in Fig. 3.7.3
details this important mechanical–electrical analogy. As a consequence, most of
the results derived in Section 3.6 for mechanical systems can be applied at once to
electrical circuits. The fact that the same differential equation serves as a mathemat-
ical model for such different physical systems is a powerful illustration of the unify-
ing role of mathematics in the investigation of natural phenomena. More concretely,
the correspondences in Fig. 3.7.3 can be used to construct an electrical model of a
given mechanical system, using inexpensive and readily available circuit elements.
The performance of the mechanical system can then be predicted by means of ac-
curate but simple measurements in the electrical model. This is especially useful
when the actual mechanical system would be expensive to construct or when mea-
surements of displacements and velocities would be inconvenient, inaccurate, or
even dangerous. This idea is the basis of analog computers—electrical models of
mechanical systems. Analog computers modeled the ﬁrst nuclear reactors for com-
mercial power and submarine propulsion before the reactors themselves were built.

In the typical case of an alternating current voltage E.t/ D E0 sin !t, Eq. (4)
takes the form
LI 00 C RI 0 C 1
C I D !E0 cos !t:
(6)
As in a mass–spring–dashpot system with a simple harmonic external force, the
solution of Eq. (6) is the sum of a transient current Itr that approaches zero as
t ! C1 (under the assumption that the coefﬁcients in Eq. (6) are all positive,
so the roots of the characteristic equation have negative real parts), and a steady
periodic current Isp; thus
I D Itr C Isp:
(7)
Recall from Section 3.6 (Eqs. (19) through (22) there) that the steady periodic solu-
tion of Eq. (5) with F.t/ D F0 cos !t is

This ﬁnally gives the time lag ı=! (in seconds) of the steady periodic current Isp

Initial Value Problems
When we want to ﬁnd the transient current, we are usually given the initial values
I.0/ and Q.0/. So we must ﬁrst ﬁnd I 0.0/. To do so, we substitute t D 0 in Eq. (2)
to obtain the equation
LI 0.0/ C RI.0/ C 1
C Q.0/ D E.0/
(16)
to determine I 0.0/ in terms of the initial values of current, charge, and voltage.
Example 1
Consider an RLC circuit with R D 50 ohms (), L D 0:1 henry (H), and C D 5  104 farad
(F). At time t D 0, when both I.0/ and Q.0/ are zero, the circuit is connected to a 110-V,
60-Hz alternating current generator. Find the current in the circuit and the time lag of the
steady periodic current behind the voltage.
Solution
A frequency of 60 Hz means that ! D .2/.60/ rad=s, approximately 377 rad=s. So we take
E.t/ D 110 sin 377t and use equality in place of the symbol for approximate equality in this
discussion. The differential equation in (6) takes the form
.0:1/I 00 C 50I 0 C 2000I D .377/.110/ cos 377t:
We substitute the given values of R, L, C, and ! D 377 in Eq. (10) to ﬁnd that the impedance
is Z D 59:58 , so the steady periodic amplitude is
I0 D
110 (volts)
59.58 (ohms) D 1.846 amperes (A):

3.7 Electrical Circuits

With the same data, Eq. (15) gives the sine phase angle:
ı D tan1.0:648/ D 0:575:
Thus the time lag of current behind voltage is
ı
! D 0:575
377 D 0.0015 s;
and the steady periodic current is
Isp D .1:846/ sin.377t  0:575/:
The characteristic equation .0:1/r2 C 50r C 2000 D 0 has the two roots r1  44 and
r2  456. With these approximations, the general solution is
I.t/ D c1e44t C c2e456t C .1:846/ sin.377t  0:575/;
with derivative
I 0.t/ D 44c1e44t  456c2e456t C 696 cos.377t  0:575/:
Because I.0/ D Q.0/ D 0, Eq. (16) gives I 0.0/ D 0 as well. With these initial values substi-
tuted, we obtain the equations
I.0/ D c1 C c2  1:004 D 0;
I 0.0/ D 44c1  456c2 C 584 D 0I
their solution is c1 D 0:307, c2 D 1:311. Thus the transient solution is
Itr.t/ D .0:307/e44t C .1:311/e456t:
The observation that after one-ﬁfth of a second we have jItr.0:2/j < 0:000047 A (comparable
to the current in a single human nerve ﬁber) indicates that the transient solution dies out very
rapidly, indeed.
Example 2
Suppose that the RLC circuit of Example 1, still with I.0/ D Q.0/ D 0, is connected at time
t D 0 to a battery supplying a constant 110 V. Now ﬁnd the current in the circuit.
Solution
We now have E.t/  110, so Eq. (16) gives
I 0.0/ D E.0/

0:1 D 1100 (A/s);
and the differential equation is
.0:1/I 00 C 50I 0 C 2000I D E0.t/ D 0:
Its general solution is the complementary function we found in Example 1:
I.t/ D c1e44t C c2e456t:
We solve the equations
I.0/ D c1 C c2 D 0;
I 0.0/ D 44c1  456c2 D 1100
for c1 D c2 D 2:670. Therefore,

Note that I.t/ ! 0 as t ! C1 even though the voltage is constant.

The effect of
frequency on I0.
In Section 3.6 we emphasized the importance of avoiding resonance in most
mechanical systems (the cello is an example of a mechanical system in which reso-
nance is sought). By contrast, many common electrical devices could not function
properly without taking advantage of the phenomenon of resonance. The radio is a
familiar example. A highly simpliﬁed model of its tuning circuit is the RLC circuit
we have discussed. Its inductance L and resistance R are constant, but its capaci-
tance C is varied as one operates the tuning dial.
Suppose that we wanted to pick up a particular radio station that is broad-
casting at frequency !, and thereby (in effect) provides an input voltage E.t/ D
E0 sin !t to the tuning circuit of the radio. The resulting steady periodic current Isp
in the tuning circuit drives its ampliﬁer, and in turn its loudspeaker, with the volume
of sound we hear roughly proportional to the amplitude I0 of Isp. To hear our pre-
ferred station (of frequency !) the loudest—and simultaneously tune out stations
broadcasting at other frequencies—we therefore want to choose C to maximize I0.
But examine Eq. (17), thinking of ! as a constant with C the only variable. We see
at a glance—no calculus required—that I0 is maximal when
!L 

!C D 0I
that is, when
C D

L!2 :
(18)
So we merely turn the dial to set the capacitance to this value.
This is the way that old crystal radios worked, but modern AM radios have
a more sophisticated design. A pair of variable capacitors are used. The ﬁrst con-
trols the frequency selected as described earlier; the second controls the frequency
of a signal that the radio itself generates, kept close to 455 kilohertz (kHz) above
the desired frequency. The resulting beat frequency of 455 kHz, known as the in-
termediate frequency, is then ampliﬁed in several stages. This technique has the
advantage that the several RLC circuits used in the ampliﬁcation stages easily can
be designed to resonate at 455 kHz and reject other frequencies, resulting in far more
selectivity of the receiver as well as better ampliﬁcation of the desired signal.

3.8 Endpoint Problems and Eigenvalues
You are now familiar with the fact that a solution of a second-order linear differential
equation is uniquely determined by two initial conditions. In particular, the only
solution of the initial value problem
y00 C p.x/y0 C q.x/y D 0I
y.a/ D 0;
y0.a/ D 0
(1)
is the trivial solution y.x/  0. Most of Chapter 3 has been based, directly or indi-
rectly, on the uniqueness of solutions of linear initial value problems (as guaranteed
by Theorem 2 of Section 3.2).
In this section we will see that the situation is radically different for a problem
such as
y00 C p.x/y0 C q.x/y D 0I
y.a/ D 0;
y.b/ D 0:
(2)
The difference between the problems in Eqs. (1) and (2) is that in (2) the two con-
ditions are imposed at two different points a and b with (say) a < b. In (2) we are
to ﬁnd a solution of the differential equation on the interval .a; b/ that satisﬁes the
conditions y.a/ D 0 and y.b/ D 0 at the endpoints of the interval. Such a problem
is called an endpoint or boundary value problem. Examples 1 and 2 illustrate the
sorts of complications that can arise in endpoint problems.
Example 1
Consider the endpoint problem
y00 C 3y D 0I
y.0/ D 0;
y./ D 0:
(3)
The general solution of the differential equation is
y.x/ D A cos x
p
3 C B sin x
p
3:
Now y.0/ D A, so the condition y.0/ D 0 implies that A D 0. Therefore the only possible
solutions are of the form y.x/ D B sin x
p
3. But then
y./ D B sin 
p
3  0:7458B;
so the other condition y./ D 0 requires that B D 0 also. Graphically, Fig. 3.8.1 illustrates
the fact that no possible solution y.x/ D B sin x
p
3 with B 6D 0 hits the desired target value
y D 0 when x D . Thus the only solution of the endpoint value problem in (3) is the trivial
solution y.x/  0 (which probably is no surprise).

3.8 Endpoint Problems and Eigenvalues
217
Example 2
Consider the endpoint problem
y00 C 4y D 0I
y.0/ D 0;
y./ D 0:
(4)
The general solution of the differential equation is
y.x/ D A cos 2x C B sin 2x:
Again, y.0/ D A, so the condition y.0/ D 0 implies that A D 0. Therefore the only possible
solutions are of the form y.x/ D B sin 2x. But now y./ D B sin 2 D 0 no matter what the
value of the coefﬁcient B is. Hence, as illustrated graphically in Fig. 3.8.2, every possible
solution y.x/ D B sin 2x hits automatically the desired target value y D 0 when x D  (what-
ever the value of B). Thus the endpoint value problem in (4) has inﬁnitely many different
nontrivial solutions. Perhaps this does seem a bit surprising.
Remark 1
Note that the big difference in the results of Examples 1 and 2 stems from
the seemingly small difference between the differential equations in (3) and (4), with the
coefﬁcient 3 in one replaced by the coefﬁcient 4 in the other. In mathematics as elsewhere,

sometimes “big doors turn on small hinges.”
Remark 2
The “shooting” terminology used in Examples 1 and 2 is often useful in dis-
cussing endpoint value problems. We consider a possible solution which starts at the left
endpoint value and ask whether it hits the “target” speciﬁed by the right endpoint value.
Eigenvalue Problems
Rather than being the exceptional cases, Examples 1 and 2 illustrate the typical
situation for an endpoint problem as in (2): It may have no nontrivial solutions, or
it may have inﬁnitely many nontrivial solutions. Note that the problems in (3) and
(4) can both be written in the form
y00 C p.x/y0 C q.x/y D 0I
y.a/ D 0;
y.b/ D 0;
(5)
with p.x/  0, q.x/  1, a D 0, and b D . The number  is a parameter in the
problem (nothing to do with the parameters that were varied in Section 3.5). If we
take  D 3, we get the equations in (3); with  D 4, we obtain the equations in
(4). Examples 1 and 2 show that the situation in an endpoint problem containing a
parameter can (and generally will) depend strongly on the speciﬁc numerical value
of the parameter.
An endpoint value problem such as the problem in (5)—one that contains an
unspeciﬁed parameter —is called an eigenvalue problem. The question we ask in
an eigenvalue problem is this: For what values of the parameter  does there exist
a nontrivial (i.e., nonzero) solution of the endpoint value problem? Such a value
of  is called an eigenvalue of the problem. One might think of such a value as a
“proper” value of  for which there exist proper (nonzero) solutions of the problem.
Indeed, the preﬁx eigen is a German word that (in some contexts) may be translated
as the English word proper, so eigenvalues are sometimes called proper values (or
characteristic values).
Thus we saw in Example 2 that  D 4 is an eigenvalue of the endpoint problem
y00 C y D 0;
y.0/ D 0;
y./ D 0;
(6)
whereas Example 1 shows that  D 3 is not an eigenvalue of this problem.
Suppose that ? is an eigenvalue of the problem in (5) and that y?.x/ is a
nontrivial solution of the endpoint problem that results when the parameter  in (5)
is replaced by the speciﬁc numerical value ?, so
y00
? C p.x/y0
? C ?q.x/y? D 0
and
y?.a/ D 0;
y?.b/ D 0:

218
Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
Then we call y? an eigenfunction associated with the eigenvalue ?. Thus we saw
in Example 2 that y?.x/ D sin 2x is an eigenfunction associated with the eigenvalue
? D 4, as is any constant multiple of sin 2x.
More generally, note that the problem in (5) is homogeneous in the sense that
any constant multiple of an eigenfunction is again an eigenfunction—indeed, one
associated with the same eigenvalue. That is, if y D y?.x/ satisﬁes the problem in
(5) with  D ?, then so does any constant multiple cy?.x/. It can be proved (under
mild restrictions on the coefﬁcient functions p and q) that any two eigenfunctions
associated with the same eigenvalue must be linearly dependent.
Example 3
Determine the eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions for the endpoint problem
y00 C y D 0I
y.0/ D 0;
y.L/ D 0
.L > 0/:
(7)
Solution
We must consider all possible (real) values of —positive, zero, and negative.
If  D 0, then the equation is simply y00 D 0 and its general solution is
y.x/ D Ax C B:
Then the endpoint conditions y.0/ D 0 D y.L/ immediately imply that A D B D 0, so the only
solution in this case is the trivial function y.x/  0. Therefore,  D 0 is not an eigenvalue of
the problem in (7).
If  < 0, let us then write  D ˛2 (with ˛ > 0) to be speciﬁc. Then the differential
equation takes the form
y00  ˛2y D 0;
and its general solution is
y.x/ D c1e˛x C c2e˛x D A cosh ˛x C B sinh ˛x;
where A D c1 C c2 and B D c1  c2. (Recall that cosh ˛x D .e˛x C e˛x/=2 and that

y.0/ D A cosh 0 C B sinh 0 D A D 0;
so that y.x/ D B sinh ˛x. But now the second endpoint condition, y.L/ D 0, gives y.L/ D
B sinh ˛L D 0. This implies that B D 0, because ˛ ¤ 0, and sinh x D 0 only for x D 0
(examine the graphs of y D sinh x and y D cosh x in Fig. 3.8.3.) Thus the only solution
of the problem in (7) in the case  < 0 is the trivial solution y  0, and we may therefore
conclude that the problem has no negative eigenvalues.
The only remaining possibility is that  D ˛2 > 0 with ˛ > 0. In this case the differential
equation is
y00 C ˛2y D 0;
with general solution
y.x/ D A cos ˛x C B sin ˛x:
The condition y.0/ D 0 implies that A D 0, so y.x/ D B sin ˛x. The condition y.L/ D 0 then
gives
y.L/ D B sin ˛L D 0:
Can this occur if B ¤ 0? Yes, but only provided that ˛L is a (positive) integral multiple of :

the endpoint conditions y.0/ D y.L/ D 0 serve to select just those sine functions that start a
period at x D 0 and wind up at x D L precisely at the end of a half-period.
Example 3 illustrates the general situation. According to a theorem whose
precise statement we will defer until Section 10.1, under the assumption that q.x/ >
0 on the interval Œa; b, any eigenvalue of the form in (5) has a divergent increasing
sequence
1 < 2 < 3 <    < n <    ! C1
of eigenvalues, each with an associated eigenfunction. This is also true of the fol-
lowing more general type of eigenvalue problem, in which the endpoint conditions
involve values of the derivative y0 as well as values of y:
y00 C p.x/y0 C q.x/y D 0I
a1y.a/ C a2y0.a/ D 0;
b1y.b/ C b2y0.b/ D 0;
(10)
where a1, a2, b1, and b2 are given constants. With a1 D 1 D b2 and a2 D 0 D b1, we
get the problem of Example 4 (in which p.x/  0 and q.x/  1, as in the previous
example).

Solution
Virtually the same argument as that used in Example 3 shows that the only possible eigenval-
ues are positive, so we take  D ˛2 > 0 (˛ > 0) to be speciﬁc. Then the differential equation
is
y00 C ˛2y D 0;
with general solution
y.x/ D A cos ˛x C B sin ˛x:
The condition y.0/ D 0 immediately gives A D 0, so
y.x/ D B sin ˛x
and
y0.x/ D B˛ cos ˛x:
The second endpoint condition y0.L/ D 0 now gives
y0.L/ D B˛ cos ˛L D 0:
This will hold with B ¤ 0 provided that ˛L is an odd positive integral multiple of =2:

Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
A general procedure for determining the eigenvalues of the problem in (10)
can be outlined as follows. We ﬁrst write the general solution of the differential
equation in the form
y D Ay1.x; / C By2.x; /:
We write yi.x; / because y1 and y2 will depend on , as in Examples 3 and 4, in
which
y1.x/ D cos ˛x D cos x
p

and
y2.x/ D sin ˛x D sin x
p
:
Then we impose the two endpoint conditions, noting that each is linear in y and y0,
and hence also linear in A and B. When we collect coefﬁcients of A and B in the
resulting pair of equations, we therefore get a system of the form
˛1./A C ˇ1./B D 0;
˛2./A C ˇ2./B D 0:
(13)
Now  is an eigenvalue if and only if the system in (13) has a nontrivial solution (one
with A and B not both zero). But such a homogeneous system of linear equations
has a nontrivial solution if and only if the determinant of its coefﬁcients vanishes.
We therefore conclude that the eigenvalues of the problem in (10) are the (real)
solutions of the equation
D./ D ˛1./ˇ2./  ˛2./ˇ1./ D 0:
(14)
To illustrate Eq. (14) in a concrete problem, let’s revisit the eigenvalue prob-
lem of Example 3. If  > 0, then the differential equation y00 Cy D 0 has the general
solution y.x/ D A cos.

p

(as we saw in Example 3).
For more general problems, the solution of the equation D./ D 0 in (14) may
present formidable difﬁculties and require a numerical approximation method (such
as Newton’s method) or recourse to a computer algebra system.
Most of the interest in eigenvalue problems is due to their very diverse physi-
cal applications. The remainder of this section is devoted to three such applications.
Numerous additional applications are included in Chapters 9 and 10 (on partial dif-
ferential equations and boundary value problems).
The Whirling String
Who of us has not wondered about the shape of a quickly spinning jump rope? Let
us consider the shape assumed by a tightly stretched ﬂexible string of length L and
constant linear density  (mass per unit length) if it is rotated or whirled (like a jump
rope) with constant angular speed ! (in radians per second) around its equilibrium
position along the x-axis. We assume that the portion of the string to one side of
any point exerts a constant tension force T on the portion of the string to the other
side of the point, with the direction of T tangential to the string at that point. We

further assume that, as the string whirls around the x-axis, each point moves in a

circle centered at that point’s equilibrium position on the x-axis. Thus the string is
elastic, so that as it whirls it also stretches to assume a curved shape. Denote by
y.x/ the displacement of the string from the point x on the axis of rotation. Finally,
we assume that the deﬂection of the string is so slight that sin   tan  D y0.x/ in
Fig. 3.8.6(c).
We plan to derive a differential equation for y.x/ by application of Newton’s
law F D ma to the piece of string of mass  x corresponding to the interval Œx; x C
x. The only forces acting on this piece are the tension forces at its two ends. From
Fig. 3.8.7 we see that the net vertical force in the positive y-direction is
F D T sin. C /  T sin   T tan. C /  T tan ;
so that
F  Ty0.x C x/  Ty0.x/:
(15)
Next we recall from elementary calculus or physics the formula a D r!2 for the
(inward) centripetal acceleration of a body in uniform circular motion (r is the radius
of the circle and ! is the angular velocity of the body). Here we have r D y, so the
vertical acceleration of our piece of string is a D !2y, the minus sign because the
inward direction is the negative y-direction. Because m D  x, substitution of this
and (15) in F D ma yields

with the eigenfunction yn.x/ D sin.nx=L/ associated with n.
But what does all this mean in terms of the whirling string? It means that
unless  in (17) is one of the eigenvalues in (8), then the only solution of the problem
in (7) is the trivial solution y.x/  0. In this case the string remains in its equilibrium

these critical angular speeds can the string whirl up out of its equilibrium position.
At angular speed ! it assumes a shape of the form yn D cn sin.nx=L/ illustrated
in Fig. 3.8.4 (where cn  1). Our mathematical model is not sufﬁciently complete
(or realistic) to determine the coefﬁcient cn, but it assumes much smaller deﬂections
than those observed in Fig. 3.8.4, so the numerical value of cn would necessarily be
signiﬁcantly smaller than 1.
Suppose that we start the string rotating at speed

then gradually increase its speed of rotation. So long as ! < !1, the string remains

back into its undeﬂected position along the axis of rotation!
The Deﬂection of a Uniform Beam
We include now an example of the use of a relatively simple endpoint value problem
to explain a complicated physical phenomenon—the shape of a horizontal beam on
which a vertical force is acting.
Consider the horizontal beam shown in Fig. 3.8.8, uniform both in cross sec-
tion and in material. If it is supported only at its ends, then the force of its own

weight distorts its longitudinal axis of symmetry into the curve shown as a dashed
line in the ﬁgure. We want to investigate the shape y D y.x/ of this curve, the deﬂec-
tion curve of the beam. We will use the coordinate system indicated in Fig. 3.8.9,
with the positive y-axis directed downward.
A consequence of the theory of elasticity is that for relatively small deﬂections

of such a beam (so small that Œy0.x/2 is negligible in comparison with unity), an
adequate mathematical model of the deﬂection curve is the fourth-order differential
equation
EIy.4/ D F.x/;
(19)
where

E is a constant known as the Young’s modulus of the material of the beam,

I denotes the moment of inertia of the cross section of the beam around a
horizontal line through the centroid of the cross section, and

F.x/ denotes the density of downward force acting vertically on the beam at
the point x.
Density of force? Yes; this means that the force acting downward on a very
short segment Œx; x Cx of the beam is approximately F.x/ x. The units of F.x/
are those of force per unit length, such as pounds per foot. We will consider here the
case in which the only force distributed along the beam is its own weight, w pounds
per foot, so that F.x/  w. Then Eq. (19) takes the form
EIy.4/ D w
(20)
where E, I, and w are all constant.

3.8 Endpoint Problems and Eigenvalues
223
Note
We assume no previous familiarity with the theory of elasticity or with Eq. (19) or (20)
here. It is important to be able to begin with a differential equation that arises in a speciﬁc
applied discipline and then analyze its implications; thus we develop an understanding of
the equation by examining its solutions. Observe that, in essence, Eq. (20) implies that the
fourth derivative y.4/ is proportional to the weight density w. This proportionality involves,
however, two constants: E, which depends only on the material of the beam, and I, which
depends only on the shape of the cross section of the beam. Values of the Young’s modulus
E of various materials can be found in handbooks of physical constants; I D 1
4a4 for a
circular cross section of radius a.
Although Eq. (20) is a fourth-order differential equation, its solution involves
only the solution of simple ﬁrst-order equations by successive simple integrations.
One integration of Eq. (20) yields
EIy.3/ D wx C C1I
a second yields
EIy00 D 1
2wx2 C C1x C C2I
another yields
EIy0 D 1
6wx3 C 1
2C1x2 C C2x C C3I
a ﬁnal integration gives
EIy D
1
24wx4 C 1
6C1x3 C 1
2C2x2 C C3x C C4;
where C1, C2, C3, and C4 are arbitrary constants. Thus we obtain a solution of
Eq. (20) of the form
y.x/ D
w
24EI x4 C Ax3 C Bx2 C Cx C D;
(21)
where A, B, C, and D are constants resulting from the four integrations.
These last four constants are determined by the way in which the beam is sup-
ported at its ends, where x D 0 and x D L. Figure 3.8.10 shows two common types

the other end. For instance, Fig. 3.8.11 shows a cantilever—a beam ﬁrmly fastened
at x D 0 but free (no support whatsoever) at x D L. The following table shows the
boundary or endpoint conditions corresponding to the three most common cases.
We will see that these conditions are applied readily in beam problems, although a
discussion here of their origin would take us too far aﬁeld.

We have the endpoint conditions

Rather than imposing them directly on Eq. (21), let us begin with the differential equation

The ﬁrst two integrations yield

that ymax is proportional to L4, so if the rod were only 10 ft long, its maximum deﬂection
would be only one-sixteenth as much—only about 0:42 in. Because I D 1

Eq. (25) that the same reduction in maximum deﬂection could be achieved by doubling the
radius a of the rod.

“buckled” by an axial force of compression P applied at one end. We assume this
buckling to be so slight that the deﬂection curve y D y.x/ of the rod may be regarded
as deﬁned on the interval 0 5 x 5 L.
In the theory of elasticity the linear endpoint boundary value problem
EIy00 C Py D 0;
y.0/ D y.L/ D 0
(26)
is used to model the actual (nonlinear) behavior of the rod. As in our discussion of
the deﬂection of a uniform beam, E denotes the Young’s modulus of the material
of the beam and I denotes the moment of inertia of each cross section of the beam
around a horizontal line through its centroid.
If we write

(27)
then the problem in (26) becomes the eigenvalue problem

Chapter 3 Linear Equations of Higher Order
are the critical buckling forces of the rod. Only when the compressive force P is
one of these critical forces should the rod “buckle” out of its straight (undeﬂected)
shape. The smallest compressive force for which this occurs is
P1 D 2EI
L2
:
(29)
This smallest critical force P1 is called the Euler buckling force for the rod; it is the
upper bound for those compressive forces to which the rod can safely be subjected
without buckling. (In practice a rod may fail at a signiﬁcantly smaller force due to a
contribution of factors not taken into account by the mathematical model discussed
here.)
Example 7
For instance, suppose that we want to compute the Euler buckling force for a steel rod 10 ft
long having a circular cross section 1 in. in diameter. In cgs units we have

Introduction to
Systems of Differential
Equations
4.1 First-Order Systems and Applications
I
n the preceding chapters we have discussed methods for solving an ordinary dif-
ferential equation that involves only one dependent variable. Many applications,
however, require the use of two or more dependent variables, each a function of a
single independent variable (typically time). Such a problem leads naturally to a
system of simultaneous ordinary differential equations. We will usually denote the
independent variable by t and the dependent variables (the unknown functions of t)
by x1, x2, x3, : : : :or by x, y, ´, : : : : Primes will indicate derivatives with respect to
t.
We will restrict our attention to systems in which the number of equations is
the same as the number of dependent variables (unknown functions). For instance,
a system of two ﬁrst-order equations in the dependent variables x and y has the
general form
f .t; x; y; x0; y0/ D 0;
g.t; x; y; x0; y0/ D 0;
(1)
where the functions f and g are given. A solution of this system is a pair x.t/, y.t/
of functions of t that satisfy both equations identically over some interval of values
of t.
For an example of a second-order system, consider a particle of mass m that
moves in space under the inﬂuence of a force ﬁeld F that depends on time t, the po-
sition .x.t/; y.t/; ´.t// of the particle, and its velocity .x0.t/; y0.t/; ´0.t//. Applying
Newton’s law ma D F componentwise, we get the system
mx00 D F1.t; x; y; ´; x0; y0; ´0/;
my00 D F2.t; x; y; ´; x0; y0; ´0/;
m´00 D F3.t; x; y; ´; x0; y0; ´0/
(2)
of three second-order equations with independent variable t and dependent variables
x, y, ´; the three right-hand-side functions F1, F2, F3 are the components of the
vector-valued function F.
228

4.1 First-Order Systems and Applications
229
Initial Applications
Examples 1 through 3 further illustrate how systems of differential equations arise
naturally in scientiﬁc problems.
Example 1
Consider the system of two masses and two springs shown in Fig. 4.1.1, with a given external
force f .t/ acting on the right-hand mass m2. We denote by x.t/ the displacement (to the

right) of the mass m1 from its static equilibrium position (when the system is motionless and
in equilibrium and f .t/ D 0) and by y.t/ the displacement of the mass m2 from its static
position. Thus the two springs are neither stretched nor compressed when x and y are zero.
In the conﬁguration in Fig. 4.1.1, the ﬁrst spring is stretched x units and the second by
y  x units. We apply Newton’s law of motion to the two “free body diagrams” shown in
Fig. 4.1.2; we thereby obtain the system
m1x00 D k1x C k2.y  x/;
m2y00 D k2.y  x/ C f .t/
(3)
of differential equations that the position functions x.t/ and y.t/ must satisfy. For instance,
if m1 D 2, m2 D 1, k1 D 4, k2 D 2, and f .t/ D 40 sin 3t in appropriate physical units, then
the system in (3) reduces to
2x00 D 6x C 2y;
y00 D 2x  2y C 40 sin 3t:
(4)
Example 2
Consider two brine tanks connected as shown in Fig. 4.1.3. Tank 1 contains x.t/ pounds of
salt in 100 gal of brine and tank 2 contains y.t/ pounds of salt in 200 gal of brine. The brine in
each tank is kept uniform by stirring, and brine is pumped from each tank to the other at the
rates indicated in Fig. 4.1.3. In addition, fresh water ﬂows into tank 1 at 20 gal=min, and the
brine in tank 2 ﬂows out at 20 gal=min (so the total volume of brine in the two tanks remains
20 gal/min

constant). The salt concentrations in the two tanks are x=100 pounds per gallon and y=200
pounds per gallon, respectively. When we compute the rates of change of the amount of salt
in the two tanks, we therefore get the system of differential equations that x.t/ and y.t/ must
satisfy:

that is,

Example 3
Consider the electrical network shown in Fig. 4.1.4, where I1.t/ denotes the current in the
indicated direction through the inductor L and I2.t/ denotes the current through the resistor
R2. The current through the resistor R1 is I D I1  I2 in the direction indicated. We recall
Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the effect that the (algebraic) sum of the voltage drops around
any closed loop of such a network is zero. As in Section 3.7, the voltage drops across the
three types of circuit elements are those shown in Fig. 4.1.5. We apply Kirchhoff’s law to the
left-hand loop of the network to obtain
2dI1
dt C 50.I1  I2/  100 D 0;
(6)
because the voltage drop from the negative to the positive pole of the battery is 100. The
right-hand loop yields the equation

First-Order Systems
Consider a system of differential equations that can be solved for the highest-order
derivatives of the dependent variables that appear, as explicit functions of t and
lower-order derivatives of the dependent variables. For instance, in the case of a
system of two second-order equations, our assumption is that it can be written in the
form
x00
1 D f1.t; x1; x2; x0
1; x0
2/;
x00
2 D f2.t; x1; x2; x0
1; x0
2/:
(10)
It is of both practical and theoretical importance that any such higher-order system
can be transformed into an equivalent system of ﬁrst-order equations.
To describe how such a transformation is accomplished, we consider ﬁrst the
“system” consisting of the single nth-order equation
x.n/ D f .t; x; x0; : : : ; x.n1//:
(11)
We introduce the dependent variables x1, x2, : : : ; xn deﬁned as follows:
x1 D x;
x2 D x0;
x3 D x00;
: : : ;
xn D x.n1/:
(12)
Note that x0
1 D x0 D x2, x0
2 D x00 D x3, and so on. Hence the substitution of (12) in
Eq. (11) yields the system
x0
1 D x2;
x0
2 D x3;
:::
x0
n1 D xn;
x0
n D f .t; x1; x2; : : : ; xn/
(13)

4.1 First-Order Systems and Applications
231
of n ﬁrst-order equations. Evidently, this system is equivalent to the original nth-
order equation in (11), in the sense that x.t/ is a solution of Eq. (11) if and only if
the functions x1.t/, x2.t/, : : : ; xn.t/ deﬁned in (12) satisfy the system of equations
in (13).
Example 4
The third-order equation
x.3/ C 3x00 C 2x0  5x D sin 2t
is of the form in (11) with
f .t; x; x0; x00/ D 5x  2x0  3x00 C sin 2t:
Hence the substitutions
x1 D x;
x2 D x0 D x0
1;
x3 D x00 D x0
2
yield the system
x0
1 D x2;
x0
2 D x3;
x0
3 D 5x1  2x2  3x3 C sin 2t
of three ﬁrst-order equations.
It may appear that the ﬁrst-order system obtained in Example 4 offers little
advantage because we could use the methods of Chapter 3 to solve the original (lin-
ear) third-order equation. But suppose that we were confronted with the nonlinear
equation
x00 D x3 C .x0/3;
to which none of our earlier methods can be applied. The corresponding ﬁrst-order
system is
x0
1 D x2;
x0
2 D .x1/3 C .x2/3;
(14)
and we will see in Section 4.3 that there exist effective numerical techniques for
approximating the solution of essentially any ﬁrst-order system. So in this case the
transformation to a ﬁrst-order system is advantageous. From a practical viewpoint,
large systems of higher-order differential equations typically are solved numerically
with the aid of the computer, and the ﬁrst step is to transform such a system into a
ﬁrst-order system for which a standard computer program is available.
Example 5
The system
2x00 D 6x C 2y,
y00 D
2x  2y C 40 sin 3t
(4)
of second-order equations was derived in Example 1. Transform this system into an equiva-
lent ﬁrst-order system.
Solution
Motivated by the equations in (12), we deﬁne
x1 D x;
x2 D x0 D x0
1;
y1 D y;
y2 D y0 D y0
1:
Then the system in (4) yields the system
x0
1 D x2;
2x0
2 D 6x1 C 2y1;
y0
1 D y2;
y0
2 D 2x1  2y1 C 40 sin 3t
(15)
of four ﬁrst-order equations in the dependent variables x1, x2, y1, and y2.

Chapter 4 Introduction to Systems of Differential Equations
Simple Two-Dimensional Systems
The linear second-order differential equation
x00 C px0 C qx D 0

(with constant coefﬁcients and independent variable t) transforms via the substitu-
tions x0 D y, x00 D y0 into the two-dimensional linear system
x0 D y;
y0 D qx  py:
(17)
Conversely, we can solve this system in (17) by solving the familiar single equation
in (16).

A solution .x.t/; y.t// of a two-dimensional system
x0 D f .t; x; y/;
y0 D g.t; x; y/
may be regarded as a parametrization of a solution curve or trajectory of the sys-
tem in the xy-plane. Thus the trajectories of the system in (18) are the ellipses of
Fig. 4.1.6. The choice of an initial point .x.0/; y.0// determines which one of these
trajectories a particular solution parametrizes.
The picture showing a system’s trajectories in the xy-plane—its so-called
phase plane portrait—fails to reveal precisely how the point .x.t/; y.t// moves
along its trajectory. If the functions f and g do not involve the independent variable
t, then a direction ﬁeld—showing typical arrows representing vectors with compo-
nents (proportional to) the derivatives x0 D f .x; y/ and y0 D g.x; y/—can be plotted.
Because the moving point .x.t/; y.t// has velocity vector .x0.t/; y0.t//, this direc-
tion ﬁeld indicates the point’s direction of motion along its trajectory. For instance,
the direction ﬁeld plotted in Fig. 4.1.6 indicates that each such point moves coun-
terclockwise around its elliptical trajectory. Additional information can be shown
in the separate graphs of x.t/ and y.t/ as functions of t.

When we study linear systems in Chapter 5, we will learn why the superﬁcially
similar systems in Examples 6 through 8 have the markedly different trajectories
shown in Figs. 4.1.6, 4.1.8, and 4.1.9.
Linear Systems
In addition to practical advantages for numerical computation, the general theory of
systems and systematic solution techniques are more easily and more concisely de-
scribed for ﬁrst-order systems than for higher-order systems. For instance, consider
a linear ﬁrst-order system of the form
x0
1 D p11.t/x1 C p12.t/x2 C    C p1nxn C f1.t/;
x0
2 D p21.t/x1 C p22.t/x2 C    C p2nxn C f2.t/;
:::
x0
n D pn1.t/x1 C pn2.t/x2 C    C pnnxn C fn.t/:
(24)
We say that this system is homogeneous if the functions f1; f2; : : : ; fn are all iden-
tically zero; otherwise, it is nonhomogeneous. Thus the linear system in (5) is
homogeneous, whereas the linear system in (15) is nonhomogeneous. The system
in (14) is nonlinear because the right-hand side of the second equation is not a linear
function of the dependent variables x1 and x2.

4.1 First-Order Systems and Applications
235
A solution of the system in (24) is an n-tuple of functions x1.t/; x2.t/; : : : ;
xn.t/ that (on some interval) identically satisfy each of the equations in (24). We
will see that the general theory of a system of n linear ﬁrst-order equations shares
many similarities with the general theory of a single nth-order linear differential
equation. Theorem 1 (proved in the Appendix) is analogous to Theorem 2 of Section
3.2. It tells us that if the coefﬁcient functions pij and fj in (24) are continuous, then
the system has a unique solution satisfying given initial conditions.
THEOREM 1
Existence and Uniqueness for Linear Systems
Suppose that the functions p11; p12; : : : ; pnn and the functions f1; f2; : : : ; fn are
continuous on the open interval I containing the point a. Then, given the n
numbers b1; b2; : : : ; bn, the system in (24) has a unique solution on the entire
interval I that satisﬁes the n initial conditions
x1.a/ D b1;
x2.a/ D b2;
: : : ;
xn.a/ D bn:
(25)
Thus n initial conditions are needed to determine a solution of a system of
n linear ﬁrst-order equations, and we therefore expect a general solution of such a
system to involve n arbitrary constants. For instance, we saw in Example 5 that the
second-order linear system
2x00 D  6x C 2y,
y00 D
2x  2y C 40 sin 3t;
which describes the position functions x.t/ and y.t/ of Example 1, is equivalent to
the system of four ﬁrst-order linear equations in (15). Hence four initial conditions
would be needed to determine the subsequent motions of the two masses in Example
1. Typical initial values would be the initial positions x.0/ and y.0/ and the initial
velocities x0.0/ and y0.0/. On the other hand, we found that the amounts x.t/ and
y.t/ of salt in the two tanks of Example 2 are described by the system
20x0 D  6x C y,
20y0 D
6x  3y
of two ﬁrst-order linear equations. Hence the two initial values x.0/ and y.0/ should
sufﬁce to determine the solution. Given a higher-order system, we often must trans-
form it into an equivalent ﬁrst-order system to discover how many initial conditions
are needed to determine a unique solution. Theorem 1 tells us that the number of
such conditions is precisely the same as the number of equations in the equivalent
ﬁrst-order system.

4.1 Application Gravitation and Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion
Around the turn of the 17th century, Johannes Kepler analyzed a lifetime of plane-
tary observations by the astronomer Tycho Brahe. Kepler concluded that the motion
of the planets around the sun is described by the following three propositions, now
known as Kepler’s laws of planetary motion:
1. The orbit of each planet is an ellipse with the sun at one focus.
2. The radius vector from the sun to each planet sweeps out area at a constant
rate.
3. The square of the planet’s period of revolution is proportional to the cube of
the major semiaxis of its elliptical orbit.
In his Principia Mathematica (1687) Isaac Newton deduced the inverse-square
law of gravitation from Kepler’s laws. In this application we lead you (in the oppo-
site direction) through a derivation of Kepler’s ﬁrst two laws from Newton’s law of
gravitation.
Assume that the sun is located at the origin in the plane of motion of a planet,
and write the position vector of the planet in the form
r.t/ D .x.t/; y.t// D xi C yj;
(1)
where i D .1; 0/ and j D .0; 1/ denote the unit vectors in the positive x- and y-
directions. Then the inverse-square law of gravitation implies (Problem 29) that the

238

acceleration vector r00.t/ of the planet is given by
r00 D kr
r3 ;
(2)
where r D
p
x2 C y2 is the distance from the sun to the planet. If the polar co-
ordinates of the planet at time t are .r.t/; .t//, then the radial and transverse unit
vectors shown in Fig. 4.1.16 are given by
ur D i cos  C j sin 
and
u D i sin  C j cos :
(3)
The radial unit vector ur (when located at the planet’s position) always points di-
rectly away from the origin, so ur D r=r, and the transverse unit vector u is ob-
tained from ur by a 90ı counterclockwise rotation.

graph of Eq. (12) is a conic section of eccentricity e—an ellipse if 0 5 e < 1, a
parabola if e D 1, and a hyperbola if e > 1—with focus at the origin. Planetary
orbits are bounded and therefore are ellipses with eccentricity e < 1. As indicated
in Fig. 4.1.18, the major axis of the ellipse lies along the radial line  D ˛.
STEP 9:
Plot some typical elliptical orbits as described by (12) with different ec-
centricities, sizes, and orientations. In rectangular coordinates you can write
x.t/ D r.t/ cos t;
y.t/ D r.t/ sin t;
0 5 t 5 2
to plot an elliptical orbit with eccentricity e, semilatus rectum L (Fig. 4.1.18), and
rotation angle ˛. The eccentricity of the earth’s orbit is e  0:0167, so close to
zero that the orbit looks nearly circular (though with the sun off center), and the
eccentricities of the other planetary orbits range from 0:0068 for Venus and 0:0933
for Mars to 0:2056 for Mercury and 0:2486 for Pluto. But many comets have highly
eccentric orbits, like Halley’s comet with e  0:97 (Fig. 4.1.19).

4.2 The Method of Elimination
The most elementary approach to linear systems of differential equations involves
the elimination of dependent variables by appropriately combining pairs of equa-
tions. The object of this procedure is to eliminate dependent variables in succession
until there remains only a single equation containing only one dependent variable.
This remaining equation will usually be a linear equation of high order and can fre-
quently be solved by the methods of Chapter 3. After its solution has been found, the
other dependent variables can be found in turn, using either the original differential
equations or those that have appeared in the elimination process.

240
Chapter 4 Introduction to Systems of Differential Equations
The method of elimination for linear differential systems is similar to the
solution of a linear system of algebraic equations by a process of eliminating the
unknowns one at a time until only a single equation with a single unknown remains.
It is most convenient in the case of manageably small systems: those containing
no more than two or three equations. For such systems the method of elimination
provides a simple and concrete approach that requires little preliminary theory or
formal machinery. But for larger systems of differential equations, as well as for
theoretical discussion, the matrix methods of Chapter 5 are preferable.
Example 1
Find the particular solution of the system
x0 D 4x  3y;
y0 D 6x  7y
(1)
that satisﬁes the initial conditions x.0/ D 2, y.0/ D 1.
Solution
If we solve the second equation in (1) for x, we get
x D 1
6y0 C 7
6y;
(2)
so that
x0 D 1
6y00 C 7
6y0:
(3)
We then substitute these expressions for x and x0 in the ﬁrst equation of the system in (1);
this yields

6y00 C 7
6y0 D 4

1
6y0 C 7
6y

 3y;
which we simplify to
y00 C 3y0  10y D 0:
This second-order linear equation has characteristic equation
r2 C 3r  10 D .r  2/.r C 5/ D 0;
so its general solution is
y.t/ D c1e2t C c2e5t:
(4)
Next, substitution of (4) in (2) gives

that is,
x.t/ D 3
2c1e2t C 1
3c2e5t:
(5)
Thus Eqs. (4) and (5) constitute the general solution of the system in (1).
The given initial conditions imply that
x.0/ D 3
2c1 C 1
3c2 D 2
and that
y.0/ D c1 C c2 D 1I
these equations are readily solved for c1 D 2 and c2 D 3. Hence the desired solution is
x.t/ D 3e2t  e5t;
y.t/ D 2e2t  3e5t:

Polynomial Differential Operators
In Example 1 we used an ad hoc procedure to eliminate one of the independent
variables by expressing it in terms of the other. We now describe a systematic
elimination procedure. Operator notation is most convenient for these purposes.
Recall from Section 3.3 that a polynomial differential operator is one of the form
L D anDn C an1Dn1 C    C a1D C a0;
(6)
where D denotes differentiation with respect to the independent variable t.
If L1 and L2 are two such operators, then their product L1L2 is deﬁned this
way:
L1L2Œx D L1ŒL2x:
(7)
For instance, if L1 D D C a and L2 D D C b, then
L1L2Œx D .D C a/Œ.D C b/x D D.Dx C bx/ C a.Dx C bx/
D ŒD2 C .a C b/D C abx:
This illustrates the fact that two polynomial operators with constant coefﬁcients can
be multiplied as if they were ordinary polynomials in the “variable” D. Because the
multiplication of such polynomials is commutative, it follows that
L1L2Œx D L2L1Œx
(8)
if the necessary derivatives of x.t/ exist. By contrast, this property of commutativity
generally fails for polynomial operators with variable coefﬁcients—see Problems 21
and 22.
Any system of two linear differential equations with constant coefﬁcients can
be written in the form
L1x C L2y D f1.t/;
L3x C L4y D f2.t/;
(9)
where L1, L2, L3, and L4 are polynomial differential operators (perhaps of different
orders) as in Eq. (6), and f1.t/ and f2.t/ are given functions. For instance, the
system in (1) (Example 1) can be written in the form
.D  4/x C
3y D 0,
6x C .D C 7/y D 0,
(10)
with L1 D D  4, L2 D 3, L3 D 6, and L4 D D C 7.

242
Chapter 4 Introduction to Systems of Differential Equations
To eliminate the dependent variable x from the system in (9), we operate with
L3 on the ﬁrst equation and with L1 on the second. Thus we obtain the system
L3L1x C L3L2y D L3f1.t/;
L1L3x C L1L4y D L1f2.t/:
(11)
Subtraction of the ﬁrst from the second of these equations yields the single equation
.L1L4  L2L3/y D L1f2.t/  L3f1.t/
(12)
in the single dependent variable y. After solving for y D y.t/ we can substitute the
result into either of the original equations in (9) and then solve for x D x.t/.
Alternatively, we could eliminate in like manner the dependent variable y from
the original system in (9). If so, we would get the equation
.L1L4  L2L3/x D L4f1.t/  L2f2.t/;
(13)
which can now be solved for x D x.t/.
Note that the same operator L1L4  L2L3 appears on the left-hand side in
both Eq. (12) and Eq. (13). This is the operational determinant
ˇˇˇˇ
L1
L2
L3
L4
ˇˇˇˇ D L1L4  L2L3
(14)
of the system in (9). In determinant notation Eqs. (12) and (13) can be rewritten as

It is important to note that the determinants on the right-hand side in (15) are eval-
uated by means of the operators operating on the functions. The equations in (15)
are strongly reminiscent of Cramer’s rule for the solution of two linear equations in
two (algebraic) variables and are thereby easy to remember. Indeed, you can solve
a system of two linear differential equations either by carrying out the systematic
elimination procedure described here or by directly employing the determinant no-
tation in (15). Either process is especially simple if the system is homogeneous
(f1.t/  0 and f2.t/  0), because in this case the right-hand sides of the equations
in (12), (13), and (15) are zero.

Hence Eqs. (13) and (12) are
x00 C 3x0  10x D 0;
y00 C 3y0  10y D 0:

4.2 The Method of Elimination
243
The characteristic equation of each is
r2 C 3r  10 D .r  2/.r C 5/ D 0;
so their (separate) general solutions are
x.t/ D a1e2t C a2e5t;
y.t/ D b1e2t C b2e5t:
(17)
At this point we appear to have four arbitrary constants a1, a2, b1, and b2. But it
follows from Theorem 1 in Section 4.1 that the general solution of a system of two ﬁrst-
order equations involves only two arbitrary constants. This apparent difﬁculty demands a
resolution.
The explanation is simple: There must be some hidden relations among our four con-
stants. We can discover them by substituting the solutions in (17) into either of the original
equations in (10). On substitution in the ﬁrst equation, we get
0 D x0  4x C 3y
D .2a1e2t  5a2e5t/  4.a1e2t C a2e5t/ C 3.b1e2t C b2e5t/I
that is,
0 D .2a1 C 3b1/e2t C .9a2 C 3b2/e5t:
But e2t and e5t are linearly independent functions, so it follows that a1 D 3
2b1 and a2 D
1
3b2. Therefore, the desired general solution is given by
x.t/ D 3
2b1e2t C 1
3b2e5t;
y.t/ D b1e2t C b2e5t:
Note that this result is in accord with the general solution (Eqs. (4) and (5)) that we obtained
by a different method in Example 1.
As illustrated by Example 2, the elimination procedure used to solve a linear
system frequently will introduce a number of interdependent constants that may
appear to be arbitrary, but actually are not independent. The “extra” constants must
then be eliminated by substitution of the proposed general solution into one or more
of the original differential equations. The appropriate number of arbitrary constants
in a general solution of a linear system is determined by the following proposition:
If the operational determinant in (15) is not identically zero, then the
number of independent arbitrary constants in a general solution of the
system in (9) is equal to the order of its operational determinant—that
is, its degree as a polynomial in D.
(For a proof of this fact, see pages 144–150 of E. L. Ince’s Ordinary Differential
Equations (New York: Dover, 1956).) Thus the general solution of the system in
(10) of Example 2 involves two arbitrary constants, because its operational determi-
nant D2 C 3D  10 is of order 2.
If the operational determinant is identically zero, then the system is said to be
degenerate. A degenerate system may have either no solution or inﬁnitely many
independent solutions. For instance, the equations
Dx  Dy D 0,
2Dx  2Dy D 1
with operational determinant zero are obviously inconsistent and thus have no solu-
tions. On the other hand, the equations
Dx C Dy D
t,
2Dx C 2Dy D 2t

244
Chapter 4 Introduction to Systems of Differential Equations
with operational determinant zero are obviously redundant; we can substitute any
(continuously differentiable) function for x.t/ and then integrate to obtain y.t/.
Roughly speaking, every degenerate system is equivalent to either an inconsistent
system or a redundant system.
Although the aforementioned procedures and results are described for the case
of a system of two equations, they can be generalized readily to systems of three or
more equations. For the system
L11x C L12y C L13´ D f1.t/,
L21x C L22y C L23´ D f2.t/,
L31x C L32y C L33´ D f3.t/
(18)
of three linear equations, the dependent variable x.t/ satisﬁes the single linear equa-

with analogous equations for y D y.t/ and ´ D ´.t/. For most systems of more than
three equations, however, the method of operational determinants is too tedious to
be practical.
Mechanical Vibrations
A mechanical system typically vibrates or oscillates periodically in one or more spe-
ciﬁc ways. The methods of this section often can be applied to analyze the “natural
modes of oscillation” of a given system. Example 3 illustrates this approach. ‘
Example 3
In Example 1 of Section 4.1, we derived the equations
.D2 C 3/x C
.1/y D 0,
2x C .D2 C 2/y D 0
(20)
for the displacements of the two masses in Fig. 4.2.2. Here f .t/  0 because we assume that
there is no external force. Find the general solution of the system in (20).
Solution
The operational determinant of the system in (20) is
.D2 C 3/.D2 C 2/  .1/.2/ D D4 C 5D2 C 4 D .D2 C 1/.D2 C 4/:
Hence the equations for x.t/ and y.t/ are
.D2 C 1/.D2 C 4/x D 0;
.D2 C 1/.D2 C 4/y D 0:
(21)
The characteristic equation .r2 C 1/.r2 C 4/ D 0 has roots i, i, 2i, and 2i. So the general
solutions of the equations in (21) are
x.t/ D a1 cos t C a2 sin t C b1 cos 2t C b2 sin 2t;
y.t/ D c1 cos t C c2 sin t C d1 cos 2t C d2 sin 2t:
(22)
Because the operational determinant is of order 4, the general solution should contain
four (rather than eight) arbitrary constants. When we substitute x.t/ and y.t/ from (22) in
k1 = 4
k2 = 2
m2 = 1

C 3.a1 cos t C a2 sin t C b1 cos 2t C b2 sin 2t/
 .c1 cos t C c2 sin t C d1 cos 2t C d2 sin 2t/I

thus
0 D .2a1  c1/ cos t C .2a2  c2/ sin t
C .b1  d1/ cos 2t C .b2  d2/ sin 2t:
Because cos t, cos 2t, sin t, and sin 2t are linearly independent, it follows that their coefﬁ-
cients in the last equation are zero. Thus
c1 D 2a1;
c2 D 2a2;
d1 D b1;
and
d2 D b2:
Therefore
x.t/ D
a1 cos t C
a2 sin t C b1 cos 2t C b2 sin 2t;
y.t/ D 2a1 cos t C 2a2 sin t  b1 cos 2t  b2 sin 2t
(23)
is the desired general solution of the system in (20).
The equations in (23) describe free oscillations of the mass-and-spring sys-
tem of Fig. 4.2.2—motion subject to no external forces. Four initial conditions
(typically, initial displacements and velocities) would be required to determine the
values of a1, a2, b1, and b2. The expression
.x.t/; y.t// D a1.cos t; 2 cos t/ C a2.sin t; 2 sin t/
C b1.cos 2t;  cos 2t/ C b2.sin 2t;  sin 2t/
(24)
then presents the general solution of the system in (20) as a linear combination
of four particular solutions. Moreover, the ﬁrst two of these particular solutions
represent physically similar oscillations of the masses, as do the latter two.
Indeed, we can (by the usual trigonometric machinations) write
a1 cos t C
a2 sin t D A cos.t  ˛/,
2a1 cos t C 2a2 sin t D 2A cos.t  ˛/
and
b1 cos 2t C b2 sin 2t D
B cos.2t  ˇ/,
b1 cos 2t  b2 sin 2t D B cos.2t  ˇ/
with A D
p
a21 C a22, tan ˛ D a2=a1, B D

Eq. (24) takes the form

describe the two natural modes of oscillation of the mass-and-spring system.
Moreover, they exhibit its two (circular) natural frequencies !1 D 1 and !2 D 2.
The linear combination in Eq. (25) represents an arbitrary free oscillation of
the mass-and-spring system as a superposition of its two natural modes of oscilla-
tion, with the constants A, ˛, B, and ˇ determined by the initial conditions. Figure

tion !1 D 1, but with the amplitude of m2 twice that of m1 (because y1 D 2x1). Fig-
ure 4.2.4 (where ˇ D 0) illustrates the natural mode .x2; y2/ of Eq. (27), in which the
masses move in synchrony in opposite directions, with the same frequency !2 D 2

Modern computer algebra systems and some graphing calculators also allow

solution curves of the system (1) passing through the four points .˙1; ˙1/, as well
as the direction ﬁeld for the system, displayed on a TI-Nspire CX CAS handheld.

an oscillation of frequency 2 in which the two masses move in opposite direc-
tions with the same amplitude of motion.
You can apply similarly an available computer algebra system to solve Problems 1
through 20 and 39 through 46 in this section (supplying initial conditions for the
latter ones if you like).
4.3 Numerical Methods for Systems
We now discuss the numerical approximation of solutions of systems of differential
equations. Our goal is to apply the methods of Sections 2.4 through 2.6 to the initial
value problem
x0 D f.t; x/;
x.t0/ D x0
(1)
for a system of m ﬁrst-order differential equations. In (1) the independent variable
is the scalar t, and
x D .x1; x2; : : : ; xm/
and
f D .f1; f2; : : : ; fm/
are vector-valued functions. If the component functions of f and their ﬁrst-order
partial derivatives are all continuous in a neighborhood of the point .t0; x0/, then
Theorems 3 and 4 of the Appendix guarantee the existence and uniqueness of a
solution x D x.t/ of (1) on some subinterval [of the t-axis] containing t0. With this
assurance we can proceed to discuss the numerical approximation of this solution.
Beginning with step size h, we want to approximate the values of x.t/ at the
points t1, t2, t3, : : : ; where tnC1 D tn C h for n = 0. Suppose that we have already
computed the approximations
x1;
x2;
x3;
: : : ;
xn
to the actual values
x.t1/;
x.t2/;
x.t3/;
: : : ;
x.tn/
of the exact solution of the system in (1). We can then make the step from xn to
the next approximation xnC1  x.tnC1/ by any one of the methods of Sections 2.4
through 2.6. Essentially all that is required is to write the iterative formula of the
selected method in the vector notation of the present discussion.
Euler Methods for Systems

Then the initial value problem in (1) is
x0 D f .t; x; y/;
y0 D g.t; x; y/;
x.t0/ D x0;
y.t0/ D y0;
(3)
and the scalar components of the vector formula in (2) are
xnC1 D xn C hf .tn; xn; yn/;
ynC1 D yn C hg.tn; xn; yn/:
(4)
Note that each iterative formula in (4) has the form of a single Euler iteration, but
with yn inserted like a parameter in the ﬁrst formula (for xnC1) and with xn inserted
like a parameter in the second formula (for ynC1). The generalization to the system
in (3) of each of the other methods in Sections 2.4 through 2.6 follows a similar
pattern.
The improved Euler method for systems consists at each step of calculating
ﬁrst the predictor
unC1 D xn C hf.tn; xn/
(5)
and then the corrector
xnC1 D xn C h

For the case of the two-dimensional initial value problem in (3), the scalar compo-
nents of the formulas in (5) and (6) are

Consider the initial value problem

The exact solution of the system in (9) is
x.t/ D 2e2t C et;

(10)
Here we have f .x; y/ D 3x  2y and g.x; y/ D 5x  4y in (3), so the Euler iterative formulas
in (4) are
xnC1 D xn C h  .3xn  2yn/;

With step size h D 0:1 we calculate

The actual values at t2 D 0:2 given by (10) are x.0:2/  2:562 and y.0:2/  4:573.

To compute the improved Euler approximations to x.0:2/ and y.0:2/ with a single step
of size h D 0:2, we ﬁrst calculate the predictors
u1 D 3 C .0:2/  Œ3  32  6 D 2:4;
v1 D 6 C .0:2/  Œ5  34  6 D 4:2:
Then the corrector formulas in (8) yield

As we would expect, a single improved Euler step gives better accuracy than two ordinary
Euler steps.
The Runge–Kutta Method and Second-Order Equations
The vector version of the iterative formula for the Runge–Kutta method is
xnC1 D xn C h
6.k1 C 2k2 C 2k3 C k4/;
(11)
where the vectors k1, k2, k3, and k4 are deﬁned (by analogy with Eqs. (5a)–(5d) of
Section 2.6) as follows:

initial value problem

Chapter 4 Introduction to Systems of Differential Equations
Perhaps the most common application of the two-dimensional Runge–Kutta
method is to the numerical solution of second-order initial value problems of the
form
x00 D g.t; x; x0/;
x.t0/ D x0;
x0.t0/ D y0:
(15)
If we introduce the auxiliary variable y D x0, then the problem in (15) translates
into the two-dimensional ﬁrst-order problem
x0 D y;
y0 D g.t; x; y/;
x.t0/ D x0;
y.t0/ D y0:
(16)
This is a problem of the form in (3) with f .t; x; y/ D y.
If the functions f and g are not too complicated, then it is feasible to carry
out manually a reasonable number of steps of the two-dimensional Runge–Kutta
method described here.
But the ﬁrst operating electronic computers were con-
structed (during World War II) speciﬁcally to implement methods similar to the
Runge–Kutta method for the numerical computation of trajectories of artillery pro-
jectiles. The application material for this section lists TI-Nspire CX CAS and BA-
SIC versions of Program RK2DIM that can be used with two-dimensional systems.

Example 3
In Example 4 of Section 2.3 we considered a lunar lander that initially is falling freely toward
the surface of the moon. Its retrorockets, when ﬁred, provide a deceleration of T D 4 m/s2.
We found that a soft touchdown at the lunar surface is achieved by igniting these retrorockets
when the lander is at a height of 41,870 meters (just over 26 miles) above the surface and is
then descending at the rate of 450 m/s.
Now we want to compute the descent time of the lunar lander. Let the distance x.t/ of
the lander from the center of the moon be measured in meters and measure time t in seconds.
According to the analysis in Section 2.3 (where we used r.t/ instead of x.t/), x.t/ satisﬁes
the initial value problem

4.3 Numerical Methods for Systems
253
The table in Fig. 4.3.2 shows the result of a Runge–Kutta approximation with step size h D 1
(the indicated data agreeing with those obtained with step size h D 2). Evidently, touchdown
on the lunar surface (x D 1;740;000) occurs at some time between t D 180 and t D 190
seconds. The table in Fig. 4.3.3 shows a second Runge–Kutta approximation with t.0/ D 180,
x.0/ D 1;740;059, y.0/ D 16:83, and h D 0:1. Now it is apparent that the lander’s time
of descent to the lunar surface is very close to 187 seconds; that is, 3 min 7 s. (The ﬁnal
velocity terms in these two tables are positive because the lander would begin to ascend if its
retrorockets were not turned off at touchdown.)

Higher-Order Systems
As we saw in Section 4.1, any system of higher-order differential equations can be
replaced with an equivalent system of ﬁrst-order differential equations. For exam-
ple, consider the system
x00 D F.t; x; y; x0; y0/;
y00 D G.t; x; y; x0; y0/
(21)
of second-order equations. If we substitute
x D x1;
y D x2;
x0 D x3 D x0
1;
y0 D x4 D x0
2;
then we get the equivalent system
x0
1 D x3;
x0
2 D x4;
x0
3 D F.t; x1; x2; x3; x4/;
x0
4 D G.t; x1; x2; x3; x4/
(22)
of four ﬁrst-order equations in the unknown functions x1.t/ D x.t/, x2.t/ D y.t/,
x3.t/, and x4.t/. It would be a routine (if slightly tedious) matter to write a four-
dimensional version of program RK2DIM for the purpose of solving such a sys-
tem. But in a programming language that accommodates vectors, an n-dimensional
Runge–Kutta program is scarcely more complicated than a one-dimensional pro-
gram. For instance, the application material for this section lists the n-dimensional
MATLAB program rkn that closely resembles the one-dimensional program rk of
Fig. 2.6.11.

Chapter 4 Introduction to Systems of Differential Equations
Example 4
Suppose that a batted ball starts at x0 D 0, y0 D 0 with initial velocity v0 D 160 ft=s and
with initial angle of inclination  D 30ı. If air resistance is ignored, we ﬁnd by the ele-
mentary methods of Section 1.2 that the baseball travels a [horizontal] distance of 400
p
3 ft
(approximately 693 ft) in 5 s before striking the ground. Now suppose that in addition to a
downward gravitational acceleration (g D 32 ft=s2), the baseball experiences an acceleration
due to air resistance of .0:0025/v2 feet per second per second, directed opposite to its instan-
taneous direction of motion. Determine how far the baseball will travel horizontally under
these conditions.
Solution
According to Problem 30 of Section 4.1, the equations of motion of the baseball are

d 2y
dt2 D cv dy

(23)
where v D
p
.x0/2 C .y0/2 is the speed of the ball, and where c D 0:0025 and g D 32 in fps
units. We convert to a ﬁrst-order system as in (22) and thereby obtain the system

x4.0/ D 80:
(25)
Note that x3.t/ and x4.t/ are simply the x- and y-components of the baseball’s velocity
vector, so v D
p
x23 C x24. We proceed to apply the Runge–Kutta method to investigate the
motion of the batted baseball described by the initial value problem in (24) and (25), ﬁrst
taking c D 0 to ignore air resistance and then using c D 0:0025 to take air resistance into
account.
WITHOUT AIR RESISTANCE:
Figure 4.3.4 shows the numerical results obtained when
a Runge–Kutta program such as rkn is applied with step size h D 0:1 and with c D 0 (no
air resistance). For convenience in interpreting the results, the printed output at each selected
step consists of the horizontal and vertical coordinates x and y of the baseball, its velocity v,
and the angle of inclination ˛ of its velocity vector (in degrees measured from the horizontal).
These results agree with the exact solution when c D 0. The ball travels a horizontal distance
of 400
p
3  692:82 ft in exactly 5 s, having reached a maximum height of 100 ft after 2:5
s. Note also that the ball strikes the ground at the same angle and with the same speed as its
initial angle and speed.
WITH AIR RESISTANCE:
Figure 4.3.5 shows the results obtained with the fairly real-
istic value of c D 0:0025 for the air resistance for a batted baseball. To within a hundredth of
a foot in either direction, the same results are obtained with step sizes h D 0:05 and h D 0:025.
We now see that with air resistance the ball travels a distance well under 400 ft in just over 4
s. The more reﬁned data in Fig. 4.3.6 show that the ball travels horizontally only about 340 ft
and that its maximum height is only about 66 ft. As illustrated in Fig. 4.3.7, air resistance has
converted a massive home run into a routine ﬂy ball (if hit straightaway to center ﬁeld). Note
also that when the ball strikes the ground, it has slightly under half its initial speed (only
about 79 ft=s) and is falling at a steeper angle (about 46ı). Every baseball fan has observed
empirically these aspects of the trajectory of a ﬂy ball.
Variable Step Size Methods
The Runge–Kutta method for a large system requires an appreciable amount of com-
putational labor, even when a computer is employed. Therefore, just as the step

size h should not be so large that the resulting error in the solution is unaccept-
able, h ought not to be so small that too many steps are needed, hence requiring
an unacceptable amount of computation. Thus the practical numerical solution of
differential equations involves a tradeoff between accuracy and efﬁciency.
To facilitate this tradeoff, modern variable step size methods vary the step
size h as the solution process proceeds. Large steps are taken in regions where
the dependent variables are changing slowly; smaller steps are taken when these
variables are changing rapidly, in order to prevent large errors.
An adaptable or variable step size Runge–Kutta method employs both a pre-
assigned minimum error tolerance MinTol and a maximum error tolerance MaxTol
to attempt to ensure that the error made in the typical step from xn to xnC1 is nei-
ther too large (and hence inaccurate) nor too small (and hence inefﬁcient). A fairly
simple scheme for doing this may be outlined as follows:


Having reached xn with a Runge–Kutta step of length tn  tn1 D h, let x.1/
denote the result of a further Runge–Kutta step of length h and let x.2/ denote
the result of two successive Runge–Kutta steps each of length h=2.

On the grounds that x.2/ should be a more accurate approximation to x.tn C h/
than is x.1/, take
Err D jx.1/  x.2/j
as an estimate of the error in x.1/.

If MinTol 5 Err 5 MaxTol, then let xnC1 D x.1/, tnC1 D tn C h, and proceed
to the next step.

If Err < MinTol, then the error is too small! Hence let xnC1 D x.1/, tnC1 D
tn C h, but double the step size to 2h before making the next step.

If Err > MaxTol, then the error is too large. Hence reject x.1/ and start afresh
at xn with the halved step size h=2.
The detailed implementation of such a scheme can be complicated. For a
much more complete but readable discussion of adaptive Runge–Kutta methods,
see Section 15.2 of William H. Press et al., Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientiﬁc
Computing (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1986).
Several widely available scientiﬁc computing packages (such as Maple, Math-
ematica, and MATLAB) include sophisticated variable step size programs that will
accommodate an essentially arbitrary number of simultaneous differential equa-
tions. Such a general-purpose program might be used, for example, to model nu-
merically the major components of the solar system: the sun and the nine (known)
major planets. If mi denotes the mass and ri D .xi; yi; ´i/ denotes the position
vector of the ith one of these 10 bodies, then—by Newton’s laws—the equation of
motion of mi is
mir00
i D
X
j6Di
Gmimj
.rij /3 .rj  ri/;
(26)
where rij D jrj rij denotes the distance between mi and mj. For each i D 1, 2, : : : ;
10, the summation in Eq. (26) is over all values of j 6D i from 1 to 10. The 10 vector
equations in (26) constitute a system of 30 second-order scalar equations, and the
equivalent ﬁrst-order system consists of 60 differential equations in the coordinates
and velocity components of the 10 major bodies in the solar system. Mathematical
models that involve this many (or more) differential equations—and that require so-
phisticated software and hardware for their numerical analysis—are quite common
in science, engineering, and applied technology.
Earth–Moon Satellite Orbits
For an example of a program whose efﬁcient solution requires adaptive step size
methods, we consider an Apollo satellite in orbit about the Earth E and Moon M.
Figure 4.3.8 shows an x1x2-coordinate system whose origin lies at the center of
mass of the Earth and the Moon and which rotates at the rate of one revolution
per “moon month” of approximately  D 27:32 days, so the Earth and Moon re-
main ﬁxed in their positions on the x1-axis. If we take as unit distance the distance
(about 384;000 kilometers, assumed constant) between the Earth and Moon centers,
then their coordinates are E.; 0/ and M.1  ; 0/, where  D mM=.mE C mM/
in terms of the Earth mass mE and Moon mass mM. If we take the total mass
mE C mM as the unit of mass and =.2/  4:35 days as the unit of time, then
the gravitational constant is G D 1 in Eq. (26), and the equations of motion of the

where rE and rM denote the satellite’s distance to the Earth and Moon (indicated

Suppose that the satellite initially is in a clockwise circular orbit of radius
about 2400 kilometers about the Moon. At its farthest point from the Earth (x1 D

respectively. [In the system of units used here, the unit of velocity is approxi-
mately 3680 km=h.] In each case a closed but multilooped periodic trajectory about
the Earth and the Moon—a so-called bus orbit—is obtained, but a relatively small
change in the initial velocity changes the number of loops! For more information,
see NASA Contractor Report CR-61139, “Study of the Methods for the Numerical
Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations,” prepared by O. B. Francis, Jr. et al. for
the NASA–George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, June 7, 1966.
So-called Moon–Earth “bus orbits” are periodic—that is, are closed trajecto-
ries traversed repeatedly by the satellite—only in a rotating x1x2-coordinate system
as discussed above. The satellite of Fig. 4.3.9 traverses its closed orbit and returns
to rendezvous with the Moon about 48.4 days after its insertion into orbit. Figures
4.3.11 and 4.3.12 illustrate the motion of the same satellite—but in an ordinary non-
rotating xy-coordinate system centered at the Earth, in which the Moon encircles
the Earth counterclockwise in a near-circular orbit, completing one revolution in
about 27.3 days. The Moon starts at point S, and after 48.4 days it has completed
a bit over 1.75 revolutions about the Earth and reaches the point R at which its ren-
dezvous with the satellite occurs. Figure 4.3.11 shows the positions of Moon and
satellite a day and a half after the satellite’s insertion into its orbit, each traveling in
a generally counterclockwise direction around the Earth. Figure 4.3.12 shows their
positions a day and a half before their rendezvous at point R, the satellite mean-
while having encircled the Earth about 2.5 times in an orbit that (in the indicated
xy-coordinate system) appears to resemble a slowly varying ellipse.

4.3 Problems
A hand-held calculator will sufﬁce for Problems 1 through 8.
In each problem an initial value problem and its exact solution
are given. Approximate the values of x.0:2/ and y.0:2/ in three
ways: (a) by the Euler method with two steps of size h D 0:1;
(b) by the improved Euler method with a single step of size
h D 0:2; and (c) by the Runge–Kutta method with a single
step of size h D 0:2. Compare the approximate values with the
actual values x.0:2/ and y.0:2/.

Problems 16 through 18 deal with the batted baseball of Ex-
ample 4, having initial velocity 160 ft=s and air resistance co-
efﬁcient c D 0:0025.
16. Find the range—the horizontal distance the ball travels be-
fore it hits the ground—and its total time of ﬂight with
initial inclination angles 40ı, 45ı, and 50ı.
17. Find (to the nearest degree) the initial inclination that
maximizes the range. If there were no air resistance it
would be exactly 45ı, but your answer should be less than
45ı.
18. Find (to the nearest half degree) the initial inclination an-
gle greater than 45ı for which the range is 300 ft.
19. Find the initial velocity of a baseball hit by Babe Ruth
(with c D 0:0025 and initial inclination 40ı) if it hit the
bleachers at a point 50 ft high and 500 horizontal feet from
home plate.
20. Consider the crossbow bolt of Problem 14, ﬁred with the
same initial velocity of 288 ft=s and with the air resistance
deceleration .0:0002/v2 directed opposite its direction of
motion. Suppose that this bolt is ﬁred from ground level at
an initial angle of 45ı. Find how high vertically and how
far horizontally it goes, and how long it remains in the air.
21. Suppose that an artillery projectile is ﬁred from ground
level with initial velocity 3000 ft=s and initial inclination
angle 40ı. Assume that its air resistance deceleration is
.0:0001/v2.
(a) What is the range of the projectile and
what is its total time of ﬂight? What is its speed at impact
with the ground?
(b) What is the maximum altitude of
the projectile, and when is that altitude attained? (c) You
will ﬁnd that the projectile is still losing speed at the apex
of its trajectory. What is the minimum speed that it attains
during its descent?
4.3 Application Comets and Spacecraft
Figure 4.3.13 lists TI-Nspire CX CAS and BASIC versions of the two-dimensional
Runge–Kutta program RK2DIM. You should note that it closely parallels the one-
dimensional Runge–Kutta program listed in Fig. 2.6.11, with a single line there
replaced (where appropriate) with two lines here to calculate a pair of x- and y-
values or slopes. Note also that the notation used is essentially that of Eqs. (13)
and (14) in this section.
The ﬁrst several lines deﬁne the functions and initial
data needed for Example 1.
(The TI-Nspire program can be downloaded from
www.pearsonhighered.com/mathstatsresources/.)
Figure 4.3.14 exhibits an n-dimensional MATLAB implementation of the
Runge–Kutta method. The MATLAB function f deﬁnes the vector of right-hand
sides of the differential equations in the system x0 D f.t; x/ to be solved. The rkn
function then takes as input the initial t-value t, the column vector x of initial x-
values, the ﬁnal t-value t1, and the desired number n of subintervals. As output
it produces the resulting column vector T of t-values and the matrix X whose rows
give the corresponding x-values. For instance, with f as indicated in the ﬁgure, the
MATLAB command
[T,X] = rkn(0, [0;1], 5, 50)
then generates the data shown in the table of Fig. 4.3.1 (which lists only every ﬁfth
value of each variable).
You can use Examples 1 through 3 in this section to test your own imple-
mentation of the Runge–Kutta method.
Then investigate the comet and space-
craft problems described next.
Additional application material at the web site
www.pearsonhighered.com/mathstatsresources/ describes additional nu-
merical ODE investigations ranging from batted baseballs to the Apollo orbits
shown in Figs. 4.3.9 and 4.3.10.

the system in (2) translates into a system of four ﬁrst-order differential equations

Figure 4.3.16 shows the graph of the distance r.t/ of Halley’s comet from
the sun. Inspection of this graph indicates that Halley’s comet reaches a maximum
distance (at aphelion) of about 35 AU in a bit less than 40 years and returns to
perihelion after about three-quarters of a century. The closer look in Fig. 4.3.17
indicates that the period of revolution of Halley’s comet is about 76 years. Use your
numerical solution to reﬁne these observations. What is your best estimate of the
calendar date of the comet’s next perihelion passage?

Your Own Comet
The night before your birthday in 2007 you set up your telescope on a nearby moun-
taintop. It was a clear night, and you had a stroke of luck: At 12:30 A.M. you
spotted a new comet. After repeating the observation on successive nights, you
were able to calculate its solar system coordinates p0 D .x0; y0; ´0/ and its velocity
vector v0 D .vx0; vy0; v´0/ on that ﬁrst night. Using this information, determine the
following:

the comet’s perihelion (point nearest the sun) and aphelion (point farthest from
the sun),

the comet’s velocity at perihelion and at aphelion,

the comet’s period of revolution around the sun, and

the comet’s next two dates of perihelion passage.
Using units of length in AU and time in earth years, the equations of motion
of your comet are given in (4). For your personal comet, begin with random initial
position and velocity vectors with the same order of magnitude as those of Halley’s
comet. Repeat the random selection of initial position and velocity vectors, if nec-
essary, until you get a plausible eccentric orbit that ranges well outside the earth’s
orbit (as most real comets do).

5.1 Matrices and Linear Systems
A
lthough the simple elimination techniques of Section 4.2 sufﬁce for the
solution of small linear systems containing only two or three equations with
constant coefﬁcients, the general properties of linear systems—as well as solution
methods suitable for larger systems—are most easily and concisely described using
the language and notation of vectors and matrices. For ready reference and review,
this section begins with a complete and self-contained account of the matrix notation
and terminology that is needed. Special techniques of linear algebra—speciﬁcally,
those associated with eigenvalues and eigenvectors—are introduced as needed in
subsequent sections of this chapter.

the abbreviation A D

Actually for each pair of positive integers m and n there is an m  n zero matrix, but
the single symbol 0 will sufﬁce for all these zero matrices.
Two m  n matrices A D

 are said to be equal if corre-
sponding elements are equal; that is, if aij D bij for 1 5 i 5 m and 1 5 j 5 n. We

the matrix A by the number c, we simply multiply each of its elements by c:

An m  1 matrix—one having only a single column—is called a column vec-

Matrix Multiplication
The properties listed in Eqs. (6) through (9) are quite natural and expected. The ﬁrst
surprises in the realm of matrix arithmetic come with multiplication. We deﬁne ﬁrst
the scalar product of a row vector a and a column vector b, each having the same
number p of elements. If

(10)
exactly as in the scalar or dot product of two vectors—a familiar topic from elemen-
tary calculus.
The product AB of two matrices is deﬁned only if the number of columns of
A is equal to the number of rows of B. If A is an m  p matrix and B is a p  n
matrix, then their product AB is the m  n matrix C D

product of the ith row vector ai of A and the jth column vector bj of B. Thus

us that the number of columns of A must be equal to the number of rows of B.

But matrix multiplication is not commutative. That is, if A and B are both

for which each entry on the principal diagonal is 1 and all off-diagonal entries are
zero. It is quite easy to verify that

for every square matrix A of the same order as I.
If A is a square matrix, then an inverse of A is a square matrix B of the same
order as A such that both
AB D I
and
BA D I:
It is not difﬁcult to show that if the matrix A has an inverse, then this inverse is
unique. Consequently, we may speak of the inverse of A, and we will denote it by
A1. Thus
AA1 D I D A1A;
(19)
given the existence of A1.
It is clear that some square matrices do not have
inverses—consider any square zero matrix. It is also easy to show that if A1 exists,
then .A1/1 exists and .A1/1 D A.
In linear algebra it is proved that A1 exists if and only if the determinant
det.A/ of the square matrix A is nonzero. If so, the matrix A is said to be nonsin-
gular; if det.A/ D 0, then A is called a singular matrix.

Determinants
We assume that the student has computed 2  2 and 3  3 determinants in earlier

ˇˇˇˇ D a11a22  a12a21:
Determinants of higher order may be deﬁned by induction, as follows. If A D

 aij

is an n  n matrix, let Aij denote the .n  1/  .n  1/ matrix obtained from A by
deleting its ith row and its jth column. The expansion of the determinant jAj along
its ith row is given by
jAj D

and its expansion along its jth column is given by

It is shown in linear algebra that whichever row we use in Eq. (20a) and whichever
column we use in Eq. (20b), the results are the same in all 2n cases. Hence jAj is
well deﬁned by these formulas.

First-Order Linear Systems
The notation and terminology of matrices and vectors may seem rather elaborate
when ﬁrst encountered, but it is readily assimilated with practice. Our main use for
matrix notation will be the simpliﬁcation of computations with systems of differ-
ential equations, especially those computations that would be burdensome in scalar
notation.
We discuss here the general system of n ﬁrst-order linear equations

If we introduce the coefﬁcient matrix
P.t/ D

 pij .t/ 
and the column vectors
x D

 xi

and
f.t/ D

 fi.t/ 
;
then the system in (27) takes the form of a single matrix equation
dx
dt D P.t/x C f.t/:
(28)
We will see that the general theory of the linear system in (27) closely parallels
that of a single nth-order equation. The matrix notation used in Eq. (28) not only
emphasizes this analogy, but also saves a great deal of space.
A solution of Eq. (28) on the open interval I is a column vector function
x.t/ D

 xi.t/  such that the component functions of x satisfy the system in (27)
identically on I. If the functions pij .t/ and fi.t/ are all continuous on I, then
Theorem 1 of Section 4.1 guarantees the existence on I of a unique solution x.t/
satisfying preassigned initial conditions x.a/ D b.

To investigate the general nature of the solutions of Eq. (28), we consider ﬁrst
the associated homogeneous equation
dx

(29)
which has the form shown in Eq. (28), but with f.t/  0. We expect it to have n
solutions x1, x2, : : : ; xn that are independent in some appropriate sense, and such
that every solution of Eq. (29) is a linear combination of these n particular solutions.
Given n solutions x1, x2, : : : ; xn of Eq. (29), let us write
xj .t/ D

(30)
Thus xij .t/ denotes the ith component of the vector xj .t/, so the second subscript
refers to the vector function xj .t/, whereas the ﬁrst subscript refers to a component
of this function. Theorem 1 is analogous to Theorem 1 of Section 3.2.
THEOREM 1
Principle of Superposition
Let x1, x2, : : : ; xn be n solutions of the homogeneous linear equation in (29) on
the open interval I. If c1, c2, : : : ; cn are constants, then the linear combination
x.t/ D c1x1.t/ C c2x2.t/ C    C cnxn.t/
(31)
is also a solution of Eq. (29) on I.

x1.t/ D 3c1e2t C c2e5t;
x2.t/ D 2c1e2t C 3c2e5t;
which is equivalent to the general solution we found by the method of elimination in Example
2 of Section 4.2.
Independence and General Solutions
Linear independence is deﬁned in the same way for vector-valued functions as for
real-valued functions (Section 3.2). The vector-valued functions x1, x2, : : : ; xn are
linearly dependent on the interval I provided that there exist constants c1, c2, : : : ;
cn not all zero such that
c1x1.t/ C c2x2.t/ C    C cnxn.t/ D 0
(32)
for all t in I. Otherwise, they are linearly independent. Equivalently, they are
linearly independent provided that no one of them is a linear combination of the
others. For instance, the two solutions x1 and x2 of Example 6 are linearly indepen-
dent because, clearly, neither is a scalar multiple of the other.
Just as in the case of a single nth-order equation, there is a Wronskian deter-
minant that tells us whether or not n given solutions of the homogeneous equation
in (29) are linearly dependent. If x1, x2, : : : ; xn are such solutions, then their Wron-
skian is the n  n determinant

using the notation in (30) for the components of the solutions. We may write either
W.t/ or W.x1; x2; : : : ; xn/. Note that W is the determinant of the matrix that has as
its column vectors the solutions x1, x2, : : : ; xn. Theorem 2 is analogous to Theorem
3 of Section 3.2. Moreover, its proof is essentially the same, with the deﬁnition of
W.x1; x2; : : : ; xn/ in Eq. (33) substituted for the deﬁnition of the Wronskian of n
solutions of a single nth-order equation (see Problems 42 through 44).

If x1, x2, : : : ; xn are linearly independent on I, then W ¤ 0 at each point
of I.
Thus there are only two possibilities for solutions of homogeneous systems: Ei-
ther W D 0 at every point of I, or W D 0 at no point of I.

which is never zero. Hence Theorem 2 implies that the solutions x1, x2, and x3 are linearly
independent (on any open interval).
Theorem 3 is analogous to Theorem 4 of Section 3.2. It says that a general
solution of the homogeneous n  n system x0 D P.t/x is a linear combination
x D c1x1 C c2x2 C    C cnxn
(35)
of any n given linearly independent solutions x1, x2, : : : ; xn.
THEOREM 3
General Solutions of Homogeneous Systems
Let x1, x2, : : : ; xn be n linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous linear
equation x0 D P.t/x on an open interval I, where P.t/ is continuous. If x.t/ is any
solution whatsoever of the equation x0 D P.t/x on I, then there exist numbers c1,
c2, : : : ; cn such that
x.t/ D c1x1.t/ C c2x2.t/ C    C cnxn.t/
(35)
for all t in I.

5.1 Matrices and Linear Systems
275
Proof:
Let a be a ﬁxed point of I. We show ﬁrst that there exist numbers c1,
c2, : : : ; cn such that the solution
y.t/ D c1x1.t/ C c2x2.t/ C    C cnxn.t/
(36)
has the same initial values at t D a as does the given solution x.t/; that is, such that
c1x1.a/ C c2x2.a/ C    C cnxn.a/ D x.a/:
(37)
Let X.t/ be the n  n matrix with column vectors x1, x2, : : : ; xn, and let c be the
column vector with components c1, c2, : : : ; cn. Then Eq. (37) may be written in the
form
X.a/c D x.a/:
(38)
The Wronskian determinant W.a/ D jX.a/j is nonzero because the solutions x1,
x2, : : : ; xn are linearly independent. Hence the matrix X.a/ has an inverse matrix
X.a/1. Therefore the vector c D X.a/1x.a/ satisﬁes Eq. (38), as desired.
Finally, note that the given solution x.t/ and the solution y.t/ of Eq. (36)—
with the values of ci determined by the equation c D X.a/1x.a/—have the same
initial values (at t D a). It follows from the existence-uniqueness theorem of Section
4.1 that x.t/ D y.t/ for all t in I. This establishes Eq. (35).
Remark Every n  n system x0 D P.t/x with continuous coefﬁcient matrix does have a
set of n linearly independent solutions x1; x2; : : : ; xn as in the hypotheses of Theorem 3. It
sufﬁces to choose for xj .t/ the unique solution such that
xj .a/ D

—that is, the column vector with all elements zero except for a 1 in row j. (In other words,
xj .a/ is merely the jth column of the identity matrix.) Then

so the solutions x1; x2; : : : ; xn are linearly independent by Theorem 2. How to actually ﬁnd
these solutions explicitly is another matter—one that we address in Section 5.2 (for the case
of constant coefﬁcient matrices).
Initial Value Problems and Elementary Row Operations
The general solution in Eq. (35) of the homogeneous linear system x0 D P.t/x can
be written in the form
x.t/ D X.t/c;
(39)
where

x.a/ D b;
(41)

Eq. (39), it sufﬁces to solve the system

(42)
to ﬁnd the coefﬁcients c1, c2, : : : ; cn in Eq. (35).
We therefore review brieﬂy the elementary technique of row reduction to solve
an n  n algebraic linear system

(43)
with nonsingular coefﬁcient matrix A D Œaij , constant vector b D Œbi, and un-
knowns x1; x2; : : : ; xn. The basic idea is to transform the system in (43) into the
simpler upper triangular form
a11x1 C a12x2 C    C a1nxn D b1;
a22x2 C    C a2nxn D b2;
:::
annxn D bn
(44)
in which only the unknowns xj ; xjC1; : : : ; xn appear explicitly in the jth equation
(j D 1, 2, : : : ; n). The transformed system is then easily solved by the process of
back substitution. First the last equation in (44) is solved for xn, then the next-to-last
is solved for xn1, and so forth, until the ﬁrst equation is ﬁnally solved for x1.
The transformation of the system in (43) to upper triangular form is most
easily described in terms of elementary row operations on the augmented coefﬁcient
matrix

that is obtained by adjoining the vector b to the matrix A as an additional column.
The admissible elementary row operations are of the following three types:

5.1 Matrices and Linear Systems
277
1. Multiply any (single) row of the matrix by a nonzero constant.
2. Interchange any two rows of the matrix.
3. Subtract a constant multiple of one row from any other row.
The goal is to use a sequence of such operations (one by one, in turn) to trans-
form

 A
b  into an upper triangular matrix, one that has only zeros beneath its
principal diagonal. This upper triangular augmented coefﬁcient matrix then cor-
responds to an upper triangular system as in (44). The process of transforming

 A
b  is carried out one column at a time, from left to right, as in the next exam-
ple.

Nonhomogeneous Solutions
We ﬁnally turn our attention to a nonhomogeneous linear system of the form
dx
dt D P.t/x C f.t/:
(47)
The following theorem is analogous to Theorem 5 of Section 3.2 and is proved in
precisely the same way, substituting the preceding theorems in this section for the
analogous theorems of Section 3.2. In brief, Theorem 4 means that the general
solution of Eq. (47) has the form
x.t/ D xc.t/ C xp.t/;
(48)
where xp.t/ is a single particular solution of Eq. (47) and the complementary func-
tion xc.t/ is a general solution of the associated homogeneous equation x0 D P.t/x.
THEOREM 4
Solutions of Nonhomogeneous Systems
Let xp be a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous linear equation in (47)
on an open interval I on which the functions P.t/ and f.t/ are continuous. Let
x1, x2, : : : ; xn be linearly independent solutions of the associated homogeneous
equation on I. If x.t/ is any solution whatsoever of Eq. (47) on I, then there
exist numbers c1, c2, : : : ; cn such that
x.t/ D c1x1.t/ C c2x2.t/ C    C cnxn.t/ C xp.t/
(49)
for all t in I.
Thus ﬁnding a general solution of a nonhomogeneous linear system involves
two separate steps:
1. Finding the general solution xc.t/ of the associated homogeneous system;
2. Finding a single particular solution xp.t/ of the nonhomogeneous system.
The sum x.t/ D xc.t/Cxp.t/ will then be a general solution of the nonhomogeneous
system.

with the aid of calculators or computers. For instance, recall that in Example 8 we

C := multiply(inverse(A),B);
the Mathematica commands

5.2 The Eigenvalue Method for Homogeneous Systems
We now introduce a powerful alternative to the method of elimination for construct-
ing the general solution of a homogeneous ﬁrst-order linear system with constant
coefﬁcients,
x0
1 D a11x1 C a12x2 C    C a1nxn;
x0
2 D a21x1 C a22x2 C    C a2nxn;
:::
x0
n D an1x1 C an2x2 C    C annxn:
(1)
By Theorem 3 of Section 5.1, we know that it sufﬁces to ﬁnd n linearly independent
solution vectors x1; x2; : : : ; xn; the linear combination
x.t/ D c1x1 C c2x2 C    C cnxn
(2)
with arbitrary coefﬁcients will then be a general solution of the system in (1).
To search for the n needed linearly independent solution vectors, we proceed
by analogy with the characteristic root method for solving a single homogeneous
equation with constant coefﬁcients (Section 3.3). It is reasonable to anticipate solu-
tion vectors of the form

where , v1; v2; : : : ; vn are appropriate scalar constants. For if we substitute
xi D viet;
x0
i D viet;
(i D 1; 2; : : : ; n)
in (1), then each term in the resulting equations will have the factor et, so we
can cancel it throughout. This will leave us with n linear equations which—for
appropriate values of —we can hope to solve for values of the coefﬁcients v1, v2,
: : : ; vn in Eq. (3) so that x.t/ D vet is, indeed, a solution of the system in (1).
To investigate this possibility, it is more efﬁcient to write the system in (1) in
the matrix form
x0 D Ax
(4)
where A D

 aij
. When we substitute the trial solution x D vet with derivative
x0 D vet in Eq. (4), the result is
vet D Avet:
We cancel the nonzero scalar factor et to get
Av D v:
(5)

5.2 The Eigenvalue Method for Homogeneous Systems
283
This means that x D vet will be a nontrivial solution of Eq. (4) provided that v is a
nonzero vector and  is a constant such that Eq. (5) holds; that is, the matrix product
Av is a scalar multiple of the vector v. The question now is this: How do we ﬁnd v
and ?
To answer this question, we rewrite Eq. (5) in the form
.A  I/v D 0:
(6)
Given , this is a system of n homogeneous linear equations in the unknowns v1,
v2, : : : ; vn. By a standard theorem of linear algebra, it has a nontrivial solution if
and only if the determinant of its coefﬁcient matrix vanishes; that is, if and only if
jA  Ij D det.A  I/ D 0:
(7)
In its simplest formulation, the eigenvalue method for solving the system x0 D Ax
consists of ﬁnding  so that Eq. (7) holds and next solving Eq. (6) with this value of
 to obtain v1, v2, : : : ; vn. Then x D vet will be a solution vector. The name of the
method comes from the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
The number  (either zero or nonzero) is called an eigenvalue of the n  n matrix
A provided that
jA  Ij D 0:
(7)
An eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue  is a nonzero vector v such that
Av D v, so that
.A  I/v D 0:
(6)
Note that if v is an eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue , then so is any
nonzero constant scalar multiple cv of v—this follows upon multiplication of each
side in Eq. (6) by c 6D 0.
The preﬁx eigen is a German word with the approximate translation charac-
teristic in this context; the terms characteristic value and characteristic vector are
in common use. For this reason, the equation

is called the characteristic equation of the matrix A; its roots are the eigenval-
ues of A. Upon expanding the determinant in (8), we evidently get an nth-degree
polynomial of the form
.1/nn C bn1n1 C    C b1 C b0 D 0:
(9)
By the fundamental theorem of algebra, this equation has n roots—possibly some
are complex, possibly some are repeated—and thus an n  n matrix has n eigenval-
ues (counting repetitions, if any). Although we assume that the elements of A are

284
Chapter 5 Linear Systems of Differential Equations
real numbers, we allow the possibility of complex eigenvalues and complex-valued
eigenvectors.
Our discussion of Eqs. (4) through (7) provides a proof of the following the-
orem, which is the basis for the eigenvalue method of solving a ﬁrst-order linear
system with constant coefﬁcients.
THEOREM 1
Eigenvalue Solutions of x0 = Ax
Let  be an eigenvalue of the [constant] coefﬁcient matrix A of the ﬁrst-order
linear system
dx
dt D Ax:
If v is an eigenvector associated with , then
x.t/ D vet
is a nontrivial solution of the system.
The Eigenvalue Method
In outline, this method for solving the n  n homogeneous constant-coefﬁcient sys-
tem x0 D Ax proceeds as follows:
1. We ﬁrst solve the characteristic equation in (8) for the eigenvalues 1; 2; : : : ; n
of the matrix A.
2. Next we attempt to ﬁnd n linearly independent eigenvectors v1; v2; : : : ; vn as-
sociated with these eigenvalues.
3. Step 2 is not always possible, but when it is, we get n linearly independent
solutions
x1.t/ D v1e1t;
x2.t/ D v2e2t;
: : : ;
xn.t/ D vnent:
(10)
In this case the general solution of x0 D Ax is a linear combination
x.t/ D c1x1.t/ C c2x2.t/ C    C cnxn.t/
of these n solutions.
We will discuss separately the various cases that can occur, depending on whether
the eigenvalues are distinct or repeated, real or complex. The case of repeated
eigenvalues—multiple roots of the characteristic equation—will be deferred to Sec-
tion 5.5.
Distinct Real Eigenvalues
If the eigenvalues 1; 2; : : : ; n are real and distinct, then we substitute each of
them in turn in Eq. (6) and solve for the associated eigenvectors v1, v2, : : : ; vn.
In this case it can be proved that the particular solution vectors given in (10) are
always linearly independent. (For instance, see Section 6.2 of Edwards and Pen-
ney, Elementary Linear Algebra (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1988).) In
any particular example such linear independence can always be veriﬁed by using
the Wronskian determinant of Section 5.1. The following example illustrates the
procedure.

(14)
In contrast with the nonsingular (algebraic) linear systems whose solutions we discussed in
Section 5.1, the homogeneous linear system in (14) is singular—the two scalar equations ob-
viously are equivalent (each being a multiple of the other). Therefore, Eq. (14) has inﬁnitely
many nonzero solutions—we can choose a arbitrarily (but nonzero) and then solve for b.
Substitution of an eigenvalue  in the eigenvector equation .AI/v D 0 always yields
a singular homogeneous linear system, and among its inﬁnity of solutions we generally seek
a “simple” solution with small integer values (if possible). Looking at the second equation in
(14), the choice a D 1 yields b D 3, and thus
v1 D


is an eigenvector associated with 1 D 2 (as is any nonzero constant multiple of v1).

of equivalent scalar equations. With b D 1 in the ﬁrst equation we get a D 2, so

Compartmental Analysis
Frequently a complex process or system can be broken down into simpler subsys-
tems or “compartments” that can be analyzed separately. The whole system can
then be modeled by describing the interactions between the various compartments.
Thus a chemical plant may consist of a succession of separate stages (or even phys-
ical compartments) in which various reactants and products combine or are mixed.
It may happen that a single differential equation describes each compartment of the
system, and then the whole physical system is modeled by a system of differential
equations.
As a simple example of a three-stage system, Fig. 5.2.2 shows three brine
tanks containing V1, V2, and V3 gallons of brine, respectively. Fresh water ﬂows
into tank 1, while mixed brine ﬂows from tank 1 into tank 2, from tank 2 into tank
3, and out of tank 3. Let xi.t/ denote the amount (in pounds) of salt in tank i at

ﬁnd the amount of salt in each tank at time t = 0.

5.2 The Eigenvalue Method for Homogeneous Systems
289
Complex Eigenvalues
Even if some of the eigenvalues are complex, so long as they are distinct the method
described previously still yields n linearly independent solutions. The only compli-
cation is that the eigenvectors associated with complex eigenvalues are ordinarily
complex valued, so we will have complex-valued solutions.
To obtain real-valued solutions, we note that—because we are assuming that
the matrix A has only real entries—the coefﬁcients in the characteristic equation in
(8) will all be real. Consequently any complex eigenvalues must appear in complex
conjugate pairs. Suppose then that  D p C qi and  D p  qi are such a pair of
eigenvalues. If v is an eigenvector associated with , so that
.A  I/v D 0;
then taking complex conjugates in this equation yields

since A D A and I D I (these matrices being real) and the conjugate of a complex
product is the product of the conjugates of the factors. Thus the conjugate v of v
is an eigenvector associated with . Of course the conjugate of a vector is deﬁned
componentwise; if

then v D a  bi. The complex-valued solution associated with  and v is then

that is,
x.t/ D ept.a cos qt  b sin qt/ C iept.b cos qt C a sin qt/:
(21)
Because the real and imaginary parts of a complex-valued solution are also solu-
tions, we thus get the two real-valued solutions
x1.t/ D ReŒx.t/ D ept.a cos qt  b sin qt/;
x2.t/ D ImŒx.t/ D ept.b cos qt C a sin qt/
(22)
associated with the complex conjugate eigenvalues p ˙ qi. It is easy to check that
the same two real-valued solutions result from taking real and imaginary parts of
vet. Rather than memorizing the formulas in (22), it is preferable in a speciﬁc
example to proceed as follows:

First ﬁnd explicitly a single complex-valued solution x.t/ associated with the
complex eigenvalue ;

Then ﬁnd the real and imaginary parts x1.t/ and x2.t/ to get two independent
real-valued solutions corresponding to the two complex conjugate eigenvalues
 and .

Observe that

(30)
Of course the total amount of salt in the closed system is constant; the constant c0 in (30) is
one-ﬁfth the total amount of salt. Because of the factors of e.0:4/t in (29), we see that
lim
t!1 x1.t/ D 2c0;
lim
t!1 x2.t/ D c0;
and
lim

Thus as t ! C1 the salt in the system approaches a steady-state distribution with 40% of
the salt in each of the two 50-gallon tanks and 20% in the 25-gallon tank. So whatever the
initial distribution of salt among the three tanks, the limiting distribution is one of uniform
concentration throughout the system. Figure 5.2.6 shows the graphs of the three solution

For a more substantial investigation, choose a positive integer n < 10 (n D 5,
for instance) and let q1, q2, : : : ; qn denote the ﬁrst n nonzero digits in your student
ID number. Now consider an open system of brine tanks as in Fig. 5.2.2, except
with n rather than three successive tanks having volumes Vi D 10qi (i D 1, 2, : : : ;
n) in gallons. If each ﬂow rate is r D 10 gallons per minute, then the salt amounts

Now show that, in this closed system, as t ! C1 the salt originally in tank 1
distributes itself with constant density throughout the various tanks. A plot like
Fig. 5.2.6 should make this fairly obvious.
5.3 A Gallery of Solution Curves of Linear Systems
In the preceding section we saw that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
n  n matrix A are of central importance to the solutions of the homogeneous linear
constant-coefﬁcient system
x0 D Ax:
(1)
Indeed, according to Theorem 1 from Section 5.2, if  is an eigenvalue of A and v
is an eigenvector of A associated with , then
x.t/ D vet
(2)
is a nontrivial solution of the system (1). Moreover, if A has n linearly independent
eigenvectors v1, v2, : : : ; vn associated with its n eigenvalues 1, 2, : : : ; n, then in
fact all solutions of the system (1) are given by linear combinations
x.t/ D c1v1e1t C c2v2e2t C    C cnvnent;
(3)
where c1; c2; : : : ; cn are arbitrary constants. If the eigenvalues include complex con-
jugate pairs, then we can obtain a real-valued general solution from Eq. (3) by taking
real and imaginary parts of the terms in (3) corresponding to the complex eigenval-
ues.
Our goal in this section is to gain a geometric understanding of the role that the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A play in the solutions of the system (1).
We will see, illustrating primarily with the case n D 2, that particular arrangements
of eigenvalues and eigenvectors correspond to identiﬁable patterns—“ﬁngerprints,”
so to speak—in the phase plane portrait of the system (1). Just as in algebra we
learn to recognize when an equation in x and y corresponds to a line or parabola,
we can predict the general appearance of the solution curves of the system (1) from
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A. By considering various cases
for these eigenvalues and eigenvectors we will create a “gallery”— Figure 5.3.16
appearing at the end of this section—of typical phase plane portraits that gives,
in essence, a complete catalog of the geometric behaviors that the solutions of a
2  2 homogeneous linear constant-coefﬁcient system can exhibit. This will help us
analyze not only systems of the form (1), but also more complicated systems that
can be approximated by linear systems, a topic we explore in Section 6.2.
Systems of Dimension n = 2
Until stated otherwise, we henceforth assume that n D 2, so that the eigenvalues of
the matrix A are 1 and 2. As we noted in Section 5.2, if 1 and 2 are distinct,
then the associated eigenvectors v1 and v2 of A are linearly independent. In this
event, the general solution of the system (1) is given by
x.t/ D c1v1e1t C c2v2e2t
(4)
if 1 and 2 are real, and by
x.t/ D c1ept.a cos qt  b sin qt/ C c2ept.b cos qt C a sin qt/
(5)

5.3 A Gallery of Solution Curves of Linear Systems
297
if 1 and 2 are the complex conjugate numbers p ˙ iq; here the vectors a and b are
the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of a (complex-valued) eigenvector of A
associated with the eigenvalue p ˙ iq. If instead 1 and 2 are equal (to a common
value , say), then as we will see in Section 5.5, the matrix A may or may not have
two linearly independent eigenvectors v1 and v2 . If it does, then the eigenvalue
method of Section 5.2 applies once again, and the general solution of the system (1)
is given by the linear combination
x.t/ D c1v1et C c2v2et
(6)
as before. If A does not have two linearly independent eigenvectors, then—as we
will see—we can ﬁnd a vector v2 such that the general solution of the system (1) is
given by
x.t/ D c1v1et C c2.v1t C v2/et;
(7)
where v1 is an eigenvector of A associated with the lone eigenvalue . The nature
of the vector v2 and other details of the general solution in (7) will be discussed in
Section 5.5, but we include this case here in order to make our gallery complete.
With this algebraic background in place, we begin our analysis of the solution
curves of the system (1). First we assume that the eigenvalues 1 and 2 of the ma-
trix A are real, and subsequently we take up the case where 1 and 2 are complex
conjugates.
Real Eigenvalues
We will divide the case where 1 and 2 are real into the following possibilities:
Distinct eigenvalues

Nonzero and of opposite sign (1 < 0 < 2)

Both negative (1 < 2 < 0)

Both positive (0 < 2 < 1)

One zero and one negative (1 < 2 D 0)

One zero and one positive (0 D 2 < 1)
Repeated eigenvalue

Positive (1 D 2 > 0)

Negative (1 D 2 < 0)

Zero (1 D 2 D 0)
Saddle Points
NONZERO DISTINCT EIGENVALUES OF OPPOSITE SIGN:
The key observa-
tion when 1 < 0 < 2 is that the positive scalar factors e1t and e2t in the general
solution
x.t/ D c1v1e1t C c2v2e2t
(4)
of the system x0 D Ax move in opposite directions (on the real line) as t varies. For
example, as t grows large and positive, e2t grows large, because 2 > 0, whereas
e1t approaches zero, because 1 < 0; thus the term c1v1e1t in the solution x.t/
in (4) vanishes and x.t/ approaches c2v2e2t. If instead t grows large and negative,
then the opposite occurs: The factor e1t grows large whereas e2t becomes small,
and the solution x.t/ approaches c1v1e1t. If we assume for the moment that both c1
and c2 are nonzero, then loosely speaking, as t ranges from 1 to C1, the solution
x.t/ shifts from being “mostly” a multiple of the eigenvector v1 to being “mostly” a
multiple of v2.

298
Chapter 5 Linear Systems of Differential Equations
Geometrically, this means that all solution curves given by (4) with both c1
and c2 nonzero have two asymptotes, namely the lines l1 and l2 passing through the
origin and parallel to the eigenvectors v1 and v2, respectively; the solution curves
approach l1 as t ! 1 and l2 as t ! C1. Indeed, as Fig. 5.3.1 illustrates, the
lines l1 and l2 effectively divide the plane into four “quadrants” within which all
solution curves ﬂow from the asymptote l1 to the asymptote l2 as t increases. (The
eigenvectors shown in Fig. 5.3.1—and in other ﬁgures—are scaled so as to have
equal length.) The particular quadrant in which a solution curve lies is determined
by the signs of the coefﬁcients c1 and c2. If c1 and c2 are both positive, for example,
then the corresponding solution curve extends asymptotically in the direction of the
eigenvector v1 as t ! 1, and asymptotically in the direction of v2 as t ! 1.
If instead c1 > 0 but c2 < 0, then the corresponding solution curve still extends
asymptotically in the direction of v1 as t ! 1, but extends asymptotically in the
direction opposite v2 as t ! C1 (because the negative coefﬁcient c2 causes the
vector c2v2 to point “backwards” from v2).
If c1 or c2 equals zero, then the solution curve remains conﬁned to one of the
lines l1 and l2. For example, if c1 6D 0 but c2 D 0, then the solution (4) becomes
x.t/ D c1v1e1t, which means that the corresponding solution curve lies along the
line l1. It approaches the origin as t ! C1, because 1 < 0, and recedes farther
and farther from the origin as t ! 1, either in the direction of v1 (if c1 > 0) or
the direction opposite v1 (if c1 < 0). Similarly, if c1 D 0 and c2 6D 0, then because
2 > 0, the solution curve ﬂows along the line l2 away from the origin as t ! C1
and toward the origin as t ! 1.

Figure 5.3.1 illustrates typical solution curves corresponding to nonzero val-

the origin a saddle point for the system x0 D Ax.

by the lines l1 and l2, which form a natural frame of reference for the solution curves.)

Nodes: Sinks and Sources
DISTINCT NEGATIVE EIGENVALUES:
When 1 < 2 < 0, the factors e1t and
e2t both decrease as t increases. Indeed, as t ! C1, both e1t and e2t approach
zero, which means that the solution curve
x.t/ D c1v1e1t C c2v2e2t
(4)
approaches the origin; likewise, as t ! 1, both e1t and e2t grow without bound,
and so the solution curve “goes off to inﬁnity.” Moreover, differentiation of the
solution in (4) gives
x0.t/ D c11v1e1t C c22v2e2t D e2t h
c11v1e.12/t C c22v2
i
:
(11)
This shows that the tangent vector x0.t/ to the solution curve x.t/ is a scalar mul-
tiple of the vector c11v1e.12/t C c22v2, which approaches the ﬁxed nonzero
multiple c22v2 of the vector v2 as t ! C1 (because e.12/t approaches zero). It
follows that if c2 6D 0 , then as t ! C1 , the solution curve x.t/ becomes more and
more nearly parallel to the eigenvector v2 . (More speciﬁcally, note that if c2 > 0,
for example, then x.t/ approaches the origin in the direction opposite to v2, because
the scalar c22 is negative.) Thus, if c2 6D 0 , then with increasing t the solution
curve approaches the origin and is tangent there to the line l2 passing through the
origin and parallel to v2.
If c2 D 0, on the other hand, then the solution curve x.t/ ﬂows similarly along

the line l1 passing through the origin and parallel to the eigenvector v1. Once again,
the net effect is that the lines l1 and l2 divide the plane into four “quadrants” as
shown in Figure 5.3.2, which illustrates typical solution curves corresponding to
nonzero values of the coefﬁcients c1 and c2.
To describe the appearance of phase portraits like Fig. 5.3.2, we introduce
some new terminology, which will be useful both now and in Chapter 6, when we
study nonlinear systems. In general, we call the origin a node of the system x0 D Ax
provided that both of the following conditions are satisﬁed:

Either every trajectory approaches the origin as t ! C1 or every trajectory
recedes from the origin as t ! C1;

Every trajectory is tangent at the origin to some straight line through the ori-
gin.
Moreover, we say that the origin is a proper node provided that no two different
pairs of “opposite” trajectories are tangent to the same straight line through the
origin. This is the situation in Fig. 5.3.6, in which the trajectories are straight lines,
not merely tangent to straight lines; indeed, a proper node might be called a “star
point.” However, in Fig. 5.3.2, all trajectories—apart from those that ﬂow along the
line l1—are tangent to the line l2; as a result we call the node improper.
Further, if every trajectory for the system x0 D Ax approaches the origin as
t ! C1 (as in Fig. 5.3.2), then the origin is called a sink; if instead every tra-
jectory recedes from the origin, then the origin is a source. Thus we describe the
characteristic pattern of the trajectories in Fig. 5.3.2 as an improper nodal sink.

Our gallery Fig. 5.3.16 shows a more complete set of solution curves, together with a direc-
tion ﬁeld, for the system x0 D Ax with A given by Eq. (12).
The case of distinct positive eigenvalues mirrors that of distinct negative eigen-
values. But instead of analyzing it independently, we can rely on the following
principle, whose veriﬁcation is a routine matter of checking signs (Problem 30).
PRINCIPLE
Time Reversal in Linear Systems
Let x.t/ be a solution of the 2-dimensional linear system
x0 D Ax
(1)
Then the function Qx.t/ D x.t/ is a solution of the system
Qx0 D AQx:
(14)
We note furthermore that the two vector-valued functions x.t/ and Qx.t/ for
1 < t < 1 have the same solution curve (or image) in the plane. However,
the chain rule gives Qx0.t/ D x0.t/; since Qx.t/ and x.t/ represent the same point, it
follows that at each point of their common solution curve the velocity vectors of the
two functions x.t/ and Qx.t/ are negatives of each other. Therefore the two solutions
traverse their common solution curve in opposite directions as t increases—or, al-
ternatively, in the same direction as t increases for one solution and decreases for
the other. In short, we may say that the solutions of the systems (1) and (14) corre-
spond to each other under “time reversal,” since we get the solutions of one system
by letting time “run backwards” in the solutions of the other.
DISTINCT POSITIVE EIGENVALUES:
If the matrix A has positive eigenvalues
with 0 < 2 < 1, then as you can verify (Problem 31), the matrix A has negative
eigenvalues 1 < 2 < 0 but the same eigenvectors v1 and v2. The preceding case
then shows that the system x0 D Ax has an improper nodal sink at the origin. But
the system x0 D Ax has the same trajectories, except with the direction of motion
(as t increases) along each solution curve reversed. Thus the origin is now a source,
rather than a sink, for the system x0 D Ax, and we call the origin an improper nodal
source. Figure 5.3.3 illustrates typical solution curves given by x.t/ D c1v1e1t C
c2v2e2t corresponding to nonzero values of the coefﬁcients c1 and c2.

in the system x0 D Ax ; thus A is the negative of the matrix in Example 2. Therefore we

Of course, we could also have “started from scratch” by ﬁnding the eigenvalues 1, 2 and
eigenvectors v1, v2 of A. These can be found from the deﬁnition of eigenvalue, but it is easier
to note (see Problem 31 again) that because A is the negative of the matrix in Eq. (12), 1
and 2 are likewise the negatives of their values in Example 2, whereas we can take v1 and
v2 to be the same as in Example 2. By either means we ﬁnd that 1 D 14 and 2 D 7 (so that

Zero Eigenvalues and Straight-Line Solutions
ONE ZERO AND ONE NEGATIVE EIGENVALUE:
When 1 < 2 D 0, the gen-
eral solution (4) becomes
x.t/ D c1v1e1t C c2v2:
(17)
For any ﬁxed nonzero value of the coefﬁcient c1, the term c1v1e1t in Eq. (17) is
a scalar multiple of the eigenvector v1, and thus (as t varies) travels along the line
l1 passing through the origin and parallel to v1; the direction of travel is toward the
origin as t ! C1 because 1 < 0. If c1 > 0 , for example, then c1v1e1t extends
in the direction of v1, approaching the origin as t increases, and receding from the
origin as t decreases. If instead c1 < 0 , then c1v1e1t extends in the direction
opposite v1 while still approaching the origin as t increases. Loosely speaking, we
can visualize the ﬂow of the term c1v1e1t taken alone as a pair of arrows opposing
each other head-to-head at the origin. The solution curve x.t/ in Eq. (17) is simply
this same trajectory c1v1e1t, then, shifted (or offset) by the constant vector c2v2.
Thus in this case the phase portrait of the system x0 D Ax consists of all lines
parallel to the eigenvector v1, where along each such line the solution ﬂows (from
both directions) toward the line l2 passing through the origin and parallel to v1.
Figure 5.3.4 illustrates typical solution curves corresponding to nonzero values of
the coefﬁcients c1 and c2.

It is noteworthy that each single point represented by a constant vector b lying
on the line l2 represents a constant solution of the system x0 D Ax. Indeed, if b lies
on l2, then b is a scalar multiple k  v2 of the eigenvector v2 of A associated with the
eigenvalue 2 D 0. In this case, the constant-valued solution x.t/  b is given by
Eq. (17) with c1 D 0 and c2 D k. This constant solution, with its “trajectory” being
a single point lying on the line l2, is then the unique solution of the initial value

ONE ZERO AND ONE POSITIVE EIGENVALUE:
When 0 D 2 < 1, the solution
of the system x0 D Ax is again given by
x.t/ D c1v1e1t C c2v2:
(17)
By the principle of time reversal, the trajectories of the system x0 D Ax are identical
to those of the system x0 D Ax, except that they ﬂow in the opposite direction.
Since the eigenvalues 1 and 2 of the matrix A satisfy 1 < 2 D 0, by
the preceding case the trajectories of x0 D Ax are lines parallel to the eigenvector
v1 and ﬂowing toward the line l2 from both directions. Therefore the trajectories
of the system x0 D Ax are lines parallel to v1 and ﬂowing away from the line l2.

Repeated Eigenvalues; Proper and Improper Nodes
REPEATED POSITIVE EIGENVALUE:
As we noted earlier, if the matrix A has
one repeated eigenvalue, then A may or may not have two associated linearly inde-
pendent eigenvectors. Because these two possibilities lead to quite different phase
portraits, we will consider them separately. We let  denote the repeated eigenvalue
of A with  > 0.
With two independent eigenvectors: First, if A does have two linearly inde-
pendent eigenvectors, then it is easy to show (Problem 33) that in fact every nonzero
vector is an eigenvector of A, from which it follows that A must be equal to the
scalar  times the identity matrix of order two, that is,

We could also have arrived at Eq. (25) by starting, as in previous cases, from our

free to take v1 D

trajectories of the system (1) are half-lines, or rays, emanating from the origin and

(because  > 0) ﬂowing away from it. As noted above, the origin in this case repre-
sents a proper node, because no two pairs of “opposite” solution curves are tangent
to the same straight line through the origin. Moreover the origin is also a source
(rather than a sink), and so in this case we call the origin a proper nodal source.
Figure 5.3.6 shows the “exploding star” pattern characteristic of such points.

Without two independent eigenvectors: The remaining possibility is that
the matrix A has a repeated positive eigenvalue yet fails to have two linearly inde-
pendent eigenvectors. In this event the general solution of the system x0 D Ax is
given by Eq. (7) above:
x.t/ D c1v1et C c2.v1t C v2/et:
(7)
Here v1 is an eigenvector of the matrix A associated with the repeated eigenvalue 
and v2 is a (nonzero) “generalized eigenvector” that will be described more fully in
Section 5.5. To analyze this trajectory, we ﬁrst distribute the factor et in Eq. (7),
leading to
x.t/ D c1v1et C c2.v1tet C v2et/:
(28)
Our assumption that  > 0 implies that both et and tet approach zero as t ! 1,
and so by Eq. (28) the solution x.t/ approaches the origin as t ! 1. Except for
the trivial solution given by c1 D c2 D 0, all trajectories given by Eq. (7) “emanate”
from the origin as t increases.
The direction of ﬂow of these curves can be understood from the tangent vec-
tor x0.t/. Rewriting Eq. (28) as
x.t/ D et Œc1v1 C c2.v1t C v2/
and applying the product rule for vector-valued functions gives
x0.t/ D etc2v1 C et Œc1v1 C c2.v1t C v2/
D et.c2v1 C c1v1 C c2v1t C c2v2/:

For t 6D 0, we can factor out t in Eq. (29) and rearrange terms to get

tiple of the vector c2v1 C 1
t .c1v1 C c2v2 C c2v1/, which, if c2 6D 0, approaches

5.3 A Gallery of Solution Curves of Linear Systems

the ﬁxed nonzero multiple c2v1 of the eigenvector v1 as t ! C1 or as t ! 1. In
this case it follows that as t gets larger and larger numerically (in either direction),
the tangent line to the solution curve at the point x.t/—since it is parallel to the tan-
gent vector x0.t/ which approaches c2v1—becomes more and more nearly parallel
to the eigenvector v1. In short, we might say that as t increases numerically, the
point x.t/ on the solution curve moves in a direction that is more and more nearly
parallel to the vector v1, or still more brieﬂy, that near x.t/ the solution curve itself
is virtually parallel to v1.
We conclude that if c2 6D 0, then as t ! 1 the point x.t/ approaches the ori-
gin along the solution curve which is tangent there to the vector v1. But as t ! C1
and the point x.t/ recedes further and further from the origin, the tangent line to the
trajectory at this point tends to differ (in direction) less and less from the (moving)
line through x.t/ that is parallel to the (ﬁxed) vector v1. Speaking loosely but sug-
gestively, we might therefore say that at points sufﬁciently far from the origin, all
trajectories are essentially parallel to the single vector v1.
If instead c2 D 0, then our solution (7) becomes
x.t/ D c1v1et;
(31)
and thus runs along the line l1 passing through the origin and parallel to the eigen-
vector v1. Because  > 0, x.t/ ﬂows away from the origin as t increases; the ﬂow is
in the direction of v1 if c1 > 0, and opposite v1 if c1 < 0.
We can further see the inﬂuence of the coefﬁcient c2 by writing Eq. (7) in yet
a different way:
x.t/ D c1v1et C c2.v1t C v2/et D .c1 C c2t/v1et C c2v2et:
(32)
It follows from Eq. (32) that if c2 6D 0, then the solution curve x.t/ does not cross
the line l1. Indeed, if c2 > 0, then Eq. (32) shows that for all t, the solution curve
x.t/ lies on the same side of l1 as v2, whereas if c2 < 0, then x.t/ lies on the opposite
side of l1.
To see the overall picture, then, suppose for example that the coefﬁcient
c2 > 0. Starting from a large negative value of t, Eq. (30) shows that as t increases,
the direction in which the solution curve x.t/ initially proceeds from the origin is
roughly that of the vector tetc2v1. Since the scalar tetc2 is negative (because
t < 0 and c2 > 0), the direction of the trajectory is opposite that of v1. For large
positive values of t, on the other hand, the scalar tetc2 is positive, and so x.t/
ﬂows in nearly the same direction as v1. Thus, as t increases from 1 to C1,
the solution curve leaves the origin ﬂowing in the direction opposite v1, makes a
“U-turn” as it moves away from the origin, and ultimately ﬂows in the direction of
v1.
Because all nonzero trajectories are tangent at the origin to the line l1, the ori-
gin represents an improper nodal source. Figure 5.3.7 illustrates typical solution

REPEATED NEGATIVE EIGENVALUE:
Once again the principle of time reversal
shows that the solutions x.t/ of the system x0 D Ax are identical to those of x0 D Ax
with t replaced by t; hence these two systems share the same trajectories while
ﬂowing in opposite directions. Further, if the matrix A has the repeated negative
eigenvalue , then the matrix A has the repeated positive eigenvalue  (Problem
31 again). Therefore, to construct phase portraits for the system x0 D Ax when A has
a repeated negative eigenvalue, we simply reverse the directions of the trajectories in
the phase portraits corresponding to a repeated positive eigenvalue. These portraits
are illustrated in Figs. 5.3.8 and 5.3.9. In Fig. 5.3.8 the origin represents a proper
nodal sink, whereas in Fig. 5.3.9 it represents an improper nodal sink.

that the two solutions are indeed equivalent. Our gallery Fig. 5.3.16 shows a more complete

The Special Case of a Repeated Zero Eigenvalue
REPEATED ZERO EIGENVALUE:
Once again the matrix A may or may not have
two linearly independent eigenvectors associated with the repeated eigenvalue
 D 0. If it does, then (using Problem 33 once more) we conclude that every nonzero
vector is an eigenvector of A, that is, that Av D 0  v D 0 for all two-dimensional
vectors v. It follows that A is the zero matrix of order two, that is,
A D

Therefore the system x0 D Ax reduces to x0
1.t/ D x0

x1.t/ and x2.t/ are each constant functions. Thus the general solution of x0 D Ax is
simply

(41)
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants, and the “trajectories” given by Eq. (41) are
simply the ﬁxed points .c1; c2/ in the phase plane.

308
Chapter 5 Linear Systems of Differential Equations
If instead A does not have two linearly independent eigenvectors associated
with  D 0, then the general solution of the system x0 D Ax is given by Eq. (7) with
 D 0:
x.t/ D c1v1 C c2.v1t C v2/ D .c1v1 C c2v2/ C c2v1t:
(42)
Once again v1 denotes an eigenvector of the matrix A associated with the repeated
eigenvalue  D 0 and v2 denotes a corresponding nonzero “generalized eigenvector.”
If c2 6D 0, then the trajectories given by Eq. (42) are lines parallel to the eigenvector
v1 and “starting” at the point c1v1 C c2v2 (when t D 0). When c2 > 0 the trajectory
proceeds in the same direction as v1, whereas when c2 < 0 the solution curve ﬂows
in the direction opposite v1. Once again the lines l1 and l2 passing through the origin
and parallel to the vectors v1 and v2, respectively, divide the plane into “quadrants”
corresponding to the signs of the coefﬁcients c1 and c2. The particular quadrant in
which the “starting point” c1v1 C c2v2 of the trajectory falls is determined by the
signs of c1 and c2. Finally, if c2 D 0, then Eq. (42) gives x.t/  c1v1 for all t, which
means that each ﬁxed point c1v1 along the line l1 corresponds to a solution curve.
(Thus the line l1 could be thought of as a median strip dividing two opposing lanes
of trafﬁc.) Figure 5.3.10 illustrates typical solution curves corresponding to nonzero
values of the coefﬁcients c1 and c2.

Complex Conjugate Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
We turn now to the situation in which the eigenvalues 1 and 2 of the matrix A
are complex conjugate. As we noted at the beginning of this section, the general
solution of the system x0 D Ax is given by Eq. (5):
x.t/ D c1ept.a cos qt  b sin qt/ C c2ept.b cos qt C a sin qt/:
(5)
Here the vectors a and b are the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of a (complex-
valued) eigenvector of A associated with the eigenvalue 1 D p Ciq. We will divide
the case of complex conjugate eigenvalues according to whether the real part p of
1 and 2 is zero, positive, or negative:

Pure imaginary (1, 2 D ˙iq with q 6D 0)

Complex with negative real part (1, 2 D p ˙ iq with p < 0 and q 6D 0)

Complex with positive real part (1, 2 D p ˙ iq with p > 0 and q 6D 0)

This solution curve appears to be an ellipse rotated counterclockwise by the
angle  D arctan 2
4  0:4636. We can verify this by ﬁnding the equations of the
solution curve relative to the rotated u- and v-axes shown in Fig. 5.3.11. By a
standard formula from analytic geometry, these new equations are given by

Equation (53) not only conﬁrms that the solution curve in Eq. (51) is indeed an
ellipse rotated by the angle  , but it also shows that the lengths of the semi-major
and semi-minor axes of the ellipse are 2
p
5 and
p
5, respectively.
Furthermore, we can demonstrate that any choice of initial point (apart from
the origin) leads to a solution curve that is an ellipse rotated by the same angle  and
“concentric” (in an obvious sense) with the trajectory in Fig. 5.3.11 (see Problems
35–37). All these concentric rotated ellipses are centered at the origin .0; 0/, which
is therefore called a center for the system x0 D Ax whose coefﬁcient matrix A has
pure imaginary eigenvalues. Our gallery Fig. 5.3.16 shows a more complete set of
solution curves, together with a direction ﬁeld, for the system x0 D Ax with A given
by Eq. (47).
Further investigation: Geometric signiﬁcance of the eigenvector. Our general
solution in Eq. (50) was based upon the vectors a and b in Eq. (49), that is, the real
and imaginary parts of the complex eigenvector v D

 3 C 5i
4 T of the matrix A.
We might therefore expect a and b to have some clear geometric connection to the
solution curve in Fig. 5.3.11. For example, we might guess that a and b would be
parallel to the major and minor axes of the elliptical trajectory. However, it is clear
from Fig. 5.3.12—which shows the vectors a and b together with the solution curve
given by Eq. (51)—that this is not the case. Do the eigenvectors of A, then, play
any geometric role in the phase portrait of the system x0 D Ax?
The (afﬁrmative) answer lies in the fact that any nonzero real or complex
multiple of a complex eigenvector of the matrix A is still an eigenvector of A as-

sociated with that eigenvalue. Perhaps, then, if we multiply the eigenvector v D

4 T by a suitable nonzero complex constant ´, the resulting eigenvector
Qv will have real and imaginary parts Qa and Qb that can be readily identiﬁed with ge-
ometric features of the ellipse. To this end, let us multiply v by the complex scalar

It is clear that the vector Qb is parallel to the major axis of our elliptical trajectory.
Further, you can easily check that Qa  Qb D 0, which means that Qa is perpendicular
to Qb, and hence is parallel to the minor axis of the ellipse, as Fig. 5.3.12 illustrates.
Moreover, the length of Qb is twice that of Qa, reﬂecting the fact that the lengths of
the major and minor axes of the ellipse are in this same ratio. Thus for a matrix A
with pure imaginary eigenvalues, the complex eigenvector of A used in the general
solution (45)—if suitably chosen—is indeed of great signiﬁcance to the geometry
of the elliptical solution curves of the system x0 D Ax.
How was the value 1
2.1 C i/ chosen for the scalar ´? In order that the real
and imaginary parts Qa and Qb of Qv D ´  v be parallel to the axes of the ellipse, at a
minimum Qa and Qb must be perpendicular to each other. In Problem 38 we ask you
to show that this condition is satisﬁed if and only if ´ is of the form r.1 ˙ i/, where
r is a nonzero real number, and that if ´ is chosen in this way, then Qa and Qb are in
fact parallel to the axes of the ellipse. The value r D 1
2 then aligns the lengths of
Qa and Qb with those of the semi-minor and -major axes of the elliptical trajectory.
More generally, we can show that given any eigenvector v of a matrix A with pure
imaginary eigenvalues, there exists a constant ´ such that the real and imaginary
parts Qa and Qb of the eigenvector Qv D ´  v are parallel to the axes of the (elliptical)
trajectories of the system x0 D Ax.
Further investigation: Direction of ﬂow. Figs. 5.3.11 and 5.3.12 suggest that the
solution curve in Eq. (51) ﬂows in a counterclockwise direction with increasing t.
However, you can check that the matrix
A D
 6
17
8


has the same eigenvalues and eigenvectors as the matrix A in Eq. (47) itself, and yet
(by the principle of time reversal) the trajectories of the system x0 D Ax are iden-
tical to those of x0 D Ax while ﬂowing in the opposite direction, that is, clockwise.
Clearly, mere knowledge of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A is not
sufﬁcient to predict the direction of ﬂow of the elliptical trajectories of the system
x0 D Ax as t increases. How then can we determine this direction of ﬂow?
One simple approach is to use the tangent vector x0 to monitor the direction in
which the solution curves ﬂow as they cross the positive x1-axis. If s is any positive
number (so that the point .s; 0/ lies on the positive x1-axis), and if the matrix A is
given by
A D

then any trajectory for the system x0 D Ax passing through .s; 0/ satisﬁes

at the point .s; 0/. Therefore, at this point the direction of ﬂow of the solution curve
is a positive scalar multiple of the vector

 a
c T . Since c cannot be zero (see
Problem 39), this vector either points “upward” into the ﬁrst quadrant of the phase
plane (if c > 0 ), or “downward” into the fourth quadrant (if c < 0). If upward, then
the ﬂow of the solution curve is counterclockwise; if downward, then clockwise.
For the matrix A in Eq. (47), the vector

 a
c T D

 6
8 T points into the ﬁrst
quadrant because c D 8 > 0, thus indicating a counterclockwise direction of ﬂow
(as Figs. 5.3.11 and 5.3.12 suggest).

Now we assume that
the eigenvalues of the matrix A are given by 1, 2 D p ˙ iq with q 6D 0 and p < 0.
In this case the general solution of the system x0 D Ax is given directly by Eq. (5):
x.t/ D c1ept.a cos qt  b sin qt/ C c2ept.b cos qt C a sin qt/;

where the vectors a and b have their usual meaning. Once again we begin with an

trajectory in Eq. (51). The equations for x1.t/ and x2.t/ in (58) are obtained by
multiplying their counterparts in (51) by the common factor et, which is positive
and decreasing with increasing t. Thus for positive values of t, the spiral trajectory
is generated, so to speak, by standing at the origin and “reeling in” the point on the
elliptical trajectory (51) as it is traced out. When t is negative, the picture is rather

one of “casting away” the point on the ellipse farther out from the origin to create
the corresponding point on the spiral.
Our gallery Fig. 5.3.16 shows a more complete set of solution curves, together
with a direction ﬁeld, for the system x0 D Ax with A given by Eq. (55). Because the
solution curves all “spiral into” the origin, we call the origin in this a case a spiral
sink.
COMPLEX EIGENVALUES WITH POSITIVE REAL PART:
We conclude with the
case where the eigenvalues of the matrix A are given by 1, 2 D p ˙ iq with q 6D 0
and p > 0. Just as in the preceding case, the general solution of the system x0 D Ax
is given by Eq. (5):

The dashed and solid portions of the

therefore, the solution of the initial value problem (59) is given by simply replacing t with t
in the right-hand sides of the solution (58) of the initial value problem in that example:
x1.t/ D et.4 cos 10t C sin 10t/;

Figure 5.3.14 shows the trajectory given by Eq. (61) together with the initial
point .4; 2/. Our gallery Fig. 5.3.16 shows this solution curve together with a direc-
tion ﬁeld for the system x0 D Ax with A given by Eq. (60). Because the solution
curve “spirals away from” the origin, we call the origin in this case a spiral source.

To portray the motion in space of a point x.t/ moving on a trajectory of this system,
we can regard this trajectory as a necklace string on which colored beads are placed
to mark its successive positions at ﬁxed increments of time (so the point is moving
fastest where the spacing between beads is greatest). In order to aid the eye in
following the moving point’s progress, the size of the beads decreases continuously
with the passage of time and motion along the trajectory.

origin as t ! 0 (as illustrated by the beads on the vertical axis of the ﬁgure). Thus
the origin .0; 0; 0/ is a sink that “attracts” all the trajectories of the system.
The complex conjugate eigenvalues with negative real part correspond to tra-
jectories in the horizontal x1x2-plane that spiral around the origin while approaching
it. Any other trajectory—one which starts at a point lying neither on the ´-axis nor in
the x1x2-plane—combines the preceding behaviors by spiraling around the surface
of a cone while approaching the origin at its vertex.

Chapter 5 Linear Systems of Differential Equations
shows the phase portrait of the system x0 D Ax with A given by Eq. (3). Not only are
the initial conditions of the individual trajectories controlled independently by the
“locator points,” but using the slider we can also vary the value of k continuously
from 1 to 1, with the solution curves being instantly redrawn. Thus for a ﬁxed
value of k we can experiment with changing initial conditions throughout the phase
plane, or, conversely, we can hold the initial conditions ﬁxed and observe the effect
of changing the value of k.
As a further example of what such a display can reveal, Fig. 5.3.22 consists
of a series of snapshots of Fig. 5.3.21 where the initial conditions are held ﬁxed and
k progresses through the speciﬁc values 1, 0:25, 0, 0.5, 0.65, and 1. The result
is a “video” showing stages in a transition from a saddle point with “hyperbolic”
trajectories, to a pair of parallel lines, to an improper nodal source with “parabolic”
trajectories, and ﬁnally to the exploding star pattern of a proper nodal source with
straight-line trajectories. Perhaps these frames provide a new interpretation of the
description “dynamical system” for a collection of interdependent differential equa-
tions.

5.4 Second-Order Systems and Mechanical Applications

In this section we apply the matrix methods of Sections 5.1 and 5.2 to investigate
the oscillations of typical mass-and-spring systems having two or more degrees of
freedom. Our examples are chosen to illustrate phenomena that are generally char-
acteristic of complex mechanical systems.
 This optional section may be omitted without loss of continuity. It provides a sample of the more
technical applications of eigenvalues to physics and engineering problems.

the four indicated springs. We assume that the masses slide without friction and
that each spring obeys Hooke’s law—its extension or compression x and force F
of reaction are related by the formula F D kx. If the rightward displacements x1,
x2, and x3 of the three masses (from their respective equilibrium positions) are all
positive, then

The ﬁrst spring is stretched the distance x1;

The second spring is stretched the distance x2  x1;

The third spring is stretched the distance x3  x2;

The fourth spring is compressed the distance x3.
Therefore, application of Newton’s law F D ma to the three masses (as in Example
1 of Section 4.1) yields their equations of motion:
m1x00
1 D k1x1
C k2.x2  x1/,

2 D k2.x2  x1/ C k3.x3  x2/,
m3x00
3 D k3.x3  x2/  k4x3.
(1)
Although we assumed in writing these equations that the displacements of the
masses are all positive, they actually follow similarly from Hooke’s and Newton’s
laws, whatever the signs of these displacements.

for the mass and stiffness matrices in Eq. (4).
The diagonal matrix M is obviously nonsingular; to get its inverse M1 we
need only replace each diagonal element with its reciprocal. Hence multiplication
of each side in Eq. (4) by M1 yields the homogeneous second-order system
x00 D Ax;
(7)
where A D M1K. There is a wide variety of frictionless mechanical systems for
which a displacement or position vector x, a nonsingular mass matrix M, and a
stiffness matrix K satisfying Eq. (4) can be deﬁned.
Solution of Second-Order Systems
To seek a solution of Eq. (7), we substitute (as in Section 5.2 for a ﬁrst-order system)
a trial solution of the form
x.t/ D ve˛t;
(8)
where v is a constant vector. Then x00 D ˛2ve˛t, so substitution of Eq. (8) in (7)
gives
˛2ve˛t D Ave˛t;
which implies that
Av D ˛2v:
(9)
Therefore x.t/ D ve˛t is a solution of x00 D Ax if and only if ˛2 D , an eigenvalue
of the matrix A, and v is an associated eigenvector.
If x00 D Ax models a mechanical system, then it is typical that the eigenvalues
of A are negative real numbers. If
˛2 D  D !2 < 0;
then ˛ D ˙!i. In this case the solution given by Eq. (8) is
x.t/ D vei!t D v.cos !t C i sin !t/:
The real and imaginary parts
x1.t/ D v cos !t
and
x2.t/ D v sin !t
(10)
of x.t/ are then linearly independent real-valued solutions of the system. This anal-
ysis leads to the following theorem.

(12)
is the corresponding part of the general solution.
Remark The nonzero vector v0 is an eigenvector corresponding to 0 D 0 provided that
Av0 D 0. If x.t/ D .a0 C b0t/v0, then
x00 D 0  v0 D .a0 C b0t/  0 D .a0 C b0t/  .Av0/ D Ax;
thus verifying the form in Eq. (12).
Example 1
Consider the mass-and-spring system with n D 2 shown in Fig. 5.4.3. Because there is no
third spring connected to a right-hand wall, we set k3 D 0. If m1 D 2, m2 D 1, k1 D 100, and
k2 D 50, then the equation Mx00 D Kx is

To determine a particular solution, let us suppose that the leftmost car is moving to the right
with velocity v0 and at time t D 0 strikes the other two cars, which are together but at rest.
The corresponding initial conditions are
x1.0/ D x2.0/ D x3.0/ D 0;
(24a)
x0
1.0/ D v0;
x0
2.0/ D x0
3.0/ D 0:
(24b)
Then substitution of (24a) in (23) gives the scalar equations
a1 C a2 C a3 D 0,
a1
 3a3 D 0,
a1  a2 C a3 D 0,
which readily yield a1 D a2 D a3 D 0. Hence the position functions of the three cars are
x1.t/ D b1t C b2 sin 2t C b3 sin 4t,
x2.t/ D b1t
 3b3 sin 4t,
x3.t/ D b1t  b2 sin 2t C b3 sin 4t,
(25)
and their velocity functions are
x0
1.t/ D b1 C 2b2 cos 2t C 4b3 cos 4t;
x0
2.t/ D b1
 12b3 cos 4t,
x0
3.t/ D b1  2b2 cos 2t C 4b3 cos 4t.
(26)
Substitution of (24b) in (26) gives the equations
b1 C 2b2 C 4b3 D v0,
b1
 12b3 D 0,
b1  2b2 C 4b3 D 0
that readily yield b1 D 3
8v0, b2 D 1
4v0, and b3 D 1
32v0. Finally, the position functions in (25)
are

x3.t/ D

(27)
But these equations hold only so long as the two buffer springs remain compressed;
that is, while both
x2  x1 < 0
and
x3  x2 < 0:
To discover what this implies about t, we compute

engagement occurs at time t D =2. Thereafter, cars 1 and 2 remain at rest (!), while car 3
continues to the right with speed v0. If, for instance, v0 D 48 feet per second (about 33 miles

Forced Oscillations and Resonance
Suppose now that the ith mass of the mass-and-spring system in Fig. 5.4.2 is subject
to an external force Fi (i D 1; 2; : : : ; n) in addition to the forces exerted by the
springs attached to it. Then the homogeneous equation Mx00 D Kx is replaced with
the nonhomogeneous equation
Mx00 D Kx C F;
(28)
where F D

Fn
T is the external force vector for the system. Mul-
tiplication by M1 yields
x00 D Ax C f;
(29)
where f is the external force vector per unit mass. We are especially interested in
the case of a periodic external force
f.t/ D F0 cos !t
(30)

330
Chapter 5 Linear Systems of Differential Equations
(where F0 is a constant vector). We then anticipate a periodic particular solution
xp.t/ D c cos !t
(31)
with the known external frequency ! and with a coefﬁcient vector c yet to be deter-
mined. Because x00
p D !2c cos !t, substitution of (30) and (31) in (29), followed
by cancellation of the common factor cos !t, gives the linear system
.A C !2I/c D F0
(32)
to be solved for c.
Observe that the matrix A C !2I is nonsingular—in which case Eq. (32) can
be solved for c—unless !2 D , an eigenvalue of A. Thus a periodic particular
solution of the form in Eq. (31) exists provided that the external forcing frequency
does not equal one of the natural frequencies !1; !2; : : : ; !n of the system. The case
in which ! is a natural frequency corresponds to the phenomenon of resonance
discussed in Section 3.6.
Example 3
Suppose that the second mass in Example 1 is subjected to the external periodic force
50 cos !t. Then with m1 D 2, m2 D 1, k1 D 100, k2 D 50, and F0 D 50 in Fig. 5.4.9,

(35)
For instance, if the external squared frequency is !2 D 50, then (35) yields c1 D 1,
c2 D 1. The resulting forced periodic oscillation is described by
x1.t/ D  cos !t;
x2.t/ D  cos !t:
Thus the two masses oscillate in synchrony with equal amplitudes and in the same direction.
If the external squared frequency is !2 D 125, then (35) yields c1 D 1
2, c2 D 1. The
resulting forced periodic oscillation is described by
x1.t/ D 1
2 cos !t;
x2.t/ D  cos !t;
and now the two masses oscillate in synchrony in opposite directions, but with the amplitude
of motion of m2 twice that of m1.
It is evident from the denominators in (35) that c1 and c2 approach C1 as ! ap-
proaches either of the two natural frequencies !1 D 5 and !2 D 10 (found in Example
1). Figure 5.4.10 shows a plot of the amplitude

Periodic and Transient Solutions
It follows from Theorem 4 of Section 5.1 that a particular solution of the forced
system
x00 D Ax C F0 cos !t
(36)
will be of the form
x.t/ D xc.t/ C xp.t/;
(37)
where xp.t/ is a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous system and xc.t/ is a
solution of the corresponding homogeneous system. It is typical for the effects of
frictional resistance in mechanical systems to damp out the complementary function
solution xc.t/, so that
xc.t/ ! 0
as
t ! C1:
(38)
Hence xc.t/ is a transient solution that depends only on the initial conditions; it
dies out with time, leaving the steady periodic solution xp.t/ resulting from the
external driving force:
x.t/ ! xp.t/
as
t ! C1:
(39)
As a practical matter, every physical system includes frictional resistance (however
small) that damps out transient solutions in this manner.

the mass m1 will remain at rest(!). Thus the effect of the

fect of the force on the ﬁrst mass. This is an example of
a dynamic damper. It has an electrical analogy that some
cable companies use to prevent your reception of certain
cable channels.

The Two-Axle Automobile
In Example 4 of Section 3.6 we investigated the vertical oscil-
lations of a one-axle car—actually a unicycle. Now we can
analyze a more realistic model: a car with two axles and with
separate front and rear suspension systems. Figure 5.4.14 rep-
resents the suspension system of such a car. We assume that
the car body acts as would a solid bar of mass m and length
L D L1 C L2. It has moment of inertia I about its center of
mass C, which is at distance L1 from the front of the car. The
car has front and back suspension springs with Hooke’s con-
stants k1 and k2, respectively. When the car is in motion, let
x.t/ denote the vertical displacement of the center of mass of

ment (in radians) from the horizontal. Then Newton’s laws of

Then calculate the entries in the remaining columns of the table showing the nat-

typical earthquake producing ground oscillations with a period of 2 seconds is un-
comfortably close to the ﬁfth natural frequency (with period 1:9869 seconds) of the

versus the period of the earthquake vibrations. The spikes correspond to the ﬁrst
six of the seven resonant frequencies. We see, for instance, that whereas an earth-
quake with period 2 (s) likely would produce destructive resonance vibrations in
the building, it probably would be unharmed by an earthquake with period 2:5 (s).
Different buildings have different natural frequencies of vibration, and so a given
earthquake may demolish one building but leave untouched the one next door. This
seeming anomaly was observed in Mexico City after the devastating earthquake of
September 19, 1985.
For your personal seven-story building to investigate, let the weight (in tons)
of each story equal the largest digit of your student ID number and let k (in tons=ft)
equal the smallest nonzero digit. Produce numerical and graphical results like those
illustrated in Figs. 5.4.17 and 5.4.18. Is your building susceptible to likely damage
from an earthquake with period in the 2- to 3-second range?
You might like to begin by working manually the following warm-up prob-
lems.
1. Find the periods of the natural vibrations of a building with two above-ground
ﬂoors, each weighing 16 tons and with each restoring force being k D 5
tons=ft.
2. Find the periods of the natural vibrations of a building with three above-
ground ﬂoors, with each weighing 16 tons and with each restoring force being
k D 5 tons=ft.

3. Find the natural frequencies and natural modes of vibration of a building with
three above-ground ﬂoors as in Problem 2, except that the upper two ﬂoors
weigh 8 tons each instead of 16. Give the ratios of the amplitudes A, B, and
C of oscillations of the three ﬂoors in the form A:B :C with A D 1.
4. Suppose that the building of Problem 3 is subject to an earthquake in which
the ground undergoes horizontal sinusoidal oscillations with a period of 3 s
and an amplitude of 3 in. Find the amplitudes of the resulting steady periodic
oscillations of the three above-ground ﬂoors. Assume the fact that a motion
E sin !t of the ground, with acceleration a D E!2 sin !t, produces an op-
posite inertial force F D ma D mE!2 sin !t on a ﬂoor of mass m.
5.5 Multiple Eigenvalue Solutions
In Section 5.2 we saw that if the n  n matrix A has n distinct (real or complex)
eigenvalues 1, 2, : : : ; n with respective associated eigenvectors v1, v2, : : : ; vn,
then a general solution of the system
dx
dt D Ax
(1)
is given by
x.t/ D c1v1e1t C c2v2e2t C    C cnvnent
(2)
with arbitrary constants c1, c2, : : : ; cn. In this section we discuss the situation when
the characteristic equation
jA  Ij D 0
(3)
does not have n distinct roots, and thus has at least one repeated root.
An eigenvalue is of multiplicity k if it is a k-fold root of Eq. (3). For each
eigenvalue , the eigenvector equation
.A  I/v D 0
(4)
has at least one nonzero solution v, so there is at least one eigenvector associated
with . But an eigenvalue of multiplicity k > 1 may have fewer than k linearly
independent associated eigenvectors. In this case we are unable to ﬁnd a “complete
set” of n linearly independent eigenvectors of A, as needed to form the general
solution in (2).
Let us call an eigenvalue of multiplicity k complete if it has k linearly in-
dependent associated eigenvectors. If every eigenvalue of the matrix A is com-

independent—it follows that A does have a complete set of n linearly independent
eigenvectors v1, v2, : : : ; vn associated with the eigenvalues 1, 2, : : : ; n (each
repeated with its multiplicity). In this case a general solution of x0 D Ax is still

would be equivalent to the one in Eq. (7). Thus we need not worry about making the “right”

do; we generally make the simplest one we can.

complete.

Hence b D a if v D

b T is to be an eigenvector of A. Therefore any eigenvector
associated with 1 D 4 is a nonzero multiple of v D

 1
1 T . Thus the multiplicity 2
eigenvalue 1 D 4 has only one independent eigenvector, and hence is incomplete.
An eigenvalue  of multiplicity k > 1 is called defective if it is not complete.
If  has only p < k linearly independent eigenvectors, then the number
d D k  p
(9)
of “missing” eigenvectors is called the defect of the defective eigenvalue . Thus
the defective eigenvalue 1 D 4 in Example 2 has multiplicity k D 2 and defect
d D 1, because we saw that it has only p D 1 associated eigenvector.
If the eigenvalues of the n  n matrix A are not all complete, then the eigen-
value method as yet described will produce fewer than the needed n linearly inde-
pendent solutions of the system x0 D Ax. We therefore need to discover how to ﬁnd
the “missing solutions” corresponding to a defective eigenvalue  of multiplicity
k > 1.

338
Chapter 5 Linear Systems of Differential Equations
The Case of Multiplicity k D 2
Let us begin with the case k D 2, and suppose that we have found (as in Example 2)
that there is only a single eigenvector v1 associated with the defective eigenvalue .
Then at this point we have found only the single solution
x1.t/ D v1et
(10)
of x0 D Ax. By analogy with the case of a repeated characteristic root for a single
linear differential equation (Section 3.3), we might hope to ﬁnd a second solution
of the form
x2.t/ D .v2t/et D v2tet:
(11)
When we substitute x D v2tet in x0 D Ax, we get the equation
v2et C v2tet D Av2tet:
But because the coefﬁcients of both et and tet must balance, it follows that v2 D 0,
and hence that x2.t/  0. This means that—contrary to our hope—the system
x0 D Ax does not have a nontrivial solution of the form assumed in (11).
Instead of simply giving up on the idea behind Eq. (11), let us extend it slightly
and replace v2t with v1t C v2. Thus we explore the possibility of a second solution
of the form
x2.t/ D .v1t C v2/et D v1tet C v2et
(12)
where v1 and v2 are nonzero constant vectors. When we substitute x D v1tet C
v2et in x0 D Ax, we get the equation
v1et C v1tet C v2et D Av1tet C Av2et:
(13)
We equate coefﬁcients of et and tet here, and thereby obtain the two equations
.A  I/v1 D 0
(14)
and
.A  I/v2 D v1
(15)
that the vectors v1 and v2 must satisfy in order for (12) to give a solution of x0 D Ax.
Note that Eq. (14) merely conﬁrms that v1 is an eigenvector of A associated
with the eigenvalue . Then Eq. (15) says that the vector v2 satisﬁes the equation
.A  I/2v2 D .A  I/Œ.A  I/v2 D .A  I/v1 D 0:
It follows that, in order to solve simultaneously the two equations in (14) and (15),
it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a solution v2 of the single equation .A  I/2v2 D 0 such that the
resulting vector v1 D .A  I/v2 is nonzero. It turns out that this is always possible
if the defective eigenvalue  of A is of multiplicity 2. Consequently, the procedure
described in the following algorithm always succeeds in ﬁnding two independent
solutions associated with such an eigenvalue.

Generalized Eigenvectors
The vector v2 in Eq. (16) is an example of a generalized eigenvector. If  is an
eigenvalue of the matrix A, then a rank r generalized eigenvector associated with
 is a vector v such that
.A  I/rv D 0
but
.A  I/r1v ¤ 0:
(21)
If r D 1, then (21) simply means that v is an eigenvector associated with  (recalling
the convention that the 0th power of a square matrix is the identity matrix). Thus a
rank 1 generalized eigenvector is an ordinary eigenvector. The vector v2 in (16) is a
rank 2 generalized eigenvector (and not an ordinary eigenvector).
The multiplicity 2 method described earlier boils down to ﬁnding a pair
fv1; v2g of generalized eigenvectors, one of rank 1 and one of rank 2, such that
.A  I/v2 D v1. Higher multiplicity methods involve longer “chains” of gener-
alized eigenvectors. A length k chain of generalized eigenvectors based on the
eigenvector v1 is a set fv1; v2; : : : ; vkg of k generalized eigenvectors such that
.A  I/vk D vk1;
.A  I/vk1 D vk2;
:::
.A  I/v2 D v1:
(22)
Because v1 is an ordinary eigenvector, .A  I/v1 D 0. Therefore, it follows from
(22) that
.A  I/kvk D 0:
(23)
If fv1; v2; v3g is a length 3 chain of generalized eigenvectors associated with
the multiple eigenvalue  of the matrix A, then it is easy to verify that three linearly
independent solutions of x0 D Ax are given by
x1.t/ D v1et;
x2.t/ D .v1t C v2/et;
x3.t/ D

Consequently, in order to “handle” a multiplicity 3 eigenvalue , it sufﬁces
to ﬁnd a length 3 chain fv1; v2; v3g of generalized eigenvalues associated with .
Looking at Eq. (23), we see that we need only ﬁnd a solution v3 of
.A  I/3v3 D 0
such that the vectors
v2 D .A  I/v3
and
v1 D .A  I/v2

The General Case
A fundamental theorem of linear algebra states that every n  n matrix A has n
linearly independent generalized eigenvectors. These n generalized eigenvectors
may be arranged in chains, with the sum of the lengths of the chains associated
with a given eigenvalue  equal to the multiplicity of . But the structure of these
chains depends on the defect of , and can be quite complicated. For instance, a
multiplicity 4 eigenvalue can correspond to

Four length 1 chains (defect 0);

Two length 1 chains and a length 2 chain (defect 1);

Two length 2 chains (defect 2);

A length 1 chain and a length 3 chain (defect 2); or

A length 4 chain (defect 3).
Note that, in each of these cases, the length of the longest chain is at most d C 1,
where d is the defect of the eigenvalue. Consequently, once we have found all the
ordinary eigenvectors associated with a multiple eigenvalue , and therefore know
the defect d of , we can begin with the equation
.A  I/dC1u D 0
(26)
to start building the chains of generalized eigenvectors associated with .
ALGORITHM
Chains of Generalized Eigenvectors
Begin with a nonzero solution u1 of Eq. (26) and successively multiply by the
matrix A  I until the zero vector is obtained. If
.A  I/u1 D u2 ¤ 0;
:::
.A  I/uk1 D uk ¤ 0;
but .A  I/uk D 0, then the vectors
fv1; v2; : : : ; vkg D fuk; uk1; : : : ; u2; u1g
(listed in reverse order of their appearance) form a length k chain of generalized
eigenvectors based on the (ordinary) eigenvector v1.

5.5 Multiple Eigenvalue Solutions
343
Each length k chain fv1; v2; : : : ; vkg of generalized eigenvectors (with v1 an
ordinary eigenvector associated with ) determines a set of k independent solutions
of x0 D Ax corresponding to the eigenvalue :

Note that (27) reduces to Eqs. (18) through (19) and (24) in the cases k D 2 and
k D 3, respectively.
To ensure that we obtain n generalized eigenvectors of the n  n matrix A that
are actually linearly independent, and therefore produce a complete set of n linearly
independent solutions of x0 D Ax when we amalgamate all the “chains of solutions”
corresponding to different chains of generalized eigenvectors, we may rely on the
following two facts:

Any chain of generalized eigenvectors constitutes a linearly independent set
of vectors.

If two chains of generalized eigenvectors are based on linearly independent
eigenvectors, then the union of these two chains is a linearly independent set
of vectors (whether the two base eigenvectors are associated with different
eigenvalues or with the same eigenvalue).
Example 5
Suppose that the 6  6 matrix A has two multiplicity 3 eigenvalues 1 D 2 and 2 D 3
with defects 1 and 2, respectively. Then 1 must have an associated eigenvector u1 and a
length 2 chain fv1; v2g of generalized eigenvectors (with the eigenvectors u1 and v1 being
linearly independent), whereas 2 must have a length 3 chain fw1; w2; w3g of generalized
eigenvectors based on its single eigenvector w1. The six generalized eigenvectors u1, v1,
v2, w1, w2, and w3 are then linearly independent and yield the following six independent
solutions of x0 D Ax:
x1.t/ D u1e2t;
x2.t/ D v1e2t;
x3.t/ D .v1t C v2/e2t;

As Example 5 illustrates, the computation of independent solutions corre-
sponding to different eigenvalues and chains of generalized eigenvalues is a routine
matter. The determination of the chain structure associated with a given multiple
eigenvalue can be more interesting (as in Example 6).

We can choose a and b independently, then solve for c and d. Thereby we obtain two eigen-

we can choose any linear combination of u1 and u2 that is independent of v1. For instance,
we could choose either w1 D u1 or w1 D u2. However, we will see momentarily that the

The four scalar components of the general solution

are described by the equations
x1.t/ D c1 C e2t.c2 C c3 C c4t/;
x2.t/ D c1 C e2t.c2  c3  c4t/;

x4.t/ D e2t.2c2 C 2c3  c4 C 2c4t/:

Recall that x1.t/ and x2.t/ are the position functions of the two masses, whereas x3.t/ D x0
1.t/
and x4.t/ D x0
2.t/ are their respective velocity functions.
For instance, suppose that x1.0/ D x2.0/ D 0 and that x0

In this case the two railway cars continue in the same direction with equal but exponentially
damped velocities, approaching the displacements x1 D x2 D 1

It is of interest to interpret physically the individual generalized eigenvector solutions
given in (33). The degenerate (0 D 0) solution
x1.t/ D

describes the two masses at rest with position functions x1.t/  1 and x2.t/  1. The solution

corresponding to the carefully chosen eigenvector w1 describes damped motions x1.t/ D

the solutions x3.t/ and x4.t/ resulting from the length 2 chain fv1; v2g both describe damped
motion with the two masses moving in opposite directions.
The methods of this section apply to complex multiple eigenvalues just as to
real multiple eigenvalues (although the necessary computations tend to be somewhat
lengthy). Given a complex conjugate pair ˛ ˙ ˇi of eigenvalues of multiplicity k,
we work with one of them (say, ˛  ˇi) as if it were real to ﬁnd k independent
complex-valued solutions. The real and imaginary parts of these complex-valued
solutions then provide 2k real-valued solutions associated with the two eigenvalues
 D ˛  ˇi and  D ˛ C ˇi each of multiplicity k. See Problems 33 and 34.

of Problem 31 in this section. When the matrix A has been entered, the Maple
calculation
with(linalg):
eigenvectors(A);
[1, 4, {[--1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 3, 0]}]
or the Mathematica calculation
Eigensystem[A]
{{1,1,1,1},
{{--3,--1,0,3}, {0,1,3,0}, {0,0,0,0}, {0,0,0,0}}}
reveals that the matrix A in Eq. (1) has the single eigenvalue  D 1 of multiplic-
ity 4 with only two independent associated eigenvectors v1 and v2. The MATLAB
command
[V, D] = eig(sym(A))
provides the same information. The eigenvalue  D 1 therefore has defect d D 2. If
B D A  .1/I, you should ﬁnd that B2 6D 0 but B3 D 0. If

then fu1; u2; u3g should be a length 3 chain of generalized eigenvectors based on
the ordinary eigenvector u3 (which should be a linear combination of the original
eigenvectors v1 and v2). Use your computer algebra system to carry out this con-
struction, and ﬁnally write four linearly independent solutions of the linear system
x0 D Ax.

Use appropriate commands like those illustrated here to show that A has a single
eigenvalue  D 0 of multiplicity 5 and defect 4. Noting that A  .0/I D A, you
should ﬁnd that A4 6D 0 but that A5 D 0. Hence calculate the vectors

u5 D Au4:
You should ﬁnd that u5 is a nonzero vector such that Au5 D 0, and is there-
fore an (ordinary) eigenvector of A associated with the eigenvalue  D 0. Thus
fu1; u2; u3; u4; u5g is a length 5 chain of generalized eigenvectors of the matrix A
in Eq. (2), and you can ﬁnally write ﬁve linearly independent solutions of the linear
system x0 D Ax.

Chapter 5 Linear Systems of Differential Equations
Fundamental Matrix Solutions
Because the column vector x D xj .t/ of the fundamental matrix ˆ.t/ in (2) satisﬁes
the differential equation x0 D Ax, it follows (from the deﬁnition of matrix multi-
plication) that the matrix X D ˆ.t/ itself satisﬁes the matrix differential equation
X0 D AX. Because its column vectors are linearly independent, it also follows that
the fundamental matrix ˆ.t/ is nonsingular, and therefore has an inverse matrix
ˆ.t/1. Conversely, any nonsingular matrix solution ‰.t/ of Eq. (10) has linearly
independent column vectors that satisfy Eq. (1), so ‰.t/ is a fundamental matrix for
the system in (1).
In terms of the fundamental matrix ˆ.t/ in (2), the general solution
x.t/ D c1x1.t/ C c2x2.t/ C    C cnxn.t/

Exponential Matrices
We now discuss the possibility of constructing a fundamental matrix for the
constant-coefﬁcient linear system x0 D Ax directly from the coefﬁcient matrix A—
that is, without ﬁrst applying the methods of earlier sections to ﬁnd a linearly inde-
pendent set of solution vectors.
We have seen that exponential functions play a central role in the solution of
linear differential equations and systems, ranging from the scalar equation x0 D kx
with solution x.t/ D x0ekt to the vector solution x.t/ D vet of the linear system
x0 D Ax whose coefﬁcient matrix A has eigenvalue  with associated eigenvector v.
We now deﬁne exponentials of matrices in such a way that
X.t/ D eAt
is a matrix solution of the matrix differential equation
X0 D AX
with n  n coefﬁcient matrix A—in analogy with the fact that the ordinary expo-
nential function x.t/ D eat is a scalar solution of the ﬁrst-order differential equation
x0 D ax.

5.6 Matrix Exponentials and Linear Systems

The exponential e´ of the complex number ´ may be deﬁned (as in Section
3.3) by means of the exponential series
e´ D 1 C ´ C ´2
2Š C ´3
3Š C    C ´n
nŠ C    :
(16)
Similarly, if A is an n  n matrix, then the exponential matrix eA is the n  n matrix
deﬁned by the series
eA D I C A C A2
2Š C    C An
nŠ C    ;
(17)
where I is the identity matrix. The meaning of the inﬁnite series on the right in (17)

(18)
where A0 D I, A2 D AA, A3 D AA2, and so on; inductively, AnC1 D AAn if n = 0.
It can be shown that the limit in (18) exists for every n  n square matrix A. That is,
the exponential matrix eA is deﬁned (by Eq. (17)) for every square matrix A.

so the exponential of the diagonal 2  2 matrix A is obtained simply by exponentiating each

way. The exponential of the n  n diagonal matrix

obtained by exponentiating each diagonal element of D.
The exponential matrix eA satisﬁes most of the exponential relations that are
familiar in the case of scalar exponents. For instance, if 0 is the n  n zero matrix,
then Eq. (17) yields
e0 D I;
(21)
the n  n identity matrix. In Problem 31 we ask you to show that a useful law of
exponents holds for n  n matrices that commute:
If
AB D BA,
then
eACB D eAeB.
(22)
In Problem 32 we ask you to conclude that

eA1
D eA:
(23)
In particular, the matrix eA is nonsingular for every n  n matrix A (reminiscent of
the fact that e´ ¤ 0 for all ´). It follows from elementary linear algebra that the
column vectors of eA are always linearly independent.
If t is a scalar variable, then substitution of At for A in Eq. (17) gives
eAt D I C A t C A2 t2
2Š C    C An tn
nŠ C    :
(24)
(Of course, At is obtained simply by multiplying each element of A by t.)

Remark If An D 0 for some positive integer n, then the exponential series in (24) terminates

Because the matrix eAt is nonsingular, it follows that the matrix exponential eAt is a
fundamental matrix for the linear system x0 D Ax. In particular, it is the fundamental
matrix X.t/ such that X.0/ D I. Therefore, Theorem 1 implies the following result.

If A is an n  n matrix, then the solution of the initial value problem
x0 D Ax;
x.0/ D x0
(26)
is given by
x.t/ D eAtx0;
(27)
and this solution is unique.
Thus the solution of homogeneous linear systems reduces to the task of com-
puting exponential matrices. Conversely, if we already know a fundamental matrix
ˆ.t/ for the linear system x0 D Ax, then the facts that eAt D ˆ.t/C (by Eq. (40)) and
eA0 D e0 D I (the identity matrix) yield
eAt D ˆ.t/ˆ.0/1:
(28)
So we can ﬁnd the matrix exponential eAt by solving the linear system x0 D Ax.

of the differential equation x0 D Ax in (29). The ﬁnal step would be to determine values of
the coefﬁcients c1, c2, c3 so that the particular solution x.t/ D c1x1.t/ C c2x2.t/ C c3x3.t/
satisﬁes the initial condition in (29). At this point it should be apparent that—especially if the
matrix exponential eAt is readily available (for instance, from a computer algebra system)—
the method illustrated in Example 6 can well be more “computationally routine” than the
generalized eigenvector method.
General Matrix Exponentials
The relatively simple calculation of eAt carried out in Example 4 (and used in Ex-
ample 6) was based on the observation that if

A similar result holds for any 3  3 matrix A having a triple eigenvalue r, in
which case its characteristic equation reduces to .  r/3 D 0. For such a matrix, an
explicit computation similar to that in Eq. (30) will show that
.A  rI/3 D 0:
(31)
(This particular result is a special case of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem of advanced
linear algebra, according to which every matrix satisﬁes its own characteristic equa-
tion.) Thus the matrix A  rI is nilpotent, and it follows that

Chapter 5 Linear Systems of Differential Equations
the exponential series here terminating because of Eq. (31). In this way, we can
rather easily calculate the matrix exponential eAt for any square matrix having only
a single eigenvalue.
The calculation in Eq. (32) motivates a method of calculating eAt for any n  n
matrix A whatsoever. As we saw in Section 5.5, A has n linearly independent gen-
eralized eigenvectors u1, u2, : : : ; un. Each generalized eigenvector u is associated
with an eigenvalue  of A and has a rank r = 1 such that
.A  I/ru D 0
but
.A  I/r1u ¤ 0:
(33)
(If r D 1, then u is an ordinary eigenvector such that Au D u.)
Even if we do not yet know eAt explicitly, we can consider the function x.t/ D
eAtu, which is a linear combination of the column vectors of eAt and is therefore
a solution of the linear system x0 D Ax with x.0/ D u. Indeed, we can calculate x
explicitly in terms of A, u, , and r:

If the linearly independent solutions x1.t/, x2.t/, : : : , xn.t/ of x0 D Ax are
calculated using (34) with the linearly independent generalized eigenvectors u1, u2,

is a fundamental matrix for the system x0 D Ax. Finally, the speciﬁc fundamental
matrix X.t/ D ˆ.t/ˆ.0/1 satisﬁes the initial condition X.0/ D I, and thus is the
desired matrix exponential eAt. We have therefore outlined a proof of the following
theorem.
THEOREM 3
Computation of eAt
Let u1, u2, : : : ; un be n linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of the nn

Theorem 3 would apply even if the matrix A were not upper triangular. But because A is

the fundamental matrix eAt for the system
x0 D Ax;
(1)
then to calculate the matrix product x.t/ D eAtx0 to obtain a solution satisfying the
initial condition x.0/ D x0. For instance, suppose that we want to solve the initial
value problem

Obviously this, ﬁnally, is the way to do it!
Matrix exponentials also allow for convenient interactive exploration of the
system (1). For example, a version of the Mathematica commands
A = {{13, 4}, {4, 7}};
field = VectorPlot[A.{x, y}, {x, --25, 25},
{y, --25, 25}];
Manipulate[
curves = ParametricPlot[
MatrixExp[A t, #]&/@pt, {t, --1, 1},
PlotRange --> 25];
Show[curves, field],
{{pt, {{11, 23}, {20, --10}, {--20, --10},
{--20, 10}}}, Locator}]
was used to generate Fig. 5.6.1, which shows four solution curves of the system
(1) with the matrix A chosen as in Eq. (2). The initial conditions for each solution
curve—one of which initially passes through the point .11; 23/ of our initial value
problem, while the other three pass through the points .20; 10/, .20; 10/, and
.20; 10/—are speciﬁed by a “locator point” which can be freely dragged to any
desired position in the phase plane, with the corresponding solution curve being
instantly redrawn.

Interactive display of
the linear system (1). As the “locator
points” are dragged to different
positions, the solution curves are
immediately redrawn, illustrating the
behavior of the system.
Experimenting with such interactive displays can shed considerable light on
the behavior of linear systems. For example, notice the straight line solution in
Fig. 5.6.1; if you could drag the corresponding locator point around the phase plane,
what other straight line solution could you ﬁnd? How could you have predicted this
by examining the matrix A?

x2.0/ D 35;

If at this point you’re having too much fun with matrix exponentials to stop,
make up some problems of your own. For instance, choose any homogeneous linear
system appearing in this chapter and experiment with different initial conditions.
The exotic 5  5 matrix A of the Section 5.5 application may suggest some interest-
ing possibilities.

5.7 Nonhomogeneous Linear Systems

5.7 Nonhomogeneous Linear Systems
In Section 3.5 we exhibited two techniques for ﬁnding a single particular solution
of a single nonhomogeneous nth-order linear differential equation—the method of
undetermined coefﬁcients and the method of variation of parameters. Each of these
may be generalized to nonhomogeneous linear systems. In a linear system mod-
eling a physical situation, nonhomogeneous terms typically correspond to external
inﬂuences, such as the inﬂow of liquid to a cascade of brine tanks or an external
force acting on a mass-and-spring system.
Given the nonhomogeneous ﬁrst-order linear system
x0 D Ax C f.t/
(1)
where A is an n  n constant matrix and the “nonhomogeneous term” f.t/ is a given
continuous vector-valued function, we know from Theorem 4 of Section 5.1 that a
general solution of Eq. (1) has the form
x.t/ D xc.t/ C xp.t/;
(2)
where

xc.t/ D c1x1.t/ C c2x2.t/ C    C cnxn.t/ is a general solution of the associ-
ated homogeneous system x0 D Ax, and

xp.t/ is a single particular solution of the original nonhomogeneous system in
(1).
Preceding sections have dealt with xc.t/, so our task now is to ﬁnd xp.t/.
Undetermined Coefﬁcients
First we suppose that the nonhomogeneous term f.t/ in (1) is a linear combination
(with constant vector coefﬁcients) of products of polynomials, exponential func-
tions, and sines and cosines. Then the method of undetermined coefﬁcients for
systems is essentially the same as for a single linear differential equation. We make
an intelligent guess as to the general form of a particular solution xp, then attempt
to determine the coefﬁcients in xp by substitution in Eq. (1). Moreover, the choice
of this general form is essentially the same as in the case of a single equation (dis-
cussed in Section 3.5); we modify it only by using undetermined vector coefﬁcients
rather than undetermined scalars. We will therefore conﬁne the present discussion
to illustrative examples.

We equate the coefﬁcients of t and the constant terms (in both x1- and x2-compon-ents) and
thereby obtain the equations

We solve the ﬁrst two equations in (5) for a1 D 4 and a2 D 6. With these values we can
then solve the last two equations in (5) for b1 D 17 and b2 D 25. Substitution of these

The volumes of the three tanks are V1 D 20, V2 D 40, and V3 D 50 (gal), and the common
ﬂow rate is r D 10 (gal=min). Suppose that all three tanks contain fresh water initially, but
that the inﬂow to tank 1 is brine containing 2 pounds of salt per gallon, so that 20 pounds of

In the case of duplicate expressions in the complementary function and the
nonhomogeneous terms, there is one difference between the method of undeter-
mined coefﬁcients for systems and for single equations (Rule 2 in Section 3.5). For
a system, the usual ﬁrst choice for a trial solution must be multiplied not only by
the smallest integral power of t that will eliminate duplication, but also by all lower
(nonnegative integral) powers of t as well, and all the resulting terms must be in-
cluded in the trial solution.

exhibits duplication with the complementary function in (10). We would therefore select
xp.t/ D at2e2t C bte2t C ce2t
as our trial solution, and we would then have six scalar coefﬁcients to determine. It is simpler
to use the method of variation of parameters, our next topic.
Variation of Parameters
Recall from Section 3.5 that the method of variation of parameters may be applied
to a linear differential equation with variable coefﬁcients and is not restricted to
nonhomogeneous terms involving only polynomials, exponentials, and sinusoidal
functions. The method of variation of parameters for systems enjoys the same ﬂexi-
bility and has a concise matrix formulation that is convenient for both practical and
theoretical purposes.
We want to ﬁnd a particular solution xp of the nonhomogeneous linear system
x0 D P.t/x C f.t/;
(11)
given that we have already found a general solution
xc.t/ D c1x1.t/ C c2x2.t/ C    C cnxn.t/

Chapter 5 Linear Systems of Differential Equations
We ﬁrst use the fundamental matrix ˆ.t/ with column vectors x1, x2, : : : ; xn
to rewrite the complementary function in (12) as
xc.t/ D ˆ.t/c;
(14)
where c denotes the column vector whose entries are the coefﬁcients c1; c2; : : : ; cn.
Our idea is to replace the vector “parameter” c with a variable vector u.t/. Thus we
seek a particular solution of the form
xp.t/ D ˆ.t/u.t/:
(15)
We must determine u.t/ so that xp does, indeed, satisfy Eq. (11).
The derivative of xp.t/ is (by the product rule)
x0
p.t/ D ˆ0.t/u.t/ C ˆ.t/u0.t/:
(16)
Hence substitution of Eqs. (15) and (16) in (11) yields
ˆ0.t/u.t/ C ˆ.t/u0.t/ D P.t/ˆ.t/u.t/ C f.t/:
(17)
But
ˆ0.t/ D P.t/ˆ.t/
(18)
because each column vector of ˆ.t/ satisﬁes Eq. (13). Therefore, Eq. (17) reduces
to
ˆ.t/u0.t/ D f.t/:
(19)
Thus it sufﬁces to choose u.t/ so that
u0.t/ D ˆ.t/1f.t/I
(20)
that is, so that
u.t/ D
Z
ˆ.t/1f.t/ dt:
(21)
Upon substitution of (21) in (15), we ﬁnally obtain the desired particular solution,
as stated in the following theorem.
THEOREM 1
Variation of Parameters
If ˆ.t/ is a fundamental matrix for the homogeneous system x0 D P.t/x on some
interval where P.t/ and f.t/ are continuous, then a particular solution of the non-
homogeneous system
x0 D P.t/x C f.t/
is given by
xp.t/ D ˆ.t/
Z
ˆ.t/1f.t/ dt:
(22)

5.7 Nonhomogeneous Linear Systems
367
This is the variation of parameters formula for ﬁrst-order linear systems. If
we add this particular solution and the complementary function in (14), we get the
general solution
x.t/ D ˆ.t/c C ˆ.t/
Z
ˆ.t/1f.t/ dt
(23)
of the nonhomogeneous system in (11).
The choice of the constant of integration in Eq. (22) is immaterial, for we
need only a single particular solution. In solving initial value problems it often is
convenient to choose the constant of integration so that xp.a/ D 0, and thus integrate
from a to t:
xp.t/ D ˆ.t/
Z t
a
ˆ.s/1f.s/ ds:
(24)
If we add the particular solution of the nonhomogeneous problem
x0 D P.t/x C f.t/;
x.a/ D 0
in (24) to the solution xc.t/ D ˆ.t/ˆ.a/1xa of the associated homogeneous prob-
lem x0 D P.t/x, x.a/ D xa, we get the solution
x.t/ D ˆ.t/ˆ.a/1xa C ˆ.t/

a
ˆ.s/1f.s/ ds
(25)
of the nonhomogeneous initial value problem
x0 D P.t/x C f.t/;
x.a/ D xa:
(26)
Equations (22) and (25) hold for any fundamental matrix ˆ.t/ of the homo-
geneous system x0 D P.t/x. In the constant-coefﬁcient case P.t/  A we can use
for ˆ.t/ the exponential matrix eAt—that is, the particular fundamental matrix such
that ˆ.0/ D I. Then, because .eAt/1 D eAt, substitution of ˆ.t/ D eAt in (22)
yields the particular solution
xp.t/ D eAt
Z
eAtf.t/ dt
(27)
of the nonhomogeneous system x0 D P.t/x C f.t/. Similarly, substitution of ˆ.t/ D

If, ﬁnally, we supply the independent variable t throughout, the ﬁnal result on the

instead of three tanks. Each tank initially contains fresh water,
and the inﬂow to tank 1 at the rate of r gallons per minute has
a salt concentration of c0 pounds per gallon.
(a) Find the
amounts x1.t/ and x2.t/ of salt in the two tanks after t min-

5.7 Application Automated Variation of Parameters
The application of the variation of parameters formula in Eq. (28) encourages so
mechanical an approach as to encourage especially the use of a computer algebra
system. The following Mathematica commands were used to check the results in
Example 4 of this section.

5.7 Nonhomogeneous Linear Systems
371
A = {{4,2}, {3,--1}};
x0 ={{7}, {3}};
f[t ] := {{--15 t Exp[--2t]},{--4 t Exp[--2t]}};
exp[A ] := MatrixExp[A]
x = exp[A*t].(x0 + Integrate[exp[--A*s].f[s], {s,0,t}])
The matrix exponential commands illustrated in the Section 5.6 application provide
the basis for analogous Maple and MATLAB computations. You can then check
routinely the answers for Problems 17 through 34 of this section.

Nonlinear Systems
and Phenomena
6.1 Stability and the Phase Plane
A
wide variety of natural phenomena are modeled by two-dimensional ﬁrst-order
systems of the form
dx
dt D F.x; y/;
dy
dt D G.x; y/
(1)
in which the independent variable t does not appear explicitly. We usually think
of the dependent variables x and y as position variables in the xy-plane and of t
as a time variable. We will see that the absence of t on the right-hand sides in (1)
makes the system easier to analyze and its solutions easier to visualize. Using the
terminology of Section 2.2, such a system of differential equations in which the
derivative values are independent (or “autonomous”) of time t is often called an
autonomous system.
We generally assume that the functions F and G are continuously differen-
tiable in some region R of the xy-plane.
Then according to the existence and
uniqueness theorems of the Appendix, given t0 and any point .x0; y0/ of R, there is
a unique solution x D x.t/, y D y.t/ of (1) that is deﬁned on some open interval
.a; b/ containing t0 and satisﬁes the initial conditions
x.t0/ D x0;
y.t0/ D y0:
(2)
The equations x D x.t/, y D y.t/ then describe a parametrized solution curve in the
phase plane. Any such solution curve is called a trajectory of the system in (1), and
precisely one trajectory passes through each point of the region R (Problem 29). A
critical point of the system in (1) is a point .x?; y?/ such that
F.x?; y?/ D G.x?; y?/ D 0:
(3)
372

6.1 Stability and the Phase Plane
373
If .x?; y?/ is a critical point of the system, then the constant-valued functions
x.t/  x?;
y.t/  y?
(4)
have derivatives x0.t/  0 and y0.t/  0, and therefore automatically satisfy the
equations in (1). Such a constant-valued solution is called an equilibrium solution
of the system. Note that the trajectory of the equilibrium solution in (4) consists of
the single point .x?; y?/.
In some practical situations these very simple solutions and trajectories are
the ones of greatest interest. For example, suppose that the system x0 D F.x; y/,
y0 D G.x; y/ models two populations x.t/ and y.t/ of animals that cohabit the same
environment, and perhaps compete for the same food or prey on one another; x.t/
might denote the number of rabbits and y.t/ the number of squirrels present at time
t. Then a critical point .x?; y?/ of the system speciﬁes a constant population x? of
rabbits and a constant population y? of squirrels that can coexist with one another
in the environment. If .x0; y0/ is not a critical point of the system, then it is not
possible for constant populations of x0 rabbits and y0 squirrels to coexist; one or
both must change with time.
Example 1
Find the critical points of the system
dx
dt D 14x  2x2  xy;
dy
dt D 16y  2y2  xy:
(5)
Solution
When we look at the equations
14x  2x2  xy D x.14  2x  y/ D 0;
16y  2y2  xy D y.16  2y  x/ D 0
that a critical point .x; y/ must satisfy, we see that either
x D 0
or
14  2x  y D 0;
(6a)
and either
y D 0
or
16  2y  x D 0:
(6b)
If x D 0 and y ¤ 0, then the second equation in (6b) gives y D 8. If y D 0 and x ¤ 0,
then the second equation in (6a) gives x D 7. If both x and y are nonzero, then we solve the
simultaneous equations
2x C y D 14;
x C 2y D 16
for x D 4, y D 6. Thus the system in (5) has the four critical points .0; 0/, .0; 8/, .7; 0/, and
.4; 6/. If x.t/ and y.t/ denote the number of rabbits and the number of squirrels, respectively,
and if both populations are constant, it follows that the equations in (5) allow only three
nontrivial possibilities: either no rabbits and 8 squirrels, or 7 rabbits and no squirrels, or 4
rabbits and 6 squirrels. In particular, the critical point .4; 6/ describes the only possibility for
the coexistence of constant nonzero populations of both species.
Phase Portraits
If the initial point .x0; y0/ is not a critical point, then the corresponding trajectory is
a curve in the xy-plane along which the point .x.t/; y.t// moves as t increases. It
turns out that any trajectory not consisting of a single point is a nondegenerate curve
with no self-intersections (Problem 30). We can exhibit qualitatively the behavior
of solutions of the autonomous system in (1) by constructing a picture that shows

374
Chapter 6 Nonlinear Systems and Phenomena
its critical points together with a collection of typical solution curves or trajectories
in the xy-plane. Such a picture is called a phase portrait (or phase plane picture)
because it illustrates “phases” or xy-states of the system, and indicates how they
change with time.
Another way of visualizing the system is to construct a slope ﬁeld in the xy-
phase plane by drawing typical line segments having slope
dy
dx D y0
x0 D G.x; y/
F.x; y/;
or a direction ﬁeld by drawing typical vectors pointing the same direction at each
point .x; y/ as does the vector .F.x; y/; G.x; y//. Such a vector ﬁeld then indicates
which direction along a trajectory to travel in order to “go with the ﬂow” described
by the system.
Remark It is worth emphasizing that if our system of differential equations were not au-
tonomous, then its critical points, trajectories, and direction vectors would generally be
changing with time. In this event, the concrete visualization afforded by a (ﬁxed) phase
portrait or direction ﬁeld would not be available to us. Indeed, this is a principal reason why
an introductory study of nonlinear systems concentrates on autonomous ones.
Figure 6.1.1 shows a direction ﬁeld and phase portrait for the rabbit-squirrel
system of Example 1. The direction ﬁeld arrows indicate the direction of motion of
the point .x.t/; y.t//. We see that, given any positive initial numbers x0 6D 4 and

For the system

we see from the ﬁrst equation that x D y and from the second that x D ˙1 at each critical
point. Thus this system has the two critical points .1; 1/ and .1; 1/. The direction ﬁeld in
Fig. 6.1.2 suggests that trajectories somehow “circulate” counterclockwise around the critical
point .1; 1/, whereas it appears that some trajectories may approach, while others recede
from, the critical point .1; 1/. These observations are corroborated by the phase portrait in
Fig. 6.1.3 for the system in (7).

Remark One could carelessly write the critical points in Example 2 as .˙1; ˙1/ and then
jump to the erroneous conclusion that the system in (7) has four rather than just two criti-
cal points. When feasible, a sure-ﬁre way to determine the number of critical points of an

intersections, each of which represents a critical point of the system. For instance, Fig. 6.1.4
shows the curve (line) F.x; y/ D x  y D 0 and the pair of lines x D C1 and x D 1 that
constitute the “curve” G.x; y/ D 1  x2 D 0. The (only) two points of intersection .1; 1/
and .C1; C1/ are then apparent.
Critical Point Behavior
The behavior of the trajectories near an isolated critical point of an autonomous
system is of particular interest. Figure 6.1.5 is a close-up view of Fig. 6.1.1 near the
critical point .4; 6/, and similarly Figs. 6.1.6 and 6.1.7 are close-ups of Fig. 6.1.3
near the critical points .1; 1/ and .1; 1/, respectively. We notice immediately that
although the systems underlying these phase portraits are nonlinear, each of these
three magniﬁcations bears a striking resemblance to one of the cases in our “gallery”
Fig. 5.3.16 of phase plane portraits for linear constant-coefﬁcient systems. Indeed,
the three ﬁgures strongly resemble a nodal sink, a spiral source, and a saddle point,
respectively.

These similarities are not a coincidence. Indeed, as we will explore in detail in
the next section, the behavior of a nonlinear system near a critical point is generally
similar to that of a corresponding linear constant-coefﬁcient system near the origin.
For this reason it is useful to extend the language of nodes, sinks, etc., introduced in
Section 5.3 for linear constant-coefﬁcient systems to the broader context of critical
points of the two-dimensional system (1).
In general, the critical point .x?; y?/ of the autonomous system in (1) is called
a node provided that

Either every trajectory approaches .x?; y?/ as t ! C1 or every trajectory
recedes from .x?; y?/ as t ! C1, and

Every trajectory is tangent at .x?; y?/ to some straight line through the critical
point.
As with linear constant-coefﬁcient systems, a node is said to be proper pro-
vided that no two different pairs of “opposite” trajectories are tangent to the same
straight line through the critical point. On the other hand, the critical point .4; 6/ of
the system in Eq. (5), shown in Figs. 6.1.1 and 6.1.5, is an improper node; as those
ﬁgures suggest, virtually all of the trajectories approaching this critical point share
a common tangent line at that point.
Likewise, a node is further called a sink if all trajectories approach the critical
point, a source if all trajectories recede (or emanate) from it. Thus the critical point

376
Chapter 6 Nonlinear Systems and Phenomena
.4; 6/ in Figs. 6.1.1 and 6.1.5 is a nodal sink, whereas the critical point .1; 1/ in
Figs. 6.1.3 and 6.1.6 is a source (more speciﬁcally, a spiral source). The critical
point .1; 1/ in Figs. 6.1.3 and 6.1.7, on the other hand, is a saddle point.
Stability
A critical point .x?; y?/ of the autonomous system in (1) is said to be stable provided
that if the initial point .x0; y0/ is sufﬁciently close to .x?; y?/, then .x.t/; y.t// re-
mains close to .x?; y?/ for all t > 0. In vector notation, with x.t/ D .x.t/; y.t//, the
distance between the initial point x0 D .x0; y0/ and the critical point x? D .x?; y?/
is
jx0  x?j D
p
.x0  x?/2 C .y0  y?/2 :
Thus the critical point x? is stable provided that, for each 
 > 0, there exists ı > 0
such that
jx0  x?j < ı
implies that
jx.t/  x?j < 
(8)
for all t > 0. Note that the condition in (8) certainly holds if x.t/ ! x? as t ! C1,
as in the case of a nodal sink such as the critical point .4; 6/ in Figs. 6.1.1 and 6.1.5.
Thus this nodal sink can also be described as a stable node.
The critical point .x?; y?/ is called unstable if it is not stable. The two critical
points at .1; 1/ and .1; 1/ shown in Figs. 6.1.3, 6.1.6, and 6.1.7 are both unstable,
because, loosely speaking, in neither of these cases can we guarantee that a trajec-
tory will remain near the critical point simply by requiring the trajectory to begin
near the critical point.
If .x?; y?/ is a critical point, then the equilibrium solution x.t/  x?, y.t/ 
y? is called stable or unstable depending on the nature of the critical point. In
applications the stability of an equilibrium solution is often a crucial matter. For
instance, suppose in Example 1 that x.t/ and y.t/ denote the rabbit and squirrel
populations, respectively, in hundreds. We will see in Section 6.3 that the critical
point .4; 6/ in Fig. 6.1.1 is stable. It follows that if we begin with close to 400
rabbits and 600 squirrels—rather than exactly these equilibrium values—then for
all future time there will remain close to 400 rabbits and close to 600 squirrels. Thus
the practical consequence of stability is that slight changes (perhaps due to random
births and deaths) in the equilibrium populations will not so upset the equilibrium
as to result in large deviations from the equilibrium solutions.
It is possible for trajectories to remain near a stable critical point without ap-
proaching it, as Example 3 shows.
Example 3
Consider a mass m that oscillates without damping on a spring with Hooke’s constant k,
so that its position function x.t/ satisﬁes the differential equation x00 C !2x D 0 (where
!2 D k=m). If we introduce the velocity y D dx=dt of the mass, we get the system

the origin in the xy-plane lies on exactly one of these ellipses, and each solution .x.t/; y.t//
traverses the ellipse through its initial point .x0; y0/ in the clockwise direction with period
P D 2=!. (It is clear from (11) that x.t C P / D x.t/ and y.t C P / D y.t/ for all t.) Thus
each nontrivial solution of the system in (9) is periodic and its trajectory is a simple closed
curve enclosing the critical point at the origin.

semiaxis denoted by ı and its major semiaxis by 
. We see that if the initial point
.x0; y0/ lies within distance ı of the origin—so that its elliptical trajectory lies in-
side the one shown—then the point .x.t/; y.t// always remains within distance 
 of
the origin. Hence the origin .0; 0/ is a stable critical point of the system x0 D y,
y0 D !2x, despite the fact that no single trajectory approaches the point .0; 0/. A
stable critical point surrounded by simple closed trajectories representing periodic
solutions is called a (stable) center.
Asymptotic Stability
The critical point .x?; y?/ is called asymptotically stable if it is stable and, more-
over, every trajectory that begins sufﬁciently close to .x?; y?/ also approaches
.x?; y?/ as t ! C1. That is, there exists ı > 0 such that
jx  x?j < ı
implies that
lim
t!1 x.t/ D x?;
(13)
where x0 D .x0; y0/, x? D .x?; y?/, and x.t/ D .x.t/; y.t// is a solution with x.0/ D
x0.
Remark The stable node shown in Figs. 6.1.1 and 6.1.5 is asymptotically stable because
every trajectory approaches the critical point .4; 6/ as t ! C1. The center .0; 0/ shown
in Fig. 6.1.8 is stable but not asymptotically stable, because however small an elliptical tra-
jectory we consider, a point moving around this ellipse does not approach the origin. Thus
asymptotic stability is a stronger condition than mere stability.
Now suppose that x.t/ and y.t/ denote coexisting populations for which
.x?; y?/ is an asymptotically stable critical point. Then if the initial populations
x0 and y0 are sufﬁciently close to x? and y?, respectively, it follows that both
lim
t!1 x.t/ D x?
and
lim
t!1 y.t/ D y?:
(14)
That is, x.t/ and y.t/ actually approach the equilibrium populations x? and y? as
t ! C1, rather than merely remaining close to those values.
For a mechanical system as in Example 3, a critical point represents an equi-
librium state of the system—if the velocity y D x0 and the acceleration y0 D x00
vanish simultaneously, then the mass remains at rest with no net force acting on
it. Stability of a critical point concerns the question whether, when the mass is
displaced slightly from its equilibrium, it

378
Chapter 6 Nonlinear Systems and Phenomena
1. Moves back toward the equilibrium point as t ! C1,
2. Merely remains near the equilibrium point without approaching it, or
3. Moves farther away from equilibrium.
In Case 1 the critical [equilibrium] point is asymptotically stable; in Case 2
it is stable but not asymptotically so; in Case 3 it is an unstable critical point. A
marble balanced on the top of a soccer ball is an example of an unstable critical
point. A mass on a spring with damping illustrates the case of asymptotic stability
of a mechanical system. The mass-and-spring without damping in Example 3 is an
example of a system that is stable but not asymptotically stable.
Example 4
Suppose that m D 1 and k D 2 for the mass and spring of Example 3 and that the mass is
attached also to a dashpot with damping constant c D 2. Then its displacement function x.t/
satisﬁes the second-order equation
x00.t/ C 2x0.t/ C 2x.t/ D 0:
(15)
With y D x0 we obtain the equivalent ﬁrst-order system
dx
dt D y;
dy

(16)
with critical point .0; 0/. The characteristic equation r2 C 2r C 2 D 0 of Eq. (15) has roots
1 C i and 1  i, so the general solution of the system in (16) is given by
x.t/ D et.A cos t C B sin t/ D Cet cos.t  ˛/;

positive and negative values and that both approach zero as t ! C1. Thus a typical trajectory
spirals inward toward the origin, as illustrated by the spiral in Fig. 6.1.10.

point and one nearby trajectory.
It is clear from (17) that the point .x.t/; y.t// approaches the origin as t !
C1, so it follows that .0; 0/ is an asymptotically stable critical point for the system
x0 D y, y0 D 2x  2y of Example 4. Such an asymptotically stable critical point—
around which the trajectories spiral as they approach it—is called a stable spiral
point (or a spiral sink). In the case of a mass–spring–dashpot system, a spiral sink
is the manifestation in the phase plane of the damped oscillations that occur because
of resistance.
If the arrows in Fig. 6.1.10 were reversed, we would see a trajectory spiraling
outward from the origin. An unstable critical point—around which the trajectories
spiral as they emanate and recede from it—is called an unstable spiral point (or
a spiral source). Example 5 shows that it also is possible for a trajectory to spiral
into a closed trajectory—a simple closed solution curve that represents a periodic
solution (like the elliptical trajectories in Fig. 6.1.8).

If r0 D 1, then Eq. (21) gives r.t/  1 (the unit circle). Otherwise, if r0 > 0, then Eq. (21)
implies that r.t/ ! 1 as t ! C1. Hence the trajectory deﬁned in (22) spirals in toward the
unit circle if r0 > 1 and spirals out toward this closed trajectory if 0 < r0 < 1. Figure 6.1.11
shows a trajectory spiraling outward from the origin and four trajectories spiraling inward,
all approaching the closed trajectory r.t/  1.

Under rather general hypotheses it can be shown that there are four possibili-
ties for a nondegenerate trajectory of the autonomous system
dx

dt D G.x; y/:
The four possibilities are these:
1. .x.t/; y.t// approaches a critical point as t ! C1.
2. .x.t/; y.t// is unbounded with increasing t.
3. .x.t/; y.t// is a periodic solution with a closed trajectory.
4. .x.t/; y.t// spirals toward a closed trajectory as t ! C1.
As a consequence, the qualitative nature of the phase plane picture of the
trajectories of an autonomous system is determined largely by the locations of its
critical points and by the behavior of its trajectories near its critical points. We will
see in Section 6.2 that, subject to mild restrictions on the functions F and G, each
isolated critical point of the system x0 D F.x; y/, y0 D G.x; y/ resembles qualita-
tively one of the examples of this section—it is either a node (proper or improper),
a saddle point, a center, or a spiral point.

ation in Problem 27) that ..t/;  .t// is also a solution

but important property that a “t-translate” of a solution is
again a solution.

Apply the uniqueness theorem to
show that .x1.t/; y1.t// and .x3.t/; y3.t// are identical so-
lutions. Hence the original two trajectories are identical.
Thus no two different trajectories of an autonomous sys-
tem can intersect.
30. Suppose that the solution .x1.t/; y1.t// is deﬁned for all t
and that its trajectory has an apparent self-intersection:
x1.a/ D x1.a C P / D x0;
y1.a/ D y1.a C P / D y0
for some P > 0. Introduce the solution
x2.t/ D x1.t C P /;
y2.t/ D y1.t C P /;
and then apply the uniqueness theorem to show that
x1.t C P / D x1.t/
and
y1.t/ D y1.t C P /
for all t. Thus the solution .x1.t/; y1.t// is periodic with
period P and has a closed trajectory. Consequently a so-
lution of an autonomous system either is periodic with
a closed trajectory, or else its trajectory never passes
through the same point twice.

6.1 Application Phase Plane Portraits and First-Order Equations
Consider a ﬁrst-order differential equation of the form

nevertheless be plotted as trajectories of the corresponding autonomous two-dimen-

Most ODE plotters can routinely generate phase portraits for autonomous sys-
tems. Many of those appearing in this chapter were plotted using (as illustrated
in Fig. 6.1.20) John Polking’s MATLAB-based pplane program that is available
free for educational use (math.rice.edu/~dfield). Another freely available
and user-friendly MATLAB-based ODE package with similar graphical capabilities
is Iode (www.math.uiuc.edu/iode).

6.2 Linear and Almost Linear Systems
We now discuss the behavior of solutions of the autonomous system
dx
dt D f .x; y/;
dy
dt D g.x; y/
(1)
near an isolated critical point .x0; y0/ where f .x0; y0/ D g.x0; y0/ D 0. A critical
point is called isolated if some neighborhood of it contains no other critical point.
We assume throughout that the functions f and g are continuously differentiable in
a neighborhood of .x0; y0/.
We can assume without loss of generality that x0 D y0 D 0. Otherwise, we
make the substitutions u D x  x0, v D y  y0. Then dx=dt D du=dt and dy=dt D
dv=dt, so (1) is equivalent to the system
du
dt D f .u C x0; v C y0/ D f1.u; v/;
dv
dt D g.u C x0; v C y0/ D g1.u; v/
(2)
that has .0; 0/ as an isolated critical point.

Chapter 6 Nonlinear Systems and Phenomena
has .1; 2/ as one of its critical points. We substitute u D x  1, v D y  2; that is, x D u C 1,
y D v C 2. Then
3  x  y D 3  .u C 1/  .v C 2/ D u  v
and
1  3x C y D 1  3.u C 1/ C .v C 2/ D 3u C v;
so the system in (3) takes the form
du
dt D .u C 1/.u  v/ D u  v  u2  uv;
dv
dt D .v C 2/.3u C v/ D 6u C 2v C v2  3uv
(4)
and has .0; 0/ as a critical point. If we can determine the trajectories of the system in (4)
near .0; 0/, then their translations under the rigid motion that carries .0; 0/ to .1; 2/ will be
the trajectories near .1; 2/ of the original system in (3). This equivalence is illustrated by
Fig. 6.2.1 (which shows computer-plotted trajectories of the system in (3) near the critical
point .1; 2/ in the xy-plane) and Fig. 6.2.2 (which shows computer-plotted trajectories of the
system in (4) near the critical point .0; 0/ in the uv-plane).

Figures 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 illustrate the fact that the solution curves of the xy-
system in (1) are simply the images under the translation .u; v/ ! .u C x0; v C y0/
of the solution curves of the uv-system in (2). Near the two corresponding critical
points—.x0; y0/ in the xy-plane and .0; 0/ in the uv-plane—the two phase portraits
therefore look precisely the same.
Linearization Near a Critical Point
Taylor’s formula for functions of two variables implies that—if the function f .x; y/
is continuously differentiable near the ﬁxed point .x0; y0/—then
f .x0 C u; y0 C v/ D f .x0; y0/ C fx.x0; y0/u C fy.x0; y0/v C r.u; v/
where the “remainder term” r.u; v/ satisﬁes the condition
lim
.u;v/!.0;0/
r.u; v/
p
u2 C v2 D 0:
(Note that this condition would not be satisﬁed if r.u; v/ were a sum containing
either constants or terms linear in u or v. In this sense, r.u; v/ consists of the
“nonlinear part” of the function f .x0 C u; y0 C v/ of u and v.)

6.2 Linear and Almost Linear Systems
385
If we apply Taylor’s formula to both f and g in (2) and assume that .x0; y0/
is an isolated critical point so f .x0; y0/ D g.x0; y0/ D 0, the result is
du
dt D fx.x0; y0/u C fy.x0; y0/v C r.u; v/;
dv
dt D gx.x0; y0/u C gy.x0; y0/v C s.u; v/

where r.u; v/ and the analogous remainder term s.u; v/ for g satisfy the condition

r.u; v/
p
u2 C v2 D
lim
.u;v/!.0;0/
s.u; v/
p
u2 C v2 D 0:
(6)
Then, when the values u and v are small, the remainder terms r.u; v/ and s.u; v/ are
very small (being small even in comparison with u and v).
If we drop the presumably small nonlinear terms r.u; v/ and s.u; v/ in (5), the
result is the linear system
du
dt D fx.x0; y0/u C fy.x0; y0/v;
dv
dt D gx.x0; y0/u C gy.x0; y0/v
(7)
whose constant coefﬁcients (of the variables u and v) are the values fx.x0; y0/,
fy.x0; y0/ and gx.x0; y0/, gy.x0; y0/ of the functions f and g at the critical point
.x0; y0/. Because (5) is equivalent to the original (and generally) nonlinear system
u0 D f .x0 C u; y0 C v/, v0 D g.x0 C u; y0 C v/ in (2), the conditions in (6) suggest
that the linearized system in (7) closely approximates the given nonlinear system
when .u; v/ is close to .0; 0/.
Assuming that .0; 0/ is also an isolated critical point of the linear system,
and that the remainder terms in (5) satisfy the condition in (6), the original system
x0 D f .x; y/, y0 D g.x; y/ is said to be almost linear at the isolated critical point
.x0; y0/. In this case, its linearization at .x0; y0/ is the linear system in (7). In
short, this linearization is the linear system u0 D Ju (where u D

coefﬁcient matrix is the so-called Jacobian matrix

u0 D u  v;
v0 D 6u C 2v
that we get when we drop the nonlinear (quadratic) terms in (4).
It turns out that in most (though not all) cases, the phase portrait of an al-
most linear system near an isolated critical point .x0; y0/ strongly resembles—
qualitatively—the phase portrait of its linearization near the origin. Consequently,
the ﬁrst step toward understanding general autonomous systems is to characterize
the isolated critical points of linear systems.

with constant-coefﬁcient matrix A. The origin .0; 0/ is a critical point of the system
regardless of the matrix A, but if we further require the origin to be an isolated
critical point, then (by a standard theorem of linear algebra) the determinant ad bc
of A must be nonzero. From this we can conclude that the eigenvalues 1 and 2 of
A must be nonzero. Indeed, 1 and 2 are the solutions of the characteristic equation

(10)
and the fact that ad  bc 6D 0 implies that  D 0 cannot satisfy Eq. (10); hence 1
and 2 are nonzero. The converse also holds: If the characteristic equation (10) has
no zero solution—that is, if all eigenvalues of the matrix A are nonzero—then the
determinant ad  bc is nonzero. Altogether, we conclude that the origin .0; 0/ is an
isolated critical point of the system in Eq. (9) if and only if the eigenvalues of A are
all nonzero. Our study of this critical point can be divided, therefore, into the ﬁve
cases listed in the table in Fig. 6.2.3. This table also gives the type of each critical
point as found in Section 5.3 and shown in our gallery Fig. 5.3.16 of typical phase
plane portraits:

of the two-dimensional system x0 D Ax.
Closer inspection of that gallery, however, reveals a striking connection be-
tween the stability properties of the critical point and the eigenvalues 1 and 2
of A. For example, if 1 and 2 are real, unequal, and negative, then the origin
represents an improper nodal sink; because all trajectories approach the origin as
t ! C1, the critical point is asymptotically stable. Likewise, if 1 and 2 are real,
equal, and negative, then the origin is a proper nodal sink, and is again asymptot-
ically stable. Further, if 1 and 2 are complex conjugate with negative real part,
then the origin is a spiral sink, and is once more asymptotically stable. All three of
these cases can be captured as follows: If the real parts of 1 and 2 are negative,
then the origin is an asymptotically stable critical point. (Note that if 1 and 2 are
real, then they are themselves their real parts.)
Similar generalizations can be made for other combinations of signs of the real
parts of 1 and 2. Indeed, as the table in Fig. 6.2.4 shows, the stability properties

6.2 Linear and Almost Linear Systems
387
of the isolated critical point .0; 0/ of the system in Eq. (9) are always determined
by the signs of the real parts of 1 and 2. (We invite you to use the gallery in
Fig. 5.3.16 to verify the conclusions in the table.)

Stability properties of the isolated critical point .0; 0/ of the system in Eq. (9) with
nonzero eigenvalues 1 and 2.
These ﬁndings are summarized in Theorem 1:
THEOREM 1
Stability of Linear Systems
Let 1 and 2 be the eigenvalues of the coefﬁcient matrix A of the two-
dimensional linear system
dx
dt D ax C by;
dy
dt D cx C dy
(11)
with ad  bc 6D 0. Then the critical point .0; 0/ is
1. Asymptotically stable if the real parts of 1 and 2 are both negative;
2. Stable but not asymptotically stable if the real parts of 1 and 2 are both
zero (so that 1, 2 D ˙qi);
3. Unstable if either 1 or 2 has a positive real part.
It is worthwhile to consider the effect of small perturbations in the coefﬁcients
a, b, c, and d of the linear system in (11), which result in small perturbations of the
eigenvalues 1 and 2. If these perturbations are sufﬁciently small, then positive
real parts (of 1 and 2) remain positive and negative real parts remain negative.
Hence an asymptotically stable critical point remains asymptotically stable and an
unstable critical point remains unstable. Part 2 of Theorem 1 is therefore the only
case in which arbitrarily small perturbations can affect the stability of the critical
point .0; 0/. In this case pure imaginary roots 1, 2 D ˙qi of the characteristic
equation can be changed to nearby complex roots 1, 2 D r ˙ si, with r either
positive or negative (see Fig. 6.2.5). Consequently, a small perturbation of the coef-
ﬁcients of the linear system in (11) can change a stable center to a spiral point that
is either unstable or asymptotically stable.

Chapter 6 Nonlinear Systems and Phenomena
There is one other exceptional case in which the type, though not the stability,
of the critical point .0; 0/ can be altered by a small perturbation of its coefﬁcients.
This is the case with 1 D 2, equal roots that (under a small perturbation of the
coefﬁcients) can split into two roots 1 and 2, which are either complex conjugates
or unequal real roots (see Fig. 6.2.6). In either case, the sign of the real parts of the
roots is preserved, so the stability of the critical point is unaltered. Its nature may
change, however; the table in Fig. 6.2.3 shows that a node with 1 D 2 can either
remain a node (if 1 and 2 are real) or change to a spiral point (if 1 and 2 are
complex conjugates).
Suppose that the linear system in (11) is used to model a physical situation. It

is unlikely that the coefﬁcients in (11) can be measured with total accuracy, so let
the unknown precise linear model be
dx
dt D a?x C b?y;
dy
dt D c?x C d ?y:
(11?)
If the coefﬁcients in (11) are sufﬁciently close to those in (11?), it then follows from
the discussion in the preceding paragraph that the origin .0; 0/ is an asymptotically
stable critical point for (11) if it is an asymptotically stable critical point for (11?),
and is an unstable critical point for (11) if it is an unstable critical point for (11?).
Thus in this case the approximate model in (11) and the precise model in (11?)
predict the same qualitative behavior (with respect to asymptotic stability versus
instability).
Almost Linear Systems
Recall that we ﬁrst encountered an almost linear system at the beginning of this
section, when we used Taylor’s formula to write the nonlinear system (2) in the
almost linear form (5) which led to the linearization (7) of the original nonlinear
system. In case the nonlinear system x0 D f .x; y/, y0 D g.x; y/ has .0; 0/ as an
isolated critical point, the corresponding almost linear system is
dx
dt D ax C by C r.x; y/;
dy
dt D cx C dy C s.x; y/;
(12)
where a D fx.0; 0/, b D fy.0; 0/ and c D gx.0; 0/, d D gy.0; 0/; we assume also
that ad  bc 6D 0. Theorem 2, which we state without proof, essentially implies
that—with regard to the type and stability of the critical point .0; 0/—the effect of
the small nonlinear terms r.x; y/ and s.x; y/ is equivalent to the effect of a small
perturbation in the coefﬁcients of the associated linear system in (11).
THEOREM 2
Stability of Almost Linear Systems
Let 1 and 2 be the eigenvalues of the coefﬁcient matrix of the linear system in
(11) associated with the almost linear system in (12). Then
1. If 1 D 2 are equal real eigenvalues, then the critical point .0; 0/ of (12) is
either a node or a spiral point, and is asymptotically stable if 1 D 2 < 0,
unstable if 1 D 2 > 0.
2. If 1 and 2 are pure imaginary, then .0; 0/ is either a center or a spiral
point, and may be either asymptotically stable, stable, or unstable.

6.2 Linear and Almost Linear Systems
389
3. Otherwise—that is, unless 1 and 2 are either real equal or pure
imaginary—the critical point .0; 0/ of the almost linear system in (12) is
of the same type and stability as the critical point .0; 0/ of the associated
linear system in (11).
Thus, if 1 6D 2 and Re.1/ 6D 0, then the type and stability of the critical point
of the almost linear system in (12) can be determined by analysis of its associated
linear system in (11), and only in the case of pure imaginary eigenvalues is the
stability of .0; 0/ not determined by the linear system. Except in the sensitive cases
1 D 2 and Re.i/ D 0, the trajectories near .0; 0/ will resemble qualitatively
those of the associated linear system—they enter or leave the critical point in the
same way, but may be “deformed” in a nonlinear manner. The table in Fig. 6.2.7
summarizes the situation.

Classiﬁcation of critical points of an almost linear system.
An important consequence of the classiﬁcation of cases in Theorem 2 is that
a critical point of an almost linear system is asymptotically stable if it is an asymp-
totically stable critical point of the linearization of the system. Moreover, a critical
point of the almost linear system is unstable if it is an unstable critical point of the
linearized system. If an almost linear system is used to model a physical situation,
then—apart from the sensitive cases mentioned earlier—it follows that the qualita-
tive behavior of the system near a critical point can be determined by examining its
linearization.

Solution
The characteristic equation for the associated linear system (obtained simply by deleting the
quadratic terms in (13)) is
.4  /.3  /  8 D .  5/. C 4/ D 0;
so the eigenvalues 1 D 5 and 2 D 4 are real, unequal, and have opposite signs. By our
discussion of this case we know that .0; 0/ is an unstable saddle point of the linear system,
and hence by Part 3 of Theorem 2, it is also an unstable saddle point of the almost linear
system in (13). The trajectories of the linear system near .0; 0/ are shown in Fig. 6.2.8, and
those of the nonlinear system in (13) are shown in Fig. 6.2.9. Figure 6.2.10 shows a phase

portrait of the nonlinear system in (13) from a “wider view.” In addition to the saddle point
at .0; 0/, there are spiral points near the points .0:279; 1:065/ and .0:933; 1:057/, and a node
near .2:354; 0:483/.
We have seen that the system x0 D f .x; y/, y0 D g.x; y/ with isolated critical
point .x0; y0/ transforms via the substitution x D u C x0, y D v C y0 to an equiv-
alent uv-system with corresponding critical point .0; 0/ and linearization u0 D Ju,
whose coefﬁcient matrix J is the Jacobian matrix in (8) of the functions f and g at
.x0; y0/. Consequently we need not carry out the substitution explicitly; instead, we
can proceed directly to calculate the eigenvalues of J preparatory to application of
Theorem 2.

Bifurcations
The term bifurcation generally refers to something “splitting
apart.” With regard to differential equations or systems involv-
ing a parameter, it refers to abrupt changes in the character of
the solutions as the parameter is changed continuously. Prob-
lems 33 through 36 illustrate sensitive cases in which small
perturbations in the coefﬁcients of a linear or almost linear
system can change the type or stability (or both) of a critical
point.
33. Consider the linear system
dx
dt D 
x  y;
dy
dt D x C 
y:
Show that the critical point .0; 0/ is (a) a stable spiral
point if 
 < 0; (b) a center if 
 D 0; (c) an unstable spi-
ral point if 
 > 0. Thus small perturbations of the system
x0 D y, y0 D x can change both the type and stability of
the critical point. Figures 6.2.13(a)–(e) illustrate the loss
of stability that occurs at 
 D 0 as the parameter increases
from 
 < 0 to 
 > 0.
34. Consider the linear system
dx
dt D x C 
y;
dy
dt D x  y:
Show that the critical point .0; 0/ is (a) a stable spiral
point if 
 < 0; (b) a stable node if 0 5 
 < 1.
Thus
small perturbations of the system x0 D x, y0 D x  y can
change the type of the critical point .0; 0/ without chang-
ing its stability.

the theorem provides no information about the stability of

 itself is a

of increasing size is spawned as the parameter

through the critical value 0.
37. In the case of a two-dimensional system that is not almost
linear, the trajectories near an isolated critical point can
exhibit a considerably more complicated structure than
those near the nodes, centers, saddle points, and spiral
points discussed in this section. For example, consider
the system
dx
dt D x.x3  2y3/;
dy
dt D y.2x3  y3/
(16)
having .0; 0/ as an isolated critical point. This system is
not almost linear because .0; 0/ is not an isolated critical
point of the trivial associated linear system x0 D 0, y0 D 0.
Solve the homogeneous ﬁrst-order equation

where c is an arbitrary constant (Fig. 6.2.14).


An apparently “very weak” spiral point at the origin—meaning one that is
approached very slowly as t increases or decreases (according as it is a sink
or a source).
Some ODE software systems can automatically locate and classify critical
points. For instance, Fig. 6.2.17 shows a screen produced by John Polking’s MAT-
LAB pplane program (cited in the Section 6.1 application).
It shows that the
fourth-quadrant critical point in Fig. 6.2.16 has approximate coordinates .1:5708;
2:1416/, and that the coefﬁcient matrix of the associated linear system has the
positive eigenvalue 1  2:8949 and the negative eigenvalue 2  2:3241. It
therefore follows from Theorem 2 that this critical point is, indeed, a saddle point
of the almost linear system in (1).
FIGURE 6.2.17.
The fourth-quadrant saddle point revealed.
With a general computer algebra system such as Maple or Mathematica, you
may have to do a bit of work yourself—or tell the computer precisely what to do—to
ﬁnd and classify a critical point. For instance, the Maple command
fsolve({--y*cos(x+y--1)=0,x*cos(x--y+1)=0},
{x,y},{x=1..2,y=--3..--2});
or the Mathematica command

FindRoot[{--y*Cos[x+y--1] == 0, x*Cos[x--y+1] == 0},
{x,1,2}, {y,--3,--2}]
will ﬁnd the critical-point coordinates a D 1:5708, b D 2:1416 indicated earlier.
Similarly, Fig. 6.2.18 shows a TI handheld calculation of this critical point. Then
the substitution x D u C a, y D v C b yields the translated system

critical point .1:5708; 2:1416/ of (1) is, indeed, a saddle point.
Use a computer algebra system to ﬁnd and classify the other critical points of
(1) indicated in Fig. 6.2.16. Then investigate similarly an almost linear system of
your own construction. One convenient way to construct such a system is to begin
with a linear system and insert sine or cosine factors resembling the ones in (1).
6.3 Ecological Models: Predators and Competitors
Some of the most interesting and important applications of stability theory involve
the interactions between two or more biological populations occupying the same
environment. We consider ﬁrst a predator–prey situation involving two species.
One species—the predators—feeds on the other species—the prey—which in turn
feeds on some third food item readily available in the environment. A standard
example is a population of foxes and rabbits in a woodland; the foxes (predators)
eat rabbits (the prey), while the rabbits eat certain vegetation in the woodland. Other
examples are sharks (predators) and food ﬁsh (prey), bass (predators) and sunﬁsh
(prey), ladybugs (predators) and aphids (prey), and beetles (predators) and scale
insects (prey).
The classical mathematical model of a predator–prey situation was developed
in the 1920s by the Italian mathematician Vito Volterra (1860–1940) in order to
analyze the cyclic variations observed in the shark and food-ﬁsh populations in the
Adriatic Sea. To construct such a model, we denote the number of prey at time
t by x.t/, the number of predators by y.t/, and make the following simplifying
assumptions.
1. In the absence of predators, the prey population would grow at a natural rate,
with dx=dt D ax, a > 0.

396
Chapter 6 Nonlinear Systems and Phenomena
2. In the absence of prey, the predator population would decline at a natural rate,
with dy=dt D by, b > 0.
3. When both predators and prey are present, there occurs, in combination with
these natural rates of growth and decline, a decline in the prey population and a
growth in the predator population, each at a rate proportional to the frequency
of encounters between individuals of the two species. We assume further that
the frequency of such encounters is proportional to the product xy, reasoning
that doubling either population alone should double the frequency of encoun-
ters, while doubling both populations ought to quadruple the frequency of
encounters. Consequently, the consumption of prey by predators results in

an interaction rate of decline pxy in the prey population x, and

an interaction rate of growth qxy in the predator population y.
When we combine the natural and interaction rates ax and pxy for the prey
population x, as well as the natural and interaction rates by and qxy for the preda-
tor population y, we get the predator–prey system
dx
dt D ax  pxy D x.a  py/;
dy
dt D by C qxy D y.b C qx/;
(1)
with the constants a, b, p, and q all positive. [Note: You may see the predator and
prey equations written in either order in (1). It is important to recognize that the
predator equation has negative linear term and positive interaction term, whereas
the prey equation has positive linear term and negative interaction term.]
Example 1
The Critical Points
A critical point of the general predator–prey system in (1) is a solution
.x; y/ of the equations
x.a  py/ D 0;
y.b C qx/ D 0:
(2)
The ﬁrst of these two equations implies that either x D 0 or y D a=p 6D 0, and the second
implies that either y D 0 or x D b=q 6D 0. It follows readily that this predator–prey system
has the two (isolated) critical points .0; 0/ and .b=q; a=p/.
THE CRITICAL POINT .0; 0/:
The Jacobian matrix of the system in (1) is

The matrix J.0; 0/ has characteristic equation .a  /.b  / D 0 and the eigenvalues 1 D
a > 0, 2 D b < 0 with different signs. Hence it follows from Theorems 1 and 2 in Section
6.2 that the critical point .0; 0/ is an unstable saddle point, both of the predator–prey system
and of its linearization at .0; 0/. The corresponding equilibrium solution x.t/  0, y.t/  0
merely describes simultaneous extinction of the prey (x) and predator (y) populations.

It follows from Theorem 1 in Section 6.2 that the linearization of the predator–prey system at

6.3 Ecological Models: Predators and Competitors
397
.b=q; a=p/ has a stable center at the origin. Thus we have the indeterminate case of Theorem
2 in Section 6.2, in which case the critical point can (aside from a stable center) also be
either a stable spiral sink or an unstable spiral source of the predator–prey system itself.
Hence further investigation is required to determine the actual character of the critical point
.b=q; a=p/. The corresponding equilibrium solution x.t/  b=q, y.t/  a=p describes the only
nonzero constant prey (x) and predator (y) populations that coexist permanently.
THE PHASE PLANE PORTRAIT:
In Problem 1 we ask you to analyze numerically a
typical predator–prey system and verify that the linearizations at its two critical points agree
qualitatively with the phase plane portrait shown in Fig. 6.3.1—where the nontrivial critical
point appears visually to be a stable center. Of course, only the ﬁrst quadrant of this portrait
corresponds to physically meaningful solutions describing nonnegative populations of prey
and predators.
In Problem 2 we ask you to derive an exact implicit solution of the predator–prey
system of Fig. 6.3.1—a solution that can be used to show that its phase plane trajectories
in the ﬁrst quadrant are, indeed, simple closed curves that encircle the critical point .75; 50/
as indicated in the ﬁgure. It then follows from Problem 30 in Section 6.1 that the explicit
solution functions x.t/ and y.t/ are both periodic functions of t—thus explaining the periodic
ﬂuctuations that are observed empirically in predator–prey populations.

rabbits and 40 foxes. Any other initial point lies on a closed trajectory enclosing this equi-
librium point. The direction ﬁeld indicates that the point .x.t/; y.t// traverses its trajectory
in a counterclockwise direction, with the rabbit and fox populations oscillating periodically
between their separate maximum and minimum values. A drawback is that the phase plane
plot provides no indication as to the speed with which each trajectory is traversed.

tions as functions of time t. In Fig. 6.3.3 we have graphed approximate solution functions
x.t/ and y.t/ calculated using the Runge–Kutta method of Section 4.3 with initial values
x.0/ D 70 and y.0/ D 40. We see that the rabbit population oscillates between the extreme
values xmax  72 and xmin  33, while the fox population oscillates (out of phase) between
the extreme values ymax  70 and ymin  20. A careful measurement indicates that the period
P of oscillation of each population is slightly over 20 months. One could “zoom in” on the
maximum/minimum points on each graph in order to reﬁne these estimates of the period and
the maximum and minimum rabbit and fox populations.
Any positive initial conditions x0 D x.0/ and y0 D y.0/ yield a similar picture, with
the rabbit and fox populations both surviving in coexistence with each other.
Competing Species
Now we consider two species (of animals, plants, or bacteria, for instance) with
populations x.t/ and y.t/ at time t that compete with each other for the food avail-
able in their common environment. This is in marked contrast to the case in which
one species preys on the other. To construct a mathematical model that is as realistic
as possible, let us assume that in the absence of either species, the other would have
a bounded (logistic) population like those considered in Section 2.1. In the absence
of any interaction or competition between the two species, their populations x.t/
and y.t/ would then satisfy the differential equations
dx
dt D a1x  b1x2;
dy
dt D a2y  b2y2;
(6)
each of the form of Eq. (2) of Section 2.1. But in addition, we assume that competi-
tion has the effect of a rate of decline in each population that is proportional to their
product xy. We insert such terms with negative proportionality constants c1 and
c2 in the equations in (6) to obtain the competition system
dx
dt D a1x  b1x2  c1xy D x.a1  b1x  c1y/;
dy
dt D a2y  b2y2  c2xy D y.a2  b2y  c2x/;
(7)
where the coefﬁcients a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, and c2 are all positive.
The almost linear system in (7) has four critical points. Upon setting the right-
hand sides of the two equations equal to zero, we see that if x D 0, then either y D 0
or y D a2=b2, whereas if y D 0, then either x D 0 or x D a1=b1. This gives the three
critical points .0; 0/, .0; a2=b2/, and .a1=b1; 0/. The fourth critical point is obtained
from the simultaneous solution of the equations
b1x C c1y D a1;
c2x C b2y D a2:
(8)
We assume that, as in most interesting applications, these equations have a single
solution and that the corresponding critical point lies in the ﬁrst quadrant of the xy-
plane. This point .xE; yE/ is then the fourth critical point of the system in (7), and
it represents the possibility of coexistence of the two species, with constant nonzero
equilibrium populations x.t/  xE and y.t/  yE.

6.3 Ecological Models: Predators and Competitors
399
We are interested in the stability of the critical point .xE; yE/. This turns out
to depend on whether
c1c2 < b1b2
or
c1c2 > b1b2:
(9)
Each inequality in (9) has a natural interpretation. Examining the equations in (6),
we see that the coefﬁcients b1 and b2 represent the inhibiting effect of each popula-
tion on its own growth (possibly due to limitations of food or space). On the other
hand, c1 and c2 represent the effect of competition between the two populations.
Thus b1b2 is a measure of inhibition, while c1c2 is a measure of competition. A
general analysis of the system in (7) shows the following:
1. If c1c2 < b1b2, so that competition is small in comparison with inhibition, then
.xE; yE/ is an asymptotically stable critical point that is approached by each
solution as t ! C1. Thus the two species can and do coexist in this case.
2. If c1c2 > b1b2, so that competition is large in comparison with inhibition, then
.xE; yE/ is an unstable critical point, and either x.t/ or y.t/ approaches zero
as t ! C1. Thus the two species cannot coexist in this case; one survives
and the other becomes extinct.
Rather than carrying out this general analysis, we present two examples that
illustrate these two possibilities.
Example 3
Survival of a Single Species
Suppose that the populations x.t/ and y.t/ satisfy the equa-
tions

in which a1 D 14, a2 D 16, b1 D b2 D 1
2, and c1 D c2 D 1. Then c1c2 D 1 > 1
4 D b1b2,
so we should expect survival of a single species as predicted in Case 2 previously. We ﬁnd
readily that the four critical points are .0; 0/, .0; 32/, .28; 0/, and .12; 8/. We shall investigate
them individually.

Now that our local analysis of each of the four critical points is complete, it remains to
assemble the information found into a coherent global picture. If we accept the facts that

Near each critical point, the trajectories for the original system in (10) resemble quali-
tatively the linearized trajectories shown in Figs. 6.3.4–6.3.7, and

As t ! C1 each trajectory either approaches a critical point or diverges toward inﬁn-
ity,
then it would appear that the phase plane portrait for the original system must resemble the
rough sketch shown in Fig. 6.3.8. This sketch shows a few typical freehand trajectories
connecting a nodal source at .0; 0/, nodal sinks at .0; 32/ and .28; 0/, and a saddle point at
.12; 8/, with indicated directions of ﬂow along these trajectories consistent with the known
character of these critical points. Figure 6.3.9 shows a more precise computer-generated
phase portrait and direction ﬁeld for the nonlinear system in (10).

The two trajectories that approach the saddle point .12; 8/, together with that saddle
point, form a separatrix that separates Regions I and II in Figure 6.3.8. It plays a crucial role
in determining the long-term behavior of the two populations. If the initial point .x0; y0/ lies
precisely on the separatrix, then .x.t/; y.t// approaches .12; 8/ as t ! C1. Of course, ran-
dom events make it extremely unlikely that .x.t/; y.t// will remain on the separatrix. If not,
peaceful coexistence of the two species is impossible. If .x0; y0/ lies in Region I above the
separatrix, then .x.t/; y.t// approaches .0; 32/ as t ! C1, so the population x.t/ decreases
to zero. Alternatively, if .x0; y0/ lies in Region II below the separatrix, then .x.t/; y.t// ap-
proaches .28; 0/ as t ! C1, so the population y.t/ dies out. In short, whichever population
has the initial competitive advantage survives, while the other faces extinction.

now the effect of inhibition is greater than that of competition. We ﬁnd readily that the four
critical points are .0; 0/, .0; 8/, .7; 0/, and .4; 6/. We proceed as in Example 3.

THE CRITICAL POINT (0, 0):
When we drop the quadratic terms in (18), we get the
same linearization x0 D 14x, y0 D 16y at .0; 0/ as in Example 3. Thus its coefﬁcient matrix
has the two positive eigenvalues 1 D 14 and 2 D 16, and its phase portrait is the same as
that shown in Fig. 6.3.4. Therefore, .0; 0/ is an unstable nodal source for the original system
in (18).

other. Examples 3 and 4 illustrate cases in which the xy-coefﬁcients c1 and c2
are both positive. The interaction between the two populations is then described
as competition, because the effect of the xy-terms in (25) is to decrease the rates
of growth of both populations—that is, each population is “hurt” by their mutual
interaction.
Suppose, however, that the interaction coefﬁcients c1 and c2 in (25) are both
negative. Then the effect of the xy-terms is to increase the rates of growth of both
populations—that is, each population is “helped” by their mutual interaction. This
type of interaction is aptly described as cooperation between the two logistic pop-
ulations.
Finally, the interaction between the two populations is one of predation if the
interaction coefﬁcients have different signs. For instance, if c1 > 0 but c2 < 0, then
the x-population is hurt but the y-population is helped by their interaction. We may
therefore describe x.t/ as a prey population and y.t/ as a predator population.
If either b1 or b2 is zero in (25), then the corresponding population would (in
the absence of the other) exhibit exponential growth rather than logistic growth. For
instance, suppose that a1 > 0, a2 < 0, b1 D b2 D 0, and c1 > 0, c2 < 0. Then x.t/
is a naturally growing prey population while y.t/ is a naturally declining predator
population. This is the original predator–prey model with which we began this
section.
Problems 26 through 34 illustrate a variety of the possibilities indicated here.
The problems and examples in this section illustrate the power of elementary
critical-point analysis. But remember that ecological systems in nature are seldom
so simple as in these examples. Frequently they involve more than two species,
and the growth rates of these populations and the interactions among them often are
more complicated than those discussed in this section. Consequently, the mathe-
matical modeling of ecological systems remains an active area of current research.

1. Starting with the Jacobian matrix of the system in (1), de-
rive its linearizations at the two critical points .0; 0/ and
.75; 50/. Use a graphing calculator or computer system
to construct phase plane portraits for these two lineariza-

Fig. 6.3.1.
2. Separate the variables in the quotient

of the two equations in (1), and thereby derive the exact
implicit solution
200 ln y C 150 ln x  2x  4y D C
of the system. Use the contour plot facility of a graphing
calculator or computer system to plot the contour curves
of this equation through the points .75; 100/, .75; 150/,
.75; 200/, .75; 250/, and .75; 300/ in the xy-plane. Are
your results consistent with Fig. 6.3.1?
3. Let x.t/ be a harmful insect population (aphids?) that un-
der natural conditions is held somewhat in check by a be-
nign predator insect population y.t/ (ladybugs?). Assume
that x.t/ and y.t/ satisfy the predator–prey equations in
(1), so that the stable equilibrium populations are xE D b=q
and yE D a=p. Now suppose that an insecticide is em-
ployed that kills (per unit time) the same fraction f < a
of each species of insect. Show that the harmful popula-
tion xE is increased, while the benign population yE is de-
creased, so the use of the insecticide is counterproductive.
This is an instance in which mathematical analysis reveals
undesirable consequences of a well-intentioned interfer-
ence with nature.

6.3 Application Your Own Wildlife Conservation Preserve
You own a large wildlife conservation preserve that you originally stocked with F0
foxes and R0 rabbits on January 1, 2007. The following differential equations model
the numbers R.t/ of rabbits and F.t/ foxes t months later:
dR
dt D .0:01/pR  .0:0001/aRF;
dF
dt D .0:01/qF C .0:0001/bRF;
where p and q are the two largest digits (with p < q) and a and b are the two smallest
nonzero digits (with a < b) in your student ID number.
The numbers of foxes and rabbits will oscillate periodically, out of phase with
each other (like the functions x.t/ and y.t/ in Fig. 6.3.3). Choose your initial num-
bers F0 of foxes and R0 of rabbits—perhaps several hundred of each—so that the
resulting solution curve in the RF-plane is a fairly eccentric closed curve. (The
eccentricity may be increased if you begin with a relatively large number of rab-
bits and a small number of foxes, as any wildlife preserve owner would naturally
do—because foxes prey on rabbits.)
Your task is to determine
1. The period of oscillation of the rabbit and fox populations;
2. The maximum and minimum numbers of rabbits, and the calendar dates on
which they ﬁrst occur;
3. The maximum and minimum numbers of foxes, and the calendar dates on
which they ﬁrst occur.
With computer software that can plot both RF-trajectories and tR- and tF-solution
curves like those in Figs. 6.3.2 and 6.3.3, you can “zoom in” graphically on the
points whose coordinates provide the requested information.

Chapter 6 Nonlinear Systems and Phenomena
6.4 Nonlinear Mechanical Systems
Now we apply the qualitative methods of Sections 6.1 and 6.2 to the analysis of
simple mechanical systems like the mass-on-a-spring system shown in Fig. 6.4.1.
Let m denote the mass in a suitable system of units and let x.t/ denote the dis-
placement of the mass at time t from its equilibrium position (in which the spring
is unstretched). Previously we have always assumed that the force F.x/ exerted by
the spring on the mass is a linear function of x: F.x/ D kx (Hooke’s law). In
reality, however, every spring in nature actually is nonlinear (even if only slightly
so). Moreover, springs in some automobile suspension systems deliberately are de-
x(t)

signed to be nonlinear. Here, then, we are interested speciﬁcally in the effects of
nonlinearity.
So now we allow the force function F.x/ to be nonlinear. Because F.0/ D 0 at
the equilibrium position x D 0, we may assume that F has a power series expansion
of the form
F.x/ D kx C ˛x2 C ˇx3 C    :
(1)
We take k > 0 so that the reaction of the spring is directed opposite to the displace-
ment when x is sufﬁciently small. If we assume also that the reaction of the spring
is symmetric with respect to positive and negative displacements by the same dis-
tance, then F.x/ D F.x/, so F is an odd function. In this case it follows that the
coefﬁcient of xn in Eq. (1) is zero if n is even, so the ﬁrst nonlinear term is the one
involving x3.
For a simple mathematical model of a nonlinear spring we therefore take
F.x/ D kx C ˇx3;
(2)
ignoring all terms in Eq. (1) of degree greater than 3. The equation of motion of the
mass m is then
mx00 D kx C ˇx3:
(3)
The Position–Velocity Phase Plane
If we introduce the velocity
y.t/ D x0.t/
(4)
of the mass with position x.t/, then we get from Eq. (3) the equivalent ﬁrst-order
system
dx
dt D y;
mdy
dt D kx C ˇx3:
(5)
A phase plane trajectory of this system is a position-velocity plot that illustrates the
motion of the mass on the spring. We can solve explicitly for the trajectories of this
system by writing
dy
dx D dy=dt
dx=dt D kx C ˇx3

as the potential energy of the spring. Then Eq. (6) takes the form KE C PE D E,
so the constant E turns out to be the total energy of the mass-spring system. Eq. (6)
then expresses conservation of energy for the undamped motion of a mass on a
spring.
The behavior of the mass depends on the sign of the nonlinear term in Eq. (2).
The spring is called

hard if ˇ < 0,

soft if ˇ > 0.
We consider the two cases separately.

the position x.t/ and velocity y.t/ of the mass oscillate alternately, as illustrated in

left when y < 0. Thus the behavior of a mass on a nonlinear hard spring resembles
qualitatively that of a mass on a linear spring with ˇ D 0 (as in Example 3 of Section
6.1). But one difference between the linear and nonlinear situations is that, whereas
the period T D 2
p
m=k of oscillation of a mass on a linear spring is independent
of the initial conditions, the period of a mass on a nonlinear spring depends on its
initial position x.0/ and initial velocity y.0/ (Problems 21 through 26).

(writing k=m D !2 as usual). The latter matrix has characteristic equation 2 C !2 D 0 and

has a stable center at the critical point .0; 0/—as we observed in Example 4 of Section 6.1.
However, the nonlinear cubic term in the differential equation has (in effect) replaced the
elliptical trajectories (as in Fig. 6.1.8) of the linear system with the “ﬂatter” quartic ovals we
see in Fig. 6.4.2.

in addition to the critical point .0; 0/. These three critical points yield
the only solutions for which the mass can remain at rest. The following example

we could select a ﬁxed value of the constant energy E and plot manually a trajectory like one
of those shown in the computer-generated position–velocity phase plane portrait in Fig. 6.4.4.
The different types of phase plane trajectories correspond to different values of the
energy E. If we substitute x D ˙
p
k=ˇ and y D 0 into (6), we get the energy value E D
k2=.4ˇ/ D 4 (because k D 4 and ˇ D 1) that corresponds to the trajectories that intersect the
x-axis at the nontrivial critical points .2; 0/ and .2; 0/. These emphasized trajectories are
called separatrices because they separate phase plane regions of different behavior.
The nature of the motion of the mass is determined by which type of trajectory its initial
conditions determine. The simple closed trajectories encircling .0; 0/ in the region bounded
by the separatrices correspond to energies in the range 0 < E < 4. These closed trajectories
represent periodic oscillations of the mass back and forth around the equilibrium point x D 0.
The unbounded trajectories lying in the regions above and below the separatrices cor-
respond to values of E greater than 4. These represent motions in which the mass approaches
x D 0 with sufﬁcient energy that it continues on through the equilibrium point, never to return
again (as indicated in Fig. 6.4.5).

Remark Figures 6.4.2 and 6.4.4 illustrate a signiﬁcant qualitative difference between hard
springs with ˇ < 0 and soft springs with ˇ > 0 in the nonlinear equation mx00 D kx C ˇx3.
Whereas the phase plane trajectories for a hard spring are all bounded, a soft spring has
unbounded phase plane trajectories (as well as bounded ones). However, we should realize
that the unbounded soft-spring trajectories cease to represent physically realistic motions
faithfully when they exceed the spring’s capability of expansion without breaking.
Damped Nonlinear Vibrations
Suppose now that the mass on a spring is connected also to a dashpot that provides a
force of resistance proportional to the velocity y D dx=dt of the mass. If the spring
is still assumed nonlinear as in Eq. (2), then the equation of motion of the mass is
mx00 D cx0  kx C ˇx3;

It follows from Theorem 2 in Section 6.2 in that the critical point .0; 0/ of the system
in (13) is

a nodal sink if the resistance is so great that c2 > 4km (in which case the
eigenvalues are negative and unequal), but is

a spiral sink if c2 < 4km (in which case the eigenvalues are complex conju-
gates with negative real part).
The following example illustrates the latter case. (In the borderline case with equal
negative eigenvalues, the origin may be either a nodal or a spiral sink.)

The position–velocity phase plane portrait in Fig. 6.4.6 shows trajectories of (14) and
the spiral sink at .0; 0/, as well as the unstable saddle points at .2; 0/ and .2; 0/. The em-
phasized separatrices divide the phase plane into regions of different behavior. The behavior
of the mass depends on the region in which its initial point .x0; y0/ is located. If this initial
point lies in

Region I between the separatrices, then the trajectory spirals into the origin as t ! C1,
and hence the periodic oscillations of the undamped case (Fig. 6.4.4) are now replaced
with damped oscillations around the stable equilibrium position x D 0;

Region II, then the mass passes through x D 0 moving from left to right (x increasing);

Region III, then the mass passes through x D 0 moving from right to left (x decreasing);

Region IV, then the mass approaches (but does not reach) the unstable equilibrium
position x D 2 from the left, but stops and then returns to the left;

Region V, then the mass approaches (but does not reach) the unstable equilibrium po-
sition x D 2 from the right, but stops and then returns to the right.
If the initial point .x0; y0/ lies precisely on one of the separatrices, then the corresponding
trajectory either approaches the stable spiral point or recedes to inﬁnity from a saddle point
as t ! C1.

we used the approximation sin    for  near zero to replace Eq. (15) with the
linear model
d 2
dt2 C !2 D 0;
(16)
where !2 D g=L. The general solution
.t/ D A cos !t C B sin !t
(17)
of Eq. (16) describes oscillations around the equilibrium position  D 0 with circular
frequency ! and amplitude C D .A2 C B2/1=2.
The linear model does not adequately describe the possible motions of the
pendulum for large values of . For instance, the equilibrium solution .t/   of
Eq. (15), with the pendulum standing straight up, does not satisfy the linear equation
in (16). Nor does Eq. (17) include the situation in which the pendulum “goes over
the top” repeatedly, so that .t/ is a steadily increasing rather than an oscillatory
function of t. To investigate these phenomena we must analyze the nonlinear equa-
tion 00 C !2 sin  D 0 rather than merely its linearization 00 C !2 D 0. We also
want to include the possibility of resistance proportional to velocity, so we consider
the general nonlinear pendulum equation

Chapter 6 Nonlinear Systems and Phenomena
The case c > 0 corresponds to damped motion in which there actually is resis-
tance proportional to (angular) velocity. But we examine ﬁrst the undamped case in

The nature of the critical point .n; 0/ depends on whether n is even or odd.

(22)
for which .0; 0/ is the familiar stable center enclosed by elliptical trajectories (as in
Example 3 of Section 6.1). Although this is the delicate case for which Theorem 2

a stable center for the original nonlinear pendulum system in (19).

(23)

the critical point ..2m C 1/; 0/ is a similar saddle point for the original nonlinear
pendulum system in (19).

THE TRAJECTORIES:
We can see how these “even centers” and “odd saddle
points” ﬁt together by solving the system in (19) explicitly for the phase plane tra-
jectories. If we write
dy
dx D dy=dt
dx=dt D !2 sin x
y
and separate the variables,
y dy C !2 sin x dx D 0;
then integration from x D 0 to x D x yields
1
2y2 C !2.1  cos x/ D E:
(24)
We write E for the arbitrary constant of integration because, if physical units are so
chosen that m D L D 1, then the ﬁrst term on the left is the kinetic energy and the
second term the potential energy of the mass on the end of the pendulum. Then E
is the total mechanical energy; Eq. (24) thus expresses conservation of mechanical
energy for the undamped pendulum.
If we solve Eq. (24) for y and use a half-angle identity, we get the equation

The emphasized separatrices in Fig. 6.4.8 correspond to the critical value E D
2!2 of the energy; they enter and leave the unstable critical points .n; 0/ with n
an odd integer. Following the arrows along a separatrix, the pendulum theoretically
approaches a balanced vertical position  D x D .2m C 1/ with just enough energy
to reach it but not enough to “go over the top.” The instability of this equilibrium
position indicates that this behavior may never be observed in practice!

416
Chapter 6 Nonlinear Systems and Phenomena
The simple closed trajectories encircling the stable critical points—all of
which correspond to the downward position  D 2m of the pendulum—represent
periodic oscillations of the pendulum back and forth around the stable equilibrium
position  D 0. These correspond to energies E < 2!2 that are insufﬁcient for the
pendulum to ascend to the vertical upward position—so its back-and-forth motion
is that which we normally associate with a “swinging pendulum.”
The unbounded trajectories with E > 2!2 represent whirling motions of the
pendulum in which it goes over the top repeatedly—in a clockwise direction if y.t/
remains positive, in a counterclockwise direction if y.t/ is negative.
Period of Undamped Oscillation
If the pendulum is released from rest with initial conditions
x.0/ D .0/ D ˛;
y.0/ D 0.0/ D 0;
(26)
then Eq. (24) with t D 0 reduces to
!2.1  cos ˛/ D E:
(27)
Hence E < 2!2 if 0 < ˛ < , so a periodic oscillation of the pendulum ensues.
To determine the period of this oscillation, we subtract Eq. (27) from Eq. (24) and
write the result (with x D  and y D d=dt) in the form

(28)
The period T of time required for one complete oscillation is four times the
amount of time required for  to decrease from  D ˛ to  D 0, one-fourth of an
oscillation. Hence we solve Eq. (28) for dt=d and integrate to get

The inﬁnite series within the second pair of brackets in Eq. (33) gives the
factor T=T0 by which the nonlinear period T is longer than the linearized period.
The table in Fig. 6.4.9, obtained by summing this series numerically, shows how
T=T0 increases as ˛ is increased. Thus T is 0:19% greater than T0 if ˛ D 10ı,
whereas T is 18:03% greater than T0 if ˛ D 90ı. But even a 0:19% discrepancy is

dy
dt D !2 sin x  cy;
(34)
and again the critical points are of the form .n; 0/ where n is an integer. In Prob-
lems 9 through 11 we ask you to verify that

If n is odd, then .n; 0/ is an unstable saddle point of (34), just as in the
undamped case; but

If n is even and c2 > 4!2, then .n; 0/ is a nodal sink; whereas

If n is even and c2 < 4!2, then .n; 0/ is a spiral sink.

Chapter 6 Nonlinear Systems and Phenomena
Figure 6.4.10 illustrates the phase plane trajectories for the more interesting
underdamped case, c2 < 4!2. Other than the physically unattainable separatrix
trajectories that enter unstable saddle points, every trajectory eventually is “trapped”
by one of the stable spiral points .n; 0/ with n an even integer. What this means is
that even if the pendulum starts with enough energy to go over the top, after a certain
(ﬁnite) number of revolutions it has lost enough energy that thereafter it undergoes
damped oscillations around its stable (lower) equilibrium position.

In each of Problems 12 through 16, a second-order equation
of the form x00 C f .x; x0/ D 0, corresponding to a certain
mass-and-spring system, is given. Find and classify the crit-

resemble those shown in Fig. 6.4.6.
14. x00  8x C 2x3 D 0: Here the linear part of the force is re-

Verify that the critical points resemble those shown in

and three types of periodic oscillations.

Verify that the critical points resemble those

In Problems 17 through 20, analyze the critical points of the
indicated system, use a computer system to construct an illus-
trative position–velocity phase plane portrait, and describe the
oscillations that occur.
17. Example 2 in this section illustrates the case of damped
vibrations of a soft mass–spring system. Investigate an
example of damped vibrations of a hard mass–spring sys-
tem by using the same parameters as in Example 2, except
now with ˇ D  5
4 < 0.
18. Example 2 illustrates the case of damped vibrations of a
soft mass–spring system with the resistance proportional
to the velocity. Investigate an example of resistance pro-
portional to the square of the velocity by using the same
parameters as in Example 2, but with resistance term
cx0jx0j instead of cx0 in Eq. (12).
19. Now repeat Example 2 with both the alterations corre-
sponding to Problems 17 and 18. That is, take ˇ D  5
4 < 0
and replace the resistance term in Eq. (12) with cx0jx0j.
20. The equations x0 D y, y0 D  sin x  1
4yjyj model a
damped pendulum system as in Eqs. (34) and Fig. 6.4.10.
But now the resistance is proportional to the square of the
angular velocity of the pendulum. Compare the oscilla-
tions that occur with those that occur when the resistance
is proportional to the angular velocity itself.

6.4 Application The Rayleigh, van der Pol, and FitzHugh-Nagumo
Equations
Here we present a trio of nonlinear differential equations or systems of equations,
drawn from the areas of acoustics, electrical engineering, and neuroscience. Each
of these models has been fundamental within its ﬁeld; taken together, they give
some indication of the importance of nonlinear equations across a wide variety of
applications.
Rayleigh’s Equation
The British mathematical physicist Lord Rayleigh (John William Strutt, 1842–1919)
introduced an equation of the form
mx00 C kx D ax0  b.x0/3
(1)
to model the oscillations of a clarinet reed. With y D x0 we get the autonomous
system
x0 D y;
y0 D kx C ay  by3
m
;
(2)
whose phase plane portrait is shown in Fig. 6.4.15 (for the case m D k D a D b D
1). The outward and inward spiral trajectories converge to a “limit cycle” solution
that corresponds to periodic oscillations of the reed. The period T (and hence the
frequency) of these oscillations can be measured on a tx-solution curve plotted as
in Fig. 6.4.16. This period of oscillation depends only on the parameters m, k, a,
and b in Eq. (1) and is independent of the initial conditions (why?).

Choose your own parameters m, k, a, and b (perhaps the least four nonzero
digits in your student ID number), and use an available ODE plotting utility to
plot trajectories and solution curves as in Figs. 6.4.15 and 6.4.16. Change one of
your parameters to see how the amplitude and frequency of the resulting periodic
oscillations are altered.
Van der Pol’s Equation
Figure 6.4.17 shows a simple RLC circuit in which the usual (passive) resistance R
has been replaced with an active element (such as a vacuum tube or semiconductor)
across which the voltage drop V is given by a known function f .I/ of the current I.
Of course, V D f .I/ D IR for a resistor. If we substitute f .I/ for IR in the familiar
RLC-circuit equation LI 0 CRI CQ=C D 0 of Section 3.7, then differentiation gives

(3)
In a 1924 study of oscillator circuits in early commercial radios, Balthasar van der
Pol (1889–1959) assumed the voltage drop to be given by a nonlinear function of
the form f .I/ D bI 3  aI, which with Eq. (3) becomes
LI 00 C .3bI 2  a/I 0 C I
C D 0:
(4)
This equation is closely related to Rayleigh’s equation and has phase portraits re-
sembling Fig. 6.4.15. Indeed, differentiation of the second equation in (2) and the
resubstitution x0 D y yield the equation
my00 C .3by2  a/y0 C ky D 0;
(5)
which has the same form as Eq. (4).

of van der Pol’s equation.
For every nonnegative value of the parameter , the solution of van der Pol’s
equation with x.0/ D 2, x0.0/ D 0 is periodic, and the corresponding phase plane tra-
jectory is a limit cycle to which the other trajectories converge (as in Fig. 6.4.15). It
will be instructive for you to solve van der Pol’s equation numerically and to plot this
periodic trajectory for a selection of values from  D 0 to  D 1000 or more. With
 D 0 it is a circle of radius 2 (why?). Figure 6.4.18 shows the periodic trajectory
with  D 1, and Fig. 6.4.19 shows the corresponding x.t/ and y.t/ solution curves.
When  is large, van der Pol’s equation is quite “stiff” and the periodic trajectory
is more eccentric as in Fig. 6.4.20, which was plotted using MATLAB’s stiff ODE
solver ode15s. The corresponding x.t/ and y.t/ solution curves in Figs. 6.4.21
and 6.4.22 reveal surprising behavior of these component functions. Each alternates
long intervals of very slow change with periods of abrupt change during very short
time intervals that correspond to the “quasi-discontinuities” that are visible in Figs.
6.4.21 and 6.4.22. For instance, Fig. 6.4.23 shows that, between t D 1614:28 and
t D 1614:29, the value of y.t/ zooms from near zero to over 1300 and back again.

period of circuit around the cycle in Fig. 6.4.20 is approximately T D 1614. Indeed,
this calculation and the construction of ﬁgures like those shown here may serve as
a good test of the robustness of your computer system’s ODE solver.
You might also plot other trajectories for  D 10, 100 or 1000 that (like the
trajectories in Fig. 6.4.18) are “attracted” from within and without by the limit cycle.
The origin looks like a spiral point in Fig 6.4.18. Indeed, show that .0; 0/ is a spiral
source for van der Pol’s equation if 0 <  < 2 but is a nodal source if  	 2.
The FitzHugh-Nagumo Equations
Since the early experiments of Luigi Galvani (1737–1798) in which electrical stim-
ulus caused the leg muscles of dead frogs to twitch, the electrical properties of
neurons, the cells that form the building blocks of the nervous system, have been
intensively studied. One of the most important of those properties is the action po-
tential, an electrical signal that travels from the body of a neuron down along its
axon (Fig. 6.4.24). Action potentials are the units of information of the nervous
system; when an action potential reaches the end of the axon, chemicals known
as neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminals. These neurotransmitters
then ﬁnd receptors in the dendrites of other nerve cells, causing action potentials in
those “target” neurons, and thus propagating the “message.” Because of the great
speed with which action potentials traverse the neuron, they provide a mechanism
by which signals can be rapidly transmitted through the nervous system.
Action potentials are particularly known for their all-or-none character. If the
stimulus received by a target neuron is below a certain threshold, then no action
potential is generated. If this threshold is exceeded, however, then the neuron will
“ﬁre” an action potential, or perhaps (if the stimulus is sufﬁciently strong) several
action potentials in succession. In this way, the nervous system’s method of electri-
cal signaling resembles the binary code used by computers.

The structure of a typical neuron.
In the early 1950’s A. F. Huxley (1917–2012) and A. L. Hodgkin (1914–1988)
published a landmark series of papers in which they modeled the action potential
in the giant axon of the squid as an electrical circuit. The focus of this model was
the neuron’s membrane potential, that is, the voltage difference between the inside
and outside of the nerve cell. In its resting state, a typical neuron has a negative
membrane potential, that is, the inside of the cell is at a lower voltage than the sur-
rounding medium. (We now know that this voltage difference is largely due to “ion
pumps” in the cell membrane, which maintain a lower concentration of positively
charged sodium ions inside the cell than in the surrounding medium. These pumps
require energy, and indeed a signiﬁcant portion of the body’s metabolic energy is
devoted to this task.) Potassium ions also play an important role in neuron electrical
activity.

424
Chapter 6 Nonlinear Systems and Phenomena
During an action potential, the membrane potential exhibits a characteristic
pattern of sudden and rapid changes through positive and negative values as the
electrical signal traverses the neuron. A central goal of Hodgkin and Huxley’s work
was to explain these changes in terms of the sodium and potassium conductances
of the neuron membrane. Conductance—the reciprocal of resistance—is a measure
of the permeability of the membrane to charged ions. An increase in the sodium
conductance, for example, allows sodium ions to ﬂow more freely across the mem-
brane, from areas of high concentration to low. Hodgkin and Huxley proposed
that during an action potential, an electrical stimulus (arising from another neuron
“upstream,” for example) causes changes in the neuron membrane’s sodium and
potassium conductances. This results in a series of ﬂows of charged ions, and thus
electrical currents, across the cell membrane.
The researchers applied circuit theory, including some of the basic principles
discussed in Section 3.7, to model these currents. The result was a system of four
nonlinear differential equations, whose variables are the neuron membrane potential
together with three other quantities related to the membrane’s sodium and potassium
conductances. Not only did the predictions of this model show remarkable accord
with experimental results, they also helped point the way to subsequent discoveries
in neurophysiology. The Hodgkin-Huxley model was a triumph both of experi-
mental technique and theoretical analysis, and remains today the starting point for
mathematical modeling of action potentials. Together with John Eccles, Hodgkin
and Huxley were awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their
work.
Analysis of the Hodgkin-Huxley model can be challenging, however, because
its phase space is four-dimensional, making features such as solution curves difﬁ-
cult to visualize. For this reason, in 1961 Richard FitzHugh (1922–2007) proposed
a two-dimensional simpliﬁcation of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, which was sub-
sequently analyzed in electrical circuit terms by J. Nagumo and others. Whereas
the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations are not intended to capture the physiological prop-
erties of the neuron as directly as the original Hodgkin-Huxley equations do, this
simpliﬁed model is important because it displays much of the qualitative behavior
characteristic of neuron electrical activity, while offering the advantage of being
considerably easier to study.
FitzHugh’s model actually is a generalization of van der Pol’s equation (6).
You can show that introduction of the variable y D 1

stimulus applied to the neuron, and y.t/ is a composite of the other three variables
in the Hodgkin-Huxley model. To simulate neuron electrical activity, we will use
FitzHugh’s values a D 0:7 , b D 0:8, and  D 3, while assigning various constant
values to the stimulus I.t/.
First, with I.t/  0 (corresponding to the resting state of the neuron), you can
verify that the system (7) has exactly one equilibrium point at roughly x D 1:1994
and y D 0:6243. What is striking is the way in which the system responds as
I becomes nonzero (corresponding to electrical stimulation of the neuron). Fig-
ure 6.4.25 shows the solution curves of the system corresponding to the three con-
stant values I.t/  0:15, I.t/  0:17, and I.t/  0:5. The graph on the left
gives the phase plane for x and y, whereas the graph on the right shows x.t/ as
a function of t. All curves begin at time t D 0 at the original equilibrium point

Solutions of the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations (7) with three constant values of the

When the stimulus I.t/ is held at the constant value 0:15, x (which is analo-
gous to the neuron membrane potential) varies slightly from its rest value, but soon
ﬁnds a new “perturbed” equilibrium at which it then remains (blue curves); this
mirrors the behavior of the membrane potential when the neuron receives a stimu-
lus insufﬁciently small to generate an action potential. The response of the system
differs dramatically, however, when the constant stimulus is decreased slightly to
0:17; once again x ﬁnds a new equilibrium, but only after exhibiting wide swings
downward and back upward (dashed curves); this is suggestive of the ﬁring of a
single action potential. Finally, when I.t/  0:5, x oscillates repeatedly, in a man-
ner reminiscent of both the Rayleigh and van der Pol systems (black curves); this
corresponds to repetitive ﬁring of the neuron.
After using your own computer system’s ODE solver to verify these behav-
iors, you can investigate what happens with other constant nonzero values of the
stimulus I.t/. Do all such values lead either to oscillatory phase plane solutions
or to ones that converge to the same perturbed equilibrium point? Or do certain
different values lead to different perturbed equilibrium points? Do all oscillatory
solutions correspond to phase plane curves that appear to converge to a single limit
cycle?
The FitzHugh-Nagumo system has proven to be a very useful simpliﬁcation of
the Hodgkin-Huxley system, exhibiting a number of characteristics of neuron elec-
trical activity. For a more detailed discussion see the classic work of L. Edelstein-
Keshet, Mathematical Models in Biology (Society for Industrial and Applied Math-
ematics, 2005).

Chapter 6 Nonlinear Systems and Phenomena
6.5 Chaos in Dynamical Systems
In preceding sections we have looked at population growth and mechanical systems
from a deterministic point of view—with the expectation that the initial state of a
physical system fully determines its future evolution. But many common systems
exhibit behavior that sometimes appears chaotic, in the sense that future states may
not seem reliably predictable from a knowledge of initial conditions. This section
includes project material illustrating the phenomenon of chaos, which is a topic of
much current interest in science and engineering.
Population Growth and Period Doubling
In Section 2.1 we introduced the logistic differential equation
dP
dt D aP  bP 2
(a, b > 0)
(1)
that models a bounded (rather than exponentially growing) population. Indeed, if
the population P.t/ satisﬁes Eq. (1), then as t ! C1, P.t/ approaches the (ﬁnite)
limiting population M D a=b. We discuss here a “discrete” version of the logistic
equation in the form of a type of “difference equation” that has been studied exten-
sively in the past, but only recently has been discovered to predict quite exotic and
unexpected patterns of behavior for certain populations.
In order to solve Eq. (1) numerically as in Section 2.4, we ﬁrst choose a ﬁxed
step size h > 0 and consider the sequence of discrete times
t0; t1; t2; : : : ; tn; tnC1; : : : ;
(2)
where tnC1 D tn C h for each n. Beginning with the initial value P0 D P.t0/, we
then calculate approximations
P1; P2; : : : ; Pn; PnC1; : : :
(3)
to the true values P.t1/; P.t2/; P.t3/; : : : of the actual population P.t/. For instance,
Euler’s method for the logistic equation in (1) consists of calculating the approxi-
mations in (3) iteratively by means of the formula
PnC1 D Pn C .aPn  bP 2
n /  h:
(4)
Now suppose that the population is one for which the step size h can be cho-
sen so that the approximations calculated using Eq. (4) agree to acceptable accuracy
with the actual population values. This might be the case, for instance, for an ani-
mal or insect population in which all reproduction takes place within short-duration
breeding seasons that recur at regular intervals. If h is the interval between suc-
cessive breeding seasons, then the population Pn during one breeding season may
depend only on the population Pn1 during the previous season, and Pn may com-
pletely determine the population PnC1 during the next breeding season.
So let us assume for the sake of discussion that the successive values Pn D
P.tn/ of the population are given by the equation
PnC1 D Pn C .aPn  bP 2
n /  h:
(4)
Thus we replace the original differential equation in (1) with a “discrete” difference
equation
Pn D .aPn  bP 2
n / t
(5)

6.5 Chaos in Dynamical Systems
427
that gives the population difference Pn D PnC1 Pn in terms of the time difference
h D t and the preceding population Pn.
Equation (4) can be rewritten as the logistic difference equation
PnC1 D rPn  sP 2
n ;
(6)
where
r D 1 C ah
and
s D bh:
(7)
The substitution
Pn D r
s xn
(8)
in Eq. (6) simpliﬁes it still further to
xnC1 D rxn.1  xn/:
(9)
At this point we focus our attention on the ﬁnal iterative formula in Eq. (9).
Beginning with given values of x0 and r, this formula generates a sequence
x1; x2; x3; : : : of values corresponding to the successive times t1; t2; t3; : : : : We may
think of xn, the value at time tn, as the fraction of the maximum population that the
environment can support. Assuming that the limiting fractional population
x1 D lim
n!1 xn
(10)
exists, we want to investigate the way in which x1 depends on the growth parameter
r in Eq. (9). That is, if we regard r as the input to the process and x1 as the output,
we ask how the output depends on the input.
The iteration in Eq. (9) is readily implemented in any available calculator
or computer language. Figure 6.5.1 shows illustrative Maple, Mathematica, and
MATLAB code for a simple program that begins with x1 D 0:5 and calculates and
assembles a list of the ﬁrst couple of hundred (k D 200) iterates with r D 1:5.
Because r D 1 C ah in (7), only values of r greater than 1 are pertinent to
our idealized model of discrete population growth. It turns out that, for a typical
such value of the growth parameter r entered at the ﬁrst line, the results do not
depend materially on the initial value x1. After a reasonable number of iterations—
the number required depends on the value of r—the value of xn generally appears
to “stabilize” on a limiting value x1 as in Eq. (10). For example, Fig. 6.5.2 shows
Maple
Mathematica
MATLAB
r := 1.5:
x = array(1..200):
x[1] := 0.5:
for n from 2 to 200 do
z := x[n--1]:
x[n] := r*z*(1--z):
od:
r = 1.5;
x = Table[n,{n,1,200}];
x[[1]] = 0.5;
For[n=2, n<=200,
n=n+1,
z = x[[n--1]];
x[[n]] = r*z*(1--z)];
r = 1.5;
x = 1:200;
x(1) = 0.5;
for n = 2:200
z = x(n--1);
x(n) = r*z*(1--z);
end

EXERCISE 1:
Try several other values of the growth rate parameter in the range
1 < r < 3. Do your results support the conjecture that the limiting population always
exists and is an increasing function of r?
The results in Fig. 6.5.3 show that the conjecture stated in Exercise 1 is false!
With growth rate parameters r D 3:1 and r D 3:25, the (fractional) population fails
to stabilize on a single limiting population. (We calculated over a thousand iterates
to make sure.) Instead, it oscillates between two different populations in alternate

see that

Thus we have not a single limiting population, but rather a “limiting cycle” consist-
ing of two distinct populations (as illustrated graphically in Fig. 6.5.4). Furthermore,
when the growth rate is increased to r D 3:5, the period of the cycle doubles, and
now we have a limiting cycle with a period of 4—the population cycles repeatedly
through the four distinct values 0:5009, 0:8750, 0:3828, and 0:8269 (Fig. 6.5.5).

EXERCISE 2:
Try values of the growth rate parameter in the range 2:9 < r < 3:1
to determine as closely as possible just where the single limiting population splits
(as r increases) into a cycle of period 2. Does this appear to happen just as r
exceeds 3?
The results shown in Fig. 6.5.6 indicate that a cycle with period 8 is obtained
with the growth rate parameter value r D 3:55. Events are now changing quite
rapidly.
EXERCISE 3:
Verify that a cycle with period 16 is obtained with the growth rate
parameter value r D 3:565.
EXERCISE 4:
See if you can ﬁnd a cycle of period 32 somewhere between r D
3:565 and r D 3:570.
This is the phenomenon of period doubling for which the innocuous-looking
iteration xnC1 D rxn.1  xn/ has become famous in recent years. As the growth
rate parameter is increased beyond r D 3:56, period doubling occurs so rapidly
that utter chaos appears to break out somewhere near r D 3:57. Thus the graph

shown in Fig. 6.5.7 indicates that, with r D 3:57, the earlier periodicity seems to
have disappeared. No periodic cycle is evident, and the population appears to be
changing (from one month to the next) in some essentially random fashion. Indeed,
the deterministic population growth that is observed with smaller parameter values
seems now to have degenerated into a nondeterministic process of apparently ran-
dom change. That is, although the entire sequence of population values is certainly
determined by the values x1 D 0:5 and r D 3:57, successive population values for n
large do not now appear to be “predicted” or determined in any systematic fashion
by the immediately preceding values.

With r D 3:57: Chaos!
The solutions and applications manuals accompanying this text include MAT-
LAB, Mathematica, and other versions of a program called PICHFORK. This pro-
gram produces a visual presentation of the way in which the behavior of our iteration
depends on the value of the growth parameter r. For each value of r in the input
interval a 5 r 5 b (the horizontal axis in the resulting diagram), 1000 iterations
are ﬁrst carried out to achieve “stability.” Then the next 250 values of x generated
by the iteration are plotted on the vertical axis—that is, the screen pixel at .r; x/ is
“turned on.” The descriptively named “pitchfork diagram” that results then shows
at a glance whether a given value of r corresponds to a cycle (with ﬁnite period) or
to chaos. If the resolution in the picture sufﬁces to make it clear that only ﬁnitely
many values of x are placed above a given value of r, then we see that the iteration
is “eventually periodic” for that speciﬁc value of the growth rate parameter.
Figure 6.5.8 shows the pitchfork diagram for the range 2:8 5 r 5 4:0. Scanning
from left to right, we see a single limiting population until r  3, then a cycle with
period 2 until r  3:45, then a cycle of period 4, then one of period 8, and so forth,

splits successively into cycles of periods 6, 12, 24, : : : (Figs. 6.5.10 and 6.5.11). This
period doubling beginning with a cycle of period 3 is especially signiﬁcant—a fun-
damental article by James Yorke and T.-Y. Li in the 1975 American Mathematical
Monthly was entitled “Period Three Implies Chaos.” According to this article, the
existence of a cycle of period 3 (for an appropriate iteration) implies the existence
of cycles of every other (ﬁnite) period, as well as chaotic “cycles” with no period at
all.
PROJECT 1:
Use Program PICHFORK to search for other interesting cycles, and
verify their apparent periods by appropriate iterative computations. For instance,
you should ﬁnd a cycle with period 10 between r D 3:60 and r D 3:61, and one with
period 14 between r D 3:59 and r D 3:60. Can you ﬁnd cycles with period 5 and 7?
If so, look for subsequent period doubling. A run of PICHFORK requires several
hundred thousand iterations, so it will help if you have a fast computer (or one you
can leave running overnight).
As we scan the pitchfork diagram (Fig. 6.5.8) from left to right, we spot the
successive values r1; r2; r3; : : : of the growth rate parameter at which a bifurcation
or qualitative change in the iteration xnC1 D rxn.1  xn/ occurs as the value of r is

increased further. These are the discrete values of r at which any sufﬁciently small
increase in the growth parameter doubles the period of the iteration. In the 1970s the
Los Alamos physicist Mitchell Feigenbaum discovered that a certain order underlies
this period doubling toward chaos:
lim
k!1
rk  rk1
rkC1  rk
D 4:66920160981 : : :
(11)
The fraction on the left in Eq. (11) is the ratio of the lengths of successive constant-
period “windows” in the pitchfork diagram. It is the fact that this ratio approaches
a limit as k ! C1, rather than the speciﬁc value of this limit, that demonstrates a
sort of order underlying the period doubling observed with the particular iteration
xnC1 D rxn.1  xn/. On the other hand, it is now known that precisely the same
Feigenbaum constant 4:66920160981 : : : plays exactly the same role for a wide va-
riety of period-doubling phenomena arising in many different areas of science.
PROJECT 2:
Feigenbaum used a (now long obsolete) HP-65 pocket calculator
(rather than a powerful computer) to carry out the computations leading to the dis-
covery of his famous constant. Perhaps you would like to use iterative computations
and=or PICHFORK to isolate the ﬁrst few bifurcation values r1; r2; r3; : : : with sufﬁ-
cient accuracy to verify that the limit in (11) is approximately 4:67. You can consult
pages 124–126 of T. Gray and J. Glynn, Exploring Mathematics with Mathematica
(New York: Addison-Wesley, 1991) for a fancier approach.
Period Doubling in Mechanical Systems
In Section 6.4 we introduced the second-order differential equation
mx00 C cx0 C kx C ˇx3 D 0
(12)
to model the free velocity-damped vibrations of a mass on a nonlinear spring. Recall
that the term kx in Eq. (12) represents the force exerted on the mass by a linear
spring, whereas the term ˇx3 represents the nonlinearity of an actual spring.
We now want to discuss the forced vibrations that result when an external
force F.t/ D F0 cos !t acts on the mass. With such a force adjoined to the system
in Eq. (12), we obtain the forced Dufﬁng equation
mx00 C cx0 C kx C ˇx3 D F0 cos !t
(13)

Chapter 6 Nonlinear Systems and Phenomena
for the displacement x.t/ of the mass from its equilibrium position. For most values
of the parameters it is impossible to solve Eq. (13) explicitly for x.t/. Nevertheless,
its solutions can be portrayed qualitatively by means of [numerically approximated]
phase plane trajectories like those we used in Section 6.4 to describe free vibrations
of nonlinear mechanical systems.
The Hooke’s constant k is positive for a typical spring that resists displacement

from equilibrium. But there do exist simple mechanical systems that emulate a
spring having a negative Hooke’s constant. For example, Fig. 6.5.12 shows a mass
m atop a vertical metal ﬁlament. We assume that the thin metal ﬁlament can oscillate
only in a vertical plane, and behaves like a ﬂexible column that “buckles” or bends
when the mass is displaced to either side of the vertical position. Then there is one
stable equilibrium point to the left (x < 0) and another to the right .x > 0/, but
the vertical equilibrium position (x D 0) is unstable. When the mass is displaced
slightly from this unstable equilibrium position, the internal force exerted on it is
repulsive rather than attractive; this corresponds to a negative value of k in Eq. (13).
If a periodic force is exerted on the mass by (say) an oscillating electromagnetic
ﬁeld, and air resistance damps its oscillations, then Eq. (13) with k < 0 but with
c > 0 and ˇ > 0 is a reasonable mathematical model for its horizontal displacement
function x.t/.
In the absence of both damping and the external force, the phase plane trajec-
tories of the free oscillations of the mass would resemble those shown in Fig. 6.4.12
(with Problem 14 in Section 6.4). The mass behaves as though it is repelled by the
unstable critical point at x D 0 but is attracted by each of the two stable critical
points symmetrically located on either side of the origin.
We saw in Section 3.6 that in the linear case a periodic external force F.t/ D
F0 cos !t causes a steady periodic response x.t/ D C cos.!t  ˛/ with the same
frequency !. The amplitude C of the steady periodic response is proportional to
the amplitude F0 of the external force. For instance, if the periodic external force is
doubled in amplitude, then the only change in the response is that its amplitude is
doubled as well.
To illustrate the quite different behavior of a nonlinear system, we take k D 1
and m D c D ˇ D ! D 1 in Eq. (13), so the differential equation is
x00 C x0  x C x3 D F0 cos t:
(14)
As an exercise you may verify that the two stable critical points are .1; 0/ and
.1; 0/.
We want to examine the dependence of the (presumably steady peri-
odic) response x.t/ on the amplitude F0 of the periodic external force of period
2=! D 2.
Figures 6.5.13 through 6.5.16 show the solutions of Eq. (14) obtained with the
successive values F0 D 0:60, 0:70, 0:75, and 0:80 of the amplitude of the external
force. In each case the system was solved numerically with initial conditions x.0/ D
1, x0.0/ D 0 and the resulting solution plotted for the range 100 5 t 5 200 (to show
the steady periodic response remaining after the initial transient response has died
out). Part (a) of each ﬁgure shows the phase plane trajectory x D x.t/, y D x0.t/, and
part (b) shows the actual solution curve x D x.t/ in the tx-plane. Part (a) exhibits
the qualitative character of the solution more vividly, but part (b) is required to
determine the period and frequency of the solution.
Figure 6.5.13 shows a simple oscillation of period 2 of the mass around
the right-hand critical point. In the ensuing sequence of ﬁgures we see successive
period doubling and ﬁnally chaos as the amplitude of the external force is increased
in the range from F0 D 0:6 to F0 D 0:8. This period doubling toward chaos is
a common characteristic of the behavior of a nonlinear mechanical system as an

PROJECT 3:
Use an ODE plotting utility to see whether you can reproduce
Figs. 6.5.13–6.5.16. Then investigate the parameter range 1:00 5 F0 5 1:10 for
the force constant in Eq. (14). With F0 D 1:00 you should see a period 6 phase
plane trajectory that encircles both stable critical points (as well as the unstable
one). The period doubles around F0 D 1:07 and chaos sets in around F0 D 1:10. See
whether you can spot a second period doubling somewhere between F0 D 1:07 and
F0 D 1:10. Produce both phase plane trajectories and tx-solution curves on which
you can measure the periods.
Warning You should not expect your own hardware and ODE software to replicate the ex-
act detail of the “chaotic tangle” shown in Fig. 6.5.16. To explain why, let’s regard the forced
Dufﬁng equation (in (14)) with F0 D 0:80 as an input–output system having the initial point
.x.0/; x0.0// as input and the corresponding solution x.t/ as output. This input–output system
is chaotic in the sense that very small changes in the input may cause very large changes in
the output. For instance, the data shown in the table in Fig. 6.5.17 were generated using MAT-
LAB’s sophisticated numerical solver ode45 with two nearby initial points and two different
error tolerance settings. Solving the same numerical initial value problem repeatedly with dif-
ferent error tolerances can provide some indication of the reliability of the results; signiﬁcant

discrepancies certainly suggest little reliability. With initial conditions x.0/ D 1, x0.0/ D 0 it
looks plausible (though hardly certain) that x.100/  1:1 and x.200/  0:6, but the value
of x.300/ remains quite uncertain. By contrast, with initial conditions x.0/ D 1:000001,
x0.0/ D 0 it appears that perhaps x.200/  0:3 instead. If so, then a visually signiﬁcant
change in the solution results from a change of initial conditions no larger than might be ex-
pected from accumulated roundoff error in the course of a numerical approximation process
that relies on machine arithmetic. In this event, any numerically computed solution is likely
to diverge appreciably from the true solution over a long time interval. Hence we cannot be
conﬁdent of the ﬁne structure in a numerically generated trajectory such as that shown in
Fig. 6.5.16. Investigations like this suggest only that the actual long-interval solution with
initial conditions x.0/ D 1, x0.0/ D 0 is not periodic, but instead “wanders” back and forth in
a seemingly unpredictable or chaotic fashion. Thus the qualitative character of the solution
indicated in Fig. 6.5.16 may approximate reality without necessarily presenting an accurate
picture of the precise detail of the trajectory. This behavior of solutions of the forced Dufﬁng
equation is not yet fully understood and remains a subject of current research. An interesting
exposition with further references can be found in Chapter 15 of Dan Schwalbe and Stan
Wagon, VisualDSolve (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1997).

doubling phenomena are characteristic of such systems. But in higher dimensions
even more exotic phenomena occur and are currently the subject of much active
investigation. All this work stems ultimately from the original investigation of an
extraordinary three-dimensional nonlinear system by the mathematical meteorolo-
gist E. N. Lorenz, who later described its discovery as follows.
By the middle 1950s “numerical weather prediction,” i.e., forecasting by
numerically integrating such approximations to the atmospheric equa-
tions as could feasibly be handled, was very much in vogue, despite the
rather mediocre results which it was then yielding. A smaller but de-
termined group favored statistical prediction. : : : I was skeptical, and
decided to test the idea by applying the statistical method to a set of
artiﬁcial data, generated by solving a system of equations numerically.
: : : The ﬁrst task was to ﬁnd a suitable system of equations to solve. : : :
The system would have to be simple enough : : : and the general solution
would have to be aperiodic, since the statistical prediction of a periodic
series would be a trivial matter, once the periodicity had been detected
: : : [In the course of talks with Dr. Barry Saltzman] he showed me some
work on thermal convections, in which he used a system of seven ordi-
nary differential equations. Most of his solutions soon acquired periodic
behavior, but one solution refused to settle down. Moreover, in this so-
lution four of the variables appeared to approach zero. Presumably the
equations governing the remaining three variables, with the terms con-
taining the four variables eliminated, would also possess aperiodic so-
lutions. Upon my return I put the three equations on our computer, and
conﬁrmed the aperiodicity which Saltzman had noted. We were ﬁnally
in business. [Quoted in E. Hairer, S. P. Norsett, and G. Wanner, Solving

by a random number on the left, and so on. Given the meteorological origin of the
Lorenz system, one naturally thinks of a random number of clear days followed by
a random number of rainy days, then a random number of clear days followed by a
random number of rainy days, and so on.
Further investigation of this Lorenz trajectory shows that it is not simply os-
cillating back and forth around a pair of critical points (as Fig. 6.5.18 may initially
suggest). Instead, as t ! C1, the solution point P.t/ on the trajectory wanders
back and forth in space approaching closer and closer to a certain complicated set
of points whose detailed structure is not yet fully understood. This elusive set that
appears somehow to “attract” the solution point is the famous Lorenz strange at-
tractor.

Methods
7.1 Laplace Transforms and Inverse Transforms
I
n Chapter 3 we saw that linear differential equations with constant coefﬁcients
have numerous applications and can be solved systematically. There are common
situations, however, in which the alternative methods of this chapter are preferable.
For example, recall the differential equations
mx00 C cx0 C kx D F.t/
and
LI 00 C RI 0 C 1
C I D E0.t/
corresponding to a mass–spring–dashpot system and a series RLC circuit, respec-
tively.
It often happens in practice that the forcing term, F.t/ or E0.t/, has
discontinuities—for example, when the voltage supplied to an electrical circuit is
turned off and on periodically. In this case the methods of Chapter 3 can be quite
awkward, and the Laplace transform method is more convenient.
The differentiation operator D can be viewed as a transformation which, when
applied to the function f .t/, yields the new function Dff .t/g D f 0.t/. The Laplace
transformation ˇ involves the operation of integration and yields the new function
ˇff .t/g D F.s/ of a new independent variable s. The situation is diagrammed in
Fig. 7.1.1. After learning in this section how to compute the Laplace transform F.s/
of a function f .t/, we will see in Section 7.2 that the Laplace transform converts
a differential equation in the unknown function f .t/ into an algebraic equation in
F.s/. Because algebraic equations are generally easier to solve than differential
equations, this is one method that simpliﬁes the problem of ﬁnding the solution
f .t/.

Chapter 7 Laplace Transform Methods
DEFINITION
The Laplace Transform
Given a function f .t/ deﬁned for all t = 0, the Laplace transform of f is the
function F deﬁned as follows:
F.s/ D ˇff .t/g D
Z 1
0
estf .t/ dt
(1)
for all values of s for which the improper integral converges.
Recall that an improper integral over an inﬁnite interval is deﬁned as a limit
of integrals over bounded intervals; that is,
Z 1
a
g.t/ dt D lim
b!1
Z b
a
g.t/ dt:
(2)
If the limit in (2) exists, then we say that the improper integral converges; otherwise,
it diverges or fails to exist. Note that the integrand of the improper integral in (1)
contains the parameter s in addition to the variable of integration t. Therefore, when
the integral in (1) converges, it converges not merely to a number, but to a function
F of s. As in the following examples, it is typical for the improper integral in the
deﬁnition of ˇff .t/g to converge for some values of s and diverge for others.
Example 1
With f .t/  1 for t = 0, the deﬁnition of the Laplace transform in (1) gives

and therefore
ˇf1g D 1
s
for
s > 0:
(3)
As in (3), it’s good practice to specify the domain of the Laplace transform—in problems as
well as in examples. Also, in this computation we have used the common abbreviation
h
g.t/

a D lim
b!1

(4)
Remark The limit we computed in Example 1 would not exist if s < 0, for then .1=s/ebs
would become unbounded as b ! C1. Hence ˇf1g is deﬁned only for s > 0. This is typical
of Laplace transforms; the domain of a transform is normally of the form s > a for some
number a.
Example 2
With f .t/ D eat for t = 0, we obtain

If s  a > 0, then e.sa/t ! 0 as t ! C1, so it follows that

for
s > a:
(5)
Note here that the improper integral giving ˇfeatg diverges if s 5 a. It is worth noting also
that the formula in (5) holds if a is a complex number. For then, with a D ˛ C iˇ,
e.sa/t D eiˇte.s˛/t ! 0
as t ! C1, provided that s > ˛ D ReŒa; recall that eiˇt D cos ˇt C i sin ˇt.

7.1 Laplace Transforms and Inverse Transforms

The Laplace transform ˇftag of a power function is most conveniently ex-
pressed in terms of the gamma function .x/, which is deﬁned for x > 0 by the
formula
.x/ D

Section 8.5, where it is shown that

and that
.x C 1/ D x.x/

for x > 0. It then follows that if n is a positive integer, then

thus
.n C 1/ D nŠ
(9)
if n is a positive integer. Therefore, the function .x C 1/, which is deﬁned and
continuous for all x > 1, agrees with the factorial function for x D n, a positive
integer.

Suppose that f .t/ D ta where a is real and a > 1. Then

s4 :
As in Problems 1 and 2, these formulas can be derived immediately from the deﬁnition,
without the use of the gamma function.
Linearity of Transforms
It is not necessary for us to proceed much further in the computation of Laplace
transforms directly from the deﬁnition. Once we know the Laplace transforms of
several functions, we can combine them to obtain transforms of other functions. The
reason is that the Laplace transformation is a linear operation.

Inverse Transforms
According to Theorem 3 of this section, no two different functions that are both
continuous for all t = 0 can have the same Laplace transform. Thus if F.s/ is the
transform of some continuous function f .t/, then f .t/ is uniquely determined. This
observation allows us to make the following deﬁnition: If F.s/ D ˇff .t/g, then we
call f .t/ the inverse Laplace transform of F.s/ and write
f .t/ D ˇ1fF.s/g:

NOTATION: FUNCTIONS AND THEIR TRANSFORMS.
Throughout this chapter
we denote functions of t by lowercase letters. The transform of a function will al-
ways be denoted by that same letter capitalized. Thus F.s/ is the Laplace transform
of f .t/ and x.t/ is the inverse Laplace transform of X.s/.
A table of Laplace transforms serves a purpose similar to that of a table of
integrals. The table in Fig. 7.1.2 lists the transforms derived in this section; many
additional transforms can be derived from these few, using various general proper-
ties of the Laplace transformation (which we will discuss in subsequent sections).
Piecewise Continuous Functions
As we remarked at the beginning of this section, we need to be able to handle certain
types of discontinuous functions. The function f .t/ is said to be piecewise contin-
uous on the bounded interval a 5 t 5 b provided that Œa; b can be subdivided into
ﬁnitely many abutting subintervals in such a way that
1. f is continuous in the interior of each of these subintervals; and
2. f .t/ has a ﬁnite limit as t approaches each endpoint of each subinterval from
its interior.

every bounded subinterval of Œ0; C1/. Thus a piecewise continuous function has
only simple discontinuities (if any) and only at isolated points. At such points the
value of the function experiences a ﬁnite jump, as indicated in Fig. 7.1.3. The jump
in f .t/ at the point c is deﬁned to be f .cC/  f .c/, where

unit step function, whose graph appears in Fig. 7.1.4. It is deﬁned as follows:

7.1 Laplace Transforms and Inverse Transforms
443
General Properties of Transforms
It is a familiar fact from calculus that the integral
Z b
a
g.t/ dt
exists if g is piecewise continuous on the bounded interval Œa; b. Hence if f is
piecewise continuous for t = 0, it follows that the integral
Z b
0
estf .t/ dt
exists for all b < C1. But in order for F.s/—the limit of this last integral as
b ! C1—to exist, we need some condition to limit the rate of growth of f .t/ as
t ! C1. The function f is said to be of exponential order as t ! C1 if there
exist nonnegative constants M, c, and T such that
jf .t/j 5 Mect
for t = T:
(23)
Thus a function is of exponential order provided that it grows no more rapidly (as
t ! C1) than a constant multiple of some exponential function with a linear expo-
nent. The particular values of M, c, and T are not so important. What is important
is that some such values exist so that the condition in (23) is satisﬁed.
The condition in (23) merely says that f .t/=ect lies between M and M and
is therefore bounded in value for t sufﬁciently large. In particular, this is true (with
c D 0) if f .t/ itself is bounded. Thus every bounded function—such as cos kt or
sin kt—is of exponential order.
If p.t/ is a polynomial, then the familiar fact that p.t/et ! 0 as t ! C1
implies that (23) holds (for T sufﬁciently large) with M D c D 1. Thus every
polynomial function is of exponential order.
For an example of an elementary function that is continuous and therefore
bounded on every (ﬁnite) interval, but nevertheless is not of exponential order, con-
sider the function f .t/ D et2 D exp.t2/. Whatever the value of c, we see that
lim
t!1
f .t/
ect
D lim
t!1
et2
ect D lim
t!1 et2ct D C1
because t2  ct ! C1 as t ! C1. Hence the condition in (23) cannot hold for any
(ﬁnite) value M, so we conclude that the function f .t/ D et2 is not of exponential
order.
Similarly, because estet2 ! C1 as t ! C1, we see that the improper inte-
gral
R 1
0 estet2 dt that would deﬁne ˇfet2g does not exist (for any s), and therefore
that the function et2 does not have a Laplace transform. The following theorem
guarantees that piecewise functions of exponential order do have Laplace trans-
forms.
THEOREM 2
Existence of Laplace Transforms
If the function f is piecewise continuous for t = 0 and is of exponential order as
t ! C1, then its Laplace transform F.s/ D ˇff .t/g exists. More precisely, if
f is piecewise continuous and satisﬁes the condition in (23), then F.s/ exists for
all s > c.

444
Chapter 7 Laplace Transform Methods
Proof:
First we note that we can take T D 0 in (23). For by piecewise
continuity, jf .t/j is bounded on Œ0; T . Increasing M in (23) if necessary, we can
therefore assume that jf .t/j 5 M if 0 5 t 5 T . Because ect = 1 for t = 0, it then
follows that jf .t/j 5 Mect for all t = 0.
By a standard theorem on convergence of improper integrals—the fact that ab-
solute convergence implies convergence—it sufﬁces for us to prove that the integral
Z 1
0
jestf .t/j dt
exists for s > c. To do this, it sufﬁces in turn to show that the value of the integral
Z b
0
jestf .t/j dt
remains bounded as b ! C1. But the fact that jf .t/j 5 Mect for all t = 0 implies
that

(24)
if s > c. When we take limits as s ! C1, we get the following result.
COROLLARY
F(s) for s Large
If f .t/ satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theorem 2, then
lim
s!1 F.s/ D 0:
(25)
The condition in (25) severely limits the functions that can be Laplace trans-
forms. For instance, the function G.s/ D s=.s C 1/ cannot be the Laplace transform
of any “reasonable” function because its limit as s ! C1 is 1, not 0. More gen-
erally, a rational function—a quotient of two polynomials—can be (and is, as we
shall see) a Laplace transform only if the degree of its numerator is less than that of
its denominator.
On the other hand, the hypotheses of Theorem 2 are sufﬁcient, but not nec-
essary, conditions for existence of the Laplace transform of f .t/. For example, the
function f .t/ D 1=pt fails to be piecewise continuous (at t D 0), but nevertheless

7.1 Laplace Transforms and Inverse Transforms
445
The remainder of this chapter is devoted largely to techniques for solving a
differential equation by ﬁrst ﬁnding the Laplace transform of its solution. It is then
vital for us to know that this uniquely determines the solution of the differential
equation; that is, that the function of s we have found has only one inverse Laplace
transform that could be the desired solution. The following theorem is proved in
Chapter 6 of Churchill’s Operational Mathematics, 3rd ed. (New York: McGraw-
Hill, 1972).
THEOREM 3
Uniqueness of Inverse Laplace Transforms
Suppose that the functions f .t/ and g.t/ satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem 2,
so that their Laplace transforms F.s/ and G.s/ both exist. If F.s/ D G.s/ for
all s > c (for some c), then f .t/ D g.t/ wherever on Œ0; C1/ both f and g are
continuous.
Thus two piecewise continuous functions of exponential order with the same
Laplace transform can differ only at their isolated points of discontinuity. This is
of no importance in most practical applications, so we may regard inverse Laplace
transforms as being essentially unique. In particular, two solutions of a differential
equation must both be continuous, and hence must be the same solution if they have
the same Laplace transform.
Historical Remark
Laplace transforms have an interesting history. The integral in the
deﬁnition of the Laplace transform probably appeared ﬁrst in the work of Euler. It is custom-
ary in mathematics to name a technique or theorem for the next person after Euler to discover
it (else there would be several hundred different examples of “Euler’s theorem”). In this case,
the next person was the French mathematician Pierre Simon de Laplace (1749–1827), who
employed such integrals in his work on probability theory. The so-called operational methods
for solving differential equations, which are based on Laplace transforms, were not exploited
by Laplace. Indeed, they were discovered and popularized by practicing engineers—notably
the English electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925). These techniques were suc-
cessfully and widely applied before they had been rigorously justiﬁed, and around the begin-
ning of the twentieth century their validity was the subject of considerable controversy. One
reason is that Heaviside blithely assumed the existence of functions whose Laplace trans-
forms contradict the condition that F.s/ ! 0 as s ! 0, thereby raising questions as to the
meaning and nature of functions in mathematics. (This is reminiscent of the way Leibniz two
centuries earlier had obtained correct results in calculus using “inﬁnitely small” real numbers,
thereby raising questions as to the nature and role of numbers in mathematics.)

whose evaluation would appear to require a tedious integration by parts. Conse-
quently a computer algebra Laplace transforms package is useful for the quick cal-
culation of transforms. Maple contains the integral transforms package inttrans,
and the commands
with(inttrans):
f := tcos(3t):
F := laplace(f, t, s);
yield immediately the Laplace transform F.s/ D .s2  9/=.s2 C 9/2, as do the Math-
ematica commands
f = tCos[3t];
F = LaplaceTransform[f, t, s]
and the WolframjAlpha query
laplace transform tcos(3t)
We can recover the original function f .t/ D t cos 3t with the Maple command
invlaplace(F, s, t);
or the Mathematica command
InverseLaplaceTransform[F, s, t]
or the WolframjAlpha query
inverse laplace transform (s^2 -- 9)/(s^2 + 9)^2
Remark Note carefully the order of s and t in the preceding Maple and Mathematica
commands—ﬁrst t, then s when transforming; ﬁrst s, then t when inverse transforming.
You can use these computer algebra commands to check the answers to Prob-
lems 11 through 32 in this section, as well as a few interesting problems of your
own selection.
7.2 Transformation of Initial Value Problems
We now discuss the application of Laplace transforms to solve a linear differential
equation with constant coefﬁcients, such as
ax00.t/ C bx0.t/ C cx.t/ D f .t/;
(1)
with given initial conditions x.0/ D x0 and x0.0/ D x0
0. By the linearity of the
Laplace transformation, we can transform Eq. (1) by separately taking the Laplace
transform of each term in the equation. The transformed equation is
aˇfx00.t/g C bˇfx0.t/g C cˇfx.t/g D ˇff .t/gI
(2)
it involves the transforms of the derivatives x0 and x00 of the unknown function x.t/.
The key to the method is Theorem 1, which tells us how to express the transform of
the derivative of a function in terms of the transform of the function itself.

Chapter 7 Laplace Transform Methods
THEOREM 1
Transforms of Derivatives
Suppose that the function f .t/ is continuous and piecewise smooth for t = 0 and
is of exponential order as t ! C1, so that there exist nonnegative constants M,
c, and T such that
jf .t/j 5 Mect
for t = T:
(3)
Then ˇff 0.t/g exists for s > c, and
ˇff 0.t/g D sˇff .t/g  f .0/ D sF.s/  f .0/:
(4)
The function f is called piecewise smooth on the bounded interval Œa; b if it
is piecewise continuous on Œa; b and differentiable except at ﬁnitely many points,
with f 0.t/ being piecewise continuous on Œa; b. We may assign arbitrary values
to f .t/ at the isolated points at which f is not differentiable. We say that f is
piecewise smooth for t = 0 if it is piecewise smooth on every bounded subinterval
of Œ0; C1/. Figure 7.2.1 indicates how “corners” on the graph of f correspond to
discontinuities in its derivative f 0.
The main idea of the proof of Theorem 1 is exhibited best by the case in which
f 0.t/ is continuous (not merely piecewise continuous) for t = 0. Then, beginning

Because of (3), the integrated term estf .t/ approaches zero (when s > c) as t !
C1, and its value at the lower limit t D 0 contributes f .0/ to the evaluation of
the preceding expression. The integral that remains is simply ˇff .t/g; by Theorem
2 of Section 7.1, the integral converges when s > c. Then ˇff 0.t/g exists when
s > c, and its value is that given in Eq. (4). We will defer the case in which f 0.t/
has isolated discontinuities to the end of this section.
Solution of Initial Value Problems
In order to transform Eq. (1), we need the transform of the second derivative as
well. If we assume that g.t/ D f 0.t/ satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theorem 1, then
that theorem implies that
ˇff 00.t/g D ˇfg0.t/g D sˇfg.t/g  g.0/
D sˇff 0.t/g  f 0.0/
D s Œsˇff .t/g  f .0/  f 0.0/;
and thus
ˇff 00.t/g D s2F.s/  sf .0/  f 0.0/:
(5)
A repetition of this calculation gives
ˇff 000.t/g D sˇff 00.t/g  f 00.0/ D s3F.s/  s2f .0/  sf 0.0/  f 00.0/:
(6)
After ﬁnitely many such steps we obtain the following extension of Theorem 1.

Transforms of Higher Derivatives
Suppose that the functions f; f 0; f 00; : : : ; f .n1/ are continuous and piecewise

Solve the initial value problem
x00  x0  6x D 0I
x.0/ D 2;

Solution
With the given initial values, Eqs. (4) and (5) yield

and
ˇfx00.t/g D s2ˇfx.t/g  sx.0/  x0.0/ D s2X.s/  2s C 1;
where (according to our convention about notation) X.s/ denotes the Laplace transform of
the (unknown) function x.t/. Hence the transformed equation is

which we quickly simplify to

Thus
X.s/ D
2s  3
s2  s  6 D

By the method of partial fractions (of integral calculus), there exist constants A and B such
that
2s  3
.s  3/.s C 2/ D
A
s  3 C
B
s C 2;
and multiplication of both sides of this equation by .s  3/.s C 2/ yields the identity
2s  3 D A.s C 2/ C B.s  3/:
If we substitute s D 3, we ﬁnd that A D 3

is the solution of the original initial value problem. Note that we did not ﬁrst ﬁnd the general
solution of the differential equation. The Laplace transform method directly yields the desired
particular solution, automatically taking into account—via Theorem 1 and its corollary—the
given initial conditions.
Remark In Example 1 we found the values of the partial-fraction coefﬁcients A and B by
the “trick” of separately substituting the roots s D 3 and s D 2 of the original denominator
s2  s  6 D .s  3/.s C 2/ into the equation

that resulted from clearing fractions. In lieu of any such shortcut, the “sure-ﬁre” method is to
collect coefﬁcients of powers of s on the right-hand side,
2s  3 D .A C B/s C .2A  3/:
Then upon equating coefﬁcients of terms of like degree, we get the linear equations

Such a problem arises in the motion of a mass-and-spring system with external force, as

Solution
Because both initial values are zero, Eq. (5) yields ˇfx00.t/g D s2X.s/. We read the transform
of sin 3t from the table in Fig. 7.1.2 (Section 7.1) and thereby get the transformed equation

The method of partial fractions calls for

The sure-ﬁre approach would be to clear fractions by multiplying both sides by the common
denominator, and then collect coefﬁcients of powers of s on the right-hand side. Equating
coefﬁcients of like powers on the two sides of the resulting equation would then yield four
linear equations that we could solve for A, B, C, and D.
However, here we can anticipate that A D C D 0, because neither the numerator nor
the denominator on the left involves any odd powers of s, whereas nonzero values for A or
C would lead to odd-degree terms on the right. So we replace A and C with zero before
clearing fractions. The result is the identity
3 D B.s2 C 9/ C D.s2 C 4/ D .B C D/s2 C .9B C 4D/:
When we equate coefﬁcients of like powers of s we get the linear equations

Linear Systems
Laplace transforms are used frequently in engineering problems to solve linear sys-
tems in which the coefﬁcients are all constants. When initial conditions are speci-
ﬁed, the Laplace transform reduces such a linear system of differential equations to
a linear system of algebraic equations in which the unknowns are the transforms of
the solution functions. As Example 3 illustrates, the technique for a system is essen-
tially the same as for a single linear differential equation with constant coefﬁcients.

ˇfx00.t/g D s2X.s/

The partial fraction decompositions in Eqs. (11a) and (11b) are readily found using the

we can write
120
.s2 C 1/.s2 C 4/.s2 C 9/ D
A
s2 C 1 C
B
s2 C 4 C

s2 C 9;
and it follows that
120 D A.s2 C 4/.s2 C 9/ C B.s2 C 1/.s2 C 9/ C C.s2 C 1/.s2 C 4/:
(12)
Substitution of s2 D 1 (that is, s D i, a zero of the factor s2 C 1) in Eq. (12) gives 120 D
A  3  8, so A D 5. Similarly, substitution of s2 D 4 in Eq. (12) yields B D 8, and
substitution of s2 D 9 yields C D 3. Thus we obtain the partial fraction decomposition
shown in Eq. (11a).
At any rate, the inverse Laplace transforms of the expressions in Eqs. (11a) and (11b)
give the solution

these two terms are the transforms

of the steady periodic solution and the transient solution, respectively. The only po-
tential difﬁculty in ﬁnding these solutions is in ﬁnding the inverse Laplace transform
of the right-hand side in Eq. (14). Much of the remainder of this chapter is devoted
to ﬁnding Laplace transforms and inverse transforms. In particular, we seek those
methods that are sufﬁciently powerful to enable us to solve problems that—unlike
those in Examples 1 and 2—cannot be solved readily by the methods of Chapter 3.

ˇfeat C ateatg D ˇff 0.t/g D sˇff .t/g D sˇfteatg:
It follows from the linearity of the transform that

Example 5
Find ˇft sin ktg.
Solution
Let f .t/ D t sin kt. Then f .0/ D 0 and
f 0.t/ D sin kt C kt cos kt:
The derivative involves the new function t cos kt, so we note that f 0.0/ D 0 and differentiate
again. The result is
f 00.t/ D 2k cos kt  k2t sin kt:
But ˇff 00.t/g D s2ˇff .t/g by the formula in (5) for the transform of the second derivative,
and ˇfcos ktg D s=.s2 C k2/, so we have

Chapter 7 Laplace Transform Methods
Examples 4 and 5 exploit the fact that if f .0/ D 0, then differentiation of f
corresponds to multiplication of its transform by s. It is reasonable to expect the
inverse operation of integration (antidifferentiation) to correspond to division of the
transform by s.

This technique is often a more convenient way than the method of partial fractions for ﬁnding
an inverse transform of a fraction of the form P.s/=ŒsnQ.s/.
Proof of Theorem 1:
We conclude this section with the proof of Theorem 1
in the general case in which f 0 is merely piecewise continuous. We need to prove
that the limit

Z b

exists and also need to ﬁnd its value. With b ﬁxed, let t1; t2; : : : ; tk1 be the points
interior to the interval Œ0; b at which f 0 is discontinuous. Let t0 D 0 and tk D b.
Then we can integrate by parts on each interval .tn1; tn/ where f 0 is continuous.
This yields

reduces to

equation, we get the desired result
ˇff 0.t/g D sˇff .t/g  f .0/:
Extension of Theorem 1
Now suppose that the function f is only piecewise continuous (instead of continu-
ous), and let t1; t2; t3; : : : be the points (for t > 0) where either f or f 0 is discontin-
uous. The fact that f is piecewise continuous includes the assumption that—within
each interval Œtn1; tn between successive points of discontinuity—f agrees with a
function that is continuous on the whole closed interval and has “endpoint values”

that may not agree with the actual values f .tn1/ and f .tn/. The value of an in-
tegral on an interval is not affected by changing the values of the integrand at the
endpoints. However, if the fundamental theorem of calculus is applied to ﬁnd the
value of the integral, then the antiderivative function must be continuous on the
closed interval. We therefore use the “continuous from within the interval” end-
point values above in evaluating (by parts) the integrals on the right in (19). The

Chapter 7 Laplace Transform Methods
7.2 Application Transforms of Initial Value Problems
The typical computer algebra system knows Theorem 1 and its corollary, hence can
transform not only functions (as in the Section 7.1 project), but also entire initial
value problems. We illustrate the technique here with Mathematica and in the Sec-
tion 7.3 project with Maple. Consider the initial value problem
x00 C 4x D sin 3t;
x.0/ D x0.0/ D 0
of Example 2. First we deﬁne the differential equation with its initial conditions,
then load the Laplace transform package.
de = x''[t] + 4x[t] == Sin[3t]
inits = {x[0] > 0, x'[0] > 0}
The Laplace transform of the differential equation is given by
DE = LaplaceTransform[ de, t, s ]
The result of this command—which we do not show explicitly here—is a linear
(algebraic) equation in the as yet unknown LaplaceTransform[x[t],t,s]. We
proceed to solve for this transform X.s/ of the unknown function x.t/ and substitute
the initial conditions.
X = Solve[DE, LaplaceTransform[x[t],t,s]]
X = X // Last // Last // Last
X = X /.

.s2 C 4/.s2 C 9/
Finally we need only compute an inverse transform to ﬁnd x.t/.

Of course we could probably get this result immediately with DSolve, but the in-
termediate output generated by the steps shown here can be quite instructive. You
can try it for yourself with the initial value problems in Problems 1 through 16.
7.3 Translation and Partial Fractions
As illustrated by Examples 1 and 2 of Section 7.2, the solution of a linear differential
equation with constant coefﬁcients can often be reduced to the matter of ﬁnding the
inverse Laplace transform of a rational function of the form
R.s/ D P.s/
Q.s/
(1)
where the degree of P.s/ is less than that of Q.s/.
The technique for ﬁnding
ˇ1fR.s/g is based on the same method of partial fractions that we use in ele-
mentary calculus to integrate rational functions. The following two rules describe

7.3 Translation and Partial Fractions
459
the partial fraction decomposition of R.s/, in terms of the factorization of the de-
nominator Q.s/ into linear factors and irreducible quadratic factors corresponding
to the real and complex zeros, respectively, of Q.s/.
RULE 1
Linear Factor Partial Fractions
The portion of the partial fraction decomposition of R.s/ corresponding to the
linear factor s  a of multiplicity n is a sum of n partial fractions, having the
form
A1
s  a C
A2
.s  a/2 C    C
An
.s  a/n ;
(2)
where A1; A2; : : : ; and An are constants.
RULE 2
Quadratic Factor Partial Fractions
The portion of the partial fraction decomposition corresponding to the irreducible
quadratic factor .s  a/2 C b2 of multiplicity n is a sum of n partial fractions,
having the form
A1s C B1
.s  a/2 C b2 C
A2s C B2
Œ.s  a/2 C b22 C    C
Ans C Bn
Œ.s  a/2 C b2n ;
(3)
where A1; A2; : : : ; An; B1; B2; : : : ; and Bn are constants.
Finding ˇ1fR.s/g involves two steps. First we must ﬁnd the partial fraction
decomposition of R.s/, and then we must ﬁnd the inverse Laplace transform of each
of the individual partial fractions of the types that appear in (2) and (3). The latter
step is based on the following elementary property of Laplace transforms.
THEOREM 1
Translation on the s-Axis
If F.s/ D ˇff .t/g exists for s > c, then ˇfeatf .t/g exists for s > a C c, and
ˇfeatf .t/g D F.s  a/:
(4)
Equivalently,
ˇ1fF.s  a/g D eatf .t/:
(5)
Thus the translation s ! s  a in the transform corresponds to multiplication of
the original function of t by eat.
Proof:
If we simply replace s with s  a in the deﬁnition of F.s/ D ˇff .t/g,
we obtain

Z 1

e.sa/tf .t/ dt D

This is Eq. (4), and it is clear that Eq. (5) is the same.
If we apply the translation theorem to the formulas for the Laplace transforms
of tn, cos kt, and sin kt that we already know—multiplying each of these functions

Consider a mass-and-spring system with m D 1

As usual, let x.t/ denote the displacement of the mass m from its equilibrium position. If the
mass is set in motion with x.0/ D 3 and x0.0/ D 1, ﬁnd x.t/ for the resulting damped free
oscillations.

Examples 4, 5, and 6 illustrate techniques for dealing with quadratic factors in
partial fraction decompositions.
Example 4
Consider the mass–spring–dashpot system as in Example 1, but with initial conditions x.0/ D
x0.0/ D 0 and with the imposed external force F.t/ D 15 sin 2t. Find the resulting transient
motion and steady periodic motion of the mass.
Solution
The initial value problem we need to solve is
x00 C 6x0 C 34x D 30 sin 2tI
x.0/ D x0.0/ D 0:
The transformed equation is

When we multiply both sides by the common denominator, we get
60 D .As C B/Œ.s C 3/2 C 25 C .Cs C D/.s2 C 4/:
(15)
To ﬁnd A and B, we substitute the zero s D 2i of the quadratic factor s2 C4 in Eq. (15);
the result is
60 D .2iA C B/Œ.2i C 3/2 C 25;
which we simplify to
60 D .24A C 30B/ C .60A C 12B/i:
We now equate real parts and imaginary parts on each side of this equation to obtain the two
linear equations
24A C 30B D 60
and
60A C 12B D 0;
which are readily solved for A D  10
29 and B D 50
29.
To ﬁnd C and D, we substitute the zero s D 3C5i of the quadratic factor .s C3/2 C25
in Eq. (15) and get
60 D ŒC.3 C 5i/ C DŒ.3 C 5i/2 C 4;
which we simplify to
60 D .186C  12D/ C .30C  30D/i:
Again we equate real parts and imaginary parts; this yields the two linear equations
186C  12D D 60
and
30C  30D D 0;
and we readily ﬁnd their solution to be C D D D 10
29.
With these values of the coefﬁcients A, B, C, and D, our partial fractions decomposi-

The terms of circular frequency 2 constitute the steady periodic forced oscillation of the
mass, whereas the exponentially damped terms of circular frequency 5 constitute its transient
motion, which disappears very rapidly (see Fig. 7.3.3). Note that the transient motion is
nonzero even though both initial conditions are zero.

Resonance and Repeated Quadratic Factors
The following two inverse Laplace transforms are useful in inverting partial frac-
tions that correspond to the case of repeated quadratic factors:

2k3 .sin kt  kt cos kt/:
(17)
These follow from Example 5 and Problem 31 of Section 7.2, respectively. Because
of the presence in Eqs. (16) and (17) of the terms t sin kt and t cos kt, a repeated
quadratic factor ordinarily signals the phenomenon of resonance in an undamped
mechanical or electrical system.
Example 5
Use Laplace transforms to solve the initial value problem

so

Upon substituting s D 1 we ﬁnd that A D 1.
Equation (20) is an identity that holds for all values of s. To ﬁnd the values of the
remaining coefﬁcients, we substitute in succession the values s D 0, s D 1, s D 2, s D 2,
and s D 3 in Eq. (20). This yields the system

Problems 39 and 40 illustrate two types of resonance in a
mass–spring–dashpot system with given external force F.t/
and with the initial conditions x.0/ D x0.0/ D 0.
39. Suppose that m D 1, k D 9, c D 0, and F.t/ D 6 cos 3t.
Use the inverse transform given in Eq. (16) to derive the
solution x.t/ D t sin 3t. Construct a ﬁgure that illustrates
the resonance that occurs.
40. Suppose that m D 1, k D 9:04, c D 0:4, and F.t/ D
6et=5 cos 3t. Derive the solution
x.t/ D tet=5 sin 3t:
Show that the maximum value of the amplitude function
A.t/ D tet=5 is A.5/ D 5=e.
Thus (as indicated in
Fig. 7.3.5) the oscillations of the mass increase in am-
plitude during the ﬁrst 5 s before being damped out as
t ! C1.

system

x.0/ D x0.0/ D 0
(1)
with parameter values
m := 25;
c := 10;
k := 226;
in response to a variety of possible external forces:
1. F.t/  226
This should give damped oscillations “leveling off” to a constant solution (why?).
2. F.t/ D 901 cos 3t
With this periodic external force you should see a steady periodic oscillation with
an exponentially damped transient motion (as illustrated in Fig. 3.6.13).

466
Chapter 7 Laplace Transform Methods
3. F.t/ D 900et=5 cos 3t
Now the periodic external force is exponentially damped, and the transform X.s/
includes a repeated quadratic factor that signals the presence of a resonance phe-
nomenon. The response x.t/ is a constant multiple of that shown in Fig. 7.3.5.
4. F.t/ D 900tet=5 cos 3t
We have inserted the factor t to make it a bit more interesting. The solution in this
case is illustrated below.
5. F.t/ D 162t3et=5 cos 3t
In this case you’ll ﬁnd that the transform X.s/ involves the ﬁfth power of a quadratic
factor, and its inverse transform by manual methods would be impossibly tedious.
To illustrate the Maple approach, we ﬁrst set up the differential equation cor-
responding to Case 4.
F := 900texp(--t/5)cos(3t);
de := mdiff(x(t),t$2) + cdiff(x(t),t) + kx(t) = F;
Then we apply the Laplace transform and substitute the initial conditions.
with(inttrans):
DE := laplace(de, t, s):
X(s) := solve(DE, laplace(x(t), t, s)):
X(s) := simplify(subs(x(0)=0, D(x)(0)=0, X(s)));
At this point the command factor(denom(X(s))) shows that
X.s/ D 22500.25s2 C 10s  224/
.25s2 C 10s C 226/3
:
The cubed quadratic factor would be difﬁcult to handle manually, but the command
x(t) := invlaplace(X(s), s, t);
soon yields
x.t/ D et=5 
t cos 3t C

3t2  1

:
The amplitude function for these damped oscillations is deﬁned by
C(t) := exp(--t/5)sqrt(t^2 + (3t^2 -- 1/3)^2);
and ﬁnally the command
plot({x(t), C(t), --C(t)}, t=0..40);
produces the plot shown in Fig. 7.3.6. The resonance resulting from the repeated

For a similar solution in one of the other cases listed previously, you need only
enter the appropriate force F in the initial command above and then re-execute the
subsequent commands. To see the advantage of using Laplace transforms, set up
the differential equation de for Case 5 and examine the result of the command
dsolve({de, x(0)=0, D(x)(0)=0}, x(t));
Of course you can substitute your own favorite mass–spring–dashpot parameters for
those used here. But it will simplify the calculations if you choose m, c, and k so

where p, a, and b are integers. One way is to select the latter integers ﬁrst, then use
Eq. (2) to determine m, c, and k.
7.4 Derivatives, Integrals, and Products of Transforms
The Laplace transform of the (initially unknown) solution of a differential equation
is sometimes recognizable as the product of the transforms of two known functions.
For example, when we transform the initial value problem
x00 C x D cos tI
x.0/ D x0.0/ D 0;
we get
X.s/ D
s
.s2 C 1/2 D
s
s2 C 1 

s2 C 1 D ˇfcos tg  ˇfsin tg:
This strongly suggests that there ought to be a way of combining the two functions
sin t and cos t to obtain a function x.t/ whose transform is the product of their
transforms. But obviously x.t/ is not simply the product of cos t and sin t, because

has the desired property that
ˇfh.t/g D H.s/ D F.s/  G.s/:

The new function of t deﬁned as the integral in (1) depends only on f and g and is
called the convolution of f and g. It is denoted by f  g, the idea being that it is a
new type of product of f and g, so tailored that its transform is the product of the
transforms of f and g.

We will also write f .t/  g.t/ when convenient. In terms of the convolution
product, Theorem 1 of this section says that
ˇff  gg D ˇff g  ˇfgg:

THEOREM 1
The Convolution Property
Suppose that f .t/ and g.t/ are piecewise continuous for t = 0 and that jf .t/j
and jg.t/j are bounded by Mect as t ! C1. Then the Laplace transform of the
convolution f .t/  g.t/ exists for s > c; moreover,

According to Theorem 1 of Section 7.2, if f .0/ D 0 then differentiation of f .t/
corresponds to multiplication of its transform by s. Theorem 2, proved at the end

multiplication of the original function f .t/ by t.

Equation (8) can be applied to transform a linear differential equation having
polynomial, rather than constant, coefﬁcients. The result will be a differential equa-
tion involving the transform; whether this procedure leads to success depends, of
course, on whether we can solve the new equation more readily than the old one.

such that x.0/ D 1 and x0.0/ D 0. This solution of Bessel’s equation is customarily denoted
by J0.t/. Because

Integration of Transforms
Differentiation of F.s/ corresponds to multiplication of f .t/ by t (together with
a change of sign). It is therefore natural to expect that integration of F.s/ will
correspond to division of f .t/ by t. Theorem 3, proved at the end of this section,
conﬁrms this, provided that the resulting quotient f .t/=t remains well behaved as
t ! 0 from the right; that is, provided that
lim

7.5 Periodic and Piecewise Continuous Input Functions
Mathematical models of mechanical or electrical systems often involve functions
with discontinuities corresponding to external forces that are turned abruptly on or
off. One such simple on–off function is the unit step function that we introduced in
Section 7.1. Recall that the unit step function at t D a is deﬁned by
ua.t/ D u.t  a/ D
(
0
if t < a,
1
if t = a.
(1)
The notation ua.t/ indicates succinctly where the unit upward step in value takes
place (Fig. 7.5.1), whereas u.t  a/ connotes the sometimes useful idea of a “time
x = ua(t)

delay” a before the step is made.
In Example 8 of Section 7.1 we saw that if a = 0, then
ˇfu.t  a/g D eas
s
:
(2)
Because ˇfu.t/g D 1=s, Eq. (2) implies that multiplication of the transform of u.t/
by eas corresponds to the translation t ! t a in the original independent variable.
Theorem 1 tells us that this fact, when properly interpreted, is a general property of
the Laplace transformation.
THEOREM 1
Translation on the t-Axis
If ˇff .t/g exists for s > c, then
ˇfu.t  a/f .t  a/g D easF.s/
(3a)
and
ˇ1feasF.s/g D u.t  a/f .t  a/

for s > c C a.

475
Note that
u.t  a/f .t  a/ D
(
0
if t < a,
f .t  a/
if t = a.
(4)
Thus Theorem 1 implies that ˇ1feasF.s/g is the function whose graph for t = a
is the translation by a units to the right of the graph of f .t/ for t = 0. Note that the
part (if any) of the graph of f .t/ to the left of t D 0 is “cut off” and is not translated
(Fig. 7.5.2). In some applications the function f .t/ describes an incoming signal
that starts arriving at time t D 0. Then u.t  a/f .t  a/ denotes a signal of the same
“shape” but with a time delay of a, so it does not start arriving until time t D a.

function f .t/ whose translation 3 units to the right agrees (for t = 3) with g.t/ D t2 is

Example 4
A mass that weighs 32 lb (mass m D 1 slug) is attached to the free end of a long, light spring
that is stretched 1 ft by a force of 4 lb (k D 4 lb=ft). The mass is initially at rest in its
equilibrium position. Beginning at time t D 0 (seconds), an external force f .t/ D cos 2t is
applied to the mass, but at time t D 2 this force is turned off (abruptly discontinued) and the
mass is allowed to continue its motion unimpeded. Find the resulting position function x.t/
of the mass.
Solution
We need to solve the initial value problem
x00 C 4x D f .t/I

where f .t/ is the function of Example 3. The transformed equation is

Thereafter, the mass continues to oscillate with the same frequency but with constant ampli-
tude =2. The force F.t/ D cos 2t would produce pure resonance if continued indeﬁnitely,
but we see that its effect ceases immediately at the moment it is turned off.
If we were to attack Example 4 with the methods of Chapter 3, we would
need to solve one problem for the interval 0 5 t < 2 and then solve a new problem
with different initial conditions for the interval t = 2. In such a situation the
Laplace transform method enjoys the distinct advantage of not requiring the solution
of different problems on different intervals.
Example 5
Consider the RLC circuit shown in Fig. 7.5.7, with R D 110 , L D 1 H, C D 0:001 F, and a
battery supplying E0 D 90 V. Initially there is no current in the circuit and no charge on the
capacitor. At time t D 0 the switch is closed and left closed for 1 second. At time t D 1 it is
opened and left open thereafter. Find the resulting current in the circuit.
Solution
We recall from Section 3.7 the basic series circuit equation

(6)
where e.t/ D 90Œ1  u.t  1/, corresponding to the opening and closing of the switch.
In Section 3.7 our strategy was to differentiate both sides of Eq. (5), then apply the
relation
i D dq

(7)
to obtain the second-order equation
Ld 2i

Here we do not use that method, because e0.t/ D 0 except at t D 1, whereas the jump from
e.t/ D 90 when t < 1 to e.t/ D 0 when t > 1 would seem to require that e0.1/ D 1. Thus
e0.t/ appears to have an inﬁnite discontinuity at t D 1. This phenomenon will be discussed in
Section 7.6. For now, we will simply note that it is an odd situation and circumvent it rather
than attempt to deal with it here.
To avoid the possible problem at t D 1, we observe that the initial value q.0/ D 0 and
Eq. (7) yield, upon integration,

This is the integrodifferential equation of a series RLC circuit; it involves both the integral

Transforms of Periodic Functions
Periodic forcing functions in practical mechanical or electrical systems often are
more complicated than pure sines or cosines. The nonconstant function f .t/ deﬁned
for t = 0 is said to be periodic if there is a number p > 0 such that
f .t C p/ D f .t/
(11)
for all t = 0. The least positive value of p (if any) for which Eq. (11) holds is called
the period of f . Such a function is shown in Fig. 7.5.8. Theorem 2 simpliﬁes the
computation of the Laplace transform of a periodic function.

improper integral.

Chapter 7 Laplace Transform Methods
7.5 Application Engineering Functions
Periodic piecewise linear functions occur so frequently as input functions in engi-
neering applications that they are sometimes called engineering functions. Com-
putations with such functions are readily handled by computer algebra systems.
In Mathematica, for instance, the SawToothWave, TriangleWave, and Square-
Wave functions can be used to create the corresponding inputs with speciﬁed range,
period, etc. Alternatively, we can deﬁne our own engineering functions using ele-
mentary functions available in any computer algebra system:
sawtooth[t ] := t -- 2 Floor[t/2] -- 1
triangularwave[t ] := 2 Abs[sawtooth[t -- 1/2]] -- 1
squarewave[t ] := Sign[ triangularwave[t]]
Plot each of the functions to verify that it has period 2 and that its name is aptly
chosen. For instance, the result of
Plot[squarewave[t], {t, 0, 6}]
should look like Fig. 7.5.9. If f .t/ is one of these engineering functions and p > 0,
then the function f .2t=p/ will have period p. To illustrate this, try
Plot[triangularwave[ 2 t=p ], {t, 0, 3 p}]
with various values of p.
Now let’s consider the mass-spring-dashpot equation
diffEq = m x''[t] + c x'[t] + k x[t] == input
with selected parameter values and an input forcing function with period p and
amplitude F0.
m = 4; c = 8; k = 5; p = 1; F0 = 4;
input = F0 squarewave[2 t=p];
You can plot this input function to verify that it has period 1:
Plot[input, {t, 0, 2}]
Finally, let’s suppose that the mass is initially at rest in its equilibrium position and
solve numerically the resulting initial value problem.
response = NDSolve[ {diffEq, x[0] == 0, x'[0] == 0},
x, {t, 0, 10}]
Plot[ x[t] =.
response, {t, 0, 10}]
In the resulting Fig. 7.5.18 we see that after an initial transient dies out, the
response function x.t/ settles down (as expected?) to a periodic oscillation with the
same period as the input.

7.6 Impulses and Delta Functions
Consider a force f .t/ that acts only during a very short time interval a 5 t 5 b,
with f .t/ D 0 outside this interval. A typical example would be the impulsive
force of a bat striking a ball—the impact is almost instantaneous. A quick surge
of voltage (resulting from a lightning bolt, for instance) is an analogous electrical

phenomenon. In such a situation it often happens that the principal effect of the
force depends only on the value of the integral
p D
Z b
a
f .t/ dt
(1)
and does not depend otherwise on precisely how f .t/ varies with time t. The num-
ber p in Eq. (1) is called the impulse of the force f .t/ over the interval Œa; b.
In the case of a force f .t/ that acts on a particle of mass m in linear motion,
integration of Newton’s law
f .t/ D mv0.t/ D d
dt Œmv.t/
yields
p D
Z b
a
d
dt Œmv.t/ dt D mv.b/  mv.a/:
(2)
Thus the impulse of the force is equal to the change in momentum of the particle.
So if change in momentum is the only effect with which we are concerned, we need
know only the impulse of the force; we need know neither the precise function f .t/
nor even the precise time interval during which it acts. This is fortunate, because
in a situation such as that of a batted ball, we are unlikely to have such detailed
information about the impulsive force that acts on the ball.
Our strategy for handling such a situation is to set up a reasonable mathemat-
ical model in which the unknown force f .t/ is replaced with a simple and explicit
force that has the same impulse. Suppose for simplicity that f .t/ has impulse 1 and
acts during some brief time interval beginning at time t D a = 0. Then we can select
a ﬁxed number 
 > 0 that approximates the length of this time interval and replace
f .t/ with the speciﬁc function

This is a function of t, with a and

(4)
Because the precise time interval during which the force acts seems unimpor-
tant, it is tempting to think of an instantaneous impulse that occurs precisely at the
instant t D a. We might try to model such an instantaneous unit impulse by taking
the limit as 
 ! 0, thereby deﬁning
ıa.t/ D lim

where a = 0. If we could also take the limit under the integral sign in Eq. (4), then
it would follow that

(6)
But the limit in Eq. (5) gives

(7)
Obviously, no actual function can satisfy both (6) and (7)—if a function is zero
except at a single point, then its integral is not 1 but zero. Nevertheless, the symbol
ıa.t/ is very useful. However interpreted, it is called the Dirac delta function at a
after the British theoretical physicist P. A. M. Dirac (1902–1984), who in the early
1930s introduced a “function” allegedly enjoying the properties in Eqs. (6) and (7).
Delta Functions as Operators
The following computation motivates the meaning that we will attach here to the
symbol ıa.t/. If g.t/ is a continuous function, then the mean value theorem for
integrals implies that
Z aC

by continuity of g at t D a. If ıa.t/ were a function in the strict sense of the
deﬁnition, and if we could interchange the limit and the integral in Eq. (8), we
therefore could conclude that
Z 1
0
g.t/ıa.t/ dt D g.a/:
(9)
We take Eq. (9) as the deﬁnition (!) of the symbol ıa.t/. Although we call it
the delta function, it is not a genuine function; instead, it speciﬁes the operation
Z 1
0
   ıa.t/ dt;
which—when applied to a continuous function g.t/—sifts out or selects the value
g.a/ of this function at the point a = 0.
This idea is shown schematically in
Fig. 7.6.2. Note that we will use the symbol ıa.t/ only in the context of integrals
such as that in Eq. (9), or when it will appear subsequently in such an integral.

We therefore deﬁne the Laplace transform of the delta function to be

7.6 Impulses and Delta Functions

If we write
ı.t/ D ı0.t/
and
ı.t  a/ D ıa.t/;
(12)
then (11) with a D 0 gives
ˇfı.t/g D 1:
(13)
Note that if ı.t/ were an actual function satisfying the usual conditions for existence
of its Laplace transform, then Eq. (13) would contradict the corollary to Theorem 2
of Section 7.1. But there is no problem here; ı.t/ is not a function, and Eq. (13) is
our deﬁnition of ˇfı.t/g.
Delta Function Inputs
Now, ﬁnally, suppose that we are given a mechanical system whose response x.t/
to the external force f .t/ is determined by the differential equation
Ax00 C Bx0 C Cx D f .t/:
(14)
To investigate the response of this system to a unit impulse at the instant t D a, it
seems reasonable to replace f .t/ with ıa.t/ and begin with the equation
Ax00 C Bx0 C Cx D ıa.t/:
(15)
But what is meant by the solution of such an equation? We will call x.t/ a solution
of Eq. (15) provided that
x.t/ D lim
	!0 x	.t/;
(16)
where x	.t/ is a solution of
Ax00 C Bx0 C Cx D da;	.t/:
(17)
Because
da;	.t/ D 1

 Œua.t/  uaC	.t/

is an ordinary function, Eq. (17) makes sense. For simplicity suppose the initial
conditions to be x.0/ D x0.0/ D 0. When we transform Eq. (17), writing X	 D ˇfx	g,
we get the equation

by l’Hˆopital’s rule, we get the equation

Note that this is precisely the same result that we would obtain if we transformed
Eq. (15) directly, using the fact that ˇfıa.t/g D eas.

Chapter 7 Laplace Transform Methods
On this basis it is reasonable to solve a differential equation involving a delta
function by employing the Laplace transform method exactly as if ıa.t/ were an
ordinary function. It is important to verify that the solution so obtained agrees
with the one deﬁned in Eq. (16), but this depends on a highly technical analysis of
the limiting procedures involved; we consider it beyond the scope of the present
discussion. The formal method is valid in all the examples of this section and will
produce correct results in the subsequent problem set.
Example 1
A mass m D 1 is attached to a spring with constant k D 4; there is no dashpot. The mass is
released from rest with x.0/ D 3. At the instant t D 2 the mass is struck with a hammer,
providing an impulse p D 8. Determine the motion of the mass.
Solution
According to Problem 15, we need to solve the initial value problem
x00 C 4x D 8ı2.t/I
x.0/ D 3;
x0.0/ D 0:
We apply the Laplace transform to get
s2X.s/  3s C 4X.s/ D 8e2s;
so
X.s/ D
3s
s2 C 4 C 8e2s
s2 C 4 :
Recalling the transforms of sine and cosine, as well as the theorem on translations on the
t-axis (Theorem 1 of Section 7.5), we see that the inverse transform is
x.t/ D 3 cos 2t C 4u.t  2/ sin 2.t  2/
D 3 cos 2t C 4u2.t/ sin 2t:
Because 3 cos 2t C 4 sin 2t D 5 cos.2t  ˛/ with ˛ D tan1.4=3/  0:9273, separation of the
cases t < 2 and t = 2 gives

(
3 cos 2t
if t 5 2,
5 cos.2t  0:9273/
if t = 2.
The resulting motion is shown in Fig. 7.6.3. Note that the impulse at t D 2 results in a
visible discontinuity in the velocity at t D 2, as it instantaneously increases the amplitude
of the oscillations of the mass from 3 to 5.

Delta Functions and Step Functions
It is useful to regard the delta function ıa.t/ as the derivative of the unit step function

Because
ua.t/ D lim

an interchange of limits and derivatives yields

and therefore
d

(20)
We may regard this as the formal deﬁnition of the derivative of the unit step function,
although ua.t/ is not differentiable in the ordinary sense at t D a.
Example 2
We return to the RLC circuit of Example 5 of Section 7.5, with R D 110 , L D 1 H,
C D 0:001 F, and a battery supplying e0 D 90 V. Suppose that the circuit is initially passive—
no current and no charge. At time t D 0 the switch is closed, and at time t D 1 it is opened
and left open. Find the resulting current i.t/ in the circuit.
Solution
In Section 7.5 we circumvented the discontinuity in the voltage by employing the integrodif-
ferential form of the circuit equation. Now that delta functions are available, we may begin
with the ordinary circuit equation
Li00 C Ri0 C 1
C i D e0.t/:
In this example we have
e.t/ D 90  90u.t  1/ D 90  90u1.t/;
so e0.t/ D 90ı.t  1/ by Eq. (20). Hence we want to solve the initial value problem
i00 C 110i0 C 1000i D 90ı.t  1/I
i.0/ D 0;
i0.0/ D 90:
(21)
The fact that i0.0/ D 90 comes from substitution of t D 0 in the equation
Li0.t/ C Ri.t/ C 1
C q.t/ D e.t/
with the numerical values i.0/ D q.0/ D 0 and e.0/ D 90.
When we transform the problem in (21), we get the equation
s2I.s/  90 C 110sI.s/ C 1000I.s/ D 90es:
Hence
I.s/ D
90.1  es/
s2 C 110s C 1000:
This is precisely the same transform I.s/ we found in Example 5 of Section 7.5, so inversion
of I.s/ yields the same solution i.t/ recorded there.

if n is odd:
Hence x.t/ is the half-wave rectiﬁcation of sin t shown in Fig. 7.6.5. The physical explanation
is that the ﬁrst hammer blow (at time t D 0) starts the mass moving to the right; just as it
returns to the origin, the second hammer blow stops it dead; it remains motionless until the
third hammer blow starts it moving again; and so on. Of course, if the hammer blows are not
perfectly synchronized, then the motion of the mass will be quite different.

Systems Analysis and Duhamel’s Principle
Consider a physical system in which the output or response x.t/ to the input func-
tion f .t/ is described by the differential equation
ax00 C bx0 C cx D f .t/;
(22)
where the constant coefﬁcients a, b, and c are determined by the physical parameters
of the system and are independent of f .t/. The mass-spring-dashpot system and the
series RLC circuit are familiar examples of this general situation.
For simplicity we assume that the system is initially passive: x.0/ D x0.0/ D 0.
Then the transform of Eq. (22) is
as2X.s/ C bsX.s/ C cX.s/ D F.s/;
so
X.s/ D
F.s/
as2 C bs C c D W.s/F.s/:
(23)
The function
W.s/ D
1
as2 C bs C c
(24)
is called the transfer function of the system. Thus the transform of the response to
the input f .t/ is the product of W.s/ and the transform F.s/.
The function
w.t/ D ˇ1fW.s/g
(25)
is called the weight function of the system. From Eq. (24) we see by convolution
that
x.t/ D
Z t
0
w./f .t  / d:
(26)

7.6 Impulses and Delta Functions
491
This formula is Duhamel’s principle for the system. What is important is that
the weight function w.t/ is determined completely by the parameters of the system.
Once w.t/ has been determined, the integral in (26) gives the response of the system
to an arbitrary input function f .t/.
In principle—that is, via the convolution integral—Duhamel’s principle re-
duces the problem of ﬁnding a system’s outputs for all possible inputs to calculation
of the single inverse Laplace transform in (25) that is needed to ﬁnd its weight func-
tion. Hence, a computational analogue for a physical mass–spring–dashpot system
described by (22) can be constructed in the form of a “black box” that is hard wired
to calculate automatically (and then tabulate or graph, for instance) the response
x.t/ given by (26) whenever a desired force function f .t/ is input. In engineer-
ing practice, all manner of physical systems are “modeled” in this manner, so their
behaviors can be studied without need for expensive or time-consuming experimen-
tation.
Example 4
Consider a mass–spring–dashpot system (initially passive) that responds to the external force
f .t/ in accord with the equation x00 C 6x0 C 10x D f .t/. Then
W.s/ D
1
s2 C 6s C 10 D

.s C 3/2 C 1;
so the weight function is w.t/ D e3t sin t. Then Duhamel’s principle implies that the re-
sponse x.t/ to the force f .t/ is
x.t/ D
Z t
0
e3.sin /f .t  / d:
Note that
W.s/ D
1
as2 C bs C c D
ˇfı.t/g
as2 C bs C c :
Consequently, it follows from Eq. (23) that the weight function is simply the re-
sponse of the system to the delta function input ı.t/. For this reason w.t/ is some-
times called the unit impulse response. A response that is usually easier to measure
in practice is the response h.t/ to the unit step function u.t/; h.t/ is the unit step
response. Because ˇfu.t/g D 1=s, we see from Eq. (23) that the transform of h.t/
is
H.s/ D W.s/
s
:
It follows from the formula for transforms of integrals that
h.t/ D
Z t
0
w./ d;
so that
w.t/ D h0.t/:
(27)
Thus the weight function, or unit impulse response, is the derivative of the unit step
response. Substitution of (27) in Duhamel’s principle gives
x.t/ D
Z t
0
h0.t/f .t  / d
(28)
for the response of the system to the input f .t/.

Chapter 7 Laplace Transform Methods
APPLICATIONS:
To describe a typical application of Eq. (28), suppose that we are
given a complex series circuit containing many inductors, resistors, and capacitors.
Assume that its circuit equation is a linear equation of the form in (22), but with
i in place of x. What if the coefﬁcients a, b, and c are unknown, perhaps only
because they are too difﬁcult to compute? We would still want to know the current
i.t/ corresponding to any input f .t/ D e0.t/. We connect the circuit to a linearly
increasing voltage e.t/ D t, so that f .t/ D e0.t/ D 1 D u.t/, and measure the response
h.t/ with an ammeter. We then compute the derivative h0.t/, either numerically or
graphically. Then according to Eq. (28), the output current i.t/ corresponding to the
input voltage e.t/ will be given by
i.t/ D
Z t

h0./e0.t  / d
(using the fact that f .t/ D e0.t/).
Historical Remark
In conclusion, we remark that around 1950, after engineers and physi-
cists had been using delta functions widely and fruitfully for about 20 years without rigorous
justiﬁcation, the French mathematician Laurent Schwartz developed a rigorous mathematical
theory of generalized functions that supplied the missing logical foundation for delta function
techniques. Every piecewise continuous ordinary function is a generalized function, but the
delta function is an example of a generalized function that is not an ordinary function.

8.1 Introduction and Review of Power Series
I
n Section 3.3 we saw that solving a homogeneous linear differential equation
with constant coefﬁcients can be reduced to the algebraic problem of ﬁnding the
roots of its characteristic equation. There is no similar procedure for solving linear
differential equations with variable coefﬁcients, at least not routinely and in ﬁnitely
many steps. With the exception of special types, such as the occasional equation that
can be solved by inspection, linear equations with variable coefﬁcients generally
require the power series techniques of this chapter.
These techniques sufﬁce for many of the nonelementary differential equations
that appear most frequently in applications. Perhaps the most important (because of
its applications in such areas as acoustics, heat ﬂow, and electromagnetic radiation)
is Bessel’s equation of order n:
x2y00 C xy0 C .x2  n2/y D 0:
Legendre’s equation of order n is important in many applications. It has the form
.1  x2/y00  2xy0 C n.n C 1/y D 0:
In this section we introduce the power series method in its simplest form and,
along the way, state (without proof) several theorems that constitute a review of the
basic facts about power series. Recall ﬁrst that a power series in (powers of) x  a
is an inﬁnite series of the form

We will conﬁne our review mainly to power series in x, but every general property
of power series in x can be converted to a general property of power series in x  a
by replacement of x with x  a.
The power series in (2) converges on the interval I provided that the limit

In compact summation notation, we observe the usual conventions that 0Š D 1 and
that x0 D 1 for all x, including x D 0. The series in (5) through (9) converge to
the indicated functions for all x. In contrast, the series in (10) and (11) converge if
jxj < 1 but diverge if jxj > 1. (What if jxj D 1?) The series in (11) is the geometric
series. The series in (12), with ˛ an arbitrary real number, is the binomial series.
If ˛ is a nonnegative integer n, then the series in (12) terminates and the binomial
series reduces to a polynomial of degree n which converges for all x. Otherwise,
the series is actually inﬁnite and it converges if jxj < 1 and diverges if jxj > 1; its
behavior for jxj D 1 depends on the value of ˛.

series. The Taylor series with center x D a of the function f is the power series

in powers of x  a, under the hypothesis that f is inﬁnitely differentiable at x D a (so that
the coefﬁcients in Eq. (13) are all deﬁned). If a D 0, then the series in (13) is the Maclaurin

For example, suppose that f .x/ D ex. Then f .n/.x/ D ex, and hence f .n/.0/ D 1 for all
n = 0. In this case Eq. (130) reduces to the exponential series in (5).
Power Series Operations
If the Taylor series of the function f converges to f .x/ for all x in some open
interval containing a, then we say that the function f is analytic at x D a. For
example,

every polynomial function is analytic everywhere;

every rational function is analytic wherever its denominator is nonzero;

more generally, if the two functions f and g are both analytic at x D a, then so
are their sum f Cg and their product f g, as is their quotient f=g if g.a/ 6D 0.
For instance, the function h.x/ D tan x D .sin x/=.cos x/ is analytic at x D 0
because cos 0 D 1 6D 0 and the sine and cosine functions are analytic (by virtue of
their convergent power series representations in Eqs. (6) and (7)). It is rather awk-
ward to compute the Taylor series of the tangent function using Eq. (13) because
of the way in which its successive derivatives grow in complexity (try it!). Fortu-
nately, power series may be manipulated algebraically in much the same way as
polynomials. For example, if
f .x/ D

8.1 Introduction and Review of Power Series

each term of the ﬁrst series by each term of the second and then collecting coef-
ﬁcients of like powers of x. (Thus the processes strongly resemble addition and
multiplication of ordinary polynomials.) The series in (15) and (16) converge to
f .x/ C g.x/ and f .x/g.x/, respectively, on any open interval on which both the
series in (14) converge. For example,

Similarly, the quotient of two power series can be computed by long division,
as illustrated by the computation shown in Fig. 8.1.1. This division of the Taylor
series for cos x into that for sin x yields the ﬁrst few terms of the series
tan x D x C 1

(17)
Division of power series is more treacherous than multiplication; the series thus
obtained for f=g may fail to converge at some points where the series for f and g
both converge. For example, the sine and cosine series converge for all x, but the
tangent series in (17) converges only if jxj < =2.
The Power Series Method
The power series method for solving a differential equation consists of substituting
the power series
y D
1
X
nD0
cnxn
(18)
in the differential equation and then attempting to determine what the coefﬁcients
c0, c1, c2, : : : must be in order that the power series will satisfy the differential
equation. This is reminiscent of the method of undetermined coefﬁcients, but now
we have inﬁnitely many coefﬁcients somehow to determine. This method is not
always successful, but when it is we obtain an inﬁnite series representation of a
solution, in contrast to the “closed form” solutions that our previous methods have
yielded.
Before we can substitute the power series in (18) in a differential equation, we
must ﬁrst know what to substitute for the derivatives y0, y00, : : : . The following the-
orem (stated without proof) tells us that the derivative y0 of y D P cnxn is obtained
by the simple procedure of writing the sum of the derivatives of the individual terms
in the series for y.

The process of determining the coefﬁcients in the series y D P cnxn so
that it will satisfy a given differential equation depends also on Theorem 2. This
theorem—also stated without proof—tells us that if two power series represent the
same function, then they are the same series. In particular, the Taylor series in (13)
is the only power series (in powers of x  a) that represents the function f .

If

for every point x in some open interval I, then an D bn for all n = 0.
In particular, if P anxn D 0 for all x in some open interval, it follows from
Theorem 2 that an D 0 for all n = 0.
Example 1
Solve the equation y0 C 2y D 0.

We substitute the series

To compare coefﬁcients here, we need the general term in each sum to be the term containing
xn. To accomplish this, we shift the index of summation in the ﬁrst sum. To see how to do
this, note that

nD1
ncnxn1 D c1 C 2c2x C 3c3x2 C    D

nD0
.n C 1/cnC1xn:
Thus we can replace n with n C 1 if, at the same time, we start counting one step lower; that
is, at n D 0 rather than at n D 1. This is a shift of C1 in the index of summation. The result
of making this shift in Eq. (21) is the identity

that is,

If this equation holds on some interval, then it follows from the identity principle that .n C
1/cnC1 C 2cn D 0 for all n = 0; consequently,
cnC1 D  2cn
n C 1
(22)
for all n = 0. Equation (22) is a recurrence relation from which we can successively compute
c1, c2, c3, : : : in terms of c0; the latter will turn out to be the arbitrary constant that we expect
to ﬁnd in a general solution of a ﬁrst-order differential equation.

With n D 0, Eq. (22) gives

Shift of Index of Summation
In the solution of Example 1 we wrote
1
X
nD1
ncnxn1 D
1
X
nD0
.n C 1/cnC1xn
(23)
by shifting the index of summation by C1 in the series on the left. That is, we
simultaneously increased the index of summation by 1 (replacing n with n C 1,
n ! n C 1) and decreased the starting point by 1, from n D 1 to n D 0, thereby
obtaining the series on the right. This procedure is valid because each inﬁnite series
in (23) is simply a compact notation for the single series
c1 C 2c2x C 3c3x2 C 4c4x3 C    :
(24)
More generally, we can shift the index of summation by k in an inﬁnite series
by simultaneously increasing the summation index by k (n ! nCk) and decreasing
the starting point by k. For instance, a shift by C2 (n ! n C 2) yields
1
X
nD3
anxn1 D

nD1
anC2xnC1:
If k is negative, we interpret a “decrease by k” as an increase by k D jkj. Thus a
shift by 2 (n ! n  2) in the index of summation yields
1
X
nD1
ncnxn1 D
1
X
nD3
.n  2/cn2xn3I
we have decreased the index of summation by 2 but increased the starting point by
2, from n D 1 to n D 3. You should check that the summation on the right is merely
another representation of the series in (24).

8.1 Introduction and Review of Power Series
501
We know that the power series obtained in Example 1 converges for all x
because it is an exponential series. More commonly, a power series solution is
not recognizable in terms of the familiar elementary functions. When we get an
unfamiliar power series solution, we need a way of ﬁnding where it converges.
After all, y D P cnxn is merely an assumed form of the solution. The procedure
illustrated in Example 1 for ﬁnding the coefﬁcients fcng is merely a formal process
and may or may not be valid. Its validity—in applying Theorem 1 to compute
y0 and applying Theorem 2 to obtain a recurrence relation for the coefﬁcients—
depends on the convergence of the initially unknown series y D P cnxn. Hence
this formal process is justiﬁed only if in the end we can show that the power series
we obtain converges on some open interval. If so, it then represents a solution of
the differential equation on that interval. The following theorem (which we state
without proof) may be used for this purpose.
THEOREM 3
Radius of Convergence
Given the power series P cnxn, suppose that the limit
 D lim
n!1
ˇˇˇˇ
cn
cnC1
ˇˇˇˇ
(25)
exists ( is ﬁnite) or is inﬁnite (in this case we will write  D 1). Then
(a) If  D 0, then the series diverges for all x 6D 0.
(b) If 0 <  < 1, then P cnxn converges if jxj <  and diverges if jxj > .
(c) If  D 1, then the series converges for all x.
The number  in (25) is called the radius of convergence of the power series
P cnxn. For instance, for the power series obtained in Example 1, we have
 D lim
n!1
ˇˇˇˇ
.1/n2nc0=nŠ
.1/nC12nC1c0=.n C 1/Š
ˇˇˇˇ D lim
n!1
n C 1
2
D 1;
and consequently the series we obtained in Example 1 converges for all x. Even
if the limit in (25) fails to exist, there always will be a number  such that exactly
one of the three alternatives in Theorem 3 holds. This number may be difﬁcult to
ﬁnd, but for the power series we will consider in this chapter, Eq. (25) will be quite
sufﬁcient for computing the radius of convergence.

Thus the series in (26) converges if 3 < x < 3 and diverges if jxj > 3. In this particular
example we can explain why. An elementary solution (obtained by separation of variables)
of our differential equation is y D 1=.3  x/2. If we differentiate termwise the geometric

on the interval 3 < x < 3, and the singularity at x D 3 is the reason why the radius of

Because of the presence of the two terms 1 and x on the right-hand side, we need to split
off the ﬁrst two terms, c0 C c1x, of the series on the right for comparison. If we also shift the

Because the left-hand side contains neither a constant term nor a term containing x to the ﬁrst
power, the identity principle now yields c0 D 1, c1 D 1, and cn D .n  1/cn1 for n = 2. It
follows that
c2 D 1  c1 D 1Š;
c3 D 2  c2 D 2Š;
c4 D 3  c3 D 3Š;
and, in general, that

so the series converges only for x D 0. What does this mean? Simply that the given dif-
ferential equation does not have a (convergent) power series solution of the assumed form
y D P cnxn. This example serves as a warning that the simple act of writing y D P cnxn
involves an assumption that may be false.

The identity .n C 2/.n C 1/cnC2 C cn D 0 now follows from the identity principle, and thus
we obtain the recurrence relation
cnC2 D 
cn
.n C 1/.n C 2/
(27)
for n = 0. It is evident that this formula will determine the coefﬁcients cn with even subscript
in terms of c0 and those of odd subscript in terms of c1; c0 and c1 are not predetermined and
thus will be the two arbitrary constants we expect to ﬁnd in a general solution of a second-
order equation.
When we apply the recurrence relation in (27) with n D 0, 2, and 4 in turn, we get
c2 D c0
2Š ;
c4 D c0
4Š ;
and
c6 D c0

Taking n D 1, 3, and 5 in turn, we ﬁnd that
c3 D c1

c5 D c1
5Š ;
and
c7 D c1

Again, the pattern is clear; we leave it for you to show (by induction) that for k = 1,
c2k D .1/kc0

and
c2kC1 D .1/kc1

that is, y.x/ D c0 cos x C c1 sin x. Note that we have no problem with the radius of conver-
gence here; the Taylor series for the sine and cosine functions converge for all x.
The solution of Example 4 can bear further comment. Suppose that we had
never heard of the sine and cosine functions, let alone their Taylor series. We would
then have discovered the two power series solutions

of the differential equation y00 C y D 0. Both of these power series converge for
all x. For instance, the ratio test in Theorem 3 implies convergence for all ´ of the
series P.1/n´n=.2n/Š obtained from (28) by writing ´ D x2. Hence it follows that
(28) itself converges for all x, as does (by a similar ploy) the series in (29).
It is clear that C.0/ D 1 and S.0/ D 0, and termwise differentiation of the two
series in (28) and (29) yields
C 0.x/ D S.x/
and
S0.x/ D C.x/:
(30)
Consequently, C 0.0/ D 0 and S0.0/ D 1. Thus with the aid of the power series
method (all the while knowing nothing about the sine and cosine functions), we
have discovered that y D C.x/ is the unique solution of
y00 C y D 0

that satisﬁes the initial conditions y.0/ D 1 and y0.0/ D 0, and that y D S.x/ is
the unique solution that satisﬁes the initial conditions y.0/ D 0 and y0.0/ D 1.
It follows that C.x/ and S.x/ are linearly independent, and—recognizing the im-
portance of the differential equation y00 C y D 0—we can agree to call C the cosine
function and S the sine function. Indeed, all the usual properties of these two func-
tions can be established, using only their initial values (at x D 0) and the derivatives
in (30); there is no need to refer to triangles or even to angles. (Can you use the se-
ries in (28) and (29) to show that ŒC.x/2 CŒS.x/2 D 1 for all x?) This demonstrates
that
The cosine and sine functions are fully determined by the differen-
tial equation y00 C y D 0 of which they are the two natural linearly
independent solutions.
Figures 8.1.2 and 8.1.3 show how the geometric character of the graphs of cos x and
sin x is revealed by the graphs of the Taylor polynomial approximations that we get
by truncating the inﬁnite series in (28) and (29).
This is by no means an uncommon situation. Many important special func-
tions of mathematics occur in the ﬁrst instance as power series solutions of differ-
ential equations and thus are in practice deﬁned by means of these power series.
In the remaining sections of this chapter we will see numerous examples of such
functions.

8.2 Series Solutions Near Ordinary Points
The power series method introduced in Section 8.1 can be applied to linear equa-
tions of any order (as well as to certain nonlinear equations), but its most important
applications are to homogeneous second-order linear differential equations of the
form
A.x/y00 C B.x/y0 C C.x/y D 0;
(1)

8.2 Series Solutions Near Ordinary Points
507
where the coefﬁcients A, B, and C are analytic functions of x. Indeed, in most
applications these coefﬁcient functions are simple polynomials.
We saw in Example 3 of Section 8.1 that the series method does not always
yield a series solution. To discover when it does succeed, we rewrite Eq. (1) in the
form
y00 C P.x/y0 C Q.x/y D 0
(2)
with leading coefﬁcient 1, and with P D B=A and Q D C=A. Note that P.x/ and
Q.x/ will generally fail to be analytic at points where A.x/ vanishes. For instance,
consider the equation
xy00 C y0 C xy D 0:
(3)
The coefﬁcient functions in (3) are continuous everywhere. But in the form of (2) it
is the equation
y00 C 1
x y0 C y D 0
(4)
with P.x/ D 1=x not analytic at x D 0.
The point x D a is called an ordinary point of Eq. (2)—and of the equiva-
lent Eq. (1)—provided that the functions P.x/ and Q.x/ are both analytic at x D a.
Otherwise, x D a is a singular point. Thus the only singular point of Eqs. (3) and
(4) is x D 0. Recall that a quotient of analytic functions is analytic wherever the
denominator is nonzero. It follows that, if A.a/ 6D 0 in Eq. (1) with analytic coef-
ﬁcients, then x D a is an ordinary point. If A.x/, B.x/, and C.x/ are polynomials
with no common factors, then x D a is an ordinary point if and only if A.a/ 6D 0.
Example 1
The point x D 0 is an ordinary point of the equation
xy00 C .sin x/y0 C x2y D 0;
despite the fact that A.x/ D x vanishes at x D 0. The reason is that
P.x/ D sin x

is nevertheless analytic at x D 0 because the division by x yields a convergent power series.
Example 2
The point x D 0 is not an ordinary point of the equation
y00 C x2y0 C x1=2y D 0:
For while P.x/ D x2 is analytic at the origin, Q.x/ D x1=2 is not. The reason is that Q.x/ is
not differentiable at x D 0 and hence is not analytic there. (Theorem 1 of Section 8.1 implies
that an analytic function must be differentiable.)
Example 3
The point x D 0 is an ordinary point of the equation
.1  x3/y00 C .7x2 C 3x5/y0 C .5x  13x4/y D 0
because the coefﬁcient functions A.x/, B.x/, and C.x/ are polynomials with A.0/ 6D 0.
Theorem 2 of Section 3.1 implies that Eq. (2) has two linearly independent
solutions on any open interval where the coefﬁcient functions P.x/ and Q.x/ are
continuous. The basic fact for our present purpose is that near an ordinary point a,
these solutions will be power series in powers of x  a. A proof of the following
theorem can be found in Chapter 3 of Coddington, An Introduction to Ordinary
Differential Equations (Dover Publications, 1989).

THEOREM 1
Solutions Near an Ordinary Point
Suppose that a is an ordinary point of the equation
A.x/y00 C B.x/y0 C C.x/y D 0I
(1)
that is, the functions P D B=A and Q D C=A are analytic at x D a. Then Eq. (1)
has two linearly independent solutions, each of the form

cn.x  a/n:
(5)
The radius of convergence of any such series solution is at least as large as the
distance from a to the nearest (real or complex) singular point of Eq. (1). The
coefﬁcients in the series in (5) can be determined by its substitution in Eq. (1).
Example 4
Determine the radius of convergence guaranteed by Theorem 1 of a series solution of
.x2 C 9/y00 C xy0 C x2y D 0
(6)
in powers of x. Repeat for a series in powers of x  4.
Solution
This example illustrates the fact that we must take into account complex singular points as
well as real ones. Because
P.x/ D
x
x2 C 9
and
Q.x/ D
x2
x2 C 9;
the only singular points of Eq. (6) are ˙3i. The distance (in the complex plane) of each of
these from 0 is 3, so a series solution of the form P cnxn has radius of convergence at least 3.
The distance of each singular point from 4 is 5, so a series solution of the form P cn.x  4/n
has radius of convergence at least 5 (see Fig. 8.2.1).
Example 5
Find the general solution in powers of x of
.x2  4/y00 C 3xy0 C y D 0:
(7)
Then ﬁnd the particular solution with y.0/ D 4, y0.0/ D 1.
Solution
The only singular points of Eq. (7) are ˙2, so the series we get will have radius of conver-
gence at least 2. (See Problem 35 for the exact radius of convergence.) Substitution of

Chapter 8 Power Series Methods
Remark As in Example 5, substitution of y D P cnxn in a linear second-order equation
with x D 0 an ordinary point typically leads to a recurrence relation that can be used to
express each of the successive coefﬁcients c2, c3, c4, : : : in terms of the ﬁrst two, c0 and c1.
In this event two linearly independent solutions are obtained as follows. Let y0.x/ be the
solution obtained with c0 D 1 and c1 D 0, and let y1.x/ be the solution obtained with c0 D 0
and c1 D 1. Then
y0.0/ D 1;
y0
0.0/ D 0
and
y1.0/ D 0;
y0
1.0/ D 1;
so it is clear that y0 and y1 are linearly independent. In Example 5, y0.x/ and y1.x/ are
deﬁned by the two series that appear on the right-hand side in Eq. (11), which expresses the
general solution in the form y D c0y0 C c1y1.
Translated Series Solutions
If in Example 5 we had sought a particular solution with given initial values y.a/
and y0.a/, we would have needed the general solution in the form
y.x/ D

X
nD0
cn.x  a/nI
(13)
that is, in powers of x  a rather than in powers of x. For only with a solution of the
form in (13) is it true that the initial conditions
y.a/ D c0
and
y0.a/ D c1
determine the arbitrary constants c0 and c1 in terms of the initial values of y and y0.
Consequently, to solve an initial value problem, we need a series expansion of the
general solution centered at the point where the initial conditions are speciﬁed.

Solution
We need a general solution of the form P cn.t  1/n. But instead of substituting this series
in (14) to determine the coefﬁcients, it simpliﬁes the computations if we ﬁrst make the sub-
stitution x D t  1, so that we wind up looking for a series of the form P cnxn after all. To
transform Eq. (14) into one with the new independent variable x, we note that

where primes denote differentiation with respect to x. Hence we transform Eq. (14) into

with initial conditions y D 4 and y0 D 1 at x D 0 (corresponding to t D 1). This is the initial
value problem we solved in Example 5, so the particular solution in (12) is available. We

This series converges if 1 < t < 3. (Why?) A series such as this can be used to estimate
numerical values of the solution. For instance,

The last computation in Example 6 illustrates the fact that series solutions of
differential equations are useful not only for establishing general properties of a
solution, but also for numerical computations when an expression of the solution in
terms of elementary functions is unavailable.
Types of Recurrence Relations
The formula in Eq. (8) is an example of a two-term recurrence relation; it expresses
each coefﬁcient in the series in terms of one of the preceding coefﬁcients. A many-
term recurrence relation expresses each coefﬁcient in the series in terms of two or
more preceding coefﬁcients. In the case of a many-term recurrence relation, it is
generally inconvenient or even impossible to ﬁnd a formula that gives the typical
coefﬁcient cn in terms of n. The next example shows what we sometimes can do
with a three-term recurrence relation.
Example 7
Find two linearly independent solutions of

We make the usual substitution of the power series y D P cnxn. This results in the equation

We can start the second sum at n D 0 without changing anything else. To make each term
include xn in its general term, we shift the index of summation in the ﬁrst sum by C2 (replace
n with n C 2), and we shift it by 2 in the third sum (replace n with n  2). These shifts yield

The common range of these three summations is n = 2, so we must separate the terms corre-

gives

Thus all values of cn for n = 4 are given in terms of the arbitrary constants c0 and c1 because

To get our ﬁrst solution y1 of Eq. (15), we choose c0 D 1 and c1 D 0, so that c2 D c3 D 0.

Because c1 D c3 D 0, it is clear from Eq. (16) that this series contains only terms of even

To obtain a second linearly independent solution y2 of Eq. (15), we take c0 D 0 and
c1 D 1, so that c2 D 0 and c3 D 1

Because c0 D c2 D 0, it is clear from Eq. (16) that this series contains only terms of odd

y0

2.0/ D 1. A general solution of Eq. (15) is a linear
combination of the power series in (18) and (19). Equation (15) has no singular points, so the
power series representing y1.x/ and y2.x/ converge for all x.
The Legendre Equation
The Legendre equation of order ˛ is the second-order linear differential equation
.1  x2/y00  2xy0 C ˛.˛ C 1/y D 0;
(20)
where the real number ˛ satisﬁes the inequality ˛ > 1. This differential equation
has extensive applications, ranging from numerical integration formulas (such as
Gaussian quadrature) to the problem of determining the steady-state temperature
within a solid spherical ball when the temperatures at points of its boundary are
known. The only singular points of the Legendre equation are at C1 and 1, so
it has two linearly independent solutions that can be expressed as power series in
powers of x with radius of convergence at least 1. The substitution y D P cmxm in
Eq. (20) leads (see Problem 31) to the recurrence relation
cmC2 D .˛  m/.˛ C m C 1/
.m C 1/.m C 2/
cm
(21)
for m = 0. We are using m as the index of summation because we have another role
for n to play.
In terms of the arbitrary constants c0 and c1, Eq. (21) yields

Now suppose that ˛ D n, a nonnegative integer. If ˛ D n is even, we see from
Eq. (22) that a2m D 0 when 2m > n. In this case, y1.x/ is a polynomial of degree n
and y2 is a (nonterminating) inﬁnite series. If ˛ D n is an odd positive integer, we see
from Eq. (23) that a2mC1 D 0 when 2m C 1 > n. In this case, y2.x/ is a polynomial
of degree n and y1 is a (nonterminating) inﬁnite series. Thus in either case, one of
the two solutions in (24) is a polynomial and the other is a nonterminating series.
With an appropriate choice (made separately for each n) of the arbitrary con-
stants c0 (n even) or c1 (n odd), the nth-degree polynomial solution of Legendre’s
equation of order n,
.1  x2/y00  2xy0 C n.n C 1/y D 0;
(25)
is denoted by Pn.x/ and is called the Legendre polynomial of degree n. It is
customary (for a reason indicated in Problem 32) to choose the arbitrary constant so
that the coefﬁcient of xn in Pn.x/ is .2n/Š=

are “interlaced”—that is, the n zeros of Hn lie in the n
bounded open intervals whose endpoints are successive
pairs of zeros of HnC1.

8.2 Application Automatic Computation of Series Coefﬁcients
Repeated application of a recurrence relation to grind out successive coefﬁcients
is—especially in the case of a recurrence relation with three or more terms—a te-
dious aspect of the inﬁnite series method. Here we illustrate the use of a computer
algebra system not only to automate this task, but also to explore interactively the
graphical effect of changing the number k of terms we include in a partial-sum
approximation to the actual solution given by the full inﬁnite series. In Example
7 we saw that the coefﬁcients in the series solution y D P cnxn of the differential
equation
y00  xy0  x2y D 0
(1)
are given in terms of the two arbitrary coefﬁcients c0 and c1 by
c2 D 0;
c3 D c1
6 ;
and
cnC2 D
ncn C cn2
.n C 2/.n C 1/
for
n = 2:
(2)
It would appear to be a routine matter to implement such a recurrence relation,
but a twist results from the fact that a typical computer system array is indexed by
the subscripts 1, 2, 3, : : : ; rather than by the subscripts 0, 1, 2, : : : that match the
exponents in the successive terms of a power series that begins with a constant term.
For this reason we ﬁrst rewrite our proposed power series solution in the form
y D
1
X
nD0
cnxn D

X
nD1
bnxn1
(3)
where bn D cn1 for each n = 1. Then the ﬁrst two conditions in (1) imply that
b3 D 0 and b4 D 1
6b2; also, the recurrence relation (with n replaced with n  1)
yields the new recurrence relation
bnC2 D cnC1 D .n  1/cn1 C cn3
.n C 1/n
D .n  1/bn C bn2

Now we are ready to begin. Suppose that we want to calculate the terms
through the 10th degree in (2) with the initial conditions b1 D b2 D 1. Then either

k := 11:
# k terms
b := array(1..k):
b[1] := 1:

b[4] := b[2]/6:
for n from 3 by 1 to k -- 2 do

or the Mathematica commands
k = 11;
( k terms )
b = Table[0, {n,1,k}];
b[[1]] = 1;
( arbitrary )
b[[2]] = 1;
( arbitrary )
b[[3]] = 0;
b[[4]] = b[[2]]/6;

For[n=3, n<=k--2,
b[[n+2]]=((n--1)b[[n]] + b[[n--2]])/(n(n+1)); n=n+1];

while

so the two rational fractions agree when rounded to 9 decimal places. The explana-
tion is that (unlike Mathematica and Maple) MATLAB works internally with deci-
mal rather than exact arithmetic. But at the end its format rat algorithm converts
a correct 14-place approximation for b10 into an incorrect rational fraction that’s
“close but no cigar.”
The MATLAB commands above form the basis for the interactive display
shown in Fig. 8.2.4, which graphs the actual solution (blue curve) of the differential
equation (1), with initial conditions b1 D b2 D 1, together with the approximate so-
lution (black curve) consisting of the terms through the fourth degree (k D 5) in (5).
The pop-up menu allows the user to vary the number of terms k and thus immedi-
ately see the graphical effect of changing the number of terms included in the series
expansion. With k D 10, the actual and approximate solutions are indistinguishable
in this viewing window.
Finally, you can substitute b1 D 1, b2 D 0 and b1 D 0, b2 D 1 separately
(instead of b1 D b2 D 1) in the commands shown here to derive partial sums of the
two linearly independent solutions displayed in Eqs. (18) and (19) of Example 7.
This technique can be applied to any of the examples and problems in this section.

near a singular point. Recall that if the functions A, B, and C are polynomials
having no common factors, then the singular points of Eq. (1) are simply those
points where A.x/ D 0. For instance, x D 0 is the only singular point of the Bessel
equation of order n,
x2y00 C xy0 C .x2  n2/y D 0;
whereas the Legendre equation of order n,
.1  x2/y00  2xy0 C n.n C 1/y D 0;
has the two singular points x D 1 and x D 1. It turns out that some of the features
of the solutions of such equations of the most importance for applications are largely
determined by their behavior near their singular points.
We will restrict our attention to the case in which x D 0 is a singular point of
Eq. (1). A differential equation having x D a as a singular point is easily transformed
by the substitution t D x a into one having a corresponding singular point at 0. For
example, let us substitute t D x  1 into the Legendre equation of order n. Because

and 1  x2 D 1  .t C 1/2 D 2t  t2, we get the equation
t.t C 2/d 2y
dt2  2.t C 1/dy
dt C n.n C 1/y D 0:
This new equation has the singular point t D 0 corresponding to x D 1 in the original
equation; it also has the singular point t D 2 corresponding to x D 1.
Types of Singular Points
A differential equation having a singular point at 0 ordinarily will not have power
series solutions of the form y.x/ D P cnxn, so the straightforward method of Sec-
tion 8.2 fails in this case. To investigate the form that a solution of such an equation
might take, we assume that Eq. (1) has analytic coefﬁcient functions and rewrite it
in the standard form
y00 C P.x/y0 C Q.x/y D 0;
(2)
where P D B=A and Q D C=A. Recall that x D 0 is an ordinary point (as opposed
to a singular point) of Eq. (2) if the functions P.x/ and Q.x/ are analytic at x D 0;
that is, if P.x/ and Q.x/ have convergent power series expansions in powers of x on
some open interval containing x D 0. Now it can be proved that each of the functions
P.x/ and Q.x/ either is analytic or approaches ˙1 as x ! 0. Consequently, x D 0
is a singular point of Eq. (2) provided that either P.x/ or Q.x/ (or both) approaches
˙1 as x ! 0. For instance, if we rewrite the Bessel equation of order n in the form
y00 C 1
x y0 C

1  n2
x2

y D 0;
we see that P.x/ D 1=x and Q.x/ D 1  .n=x/2 both approach inﬁnity as x ! 0.

8.3 Regular Singular Points
519
We will see presently that the power series method can be generalized to apply
near the singular point x D 0 of Eq. (2), provided that P.x/ approaches inﬁnity no
more rapidly than 1=x, and Q.x/ no more rapidly than 1=x2, as x ! 0. This is a
way of saying that P.x/ and Q.x/ have only “weak” singularities at x D 0. To state
this more precisely, we rewrite Eq. (2) in the form
y00 C p.x/
x
y0 C q.x/
x2 y D 0;
(3)
where
p.x/ D xP.x/
and
q.x/ D x2Q.x/:

DEFINITION
Regular Singular Point
The singular point x D 0 of Eq. (3) is a regular singular point if the functions
p.x/ and q.x/ are both analytic at x D 0. Otherwise it is an irregular singular
point.
In particular, the singular point x D 0 is a regular singular point if p.x/ and
q.x/ are both polynomials. For instance, we see that x D 0 is a regular singular
point of Bessel’s equation of order n by writing that equation in the form
y00 C 1
x y0 C x2  n2
x2
y D 0;
noting that p.x/  1 and q.x/ D x2  n2 are both polynomials in x.
By contrast, consider the equation
2x3y00 C .1 C x/y0 C 3xy D 0;
which has the singular point x D 0. If we write this equation in the form of (3), we
get
y00 C .1 C x/=.2x2/
x
y0 C

x2 y D 0:
Because
p.x/ D 1 C x
2x2
D

2x2 C 1

as x ! 0 (although q.x/  3
2 is a polynomial), we see that x D 0 is an irregular
singular point. We will not discuss the solution of differential equations near irreg-
ular singular points; this is a considerably more advanced topic than the solution of
differential equations near regular singular points.

both approach 1 as x ! 0, we see that x D 0 is a singular point. To determine the nature of
this singular point, we write the differential equation in the form of Eq. (3):
y00 C .4  x2/=.1 C x/
x
y0 C .2 C 3x/=.1 C x/
x2
y D 0:
Thus
p.x/ D 4  x2
1 C x
and
q.x/ D 2 C 3x
1 C x :
Because a quotient of polynomials is analytic wherever the denominator is nonzero, we see
that p.x/ and q.x/ are both analytic at x D 0. Hence x D 0 is a regular singular point of the
given differential equation.
It may happen that when we begin with a differential equation in the general
form in Eq. (1) and rewrite it in the form in (3), the functions p.x/ and q.x/ as given
in (4) are indeterminate forms at x D 0. In this case the situation is determined by
the limits
p0 D p.0/ D lim
x!0 p.x/ D lim
x!0 xP.x/
(5)
and
q0 D q.0/ D lim
x!0 q.x/ D lim
x!0 x2Q.x/:
(6)
If p0 D 0 D q0, then x D 0 may be an ordinary point of the differential equation
x2y00 C xp.x/y0 C q.x/y D 0 in (3). Otherwise:

If both the limits in (5) and (6) exist and are ﬁnite, then x D 0 is a regular
singular point.

If either limit fails to exist or is inﬁnite, then x D 0 is an irregular singular
point.
Remark The most common case in applications, for the differential equation written in the
form
y00 C p.x/
x
y0 C q.x/
x2 y D 0;
(3)
is that the functions p.x/ and q.x/ are polynomials. In this case p0 D p.0/ and q0 D q.0/ are
simply the constant terms of these polynomials, so there is no need to evaluate the limits in
Eqs. (5) and (6).
Example 2
To investigate the nature of the point x D 0 for the differential equation
x4y00 C .x2 sin x/y0 C .1  cos x/y D 0;
we ﬁrst write it in the form in (3):
y00 C .sin x/=x

for the limits in (5) and (6). Since they are not both zero, we see that x D 0 is not an ordinary
point. But both limits are ﬁnite, so the singular point x D 0 is regular. Alternatively, we could

These (convergent) power series show explicitly that p.x/ and q.x/ are analytic and moreover
that p0 D p.0/ D 1 and q0 D q.0/ D 1

singular point.
The Method of Frobenius
We now approach the task of actually ﬁnding solutions of a second-order linear dif-
ferential equation near the regular singular point x D 0. The simplest such equation
is the constant-coefﬁcient equidimensional equation
x2y00 C p0xy0 C q0y D 0
(7)
to which Eq. (3) reduces when p.x/  p0 and q.x/  q0 are constants. In this case
we can verify by direct substitution that the simple power function y.x/ D xr is a
solution of Eq. (7) if and only if r is a root of the quadratic equation
r.r  1/ C p0r C q0 D 0:
(8)
In the general case, in which p.x/ and q.x/ are power series rather than con-
stants, it is a reasonable conjecture that our differential equation might have a solu-
tion of the form
y.x/ D xr

cnxn D

X
nD0
cnxnCr D c0xr C c1xrC1 C c2xrC2 C   
(9)
—the product of xr and a power series. This turns out to be a very fruitful con-
jecture; according to Theorem 1 (soon to be stated formally), every equation of the
form in (1) having x D 0 as a regular singular point does, indeed, have at least one
such solution. This fact is the basis for the method of Frobenius, named for the
German mathematician Georg Frobenius (1848–1917), who discovered the method
in the 1870s.
An inﬁnite series of the form in (9) is called a Frobenius series. Note that
a Frobenius series is generally not a power series. For instance, with r D  1
2 the
series in (9) takes the form
y D c0x1=2 C c1x1=2 C c2x3=2 C c3x5=2 C    I
it is not a series in integral powers of x.

522
Chapter 8 Power Series Methods
To investigate the possible existence of Frobenius series solutions, we begin
with the equation
x2y00 C xp.x/y0 C q.x/y D 0;
(10)
obtained by multiplying the equation in (3) by x2. If x D 0 is a regular singular
point, then p.x/ and q.x/ are analytic at x D 0, so
p.x/ D p0 C p1x C p2x2 C p3x3 C    ;
q.x/ D q0 C q1x C q2x2 C q3x3 C    :
(11)
Suppose that Eq. (10) has the Frobenius series solution
y D

nD0

(12)
We may (and always do) assume that c0 6D 0 because the series must have a ﬁrst
nonzero term. Termwise differentiation in Eq. (12) leads to

cn.n C r/xnCr1
(13)
and
y00 D

cn.n C r/.n C r  1/xnCr2:
(14)
Substitution of the series in Eqs. (11) through (14) in Eq. (10) now yields

c0xr C c1xrC1 C   

D 0:
(15)
Upon multiplying initial terms of the two products on the left-hand side here and
then collecting coefﬁcients of xr, we see that the lowest-degree term in Eq. (15) is
c0Œr.r 1/Cp0r Cq0xr. If Eq. (15) is to be satisﬁed identically, then the coefﬁcient
of this term (as well as those of the higher-degree terms) must vanish. But we are
assuming that c0 6D 0, so it follows that r must satisfy the quadratic equation
r.r  1/ C p0r C q0 D 0
(16)
of precisely the same form as that obtained with the equidimensional equation in (7).
Equation (16) is called the indicial equation of the differential equation in (10), and
its two roots (possibly equal) are the exponents of the differential equation (at the
regular singular point x D 0).
Our derivation of Eq. (16) shows that if the Frobenius series y D xr P cnxn
is to be a solution of the differential equation in (10), then the exponent r must be
one of the roots r1 and r2 of the indicial equation in (16). If r1 6D r2, it follows that
there are two possible Frobenius series solutions, whereas if r1 D r2 there is only one
possible Frobenius series solution; the second solution cannot be a Frobenius series.

8.3 Regular Singular Points
523
The exponents r1 and r2 in the possible Frobenius series solutions are determined
(using the indicial equation) by the values p0 D p.0/ and q0 D q.0/ that we have
discussed. In practice, particularly when the coefﬁcients in the differential equation
in the original form in (1) are polynomials, the simplest way of ﬁnding p0 and q0 is
often to write the equation in the form
y00 C p0 C p1x C p2x2 C   
x
y0 C q0 C q1x C q2x2 C   
x2
y D 0:
(17)
Then inspection of the series that appear in the two numerators reveals the constants
p0 and q0.

Frobenius Series Solutions
Once the exponents r1 and r2 are known, the coefﬁcients in a Frobenius series so-
lution are determined by substitution of the series in Eqs. (12) through (14) in the
differential equation, essentially the same method as was used to determine coef-
ﬁcients in power series solutions in Section 8.2. If the exponents r1 and r2 are
complex conjugates, then there always exist two linearly independent Frobenius se-
ries solutions. We will restrict our attention here to the case in which r1 and r2 are
both real. We also will seek solutions only for x > 0. Once such a solution has been
found, we need only replace xr1 with jxjr1 to obtain a solution for x < 0. The fol-
lowing theorem is proved in Chapter 4 of Coddington’s An Introduction to Ordinary
Differential Equations.

Let r1 and r2 be the (real) roots, with r1 = r2, of the indicial equation r.r  1/ C

corresponding to the smaller root r2.
The radii of convergence of the power series in Eqs. (18) and (19) are each
at least . The coefﬁcients in these series can be determined by substituting
the series in the differential equation
x2y00 C xp.x/y0 C q.x/y D 0:
We have already seen that if r1 D r2, then there can exist only one Frobenius
series solution. It turns out that, if r1  r2 is a positive integer, there may or may
not exist a second Frobenius series solution of the form in Eq. (19) corresponding to
the smaller root r2. These exceptional cases are discussed in Section 8.4. Examples
4 through 6 illustrate the process of determining the coefﬁcients in those Frobenius
series solutions that are guaranteed by Theorem 1.
Example 4
Find the Frobenius series solutions of
2x2y00 C 3xy0  .x2 C 1/y D 0:

so the exponents are r1 D 1

guarantees the existence of two linearly independent Frobenius series solutions. Rather than
separately substituting

in Eq. (20), it is more efﬁcient to begin by substituting y D xr P cnxn. We will then get a

for the series for y1, whereas with r2 D 1 it becomes a recurrence relation for the series for
y2.

At this stage there are several ways to proceed. A good standard practice is to shift indices so
that each exponent will be the same as the smallest one present. In this example, we shift the

The common range of summation is n = 2, so we must treat n D 0 and n D 1 separately. Fol-

In this example we have not been able to ﬁnd a second linearly independent solution of
Bessel’s equation of order zero. We will derive that solution in Section 8.4; it will not be a
Frobenius series.
When r1  r2 Is an Integer
Recall that, if r1  r2 is a positive integer, then Theorem 1 guarantees only the
existence of the Frobenius series solution corresponding to the larger exponent r1.
Example 6 illustrates the fortunate case in which the series method nevertheless
yields a second Frobenius series solution. The case in which the second solution is
not a Frobenius series will be discussed in Section 8.4.
Example 6
Find the Frobenius series solutions of
xy00 C 2y0 C xy D 0:
(31)
Solution
In standard form the equation becomes
y00 C 2
x y0 C x2
x2 y D 0;
so we see that x D 0 is a regular singular point with p0 D 2 and q0 D 0. The indicial equation
r.r  1/ C 2r D r.r C 1/ D 0
has roots r1 D 0 and r2 D 1, which differ by an integer. In this case when r1 r2 is an integer,
it is better to depart from the standard procedure of Example 4 and begin our work with the
smaller exponent. As you will see, the recurrence relation will then tell us whether or not a
second Frobenius series solution exists. If it does exist, our computations will simultaneously
yield both Frobenius series solutions. If the second solution does not exist, we begin anew
with the larger exponent r D r1 to obtain the one Frobenius series solution guaranteed by
Theorem 1.
Hence we begin by substituting

The cases n D 0 and n D 1 reduce to

and
0  c1 D 0:
Hence we have two arbitrary constants c0 and c1 and therefore can expect to ﬁnd a general
solution incorporating two linearly independent Frobenius series solutions. If, for n D 1, we
had obtained an equation such as 0  c1 D 3, which can be satisﬁed for no choice of c1, this
would have told us that no second Frobenius series solution could exist.

8.3 Regular Singular Points
529
Summary
When confronted with a linear second-order differential equation
A.x/y00 C B.x/y0 C C.x/y D 0
with analytic coefﬁcient functions, in order to investigate the possible existence of
series solutions we ﬁrst write the equation in the standard form
y00 C P.x/y0 C Q.x/y D 0:
If P.x/ and Q.x/ are both analytic at x D 0, then x D 0 is an ordinary point, and
the equation has two linearly independent power series solutions.
Otherwise, x D 0 is a singular point, and we next write the differential equation
in the form
y00 C p.x/
x
y0 C q.x/
x2 y D 0:
If p.x/ and q.x/ are both analytic at x D 0, then x D 0 is a regular singular point.
In this case we ﬁnd the two exponents r1 and r2 (assumed real, and with r1 = r2) by
solving the indicial equation
r.r  1/ C p0r C q0 D 0;
where p0 D p.0/ and q0 D q.0/. There always exists a Frobenius series solution
y D xr1 P anxn associated with the larger exponent r1, and if r1  r2 is not an
integer, the existence of a second Frobenius series solution y2 D xr2 P bnxn is also
guaranteed.
8.3 Problems
In Problems 1 through 8, determine whether x D 0 is an ordi-
nary point, a regular singular point, or an irregular singular
point. If it is a regular singular point, ﬁnd the exponents of the
differential equation at x D 0.

If x D a 6D 0 is a singular point of a second-order linear dif-
ferential equation, then the substitution t D x  a transforms
it into a differential equation having t D 0 as a singular point.
We then attribute to the original equation at x D a the behavior
of the new equation at t D 0. Classify (as regular or irregular)
the singular points of the differential equations in Problems 9

8.3 Application Automating the Frobenius Series Method
Here we illustrate the use of a computer algebra system such as Maple to apply
the method of Frobenius. More complete versions of this application—illustrating
the use of Maple, Mathematica, and MATLAB—can be found in the applications
manual that accompanies this text. We consider the differential equation
2x2y00 C 3xy0  .x2 C 1/y D 0
(1)
of Example 4 in this section, where we found the two indicial roots r1 D 1
2 and
r2 D 1.
Beginning with the indicial root r1 D 1
2, we ﬁrst write the initial seven terms
of a proposed Frobenius series solution:
a := array(0..6):
y := x^(1/2)sum( a[n]x^(n), n = 0..6);
y WD px

a0 C a1x C a2x2 C a3x3 C a4x4 C a5x5 C a6x6	
Then we substitute this series (actually, partial sum) into the left-hand side of Eq. (1).
deq1 := 2x^2diff(y,x$2) + 3xdiff(y,x) -- (x^2 + 1)y:
Evidently x3=2 will factor out upon simpliﬁcation, so we multiply by x3=2 and then
collect coefﬁcients of like powers of x.
deq2 := collect( x^(--3/2)simplify(deq1), x);
deq2 WD x7a6  x6a5 C .90a6  a4/x5 C .a3 C 65a5/x4
C .a2 C 44a4/x3 C .a1 C 27a3/x2 C .14a2  a0/x C 5a1
We see here the equations that the successive coefﬁcients must satisfy. We can
select them automatically by deﬁning an array, then ﬁlling the elements of this array
by equating to zero (in turn) each of the coefﬁcients in the series.

532
Chapter 8 Power Series Methods
eqs := array(0..5):
for n from 0 to 5 do
eqs[n] := coeff(deq1,x,n) = 0:

coeffEqs := convert(eqs, set);

90a6  a4 D 0; 14a2  a0 D 0; a1 C 27a3 D 0

We now have a collection of six linear equations relating the seven coefﬁcients
(a0 through a6). Hence we can proceed to solve for the successive coefﬁcients in
terms of a0.
succCoeffs := convert([seq(a[n], n=1..6)], set);
ourCoeffs := solve(coeffEqs, succCoeffs);

8.4 Method of Frobenius: The Exceptional Cases
We continue our discussion of the equation
y00 C p.x/
x
y0 C q.x/
x2 y D 0
(1)
where p.x/ and q.x/ are analytic at x D 0 and x D 0 is a regular singular point. If
the roots r1 and r2 of the indicial equation
.r/ D r.r  1/ C p0r C q0 D 0
(2)
do not differ by an integer, then Theorem 1 of Section 8.3 guarantees that Eq. (1)
has two linearly independent Frobenius series solutions. We consider now the more
complex situation in which r1  r2 is an integer. If r1 D r2, then there is only one
exponent available, and thus there can be only one Frobenius series solution. But
we saw in Example 6 of Section 8.3 that if r1 D r2 C N, with N a positive integer,
then it is possible that a second Frobenius series solution exists. We will also see
that it is possible that such a solution does not exist. In fact, the second solution
involves ln x when it is not a Frobenius series. As you will see in Examples 3 and 4,
these exceptional cases occur in the solution of Bessel’s equation. For applications,
this is the most important second-order linear differential equation with variable
coefﬁcients.
The Nonlogarithmic Case with r1 D r2 C N
In Section 8.3 we derived the indicial equation by substituting the power series

in which the coefﬁcients depend on r. It turns out that the coefﬁcient of xr is

(6)
which gives the indicial equation because c0 6D 0 by assumption; also, for n = 1, the

Chapter 8 Power Series Methods
Because all the coefﬁcients in (5) must vanish for the Frobenius series to be a
solution of Eq. (4), it follows that the exponent r and the coefﬁcients c0; c1; : : : ; cn
must satisfy the equation
.r C n/cn C Ln.rI c0; c1; : : : ; cn1/ D 0:
(9)
This is a recurrence relation for cn in terms of c0; c1; : : : ; cn1.
Now suppose that r1 D r2 C N with N a positive integer. If we use the larger
exponent r1 in Eq. (9), then the coefﬁcient .r1 C n/ of cn will be nonzero for
every n = 1 because .r/ D 0 only when r D r1 and when r D r2 < r1. Once
c0; c1; : : : ; cn1 have been determined, we therefore can solve Eq. (9) for cn and
continue to compute successive coefﬁcients in the Frobenius series solution corre-
sponding to the exponent r1.
But when we use the smaller exponent r2, there is a potential difﬁculty in
computing cN. For in this case .r2 C N / D 0, so Eq. (9) becomes
0  cN C LN .r2I c0; c1; : : : ; cN1/ D 0:

At this stage c0; c1; : : : ; cN1 have already been determined. If it happens that

then we can choose cN arbitrarily and continue to determine the remaining coefﬁ-
cients in a second Frobenius series solution. But if it happens that
LN .r2I c0; c1; : : : ; cN1/ 6D 0;
then Eq. (10) is not satisﬁed with any choice of cN; in this case there cannot exist a
second Frobenius series solution corresponding to the smaller exponent r2. Exam-
ples 1 and 2 illustrate these two possibilities.
Example 1
Consider the equation
x2y00 C .6x C x2/y0 C xy D 0:
(11)
Here p0 D 6 and q0 D 0, so the indicial equation is
.r/ D r.r  1/ C 6r D r2 C 5r D 0
(12)
with roots r1 D 0 and r2 D 5; the roots differ by the integer N D 5. We substitute the
Frobenius series y D P cnxnCr and get

(13)

which in this example corresponds to the general solution in (9). Note that the coefﬁcient of
cn is .n C r/.
We now follow the recommendation in Section 8.3 for the case r1 D r2 C N: We begin
with the smaller root r2 D 5. With r2 D 5, Eq. (13) reduces to
n.n  5/cn C .n  5/cn1 D 0:
(14)
If n 6D 5, we can solve this equation for cn to obtain the recurrence relation
cn D cn1

for n 6D 5.
(15)
This yields
c1 D c0;
c2 D c1

c3 D c2

and
c4 D c3

(16)
In the case r1 D r2 C N, it is always the coefﬁcient cN that requires special consideration.
Here N D 5, and for n D 5 Eq. (14) takes the form 0c5 C0 D 0. Hence c5 is a second arbitrary
constant, and we can compute additional coefﬁcients, still using the recursion formula in (15):

c8 D c7

and so on.

(19)
which corresponds in this example to the general equation in (9); note that the coefﬁcient of

We work ﬁrst with the smaller root r D r2 D 2. Then Eq. (19) becomes
n.n  6/cn C cn2 D 0

for n = 2. For n 6D 6 we can solve for the recurrence relation

Because c1 D 0, this formula gives

and

Now Eq. (20) with n D 6 reduces to
0  c6 C c0
64 D 0:
But c0 6D 0 by assumption, and hence there is no way to choose c6 so that this equation holds.
Thus there is no Frobenius series solution corresponding to the smaller root r2 D 2.
To ﬁnd the single Frobenius series solution corresponding to the larger root r1 D 4, we
substitute r D 4 in Eq. (19) to obtain the recurrence relation

8.4 Method of Frobenius: The Exceptional Cases

Reduction of Order
When only a single Frobenius series solution exists, we need an additional tech-
nique. We discuss here the method of reduction of order, which enables us to
use one known solution y1 of a second-order homogeneous linear differential equa-
tion to ﬁnd a second linearly independent solution y2. Consider the second-order
equation
y00 C P.x/y0 C Q.x/y D 0
(23)
on an open interval I on which P and Q are continuous. Suppose that we know one
solution y1 of Eq. (23). By Theorem 2 of Section 3.1, there exists a second linearly
independent solution y2; our problem is to ﬁnd y2. Equivalently, we would like to
ﬁnd the quotient
v.x/ D y2.x/
y1.x/:
(24)
Once we know v.x/, y2 will then be given by
y2.x/ D v.x/y1.x/:
(25)
We begin by substituting the expression in (25) in Eq. (23), using the
derivatives
y0
2 D vy0
1 C v0y1
and
y00
2 D vy00
1 C 2v0y0
1 C v00y1:
We get

vy00
1 C 2v0y0
1 C v00y1

C P

vy0
1 C v0y1

C Qvy1 D 0;
and rearrangement gives
v

y00
1 C Py0
1 C Qy1

C v00y1 C 2v0y0
1 C P v0y1 D 0:
But the bracketed expression in this last equation vanishes because y1 is a solution
of Eq. (23). This leaves the equation
v00y1 C .2y0
1 C Py1/v0 D 0:
(26)
The key to the success of this method is that Eq. (26) is linear in v0. Thus the
substitution in (25) has reduced the second-order linear equation in (23) to the ﬁrst-
order (in v0) linear equation in (26). If we write u D v0 and assume that y1.x/ never
vanishes on I, then Eq. (26) yields

This formula provides a second solution y2.x/ of Eq. (23) on any interval where
y1.x/ is never zero. Note that because an exponential function never vanishes, y2.x/
is a nonconstant multiple of y1.x/, so y1 and y2 are linearly independent solutions.
Example 3
For an elementary application of the reduction-of-order formula consider the differential
equation
x2y00  9xy0 C 25y D 0:
In Section 8.3 we mentioned that the equidimensional equation x2y00 C p0xy0 C q0y D 0
has the power function y.x/ D xr as a solution if and only if r is a root of the quadratic
equation r2 C .p0  1/r C q0 D 0. Here p0 D 9 and q0 D 25, so our quadratic equation is
r2  10r C 25 D .r  5/2 D 0 and has the single (repeated) root r D 5. This gives the single
power function solution y1.x/ D x5 of our differential equation.
Before we can apply the reduction-of-order formula to ﬁnd a second solution, we must
ﬁrst divide the equation x2y00 9xy0 C25y D 0 by its leading coefﬁcient x2 to get the standard
form
y00  9
x y0 C 25
x2 y D 0
in Eq. (23) with leading coefﬁcient 1. Thus we have P.x/ D 9=x and Q.x/ D 25=x2, so the
reduction-of-order formula in (28) yields the second linearly independent solution
y2.x/ D x5

for x > 0. Thus our particular equidimensional equation has the two independent solutions
y1.x/ D x5 and y2.x/ D x5 ln x for x > 0.
Similar applications of the reduction-of-order formula can be found in Prob-
lems 37–44 of Section 3.2—where we introduced the method of reduction of order
in Problem 36 (though without deriving there the reduction-of-order formula itself).

Q.x/ for q.x/=x2. Thus we can rewrite Eq. (1) in the form y00 C Py0 C Qy D 0 of
Eq. (23).
Because the indicial equation has roots r1 and r2 D r1  N, it can be factored
easily:
r2 C .p0  1/r C q0 D .r  r1/.r  r1 C N /
D r2 C .N  2r1/r C .r2
1  r1N / D 0;
so we see that
p0  1 D N  2r1I
that is,
p0  2r1 D 1  N:

want to ascertain the general form of y2 without keeping track of speciﬁc coefﬁ-

in (33). If it happens that CN D 0, then there is no logarithmic term; if so, Eq. (1)
has a second Frobenius series solution (as in Example 1).
In our derivation of Eqs. (33) and (34)—which exhibit the general form of the
second solution in the cases r1 D r2 and r1  r2 D N > 0, respectively—we have
said nothing about the radii of convergence of the various power series that appear.
Theorem 1 (next) is a summation of the preceding discussion and also tells where
the series in (33) and (34) converge. As in Theorem 1 of Section 8.3, we restrict our
attention to solutions for x > 0.

the power series of this theorem are all at least . The coefﬁcients in these series
(and the constant C in Eq. (36b)) may be determined by direct substitution of the
series in the differential equation in (4).

The only term involving x in Eq. (40) is b1x, so b1 D 0. But n2bn C bn2 D 0 if n is odd,
and it follows that all the coefﬁcients of odd subscript in y2 vanish.
Now we examine the coefﬁcients with even subscripts in Eq. (40). First we see that

For n = 2, we read the recurrence relation
.2n/2b2n C b2n2 D .2/.1/n.2n/
22n.nŠ/2
(42)
from (40). Note the “nonhomogeneous” term (not involving the unknown coefﬁcients) on
the right-hand side in (42). Such nonhomogeneous recurrence relations are typical of the
exceptional cases of the method of Frobenius, and their solution often requires a bit of inge-
nuity. The usual strategy depends on detecting the most conspicuous dependence of b2n on
n. We note the presence of 22n.nŠ/2 on the right-hand side in (42); in conjunction with the
coefﬁcient .2n/2 on the left-hand side, we are induced to think of b2n as something divided
by 22n.nŠ/2. Noting also the alternation of sign, we make the substitution
b2n D .1/nC1c2n
22n.nŠ/2
;
(43)
in the expectation that the recurrence relation for c2n will be simpler than the one for b2n.
We chose .1/nC1 rather than .1/n because b2 D 1

second such solution does not exist.

in a second linearly independent solution.

8.4 Application The Exceptional Case by Reduction of Order
Here we illustrate the use of a computer algebra system such as Mathematica to
implement the reduction of order formula in Eq. (28) of this section. More complete
versions of this application—using Maple, Mathematica, and MATLAB—can be
found in the computing applications manual that accompanies this text. To illustrate
the method, we will derive a second solution of Bessel’s equation of order zero,
beginning with the known power series solution

.1/n
x2n
22n.nŠ/2 ;
which we enter in the form
y1 = Sum[((--x^2/4)^n) / (n!)^2, {n, 0, 5}] + O[x]^12
Then with
P = 1/x;

8.5 Bessel’s Equation

we need only substitute in the integral in Eq. (28):

128 C 23x6
3456 C 677x8
589824 C 7313x10
36864000 C O.x12/
Then—multiplying J0 = y1 times the logarithm and the series terms separately—
the computation
y2 = J0Log[x] + y1(integral -- Log[x])
yields the second solution

of Bessel’s equation of order zero (as we see it in Eq. (45) of the text).
After verifying (with your computer algebra system) the computations we
present here, you can begin with the power series for J1.x/ in Eq. (49) of this sec-
tion and derive similarly the second solution in (50) of Bessel’s equation of order 1.
Problems 9 through 14 can also be partially automated in this way.
8.5 Bessel’s Equation
We have already seen several cases of Bessel’s equation of order p = 0,
x2y00 C xy0 C .x2  p2/y D 0:
(1)
Its solutions are now called Bessel functions of order p. Such functions ﬁrst ap-
peared in the 1730s in the work of Daniel Bernoulli and Euler on the oscillations
of a vertically suspended chain. The equation itself appears in a 1764 article by
Euler on the vibrations of a circular drumhead, and Fourier used Bessel functions in
his classical treatise on heat (1822). But their general properties were ﬁrst studied
systematically in an 1824 memoir by the German astronomer and mathematician
Friedrich W. Bessel (1784–1846), who was investigating the motion of planets. The
standard source of information on Bessel functions is G. N. Watson’s A Treatise on
the Theory of Bessel Functions, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
1944). Its 36 pages of references, which cover only the period up to 1922, give
some idea of the vast literature of this subject.
Bessel’s equation in (1) has indicial equation r2  p2 D 0, with roots r D ˙p.
If we substitute y D P cmxmCr in Eq. (1), we ﬁnd in the usual manner that c1 D 0
and that

.m C r/2  p2
cm C cm2 D 0
(2)
for m = 2. The veriﬁcation of Eq. (2) is left to the reader (Problem 6).
The Case r D p > 0
If we use r D p and write am in place of cm, then Eq. (2) yields the recursion formula
am D 
am2
m.2p C m/:
(3)

548
Chapter 8 Power Series Methods
Because a1 D 0, it follows that am D 0 for all odd values of m. The ﬁrst few even
coefﬁcients are

The general pattern is
a2m D

so with the larger root r D p we get the solution
y1.x/ D a0

X
mD0
.1/mx2mCp
22mmŠ .p C 1/.p C 2/    .p C m/:
(4)
If p D 0 this is the only Frobenius series solution; with a0 D 1 as well, it is the
function J0.x/ we have seen before.
The Case r D p < 0
If we use r D p and write bm in place of cm, Eq. (2) takes the form
m.m  2p/bm C bm2 D 0
(5)
for m = 2, whereas b1 D 0. We see that there is a potential difﬁculty if it happens that
2p is a positive integer—that is, if p is either a positive integer or an odd positive
integral multiple of 1
2. For then when m D 2p, Eq. (5) is simply 0  bm C bm2 D 0.
Thus if bm2 6D 0, then no value of bm can satisfy this equation.
But if p is an odd positive integral multiple of 1
2, we can circumvent this
difﬁculty. For suppose that p D k=2 where k is an odd positive integer. Then we
need only choose bm D 0 for all odd values of m. The crucial step is the kth step,
k.k  k/bk C bk2 D 0I
and this equation will hold because bk D bk2 D 0.
Hence if p is not a positive integer, we take bm D 0 for m odd and deﬁne the
coefﬁcients of even subscript in terms of b0 by means of the recursion formula
bm D 
bm2
m.m  2p/;
m = 2:
(6)
In comparing (6) with (3), we see that (6) will lead to the same result as that in (4),
except with p replaced with p. Thus in this case we obtain the second solution
y2.x/ D b0

X
mD0
.1/mx2mp
22mmŠ .p C 1/.p C 2/    .p C m/:
(7)
The series in (4) and (7) converge for all x > 0 because x D 0 is the only singular
point of Bessel’s equation. If p > 0, then the leading term in y1 is a0xp, whereas
the leading term in y2 is b0xp. Hence y1.0/ D 0, but y2.x/ ! ˙1 as x ! 0, so
it is clear that y1 and y2 are linearly independent solutions of Bessel’s equation of
order p > 0.

8.5 Bessel’s Equation

The Gamma Function
The formulas in (4) and (7) can be simpliﬁed by use of the gamma function .x/,
which (as in Section 7.1) is deﬁned for x > 0 by
.x/ D
Z 1
0
ettx1 dt:
(8)
It is not difﬁcult to show that this improper integral converges for each x > 0. The
gamma function is a generalization for x > 0 of the factorial function nŠ, which
is deﬁned only if n is a nonnegative integer. To see the way in which .x/ is a
generalization of nŠ, we note ﬁrst that

that is,
.x C 1/ D x.x/:
(10)
This is the most important property of the gamma function.
If we combine Eqs. (9) and (10), we see that
.2/ D 1  .1/ D 1Š;
.3/ D 2  .2/ D 2Š;
.4/ D 3  .3/ D 3Š;
and in general that
.n C 1/ D nŠ

is known, but is far from obvious. [See, for instance, Example 5 in Section 13.4 of
Edwards and Penney, Calculus: Early Transcendentals, 7th edition (Upper Saddle
River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2008).]
Although .x/ is deﬁned in (8) only for x > 0, we can use the recursion
formula in (10) to deﬁne .x/ whenever x is neither zero nor a negative integer. If
1 < x < 0, then

the right-hand side is deﬁned because 0 < x C 1 < 1. The same formula may then
be used to extend the deﬁnition of .x/ to the open interval .2; 1/, then to the
open interval .3; 2/, and so on. The graph of the gamma function thus extended
is shown in Fig. 8.5.1. The student who would like to pursue this fascinating topic
further should consult Artin’s The Gamma Function (New York: Holt, Rinehart and

.p C m C 1/ D .p C m/.p C m  1/    .p C 2/.p C 1/.p C 1/

The graphs of J0.x/ and J1.x/ are shown in Fig. 8.5.2. In a general way they re-
semble damped cosine and sine oscillations, respectively (see Problem 27). Indeed,
if you examine the series in (17), you can see part of the reason why J0.x/ and
cos x might be similar—only minor changes in the denominators in (17) are needed
to produce the Taylor series for cos x. As suggested by Fig. 8.5.2, the zeros of the

8.5 Bessel’s Equation

functions J0.x/ and J1.x/ are interlaced—between any two consecutive zeros of
J0.x/ there is precisely one zero of J1.x/ (Problem 26) and vice versa. The ﬁrst
four zeros of J0.x/ are approximately 2:4048, 5:5201, 8:6537, and 11:7915. For

with the notation used there. If n D 0 then the ﬁrst sum in (20) is taken to be zero.
Here, Yn.x/ is called the Bessel function of the second kind of integral order
n = 0.
The general solution of Bessel’s equation of integral order n is
y.x/ D c1Jn.x/ C c2Yn.x/:
(21)
It is important to note that Yn.x/ ! 1 as x ! 0 (Fig. 8.5.4). Hence c2 D 0 in
Eq. (21) if y.x/ is continuous at x D 0. Thus if y.x/ is a continuous solution of
Bessel’s equation of order n, it follows that
y.x/ D cJn.x/

for some constant c. Because J0.0/ D 1, we see in addition that if n D 0, then
c D y.0/. In Section 10.4 we will see that this single fact regarding Bessel functions
has numerous physical applications.
Figure 8.5.5 illustrates the fact that for n > 1 the graphs of Jn.x/ and Yn.x/
look generally like those of J1.x/ and Y1.x/. In particular, Jn.0/ D 0 while Yn.x/ !

and
J 0
p.x/ D p

(25)
Thus we may express the derivatives of Bessel functions in terms of Bessel functions
themselves. Subtraction of Eq. (25) from Eq. (24) gives the recursion formula
JpC1.x/ D 2p
x Jp.x/  Jp1.x/;
(26)
which can be used to express Bessel functions of high order in terms of Bessel
functions of lower orders. In the form
Jp1.x/ D 2p
x Jp.x/  JpC1.x/;
(27)
it can be used to express Bessel functions of large negative order in terms of Bessel
functions of numerically smaller negative orders.
The identities in Eqs. (22) through (27) hold wherever they are meaningful—
that is, whenever no Bessel functions of negative integral order appear. In particular,
they hold for all nonintegral values of p.
Example 1
With p D 0, Eq. (22) gives
Z

Similarly, with p D 0, Eq. (23) gives

The Parametric Bessel Equation
The parametric Bessel equation of order n is
x2y00 C xy0 C .˛2x2  n2/y D 0;
(28)
where ˛ is a positive parameter. As we will see in Chapter 10, this equation appears
in the solution of Laplace’s equation in polar coordinates. It is easy to see (Prob-
lem 9) that the substitution t D ˛x transforms Eq. (28) into the (standard) Bessel
equation
t2 d 2y
dt2 C t dy
dt C .t2  n2/y D 0
(29)
with general solution y.t/ D c1Jn.t/ C c2Yn.t/.
Hence the general solution of
Eq. (28) is
y.x/ D c1Jn.˛x/ C c2Yn.˛x/:
(30)
Now consider the eigenvalue problem
x2y00 C xy0 C .x2  n2/ D 0;
y.L/ D 0
(31)
on the interval Œ0; L. We seek the positive values of  for which there exists a
nontrivial solution of (31) that is continuous on Œ0; L. If we write  D ˛2, then the
differential equation in (31) is that in Eq. (28), so its general solution is given in
Eq. (30). Because Yn.x/ ! 1 as x ! 0 but Jn.0/ is ﬁnite, the continuity of y.x/
requires that c2 D 0. Thus y.x/ D c1Jn.˛x/. The endpoint condition y.L/ D 0 now
implies that ´ D ˛L must be a (positive) root of the equation
Jn.´/ D 0:
(32)
For n > 1, Jn.x/ oscillates rather like J1.x/ in Fig. 8.5.2 and hence has an inﬁnite
sequence of positive zeros n1, n2, n3, : : : (see Fig 8.5.6). It follows that the kth

8.6 Applications of Bessel Functions
The importance of Bessel functions stems not only from the frequent appearance of
Bessel’s equation in applications, but also from the fact that the solutions of many
other second-order linear differential equations can be expressed in terms of Bessel
functions. To see how this comes about, we begin with Bessel’s equation of order p
in the form
´2 d 2w
d´2 C ´dw
d´ C .´2  p2/w D 0;
(1)
and substitute
w D x˛y;
´ D kxˇ:
(2)
Then a routine but somewhat tedious transformation (Problem 14) of Eq. (1) yields
x2y00 C .1  2˛/xy0 C .˛2  ˇ2p2 C ˇ2k2x2ˇ/y D 0I
that is,
x2y00 C Axy0 C .B C Cxq/y D 0;

where the constants A, B, C, and q are given by
A D 1  2˛;
B D ˛2  ˇ2p2;
C D ˇ2k2;
and
q D 2ˇ:

Under the assumption that the square roots in (5) are real, it follows that the general

y.x/ D x˛w.´/ D x˛w.kxˇ/;
where
w.´/ D c1Jp.´/ C c2Yp.´/
(assuming that p is not an integer) is the general solution of the Bessel equation in
(1). This establishes the following result.
THEOREM 1
Solutions in Bessel Functions
If C > 0, q 6D 0, and .1  A/2 = 4B, then the general solution (for x > 0) of

(6)
where ˛, ˇ, k, and p are given by the equations in (5). If p is an integer, then
Jp is to be replaced with Yp.

uniform vertical column will buckle under its own weight (after, perhaps, being
nudged laterally just a bit by a passing breeze). We take x D 0 at the free top end
of the column and x D L > 0 at its bottom; we assume that the bottom is rigidly
imbedded in the ground, perhaps in concrete; see Fig. 8.6.1. Denote the angular
deﬂection of the column at the point x by .x/. From the theory of elasticity it
follows that
EI d 2
dx2 C gx D 0;
(9)
where E is the Young’s modulus of the material of the column, I is its cross-
sectional moment of inertia,  is the linear density of the column, and g is gravita-
tional acceleration. For physical reasons—no bending at the free top of the column
and no deﬂection at its imbedded bottom—the boundary conditions are
0.0/ D 0;
.L/ D 0:
(10)
We will accept (9) and (10) as an appropriate statement of the problem and attempt
to solve it in this form. With

(12)
The column can buckle only if there is a nontrivial solution of (12); otherwise the
column will remain in its undeﬂected vertical position.
The differential equation in (12) is an Airy equation similar to the one in Ex-
ample 2. It has the form of Eq. (3) with A D B D 0, C D 2, and q D 3. The

agrees with Eq. (7). If Bessel functions other than those appearing in Eq. (7) are
involved, you may need to apply the identities in (26) and (27) of Section 8.5 to
transform the computer’s “answer” to (7). Then see whether your system can take

Now you should be able to use built-in Bessel functions to plot typical solution

Next, investigate similarly one of the other equations in (2) through (6). Each
has a general solution of the same general form in (7)—a quotient of linear com-
binations of Bessel functions. In addition to Jp.x/ and Yp.x/, these solutions may
involve the modiﬁed Bessel functions

Check these power series expansions using your computer algebra system—look at
BesselI in either Maple or Mathematica—and compare them with Eqs. (17) and
(18) in Section 8.5.
The second-order differential equations of the form y00 D f .x; y/ with the
same right-hand sides as in Eqs. (1) through (6) have interesting solutions which,
however, cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions and=or “known”
special functions such as Bessel functions. Nevertheless, they can be investigated
using an ODE plotter. For instance, the interesting pattern in Fig. 8.6.8 shows solu-
tion curves of the second-order equation
y00 D y2  x

with the same initial value y.0/ D 0 but different slopes y0.0/ D 3:3, 3:1, : : : ;

historically in the classiﬁcation of nonlinear second-order differential equations in
terms of their critical points (see Chapter 14 of E. L. Ince, Ordinary Differential
Equations, New York: Dover Publications, 1956). Figure 8.6.8 was suggested by
an article by Anne Noonburg containing a similar ﬁgure in the Spring 1993 issue of
the C

Show that Theorem 1 in this section explains the “Bessel part” of the alleged solu-
tion in Eq. (12). Can you explain where the rational function part comes from, or
at least verify it? For further examples of this sort, you can replace the coefﬁcient
99 in Eq. (13) with r2  1, where r is an even integer, and/or replace the x on the
right-hand side with xs, where s is an odd integer. (With parities other than these,
more exotic special functions are involved.)

Fourier Series Methods
and Partial Differential
Equations
9.1 Periodic Functions and Trigonometric Series
A
s motivation for the subject of Fourier series, we consider the differential
equation
d 2x
dt2 C !2
0x D f .t/;
(1)
which models the behavior of a mass-and-spring system with natural (circular) fre-
quency !0, moving under the inﬂuence of an external force of magnitude f .t/ per
unit mass. As we saw in Section 3.6, a particular solution of Eq. (1) can easily
be found by the method of undetermined coefﬁcients if f .t/ is a simple harmonic
function—a sine or cosine function. For instance, the equation
d 2x
dt2 C !2
0x D A cos !t
(2)
with !2 ¤ !2
0 has the particular solution
xp.t/ D
A
!2
0  !2 cos !t;
(3)
which is readily found by beginning with the trial solution xp.t/ D a cos !t.
Now suppose, more generally, that the force function f .t/ in Eq. (1) is a lin-
ear combination of simple harmonic functions. Then, on the basis of Eq. (3) and
the analogous formula with sine in place of cosine, we can apply the principle of
superposition to construct a particular solution of Eq. (1). For example, consider the
equation
d 2x

Mechanical (and electrical) systems often involve periodic forcing functions
that are not (simply) ﬁnite linear combinations of sines and cosines. Nevertheless,
as we will soon see, any reasonably nice periodic function f .t/ has a representation
as an inﬁnite series of trigonometric terms. This fact opens the way toward solving
Eq. (1) by superposition of trigonometric “building blocks,” with the ﬁnite sum in
Eq. (5) replaced with an inﬁnite series.
DEFINITION
Periodic Function
The function f .t/ deﬁned for all t is said to be periodic provided that there exists
a positive number p such that
f .t C p/ D f .t/
(6)
for all t. The number p is then called a period of the function f .
Note that the period of a periodic function is not unique; for example, if p is
a period of f .t/, then so are the numbers 2p, 3p, and so on. Indeed, every positive
number is a period of any constant function.
If there exists a smallest positive number P such that f .t/ is periodic with
period P , then we call P the period of f . For instance, the period of the functions
g.t/ D cos nt and h.t/ D sin nt (where n is a positive integer) is 2=n because
cos n


D cos.nt C 2/ D cos nt
and
(7)
sin n

t C 2
n

D sin.nt C 2/ D sin nt:
Moreover, 2 itself is a period of the functions g.t/ and h.t/. Ordinarily we will
have no need to refer to the smallest period of a function f .t/ and will simply say
that f .t/ has period p if p is any period of f .t/.
In Section 7.5 we saw several examples of piecewise continuous periodic func-
tions. For instance, the square-wave function having the graph shown in Fig. 9.1.1

has period 2.
Because g.t/ D cos nt and h.t/ D sin nt each have period 2, any linear
combination of sines and cosines of integral multiples of t, such as
f .t/ D 3 C cos t  sin t C 5 cos 2t C 17 sin 3t;
has period 2. But every such linear combination is continuous, so the square-
wave function cannot be expressed in such a manner. In his celebrated treatise

566
Chapter 9 Fourier Series Methods and Partial Differential Equations
The Analytic Theory of Heat (1822), the French scientist Joseph Fourier (1768–
1830) made the remarkable assertion that every function f .t/ with period 2 can be
represented by an inﬁnite trigonometric series of the form
a0
2 C
1
X
nD1
.an cos nt C bn sin nt/:
(8)
(The reason for writing 1
2a0 rather than a0 here will appear shortly—when we see
that a single formula for an thereby includes the case n D 0 as well as n > 0.) We
will see in Section 9.2 that under rather mild restrictions on the function f .t/, this
is so! An inﬁnite series of the form in (8) is called a Fourier series, and the repre-
sentation of functions by Fourier series is one of the most widely used techniques
in applied mathematics, especially for the solution of partial differential equations
(see Sections 9.5 through 9.7).
Fourier Series of Period 2 Functions
In this section we will conﬁne our attention to functions of period 2. We want to
determine what the coefﬁcients in the Fourier series in (8) must be if it is to converge
to a given function f .t/ of period 2. For this purpose we need the following
integrals, in which m and n denote positive integers (Problems 27 through 29):
Z 

cos mt cos nt dt D
(
0
if m ¤ n,

if m D n.
(9)
Z 

sin mt sin nt dt D
(
0
if m ¤ n,

if m D n.
(10)
Z 

cos mt sin nt dt D 0
for all m and n.
(11)
These formulas imply that the functions cos nt and sin nt for n D 1, 2, 3, : : : consti-
tute a mutually orthogonal set of functions on the interval Œ; . Two real-valued
functions u.t/ and v.t/ are said to be orthogonal on the interval Œa; b provided that
Z b
a
u.t/v.t/ dt D 0:
(12)
(The reason for the word “orthogonal” here is a certain interpretation of functions
as vectors with inﬁnitely many values or “components,” in which the integral of
the product of two functions plays the same role as the dot product of two ordinary
vectors; recall that u  v D 0 if and only if the two vectors are orthogonal.)
Suppose now that the piecewise continuous function f .t/ of period 2 has a
Fourier series representation
f .t/ D a0
2 C

X
mD1
.am cos mt C bm sin mt/;
(13)
in the sense that the inﬁnite series on the right converges to the value f .t/ for every
t. We assume in addition that, when the inﬁnite series in Eq. (13) is multiplied by

9.1 Periodic Functions and Trigonometric Series
567
any continuous function, the resulting series can be integrated term by term. Then
the result of termwise integration of Eq. (13) itself from t D  to t D  is

so the value of the coefﬁcient an is

(16)
Note that with n D 0, the formula in (16) reduces to Eq. (14); this explains why we
denote the constant term in the original Fourier series by 1
2a0 (rather than simply
a0). If we multiply each side in Eq. (13) by sin nt and then integrate termwise, we
ﬁnd in a similar way that
bn D 1

Z 

(Problem 31). In short, we have found that if the series in (13) converges to f .t/
and if the termwise integrations carried out here are valid, then the coefﬁcients in
the series must have the values given in Eqs. (16) and (17). This motivates us to
deﬁne the Fourier series of a periodic function by means of these formulas, whether
or not the resulting series converges to the function (or even converges at all).

You may recall that the Taylor series of a function sometimes fails to converge

condition f .t C 2/ D f .t/ for all t. We continue to denote this extension of the
original function by f , and note that it automatically has period 2. Its graph looks
the same on every interval of the form
.2n  1/ 5 t 5 .2n C 1/
where n is an integer (Fig. 9.1.2). For instance, the square-wave function of
Fig. 9.1.1 can be described as the period 2 function such that

Thus the square-wave function is the period 2 function deﬁned on one full period
by means of Eq. (20).
We need to consider Fourier series of piecewise continuous functions because
many functions that appear in applications are only piecewise continuous, not con-
tinuous. Note that the integrals in Eqs. (16) and (17) exist if f .t/ is piecewise
continuous, so every piecewise continuous function has a Fourier series.

Now let f .t/ be a function that is piecewise continuous for all t and has arbitrary
period P > 0. We write
P D 2L;
(1)
so L is the half-period of the function f . Let us deﬁne the function g as follows:

The Convergence Theorem
We want to impose conditions on the periodic function f that are enough to guar-
antee that its Fourier series actually converges to f .t/ at least at those values of t at
which f is continuous. Recall that the function f is said to be piecewise continuous
on the interval Œa; b provided that there is a ﬁnite partition of Œa; b with endpoints
a D t0 < t1 < t2 <    < tn1 < tn D b
such that
1. f is continuous on each open interval ti1 < t < ti; and
2. At each endpoint ti of such a subinterval the limit of f .t/, as t approaches ti
from within the subinterval, exists and is ﬁnite.
The function f is called piecewise continuous for all t if it is piecewise con-
tinuous on every bounded interval. It follows that a piecewise continuous function
is continuous except possibly at isolated points, and that at each such point of dis-
continuity, the one-sided limits
f .tC/ D lim
u!tC f .u/
and
f .t/ D lim
u!t f .u/
(12)
both exist and are ﬁnite. Thus a piecewise continuous function has only isolated
“ﬁnite jump” discontinuities like the one shown in Fig. 9.2.2.

The square-wave and sawtooth functions that we saw in Chapter 7 are typical
examples of periodic piecewise continuous functions. The function f .t/ D tan t
is a periodic function (of period ) that is not piecewise continuous because it has
inﬁnite discontinuities. The function g.t/ D sin.1=t/ is not piecewise continuous on
Œ1; 1 because its one-sided limits at t D 0 do not exist. The function

on Œ1; 1 has one-sided limits everywhere, but is not piecewise continuous because
its discontinuities are not isolated—it has the inﬁnite sequence f1=ng1
1 of disconti-
nuities; a piecewise continuous function can have only ﬁnitely many discontinuities
in any bounded interval.
Note that a piecewise continuous function need not be deﬁned at its isolated
points of discontinuity. Alternatively, it can be deﬁned arbitrarily at such points.
For instance, the square wave function f of Fig. 9.2.1 is piecewise continuous no
matter what its values might be at the points : : : , 4, 2, 0, 2, 4, 6, : : : at which it is
discontinuous. Its derivative f 0 is also piecewise continuous; f 0.t/ D 0 unless t is
an even integer, in which case f 0.t/ is undeﬁned.
The piecewise continuous function f is said to be piecewise smooth provided
that its derivative f 0 is piecewise continuous. Theorem 1 (next) tells us that the
Fourier series of a piecewise smooth function converges everywhere. More general
Fourier convergence theorems—with weaker hypotheses on the periodic function
f —are known. But the hypothesis that f is piecewise smooth is easy to check and
is satisﬁed by most functions encountered in practical applications. A proof of the
following theorem may be found in G. P. Tolstov, Fourier Series (New York: Dover,
1976).
THEOREM 1
Convergence of Fourier Series
Suppose that the periodic function f is piecewise smooth. Then its Fourier series
in (6) converges
(a) to the value f .t/ at each point where f is continuous, and
(b) to the value 1
2Œf .tC/ C f .t/ at each point where f is discontinuous.
Note that 1
2Œf .tC/ C f .t/ is the average of the right-hand and left-hand
limits of f at the point t. If f is continuous at t, then f .t/ D f .tC/ D f .t/, so
f .t/ D f .tC/ C f .t/
2
:
(13)
Hence Theorem 1 could be rephrased as follows: The Fourier series of a piecewise
smooth function f converges for every t to the average value in (13). For this reason
it is customary to write
f .t/ D a0

(14)
with the understanding that the piecewise smooth function f has been redeﬁned (if
necessary) at each of its points of discontinuity in order to satisfy the average value
condition in (13).

Example 2
Let f .t/ be a function of period 2 with f .t/ D t2 if 0 < t < 2. We deﬁne f .t/ for t an even
integer by the average value condition in (13); consequently, f .t/ D 2 if t is an even integer.
The graph of the function f appears in Fig. 9.2.3. Find its Fourier series.

Remark: If you succeed in expressing the sum of this

stance, as a rational multiple of 3 similar to Euler’s sum
in part (a)—you will win great fame for yourself, for many
have tried without success over the past two centuries
since Euler. Indeed, it was not until 1979 that the sum
of the inverse-cube series was proved to be an irrational
number (as long suspected).
9.2 Application Computer Algebra Calculation of Fourier Coefﬁcients
A computer algebra system can greatly ease the burden of calculation of the Fourier
coefﬁcients of a given function f .t/. In the case of a function that is deﬁned “piece-
wise,” we must take care to “split” the integral according to the different intervals
of deﬁnition of the function. We illustrate the method by deriving the Fourier series
of the period 2 square-wave function deﬁned on .; / by
f .t/ D
(
1
if
 < t < 0,
C1
if
0 < t < .
(1)
In this case the function is deﬁned by different formulas on two different intervals,
so each Fourier coefﬁcient integral from  to  must be calculated as the sum of
two integrals:
an D 1

Z 0

.1/ cos nt dt C 1

.C1/ cos nt dt;
bn D 1

Z 0

.1/ sin nt dt C 1

Z 
0
.C1/ sin nt dt:
(2)
We can deﬁne the coefﬁcients in (2) as functions of n by the Maple commands
a := n > (1/Pi)(int(--cos(nt), t=--Pi..0) +
int(+cos(nt), t=0..Pi)):
b := n > (1/Pi)(int(--sin(nt), t=--Pi..0) +
int(+sin(nt), t=0..Pi)):
or by the Mathematica commands
a[n ] := (1/Pi)(Integrate[--Cos[nt], {t, --Pi, 0}] +
Integrate[+Cos[nt], {t, 0, Pi}])
b[n ] := (1/Pi)(Integrate[--Sin[nt], {t, --Pi, 0}] +
Integrate[+Sin[nt], {t, 0, Pi}])
Because the function f .t/ in Eq. (1) is odd, we naturally ﬁnd that an  0. Hence
the Maple commands

Chapter 9 Fourier Series Methods and Partial Differential Equations
fourierSum := sum(b(n)sin(nt), n=1..9);

and generate a graph like one of those in Fig. 9.1.3. The corresponding MATLAB
commands are entirely analogous and can be found in the applications manual that
accompanies this text.
To practice the symbolic derivation of Fourier series in this manner, you can
begin by verifying the Fourier series calculated manually in Examples 1 and 2 of
this section. Then Problems 1 through 21 are fair game. Finally, the period 2
triangular wave and trapezoidal wave functions illustrated in Figs. 9.2.4 and 9.2.5
have especially interesting Fourier series that we invite you to discover for yourself.

9.3 Fourier Sine and Cosine Series
Certain properties of functions are reﬂected prominently in their Fourier series. The
function f deﬁned for all t is said to be even if
f .t/ D f .t/
(1)
for all t; f is odd if
f .t/ D f .t/
(2)
for all t. The ﬁrst condition implies that the graph of y D f .t/ is symmetric with
respect to the y-axis, whereas the condition in (2) implies that the graph of an odd
function is symmetric with respect to the origin (see Fig. 9.3.1). The functions
f .t/ D t2n (with n an integer) and g.t/ D cos t are even functions, whereas the
functions f .t/ D t2nC1 and g.t/ D sin t are odd. We will see that the Fourier series
of an even periodic function has only cosine terms and that the Fourier series of an
odd periodic function has only sine terms.

FIGURE 9.3.2.
Area under the graph of (a) an even function and (b) an odd.
Addition and cancellation of areas as indicated in Fig. 9.3.2 reminds us of
the following basic facts about integrals of even and odd functions over an interval
Œa; a that is symmetric around the origin.
If f is even:
Z a
a
f .t/ dt D 2
Z a
0
f .t/ dt:
(3)
If f is odd:
Z a
a
f .t/ dt D 0:
(4)
These facts are easy to verify analytically (Problem 17).
It follows immediately from Eqs. (1) and (2) that the product of two even
functions is even, as is the product of two odd functions; the product of an even
function and an odd function is odd. In particular, if f .t/ is an even periodic function
of period 2L, then f .t/ cos.nt=L/ is even, whereas f .t/ sin.nt=L/ is odd, because
the cosine function is even and the sine function is odd. When we compute the
Fourier coefﬁcients of f , we therefore get

Even and Odd Extensions
In all our earlier discussion and examples, we began with a periodic function de-
ﬁned for all t; the Fourier series of such a function is uniquely determined by the
Fourier coefﬁcient formulas. In many practical situations, however, we begin with
a function f deﬁned only on an interval of the form 0 < t < L, and we want to
represent its values on this interval by a Fourier series of period 2L. The ﬁrst step
is the necessary extension of f to the interval L < t < 0. Granted this, we may
extend f to the entire real line by the periodicity condition f .t C 2L/ D f .t/ (and
use the average value property should any discontinuities arise). But how we deﬁne
f for L < t < 0 is our choice, and the Fourier series representation for f .t/ on
.0; L/ that we obtain will depend on that choice. Speciﬁcally, different choices of
the extension of f to the interval .L; 0/ will yield different Fourier series that con-
verge to the same function f .t/ in the original interval 0 < t < L, but converge to
the different extensions of f on the interval L < t < 0.
In practice, given f .t/ deﬁned for 0 < t < L, we generally make one of two
natural choices—we extend f in such a way as to obtain either an even function or
an odd function on the whole real line. The even period 2L extension of f is the
function fE deﬁned as
fE.t/ D
(
f .t/
if
0 < t < L,
f .t/
if L < t < 0
(9)
and by fE.t C 2L/ D fE.t/ for all t. The odd period 2L extension of f is the
function fO deﬁned as
fO.t/ D
(
f .t/
if
0 < t < L,
f .t/
if L < t < 0
(10)

9.3 Fourier Sine and Cosine Series
583
and by fO.t C 2L/ D fO.t/ for all t. The values of fE or fO for t an integral multiple
of L can be deﬁned in any convenient way we wish, because these isolated values
cannot affect the Fourier series of the extensions we get. As suggested by Fig. 9.3.1,
it frequently sufﬁces simply to visualize the graph of fE on .L; 0/ as the reﬂection
in the vertical axis of the original graph of f on .0; L/, and the graph of fO on
.L; 0/ as the reﬂection in the origin of the original graph.
For instance, if f .t/ D 2t  t2 on the interval 0 < t < 2 (so L D 2), then (9)
and (10) yield

The Fourier series of the even extension fE of the function f , given by Eqs. (5)
and (6), will contain only cosine terms and is called the Fourier cosine series of the
original function f . The Fourier series of the odd extension fO, given by Eqs. (7)
and (8), will contain only sine terms and is called the Fourier sine series of f .

t in the interval 0 < t < L. Outside this interval, the cosine series in (11) converges
to the even period 2L extension of f , whereas the sine series in (13) converges to
the odd period 2L extension of f . In many cases of interest we have no concern
with the values of f outside the original interval .0; L/, and therefore the choice

sine series to represent a given function.)

Termwise Differentiation of Fourier Series
In this and in subsequent sections, we want to consider Fourier series as possible
solutions of differential equations. In order to substitute a Fourier series for the
unknown dependent variable in a differential equation to check whether it is a so-
lution, we ﬁrst need to differentiate the series in order to compute the derivatives
that appear in the equation. Care is required here; term-by-term differentiation of
an inﬁnite series of variable terms is not always valid. Theorem 1 gives sufﬁcient
conditions for the validity of termwise differentiation of a Fourier series.

9.3 Fourier Sine and Cosine Series
585
THEOREM 1
Termwise Differentiation of Fourier Series
Suppose that the function f is continuous for all t, periodic with period 2L, and
that its derivative f 0 is piecewise smooth for all t. Then the Fourier series of f 0
is the series

Proof:
The point of the theorem is that the differentiated series in Eq. (17)
actually converges to f 0.t/ (with the usual proviso about average values). But be-
cause f 0 is periodic and piecewise smooth, we know from Theorem 1 of Section
9.2 that the Fourier series of f 0 converges to f 0.t/:

In order to prove Theorem 1, it therefore sufﬁces to show that the series in Eqs. (17)

continuous everywhere. Then

Similarly, we ﬁnd that

and therefore the series in Eqs. (17) and (19) are, indeed, identical.
Whereas the assumption that the derivative f 0 is continuous is merely a con-
venience—the proof of Theorem 1 can be strengthened to allow isolated discontinu-
ities in f 0—it is important to note that the conclusion of Theorem 1 generally fails
when f itself is discontinuous. For example, consider the Fourier series

L < t < L, of the discontinuous sawtooth function having the graph shown in

of f , and f has only isolated jump discontinuities. But the series

By contrast, consider the (continuous) triangular wave function f .t/ having
the graph shown in Fig. 9.3.4, with f .t/ D jtj for L < t < L. This function
satisﬁes all the hypotheses of Theorem 1, so its Fourier series

Fourier Series Solutions of Differential Equations
In the remainder of this chapter and in Chapter 10, we will frequently need to solve
endpoint value problems of the general form
ax00 C bx0 C cx D f .t/
.0 < t < L/I
(22)
x.0/ D x.L/ D 0;
(23)
where the function f .t/ is given. Of course, we might consider applying the tech-
niques of Chapter 3, solving the problem by
1. First ﬁnding the general solution xc D c1x1 C c2x2 of the associated homoge-
neous differential equation;
2. Then ﬁnding a single particular solution xp of the nonhomogeneous equation
in (22); and
3. Finally, determining the constants c1 and c2 so that x D xc C xp satisﬁes the
endpoint conditions in (23).
In many problems, however, the following Fourier series method is more con-
venient and more useful. We ﬁrst extend the deﬁnition of the function f .t/ to the
interval L < t < 0 in an appropriate way, and then to the entire real line by the
periodicity conditions f .t C 2L/ D f .t/. Then the function f , if piecewise smooth,
has a Fourier series

that may validly be differentiated twice termwise. We attempt to determine the
coefﬁcients in Eq. (25) by ﬁrst substituting the series in Eqs. (24) and (25) into the
differential equation in (22) and then equating coefﬁcients of like terms—much as
in the ordinary method of undetermined coefﬁcients (Section 3.5), except that now
we have inﬁnitely many coefﬁcients to determine. If this procedure is carried out in
such a way that the resulting series in Eq. (25) also satisﬁes the endpoint conditions
in (23), then we have a “formal Fourier series solution” of the original endpoint
value problem; that is, a solution subject to veriﬁcation of the assumed termwise
differentiability. Example 2 illustrates this process.

Solution
Here f .t/ D 4t for 0 < t < 1. A crucial ﬁrst step—which we did not make explicit in the
preceding outline—is to choose a periodic extension f .t/ so that each term in its Fourier
series satisﬁes the endpoint conditions in (27). For this purpose we choose the odd period
2 extension, because each term of the form sin nt satisﬁes (27). Then from the series in
Eq. (16) with L D 1, we get the Fourier series

function can always be integrated term by term, whether or not it converges! A

9.3 Application Fourier Series of Piecewise Smooth Functions
Most computer algebra systems permit the use of unit step functions for the efﬁcient
derivation of Fourier series of “piecewise-deﬁned” functions. Here we illustrate the
use of Maple for this purpose. Mathematica and MATLAB versions can be found in
the applications manual that accompanies this text.
Let the “unit function” unit.t; a; b/ have the value 1 on the interval a 5 t < b
and the value 0 otherwise. Then we can deﬁne a given piecewise smooth function

f .t/ as a “linear combination” of different unit functions corresponding to the sepa-
rate intervals on which the function is smooth, with the unit function for each inter-
val multiplied by the formula deﬁning f .t/ on that interval. For example, consider
the even period 2 function whose graph is shown in Fig. 9.3.8. This “trapezoidal
wave function” is deﬁned for 0 < t <  by

The unit step function (with values 0 for t < 0 and 1 for t > 0) is available in Maple
as the “Heaviside function.” For instance, Heaviside.2/ D 0 and Heaviside.3/ D 1.
The unit function on the interval Œa; b can be deﬁned by
unit := (t,a,b) > Heaviside(t--a) -- Heaviside(t--b):
Then the trapezoidal--wave function in Eq. (1) is deﬁned for 0 5 t 5  by

(Pi/2 -- t)unit(t, Pi/6, 5Pi/6) +

constant k under the inﬂuence of a periodic external force F.t/, as indicated in
Fig. 9.4.1. Its displacement x.t/ from equilibrium satisﬁes the familiar equation

k=m is the natural frequency of the system and xp.t/ is a particular
solution of Eq. (1). The values c1 and c2 would be determined by the initial con-
ditions. Here we want to use Fourier series to ﬁnd a periodic particular solution of
Eq. (1). We will denote it by xsp.t/ and call it a steady periodic solution.

equation x00 C 16x D 0. Hence the general solution is of the form
x.t/ D A cos 4t C B sin 4t C xsp.t/
and thus is a sum of periodic functions with periods 2 and 2=4 D =2 unless A D
B D 0. Because numerical calculation gives xsp.0/ D 0 and x0
sp.0/  2:7314, the
two period =2 terms both drop out—leaving the period 2 solution xsp.t/—only with
these particular initial values of x.0/ and x0.0/. With any other initial conditions,
either A or B (or both) is nonzero, and the corresponding solution is a superposition
of two oscillations whose periods have an irrational ratio (see Problems 19 and 20).
For instance, Fig. 9.4.4 shows the graphs of the periodic solution xsp.t/ and the
solution x.t/ that satisﬁes the initial conditions x.0/ D 2 and x0.0/ D 0 and appears

If there is a nonzero term BN sin.Nt=L/ in the Fourier series solution of the force
function F.t/ in Eq. (1) for which N=L D !0, then this term causes pure reso-

Damped Forced Oscillations
Now we consider the motion of a mass m attached both to a spring with Hooke’s
constant k and to a dashpot with damping constant c, under the inﬂuence of a pe-
riodic external force F.t/ (Fig. 9.4.6). The displacement x.t/ of the mass from
equilibrium satisﬁes the equation

Because the coefﬁcient corresponding to n D 3 is much larger than the others, the response of
this system is approximately a sinusoidal motion with frequency three times that of the input
force. Figure 9.4.7 shows xsp.t/ in comparison with the scaled force 10F.t/=k that has the

FIGURE 9.4.7.
The imposed force
and the resulting steady periodic

What is happening here is this: The mass m D 3 on a spring with k D 27 has (if we
ignore the small effect of the dashpot) a natural frequency !0 D
p
k=m D 3 rad=s. The im-
posed external force F.t/ has a (smallest) period of 2 s and hence a fundamental frequency
of 1 rad=s. Consequently, the term corresponding to n D 3 in the Fourier series of F.t/ (in
Eq. (17)) has the same frequency as the natural frequency of the system. Thus near resonance
vibrations occur, with the mass completing essentially three oscillations for every single os-
cillation of the external force. This is the physical effect of the dominant n D 3 term on the
right-hand side in Eq. (20). For instance, you can push a friend in a swing quite high even
if you push the swing only every third time it returns to you. This also explains why some
transformers “hum” at a frequency much higher than 60 Hz.
This is a general phenomenon that must be taken into account in the design of mechan-
ical systems. To avoid the occurrence of abnormally large and potentially destructive near
resonance vibrations, the system must be so designed that it is not subject to any external
periodic force, some integral multiple of whose fundamental frequency is close to a natural
frequency of vibration.

Example 1
Finally, let us add to the mass–spring system of Example 1 a dashpot with damping constant
c D 3 N/m/s. Then, since m D 2 and k D 32, the differential equation satisﬁed by the mass’s
displacement function x.t/ is now
2x00 C 3x0 C 32x D F.t/;
(21)
where F.t/ is the periodic force function deﬁned in Eq. (5). Figure 9.4.8 shows graphs of
both the steady periodic solution xsp.t/ for the original undamped system of Example 1 and

a numerically calculated solution of Eq. (21) with initial conditions x.0/ D 2 and x0.0/ D
1. As an initial transient solution determined by the initial conditions dies out, it appears
that the damped solution x.t/ converges to a steady periodic solution of (21). However, we
observe two evident effects of the damping—the amplitude of the steady periodic oscillation
is decreased, and the damped steady oscillations lag behind the undamped steady oscillations.

9.5 Heat Conduction and Separation of Variables
The most important applications of Fourier series are to the solution of partial differ-
ential equations by means of the method of separation of variables that we introduce
in this section. Recall that a partial differential equation is one containing one or
more partial derivatives of a dependent variable that is a function of at least two

598
Chapter 9 Fourier Series Methods and Partial Differential Equations
independent variables. An example is the one-dimensional heat equation
@u
@t D k @2u
@x2 ;
(1)
in which the dependent variable u is an unknown function of x and t, and k is a
given positive constant.
The Heated Rod
Equation (1) models the variation of temperature u with position x and time t in a
heated rod that extends along the x-axis. We assume that the rod has uniform cross
section with area A perpendicular to the axis and that it is made of a homogeneous
material. We assume further that the cross section of the rod is so small that u is
constant on each cross section, and that the lateral surface of the rod is insulated so
that no heat can pass through it. Then u will, indeed, be a function of x and t, and
heat will ﬂow along the rod in only the x-direction. In general, we envision heat as
ﬂowing like a ﬂuid from the warmer to the cooler parts of a body.
The heat ﬂux .x; t/ in the rod is the rate of ﬂow of heat (in the positive x-
direction) at time t across a unit area of the rod’s cross section at x. Typical units for
 are calories (of heat) per second per square centimeter (of area). The derivation
of Eq. (1) is based on the empirical principle that
 D K @u
@x ;
(2)
where the positive proportionality constant K is called the thermal conductivity
of the material of the rod. Note that if ux > 0, then  < 0, meaning that heat is
ﬂowing in the negative x-direction, while if ux < 0, then  > 0, so heat is ﬂowing in
the positive x-direction. Thus the rate of heat ﬂow is proportional to juxj, and the
direction of heat ﬂow is in the direction along the rod in which the temperature u is
decreasing. In short, heat ﬂows from a warm place to a cool place, not vice versa.
Now consider a small segment of the rod corresponding to the interval Œx; x C
x, as shown in Fig. 9.5.1. The rate of ﬂow R (in calories per second) of heat into

this segment through its two ends is

(3)
The resulting time rate of change ut of the temperature in the segment depends
on its density ı (grams per cubic centimeter) and speciﬁc heat c (both assumed
constant). The speciﬁc heat c is the amount of heat (in calories) required to raise by
1ı (Celsius) the temperature of 1 g of material. Consequently cıu calories of heat
are required to raise 1 cm3 of the material from temperature zero to temperature u.
A short slice of the rod of length dx has volume A dx, so cıuA dx calories of heat
are required to raise the temperature of this slice from 0 to u. The heat content

of the segment Œx; x C x of the rod is the amount of heat needed to raise it from

is the thermal diffusivity of the material. We now take the limit as x ! 0, so
x ! x (because x lies in the interval Œx; x C x with ﬁxed left endpoint x). Then
the two sides of the equation in (8) approach the two sides of the one-dimensional
heat equation
@u
@t D k @2u
@x2 :
(1)
Thus the temperature u.x; t/ in the thin rod with insulated sides must satisfy this
partial differential equation.
Boundary Conditions
Now suppose that the rod has ﬁnite length L, extending from x D 0 to x D L.
Its temperature function u.x; t/ will be determined among all possible solutions
of Eq. (1) by appropriate subsidiary conditions. In fact, whereas a solution of an
ordinary differential equation involves arbitrary constants, a solution of a partial
differential equation generally involves arbitrary functions. In the case of the heated
rod, we can specify its temperature function f .x/ at time t D 0. This gives the initial
condition
u.x; 0/ D f .x/:
(10)
We may also specify ﬁxed temperatures at the two ends of the rod. For instance, if
each end were clamped against a large block of ice at temperature zero, we would
have the endpoint conditions
u.0; t/ D u.L; t/ D 0
(for all t > 0):
(11)
Combining all this, we get the boundary value problem

in (12): We are to ﬁnd a function u.x; t/ that is continuous on the unbounded strip
(including its boundary) shaded in the xt-plane. This function must satisfy the
differential equation in (12a) at each interior point of the strip, and on the boundary
of the strip must have the values prescribed by the boundary conditions in (12b) and
(12c). Physical intuition suggests that if f .x/ is a reasonable function, then there
will exist one and only one such function u.x; t/.
Instead of having ﬁxed temperatures, the two ends of the rod might be insu-
lated. In this case no heat would ﬂow through either end, so we see from Eq. (2)
that the conditions in (12b) would be replaced in the boundary value problem by the
endpoint conditions
ux.0; t/ D ux.L; t/ D 0
(13)
(for all t). Alternatively, the rod could be insulated at one end and have a ﬁxed
temperature at the other. This and other endpoint possibilities are discussed in the
Problems.
Superposition of Solutions
Note that the heat equation in (12a) is linear.
That is, any linear combination
u D c1u1 C c2u2 of two solutions of (12a) is also a solution of (12a); this fol-
lows immediately from the linearity of partial differentiation. It is also true that if
u1 and u2 each satisfy the conditions in (12b), then so does any linear combina-
tion u D c1u1 C c2u2. The conditions in (12b) are therefore called homogeneous
boundary conditions (though a more descriptive term might be linear boundary con-
ditions). By contrast, the ﬁnal boundary condition in (12c) is not homogeneous; it
is a nonhomogeneous boundary condition.
Our overall strategy for solving the boundary value problem in (12) will be
to ﬁnd functions u1, u2, u3, : : : that satisfy both the partial differential equation in
(12a) and the homogeneous boundary conditions in (12b), and then attempt to com-
bine these functions by superposition, as if they were building blocks, in the hope
of obtaining a solution u D c1u1 C c2u2 C    that satisﬁes the nonhomogeneous
condition in (12c) as well. Example 1 illustrates this approach.

satisﬁes both the differential equation in (14a) and the homogeneous conditions in (14b).
Because

9.5 Heat Conduction and Separation of Variables

we see that we can also satisfy the nonhomogeneous condition in (14c) simply by choosing
c1 D 60, c2 D 0, and c3 D 20. Thus a solution of the given boundary value problem is
u.x; t/ D 60et sin x  20e9t sin 3x:
The boundary value problem in Example 1 is exceptionally simple in that only
a ﬁnite number of homogeneous solutions are needed to satisfy by superposition the
nonhomogeneous boundary condition. It is more usual that an inﬁnite sequence u1,
u2, u3, : : : of functions satisfying (12a) and (12b) is required. If so, we write the

must be veriﬁed to ensure that we have a solution of the boundary value problem in

L and t = 0, and by the boundary conditions in (12b) and (12c) on its
boundary, is continuous.
Then u.x; t/ is a solution of the boundary value problem in (12).
In the method of separation of variables described next, we concentrate on
ﬁnding the solutions u1, u2, u3, : : : satisfying the homogeneous conditions and on
determining the coefﬁcients so that the series in Eq. (15) satisﬁes the nonhomoge-
neous conditions upon substitution of t D 0. At this point we have only a formal
series solution of the boundary value problem—one that is subject to veriﬁcation of
the continuity and differentiability conditions given in part (1) of the superposition
principle stated here. If the function f .x/ in (12c) is piecewise smooth, it can be
proved that a formal series solution always satisﬁes the restrictions and, moreover,
is the unique solution of the boundary value problem. For a proof, see the chapter
on boundary value problems in R. V. Churchill and J. W. Brown, Fourier Series and
Boundary Value Problems, 8th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011).
Separation of Variables
This method of solving the boundary value problem in (12) for the heated rod was
introduced by Fourier in his study of heat cited in Section 9.1. We ﬁrst search
for the building block functions u1, u2, u3, : : : that satisfy the differential equation

602
Chapter 9 Fourier Series Methods and Partial Differential Equations
ut D kuxx and the homogeneous conditions u.0; t/ D u.L; t/ D 0, with each of
these functions being of the special form
u.x; t/ D X.x/T .t/
(16)
in which the variables are “separated”—that is, each of the building-block functions
is a product of a function of position x (only) and a function of time t (only). Sub-
stitution of (16) in ut D kuxx yields XT 0 D kX00T , where for brevity we write T 0
for T 0.t/ and X00 for X00.x/. Division of both sides by kXT then gives
X00
X D T 0
kT :
(17)
The left-hand side of Eq. (17) is a function of x alone, but the right-hand side is a
function of t alone. If t is held constant on the right-hand side, then the left-hand
side X00=X must remain constant as x varies. Similarly, if x is held constant on
the left-hand side, then the right-hand side T 0=kT must remain constant as t varies.
Consequently, equality can hold only if each of these two expressions is the same
constant, which for convenience we denote by . Thus Eq. (17) becomes
X00
X
D T 0
kT D ;
(18)
which consists of the two equations
X00.x/ C X.x/ D 0;
(19)
T 0.t/ C kT .t/ D 0:
(20)
It follows that the product function u.x; t/ D X.x/T .t/ satisﬁes the partial differen-
tial equation ut D kuxx if X.x/ and T .t/ separately satisfy the ordinary differential
equations in (19) and (20) for some (common) value of the constant .
We focus ﬁrst on X.x/. The homogeneous endpoint conditions are
u.x; 0/ D X.0/T .t/ D 0;
u.L; t/ D X.L/T .t/ D 0:
(21)
If T .t/ is to be a nontrivial function of t, then (21) can hold only if X.0/ D X.L/ D 0.
Thus X.x/ must satisfy the endpoint value problem
X00 C X D 0;
X.0/ D 0;
X.L/ D 0:
(22)
This is actually an eigenvalue problem of the type we discussed in Section 3.8.
Indeed, we saw in Example 3 of that section that (22) has a nontrivial solution if
and only if  is one of the eigenvalues
n D n22

n D 1; 2; 3; : : : ;
(23)

n D 1; 2; 3; : : : :
(24)

9.5 Heat Conduction and Separation of Variables
603
Recall that the reasoning behind (23) and (24) is as follows. If  D 0, then
(22) obviously implies that X.x/  0. If  D ˛2 < 0, then
X.x/ D A cosh ˛x C B sinh ˛x;
and then the conditions X.0/ D 0 D X.L/ imply that A D B D 0. Hence the only
possibility for a nontrivial eigenfunction is that  D ˛2 > 0. Then
X.x/ D A cos ˛x C B sin ˛x;
and the conditions X.0/ D 0 D X.L/ then imply that A D 0 and that ˛ D n=L
for some positive integer n. (Whenever separation of variables leads to an unfa-
miliar eigenvalue problem, we generally must consider separately the cases  D 0,
 D ˛2 < 0, and  D ˛2 > 0.)
Now we turn our attention to Eq. (20), knowing that the constant  must be
one of the eigenvalues listed in (23). For the nth of these possibilities we write
Eq. (20) as
T 0
n C n22k
L2
Tn D 0;
(25)
in anticipation of a different solution Tn.t/ for each different positive integer n. A
nontrivial solution of this equation is
Tn.t/ D exp

n22kt=L2	
:
(26)
We omit the arbitrary constant of integration because it will (in effect) be inserted
later.
To summarize our progress, we have discovered the two associated sequences
fXng1
1 and fTng1

of functions given in (24) and (26). Together they yield the
sequence of building-block product functions

tions (superposition) to attempt to satisfy the nonhomogeneous condition u.x; 0/ D

atures has the formal series solution

Remark By taking the limit in (31) termwise as t ! 1, we get u.x; 1/  0, as we expect
because the two ends of the rod are held at temperature zero.
The series solution in Eq. (31) usually converges quite rapidly, unless t is very
small, because of the presence of the negative exponential factors. Therefore it is
practical for numerical computations. For use in problems and examples, values of
the thermal diffusivity constant k for some common materials are listed in the table
in Fig. 9.5.3.

Suppose that a rod of length L D 50 cm is immersed in steam until its temperature is u0 D
100ıC throughout. At time t D 0, its lateral surface is insulated and its two ends are imbedded
in ice at 0ıC. Calculate the rod’s temperature at its midpoint after half an hour if it is made
of (a) iron; (b) concrete.

which corresponds to a rod of length L with initial temperature f .x/, but with its
two ends insulated. The separation of variables u.x; t/ D X.x/T .t/ proceeds as in
Eqs. (16) through (20) without change. But the homogeneous endpoint conditions in
(32b) yield X0.0/ D X0.L/ D 0. Thus X.x/ must satisfy the endpoint value problem
X00 C X D 0I
X0.0/ D 0;
X0.L/ D 0:
(33)
We must again consider separately the possibilities  D 0,  D ˛2 < 0, and  D
˛2 > 0 for the eigenvalues.

606
Chapter 9 Fourier Series Methods and Partial Differential Equations
With  D 0, the general solution of X00 D 0 is X.x/ D Ax C B, so X0.x/ D
A. Hence the endpoint conditions in (33) require A D 0, but B may be nonzero.
Because a constant multiple of an eigenfunction is an eigenfunction, we can choose
any constant value we wish for B. Thus, with B D 1, we have the zero eigenvalue
and associated eigenfunction
0 D 0;
X0.x/  1:
(34)
With  D 0 in Eq. (20), we get T 0.t/ D 0, so we may take T0.t/  1 as well.
With  D ˛2 < 0, the general solution of the equation X00  ˛2X D 0 is
X.x/ D A cosh ˛x C B sinh ˛x;
and we readily verify that X0.0/ D X0.L/ D 0 only if A D B D 0. Thus there are no
negative eigenvalues.
With  D ˛2 > 0, the general solution of X00 C ˛2X D 0 is
X.x/ D A cos ˛x C B sin ˛x;
X0.x/ D A˛ sin ˛x C B˛ cos ˛x:
Hence X0.0/ D 0 implies that B D 0, and then
X0.L/ D A˛ sin ˛L D 0
requires that ˛L be an integral multiple of , because ˛ ¤ 0 and A ¤ 0 if we are
to have a nontrivial solution. Thus we have the inﬁnite sequence of eigenvalues and
associated eigenfunctions

out” as the heat in the rod is redistributed with increasing t.
Finally, we point out that, although we set up the boundary value problems in
(12) and (32) for a rod of length L, they also model the temperature u.x; t/ within
the inﬁnite slab 0 5 x 5 L in three-dimensional space if its initial temperature f .x/

both held at temperature zero.

nies this text. As a practical matter, N D 50 terms sufﬁce to give the value u.x; t/
after 10 seconds (or longer) with two decimal places of accuracy throughout the
interval 0 5 x 5 50. (How might you check this assertion?)
The graph of u.x; 30/ in Fig. 9.5.7 shows that after 30 seconds the rod has
cooled appreciably only near its two ends and still has temperature near 100ıC for
10 5 x 5 40. Figure 9.5.8 shows the graph of u.x; 1800/ after 30 minutes and
illustrates the fact (?) that the rod’s maximum temperature is always at its midpoint,
where x D 25.
The graph of u.25; t/ for a two-hour period shown in Fig. 9.5.9 indicates that
the midpoint temperature takes something more than 1500 seconds (25 minutes) to
fall to 50ı. Figure 9.5.10 shows a magniﬁcation of the graph near its intersection
point with the horizontal line u D 50 and indicates that this actually takes about
1578 seconds (26 min 18 s).

9.6 Vibrating Strings and the One-Dimensional Wave Equation
Although Fourier systematized the method of separation of variables, trigonometric
series solutions of partial differential equations had appeared earlier in 18th-century
investigations of vibrating strings by Euler, d’Alembert, and Daniel Bernoulli. To
derive the partial differential equation that models the vibrations of a string, we
begin with a ﬂexible uniform string with linear density  (in grams per centimeter
or slugs per foot) stretched under a tension of T (dynes or pounds) between the
ﬁxed points x D 0 and x D L. Suppose that, as the string vibrates in the xy-plane
around its equilibrium position, each point moves parallel to the y-axis, so we can
denote by y.x; t/ the displacement at time t of the point x of the string. Then, for
any ﬁxed value of t, the shape of the string at time t is the curve y D y.x; t/. We

612
Chapter 9 Fourier Series Methods and Partial Differential Equations
assume also that the deﬂection of the string remains so slight that the approximation
sin   tan  D yx.x; t/ is quite accurate (Fig. 9.6.1). Finally, we assume that in

addition to the internal forces of tension acting tangentially to the string, it is acted
on by an external vertical force with linear density F.x/ in such units as dynes per
centimeter or pounds per foot.
We want to apply Newton’s second law F D ma to the short segment of string
of mass x corresponding to the interval Œx; x C x, with a being the vertical
acceleration ytt.x; t/ of its midpoint. Reading the vertical components of the force
shown in Fig. 9.6.1, we get

so division by x yields
ytt.x; t/  T yx.x C x; t/  yx.x; t/

We now take limits in this equation as x ! 0, so x ! x (because x lies in the
interval Œx; x C x with ﬁxed left endpoint x). Then the two sides of the equation
approach the two sides of the partial differential equation

Our intuition about the physics of the situation suggests that the motion of the string
will be determined if we specify both its initial position function

(5)
and its initial velocity function
yt.x; 0/ D g.x/
.0 < x < L/:

Solution by Separation of Variables
Like the heat equation, the wave equation in (7a) is linear: Any linear combination
of two solutions is again a solution. Another similarity is that the endpoint condi-
tions in (7b) are homogeneous. Unfortunately, the conditions in both (7c) and (7d)
are nonhomogeneous; we must deal with two nonhomogeneous boundary condi-
tions.
As we described in Section 9.5, the method of separation of variables involves
superposition of solutions satisfying the homogeneous conditions to obtain a solu-
tion that also satisﬁes a single nonhomogeneous boundary condition. To adapt the
technique to the situation at hand, we adopt the “divide and conquer” strategy of
splitting the problem in (7) into the following two separate boundary value prob-
lems, each involving only a single nonhomogeneous boundary condition:
Problem A
Problem B
ytt D a2yxx;
y.0; t/ D y.L; t/ D 0,
y.x; 0/ D f .x/,
yt.x; 0/ D 0.
ytt D a2yxx;
y.0; t/ D y.L; t/ D 0;
y.x; 0/ D 0,
yt.x; 0/ D g.x/.
If we can separately ﬁnd a solution yA.x; t/ of Problem A and a solution yB.x; t/
of Problem B, then their sum y.x; t/ D yA.x; t/ C yB.x; t/ will be a solution of the
original problem in (7), because
y.x; 0/ D yA.x; 0/ C yB.x; 0/ D f .x/ C 0 D f .x/
and
yt.x; 0/ D fyAgt.x; 0/ C fyBgt.x; 0/ D 0 C g.x/ D g.x/:
So let us attack Problem A with the method of separation of variables. Substi-
tution of
y.x; t/ D X.x/T .t/
(8)
in ytt D a2yxx yields XT 00 D a2X00T , where (as before) we write X00 for X00.x/ and
T 00 for T 00.t/. Therefore,
X00
X D T 00
a2T :
(9)

614
Chapter 9 Fourier Series Methods and Partial Differential Equations
The functions X00=X of x and T 00=a2T of t can agree for all x and t only if each is
equal to the same constant. Consequently, we may conclude that
X00
X D T 00
a2T D 
(10)
for some constant ; the minus sign is inserted here merely to facilitate recognition
of the eigenvalue problem in (13). Thus our partial differential equation separates
into the two ordinary differential equations
X00 C X D 0;
(11)
T 00 C a2T D 0:
(12)
The endpoint conditions
y.0; t/ D X.0/T .t/ D 0;
y.L; t/ D X.L/T .t/ D 0
require that X.0/ D X.L/ D 0 if T .t/ is nontrivial. Hence X.x/ must satisfy the now
familiar eigenvalue problem
X00 C X D 0;
X.0/ D X.L/ D 0:
(13)
As in Eqs. (23) and (24) of Section 9.5, the eigenvalues of this problem are the
numbers
n D n22
L2 ;
n D 1; 2; 3; : : : ;
(14)
and the eigenfunction associated with n is
Xn.x/ D sin nx
L ;
n D 1; 2; 3; : : : :
(15)
Now we turn to Eq. (12). The homogeneous initial condition
yt.x; 0/ D X.x/T 0.0/ D 0
implies that T 0.0/ D 0. Therefore, the solution Tn.t/ associated with the eigenvalue
n D n22=L2 must satisfy the conditions

Music
Numerous familiar musical instruments employ vibrating strings to generate the
sounds they produce. When a string vibrates with a given frequency, vibrations at
this frequency are transmitted through the air—in the form of periodic variations in
air density called sound waves—to the ear of the listener. For example, middle C
is a tone with a frequency of approximately 256 Hz. When several tones are heard
simultaneously, the combination is perceived as harmonious if the ratios of their
frequencies are nearly ratios of small whole numbers; otherwise many perceive the
combinations as dissonant.
The series in Eq. (23) represents the motion of a string as a superposition of
inﬁnitely many vibrations with different frequencies. The nth term

is called the fundamental frequency, and it is ordinarily predominant in the sound
we hear. The frequency n D n1 of the nth overtone or harmonic is an integral
multiple of 1, and this is why the sound of a single vibrating string is harmonious
rather than dissonant.
Note in Eq. (26) that the fundamental frequency 1 is proportional to
p
T and
inversely proportional to L and to p. Thus we can double this frequency—and
hence get a fundamental tone one octave higher—either by halving the length L
or by quadrupling the tension T . The initial conditions do not affect 1; instead,
they determine the coefﬁcients in (23) and hence the extent to which the higher
harmonics contribute to the sound produced. Therefore the initial conditions affect
the timbre, or overall frequency mixture, rather than the fundamental frequency.
(Technically this is true only for relatively small displacements of the string; if you
strike a piano key rather forcefully you can detect a slight and brief initial deviation
from the usual frequency of the note.)
According to one (rather simplistic) theory of hearing, the loudness of the
sound produced by a vibrating string is proportional to its total (kinetic plus poten-
tial) energy, which is given by

The d’Alembert Solution
In contrast with series solutions of the heat equation, formal series solutions of the
wave equation ordinarily do not possess sufﬁcient termwise differentiability to per-
mit veriﬁcation of the solution by application of a superposition theorem analogous

618
Chapter 9 Fourier Series Methods and Partial Differential Equations
to the one stated in Section 9.5. For instance, termwise differentiation of the series
in (24) would yield the series

which generally fails to converge, because the “convergence factor” 1=n2 has disap-
peared after the second differentiation.
There is, however, an alternative approach that both veriﬁes the solution in
(23) and yields valuable additional information about it. If we apply the trigono-
metric identity

with A D nx=L and B D nat=L, then (23) gives

(30)
Therefore, the series in (23) converges to the expression on the right-hand side in
(30), which is known as the d’Alembert form of the solution of Problem A for the
vibrating string. Moreover, using the chain rule, it is easy to verify (Problems 13
and 14) that the function y.x; t/ deﬁned in (30) does, indeed, satisfy the equation
ytt D a2yxx (under the assumption that F is twice differentiable), as well as the
boundary conditions y.0; t/ D y.L; t/ D 0 and y.x; 0/ D f .x/.
For any function F.x/, the functions F.x C at/ and F.x  at/ represent
“waves” moving to the left and right, respectively, along the x-axis with speed a.
This fact is illustrated in Fig. 9.6.3, which shows the graphs of these two functions
for successive values of t, in a typical case where the initial position function F.x/
is a pulse function centered at the midpoint x D =2 of a string of length L D 
with a D 1 (so the fundamental period of vibration is 2). Thus the d’Alembert so-
lution in (30) expresses y.x; t/ as a superposition of two waves moving in opposite
directions with speed a. This is why the equation ytt D a2yxx is called the wave
equation.

The separation-of-variables solution of Problem B, with initial conditions y.x; 0/ D

If, ﬁnally, a string has both a nonzero initial position function y.x; 0/ D f .x/
and a nonzero initial velocity function yt.x; 0/ D g.x/, then we can obtain its dis-
placement function by adding the d’Alembert solutions of Problems A and B given

The snapshots in Fig. 9.6.5 show successive positions of a vi-

9.6 Application Vibrating-String Investigations
Here we describe a Mathematica implementation of the d’Alembert solution
y.x; t/ D 1
2 ŒF.x C at/ C F.x  at/
(1)
of the vibrating-string problem of Example 3, and apply it to investigate graphically
the motions that result from a variety of different initial positions of the string.

624
Chapter 9 Fourier Series Methods and Partial Differential Equations
Maple and MATLAB versions of this implementation are included in the applications
manual that accompanies this text.
To plot the snapshots shown in Fig. 9.6.5, we began with the initial position
function
f[x ] := 2Sin[x]^2
To deﬁne the odd period 2 extension F.x/ of f .x/, we need the function s.x/ that
shifts the point x by an integral multiple of  into the interval Œ0; .
s[x ] := Block[{k}, k = Floor[N[x/Pi]];
If[EvenQ[k], ( k is even )
( then ) N[x -- kPi],
( else ) N[x -- kPi -- Pi]]]
Then the desired odd extension is deﬁned by
F[x ] := If[s[x] > 0, ( then ) f[s[x]],
( else )--f[--s[x]]]
Finally, the d’Alembert solution in (1) is
G[x , t ] := ( F[x + t] + F[x -- t] )/2
A snapshot of the position of the string at time t is deﬁned by
stringAt[t ] := Plot[G[x,t], {x, 0, Pi},
PlotRange > {--2, 2}];
For example, the command stringAt[Pi/4] plots the snapshot corresponding
to t D =4 shown in Fig. 9.6.5(e), once again showing the ﬂat spot appearing in
Fig. 9.6.4. We can plot a whole sequence of shapshots at once:
snapshots = Table[ stringAt[t], {t, 0, Pi, Pi/12}]
These snapshots can be animated to show the vibrating string in motion:
Manipulate[stringAt[t], {t, 0, Pi}]
We can also exhibit simultaneously the successive positions of the string in a single
composite ﬁgure (see Fig. 9.6.6) with the command Show[snapshots].
The initial position function
f[x ] := If[x < Pi/2, ( then ) x,
( else ) Pi -- x] // N
(corresponding to the triangular wave function of Fig. 9.2.4) generates in this way
the composite picture shown in Fig. 9.6.7. Similarly, the initial position function
f[x ] := Which[ 0 <= x < Pi/3, x,
Pi/3 <= x < 2Pi/3, Pi/3,
2Pi/3 <= x <= Pi, Pi -- x ] // N
(corresponding to the trapezoidal wave function of Fig. 9.2.5) produces the picture
shown in Fig. 9.6.8.
You can test your implementation of d’Alembert’s method by attempting to
generate Figs. 9.6.7 and 9.6.8 for yourself. The initial position “bump function”
f .x/ D sin200 x;
0 5 x 5 
generates traveling waves traveling (initially) in opposite directions, as indicated in

of a jump rope tied to a tree, whose free end is given a “snap” at time t D 0.)
After exploring some of the possibilities indicated previously, try some initial
position functions of your own choice. Any continuous function f such that f .0/ D
f ./ D 0 is fair game. The more exotic the resulting vibration of the string, the
better.
9.7 Steady-State Temperature and Laplace’s Equation
We now consider the temperature in a two-dimensional plate, or lamina, that occu-
pies a region R in the xy-plane bounded by a piecewise smooth curve C, as shown
in Fig. 9.7.1. We assume that the faces of the plate are insulated, and that it is so thin
x

and its bounding curve C.
that the temperature within it does not vary in the direction perpendicular to the xy-
plane. We want to determine, under various conditions, the temperature u.x; y; t/ at
the point .x; y/ at time t.
Let the plate consist of material with density ı (mass per unit volume), speciﬁc
heat c (per unit mass), and thermal conductivity K, all assumed constant throughout
the plate. Under these assumptions, it can be shown (by a generalization of the
derivation of the one-dimensional heat equation in Section 9.5) that the temperature
function u.x; y; t/ satisﬁes the two-dimensional heat equation

of the material of the plate. The sum of second derivatives on the right-hand side in
(1) is the Laplacian of the function u, commonly denoted by
r 2u D @2u
@x2 C @2u
@y2 ;
(3)
so the two-dimensional heat equation may be written as
@u
@t D kr 2u:
(10)
In comparing Eq. (10) with the one-dimensional heat equation ut D kuxx,
we see that in passing from one to two dimensions, the second-order space deriva-
tive uxx is replaced with the Laplacian r 2u. This is an instance of a general phe-
nomenon. For instance, if a ﬂexible stretched membrane occupies in equilibrium
a region in the xy-plane and vibrates in the (perpendicular) ´-direction, then its
displacement function ´ D ´.x; y; t/ satisﬁes the two-dimensional wave equation

This equation has the same relation to the one-dimensional wave equation ´tt D
a2´xx (here writing ´.x; t/ for the displacement of a string) as Eq. (10) has to the
one-dimensional heat equation.
In this section we conﬁne our attention to the steady-state situation in which
the temperature u does not vary with time, and so is a function only of x and y. Thus
we are interested in the steady-state temperature of a plate. In this case ut D 0, so
Eq. (1) becomes the two-dimensional Laplace equation

space) by electric and gravitational potential functions. It is also satisﬁed by the
velocity potential function for the steady irrotational ﬂow of an incompressible and
inviscid ﬂuid (that is, one having zero viscosity).
Dirichlet Problems
A particular solution of Laplace’s equation in a bounded plane region R is deter-
mined by appropriate boundary conditions. For example, it is plausible on physical
grounds that the steady-state temperature u.x; y/ in a plate is determined if we know
that u.x; y/ agrees with a given function f .x; y/ at each point of the boundary curve
C of the plate. To ﬁnd the steady-state temperature in a plate with assigned bound-
ary values, we need to solve the boundary value problem
@2u
@x2 C @2u
@y2 D 0
(within R);
u.x; y/ D f .x; y/
(if .x; y/ is on C).
(6)
Such a problem, ﬁnding a solution of Laplace’s equation in a region R with given
boundary values, is called a Dirichlet problem. It is known that if the boundary
curve C and the boundary value function f are reasonably well behaved, then there
exists a unique solution of the Dirichlet problem in (6).

Because there are four nonhomogeneous conditions (rather than one), this boundary
value problem is not directly susceptible to the method of separation of variables. In
Section 9.6, when confronted with this difﬁculty, we split the problem of the vibrat-
ing string with both nonzero initial position and nonzero initial velocity into prob-
lems with a single nonhomogeneous condition each. In a similar way, the boundary
value problem in (7) can be split into four problems, each with a single nonhomo-
geneous boundary condition. For each of these problems, u.x; y/ will be zero along
three edges of the rectangle and will have assigned values on the fourth. Each of
these four boundary values can be solved by the method of separation of variables,
and the sum of the four solutions is the solution of the original problem in (7). In
the following example we solve one of these four problems—the one illustrated in
Fig. 9.7.3.

Remark 1:
Can you supply an argument—perhaps using symmetry—that proves (without
using the series solution) that u.5; 5/ is exactly 25?
Remark 2:
In practice, engineers use solutions like the one in Eq. (15) to plot the variation
of temperature within a plate or piece of machinery; they are particularly interested in any
“hot spots” that may appear. Such information is often presented by constructing level curves
on which the temperature function u.x; y/ is constant. Figure 9.7.4 shows typical level curves
for the function u.x; y/ in (15) with a D b D 10 and T0 D 100.

Figure 9.7.6 shows some typical level curves of the temperature function deﬁned by this
formula with b D 10 and T0 D 100. Because of the negative exponential factors in the terms
of the ﬁnal series, we see that the temperature u.x; y/ ! 0 as x ! C1 (whereas in (16) we
assumed only that u.x; y/ remains bounded as x ! C1).
The Dirichlet Problem for a Circular Disk
We now investigate the steady-state temperature in a circular disk of radius a with
insulated faces and with given boundary temperatures. Obviously we should ac-
commodate the geometry of the circle by expressing u D u.r; / in terms of polar
coordinates r and , with x D r cos  and y D r sin . When these equations are
used to transform the Laplacian—see, for instance, Problem 45 in Section 12.7 of
Edwards and Penney, Calculus: Early Transcendentals, 7th edition, (Upper Saddle
River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2008)—the result is Laplace’s equation in polar coordi-
nates:

where the function f ./ of period 2 is given. In addition, because .r; / and .r;  C

condition
u.r; / D u.r;  C 2/
(24)
for r < a and all ; this will play the role of a homogeneous boundary condition.
To solve the boundary value problem in Eqs. (22) through (24), we substitute
u.r; / D R.r/‚./ in Eq. (22); the result is
R00‚ C 1
r R0‚ C 1
r2 R‚00 D 0:
Division by R‚=r2 gives

(27c)
Now we apply the condition in (24), which implies that ‚./ D ‚. C 2/;
that is, that ‚./ has period 2. In Problems 22 and 23 we ask you to show that this
is so only if  D n2 (n an integer) in (27a) or if  D 0 and B D 0 in (27b). Thus we
have the eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions

r2R00
0 C rR0
0 D 0 with general solution
R0.r/ D C0 C D0 ln r:
(29)
Of course we want u.r; /, and hence R.r/, to be continuous at r D 0; this requires
that D0 D 0 in Eq. (29), so R0.r/ D C0. Then, with  D n D n2, Eq. (25) is
r2R00
n C rR0

On substituting the trial solution R.r/ D rk, we ﬁnd that k D ˙n, so the general
solution of the previous equation is
Rn.r/ D Cnrn C Dn

(30)
Continuity at r D 0 then requires that Dn D 0, so Rn.r/ D Cnrn.
Finally we combine the results in Eqs. (28) through (30) with Dn  0 to obtain
a formal series solution of the form

Note
In the Dirichlet problems of this section, we have concentrated on temperature func-
tions with preassigned boundary values. In the case of a plate with an insulated edge—across
which no heat can ﬂow—the boundary condition is that the derivative of u.x; y/ in the direc-
tion normal to this edge vanishes. For instance, consider the rectangular plate in Fig. 9.7.2.
If the edge x D 0 is insulated, then ux.0; y/  0, whereas if the edge y D b is insulated, then
uy.x; b/  0.

The streamlines in Fig. 9.7.9 are the level curves
of the function  .x; y/ given in part (b) of Problem 18. It is
troublesome to write a computer program to plot such level
curves. It is far easier to plot some solutions of the differential
equation dy=dx D uy=ux. We did so with initial conditions
x0 D 5, y0 D 2:7, 2:5, 2:3, : : : ; 2:5, 2:7. The solutions
were obtained numerically using the improved Euler method
(Section 2.5) with step size 0:02.

t and the distance r from the center of the ball, so we write

10.1 Sturm–Liouville Problems and Eigenfunction Expansions
I
n the last three sections of Chapter 9, we saw that numerous different boundary
value problems all lead—by separation of variables—to the same ordinary differ-
ential equation
X00.x/ C X.x/ D 0
.0 < x < L/;
(1)
containing an eigenvalue , but with different endpoint conditions, such as
X.0/ D X.L/ D 0
(2)
or
X0.0/ D X0.L/ D 0
(3)
or
X.0/ D X0.L/ D 0;
(4)
depending on the original boundary conditions.
For example, recall the problem (in Section 9.5) of ﬁnding the temperature
u.x; t/ in a rod 0 5 x 5 L with given initial temperature u.x; 0/ D f .x/. As a
boundary value problem, this problem of the rod is the same as the problem of
ﬁnding the temperature within a large slab that occupies the region 0 5 x 5 L in
xy´-space. If its initial temperature depends only on x and is independent of y
and ´—that is, if u.x; 0/ D f .x/—then the same will be true of its temperature
u D u.x; t/ at time t. When we substitute
u.x; t/ D X.x/T .t/
635

Chapter 10 Eigenvalue Methods and Boundary Value Problems
in the heat equation
@u

D k @2u
@x2 ;
we ﬁnd that X.x/ satisﬁes the endpoint conditions in (2) if the faces x D 0 and x D L
of the slab are held at temperature zero, those in (3) if both faces are insulated, and
those in (4) if one face is insulated and the other is held at temperature zero. But if
each face loses heat to a surrounding medium (at temperature zero) in accord with
Newton’s law of cooling, then (according to Problem 23 of Section 9.5) the endpoint
conditions take the form
hX.0/  X0.0/ D 0 D hX.L/ C X0.L/;
(5)
where h is a nonnegative heat transfer coefﬁcient.
The point is that when we impose different endpoint conditions on the solution
of Eq. (1), we get different eigenvalue problems, and hence different eigenvalues
fng and different eigenfunctions fXn.x/g to use in constructing a formal power
series solution
u.x; t/ D

of the boundary value problem. The ﬁnal step in this construction is to choose the
coefﬁcient fcng in Eq. (6) so that
u.x; 0/ D

cnTn.0/Xn.x/ D f .x/:
(7)
Thus we need ﬁnally an eigenfunction expansion of the given function f .x/ in terms
of the eigenfunctions of the pertinent endpoint value problem.
Sturm–Liouville Problems
In order to unify and generalize the method of separation of variables, it is useful to
formulate a general type of eigenvalue problem that includes as special cases each
of those mentioned previously. Equation (1), with y instead of X as the dependent
variable, can be written in the form
d
dx

p.x/ dy
dx

 q.x/y C r.x/y D 0;
(8)
where p.x/ D r.x/  1 and q.x/  0. Indeed, we indicate in Problem 16 that
essentially any linear second-order differential equation of the form
A.x/y00 C B.x/y0 C C.x/y C D.x/y D 0
takes the form in (8) after multiplication by a suitable factor.
Example 1
If we multiply the parametric Bessel equation
x2y00 C xy0 C .x2  n2/y D 0
.x > 0/
of order n by 1=x, the result may be written as
d
dx

x dy
dx

 n2
x y C xy D 0;
which is of the form in (8) with p.x/ D r.x/ D x and q.x/ D n2=x.

10.1 Sturm–Liouville Problems and Eigenfunction Expansions
637
Now, on solutions of Eq. (8) in a bounded open interval .a; b/, let us impose
homogeneous (linear) endpoint conditions of the form
˛1y.a/  ˛2y0.a/ D 0;
ˇ1y.b/ C ˇ2y0.b/ D 0;
(9)
where the coefﬁcients ˛1, ˛2, ˇ1, and ˇ2 are constants. In addition to being homo-
geneous, these two conditions are separated, in that one of them involves the values
of y.x/ and y0.x/ at one endpoint x D a, whereas the other involves values at the
other endpoint x D b. For instance, note that the conditions y.a/ D y0.b/ D 0 are of
the form in (9) with ˛1 D ˇ2 D 1 and ˛2 D ˇ1 D 0.
DEFINITION
Sturm–Liouville Problem
A Sturm–Liouville problem is an endpoint value problem of the form
d
dx

p.x/ dy
dx

 q.x/y C r.x/y D 0
.a < x < b/I
(8)
˛1y.a/  ˛2y0.a/ D 0;
ˇ1y.b/ C ˇ2y0.b/ D 0;
(9)
with neither ˛1 and ˛2 both zero nor ˇ1 and ˇ2 both zero. The parameter  in (8)
is the “eigenvalue” whose possible (constant) values are sought.
Sturm–Liouville problems generalize the endpoint value problems of Section
3.8 with sine and cosine solutions. They are named for the French mathematicians
Charles Sturm (1803–1855) and Joseph Liouville (1809–1882), who investigated
such problems in the 1830s.
Example 2
We get different Sturm–Liouville problems by pairing the same differential equation
y00 C y D 0
(for 0 < x < L)
with the different homogeneous endpoint conditions

y.0/ D y.L/ D 0 (where ˛1 D ˇ1 D 1 and ˛2 D ˇ2 D 0),

y0.0/ D y0.L/ D 0 (where ˛1 D ˇ1 D 0 and ˛2 D ˇ2 D 1), and

y.0/ D y0.L/ D 0 (where ˛1 D ˇ2 D 1 and ˛2 D ˇ1 D 0).
Note that the Sturm–Liouville problem in (8)–(9) always has the trivial solu-
tion y.x/  0. We seek the values of —the eigenvalues—for which this problem
has a nontrivial real-valued solution (an eigenfunction), and for each eigenvalue
its associated eigenfunction (or eigenfunctions). Note that any constant (nonzero)
multiple of an eigenfunction will also be an eigenfunction. The following theorem
provides sufﬁcient conditions under which the problem in (8)–(9) has an inﬁnite
sequence fng1
1 of nonnegative eigenvalues, with each eigenvalue n having (to
within a constant multiple) exactly one associated eigenfunction yn.x/. A proof of
this theorem is outlined in Chapter 9 of G. P. Tolstov, Fourier Series (New York:
Dover, 1976).

638
Chapter 10 Eigenvalue Methods and Boundary Value Problems
THEOREM 1
Sturm–Liouville Eigenvalues
Suppose that the functions p.x/, p0.x/, q.x/, and r.x/ in Eq. (8) are continuous
on the interval Œa; b and that p.x/ > 0 and r.x/ > 0 at each point of Œa; b.
Then the eigenvalues of the Sturm–Liouville problem in (8)–(9) constitute an
increasing sequence
1 < 2 < 3 <    < n1 < n <   
(10)
of real numbers with
lim
n!1 n D C1:
(11)
To within a constant factor, only a single eigenfunction yn.x/ is associated with
each eigenvalue n. Moreover, if q.x/ = 0 on Œa; b and the coefﬁcients ˛1, ˛2,
ˇ1, and ˇ2 in (9) are all nonnegative, then the eigenvalues are all nonnegative.
Note
It is important to observe the signs in (8) and (9) when verifying the hypotheses of
Theorem 1. Sometimes the Sturm–Liouville problem in (8)–(9) is called regular if it satisﬁes
the hypotheses of Theorem 1; otherwise it is singular. In this section we will conﬁne our at-
tention to regular Sturm–Liouville problems. Singular Sturm–Liouville problems associated
with Bessel’s equation will appear in Section 10.4.
Example 3
In Example 3 of Section 3.8, we saw that the Sturm–Liouville problem
y00 C y D 0
.0 < x < L/I
y.0/ D 0;
y.L/ D 0
(12)
has eigenvalues n D n22=L2 and associated eigenfunctions yn.x/ D sin.nx=L/ (n D 1, 2,
3, : : :). There we had to consider the cases  D ˛2 < 0,  D 0, and  D ˛2 > 0 separately.
Here p.x/ D r.x/  1, q.x/  0, ˛1 D ˇ1 D 1, and ˛2 D ˇ2 D 0, so we know from Theorem
1 that the problem in (12) has only nonnegative eigenvalues. Therefore, only the two cases
 D 0 and  D ˛2 > 0 would need to be considered if we were starting afresh.
We are also familiar (from the problems in Section 9.5) with the Sturm–
Liouville problem
y00 C y D 0
.0 < x < L/I
y0.0/ D 0;
y0.L/ D 0;
(13)
which has eigenvalues 0 D 0, n D n22=L2 (n D 1, 2, 3, : : :) and associated
eigenfunctions y0.x/  1, yn.x/ D cos.nx=L/. We will customarily write 0 D 0
if 0 is an eigenvalue and otherwise write 1 for the smallest eigenvalue; thus 1
always denotes the smallest positive eigenvalue.
Example 4
Find the eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions of the Sturm–Liouville problem
y00 C y D 0
.0 < x < L/I

y.L/ D 0:
(14)
Solution
This is a Sturm–Liouville problem satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 1 with ˛1 D ˇ2 D 0
and ˛2 D ˇ1 D 1, so there are no negative eigenvalues. If  D 0, then y.x/ D Ax C B, and
thus y0.0/ D A D 0 and y.L/ D B D 0. Therefore 0 is not an eigenvalue. If  D ˛2, then
y.x/ D A cos ˛x C B sin ˛x
and
y0.x/ D A˛ sin ˛x C B˛ cos ˛x:

10.1 Sturm–Liouville Problems and Eigenfunction Expansions
639
Hence y0.0/ D 0 implies that B D 0, and then y.L/ D A cos ˛L D 0, so it follows that
˛L is an odd integral multiple of =2: ˛L D .2n  1/=2. Thus we have the eigenvalues and

This problem satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theorem 1 with ˛1 D ˇ2 D 1, ˛2 D 0, and ˇ1 D h > 0,

than .2n  1/=2. See the table in Fig. 10.1.2, in which the ﬁrst eight solutions of Eq. (17)

Orthogonal Eigenfunctions
Recall from Section 9.1 that the familiar formulas for the coefﬁcients in a Fourier
series follow from the orthogonality of the sine and cosine functions. Similarly, the
expansion of a given function in terms of the eigenfunctions of a Sturm–Liouville
problem depends on a crucial orthogonality property of these eigenfunctions. The

640
Chapter 10 Eigenvalue Methods and Boundary Value Problems
functions .x/ and  .x/ are said to be orthogonal on the interval Œa; b with respect
to the weight function r.x/ provided that
Z b
a
.x/ .x/r.x/ dx D 0:
(19)
The following theorem implies that any two eigenfunctions of a regular Sturm–
Liouville problem that are associated with distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal with
respect to the weight function r.x/ in Eq. (8).
THEOREM 2
Orthogonality of Eigenfunctions
Suppose that the functions p, q, and r in the Sturm–Liouville problem in
Eqs. (8)–(9) satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem 1, and let yi.x/ and yj .x/ be
eigenfunctions associated with the distinct eigenvalues i and j. Then
Z b

yi.x/yj .x/r.x/ dx D 0:

d


p.x/dyj

 q.x/yj C j r.x/yj D 0:
(21)
These equations imply that i, yi and j, yj are eigenvalue–eigenfunction pairs. If
we multiply the ﬁrst equation by yj and the second by yi, then subtract the results,
we get

From the endpoint condition in (9), we have
˛1yi.a/  ˛2y0
i.a/ D 0
and
˛1yj .a/  ˛2y0
j .a/ D 0:

10.1 Sturm–Liouville Problems and Eigenfunction Expansions
641
Because ˛1 and ˛2 are not both zero, it follows that the determinant of coefﬁcients
must be zero:
yi.a/y0
j .a/  yj .a/y0
i.a/ D 0:
Similarly, the second endpoint condition in (9) implies that
yi.b/y0
j .b/  yj .b/y0
i.b/ D 0:
Thus the right-hand side in Eq. (22) vanishes. Inasmuch as i ¤ j, the result in
(20) follows, and the proof is complete.
Eigenfunction Expansions
Now suppose that the function f .x/ can be represented in the interval Œa; b by an
eigenfunction series
f .x/ D
1
X
mD1
cmym.x/;
(23)
where the functions y1, y2, y3, : : : are the eigenfunctions of the regular Sturm–
Liouville problem in Eqs. (8)–(9). To determine the coefﬁcients c1, c2, c3, : : : ; we
generalize the technique by which we determined the ordinary Fourier coefﬁcients
in Section 9.1. First we multiply each side of Eq. (23) by yn.x/r.x/, and then we
integrate from x D a to x D b. Under the assumption that termwise integration is
valid, we obtain
Z b
a
f .x/yn.x/r.x/ dx D
1
X
mD1
cm
Z b
a
ym.x/yn.x/r.x/ dx:
(24)
But because of the orthogonality in (20), the only nonzero term on the right-hand
side in Eq. (24) is the one for which m D n. Thus Eq. (24) takes the form
Z b
a
f .x/yn.x/r.x/ dx D cn
Z b
a
Œyn.x/2 r.x/ dx;
and therefore
cn D
Z b
a
f .x/yn.x/r.x/ dx
Z b
a
Œyn.x/2 r.x/ dx
:
(25)
We therefore deﬁne the eigenfunction series in (23)—representing f .x/ in terms of
the eigenfunctions of the given Sturm–Liouville problem—by means of the choice
of the coefﬁcients speciﬁed by Eq. (25).
For instance, suppose that the Sturm–Liouville problem is the familiar
y00 C y D 0
.0 < x < /I
y.0/ D y./ D 0;
(26)

642
Chapter 10 Eigenvalue Methods and Boundary Value Problems
for which r.x/  1 and the eigenfunctions are yn.x/ D sin nx for n D 1, 2, 3, : : : :
Then Eq. (25) yields

This is the familiar formula for the Fourier sine coefﬁcients, and so the eigenfunc-
tion series in (23) is simply the familiar Fourier sine series

of f .x/ on Œ0; .
The following theorem, stated without proof, generalizes the Fourier conver-
gence theorem of Section 9.2.
THEOREM 3
Convergence of Eigenfunction Series
Let y1, y2, y3, : : : be the eigenfunctions of a regular Sturm–Liouville problem on
Œa; b. If the function f .x/ is piecewise smooth on Œa; b, then the eigenfunction
series in Eq. (23) converges for a < x < b to the value f .x/ wherever f is
continuous, and to the average 1

Example 6
For the Sturm–Liouville problem y00 C y D 0 (0 < x < L), y0.0/ D y.L/ D 0 of Example 4,
we found the eigenfunctions yn.x/ D cos.2n1/x=.2L/, n D 1, 2, 3, : : : : The corresponding

Thus the series in Eq. (27) is the odd half-multiple cosine series of Problem 22 of Section

Summary
According to the theorems in this section, every regular Sturm–Liouville problem
has the following three properties:

It has an inﬁnite sequence of eigenvalues diverging to inﬁnity (Theorem 1).

The eigenfunctions are orthogonal with appropriate weight function (Theorem
2).

Any piecewise smooth function can be represented by an eigenfunction series
(Theorem 3).
There are other types of eigenvalue problems in applied mathematics that also enjoy
these three important properties. Some isolated examples will appear in subsequent
sections, though we will conﬁne our attention largely to applications of Sturm–
Liouville problems.

functions of the problem in (33) are n D ˇ2

Loaded Uniform Beam
Consider a uniform beam with (downward) load w.x/, whose

In the case in which each end is hinged, y.x/ can be found by
the Fourier series method discussed in Section 9.4—that is, by
substituting the Fourier series

The method used in Problems 17 and 18 succeeds because
the functions sin.nx=L/ satisfy the hinged=hinged conditions
y.0/ D y00.0/ D y.L/ D y00.L/ D 0, so that y.x/ does also.
If, instead, both ends of the beam are ﬁxed, in place of
the sine functions we can use the eigenfunctions of the problem
y.4/  y D 0
.0 < x < L/I
y.0/ D y0.0/ D 0;
y.L/ D y0.L/ D 0;
(35)
because these eigenfunctions satisfy the ﬁxed=ﬁxed endpoint
conditions. The eigenvalues of this problem are all positive,
and by Problem 22 the associated eigenfunctions are orthogo-
nal with weight function r.x/  1. Hence we can write

y.x/ D A cosh ˛x
C B sinh ˛x C C cos ˛x C D sin ˛x;
(37)
with ˛ D ˛n, so it follows that y.4/

The following problems deal with the eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of the problem in (35) and similar problems.
19. Begin with the general solution in (37) of y.4/  ˛4y D 0.
First note that y.0/ D y0.0/ D 0 implies that C D A and
D D B. Then impose the conditions y.L/ D y0.L/ D 0
to get two homogeneous linear equations in A and B.
Hence the determinant of coefﬁcients of A and B must
vanish; deduce from this that cosh ˛L cos ˛L D 1. Con-
clude that the nth eigenvalue is n D ˇ4

y.0/ D y0.0/ D 0;

the equation cosh x cos x D 1. Then ﬁnd the associated

21. For the eigenvalue problem

y.0/ D y0.0/ D 0 D y.L/ D y00.L/
corresponding to a ﬁxed=hinged beam, show that the nth
eigenvalue is n D ˇ4

for 0 < x < 1. (We have taken A D 1 in Eq. (32) of this section.) Maple and
Mathematica versions of this investigation are included in the applications manual
that accompanies this text.
We saw in the solution of Example 7 that the values fˇng1
1 in Eq. (1) are
the positive solutions of the equation tan x D 2x. Just as indicated in Fig. 10.1.1
(for the similar equation tan x D x), the value of ˇn is (for n large) just slightly
larger than .2n  1/=2. But because of the discontinuities in the tangent function
near these solutions, it is best for automatic root-ﬁnding to rewrite our eigenvalue
equation in the form
sin x C 2x cos x D 0:

Then the MATLAB command
b = fsolve('sin(x)+2x.cos(x)', pi/2+0.1+(0:pi:99pi));
quickly generates the ﬁrst 100 values of ˇn (see Fig. 10.1.4). (We have provided a

to be separated by . The command

You can check your understanding of eigenfunction expansions by reworking
Example 7, except on the interval 0 < x < L and with the right-endpoint condition in

calculate the resulting values of ˇn and construct graphs like those in Figs. 10.1.5
and 10.1.6. In Fig. 10.1.6 we see convergence to f .x/  1 within the interval
0 < x < 1, but a typical Gibbs phenomenon at x D 0.
10.2 Applications of Eigenfunction Series
This section is devoted to three examples that illustrate the application of the eigen-
function series of Section 10.1 to boundary value problems. In each, the method of
separation of variables leads to a Sturm–Liouville problem in which the eigenfunc-
tions are used as building blocks to construct a solution satisfying the nonhomoge-
neous boundary condition in the original problem.
Example 1
A uniform slab of material with thermal diffusivity k occupies the space region 0 5 x 5 L
and initially has temperature U0 throughout. Beginning at time t D 0, the face x D 0 is held
at temperature zero, while at the face x D L, heat exchange takes place with a surrounding
medium at temperature zero, so huCux D 0 there (by Problem 23 of Section 9.5; the constant
h is an appropriate heat transfer coefﬁcient). We want to ﬁnd the temperature u.x; t/ of the
slab at position x at time t; u.x; t/ satisﬁes the boundary value problem

Now Eq. (2) gives X.0/ D 0, and Eq. (3) yields hX.L/T .t/ C X0.L/T .t/ D 0. We naturally
assume that T .t/ is not identically zero (because we are not looking for a trivial solution); it

Longitudinal Vibrations of Bars
Suppose that a uniform elastic bar has length L, cross-sectional area A, and density
ı (mass per unit volume), and occupies the interval 0 5 x 5 L when it is unstretched.
We consider longitudinal vibrations of the bar in which each cross section (normal
to the x-axis) moves only in the x-direction. We can then describe the motion of the
bar in terms of the displacement u.x; t/ at time t of the cross section whose position
is x when the bar is unstretched (and at rest); we may refer to this particular cross
section as the cross section x of the bar. Then the position at time t of the cross
section x is x C u.x; t/. It follows (see Problem 13) from Hooke’s law and the
deﬁnition of the Young’s modulus E of the material of the bar that the force F.x; t/
exerted on the cross section x by the part of the bar to the left of this section is
F.x; t/ D AEux.x; t/;
(13)
the minus sign signifying that F acts to the left when ux.x; t/ > 0. To see why this
is so, we consider the segment of the bar that lies between cross section x and cross
section x C x (Fig. 10.2.1). At time t the ends of this segment are at x C u.x; t/
and x C x C u.x C x; t/, respectively, so its length (originally x > 0) is now
(using the mean value theorem)

for some Ox between x and x C x. So if ux.x; t/ > 0 and x is sufﬁciently small,
then (by continuity) ux. Ox; t/ x > 0. Hence the segment is indeed stretched to a
length greater than x. And therefore forces F.x; t/ and F.x C x; t/ acting to the
left and right, respectively (as indicated in Fig. 10.2.1), would be required to sustain
this stretching.
We take Eq. (13) as the starting point for our derivation of the partial differen-
tial equation that the displacement function u.x; t/ satisﬁes when the displacements
are sufﬁciently small that Hooke’s law may be applied. If we apply Newton’s second
law of motion to the segment of the bar between cross section x and cross section
x C x, we get

Because Eq. (15) is identical to the equation of the vibrating string, it follows from
our discussion of the d’Alembert solution in Section 9.6 that the (free) longitu-
dinal vibrations of a bar with ﬁxed ends are represented by waves of the form
u.x; t/ D g.x ˙ at/. The velocity a D
p
E=ı with which these waves travel is
the velocity of sound in the material of the bar. Indeed, the wave equation in (15)
also describes ordinary one-dimensional sound waves in a gas in a pipe. In this
case, E in Eq. (16) denotes the bulk modulus (fractional increase in density per unit
increase in pressure) of the gas and ı is its equilibrium density.
Example 2
A bar has length L, density ı, cross-sectional area A, Young’s modulus E, and total mass
M D ıAL. Its end x D 0 is ﬁxed and a mass m is attached to its free end (Fig. 10.2.2). The
bar initially is stretched linearly by moving m a distance d D bL to the right (so the cross
section x of the bar is initially displaced by bx). Then at time t D 0 the system is released

value problem

mutt.L; t/ D AEux.L; t/;
(17c)
u.x; 0/ D bx;
ut.x; 0/ D 0:
(17d)
Solution
The endpoint condition at x D L in (17c) comes from equating ma D mutt for the mass with
the force F D AEux given in (13)—the mass being acted on only by the bar. Substitution
of u.x; t/ D X.x/T .t/ in utt D a2uxx leads, as usual, to the equations
X00 C X D 0;
T 00 C a2T D 0:
(18)
The boundary condition in (17b) yields u.0; t/ D X.0/T .t/ D 0, so one endpoint condition is
X.0/ D 0. Because utt D XT 00 and ux D X0T , Eq. (17c) yields
mX.L/T 00.t/ D AEX0.L/T .t/
as the other endpoint condition. Substitution of
T 00.t/ D a2T .t/ D E
ı T .t/;
followed by division by ET .t/=ı, gives mX.L/ D AıX0.L/. Thus the eigenvalue problem
for X.x/ is
X00 C X D 0I
X.0/ D 0;
mX.L/ D AıX0.L/:
(19)
It is important to note that—because of the presence of  in the right-endpoint condition—
this is not a Sturm–Liouville problem, so Theorems 1 through 3 of Section 10.1 do not apply.
Nevertheless, all eigenvalues of (19) are positive (Problem 9). We therefore write  D ˛2,
and note that X.x/ D sin ˛x satisﬁes X.0/ D 0. The right-endpoint condition in (19) then
yields

Caution is required because (19) is not a Sturm–Liouville problem. Indeed, we ask you to
show in Problems 14 and 15 that the eigenfunctions fsin.ˇnx=L/g1
1 are not orthogonal on
the interval Œ0; L with respect to the putative weight function r.x/  1, so the coefﬁcient
formula in Eq. (25), Section 10.1, is not applicable here.
But in the case of longitudinal vibrations one ordinarily is not so much concerned with
the displacement function u.x; t/ itself. Of greater interest is the question of how the bar’s
natural frequencies of vibration are affected by the mass m on its free end. Whatever the
coefﬁcients in Eq. (25) may be, we see from Eq. (24) that the nth circular frequency is

(26)
where ˇn is the nth positive solution of Eq. (22), which can be rewritten in the form

(27)
Thus the natural frequencies are determined by the ratio of the mass m to the total mass M
of the bar.
Remark The case of no mass on the free end of the bar corresponds to m D 0. Then Eq. (27)
reduces to the equation cos x D 0, whose nth positive solution is ˇn D .2n  1/=2. Then the
nth circular frequency is given by

point is not longitudinal, but instead is perpendicular to the x-axis (the axis of the
bar in its equilibrium position). Let y.x; t/ denote the transverse displacement of
the cross section at x at time t, as indicated in Fig. 10.2.4. We merely want to
outline a derivation of the partial differential equation that the deﬂection function
y.x; t/ satisﬁes. Recall ﬁrst that in Section 3.8 we introduced the equation EIy.4/ D
F for the static deﬂection of a bar or beam under the inﬂuence of a transverse
external force F (per unit length). According to a general dynamical principle, we
can transform the static equation EIy.4/ D F into a dynamical equation (with no
external force) by replacing F with the reversed inertial force F D ytt, where 
is the linear density (mass=length) of the bar, and also by replacing y.4/ with yxxxx.
This gives
EI @4y

which may be written in the form

The following example illustrates the solution of this fourth-order partial differential
equation by the method of separation of variables.
Example 3
A uniform bar with linear density , Young’s modulus E, and cross-sectional moment of
inertia I is simply supported (or hinged) at its two ends x D 0 and x D L. If the bar is set
in motion from rest with given initial position f .x/, then its displacement function y.x; t/
satisﬁes the boundary value problem

To determine the sign of , we reason that the equation

(33)
must have trigonometric rather than exponential solutions. The reason is that on the basis
of practical experience—with tuning forks or xylophone bars, for instance—one expects pe-
riodic vibrations to take place. This could not occur if  were negative and Eq. (33) had
exponential solutions. Hence  must be positive, and it is convenient to write  D ˛4 > 0.
Then X.t/ must satisfy the equation

The endpoint conditions in (31) yield

(35)
Hence
X.0/ D A C C D 0

It follows that

D sinh ˛L D 0:
But sinh ˛L ¤ 0 because ˛ ¤ 0; consequently, D D 0. Hence B ¤ 0 if we are to have a
nontrivial solution, so sin ˛L D 0. Thus ˛ must be an integral multiple of =L. Therefore,

shows that this actually occurs in about 1951 s; that is, about 32 min 31 s.
Figure 10.2.9 indicates that interior temperatures of the slab at time t1 still
remain above 50ı at some points, with a maximum occurring near x D 30. We can
ﬁnd this maximum value of the temperature u.x; t1/ by ﬁnding the minimum value
of its negative u.x; t1/. The command
FindMinimum[--u[x,t1], {x, 30}]
yields the result that the maximum value is u.29:36; t1/  53:80ı.

The solution in Eq. (1) describes the free vibrations of a string with length L and
linear density  under tension T ; the constant coefﬁcients in Eq. (1) are determined
by the initial conditions in (4).
In particular, we see from the terms in Eq. (1) that the natural (circular) fre-
quencies of vibration (in radians per second) of the string are given by

Forced Vibrations and Resonance
Now suppose that the string is inﬂuenced by a periodic external force F.t/ D
F0 cos !t (force per unit mass) that acts uniformly on the string along its length.
Then, according to Eq. (1) of Section 9.6, the displacement y.x; t/ of the string will
satisfy the nonhomogeneous partial differential equation
@2y
@t2 D a2 @2y
@x2 C F0 cos !t
(7)
together with boundary conditions such as those in (3) and (4). For instance, if the
string is initially at rest in equilibrium when the external force begins to act, we
want to ﬁnd a solution of Eq. (7) that satisﬁes the conditions
y.0; t/ D y.L; t/ D y.x; 0/ D yt.x; 0/ D 0
(8)
for 0 < x < L. To do this, it sufﬁces ﬁrst to ﬁnd a particular solution yp.x; t/
of Eq. (7) that satisﬁes the ﬁxed endpoint conditions in (3), and second to ﬁnd a
solution yc.x; t/ like Eq. (1) of the familiar problem in (2)–(4) with
f .x/ D yp.x; 0/
and
g.x/ D Dtyp.x; 0/:
Evidently,
y.x; t/ D yc.x; t/ C yp.x; t/
will then satisfy Eqs. (7) and (8).
So our new task is to ﬁnd yp.x; t/. Examination of the individual terms in
Eq. (7) suggests that we try
yp.x; t/ D X.x/ cos !t:
(9)
Substitution of this in Eq. (7) and cancellation of the common factor cos !t yields
the ordinary differential equation

Now suppose that the frequency ! of the periodic external force is not equal to any
one of the natural frequencies !n D na=L of the string. Then sin.!L=a/ ¤ 0, so
we can solve Eq. (11) for B and then substitute the result in Eq. (10) to obtain

Then Eq. (9), with this choice of X.x/, gives the desired particular solution yp.x; t/.
Note, however, that as the value of ! approaches !n D na=L with n odd, the
coefﬁcient of sin.!x=a/ in Eq. (12) approaches ˙1; thus resonance occurs. This
explains the fact that when (only) one of two nearby identical strings is plucked, the
other will begin to vibrate as well, due to its being acted on (through the medium
of the air) by an external periodic force at its fundamental frequency. Observe also
that if ! D !n D na=L with n even, then we can choose B D 0 in Eq. (11),
so resonance does not occur in this case. Problem 20 explains why some of the
resonance possibilities are absent.
The vibrating string is typical of continuous systems that have an inﬁnite se-
quence of natural frequencies of vibration. When a periodic external force acts on
such a system, potentially destructive resonance vibrations may occur if the im-
posed frequency is close to one of the natural frequencies of the system. Hence
an important aspect of proper structural design is the avoidance of such resonance
vibrations.

Chapter 10 Eigenvalue Methods and Boundary Value Problems
Here we want only to ﬁnd the natural frequencies of vibration of the beam, so we
will not be concerned with initial conditions. The natural frequencies are the values
of ! for which Eq. (13) has a nontrivial solution of the form
y.x; t/ D X.x/ cos.!t  /
(16)
that satisﬁes the conditions in Eqs. (14) and (15). When we substitute y.x; t/ from
(16) into (13) and then cancel the common factor cos.!t  /, we obtain the fourth-

with
X0.x/ D ˛.A sinh ˛x C B cosh ˛x  C sin ˛x C D cos ˛x/:
The conditions in (14) give
X.0/ D A C C D 0

so C D A and D D B. Hence the conditions in (15) give

and

˛ X0.L/ D A.sinh ˛L C sin ˛L/ C B.cosh ˛L  cos ˛L/ D 0:
In order for these two linear homogeneous equations in A and B to have a nontrivial

.cosh ˛L  cos ˛L/2  .sinh2 ˛L  sin2 ˛L/ D 0I

If a company of soldiers marching at about 120 steps per minute approaches this bridge, they
therefore would be well advised to break cadence before crossing. From time to time bridges
collapse because of resonance vibrations. Recall the Kansas City hotel disaster of July 17,
1981, in which a skywalk ﬁlled with dancers collapsed. Newspapers quoted investigators
who speculated that the rhythmic movement of the dancers had set up destructive resonance
vibrations in the steel I beams that supported the skywalk.
Underground Temperature Oscillations
Let us assume that the underground temperature at a particular location is a function
u.x; t/ of time t and the depth x beneath the surface. Then u satisﬁes the heat
equation ut D kuxx, with k being the thermal diffusivity of the soil. We may regard
the temperature u.0; t/ at the surface x D 0 as being known from weather records. In
fact, the periodic seasonal variation of monthly average surface temperatures, with
a maximum in midsummer (July in the northern hemisphere) and a minimum in
midwinter (January), is very close to a sine or cosine oscillation. We shall therefore
assume that
u.0; t/ D T0 C A0 cos !t;
(20)
where we take t D 0 at midsummer. Here T0 is the average annual temperature, A0
the amplitude of seasonal temperature variation, and ! is chosen to make the period
of u.0; t/ exactly one year. (In cgs units, for instance, ! would be 2 divided by the
number of seconds—31;557;341—in a year; thus !  1:991  107.)
It is reasonable to assume that the temperature at a ﬁxed depth also varies
periodically with t. If we introduce U.x; t/ D u.x; t/  T0 for convenience, then we
are interested in periodic solutions of the heat equation of the form
U.x; t/ D A.x/ cos.!t  / D V.x/ cos !t C W.x/ sin !t

(x > 0, t > 0),

U.0; t/ D A0 cos !t:

To solve this problem, let us regard U.x; t/ in Eq. (21) as the real part of the
complex-valued function
eU .x; t/ D X.x/ei!t:
(24)

662
Chapter 10 Eigenvalue Methods and Boundary Value Problems
Then we want eU .x; t/ to satisfy the conditions
eU t D keU xx;
(220)
eU .0; t/ D A0ei!t:
(230)
If we substitute Eq. (24) in Eq. (220), we get i!X D kX00; that is,

In order that eU .x; t/, and hence X.x/, be bounded as x ! C1, it is necessary that

(30)
In addition, there is a phase delay .x/ D x

Example 2
With k D 0:005 (a typical value for soil in cgs units) and the value of ! previously mentioned,
we ﬁnd that
p

amplitude is one-half the surface amplitude, A.x/ D 1
2A0, when .0:004462/x D ln 2; that is,
when x  155:34 cm  5:10 ft. If A0 D 16ıC, it follows that at a depth of about 20 ft, the
amplitude of annual temperature variation is only 1ı.
Example 3
Another interesting consequence of Eq. (29) is the “reversal of seasons” that occurs when
.x/ D .0:004462/x D ; that is, at a depth of x  704:06 cm, about 23:11 ft. Figure 10.3.4
shows the graph U D U.x; t/ for 0 5 x 5 X, 0 5 t 5 T , where X corresponds to 23 feet
in centimeters and T to 2:5 years in seconds. Can you see by inspection of the right edge of
the graph that the temperature at depth 23 feet appears to be at a maximum when the surface
temperature is at a minimum?

1. Both ends are ﬁxed.
2. Both ends are free.
3. The end at x D 0 is ﬁxed; the end at x D L is free.
4. The end at x D 0 is ﬁxed; the free end at x D L is attached

5. Each end is free, but the end at x D L is attached to a
spring with Hooke’s constant k as in Problem 12 of Sec-

uniform beam of this section, but with various end conditions.
In each case show that the natural frequencies are given by the
formula in Eq. (19), with fˇng1

given frequency equation. Recall that y D y0 D 0 at a ﬁxed
end, y D y00 D 0 at a hinged end, and y00 D y.3/ D 0 at a free
end (primes denote derivatives with respect to x).
8. The ends at x D 0 and x D L are both hinged; the fre-
quency equation is sin x D 0, so that ˇn D n.
9. The end at x D 0 is ﬁxed and the end at x D L is hinged;
the frequency equation is tanh x D tan x.
10. The beam is a cantilever with the end at x D 0 ﬁxed

11. The end at x D 0 is ﬁxed and the end at x D L is attached
to a vertically sliding clamp, so y0 D y.3/ D 0 there; the
frequency equation is tanh x C tan x D 0.
12. The cantilever of Problem 10 has total mass M D L and
has a mass m attached to its free end; the frequency equa-
tion is

13. The free end at x D L of the cantilever of Problem 10 is

stant k; the frequency equation is

made of steel with density ı D 7:75 g=cm3. The diving
board is 4 m long and its cross section is a rectangle of
width a D 30 cm and thickness b D 2 cm. The moment of
inertia of this rectangle around its horizontal axis of sym-
metry is I D

the equation cosh x cos x D 1 is ˇ1  1:8751, determine
the frequency (in hertz) at which a person should bounce

is, would you expect an axially compressed bar to vibrate
more slowly than an uncompressed bar?)

(with y.0/ D y0.0/ D y.L/ D y0.L/ D 0) is cosh x cos x D 1. This equation can
be solved using computer system methods like those illustrated in the applications
for Sections 10.1 and 10.2; the table in Fig. 10.3.6 lists the ﬁrst ten positive solu-

The fact that each (correctly) appears to have slope zero at both endpoints serves to
corroborate the calculations that generated the ﬁgure.

Case 1: Hinged at each end
The boundary conditions are

According to Problem 8, the frequency equation is sin x D 0, so ˇn D n and
Xn.x/ D sin nx. Suppose that the bar is made of steel (with density ı D 7:75
g=cm3 and Young’s modulus E D 2  1012 dyn=cm2) and is 19 in. long with square
cross section of edge w D 1 in. (so its moment of inertia is I D

12w4). Determine
its ﬁrst few natural frequencies of vibration (in Hz). How does this bar sound when
it vibrates?
Case 2: Free at each end
The boundary conditions are
y00.0/ D y.3/.0/ D y00.L/ D y.3/.L/ D 0:
This case models, for example, a weightless bar suspended in space in an orbiting
spacecraft. Now show that the frequency equation is cosh x cos x D 1 (although the
eigenfunctions differ from those in the ﬁxed=ﬁxed case). Solve this equation (either
graphically or numerically, as in the Section 10.2 application) to approximate the
ﬁrst several natural frequencies of vibration of the same bar considered in Case 1.
How does it sound now?
Case 3: Fixed at x D 0 , free at x = L
Now the boundary conditions are

It reduces to the insulation condition ur D 0 if ˇ1 D 0 and ˇ2 D 1.

It reduces to the heat transfer condition hu C ur D 0 if ˇ1 D h and ˇ2 D 1.
It is reasonable to expect the temperature u within the cylinder at time t to depend
only on r, so we write u D u.r; t/. Then u D u´´ D 0, so substitution of (1) in the

as t ! C1, as is required by the physical problem that Eqs. (3)–(5) model. We
therefore write  D ˛2, so Eq. (8) takes the form

Chapter 10 Eigenvalue Methods and Boundary Value Problems
A Singular Sturm–Liouville Problem
Equation (80) is—with x D r and y.x/ D R.r/—the parametric Bessel equation
x2y00 C xy0 C ˛2x2y D 0

of order zero that we discussed in Section 8.5. More generally, recall that the para-
metric Bessel equation

(10)
has general solution
y.x/ D AJn.˛x/ C BYn.˛x/

form

 n2
x y C xy D 0
(12)
with p.x/ D x, q.x/ D n2=x, r.x/ D x, and  D ˛2. We want to determine the
nonnegative values of  for which there is a solution of Eq. (12) in .0; c/ that is
continuous (along with its derivative dy=dx) on the closed interval Œ0; c and satisﬁes
the endpoint condition
ˇ1y.c/ C ˇ2y0.c/ D 0;
(13)
where ˇ1 and ˇ2 are not both zero.
The Sturm–Liouville problem associated with Eqs. (12) and (13) is singular
because p.0/ D r.0/ D 0 and q.x/ ! C1 as x ! 0C, whereas we assumed in Theo-
rem 1 of Section 10.1 that p.x/ and r.x/ were positive and that q.x/ was continuous
on the entire interval. This problem also fails to ﬁt the pattern of Section 10.1 in
that no condition like (13) is imposed at the left endpoint x D 0. Nevertheless, the
requirement that y.x/ be continuous on Œ0; c plays the role of such a condition. Be-
cause Yn.x/ ! 1 as x ! 0, the solution in Eq. (11) for ˛ > 0 can be continuous
at x D 0 only if B D 0, so
y.x/ D Jn.˛x/
to within a constant multiple. It remains only to impose the condition in Eq. (13) at
x D c.
It is convenient to distinguish the cases ˇ2 D 0 and ˇ2 ¤ 0. If ˇ2 D 0, then
Eq. (13) takes the simple form
y.c/ D 0:
(13a)
If ˇ2 ¤ 0, we multiply each term in Eq. (13) by c=ˇ2 and then write h D cˇ1=ˇ2 to
obtain the equivalent condition
hy.c/ C cy0.c/ D 0:
(13b)
We assume hereafter that h = 0.

10.4 Cylindrical Coordinate Problems
669
CASE 1:  D 0.
We ﬁrst consider the possibility of a zero eigenvalue  D 0. If
both  D 0 and n D 0, then Eq. (12) reduces to the equation .xy0/0 D 0 with general
solution
y.x/ D A ln x C B;
and continuity on Œ0; c requires that A D 0. But then Eq. (13a) implies that B D 0
as well, as does Eq. (13b) unless h D 0, in which case  D 0 is an eigenvalue with
associated eigenfunction y.x/  1.
If  D 0 but n > 0, then Eq. (12) is simply the equation
x2y00 C xy0  n2y D 0
with general solution (substituting the trial solution y D xk as in Section 9.7)
y.x/ D Axn C Bxn;
and continuity on Œ0; c requires that B D 0. But it is easy to check that y.x/ D
Axn satisﬁes neither Eq. (13a) nor Eq. (13b) unless A D 0. Thus  D 0 is not an
eigenvalue if n > 0. We have therefore shown that  D 0 is an eigenvalue of the
problem in (12)–(13) if and only if n D h D 0 and the endpoint condition at x D c
is y0.c/ D 0, in which case an associated eigenfunction is y.x/  1. In this case we
write
0 D 0
and
y0.x/  1:
CASE 2:  > 0.
If  > 0, then  D ˛2 > 0, and in this case the only solution of
Eq. (12) that is continuous on Œ0; c is, to within a constant multiple,
y.x/ D Jn.˛x/:
Then Eq. (13a) implies that Jn.˛c/ D 0; in other words, ˛c must be a positive root
of the equation
Jn.x/ D 0:
(14a)
Recall from Section 8.5 that the graphs of J0.x/ and J1.x/ look as indicated in
Fig. 10.4.2. The graph of Jn.x/ for n > 1 resembles that of J1.x/, even in the detail
that Jn.0/ D 0. In particular, for each n D 1, 2, 3, : : : ; Eq. (14a) has an increasing

In the important case n D 0, the ﬁrst ﬁve roots of Eq. (14b) for various values of h

that the problem in (12)–(13) has no negative eigenvalues. [For a proof, see the

Fourier-Bessel Series
Now that we know that the singular Sturm–Liouville problem in (12)–(13) has an
inﬁnite sequence of eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions similar to those of
a regular Sturm–Liouville problem, we can discuss eigenfunction expansions. In
either case 1 or case 2 of Fig. 10.4.3, we expect a piecewise smooth function f .x/
on Œ0; c to have an eigenfunction series of the form

while in the exceptional case 3, the series will also contain a constant term c0 corre-

hold (despite the fact that its hypotheses are not satisﬁed), then the eigenfunctions

With these coefﬁcients, series of the form in Eq. (15) are often called Fourier–

tion f .x/ satisﬁes the convergence conclusion of Theorem 3 of Section 10.1. That
is, it converges to the average value 1

hence to the value f .x/ at each interior point of continuity.
The Fourier–Bessel Coefﬁcients

Equation (25) is Bessel’s parametric equation of order zero, and its only continuous nontrivial
solutions on Œ0; c are of the form
R.r/ D AJ0.˛r/:
(27)
But the possible values of ˛ depend on the boundary conditions that are imposed.
CASE (a):
Zero Boundary Temperature. The condition u.c; t/ D 0 yields R.c/ D AJ0.˛c/ D

CASE (b):
Insulated Boundary. In this case no heat ever escapes from the heated cylinder,
so we certainly should ﬁnd that its temperature remains constant: u.r; t/  u0. Inasmuch as
ur.c; t/ D 0 implies that R0.c/ D 0, we have n D h D 0 in Eq. (14b), and hence case 3 in

Example 2
Suppose that a ﬂexible circular membrane of radius c vibrates under tension T in such a
way that its (normal) displacement u depends only on time t and the distance r from its
center. (This is the case of radial vibrations.) Then u D u.r; t/ satisﬁes the partial differential
equation
@2u

(35)
where a2 D T=, and u.c; t/ D 0 if the boundary of the membrane is ﬁxed. Find the natural
frequencies and normal modes of radial vibration of the membrane.
Solution
We apply the method of Section 10.3: Substitution of the function u.r; t/ D R.r/ sin !t in
Eq. (35) yields
!2R sin !t D a2

R00 sin !t C 1
r R0 sin !t

Thus ! and R.r/ must satisfy the equation
r2R00 C rR0 C !2
a2 r2R D 0;
(36)
as well as the condition R.c/ D 0 that follows from u.c; t/ D 0. Equation (36) is the parametric
Bessel equation of order zero with parameter ˛ D !=a, and its only nontrivial solution is (to
within a constant multiple)
R.r/ D J0

hence

so !c=a must be one of the positive roots fng1

(37)
On inspection of the table of values of fng in Fig. 10.4.5, we see that the higher natural
frequencies !n are not integral multiples of !1 D 1a=c; this is why the sound of a vibrating
circular drumhead is not perceived as being harmonious. The vibration of the membrane in
the nth normal mode in (37) is illustrated in Fig. 10.4.6, which shows a vertical cross section
through the center of the drumhead. In addition to the boundary r D c, there are n  1 ﬁxed
circles, called nodal circles, with radii ri D ic=n, i D 1, 2, : : : ; n  1. The annular regions
of the membrane between consecutive pairs of nodal circles move alternately up and down
between the surfaces u D ˙J0.nr=c/. Figure 10.4.7 shows how the surface u D J0.nr=c/

The graph of u.r; 120/ in Fig. 10.4.11 shows how the temperature within the rod
after two minutes varies with the distance r from its center, and we see that the
centerline temperature has already fallen below 60ı. The graph of u.0; t/ for a ﬁve-
minute period shown in Fig. 10.4.12 indicates that the centerline temperature takes
a bit more than 200 seconds to fall to 25ı. Indeed, the computation
fsolve(u(0, t) = 25, t = 200..250);
reveals that this requires about 214 seconds.
For your own cylindrical rod with constant initial temperature u0 D 100ı to
investigate in the manner we illustrate, let c D 2p and k D q=10, where p is the
largest and q the smallest nonzero digit of your student ID number.
INVESTIGATION A:
If the cylindrical boundary of the rod is held at zero temper-
ature u.c; t/ D 0, plot graphs like Figs. 10.4.11 and 10.4.12, then determine how
long it will take for the rod’s centerline temperature to fall to 25ı.

boundary, so that the coefﬁcients in the series in (1) are those appearing in Eq. (34)

10.5 Higher-Dimensional Phenomena
In this section we discuss the application of the method of separation of variables
to heat ﬂow and vibration problems in which two or more space variables are in-
volved. The section consists largely of illustrative examples, problems, and projects
grouped according to whether rectangular, cylindrical, or spherical coordinates are
most appropriate for their solutions.
Rectangular Coordinate Applications and Two-Dimensional
Fourier Series
As indicated in Section 9.7, the Laplacian in two dimensions takes the form
r 2u D @2u
@x2 C @2u
@y2 :
For instance, consider a thin plate lying in the xy-plane with its two parallel faces
insulated, so that heat ﬂows within the plate only in the x- and y-directions. If
u.x; y; t/ denotes the temperature at time t at the point .x; y/ within the plate, then
under standard assumptions it follows that u satisﬁes the two-dimensional heat
equation
@u
@t D kr 2u D k
@2u
@x2 C @2u
@y2

:
(1)
Here k denotes the thermal diffusivity of the material comprising the plate. The heat
equation in (1) governs the change with time of temperatures within the plate. Note
that if @r=@t  0, then the heat equation reduces to Laplace’s equation r 2u D 0,
which (as in Section 9.7) determines the steady-state distribution of temperature in
the plate.
If the plate is rectangular and homogeneous boundary conditions are imposed
along its four edges, then the method of separation of variables can be applied in a
straightforward manner.

Chapter 10 Eigenvalue Methods and Boundary Value Problems
Example 1
Suppose that a thin rectangular plate occupies the plane region 0 5 x 5 a, 0 5 y 5 b, that its
top and bottom faces are insulated, and that its four edges are held at temperature zero. If the
plate has the initial temperature function u.x; y; 0/ D f .x; y/, then its temperature function
u.x; y; t/ satisﬁes the boundary value problem consisting of the heat equation in (1) and the
boundary conditions

to verify that each such graph is symmetric with respect to the midline y D b=2, so it
follows (why?) that the maximum temperature in the plate occurs at a point of this

Vibrations of Rectangular Membranes
Now let’s consider a two-dimensional ﬂexible membrane whose equilibrium po-
sition occupies a region in the horizontal xy-plane. Suppose that this membrane
vibrates up and down, with u.x; y; t/ denoting the vertical (normal) displacement
of the point .x; y/ of the membrane at time t. If T and  denote the membrane’s
tension and density (per unit area), respectively, then under standard assumptions it
follows that its displacement function u.x; y; t/ satisﬁes the two-dimensional wave

dinates is advantageous. In Section 9.7 we discussed the expression of the two-
dimensional Laplacian in terms of the familiar plane polar coordinates .r; / for
which x D r cos  and y D r sin . Recall from Eq. (1) in Section 10.4 that the

dinates is given by

For your personal heated cylinder to investigate numerically, take u0 D 100, h D

smallest nonzero digit in your student ID number. Assume zero boundary temper-
atures as in Problems 5 and 6. Plot the surface ´ D u.r; ´; t/ for typical values of t
to substantiate the physically plausible conjecture that, at any time t, the maximum
temperature within the cylinder occurs at its center point, where r D 0 and ´ D h=2.
It may help to also plot graphs of
1. u as a function of r with ´ D h=2 and t constant; and
2. u as a function of ´ with r D 0 and t constant.
Then determine how long it takes for the maximum temperature within the cylinder
to fall to 25ı.
Repeat this investigation with the temperature held at zero on the cylinder’s

PROJECT D

If the membrane is released from rest at time t D 0 and thereafter its boundary

Because the odd-degree Legendre polynomials have only terms of odd degree, it
follows from Eq. (67) that the buoy has a constant average temperature of 15ı on its
water-level cross section (where  D =2). As a ﬁrst step in using the series in (67)
to investigate the temperature distribution within the buoy, sum enough terms to plot
u as a function u.´/ of height x (1 5 ´ 5 1) on the vertical axis of symmetry of the
buoy. Knowing that u.0/ D 15, ﬁnd the numerical values of ´ for which u D 12:5ı
and u D 17:5ı.
The buoy problem is more interesting if the speciﬁc gravity of the buoy is
less than half that of water, 0 < ı < 0:5, so the buoy lies higher in the water as in
Fig. 10.5.11. Archimedes’ law of buoyancy implies that the buoy ﬂoats with the
fraction ı of its total volume 4=3 submerged. Hence the part of the buoy lying
beneath the waterline has volume V D 4ı=3. But this volume also is given by the

evaluate the integrals in (69). For instance, the Mathematica command

(10NIntegrate[LegendreP[n,x], {x, --1, h -- 1}] +
20NIntegrate[LegendreP[n,x], {x, h -- 1, 1}])

With ı chosen so that h D 0:5, the partial sum consisting of 50 terms in (71) was

increasing nonlinearly from u.1/ D 10 to u.1/ D 20. Using the Mathematica
FindRoot function we ﬁnd that u.0:6335/  12:5, u.0:3473/  15, and u.0/ D

Now the temperature at the center point of the buoy’s cross section at the
waterline is u.0:5/  13:6603 (rather than the average temperature of 15ı that one
might naively expect). In Fig. 10.5.13 we see that

substituting these expressions for  and  in a 50-term partial sum of the series

Existence and Uniqueness
of Solutions
In Chapter 1 we saw that an initial value problem of the form
dy
dx D f .x; y/;
y.a/ D b
(1)
can fail (on a given interval containing the point x D a) to have a unique solution.
For instance, the answer to Problem 33 in Section 1.3 says that the initial value
problem
x2 dy
dx C y2 D 0;
y.0/ D b
(2)
has no solutions at all unless b D 0, in which case there are inﬁnitely many solutions.
According to Problem 31 of Section 1.3, the initial value problem
dy
dx D 
p
1  y2;
y.0/ D 1
(3)
has the two distinct solutions y1.x/  1 and y2.x/ D cos x on the interval 0 5 x 5 .
In this appendix we investigate conditions on the function f .x; y/ that sufﬁce to
guarantee that the initial value problem in (1) has one and only one solution, and
then proceed to establish appropriate versions of the existence-uniqueness theorems
that were stated without proof in Sections 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, and 4.1.
A.1 Existence of Solutions
The approach we employ is the method of successive approximations, which was
developed by the French mathematician Emile Picard (1856–1941). This method is
based on the fact that the function y.x/ satisﬁes the initial value problem in (1) on
the open interval I containing x D a if and only if it satisﬁes the integral equation
y.x/ D b C
Z x
a
f .t; y.t// dt
(4)
for all x in I. In particular, if y.x/ satisﬁes Eq. (4), then clearly y.a/ D b, and
differentiation of both sides in (4)—using the fundamental theorem of calculus—
yields the differential equation y0.x/ D f .x; y.x//.
701

702
Appendix
To attempt to solve Eq. (4), we begin with the initial function
y0.x/  b
(5)
and then deﬁne iteratively a sequence y1, y2, y3, : : : of functions that we hope will
converge to the solution. Speciﬁcally, we let
y1.x/ D b C
Z x
a
f .t; y0.t// dt
and
y2.x/ D b C
Z x
a
f .t; y1.t// dt:
(6)
In general, ynC1 is obtained by substitution of yn for y in the right-hand side in
Eq. (4):
ynC1.x/ D b C
Z x
a
f .t; yn.t// dt:
(7)
Suppose we know that each of these functions fyn.x/g1
0 is deﬁned on some open
interval (the same for each n) containing x D a, and that the limit
y.x/ D lim
n!1 yn.x/
(8)
exists at each point of this interval. Then it will follow that
y.x/ D lim
n!1 ynC1.x/ D lim

(10)
and hence that
y.x/ D b C

provided that we can validate the interchange of limit operations involved in passing
from (9) to (10). It is therefore reasonable to expect that, under favorable conditions,
the sequence fyn.x/g deﬁned iteratively in Eqs. (5) and (7) will converge to a so-
lution y.x/ of the integral equation in (4), and hence to a solution of the original
initial value problem in (1).

It is clear that we are generating the sequence of partial sums of a power series solution;
indeed, we immediately recognize the series as that of y.x/ D ex. There is no difﬁculty in
demonstrating that the exponential function is indeed the solution of the initial value problem
in (11); moreover, a diligent student can verify (using a proof by induction on n) that yn.x/,
obtained in the aforementioned manner, is indeed the nth partial sum for the Taylor series
with center zero for y.x/ D ex.

It is again clear that we are generating partial sums of a power series solution. It is not quite

In some cases it may be necessary to compute a much large number of terms,
either in order to identify the solution or to use a partial sum of its series with large
subscript to approximate the solution accurately for x near its initial value. Fortu-
nately, computer algebra systems such as Maple and Mathematica can perform the
symbolic integrations (as opposed to numerical integrations) of the sort in Examples
1 and 2. If necessary, you could generate the ﬁrst hundred terms in Example 2 in a
matter of minutes.
In general, of course, we apply Picard’s method because we cannot ﬁnd a
solution by elementary methods. Suppose that we have produced a large number of
terms of what we believe to be the correct power series expansion of the solution.

Appendix
We must have conditions under which the sequence fyn.x/g provided by the method
of successive approximations is guaranteed in advance to converge to a solution. It
is just as convenient to discuss the initial value problem

It turns out that with the aid of this vector notation (which we introduced in Sec-

generalized readily to analogous results for a system of m ﬁrst-order equations, as
abbreviated in (15). Consequently, the effort of using vector notation is amply jus-
tiﬁed by the generality it provides.
The method of successive approximations for the system in (15) calls for us

The key to establishing convergence in the method of successive approxima-
tions is an appropriate condition on the rate at which f.x; t/ changes when x varies
but t is held ﬁxed. If R is a region in .m C 1/-dimensional .x; t/-space, then the
function f.x; t/ is said to be Lipschitz continuous on R if there exists a constant
k > 0 such that
jf.x1; t/  f.x2; t/j 5 kjx1  x2j
(20)
if .x1; t/ and .x2; t/ are points of R. Recall that the norm of an m-dimensional point
or vector x is deﬁned to be
jxj D
q
x2
1 C x2
2 C x2
3 C    C x2m:
(21)
Then jx1  x2j is simply the Euclidean distance between the points x1 and x2.
Example 4
Let f .x; t/ D x2 exp

t2	 sin t and let R be the strip 0 5 x 5 2 in the xy-plane. If .x1; t/
and .x2; t/ are both points of R, then
jf .x1; t/  f .x2; t/j D j exp

t2
sin tj  jx1 C x2j  jx1  x2j 5 4jx1  x2j;
because
ˇˇexp

t2	 sin t
ˇˇ 5 1 for all t and jx1 C x2j 5 4 if x1 and x2 are both in the interval
Œ0; 2. Thus f satisﬁes the Lipschitz condition in (20) with k D 4 and is therefore Lipschitz
continuous in the strip R.
Example 5
Let f .x; t/ D tpx on the rectangle R consisting of the points .x; t/ in the xt-plane for which
0 5 x 5 1 and 0 5 t 5 1. Then, taking x1 D x, x2 D 0, and t D 1, we ﬁnd that
jf .x; 1/  f .0; 1/j D px D
1
px jx  0j:
Because x1=2 ! C1 as x ! 0C, we see that the Lipschitz condition in (20) cannot be
satisﬁed by any (ﬁnite) constant k > 0. Thus the function f , though obviously continuous on
R, is not Lipschitz continuous on R.
Suppose, however, that the function f .x; t/ has a continuous partial derivative
fx.x; t/ on the closed rectangle R in the xt-plane, and denote by k the maximum
value of jfx.x; t/j on R. Then the mean value theorem of differential calculus yields
jf .x1; t/  f .x2; t/j D jfx.x; t/  .x1  x2/j
for some x in .x1; x2/, so it follows that
jf .x1; t/  f .x2; t/j 5 kjx1  x2j
because jfx.x; t/j 5 k. Thus a continuously differentiable function f .x; t/ deﬁned
on a closed rectangle is Lipschitz continuous there. More generally, the multivari-
able mean value theorem of advanced calculus can be used similarly to prove that a
vector-valued function f.x; t/ with continuously differentiable component functions
on a closed rectangular region R in .x; t/-space is Lipschitz continuous on R.

706
Appendix
Example 6
The function f .x; t/ D x2 is Lipschitz continuous on any closed [bounded] region in the
xt-plane. But consider this function on the inﬁnite strip R consisting of the points .x; t/ for
which 0 5 t 5 1 and x is arbitrary. Then

Because jx1 C x2j can be made arbitrarily large, it follows that f is not Lipschitz continuous
on the inﬁnite strip R.
If I is an interval on the t-axis, then the set of all points .x; t/ with t in I is an
inﬁnite strip or slab in .m C 1/-space (as indicated in Fig. A.1). Example 6 shows
that Lipschitz continuity of f.x; t/ on such an inﬁnite slab is a very strong condition.
Nevertheless, the existence of a solution of the initial value problem
dx
dt D f.x; t/;
x.a/ D b
(15)
under the hypothesis of Lipschitz continuity of f in such a slab is of considerable
importance.
THEOREM 1
Global Existence of Solutions
Let f be a vector-valued function (with m components) of m C 1 real variables,
and let I be a [bounded or unbounded] open interval containing t D a. If f.x; t/
is continuous and satisﬁes the Lipschitz condition in (20) for all t in I and for
all x1 and x2, then the initial value problem in (15) has a solution on the [entire]
interval I.
Proof:
We want to show that the sequence fxn.t/g1
0 of successive approxi-
mations determined iteratively by
x0.a/ D b;
xnC1.t/ D b C
Z t
0
f.xn.s/; s/ ds
(16)
converges to a solution x.t/ of (15). We see that each of these functions in turn is
continuous on I, as each is an [indeﬁnite] integral of a continuous function.
We may assume that a D 0, because the transformation t ! t C a converts
(15) into an equivalent problem with initial point t D 0. Also, we will consider only
the portion t = 0 of the interval I; the details for the case t 5 0 are very similar.
The main part of the proof consists in showing that if Œ0; T  is a closed (and
bounded) interval contained in I, then the sequence fxn.t/g converges uniformly on
Œ0; T  to a limit function x.t/. This means that, given 
 > 0, there exists an integer
N such that
jxn.t/  x.t/j < 
(22)
for all n = N and all t in Œ0; T . For ordinary (perhaps nonuniform) convergence
the integer N, for which (22) holds for all n = N, may depend on t, with no single
value of N working for all t in I. Once this uniform convergence of the sequence
fxn.t/g has been established, the following conclusions will follow from standard
theorems of advanced calculus (see pages 620–622 of A. E. Taylor and W. R. Mann,
Advanced Calculus, 3rd ed. (New York: John Wiley, 1983)):
1. The limit function x.t/ is continuous on Œ0; T .

Appendix
707
2. If N is so chosen that the inequality in (22) holds for n = N, then the Lipschitz
continuity of f implies that
jf.xn.t/; t/  f.x.t/; t/j 5 kjxn.t/  x.t/j < k
for all t in Œ0; T  and n = N, so it follows that the sequence ff.xn.t/; t/g1
0
converges uniformly to f.x.t/; t/ on Œ0; T .
3. But a uniformly convergent sequence or series can be integrated termwise, so
it follows that, on taking limits in the iterative formula in (16),
x.t/ D lim
n!1 xnC1.t/ D b C lim
n!1
Z t
0
f.xn.s/; s/ ds
D b C
Z t
0
lim
n!1 f.xn.s/; s/ dsI
thus
x.t/ D b C
Z t
0
f.x.s/; s/ ds:
(23)
4. Because the function x.t/ is continuous on Œ0; T , the integral equation in (23)
(analogous to the one-dimensional case in (4)) implies that x0.t/ D f.x.t/; t/
on Œ0; T . But if this is true on every closed subinterval of the open interval I,
then it is true on the entire interval I as well.
It therefore remains only to prove that the sequence fxn.t/g1
0 converges uni-
formly on the closed interval Œ0; T . Let M be the maximum value of jf.b; t/j for t
in Œ0; T . Then

which is a series of positive constants. It therefore follows (from the Weierstrass
M-test on pages 618–619 of Taylor and Mann) that the series in (27) converges
uniformly on Œ0; T . But the sequence of partial sums of this series is simply our
original sequence fxn.t/g1
0 of successive approximations, so the proof of Theorem
1 is ﬁnally complete.
A.2 Linear Systems
An important application of the global existence theorem just given is to the initial
value problem
dx
dt D A.t/x C g.t/;
x.a/ D b
(29)
for a linear system, where the m  m matrix-valued function A.t/ and the vector-
valued function g.t/ are continuous on a [bounded or unbounded] open interval I
containing the point t D a. In order to apply Theorem 1 to the linear system in (29),
we note ﬁrst that the proof of Theorem 1 requires only that, for each closed and
bounded subinterval J of I, there exists a Lipschitz constant k such that
jf.x1; t/  f.x2; t/j 5 kjx1  x2j
(20)
for all t in J (and all x1 and x2). Thus we do not need a single Lipschitz constant
for the entire open interval I.
In (29) we have f.x; t/ D A.t/x C g, so
f.x1; t/  f.x2; t/ D A.t/.x1  x2/:
(30)
It therefore sufﬁces to show that, if A.t/ is continuous on the closed and bounded
interval J, then there is a constant k such that
jA.t/xj 5 kjxj
(31)
for all t in J. But this follows from the fact (Problem 17) that
jAxj 5 kAk  jxj;

existence theorem for the linear initial value problem in (29).
THEOREM 2
Existence for Linear Systems
Let the m  m matrix-valued function A.t/ and the vector-valued function g.t/ be
continuous on the [bounded or unbounded] open interval I containing the point
t D a. Then the initial value problem
dx
dt D A.t/x C g.t/;
x.a/ D b
(29)
has a solution on the [entire] interval I.
As we saw in Section 4.1, the mth-order initial value problem
x.m/ C a1.t/x.m1/ C    C am1.t/x0 C am.t/x D p.t/;
x.a/ D b0;
x0.a/ D b1;
: : : ;
x.m1/.a/ D bm1
(34)
is readily transformed into an equivalent m  m system of the form in (29). It there-
fore follows from Theorem 2 that if the functions a1.t/; a2.t/; : : : ; am.t/ and p.t/ in
(34) are all continuous on the [bounded or unbounded] open interval I containing
t D a, then the initial value problem in (34) has a solution on the [entire] interval I.
A.3 Local Existence
In the case of a nonlinear initial value problem
dx
dt D f.x; t/;
x.a/ D b;
(35)
the hypothesis in Theorem 1 that f satisﬁes a Lipschitz condition on a slab .x; t/ (t in
I, all x) is unrealistic and rarely satisﬁed. This is illustrated by the following simple
example.
Example 1
Consider the initial value problem
dy
dx D x2;
x.0/ D b > 0:
(36)
As we saw in Example 6, the equation x0 D x2 does not satisfy a “strip Lipschitz condition.”
When we solve (36) by separation of variables, we get
x.t/ D
b
1  bt :
(37)
Because the denominator vanishes for t D 1=b, Eq. (37) provides a solution of the initial
value problem in (36) only for t < 1=b, despite the fact that the differential equation x0 D x2
“looks nice” on the entire real line—certainly the function appearing on the right-hand side
of the equation is continuous everywhere. In particular, if b is large, then we have a solution
only on a very small interval to the right of t D 0.

710
Appendix
Although Theorem 2 assures us that linear equations have global solutions,
Example 7 shows that, in general, even a “nice” nonlinear differential equation
can be expected to have a solution only on a small interval around the initial point
t D a, and that the length of this interval of existence can depend on the initial
value x.a/ D b, as well as on the differential equation itself. The reason is this: If
f.x; t/ is continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of the point .b; a/ in .mC1/-
dimensional space, then—as indicated in the discussion preceding Example 6—we
can conclude that f.x; t/ satisﬁes a Lipschitz condition on some rectangular region
R centered at .b; a/, of the form
jt  aj < A;
jxi  bij < Bi
(38)
.i D 1; 2; : : : ; m). In the proof of Theorem 1, we need to apply the Lipschitz condi-
tion on the function f in analyzing the iterative formula
xnC1.t/ D b C
Z t
a
f.xn.s/; s/ ds:
(39)
The potential difﬁculty is that unless the values of t are suitably restricted, then the
point .xn.t/; t/ appearing in the integrand in (39) may not lie in the region R where f
is known to satisfy a Lipschitz condition. On the other hand, it can be shown that—
on a sufﬁciently small open interval J containing the point t D a—the graphs of the
functions fxn.t/g given iteratively by the formula in (39) remain within the region
R, so the proof of convergence can then be carried out as in the proof of Theorem
1. A proof of the following local existence theorem can be found in Chapter 6 of
G. Birkhoff and G.-C. Rota, Ordinary Differential Equations, 2nd ed. (New York:
John Wiley, 1969).
THEOREM 3
Local Existence of Solutions
Let f be a vector-valued function (with m components) of the m C 1 real variables
x1; x2; : : : ; xm, and t. If the ﬁrst-order partial derivatives of f all exist and are
continuous in some neighborhood of the point x D b, t D a, then the initial value
problem
dx
dt D f.x; t/;
x.a/ D b;
(35)
has a solution on some open interval containing the point t D a.
A.4 Uniqueness of Solutions
It is possible to establish the existence of solutions of the initial value problem in
(35) under the much weaker hypothesis that f.x; t/ is merely continuous; techniques
other than those used in this section are required. By contrast, the Lipschitz con-
dition that we used in proving Theorem 1 is the key to uniqueness of solutions. In
particular, the solution provided by Theorem 3 is unique near the point t D a.

Appendix
711
THEOREM 4
Uniqueness of Solutions
Suppose that on some region R in (m C 1/-space, the function f in (35) is contin-
uous and satisﬁes the Lipschitz condition
jf.x1; t/  f.x2; t/j 5 k  jx1  x2j:
(20)
If x1.t/ and x2.t/ are two solutions of the initial problem in (35) on some open
interval I containing x D a, such that the solution curves .x1.t/; t/ and .x2.t/; t/
both lie in R for all t in I, then x1.t/ D x2.t/ for all t in I.
We will outline the proof of Theorem 4 for the one-dimensional case in which
x is a real variable. A generalization of this proof to the multivariable case can be
found in Chapter 6 of Birkhoff and Rota.
Let us consider the function
.t/ D Œx1.t/  x2.t/2
(40)
for which .a/ D 0, because x1.a/ D x2.a/ D b. We want to show that .t/  0, so
that x1.t/  x2.t/. We will consider only the case t = a; the details are similar for
the case t 5 a.
If we differentiate each side in Eq. (40), we ﬁnd that
j0.t/
ˇˇ D j2Œx1.t/  x2.t/  Œx0
1.t/  x0

5 2kjx1.t/  x2.t/j2 D 2k.t/;
using the Lipschitz condition on f . Hence
0.t/ 5 2k.t/:
(41)
Now let us temporarily ignore the fact that .a/ D 0 and compare .t/ with the
solution of the differential equation
ˆ0.t/ D 2kˆ.t/
(42)
such that ˆ.a/ D .a/; clearly
ˆ.t/ D ˆ.a/e2k.ta/:
(43)
In comparing (41) with (42), it seems inevitable that
.t/ 5 ˆ.t/
for t = a,
(44)
and this is easily proved (Problem 18). Hence
0 5 Œx1.t/  x2.t/2 5 Œx1.a/  x2.a/2e2k.ta/:
On taking square roots, we get
0 5 jx1.t/  x2.t/j 5 jx1.a/  x2.a/jek.ta/:
(45)
But x1.a/  x2.a/ D 0, so (45) implies that x1.t/  x2.t/.

712
Appendix
Example 1
The initial value problem
dx
dt D 3x2=3;
x.0/ D 0
(46)
has both the obvious solution x1.t/  0 and the solution x2.t/ D t3 that is readily found by
separation of variables. Hence the function f .x; t/ must fail to satisfy a Lipschitz condition
near .0; 0/. Indeed, the mean value theorem yields
jf .x; 0/  f .0; 0/j D jfx.x; 0/j  jx  0j
for some x between 0 and x. But fx.x; 0/ D 2x1=3 is unbounded as x ! 0, so no Lipschitz
condition can be satisﬁed.
A.5 Well-Posed Problems and Mathematical Models
In addition to uniqueness, another consequence of the inequality in (45) is the fact
that solutions of the differential equation
dx
dt D f .x; t/
(47)
depend continuously on the initial value x.a/; that is, if x1.t/ and x2.t/ are two
solutions of (47) on the interval a 5 t 5 T such that the initial values x1.a/ and
x2.a/ are sufﬁciently close to one another, then the values of x1.t/ and x2.t/ remain
close to one another. In particular, if jx1.a/  x2.a/j 5 ı, then (45) implies that
jx1.t/  x2.t/j 5 ıek.T a/ D 
(48)
for all t with a 5 t 5 T . Obviously, we can make 
 as small as we wish by choosing
ı sufﬁciently close to zero.
This continuity of solutions of (47) with respect to initial values is important
in practical applications where we are unlikely to know the initial value x0 D x.a/
with absolute precision. For example, suppose that the initial value problem
dx
dt D f .x; t/;
x.a/ D x0
(49)
models a population for which we know only that the initial population is within
ı > 0 of the assumed value x0. Then even if the function f .x; t/ is accurate, the so-
lution x.t/ of (49) will be only an approximation to the actual population. But (45)
implies that the actual population at time t will be within ıek.T a/ of the approxi-
mate population x.t/. Thus, on a given closed interval Œa; T , x.t/ will be a close
approximation to the actual population provided that ı > 0 is sufﬁciently small.
An initial value problem is usually considered well posed as a mathematical
model for a real-world situation only if the differential equation has unique solutions
that are continuous with respect to initial values. Otherwise it is unlikely that the
initial value problem adequately mirrors the real-world situation.
An even stronger “continuous dependence” of solutions is often desirable. In
addition to possible inaccuracy in the initial value, the function f .x; t/ may not
model precisely the physical situation. For instance, it may involve physical pa-
rameters (such as resistance coefﬁcients) whose values cannot be measured with
absolute precision. Birkhoff and Rota generalize the proof of Theorem 4 to estab-
lish the following result.

Appendix

THEOREM 5
Continuous Dependence of Solutions
Let x.t/ and y.t/ be solutions of the equations
dx
dt D f.x; t/
and
dy
dt D g.y; t/
(50)
on the closed interval Œa; T . Let f and g be continuous for a 5 t 5 T and for x
and y in a common region D of n-space and assume that f satisﬁes the Lipschitz
condition in (20) on the region D. If
jf.z; t/  g.z; t/j 5 
(51)
for all t in the interval Œa; T  and all z in D, it then follows that
jx.t/  y.t/j 5 jx.a/  y.a/j  ek.ta/ C 
k
h
ek.ta/  1
i
(52)
on the interval Œa; T .
If  > 0 is small, then (51) implies that the functions f and g appearing in the
two differential equations, though different, are “close” to each other. If 
 > 0 is
given, then it is apparent from (52) that
jx.t/  y.t/j 5 
(53)
for all t in Œa; T  if both jx.a/  y.a/j and  are sufﬁciently small. Thus Theorem
5 says (roughly) that if both the two initial values and the two differential equations
in (50) are close to each other, then the two solutions remain close to each other for
a 5 t 5 T .
For example, suppose that a falling body is subject both to constant gravita-
tional acceleration g and to resistance proportional to some power of its velocity,
so (with the positive axis directed downward) its velocity v satisﬁes the differential
equation
dv
dt D g  cv:
(54)
Assume, however, that only an approximation c to the actual resistance c and an
approximation  to the actual exponent  are known. Then our mathematical model
is based on the differential equation
du
dt D g  cu
(55)
instead of the actual equation in (54). Thus if we solve Eq. (55), we obtain only
an approximation u.t/ to the actual velocity v.t/. But if the parameters c and  are
sufﬁciently close to the actual values c and , then the right-hand sides in (54) and
(55) will be close to each other. If so, then Theorem 5 implies that the actual and
approximate velocity functions v.t/ and u.t/ are close to each other. In this case the
approximation in (55) will be a good model of the actual physical situation.

For each of Problems 13 through 18 we show a plot of slope ﬁeld and
typical solution curves. The equilibrium solutions of the given
differential equation are labeled, and the stability or instability of
each should be clear from the picture.

25. With both step sizes h D 0:1 and h D 0:05, the approximate
velocity after 1 second is 15.962 ft/sec (80% of the limiting
velocity of 20 ft/sec); after 2 seconds it is 19.185 ft/sec (96% of
the limiting velocity).
26. With both step sizes h D 6 and h D 3, the approximate
population after 5 years is 49.3915 deer (65% of the limiting
population of 75 deer); after 10 years it is 66.1136 deer (88% of
the limiting population).
27. With successive step sizes h D 1; 0:1; 0:01; : : : the ﬁrst four
approximations to y.2/ we obtain are 1.05722, 1.00447,
1.00445and 1.00445. Thus it seems likely that y.2/  1:00445
accurate to 5 decimal places.
28. With successive step sizes h D 1; 0:1; 0:01; : : : the ﬁrst four
approximations to y.2/ we obtain are 1.48990, 1.46332,
1.46331, and 1.46331. Thus it seems likely that y.2/  1:4633
accurate to 5 decimal places.
