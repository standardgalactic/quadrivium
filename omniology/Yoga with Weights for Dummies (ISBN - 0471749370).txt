About the Authors
Sherri Baptiste is an inspirational teacher at the forefront of yoga training in
the United States. She was born into a rich heritage and family of pioneering
teachers; her parents, Magaña and Walt Baptiste, established yoga on the West
Coast in the mid-1950s. Her brother, Baron Baptiste, authored the book Journey
into Power: How to Sculpt Your Ideal Body, Free Your True Self, and Transform
Your Life With Yoga (Fireside). Sherri has been teaching yoga since her teens
and is the founder of “Baptiste Power of Yoga,” a nationally recognized yoga
method, as well as a yoga-with-weights teacher-training program and a yoga
teacher certification and advancing studies program recognized by Yoga
Alliance. Sherri presents classes and workshops throughout the United States;
she’s a presenter for Western Athletics’ Bay Clubs, Gold’s Gym, Nautilus,
Equinox, IDEA World Fitness, Body Mind Spirit, ECA; and she offers many yoga
retreats, including retreats at Kripalu, Omega, Haramara, Green Gulch Zen
Center, Rancho La Puerta Spa, and Feathered Pipe Ranch. A radio and televi-
sion personality, she’s featured in video, DVD, and CD “Power of Yoga” and
“Power of Meditation” programs. You can learn more about Sherri at the follow-
ing Web sites: www.powerofyoga.com and www.yogawithweights.com.
Megan Scott, PhD, is a doctor of integrative medicine, sports rehabilitation,
and clinical psychology specializing in advanced healing techniques. She has
20 years of training and practice in mind-body, self-regulation techniques. Dr.
Scott combines her knowledge of science and self-healing in her clinical set-
tings, highlighted by using the left/right brain neuro rebalancing technique
for self-healing. She teaches at California Pacific Medical Center, the Institute
for Health and Healing, and the University of the Pacific School of Dentistry.
She’s also a founder, director, and contributing researcher at the Chronic Pain
Institute. In her private practice, she teaches Anusara yoga and yoga therapy
classes, biofeedback training, and alternative psychotherapy. Her mission is
to assist her students in discovering their own greatness and to awaken her
students’ passion for yoga and all its gifts. 


Dedication
This book is dedicated to “The Spirit That Lives Within You.”

Authors’ Acknowledgments
Joint Acknowledgments: For the photographs in this book, we wish to thank
photographer Bonnie Kamin Morrisey for her expertise and her excellent
photos; a picture is worth a thousand words. Many thanks as well go to all
the models from Sherri’s yoga classes who posed for photographs: Linda
Prosche, Allan Carr, Marian Jung, Christine Bandettini, Nick Freeman, William
Keller, and Justine Rudman (and her baby within). We would also like to
thank Paula and Andy Valla for crossing the Iron Man Triathlon finish line in
Chapter 16 and for being our yoga-with-weights champions. Thanks as well
go to Carol Jones for handling the models’ makeup and to Stress Management
Center of Marin for its beautiful studio. We would also like to thank Magaña
Baptiste for the vintage photos of herself with her husband, Walt Baptiste. 
Project Editor Alissa Schwipps steered this book forward, Copy Editor Josh
Dials saw to its clarity, and Acquisitions Editor Mikal E. Belicove encouraged
us to take the leap of faith; we’re grateful to each of them. We also wish to
thank Linda Sparrowe, author and teacher, for serving as this book’s techni-
cal editor. The treats of good coffee and dark chocolate as we worked through
the pages of this book along with pets Bodhi, Sage, and Mollie are all in the
mix, too.
They say to see clearly, you should stand on the shoulders of a giant. Our
giant in this book is Peter Weverka. He’s our experienced wordsmith and
skilled writer who helped to sculpt and shape the information found on every
page of this book. We know of no other way to acknowledge our gratitude
and appreciation for his professionalism and guidance in the process of writ-
ing this book than to just say, “Thank you!” 
Additional Acknowledgments from Sherri: I wish to express my personal
gratitude to those who made this work possible. First, thanks to Larry Payne,
PhD, author and friend, for recommending me to Wiley Publishing. Larry told
me that writing a book takes on a unique story of its own with many wonder-
ful players in the story. I want to thank my “guiding light,” author Karen
Leland, for her guidance, friendship, and open heart, and Elson Haas, MD,
associate and friend, for giving his time and lending his support. Most of all,
my love, gratitude, and sincere appreciation go to Megan Scott, PhD, because
without her unending inspiration, contributions, and expertise in the science
of physiology, yoga, and physical culture, this book wouldn’t be what it is
today. We’ve developed new territory and solid groundwork together with
the revolutionary yoga-with-weights system.

I believe that the timeless principles and knowledge so relevant and perfect
for today — the principles found in this book — stem from those who walked
this path before us and pioneered the way. I’d like to thank my parents,
Magaña and Walt Baptiste, for all their love and encouragement through the
years; they are pioneers and giants in the fields of health and fitness, human
potential, and yoga. My love also goes to my sister Devi and my brother
Baron. I’m deeply grateful to my husband Michael David Freeman and our chil-
dren, Vanessa, Nicole, Nicholas, and Connor, for their support and great spirit
during the writing of this book. Most of all, my thanks — beyond words —
goes to all my students who, by their commitment and presence in class,
nudged me to grow and expand. As their teacher, I have the space to speak my
authentic voice and be true to who “I AM.” 
Additional Acknowledgments from Megan: I would like to thank Sherri
Baptiste, who shared her knowledge, beauty, and expertise in the elegant cre-
ation of this book. Without her blazing the way with her strong passion for
yoga and teaching, this book wouldn’t have been written. I thank her for all
the long hours of work we shared together in her home, for providing treats
and yummy coffee, for her patience and willingness to face the challenges
that come with writing a book, and for co-creation and friendship at its best. 
I would also like to acknowledge with love and gratitude my parents, who
have always encouraged and supported me in my life journey and have lived
the example for me to follow; my siblings, who have been my greatest cheer-
ing section; and my husband, Ben Messana, MD, who provided more techni-
cal support, medical expertise, and advisement than one could imagine.
Gratitude and appreciation also go to John Friend, my most cherished yoga
teacher, who taught me more than any book or degree could ever touch
upon; without his guidance and support in my yoga career, I wouldn’t be
where I am today. I offer love and gratitude to the Anusara yoga community
for providing encouragement, support, joy, and laughter, always helping each
other along the way; Desiree Rumbaugh, a masterful teacher who has taught
me depth and understanding of the principles of alignment and living life with
grace; and to my yoga students who have taught me so much — I honor and
value each and every one of them.

Yoga with Weights For Dummies

Introduction
Yoga with weights is the newest incarnation in a long line of yoga-
based exercise programs. Yoga itself is at least 5,000 years old; yoga
exercising — what we know as yoga postures — emerged about 600 years ago.
Over the centuries, yoga evolved as it traveled to new cultures, and its practi-
tioners have refined it. Yoga is based on universal principles that appeal to
its practitioners on every level — mentally, physically and spiritually. It
effects deep change. The discipline acquires a new significance for each gen-
eration that encounters it.
What’s different about yoga with weights? If you haven’t guessed already,
yoga-with-weights practitioners carry weights in their hands and strap
weights to their ankles as they exercise. Weights add another dimension to
yoga; they stabilize your body and engage you more deeply into the yoga
exercises. All the physical benefits of traditional yoga — muscle toning, 
balance, and flexibility — come faster because yoga with weights is more
intense and dynamic than traditional yoga. Yoga with weights creates a bal-
ance of strength and flexibility. You notice an increase in vitality and an over-
all sense of well-being. Each time you practice leaves you feeling a little bit
better, and, cumulatively, the workouts have enormous health benefits.
Like traditional yoga, yoga with weights is a practice of mind, body, breath,
and spirit. Within every exercise you have the ability to harness the power of
yoga and bring alive these great Eastern teachings in practical ways that will
serve you in your daily living. This book represents a golden opportunity to
start down the road to good health and well-being.
About This Book
Yoga with weights is a new exercise program. You won’t find the exercises we
describe in this book anywhere else. We have three goals in writing this book:
to clearly explain the benefits of yoga with weights, safely instruct you in the
practice, and motivate you to do the workouts.
Between us, we have 65 years of experience with yoga. Sherri, daughter of the
American yoga pioneers Walt and Magaña Baptiste, has been associated with
yoga since she took her first baby steps or assumed her first lotus position,

whichever came first. Sherri followed in her parents’ footsteps, founding
“Baptiste Power of Yoga,” a nationally recognized yoga method. Sherri has
been teaching since her teens and hosting yoga classes, workshops, and
retreats for 14 years. Megan, a doctor of integrative medicine, has 20 years of
training and practice in mind-body self-regulation techniques. She studied in
her college years with Walt Baptiste and has extensive training in Anusara
yoga, a discipline that specializes in living with grace and mastering the align-
ment principals. Megan has been teaching yoga therapy classes for ten years.
We called upon our collective experience with yoga, our understanding of
how to teach yoga, and our experience with physical culture practices to
create the exercises you find in this book. Some of the exercises are modifica-
tions of traditional yoga poses (the asanas); others are exercises we devel-
oped ourselves to complement traditional yoga. All the exercises are rooted
in the classic yoga principles that cultivate the quality of the mind as well as
the body. We want every exercise to strengthen your body, build your physi-
cal stamina, and cultivate your overall health and well-being. We also make
every effort to pay attention to your safety and not put you in a position
where you could injure yourself. As long as you follow our instructions, pay
attention to your breathing, and consciously remain aware of your body and
its needs in the course of exercising, you can be confident about doing your
yoga-with-weights workout without getting injured.
We divide the exercises into several different workouts. For example, we offer
practical exercises to relieve stress, plus stamina-building, total-body, and
energy workouts. We also provide instructions so you can create a yoga-with-
weights workout tailored to your health needs and goals. All the exercises in
this book are illustrated with photos so you know exactly how to move your
body in the exercises.
Another great feature of this book is that you don’t have to read it from start
to finish; you can dip in wherever your curiosity gets the best of you. The
table of contents and the index guide you in your quest to find the informa-
tion and exercises you need. Or, you can do it the old-fashioned way, reading
the book from cover to cover. It’s up to you.
Conventions Used in This Book
We want you to understand all the instructions in this book, and in that spirit,
we adopted a few conventions:
2
Yoga with Weights For Dummies 

 We explain exercises in numbered steps, which are formatted in bold.
Follow Step 1 first, and then Step 2 . . . just kidding, you know the drill.
But we do recommend you read through each exercise before diving in.
 Foreign terms, including Sanskrit terms, appear in italics. (Sanskrit is
considered the language of spirituality and is used in the ancient texts of
India, the country where yoga originated.) Don’t worry; we follow every
italicized term with a clear definition.
 All Web addresses appear in monofont for easy identification.
That’s not too many conventions, is it? You could almost say that this book is
unconventional.
Foolish Assumptions
Pardon us, but we made some assumptions about you, the readers of this
book. We assumed that
 You want to be in good health.
 You’re looking for a workout that will make you stronger, healthier, more
balanced, and more flexible.
 You have little or no background in yoga, yoga with weights, or
weightlifting.
 You want a book that explains yoga with weights in simple terms that
you can understand and put to good use easily.
 You want a practice for body, mind, and spirit, and you want to dive into
a deeper, more meaningful exercise practice.
 If you’re a senior citizen, you’re looking for exercise techniques that will
help you be stronger and more limber.
 If you’re pregnant, you want to exercise during your pregnancy so you
can have an easier childbirth and a healthier baby.
 If you’re in love with a certain sport — running, swimming, or baseball,
for example — you want to get better at the sport you love.
 If you’re a yoga or fitness instructor, you want to know what yoga with
weights is all about so you can teach it.
 Above all else, you want to feel great and look your best!

5
Introduction

We often offer a variation in an exercise — a little twist that makes the exer-
cise either more challenging or a little easier. We mark these variations with
the Alternative icon. When you see this icon, you discover a slightly different
way to do the exercise. We’re here for you in case you want to go the extra
mile and, in the case of difficult exercises, when the exercise may be too hard 
for you.
Where to Go from Here
This book doesn’t require a start-to-finish read. However, before you attempt
any workouts, we recommend that you check out Chapter 4, which explains
yoga-with-weights breathing; you’ll be pleasantly surprised to discover how
healthy and vital yoga-with-weights breathing makes you feel. We also recom-
mend you check out Chapter 6 about warming up, which all fitness experts
agree you should do before exercising.
Other than that, feel free to jump in where the jumping looks best. Think
you’re ready for your first yoga-with-weights workout? Go to Chapter 7 with-
out passing Go and without collecting $200. Do you need some background
information before you undertake yoga with weights? Go to Chapter 1, which
introduces this new type of yoga.
Do you have a health goal in mind? Whatever your health goals are, you can
find a yoga-with-weights workout in this book to help you on the road to good
health. Here are some common health goals and where you should turn in
this book to meet those goals:
 Lose weight. Who doesn’t want to lose a few pounds? See Chapter 11,
the Endurance Workout, and Chapter 12, the Belly-Burner Workout.

age you to take up yoga with weights. We think, no, we know you’ll love it!
In the Beginning, There Was Yoga . . .
Long before people started working out to dance videos or even doing calis-
thenics, there was yoga — a system of personal development and spiritual
practice that began in India at least 5,000 years ago.
You thought yoga was an exercise program, didn’t you? If so, you’re right. 
You can get enormous health benefits from yoga exercises, called poses or
postures, without going into the spiritual side of yoga.

But yoga is more than an exercise program. Yoga means “union” or “to inte-
grate” in Sanskrit (the language of yoga). Yoga addresses the whole person,
cultivating the mind, the body, and the spiritual potential that you have
inside. Classic yoga practitioners seek to be integrated with universal con-
sciousness. They believe that life is a process of purposeful evolution toward
a state of self-realization. To achieve this state, they study and live the eight
limbs of yoga, or the eightfold path (see the upcoming sidebar for more on
this topic). Meditation is one of the vital limbs in this system. The exercise
side of yoga emerged about 600 years ago to prepare yoga practitioners for
meditation. Sitting for hours in yoga meditation is common, and to make
themselves strong enough and supple enough to sit in meditation for long
periods of time, yoga practitioners developed yoga poses, or asanas in
Sanskrit. The poses are only one part of a much larger personal development
system that over time becomes a rich lifestyle, but in the Western part of the
world, most people think of exercises when they hear the word “yoga.”
10
Part I: Getting Started 
The eight limbs of yoga
To work toward the goal of self-realization, yoga
practitioners study the following eight limbs of
yoga and integrate them into their lives:
 Yama: The code of ethics by which practi-
tioners measure and monitor their behavior.
Practitioners refrain from injuring others,
lying, stealing, being greedy, and engaging
in sensual activities.
 Niyamas: The observances by which prac-
titioners control their mental energy and
develop willpower. The observances are
defined as purification, contentment, aus-
terity, sacred study, and attunement to the
absolute.
 Asanas: The poses, or exercises, that con-
stitute the physical aspect of yoga. The
exercises help develop the mind-body rela-
tionship and build physical strength, flexi-
bility, and balance.
 Pranayama: The science of Prana (the life
force) and its correlation to breathing. By
controlling their breathing, practitioners
discover how to control their thought
processes.
 Pratyahara: A series of breathing exercises
and techniques by which practitioners sep-
arate consciousness from sensual percep-
tion. The goal is to withdraw the conscious
mind from the bondage of the physical body
and its instinctual drives.
 Dharana: A series of breathing techniques
and exercises, including mantra, designed
to develop endurance through conscious
effort and the power of concentration.
 Dhyana: A series of breathing techniques
and exercises designed to help practition-
ers reach an effortless state of meditation.
 Samadhi: Advanced breathing exercises
and techniques designed to return the indi-
vidual consciousness to perfect divine
unity.

Chapter 1: Introducing Yoga with Weights
Yoga schools at a glance
No yoga school is better than another; which
one you choose to study is simply a matter of
personal preference. More important than any
yoga school is the student-teacher relationship.
The differences between schools usually have
to do with emphasis. For example, some schools
place more emphasis on the alignment of the
body, the coordination of breath and movement,
holding postures, or the transition from one pos-
ture to another.
Roughly speaking, here are the different yoga
schools:
 Ananda: Developed by Swami Kriyananda,
a direct disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda.
The emphasis is on self-realization.
 Anusara: As taught by John Friend, this
school focuses on flowing with grace 
and is based on principles and spirals of
alignment.
 Ashtanga:
Developed by K. Pattabhi 
Jois, this yoga gives you a serious athletic
workout.
 Baptiste Method of Yoga: Developed by
Magaña and Walt Baptiste, this school is
based on Raja yoga; the focus is on mind
and meditation.
 Baptiste Power of Yoga: Developed by
Sherri Baptiste, this school brings together
flowing postures, breathing techniques, and
yoga philosophy.
 Bikram: Developed by Bikram Choudhury,
this school presents a series of 26 static-
holding postures practiced in a room
heated to 110° Fahrenheit.
 Himalayan Institute: Developed by Swami
Rama from a lineage of sages of the ancient
cave monasteries of the Himalayas, the
focus is on meditation.
 Integral: Swami Satchidananda’s Integral
yoga is a major componenet of Dr. Dean
Ornish’s groundbreaking work on reversing
heart disease.
 Iyengar: Developed by B.K.S. Iyengar, this
school emphasizes attention to detail and
the precise alignment of postures.
 Kripalu: This school puts great emphasis on
proper breathing, alignment, and the coor-
dination of breath and movement.
 Kundalini: Developed by Yogi Bhajan, this
school emphasizes classic poses, breath-
ing, the coordination of breath and move-
ment, and meditation.
 Paramahansa Yogananda: This is the Kriya
yoga self-realization fellowship; the empha-
sis is on the spiritual and on meditation.
 Power Vinyasa Yoga: Developed by Baron
Baptiste, this is a sweat-based, synchro-
nized, dynamic-flow yoga practiced in a
room heated to 85–90°F.
 Power Yoga: This school is based on the
Ashtanga repetitive series of postures.
 Sivananda: This school follows a set struc-
ture that includes pranayama, classic
asanas, and relaxation.
 Viniyoga: Developed by Sri T. Krishna-
macharya and carried on by his son, T.K.V.
Desikachar, this school is a methodology for
developing practices for individual condi-
tions and purposes.
 Vivekananda: This school offers a spiritual
brand of yoga.

From a practical point of view, part of the appeal of yoga comes from the
stress reduction that occurs while practicing the postures and concentrating
on the breathing, which we discuss in detail in Chapter 4. Practice yoga long
enough and you’ll discover that yoga is a personal journey as well; you notice
an overall sense of well-being and peace of mind. Yoga can help you relax,
feel more grounded, and experience more joy in your life. For that reason, it
benefits not only your mental and physical health, but also the quality of
your work and daily life.
In this book, we focus mostly on the physical aspects of yoga with weights. We
want you to know that the techniques, exercises, and practices you experience
in this system aren’t watered down; they’re the real deal for body, mind, and
spirit. If you’re interested in discovering more about the philosophical and spir-
itual aspects of yoga, we recommend Yoga For Dummies, by Georg Feuerstein
and Larry Payne (Wiley).
As a spiritual practice and exercise program, yoga continues to evolve, with
new schools of yoga and new exercise variations prospering every day. Enter
yoga with weights!
. . . And Now There’s Yoga with Weights
Yoga with weights is a hybrid of two powerful, time-tested exercise systems:
yoga and bodybuilding. Working out with weights is one of the best ways to
achieve overall physical fitness, and yoga is renowned as a system of per-
sonal development by which you can cultivate peak performance and achieve
a higher quality of life. By combining these exercise systems, yoga with
weights addresses the needs of your body, but it also goes beyond the physi-
cal dimension of your well-being.
Yoga with weights calls for 1-, 3-, or 5-pounds weights on your wrists and/or
ankles. The weights stabilize your body and help you achieve a higher level
of physical benefit and conditioning. Yoga with weights is a system for the
body, mind, and spirit. If you practice diligently, it can be a way of being and
living through conscious exercise that leads you to discover your true self.
The addition of the weights makes you feel the effect of the yoga training
sooner. The weights train your muscles where to be and where to go. In a
beginning yoga practice, several months could go by before you start to “get
it.” You have to figure out how and where to move different parts of your
body. It doesn’t take you as long to understand what yoga is about when you
practice yoga with weights, because the weights help you move your body
into the right positions. The weights force you to engage the right muscles.
The added weight also offers a deeper sense of physical grounding, and the
weights challenge your balancing skills more intensely than traditional yoga.

Chapter 1: Introducing Yoga with Weights
The Baptiste family’s yoga journey
In his lifetime, Sherri’s father, Walt Baptiste, had
an interesting yoga journey, one that prefigures
yoga with weights. Walt started as a body-
builder and later incorporated yoga into his
exercise program. Along with his wife (and
Sherri’s mother) Magaña, he opened the first
yoga school in San Francisco in 1955. (Walt and
Magaña are pictured here.)
Walt won the “Mr. America” bodybuilding title
in 1949. He was the founder and editor of Body
Moderne magazine, a publication for body-
builders devoted to health and fitness. He was
always experimenting with ways to improve his
bodybuilding techniques, and his experiments
eventually led him to breathing and mindfulness
techniques. Rather than grunting, groaning, and
straining in his bodybuilding workouts, Walt dis-
covered how to apply the principals of concen-
tration and breath, as practiced today in yoga
with weights.
Yoga was considered an extremely exotic prac-
tice when Walt and Magaña started teaching
classes in the 1950s. Standing on your head,
contemplation, meditation, and contorting your-
self seemed too foreign and too strange. For
fear of being embarrassed, some of the stu-
dents who came to the Baptiste’s Yoga
Philosophic Health Center in the 1950s asked
the couple not to tell their spouses that they
were taking these weird “yogurt” classes.
Walt understood that yoga was more than a
mere exercise program; he knew that it had the
power to transform people’s lives and empower
individuals in ways that working out simply
couldn’t. And Walt was right. Now you can see
yoga studios and people walking along with
rolled-up yoga mats in every major American
city. By some estimates, 20 million Americans
are taking the yoga journey. Three-quarters of
all health clubs offer yoga classes. The yoga-
client list includes professional athletes,
celebrities, and health professionals. The cur-
rent yoga boom is no surprise; its popularity and
staying power are testaments to its value as an
exercise program that addresses the body,
mind, and soul.

Weighing the Benefits of Yoga 
with Weights
Before you take the plunge and give yoga with weights a try, you may be
interested in knowing what the many health benefits of yoga with weights
are. Here’s a catalog of health benefits you may experience if you devote
yourself to yoga with weights.
Making you stronger
Yoga makes you stronger and tones your muscles, but by adding the weights,
you give additional boost to the muscle strengthening and toning powers of
yoga.
When you stress a muscle with exercise or a repeated activity, the muscle
increases in strength and diameter as the muscle fiber expands. In other
words, the muscle is toned. The weight-bearing aspect of yoga with weights
improves the oxygenation of muscles, which promotes the muscles’ growth
and repair. The stretching improves the flexibility and health of muscles and
tendons. Yoga with weights also reduces the risk of muscle tears and strains
because weightlifting, when properly done, integrates the muscles closer to
the bones.
Building your core strength
You read a lot about your “core” and “core strength” in this book. When we
write about your core, we’re referring to the muscles of your trunk and torso
that support your spine. These muscles are the major players in balancing
and coordination. The core muscles also support your shoulders and hips.
Most people don’t know it, but the abdominal muscles, which are also core
muscles, are very important for supporting your spine.
Unless your core muscles are strong, you can’t develop the muscles of your
arms and legs to their fullest potential, in much the same way that tree
branches can’t grow big unless the trunk of the tree is strong enough to sup-
port the branches.
Your core muscles are responsible for good posture. They keep your back
straight and your shoulders square, and they keep you from slouching. Your
core muscles also support and protect your internal organs. For example, if
14
Part I: Getting Started 

the muscles around your back and abdomen aren’t strong, sitting up straight
for long periods of time is hard, because the muscles of your back and
abdomen take some of the weight-bearing stress off the smaller muscles in
your head, neck, and even your shoulders. Without strong core muscles,
you’re more susceptible to back problems.
When most people think of getting stronger, they imagine being able to lift
heavier weights or run faster. But before you can accomplish such feats, you
need to develop the core muscles of your trunk and torso. Deep strength
begins in these core muscles — your power source, the axis around which so
many muscles move. Yoga with weights is a superb program for reaching into
the center of your body to engage, utilize, and exercise the core muscles that
really matter.
Toning your muscles
Yoga-with-weights exercises are designed to work and tone all the muscles of
your body. If you think your arms are too flabby, if you want to develop your
abdominal muscles, or if you want to strengthen your legs, you can find many
yoga-with-weights exercises that target those areas. In traditional yoga, you
can tone and refine parts of your body with exercises. The addition of
weights makes it possible to really dig into a muscle or muscle group and
work it hard. Chapter 15 describes exercises that target different body areas.
Being more beautiful
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, of course. But beauty is also a matter of
confidence, poise, and bearing. We’ve seen older people with wrinkles and
thinning silver hair who don’t fit the standard definition of beauty but who
are nevertheless very beautiful. These people radiate an inner glow that has
ripened during the years. They have a light in their eyes that tells you that
they’re very much alive to the world around them and living their lives in a
way that’s full of enthusiasm. They have what’s sometimes called inner
beauty or an inspired state of being.
It’s often said that yoga slows the aging process. What yoga really does is to
help maintain and improve your posture and general health through exercis-
ing and proper breathing. Yoga with weights helps to increase your vitality
and overall well-being so you look and feel younger and more beautiful. It can
give you self-confidence and poise, increase your self-awareness, and make
the light inside you shine more brightly with each decade.

Chapter 1: Introducing Yoga with Weights

Addressing your flexibility and 
range of motion
Yoga is well known for making people more flexible, supple, lithe, and limber.
You’ve probably seen photographs of human pretzels, like the one in Figure
1-1, contorting themselves into different yoga postures. Being flexible is nec-
essary if you want to be comfortable in your body. Think of all the practical
advantages of being flexible. You can reach higher, sit more comfortably on
the floor, sit at your desk for longer periods of time with greater ease, or
stand longer. You have the choice of bending at the waist or squatting when
you want to pick up something from the floor.
Soreness, swelling, and pain relate to the loss of body tissue movement. To
prevent injury and postural changes, it helps if your joints have a maximum
range of motion.
Many people believe that being flexible enough to get into pretzel poses is
the primary goal of yoga. Being flexible does show up over time as a natural
part of the process, but it’s a secondary goal. You can be a good yoga practi-
tioner without being especially flexible. Yoga with weights combines basic
master techniques from the yoga tradition with physical culture practices.
The goal is to achieve the proper body alignment and breathe correctly in
every move and exercise while cultivating an open mind and heart. You want
to achieve a balanced and overall strengthening effect, not to be as flexible as
a pretzel.

Improving your circulation
Whenever you exercise, you improve your blood circulation. After you stretch
or contract a muscle in a yoga-with-weights exercise and the muscle relaxes, it
becomes flooded with blood! Flooded with blood may sound like the title of a
horror movie, but this blood inundation is good for you because it increases
the flow of blood to your muscles, and blood delivers nutrients. Your muscles
become stronger and healthier because they receive more nutrients. Stretching
also helps renew muscles and muscle fiber.
Creating body awareness
Yoga with weights builds body awareness. You can think of yoga with weights
as a dialogue between your mind and body. As you exercise, your brain sends
a message to a part of your body telling it to move in a certain direction, and
your body sends a signal back to your brain saying that the body part can
make the desired motion or can’t move any farther. When your brain receives
its signal, it sends out another signal asking the part of the body to become

Chapter 1: Introducing Yoga with Weights
Indian club, anyone?
If you think yoga with weights is new under the
sun, think again. As an exercise discipline, com-
bining yogalike postures with weights is many
centuries old, except that the ancient practi-
tioners didn’t lift weights as we know them.
They lifted heavy wooden clubs called gadas, or
Indian clubs. After the British colonized India,
they recognized the value of exercising with
Indian clubs, and swinging Indian clubs became
an exercise activity in Britain and then in the
United States in the late 19th and early 20th cen-
turies. In some respects, yoga with weights is a
return to an exercise program that was prac-
ticed in India for centuries and was well known
to American and British exercise enthusiasts
100 years ago.
Indian clubs are shaped like bowling pins. They
range in height from 2 to 21⁄2 feet and weigh
between 1 and 7 pounds. If you could time-
travel to an American gymnasium in 1910, you’d
see an assortment of Indian clubs painted with
colorful designs lined up against the wall. The
clubs have since become collector’s items. Look
up “Indian clubs” next time you visit eBay
(www.ebay.com), the online auction house.
You’ll see some beautiful examples.
Physical trainers liked the clubs because they
permitted you to build muscle strength while
maintaining the range of motion in your arms
and shoulders. Exercising with Indian clubs was
sometimes called circular weight training. In
traditional weight training, sometimes called
linear weight training, you isolate one muscle or
one muscle group as you lift. This isolation can
make you stiff or muscle-bound after you train
for a while. But by swinging Indian clubs, you
can build strength while retaining your grace of
motion.
Yoga with weights and circular weight training
share some common traits. Both work your
muscles, and both help your muscles retain
their agility, flexibility, and range of motion.

more active or relax a little more. This ongoing dialogue amounts to a self-
exploration of your body. In a very profound way, it makes you more aware of
your body and enables you to extend the physical limits that you thought
your body was incapable of reaching.
For the past several years, Sherri has worked with an older man who had
polio in his youth. Her experiences with this man have shown her just how
beneficial yoga can be to body awareness. He can now bend over, sit up, and
walk with more ease, confidence, and coordination. In general, his muscle
strength, range of motion, and overall sense of well-being have improved.
Through his commitment and practice, yoga has been supportive and helped
him rewire some of what we call the nerve highways and pathways that polio
had damaged.
Focusing on your balance and coordination
Most of the yoga-with-weights exercises in this book challenge your ability to
balance and your coordination. Balancing is discovering how to work mus-
cles in opposition to one another. When you balance on one leg, for example,
you flex, or integrate, some muscles, and you relax others. If you flex or relax
the wrong muscles, you lose your balance. Yoga with weights helps you
understand which muscles to contract or relax in an action, and in so doing it
teaches balance and coordination.
Balancing improves your ability to direct your thoughts or stream of concen-
tration. You develop skills of concentration in order to balance. Balancing
fires the neurons of your brain. It helps clear the nerve highways and path-
ways so you can focus better. Recent studies in brain elasticity indicate that
exercises that develop coordination and balance stimulate the brain to create
new maps and communication pathways, keeping the brain healthy and vital.
Building bone density
Loosely speaking, “bone density” refers to how strong and dense your bones
are. To be specific, bone density is a measure of how tightly packed the cells
and molecules in a bone are. The more tightly packed the tissue is, the higher
the bone density, and the healthier the bone. Low bone density increases
your risk of fracturing or breaking a bone.
As they age, most people lose bone density, partly because their bodies can’t
absorb the calcium and minerals they need for strong bones as readily as they
once could. Bone density decreases gradually in men and women starting at
age 30; in women, the decrease is more pronounced after menopause because
estrogen, the ovarian hormone, plays a role in maintaining strong bones.
18
Part I: Getting Started 

Weight-bearing exercises such as yoga with weights help bones retain den-
sity. When you lift a weight, your muscle pulls against your bones, which
makes your bones experience stress. Detecting this stress, your body sends a
signal to the cells in your bones that goes something like this: “Please get
stronger and denser.” Isn’t it nice to know that some kinds of stress are actu-
ally good for your health?
Finding out the correct way to breathe
“But I know how to breathe,” we hear you say. Are you sure about that? Most
people don’t realize that they aren’t breathing correctly. They don’t breathe
with their abdomens, mid-diaphragm areas, or upper chest areas in a bal-
anced way. Instead, they habitually take short, shallow breaths. When they
exercise, some people even hold their breath without realizing it. Most
people don’t always breathe fully into their lungs, and they miss out on the
many wonderful benefits of proper breathing.
We devote an entire chapter to breathing — Chapter 4. Proper breathing can
reduce stress and lower your blood pressure. It delivers life-giving oxygen to
your body so you have the energy you need. Yoga and yoga with weights are
two of a handful of exercise programs that concern themselves with breath-
ing properly. Read Chapter 4 to understand what a deep breath really is.
Squeezing and soaking
Squeeze-and-soak exercises are exercises that massage your internal organs —
your liver, stomach, intestines, pancreas, and others. We include many
squeeze-and-soak exercises in this book because they help squeeze out the
toxins in your internal organs and deliver more blood and oxygen to the
organs.
When you bend forward or twist your spine, you squeeze and soak. When
you return to a resting position, your organs open up and return to their
normal shapes and sizes, and as they do so, they soak up oxygenated blood
cells. This oxygenation restores and helps to maintain the organs’ health and
vitality.
Developing the quality of self-awareness
This book mostly sticks to the physical side of yoga with weights, but that
doesn’t mean we want to downplay the quality of consciousness and self-
awareness that yoga practitioners develop when they commit themselves
deeply and intensely to yoga. Yoga consciousness is real. Yoga encourages
you to be more aware not only of your body, but also of the world around you.
19
Chapter 1: Introducing Yoga with Weights

The discipline helps you stay in the moment so you’re more cognizant of
sounds, sights, and other sensations. Yoga awakens you. It teaches you to live
a life without blinders so you’re more keenly in tune with the flow of life — the
mysterious force that makes the world pulsate and grow.
We like to compare the yoga practice to the opening of a rose or other flower.
The roots, foundation, and stem of the rose — the flower’s physical body —
must be strong enough to support it. Yoga-with-weights exercises strengthen
your body. As the flower awakens, it blossoms and opens its petals to drink
in the sunlight. Similarly, the meditation and breathwork that accompany the
yoga-with-weights practice open your awareness to the outside world and
your own potential to grow. Like the blossoming rose absorbing light from
the sun, you commune and connect from within more completely with the
world around you.
Evaluating Your Readiness
“Can I really do this?” is a question many people ask themselves everyday.
But when they ask this question, they ought to remember that the only thing
that gets in their way, most of the time, is themselves. They invent excuses
not to try a new activity even if the activity is very good for them. Everybody
is good at procrastinating. The discussion that follows is for people who can’t
quite decide whether yoga with weights is for them.
You haven’t studied yoga
Should you have studied yoga already in order to study yoga with weights?
The short answer is: It isn’t necessary. Yoga with weights is user-friendly,
meaning it isn’t intimidating, and you don’t need a background in yoga. The
door is always open. Anyone who’s interested is welcome.
Yogis sometimes say, “You’re as young as your yoga practice.” The saying
refers to yoga’s rejuvenating qualities and to the fact that practicing yoga is
akin to being a newborn, in that you discover anew how to move your body
when you practice yoga. Like a baby learning to lift his or her head or roll
over, yoga students feel their way into new, more liberating body motions and
positions as they practice yoga. Yoga is well known for making people look
and feel younger. To some degree, yoga slows down the aging process. Bone
mass develops, and you feel more vital and energetic.
Of course, if you’ve already studied yoga, studying yoga with weights is that
much easier because the language and the concepts aren’t completely new or
unfamiliar. For example, you already understand the importance of breathing
in exercise. If this book instructs you to breathe deep into your chest and
lungs, you know what’s what. And if this book tells you to move into the
20
Part I: Getting Started 

downward-facing dog position, you know exactly what that is. A downward-
facing dog? Don’t all dogs face downward?
You haven’t had weight training (or you
lift weights on the regular)
You don’t need to have lifted weights before now to study yoga with weights.
The weights you use are only 1 to 5 pounds and aren’t difficult to get the hang
of. If you’ve never picked up a weight before, rest reassured that holding a pair
of hand weights or strapping on a pair of ankle weights doesn’t take any exper-
tise whatsoever. The weights help you feel more grounded but don’t weigh you
down.
We’ve noticed that the yoga room intimidates people who have lifted weights.
Why? Because weightlifters aren’t flexible, and they’re used to being some of
the fittest, best athletes in the gym. Sherri can’t count the number of times
weight trainers and big-time bodybuilders have told her, “I really want to
come to your yoga class.” But only a handful of them showed up.
Stepping out of your element and comfort zone is a challenge for everybody,
bodybuilders included, but taking that first step is actually much easier than
you may think. The real beauty of yoga with weights for people who do lift
weights regularly is that it benefits them in new and balanced ways, allowing
them to reclaim full range of motion and flexibility while maintaining their
strength. This is just what they often need.
One of the biggest attractions of yoga with weights is being able to lift
weights and still maintain your flexibility. You get the same muscular tone
you get from weight training and work on your flexibility as well. You won’t
get “bulked up” or muscle-bound, but your muscles will be toned, defined,
and strengthened.
You’re really out of shape
Out of shape? Who? You? Well, you’re not the only one who’s out of shape.
Life just starts doing its thing with us and pretty soon we fall out of shape.
We’re sure you’ve been told before that staying in shape takes consistency
and a life-long commitment. All you have to do is put in the effort and you
soon reap the rewards.
If you’re very out of shape, start slow. Go to Chapter 6 and start with the gentle
walking and breathing exercises. Try to observe a daily walking program of 20
to 45 minutes to get the ball rolling. When you build your confidence, go to
Chapter 7 and start doing the Balanced Workout. You may also want to check
out Chapter 18, which offers low-impact exercises designed for seniors.
21
Chapter 1: Introducing Yoga with Weights

Busy moms, CEOs, and other dynamic people we know use this technique to
find time to exercise: They schedule the time. Knowing how easy it is not to
exercise, they enter their yoga classes on their calendars and plan their time
around yoga. They make a commitment in writing to show up. The classes
are on their calendars and they have to go no matter what. (Chapter 19 pro-
vides you with some tips for staying motivated to work out.)
You’re stiff as a board
Some people are by nature muscle-bound or tight, and they have a limited
range of motion. They can hardly lean forward far enough to tie their shoes.
People with tight muscles tend to be protective and guarded in their move-
ments. They don’t have the confidence to move freely. This lack of confi-
dence hinders their movements and makes them even stiffer. Eventually, they
may develop bad posture, which can lead to other health problems, including
chronic back pain and chronic headaches (see Chapter 14). Bad posture can
compress the internal organs, causing poor digestion, high blood pressure,
and respiratory ailments.
If you’re stiff by nature, yoga with weights can seem like a risky enterprise
mentally and emotionally when you begin exercising. But hang in there.
Breath by breath, exercise by exercise, you can escape the cage that your
body has become, spread your wings, and fly. As Chapter 4 explains, yoga
breathing techniques can improve the blood circulation in your body and
bring new healthy cells to your muscles. Where flexibility is concerned, suc-
cess breeds success. One muscle unknotting can cause the one beside it to
loosen. Even people who are very stiff by nature can become limber if they
stick with yoga with weights and practice it as little as twice a week.
Eventually, your muscles will rest back against your bones and stretch out
and elongate, and you’ll be able to move more comfortably and freely.
You’re loose as a goose
Some people are double-jointed. Their tendons and ligaments are more elas-
tic. They can touch their noses to their knees without any distress or bend
over backwards to touch the floor. People who are double-jointed, or hyper-
flexible, run the risk of hyperextending their knees, elbows, and other joints
because their ligaments and tendons are too elastic. They’re capable of flex-
ing well beyond a joint’s normal range. Unless they develop the muscular
strength to support their supple joints, these people can injure their joints in
the course of doing an exercise.
Hyperflexibility is probably a matter of genetics. You’re born with limbs that
are too loose, but you can do something about it. Yoga with weights can 
22
Part I: Getting Started 

benefit people who suffer from hyperflexibility because it strengthens sup-
porting muscles. This extra muscle mass makes the joints more stable.
You’re pregnant or have a preexisting 
medical condition
A few medical conditions may preclude you from doing yoga with weights. If
you have a heart condition, you’re obese, or you’re pregnant, think twice
before undertaking this form of exercise and proceed with caution. You may
have to consult your doctor before doing the exercises.
The cardinal rule of yoga applies especially to people with medical condi-
tions: If something doesn’t feel right, if an exercise makes you uncomfortable,
or if you feel pain, don’t do it. Back away from the exercise and consider
whether you’re doing it right or whether you should be doing it at all.
Heart conditions
Heart disease is caused by poor diet, lack of exercise, or a genetic predisposi-
tion. The most common heart ailment is coronary artery disease, which is
caused by a clogging or narrowing of the arteries that restricts the supply of
oxygen and nutrients to the heart. If the heart muscle is weakened and can’t
pump blood efficiently, congestive heart failure can result. Signs of a heart
condition include angina (chest pain or discomfort that occurs when your
heart muscle doesn’t get enough blood), edema (swelling in the legs), and
shortness of breath.
If you have a heart condition such as coronary artery disease, speak to your
doctor before you undertake any kind of exercise. All forms of exercise,
including yoga with weights, place a burden on your cardiovascular system
because exercise increases the flow of blood and stresses the heart muscle.
For that reason, you must be especially careful before you undertake an exer-
cise program if you have a heart condition.
The good news for people who are cleared by their doctors to practice yoga
with weights is that the discipline offers real rewards to patients with heart dis-
ease. Yoga with weights lowers your stress level and gives you the opportunity
to exercise at your own pace without overtaxing your cardiovascular system.
Obesity
Being obese doesn’t prevent you from doing yoga with weights, although you
do have to start slowly. If the Balanced Workout exercises we describe in
Chapter 7 are too difficult, start with the chair exercises we present in
Chapter 18. You’ll discover that after a few workouts, the core muscles in
your trunk and torso will become stronger. The weight on your body will be
distributed more evenly and you’ll be able to move more freely.
23
Chapter 1: Introducing Yoga with Weights

Pregnancy
Before you take on yoga with weights or another new exercise program
during a pregnancy, seek the advice of a prenatal care physician. Typically,
women who have been cleared to exercise can do most of the standing and
sitting exercises we describe in this book until the fifth or sixth month of
pregnancy. After that period, depending on the woman and how strong she
feels, doing exercises that require lying on your back or belly may be too
strenuous or difficult.
In our experience, women who practiced yoga before they became pregnant
can continue doing many of the standard yoga practices throughout their
pregnancies, but women who want to take up the discipline to stay healthy
during their pregnancies are better off in prenatal yoga classes. The trainers
who oversee these classes know which exercises are suitable for pregnant
women; they’re attuned to a pregnant woman’s health and understand how to
guide her through yoga workouts. Chapter 17 has advice for pregnant women
who want to study yoga with weights.
What You Need to Get Started
To get started with yoga with weights, you need a little willpower, an open
mind, and a sense of adventure; at least those are the only intangibles you
need. Taking the first step in any new activity is usually the hardest part. Go
ahead and take the first step. You won’t regret it.
As for the tangibles, you need some equipment to get going. You need a quiet
and comfortable place to exercise, hand weights, and ankle weights. Chapter 2
explains all the equipment in more detail.
Mastering Posture Alignment Techniques
Posture alignment refers to how your muscles are integrated and bones are
aligned to support your body for optimal movement during exercise. The aim
of good posture alignment is to establish a solid foundation with your body
so you can support your limbs, back, and head while you exercise. You want
your body to be safe, secure, and able to expand more fully and freely during
each exercise.
To avoid injury and to get more out of yoga-with-weights exercises, it pays to
practice proper posture alignment. The posture-alignment techniques we pre-
sent here give you a greater sense of stability and balance not only when you
exercise, but also when you stand in lines or sit for long periods of time. The
better your posture is, the fewer injuries you’re prone to in exercise and in
daily life.
24
Part I: Getting Started 

In the workout chapters in this book, we often give directions for maintaining
a solid foundation. Here are the directions you come across in the exercise
descriptions that deal with posture alignment:
 Engage your core muscles. Your core muscles are the muscles in 
your trunk and torso that are responsible for supporting your spine.
When you engage these muscles, it feels as though you’re wearing a
tight-fitting spandex suit on your body because you have a “hugged-in”
feeling. You feel empowered when you move from your core muscles
into all the exercises.
 Draw your belly in and up and your tailbone down. As your tailbone
drops toward the floor, your legs strengthen, and you press your leg mus-
cles up against the bone where they can support your body. You should
feel the muscles hugging the bones as the bones begin lengthening.
 Press into all four corners of your feet. You root downward through the
soles of your feet to create depth and stability while you exercise. You
should feel equal weight on the front and back of each foot as well as on
the sides. Feel the corners of your heel and the ball or pad on the front
of your foot — especially the area below your big toe and baby toes —
pressing downward. You should also feel the arches of your feet gently
lifting up as if energy from the front of your shins is pulling your arches
up. The feeling continues through your knees as your thigh muscles
gently lift your knees upward.
 Stabilize and center your head between your shoulders. We may ask
you to perform this action during standing exercises. Gaze forward with
your chin naturally down, not lifted or tilted. Draw your shoulders away
from your ears and your shoulder blades down your back. Make sure
your chest is comfortable, spread your collarbones wide, and give a
slight lift to your breast bone or sternum, lifting naturally. Stand with
your hips aligned over your knees and with your knees over your heels.
 Spread your fingers wide. When your hands are on the floor and you’re
supporting your body with your hands, we ask you to spread your fin-
gers wide so that each finger is active and pressing firmly on the floor to
help support your body.
 Place your shoulders over your wrists and hands and your hips over
your knees. We give you this instruction when an exercise requires you
to be on all fours. When you’re in this position, make sure that you dis-
tribute your body weight evenly over your wrists, hands, and knees and
that you fully engage the core muscles of your trunk.
When you’re lifting a hand weight or an ankle weight, always make sure not to
hurry. Lift the weight in a slow, controlled fashion. When you go slow, you
make your body more stable and capable of supporting the weight, you iso-
late the muscle you want to work more effectively, and you don’t cheat by
relying on your momentum to lift the weight.
25
Chapter 1: Introducing Yoga with Weights

No matter what yoga-with-weights exercise you’re doing, your entire body
should be involved. In addition to keeping your core body engaged, before
you do an exercise, direct your thoughts to the specific area that’s most
actively involved in that particular exercise. For example, if you’re doing
bicep curls, focus on your biceps. By directing your mind to the specific body
action, you enhance your body-mind connection and create a more empow-
ered workout. This technique is also excellent for mental conditioning.
Heeding the All-Important Safety Issues
Use common sense when practicing yoga with weights. If something doesn’t
feel right, don’t do it. Work at your own level of ability and never push your-
self too far. The following pages present guidelines for making sure you prac-
tice yoga with weights safely. These guidelines can help you determine what’s
safe, but practically speaking, it’s up to you to draw your own guidelines.
Yoga with weights is a voyage of self-discovery. After you practice the disci-
pline long enough, you understand what your breathing, discomfort level,
and pain level mean. The object of the exercises is to come to the edge with-
out stepping off the cliff — to push yourself without pushing too far. As long
as you stay in the moment and register the sensations in your body very
carefully, your breathing, discomfort level, and pain level can tell you where
the edge is and show you how to get the most from the exercises.
Listen to your breathing
Rapid breathing, short and shallow breathing, holding your breath, and gasp-
ing are signs of distress. If you can’t take slow, deep, rhythmic breaths as you
exercise, you’re overexerting and subjecting yourself to injury. Ease away
from what you’re doing just enough to regain control over your breathing,
and then continue with the exercise.
Yoga-with-weights exercising isn’t about coming to the edge and falling off; it’s
about riding the crest of the wave in all its glory and enjoying the ride in the
process. For more information on proper breathing techniques, see Chapter 4.
Be aware of your discomfort level
In yoga with weights, you make a distinction between comfortable discomfort
and uncomfortable discomfort. Feeling comfortable discomfort, such as the
uneasiness that accompanies breaking new ground in yoga with weights (or any
other exercise technique), is fine. If you feel uncomfortable discomfort, how-
ever, you’re straining yourself. Abandon the exercise you’re doing and ask your-
self whether you’re doing the exercise correctly or pushing yourself too far.

Chapter 1: Introducing Yoga with Weights
Can children study yoga with weights?
Some parents are concerned that working with
weights can stunt children’s growth. This con-
cern isn’t unwarranted. Lifting heavy weights
without using the proper technique can put too
much stress on the growth plate — the area of
growing tissue at the end of long bones — and
retard bone growth. If your children lift weights,
make sure that they use the proper technique
and start with light weights before moving on to
heavy ones.
Bone growth, however, isn’t an issue for chil-
dren who practice yoga with weights. The 1-, 
3-, or 5-pound weights are light and shouldn’t
damage growth plates in a child’s bones. But if
in doubt, have children do the exercises with-
out weights or use the lightest weights. Give
your children a lightweight wooden dowel or
other item to help them figure out the exercises.
They can still get a wonderful workout without
the weights.
Getting children to practice yoga with weights
isn’t easy. Staying in one place is hard for 
them, and focusing on breathing isn’t some-
thing they’re accustomed to. Children prefer 
fast-moving aerobic exercises to quiet, con-
templative, inward-looking exercise techniques.
Still, we encourage parents to get their children
to try yoga with weights by making it fun, play-
ful, and not too serious. Besides the physical
benefits of discovering balance and coordina-
tion, children discover how to direct their minds
and concentrate better. Kids who practice yoga
with weights often do better in school. They
know how to focus and concentrate on the
activity before them.
To encourage children to practice yoga with
weights, keep the workouts to 30 minutes or
less. Try to make a game of the exercises.
Children always exercise better in groups, and
if you can get a group of kids to study yoga with
weights, so much the better. We hope that the
addition of weights to the yoga practice will
make yoga more attractive to children.
The following photograph shows a young Sherri
Baptiste working out with her parents, Walter
and Magaña. As you can see, Sherri is lifting a
weight. Weightlifting didn’t stunt her growth,
and she’s now considerably taller than she is in
this photograph.

Be aware of any pain you feel
As with other exercise techniques, you sometimes feel pain when you do
yoga-with-weights exercises. Pay careful attention to any pain or discomfort
you feel. Listen to it. Focus on the part of your body where the pain is
located. Burning or stinging pain signals you to be careful, but not necessar-
ily to back away from what you’re doing. Sometimes you can control this kind
of pain by breathing. Quivering or sharp pain means you’ve gone too far.
You’re pulling muscle off the bone and subjecting yourself to injury.
Practice at a slow but steady pace
When you’re exercising, switching to automatic pilot and going through the
motions is easy. When that happens, you increase your chances of injuring
yourself, because you’re not focusing on your body. Listen to your body and
focus on what you feel as you exercise. This, along with conscious breathing
and a steady exercise pace, helps prevent injuries. We carefully designed
every exercise in this book to give you a workout but spare you the risk of
injury. Timing and proper breathing are the keys to the depth and success of
each workout and practice. Try not to speed up to get your workout over
with quickly. By the same token, don’t go so slow that you lose your pacing
and rhythm and make the workout boring.

In This Chapter
 Choosing and using hand and ankle weights
 Selecting a yoga mat
 Wearing the right clothes for yoga with weights
 Slipping on the right shoes
 Hydrating for your safety
Yoga with weights doesn’t require as much gear as a trip across
Antarctica, where the slippery surfaces make for some tough yoga con-
ditions, but you do need a few items. The bare necessities are hand and ankle
weights, but we also recommend that you have a yoga mat, the right clothes,
good shoes (for warming up), and water for staying hydrated as you work
out. The good news for you? These items don’t cost a bundle.
Read on for more information about the gear and equipment you need —
some of it shown in Figure 2-1 — for a yoga-with-weights workout.
Figure 2-1:
Some of the
accoutre-
ments you
need for a
yoga-with-
weights
workout.

Weighing Your Hand- and 
Ankle-Weight Options
You need two kinds of weights if you want to incorporate weight resistance
into your yoga workouts: hand weights to hold and ankle weights to strap to
your ankles. Most sporting goods and athletic stores carry these weights,
and you may be able to find them in the sporting goods sections of depart-
ment stores. (The appendix lists online stores where you can purchase yoga-
with-weights supplies.)
The following sections explain everything you need to know about choosing
and using weights, including what size weights you need, the ins and outs of
shopping for weights, and a handful of weight accessories that may be useful
to you.
Investing in weights of different sizes
We recommend having three sizes of hand and ankle weights at your disposal
for your yoga-with weights workouts: a pair of 1-pound weights, a pair of 3-
pound weights, and a pair of 5-pound weights.
Always start with the lightest hand or ankle weights and work your way up.
This allows you to start from your comfort zone and work your way into the
weight that gives you the most fulfilling workout. If you start with the heavi-
est weight, you run the risk or straining yourself and pulling a muscle.
You may wonder why we don’t instruct you to lift weights heavier than 5
pounds. Especially if you’re a jock who’s been pumping iron in the gym for
years, isn’t 5 pounds kind of light? You’ll discover when you start doing the
exercises that 5-pound weights — in addition to the yoga poses — give you a
very solid workout. Even if you’re an expert weightlifter, the combination of
yoga poses and hand weights will test your strength and balancing abilities in
new ways that make you sweat and really feel it deep in your muscles.
The yoga-with-weights workout refines and lengthens muscles; it isn’t
intended to build the bulky body of a Charles Atlas. Yoga with weights cre-
ates a leaner, longer, stronger body. The 1-, 3-, or 5-pound weights you use in
the exercises stretch your muscles, release tension in your muscles, and
engage the muscles in the deep core of your body that you use for balance
and stability. (For more on the core muscles of your body, see Chapter 1.)
Not many forms of exercise engage your deep-core balancing muscles. The
added resistance from the weights forces your deep-core muscles to spring
into action. Lifting weights heavier than 5 pounds may make you too top- or
bottom-heavy and upset the balance and distribution of your body weight.
30
Part I: Getting Started 

You would no longer focus on balancing or engaging your core muscles; you
would exercise your arms or legs in traditional weightlifting fashion.
In the exercise descriptions in this book, we don’t tell you which of the three
weights to use. The amount of resistance you want is up to you. Experiment
with the different weights, and choose the size that gives you the best workout.
Knowing which size weight to use
How do you know which size weight (1-, 3-, or 5-pound) to use in a particular
exercise? The size is ultimately up to you, but if you find yourself straining as
you do an exercise, consider using a lighter weight.
Here are some telltale signs that you should switch to a lighter weight:
 Grunting. Emitting a grunt, a grumble, or a groan in the middle of an
exercise means you’re straining too much.
 Holding your breath. We instruct you when to inhale and exhale when
necessary, and we always instruct you to breathe slowly and con-
sciously. If you start holding your breath, it’s a sure sign that you’re
straining to do the exercise.
 Shaking or cramping muscles. If your arm, for example, starts shaking
or cramping in the middle of an exercise, you’re working a particular
muscle in your arm too hard. The object of yoga with weights is to
engage many muscles at once, not a particular muscle or muscle group.
 Tiring quickly. This tells you that you’re overambitious where the heavi-
ness of the weights is concerned.
 Throwing your body. If you find yourself lunging or throwing your body
to lift a weight, you’re relying on your momentum to lift rather than your
muscles. You’ve lost your core stability.
Knowing if the weights you’re lifting are too light is easy. If you’re not working
hard enough, switch from 1 to 3 pounds or from 3 to 5 pounds.
Don’t be afraid to experiment. Keep different size weights at your side and
test the different weights until you find the pair that engages you the best in
an exercise. You may find yourself using different weights for different exer-
cises. The surest way to know whether your choice of weights is the right one
is to see how you feel after a workout. If your body feels weak and shaky, you
need lighter weights; likewise, if you’re too sore the next day, you need
lighter weights. If you finish a workout with the feeling of “comfortable dis-
comfort” — a feeling that you’ve met the challenge and given yourself a good
workout — you know that your choice in weights was the right one.
Most people exercise with 1- and 3-pound weights. Especially with the ankle
weights, 5 pounds can seem like 5 tons when you’re in the middle of a workout.
31
Chapter 2: Gearing Up

However, we don’t want to discourage you from using these weights, espe-
cially if you’re tall or big.
Shopping for hand and ankle weights
You have many options when shopping for hand and ankle weights. Following
are some alternatives and suggestions we provide for your shopping spree.
Hand weights
Sometimes hand weights are sold in sets, and you may be able to find a 1-, 3-,
and 5-pound combination. Hand weights are often priced by the pound, with
1 pound costing about $1.50. A 3-pound hand weight, for example, should
cost about $4.50.
Recently, a new kind of glove-style hand weight has appeared on store
shelves. You can slip your hand into these weights, which gives you an
advantage because you don’t have to grasp the weight as you lift it, and you
can stretch out the fingers of your hand as you move through each exercise.
Glove-style weights give you the opportunity to stretch and lift at the same
time, and you may even get more of a stretch without the hindrance of carry-
ing or gripping the weights and balancing at the same time. (Look in the
appendix for advice for finding glove-style weights on the Internet.)
You have other options if you want to stick to hand-held weights. Weightlifters
are accustomed to wearing special fingerless grip gloves that secure the
weights in their hands and prevent calluses. If you like grip gloves, by all
means use them in yoga-with-weights exercises; just be sure to air out the
gloves when you’re finished using them.
Never drop a hand weight. When you’re done with it, place it carefully on the
floor where no one can step on it. And keep weights away from children. You
can buy special weight racks for storing weights on the cheap.
Ankle weights
We recommend keeping 1-, 3- and 5-pound ankle weights on hand as you per-
form the exercises in this book. At most, wear 5-pound ankle weights when
you do an exercise. The weights should range in price from $15 to $25 a pair.
Changing ankle weights is considerably more trouble than changing hand
weights, so you may want to find ankle weights that strap on and off with
ease. Ankle weights with Velcro closures are the easiest to get on and off. You
can also try to find ankle weights that come with little pockets for inserting
metal slugs of different sizes (see the appendix for information about buying
these ankle weights). These pocket-pouch ankle weights make it easy to
change weight sizes because you don’t have to unstrap the weights and put
on a different pair.
32
Part I: Getting Started 

Settling on the Right Yoga Mat
You need a solid, supporting surface to exercise on, and for that reason, we
recommend that you use a yoga mat for your safety. Mats give you padding,
comfort, and protection, especially for your knees and spine. However, it isn’t
necessary to have a yoga mat when you do yoga-with-weights exercises. You
can exercise on a solid, non-slippery, close-weave type of carpet or clean, dry
floor.
If you’re taking a yoga-with-weights class in a gym, we recommend bringing
your own mat for hygiene purposes. Most gyms offer yoga mats, but they can
get very sweaty. Rolling around in your own sweat is much more agreeable
and hygienic than rolling around in a stranger’s sweat. (The “Washing your
yoga mat” sidebar provides instructions for cleaning a yoga mat.)
When you shop for a yoga mat, look for one that stretches a little and gives
you good support. Like Goldilocks’s porridge, the mat shouldn’t be too thick
or too thin. Mats range from a fraction of an inch to an inch deep, but depth
isn’t the real issue — cushioning is. The idea is to get some relief from the
hard floor, and although comfort is fine, a spongy mat can be a nuisance
because it doesn’t give you a solid base to work on. For your purposes, a
quarter- to half-inch-thick mat is best because it offers comfort and stability;
if you’re uncomfortable sitting on the floor or on your knees, get a mat that’s
on the thick side. Also, the mat should be as long as you are tall plus about 6
inches; in other words, if you’re 5’6”, find a 6-foot yoga mat.
33
Chapter 2: Gearing Up
Dumbbell timeline
People have been lifting weights, or dumbbells,
for several centuries. The first dumbbells
weren’t made for exercise, but for ringing
cathedral bells. These bells were quite large
and heavy, and some required several men to
operate. To develop their skills, bell-ringers
practiced with a dumbbell, a weight as heavy as
a cathedral bell suspended from a rope.
Because this false bell made no sound, it was
called a “dumbbell.”
Later, the word dumbbell was applied to
weights that people used for exercise. The first
recorded use of the word dumbbell in weightlift-
ing occurred in 1711, when the Englishman
Joseph Addison wrote in The Spectator: “For
my own part, when I am in Town, I exercise
myself an Hour every Morning upon a dumb Bell
that is placed in a Corner of my Room, and
pleases me the more because it does every
thing I require of it in the most profound Silence.
My Landlady and her Daughters are so well
acquainted with my Hours of Exercise, that they
never come into my Room to disturb me whilst I
am ringing.” Addison was making a pun. His
exercise apparatus was called a dumbbell, and
when he used it for exercise, his landlady and
her daughter (the belles with whom he lived)
were silent (they were dumb).

Don’t select a foam mat; they’re too thick and too short for yoga-with-weights
exercises. Foam mats are made for aerobic exercising.
In the yoga community, some ecology-minded practitioners object to using
synthetic materials. You can now buy natural rubber mats and mats made
from hemp. These mats are considered more “earth friendly.” Look for a
dense, sturdy mat without a slippery surface (see the appendix in this book
for information about obtaining these mats).
Due to the popularity of yoga, every Tom, Dick, and Harriet has gotten into
the yoga-mat business, and some manufacturers don’t really know what
they’re doing. People in our yoga classes often complain about the yoga mats
they’ve purchased because the mats wear down quickly, slide across the
floor during exercises, and get slippery from sweat. We recommend mats
made by Airex, Tapas, and Prana; you can buy these mats at sporting goods
stores, and the appendix explains where you can find them on the Internet.
Assembling Your Workout Ensemble
What you wear for a yoga-with-weights workout doesn’t especially matter as
long as your outer clothes are loose, comfortable, and easy to breathe in.
Don’t wear shirts and pants that restrict your movements in any way or drag
on the floor, and never wear a belt; the waistband of your pants must be
loose so your breathing isn’t constricted or confined. For the sake of comfort,
34
Part I: Getting Started 
Washing your yoga mat
You need to wash your yoga mat from time to
time. You’ll know when it needs washing
because your nose will tell you as much. You can
buy special soap for washing yoga mats at nat-
ural food stores and yoga studios. You can also
buy it on the Internet (the appendix lists compa-
nies that sell yoga products). Be on the lookout
for soaps that make your mat sticky or slippery;
we’ve had good luck with the “Yoga Mat Spray
Wash” made by Vermont Soap Works.
To wash your mat, fill the bathtub halfway with
water, add a few drops of cleaner (as recom-
mended), swirl the water around to distribute the
cleaner, and submerge your mat for a minute.
Then apply a sponge or washcloth to each side
of the mat. Next, drain the water from the tub
and rinse your mat thoroughly with fresh water.
Air-dry the mat, but not in direct sunlight; never
put a yoga mat in the dryer because it loses its
shape. Mats usually take 24 hours to dry thor-
oughly. Make sure your mat is completely —
and we mean completely — dry before rolling it
up; otherwise, it will mildew and acquire a terri-
ble smell.

wear clothes with natural and breathable fibers. You can find these clothes in
many sporting goods stores, outdoor outfitters, and yoga retail stores, as well
as on the Internet (see the appendix).
For undergarments, women should wear an athletic or Spandex bra that lifts
their breasts and presses them into their bodies. For top-heavy women, this
is important for balancing as well as for comfort.
Men should wear (and how do we put this delicately?) tight-fitting — but not
too tight-fitting — underwear from which no items may escape and see the
light of day. We occasionally get horror-story complaints in our yoga classes
from students who have witnessed other students violating this important
underwear rule.
Spandex running shorts are excellent for yoga with weights. They support
your muscles and keep them warm, and they permit you to move without
restriction. Prana and other yoga-product manufacturers offer clothing lines
designed especially for yoga practitioners. The appendix in this book shows
you how to find yoga clothes on the Internet.
Shopping for Shoes
You don’t need shoes for a yoga-with-weights workout because balancing starts
with your feet, and when your feet are bare, your muscles work more actively
to help you balance. So, why do we discuss shoes in this chapter? Because in
Chapter 6, we assert that taking a short walk is a necessary warm-up exercise
before working out, and assuming you want to walk outdoors, you need good
shoes. Here’s some advice for getting the right pair of walking shoes:
 Choose shoes with arch supports that are designed for exercising.
 Buy a new pair of shoes when your soles start to wear down. Walking
and running in worn-out shoes can cause your feet and ankles to col-
lapse, which can strain muscles and tendons in your feet and calves.
Worn-out shoes can also cause problems in your lower back, upper
back, and shoulders. If you walk and run daily, you probably need a new
pair of shoes every six months.
 Make sure you have enough room inside your shoes for socks and for
swelling. Your feet swell when you exercise.
How the heels of your shoes wear down can tell you a lot about your body align-
ment. If the slope of your shoe heel shows more wear on the outside of the heel,
your outer pelvis muscles are weak. If the slope shows more wear on the inside of
the heel, your inner-thigh muscles are weak. Any slope in the heels of your shoes
means that you’re straining your ankles.
35
Chapter 2: Gearing Up

Keeping Water on Hand 
to Stay Hydrated
All exercisers must pay attention to fluid intake, because as you lose water
when you exercise, you run the risk of being dehydrated. Some yoga exer-
cises squeeze and soak your kidneys, which releases toxins in your body. You
need to drink water to help flush out those toxins. We recommend having
water on hand whenever you do yoga-with-weights exercises.
The U.S. government recommends drinking eight glasses of water a day, but
how much you need to drink depends on how active you are. People’s bodies
and levels of activity are different. If you sit at a desk all day, you don’t need
to drink eight glasses. However, if you’re exercising and running about, and
especially if you’re sweating, you need more than eight glasses. You have to
pay attention to the water you drink and how you feel.
You can tell when you’re dehydrated by listening to your body:
 You get a dry throat.
 Your lips start sticking together.
 You get a faint headache.
 Your urine is a dark color.
Many people make the mistake of drinking a lot of water right before they exercise.
What they don’t know is that the water they drink right before a workout or during
a workout doesn’t hydrate their bodies. The water you drink three to four hours
before your workout quenches your body’s thirst. Plan ahead and drink plenty of
water before you exercise, especially if you work out in a hot room or gym where
you sweat profusely. Keep a bottle of water at your side during your workout in
case you need to take a sip, because you need to continue replacing the sweat you
lose. After your workout, replenish the fluid you lost with a nice glass of fresh water.
If you soak your shirt during a workout, drink more water. Coffee, tea, and
soda are dehydrating. For every cup of coffee, tea, or soda you drink during
the day, drink an extra 8 ounces of water.
Get a 1.5-liter or 1-quart container of quality drinking water and sip from it through-
out the day. Drinking slowly over the course of the day makes for better hydration
and absorption of water by your body. Guzzling, on the other hand, doesn’t give
your body enough time to absorb the water. By carrying a water bottle with you,
you can tell at a glance exactly how much water you’ve consumed, and you know
whether you’re staying properly hydrated.
If you use plastic bottles to carry your water, look for the kind that don’t decom-
pose as readily, because plastic leaches into the water and can be harmful. Stores
such as REI (www.rei.com) carry high-quality plastic containers.

C
ongratulations on your decision to take the plunge and try out yoga with
weights. This chapter ushers you to the next phase of your journey —
from your decision to start the workout to your preparations for the workout.
We advise you on how to find the time to exercise and make a place in your
home for working out. We describe why exercising in front of a mirror is so
helpful, and we look into whether heating the room as you exercise is worth-
while. Finally, we examine the pros and cons of listening to music when you
exercise, how to choose a class and an instructor if you want to venture out
of your home, and the importance of yoga etiquette.
Finding the Time to Exercise
And the number one reason most people give for not exercising is . . . “I can’t
find the time.” Between work, family obligations, and necessary activities
such as eating and sleeping, people don’t get around to exercising. They just
can’t find the time, although the fact that they haven’t exercised eats away at
them all day long.
However, yoga with weights is easier on your schedule than you may think
and well worth the sacrifice of your time. One workout will inspire you to do
the next because the workouts feel good and you get so much in return for
the amount of time you put in. The yoga-with-weights workout has many ben-
efits and advantages over other exercise programs; we look at these advan-
tages here and answer the question, “Why should I sacrifice my time for yoga
with weights?”

Some people use lists to help them make the commitment to exercising.
When you wake up in the morning, write down the tasks you want to com-
plete during the day, and check off activities on the list as you complete
them. This way, you can direct your attention to the task at hand instead of
wasting energy and time remembering everything that you have to get done.
Include a yoga-with-weights workout on your list to help you prioritize your
activities and make room for a workout. You can fit your workout in your
schedule, even if it means rearranging your other tasks. (See Chapter 19 for
some more motivation to amp up your workout schedule.)
Because minimal space (and equipment)
is required
One of the advantages yoga with weights has over other exercise programs is
that you can do it anywhere — well, anywhere you can fit a yoga mat. Here
are some tips for people who work in offices and for parents at home:
 Close your office door at lunchtime, turn down the lights so it looks like
nobody’s home, and do the exercises right there.
Keep a set of hand and ankle weights in your office for occasions when
you can exercise.
 If you work in a cubicle and don’t have the floor space to exercise, book
a conference room for 20 minutes or find a spot outside.
If you notice your coworkers silently wishing they could exercise along
with you, ask them to join in.
 Moms and dads on the go should try to exercise when their children are
taking naps or when they’re at school. You can also try to find a babysit-
ter for an hour or two.
Don’t feel like you’re being selfish by finding time to exercise. By taking
good care of yourself, by building more lean muscle mass, and by build-
ing the strength and stamina to take care of you and your baby or you
and your kids and family, you’ll discover peace of mind and newfound
energy resources.
Because it’s a quick workout
Unlike a running and weightlifting session or a trip to the gym, a yoga-with-
weights workout takes only a tiny bit of your day. The timesaving factor
shows up in many places:
38
Part I: Getting Started 

 You get a full-body workout in the same time it would take to work out
only one body part in the gym.
 You don’t get as sweaty and tired, which means you can perhaps skip a
shower if you do the exercises at work.
 You can work out just about anywhere; you don’t have to take the time
to travel to and from a gym or yoga studio.
 You can practice your breathing and relaxation techniques during your
coffee breaks or while you’re stuck in traffic.
If cutting a full 20-to-30 minute slot out of your day to exercise is still too
problematic or requires you to juggle too many appointments, you can divide
the 20-to-30 minute workout into halves or thirds. For example, do the first
four exercises in a workout in the morning and the second four exercises in
the afternoon. Try keeping this book on your desk. When you come to a lull
in your day — you know, one of those sluggish moments when you’ve fin-
ished one task and can’t decide which of the numerous other tasks needs
your attention — open this book and do a single exercise. If you’re a mom or
dad at home with the children, sneak off for a minute or two throughout the
day and do one exercise. Your mind will feel clearer, and by the end of the
day, you’ll have completed an entire workout.
Because it replaces snacking
Many people can find time to snack, but they can’t seem to set aside time to
exercise. Why is that? A yoga-with-weights workout can take as little as 20
minutes, or about twice the 10 minutes you devote to snacking. Why not
forego the snack (or just a couple snacking sessions) and do the exercises
instead? You can use the time in the mid-afternoon that you usually devote to
snacking for exercising, which gives you a bunch of different benefits:
 You may get a better energy boost from exercising than you experience
from heavy snacking.
Exercising speeds up your metabolism and makes your body more effi-
cient at processing calories and fat, which can help you lose weight and
feel more energetic. Your heart beats faster, and your body functions
more efficiently.
 You spare yourself the guilt and remorse of not exercising and feel
happy that you took the time.
 You don’t add to your daily calorie intake.
 You lose excess weight and help to keep your body healthy.
39
Chapter 3: Preparing for Your First Workout

You may also consider skipping a big lunch now and then in favor of a yoga-
with-weights workout. Again, you get the energy benefits of eating a light
lunch without the excess calories. Or, instead of skipping lunch altogether,
have a light and easy-to-digest snack — an energy bar or protein drink, for
example — and then work out. Snack with healthy foods when you feel like it.
Explore and experiment with your bodily needs to find out which foods work
best for you. Getting to know yourself better is part of the fun.
Everyone’s metabolism is different, and everyone has a best time for exercis-
ing. Yoga with weights requires you to stretch, and some people are too 
stiff in the morning to stretch. Some people prefer not to exercise at night
because it speeds up their metabolism and gives them energy boosts, which
makes it hard for them to fall asleep. Most people use trial and error to dis-
cover the best times for them to exercise during the day. Listen to your body
to understand how exercise affects your daily energy cycles, and discover
the best time of day for you to exercise. When you discover that time and
decide how often to work out, build a regular exercise schedule for doing
yoga-with-weights exercises, and stick to your schedule.
Creating Your Workout 
Sanctuary at Home
If you intend to do your yoga-with-weights workouts at home, more power to
you (see the section “Working Out in a Group Setting” later in this chapter if
you want to work out with others). You can carve out a personalized, private
place to work out, you can exercise in front of a mirror, and you can adjust
the room temperature and other settings to your specifications. We discuss
these topics in the pages that follow.
Setting aside some space
Creating a workout space for yoga with weights is easy enough, because you
don’t need very much space. If you have enough room to fit a yoga mat, you
have plenty of space. Section off a corner of a room, a place on the deck, a
few square feet in the backyard, or a few square feet on the roof, provided the
roof of your house isn’t slanted. Or you can keep it simple and create a spe-
cial, sacred workout place in your home for exercising.
We believe strongly in the benefits of exercising outside if you can manage it.
As long as you don’t expose yourself to winds or unkind breezes, direct sun-
light, or voyeuristic neighbors, the great outdoors is one of the best places
for a yoga-with-weights workout. The fresh air adds to the benefits you get
from yoga breathing, and you feel more free-spirited and thankful to be alive
when you’re in nature.
40
Part I: Getting Started 

Yoga with weights is different from most exercise programs because it chal-
lenges your powers of concentration. In fact, some exercises test and develop
your ability to focus more than they do your physical strength. Therefore,
you should choose a place to exercise where distractions won’t bother you.
Not everyone can swing this, of course, but if you’re fortunate enough to
have a large house or a fenced-in backyard, see if you can devote an area to
yoga-with-weights exercises. By establishing a place away from the rigors and
demands of your daily life, you’ll find it easier to concentrate on your exer-
cises, deep breathing, and meditation. This special room or backyard space
can be a source of resilience during difficult and demanding periods.
Keep your yoga mat, weights, and this book in your designated workout area
(if your area is inside) so you can start exercising as soon as you set foot in
it. You can keep this space simple or decorate it with fitness, yoga, medita-
tion, or spa-style decor. Simple, bare, or elaborate — it’s up to you. As soon
as you set foot in your area, you should know you’re there for one purpose —
to work on yoga with weights. Knowing this helps you get into the exercise
mindset. Think of your exercise space as a magic land or sanctuary where
your health is the utmost concern. As soon as you step into the sanctuary,
the exercises begin and nothing else concerns you.
Exercising in front of a mirror
If you have the room to hang a mirror in your exercise area, do so. Exercising
in front of a mirror gives you the opportunity to make like a yoga-with-weights
instructor and observe your workout so you know when you’re making mis-
takes or doing exercises incorrectly. Apart from showing how beautiful or
handsome you are, the mirror shows you when your body is aligned correctly
during an exercise. Having the correct alignment is essential in yoga with
weights, because the exercises rely on your balance to work different muscle
groups and tax the core muscles in your trunk and torso.
Pay attention to whether your body is in proper alignment with the following
tips in mind:
 Posture: If you stand during an exercise, stand up straight and look
straight ahead. Traditional yoga teaches that body energy moves
through the spine. Make sure your spine is erect so your body is ener-
gized and open.
 Shoulders: Don’t shrug your shoulders; keep your breast bone gently
lifted and your collarbones wide with your shoulders firmly on your
back. Don’t slouch or cave in. Except for the occasional exercise when
we ask you to roll your shoulders forward, you should stay gently lifted
in the chest and breathe evenly into your body.
41
Chapter 3: Preparing for Your First Workout

Most people have one shoulder that’s higher than the other. Correct this
imbalance when you see it in the mirror by consciously breathing into
your imbalanced side, as if you’re inflating it. This gently unlocks your
body and improves your posture.
 Legs: In exercises in which we ask you to move one foot forward and the
other foot back, make sure your legs are balanced and your body weight
is equally distributed between both legs. Is one foot too far forward or
too far back? You can tell with a glance in the mirror.
 Knees: In squatlike poses where we ask you to bend your knees and sit
in an imaginary chair, some people hardly bend their knees. Don’t be
afraid to bend them — the movement is good for you. If you have stiff
knees, always warm up first (see Chapter 6) and focus on the balls of
your feet being on the floor when you bend your knees — this gives you
a solid base. Never force or lock your kneecaps back; using your thigh
muscles above your knees, gently lift your knees upward and into your
thigh bones to strengthen the knee area for greater support.
 Feet: In most standing exercises, your feet are parallel to one another.
Don’t turn your feet out. When we ask you to place your feet below your
hips or place them “hips’ width apart,” look to see if your feet are
directly below your hips and if your stance isn’t wider than your hips.
The only drawback of doing the exercises in front of the mirror is that you
may miss the from-the-inside-out experience of yoga. Recognizing and feeling
each breath, moment, and exercise from the inside out is what makes yoga
with weights an empowering practice. If you gaze in the mirror and look at
yourself only from the outside in, you miss an aspect of the exercises and
never discover what yoga is really about.
In our classes, we occasionally notice students gazing with puppy love at
their reflections in the mirror, and that’s okay. Admiring yourself is allowed.
Why not? It sometimes happens that someone who feels self-conscious and
thinks he or she isn’t beautiful discovers otherwise in the mirror. As long as
you do the exercises and complete the workout, you’re allowed to admire
yourself. So strike that pose and then get over it so you can dive deep within
yourself for the real rewards.
Use this book as a tool. Compare the exercise photos you see in this book to
your reflection in the mirror to find out whether you’re striking the right
poses as you exercise.
Turning up (or turning down) the heat
Some yoga instructors and yoga schools believe in heating the exercise room.
The idea is for the excess heat to warm and loosen your muscles, making
them easier to stretch. People turn up the thermostats in exercise rooms 
for the same reason they take warm baths. Heat relaxes muscles from the
42
Part I: Getting Started 

outside in. It allows for a greater range of motion in the ligaments, joints, and
muscles. Capillaries — the extremely small vessels in body tissue that trans-
port blood from the arteries to the veins — dilate in the heat, which helps
deliver oxygen to tissue and muscles.
Exercising in heat also offers some subtle benefits:
 The heat may force you to slow down and do the exercises safely.
 Your heart beats faster to cool down your body, and this stimulated cir-
culation speeds up body metabolism.
 The increased circulation and pumping action of your heart breaks
down glucose and fat.
 The heat gives you a cardiovascular workout.
 The heat cleanses your body as you eliminate toxins through sweat.
Doing yoga with weights in a heated room sounds like a good deal. Stretching is
a vital part of yoga with weights, and the heat helps you stretch. And the other
benefits of exercising in a heated room aren’t too shabby, either. You should
run to your exercise area and turn up the thermostat immediately, right? The
answer is: maybe. Exercising in a heated room has disadvantages, too.
Different people have different reactions to heat. Some of the reactions are
harmless quirks:
 You may get very uncomfortable when sweat pours down your back and
your heart starts beating faster.
 Sweat can be slippery on your yoga mat.
 The heat can keep you from relaxing, and relaxation is an essential part
of the yoga frame of mind — a frame of mind that keeps you safe and
growing in your practice.
Exercising in a heated room can also give you a case of lazy muscles. When a
muscle gets too warm and relaxed, it can get lazy or groggy. It doesn’t want to
work anymore, and neither do you. If you’ve had the experience of sitting in a
warm, comfortable bath and not wanting to ever get out, you know what lazy
muscles are. You can find yourself stopping in the middle of a workout to use
your yoga mat like a hammock rather than an exercise device.
Some reactions to heat are dangerous. Heat can add some unwelcome dimen-
sions to the yoga practice:
 If you have high blood pressure, and you’re concerned for the health of
your heart, exercising in a hot room and cracking a profuse sweat can be
frightening. Avoid exercising in the heat if the health of your heart is
compromised or if you suspect in any way that exercising in the heat is
bad for your health.

Chapter 3: Preparing for Your First Workout

Consult your doctor before you decide to heat your exercise area if
these thoughts enter your head.
 If you put an emphasis on pushing yourself further every time you exer-
cise, you may do more harm than good in a heated environment. More is
not always better, especially when it comes to your joints. Because
warmer muscle tissue yields more easily, you run the risk of stretching
beyond optimal limits and compromising joint tissue. A loose joint that
you overstretch is like a loose door hinge that prevents the door from
closing tightly and fitting in the frame.
Exercising in heat pushes you to the edge, and some people like being there.
In our experience, certain type-A personalities who like getting their adrena-
lin and endorphins flowing enjoy the extra challenge of exercising in hot
rooms. However, exercising gung-ho style can get you in trouble. When you
exercise, always work to your capacity without compromising the stability
and integrity of your joints, connective tissue, and muscles. Going at it full
bore in a hot room makes it harder to maintain the mindfulness and aware-
ness that yoga with weights calls for.
Still, some like it hot. If you’re that kind of person, and you don’t have health
concerns, go ahead and raise the room temperature to 85 or 90°F. But remem-
ber that it isn’t necessary to go that high to have a good yoga-with-weights
workout; you can push yourself with 70 to 75°F just fine.
Don’t expose yourself to drafts or a cold room when you exercise, because the
cold air makes your muscles contract.
Jazzing up your workout with music
You may remember exercise programs from the 1980s that featured aerobic
workouts accompanied by upbeat music. The idea was for the music to moti-
vate you to exercise harder and to help you keep a tempo. These programs
introduced many people to the concept of exercising to music. Thanks to
modern portable music players, you can take your music with you when you
exercise. It seems that half of all joggers have portable music players attached
to their arms or waists. Half of all gym goers are also wired for sound.
It’s up to you to decide whether you want to listen to music as you do your
yoga-with-weights workouts. As the saying goes, music calms the wild beast.
It can relax you, inspire you, motivate you, empower you, or rev you up,
depending on your state of mind and what type of music you’re listening to.
In terms of yoga with weights, music can
 Help you set a pace for your workout
 Inspire you to keep going
 Comfort you when you’re struggling with a difficult exercise
44
Part I: Getting Started 

However, music can also be a distraction. Throughout the exercises in this
book, we ask you to “listen to your body” — to feel your muscles and ligaments
as they stretch or contract so you can exert just the right amount of pressure
and effort. If you introduce music into your yoga-with-weights workout, it can
 Prevent you from hearing your body and the sound of your breath
 Speed up the tempo of an exercise so you move too quickly
 Keep you from focusing and working out safely
45
Chapter 3: Preparing for Your First Workout
Meeting the challenge of exercising on your own
If you’re the kind of person who likes to exercise
on your own, or if you can’t find yoga instructors
where you live, you face additional challenges
when exercising with yoga with weights. Here
are some tips to help you on your way:
 Take your time. Nobody gets it right the first
time. Take your time to understand what
you’re supposed to do in each exercise.
Fortunately for you, yoga is an intuitive dis-
cipline. Nine times out of ten, you can “feel
it” when you’re doing an exercise right. You
can feel the muscle groups at work and
understand how each exercise is supposed
to challenge you.
 Start with warm-ups. In a yoga-with-
weights exercise class, instructors never
neglect the warm-up phase of a workout,
but people exercising at home often skip the
warm-ups because they want to jump right
in. Chapter 6 explains how to warm up for
the exercises.
 Practice the exercises without the weights
initially. Mastering many of the exercise
forms is hard enough without having to lift
the weights as well. After you understand
how to do an exercise, strap on the ankle
weights and grab the hand weights.
 Use a mirror. The first few times you do an
exercise, do it slowly and watch yourself in
the mirror. See the section “Exercising in
front of a mirror” earlier in this chapter for
advice about what to look for when you
exercise before a mirror. Try to make your
reflection in the mirror look like the exercise
photographs in this book.
 Read this book carefully. You are your best
teacher and guide. You have wisdom and
intelligence within you, and you have to tap
your inner resources. In the end, because
no instructor can tell you whether you’re
doing an exercise correctly, it’s up to you to
understand how to do an exercise and get
the most out of it. That means reading this
book more carefully than you would nor-
mally read an exercise book.
 Record your voice reading the exercises
aloud, and play back the recording as you
exercise. This gives you the illusion that
you’re in an exercise class and spares you
from having to interrupt an exercise to con-
sult this book.

If you prefer to exercise to musical accompaniment, ask yourself from time to
time in the middle of a workout whether the music is a distraction. If it isn’t a
distraction, enjoy it for all its worth. Experiment with different kinds of music
to find recordings that help you work out. We know people who listen to
sounds from nature — ocean waves and babbling brooks — when they exer-
cise; others love a good rhythm and beat. Any recording that deepens your
yoga-with-weights workout is okay with us.
Working Out in a Group Setting
As of this writing, yoga with weights is a relatively new discipline. You can’t
walk into any yoga studio and ask to meet the yoga-with-weights instructor,
because the studio may not have one — yet. We expect yoga with weights to
become a popular exercise discipline in the years to come because it draws
from deep tradition and rich experience in yoga and weightlifting. However, if
you want instruction apart from what you can get from this book right away,
you’ll have to make do by finding an athletic trainer or yoga instructor. This
part of the chapter helps you do just that. We give you tips on finding the right
instructor, finding an affordable class, and practicing proper yoga etiquette.
Getting help from an athletic trainer or
yoga instructor
Your yoga-with-weights workout can benefit from the help of an athletic
trainer (also called a personal trainer). As little as an hour or two of instruc-
tion from a trainer can teach you the basics of weight training and show you
the basic postures, even if the trainer doesn’t have a background in yoga. The
trainer can show you how to lift weights so you get a good workout without
injuring yourself.
Similarly, a yoga instructor can help you with the basic yoga poses, even if he
or she hasn’t been trained in yoga with weights. Some poses we include in the
exercises in this book, such as the warrior (shown in the Warrior I; Chapter 8),
the downward-facing dog (shown in the Dog to Plank; Chapters 8 and 10), and
the tree (shown in the Tree; Chapter 11), come straight from traditional yoga
practices.
We recommend finding a certified and experienced yoga instructor, but if you
can’t find one, don’t fret. Any high-quality yoga class that inspires you will
help with your yoga-with-weights exercises because you discover the basics
of aligning your body and breathing. When you go home to practice the exer-
cises in this book, you’ll have a better understanding of yoga mechanics.
46
Part I: Getting Started 

Don’t hesitate to show this book to your yoga instructor. If he or she is adventur-
ous, your instructor may take an interest in yoga with weights. Yoga and fitness
instructors often look for new, worthwhile exercise techniques that they can fold
into their repertoires. If your instructor decides to take on yoga with weights, you
may be able to come along for the ride. Who knows? Maybe you’ll get a “finder’s
fee” and not have to pay for your lessons.
Finding the right instructor for you
People ask us all the time, “How do I find a good yoga instructor?” We can’t
give a simple answer to this question because there are so many different
yoga schools, and every instructor is different. No single yoga teacher or
yoga school is suitable for everyone. You have to find an instructor who fits
your personality and meets your health goals.
Start your search for a good instructor by finding out if the teacher is certi-
fied. No single governing body certifies yoga instructors, and you can obtain
a certificate with as little as a two-week training course, so receiving certifica-
tion doesn’t mean an instructor is necessarily qualified to teach yoga. But,
generally speaking, a certified instructor is better than one who isn’t certi-
fied. Being certified at least demonstrates a desire to learn about yoga and
how to teach it to others.
The best way to investigate a teacher is to judge for yourself. Take a class
from a teacher whose style appeals to you. Here are some questions to
ponder as you decide whether an instructor is right for you:
 Did you feel safe in the class? A good teacher is mindful of his or her
students’ experience level and doesn’t ask students to do exercises
beyond their abilities.
 Did the teacher offer modifications to the exercises? Good teachers
offer simpler, modified versions of exercises if they suspect or notice
that students in the class can’t do an exercise. This way, students can
get some of the benefits of the exercise without putting themselves at
risk for an injury. A good teacher can give guidance to advanced and
beginning students at the same time.
 Did the teacher give modifications without directing the instructions
to a specific person? A good teacher makes everyone feel at home.
Except in praise, calling attention to a single person is inconsiderate. It
makes the student feel self-conscious and takes away from his or her
ability to do yoga exercises.
 Did the teacher ask if any new students were in class? Good teachers
want to know their students’ backgrounds so they can tailor their instruc-
tions accordingly. When teachers ask if new students are in class, it shows
that they want to meet their students’ needs.
47
Chapter 3: Preparing for Your First Workout

 Did the teacher appear to have eyes in the back of his or her head?
Good teachers seem to know what’s going on in all parts of the room,
whether there are 3 or 30 students.
No teacher is right for everyone. Get a reference from a friend or health prac-
titioner, and then go and see for yourself. Different people have different per-
sonalities and are attracted to different schools of yoga and different yoga
instructors. Some like grueling workouts in heated rooms so they fall in pud-
dles of sweat when the classes are over. Others like to leave classes in
advanced states of relaxation and repose. Trust your instincts and intuition
when you choose a yoga teacher.
When you attend a class for the first time, introduce yourself to the teacher
before class begins. Tell the teacher whether you have any special needs,
whether you have injuries, if you’re pregnant, and what your background in
yoga is.
Considering the cost of taking 
yoga classes
How much a yoga class costs depends on what part of the country you’re in.
Classes range between $10 and $20 a session. Most yoga studios offer a pack-
age of five, ten, or more classes. Buying the classes in a package lowers the
cost of the individual lessons. Classes run for 60, 75, or 90 minutes. Every
studio is different, so to find information on sessions, packages, and so on,
contact your local studio over the phone or on the Web.
Some health clubs have started offering yoga classes. If you’re a member of a
club that offers classes, you may be able to attend without paying more than
your monthly membership fee. If you aren’t a member of a club, look for
health clubs that offer yoga classes. If your club doesn’t offer the classes, nag
the manager about it . . . well, “nag” isn’t the right word. Try cajoling or per-
suading the manager to offer yoga classes.
Another way to find a bargain is to look into yoga studios in your area to see
if they offer any workshops. Typically, master teachers run workshops, and
they focus on one area of the body or one type of training. A weekend work-
shop may run two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon.
Some workshops run over several weeks, and you attend the classes on the
same day each week. Workshops are usually more rigorous in part because
they last longer than standard classes, but also because they focus on a
theme and give you a more thorough, in-depth practice experience. An inten-
sive workshop can take you to the next level in your practice if you’re ready
and have a good experience.
48
Part I: Getting Started 

Yoga workshops cost a minimum of $15 to $25 an hour, which is more than
standard lessons, but the instruction is more focused and organized.
Workshops and retreats give participants the chance to experience longer,
extended instruction. Trainings serve to educate you on the study of posture
and the philosophy of yoga.
Brushing up on your yoga-with-weights
etiquette
If Miss Manners were a yoga instructor, she would want you to observe these
fine points of yoga-with-weights etiquette:
 Respect the yoga tradition. Be mindful of others and of the yoga tradi-
tion when you enter the exercise room. Yoga classes are different from
fitness classes in that most instructors prefer a quiet, contemplative
atmosphere in the room.
 Respect the silence. As much as you want to ask a question of your
instructor from time to time, try to wait until class is finished. Only one
voice should be heard in the classroom — the teacher’s. Remember that
other students are concentrating on their workouts and on how their
bodies feel, and they’re listening carefully to the instructor’s words —
you should be, too. Asking a question in class may break the other stu-
dents’ concentration and disturb the flow of the class.
 Don’t arrive late. Arriving late to any appointment is rude, but in yoga
classes it’s also a matter of safety. The first few exercises in a yoga class
are meant to warm you up physically and mentally for the later exer-
cises. If you skip the warm-up exercises, you may subject yourself to
injury later on. Some instructors believe you should skip the class if you
arrive more than five minutes late.
 Don’t leave early. Some people have a “What’s next?” mentality. They
can’t focus on the present because they’re always looking ahead to their
next activities. This kind of thinking runs contrary to the yoga philoso-
phy, which says you should always be aware of the present and what
you’re doing in the here and now. Even if you’re eager to go to your next
appointment, don’t leave class early.
 Don’t snap your mat open. Admittedly, this is a pet peeve with us, but
too many students snap their yoga mats open when they place them on
the floor, and the noise disturbs others. It sounds like a giant rubber
band snapping.
 Leave your shoes and other belongings at the back of the room.
Practically speaking, if students litter their shoes and belongings around
the room, it makes for an untidy and distracting mess. Leave your per-
sonal stuff in the back where others don’t have to look at it. Spiritually
49
Chapter 3: Preparing for Your First Workout

speaking, you symbolically leave the world outside when you leave your
belongings in the back of the room. You let go of outside distractions
and say to yourself, “This is my time to focus on myself and my body.”
 Be careful with the weights. Place the weights parallel to the floor so
they don’t tip over and fall on anyone. And never drop the weights. In
old-style weightlifting, lifters dropped the weights on the floor when
they finished the exercises. To keep from making too much noise, harm-
ing the floors, annoying the neighbors below, and hurting your toes,
gently place the weights on the floor in a place where no one will step on
them.
 Deal with flatulence. As we explain in Chapter 1, many yoga exercises
fall in the squeeze-and-soak category, which means they massage your
internal organs. This is good for you because the exercises squeeze
toxins from your body, but they sometimes produce an unwanted side
effect — flatulence. Usually the culprits are newcomers to the class, so
be warned when newcomers start to twist and turn, especially if their
mats are next to yours. Because deep breathing is an essential part of
yoga with weights, and because the doors and windows are usually
closed in exercise rooms, flatulence can be a real problem. As instruc-
tors, we’re sometimes tempted to comment on flatulence to relieve the
tension of having a silent-but-deadly killer in the room, but we don’t
want to embarrass the perpetrator, so we remain silent.
You can help prevent flatulence by not eating in the hour or two before
class, avoiding foods that trigger flatulence in your body, and chewing
your food slowly and carefully. After you gain experience and get health-
ier through regular exercise and a conscious choice of foods, excessive,
uncontrollable flatulence usually diminishes.
 Don’t wear scents. Many people are sensitive to fragrances, no matter
how lovely or natural those fragrances purport to be. Remember that
you’re part of a group when you attend class. Come smelling as Mother
Nature intended you to smell — fresh and clean, with no added fra-
grance. Everyone will breathe a sigh of relief.

A Breath of Fresh Air:
Yoga Breathing Techniques
In This Chapter
 Looking at the mental benefits of proper breathing
 Exploring the health benefits of yoga breathing
 Reviewing step-by-step instructions for seven yoga breathing techniques
Your first and last acts on earth are one and the same — taking a breath.
Your breath is with you at the very beginning and it will be with you
until the very end. Breathing, you could say, is the most important activity
you do. You can live for days without water and weeks without food, but only
a few moments without breathing. Breath is your most intimate friend in life.
You connect with the world around you most intimately not only by touch,
sight, and hearing but also by breathing. The Sanskrit word for “life force,”
prana (pronounced prah-nah), is the same as the word for “breath.”
This chapter explores why yoga breathing is so good for you and how it can
benefit you during a yoga-with-weights workout. We also offer seven vibrant
breathing techniques that will relax and revitalize you and that you can carry
with you for the rest of your life.
Many people who study yoga report that the most practical lessons they
learn from their studies are not only how to exercise and meditate, but also
how to breathe in new and conscious ways that change their lives for the
better. Before you read this chapter, take a breath and notice how you feel.
Notice the air going in and out of your lungs and how the air feels in your
nose, mouth, and throat. By the time you finish reading this chapter, you may
breathe differently. The breath you’re taking now could be one of the last you
take in the old way.

Exploring the Breath-Mind Connection
You hear people say that when you get frustrated or angry you should “take a
deep breath and count to ten.” We can’t vouch for the counting to ten part,
but taking a deep breath is an excellent piece of folk wisdom. Deep breathing
really can calm your nerves. It can relax and center you. Some people can
even control the amount of pain they feel with breathing techniques. This
ability is one of the reasons why, in prenatal clinics, expectant mothers study
breathing techniques to control and help ease the pain of childbirth.
Breathing affects your state of mind, and for that reason, you can use breath-
ing techniques that are supportive in cultivating a different state of mind.
After you try these techniques, you may be delighted to find that you can
change the mood you’re in by breathing consciously and by paying attention
to how you breathe. Your brain requires more oxygen than most other parts
of your body. Supply it with the oxygen it needs to get more clarity of thought
and to be able to concentrate for longer periods of time. Better breathing also
affects your overall well-being. You get a greater sense of control over your
happiness. In short, you feel more grounded and happier. You’re more awake
to the world around you and keener to enjoy that world.
To explore and experience a yoga-with-weights workout to the highest
degree, we encourage you to focus on the sensations of your breathing. The
mind doesn’t wander as much if you establish a deep and rhythmic breath.
When you catch your mind wandering (and it will wander), you can pull it
back to the exercises by concentrating on your breath. Look at it this way:
Imagine that your wandering mind is like a boat being pulled out to sea by
the tide, but the boat is secured to a rope you hold in your hands. As the
boat is floating away, you gently pull it back one breath at a time until your
thoughts come back home to your body.
Besides helping you focus, conscientious breathing has an added benefit —
it makes your workout safer. In weight training, many injuries take place due
to repetitive stress; improper alignment; and throwing the weight around,
which aggravates joints, tendons, and muscles. If you’re distracted, preoccu-
pied, or lackadaisical when you work out, you invite injury. Watch a person
who has a great yoga-with-weights practice, and you notice his or her intense
level of commitment and concentration. You see this person breathing in a
deep and real way. Breathing helps you concentrate on your body so you
know precisely how much effort and strength to put into the exercises with-
out hurting yourself. The self-awareness that comes with conscientious
breathing can actually help prevent injuries.
54
Part II: Mastering the Basics 

Considering the Health Benefits 
of Yoga Breathing
Besides benefiting your mental outlook (a topic we explore in the previous
pages of this chapter), employing yoga breathing techniques offers many
benefits to your health. Here are a handful of them:
 Metabolism. Breathing well, as nature intended, is supportive to the
function of the digestive, respiratory, circulatory, and hormonal sys-
tems. Yoga breathing may be helpful in promoting your metabolic bal-
ance in everyday living. It may keep your body weight in check.
 Detoxification. Your lungs are a critical aspect of your daily detoxifica-
tion. When you exhale, you release carbon dioxide that has been passed
from your bloodstream into your lungs. Carbon dioxide is a waste prod-
uct of your body’s natural metabolism. By expelling air from the deepest
recesses of your lungs, you expel more carbon dioxide and you enable
your lungs to take in more oxygen.
 Oxygenation. One of the greatest benefits of yoga breathing is the 
oxygenation of all the cells in your body. The supply of oxygen to your
brain and the muscles of your body increases. Oxygen travels the blood-
stream by attaching to the hemoglobin in red blood cells. This oxygen
enables your body to metabolize vitamins, minerals, and other nutri-
ents. You get a lot of the same benefits from yoga breathing that you 
can get from visiting an oxygen bar, but you get them for free.
 Organ massage. Each time you inhale, your diaphragm descends and
your abdomen expands (your diaphragm is a muscle located a few
inches above your belly button; your abdomen is located over your
belly). This action massages your intestines, heart, and other organs
near your diaphragm. Proper breathing helps to promote improved cir-
culation in these organs. What’s more, it helps to strengthen and tone
your abdominal muscles.
 Posture. The breathing techniques encourage good posture. Poor pos-
ture can be a cause of incorrect breathing.
According to the yoga tradition, each person is allotted a certain number of
breaths, and after you exceed this number, your time on earth is finished. People
who breathe hurriedly and shallowly use up their allotment of breaths quickly, but
if you breathe slowly and consciously, your breath allotment lasts for many years.
Let this thoughtful idea remind you how valuable and life-expanding each breath
may be. Developing a breath that’s balanced, steady, and rhythmic — one that’s
never forced but deep and full — helps you live a long and healthy life.
55
Chapter 4: A Breath of Fresh Air: Yoga Breathing Techniques

Practicing Yoga Breathing Techniques
The breathing techniques we present here are designed to relax and energize
you. We didn’t invent these breathing techniques; they’re ancient practices
from traditional yoga. The breath is the bridge between the mind and body. In
traditional yoga, subtle breathwork and diaphragmatic breathing are helpful
in leading you toward deeper self-realization. The breathing techniques are
considered an art and science in the yoga system, and yoga teachers have
skillfully refined and perfected these breathing techniques over the centuries.
You can practice these breathing techniques by themselves or as you do
your yoga-with-weights workouts. You can consider these techniques “explo-
rations.” As you master these breathing techniques, pay attention to the
subtle and sometimes powerful ways that they affect your body and mind.
Get to know each technique so that you can call on it when you need it. For
example, depending on how the techniques make you feel, you may try the
Complete Breath when you’re anxious or the Ocean Breath when you’re low
on energy. You can do these breathing techniques while you’re sitting, lying
down, or standing.
After experimenting for a while, you discover the breath that feels best to you
while you’re working out. For each workout in this book, we suggest a certain
breath, but that doesn’t mean you can’t substitute a breath you prefer.
Following a few guidelines
No matter which breathing technique you undertake, follow these basic
breathing guidelines:
 Breathe through your nose unless we tell you to breathe through your
mouth. Breathing this way encourages you to breathe correctly and
slowly because you can’t force as much air through your nostrils as you
can your mouth. Nostril breathing slows the process down. It also helps
to filter and warm the air as it enters your body.
 Listen to yourself breathe. Does your breathing have a smooth and easy
rhythm? Breathing is akin to the sound and rhythm of ocean waves —
it’s a natural act that changes pace with your moods and health. The
breath is the link between the mind and the body. By listening to your
breathing, you begin to control your breathing, and, in turn, you notice
that you can gently shift your mood or disposition in subtle ways.
Working gently with the sound and the sensations of your breath, you
can subtly control how your body feels.
 Breathe rhythmically. If your breath stops or sounds rough, short, or
shallow, it’s a sign that you may be pushing too hard as you exercise.
Forcing your breath suggests that you have come to the edge and gone
56
Part II: Mastering the Basics 

in a bit too far. If your breath feels forced, take two or three Complete
Breaths (which we explain in the section “The Complete Breath” later in
this chapter) to get your rhythm and control back.
 Concentrate on making a smooth transition between each inhalation
and exhalation — focus on the point of stillness where one becomes
the other. Don’t hold your breath at the top of an inhalation; ride it a bit
over the top and then smoothly turn it into an exhalation. At the bottom
of an exhalation, ride it out just a bit as well, and then smoothly transi-
tion into a natural inhalation.
 Never force your breath beyond the natural capacity of your lungs. Full,
rhythmic, gentle breathing without strain is the goal of yoga breathing.
 Don’t practice yoga breathing in uncomfortable places where the air
is too cold or too hot. Like Goldilocks’ porridge, the air should be “just
right.” Find a place that feels comfortable to you.
 Straighten your posture. If you slouch, let your belly hang out, round
your shoulders, or stand without distributing and balancing the weight
of your body properly, you can’t possibly breathe well. If your posture is
poor, you’re crowding or collapsing your lungs and diminishing their
capacity to take in oxygen. Lucky for you, the yoga-with-weights exer-
cises in this book can improve your posture, and the combination of the
exercises and the breathing techniques can significantly increase the
amount of nourishing oxygen you take into your body.
The Complete Breath
The Complete Breath is a wonderful breath to live your life with — it’s the
basis of all other breathing techniques and is at the very heart of yoga-with-
weights exercises. The Complete Breath engages your entire respiratory
system. Besides raising and gently opening your collarbone and rib cage
area, you engage your abdomen evenly and activate your diaphragm natu-
rally, thus creating a full and deep breath.
The Complete Breath is a great way to relieve tension and stress. It improves
the quantity and quality of the oxygen that enters your body. It helps your
body find its balance and energy to live life. In times of stress, the Complete
Breath helps to combat shortness of breath and calm your nervous system.
Practice the Complete Breath when you feel angry, impatient, or nervous.
Ideally, you should inhale and exhale six times per minute when using the
Complete Breath. Breathing through your nostrils, you inhale four to six
counts at minimum, and you exhale six to ten counts at minimum. Of course,
this is the ideal, but if you’re new to yoga with weights, inhale as many
counts as you can without straining, and try to reach the four- to six-count
minimum.
57
Chapter 4: A Breath of Fresh Air: Yoga Breathing Techniques

Follow these steps to perform the Complete Breath:
1. While sitting, lying down, or standing, relax your shoulders and gaze
straight ahead or close your eyes.
Your mouth and jaw should be relaxed, your windpipe should feel open,
and your chin should be pointing gently down. Make sure your back is
erect but not rigid.
2. Inhaling slowly through your nose, feel your abdomen, your mid-body
(the diaphragm area), and your upper chest gently expand until you
fill your lungs to capacity.
Notice the breathing sensation everywhere, but especially in your upper
chest first. Feel your diaphragm moving calmly. Allow your ribs and
chest to remain soft, open, and relaxed.
3. Exhaling slowly through your nose, gently engage your abdomen.
Feel your body and your diaphragm gently coming back to center as you
empty your lungs.
Practice the Complete Breath ten times, inhaling to a count of four and exhal-
ing to a count of six.
Try taking the Complete Breath a step further by expanding your abdomen as
you inhale and feeling your rib cage expand as you fill your lungs to the brim
with air, as if you’re inflating a balloon. Begin to exhale by drawing your belly
in and up. Feel the sides of your ribs pressing or squeezing back in like a bel-
lows or accordion as you empty your lungs and allow your chest to relax.
Continue to breathe in this fashion for a minute or two.
Never force your lungs to inhale or expel air. Feel your lungs filling evenly and
calmly in all directions — up, down, into each side, forward, and back. As you
take Complete Breaths, see whether, by directing your attention there, you
can inflate and awaken sensations in the sides and back of your body as well
as in the front of your body. Practice in each area by isolating it first with
your mind and then directing your breath into each area for one, two, or
three breaths.
The Abdominal Breath
Do the Abdominal Breath when you’re feeling tension, stress, or fatigue. This
breath relaxes you. A few minutes of deep abdominal breathing can help
bring greater connectedness between your mind and your body. In essence,
the goal is to shift from upper chest, short, shallow breathing to deeper
abdominal breathing. Concentrate on your breath and try to breathe in and
out gently through your nose. With each breath, allow any tension in your
58
Part II: Mastering the Basics 

body to slip away. After you start breathing slowly with your abdominals, sit
quietly and enjoy the sensation of physical relaxation.
Follow these steps to practice the Abdominal Breath:
1. Lie on your back or sit comfortably in a chair.
2. Place one hand on your abdomen just above your pubic bone and
below your navel; place your other hand on your solar plexus right
beneath your breastbone.
3. Listening to your breath, inhale slowly and deeply through your 
nostrils — so deeply that your belly expands and you feel a wave of
breath moving into the bottom, or lowest recesses, of your lungs.
Get down to the bottom of your lungs with this inhalation, going as low
and as deep inside your lungs as you can. You can feel the rounding of
your abdomen in your hands such that your hands rise a bit and your
abdominal cavity pushes upward. Meanwhile, your chest opens and
expands gently as if your abdomen is a balloon filling with air evenly and
equally in all directions.
4. At the top of your inhalation, find the point of transition where the
inhale becomes an exhale.
At the top of every breath is a point of passage, the place where the
inhale ends and the exhale begins. Find that place within your lungs and
pause a moment to notice how your breath gently begins to shift in a
new direction.
5. To a count of six to eight (or more) seconds, exhale fully through your
nostrils.
Feel your whole body releasing tension and letting go. Allow your body,
including your arms and legs, to relax and go limp.
Do ten slow, full Abdominal Breaths.
Try to breathe smoothly and regularly without gasping for breath or letting
your breath out all at once. Let each exhalation roll out like a long, slow
ocean wave. Remember to notice that transition, or turning point, at the end
of each inhalation and exhalation when one becomes the other in a seamless
transition. If you can manage it, try to get in a rhythm and practice the
Abdominal Breath for 10 minutes.
The Abdominal Breath is very relaxing. It really works when done well, and for that
reason, you may not want to practice it while you’re driving. One of Sherri’s stu-
dents missed her freeway turnoff by three exits because she practiced Abdominal
Breathing behind the wheel of her car. She was able to induce such a deep state of
relaxation during her journey that she forgot her reason for driving her car. Be
careful and, along with driving safely, breathe wisely.
59
Chapter 4: A Breath of Fresh Air: Yoga Breathing Techniques

If your breathing becomes too rapid, short, or shallow, you may start hyper-
ventilating. And hyperventilating, in turn, sometimes can cause symptoms
similar to those of a panic attack. Hyperventilating occurs when you breathe
out too much carbon dioxide relative to the amount of oxygen in your blood-
stream. If you find that your breathing is shallow and you’re breathing in an
anxious way, try taking an Abdominal Breath. Taking Abdominal Breaths
helps you shift into deeper, more rhythmic breathing.
The Ocean Breath
The Ocean Breath — sometimes called “rib breathing” or the “upward-moving
breath” — oxygenates your blood. It stimulates your circulation and gives you
a burst of energy. This dynamic breath awakens you and brings you into the
present moment. It’s also a warming breath.
You emit a sound during the Ocean Breath — the sound (you guessed it) of an
ocean breeze. You stay in your chest and fill your lungs from the diaphragm
upward. To stay inflated, your lungs rely on a vacuumlike action inside your
chest, and then you push out a full, deep, and complete exhalation through
your nostrils. This breath is different from the Complete Breath (which we
explain earlier in this chapter) because you mostly engage your chest and rib
cage, and you gently contract your abdomen.
Follow these steps to practice the Ocean Breath:
1. Stand or sit comfortably with your spine straight.
2. Place your arms on your chest with the fingers of your right hand
tucked into your left armpit and the fingers of your left hand tucked
into your right armpit.
3. Close your eyes or gaze straight ahead with your windpipe open, your
jaw and mouth relaxed, and your chin pointing gently downward.
4. Inhale to a count of six to ten, engaging the sipping muscles in the
back of your throat as if you’re sipping through a straw, and feel your
ribs opening and your breath filling to the top of your lungs.
Inhale to whichever count you can manage best.
Pay attention to the tip of your nose as you inhale. It enhances the sen-
sation of filling your chest all the way up.
5. Gently, but with some commitment and determination, exhale
steadily through your nostrils until the exhale is complete.
Feel your breath passing from the back of your throat, across the roof of
your mouth, and out your nostrils. You hear a hissing sound, something
similar to the sound of a hose when you turn it on and the water begins
rushing out.
60
Part II: Mastering the Basics 

Never push too hard; this breath is dynamic, but never forced. Feel your-
self releasing the air. When you push the air out, your abdominal muscles
come into play a bit more. The exhale is something like a volcanic erup-
tion that begins at the diaphragm and rises with increasing strength.
Take 10 Ocean Breaths; pause to rest; do 10 more; pause to rest again; and if
you like the results, do 10 more for a total of 30 breaths. Then you can let
your abdomen relax and your breath normalize once again.
Perfecting the Ocean Breath takes time, especially when you try smoothing
out the transition between inhaling and exhaling, but stick with it. As yoga
teachers say, “Breath into breath, moment into moment.”
As you get better at the Ocean Breath, you may begin to notice a subtle sen-
sation, or tingling, in your spine. This subtle sensation begins in the base or
bottom of your spine and moves gently upward. When you exhale, you may
experience the gentle sensation of your breath moving downward, even
though the air is leaving your throat and nose. See whether you can detect
these two sensations — the tingling in your spine moving upward and your
breath moving downward — meeting in your solar plexus. Try to feel the
breath inside the breath. When the two sensations merge, you may experi-
ence an awakened inner consciousness and an overall sense of well-being.
The Balancing Breath
The object of the Balancing Breath is to develop a conscious control of your
breathing. Try this simple breathing technique when you feel tired or over-
whelmed or when you just want to clear your head for a moment. The
Balancing Breath is similar to the Complete Breath (which we cover earlier in
this chapter), except that you inhale and exhale to a count of four instead of
exhaling for a longer period of time.
Follow these steps to practice a Balancing Breath:
1. Sit, lie down, or stand with your shoulders, mouth, and jaw relaxed.
Your choice: Gaze softly straight ahead or close your eyes. Make sure
your back is erect but not rigid.
2. To a count of four, slowly inhale through your nose.
Feel your breath expanding into your abdomen, mid-body (the diaphragm
area), and upper chest. Without forcing, engage and gently fill your lungs
to their full capacity.
3. To a count of four, exhale slowly through your nose, drawing your
abdomen gently in and up to help send the breath smoothly out.
61
Chapter 4: A Breath of Fresh Air: Yoga Breathing Techniques

Although your breath empties from your lungs, focus on releasing it first
with your abdomen, and then with your diaphragm, and then with your
upper chest. Emit all the air from your lungs.
Practice the Balancing Breath six to ten times — inhaling to a count of four
and exhaling to a count of four — pause to rest for a moment, and then do
another six to ten Balancing Breaths.
As you begin to perfect the Balancing Breath, consider inhaling to eight
counts and exhaling to eight counts.
You can also inhale for four counts, hold the inhalation very softly for four
counts, and then exhale completely for four counts. Try to find a rhythm as you
do this variation on the Balancing Breath. Make your breath roll in like a wave;
hold softly so your lungs can drink in the oxygen; and gently exhale all the air.
The Alternate Nostril Breath
In the Alternate Nostril Breath, you breathe through one nostril at a time,
switching off from breath to breath (sorry, you can’t do this one if you’re con-
gested or have a stuffy nose). You may be surprised by how you feel as you
take Alternate Nostril Breaths. The breath offers many physical and subtle
benefits. Each nostril is associated with one cerebral brain hemisphere. The
right nostril is associated with the right brain hemisphere (where your spa-
tial perceptions begin), and the left nostril is associated with the left brain
hemisphere (where your verbal skills are). Breathing through alternate nos-
trils stimulates alternate brain hemispheres. In traditional yoga, the right nos-
tril is considered the warming and energetic one, and the left nostril is
considered the cool and calming one.
Practice the Alternate Nostril Breath to calm your mind and nervous system in
times of stress. It induces a powerful sense of being in the present moment and
increases your mental clarity and alertness.
Follow these steps to test-drive the Alternate Nostril Breath:
1. Sit comfortably with your eyes closed.
2. Close your right nostril by pressing your nose gently with your right
thumb, and then inhale through your left nostril to a count of four.
Feel your breath flowing into the open nostril. Notice if the air feels cool
or warm. See how deeply into your body you can detect the breath. Do
you feel it in your throat? The tops of your lungs? The bottoms?
3. Close your left nostril by gently pressing with your right ring finger
and pinky finger into your nose; at the same time, remove your thumb
from your right nostril and exhale through your right nostril to a
count of eight.
62
Part II: Mastering the Basics 

Ideally, you want to exhale twice as long as you inhale.
Exhale quietly and evenly into the lower, middle, and upper regions of
your lungs.
4. Repeat the breath, but this time close your left nostril and inhale
through your right to a count of four, and then close your right nostril
and exhale to a count of eight through your left nostril.
Start by doing six to ten complete Alternate Nostril Breath cycles. It requires
five to eight minutes of concentrated breathing.
As you develop your technique, try inhaling and exhaling for longer periods
of time, always keeping the 2-to-1 ratio of exhales to inhales. You should
never force your breathing, but you can lengthen the inhale and exhale to
longer counts as you develop your technique. For example, try inhaling for 
8 counts and exhaling for 16 counts.
The Cleansing Breath
The purpose of the Cleansing Breath is to clean and clear out your lungs.
This breath is unique, because instead of exhaling through your nose, you
exhale through your mouth as you purse your lips. Pursing your lips creates
pressure on your airways and helps keep them open so stale air can exit your
lungs. It feels almost as though you’re releasing pent-up emotions when you
do the Cleansing Breath. In effect, you emit a “sigh of relief.”
If you can, practice the Cleansing Breath outside in the fresh morning air.
Follow these steps to practice a Cleansing Breath:
1. Inhale a Complete Breath comfortably through your nostrils to the
count of four to six.
We explain the Complete Breath in the section “The Complete Breath”
earlier in this chapter.
2. Gently purse your lips as you strongly exhale to a count of four.
Exhale vigorously so you make a loud whooshing sound. Feel your
breath rising from the bottom to the top of your lungs in a dynamic and
complete release. Refreshing, isn’t it? You feel as though you’re cleans-
ing your entire system.
Gently contracting your abdominal muscles as you exhale helps push
the air out.
Complete this breath four to six times.
63
Chapter 4: A Breath of Fresh Air: Yoga Breathing Techniques

The Vitality Breath
We saved the most dynamic breath for last. The Vitality Breath is a fantastic
breath with which to start a yoga-with-weights workout. It sends energy to all
parts of your body and makes you feel more alive.
Follow these steps to practice the Vitality Breath:
1. Stand upright with your feet spread wider than your hips and your
toes pointing forward.
Make sure your body weight is well-balanced between both legs.
2. While inhaling a Complete Breath through your nostrils to the count
of four, extend your arms straight out in front of you, palms facing
upward.
This is the starting position.
We explain the Complete Breath in the section “The Complete Breath”
earlier in this chapter. Although you hold your arms in front of you, you
should hold them in a relaxed manner.
3. Exhale slowly through your mouth or through pursed lips as you draw
your hands toward your body along the sides of your rib cage and
gradually contract the muscles of your arms and hands.
By the time your arms and hands reach the sides of your body, contract
your muscles so that your fists are clenched. Put some force into it. At
this point, your fists should be tightly clenched and you should feel a
driving force or sense of inner release as you exhale.
4. Relax your arms and hands as you deeply inhale, slowly unclench
your fists, and return to the starting position (see Step 2).
Imagine that you’re taking in this breath through your hands and heart.
Repeat Steps 2 through 4 six to eight times to complete six to eight Vitality
Breaths.
Keep it going. If you like the way the Vitality Breath feels, do two sets of six to
eight breaths. Listen to the sound you make as you exhale. The Vitality
Breath is a commanding exercise. Don’t be shy about exploring this powerful,
energy-enhancing breath, but if it doesn’t feel right to you, just stay with the
Complete Breath.

Making the Mind and 
Body Connection
In This Chapter
 Quieting and calming your mind
 Concentrating on transitions between exercises and activities
 Listening to your body as you exercise
 Breaking the mind barriers to exercise
 Focusing on the here and now
You may not know it, but when you exercise, you have the potential to
exercise with your mind as well as your body. And in yoga with weights,
the mind plays a bigger part than it does in other exercise disciplines,
because one of the goals of yoga with weights is to be self-aware and to
develop your relationship with your consciousness in everything you do.
This chapter explores training your mind and some of the mental aspects of
yoga with weights. You look into quieting and calming your mind, listening to
your body as you exercise, and breaking the mental barriers that keep you
from wanting to exercise. You also discover a mental visualization technique
for focusing your mind and a special contract-and-release exercise for wring-
ing all the tension from your body.
Taming the Monkey Mind
One of the objects of traditional yoga is to discover how to calm your mind to
achieve clarity of thought. An overactive mind is sometimes called a “monkey
mind.” In traditional yoga, a monkey mind is one that swings wildly from
branch to branch — that is, from thought to thought — without really consid-
ering where it’s going. A monkey mind is always busy, so much so that it
leaves you feeling exhausted and robs you of your precious energy resources
and your ability to concentrate.

Taming a monkey mind isn’t easy. It takes time, practice, and, perhaps most
importantly, a commitment to discovering how to relax your mind and always
remain in the moment. What does “in the moment” mean? It means to be con-
sciously aware of your surroundings and how you feel now — not letting your
mind drift into memories or fantasies. When you tame the monkey mind, you
achieve self-awareness and the ability to think with clarity. You literally pull
yourself together, body and mind. For more tips on taming a monkey mind,
check out “Bringing Your Mind into the Present Moment” later in this chapter.
Focusing on the Transitions
Yoga masters pay a lot of attention to transitions. The entire yoga philosophy
is not about abrupt stops and starts, but smooth transitions of breath into
breath and moment into moment. This philosophy applies to all activities in
life — the transition between sleep and wakefulness, the transition between
work and play, and even the transition from year to year and decade to decade,
for example. In yoga class, it means paying as much attention to getting into
and out of a pose as being in the pose itself.
The object is to make all transitions, from the smallest to the largest, smooth
and graceful so you maintain your self-awareness and your yoga conscious-
ness as a matter of course, no matter what you do or where you go. When
you take on a yoga lifestyle, you strive to make all your activities — all the
moments of your life — one vast, inspired moment imbued with yoga con-
sciousness. This effort gives you a greater sense of personal empowerment
and freedom of choice as you skillfully live your life. With each breath and
each moment leading one to the other, you’re fully alive as you embrace your
life to its fullest without missing out on a single moment of the journey.
Easier said than done, of course, but yoga with weights can help. To start
down the road of greater consciousness, focus on the transition between
yoga-with-weights exercises and how you link one breath to the next. (See
Chapter 4 for breathing details.) Try to create effortless, flowing, graceful
transitions between exercises, with as little excess movement as possible.
That means when the mind wanders, as it will, you gently pull it back and
focus on what you’re doing in the present. When you forget to breathe prop-
erly, you put more mental effort into breathing next time. You observe your
own training, and, in the process, you become your own peak-performance
coach. No one knows better than you do whether you’re getting the most out
of yoga-with-weights exercises.
By focusing on the transitions between exercises, you can carry vitality,
strength, and endurance from one exercise to the next. With enough attention
to transitions, you can turn your yoga-with-weights workout into a living
dance, with all the postures connected through balance, presence, attention,
and breath. And guess what? You’ll even have some fun in the process.
66
Part II: Mastering the Basics

Exercising from the Inside Out
Yoga with weights is different from nearly all forms of exercise in that you do
the exercises “from the inside out.” In basketball and weightlifting, for exam-
ple, the object is to do something outside of your body — make a basket or
press a certain amount of weight. But in yoga with weights, the object of the
exercises is found mostly within, not outside the body. Like all forms of yoga,
yoga with weights is a profound technique for getting in touch with your body.
As you perform an exercise, you feel and listen to the inner workings of your
body. Your body tells you whether you’re doing the exercise correctly, and
part of your job is to discover how to listen. If you’re in tune with yourself — 
if you feel balanced, if you feel the right combination of muscles at work, if
you’re pushing yourself precisely to the threshold of your ability — you’ll
know it.
Exercising from the inside out takes some getting used to for people who
aren’t accustomed to exercising this way. It requires a fair amount of patience;
it requires you to focus within; and, to a certain degree, it requires you to rely
on your intuition and to notice the subtle sensations in your body. Although
instructors can help you with your posture and movements, knowing whether
you’re exercising correctly is ultimately up to you, and you’ll know because
you can feel it. No outside objective — jumping to a certain height, lifting a
certain amount of weight — can tell you whether you’re on target with an
exercise. Only you, your intuition, your innate wisdom, and your intelligence
can tell you when you’re exercising right. Figuring it out may take some time,
and it takes practice, but when you do, it feels great.
Letting Go of “I Can’t Do It”
More so than muscle fatigue, what keeps most people from yoga with weights
is that broken record that each person has in his or her record collection, the
one that says over and over and over again, “You can’t do it.” Exercising is
hard in and of itself; attempting a new exercise program may be even harder.
The only way to push aside “I can’t do it” is to use your head. When the old
record starts playing, take notice and then focus on your breathing. Listen to
the air slowly entering and slowly leaving your lungs. This technique helps
quiet your mind and keeps the record from playing. It helps you immerse
yourself in the exercises. (For more information on breathing during yoga-
with-weights exercises, see Chapter 4.)
Resistance to exercising can come from many different places. Everyone 
can find excuses not to exercise. Everyone can think of things they’d rather
do. We’ve discovered that the easiest way to break through old barriers that
your mind has built up against exercise is to take the first step or the first
67
Chapter 5: Making the Mind and Body Connection

yoga breath. After you get going, you discover that exercising isn’t as hard as
you thought it was. Let each exercise session act as a new beginning and a
fresh start. Take it one breath at a time. Make that your objective. Personal
power — your greatest potential — rests within. When you bring what’s within
out into the world, miracles happen. (See Chapter 19 for motivational tips for
yoga with weights.)
Bringing Your Mind into the 
Present Moment
Bringing your mind into the present moment is easier said than done. All
people have distractions that keep them from focusing on the moment. To
help you get there, we offer you a mental visualization technique and an exer-
cise for relieving tension. Turn to these pages when you want to coax your-
self into living in the present. In a way, we’re asking you to live life to the
fullest by being in the moment.
Visualizing a calmer mind
One way to tame a wild and overly active mind — a monkey mind (see
“Taming the Monkey Mind” earlier in this chapter) — is visualization.
Visualization is when you close your eyes and go on a mental journey as a
means of calming your mind and achieving a quiet, meditative state of self-
awareness. In effect, you become the producer of your own visual effects — a
sort of director of your own mental movies. The idea is to reach a state of
deep relaxation and focus.
The object of the following visualization is to discover a refuge of calm and
quiet within yourself. You need at least 10 minutes for this visualization.
Lights, camera, action:
1. Lie down or sit comfortably in a quiet place.
Do your best to find a place where you aren’t bothered by cell phones
and other distractions.
2. Notice the tip of your nose and the coolness or warmth of each breath
as the stream of air flows in and out of your nostrils.
3. Keeping your attention on the tip of your nose, feel the sensations of
your lungs as they fill with air and then empty themselves of air.
Focus on your lungs for at least six breaths.
4. Imagine that the innermost center of your body, from your hips up to
your shoulders, is a deep pond.
68
Part II: Mastering the Basics

5. View this deep pond in your mind and direct your attention to the sur-
face of the pond.
6. Notice the currents or waves on the surface of the pond and look
toward the sky, above the pond in your mind, and observe any clouds.
The clouds represent your emotions, and the surface of the pond repre-
sents your thoughts. In the next several steps in the visualization, you
sink deeper into the image of the pond and distance yourself from your
flow of emotions and the activity of your thoughts.
7. Visualize dropping a pebble into the pond.
In your mind, follow that pebble with all your awareness as it sinks
deeper into the pond. Breathe in and out calmly and quietly, remaining
aware of the tip of your nose if doing so helps you breathe more calmly
and deeply.
8. As the pebble continues to sink (which represents deeper levels of
your awareness), feel a sense of your own depth, the calmness within
you, and the stilling and quieting of your mind as the pebble falls into
deeper waters of inner knowing.
9. Imagine the pebble coming to rest on the bottom of the pond.
You’re at a point of restfulness in the depths; dwell here for as long as
you want.
10. In the role of an observer, step back from this visualization and notice
that you’ve taken your mind and thoughts into deeper waters.
High above, the clouds (your emotions) are still alive and well, and the
surface of the pond (your thoughts) is still ripe with currents and activ-
ity. Down in the depths, however, you are still and quiet. You’ve discov-
ered the deeper well of a steady mind and calm deep within you. This
state is known as equanimity, when the mind is calm and aware.
Dwell comfortably and securely in this place of calm for as long as you
care to remain. Remember: This place of calmness is always there wait-
ing in case you need to visit it.
Releasing tension with a contract-and-
release exercise
The object of this contract-and-release exercise is to release tension in your
body and bring your mind into the present moment. You isolate different
areas of your body one at a time, starting with your toes and working your
way up to your head. In each body area, you contract your muscles hard and
then gently relax them. The idea is to tense each muscle group hard, without
straining, for about five to ten seconds, and then suddenly let go of the ten-
sion or contraction. When you release your muscles, you do so fully and
69
Chapter 5: Making the Mind and Body Connection

abruptly, relaxing and letting your body fall completely limp. In this way, you
achieve a state of deeper relaxation, and you systematically relieve tension
from different areas of your body.
Visualize each muscle group you’re working on in your mind’s eye before you
contract and relax the muscle group. By directing your thoughts into a part
of your body, you can discover the nerve pathways necessary for relaxation.
You discover how to relax by directing your mental energy toward your body.
Repeat the contract-and-release sequence three times with each part of your
body you’re working on. Hold the first contraction for five counts, the second
for about seven, and the third for about ten. As you do so, inhale through
your nose during contractions and exhale through pursed lips after you 
relax your muscles. Inhale deeply, yet not so deeply that you feel discomfort
in your chest or lungs.
This exercise takes a bit of time — perhaps 10 to 20 minutes — but it’s well
worth the effort. Follow these steps to do the contract-and-release exercise:
1. Lie down on your back in a quiet, comfortable place, and take a few
deep, slow, Abdominal Breaths (Chapter 4 explains what these
breaths are).
As you exhale, notice the weight of your body and how that weight is
distributed on the carpet or on your yoga mat.
In the next seven steps, starting with your toes and working upward,
contract and relax muscle groups for five seconds.
2. Direct your attention to your right and left legs and, in a wavelike
action that moves from your feet upward, tighten your feet by curling
your toes downward, and then relax.
If your muscles cramp, relax and gently shake off the cramp or wait until
it stops, and then start again. Sometimes the muscles act up because
you haven’t used them in such a deep way for a while.
3. Move the contractions up higher, tightening your calf muscles while
flexing your toes toward you or turning your toes under (do
whichever feels best).
4. Move the contraction higher again, engaging the muscles of your
thighs all the way up to your hips.
You may tighten your buttocks along with your thighs, because the thigh
muscles attach to that area. Feel your thigh muscles smoothing out and
relaxing completely as you exhale.
5. Tighten and relax your buttocks, hips, and abdominal areas.
70
Part II: Mastering the Basics

6. Contract and release your back and chest.
As you relax, imagine a wave of release moving smoothly downward
from your chest. Feel the excess tension in your chest flowing away with
each exhalation.
7. Clench your fists and feel the contraction moving up your arms; relax
your arms and hands.
If you have to lift your arms from the floor, you can do so. Notice the
muscles around your shoulder blades pushing in.
8. Tense and relax the muscles in your neck, forehead, face, and scalp,
as well as the muscles around your ears.
Be careful not to grind your teeth. Feel the frown lines on your face melt-
ing away.
9. Repeat Steps 2 through 8, holding each muscle contraction for seven
counts before releasing.
10. Repeat Steps 2 through 8 again, holding each muscle contraction for
ten counts before releasing.
11. Take a deep, full breath and mentally scan your body for any tension
that still remains; notice where you’re still holding tight, and contract
and relax the muscles there.
Feel your body resting deeply.
12. Inhale and, as you gently hold your breath, contract your muscles
everywhere — bottom to top, front to back, inside to outside, outside
to inside, forward and back, up and down.
Feel a wave of contraction moving from your held breath into every area
of your body.
13. Exhaling quickly through your mouth, release all the muscles you’ve
been contracting.
You’ll hear a swooshing or deep-releasing ahh sound that rises from
your belly as you exhale.
14. Repeat Steps 12 and 13 three times.
Finish by resting gently. Let your breathing become natural again. Enjoy
the sensations of your body resting on the floor.
Playing a bit of soothing music in the background helps some people with this
exercise. And this exercise is a great way to finish off a yoga-with-weights workout!

Warming Up and Cooling Down
In This Chapter
 Looking at the benefits of warming up
 Walking as a prelude to working out
 Doing the yoga-with-weights warm-up exercises
 Discovering how to meditate
 Using meditation to cool down after your workout
T
his chapter focuses on warming up to get ready for a yoga-with-weights
workout and cooling down when your workout is over. We show you the
benefits of warming up, and you discover why simple activities such as walk-
ing can be such great warm-up techniques. And when you finish warming up
and complete your yoga-with-weights workout, we show you how to pull all
the elements of your exercise practice into a final meditation that will leave
you feeling refreshed.
Don’t let the word “meditation” intimidate you; it isn’t as complicated as
most people think. Meditation is the finishing touch, the icing on your work-
out cake — the part of the workout that serves as a peaceful and calming
transition to the rest of your day.
Reaping the Benefits of Warming Up
Most people like to jump into the workout pool without getting their feet wet
first. They want to start exercising without warming up. They want to get
right to it, get the ball rolling, finish, and not look back. What they don’t real-
ize is that warming up has some real advantages, both physical and mental.
You’ve heard it before: Warming up is recommended no matter what kind of
exercise you intend to do. In yoga with weights, warming up is especially
important, because yoga with weights works your muscles and joints more
than other exercise programs.

Here are some of the advantages of warming up:
 Warming up helps prevent injuries. Preparing your muscles, tendons,
and ligaments makes them more flexible and less susceptible to injury.
You ready them to perform the dynamic yoga-with-weights exercises
that follow.
 Warming up coaxes your body into flexibility. It makes your body more
supple and mobile. Your joints and muscles are better able to move
through their full ranges of motion.
 Warming up promotes a natural release of synovial fluid into the
joints. As we explain in the “What’s that crackling sound?” sidebar, syn-
ovial fluid acts as a lubricant to cushion your joints and help make your
limbs more flexible.
 Warming up, like the exercises themselves, helps stimulate the flow 
of blood — and of oxygen — to your muscles. This makes your body
warmer and your muscles more pliable. In other words, you get a better
workout.
 Warming up slows you down and brings you into the moment. You
start to focus on moving your body, which prepares you for the full
workout to come. In other words, being present mentally as you start
gives you confidence to rock-and-roll right into the exercises.
Stretching is a process-oriented activity. It isn’t about how far or how hard you
stretch. Stretching is really about the journey and finding out how to coax your
muscles into better and deeper stretches. You have to realize that to stretch a
muscle, it must be relaxed.
74
Part II: Mastering the Basics
What’s that crackling sound?
When you stretch, you may hear a cracking
sound in your joints and muscles. To see what
we mean, try rolling your head from your chest
to your shoulder to your back to your other
shoulder and to your chest again. Do you hear a
crackling noise?
What you’re hearing is the sound of synovial
fluid — the fluid found in joints and tendon
sheaths — breaking up. The fluid acts as a kind
of lubricant to enable your limbs to move in their
sockets. When your joints are stiff, the synovial
fluid gets stuck, but moving your joints and limbs
breaks up the deposits. Over time, if you stick
with yoga with weights, the excessive crackling
noise starts to diminish along with the synovial
fluid deposits, keeping things fluid and free in
movement.

Walking to Warm Up
Walking is the most natural of all exercises. It can also be one of the most — if
not the most — enjoyable exercises. Walking doesn’t require any particular
expertise, either; it gives everyone the chance to be physically active.
If you have the time, make walking a prelude to every yoga-with-weights
workout. You don’t have to hike to the top of Mt. Everest — a short walk of 10
to 20 minutes will do. Getting in a walk daily or every other day has all kinds
of benefits for your body and your mind. And if you combine walking with the
other short warm-up exercises we describe in this chapter, you’ll be well pre-
pared for your yoga-with-weights workout. The combination of walking and
yoga with weights as a daily and/or weekly workout program enhances the
quality of your general health and mental well-being. It also helps keep your
weight in check.
In the following pages, we explain the benefits of including a walk in your daily
warm-up routine. We also explain how to walk properly to take stock of the
world around you and the world inside you and how to prepare your body 
for a workout.
We recommend walking outside in nature, weather permitting. If you can’t
walk outside, a treadmill in your home or gym works well. Put all your walk-
ing clothes by the door so you’re ready to get up and go before your workout.
Because footwear is important, buy walking shoes that fit well (see Chapter 2
for some advice about buying walking shoes).
Fluids are essential if you want to take longer walks. Be sure to bring along
water if you plan to walk for any length of time. (Chapter 2 looks into the par-
ticulars of staying hydrated as you exercise.)
Improving your mindfulness
If you decide to walk outside, you get a chance to look around and enjoy
nature, of course, and you enjoy the benefits of performing a physical activ-
ity. Walking increases the oxygen to your brain and muscles, reduces stress,
and slows bone mineral loss. The stimulus of seeing the world outside the
confines of your house or office — and seeing the world move while you 
walk — calms your mind and body.
As you walk, be mindful of your breathing. Make your short walk a moving
meditation by synchronizing your breathing with your steps. As you put one
foot in front of the other, focus on the count of each breath. Take four counts
to breathe in and four to breathe out. Being mindful of your breathing as you
walk is good practice for being mindful of your breathing in your yoga-with-
weights exercises and in everything you do. It also sharpens your awareness
of breathing and increases your powers of concentration.
75
Chapter 6: Warming Up and Cooling Down

Breathe through your nostrils, or take Complete Breaths (Chapter 4 explains
what those are). You can also try saying the following sentence silently with
each breath to get into the four-count rhythm: “Breathing in I calm body and
mind; breathing out I cleanse and clear.”
Preparing for a workout
For the first five minutes of your walk, stroll in an easy manner with your
head held in whatever position feels most comfortable. Find your natural
stride, feel your feet connecting with the ground, and gaze straight ahead.
Gradually start to pick up speed, but never walk so fast that you’re uncom-
fortable or have to strain to catch your breath. If you’re walking with a com-
panion, you should be able to carry on a conversation without having to stop
to catch your breath.
As you walk, swing your arms gently alongside your body in a natural arc.
Notice the movement of your arms, and develop an opposite-arm, opposite-
leg movement — in other words, a coordinated stride. Walk with purpose and
direction. Feel your chest lift up and open, and feel the energy flowing through
your body.
As you walk, you can burn more calories by increasing your pace or walking
up and down hills. Just be careful not to overextend yourself. If you don’t
push too hard, you’re more likely to exercise regularly.
Adding a Handful of Warm-Up 
Exercises to Your Walk
Along with walking to warm up (the subject of the previous section), you can
do warm-up exercises. We describe these exercises in the pages that follow.
These warm-ups will keep your juices flowing after your walk and lead you
comfortably into your yoga-with-weights workout. None of these exercises is
difficult. None takes more than a minute to complete. Feel free to do as few or
as many of these warm-up exercises as you want before your workout.
Choose exercises that warm up the parts of your body that feel tight or stiff.
You can also choose exercises that make you feel better or relax you and pre-
pare you physically and mentally for the workout to come.
A skeptic may say that the warm-up exercises we present here are too easy
and can’t be of much help. Here are a few reasons why we firmly disagree:
76
Part II: Mastering the Basics

 After you complete a few of these warm-up exercises, you’ll notice that
warming up makes a yoga-with-weights workout more productive.
 If you’re not up to doing the actual yoga-with-weights exercises yet
because you’re too stiff, you can prepare your body by doing these
warm-up exercises as a workout. They give beginners a fairly good work-
out until they feel comfortable enough to start with the exercises.
 If you feel sore the day after a yoga-with-weights workout, you can use
these warm-up exercises to relieve discomfort. These warm-ups are
almost as good as a bath, a nice cup of tea, and a massage! (Well, maybe
that’s a stretch.)
Many of these warm-up exercises involve what yoga teachers call static hold-
ing. Static holding means you hold a position for three or more breaths. Simply
stated, you push or contract a muscle against resistance and then hold that
contraction for a few breaths. This technique requires a certain amount of
concentration, because you have to hold the pose and focus on your breath-
ing throughout. Static holding gives you an opportunity to stretch out your
muscles and develop your ability to balance. It also gives your muscles a
chance to discover new ways of moving and holding, as each exercise does its
unique work for you. As you engage in static holding, listen carefully to your
body, and feel your way to an understanding of which muscles you should
contract and utilize fully and which muscles you should gently relax.
Chin-Chest Tuck
The purpose of the Chin-Chest Tuck is to loosen up the back of your neck and
upper spine area.
Grab your hand weights and follow these steps:
1. Stand looking straight ahead with your feet below your hips and your
arms dangling at your sides, holding the weights with your palms
facing inward.
This is the starting position. Make sure your feet are parallel to one
another.
2. Exhaling slowly, tuck your chin into your chest (see Figure 6-1); take
two or three slow breaths while you’re in this position.
If you can, touch your chin to your chest. Feel the back of your neck and
upper spine stretching.
3. Inhaling slowly, return to the starting position (see Step 1).
Repeat this exercise three to six times, pausing to rest between each 
repetition.
77
Chapter 6: Warming Up and Cooling Down

Head Turner
The Head Turner, as you may expect, increases the mobility of your neck,
which is important for many of the yoga-with-weights exercises that require
you to look in different directions.
You may want to try the Head Turner after you’ve been sitting at your desk
for a long time to give your neck a little exercise.
Hold the hand weights as you do the Head Turner. When you’re ready, follow
these steps:
1. Stand looking straight ahead with your feet below your hips and your
arms dangling at your sides, holding the weights with your palms
facing inward.
This is the starting position. Make sure your feet are parallel.
2. Exhaling slowly and being careful not to drop your chin, turn your
head and look over your right shoulder (see Figure 6-2); hold this pose
for two or three slow breaths.
Feel the muscles of your neck contracting and stretching. 
3. Inhaling slowly, return to the starting position (see Step 1).

Part II: Mastering the Basics

Alternating shoulders after each repetition, repeat this exercise three to six
times for each shoulder.
Lateral Neck Release
The Lateral Neck Release is meant to loosen up your neck (as are the previ-
ous two warm-up exercises). We provide many neck-and-shoulder exercises
because these areas are the primary places where most people carry stress.
Where do you think the expression “a pain in the neck” came from?
Grab your hand weights and follow these steps:
1. Stand looking straight ahead with your feet below your hips and your
arms dangling at your sides, holding the weights with your palms
facing inward.
This is the starting position. Make sure your feet are parallel.
2. Exhaling slowly, lower your right ear toward your right shoulder 
(see Figure 6-3); hold this pose for two or three slow breaths.
Concentrate on the left side of your neck stretching and your left ear lift-
ing up. Don’t allow your chin to droop toward your chest. Also, concen-
trate on your breath opening and relaxing your neck and shoulders. 
Figure 6-2:
Turning your
head and
neck is a

79
Chapter 6: Warming Up and Cooling Down

Don’t stay in this position for more than three breaths; it’s easy to over-
stretch your neck in this position.
3. Inhaling slowly, return your head to the starting position (see Step 1).
Alternating sides after each repetition, repeat this exercise three to six times
with each side of your neck.
Backward Shoulder Roll
The Backward Shoulder Roll loosens and relaxes the back of your shoulders
and the upper back region. Time to shoulder the burden.
Pick up your hand weights and follow these steps:
1. Stand looking straight ahead with your feet below your hips and your
arms dangling at your sides, holding the weights with your palms
facing inward; inhale to a count of four.
This is the starting position. Make sure your feet are parallel.
2. Exhaling slowly, roll your shoulders up, back, and then down (see
Figure 6-4).

Part II: Mastering the Basics

Allow the hand weights to draw your shoulders down when you lower
your shoulders; the weights allow for a deeper stretch.
3. Continue the rolling motion — moving your shoulders up, back, and
then down — until they’re loose as a goose.
Don’t roll your shoulders forward; in other words, don’t slouch.
Repeat this exercise three to six times.
Forward Shoulder Roll
The Forward Shoulder Roll, like the Backward Shoulder Roll (see the previ-
ous exercise), loosens up and helps to relax the muscles of the front of your
shoulders, your upper chest, and your back. The Forward Shoulder Roll and
the Backward Shoulder Roll go hand in hand, creating a balanced workout for
this area of your body.
Engage your abdominal muscles throughout this exercise to support your
back.

Chapter 6: Warming Up and Cooling Down

You need hand weights for this exercise. When you’re ready, follow these
steps:
1. Stand looking straight ahead with your feet below your hips and your
arms dangling at your sides, holding the weights with your palms
facing inward; inhale to a count of four.
This is the starting position. Make sure your feet are parallel.
2. Exhaling slowly, roll your shoulders up, forward, and then down 
(see Figure 6-5).
As you roll your shoulders forward and down, allow the weights to pull
your shoulders in the proper direction. Concentrate on your shoulder
blades widening.
3. Continue this motion — going up, forward, and then down — until
your shoulders feel loose.
Repeat this exercise three to six times.

Side Bender
The Side Bender concentrates on loosening the trunk of your body — from
your hips to your shoulders.
Pick up your hand weights for this exercise. When you’re ready, follow these
steps:
1. Stand looking straight ahead with your feet below your hips and your
arms dangling at your sides, holding the weights with your palms
facing inward.
This is the starting position. Make sure your feet are parallel.
2. Exhaling slowly, turn your head to the right as you lean gently to your
right (see Figure 6-6); take two or three slow breaths in this position.
Allow the weight to stretch the left side of your body. You should feel
your waistline stretching. Be careful not to lean forward or backward —
lean straight to your side. Pretend you’re between two walls, one in front
of you and one behind.
3. Inhaling slowly, lift your body back to the starting position (see Step 1),
turning your head as you lift.
Figure 6-6:
Bend to 
the side to

83
Chapter 6: Warming Up and Cooling Down

Alternating sides after each repetition, repeat this exercise two to four times
with each side of your body.
Body Twister
The Body Twister is the easiest of the warm-up exercises we provide (which
is saying something, because they’re all easy!). You can even try this one with
a hoola-hoop if you’re so inclined. The object of the exercise is to loosen your
hips and improve the flexibility of your trunk as a whole.
You need hand weights for this exercise. When you’re ready, follow these
steps:
1. Stand looking straight ahead with your feet below your hips and the
weights held at hip level, palms facing inward.
This is the starting position. Make sure your feet are parallel.
2. Pressing down on your left foot, twist your trunk, neck, head, and
shoulders to the right (see Figure 6-7). Hold this pose for two or three
relaxed breaths.
3. Return your upper half to the starting position (see Step 1) and take
the pressure off your left foot.
Figure 6-7:

84
Part II: Mastering the Basics

Alternating from side to side, repeat this exercise six to eight times on each
side of your body.
Wrist Rotator
The Wrist Rotator loosens and relaxes your wrists, a must for the times when
you have to maneuver hand weights or support your body with your hands.
You need hand weights for this exercise. If you have carpal tunnel syndrome
or another wrist condition, however, use light hand weights to prevent injury
or no hand weights at all.
When you have your hand weights ready, follow these steps:
1. Stand looking straight ahead with your feet below your hips and your
arms dangling at your sides, holding the weights with your palms
facing backward.
This is the starting position. Make sure your feet are parallel.
2. Breathing slowly and steadily, rotate your wrists in a counter-
clockwise fashion until the backs of your hands are facing each 
other (see Figure 6-8).
Enjoy feeling the muscles of your wrists loosen.
Figure 6-8:

Chapter 6: Warming Up and Cooling Down

3. Continuing to breathe slowly and steadily, rotate your wrists in the
clockwise direction until your palms are facing forward.
Repeat this exercise three to six times in each direction.
Big Shoulder Release
The Big Shoulder Release is designed to eliminate the tension in your shoul-
ders, shoulder joints, and upper back.
Grab your hand weights for this exercise and follow these steps:
1. Stand looking straight ahead with your shoulders squared, your feet
directly below your hips, and your arms hanging to your sides, hold-
ing the weights with your palms facing backward.
This is the starting position. Press down onto all four corners of your
feet, and draw your belly in and up to support your back. Make sure
your feet are parallel.
2. Inhaling to a count of four, raise your arms forward and up, following
the weights with your eyes as you lift (see Figure 6-9).

Part II: Mastering the Basics

Lift, don’t throw, your arms so they’re straight over your shoulders, and
hold them there for a moment.
Don’t jerk your arms, overextend the weights, or slouch. Performing
these actions with weights in your hands can cause muscle or joint
injury.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, lower your arms and head to the starting
position (see Step 1).
Repeat this exercise three or four times.
Y Shoulder Release
The Y Shoulder Release is designed to strengthen and improve the flexibility
of your shoulders and upper back.
You need hand weights for this exercise. When you’re ready, follow these
steps:
1. With your shoulders squared and feet below your hips, stand looking
straight ahead with your arms hanging to your sides, holding the
weights with your palms facing inward.
This is the starting position. Press onto all four corners of your feet, and
draw your belly in and up to support your back.
2. Inhaling to a count of four, raise your arms away from your sides until
they form a Y with your body, looking toward the ceiling as you lift
(see Figure 6-10).
Be careful not to jerk your arms, which can cause muscle or joint injury.
If you can’t lift your arms above your shoulders, lift them as high as you
comfortably can.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, lower your arms and gaze to the starting
position (see Step 1).
Repeat this exercise three or four times.
87
Chapter 6: Warming Up and Cooling Down

Quad Stretcher
The Quad Stretcher warms up your quads (or quadriceps), the large muscles
on the front of your legs above your knees, by stretching them and strength-
ening them with the help of ankle weights.
You need ankle weights and a chair for balance in this exercise. When you’re
ready, follow these steps:
1. Stand behind the back of the chair with your feet directly below your
hips and your arms at your sides.
This is the starting position.
2. Bend your right knee, reach back with your right hand to hold 
your foot, and hold the chair with your left hand for balance (see
Figure 6-11); hold this position for three or four deep, full breaths.
Make sure your shoulders are over your hips and your knees are close
to one another. Feel your quad muscle stretching. 
If you can’t reach your foot, grab a pant leg. You can also put a towel
around your ankle and hold the towel.
3. Return to the starting position (see Step 1).

Part II: Mastering the Basics

Alternating legs after each repetition, repeat this exercise four to six times
with each leg.
Back and Hamstring Stretcher
The Back and Hamstring Stretcher works your hamstrings and, in the
process, stretches and strengthens your back. Your hamstring is the long
muscle on the back of your leg that runs from your knee to your buttock. To
stretch two areas with one stone, read on!
You need a chair and your ankle weights for this exercise. When you’re ready,
follow these steps:
1. Stand behind the back of a chair with your feet directly below your
hips and your arms at your sides.
2. Grab the back of the chair with both hands and step backward by one
arm’s length, making sure your arms and the trunk of your body are
parallel with the floor.
This is the starting position. Fix your gaze on the floor.

Chapter 6: Warming Up and Cooling Down

3. Step forward with your right leg, and flex your right foot.
Draw your belly in and up and your tailbone down for support.
4. Lean back onto both of your heels (see Figure 6-12); hold this position
for three or four slow breaths.
Concentrate on your hamstrings and back stretching. 
5. Return to the starting position (see Step 2).
Alternating legs after each repetition, repeat this exercise four to six times
with each leg.
All-Out Hamstring Stretcher
Your hamstring is a long muscle located on the backside of your leg. It
extends from your buttock to the back of your knee. The All-Out Hamstring
Stretcher stretches your hamstrings — an important task because these mus-
cles help you move comfortably in many of the exercises where you need to
step, stand, or bend over.
Grab a chair and strap on your ankle weights. When you’re ready, follow
these steps:
1. Face the front of the chair with your feet below your hips and your
hands on your thighs.
This is the starting position.
Figure 6-12:
You can

Part II: Mastering the Basics

2. Put your right heel on the chair’s seat.
Keep your foot flexed and your toes pointing toward the ceiling. Pull
your belly in and up and draw your tailbone down to anchor your legs.
3. Bend forward as far as you can to stretch your hamstring, keeping
both legs as straight as possible (see Figure 6-13); hold this pose for
three or four slow breaths.
If you can, put both of your hands on the chair (see Figure 6-13). You
should also feel your back stretching. 
4. Return to the starting position (see Step 1) by slowly raising your
body and taking your right heel off the chair.
Alternating legs after each repetition, repeat this exercise four to six times
with each leg.
The Big Stretcher
The Big Stretcher warms up your shoulders, back, and spine. The pose may
seem difficult at first if you aren’t limber, but the discomfort is worth it
because the exercise stretches many different muscles that help you in yoga-
with-weights workouts.
Figure 6-13:

Chapter 6: Warming Up and Cooling Down

Strap on your ankle weights and follow these steps:
1. Stand with your shoulders squared, your feet below your hips, and
your arms hanging to your sides.
2. Interlace your fingers behind your back, with your palms facing each
other.
This is the starting position. You may have to raise your shoulders — in
other words, shrug them — to do this.
If you can’t interlace your fingers, grab a hand towel behind your back with
both hands.
3. As you slowly exhale, bend your knees and move the trunk of your
body forward as far as you can (see Figure 6-14); hold this pose for
three or four breaths.
If you can go forward until you’re looking at your feet like the model in
Figure 6-14, great. If not, don’t worry — go as far as you can. Your arms
should remain together and be pointing toward the ceiling. Press onto
all four corners of each foot.
4. Slowly inhale as you return to the starting position (see Step 2).
Repeat this exercise six to eight times.

Marching Legs
In the Marching Legs warm-up exercise, you get to pretend that you’re in a
marching band. This exercise warms up your hips and gluts (the muscles on
your buttocks).
If you want to go for a jog or do some other aerobic activity in place of yoga
with weights, Marching Legs is an excellent warm-up for running activities.
You need both ankle weights and hand weights for this exercise. When you’re
ready, follow these steps:
1. Stand looking straight ahead with your feet below your hips and your
arms hanging to your sides, holding the hand weights with your palms
facing inward.
This is the starting position. Make sure your feet are parallel and that
your shoulders are squared.
2. As you slowly inhale to a count of four, lift your right knee (see 
Figure 6-15).
Pull your belly in for support, and keep your shoulders squared.
3. As you slowly exhale to a count of four, lower your right leg to the
starting position (see Step 1).

Chapter 6: Warming Up and Cooling Down

Alternating legs after each repetition, repeat this exercise six to eight times
with each leg.
Hip Opener
The Hip Opener is an excellent stretch for your buttocks and hamstrings. It
provides freedom and a greater range of motion in those areas, which in turn
supports the well-being and healthy movement of your hips.
Keep your belly muscles engaged at all times during this exercise.
You need ankle weights for this exercise. When you’re ready, follow these steps:
1. Lay on the floor with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor.
2. Place your right ankle on the top of your left knee (see Figure 6-16a).
This is the starting position.
3. Draw your left knee toward your chest (see Figure 6-16b); hold this
pose for two or three long, slow breaths.
Hold the underside of your left thigh with both hands to help bring your
thigh closer to your chest. Pull your belly in for support.
4. Slowly lower your left foot back to the floor and put your right leg
back in the starting position (see Figure 6-16a).

Lower Back Release
The object of the Lower Back Release is to gently stretch your lower back,
hips, and pelvis and to relieve tension in these areas.
For a better stretch, keep your buttocks on the floor throughout this exercise.
You need ankle weights for this exercise. When you’re ready, follow these
steps:
1. Lay on your back with your knees bent and your heels a few inches
away from your buttocks (see Figure 6-17a).
This is the starting position.
2. Slowly inhaling to a count of four, lift the lumbar curve of your back
toward the ceiling (see Figure 6-17b).
The lumbar curve of your back is the part of your back between your
waist and the base of your spine. Let your back rise to the rhythm of
your breathing. Pull your belly in and up for support, and tilt your tail-
bone and pubic bone toward your navel.

Knowing the Benefits of Meditation
When many people hear the word “meditate,” they think of a man in a loin-
cloth with a serene look on his face sitting cross-legged on top of a mountain.
Meditation, however, isn’t nearly as esoteric as people think. It doesn’t require
years of study or mystical knowledge from on high; all it takes is practice.
Meditation is a spontaneous flow of consciousness when all the conditions
are just right. It’s about listening inwardly with a quiet mind for the wisdom
and guidance of a more expansive and unlimited mind.
All the arts of relaxation — breath control, contemplation, prayer, affirma-
tion, repetition of a mantra, and visualization — are different, but they all
direct you toward self-realization and a deep meditative state. Different sys-
tems of thought and traditions vary in their meditation techniques, but they
all have the same goal: to reach the point of stillness, quiet, and communion
with the essence of your being.
With meditation, you discover how to quiet your mind and increase your
level of energy and enjoyment of life. You experience the natural joy of being
in meditation, and you establish a greater confidence and a higher under-
standing. Meditation can deliver deep inner peace; increase your mental sta-
mina; improve your memory; enlarge your multitasking abilities; and teach
you to organize your internal awareness and concentration.
You can practice different forms of meditation:
 Mantra meditation: You focus your attention on a repeated word,
thought, or sound.
 Metta or loving kindness meditation: You practice acts of generosity or
loving kindness toward others.
 Stair-step meditation (or modified progressive relaxation): You focus
on different areas of your body with the aim of relaxing those areas one
at a time.
 Mindfulness: You observe whatever goes through your mind without
judging or analyzing it. (Some yoga practitioners don’t consider this a
true form of meditation, but rather a practice or deeper step toward
meditation.)

Cooling Down: Ending Your 
Workout with Meditation
In each of the workout chapters in this book, we ask you to meditate when-
ever you complete a yoga-with-weights workout. Meditation is an excellent
way to cool down after you exercise. It rests your body and mind, and it
serves as a soothing and supportive transition between your workout and
the next activity you want to engage in. This section introduces some useful

Looking at some meditation techniques
We advise you to meditate after each yoga-with-weights workout in all our
workout chapters, but we also encourage you to meditate whenever the mood
strikes you. The more you practice meditating, the easier it is to sit still with-
out getting distracted or letting your mind wander. Be patient with yourself as
you practice. Practice and more practice will help.

Chapter 6: Warming Up and Cooling Down
Meditation as a garden
Here’s one useful way to consider meditation:
Imagine your mind as a garden. In a garden, you
want only the plants that you plant yourself —
vegetables, flowers, and fruit trees — to grow,
but at every opportunity, weeds spring up to
choke off your plants. Those weeds are like the
chatter that goes on in most people’s heads
most of the time. Consider all the urgent
thoughts, distractions, and mind-chatter that go
through your head in a single day. The average
person thinks 60,000 thoughts each day, and as
much as 80 percent of these thoughts are repet-
itive. You thought them yesterday, and unless
you begin to change your thought habits, you’ll
think them again tomorrow and the day after
that. Unless you train your mind, this chatter will
go on year after year.
Meditation practice is how you train your mind.
It can quiet or silence some of your thoughts in
order to keep the weeds from growing out of
control. Meditation is a way to nurture the
plants in the garden that you want to grow by
bringing you into the present and letting you
focus on your inner domain. As a gardener cul-
tivates a garden, meditation cultivates the
essential things inside you that really matter.
The goal of meditation is to be in the moment as
it unfolds and connect to the state, or fruit, of
your being.

How long you meditate is up to you. You can use an alarm to make a sound
after a certain amount of time elapses, or you can purchase gentle chiming
timers designed for meditation practice that chime softly so as not to startle
you (Brookstone, Whole Foods, Sharper Image, and other stores sell them).
Start by meditating for a few minutes and build up to 20, 45, or even 60 min-
utes over time. Try to meditate three times a week at minimum, and meditate
daily if you can. At first, your mind will wander, but eventually you’ll be able
to maintain your focus as you move into deeper states of meditation. Be
patient, and meditate without any expectations.
Following are some meditation techniques you can use on your own time or
after yoga-with-weights workouts.
Sit in silence
Sit comfortably in a cross-legged position on the floor (and preferably on
your yoga mat).
If sitting on the floor isn’t easy for you, put a small, firm cushion or folded
blanket under your buttocks, or sit on the edge of a wooden chair with your
feet on the floor (don’t sit on an upholstered chair, because they tend to
induce drowsiness). You can also lie down or sit against a wall.
Rest your hands on your knees with your palms up or down. Sit with your
spine straight, and remain silent, concentrating on the world around you.
This will heighten your awareness and allow you to focus on your breathing.
Focus on your breath
You can use your breath as a tool to calm your active mind and direct your
consciousness into new and deeper levels of awareness and insight.
Let your breath flow smoothly, evenly, and consistently, with the air moving
in and out of your lungs like waves on a seashore. Breathe soundlessly or
near soundlessly through your nostrils. Notice your lungs expanding as you
inhale, and relaxing as you exhale. Breathe from your navel to your heart and
into your chest, upper back, and shoulders. Without forcing, let the breath
penetrate into the deepest recesses of your lungs.
Relax systematically
Go into a deep meditation by taking inventory of the different parts of your
body. As you breathe in and out, concentrate on relaxing, beginning with
your forehead and scalp and then moving to your eyes, cheeks, ears, the cor-
ners of your mouth, your tongue, your teeth, and the hinges of your jaw. Feel
your breath moving throughout your body, and let the tensions dissolve.
98
Part II: Mastering the Basics

Relax in your throat, neck, and shoulders. Take a soft and gentle breath into
your right nostril and relax the right side of your body. Now do the same with
your left nostril and the left side of your body. You can then breathe through
both nostrils and invite the breath to move down into your pelvis and hips to
relax them. Imagine that you’re breathing into your left leg, and then do the
same with your right leg. Imagine that the air you’re breathing is flowing
straight into each leg. As you breathe out, relax fully.
Scan your body to deepen stillness and release tension
For three to ten breaths, scan your entire body as you breathe. Feel your
body breathing all at once from the inside out. Without forcing, breathe in so
completely, yet gently, that you feel your breath moving into the outermost
edges of your body and even to areas beyond where your eyes can see. If you
still feel any sensations of constriction in your body, contract and squeeze
the muscles in the constricted areas of your body. For example, if your hip or
thigh feels constricted, contract the muscles that surround those areas,
squeezing and releasing the muscles. This helps to increase blood circulation
to the areas that feel constricted.
Use word repetition
Repeating words gives your mind the power to stay focused on the task at
hand. It moves you deeper into a meditative state.
Choose a positive-affirmation word that works for you — you may want to
choose peace, harmony, or well-being, for example. Silently, hearing only the
inner voice of your mind, repeat the word internally again and again as you
breathe in and out. Feel your brain embracing the positive influence, vibra-
tion, and nature of the word.
Meditate with the use of sound
Sit still and listen to the sounds around you without thinking about where 
the sounds originated or what the sounds mean. Just hear them. Ideally, you
should be outside and listening to the sounds of nature — the wind, birds, the
rustle of leaves. Obviously, no cell phones or other electronic distractions are
allowed in this type of meditation. We don’t recommend listening to music
during meditation because, well, that’s listening to music, not meditating.
Moving into silence
Become your own observer. Notice your thoughts, step back from them, and
watch them with your mind as they appear and pass by. Meanwhile, feel the
breath moving throughout your body and let any tensions dissolve breath 
by breath, moment into moment, into nothingness. Let this meditation be a
simple yet profound path toward your discovery of what’s real and meaning-
ful in your life.

Chapter 6: Warming Up and Cooling Down

Ending your meditation
To end your meditation session, follow these steps:
1. In a sitting position, open your eyes gently.
2. Take a deep breath and close your eyes again.
3. Open your eyes and feel the peaceful sense of calm and awareness.
4. Place your hands on the top of your chest, in the upper chest and 
collarbone area.
5. Inhale through your nose and, with your lips slightly pursed, breathe
out through your mouth, making a gentle whooshing sound.
6. Take three more deep-cleansing breaths with your eyes open.
Feel the sensations of your physical body as you sit there.
7. Take your time before rising to pause for a moment and take stock of
how refreshed, confident, and sure you feel.

From Head to Toe: The 
Balanced Workout
In This Chapter
 Loosening your entire body
 Releasing tension from muscles, head to toe
 Breathing consciously and mindfully as you strengthen your core
 Relaxing your body for the rest of your day
W
e designed the Balanced Workout in this chapter to exercise and tone
your entire body in one workout session. In this workout, you exer-
cise all the major muscle groups of your body, from head to toe. The exer-
cises strengthen your bones, maintain joint flexibility, lengthen muscles, and
release tension held in tight muscles — all while you become perfectly aware
and perfectly relaxed. If you do these exercises on a regular basis, you’ll take
a giant step toward the goal of getting in shape and cultivating a calm mind
and beautiful body.
The Balanced Workout takes 20 to 30 minutes. Ideally, you should practice it
every other day. Of course, staying fit and finding the time for exercise can be a
challenge, but we urge you to take the time to do this workout. You’ll notice
your health improving in a matter of days — it’s what we call personal transfor-
mation, and the potential is unlimited. (For reasons why yoga with weights is a
timesaver, turn to Chapter 3, and for motivational tips, turn to Chapter 19.)
If you’re new to yoga with weights, you may wonder why you have to pay so
much attention to breathing. In every exercise, we tell you when to inhale and
exhale and how long to inhale and exhale, and between exercises, we instruct
you to pause for deep and steady breaths. We have you focus on breathing
because breathing correctly helps you to feel emotionally centered, physically
stronger, and mentally alert. In the Balanced Workout, you use the Complete

Breath, which fills your body from your chest to your belly (Chapter 4 explains
what the Complete Breath is). Breathing Complete Breaths is a mindful prac-
tice that harmonizes body, mind, and spirit; improves your circulation; and 
de-stresses your mind.
The Mountain
The Mountain is based on a traditional yoga master pose (meaning it affects
every system in your body). It’s a warm-up exercise that loosens and relaxes
your spine, shoulders, and neck. It opens up your chest, back, and spine for
vitality, and for these reasons, it’s good for your posture. The exercise also
establishes a foundation so you can focus on concentration and is wonderful
for developing balance and coordination.
Grab your hand weights before you climb the Mountain. When you’re ready
to go, follow these steps:
1. Stand with your legs as far apart as your hips and your toes pointing
straight ahead, and let the hand weights dangle at your sides with
your palms facing backward (see Figure 7-1a).
This is the starting position. Look straight ahead with your chin neither
lifted nor lowered.
2. As you inhale to a count of four, step forward with your right leg and
lift the weights above your shoulders (see Figure 7-1b).
Keep your arms straight and raise them directly above your shoulders.
Draw your belly in and up and your tailbone down for support. Focus on
how you distribute your body weight as you step forward.
If you feel any pinching in your shoulders or neck, you can lift the
weights halfway up, perpendicular to your body.
As you lift, the heel of your back foot may leave the floor, but keep the
ball of your foot planted (see Figure 7-1b). Concentrate on your breath-
ing and alignment during the lift. Make sure your breathing is steady and
even. Don’t shrug your shoulders.
3. As you exhale to a count of four, lower your arms and step back into
the starting position (see Figure 7-1a).
Lower the weight in time to your breathing. Don’t look up or look 
down — gaze straight ahead.
Alternating legs, repeat this exercise six to eight times with each leg. Pause to
rest, and then do six to eight more repetitions with each leg.
102
Part II: Mastering the Basics

Heaven and Earth
This exercise is called Heaven and Earth because you reach to the sky and
root to the earth at the same time. It stretches the side of your body and
brings oxygen to your back and spine; it helps you warm up and focus on
your breathing; and it gets the energy flowing through your body.
Grab your hand weights and follow these steps to reach for the heavens:
1. Stand with your legs as far apart as your hips and your toes pointing
straight ahead, and let the hand weights dangle at your sides with
your palms facing inward (see Figure 7-2a).
This is the starting position.
2. Inhaling to a count to four, extend the weight in your right hand for-
ward and then above your right shoulder, following the weight with
your eyes (see Figure 7-2b).
Stretch out your arm and shoulder as much as possible without lifting
your heels off the ground, and press your right foot into the ground as you
look to the sky. You should finish inhaling as the weight reaches its peak.
Feel your hip and the side of your body stretch as you lift the weight.

Chapter 7: From Head to Toe: The Balanced Workout

If your neck feels too tight, look toward your elbow; in other words, look
as high as you comfortably can. If your shoulders are tight, practice this
exercise without a weight or raise the weight halfway.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, lower the weight back to your side and
return to the starting position (see Figure 7-2a).
Keep your feet squarely on the floor throughout this exercise. Don’t throw
the weight — gently lift it. Focus on your breathing so that you have smooth
transitions as you inhale (when you lift the weight) and exhale (when you
lower the weight). Try to time your breathing so that you never hold your
breath. Your breathing helps you relax and do the stretching portion of this
exercise.
Repeat this exercise six to eight times with each arm, pause to rest, and then
do six to eight more repetitions with each arm.

The Rag Doll
The Rag Doll releases tension in the parts of your body where most people
carry tension — your neck and spine. It helps you relax and also works your
abdominal muscles and the core muscles of your torso for a total upper-body
workout.
Pick up your hand weights and follow these steps:
1. Standing with your feet directly below your hips and your toes point-
ing forward, let your hand weights dangle at your sides with your
palms facing inward (see Figure 7-3a).
This is the starting position. Don’t let your belly collapse in this 
exercise — sculpt your belly in and up. Let your abdominal muscles 
support your spine. You should feel an “energetic girdle” around your
abdomen.
Throughout this exercise, keep your feet parallel to one another, both
pointing straight ahead. Don’t turn them out.
2. Inhaling to a count of four, slowly roll your shoulders up and forward
(see Figure 7-3b).
Pause your breath momentarily when you reach the top of the shoulder
roll.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, bend your knees and roll your torso for-
ward with your shoulders leading the way (see Figure 7-3c).
Now you’re in the rag doll position, with your neck, head, and shoulders
feeling loose and relaxed. Don’t shrug your shoulders — roll them for-
ward, using the weights to help extend your body forward and lengthen
your spine.
You should feel your spine stretching as the weights hang. Keep your
knees slightly bent and move your hips back.
4. Inhaling to a count of four and pressing through your legs, roll your
shoulders up, back, and down as you return to the starting position
(see Figure 7-3a).
Feel the breath filling your lungs during this part of the exercise.
5. Exhale to a count of four as you rest in the starting position.
Do this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest, and then repeat the exercise
another six to eight times.

Chapter 7: From Head to Toe: The Balanced Workout

The Airplane
The Airplane raises the altitude of your attitude, making you feel uplifted. It
stimulates feel-good chemistry in your brain and works your biceps, triceps,
and upper torso. Imagine that you’re flying through blue skies as you do this
exercise.
You need the hand weights for this exercise; ankle weights are optional. Use
the ankle weights if you want additional tone and strength. Adding the extra
weight exercises your legs a bit more.
Follow these steps to fly the Airplane:
1. Stand with your feet together and directly below your hips, and hold
the weights in front of your chest with the knuckles of each hand
touching (see Figure 7-4a).
This is the starting position.
2. Slowly inhaling to a count of four, bend your left knee, extend your
right leg behind you as you lean forward, and open your arms to a 
C position (see Figure 7-4b).
While you’re extending your leg, look slightly upward toward your fore-
head and brow. To achieve the C position, imagine you’re crunching a
soda can with your shoulder blades.
To help with balancing, press your standing foot into the floor, draw
your belly in and up, and draw your tailbone down.

Part II: Mastering the Basics

If you feel pinched in your neck and shoulders or you otherwise experi-
ence distress as you maneuver the hand weights, use lighter weights or
no weights at all.
3. Slowly exhaling to a count of four, return the hand weights to your
chest as you lower your leg to the floor and assume the starting posi-
tion (see Figure 7-4a).
Repeat this exercise six to eight times with each leg, pause to rest, and then
do the exercise six to eight more times with each leg.
The Triangle
The Triangle is based on a powerful and ancient yoga master pose. It’s an
extended side angle pose that beginners can enjoy. The exercise works many
muscles in your body, but it concentrates on the core muscles of your trunk,
your shoulders, and your legs. As you balance, the Triangle also helps you
trace and explore the physical feeling and sensation of your body.
You need hand weights for this exercise, so grab them and follow these steps:
1. With your feet parallel to each other, stand with your legs as wide
apart as you comfortably can, and hold the weights at your waist with
your palms facing inward.
2. Turn both feet to the right and bend at the right knee until you align
your knee over your ankle (see Figure 7-5a).
3. Rotate your torso to the right and rest your right forearm on your right
thigh or knee; let the weight in your left hand hang to the ground with
your arm straight and your palm facing inward (see Figure 7-5b).

Chapter 7: From Head to Toe: The Balanced Workout

This is the starting position.
Draw your belly in and up and your tailbone down to stabilize your legs,
trunk, and spine. If you feel a burning sensation along the top of your
supporting leg, your leg is doing too much support work. Focus on the
core muscles of your torso and trunk so that they do more of the lifting
and balancing work.
4. Exhaling to a count of four, lift the weight in your left hand to your
torso, bending your elbow toward the ceiling and drawing your shoul-
der slightly back, over, and downward as you lift (see Figure 7-5c).
Look toward the ceiling and imagine that you’re pulling back an arrow
on a bow. You should feel a solid pulling action that goes up, over, and
back with each lift.
5. Inhaling to a count of four, bring your head and torso back down as
you turn to the right and lower the weight to the starting position (see
Figure 7-5b).

Part II: Mastering the Basics

Follow the weight with your eyes. Don’t drop the weight — lower it
slowly to the floor.
To anchor yourself, press down onto all four corners of your right foot and
onto the balls of your left foot as you do this exercise. Don’t let your support-
ing knee wobble from side to side or extend over your toes.
If you’re flexible enough, straighten both legs as you do this exercise. If you
feel a strain in your neck, use lighter weights.
Do this exercise six to eight times on each leg, pause to rest, and then do the
exercise six to eight more times on each leg.
The Exalted Warrior
The Exalted Warrior makes use of a classic yoga pose — the victorious war-
rior. You feel the strength, honor, and courage of a warrior as you do this
exercise; it sends a surge of power through your entire body. It strengthens
and tones your upper torso, opens your collarbone, teaches you to work the
core muscles of your trunk for balance, and strengthens your legs.
Pick up your hand weights for this exercise and follow these steps:
1. Stand with your feet together and your toes pointing forward, and
allow the hand weights to dangle at your sides with your palms facing
backward.
2. Gently step back with your right foot, keeping your legs straight.
Turn your back foot slightly out for balance and stability. Align your
shoulders with your hips.
Make sure your legs are strong and engaged. Let your back and your
front leg support you.
3. Raise your arms forward until they’re directly above your shoulders
(see Figure 7-6a).
This is the starting position. Draw your belly in and up and point your
tailbone down throughout the rest of the exercise.
4. As you exhale to a count of four, pull your arms down, bending your
elbows and holding the weights at ear-level (see Figure 7-6b).
This movement is what weightlifters call a back-lat pull-down. Pull 
down with your lats — the muscles on your back around your shoulder
blades — as well as with your shoulders. Don’t let your wrists flop or
cock back as you do this exercise; keep them aligned with your forearms.
5. As you inhale to a count of four, press the weights back up to the start-
ing position (see Figure 7-6a).
109
Chapter 7: From Head to Toe: The Balanced Workout

Do this exercise six to eight times on each leg, pause to rest, and then do the
exercise six to eight more times on each leg.
The Warrior II
The Warrior II is a variation of the Exalted Warrior, the previous exercise in
this workout. This version works your biceps, legs, and the core muscles of
your trunk and torso. It looks easy, but if you do it right, the exercise works
your entire body and teaches you the power of concentration.
Pick up your hand weights for this exercise and follow these steps:
1. Stand with your legs as far apart as you comfortably can and your feet
pointing forward, and hold the weights at your waist with your palms
facing forward.
2. Turn both of your feet to the right and bend your right knee until you
align it vertically with your ankle.
Your back foot should be pointing at a 45-degree angle, and your right
foot should be pointing straight ahead to your right. Keep your torso
centered equally between your heels and your hips rotated wide open.
You’re in a lunge position.

3. Raise your arms to shoulder height with your palms facing upward
and your arms extended away from your body (see Figure 7-7a).
This is the starting position. Concentrate on your legs to keep them
strong and stable as you move your arms.
4. Exhaling to a count of four, draw your hands to your shoulders with a
bicep curl (see Figure 7-7b).
Draw your belly in and up and your tailbone down to support yourself
and maintain your balance. The Warrior II is a total body exercise, not
just a biceps exercise. Don’t let your front knee wobble or move forward
over your toes.
5. Inhaling to a count of four, return to the starting position (see 
Figure 7-7a).
Do this exercise six to eight times on each leg, pause to rest, and then do six
to eight more repetitions on each leg.
The Camel
Tired of leaning forward all day to look at your computer screen or lift boxes
off the ground? If so, the Camel — a classic yoga pose — is for you. It’s a simple
exercise, but it has real benefits. It stretches out your spine; tones your thighs
and backside; opens up your chest, armpits, and back; and improves circula-
tion to your lungs and heart region. In most daily activities, you lean forward,
but this exercise gives you an opportunity to stretch the other direction.
If you have sensitive knees, don’t sit on your heels during this exercise. Try
straddling a rolled-up yoga mat, a stack of books, or a briefcase.

Grab your hand weights for this exercise and follow these steps:
1. Sit on your knees with your buttocks resting on your heels and your
legs flat on the floor, and hold the weights at your sides with your
palms facing backward (see Figure 7-8a).
This is the starting position. Look straight ahead, and keep your spine
erect.
2. As you inhale to a count of four, rise to your knees — using the power
and strength of your thigh muscles — and lift the weights straight
above your shoulders (see Figure 7-8b).
Let your breath establish a rhythm as you rise and lift.
3. As you exhale to a count of four, sit down on your legs, and lower the
weights to the starting position (see Figure 7-8a).
Don’t swing the weights. Carefully control the release as you kneel and
sit back down.
Do this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest, and then do it six to eight
more times.

The Table
Remember your mom telling you to sit up straight at the dinner table? Well,
she would approve of this exercise, called the Table. It works and tones your
buttocks, hips, and thighs; it exercises your back and spine to develop core-
strength conditioning; and it helps you develop the muscles that support
your trunk. Overall, this exercise helps you develop good posture. You also
kick like a donkey and develop leg strength, which your mom probably didn’t
approve of at the table.
Time to grab your ankle weights. After you’re strapped in, follow these steps:
1. Get on all fours with your hands directly below your shoulders and
your knees directly under your hips.
Lift your waistline so that your back feels flat. Spread your fingers wide
so they support your weight.
2. Lift your right leg up to the height of your hip, keeping the plane of
your body flat (see Figure 7-9a).
This is the starting position.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, bend your knee backward and push your
leg up (see Figure 7-9b).
Press your foot up so it’s higher than your hip, without rolling your hip
to the side. Keep your leg directly behind you and your hips squared.
Flex your foot as if you’re standing on the floor.
If you feel discomfort in your lower back, don’t raise your leg as high.
Use a lighter weight if you have trouble lifting your leg.
4. Exhaling to a count of four, unbend your knee and bring your leg
back to the starting position (see Figure 7-9a).
Let your breathing guide you. Slowly move your foot upward as you inhale;
move it back down slowly as you exhale. Count to four as you complete each
inhale and exhale.
Don’t push with your arms or bend your elbows. Use them only for stability
and maintaining your balance. Don’t sag as you do this exercise.
Do this exercise six to eight times with each leg, pause to rest, and then do it
six to eight more times with each leg.

Chapter 7: From Head to Toe: The Balanced Workout

The Cat
Cats are experts when it comes to stretching, so it should come as no sur-
prise that the Cat stretches out your spine, back, neck, and shoulders. This
exercise works the same muscles as the Table (see the previous exercise in
this workout), but you also stretch your spine and belly. Take your inspira-
tion from a cat as you work through this exercise; do it a few times, and you’ll
be good at stretching, too.
You need to strap on your ankle weights for this exercise. Ready to go?
Follow these steps:
1. Get on all fours with your knees directly under your hips and your
hands directly below your shoulders.
Make sure your fingers are spread wide for support.
2. Extend your right leg behind you, and look forward and up (see
Figure 7-10a).
This is the starting position. Draw your belly in and up and your tailbone
down for support.

Don’t rotate your leg (what a dog does next to a fire hydrant). Make sure
it’s in line with the rest of your body.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, draw your right leg deep into your chest
as you arch your back and look toward your navel (see Figure 7-10b).
Point your nose at your pelvis as you move toward your bent knee.
Don’t swing your leg; move it slowly in rhythm with your breathing.
4. Breathe four counts in and four counts out while in the tucked 
position.
5. Inhaling to a count of four, lift your head, flatten your back, and
extend your right leg back to the starting position (see Figure 7-10a).
Keep your arms straight to stabilize and balance your body throughout this
exercise. Make sure they stay directly below your shoulders.
Do this exercise six to eight times with each leg, pause to rest, and then do it
six to eight more times with each leg.

The Dog
The Dog introduces ankle weights to a classic yoga master pose — the down-
ward-facing dog. The Dog strengthens, stretches, and tones all parts of your
body, but especially your rhomboids (the muscles behind your thighs) and
hamstrings (the muscles on the back of your legs above the knees). The exer-
cise also improves circulation to your head and chest, which helps you feel
strong and mentally awake.
Grab your ankle weights and follow these steps:
1. Get on all fours with your knees directly under your hips and your
hands directly below your shoulders.
Make sure your fingers are spread wide for support.
2. Pressing through your palms and the balls of your feet, lift your hips,
push your thighs backward, press your sitting bones up to the sky,
and move your belly in and up until you’re in an upside-down V posi-
tion (see Figure 7-11a).
This is the starting position. Your ears should now be between your
arms.
Stand on the balls of your feet if you can’t stretch your hamstrings far
enough to keep your feet flat. If your hamstrings and Achilles tendons
are tight, feel free to spread your legs a little farther apart.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, lift your right leg directly behind you
toward the ceiling without rotating your hips (see Figure 7-11b).
Try to keep your leg straight, and square your hips. Press your hands
into the floor and keep your elbows straight. If you’re collapsing in your
arms, lift up your armpits as if you’re shrugging your shoulders.
4. Exhaling to a count of four, slowly lower your leg to the starting posi-
tion (see Figure 7-11a).
If you feel like your arms are working too hard, bend your knees more, pull
your belly in, press into your hands, and move your thighs back.
Breathe fully — four counts inhaling and four counts exhaling — as you do
this exercise. Alternating legs, perform six to eight repetitions with each leg,
pause to rest, and then do six to eight more reps with both legs.

The Bridge
Maybe you know the old yoga saying: You’re as young as your spine is limber.
The Bridge is designed to stretch your spine to make it more elastic. The
exercise also stretches your rib cage and chest and strengthens your upper
back, torso, hamstrings, and calves. As for any wrinkles you may have? Sorry,
the bridge can’t iron them out.
If you have a lower back problem, do this exercise tentatively at first, and
engage your buttocks muscles as you engage your abdominals; this helps
stabilize your lower back.
You need your hand weights to cross this bridge; ankle weights are optional.
After you’ve prepared, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent, your feet planted flat on the
floor, and your palms facing downward while holding the weights on
the floor (see Figure 7-12a).
This is the starting position. Make sure your lower back is flat against
the floor. Look straight up at the ceiling.

2. Inhaling to a count of four, raise your hips and buttocks to knee
height and lift both arms above your head (see Figure 7-12b).
Your hands should move 180 degrees to the floor behind you. Press
down into your feet as you lift your hips and buttocks, and rely on your
shoulders to bear most of the burden.
If you feel any discomfort in your shoulders, neck, or arms, lift your
arms halfway.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, lower your back to the floor one vertebra
at a time and bring your arms forward and back down to the starting
position (see Figure 7-12a).
Keep your tailbone down and your abdominal core strong to take the strain
off your lower back during this exercise. And keep your knees stable and in
their starting position; they shouldn’t wobble.
Do this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest, and then do it six to eight
more times.
The Frog
It takes some pretty limber muscles to jump from lily pad to lily pad, which is
why frogs are good models for yoga-with-weights exercises. This particular
exercise, aptly named the Frog, opens up, stretches, and relaxes your groin,

hips, and pelvis. It also lengthens your spine. You’ll feel your blood coursing
through your body as you do the Frog.
Strap on your ankle weights for this exercise and follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back and, with your knees bent and spread wide, lift your
legs to your chest so you can hold your feet, ankles, or calves (see
Figure 7-13a).
This is the starting position. Draw your belly in and up for support. The
bottom of your spine should feel elongated.
If your knees or inner groin muscles feel tight, extend your legs halfway.
You can also hold your inner thighs rather than your feet, ankles, or
calves.
2. Exhaling slowly to a count of four, straighten your right leg as far as
you comfortably can while still holding your toes, calves, or ankles
(see Figure 7-13b).
Pull your belly in; this exercise works your belly muscles, which you
need to support your legs and keep them from getting overextended.
Don’t lift your back off the floor or rock your body from side to side.

3. Inhaling slowly to a count of four, return your right leg to the starting
position (see Figure 7-13a).
Do this exercise six to eight times with each leg, pause to rest, and then do
another six to eight repetitions with each leg.
The Zen
Your Balanced Workout is over — time to relax and enjoy how great your
workout has made you feel. As you do this last cool-down exercise, feel the
gentle rise and fall of your breath. In yoga, transitions are always important.
During this exercise, see if you can make a smooth transition from exercising
to whatever activity you want to do next.
You need ankle weights for this exercise, but don’t put them on. Follow these
steps:
1. Lie on your back with your ankle weights resting on your diaphragm
(see Figure 7-14).
The weight is to make you aware of your breathing.
2. Take in eight to ten Balancing Breaths.
Taking Balancing Breaths is a great way to relax (for more detail, see
Chapter 4).

Ending Meditation
We recommend that you engage in a moment or two of silent meditation at
the end of your workout. A meditation session at the end of a workout brings
everything together. It quiets your body and brings closure so you can start
afresh with whatever you want to do next in your day (or your night if you’re
a night-owl yoga-with-weights practitioner). Chapter 6 explains meditation
techniques. We encourage you to read that chapter and find a meditation
technique that you enjoy and benefit from.

In this part . . .
P
art III is the heart of this book. It offers five yoga-
with-weights workouts designed to energize, restore,
strengthen, or tone different parts of your body.
Try the Energy Workout (Chapter 8) when your energy
starts to wane and you need a boost. Hit up the Restorative
Workout (Chapter 9) when you want to feel alert and wide
awake. When you want to get stronger, the Strengthening
Workout (Chapter 10) is for you, and when you want to
increase your stamina, go to the Endurance Workout
(Chapter 11). Are your pants too tight? Better try the
Belly-Burner Workout (Chapter 12). Good luck!

Chapter 8
Waking Up Your Mind and Body: 
The Energy Workout
In This Chapter
 Re-energizing your mind and body
 Releasing tension in your body through breathing
 Calming your mind and body to a baseline level
W
hen you start to feel listless in the afternoon or early evening, forgo the
cup of coffee or the sugar-filled snack and do the body shaping, men-
tally awakening exercises in this chapter instead. Your body will respond in
positive ways after you do this energy-boosting workout a few times. You’ll feel
fitter and more energized as the exercises recharge your spiritual batteries.
The yoga-with-weights exercises in this chapter really get your body moving.
We designed these exercises to benefit your circulation and nervous system,
allow you to let go of your anxieties, and help you de-stress. The deep breath-
ing brings calm and quiet to help you deal with stress, which gives you more
energy and sharpens your senses. You’ll discover a keener awareness of the
world around you. You’ll feel refreshed and renewed.
It takes 20 to 30 minutes to do the Energy Workout. If you perform these exer-
cises several times each week, you’ll start to notice your overall energy level
improving; your memory sharpening because you aren’t tired or stressed out;
and your sleep deepening so you feel more relaxed, sharp, and clear through-
out the day. You’ll create the mental alertness and energy necessary to com-
plete the daily activities that you want to do, and you won’t get frustrated or
tired as often. These exercises can be a mini-break that makes a positive dif-
ference in how you feel — and they take only a few minutes of your day.

Practice the exercises in the Energy Workout with thoughtfulness and care.
Don’t push yourself too far; take the time to feel your muscles at work, and
understand where your exercise limits are. Breathing is an essential element
in all the workouts we provide, but especially in this one because of the
demand you place on your body. In this workout, you use the Ocean Breath,
which you can read about in Chapter 4. This kind of breathing maximizes the
potential of your upper chest for breathing and exercising.
The Chair
The Chair is a total-body strengthening exercise that particularly benefits
your shoulders, arms, and legs and also exercises your buttocks, abs, and
hamstrings. As you do it, press into the ground on all four corners of your
feet as you raise and lower the weights.
You need hand weights for this exercise. When you’re ready, follow these
steps:
1. Stand with your feet below your hips, your toes pointing forward, and
the weights held at your sides with your palms facing inward (see
Figure 8-1a).
This is the starting position. Draw your belly in and up and your tailbone
down for support.
2. As you inhale to a count of four, sit on an imaginary seat, and slowly
raise your arms above your shoulders until they align with your ears
(see Figure 8-1b).
Raise your arms in front of your body, keeping your palms inward. Imagine
that a chair is behind you and you’re touching it with your buttocks.
If your knees bother you, don’t crouch as far; take your tailbone down
and pull your belly in more. You can also raise your arms only to shoul-
der height if you have trouble lifting the weights.
3. As you exhale to a count of four, stand up and slowly lower the
weights back to the starting position (see Figure 8-1a).
Be patient as you do this exercise — let the rhythm of your breathing lift you
up and lower you down. As long as you focus on your breathing, you won’t
throw the weights upward. Inflate your body as you breathe in, letting the
intake of air raise your arms as if someone were blowing you up like a balloon.
Repeat this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest, and then do another six
to eight repetitions.
126
Part III: Refining Your Technique 

The Skater
The Skater is an aerobic exercise that works the muscles of your buttocks. By
the time you do this exercise twice, you’ll be huffing and puffing. The balanc-
ing aspect of this exercise fires and stimulates your brain’s nerve connec-
tions. The Skater is similar to the Chair (see the previous exercise in this
workout), but here you lift a leg behind you.
Focus on inhaling and exhaling so you don’t do this exercise too fast and
throw the weights. Keep your chest open as you inhale and exhale through-
out this exercise.
Make sure your ankle weights are strapped on, and grab your hand weights.
When you’re ready, follow these steps:
1. Stand with your feet below your hips, your toes pointing forward, and
the hand weights at your sides with your palms facing backward (see
Figure 8-2a).
This is the starting position. Spread your toes wide, pressing hard into
the ground through all four corners of both feet — your heels and your
toes. You should actively engage both feet. Also, for support, draw your
belly in and up and point your tailbone down.

2. As you inhale to a count of four, lift the weights above your head
while you bend your left leg for support and lift your right leg behind
you as high as you can without losing balance (see Figure 8-2b).
Lift your arms in front of your body until they reach the height of your
ears. As you lift, sit back a little bit with your buttocks behind your heel.
Feel your buttocks squeezing as your hips are parallel to the floor.
Keep your leg behind you (don’t lift it to your side as a dog does beside
a fire hydrant).
3. As you exhale to a count of four, return to the starting position (see
Figure 8-2a).
Keep your chest open as you exhale.
If you have trouble balancing, try using lighter weights, or do the exercise
without the hand weights and rest your hands on your hips. You can also do
this exercise without the ankle weights.
Alternating legs with each repetition, repeat this exercise six to eight times
with each leg, pause to rest, and then do another six to eight repetitions with
each leg. You’re imitating the gliding motion of an ice skater.

The Crow
The Crow is a weighted version of a classic yoga posture that works your but-
tocks, your upper shoulders, your belly, and your legs. It stretches and condi-
tions your hamstrings and calves and also works your spine. The exercise
may seem difficult to do at first, but you can master it with a little practice.
With your ankle weights strapped in place, follow these steps:
1. Stand with your feet touching or as close to touching as possible, and
let your arms fall to your sides.
2. Crouch down with your knees parted, put your elbows inside your
knees, and rest your hands at shoulder width on the floor (see Fig-
ure 8-3a).
This is the starting position. You should be squatting deep into your
heels. Do your best to keep your heels down while you’re in the squat-
ting position.
If your knees bother you or you have trouble squatting, try squatting
halfway. You can also try this exercise without ankle weights if they
cause too much trouble for you. Always work at your own level of ability.
3. As you inhale to a count of four, straighten your left leg and raise your
right leg behind you (see Figure 8-3b).
Push through your right foot like a swimmer pushing off the side of the
pool. Don’t rotate your hips; keep them square. Be careful not to kick out
your back leg.
Support yourself with your hands and shoulders as well as your left leg,
and sculpt your belly in and up for stability. Keep your supporting leg
and your hands flat on the floor.
If you can’t keep your supporting leg straight and maintain your flat
hand position, bend your knee a little.
4. As you exhale to a count of four, lower your extended leg and return
to the starting position (see Figure 8-3a).
Alternating legs, do this exercise six to eight times with each leg, pause to
rest, and then do another six to eight reps with each leg.
129
Chapter 8: Waking Up Your Mind and Body: The Energy Workout

The Runner
We call this exercise the Runner because the starting position makes you
look like a sprinter in the starting blocks and because you get the feeling of
freedom and exhilaration that comes from running in an open field. The exer-
cise strengthens your arm and belly muscles and develops your timing,
rhythm, and coordination. The Runner also stretches out your hamstrings,
works your legs, and won’t upset your allergies like the field.
Strap on your ankle weights and follow these steps:
1. Start on all fours with your shoulders directly over your wrists and
your hips directly over your knees.
Spread your fingers wide for support.
Make sure the inside creases of your elbows face each other. In other
words, don’t turn your elbows out. If you’re limber, you run the risk of
tearing a ligament if you turn your elbows out.
2. Lean back, bringing your heels toward the ground as you draw your
knees toward your belly and your buttocks toward your heels (see
Figure 8-4a).
This is the starting position. Your knees should be deeply bent. Draw
your belly in and up and your tailbone down for support.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, straighten your left leg as you lift your
right leg toward the ceiling (see Figure 8-4b).
As best you can, keep both legs straight. Focus your eyes on your left
knee and shin. Feel your spine stretching.

Remove the ankle weights or wear lighter weights if lifting your leg up
high proves too difficult.
4. Inhaling to a count of four, lower your right leg and return to the
starting position (see Figure 8-4a).
Look forward as you squat.
Alternating legs, do this exercise six to eight times with each leg, pause to
rest, and then do another six to eight reps with each leg.
The Eye of the Needle
The Eye of the Needle is a squeeze-and-soak exercise, which means it mas-
sages your organs (see Chapter 1 for more). The exercise also loosens your
spine, opens up your chest and shoulders, and strengthens and conditions
your whole upper torso and shoulder-rotation mechanism.
Don’t hold your breath in this exercise (be conscious of breathing in and
out). Keep your hips over your knees at all times, and remember that your
supporting arm should be active the entire time as you look through the Eye
of the Needle; don’t let this arm go limp.
Grab one hand weight, and make sure your ankle weights are strapped on.
When you’re ready, follow these steps:
1. Start on all fours with your hips directly over your knees and your
hands on the floor directly below your shoulders; hold a weight in
your right hand (see Figure 8-5a).
In this position, you should draw your belly below your navel in and up
for abdominal stability. Your toes should be pointing straight back.
2. Inhaling to a count of four, press your left palm down as you slowly
raise your right arm up (along with the weight), keeping it straight,
and roll your right shoulder back (see Figure 8-5b).

Chapter 8: Waking Up Your Mind and Body: The Energy Workout

This is the starting position. Rotate your shoulder and open your chest
to the right side as you look toward the ceiling.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, slowly bring your right hand under and
past your body as you stretch out your back and roll onto the back-
side of your right shoulder (see Figure 8-5c).
Your head and the weight should move onto the floor. Feel your back
and shoulder stretching as you move the weight onto the floor.
Watch the weight with your eyes as you roll down. This way, your head
flows with the movement of your shoulder and arm. Tuck your chin in
slightly to loosen your neck.
If your shoulders are too tight to roll all the way down, you may want to
rest your head on a rolled-up blanket or towel so your neck isn’t strain-
ing and then gently rotate as far as you can. You can also move your sup-
porting hand forward and out from your body to make the needle loop
bigger.
4. Inhaling to a count of four, return to the starting position (see Fig-
ure 8-5b).
Pull the weight back through the loop in rhythm with your breathing.
Do this exercise six to eight times with each arm, pause to rest, and then do
the exercise six to eight more times with each arm.

The Dog to Plank
The Dog to Plank is a powerful upper-body strengthener. This exercise gives
you overall strength benefits, which is why you find it in more than one work-
out (see Chapter 10). It sculpts and tones the entire trunk of your body and
also works your buttocks. Along with the strength benefits, the Dog to Plank
gives you an endurance exercise with aerobic benefits, and it develops your
ability to concentrate. Think the title of the exercise is funny? Well, as you do
this exercise, think of how a dog stretches after waking up from a nap, and
imagine what your dog is thinking as he watches you.
Make sure you have your ankle weights on, and follow these steps:
1. Begin on all fours with your hands directly below your shoulders,
your knees directly underneath your hips, and your toes planted on
the ground (see Figure 8-6a).
Spread your fingers wide for support.
2. Move into the downward-facing dog position by lifting your hips and
buttocks as you straighten your legs, bring your thighs back, and
move your heels toward the floor.
Your ears should be between your arms. Draw your belly in and up and
your tailbone down for support.
3. As you inhale to a count of four, lift your right leg up as high as you
can without twisting your hip open (see Figure 8-6b).
This is the starting position. Push your leg straight back, and flex your
foot to keep it fully engaged — it shouldn’t be limp.
4. As you exhale to a count of four, bring the trunk of your body for-
ward so that your shoulders are over your wrists (see Figure 8-6c).
You’re in the plank position. Keep your lifted leg parallel to the floor if
you’re strong enough; otherwise, tap your toe on the floor. You should
feel your abdominal and arm muscles working.
Don’t bend your elbows; support your weight through your shoulders
and across your back without using your chest muscles.
5. As you inhale to a count of four, return to the starting position (see
Figure 8-6b).
Don’t lunge backward. Be patient, and move in rhythm with your 
breathing.
You can do this exercise without ankle weights if you have too much trouble.
Do this exercise six to eight times with each leg, pause to rest, and then do
another six to eight repetitions with each leg.
133

The Twisted Triangle
The Twisted Triangle is a squeeze-and-soak exercise, which means that it
massages your internal organs. Along with warming your insides, it length-
ens, tones, stretches, and conditions your legs, back, and spine. Talk about
an all-around body conditioner.
If you discover that you’re not ready for this exercise, don’t rush. Take it
slowly. You can injure your lower back if you do the twisting motion in this
exercise incorrectly.
You use one hand weight in this exercise. When you’re ready, follow these
steps:
1. Stand with your feet as far apart as you comfortably can, with your
arms extended straight away from your body forming a straight line
with your shoulders (see Figure 8-7a).
Make sure you have the weight resting in front of your right foot.
2. Turn the trunk of your body to face your right leg and, as you bend
your right knee, gently lean forward.
3. Rest your left hand on the outside of your right foot, and grasp the
weight with your right hand (see Figure 8-7b).

This is the starting position. Draw your belly in and up and your tailbone
down for stability and balance.
If you can, square your hips, with your right hip back and your left hip for-
ward. Not everyone can square their hips in this position, however, and if you
can’t, do your best and don’t worry about it.
4. Exhaling to a count of four, bend your right elbow and lift the weight
as you rotate your shoulder and trunk (see Figure 8-7c).
Imagine you’re an archer pulling back the string of a bow. Twist your
trunk, starting at the bottom of your spine and working your way up, one
vertebra at a time. Lift your head to the right with the weight as you twist.
Your left hand should remain by your right foot as you lift. Press down
into the balls of your feet for balance and stability.
5. Inhaling to a count of four, unwind and lower the weight to the start-
ing position (see Figure 8-7b).
Be patient as you return to the starting position. Focusing on your
breathing helps you return to the starting position in rhythm. Your left
hand should remain by your right foot as you lower.

Chapter 8: Waking Up Your Mind and Body: The Energy Workout

Try straightening your front leg to stretch your hamstring. If you can’t rotate
your trunk, lift the weight to exercise your triceps without rotating your
shoulder and chest.
Do this exercise six to eight times on each leg, pause to rest, and then do the
exercise six to eight more times on each leg.
The Warrior I
The Warrior I, a relatively simple exercise, is a weighted variation of the clas-
sic warrior yoga pose. As you do this exercise, you tap the energy of your
heart and feel the strength, honor, and courage of a warrior. On a more practi-
cal note, the Warrior I works your biceps and legs.
If you can, keep your hips squared throughout this exercise; neither hipbone
should be forward of the other. If squaring your hips is too hard, however,
forget it and do your best.
Grab your hand weights and follow these steps:
1. Standing with your feet below your hips, your toes pointing forward,
and the hand weights hanging at your sides with your palms facing
inward, step back with your right foot and bend your left leg for sup-
port (see Figure 8-8a).
This is the lunge position — and the starting position. Turn out your
back foot slightly and keep looking forward.
Your bent knee shouldn’t be forward of your ankle. Also, press in with all
four corners of your foot.
2. As you exhale to a count of four, bend your elbows and work your
biceps as you lift the weights to shoulder level (see Figure 8-8b).
Draw your belly in and up and your tailbone down for support. Keep
your elbows locked in; rocking isn’t allowed.
3. As you inhale to a count of four, lower the weights to the starting posi-
tion (see Figure 8-8a).
Don’t let your back sag — keep it straight.
Do this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest, and then do six to eight
more repetitions.

The Rise and Shine
The Rise and Shine is a transitional exercise that helps you relax after your
strenuous workout. The exercise massages your internal organs and helps
you unwind. Imagine you’re greeting the morning sun as you do this exercise,
feeling its warm rays relaxing your body.
Do a yogic Balancing Breath as you do this exercise (Chapter 4 explains the
yoga breaths). Don’t rush; take your time and relax.
You need both hand weights for this exercise. When you’re ready, follow
these steps:
1. Crouch with your feet about 6 inches apart, your buttocks behind
your heels, your elbows outside of your knees, and the weights in
your hands with your palms turned inward (see Figure 8-9a).
This is the starting position. You should be looking slightly downward.
Keep your toes pointing straight ahead throughout this exercise.
2. As you inhale, pull your belly in and press down through your feet as
you rise to a standing position and extend your arms away from your
body to the T position (see Figure 8-9b).
Your palms should be facing downward at this point.

3. Continue to inhale as you turn your palms upward and bring your
arms together above your head, looking up as you do so (Figure 8-9c).
Steps 2 and 3 should be one continuous motion.
4. As you exhale, slowly lower your arms, turn your palms downward
again, and return to the starting position (see Figure 8-9a).
Feel your body deflating as you exhale; slowly lower yourself to the
ground in rhythm with your breathing.
Repeat this exercise six to eight times.

Ending Meditation
Consider sitting quietly for a moment of meditation after you finish the

 Increasing your energy level
 Boosting your metabolic rate
 Alleviating the stress you carry
 Improving your circulation
I
f you’re like most people, you have 101 things to do during your busy day.
The Restorative Workout is designed to not only give you the energy to
complete your tasks, but also to do them energetically and enthusiastically.
The Restorative Workout is the perfect antidote to stress — it leaves you feel-
ing free and unencumbered afterward.
Great, you have the energy for your day . . . but what about the time you
don’t seem to have? In the 30 minutes it takes you to order a pizza and have it
delivered or to make cookies for snacks, you can complete this workout for a
boost of energy. You get the energy you need to keep going — and you take a
giant step toward getting in shape. You recover the energy you need for your
day without having to rely on high-octane sugar snacks or starchy foods. The
exercises in this workout give you a kick-start and help you to meet your fit-
ness goals.
If you practice the exercises in the Restorative Workout every other day,
you’ll stimulate your circulation and your metabolic rate. These exercises
keep you moving while giving you the calm, steady energy and equanimity
that makes you feel great.
Try doing these exercises before a party or other special event when you
want to feel and look your best and have an alert, stress-free, and bright state
of mind.
For the Restorative Workout, you should use the Complete Breath, which is a
deep, relaxing breath. You can discover more about it in Chapter 4.

The Child’s Pose
The Child’s Pose is a weighted variation of a classic yoga pose. The exercise
relaxes your back, head, neck, and shoulders and stretches your spine and
quads — the muscles of your upper legs. Your body should feel warmed up
after working these areas. Besides working your muscles, this introspective
exercise can help you collect your thoughts and achieve a state of repose. It
massages your intestines to help with digestion and elimination, and you can
feel energy passing along your spine to your forehead.
You need hand weights for this exercise. When you’re ready, follow these
steps:
1. Starting on your knees and holding the weights at your sides — palms
facing backward — touch your feet together, widen your knees, and
rest your buttocks on your heels.
2. Slowly lean forward, resting your mid-section on your thighs and
touching your forehead to the floor (see Figure 9-1a).
This is the starting position. Your arms should be extended past your
feet with your palms facing upward. Feel your spine stretching and your
mid-section resting on your thighs. Don’t shrug your shoulders —
spread them wide.
If you have trouble touching your forehead to the floor, spread your
knees wider and lower your forehead as far as you can. If you feel
uncomfortable resting your buttocks on your heels, try putting a pillow
or rolled-up mat under your buttocks. Put a folded blanket under your
knees if you feel uncomfortable there. You can also do this exercise with-
out the weights.
3. Inhale to a count of four as you raise your arms behind you to back-
level (see Figure 9-1b).
Lift your arms slowly toward the ceiling — don’t jerk them, or you may
hurt your neck. Draw your belly in and up and your tailbone down for
stability.
4. Exhale to a count of four as you slowly lower the weights to the floor
and return to the starting position (see Figure 9-1a).
Raise and lower your arms in rhythm with your breathing — four counts in
and four counts out. Try to keep your buttocks on or close to your heels
throughout this exercise.
Do this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest, and then do another six to
eight repetitions.

The Lion
You may not realize it, but you hold tension in your face and jaw. The Lion, a
classic yoga exercise to which we’ve added weights, is designed to release
this tension — and to amuse anyone who’s in the room while you do it.
Warning: You make a funny face in this exercise. The Lion also opens up
your shoulders, widens your collarbone, and strengthens your spine.
You need your hand weights and ankle weights to become king or queen of
the gym. Follow these steps:
1. Sit comfortably in a cross-legged position with the ankle weights rest-
ing on your thighs; rest the hand weights on the ground alongside
your body, with your palms facing backward (see Figure 9-2a).
This is the starting position. Your spine should be erect, and your ankles
should be aligned with your heels. The ankle weights help anchor you
during the exercise.
If you can’t sit this way comfortably, sit on a pillow or mat.

2. Exhaling to a count of four, lift the hand weights forward to ear
height, making 90-degree angles with your bent arms.
3. With the last of your breath, thrust out your tongue and say “ah”(see
Figure 9-2b).
Lower your jaw and stick your tongue out — don’t be shy. Make the “ah”
sound, a slight growling noise. This is the only exercise in this book for
which you emit a sound.
4. Inhaling to a count of four, lower the hand weights down to your sides
and close your mouth (pull your tongue in first) to return to the start-
ing position (see Figure 9-2a).
Take a moment to enjoy how tension-free your face and jaw feel.
Do this exercise six to eight times, take a rest, and then do it another six to
eight times.

Part III: Refining Your Technique 

The Pigeon
Many people, especially men, are tight in the hip and groin areas, and the
Pigeon is designed to loosen these areas. The Pigeon stretches and expands
your hips and inner-thigh muscles by opening up your entire pelvic girdle. It
also stretches and lengthens your spine and exercises your biceps.
You need one hand weight for this exercise. Grab it and follow these steps:
1. From the kneeling position, slide your left leg back and tuck your
right heel under your left frontal hip bone (see Figure 9-3a).
Keep your hips squared, and try not to drag your left hip backward in
this pose. You can bend your left leg slightly; it doesn’t have to be
straight. Make sure you point your toes.
2. Slowly lower your elbows to the floor, and rest your trunk on your
right thigh.
Don’t bounce as you drop down — slowly and carefully lower yourself to
the floor. Lower yourself as far as you comfortably can if you can’t go all
the way.
If your groin or your quad muscle is too tight to do this exercise, place a
blanket or folded-up mat under your right buttock or thigh. If you can’t
lean all the way to the floor, lean halfway and support yourself with 
one arm.
Draw your belly in and up and your tailbone down for support. If you
feel a pain in your knee, it could be because you’re not supporting your-
self correctly with the muscles of your belly. This exercise is meant to
open up your hips and groin, not stretch your knee.
3. Grasp the weight in your right hand, keeping your palm face upward
(see Figure 9-3b).
This is the starting position.
4. Exhaling to a count of four, bend your right elbow into a bicep curl
(see Figure 9-3c).
Cross your right hand in front of you as you bend your elbow. Focus on
your breathing and feel your thigh, hips, and groin stretching.
5. Inhaling to a count of four, lower the weight to the starting position
(see Figure 9-3b).
When you lower the weight, it should land close to your left hand, not
below your right shoulder.
Alternating arms and legs, do this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest,
and then do another six to eight repetitions, alternating arms and legs.

Chapter 9: Taking It Easy: The Restorative Workout

The Sphinx
The Sphinx is a very relaxing exercise that requires concentration. In classic
yoga (without weights), the pose is considered the “pose of wisdom,”
because you look through your third eye — your intuitive and instinctive
center. Along with its centering powers, the Sphinx stretches and loosens
your head and neck.

Part III: Refining Your Technique 

The Sphinx is for your neck, not your shoulders. Keep your shoulders square,
and don’t twist your spine during this exercise.
Strap on your ankle weights and follow these steps:
1. Lie on your stomach with your elbows under your shoulders — your
forearms, wrists, and palms should be flat on the ground — and your
chin up (see Figure 9-4a).
This is the starting position. Look straight ahead — not up or down.
Spread your fingers wide for stability and support.
If you have difficulty rising onto your elbows without moving your shoul-
ders, simply place your arms farther away from your body and raise
your head to a comfortable level.
2. Inhaling to a count of four, bend your left knee perpendicular to your
body as you look over your left shoulder (see Figure 9-4b).
Lift your foot over your knee. Turn your head as far as you can without
moving your shoulders. Time the movement of your head and leg so that
they finish moving at the same time.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, lower your leg and turn your head back to
the starting position (see Figure 9-4a).

Chapter 9: Taking It Easy: The Restorative Workout

As you turn your head, look out of the corner of your eyes at your foot, but
don’t turn your head to look at your foot. When you return to the starting
position, look straight ahead. Feel your neck stretching and twisting.
Alternating shoulders, do this exercise six to eight times with each shoulder,
pause to rest, and then do another six to eight repetitions with each shoulder.
The Big Ease
Are the exercises in the workout up to this point leaving you sore or tired?
Leave it to the Big Ease to iron out your kinks and help you relax. We call it
the Big Ease because it’s easy to do and it eases your body. The exercise
relaxes your hips and stretches all the muscles in the side of your trunk and
torso. It also lengthens your quadriceps muscles and releases tension in your
hips, neck, and shoulders. You’ll enjoy breathing more fully into your chest
and lungs as you do this exercise; just don’t fall asleep!
You need one hand weight and both ankle weights for this exercise. After you
grab the necessary weights, follow these steps:
1. Sit in a cross-legged position with your feet pulled in and the ankle
weights resting on your inner thighs.
Resting the weights on your inner thighs helps loosen and warm your
thighs and anchor your legs. Your ankles should be aligned with your
heels, one heel placed right in front of the other and right in front of
your pubic bone. Make sure your spine is erect.
If you can’t sit cross-legged because you feel tight, sit on a pillow or
folded-up mat. Doing so relaxes your inner-thigh area and allows your
knees to rest more comfortably.
2. Grab the hand weight with your left hand, and place your right hand
on the floor for support (see Figure 9-5a).
This is the starting position. Center your shoulders over your hips.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, lift your left hand over the crown of your
head as you feel the side of your body stretching; look toward your
right side and gently look down (see Figure 9-5b).
Stretch as far as you can with the side of your body without turning your
shoulders or leaning forward.
In this position, you can really feel the advantage of doing yoga with
weights, because the weight permits you to stretch farther.
Don’t rush during this exercise. Move the weight slowly without throw-
ing it over your head. You don’t want the weight to stretch you too far.
148
Part III: Refining Your Technique 

4. Exhaling to a count of four, return to the starting position (see Fig-
ure 9-5a).
You can relax your head and look slightly downward to take the tension
out of your neck and head, but remember not to lean forward. Draw your
belly in and up to help support the weight of your trunk and shoulders.
Do this exercise six to eight times with each side of your body, pause to rest,
and then do another six to eight repetitions with each side of your body.
The Gauge
When you do the Gauge, your legs work like the needle of a gauge, moving up
and down (but not around in a full circle, unless you’re really advanced).
You’ll feel this exercise mostly in your quads. It also lengthens, tones, and
conditions the trunk of your body and your arms.
You need both hand weights and ankle weights for this exercise. When you’re
ready, follow these steps:

Chapter 9: Taking It Easy: The Restorative Workout

1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your ankles underneath
your knees, and hold the hand weights at your sides with your palms
facing downward.
Make sure your feet are flat on the ground and as wide apart as your
hips.
2. Straighten your right leg to a 45-degree angle (see Figure 9-6a).
This is the starting position.
Draw your belly in and up and your tailbone down for support. Don’t let
your abdominal muscles release during the exercise.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, raise your right leg straight up to a 90-
degree angle as you lift the hand weights in a half-circle to the floor
behind you (see Figure 9-6b).
Don’t throw the weights behind you; raise them slowly and consciously.
Press into all four corners of your left foot as you lift. Flex your lifted
foot so that the bottom is parallel to the ceiling.
If your shoulders are too stiff, you can lift the hand weights halfway
behind your head. If you feel discomfort in your lower back, try this exer-
cise without any hand or ankle weights.

4. Exhaling to a count of four, lower your right leg back to a 45-degree
angle and bring your arms back over and down to the starting posi-
tion (see Figure 9-6a).
Time this step so that your leg and your arms arrive at the starting posi-
tion at the same time. Move the weights as fluidly and rhythmically as
possible with the action of your legs.
Do this exercise six to eight times with each leg, pause to rest, and then do
another six to eight repetitions with each leg.
The Twister
No, the Twister doesn’t mean you need to plan a party and call your friends.
This Twister is a squeeze-and-soak exercise, which means that it massages
and squeezes your inner organs. The Twister strengthens and tones your
waistline, legs, back, and abs. And in order to make you the best twister at
your next party, this exercise works your spine to give it more flexibility.
You need both hand weights and ankle weights for this exercise. Follow these
steps to get going:
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and tucked together high into
your chest and your arms straight out from your shoulders in a T 
position; hold the hand weights with your palms facing upward (see
Figure 9-7a).
This is the starting position. The higher into your chest you can tuck
your knees, the better. Flex and press through all four corners of your
feet.
Holding the hand weights in the T position works as a counterbalance,
and the position keeps your collarbones and shoulder blades wide so
you have a greater range of motion from side to side.
2. Exhaling to a count of four, slowly move your joined knees to the right
until your right knee touches the floor (see Figure 9-7b).
Make sure your knees are stacked one on top of the other. Don’t drop
your legs; control their downward motion by concentrating on your
four-count breathing.
As you move your legs to one side, keep your opposite shoulder on the
ground.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, slowly lift your joined knees back to the
starting position (see Figure 9-7a).
Sculpt your belly in and up as you lift. By contracting your abdominal
muscles and keeping them engaged, you give support to your legs.
151
Chapter 9: Taking It Easy: The Restorative Workout

If you experience discomfort in your lower back, do this exercise without the
ankle weights.
Do this exercise six to eight times on each side of your body, pause to rest,
and then do another six to eight repetitions on each side of your body.
The Plow
A farming plow has only one or two specific uses . . . you plow the ground
and plant your seeds. The yoga-with-weights Plow, however, serves many
functions for your body. It loosens your lower back, extends your legs,
releases your hamstrings, and exercises your abdominal muscles. You’ll feel
your spine and lower back stretching in this exercise. The Plow also reverses
the blood flow in your legs, which is good for circulation and reducing bloat-
ing and water retention in your ankles.
Strap on your ankle weights and grab both hand weights for this exercise and
follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your legs raised straight, your feet and knees
above your hips, and your hands at your sides holding the hand
weights, palms turned downward (see Figure 9-8a).

Part III: Refining Your Technique 

This is the starting position.
Make sure your feet are yoga feet — they should be flexed and engaged,
and you should be pressing into all four corners of each foot. At all times
during this exercise, make sure your abdominal muscles, which help
support your legs, are engaged.
2. Exhaling to a count of four and keeping your legs straight, slowly lift
your buttocks off the floor, and extend your legs so that your feet are
above your head, not your hips (see Figure 9-8b).
The hand weights act as anchors so you can stretch your back. Feel a
gentle squeeze and lift in your buttocks.
If you can’t extend your legs above your head, move them as far as you
comfortably can. If you can’t straighten your legs, do this exercise with
your knees bent.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, return to the starting position (see Fig-
ure 9-8a).
Don’t bounce as you do this exercise; move your legs slowly and consciously
as you focus on your breathing.
Do this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest, and then do another six to
eight repetitions.

The Serenity
The Serenity is a relaxing pose designed to transition you from the
Restorative Workout to the rest of your day. You should understand that
gravity is your friend and feel the heaviness of your body resting. The natural
force is removing the fatigue from your body. Feel the waters of your mind
coming to a standstill — try imagining that you’re a sun-warmed rock in the
middle of a rushing stream.
You need a single ankle weight for this exercise. When you’re ready, follow
these steps:
1. Lie on your back with the ankle weight resting across your abdomen
and your arms in a T position, palms facing upward (see Figure 9-9).
This is the starting (and ending) position. Make sure your legs are
straight.
2. Using Abdominal Breaths, slowly inhale to four counts.
Feel the gentle rounding and fullness of your belly as you breathe in
deeply. (For more on Abdominal Breaths, refer to Chapter 4.)
3. Slowly exhale to six counts.
As you exhale, feel your belly deflating toward the floor.
Relax throughout this exercise. Feel your body unwind and loosen up.
The Serenity calls for six to eight abdominal breaths.

Ending Meditation
Before you say goodbye to the Restorative Workout and go back to riding
rodeo bulls or whatever you plan to do next, engage in a moment or two of
silent meditation. Meditation helps you integrate the work you’ve just done
into your body; it gives your body a chance to feel what it has just experi-
enced and absorb the benefits physically and mentally. Chapter 6 explains
several meditation techniques. Find a technique you enjoy and do it at the
end of this workout.

In This Chapter
 Loosening and then tightening your body and mind

K
eeping your body strong and your mind in-tune are the keys to well-
being. You have more energy. You’re more capable of doing physical
activities, and you can maintain your concentration longer. You can resist
stress better. You can withstand the daily pressures you have to labor under.
When you feel strong, you’re more confident. It’s much harder to rock the
boat emotionally, and the choices you make in your life are more consistent
with the quality of life you desire.
The exercises in this workout strengthen your muscles and provide you with a
greater sense of physical and mental stability. They give you a greater sense of
balance, which leads to an increase in confidence. By practicing these exer-
cises and focusing on your breathing, you can create a renewed sense of confi-
dence and strength within. We call this new strength stability — it’s a resource
that comes alive just when you need it. We encourage you to take the dive
with a big smile and find out what’s waiting for you on the other side.
The exercises in the Strengthening Workout are a little harder to do because
they’re designed to build strength. Don’t push yourself too hard in the begin-
ning. The first step takes you to the next, which takes you to the next, and so
on. All you have to do is stay in the moment with each exercise. You need to
work at your own level of ability. Take it slow and steady, maintaining your
rhythmic deep breathing throughout this workout. If an exercise doesn’t feel
right, simply skip over it and go to the next exercise. As you build your
strength, you’ll eventually be able to do all the exercises in the Strengthening
Workout with confidence and ease.

For the Strengthening Workout, you should take deep, slow Complete Breaths.
Chapter 4 explains the Complete Breath and other breathing techniques.
The Lightning Bolt
The Lightning Bolt is an energy pose that gives your body the get-up-and-go it
needs to continue the Strengthening Workout. It strengthens your legs; it
develops range of motion in your shoulders, hips, and pelvic girdle; and it
helps you develop balancing skills. Get ready to feel a surge of energy as you
do this exercise.
Pick up your hand weights and follow these steps:
1. Stand with your legs below your hips, holding the weights above your
head with your arms straight and the palms of your hands facing one
another (see Figure 10-1a).
This is the starting position.
2. Exhaling to a count of four, bend your knees and squat as you lower
the weights to the floor in front of you (see Figure 10-1b).
As you bring your arms down, keep them straight, and make sure your
hands remain facing each other when the weights reach the floor. Your
gaze should follow the movement of your body. Look down as you squat,
following the weights with your eyes. Draw your belly in and up and
your tailbone down as you squat for support.
Be careful not to lean too far forward with your knees; sit down into the
squatting position.
Squat halfway if you’re not ready to go all the way down. If you feel any
stiffness in your shoulders, you can take your arms only halfway down
as well.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, push through your feet and rise to the
starting position (see Figure 10-1a).
Rise slowly and make sure your palms continue to face one another.
Concentrate on pushing the ground away from your body, and look up
with the weights as you rise.
Be patient. Don’t “fall down” as you squat or “jump up” when you rise.
Control the rise and fall of the weights, and focus on your breathing.
Do this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest, and then do another six to
eight repetitions.

The Crescent Moon
The Crescent Moon is a lunging exercise that requires balance and concentra-
tion. It works your buttocks, thighs, hips, and quads. The exercise can be dif-
ficult at first because it requires concentration and muscle strength, but stick
with it — you’ll improve over time.
Grab your hand weights and follow these steps:
1. Stand with your feet below your hips, your toes pointing forward, and
the weights hanging at your sides with your palms facing inward.
2. Step back onto the ball of your right foot, keeping your legs straight
and the hand weights at your sides (see Figure 10-2a).
This is the starting position. Your shoulders should be squared, and you
should gaze straight ahead. Make sure you’re resting on the ball of your
right foot with your heel raised.

3. Exhaling to a count of four, gently dip down, bending your left knee to
a 90-degree angle and bringing your right knee close to the floor (see
Figure 10-2b).
Draw your belly in and up and your tailbone down for support and sta-
bility. Let the pull of the hand weights guide your downward motion.
Stay on the ball of your back foot, and support your weight on all four corners
of your front foot. Don’t let your front knee roll forward of your ankle when
you dip down.
Don’t worry if you can dip down only a few inches. Just make sure you con-
centrate on drawing your belly in and up and your tailbone down.
4. Inhaling to a count of four, rise to the starting position (see Figure
10-2a).
Keep your hips as square as possible as you rise to the rhythm of your
breathing.
To give yourself an even better workout, bend your elbows at your sides in
the starting position and push the hand weights upward from your shoulders
as you dip.
Do this exercise six to eight times on each leg, pause to rest, and then do it
another six to eight times on each leg.

The Dog to Plank
The Dog to Plank appears in more than one workout in this book (see Chap-
ter 8) because it’s such a superb, powerful exercise. You could say that it’s
one of the most strengthening of the strengthening exercises. The exercise
sculpts and tones your entire upper body, offers aerobic benefits, and helps
you develop the ability to concentrate. Don’t give up on this exercise; if you
train your mind to do it, your body will follow.
Fasten your ankle weights and follow these steps (if the steps prove too
tough at first, you don’t have to use the ankle weights):
1. Begin on all fours with your hands directly below your shoulders,
your knees directly underneath your hips, and your toes planted on
the ground.
Spread your fingers wide for support.
2. Move into the downward-facing dog position by lifting your hips and
buttocks as you straighten your legs, bring your thighs back, and
move your heels toward the floor (see Figure 10-3a).
Your ears should be between your arms. Draw your belly in and up and
your tailbone down for support.
3. As you inhale to a count of four, lift your right leg up as high as you
can without twisting your hip open (see Figure 10-3b).
This is the starting position. Push your leg straight back, and flex your
foot to keep it fully engaged — it shouldn’t be limp.
4. As you exhale to a count of four, bring the trunk of your body for-
ward so that your shoulders are over your wrists (see Figure 10-3c).
You’re in the plank position. Keep your lifted leg parallel to the floor if
you’re strong enough; otherwise, tap your toe on the floor. You should
feel your abdominal and arm muscles working.
Don’t bend your elbows; support your weight through your shoulders
and across your back without using your chest muscles.
5. As you inhale to a count of four, return to the starting position (see
Figure 10-3b).
Don’t lunge backward. Be patient, and move in rhythm with your 
breathing.
Do this exercise six to eight times with each leg, pause to rest, and then do it
another six to eight times with each leg.

The Side Plank
The Side Plank is an unusual yoga-with-weights exercise in that you work only
one side of your body at a time, which presents new challenges for balancing.
The exercise opens up your shoulder girdle and strengthens your trunk,
shoulders, hips, and pelvis. Much like the Dog to Plank — the previous exer-
cise in this workout — the Side Plank can be a grueling exercise. But like the
Dog to Plank, it offers enormous benefits for your mind and body.
You need both ankle weights and one hand weight for this exercise. When
you’re ready, follow these steps:

1. Sit on your right hip, and cross your left foot over your right leg, plac-
ing your left heel next to your right thigh.
Hold the hand weight in your left hand, with your palm facing your body.
2. Straighten your right arm, pressing onto your right hand as you lift
your hip from the floor (see Figure 10-4a).
This is the starting position. Press into the foot of your left leg as you lift
to help with the burden. The hand weight should be dangling off the
ground, and you should be looking at the ground. Your whole body —
your shoulder and both legs, as well as your abdominal muscles — 
supports you here.
3. As you inhale to a count of four, pull the hand weight above your
shoulder as you bend your elbow, drawing your left shoulder blade
back and squeezing your shoulder blades together (see Figure 10-4b).
Make sure your wrist is above your shoulder. Rotate your gaze with the
weight as you open up your trunk.
4. As you exhale to a count of four, lower the weight to the starting posi-
tion (see Figure 10-4a).
Let the weight guide your arm to the floor; don’t throw it down. Follow
the weight with your eyes, and stay in tune with your breathing.

If you have trouble with this exercise, do it without the hand weight. You can
also support your body with your elbow and forearm rather than your hand.
Do this exercise four to eight times with each arm, pause to rest, and then do
another four to eight repetitions with each arm.
The Half Moon
The Half Moon is a pose of concentration and balance that fires the nerves of
your brain. The pose is as much about balance and stability as it is about
strength. It works every part of your legs and buttocks and also strengthens
your arms. The Half Moon will leave your body and mind fully invigorated.
Strap on your ankle weights and follow these steps:
1. Kneel on your left leg, put your right hand on your right hip, and sup-
port your upper body with your left arm; make sure your left wrist is
directly under your shoulder.
Put padding under your left knee if you need it.
2. Raise your right leg to the height of your hip, keeping it straight 
and extended outward, as you open your trunk to the right (see 
Figure 10-5a).
This is the starting position. Sculpt your belly in and up so that your
abdominal muscles help support you in this position. You should be
looking to your right.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, lower your right foot to the ground as you
turn your head to look down (see Figure 10-5b).
Keep your right foot flexed and engaged throughout this step.
You can lower your right leg halfway if bringing it to the floor is too 
difficult.
4. Inhaling to a count of four, raise your right leg and turn your head to
the starting position (see Figure 10-5a).
Move slowly while you concentrate on the rhythm of your breathing.
Do this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest, and then do another six to
eight repetitions.

The Swimmer
The Swimmer is a right brain–left brain, cross-shifting exercise. Because you
work opposite arms and legs, you develop coordination and balance skills.
The exercise works your arms, legs, lats (the muscles in your upper back),
and buttocks. The trunk of your body also gets a workout.
Strap on both ankle weights and grab one hand weight for this exercise.
When you’re ready, follow these steps:
1. Get on all fours with your wrists directly below your shoulders and
your knees directly under your hips.
After you get in this position, grab the hand weight with your left hand
and keep it on the ground, directly under your shoulder. Spread the fin-
gers of your right hand for support. Focus your gaze on the fingers of
your supporting hand.
You can roll up a mat or pillow and put it under your supporting hand if
you get tired too easily during this exercise. Elevating your hand distrib-
utes your weight more evenly across your entire body.

2. Extend your right leg straight back, and plant the ball and toes of your
right foot on the ground (see Figure 10-6a).
This is the starting position.
3. As you inhale to a count of four, raise your left arm and right leg
simultaneously to the height of your shoulders and hips (see Figure
10-6b).
Keep your eyes on the fingers of your supporting hand so you don’t
strain your neck.
4. As you exhale to a count of four, lower your left arm and right leg to
the starting position (see Figure 10-6a).
Be patient as you lower your arm and leg — don’t drop them to the floor.
The more times you do this exercise, the easier it will become to lift the
weights.
Alternating arms and legs, do this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest,
and then do another six to eight repetitions with each arm and leg.
The Rabbit
The Rabbit is a restorative pose, so we include it here to help you recharge
your batteries. This exercise reinvigorates your back and spine and massages
your internal organs.

Part III: Refining Your Technique 

Grab your ankle weights for this exercise and follow these steps:
1. Sit with your knees bent so your buttocks are resting on your heels,
and place the ankle weights on your thighs (see Figure 10-7a).
This is the starting position.
2. Make the trunk of your body as long as you can make it, and grasp
your heels with your hands.
3. Lower your trunk onto your thighs (see Figure 10-7b).
Tuck your chin gently to keep your airway open. Rest your forehead on
the floor if you can. Draw your belly in and up and your tailbone down
for support, and let your shoulders widen and stretch.
4. Feel your back stretching as you take four to eight long, slow breaths.
Focus on relaxing while your back stretches.
5. Raise your trunk to the starting position (see Figure 10-7a).
Try putting the ankle weights on your back to give yourself a better stretch.
You’ll need some help from a friend with this variation in order to lay the
weights across your back in a way that keeps them in place.

The Dolphin
The Dolphin is a weighted variation of a classic yoga pose. The version we
introduce is truly a full-body strengthener. The pose reverses the blood flow
in your legs, which is good for circulation and reducing bloating and water
retention in your ankles, and exercises your hamstrings, calves, and Achilles
tendons. The exercise is also a powerful upper-body builder because you
have to support your body with the muscles in your upper half.
Strap on your ankle weights and follow these steps:
1. Kneel with your elbows below your shoulders, your knees below your
hips, your forearms and hands flat on the floor in front of you, and
your toes curled onto the floor (see Figure 10-8a).
Spread your fingers wide for support.
Don’t let your elbows splay out beyond your shoulders. Doing so can
make your shoulders roll in, which can cause injury to your rotator cuff.
2. Press down into your forearms, hands, and the balls of your feet as
you lift your buttocks into the air (see Figure 10-8b).
This is the starting position. You should be looking back at your legs.
Your head shouldn’t touch the floor at any time; let it dangle between
your arms and elbows as you press your wrists and forearms downward.
Press your hands, wrists, and forearms into the floor for support.
Support your body with your shoulders as well as your arms and legs.
Feel your armpits lifting toward the ceiling and forward toward your
hands.
3. As you inhale to a count of four, extend your right leg directly behind
you so it forms a straight line with your torso (see Figure 10-8c).
If you feel too much stress on your shoulders, press into your hands,
wrists, and forearms to put more weight on those areas.
4. As you exhale to a count of four, slowly lower your leg to the starting
position (see Figure 10-8b).
Moving your leg slowly is important for your balance. Keep your hips
squared; don’t turn or wobble them as you lift and lower your leg.
Do this exercise six to eight times on each leg, pause to rest, and then do
another six to eight repetitions on each leg.
168
Part III: Refining Your Technique 

The Lift
Of all the strengthening exercises in this workout, the Lift concentrates the
most on strengthening the back of your body — the back of your arms, spine,
and legs. The Lift is also a concentration-coordination exercise that chal-
lenges your ability to control your body. The Lift squeezes and tones your
kidneys and works out the muscles of your abdomen.
You need both hand weights and both ankle weights for this exercise. When
you’re ready, follow these steps:
1. Lie flat on your belly with your forehead touching the floor and your
arms at your sides holding the hand weights, palms facing upward
(see Figure 10-9a).
This is the starting position. Shrug your shoulders slightly to move your
arm bones into the shoulder girdle. Draw your belly in and up and your
tailbone down for support.
2. As you inhale to a count of four, raise your chin, arms, and legs up
into the air as far as you comfortably can (see Figure 10-9b).
Feel your entire body working. Your abdominal muscles should bear
most of the weight of your body as your trunk supports you.

Chapter 10: Pumping You Up: The Strengthening Workout

If you aren’t yet strong enough to hold the hand weights in the air, do
this exercise without them. Remove the weights from your legs as well if
you have too much trouble lifting your legs.
3. As you exhale to a count of four, lower your lifted parts to the starting
position (see Figure 10-9a).
Concentrate on your breathing every step of the way as you raise and lower
your body. Be careful not to raise one leg higher than the other, and remem-
ber to engage your abdominal and other core muscles, which prevents your
back from being injured in this exercise.
Do this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest, and then do another six to
eight repetitions.
Ending Meditation
After you finish the Strengthening Workout, set aside a moment to engage in
meditation. A meditation session is like tying a bow on your workout — it sig-
nals the end of one activity and the beginning of the next. Meditation teaches
you to flow and function with a calm mind. Chapter 6 explains several medita-
tion techniques.

Releasing Your Athlete Within:
The Endurance Workout
In This Chapter
 Developing a sustained ability to focus and concentrate
 Building your body strength
 Fighting through fatigue to cleanse mind and body
W
hen most people think of endurance, they think about being able to go
beyond physical limitations or overcoming fatigue. This workout pro-
vides exercises and mindfulness practices to help you develop not only your
physical strength, but also your mental will to keep going when the going
gets tough. Each time you practice these exercises, you develop a little more
stamina to endure in a healthy, mindful way.
We believe that the ability to concentrate and focus is an essential part of
endurance, so we include exercises in this workout designed to help you con-
centrate and focus. Sometimes, endurance is simply a matter of putting aside
the large and small distractions so you can focus on the task at hand. Other
times, endurance is a matter of talking to yourself — of conducting an inner
dialogue so you can push ahead through the distractions. When you communi-
cate with yourself, you can remove the obstacles that may be standing in your
way. You can walk the forward path in life with an ease that will amaze you.
Using the mind and body techniques in Chapter 5 along with the exercises in
this chapter, you can develop the strength and endurance to go the extra
mile. You’ll discover how to access the power of concentration and inner
resilience to meet your mental and physical demands. Endurance training is
an opportunity to train your mind while strengthening your body.
Depending on your level of need and how hard you want to train, we recom-
mend doing the Endurance Workout twice a week. If you’re training for a
triathlon or other grueling sport, work out three times a week, and alternate
on other days with the Strengthening Workout we present in Chapter 10.

Use Ocean Breaths for the Endurance Workout (see Chapter 4) if you want a
powerful workout; if you’re a beginner, you may want to start with Complete
Breaths.
The Tree
The Tree is a variation of a classic yoga pose. Because it requires you to bal-
ance, it exercises your ability to concentrate. On the physical side, it
stretches the back of your spine and works your triceps. The Tree is a good
exercise for women because it works the sometimes-flabby muscles on the
back of the arms.
As you do this exercise, it helps to imagine that you’re a tree growing sturdy
roots in the earth. Focus your energy on your balance, and throughout the
exercise, draw your belly in and up and your tailbone down for balance and
support.
Grab one hand weight for this exercise and follow these steps:
1. Stand with your feet below your hips, your toes pointing forward,
your hands at your hips, andd the weight in your right hand, palm
facing inward.
Make sure your spine is erect. No slouching allowed!
2. Using your left hand for assistance, lift youur left foot and tuck it into
your right inner thigh (see Figure 11-1a).
If you can’t tuck your foot into your thigh, press it directly above or
below your knee, or place it on your right ankle. Imagine that you’re
attaching your foot to your leg, knee, or ankle by Velcro.
Press into all four corners of your right foot for stability.
3. Grab the weight with booth hands and move it above and then behind
your head while you continue to look forward (see Figure  11-1b).
This is the starting position. Bring your armpits back as far as you can;
feel them stretching.
4. Exhaling to a count of four, straighten your arms as you raise the
weight over your headd (see Figure 11-1c).
As best you can, keep your elbows beside your ears as you raise the
weight. Press your arms toward the ceiling; don’t swing them.
5. Inhaling to a count of four, bend your elbows back and lower the
weight behhind your head to the starting position (see Figure 11-1b).
Maintain your elbows’ positions beside your ears.
172
Part III: Refining Your Technique 

If you have trouble balancing, stand next to a wall and press the knee of your
bent leg into the wall. This way, you balance without fear of falling and focus
on your belly, spine, and arm action.
Repeat this exercise six to eight times on each leg, take a rest, and then do six
to eight more repetitions on each leg.
The Dancer
Dancing is a full-body activity that requires physical and mental prowess. The
yoga-with-weights Dancer is no different. This exercise helps you develop
focus and concentration as it strengthens your biceps, legs, and shoulder
girdle. It also allows for a greater range of motion in your shoulders. You’ll
feel uplifted and stretched like a dancer as you do this exercise.
Take your time with the Dancer. Think of it as a slow dance, not a salsa. If
you’re patient, you won’t lose your balance.
Grab one of your hand weights and follow these steps:
1. Stand with your feet below your hips, your toes pointing forward,
your arms hanging down at yoour sides, and your right hand holding
the weight, palm facing backward.
2. Bend your left knee, and rreach back for your left foot with your left
hand and grasp it (see Figure 11-2a).

Chapter 11: Releasing Your Athlete Within: The Endurance Workout

This is the starting position. Bend your right knee ever so slightly, and
make sure that all four corners of your right foot are firmly on the floor
for stability. To stay balanced, draw your belly in and up for support,
and keep your chest and trunk lifted.
If you can’t hold your foot, try holding your pants leg. You can also do
the exercise with a bent knee or in the standing position.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, lift the weight in front of your body and
then above your shouldeer, keeping your arm straight, as you extend
your lifted foot behind you (see Figure 11-2b).
Move your leg straight behind you; don’t lift it to the side like a dog at a
fire hydrant. Don’t hurl the weight; raise it gently in rhythm with your
breathing.
4. Exhaaling to a count of four, lower the weight to your side, and return
your lifted foot to the starting  position (see Figure 11-2a).
Make sure your arm stays straight as you lower the weight in rhythm
with your breathing.
Repeat this exercise six to eight times on your right leg, taking a short rest
between repetitions, and then do six to eight repetitions on your left leg.

The Eagle
The Eagle is an endurance challenge. Although the exercise works your biceps
and the muscles of your thighs and legs, it really challenges your mind and
ability to balance. The Eagle requires discipline, focus, and concentration.
You need both hand weights for this exercise. When you’re ready, follow
these steps:
1. Stand with your feet below your hips, your toes pointing forward, and
your arms hanging at youur sides, holding the weights with your palms
facing forward.
2. Sit downward slightly, and lift your  left leg and cross it over your
right thigh, calf, and ankle (see Figure 11-3a).
This is the starting position. You’re in the classic yoga eagle pose.
Challenging, isn’t it? Here are some tips to get into and stay in this pose:
• Pull your tailbone gently down toward the floor and slightly forward.
• Bend your right leg at the same time as you sit downward.
• Put one knee directly in front of the other, draping it over the top
of the supporting knee.
• Point your toes down and back toward the calf of your bent leg.
• Squeeze your inner thighs together.
Feel your spine gently stretching and lengthening. Make sure that you’re
looking straight ahead, your shoulders are squared, and your elbows are
slightly bent.
If you can’t get into this difficult pose, don’t wrap your leg all the way
around. Take your leg halfway around, or simply cross your legs. You
can also put your left toe down on the other side of your right foot. This
way, you can take the toe off the floor to check your balance without too
much effort.
3. Exhalingg to a count of four, bend your elbows and curl your arms to
lift the weights (see Figure 11-3b).
Feel your upper arms working. Keep your elbows against your body as
you raise the weights. Squeeze your thighs for support.
4. Inhaling to a count of four, lower your arms to the starting position
(see Figure 11-3a).
Make sure your elbows don’t stray from your body on the way down. Feel
the burn in your right thigh as you continue to squeeze it for support.
175
Chapter 11: Releasing Your Athlete Within: The Endurance Workout

Keep both your feet fully engaged throughout this exercise; be sure to press
through all four corners of each foot. Concentrating on your feet helps your
balance.
Repeat this exercise six to eight times on each leg, take a rest, and then do six
to eight more repetitions on each leg.
The Russian Dancer
The Russian Dancer is an exercise that helps build strength, stamina, and
endurance. It tones and conditions your legs and gently engages your pelvic
region. The exercise is relatively easy to do, but it gives you a good workout
and tests your endurance. You’ll feel like you danced up a storm all night long
after you finish!
You need both hand and ankle weights for this exercise. When you’re ready,
follow these steps:
1. Stand with your feet below your hips, your toes pointing forward, and
your arms dangling at youur sides, holding the hand weights with your
palms facing inward.
This is the starting position. Look straight ahead.

2. Inhaling to a count of four, lift your right knee to the height of your
hips (see Figure 11-4a).
Your knee should be bent at a 90-degree angle, with your foot below
your knee.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, press your right heel away from your
body and straighten your leg (seee Figure 11-4b).
Your supporting leg should be straight, but if you can’t keep it straight,
that’s okay. Let your knee bend gently in the beginning until you’re flexi-
ble and strong enough to keep it straight.
Flex your foot, and really push your leg out.
4. Inhaling to a count of four, return your right leg to the bent-knee posi-
tionn (see Figure 11-4a).
5. Exhaling to a count of four, lower your right leg to the starting posi-
tion  (see Step 1).
Alternating legs, repeat this exercise six to eight times with each leg, take a
rest, and then do six to eight more repetitions with each leg.

The Road Runner
The Road Runner starts you in the same position as a runner in the starting
blocks and works the same muscles as running does. What’s more, you get
the same feeling of exhilaration that a runner gets when crossing the finish
line in first place. This exercise works your hamstrings, legs, and belly mus-
cles and strengthens your entire upper torso. It also helps you develop
rhythm and coordination. You can test your endurance and find the strength
and focus to run that extra mile in any area of your life.
Be sure to breathe fully and rhythmically throughout this exercise. Feel the
air filling your lungs all the way to your collarbones.
Strap on both ankle weights and follow these steps:
1. Start on all fours with your shoulders directly over your wrists, your
hips directly over youur knees, and your toes and the balls of your feet
touching the ground.
Spread your fingers wide for support.
People who have elastic muscles sometimes turn their elbows out in this
posture, but this can be dangerous because it can damage your elbow
joints. Make sure the inside creases of your elbows face one another.
2. Pull your buttocks towarrd your feet and your knees toward your belly
(see Figure 11-5a).
This is the starting position. You’re squatting, except your knees are
deeply bent. Feel your belly touching your thighs.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, puush your body up with your left leg as
you lift your right leg toward the ceiling (see Figure 11-5b)..
Keep both legs straight, if you can. Don’t swing your back leg — press
both legs firmly as you would the brakes in a car to come to a full stop.
Look through your straightened arms at your left knee and shin.
You can remove the leg weights or wear lighter weights if lifting your leg
proves too difficult.
4. Inhaling to a count of four, lower your right leg and return both legs
to the starting positiion (see Figure 11-5a).
Look forward again as you squat.
Repeat this exercise six to eight times on each leg, take a rest, and then do six
to eight more repetitions on each leg.
178
Part III: Refining Your Technique 

The Side Bow
The Side Bow is an excellent exercise for people with unstable hips and
pelvises — especially women — because it loosens and relaxes the front of
your body, your hips, and your pelvis and stabilizes and strengthens those
areas as well. The exercise also stretches your spine and works your quadri-
ceps, buttocks, and abdominal muscles.
Strap on your ankle weights and follow these steps:
1. Lie on your right side with your legs extended, resting on your right
forearm for support.
2. Beend your left knee to a 45-degree angle, with your foot behind your
buttocks (see Figure 11-6a).
This is the starting position. Keep your hips squared; don’t shrug your
shoulders or let your upper shoulder roll forward. Make sure your right
hand stays on the floor for support.

3. Exhaling to a count of four, press your left foot away from your body
in a slow-motion donkey kickk (see Figure 11-6b).
Push backward as hard as you can with your thigh and hip, not your
knee. Feel your leg muscles working as you move.
If you have too much trouble pushing, try doing this exercise without
ankle weights.
4. Inhaling to a count of four, return to the starting position (see Fig-
urre 11-6a).
To get a good stretch when you’re finished with the exercise, reach back and
grasp the leg you just worked out with your hand. This stretches out your
back and the quadriceps muscles of your leg.
Repeat this exercise six to eight times with each leg, take a rest, and then do
six to eight more repetitions with each leg.

The Horse
The Horse is based on a traditional yoga pose called the cobra. It’s harder
than it looks; then again, so is riding a horse! The exercise works your but-
tocks and the muscles of your abdomen, as well as muscles you may not even
know about yet. It also massages your intestines and reproductive organs.
Strap on your ankle weights for the Horse and follow these steps:
1. Lie on your belly with your elbows bent and on the ground under
your shoulders and your hands ggrasping your arms right above the
elbows (see Figure 11-7a).
Look downward, and grasp your arms like Mr. Clean (baby boomers, at
least, will know who he is).
2. Round your shoulders, lift your bellly, round your back, and lower
your forehead onto the top of your arms (see Figure 11-7b).
This is the starting position. Push into the floor with your elbows.
You should draw your belly and tailbone down as you squeeze your 
perineum and buttocks. The perineum is the area between the anus and
vagina in women and the anus and testicles in men. As you pull your
belly in, feel the pose squeezing and massaging the organs behind your
belly. Squeeze and engage these interior muscles throughout this 
exercise.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, lift your right leg 6 inches off the floor 
(see Figure 11-7c).
In this position, you support some of your weight with your pubic bone.
Make sure you keep your right leg straight as you lift.
If you have trouble lifting your leg, tuck your belly in farther.
44. Exhaling to a count of four, lower your right leg to the starting posi-
tion (see Figure 11-7b).
Take slow, full breaths throughout the exercise. You can’t breathe deeply in
the position you’re in, but you can breathe consciously and mindfully.
You can do this exercise without the ankle weights and without lifting your
leg. You still benefit your back and chest, and the exercise helps you develop
a deeper and more rhythmic breathing pattern.
Do this exercise six to eight times with each leg, take a rest, and then do six
to eight more repetitions with each leg.
181

The Ball
The Ball is a squeeze-and-soak exercise (it massages your internal organs)
that tucks you deep into the core of your body, and in doing so exercises
many different muscles. The exercise tones and conditions your neck, legs,
and abdominal muscles, and you develop balance, coordination, rhythm, and
timing.

You need your ankle weights for this exercise. When you’re ready, follow
these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your head lifted, your knees bent and pulled
toward your nose, and your fiingers interlaced behind your knees 
(see Figure 11-8a).
This is the starting position. Look between your knees.
If you can’t interlace your fingers behind your knees, you can grasp the
back of a leg with each hand.
2. Inhaling to a count of four, simultaneoously straighten your legs, lift
them toward the ceiling, and lower your head to the floor (see Fig-
uure 11-8b).
Don’t shrug your shoulders or tense your neck. Remember to draw your
belly in; your belly muscles do some of the work of straightening and lift-
ing your legs. Make sure your hands stay in contact with your knees, but
don’t pull your legs with your hands and arms.
You can lift your legs halfway if you aren’t flexible enough to straighten
them.

3. Exhaling to a count of four, lower and bend your legs and lift your
head to return to the startingg position (see Figure 11-8a).
Be careful not to roll your body. Stay in control. Let your four-count
breathing guide you as you slowly lower your legs and return to the
starting position.
Repeat this exercise six to eight times, take a rest, and then do six to eight
more repetitions.
The Press
The Press is an exercise that borrows from weightlifting and from yoga. Your
arms get the same workout you get from a bench press (without all the grunt-
ing you hear in a gym), and you get the benefits of a yogic leg raise. The exer-
cise develops stamina and endurance, power, and strength; opens your groin;
and stretches your hamstrings.
Grab your hand weights and ankle weights to do the Press. When you’re
ready, follow these steps:
1. Holding the hand weights, lie on your back with your knees bent and
feet off the ground and youur elbows bent and to the side of your
shoulders (see Figure 11-9a).
This is the starting position. Raise your forearms above your shoulders,
and raise your legs above your hips. You look like an upside-down table.
The bottoms of your feet should be perpendicular to the ceiling.
2. Exhaling to a count of four,, simultaneously lift your head, hands, and
feet toward the ceiling (see Figure 11-9b).
Imagine that you’re pushing a heavy object away from your body with
your arms and legs. Engage your belly muscles as you lift.
3. Inhaling  to a count of four, return to the starting position (see Fig-
ure 11-9a).
Keep your shoulders squared. Don’t drop the weights; gently lower
them.
Repeat this exercise six to eight times, take a rest, and then do six to eight
more repetitions.
184
Part III: Refining Your Technique 

The Straddle
The Straddle can improve your health and physical performance whether
you like to walk around the block or enjoy mountain climbing. The exercise
loosens and expands the range of motion in your pelvis and legs, opens your
groin, and conditions and tones your back. The pose also builds abdominal
strength and works your biceps. The Straddle is tough, but stay with it. The
benefits it gives your groin help in both walking and climbing.
Throughout this exercise, don’t cave in or round your back or shoulders.
Doing so may strain your back.

Chapter 11: Releasing Your Athlete Within: The Endurance Workout

You need both hand weights and ankle weights for this exercise. After you’re
locked and loaded, follow these steps:
1. Sit on your buttocks with your legs spread apart and the ankle
weights resting on your inner thiighs (see Figure 11-10a).
Putting weights on your inner thighs helps anchor your hips. The hand
weights can rest on the floor behind you; don’t worry about them just
yet. The tips of your toes should be facing the ceiling.
If you happen to be flexible, you may be tempted to open your legs too
wide, but be careful. You can injure yourself during the weightlifting part
of this exercise if your legs are too far apart.
2. Roll the fleshy part of each buttock and thigh out from under you.
To do this, pull your belly in, lean to one side, reach around your hip,
grasp your buttock and inner thigh with your hand, and move the flesh
to the outside. Do this for each buttock. You should feel your “sit bones”
and your tailbone pressing down into the floor.
Draw your belly in and up and your tailbone down for support, and flex
and press into all four corners of your feet.
If you have discomfort in your back and you begin to slouch your shoul-
ders, your back muscles may not be ready for this exercise. Just move
your legs a little closer and find your natural seat. You can also tuck one
foot in or sit on a rolled-up mat or towel.
3. Pick up the hand weights and curl them so that your triceps are paral-
lel with your shoulders ((see Figure 11-10b).
This is the starting position.
4. Inhaling to a count of four, extend your arms to form a T position with
your  head and torso (see Figure 11-10c).
Align your shoulders over your hips. Your palms should be facing
upward.
5. Exhaling to a count of four, lift the weights back to the sttarting posi-
tion (see Figure 11-10b).
Repeat this exercise six to eight times, take a rest, and then do six to eight
more repetitions.

The Recharge
The Recharge helps you unwind and relax after the Endurance Workout. The
exercise should release the tension and fatigue in your forehead and brow.
The breathing portion of the exercise benefits your mind, body, and spirit.
Grab your ankle weights and follow these steps:
1. Sit with your legs crossed and your ankles beside your heels, and
place the ankle weights on yoour thighs.
Adding the weights helps sink your thighs into the floor.
2. Rub your palms together until they heat up.
Perhaps you’ve heard of “healing hands?” Well, you’ve got a pair of them
with you at all times. Use the warmth of your own two hands to heal.
3. Close your eyes, and gently cup your hhands over your eyes (see Fig-
ure 11-11).
The idea is to block out light without putting pressure on your eyes. Let
the warmth of your hands soften and release any tension in your fore-
head and brow. In traditional yoga, placing warm palms over the eyes is
called palming.
4. Take six to ten Complete Breaths.
A Complete Breath is a deep, relaxing breath. (For more on Complete
Breaths, see Chapter 4.)

Ending Meditation
After you finish the Endurance Workout, take a moment to engage in medita-
tion. Meditation isn’t about sitting still or forcing yourself to be quiet; it’s
about anchoring your consciousness into the present moment. You deepen
your relationship to your breath in a calm and steady way. The common aim
is to focus the scattered rays of your mind on a single point, like a laser 
beam of attention, in order to lead you to a state of self-realization. Chapter 6
describes several meditation techniques.

Iron Abs: The Belly-Burner
Workout
In This Chapter
 Strengthening the core muscles of your abdomen and back
 Shaping and toning your trunk
 Burning the fat from your belly
 Massaging and toning the organs of digestion and elimination
E
verybody wants strong abdominal muscles, because having strong abs
means having a flatter, trimmer stomach. Many people don’t know it, but
strong abdominal and back muscles are as important for your overall good
health as for your good looks. The abdominal center is the mother of all
movement because movement from this core area empowers all other move-
ment, including that of the head, legs, and arms. Strong abs support the
integrity of many muscle groups that are necessary for having a healthy back,
which makes strong abs necessary for good posture. Having a healthy back
and abs go hand in hand — like love and marriage or cookies and milk, you
can’t have one without the other.
In the Belly-Burner Workout, you notice immediately that the moves are initi-
ated from the abdominal core of your body, and you can tell right away how
strong or weak you are in this area. The exercises focus on the abdominal
core and help you carve out muscle tone and build stability. They also
improve circulation and massage and tone the organs of digestion and 
elimination.
If your goal is to shrink your belly area, you’ve come to the right place. If you
do them for 20 to 30 minutes every other day and eat less, the Belly-Burner
exercises will help immensely. This workout gets you juiced up and running
like a well-tuned and efficient energy-burning machine.
Throughout this workout, you should practice the Ocean Breath. Chapter 4
explains this and several other yoga breaths.

The Cow to Cat
The Cow to Cat (call it the Curl and Crunch if you like) works your abdominal
muscles much like a stomach crunch; it’s soothing to your neck and back; it
stretches and strengthens your spine; and it works your legs and buttocks.
Why the unusual name? Because in the first part of the exercise, you stretch
your chest and make it look like the big, broad face of a cow. In the second
part, when you round your back, you look like a Halloween cat.
Wear your ankle weights for this exercise. When you’re ready, follow these
steps:
1. Start on all fours with your knees directly under your hips and your
wrists directly under your shoulders.
Make sure your fingers are spread wide for support and balance. You
look like a table in this position.
2. Inhaling to a count of four, lower your belly down as you move your
back one vertebra at a time into a full stretch with your chin up (see
Figure 12-1a).
This is the cow position. Keep your hips parallel during this step (and
throughout this exercise).
3. Exhaling to a count of four, round your back and tuck in your chin as
you lift your right knee toward your chest (see Figure 12-1b).
This, the cat position, is the starting position. Look down into your navel
or at your knee.
Move your tailbone down and pull your belly in and up as you do this
portion of the exercise.
4. Inhaling to a count of four, lift your right leg directly behind you as
you raise your chin (see Figure 12-1c).
Spread your toes wide, and lift your leg to hip level. Imagine that you’re
pressing your foot into a wall. Don’t kick or swing your leg; move it
slowly to work the muscles of your buttocks. Keep your toes pointed
toward the ground if you can.
Feel your back arch as you do this part of the exercise.
5. Exhaling to a count of four, return to the starting position (see 
Figure 12-1b).
Be careful not to drop your head; lower it slowly into your chest.
Concentrate on your lungs emptying and your belly squeezing as you
exhale.
The stretching and contracting of your abdominal muscles helps you tone
and shape them.
192
Part III: Refining Your Technique 

Repeat this exercise six to eight times with each leg, take a rest, and then do
six to eight more repetitions with each leg.
The Flying Locust
The Flying Locust is a weighted variation of a classic yoga pose that allows
you to pretend you’re in flight. The exercise strengthens and tones the front
and back of your body. It also strengthens your shoulders, arms, chest, legs,
and buttocks. You support your body weight with your abdominal muscles in
the process, which is why it works as a big-time belly buster.
The Flying Locust is a difficult exercise. To do it right, you need to pay atten-
tion each moment during the exercise. If any part of your back feels uncom-
fortable, you can do this exercise with light hand weights or with no weights
at all until you get strong enough.

Chapter 12: Iron Abs: The Belly-Burner Workout

You need both ankle and hand weights for this exercise. When you’re ready,
follow these steps:
1. Lie flat on your belly with your forehead touching the floor, your
arms spread in a T position, and your hands holding the hand weights
palms-down (see Figure 12-2a).
This is the starting position.
2. Inhaling to a count of four, lift your arms, your legs, and your chin
straight up off the ground (see Figure 12-2b).
Without jerking your body or throwing your head back, try to lift up at
the same rate and to the same height. As you do this, notice your shoul-
ders moving away from your ears and your shoulder blades moving
toward each other. Pull your belly in and up and your tailbone down as
you lift. Keep your legs directly behind you.
You should feel your abdominal muscles tighten in this position. The
weight of your body is falling on these muscles, and they must stay
engaged to support your body.
It helps to imagine that someone is pressing on the back of your head
and that you have to hold your head up. Lifting your head properly
helps get your shoulders and arms up.

Part III: Refining Your Technique 

3. Exhaling to a count of four, slowly lower your arms, legs, and chin to
the starting position (see Figure 12-2a).
Don’t drop your limbs; lower them in time to your breathing.
If you try the Flying Locust and have trouble lifting the weights from the 
T position, try keeping your hands alongside your hips without the weights.
Repeat this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest, and then do six to eight
more repetitions.
The Locust
The Locust offers many of the same benefits as the Flying Locust (see the
previous exercise in this workout). It develops your shoulders, chest, arms,
legs, back, buttocks, and abdominal muscles. Instead of working all four
limbs at the same time, however, you work only two — an opposite arm and
leg. For this reason, the Locust develops cross-coordination and fires the
nerve pathways of your brain.
If the Locust proves too difficult at first, use lighter weights, or do the exercise
without weights until you develop your strength.
Pick up one hand weight and strap on both ankle weights for this exercise.
When you’re ready, follow these steps:
1. Lie flat on your belly with your forehead resting on your right fore-
arm and your left arm extended vertically, holding the hand weight
palm-down (see Figure 12-3a).
This, the starting position, is sometimes called the skydiving position.
Draw your belly in and up and your tailbone down for support.
2. Inhaling to a count of four, lift your right leg, your left arm, and your
shoulders and head (see Figure 12-3b).
In other words, lift your opposite arm and leg as you lift from the shoul-
ders up. Rise to a position that works your muscles but doesn’t strain
them. Gently but firmly press down on your forearm to help lift your
head and shoulders.
You can keep your head down in a neutral position or lift your head
when you lift your arm and leg; the choice is yours. If you want to lift
your head, keep your ear in proximity to the lifting arm, and be careful
not to toss your head — lift it slowly.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, lower your arm, leg, shoulders, and head
to the starting position (see Figure 12-3a).
195
Chapter 12: Iron Abs: The Belly-Burner Workout

Feel the strain in your abdominal muscles as you slowly work your opposite
limbs.
Repeat this exercise six to eight times with each arm-leg combination, pause
to rest, and then do six to eight more repetitions with each arm-leg combo.
The Love Handler
As its name implies, the Love Handler is designed to shrink the size of your
love handles — the excess weight around your waistline. Many people accu-
mulate fat in this area as a result of stress. This gentle, side-bending exercise
stretches and tones your obliques and the rectus abdominis — Latin for “love
handles.” The exercise not only works the aforementioned Latin muscles, but
also helps to relieve stress when you stretch and breathe deeply.
You need one hand weight and both ankle weights for this exercise. When
you’re ready, follow these steps:
1. Sit on your buttocks with your right leg extended, your left hand
gently pressing down into the floor, your left foot tucked next to your
right thigh, and the hand weight held at hip position in your right
hand (see Figure 12-4a).

Part III: Refining Your Technique 

This is the starting position — a position similar to that of a hurdler. Try
to sit deep into your buttock on the bent-knee side to anchor you and
enable you to stretch farther. The ankle weights act as anchors for your
body during the exercise.
Make sure your spine is erect, your belly is tucked in, and your tailbone
is pointing down. Look straight ahead, with your chin neither raised nor
lowered.
2. Inhaling to a count of four, arc the hand weight over your body as you
turn your head to the left and look down toward your fingertips (see
Figure 12-4b).
As you do this, lean to the left. Don’t throw the weight — lift it carefully.
As you lift, rotate the weight in your hand. Feel the right side of your
body — especially your love handle — stretching. Use your left hand for
support as you look over your left shoulder.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, return the hand weight and your body to
the starting position (see Figure 12-4a).
Feel the muscle on the side of your body draw you back to the starting
position.
This is a terrific lateral — that is, side-bending — stretch. Be careful not to
lean forward or feel as if you’re falling backward during this exercise. If you
do, you’ll lose the benefits of stretching your love handles.
Repeat this exercise six to eight times on each side of your body, take a rest,
and then do six to eight more repetitions on each side.

Chapter 12: Iron Abs: The Belly-Burner Workout

The Staff
The Staff is a weighted version of the traditional yoga pose of uprightness.
The exercise builds a strong spine and back. The weights appear to exercise
the muscles of your back and shoulders, which they do, but the main object
of the Staff is to exercise your abdominal muscles. A secondary benefit is the
work you do on your quads and hamstrings.
Don’t collapse your spine as you do this exercise (in other words, don’t
slump). If you don’t keep your spine erect and your elbows square, you won’t
work your abdominal muscles.
You need both hand weights and ankle weights for this exercise. When you’re
ready, follow these steps:
1. Sit on your buttocks with your legs straight in front of you, and roll
the fleshy part of each buttock and thigh out from under your body.
Pull your belly in, lean to one side, reach around your hip, grasp your but-
tock and inner thigh with your hand, and move the flesh to the outside.
Do this for each buttock. After you finish, you’ll feel as if your “sit bones”
are rooted downward a little bit more toward the floor. You’ll also be able
to draw your belly in and work your abdominal muscles more deeply.
2. Grab the hand weights and bend your arms, holding the weights at
ear level with your palms facing forward (see Figure 12-5a).
This is the starting position. Don’t shrug your shoulders; look straight
ahead throughout the exercise.
If sitting upright while holding the weights is too uncomfortable for you,
try placing a rolled-up blanket under your buttocks to encourage your
pelvis to release. This way, you feel the natural curve of your lumbar
spine again, which helps you sit up taller and straighter. You can also
bend your knees.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, lift the weights straight up so your arms
are extended (see Figure 12-5b).
This action is what weightlifters call an overhead press. Engage your feet,
flexing into all four corners to encourage you to tighten your abdominal
muscles.
4. Exhaling to a count of four, lower your arms to the starting position
(see Figure 12-5a).
Feel your shoulder blades pulling down in rhythm to your breathing. As
you slowly lower the weights, feel yourself working against the weight
for resistance. This action is what weightlifters call a back lat pulldown.
Focus on your belly as you lift and lower the weights; your belly muscles sup-
port your back and spine.
198
Part III: Refining Your Technique 

Repeat this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest, and then do six to eight
more repetitions.
The Burning Boat
The Burning Boat really works the muscles of your belly, like rowing without
paddles. Because you exercise with only your buttocks touching the ground,
you make your muscles burn and you build endurance and stamina. In the
yogic system, fire represents purification, change, and renewal. Be sure to
use Ocean Breaths (see Chapter 4) in this workout because they oxygenate
the fire and really heat things up.
You need both hand weights and ankle weights for this exercise. When you’re
ready, follow these steps.
1. Sit on your buttocks with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor,
and hold the weights in your hands with your palms facing forward
(see Figure 12-6a).
Pull your belly in, and lift your spine.
2. Lean back slightly, lift your feet from the floor, and tuck your knees
into your chest (see Figure 12-6b).
This is the starting position. Concentrate on finding a point of balance.
If you have a lower back injury, lift one leg at a time rather than both
legs. If you still feel uncomfortable, move on to the next exercise.

If your abdominal muscles are strong enough, you can try doing this
exercise with your legs straight, not bent.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, lift the hand weights to perform a bicep
curl (see Figure 12-6c).
Keep your shoulders squared to place the work directly on your bicep
muscles.
Be careful not to drop the weights. Let the rhythm of your breathing
guide your motion.

4. Inhaling to a count of four, lower the hand weights to the starting
position (see Figure 12-6b).
Don’t hold your breath during this exercise. Focus on your breathing, and try
to relax (yeah, right!).
If doing this exercise with weights is too difficult at first, try it without the
weights or with light weights until you become strong enough.
Repeat this exercise six to eight times, take a rest, and then do six to eight
more repetitions.
The Archer
The aim of the Archer is to work the lower abdominal muscles that often get
ignored in traditional upper-ab building sit-ups. Imagine you’re squeezing —
really squeezing — the juice from an orange in your lower belly as you do
this exercise.
You need only your ankle weights for the Archer. Lock, load, and follow these
steps:
1. Lie on your back with your right leg extended, your left leg bent
toward your chest, and your fingers interlaced about 2 inches below
your left knee (see Figure 12-7a).
This is the starting position. Keep your arms straight, and press your
knee into your hands.
2. Exhaling to a count of four, lift your head and right leg off the ground
as you continue to hold your left knee (see Figure 12-7b).
Lift with your lower belly muscles; don’t pull on your knee or leg to lift
your body. Press your knee powerfully into your hands as you feel your
lower abdominal muscles and back working. See how going from a
fully relaxed to a fully flexed position really challenges your abdominal
muscles.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, lower your head and right leg to return to
the starting position (see Figure 12-7a).
Keep your feet engaged throughout this exercise to help you work your
abdominal muscles. By focusing on your breathing, you can do this exercise
slowly and consciously without tugging on your leg or jerking your back.
Repeat this exercise six to eight times with each leg, take a rest, and then do
six to eight more repetitions with each leg.

Chapter 12: Iron Abs: The Belly-Burner Workout

The Pearl
The Pearl works your abdominal muscles and stretches out your spine while
making your legs and arms stronger. You have to concentrate and stay in the
moment to perfect this exercise, which strengthens your mind as well as the
muscles of your body. The Pearl is also a squeeze-and-soak exercise that mas-
sages your intestines and other internal organs. You start by opening up like
an oyster, and then you pull tight like a pearl; the treasure is within you!
You need both hand and ankle weights for this exercise. When you’re ready,
follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your arms extended above your head, your
palms facing upward while holding the hand weights, and your legs
straight (see Figure 12-8a).
This is the starting position.
2. Exhaling to a count of four, slowly move your arms toward the ceiling
and back down toward your sides in a half-circle while you bend your
knees into your chest and lift your forehead toward your knees (see
Figure 12-8b).

Part III: Refining Your Technique 

Curl your back one vertebra at a time so your head and neck lift last.
Feel your belly squeezing and burning.
Your arms should be in a position beside your hips a few inches above
the floor as you pull them forward like a round pearl.
Instead of raising your legs to your chest from an extended position, you can
try this exercise with bent knees and your feet on the floor. It still poses a
challenge, but because you don’t lift as much body weight, it isn’t as hard.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, slowly return to the starting position (see
Figure 12-8a).
Feel your abdominal muscles working and burning as you uncrunch.
Controlled action is the key to success in this exercise. Move slowly and 
consciously — especially when you lower your arms behind your head.
Repeat this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest, and then do six to eight
more repetitions.

The Belly Crunch
The Belly Crunch does exactly what it says — it crunches your abdominal
muscles in a very big yoga-with-weights way. This exercise works your waist-
line as well as your deep abdominal muscles. The crossover action in this
exercise helps to strengthen and tone your back and waistline even more. As
long as you perform the movements slowly without throwing your body,
you’ll really feel your abdominal muscles working. Crunch that belly a few
times and watch it start to flatten out as your waistline takes shape.
If you have a neck injury, don’t attempt this exercise. It may place too much
strain on your neck, a major contributor of support for your body in this
exercise. (In Chapter 14, you find some great exercises and suggestions for
strengthening your back and neck.)
Grab your hand weights and strap on your ankle weights for this exercise.
When you’re ready, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your knees tucked into your chest and your
bent elbows in the scarecrow position (see Figure 12-9a).
This is the starting position.
In the scarecrow position, you stretch your arms out wide at shoulder
level and bend your elbows at 90-degree angles. Make sure an equal dis-
tance lies between your hands and head and your elbows and shoulders.
2. Exhaling to a count of four, lift your head, touch your left elbow to
your right knee, and extend your left leg into the air (see Figure 12-9b).
Keep your abdominals engaged at all times, and press through your feet
to feel stronger in your belly muscles.
If lifting your head is too much trouble or your neck gets too tired, keep your
head on the floor. You can also do this exercise without ankle or hand
weights.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, bring your left leg back into your chest,
cross your right elbow to your left knee, and extend your right leg
into the air.
Don’t bring your head down as you do this.
4. Exhaling to a count of four, tuck both knees back into your chest and
lie back into the starting position (see Figure 12-9a).
Draw your belly down and in as you lift, and twist the trunk of your body as
you touch your elbows to your knees. As you twist, imagine that you’re
wringing out a dishrag. And remember to keep moving between legs. Although
this is a slow and controlled exercise, your momentum will carry you along.
204
Part III: Refining Your Technique 

Do this exercise six to eight times with each leg and elbow combination,
pause to rest, and then do another six to eight repetitions with each leg and
elbow combo.
The Belly Dancer
You deserve a relaxing exercise if you’ve come this far. Although belly danc-
ing doesn’t sound relaxing, the Belly Dancer gives you an opportunity to
loosen up and have some fun. The exercise strengthens your pelvic girdle as
it loosens and removes the tension from your spine. This relaxing and sooth-
ing exercise closes out your Belly-Burner Workout, setting you up for a belly
full of laughter.
You need one ankle weight and both hand weights for this exercise. When
you’re ready, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent, your feet on the floor, the
ankle weight placed on your belly, and your arms at your sides, hold-
ing the hand weights palms-down.
This is the starting position. The added weight on your belly brings your
attention to this area of your body.

2. Lift your buttocks 4 to 6 inches from the floor as you tilt your tailbone
toward your navel (see Figure 12-10).
Sculpt your belly in and up.
3. Gently sway your hips like a pendulum from side to side.
Feel your spine lengthening and stretching as you make this soothing,
rocking motion. Don’t lift your hips any higher than you already have.
4. Continue swaying your hips until you release the tension from your
body.
For fun at the end of the exercise, do a few figure-eight patterns in each direction,
and then shimmy and wiggle for ten seconds to a minute. Enjoy the natural dance
and rhythm of your movement!
Ending Meditation
Before you leave the Belly-Burner Workout behind, we encourage you to take
a moment to engage in meditation. You can quietly collect yourself and get
ready for the next activity you want to do. Look to Chapter 6 to find a medita-
tion technique that you enjoy.

In this part . . .
O
ne of the great things about exercise and leading 
a healthy lifestyle is that it’s all about you. You can
personalize your lifestyle to fit your needs. Part IV is 
for people who want to make the yoga-with-weights exer-
cise program their own. You can take the workouts from
the previous parts of this book and fashion a workout 
tailored just for you.
We start with some dietary advice. Like all dynamic forms
of exercise, yoga-with-weights workouts are more benefi-
cial when you’re on a healthy diet. Everyday life places
demands on your body, and to meet those demands, you
need the right fuel. When you’re finished eating, we show
you how to address aches and pains in different parts of
your body with different yoga-with-weights exercises. We
also show you how to tone and strengthen different parts
of your body with yoga with weights.

 Tuning in to your body’s dietary signals

 Fueling your body with healthy and helpful foods
 Pairing good eating habits with your exercise plan
F
or many years, Sherri’s family ran health centers in San Francisco. One
very popular center had a health-food store on the bottom floor; the
upper floors were reserved for a gym, a yoga room, and a dance studio. Over
the years, Sherri noticed that many of the visitors to the center either went to
the top floors for yoga, bodybuilding, dance, or other forms of exercise or 
to the bottom floor to purchase health foods or to eat in the health-food
restaurant. Not everyone visited both places, but the people who did really
looked great. They radiated good health. The observations reinforced for
Sherri that exercise and nutrition go hand in hand.
Doing yoga-with-weights exercises inspires you to want to feel your best and
to tune in to your body’s needs. Before you put anything in your mouth, you
pause to make sure that it’s really worth eating. Your energy and increased
mental clarity feel good as a result of yoga with weights, and you don’t want
to lose that. As with any dynamic form of exercising, yoga with weights
places demands on your body. To meet those demands, you need to put the
right fuel into your body. You need to eat foods that give you the energy for
exercising and building strong muscle and bone. You don’t attempt to power
a car with water. Similarly, you can’t power your body — you can’t get the
energy you need to exercise — without eating the right foods.
This chapter isn’t a diet book in miniature. It doesn’t tell you what to eat and
what not to eat. It does, however, offer basic and simple suggestions to help
you find good health and to help you get the energy you need to do yoga-
with-weights workouts.

Listening to the Wisdom of Your Body
One of the keys to improving your diet is to be aware of what your body tells
you to eat. You were born with an inner awareness that steers you to foods
that make you feel your best. Try to tap into this awareness. What you eat
and how you take care of yourself influence your energy level, your mood,
your frame of mind, and your temperament. Ask yourself these questions:
“What did I eat for my last meal? Have I had a snack recently? How do I feel
right now? Am I thirsty?” What you consume contributes to how you feel
right now.
As the saying goes, you are what you eat. Everyone understands that drugs
and medicines have direct effects on the body, but few people stop to con-
sider what effect foods have. Eating sugary foods, for example, gives most
people an energy rush. These foods cause your blood-sugar (or glucose) level
to spike for a short period of time, which feels good. You feel like you have
more energy, and you may even feel happier for a little while. But then you
experience a rapid drop in blood-sugar that leaves you feeling drained of
energy. Being aware of your body’s responses to different foods can direct
you to foods that bring energy, health, and vitality.
Think of the food you eat as medicine — it provides vitamins and minerals
that are essential not only for good health, but also for strong muscles and a
sound mind.
No two people are the same, which is why we don’t recommend the same
diet for everyone. Writes Dr. Elson Haas, author of The New Detox Diet Book:
Staying Healthy with Nutrition (Celestial Arts) and Vitamins For Dummies
(Wiley), “Our diet, or best eating program, is an individual exploration and
there is no one right diet for everyone. Our heritage, seasonal and local envi-
ronment, activity level, digestion and health state all influence what makes up
our best diet. That’s why the personal attunement process is so crucial.”
To eat nutritiously, you don’t have to follow a strict diet like it’s the letter of
the law or even follow someone else’s rules about what constitutes a good
diet. You can follow what we like to call the 85–15 percent principal: Eat at
least 85 percent of the time from the group of healthy whole and organic
foods; the other 15 percent of your diet is for the occasional splurge or treat,
a big dinner party, or a grand fiesta. Having a base of good, wholesome foods
gives your body the foundation it needs to be healthy enough to deal with
the occasional treat or splurge.
Starting an exercise program and changing your diet all at once can seem like
an overwhelming proposition. If you’re unsure how to change your diet, and
you don’t know where to start, we encourage you to seek help. Consult a cre-
dentialed expert in nutrition. Find out from an expert what diet is best for
you. Get help in tracking your responses to different kinds of food and differ-
ent food groups.

Improving Your Diet through 
Yoga with Weights
When you do yoga-with-weights exercises, you explore your body. You dis-
cover how to relax certain muscles and flex others; you retrace the pathways
of your nerves and find out how different muscle groups work in consort
when you balance; you feel your breath bring life-giving oxygen to your body;
and you discover many new feelings and sensations.
It may seem far-fetched, but yoga with weights, an exercise program, can
actually improve your diet. If the yoga-with-weights program has one theme,
it’s this: Listen to your body so you hear what it’s trying to tell you. Yoga with
weights helps you get in touch with your body. You gain not only an aware-
ness of how your body reacts to the movements you make with the weights,
but also calm and inner composure, which can be helpful in preventing ner-
vous eating. You no longer experience the unnatural hunger spasms caused
by anxiety because your thoughts are more in tune with the health needs of
your body.
We encourage you to understand where your stress or fatigue comes from
and how it affects your eating. If your exercise goal is to lose weight, you can
lose it without having to count calories or measure food portions. You lose it
because losing weight isn’t an objective in and of itself; it’s a side effect of the
feeling of well-being, the increased movement, and the exercise you get from
practicing yoga with weights.
If you concentrate on the principles of yoga with weights and adhere to your
goals, when you’re hungry and you need to eat more, you’ll make better
choices about what to eat. It may take some time, but eventually you’ll begin
to select from foods that give you the energy to do the exercises without the
excess calories. You’ll notice a lighter feeling overall because your body
doesn’t have to work as hard to digest food or recover from having eaten
processed, fat-laden, unnatural food. You’ll have the firsthand experience and
the confidence in yourself to know when you can eat with abundance from
the right sources. Your yoga-with-weights self-awareness training can help
guide you to the right foods.
Following Guidelines for Healthy Eating
We encourage you to eat a healthy diet of fresh foods, fruits, vegetables, pro-
tein, whole grains, and some dairy products (if you tolerate them well).
These foods provide energy, and your body can absorb and make use of them
easily. In some quarters, this natural way of eating is known as the whole-food
diet. Discover how good you can feel from eating fresh and healthy foods in
their more natural, whole-food state.
211
Chapter 13: Eating to Enhance Your Yoga-with-Weights Workout

Food is the guardian of your health and the source of energy in your daily life.
Some of the foods we discuss in this chapter aren’t a part of most diets, but
most people haven’t taken up the beneficial yoga-with-weights lifestyle that
you have. These foods are powerful, simple, and effective in supporting good
health.
Discovering the value of whole foods
Whole foods are natural foods that come to us as nature made them. They
haven’t been altered by chemical processes, and they don’t have preserva-
tives or additives that prolong their shelf lives or make them taste better.
These foods often contain more vitamins, minerals, fiber, complex carbohy-
drates, and essential fatty acids than processed foods.
How do you tell whole foods from other foods? Generally speaking, whole
foods come to you as nature made them. For example, raw and steamed veg-
etables and fresh fruits are whole foods. Whole wheat, whole grains (brown
rice, kasha, millet, and so on), nuts, seeds, legumes (lentils, peas, beans),
eggs, fish, lean meats, poultry, and unrefined oils are other examples. Refined
foods that you want to steer clear of include white sugar, white rice, and
white flour. Often, you’re still hungry after you eat refined food. You crave
food sooner because you haven’t been properly nourished, so you eat more.
That means bad news for your yoga-with-weights workout. Bye-bye motiva-
tion and energy, hello couch and nap.
Often, but not exclusively, whole foods are grown by using organic or sustain-
able-farming methods. In a way, they’re a step back to the good old days,
when people grew their own food and harvested on their own. They ate foods
local to their areas and the places where they were born. People used to limit
their diets to foods that were in season. They ate fresh food because they
had to — they had no refrigerators.
Whole foods are pure and unrefined. They have a higher nutritional density,
and they present nutrients to your body in such a way that your body can
recognize them, absorb them, and take full advantage of their nutritional
power by supplying you with the energy you need to do your yoga-with-
weights workouts. When you eat whole foods and include plenty of fresh
fruits and vegetables as the basis of your diet, you don’t have to eat as much
to get the vitamins and minerals you need.
A great place to find whole foods is your local farmer’s market. Lucky for you,
farmer’s markets are popping up everywhere in cities and towns. These mar-
kets provide wonderful fresh and seasonal foods that, for the most part, are
grown locally. Farmer’s markets often have live music to shop by and plenty
of people worth watching. You can have a feast for your eyes and palate.
212
Part IV: Personalizing Your Program 

Including dairy products in your diet
Dairy products, if you can tolerate them, are great sources of calcium —
which is necessary for strong bones and teeth — vitamin D, and protein.
Protein, especially, is good for yoga-with-weights practitioners because it’s a
great source of energy and it helps to maintain healthy muscle tissue.
Calcium also helps support healthy bone density.
When you consume milk, cheese, and yogurt, do so in moderation, or consume
the low-fat and nonfat varieties of dairy products. Many dairy products are high
in saturated fats, and saturated fat is a risk factor for heart disease; in women,
it may also be a risk factor in breast and ovarian cancer. Try to purchase eggs
(from free-range hens) that are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Studies show that
omega-3 fatty acids are helpful against high blood pressure and heart disease.
High-quality yogurt and kefir are helpful additions to your diet. These cul-
tured foods contain friendly bacteria — Lactobacillus acidophillus, Lactobacillus
bulgaricus, and others — that make it harder for unfriendly bacteria to live in
your gut. You can spot a high-quality yogurt because its label tells you that it
contains “live bacteria cultures.” Don’t be shy about eating goat and sheep’s
milk products; they’re rich in calcium and very good for your health.
Supplying your body with proteins
To build muscles for your yoga-with-weights workouts, you need protein and
the amino acids from which protein is made. Like bricks to a house, proteins
are your body’s basic building materials. Your body uses protein to build new
cells and tissue and to create hormones, enzymes, and antibodies. When you
eat protein, your body breaks it down into amino acids.
The best suppliers of protein are animal sources. Milk, eggs, chicken, beef,
and fish are called complete proteins because they supply all the essential
amino acids. Fruits and vegetables are called incomplete proteins because
they don’t supply all the essential amino acids.
Your protein needs are different from the person working out next to you in
the gym; some people even have trouble absorbing proteins. If your digestive
system can’t absorb protein, the undigested protein simply passes through
your digestive tract without being absorbed and used by your body. Protein
sources that are high in fiber, for example, are harder to digest. Make sure
you can absorb the protein from food and that the protein meal contains all
the essential amino acids.
How much protein is enough? How does a vegetarian combine foods to get
enough protein? How much is too much? Take subjects of concern up with a
physician or a qualified nutritionist. He or she can help you figure how much
protein you need, given your body’s needs and your lifestyle.

Chapter 13: Eating to Enhance Your Yoga-with-Weights Workout

Consuming healthy fats and 
essential fatty acids
“Fat” has become a bad word in American culture, but fats are nothing to be
afraid of. Some fats, in fact, are important for a healthy diet and are good for
you. Fat provides vitamins A, D, and E and plays an important role in the health
of your bones, skin, and hair. Fats are also important for mineral absorption.
Of course, not all fat is created equal. Some fats are better than others, but
generally they fall into these three categories:
 Saturated fat: You find these fats in animal and dairy products. They
include butter, cheese, whole milk, ice cream, cream, and fatty meats.
You can eat foods with saturated fats now and then, but not too often.
These fats contain high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the “bad
cholesterol,” and they’ve been implicated in heart disease.
 Monounsaturated fat: These fats come from plant sources. They include
olive, canola, and peanut oils; avocado; and nuts (almonds, pecans,
peanuts, and cashews). Monounsaturated fat is high in calories, but it’s
excellent for your health because it lowers cholesterol levels in your
blood and helps prevent heart disease.
 Polyunsaturated fat: This fat is useful against blood clotting, heart dis-
ease, and high blood pressure. Polyunsaturated fats go rancid quickly if
you don’t refrigerate them. The fats fall in two categories:
• Omega-3 essential fatty acid is found in free-range poultry and 
in eggs. Most people don’t get enough healthy Omega-3 in their
diets. The best sources of this fat are free-range eggs and cold-
water ocean fish such as salmon, tuna, sardines, and mackerel.
214
Part IV: Personalizing Your Program 
Tasty cooking with monounsaturated fat
If you’re looking for a good source of monoun-
saturated fat and don’t want to give up a tasty
diet, include olive oil in your diet. It’s great for
salads and works well in cooking. You shouldn’t
heat olive oil too high, however, and you should
refrigerate it.
Many farmer’s markets specialize in fresh oils;
often, you can sample the oils before buying.
You can find a wide selection of flavors ranging
from bitter to buttery to almost lemony. Cold-
pressed, first-run, extra virgin olive oil is the
best because it’s unrefined. Try to buy the oil in
small amounts, store it in dark or opaque bot-
tles, and consume it while it’s fresh — oils
exposed to light may become rancid in no time.

Vegetarian sources of Omega-3 — which must be refrigerated and
not heated before consuming — include flax seeds, evening prim-
rose, and borage oil.
• Omega-6 essential fatty acid is found in mother’s milk, organ
meats, lean meats, safflower, sunflower, green leafy vegetables,
legumes, and Spirulina.
Using antioxidants as anti-aging agents
Oxidation is a natural process that makes objects from food to metal decay.
Cut an apple in half, come back a half-hour later, and you’ll see that the apple
has turned brown. Leave a piece of metal outdoors long enough, and it will
rust.
215
Chapter 13: Eating to Enhance Your Yoga-with-Weights Workout
Juicing your way to better nutrition
While surfing television channels in the past,
you may have seen an infomercial by Jack La
Lanne that touts the benefits of juicing fruits and
vegetables to get optimal nutrition from your
foods. La Lanne, a pioneer in the field of health
and fitness who’s now in his 90s, claims that the
secret to his longevity is exercise and drinking
plenty of fruit and vegetable juice. La Lanne is a
dynamic and inspiring example of how impor-
tant a healthy diet in combination with a well-
balanced exercise program really is to longevity
and vitality.
Juicing is a great way to include plenty of
antioxidants and an array of nutrients in your
diet. And it’s easy. All you need is high-quality
produce and a good juicer. You can buy recipe
books for juicing, and your juicer may come with
a recipe book to help you get started.
Follow these guidelines to make delicious and
nutritious juices in your home:
 Wash all produce before juicing.
 Use only fresh fruits and vegetables, and,
whenever you can, buy organic, unsprayed
produce.
 Remove pits, seeds, and stems, but use the
skins of fruits such as apples and peaches.
You may be tempted to peel them, but the
skins are full of vitamins and minerals.
 Don’t juice bananas and avocados because
of their low water content. You can, how-
ever, blend them with other fruits and veg-
etables in juices.
 Use greens, carrots, parsley, bell peppers,
celery, and beets to add color to your juices.
Color makes the juice more appetizing.
 Use apples, pears, grapes, and melons to
sweeten your juice.
 Add a spoonful of juice pulp to your glass
before you stir and drink to get more fiber in
your diet.
 Make only enough juice for one day, and 
try to drink it immediately after juicing.
Refrigerate juice immediately if you can’t
drink it right away.

Oxidation also occurs in your body as part of the aging process. When
oxygen interacts with your cells, it can cause damage. In most cases, your
body replaces the cells, but 1 to 2 percent of the cells are damaged in the
course of the replacement process, and these cells produce free radicals —
unstable, highly reactive molecules with unpaired electrons. Free radicals
can injure cells and damage DNA, setting the stage for diseases such as
cancer. Antioxidants can help reduce free-radical damage.
Examples of antioxidants include berries, prunes, plums, and raisins. Among
vegetables, you can’t go wrong with kale, spinach, Swiss chard, broccoli, and
Brussels sprouts. Be sure to include antioxidants in your diet. In addition to
helping your overall health, antioxidants help your body recover from exer-
cising, especially useful after a yoga-with-weights workout.
Developing Good Eating Habits
Good eating habits are almost as important as good dietary habits for your
health and ability to benefit from exercise. In other words, it’s not only what
you eat, but also how you eat that makes the difference in your health 
program.
Here are some ideas for developing good eating habits:
 Eat slowly, and savor your food. Savor each bite, feel its texture, and
enjoy its flavor. Chewing releases digestive enzymes in your saliva and
helps dissolve the food for digestion. It also permits you to absorb your
food better and get the energy you need for yoga-with-weights exercising.
 Eat small portions. Don’t overload your system. Fill half your stomach
with food, one quarter with liquid, and then stop. Leave the table a little
hungry, but satisfied, rather than stuffed like a big, fat chair. You want to
get the nutrients you need for exercising, but you don’t want to overdo it.
In the yoga tradition, teachers recommend that you use your hand as a
measurement for food. Your palm, held gently like a cup with your fin-
gers together, is considered the right measurement for a food serving.
Eating enough to fit in your cupped hand is a nice way to judge the size
of a moderate meal. (You can add veggies and salad for a fuller meal.)
 Eat small meals, but eat more often. Eating small meals throughout the
day is easier on your digestive system. By eating this way, you can regu-
late your energy level at all times of the day, ensuring that you’ll always
have energy in reserve to start working out.
216
Part IV: Personalizing Your Program 

 Don’t be afraid to snack. You don’t need to be embarrassed about feel-
ing hungry when you eat a diet of fresh and whole foods. You can always
have something from the whole-foods categories (see “Following
Guidelines for Healthy Eating” earlier in this chapter). To keep hunger at
bay, snack on fruits and vegetables, small amounts of protein, or whole
grains and small amounts of cereal or oatmeal. Taking in enough fluid
daily is also helpful so that you don’t overeat. You may be thirsty, but
your thirst shows up as hunger, so have a glass of water when in doubt
and then have something light and healthy if you’re still hungry. You
should also consider drinking warm tea or vegetable and fruit juice.
Hunger is your body’s signal to eat, but most people are unacquainted with
this very basic sensation because they may be overeating throughout the day.
Appetite is healthy. Tune in to your body’s signals, and give it what it needs.
 Make fresh salads and brothy vegetable soups a mainstay in your diet.
These foods are simple to prepare and good to eat, and they give you
the energy you need to work out.

Putting your body through detox
Once or twice a year, you should consider
undergoing a cleansing and purification diet.
Your body is your vehicle for life, so once in a
while it pays to clean the machine. Periods of
cleansing with natural and water-rich fresh
foods clean out old debris in your body at a 
deep level. Cleansing and purification diets can
help you shed unwanted weight and recover
your energy and vitality while detoxifying and
cleansing your body. In regard to detox diets, Dr.

Addressing Body Aches and Pains
In This Chapter
 Examining the cause of chronic muscle pain
 Relieving pain in your neck and shoulders
 Focusing on back pain and discomfort
 Loosening tension in your hips
 Adding strength and flexibility to your hamstrings and quads
C
hronic muscle pain interferes with your quality of life. It prevents you
from sleeping and taking part in the activities that you like to do. The
pain can appear when you least expect it — when you bend over to pick up
an envelope you dropped or when you reach for the cereal box in the cup-
board. The pain is a handicap that prevents you from enjoying your life. It
does nothing less than steal your freedom.
This chapter explains what causes chronic muscle pain and, more impor-
tantly, how yoga with weights can help address it. The exercises we provide
focus on the parts of the body where most people experience pain and dis-
comfort — the neck, shoulders, hips, lower and upper back, hamstrings, and
quadriceps.
We recommend you use the Complete Breath described in Chapter 4 when
you perform the exercises in this chapter.
What Causes Chronic Muscle 
Pain Anyway?
Essentially, your nervous system uses chronic muscle pain to tell you that
something in your body isn’t right or is out of balance. As if you didn’t know
already, pain’s job is to grab your attention. Muscle pain is a message telling
you to change something about your body — the way you stand or sit, what

you eat, or how you live your life, for example. Pain tells you to pause, to be
more careful, and to be more respectful of your body. Look at it this way: If
you touch a hot stove, the pain you feel in your fingertips tells you to move
your hand away from the flames. Chronic pain grabs your attention and holds
it with a firm, steady grip, but the message that chronic pain sends is harder
to interpret. You feel the pain, but you aren’t quite sure what’s causing it.
Constant, unrelieved muscle pain occurs when you ignore or stop listening to
your body signals and continue the behavior that causes the pain. For exam-
ple, sitting slumped at a computer for hours puts tremendous pressure and
strain on your neck and shoulders. You hyperextend your muscles and
stretch them out of alignment. Over time, these muscles lose their elasticity
and tone and become hardened and rigid. They feel sore, and you experience
chronic pain in your neck and shoulders.
Weak muscles that lose their tone and strength can’t properly support the
skeletal system. Lack of movement and flexibility can also be a factor in
reducing elasticity in the connective tissue of your muscles, and this can
cause muscle stiffness, rigidity, and pain. For example, many kinds of back
pain are caused by weak belly muscles. Your belly muscles are crucial for
supporting your back. Without them, you couldn’t sit up or stand up straight.
If your belly muscles become lax, a chain reaction occurs. The muscles along
your spine become lax and nonsupporting as well, which can translate into a
sore back.
Yoga with weights is an excellent way to address chronic muscle pain. The
slow, relaxed movements help to open up tight and stiff areas of your body.
The exercises also strengthen your body so that your musculoskeletal
system gets the support it needs from different muscles. In the remainder of
this chapter, we show you how to focus on different parts of your body to
relieve chronic muscle pain with yoga-with-weights exercises.
220
Part IV: Personalizing Your Program 
Sleeping in spite of neck or back pain
The position in which you sleep can cause neck
or back pain or aggravate already painful areas.
If you have neck pain, consider sleeping with a
neck pillow (sometimes called a cervical pillow;
the cervical is the top portion of the spine that
forms the back of your neck). This pillow sup-
ports the curve created by your shoulders,
neck, and head. It takes some of the weight
from your neck so that your muscles can rest
and recuperate.
If you suffer from back pain, take some of the
weight off your spine when you sleep. Try lying
on your back with a small pillow under your
knees. If you prefer sleeping on your side, place
a pillow between your knees to relieve your
spine of a portion of your body weight. It can
take time (for plenty of trial and error), but find-
ing the right mattress is sometimes the cure for
back pain. Sleeping on a firm mattress often
makes a difference. If you haven’t found one,
put a half-inch of plywood under your mattress
for support.

Diseases such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), Parkinson’s disease, and
fibromyalgia can also cause chronic muscle pain. Pain can also be a side
effect of some prescription drugs. If you’re concerned about chronic muscle
pain, be sure to consult your doctor.
Managing the Pain in Your Neck
What causes neck pain? Usually, weakness in the muscles of the neck is the
culprit, although abnormal sleeping positions, injury, and poor posture can
also be causes.
If you have acute pain in your neck, we advise you to consult your healthcare
provider for an evaluation and physical-therapy referral.
To relieve neck pain, you can perform the following stretching exercise,
which is designed to strengthen your neck muscles. It tones the posterior
muscles of your neck, opens up your upper chest, and tones the muscles
along your spine. The exercise creates an isolated muscle contraction that
helps to maintain the natural curve of your neck and strengthen the support-
ing muscles around your neck.
Don’t attempt this exercise if you’ve recently had whiplash or compressions 
in your sternum or vertebrae from an accident of some kind. Consult your
healthcare provider for clearance before you attempt strengthening exercises.
Grab your hand weights for this stretching exercise and follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent, your feet flat on the floor,
your elbows bent and at your sides, and the weights in your hands
with your palms facing inward.
This is the starting position. Engage the muscles of your belly for 
support.
2. Press into your elbows and, using the muscles in the backs of your
arms, lift your shoulders and back off the ground; lift your chin as
well while you arch your back (see Figure 14-1).
In this position, the lumbar curve of your lower back lifts up toward
your navel, and your belly pulls in and up. Lift your shoulders and chest
up, and widen your collarbone. Don’t throw yourself into this position;
lift your body slowly.
You should feel the back of your head pressing into the floor and the
muscles in the back of your neck engaging.
221
Chapter 14: Addressing Body Aches and Pains

3. Hold this pose for three full breaths and then relax back to the start-
ing position (see Step 1).
Take slow, relaxed breaths. If you can’t hold the pose for three full
breaths, hold it as long as you can. (Chapter 4 explains various breath-
ing techniques you can employ.)
Loosening Your Stiff Shoulders
Stiff and sore shoulders are common because so many people carry stress in
their shoulders. After all, you “carry all your troubles on your shoulders” and
“shoulder your responsibilities.” Your shoulders bear plenty of weight — the
metaphorical kind and the physical kind — and they can become stiff from
lack of movement and chronic tension that builds over time. You probably
see people who shrug all the time because they carry so much stress in their
shoulders.
Tightness and pain in the shoulders are common because it’s so easy to
slump your shoulders as you sit at a desk or drive your car, especially if you
spend much time at these activities. The average person drives a car or sits
in front of a computer for many hours each day.
If you’ve had a shoulder injury to your rotator cuff or shoulder girdle area,
relaxing and loosening the muscles of your shoulders is especially difficult.
Because you can’t move your shoulders as much as you used to, your shoul-
ders get even stiffer. Over time, you may experience chronic pain because
your shoulders have lost their range of motion.
For desk dwellers, truck drivers, and rehabbers alike, the following stretching
exercise is designed to relieve discomfort in your shoulders and increase
your shoulders’ range of motion so your muscles can loosen up.
Grab one hand weight and follow these steps:

1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor;
hold the weight in both hands above your chest with your elbows
bent (see Figure 14-2a).
This is the starting position. Engage your abdominal muscles for support.
2. Without turning your head, slowly move the weight to the right 
side of your body until your right elbow touches the floor (see Fig-
ure 14-2b).
Feel the backside of your left shoulder — your trapezius muscle — 
loosening and opening up. A nice feeling, no?
If you also have some discomfort in your neck, you can move your head to
the side as you lower the weight and watch the weight as it moves toward
the floor. This loosens the muscles on the sides of your neck. You can also
loosen your neck muscles by turning your head in the opposite direction.
3. Take four slow breaths in this position.
Inhale to a count of four and exhale to a count of four when you take the
breaths. Feel your shoulder muscles loosening. (Chapter 4 presents
many yoga breathing techniques you can put into action.)
4. Move the weight back to the starting position (see Figure 14-2a).
Pause to rest, and then repeat this exercise by moving the weight to the left
side of your body.

Chapter 14: Addressing Body Aches and Pains

Relieving Back Discomfort and Pain
You can often blame poor muscle conditioning for back pain. Weak abdomi-
nal muscles and weak lower back muscles cause pain that makes it hard to
bend down or sit for long periods of time. If weak muscles aren’t the problem,
musculoskeletal imbalances caused by poor posture can also bring about
back pain and back discomfort.
Because back discomfort can have different causes, no single exercise can
help relieve the pain all the time. If you experience an acute injury to your
back or a recent onset of severe pain, consult your healthcare provider. He or
she may be able to give you exercises specific to your injury.
Back pain is an instance when paying attention and listening to your body is
essential. Try to find out what’s causing your back pain and what you can do —
sit in a different way, sleep in a different position, and so on — to alleviate it.
Because no single exercise can alleviate back pain, we offer you three stretch-
ing exercises in the pages that follow in the hope that one will do the trick.
We present one exercise that addresses back stiffness, one that addresses
lower back pain, and one that focuses on your lumbar region. Try out all
three and see which works best on your back.
Stretching back stiffness
Your back is a common repository of stress, and stress is a common cause of
stiffness. The following stretching exercise is excellent for ironing out stiff-
ness in your back. It increases blood circulation in your back and relieves the
stress you carry there.
Grab your hand weights and follow these steps:
1. Stand with your feet below your hips, your toes pointing forward, and
the weights hanging at your sides with your palms facing inward.
Engage your belly muscles from the start; you need them to support
your spine.
2. Inhaling to a count of four, slowly roll your shoulders up and forward
(see Figure 14-3a).
This is the starting position.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, bend your knees slightly and roll your
torso forward, letting the weights hang down in front of you (see
Figure 14-3b).
224
Part IV: Personalizing Your Program 

Your neck, head, and shoulders should be loose and relaxed in this posi-
tion. Let the weights pull your torso forward and lengthen your spine.
Keep your feet parallel to one another, with both feet pointed straight
ahead, as you introduce movement into the exercise.
If it feels comfortable, you can remain in this position with the weights
hanging down and your torso rolled forward for three or four full breaths
(inhaling and exhaling to counts of four). You can really stretch out your
spine this way.
4. Inhaling to a count of four and pressing through your legs, stand up
and roll your shoulders up, back, and down as you return to the start-
ing position (see Figure 14-3a).
Feel the breath filling your lungs as you return to the upright position.
5. Exhale to a count of four as you rest in the starting position.
Concentrate on the moment as the breath — and your tension — leaves
your body.
Do this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest, and then repeat the exercise
another six to eight times.

Strong belly muscles help support your lower back and reduce your risk of
stiffness and injury. The following stretching exercise is designed to open up
your lower back to relive tension and strengthen your belly muscles and the
muscles of your inner thighs and back — muscles that support your back,
especially the lower part.
You need both ankle weights for this stretching exercise. When you’re ready,
follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your right knee bent and tucked toward your
chest, your fingers interlaced slightly below your knee, and your left
leg extended straight out.
This is the starting position. Make sure your belly muscles are engaged
right away.
2. As you exhale to a count of four, press your knee into your hands as
you raise your head and shoulders off the ground (see Figure 14-4).
Keep your left leg flat on the floor. Feel your belly, back, and inner-thigh
muscles working.
If you feel up to it, hold this position for three full breaths (inhale and
exhale to counts of four) to really work your belly muscles and stretch
your back. If you have knee problems, try holding your leg with your
hands behind your knee.
3. As you inhale to a count of four, lower your head and shoulders to the
floor to return to the starting position (see Step 1).
Do this exercise six to eight times with your right leg, pause to rest, and then
do six to eight repetitions with your left leg.

Targeting your lumbar region
Loosely defined, the lumbar region is your lower back, an area that often gets
sore and emits pain. The region comprises the five lumbar vertebrae between
your pelvis and the back of your rib cage. The following stretching exercise is
designed to strengthen the muscles that support your lumbar region and
loosen your back and spine as a whole to relieve pain.
Strap on your ankle weights for this stretching exercise. When you’re ready,
follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent, your feet flat on the floor, and
your arms at your sides with your palms flat on the ground (see Fig-
ure 14-5a).
This is the starting position. Engage your abdominal muscles right away.
2. Inhaling to a count of four, lift your lower back toward the ceiling as
you press into your feet and hands (see Figure 14-5b).
Make sure your buttocks, shoulders, and head remain on the floor.

3. Exhaling to a count of four, lower your back to the floor to return to
the starting position (see Figure 14-5a).
Keep your abdominal muscles engaged as you lower your back to the
rhythm of your breathing.
Do this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest, and then do six to eight
more repetitions.
Alleviating Hip Pain
Any number of injuries can cause hip pain: a pulled groin from an overexten-
sion of your legs, tightness in your back, and arthritis, to name a few. Even
mild athletic activities can cause hip pain if you forget to stretch before
diving in. In the course of a normal day, you don’t stretch your hips. When
you bend over to pick up some trash, for example, you stretch your ham-
strings, but no day-to-day activity stretches your hips. You have to make the
extra effort.
Many people experience discomfort when they first start stretching their
hips in yoga-with-weights exercises — especially men, who often have tight
and rigid hips. As you do hip-stretching exercises, listen carefully to your
body, and stretch enough to relieve muscle tension but not so much that you
strain your hips.
The following stretching exercise is designed to loosen the muscles of your
hips. It isn’t easy, but if you stick with it, your hips will start to defrost in no
time.
Strap on your ankle weights and follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your right leg bent, your left hand grasping
your right knee, and your right hand to your side in the T position.
This is the starting position. Your left leg should remain straight as you
lie down.
2. Exhaling to a count of four, roll your right leg over your left leg 
(see Figure 14-6).
Continue to hold your knee with your left hand, and gently press your
knee down. Move slowly, and feel your hip muscles stretching and filling
with lightness and space as you move your leg.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, return to the starting position (see Step 1).
Instead of returning to the starting position right away, you can try hold-
ing your leg in the rollover position for three or four full breaths (inhal-
ing and exhaling to counts of four). You’ll find by the third breath that
you’re really giving your hip a workout.
228
Part IV: Personalizing Your Program 

Do this exercise six to eight times with each leg, pause to rest, and then do
six to eight more repetitions with each leg.
Lengthening Your Hamstrings 
with a Stretch
The hamstrings are the muscle groups that run from your “sitting bones” in
the back of your upper legs to slightly below your knees. If you don’t have
strong or limber hamstrings, you’re subject to knee pain, torn cartilage, and
poor posture. Tight hips, a tight back, and tight calves can cause your ham-
strings to be tight. Over time, chronic tight hamstrings can alter the curva-
ture of your lower back, causing a flattening of your lumbar spine. Tight
hamstrings also prevent you from bending over comfortably and touching
your toes. In fact, you know your hamstrings are too tight if bending down is
uncomfortable for you.
Hamstring tightness in and of itself doesn’t cause pain in your hamstrings;
most often, tight hamstrings are related to lower back weakness or stiffness.
If the muscles of your inner thighs are weak, they don’t provide enough sup-
port to your pelvic girdle, which puts additional stress on your back and legs,
including your hamstrings. In many cases, lower back problems don’t resolve
themselves until your hamstrings are adequately stretched.
The object of the following stretching exercise is to work your hips and back,
and in doing so, loosen and open your hamstrings.
If you have a torn hamstring, do this exercise very carefully. Stretching can
help the muscle heal, but overstretching can further damage it. If you feel
sharp pain or excessive burning, retreat from the exercise. Only you can tell
when your body is ready to push a little farther.

Chapter 14: Addressing Body Aches and Pains

You need ankle weights for this exercise. When you’re ready, follow these
steps:
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent, your feet flat on the floor, and
your hands at your sides.
2. Lift your right knee as close as possible to your chest, and grasp the
back of the knee with both hands.
This is the starting position.
3. Straighten your right leg as if you want to press it into the ceiling 
(see Figure 14-7).
Spread your toes wide and press through your foot as you lift your leg.
Press your quad (the top of your upper leg) to ensure that your ham-
string muscle lies closer to the bone where it has optimal lengthening
ability.
Your left leg should be bent if it makes it easier for your right leg to
lengthen and stretch. For a better stretch, you can keep your left leg flat
on the floor; however, most people are too tight to stretch this way.
Having your left leg bent and your left foot on the floor keeps your hips
and pelvis stable.
4. Take three or four deep, full breaths in this position.
Feel your hamstring stretching. (Chapter 4 gives you many breathing
techniques to choose from.)
5. Bend your right leg to return to the starting position (see Step 2).
Repeat this exercise with your left leg. Rest when you need to rest, and
stretch as much as you need to in order to feel your hamstrings open up.

Stretching Out Your Quads
The quads, also known as the quadriceps, are the large muscles on the top of
your upper legs. They’re one of the most important muscle groups because
you work your quads when you walk, run, and jump. Strong quads make for
strong knee joints, and having loosened quads prevents injury. When your
quads are too tight, it puts pressure on your hamstrings, which makes your
hamstrings more susceptible to injury. Most people experience pain in their
quadriceps because they’ve lost flexibility in this area. It’s important to stretch
and warm up your quads before you work out, no matter what kind of exer-
cise you intend to do.
The following two yoga-with-weights exercises strengthen, stretch, and
lengthen your quad muscles and give greater stability to your knees.
Standing quad stretcher
Strap on your ankle weights for the following exercise. When you’re ready,
follow these steps:
1. Stand behind a chair, holding the top of the chair with your left hand.
This is the starting position.
We highly recommend that you put the chair against a wall, or else it
could slide during the exercise, and you may slide to the ground with it.
Don’t follow the model’s lead in Figure 14-8; she’s a daredevil.
2. Bend your right knee and grasp your right foot with your right hand,
bringing your heel as close to your buttocks as you comfortably can
(see Figure 14-8).
For a deeper stretch, use your left hand to hold your right foot.
Remember to engage your belly muscles; doing so helps support your
back.
3. Hold this pose for four breaths, and then lower your leg to the start-
ing position (see Step 1).
As you inhale and exhale, concentrate on your quad muscles loosening.
Repeat this exercise with your left leg.
231
Chapter 14: Addressing Body Aches and Pains

Sitting quad stretcher
For the following quadriceps exercise, you can put a towel or blanket under
your feet or between your buttocks and heels if that makes sitting easier.
You need ankle weights for this exercise, but don’t strap them on. When
you’re ready, follow these steps:
1. Sit on your heels with your knees bent, your feet underneath your
buttocks, and the ankle weights resting on your thighs (see Fig-
ure 14-9).
This is the starting position (and the only position, really). Rest your
arms by your sides.
2. Take three or four slow breaths.
The number of breaths you take depends on how comfortable you are in
the sitting position. Feel your quads release as you exhale. This exercise
not only helps loosen your quads, but also stretches your knee joints.

To stretch your quads even more, you can place the ankle weights on your
thighs and then gently lean backward, keeping your abdominal muscles
engaged to protect your back and legs. You can also try bending forward 
over your legs for a nice hip and back opener.

Chapter 15
Toning and Focusing on Different
Body Areas
In This Chapter
 Devising your own yoga-with-weights workout
 Examining muscle groups and exercises that give them the best workout
T
his chapter explains how yoga with weights can help you strengthen and
tone different parts of your body — your legs, arms, shoulders, torso,
chest, belly, and buttocks. Sorry, yoga with weights can’t exactly strengthen
and tone your brain, although it does keep you guessing about what exercise
you may come up with next. This chapter is strictly for the body. It’s for
people who want to target a particular part of their body to tone it, make it
look better, or increase its range of motion.
We also give instructions here for creating your own workout. If you spend
any time with yoga with weights, you soon discover which exercises work
best for you, make you feel stronger, and make you feel better. Suppose you
were to gather your favorite exercises into a single workout. To do that, what
do you need to know? As we explain in this chapter, you can’t do the exer-
cises in just any order, because you have to start slow and finish slow. And
you also have to be careful to include the right mix of exercises in the batch.
Keep reading if you want to personalize your yoga-with-weights training and
take it to another level.
Working out target areas every other day is best, because it gives your mus-
cles enough time to recover. Resting your muscles is a bit like sleep. After
they’re rested, the muscles have more endurance and stamina. You can exer-
cise them harder at the next workout.

Creating Your Own Workout
When you’ve spent a lot of time doing yoga with weights, when you’ve done
all the workouts and you’re well acquainted with the exercises, you may con-
sider creating your own workout. Why not? You know which exercises make
you feel healthiest. You know which exercises challenge you the most. If you
asked a personal trainer to devise a yoga-with-weights workout especially for
you, he or she would charge $50 an hour or more. Creating the workout on
your own costs considerably less than that, although it does require a bit of
thought on your part. This chapter gives you the tools to create a powerful
practice on your own.
Creating your own workout isn’t as simple as choosing your favorite exer-
cises and doing them one at a time. As you create a workout that focuses on
the parts of the body that matter to you, you have to consider warming up,
breathing, the sequence of exercises, the transitions between exercises, med-
itating, and how often to work out.
In Chapter 16, we present workouts tailor-made for swimming, tennis, base-
ball, and other popular sports. If your goal is to design a yoga-with-weights
workout program so you can play better in the sport you love, turn to
Chapter 16.
Warming up
Many people like to jump in and start exercising, but you should always start
a workout with warm-up exercises. To begin your custom-made workout,
choose some warm-up exercises from Chapter 6. These exercises take only a
minute to do, but warm-ups are essential to keep from being injured and to
prepare yourself mentally for your workout.
Do one warm-up exercise for each area of your body — your shoulders, back,
arms, and legs. If an area of your body is especially stiff or needs attention,
do two or three warm-up exercises from Chapter 6 for that area. Besides their
physical benefits, the warm-ups help you begin focusing on your yoga-with-
weights workout. They put you in the right mindset for exercising.
Breathing
We give instructions for inhaling and exhaling in each exercise we present in
this book. Breathing correctly is extremely important in a yoga-with-weights
workout. In yoga with weights, you work from the breath into the movement
during each exercise. Breathing is so important, in fact, that we select a 
236
Part IV: Personalizing Your Program 

specific breathing technique for each workout in this book. As part of design-
ing your own workout, choose a breathing technique of your own. Chapter 4
explains the Complete Breath, the Ocean Breath, and other breathing 
techniques.
When choosing a breathing technique, consider what type of workout you’ve
created for yourself and select the right breath to go with it. For example, if
yours is a dynamic workout, choose the Ocean Breath because it will rev your
engine. Go with the Complete Breath if your workout is more even-tempered.
Try the Cleansing Breath to get your focus and breath control going.
You can tell whether you’re working too hard or an exercise is too strenuous
by listening to the sound of your breathing. If you can’t maintain a steady
rhythm as you breathe, or if you start holding your breath, ease back a bit.
Work at an easier level until you develop your competence. Holding your
breath and breathing unsteadily are signs that you’re trying too hard or push-
ing too far. By focusing on your breathing, you always know when you need
to rest and whether you’re exercising correctly.
Sequencing
In yoga-with-weights exercising, sequencing is the order of exercises in a
workout routine. The object is to create a deliberate sequence that ends with
you feeling refreshed, alert, and vital. To that end, here are guidelines for
developing an exercise sequence for your workout:
1. Start slowly.
Always start with two or three easy exercises. Don’t challenge yourself
especially hard in the early going. Use your first few exercises as a time to
get into the flow of the routine and center yourself. Use a few of the warm-
up exercises found in Chapter 6 to prepare yourself first. Then move into a
few of the standing exercises to get a sense of breath and flow.
2. Peak two-thirds of the way through the routine.
When you feel energized, move into exercises that offer a challenge and
take you into new areas of personal development. Save your hardest
exercises — back-bending and abdominal exercises — for two-thirds of
the way through. This way, you have ample time to cool down before the
meditation period at the end of the workout.
3. End slowly.
Save one or two easy exercises for the end of the routine. Gentle twists,
seated exercises, forward bends, and stretches work nicely here. Ideally,
you should start with standing exercises and end with sitting exercises,
because sitting exercises are easier to do. Ending with a sitting exercise
helps you cool down for the meditation at the end of the workout (see
the “Ending with meditation” section later for more information).
237
Chapter 15: Toning and Focusing on Different Body Areas

Try not to work the same muscles in back-to-back exercises. For example,
don’t do two exercises in a row that work your shoulders. If you give your
muscles a rest during a routine, they can work that much harder when you
call upon them later on. By the end of the workout, you should feel a nice
quality of balance from head to toe.
Transitioning between exercises
What you do between yoga-with-weights exercises is nearly as important as
the exercises themselves. The object is to create effortless, flowing, graceful
transitions between exercises, with as little excess movement as possible. The
entire yoga philosophy is not about abrupt stops and starts, but going seam-
lessly from one exercise to the next. Done correctly, your workout feels as if it
was choreographed, because you pass so gracefully from exercise to exercise.
Experiment and tinker with the exercise sequence in your workout until you
get it just right. Keep in mind that the breathing serves as the bridge, creating
the seamless transitions, and moves you from one action to the next.
By paying attention to transitions as well as exercises, you can carry vitality,
strength, and endurance from one exercise to the next. With enough attention
to transitions, you can turn your yoga-with-weights workout into a seamless
flow with all the postures connected through balance and breath.
In their daily lives, yoga masters attempt to take this smooth transition
notion a step further. They try to make all transitions in their lives — transi-
tions from one activity to the next and even from one thought to the next —
pass smoothly and gracefully. Yoga is a quality of consciousness, a quality of
breath awareness that you can carry with you in your daily life as well as in
your yoga-with-weights workouts.
Ending with meditation
The meditation at the end of the workout is like a ribbon that ties everything
together. In our yoga classes, one or two students always skip out before the
meditation period at the end of the workout. If it weren’t for the fact that the
meditation is meant to be quiet and contemplative, we would shout at these
students: “Hey, wait a minute! Yes, I’m talking to you! You’re missing one of
the best parts of the class — perhaps even the most important one, the one
you may need the most!”
Meditation is an excellent opportunity to sit with yourself and your thoughts.
It’s your chance to take an inner inventory, so to speak, and look within your-
self for direction in your life. Meditation requires training and patience, but
238
Part IV: Personalizing Your Program 

the rewards are plentiful. It leaves you stronger and wiser. And think about it:
If you can’t stand to be with yourself in meditation, why should anyone else
want to be with you?
Be sure to include a meditation at the end of your workout. A meditation takes
only a few moments, integrating all the practices of your workout, as it quiets
your body and mind, leaving you feeling refreshed and ready for the rest of
your day. With practice, meditation gives you more balance and clarity in your
life. Chapter 6 explains what yoga meditation is and gives many different ways
and techniques to help you meditate.
Choosing how and when to work out
As tempted as you may be to focus exclusively on one part of your body in
your custom-made workout, try to work several parts. Overtraining one part
of your body or one muscle group can cause strains and even injuries.
Choose a different workout for each day or every other day of the week, and
take a break from exercising on the fourth day. This way, you don’t overdo it
in the beginning. Instead of a yoga-with-weights workout on your day of rest,
go for a walk and do warm-up exercises (see Chapter 6). You need some phys-
ical activity every day to stay in good health.
Change your exercise program every three to six weeks. You favor certain
muscles — and perhaps overdevelop them — by doing the same exercises all
the time. And you can get into an exercise rut and suffer from boredom if you
stay with the same routine. By continually adapting your exercise program,
you make sure all the areas of your body get enough exercise and continually
challenge yourself at yoga with weights.
Targeting Parts of Your Body
Do you want to strengthen your shoulders? Take a couple of inches from your
waist? Maybe you want to make your back stronger to help prevent back-
aches. The remainder of this chapter presents exercises that target different
parts of your body — your shoulders, chest, arms, back, belly, hips, buttocks,
and legs. Use these yoga-with-weights exercises to put together a workout tai-
lored just for you.

Developing your shoulders
In case you didn’t know already, your shoulders are located in the upper
torso area where your arms connect to your upper back and chest. Without
strong shoulder muscles, you can’t have a strong upper body or strong arms.
Almost all exercises and activities that work your chest and back also work
your shoulders. The shoulders are made up primarily of the deltoid and rota-
tor cuff (refer to Figure 15-3):
© IUSM Office of Visual Media
 Deltoid: This muscle wraps completely around the tops of your arms.
It’s responsible for rotating the shoulders, rolling the shoulders, and
moving the arm in all directions. Strengthening the deltoid can help pre-
vent injuries to the shoulder.
 Rotator cuff: This muscle, which is positioned around your shoulder
joint, holds your arm in its socket and keeps the shoulder joint stable
when you move your arm. You use this muscle every time you throw a
ball or any other object. The rotator cuff is actually the name for four
small muscles that work in consort: the subscapularis, teres minor, infra-
spinatus, and supraspinatus.
Table 15-1 describes exercises from this book that strengthen the muscles of
the shoulder or make these muscles more flexible.

Working on your chest
If you look down, you can see your chest. It’s the thing that you spill seeds on
when you’re eating watermelon. The primary muscles of the chest are the
pectorals, known affectionately to weightlifters as the “pecs” (see Figure 15-4).
These muscles are used for pushing and for squeezing. For example, when
you push open a heavy door or hug a tree, you use your pectoral muscles.
The pectoralis major flexes, adducts, and rotates your arms medially. When
you climb a tree, these muscles draw your body upward. The pectoralis
minor draws the scapula, or shoulder blade, downward. For example, when
you push yourself up from a chair with your hands and arms, you flex your
pectoralis minor. All these muscles work together to create coordinated
movement.
Conditioning the pectorals helps lift the chest up. In women, strong pectoral
muscles help support the breasts and make them firmer. Table 15-2 lists exer-
cises in this book that you can use to strengthen your pectoral muscles.

Toning and strengthening your arms
Poor Venus de Milo didn’t have any arms, and her yoga-with-weights work-
outs focused exclusively on her legs and torso. You, however, are invited to
tone and strengthen your arms with yoga-with-weights exercises. As shown in
Figure 15-5, the primary muscles of the arm are the biceps and triceps:
 Biceps: These two muscles are found in the front of the upper arm. They
are responsible for bending your elbow. Strong biceps are necessary for
lifting heavy loads and growing toddlers.
 Triceps: These muscles in back of the upper arm straighten the elbow.
You also engage these muscles along with the pectorals when you push
with your hands. And you use your triceps when you carry a briefcase,
bowling ball, or other heavy object at the end of your extended arm.

Focusing on the back 
of the torso and spine
Along with your spine, the muscles of your back provide strength and stabil-
ity for your entire body. For that reason, unless your back is strong, you can’t
have strong arms or legs, in much the same way that a tree’s branches can’t
grow big unless the trunk is strong enough to support the branches. The
muscles on your back are oriented to the vertebrae in your spine. These mus-
cles are consistently shifting, flexing, and relaxing so you can balance. As
shown in Figure 15-6, these are the primary muscles of the back of the torso
and spine.
246
Part IV: Personalizing Your Program 

 Trapezius: This muscle is found on each side of your spine. It runs from
the neck, across the back of the shoulders, to the middle of your back.
You flex it when you lift your shoulders or lift your arm to your side. The
trapezius carries stress and for that reason is prone to being tight.
 Rhomboids: These muscles, also found on each side of the spine, are
located in the center of your back. You use them to pull your shoulder
blades together and assist in drawing your shoulders down. Strong
rhomboids are necessary for good posture and for keeping your back
erect.
 Latissimus dorsi: Known as the “lats” to weightlifters, these large mus-
cles run the length of your back, from below your shoulders to your
lower back. You use them to pull yourself over high brick walls and hold
boulders over your head. They’re also important for good posture,
because they keep you from slouching or having rounded shoulders.
 Erector spinae: These muscles run the entire length of your back. Along
with your abdominals, they are responsible for straightening your spine.
Back pain is sometimes caused by weak erector spinae and abdominal
muscles.
Table 15-4 lists exercises in this book that work the back of your torso and
the muscles connected to your spine.

Engaging your belly muscles
Most people exercise their belly muscles — better known as the abdominal
muscles — because they want a flatter stomach and a trimmer figure. However,
these muscles serve purposes besides keeping you trim. Most importantly,
they support your spine and back. They also improve your posture (if they’re
strong). As shown in Figure 15-7, these are the muscles of the belly.

 Rectus abdominus: This flat sheet of muscle runs from under the chest
down to below the navel. You flex this muscle when you bend at the
waist or do a sit-up.
 Internal and external obliques: These muscles run diagonally down the
sides of your body and connect to the rectus abdominus. You use them
to twist or bend from side to side. Having strong obliques helps support
the spine and prevent lower back pain.
We devote an entire chapter of this book to strengthening the belly muscles —
Chapter 12. Besides the exercises described there, you can do these exer-
cises to strengthen your belly muscles: the Plow (in Chapter 9) and the Horse
(in Chapter 11).
Toning your buttocks and hips
Strengthening the buttocks and hips can help prevent hip and lower back
injuries. Our students often ask us for specialized exercises that focus on
making their hips more flexible. Because the hips come into play when you
walk, sit, and stand, having flexible hips is essential for longevity and for
quality of movement throughout your life. As shown in Figure 15-8, these
muscles make up the buttocks and hips.

 Gluteus maximus and gluteus medius: Known as “glutes” to
weightlifters, these muscles span the entire width of the buttocks, from
the cheek to the derriere (pardon our French). When you jump, climb
stairs, or rise out of a chair, you exercise your glutes.
 Hip abductors: This muscle group is found in the upper quadrant of the
hip and buttocks area. You use it when you rotate your hips or move
your legs to the side. Weak hip abductors cause you to shuffle when you
walk.
 Leg adductors: These muscles run from the inside of the hip to various
points along the inner thigh. You flex these muscles when you move
from side to side.
We also should mention the pelvic girdle, which is the boney structure, com-
posed of several fused bones, that surrounds the pelvis. It receives the
weight of the upper body and passes it to the lower limbs; it absorbs stress
from the lower limbs as well. Keeping the muscles surrounding the pelvic
girdle toned and conditioned is necessary for healthy movement and overall
stability.
To keep your hips from freezing up and your buttocks from sagging, try out
the exercises listed in Table 15-5.

Strengthening your legs
Unless you have strong legs, you can’t run away from your creditors (just kid-
ding!). Besides enjoying a good walk, the best reason to have strong legs is to
prevent common injuries to the knees and ankles. Strong legs are also neces-
sary for balancing. These are the primary muscles of the legs:
 Quadriceps: This is the name for the four muscles on the top of the leg
above the knee (refer to Figure 15-1). These muscles are responsible for
straightening your leg. They play an important role in walking and running.
 Hamstrings: This group includes three muscles on the back of the upper
leg. These muscles bend your knee (refer to Figure 15-2). Working in
opposition to your quadriceps, they enable you to walk and run. The
hamstrings are especially prone to injury, so you should warm them up
before exercising.
 Gastrocnemius and soleus: These muscles, better known as your calves,
make up the large, diamond-shaped muscle group on the back of your
lower leg (refer to Figure 15-9). You flex this muscle group to stand on
your toes and to spring when you jump. The Achilles tendon is con-
nected to this muscle group.
© IUSM Office of Visual Media
 Tibialis anterior: This muscle runs from the front of your ankle to just
below your kneecap (refer to Figure 15-9). You use it to bend your ankle
and draw your toes upward. You can get shin splints if this muscle isn’t
properly conditioned.
 Adductor: This muscle is located in the inner thigh (refer to Figure 15-8). It
keeps the hip and pelvis stable and flexes when you move your leg forward.

weights benefits everybody. Part V shows you how
yoga with weights can benefit three select groups: 
athletes, seniors, and women.
Whether you hit the courts on the weekends or spend
your weekdays as an all-pro MVP, we show you how yoga-
with-weights exercises can help you perform better in the
sport you love most. We also look at women’s health
issues and demonstrate how yoga with weights can bene-
fit pregnant women. Finally, we include gentle yoga-with-
weights exercises designed especially for seniors.

Improving Your Game
In This Chapter
 Addressing stamina and focus for endurance sports
 Conditioning your body for team sports
 Expanding your range of motion and concentration for ball sports
 Giving yourself an edge when it’s you against your body
Yoga with weights is an excellent training foundation for athletes, no matter
which sport you play or how often you participate. Trainers agree that
you should be in shape for the sport of your choice, not get in shape for it. In
other words, to have more fun, get more out of a sport, and prevent yourself
from being injured, you should be in shape before you begin; you shouldn’t use
the sport as a means of getting in shape. Yoga with weights can help you get in
shape mentally and physically for the sport you love. The weight-bearing exer-
cises, the stretching, the exercises that build stamina, and the exercises that
help you develop coordination and balance are ideal for athletes.
Yoga with weights improves your strength, extends your body’s range of
motion, and releases tension from your muscles. It also trains you to concen-
trate and focus. You reap the benefits of being completely on the ball and
completely in the moment. Most athletes know the moment when time stands
still — no thought, no separation, just an expanded sense of being alive, of
being whole. Yoga with weights can help you find the zone and play in it more
often. Aside from the exercises themselves, the breathing techniques we pre-
sent give you more control and poise so you can maintain your inner steadi-
ness. You gain self-knowledge, self-study, and self-observation skills that
make you a skilled, more balanced athlete.
For each sport we include in this chapter, we provide a yoga-with-weights
workout: a series of exercises culled from the different workouts in this book,
as well as warm-up exercises from Chapter 6. You don’t have to do all the
yoga-with-weights exercises or warm-up exercises that we recommend; these
exercises are just guidelines. You can choose and create any combination of
exercises that feels right to you. All we ask is that you limit the yoga-with-
weights exercises to no more than ten at a time. Experiment with all the exer-
cises and select the ones that give you the most satisfaction. Over time, you’ll
be able to create a workout that suites you and improves your performance
in your sport of choice.

Swimming
Swimming is a wonderful activity for toning your upper body, torso, and legs.
Unlike cardiovascular activities such as jogging and weight training, swim-
ming doesn’t put any stress on your joints because, in effect, you’re weight-
less when you’re in the water. Another plus is that the water pressure on
your arms and legs benefits your circulatory system.
The yoga-with-weights exercises in Table 16-1 tone and condition the core
muscles of your belly and torso and stretch and tone the supporting struc-
tures of your shoulders so you can get a longer, smoother, cleaner stroke.
You’ll also notice better balance and coordination in your kicking legs and
more power in your kick.
As you do the exercises, take Complete Breaths (Chapter 4 presents many dif-
ferent breathing techniques). This rhythmic technique will help you be aware
of your breathing and get you ready for the rigors of swimming.

Running
Running is one of the best cardiovascular workouts you can perform. It
increases your lungs’ ability to take in oxygen and strengthens your heart. It
also helps lower your blood pressure because it maintains the elasticity of
your arteries and enables blood to flow more easily through your body; in
turn, running increases your stamina, burns calories so you can lose weight,
and prevents the bone and muscle loss that accompany aging. Figure 16-1
shows a couple of Sherri’s yoga students, Paula Glodowski and Andy Valla,
completing an iron-man triathlon.
You can use the yoga-with-weights exercises in Table 16-2 to develop core
strength in your abdominal muscles to improve your running performance.
These exercises also help you rehabilitate injuries, improve your overall fit-
ness, recover between runs, and rejuvenate your mind and body. Because
runners often experience pulled muscles and other injuries in their calves,
hamstrings, and groin, we include exercises that condition, stretch, and sup-
port those areas. By addressing all these areas through yoga-with-weights
exercises, you can prolong your running career.

Chapter 16: Improving Your Game

Cycling
Cycling has most of the benefits of running, but you get to cover more ground
and see more terrain. It builds your stamina and helps lower your blood pres-
sure. It helps you lose weight, prevents muscle and bone loss, and increases
your lungs’ capacity to breathe in oxygen. Compared to running, cycling pre-
sents fewer risks of injury (unless you’re mountain biking or speed racing).
And cycling has another benefit apart from exercise — it’s a great way to get
around without polluting the air you breathe.
In the 1960s, German bike racer Rudi Altig, the “Manheim Colossus,” announced
to the world that he was a yoga enthusiast. He did yoga exercises before and
after races to relax his muscular body and center his mind. Altig was one of
the first athletes to embrace yoga as a way to improve his performance in
sport.
The exercises in Table 16-3 would make Altig proud. They build strength and
condition your whole body, and they give your legs greater range of movement
so you can pedal faster and more efficiently. The exercises also strengthen
your back, spine, and shoulders so they can support your upper torso as you
ride your bike. And because bikers often experience tight hamstrings because
of the extra muscle packed into their thighs, these exercises stretch and
strengthen your legs. Along with the breathing techniques you see associated
with these exercises, the yoga-with-weights alignment principals will help pre-
pare you for the ride of your life.

Basketball
Depending on whom you’re playing with or against, basketball can be a very
grueling exercise. No sport has as much variety of movement as basketball.
You run, jump, move sideways, move backward, and occasionally dive to the
floor for a loose ball. On account of the variety of movement, basketball
works a variety of muscles. It requires excellent stamina and hand-eye coordi-
nation, and you have to be physically and mentally quick. The sport is a won-
derful cardiovascular activity and a total-body workout.
Whether you play basketball competitively or play for fun, the yoga-with-
weights exercises in Table 16-4 help you jump higher for more rebounds and
scoring and build your endurance and stamina. “There is no way I could have
played as long as I did without yoga,” NBA all-time leading scorer Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar told Men’s Health magazine. “My friends and teammates think I
made a deal with the devil. But it was yoga that made my training complete.”

Volleyball
Volleyball, like basketball, exercises many different muscle groups because
you move your body in so many different ways. The sport demands balance
and agility, the ability to jumpstart your energy reserves when needed, and
the lung capacity to keep going. But those are just the requirements to play
seriously; to be a good volleyball player, you need strength, power, speed,
and physical fitness along with the balance and coordination.
Injuries often occur to your hands, fingers, and wrists from contact with the
ball. Because you jump so often, you’re at risk of ankle injuries from landing
unevenly from aerial positions. The exercises in Table 16-5 are designed to
strengthen your ankles and the core muscles of your trunk to give you better
balance and coordination.

Power Walking (and Power Breathing)
Power walking isn’t something new under the sun, but fitness experts and
health-conscious people have recently taken a new interest in the activity
because its health results are so apparent and so quickly achieved (Chapter 6
describes some of the health benefits of walking).
Your hip, buttock, and leg muscles get a workout during a power walk. As a
power walker, you need to condition your upper torso so you can balance
better as you walk. The exercises in Table 16-6 are designed to tone, condi-
tion, strengthen, and stretch your legs and upper torso. They also create a
greater range of movement for your hips and legs.

Racket Sports
Racket sports such as tennis, squash, racquetball, badminton, and handball
can be very demanding on your body. Players need flexibility, aerobic fitness,
strength, stamina, and good hand-eye coordination. Racket sports involve
short bursts of energy, lateral movement, sprinting, jumping, and arm swinging.
Having strong core muscles in your trunk and torso can greatly improve the
power behind your movement — particularly your serves and returns of the
ball or shuttlecock. In racket sports, you often have to reach beyond the
norm to get to the ball or gracefully extend an arm to serve. By keeping your
body supple and flexible, you can extend your arms and play your favorite
sport for many years to come. The exercises in Table 16-7 can help balance
your body and develop a greater range of motion in your swing.

Golf
Golf is one of the most popular sports in the world. It teaches focus and con-
centration. And as long as you don’t get mad at your own play, it teaches you
a lesson similar to that taught by yoga — that relaxing can increase your
powers of concentration. If you get serious about the sport, you soon notice
the constant struggle between the conscious mind — analyzing, alert, and
logical — and the subconscious mind — the well of inner knowing that’s
wakeful, present, and clear. Golfers who don’t learn the nuances of the mental
game remain frustrated or give up before mastering the sport. One of the
biggest advantages golf has over other sports is that you play outdoors in a
clean, healthy environment. Of course, golf is also a great social game when
you play it with friends, family members, or business associates.
The exercises in Table 16-8 enhance your range of motion in the most impor-
tant areas of your golf swing — such as your hips and shoulders. They also
develop your ability to concentrate and focus, both of which are essential in
golf.

Skiing
Skiing requires dexterity, balance, and the ability to concentrate — qualities
you can develop through yoga-with-weights exercises. Yoga with weights
builds strength and improves body awareness, balance, and flexibility.
As far as skiing is concerned, one of the biggest benefits of yoga with weights
is the attention to breathing. You’re safer when you’re in a relaxed and aware
state. The attention yoga-with-weights exercises pay to breathing will develop
steadiness of mind so you can be fully in the moment as you ski, and that, in
turn, helps prevent injuries.
Skiing taxes the muscles of your lower body. The exercises in Table 16-9 build
the muscles in your lower body and make your hips and quads more flexible
and your knees stronger. Because range of motion is so vital for quick response
times when you’re skiing, we also include exercises that increase the range of
motion in your legs and arms. These exercises awaken new sources of joy and
exhilaration that you can take to the slopes.

Football and Soccer
Football and soccer (or American football and football, depending on your
loyalties) require stamina, physical strength, quickness, and the ability to
concentrate in spite of fatigue and exhaustion. Both sports make extraordi-
nary demands on the muscles of your legs, and football — especially if you
play on the offensive or defensive line — requires great upper-body strength
as well. On account of the physical demands and the variety of body move-
ments, football and soccer players are more prone to injury than athletes in
other sports.
Yoga with weights can help prevent injuries and improve performance
because it increases your agility and flexibility. It enables you to move with a
greater range of motion, which gives you the freedom and confidence to be a
better player. Baron Baptiste, Sherri’s brother and a renowned yoga teacher,
served as the “peak performance specialist” for the Philadelphia Eagles pro-
fessional football team for five years in the 1990s. Under his yoga tutelage,
the number of injuries on the team dropped significantly; Baron credits yoga
for this development.
The exercises we recommend in Table 16-10 require you to work major and
minor muscle groups simultaneously. These exercises help you improve your
overall fitness, rehabilitate injuries, and prolong your football and soccer
playing days.

Cross-Training
Cross-training refers to a training routine in which you engage in several 
different forms of exercise each week. Instead of engaging, for example, in
weightlifting three times a week, you lift weights, run, and play basketball.
The idea behind cross-training is to exercise your entire body.
Yoga with weights is, in and of itself, something of a cross-training exercise
program because it works so many muscle groups and tests your balancing
and endurance skills. It’s a great low-impact way to cross-train. Yoga with

In This Chapter
 Looking at women’s health issues from a yoga-with-weights perspective
 Reviewing yoga-with-weights exercises for expectant mothers
T
his chapter looks into how yoga with weights can address issues of
health and well-being specific to women — premenstrual syndrome,
maintaining bone density, mid-life depression, graceful aging, and childbirth.
We even offer a handful of yoga-with-weights exercises designed especially
for pregnant women.
This chapter may be called “Girl Talk,” but that doesn’t mean male readers
can’t eavesdrop. In fact, we encourage men to read this chapter, because they
can discover plenty about the women in their lives: who they really are, how
to cherish them, and how to make them happy.
Addressing Women’s Health Issues
through Yoga with Weights
Yoga with weights has some important advantages for women. The exercises
tend to increase bone density and ease the symptoms of premenstrual syn-
drome. They even help in fighting depression and preparing for childbirth.
Don’t believe us? You’d better keep reading.
Increasing bone density
Because the ovarian hormone estrogen plays an important part in maintain-
ing strong bones, and because a woman’s production of estrogen decreases
when she reaches menopause, women (more so than men) lose bone density
as they grow older. Bone density is a measure of how tightly packed the cells
and molecules in a bone are. The higher the bone density, the less likely a
bone is to fracture or break, and the faster it can heal.

Bone density reaches its peak when women are between the ages of 30 and
35, and then it begins to decline as estrogen production decreases. Most
losses in bone density occur when women are in their 40s, during the onset
of premenopause; at about age 40, men and women usually experience loss of
bone density because they don’t exercise as often. Diet plays a key role, too,
because older people can’t absorb the calcium in their food as readily. Today,
many doctors test the bone density of women when they’re in their mid 30s
to 40s to establish a baseline for bone density loss.
By exercising and eating right, premenopausal (before menopause) and 
perimenopausal (in the menopausal stage) women can build strong bones
during their 20s and early 30s and then maintain strong bones from about 
age 35 onward.
Yoga with weights can help you maintain bone density because your body
builds strong bones under the stress of exercise. As you lift weights and your
muscles pull against your bones, your body reacts by making the cells in
your bones stronger and denser to support the pull of your muscles. For
example, when you do arm curls, the bones in your upper arms gain bone
density. Yoga-with-weights exercises are excellent for women because they
help offset the loss of bone density that comes with menopause and aging.
Fighting depression
Depression can creep into the life of a woman at any time. Puberty, young
motherhood, starting a career, an empty nest, and menopause all cause pecu-
liar kinds of stress; and all can cause depression. Many women come into our
yoga classes with the idea of treating the symptoms of common depression.
These women want to return a sense of balance to their lives. Most get a wel-
come boost of energy from yoga with weights, as well as a reduction of stress
in their lives.
Yoga with weights, like all forms of exercise, releases endorphins in your 
body — the natural feel-good chemicals that give you a sense of well-being
(the Greek root for the word endorphin is the same as the root for morphine).
Exercising helps you sleep better, and sleep and endorphins are natural anti-
dotes for depression.
Yoga with weights also helps combat depression because the attention you
pay to breathing opens up your chest and allows your lungs to fill with life-
giving oxygen. This improves your circulation and opens up your heart, so to
speak, making you feel happier. Stop what you’re doing right now, just for a
moment, and take a deep breath. Do you feel a “big smile on your chest?”
288
Part V: Addressing Special Situations 

Handling premenstrual syndrome
By some estimates, four in ten women and as many as 70 to 90 percent of
women of childbearing age have premenstrual syndrome, or PMS. A bal-
anced, nutritional diet and proper amounts of exercise may be the keys to
reducing PMS symptoms. Yoga with weights can help lesson the symptoms
because the squatting exercises deliver more blood to your pelvic floor, the
endorphins released during the exercises combat depression, and the breath-
ing techniques help you to relax and de-stress. (Be sure to read Chapter 13 to
address your diet.)
A Special Workout for Expecting Mothers
Whatever decision you make about how you want to give birth, yoga-with-
weights exercises can gently help you prepare for the big event by making
you stronger and increasing your ability to focus and concentrate. In addi-
tion, the exercises help you maintain a high energy level after the baby is
born and help you get back into shape.
The exercises we present here are designed to help prepare pregnant women
for labor and condition them mentally and emotionally for giving birth. Even
if you walk for only a few minutes every day and adopt the breathing and
mindfulness techniques you find in this book (see Chapters 4 and 5), you’ll
feel and look your best during and after your pregnancy. The yoga-with-
weights exercises in this chapter help strengthen your back, make you com-
fortable while you’re pregnant, and prepare your pelvic floor for a healthy
delivery when the time comes to give birth. Use the last exercise as an affir-
mation to plant the seeds of well-being and make yours a joyous childbirth.
Before beginning any new exercise program, pregnant women should consult
with a health professional or primary prenatal care physician, especially if
they have pregnancy-induced high blood pressure, early contractions, or
vaginal bleeding. The exercises we’ve designed for pregnant women are slow,
comforting, and relaxing exercises. Nevertheless, exercising can pose risks to
pregnant women, especially those in or beyond the sixth month of their preg-
nancies. In our experience, pregnant women who have permission from doc-
tors to exercise have no trouble doing standing yoga-with-weights exercises
and poses that require you to have the support of a chair. Starting at the
sixth month, however, you may need to stop doing exercises that require
lying on your belly or back. Twisting exercises also aren’t recommended for
pregnant women, so to be on the safe side, we don’t offer twisting exercises
in this chapter.
289
Chapter 17: Girl Talk

Exercise gently when you’re pregnant. Notice any signals of discomfort, and
stop doing an exercise if it doesn’t feel right. You want your workout to gently
relax your whole body, leaving you with a peaceful sense of well-being.
Be sure to read Chapter 4, which offers yoga breathing techniques. During
childbirth, the power of the breathing (and the controlled state of mind that
breathing can bring about) may help to slow down or speed up your labor as
necessary. Breathing can help you smoothly ride out the waves of labor,
which is why Lamaze and Bradley classes teach breathing techniques for
expectant mothers. These breathing techniques train mothers to relax during
delivery.
Courage and Strength
The purpose of Courage and Strength is to prepare you for childbirth by
giving you the tools and techniques necessary to build your courage and
strength. You have to remember that courage isn’t the absence of fear, but the
ability to proceed skillfully, moment by moment, with conviction and clarity.
290
Part V: Addressing Special Situations 
Yoga breathing and childbirth
Sherri Baptiste is the mother of four children.
Here’s what she says about yoga breathing and
childbirth:
“I was always surprised to hear, while I was
giving birth, that I have a high threshold for pain.
What I really have is an understanding of the
power of yoga breathing and an ability to har-
ness that power. During labor, I was able to stay
calm as the contractions intensified. I com-
pleted labor without the use of any drugs.”
“Throughout labor, I felt that I had yoga breath-
ing as a tool and a friend to help me in the chal-
lenge to stay calm and be present. Yoga
breathing took the edge off as the waves of pain
grew stronger and stronger with each contrac-
tion and the forces of labor took over. In each
phase of delivery, the power of the breathing
allowed me to draw my attention and all my
strength into the moment and into what I was
doing.”
“I’m no hero or saint when it comes to pain. I 
felt it every inch of the way as those babies of
mine — two daughters and two sons — worked
their way out into the world. I was one of those
women who didn’t look forward to labor. I just
wanted to get it over with as quickly, safely, 
and painlessly as possible — but without any
drugs.”
“I learned from giving birth that, realistically
speaking, the mother is just along for the ride.
You have little control over any of it. But you do
have the power within yourself — breath by
breath, moment by moment — to help nature
direct your childbirth and support your ease and
well-being. Yoga breathing can be your best
friend, especially when you’re giving birth. It
can help you to better manage the pain of child-
birth, harness the strength you need, and dis-
cover the timeless wisdom that every woman
carries within herself to give birth and become
a mother.”

This exercise helps train you to focus during childbirth, opening your heart
and mind to the process at hand. It strengthens your back and spine and
shows you how to open your pelvic area. It also strengthens your arms so
you can carry your baby easily after you give birth. You’re going to have to
do plenty of multitasking: holding your baby, preparing the bottles, unloading
grocery bags, and so on. It helps to have strong muscles!
Use the lightest hand weights you have for this exercise. Also, grab a blanket.
Follow these steps to find your courage and strength:
1. Sit on the floor with your right leg straight, your left foot next to the
inner thigh of your right leg, and a folded blanket under your left
knee.
If you’re well along in your pregnancy, place your right leg to the side to
comfortably accommodate your belly. You can also place a blanket
behind your buttocks, as the model in Figure 17-1 has, for support in
case you lose your balance.
2. Pick up the weights and hold them at ear level or a bit higher with
your elbows bent (see Figure 17-1a).
This is the starting position. Look straight ahead. How high you lift the
weights depends on how high you can comfortably hold them.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, lift your arms up (see Figure 17-1b).
Weightlifters call this a shoulder press. Don’t strain; make sure you stop
at a comfortable level.
4. Exhaling to a count of four, lower your arms to the starting position
(see Figure 17-1a).

Chapter 17: Girl Talk

Repeat this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest for as long as you need,
and then do six to eight more repetitions with your left leg straightened.
Opening the Way
Opening the Way is an exercise that helps to prepare your pelvic girdle for
childbirth by opening your groin and supporting the relaxation and release in
your pelvis. The pelvic girdle is the boney structure surrounding your pelvis.
During vaginal childbirth, the baby passes through the opening in the pelvic
girdle. The exercise also strengthens and tones your upper torso, including
your back and spine, and teaches you to breathe fully by encouraging good
posture. Breathing properly with good posture is a big help during childbirth,
when comfort matters so much.
Grab your lightest hand weights and two folded blankets for this exercise.
Follow these steps to open the way:
1. Sit cross-legged on the floor with a folded blanket under each knee
and your hands, holding the weights, resting on your knees with your
palms facing upward (see Figure 17-2a).
This is the starting position. Look straight ahead.
2. Inhaling to a count of four, bend your elbows (see Figure 17-2b).
Weightlifters call this a bicep curl. Feel your bicep muscles working.
Make sure your elbows stay close to your ribs.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, slowly lower the weights to the starting
position (see Figure 17-2a).
Repeat this exercise six to eight times, pause to rest for as long as you need,
and then do six to eight more repetitions.

The Mother Goddess
The Mother Goddess helps prepare your pelvic girdle for childbirth by condi-
tioning and toning the muscles surrounding it. The exercise also strengthens
your legs, inner thighs, and back; conditions you to stay steady and bal-
anced; and trains you to be able to breathe in a consistent way when the
rigors of childbirth are challenging you.
You need hand weights for this exercise. If you’re afraid of tipping over, you
should grab a folded blanket as well, which you can put under your heels to
give you more support when you squat (shown in Figure 17-3a). Follow these
steps to complete the Mother Goddess exercise:
1. Squat on the balls of your feet with your elbows against your knees
and your hands joined in front of your chest (see Figure 17-3a).
This is the starting position. Keep your knees wide to accommodate
your belly. Hold this position for three or four calm and steady breaths
before proceeding.
If you have trouble squatting and keeping your balance, do this exercise
with your back against a wall, or sit on a low stool to start this exercise.
2. Slowly inhaling to a count of four, pick up the hand weights, rise to
your feet — keeping your knees slightly bent — and raise the weights
above your head (see Figure 17-3b).
Widen your stance by a couple of inches to get into this position.
3. As you continue to inhale, keep rising until your legs are straight 
(see Figure 17-3c).
4. Slowly exhaling to a count of four, gently and smoothly return to the
starting position (see Figure 17-3a).
Spread your knees, pressing your tailbone gently downward as you
squat down.
Repeat this gentle squat and rise six times, pausing to rest between each rep-
etition, and then repeat the exercise, if desired, another six times.

Ending meditation: Divine 
Mother Affirmation
The purpose of the Divine Mother Affirmation is to center you and to teach
you how to relax and calm your mind on your own. You’re talking to yourself
in a good way — like a coach sending the right message to be well and in har-
mony with it all. This practice isn’t as much an exercise as it is a quiet medi-
tation designed for expectant mothers.

You need three folded up blankets for this exercise. When you’re ready,
follow these steps to do the Divine Mother Affirmation:
1. Sit cross-legged (or as near to cross-legged as you can) in a comfort-
able way, with one blanket under your buttocks and one under each
knee.
You can sit with your back against a wall if doing so makes you more
comfortable.
2. Close your eyes and join your palms over your chest in a prayer pose
(see Figure 17-4).
3. Quiet your mind and commune with yourself.
Quietly meditate for a moment on the life that’s growing inside you.
Listen to the gentle sound of your breathing. Silently repeat these words
to yourself: “Breathing in, I calm body and mind, and breathing out, I
smile; so be it.” Feel free to pick your own words that take you to a state
of greater well-being.

Chapter 18
Exercises for Seniors
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the benefit of yoga with weights for seniors
 Improving blood circulation throughout your body
 Strengthening your spine and improving your range of motion
 Concentrating on your coordination and focus
N
o matter your age, yoga-with-weights exercises can help you stay
strong and supple. Therefore, we’ve designed the exercises in this
chapter specifically for seniors. Here, you find a workout that emphasizes the
importance of stretching, relaxing, and strengthening for promoting the gen-
eral health and well-being of seniors. Still not convinced? Okay, the exercises
also slow down and prevent premature aging!
You need a sturdy chair for the exercises in this chapter. The chair gives you
confidence and makes you feel stable as you exercise so you can dive in with-
out worrying about whether you’ll lose your balance or fall. The chair should
be short enough so you can sit on it without leaving your feet dangling. If
you’re short, you may need to place a footstool under your feet. The chair
should have a strong back, because you need to grasp the back of the chair
in some exercises.
To get the most from these exercises, maintain a concentrated focus on the
alignment of your spine. Imagine or visualize your spine lengthening and
realigning as you gently breathe in each exercise. We also ask you to take
gentle, empowering, Complete Breaths as you do this workout (Chapter 4
looks into all aspects of breathing). Take your time not only with each exer-
cise, but also with each inhale and exhale. Breathing is a barometer of how
you’re doing. If you’re breathing too rapidly or holding your breath, you’re
probably working too hard, but if your breathing is steady and calm, you’re
probably working just right.

Use light weights to start. As you get stronger, gradually increase the size of
the weights. Always work at your own level of ability and take into account
the energy you have that day.
Reaping the Rewards of 
the Senior Workout
An old saying in the yoga tradition says that you’re as youthful as your spine
is supple and flexible. The exercises in this workout increase the strength
and suppleness of your spine. It feels great to have a limber spine that’s free
to move in all directions, but a spine that moves with ease is important for
safety reasons, too. For example, you’ll be able to sit on the floor and get up
without assistance, and you’ll feel more youthful so you can do the physical
activities that you really love.
The exercises in this workout also increase bone density. An excessive loss of
bone density in the process of aging leaves your bones weakened and sus-
ceptible to fracturing and breaking. However, we have good news: Bone is
living tissue, so it’s in a constant state of regeneration. In a yoga-with-weights
workout, your muscles have to work against the weights you carry, which
puts stress on your bones and therefore increases bone density. You increase
blood circulation to your muscles as well, which also builds bone density and
muscle strength. You focus on keeping your body strong and upright, and
you do exercises that are very gentle on your joints and connective tissues.
Along with building up your bone and muscle, the exercises in this chapter
improve your coordination. Maintaining good coordination reduces your risk
of falling and allows you to be more confident and sure of yourself.
People of all ages feel the natural urge to skip a workout now and then. In the
case of seniors, however, the body needs more rest and repose on certain
days, so you need to pay attention to those needs. But as much as you can,
try to stay on track and do these exercises every other day. By consistently
practicing these yoga-with-weights exercises, by paying attention to your
breathing, and by following the meditation practices we describe in this book
(see Chapter 6), you discover more physical freedom in your daily move-
ments and in your life. You gain the confidence to be able to move with ease.
When you begin to practice the exercises, you’ll notice a greater level of
mobility and strength. And the exercises help you maintain the strength and
mobility that you already have, giving you healthy support for years to come.
298
Part V: Addressing Special Situations 

Never force yourself or push too hard as you do this workout; use your expe-
rience to recognize when you should rest or press forward. The goal is to
challenge yourself to do the exercises with a little more intensity and concen-
tration each time you do them.
Candle Blowing
Candle Blowing warms you up for all the exercises in the senior yoga-with-
weights workout. Although the exercise’s name may conjure up images of
cake, we call it Candle Blowing because we want you to focus on your breath-
ing. Throughout the exercise, you breathe in and out with pursed lips as if
you’re blowing out the candles on a birthday cake. As you concentrate on
your breathing and warming up your body, you work your bicep muscles and
increase your blood circulation.
You need hand weights for this exercise. When you’re ready to go, follow
these steps:
1. Sit in a chair with your elbows bent and the weights held at your
thighs, palms facing upward (see Figure 18-1a).
This is the starting position. Sit upright with your shoulders squared,
but don’t allow your shoulders to creep up to your neck. Purse your lips
for the proper breathing technique.
2. Exhaling to a count of four, curl the weights to the level of your shoul-
ders (see Figure 18-1b).
In weightlifting, this action is called a bicep curl. Pull your belly in, and
use your belly as well as your arms to support the weights. Feel the air
leave your lungs as you exhale.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, lower the weights to the starting position
(see Figure 18-1a).
Inhale slowly and deeply into your abdomen as you slowly lower the
weights in rhythm with your breathing.
Repeat this exercise four to six times, pause to rest, and then do four to six
more repetitions.
299
Chapter 18: Exercises for Seniors

The Mirror
The Mirror opens your chest and lungs, as well as the sides of your body,
aiding in free breathing and improved flexibility. It also creates better range
of motion in your neck and shoulders, making the exercise excellent for
people who suffer from stiff necks and “frozen shoulders.” Having more room
to breathe deeply makes it easier to relax.
You need hand weights for this exercise. When you’re ready, follow these
steps:
1. Sit in a chair with your elbows bent and the weights held at your
thighs, palms facing upward, and fix your gaze on your right hand
(see Figure 18-2a).
This is the starting position.
2. Inhaling to a count of four, lift your right arm in a half-arc position
until your hand is above your right shoulder, watching your right
hand along the way (see Figure 18-2b).
Draw your belly in and up as you lift the weight, and reach only to a
comfortable height. If you can, raise your hand straight up, as the model
does in Figure 18-2. The goal it to reach as high as you can without forc-
ing or straining.

Always keep your eyes on the weight you’re lifting. This keeps you
focused on what you’re doing.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, lower your right arm and turn your head
forward to return to the starting position (see Figure 18-2a).
Don’t slump your shoulders; keep them wide open so it feels as if your
chest is smiling.
Repeat this exercise four to six times with each arm, pause to rest, and then
do four to six more repetitions with each arm.
The Ticking Clock
Smooth, rhythmic movements are known to massage away stiffness in the
body and aid in your ability to balance. The Ticking Clock gets its name
because you move your body similarly to a clock pendulum. This exercise is
about timed movement and the timeless quality of “being.” It warms up the
sides of your body and helps your neck and spine feel more flexible. It also
stretches your shoulders and tones the muscles of your torso.

The Wave
Feeling a bit too tight and sore to surf the waves? Well, the yoga-with-weights
wave is here to help. The Wave stretches your back and spine and releases
tension from your head, neck, and shoulders. The rhythmic motion of the
exercise also teaches you balance, coordination, and stability. For muscle
benefit, the Wave strengthens and tones your abdominal muscles.
You need hand weights to do the yoga wave. When you’re ready, follow these
steps:
1. Sit in a chair with your back separated from the back of the chair and
your arms hanging down at your sides, holding the weights with your
palms facing inward (see Figure 18-4a).
This is the starting position. Look straight ahead. If your back is touch-
ing the back of the chair, you may be tempted to rely on the chair for
support, which would defeat the purpose of this exercise.
2. Exhaling to a count of four, roll your shoulders up and over as you
slowly lower the trunk of your body onto your thighs; let the weights
hang beside your body as you lean forward (see Figure 18-4b).
Allow the weights to slowly pull you down. As you exhale, slowly push
the air from your lungs so that by the time your body touches your
thighs, you’re pushing out the last bit of air.
Anchor your buttocks to the chair to keep from slipping forward.

Chapter 18: Exercises for Seniors

Your head can hang down in this position. If you can’t hang your head all
the way, hang it as far as is comfortable, or lift your head slightly as you
bend forward.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, sit up and roll your shoulders up and back
down again to return to the starting position (see Figure 18-4a).
Move your feet forward or backward if it helps you maintain your 
balance.
Repeat this exercise four to six times, pause to rest, and then do four to six
more repetitions.
The Egyptian
If your declining range of motion is starting to make everyday tasks — like
grabbing objects out of the cupboard — difficult to manage, you can fight
back with exercises like the Egyptian. This exercise tones and strengthens
your back, arms, chest, and shoulders. It also expands your chest and gives
your shoulders a wider range of movement.
Draw your belly in and up throughout this exercise. Engaged belly muscles
help you lift the weights and maintain stability.
To do the Egyptian, you need your hand weights. When you’re ready, follow
these steps:
1. Sit in a chair with your arms hanging down to your sides, the weights
in your hands, and your palms facing inward (see Figure 18-5a).
This is the starting position. Look straight ahead. Don’t shrug your
shoulders, lean against the back of the chair, or lean forward during this
exercise.
2. Inhaling to a count of four, lift your arms out to the sides until you
join your hands above your head (see Figure 18-5b).
Rotate your hands so that your palms are facing upward by the time
your arms are halfway lifted. Look up so that you’re gazing at your
hands above your head.
If you can’t reach above your head, lift your arms as high as you com-
fortably can.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, slowly lower your arms to the starting
position (see Figure 18-5a).
Rotate your hands again as you lower your arms so they end up facing
inward at the starting position. Lower your gaze so that you’re looking
straight ahead as you lower your arms.
304
Part V: Addressing Special Situations 

Repeat this exercise four to six times, pause to rest, and then do four to six
more repetitions.
The Pigeon
The yoga-with-weights Pigeon isn’t like those pigeons in the park that eat your
picnic food and chirp away your peace and quite. This Pigeon increases the
range of motion in your hips — if you’re tight in this area, the Pigeon opens
you up. The exercise also increases blood circulation to your hips and pelvic
girdle, which helps you when you’re climbing stairs or walking your dog.
Don’t attempt this exercise without the permission of your primary caregiver
if you’ve recently had a hip replacement.
Pick up both your hand weights and grab one ankle weight for this exercise.
When you’re ready, follow these steps:
1. Sitting in a chair, place your right ankle over your left knee, and place
the ankle weight on your right thigh.
The ankle weight helps anchor your thigh in place. By placing one leg
over the other, you open and stretch out your hip and groin.

Chapter 18: Exercises for Seniors

If you can’t lift your ankle onto your knee, cross your ankles instead or
put your foot on a footstool.
2. Grab your hand weights, separate your arms as far apart as you can,
and lift them to shoulder height with your elbows bent and palms
facing forward (see Figure 18-6a).
This is the scarecrow position, and also your starting position. Make
sure your spine is erect and that you’re relaxed.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, lift your arms overhead (see Figure 18-6b).
Lift to a place that’s comfortable for you. In weightlifting terminology,
this action is called an overhead press or military press.
4. Exhaling to a count of four, lower the weights to the starting position
(see Figure 18-6a).
Lower the weights slowly so you can feel your muscles working. Keep
your belly muscles engaged for stability and balance.
Repeat this exercise four to six times with each leg, pause to rest, and then
do four to six more repetitions with each leg.

The Heart Lift
The Heart Lift is a great exercise for people of all ages, but it’s especially
helpful for seniors, because it brings a balance of oxygen and blood to your
heart. The exercise opens and expands your chest and helps you to breathe
more deeply. It also strengthens your spine, abdominal muscles, and quads.
We call it the Heart Lift because the exercise brings you more joy and energy
as it opens up your chest.
You need ankle weights for this exercise. When you’re strapped up, follow
these steps:
1. Sit on the edge of a chair, and reach backward to grasp the back of
the chair with your hands.
If you can’t hold the back of the chair, hold the sides of the chair seat.
2. Roll your shoulders up, back, and down; lift your chest; and raise
your chin (see Figure 18-7a).
This is the starting position. Sink your buttocks deeply into the chair so
you can lean forward slightly. Feel the front of your body stretching, and
enjoy breathing in this position as your heart opens up.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, lift your right knee a few inches and then
straighten your right leg (see Figure 18-7b).
Press forward through your heel, and continue to hold on to the chair
for balance.
4. Inhaling to a count of four, lower your right leg to the starting posi-
tion (see Figure 18-7a).
Lower your leg slowly to the rhythm of your breathing; don’t drop it.

Chapter 18: Exercises for Seniors

Alternating legs with each repetition, do this exercise four to six times 
with each leg, pause to rest, and then do four to six more repetitions with
each leg.
The Hacker
The Hacker is a simple exercise that builds strength and flexibility in your
lower body. The exercise works your quad and hamstring muscles while
toning your belly and increasing the range of movement in your hips. The
Hacker helps build the necessary strength for climbing up and down stairs
and ladders.
Strap on your ankle weights for this exercise. Adding hand weights is an
option for people who feel strong enough (the model in Figure 18-8 explores
this option). When you’re ready, follow these steps:
1. Sit on a chair with your back separated from the back of the chair,
your feet flat on the floor, and your arms hanging at your sides 
(see Figure 18-8a).
This is the starting position. Make sure your spine is erect and your
shoulders are squared. If you want to use hand weights, hold them with
your palms facing inward.
2. Exhaling to a count of four, lift your right knee toward your chest 
(see Figure 18-8b).
Engage your belly muscles; you should feel these muscles working as
you lift. Keep your foot flexed to engage your leg muscles.

3. Inhaling to a count of four, lower your leg to the starting position 
(see Figure 18-8a).
Lower your leg slowly; keep your leg muscles fully engaged all the way
down.
Be careful not to lean forward as you do this exercise. Breathe deeply into
your lower back.
Alternating legs with each repetition, do this exercise four to six times 
with each leg, pause to rest, and then do four to six more repetitions with
each leg.
The Champion
The time has come for you to feel like a champion. The yoga-with-weights
Champion strengthens, conditions, and tones the trunk of your body, your
shoulders, and your arms; refines the integrity of your muscles; contributes
to the structure of your bones; and brings more blood to your pelvic girdle,
which helps with movement. You look like the champion of the world as you
curl your arms (just don’t wave to any imaginary crowd).
You need hand weights and ankle weights for this exercise. When you’re
ready, follow these steps:
1. Straddle the right corner of a chair seat with your bent right knee in
front of you over the chair, your left leg bent and at your side, and the
toes of your left foot curled under for support.
Your left knee should be a couple of inches from the floor in this posi-
tion. Make sure you have the hand weights in your hands at this point.
2. Twist the trunk of your body slightly to the left, and lift and extend
both of your arms to shoulder height, palms facing upward (see Fig-
ure 18-9a).
This is the starting position. Your shoulders should be directly above
your hips. Look ahead toward the arm in front of you — your right arm
in this case.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, bend your elbows and lift the weights
toward your shoulders (see Figure 18-9b).
In weightlifting terminology, this action is called a bicep curl.
4. Inhaling to a count of four, extend your arms and return to the start-
ing position (see Figure 18-9a).
Repeat this exercise four to six times, pause to rest, and turn your body to
the opposite side of the chair to do four to six more repetitions for the other
side of your body.
309
Chapter 18: Exercises for Seniors

The Body Builder
The Body Builder exercises your buttocks and tones your legs, back, and
thighs. This part of the workout builds the bone density in your back, spine,
and legs, which allows you to feel free to be active without worrying about
injury.
Wear ankle weights for this exercise. When you’re strapped and ready to go,
follow these steps:
1. Standing behind a chair, hold the top of the chair with both hands
and, bending at your waist, step backward far enough so that your
trunk and arms are parallel to the floor (see Figure 18-10a).
This is the starting position.
We suggest that you put the chair against a wall so that it doesn’t slide
when you do this exercise, which could cause you to slip and fall. (The
model in Figure 18-10 didn’t take our advice, but she’s a daredevil.)
2. Inhaling to a count of four, lift your right leg behind your body as
high as you can without straining or causing too much discomfort 
(see Figure 18-10b).
Ideally, your leg should be parallel to the floor, but if you can’t lift it that
high, don’t worry about it. You can bend your knee if you need to.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, lower your leg to the starting position 
(see Figure 18-10a).
Lower your leg slowly and gently; don’t drop it down.
Alternating legs with each repetition, do this exercise four to six times 
with each leg, pause to rest, and then do four to six more repetitions with
each leg.

The Triangle
The Triangle gives you the chance to really challenge your muscles and build
strength. The exercise stretches the sides of your body and creates strength
and stability in your arms, legs, and trunk.
You need both ankle weights and one hand weight for this exercise. When
you’re ready, follow these steps:
1. Stand behind a chair with your legs apart, your right foot pointing to
the chair, and your left foot at a 45-degree angle with respect to the
chair.
Your body should be facing left when positioned behind the chair in this
position. Your feet should be a little wider than your hips.
2. Grasp the top of the chair with your left hand; with your right hand,
hold the hand weight at your side, palm facing your body (see Fig-
ure 18-11a).
This is the starting position.

3. Exhaling to a count of four, stretch the right side of your body by lift-
ing the hand weight over and around your head. As you lift, turn your
head to the left and bend your left elbow (see Figure 18-11b).
Press into your legs as you lift the hand weight, and try to arc the weight
over the back of the chair.
If you can’t lift the weight over your body or over the chair, lift it as high
as you comfortably can, or don’t use the hand weight.
4. Inhaling to a count of four, slowly return to the starting position 
(see Figure 18-11a).
Repeat this exercise four to six times, pause to rest, and turn around to do
four to six repetitions with the other side of your body.
The Lift
The Lift is a full-body exercise that lengthens the quad muscles in your legs
and opens your groin. The exercise also tones and strengthens your spine
and chest. As it tones your lower-body muscles, the Lift also exercises 
your arms — specifically your triceps.
You need both ankle weights and one hand weight for this exercise. When
you’re ready, follow these steps:

Part V: Addressing Special Situations 

1. Straddle the right corner of a chair seat with your bent right knee in
front of you over the chair, your left leg bent and at your side, and the
toes of your left foot curled under for support.
Your left knee should be close to the floor in this position. Make sure
you’re seated firmly in the chair with your right leg.
2. Holding the hand weight with both hands, lift your hands above your
head and bend your elbows so the weight goes behind your head 
(see Figure 18-12a).
This is the starting position. Your elbows should be near your ears;
don’t drop your head.
If you can’t reach your arms back far enough, reach them as far as you
feel comfortable. You can also do this exercise without the hand weight.
3. Inhaling to a count of four, straighten your arms and raise the weight
over your head (see Figure 18-12b).
4. Exhaling to a count of four, lower the weight to the starting position
(see Figure 18-12a).
Be careful not to hit yourself in the head on the way down.
Repeat this exercise four to six times, pause to rest, and then do four to six
more repetitions.

The Seated Twist
The Seated Twist aims to wring your body out like a wet rag to make you feel
more relaxed. The exercise loosens your neck and spine and releases tension
from your shoulders and neck. It also increases the circulation in your legs,
because when you cross and uncross your legs, you stimulate blood flow.
Twisting and releasing your torso does the same.
Strap on your ankle weights and follow these steps:
1. Sitting toward the front of a chair, cross your right leg over your 
left leg.
The weights on your ankles help anchor you into the chair.
2. Place your left hand on the outside of your right knee, and reach your
right hand behind you so you can hold the back of the chair at a loca-
tion and level that’s comfortable for you (see Figure 18-13a).
This is the starting position. Draw your belly in and up for support, and
make sure that your spine is erect and your chin is slightly lifted.
3. Exhaling to a count of four, turn your back, neck, and head one verte-
brae at a time to look over your right shoulder (see Figure 18-13b).
Start your twist in the area behind your navel, and move upward in a spi-
raling direction. Imagine that your spine is twisting like a spiral stair-
case, with your mind climbing the stairs one step at a time. Twisting
with an engaged abdomen protects your lower back and neck.

You can use your left hand, holding your crossed leg back, as leverage,
which lengthens your spine and engages your core muscles even more.
4. Inhaling to a count of four, rotate your back, neck, and head to the
starting position (see Figure 18-13a).
Slowly unwind as you return to the starting position; don’t jerk.
Repeat the exercise four to six times with this side of your body, pause to
rest, and turn your body to the opposite side of the chair to do four to six
more repetitions with the other side of your body.
Ending Meditation
Before you leave this workout, we encourage you to engage in meditation for
a moment or two. Meditation requires mental focus and concentration, and in
conjunction with the exercises we describe in this chapter, it helps unclutter
your mind. Chapter 6 describes several meditation techniques. Find a tech-
nique that you enjoy and do it before you move on with your day.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
E
very chapter in Part VI offers ten tidbits of good,
rock-solid information. You find advice for getting
motivated to do your yoga-with-weights workout, explana-
tions of yoga-with-weights myths, and advice for charting
your exercise progress.
You also find an appendix in this part that lists Web sites,
magazines, books, and other goodies of interest to yoga-
with-weights practitioners.

Chapter 19
Ten Ways to Stay Motivated
In This Chapter
 Encouraging yourself to do a workout
 Patting yourself on the back for your efforts
 Setting workout goals
 Making your workout experience enjoyable
T
he hardest part of any workout is taking the first step, lifting the first
weight, or taking the first deep breath. Getting motivated is harder than
bench-pressing, harder than running through the park, and harder than any
yoga-with-weights exercise. When you’re motivated to exercise, working out
comes easy, but when you don’t feel motivated, starting your workout can
seem like pushing a boulder up a hillside.
This chapter gives you ten ways to get yourself motivated. When you can’t
seem to find the time, when you’re overcome by listlessness, or when you’re
dead tired, turn to this chapter.
A little bit each day makes a big difference! You can do as little as two or
three 30-minute yoga-with-weights workouts each week and see a significant
improvement in your health and mental state. Make the commitment, 
and you’ll feel a surge of energy and tremendous pride in what you’re 
accomplishing.
Take a Deep Breath
When you suddenly feel a lack of motivation, try taking a deep breath.
Whether you’re getting up your gumption to start a yoga-with-weights work-
out, to mow the yard, or to wash the dishes, stop for a moment to pay atten-
tion to your breathing. Take a deep, slow, gentle breath, and feel the air filling
your lungs. Relax as you feel the air exiting your lungs. Doing this helps you
take stock of yourself and build up the motivation to get started. Three to ten
deep breaths can shift the cycle of your energy and the direction of your
thinking.

Consciously breathing helps you stay more alert and focus on the present,
not on day-to-day worries, past regrets, or current responsibilities. It helps
you notice what you’re feeling at the present moment — without judgment.
And it gives you clarity so you can confront the task at hand, whatever it 
may be.
Breathing is an important — some would say essential — part of traditional
yoga and yoga-with-weights practices. We devote Chapter 4 to breathing, in
case you don’t know the proper way to breathe or if you want to discover
many different ways to breathe.
Make the Commitment to Exercise
One way to make the commitment to exercise is to make it at night before
you go to sleep. Before you hit the pillow, set your alarm clock an hour earlier
than usual, place it across the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn
it off, and put your walking shoes and the workout clothes that you like to
wear next to it. Instead of lying in bed after your alarm clock goes off and hit-
ting the snooze button, you have to get out of bed to turn the alarm off. And
because you’re out of bed, you may as well put on your exercise clothes and
shoes. You can start walking or running outside or on a treadmill right away.
(Chapter 6 lists the benefits of walking before a yoga-with-weights workout or
just for the sake of walking.)
When you’re finished warming up, choose which yoga-with-weights workout
you want to do, and get to it. Which workout you do depends on your physi-
cal, mental, and emotional needs. Every day is different, and you have plenty
of workouts to choose from in this book. You can finish most of the workouts
in 20 to 30 minutes.
Here’s another tactic to use: When you wake up in the morning, make a mental
or, better yet, written list of the things you want to accomplish during the
day, and include a yoga-with-weights workout on your list. Writing goals
down in list form helps you accomplish important tasks.
Three and four o’clock in the afternoon are good times to do a yoga-with-
weights workout, if you can find the time. Most people have a snack in the
afternoon to get their energy to complete the day, but a yoga-with-weights
workout is more energizing than a snack, and it’s healthier, too. You get the
strength for that last uphill push before dinnertime, and you feel good about
yourself because you completed your daily yoga-with-weights workout.
320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Take Care of Yourself
Taking care of your body makes you healthier and happier, which enables
you to give more of yourself to any task you want to accomplish and to other
people in your life. In the course of a day, life makes all kinds of demands on
you. Your job, your spouse, and your children all require you to be certain
places and do certain things. It may seem selfish for you to set aside these
responsibilities for a moment to focus on you, but taking care of yourself
actually has benefits for the people you love and the people who depend on
you. Nourishing yourself gives you the power and strength to nourish others.
Instead of feeling exhausted and tired (and maybe resentful as a result), you
can be a light to other people. The more you take care of yourself, the more
you have to offer others.
Celebrate the Benefits to Your Sex Life
As advertisers know, sex is a powerful motivator. Why else do so many models
appear in advertisements? You can use sex to motivate you to do your yoga-
with-weights exercises, because yoga with weights can improve your sex life.
The exercises in this book boost your metabolism and increase your ability 
to focus and concentrate. You’ll feel healthier and better, and you’ll notice
improvements in your self-esteem and stamina. All these benefits have the
effect of making you more confident and alive in the bedroom.
Another benefit to your sex life comes from the emphasis that yoga with
weights places on breathing. Many sexual techniques call on you to focus on
your breathing as a means of relaxing and enhancing the sensation so you
enjoy sex more. Relaxation occurs naturally in the breathing practices as the
body releases stress and the habitually thinking mind quiets down. You
become more receptive, present, and relaxed when you can focus on and
control your breathing. Relaxation is supportive to sexual arousal and
enhanced duration. You feel increased energy and pleasure, and you can
begin to experience the timeless quality of sexual fulfillment.
The exercises in this book show you how to control your breathing to relax
and to focus your energy. We give breathing an entire chapter in this book —
Chapter 4. We don’t mind, and we won’t tattletale, if you use the breathing
techniques in this book in the bedroom as well as the gym.
321
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Stay Motivated

Reward Yourself
Go ahead and reward yourself with a piece of chocolate when you complete a
yoga-with-weights workout. You deserve a reward, especially if the prospect
of getting a reward motivates you to exercise.
You’ll discover after you do several workouts, however, that the exercises are
rewards in and of themselves. After a 20-minute workout, you feel refreshed;
you feel like you’ve caught your second wind; and you feel alive, inspired,
and ready to take on the rest of your day.
Consider How Well You’re Sleeping
According to the National Sleep Foundation (www.sleepfoundation.org),
fewer than half of all Americans sleep long enough or well enough. Sleep
deprivation depresses your immune system, increases irritability, and slows
your reaction time. Losing sleep can also accelerate the aging process.
All forms of exercise help you sleep better, because exercise is the best anti-
dote for stress, and stress is what usually causes sleeplessness. Yoga with
weights may be the best answer to your sleep problems, because the exer-
cise program helps you relax and de-stress.
If you’re the kind of person who gets revved up on account of stress, exercis-
ing uses up your excess energy so you can sleep. If you’re the type of person
who feels overwhelmed and listless as a result of stress, exercising helps you
achieve clarity so you feel less overwhelmed and more tired. Exercise helps
regulate and balance your ability to sleep naturally.
If you wake up agitated in the middle of the night, or if you’re suffering from
insomnia, try taking the long, slow, yogic breaths we describe in Chapter 4.
Or try this technique: Lie on your bed with your eyes closed and your hands
resting on your belly. As you inhale, feel your belly expand and rise to the
ceiling. As you exhale, feel it softly contract, and visualize your belly drawing
closer to your spine. By focusing on the rise and fall of your belly as you
breathe, you still and soothe your mind. You quiet your thoughts and, in
doing so, permit yourself to fall asleep. Deep-belly breathing helps trigger the
relaxation response in your brain.
322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Set Your Sights on a Goal
You want to look good at your high-school reunion, don’t you? Many people
don’t attend their reunions because they don’t feel good about their lives and
their appearances. Yoga with weights empowers your body, mind, and spirit.
Six-month’s worth of yoga-with-weights exercises will have you looking good
and sporting a greater sense of joy and confidence to reconnect with friends
from your past. Don’t be surprised if your former classmates marvel at how
youthful you are and how little you’ve changed from your yearbook photo.
When your classmates ask, “How did you do it?” and “What’s your secret?”
you can tell them about your yoga-with-weights exercise regimen, or you can
give them a wink, shrug your shoulders, and act mysterious. It’s up to you.
Find a Workout Partner
Working out with a friend turns exercising into a social occasion. It makes
exercising more fun, and you and your friend can encourage one another to
try harder and to exercise regularly. Your friend can also be your teacher. He
or she can tell you when you aren’t lifting your leg high enough or stretching
your arm far enough. (Chapter 3 gives you tips on working out in a group 
setting.)
A little healthy competition between workout partners is a good thing. As
your partner encourages you, you’ll want to try harder. Working with a part-
ner also gives you the opportunity to be a teacher. You get to practice being
kind and encouraging when you see he or she having a hard time.
Talk to Yourself
Before you start a workout, talk yourself into it. Tell yourself about all the
health benefits you’ll enjoy after your yoga-with-weights workout. And give
yourself a pep talk in the middle of a workout when you start to wilt. Tell
yourself that you have only a few more exercises to go, and remind yourself
that it’s only a matter of minutes before you catch your second wind. Think
about how good you’ll feel when you finish. Recall the feeling of pride and
satisfaction you always get from a good workout.
Sometimes in the middle of a workout, a demon perches on your shoulder
and tells you how tired you are and how easy it would be to quit right now.
Put aside this kind of unhealthy self-talk. Shake off the demon and forge
ahead.

Ten Myths about Yoga 
with Weights
In This Chapter
 Knowing what yoga with weights is and isn’t
 Understanding the yoga-with-weights prerequisites (if there are any)
 Discovering how weights fit in with the yoga practice
S
ome people hear the word “yoga” and think of swamis or men in loin-
cloths meditating on mountaintops. We respectfully suggest that
modern-day yoga is quite different from this image. Yoga, like yoga practition-
ers, is flexible, which explains why it can branch off into separate but related
disciplines such as yoga with weights. The discipline has one foot in modern
times and one foot in ancient India. But because yoga originates in India, a
foreign and exotic land, a few myths have evolved around the practice. This
chapter aims to dispel these myths and show how yoga has been trans-
formed over the years into a new discipline.
You Must Be Flexible
It’s easy to see why some people believe you must be a contortionist to study
yoga or yoga with weights. Books and magazine articles about yoga invari-
ably show photographs of people twisting themselves into pretzel-like posi-
tions and poses.
After looking at the photographs, some people conclude that you must be
flexible, and we mean really flexible, to practice yoga. People who can’t touch
their toes or have trouble widening their shoulders may conclude that yoga
with weights isn’t for them.

Most of the people you see in the photographs, however, have been studying
yoga for years. When they started their yoga adventures, they may not have
been able to touch their toes. As you’ll discover after you do yoga-with-weights
exercises for a few weeks, flexibility isn’t necessarily something you’re born
with. Even if you’re stiff as a board, you can become flexible with persistence
and practice. In our yoga classes, we’ve seen students who could hardly bend
over without creaking like a rusty gate turn into graceful, flexible yoga practi-
tioners. It happens all the time. With a little practice, the caterpillar can turn
into a butterfly.
If you’re not flexible, you’re an ideal candidate for yoga with weights. Start
slowly, never force your body, and work at your own level of ability. Be con-
sistent, and you’ll see change. Improving your flexibility also improves your
circulation, straightens your posture, makes you stronger, lowers the risk of
muscle strains, decreases your risk of bodily injury, and, most important of
all, enlarges your capacity to enjoy life. Yoga helps you gain flexibility not
only in your body, but also in your mind and heart.
You Can’t Balance While 
Holding Weights
Balance is an essential part of the yoga-with-weights discipline. Balancing
teaches you to focus and concentrate, helps align the muscles of your body,
and improves your posture. People who have had yoga lessons or are familiar
with yoga see the weights and may say to themselves, “That’s not yoga. How
can you balance with weights in your hands and weights on your ankles?”
However, we believe that carrying a small amount of additional weight actu-
ally brings more balance to the yoga discipline. The extra challenge of bear-
ing the weight makes you stronger and challenges your ability to concentrate
even more. You have to pull deeper into the core muscles of your trunk and
torso as you balance, which makes your core muscles stronger.
Yoga-with-weights exercises require you to hold 1- to 5-pound weights in your
hands or strap them on your ankles (you can choose which amount of weight
you want in each exercise). You’ll be surprised to discover how much inten-
sity, improved focus, and balance this small amount of weight brings to the
yoga discipline.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Yoga Is a Religion
Yoga comes from the Sanskrit word yuj, which means “to join” or “to unite.”
The yoga practitioner should unite the body and the mind to achieve self-
realization. In India and in some yoga studios in the West, yoga practitioners
burn incense, display statues of deities, and chant. All this can make yoga
sound and feel like a religion, but in reality, the Indian trappings are part of
the mystique, spirituality, and charm of India expressing itself freely in yoga
studios. They aren’t religious manifestations. The bottom line is that yoga
comes from a rich and varied spiritual tradition. Connecting with that tradi-
tion brings a certain depth to your study of yoga with weights. Can you prac-
tice yoga without all the trappings? Absolutely. And we’re here to prove it
with the yoga-with-weights workout.
The yoga practice does offer a system of philosophy to support mental clar-
ity and awareness, emotional balance, and physical well-being. Yoga is the
oldest known system of self-development. It carries the philosophy of “any-
thing is possible.” The real beauty of yoga is that it supports your everyday
living in practical and real ways. Yoga isn’t a religion; it’s a spiritual lifestyle.
Depending on what you want to make of it and how deeply you want to
explore the ancient discipline and practices, yoga is more of an exploration of
self, a journey of discovery, and a path to enhance your awareness and con-
nection to life.
In the beginning, most people come to yoga with weights to improve their
health or to try out a novel form of exercise. Over time, some casual practi-
tioners discover the spiritual aspects along with the physical benefits of
yoga. The physical benefits speak for themselves. As your body thrives in the
yoga practice, your mind clears. Life becomes an opportunity to grow and
develop yourself. Yoga with weights can quiet your mind and help you get in
touch with yourself and your surroundings. It can give you spiritual clarity,
but the discipline doesn’t take away from any faith or religion that you
believe in; it only empowers you to be discerning and to find out what’s best
for you. Practicing yoga doesn’t keep you from practicing the religion of your
choice; it enhances all the things you’re interested in and gives you more
energy to enjoy these things.
You Must Be a Vegetarian
Yoga originated in India, and for that reason it carries with it many associa-
tions with that nation, one being vegetarianism and the principal of not harm-
ing any living being. Still, you can practice yoga with weights without being a
vegetarian. Vegetarianism and the choice of foods you eat are personal
choices. Some of the greatest yoga teachers are vegetarians; other great
teachers eat meat. You can practice the yoga-with-weights system without
adopting any of the customs or beliefs that are associated with yoga.
327
Chapter 20: Ten Myths about Yoga with Weights

Traditional yoga emphasizes that your body is wise and that you should
listen to your body. Yoga is a system of self-knowledge, so it’s up to you to
explore and balance your body’s health with the right foods that work for
you. Use the tips and suggestions we provide in Chapter 13 to improve your
diet. If you feel that you need the protein from meat for energy, feel free to eat
meat. And if you decide that the cleansing benefits you get from eliminating
meat from your diet are necessary for your health, you can stop eating meat
and adopt a vegetarian diet. The choice is always yours.
Yoga with Weights Is for Super-Trendy
Health Freaks
Some of the people who practice yoga are super-trendy health freaks. You
know the type: the tall, toned, lean, slender, buff body; the trendy clothes
made with hemp or fabrics imported from India; and the intricate tattoo 
running down the spine.
Yoga has become a multi-billion-dollar industry in the past decade.
Celebrities such as Madonna practice yoga. You can see fashionable people
in loose-fitting “yoga wear” on the streets of Beverly Hills and other chi-chi
locales.
We hope that these trendy trappings don’t prevent anyone from trying yoga
with weights. Yoga is at least 5,000 years old, it defies fashion trends, and it
has permanent appeal. Don’t be afraid to try it because you’re not a super-
trendy health freak.
Yoga Makes You Wimpy
Yoga has a reputation for being a passive form of exercise, even if you add
weights. It isn’t a competitive sport (although it helps you to identify your
issues with competition and how these issues may be getting in the way of
real success; see Chapter 16 for more on yoga with weights and sports). Yoga
practitioners don’t get pumped-up angry or roar at their opponents, because
they don’t have opponents. Furthermore, the idea behind yoga with weights
is to build strength from within, not to build strength by struggling with an
opponent or a piece of exercise equipment.
328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

On the other hand, yoga isn’t really a passive form of exercise. It organizes
your strength, internal energy, and awareness. Yoga builds strength in areas
that other exercise programs don’t come near. It builds self-confidence,
quiets your mind, and helps you find your own direction. You develop your
inner as well as your outer strength. Does that sound wimpy to you? Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, John McEnroe, and Dan Marino don’t think so. These profes-
sional athletes practiced yoga in their playing days and continue to practice
it now.
You Have to Be Very Coordinated
You’ve probably seen photographs of a yogi standing on one leg, with his
other leg tucked into his groin and his hands spread wide. Many yoga-
with-weights exercises require you to balance this way, and seeing the 
photographs may lead you to believe that you have to be very coordinated 
to do yoga-with-weights exercises.
We’re happy to report that balancing, like flexibility, is an acquired skill. Day
by day, exercise by exercise, you get better at balancing. You don’t have to be
coordinated to begin with, because the exercises teach you to be coordi-
nated. Many students have come into our classes unable, for example, to turn
their bodies without leading with their eyes. This is a sure sign that these stu-
dents have been coursing their way through life with levels of unconscious
movement that challenge their bodies to try to keep up with their eyes. This
can be exhausting, cause chronic discomfort, wear out the body before its
time, and cause mental exhaustion. The balancing exercises we instruct have
taught these students how to trust their bodies and move themselves with
self-assurance and poise.
Balance is one of the overlooked benefits of the yoga-with-weights exercise
regimen. The balancing exercises teach you how to use different muscles in
consort — how to flex some muscles and relax others. The purpose of bal-
ancing exercises is to help you explore your sensory pathways and the mus-
cles of your body while strengthening both. Balancing is an important part of
the yoga-with-weights goal of making you more self-aware of and confident in
your body.
329
Chapter 20: Ten Myths about Yoga with Weights

You Have to Go Away to Do It
You can find beautiful descriptions of yoga retreats all over the Internet. In
fact, we occasionally lead yoga retreats to exotic places (see the appendix for
some listings). As wonderful as these yoga retreats are, they’ve led some
people to the erroneous idea that you can only do yoga exercises at retreats
or spas, or that you have to go away to create the right environment to prac-
tice yoga.
You can do your yoga-with-weights workout anyplace in the world where 
you can find a few square feet of exercise space. Except for thumb twiddling,
which requires even less exercise space, yoga is the most mobile of all exer-
cise programs. You can do it in a hotel room, on the beach, or in a tree house.
All you need is the will to start exercising and a few square feet of flat ground
or floor space. (See Chapter 3 for tips on creating your own workout space.)
You Must Have a Certain Body Type
You don’t have to be slim or slender to do a yoga-with-weights workout. In
fact, many traditional yogis are on the rotund side and look as if they don’t
work out regularly. Yoga practitioners come in all shapes, sizes, and ages. As
far as appearance, the only thing yoga practitioners have in common is a
healthy glow of fitness.
You Must Be Fit and Young
The myth that you have to be young and fit to practice yoga arose because
people who do yoga look young and fit — especially people who do yoga with
weights. For some people, doing yoga-with-weights exercises can be like
drinking from the fountain of youth. They make you feel younger and great
and keep you looking your best.
No age limit prohibits you from starting to study yoga with weights. If you
don’t believe us, check out Chapter 18, which shows photos of senior citizens
doing the exercises. Yoga with weights can benefit people of all ages. As yoga
instructors, we’ve been inspired many times over by our older students, who
have the vibrancy and vitality of people half their age.

Chapter 21
Ten Ways to Chart Your Progress
In This Chapter
 Monitoring your appearance and weight
 Noticing your newfound mental alertness
 Tracking your strength and stamina
H
ow can you tell if you’re making progress in your yoga-with-weights
exercise program? You can consult a tarot-card reader, or you can try
the ten techniques we describe in this chapter.
Charting your progress when you undertake a new exercise program is more
important than most people realize. In order to stick with it and know that
you’re doing it right, you need to be able to read the signs. This chapter
helps you do just that by describing benchmarks of progress for yoga-with-
weights practitioners.
Monitor Your Weight
If your yoga-with-weights goal is to lose weight, one of the surest ways to tell
if an exercise program is helping you meet your goal is to weigh yourself. If
you’re shedding pounds, take it as a sign that you’re exercising regularly and
exercising well.
When tracking your weight, weigh yourself once a week at most, or perhaps
once every two weeks or even once a month. Don’t be obsessive about it.
The problem with weighing yourself daily is that your body has natural
weight fluctuations. For example, most people gain weight on the weekend,
when they eat and rest more, so they weigh more on Monday morning than
on Friday morning. You may also gain weight when you’re on vacation, a time
when you eat differently. You may also be retaining water. If you weigh your-
self during a fluctuation and discover that you’ve gained weight, you may
become needlessly discouraged.

332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Another factor to consider when you weigh yourself is that muscle weighs
more than fat. You’re replacing the fat you’re burning with muscle, and you
aren’t losing weight for that reason in spite of exercising. Don’t be discour-
aged; be proud of your stronger body.
You lose weight when you exercise because you burn calories, but also for
another important reason: Exercising increases your body temperature,
which suppresses your appetite. When you feel the urge for a mid-afternoon
snack, do a yoga-with-weights workout first, and make sure you consume
plenty of water during the day. You’ll burn calories, suppress your desire to
eat, and eat a smaller snack.
Keep Tabs on Your Physical Energy
A sure-fire way to chart your progress is to gauge your physical energy. You’ll
feel more energized if you consistently do yoga-with-weights workouts. But
how can you tell if you have more energy? You’ll know if you have the energy
to do the activities you want to do in your daily life. Walking uphill is easier.
Housework isn’t so much drudgery. In general, you feel more joyful, happy,
and creative.
Look in the Mirror
One of these days an inventor will come up with a mirror that flatters and
wheedles. And said inventor will become a millionaire. Until the flattering
mirror arrives, however, gazing at yourself in a mirror is one of the best ways
to tell if you’re progressing in your exercise program.
Look at your complexion. Do you have a healthy glow? Is your skin shiny? 
Do your eyes sparkle? These signs tell you that you’re progressing with your
yoga-with-weights exercise regimen.
Check Your Clothes for Comfort
Isn’t it a great feeling when you put on a pair of pants that used to cramp
your waist but now feel loose? How comfortable your clothes are is another
way to mark your exercise progress. When you feel better in your clothes,
and when you don’t have to hold your breath to get into your pants anymore,
take it as a sign that you’ve lost weight and that your exercise program is
working for you.

Your waistline seems to be the measuring stick for determining whether you
fit into your clothes or have to squeeze into them, but how tight your clothes
are around your hips, buttocks, and thighs also tells you if your clothes fit.
Look at it this way: If you lose enough weight, you’ll need a new wardrobe.
Think of all the fun you can have shopping for new clothes.
Try keeping a pair of pants, a shirt, or a dress with which to measure your
success. For example, put aside a pair of pants when you start exercising,
and from time to time, as you lose weight, try on the pants and notice how
slim you’re getting.
Take Notice of What People Say
“You look great!” When someone gives you a compliment, you want to purr
like a cat. And these kinds of compliments encourage you to stick to your reg-
imen. You can chart your progress by the number of compliments you get.
Observe Your Mental Alertness
Most people associate being in shape with being physically fit, but being in
shape also means that you’re more alert mentally. Television quiz-show
answers leap into your head, whereas before you had the “I have it on the tip
of my tongue” feeling. Mentally, you don’t have to work as hard. The answers
come easier to you.
After a workout or after your walking warm-up (see Chapter 6), test how men-
tally alert you are. Compare your state of mental alertness on days when you
work out to days when you don’t work out. Can you stay on task? Does your
work come easier? Are you more creative? You’ll notice a real difference after
you practice yoga with weights.
Use a Training Diary
A training diary helps you track your exercise progress. If you put a mark on
your calendar whenever you finish a yoga-with-weights workout, you know
right away how often you work out.
333
Chapter 21: Ten Ways to Chart Your Progress

Sherri has a client who keeps a calendar in the room where she works out.
This client proudly shows Sherri each week how many times she’s worked
out and what kinds of workouts she has done. Her diary gives her a real
sense of accomplishment.
Training diaries have now entered the digital age. You can download training
diaries from the Internet. Online diaries allow you to track the different exer-
cises you do in a workout and generate graphs and charts that show how
often and how intensively you work out. Some of the digital training diaries
even work on hand-held computers.
Go to Cnet.com (www.cnet.com) to read about digital training diaries and to
download trial versions of the programs (enter Training Diaries in the search
box). The following are the leading digital diaries:
 The Athlete’s Diary: Keep track of your fitness activities. (www.
stevenscreek.com)
 BYOB-Lite: BYOB stands for “build your own body,” not “bring your own
bottle.” (www.lexabean.com)
 Exercise Diary: A “fitness-tracking” software. (www.silveronion.com)
Recognize Your Feelings of Gratitude 
and Peace of Mind
Feeling bad, we believe, can be a habitual pattern and, in some cases, an
addiction. You become so used to thinking negatively that you can’t stop
doing it, even if you know the consequences. You need to break these nega-
tive-thinking cycles and establish a new way of thinking.
Six weeks of eating right and exercising regularly seems to be the norm for
breaking negative thought patterns. Doing yoga-with-weights exercises can
really help you in this regard. The exercises create an internal shift; you can
step back from your thoughts and notice the same thought patterns appear-
ing again and again. The exercises help you let go of negativity and change
how you feel physically and mentally. You’ll feel better about yourself, and
you won’t sweat the little things.
Yoga-with-weights techniques will help to bring about a deeper connection to
the self and provide a way of helping you to pay attention to your thoughts.
Gratitude needs to be cultivated and encouraged. Be patient and give it time.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Reap the Benefits of Proper Breathing
Most people don’t breathe properly. They take shallow breaths, or they tend
to hold their breath. Yoga with weights — by strengthening your chest and
lungs and making you conscious of how you breathe — can show you how to
breathe in such a way that you relax and get the proper amount of oxygen.
(Chapter 4 looks into breathing in detail.)
If you stick with yoga with weights long enough, the moment will come when
you understand just how valuable breathing properly is. Perhaps you’ll come
to a stoplight in traffic, and instead of sighing, you’ll take a yogic breath.
You’ll feel relaxation flooding your body, and you’ll be fully present like no
time before. You’ll start noticing the details in the world around you — and
the world will look pretty nice.
Most people who study yoga have a mini-epiphany. When you discover the
value of proper breathing, consider it a benchmark moment. You’ll know
you’re making great progress in your yoga-with-weights exercise program.
Feel Your Increased Endurance 
and Stamina
If you stick with your yoga-with-weights workout, you’ll acquire more
endurance and stamina. One of the features of these exercises is that they
help you focus and concentrate, and in so doing, they help you develop
endurance and stamina. You can stay with an activity longer because you
have the strength of mind to focus for longer periods of time.
Because of your newfound stamina, you start saying “yes” to activities to
which you previously said “no.” The backpacking trip, the Proust novel, the
extra project at work — you say “yes” to these activities because you know
you can complete them and because you’re willing to try more activities. You
feel safe and confident in your own body, and you know your body will sup-
port you.
