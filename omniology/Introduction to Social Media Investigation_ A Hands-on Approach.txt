Living in Washington, DC, gives me the opportunity to interact with people who 
have a lot of very cool jobs. My friends in federal law enforcement inspired me to 
write this book, although its audience has grown to be much larger.
Thanks to HARO (helpareporter.com) for helping me find amazing sources of 
case studies and anecdotes for the book, and thanks to everyone who responded to

Big thanks to Tony Rogers who edited all the chapters in this book. This is the 
second book of mine he has edited, and once again he has improved it dramatically 
over my awkward first drafts.
Appreciation also goes to my dogs Hopper and Venkman who patiently watched 
me write this whole thing and whose need for walks gave me excuses to take a break 
from the writing. Thanks also to Carly, our foster dog, who plays a role as Malcom's 
dog “Barley” throughout this book.
Thanks also to Ingo, who was my boyfriend when I started writing this book and 
my husband when I finished, for patiently listening to all my stories without once 
accusing me of being creepy for investigating so many people online.

CHAPTER

Introduction
In the fall of 2014, a social worker made two posts on her Facebook account. Before 
heading into court, she wrote “I'm in court tomorrow for a case where there is a high 
level of domestic violence amongst many things….” The next day, when she came 
out of the trial, she said “It's powerful to know that … children's lives have just mas­
sively changed for the better and now they are safe and protected from harm and have 
every hope for the future….”
The mother of the child in the case found these posts after looking up the social 
­
not. They also included a map showing the location of the courthouse from which the 
last message had been posted. The mother filed a complaint, claiming the posts were 
a violation of confidentiality rules, and the social worker was sanctioned.1
This is an example of a social media investigation by a private citizen that led to 
real consequences. Although the outcome itself might be debated further, it neverthe-
less shows the power of social media as an investigative tool.
This book will show you how to find people on social media, what types of data 
are available on different sites, how to access the information on the most popular so-
cial media sites, and introduce some advanced techniques for understanding people 
­
Social media can connect people and help them maintain and support relation-
ships from all parts of their lives. It lets us share and interact with one another in 
countless ways. People can use social media to build up and portray their online 
identity—sharing everything from major life events to what they ate for breakfast 
this morning. All that sharing and interaction leaves behind a long, complicated, and 
­
of behavior, and actions. That makes social media a powerful tool for investigators.
Just what do people share? Almost everything about themselves. Social media 
sites are full of:
•	
demographic information;
•	
lists of friends, family, and associates;
­	
•	
maps showing places a person goes and how frequently;
•	
time-stamped posts that indicate where a person was and when; and
•	
the content of the posts themselves, where people detail their thoughts, feelings, 
and ideas.

CHAPTER 1  Introduction
Why might you do an “investigation” online? Law enforcement and lawyers in 
civil suits certainly want to gather information on suspects or the opposing side of a 
dispute. Journalists may want to learn more about sources or subjects of their report-
ing. Businesses want to learn about the people they might hire or how well their cur-
rent employees are representing the company. Parents may want to check up on their 
children to be sure they are interacting safely, though, just as frequently, adult chil-
dren may want to check up on older parents to be sure they are not getting scammed.
This book is intended for all these groups. Professional investigators will find 
guidance for extending their skills into the social media arena. People who are new 
to investigating will find tips and examples that will help them get started with basic 
investigations while also mastering new online skills.
Individuals have countless reasons for wanting to find out more about others. 
They may worry about stalking. They may desperately want to get in touch with 
someone for whom they have very little information. Or, they may want to run their 
own background checks on people they let into their lives.
During the process of writing this book, I spoke to dozens of lawyers, investiga-
tors, law enforcement officials, journalists, and others who have used social media in 
their investigations. They provided a wealth of stories and examples of how it could 
be used. But without any prompting, all of them talked about how useful social media 
was as a source of information.
Lisa Helfend Meyer, of Los Angeles-based family law firm Meyer, Olson, Lowy &  
Meyers, uses all kinds of social media on a regular basis. “Social media can be a very 
valuable tool in your arsenal of weapons in family law.” I heard the same from every 
family law attorney I spoke to. The information that people reveal online is valuable 
both as evidence and as preemptive information that can guide the direction of a case.
The open, public nature of social media makes all this possible.
Dusty Lefdal, an investigator at Employers Investigative Services, issues an im-
portant warning. He says:
Social media has helped us during all kinds of investigations. Always be wary of 
using the information, especially if you are not sure it belongs to the individual 
you are looking for. You would be surprised at similarities between people. A 
trained professional should always be consulted and social media should never, 
ever be used solely and upon itself. It's simply a tool in a box full of investigative 
tools.
He's right. It quite easy to mistake one person for another online, and information 
needs to be analyzed carefully. A photo of someone at a party that was posted today 
might have been taken years ago; one cannot assume that all the information is cur-
rent or evidence of present behavior. Furthermore, there are no guarantees that what 
someone posts online is true. Altered photographs, exaggerations, and straight-up 
lies can be expected.
This book will explain many of the pitfalls you might face while conducting an 
online investigation. It will help you be wary of what you see and show you how 
to verify information that is important to your investigation. In short, this book's 

3
Note
purpose is to teach you how to use social media to successfully find individuals and 
information about them.
A few notes about the scope of this book….
The social media sites and services discussed here are the most popular in the 
world. However, the book does have a focus on sites more common in North America 
and Western Europe. Russia and the former Soviet republics, Asia, and South America 
all have sites that are particularly popular in those places, but are not widely used else-
where. We do not address those sites in depth in this book, but readers are encouraged 
to visit this text's accompanying website, where more details will be available.
Social media is a huge part of the internet, and on each site, there is a tremendous 
amount to learn about how to use it. This book focuses on features of each site that 
are relevant to finding and learning about individuals. This book will not provide a 
full tutorial for each social media site; features that aren't useful investigative goals 
are omitted.
Except for one chapter at the end of this book, we also won't focus on investi-
gating groups (although many of the same techniques apply). Similarly, we won't 
discuss techniques for investigating people based around some shared characteristics 
(like race, religion, gender, being a fan of a particular sports team, and reading a spe-
cific book). Again, many techniques discussed here could be used for that end, but 
we don't discuss them specifically.
The techniques described here are all ways to access information without de-
ception or violation of sites' terms of service. While it would be possible to access 
more information by creating fake accounts, making deceptive social connections, or 
writing programs to collect data, this book focuses on what can be obtained by any-
one with a legitimate account on the social media website or by publicly accessible 
information. Each chapter will detail a specific website's privacy restrictions and the 
issues an investigator might face when collecting information about a target.
Examples in this book focus on more serious situations—firings, law suits, and 
arrests. Anecdotes in these kinds of cases are more memorable and easier to find. But 
as an investigative tool, social media is also useful for general background informa-
tion that would be hard to get otherwise. There are also a few examples from my 
own online investigative work that are more “typical.” They center around finding 
background information or contact information for a particular target.
When you finish this book, you will have the skills you need to search, navigate, 
and collect information from many sources. Along the way, I hope that you will learn 
lessons for your use of social media: being mindful of what you put online, what to 
expect (or not) in terms of privacy, and how to manage your own online identity.

CHAPTER

Background and basics
Before jumping in to all the details of social media, it's useful to know the types of 
websites and services, to have a vocabulary of common features, and to understand 
the origins and landscape of the area. This chapter introduces those basics that will 
be used throughout the rest of the book.
­
This book is intended to show investigators how to find information on social media. 
It covers the basics of social media, but not the very basics of investigative tech-
­
that are worth discussing up front. Many people will recognize these as standard 
investigation techniques but may not have thought about how to translate that into an 
online environment.
Investigator Dusty Lefdal describes a technique that was commonly used among 
many people I spoke with. “Often times, we locate a target, not by trying to find the 
target themselves, but by finding their associates. This will then lead us to the target.”
Attorney Lisa Helfend Meyer agrees. In her family law practice, they often look 
at the social media accounts of clients' (and opposing parties') children to see what 
they are posting. While parents may try to keep a low social media profile, the kids 
often don't worry about this and may not even be aware that their posts can be used. 
The same is true of friends of the targets of investigation.
People also tend to be reliably uncreative in their profiles. They use the same

on one site and find information about a person on many other sites, including ones 
you have never heard of.
A BRIEF HISTORY OF SOCIAL MEDIA
The history of social media is a topic that deserves its own book, but understanding 
the major motivations and points of development in the timeline will help in under­
standing the current landscape and uses of these technologies.

CHAPTER 2  Background and basics
GENESIS OF THE INTERNET
The internet has been a social place since its invention. Work began on the internet in 
the 1960s, and the modern internet was in place by the early 1980s. In 1980, Usenet 
was created. This was an online discussion system where people could find discus-
sion boards on a topic they were interested in and then read messages from others 
and post replies.
New methods of finding community and social connection arose as the internet 
evolved to include services like CompuServe and America Online. But the biggest 
shift came with the invention of the World Wide Web, which went online in 1991.
THE EARLY WORLD WIDE WEB
The web was originally a place where a person needed a number of technical skills 
to post content. Creating a web page required knowledge of the language for writ-
ing web pages (HTML), space on a server to store the web pages, and the ability to 
upload the coded version. As such, the web's first decade was a time when people 
mostly browsed content created by others. The (relatively) small number of con-
tent creators consisted mostly of technically skilled individuals or organizations with 
teams that could put pages online.
GROWING POPULARITY
The late 1990s saw the development and release of several tools designed to make 
creating web content easier. One of the most important of these in terms of the rise of 
social media was the blog. Blogs (short for web logs) are a type of online diary. While 
it was technically possible for anyone to have created a frequently updated journal on 
the web since its invention, blog software made this much easier. Instead of writing 
code, people could author “posts” (like diary entries) using a graphical interface simi-
lar to a word processor's. The blog software would convert the post into code for the 
web, handle the organization of the site, sort posts by date, and format them.
Blogs helped millions of people to create online presences. As blogging software 
improved, it became possible for people to comment on the blog entries of others. In 
time, this created de facto communities around people's posts.
SOCIAL NETWORKS APPEAR
In the early 2000s, as blog numbers continued growing dramatically, a new kind of 
site started to appear. These sites were focused less on creating online diaries and 
more on creating online profiles. At the time, the ability to create a page about your-
self, your skills, and your interests was difficult. Blogs had empowered the masses 
to create sites in a specific category, but creating web content belonging to another 
category still required all the technical skills mentioned above. This new breed of site 
allowed people to create personal pages by simply completing a form. But it went 
one step further: people could also find any friends who were also members of the 
same system and connect to them.

7
A brief history of social media
There were a handful these new social networking sites in the earliest genera-
tion, but the most popular was Friendster. Figure 2.1 shows an image of Friendster, 
as it appeared in the early 2000s. Basic profile information appears on the right, and 
toward the bottom left is a list of friends.
This general structure—a static profile with a list of friends—was the standard 
among social networking sites for many years. Figure 2.2 shows a 2005 Myspace 
profile page, with very similar organization.
These types of sites began to gain popularity in the early to mid-2000s. By 2005, 
there were already hundreds of social networking websites, and many had over 1 
million members—quite a large number for the time.
WEB 2.0 AND THE RISE OF SOCIAL NETWORKS
Part of the reason social networks were so popular is because they made it easy for 
people to put information online. As social network sites continued to gain popular-
ity, this technology started appearing elsewhere on the web. Photo-sharing websites 
(like Photobucket and Flickr) began in 2003-2004. Soon after followed video shar-
ing, exemplified by YouTube's launch in 2005.
FIGURE 2.1
An example of how the social networking website Friendster appeared in 2003.

CHAPTER 2  Background and basics
Sites that let people organize other types of content (like bookmarks to sites they 
liked) also appeared. Appearing in 2003, del.icio.us let people share links, add labels 
to make finding them easier, and browse the shared links of others. Digg, appearing in 
2004, also let people share links but introduced the ability for others to “vote” links “up” 
or “down.” This feature helped people find new, popular content as a result of voting.
Countless websites started integrating tools to allow users to comment on shared 
content, vote them up or down, and post reviews. By 2005, there was a dramatic shift 
well under way in how people used the web. No longer were they simply browsing 
others' content. Instead, they were actively creating profiles, interacting, making con-
nections, and generating their own content.
FIGURE 2.2

left, while friends are shown at the bottom right.

A brief history of social media
This behavioral shift—often described as a transition from consumer to 
­producer—came to be recognized by the nickname “Web 2.0.” Despite criticism cen-
tered around the fact that the use of “2.0” implied that the web itself had supposedly 
undergone a software upgrade, the name stuck. Regardless, the fact remains that this 
was recognized as a paradigm shift in people's behavior on the web.
Noticing the change, social networks added what is now a fundamental part of 
many people's online experience: the status update.
At first inspection, it might seem that status updates were hardly something new; 
after all, blogs had allowed people to publish their lives' current events for years. But 
status updates were real time, (usually) brief, and almost always about what people 
were doing, thinking, reading, and watching.
In 2006, Facebook introduced the News Feed. This collected all the status up-
dates of someone's friends and displayed them on one page in chronological order. 
Visiting several friends' blogs for news seemed incredibly tedious by comparison. 
Figure 2.3 shows the early version of the News Feed on Facebook.
FIGURE 2.3

10
CHAPTER 2  Background and basics
Since then, posting updates has been a central feature of many new social media 
websites. The self-described “microblogging” site Twitter was introduced in 2007. 
It limited the length of status updates to a maximum of 140 characters.
The membership of these sites has continued to grow as well. Facebook now has 
over 1.2 billion active users—nearly half of the world's internet-using population. 
Twitter has 300 million active users but possibly as many as 850 million registered us-
ers. Social features are now the norm on websites and offer the ability to review items, 
to share links through social media sites, and to log in using social media accounts.
TYPES OF CONTENT
People can post basically anything on social media, but there are a few terms that are 
used across sites that are important to know:
•	
Updates/posts—An update is a general term for something a user posts. It tends 
to be a stand-alone piece of content, as opposed to a message in a discussion or 
a review. Often, these are short bits of text that say something a person has done, 
links to interesting content (sometimes with a comment), or photos or videos. 
They may also be called “status updates” or “posts,” or they will have names 
specific to the platform. For example, updates on Twitter are called “tweets.” We 
will cover these terms as the relevant websites are discussed in greater detail.
•	
Comment/reply—A common type of social interaction online is to comment 
on or reply to an update that someone else has posted. These are often grouped 
along with the original update so others can view the updates and comments 
together.
•	
Photos and videos—Sharing this kind of media is common online. Photos and 
videos are often shared as part of updates, but they can be uploaded separately. 
For example, many social network sites have sections where users can create 
albums and upload many photos at once.
•	
Social networks/friends/contacts—Social interaction is the heart of social media, 
and this often occurs because people have the ability to create connections with 
people they know. These may be friends, business associates, family members, or 
a mix. The connections between people form a social network.
•	
Metadata—The updates, comments, photos, and social connections people 
have form the data of social media websites. The information about those posts, 
photos, and connections is metadata. This often includes the date and time of 
the update and may include the location from which the person was posting or 
the platform (e.g., standard web browser vs. a mobile phone app) used to post.
CATEGORIES OF SOCIAL MEDIA
There are many types of social media: social networks, forums, photo sharing, re-
view sites, and more.

11
Categories of social media
A first distinction to make is between social media websites or sites and social 
media services. Essentially all social media can be accessed over the web with a tra-
ditional browser. For some, this is the only way to access them. However, some com-
panies offer other services. For example, Facebook and Google allow people who 
have accounts with them to use those accounts to log in to other websites. Figure 2.1 
shows the log-in screen on a website called ask.fm that allows people to log in with 
Facebook, Twitter, or VK (a European social network). When a company provides 
other services, like allowing people to use their accounts across the web, they are 
sometimes referred to as a social media service.
Generally, people use these terms interchangeably. In this book, we will generally 
use the term “social media site” since we are concerned primarily with the informa-
tion that can be gathered by looking at the websites in a normal web browser. If we 
look at other services that these companies offer, we will use the broader term “social 
media service.”
There are also many types of social media services based on the features they of-
fer. The distinctions we draw here are a bit artificial in the sense that there is really 
a continuum of features across sites. Deciding what category a site fits into is not 
always easy. Given that, knowing the different general categories and which sites are 
good examples of each can be useful when you are trying to understand what infor-
mation you may be able to collect about a person on a specific site:
•	
Social networks—In general, the term social network refers to people and their 
connections. This applies off-line and online. Online social networks allow 
users to create accounts and form connections with one another. Most social 
media sites have this feature, but for some, the ability to make connections and 
share with friends is the core feature.
A social networking website will have a strong emphasis on connecting 
with other people (friending them or forming a social connection). Most mod-
ern social network sites also allow people to post status updates, photos, and 
other contents. The goal behind this is usually to help people engage with their 
friends by sharing updates about their lives and links to things online they find 
interesting.
Popular sites in this category include Facebook and LinkedIn.
•	
Photo and video sharing—Sharing photos and videos is a common part of 
social media. The ability to share these types of media is built into most social 
media sites, but some sites are dedicated to this task. When you visit a photo or 
video-sharing website, the images and videos are featured, and there tends to be 
a limited amount of text.
YouTube is an extremely popular video-sharing website. Newer sites like 
Instagram, Vine, and others are also drawing populations of users.
•	 Microblogging—Blogs were created in the late 1990s as a way for people to 
easily post text online without a lot of technical knowledge. These resembled 
online diaries, and blogging is still extremely popular. Microblogging 
came about in the late 2000s. The key feature of microblogs is that people 

12
CHAPTER 2  Background and basics
are limited in how much text they can share. On Twitter, the most popular 
microblogging website, people's updates are limited to 140 characters. Other 
sites have different limits, but the core idea is that people are posting very 
short updates.
In addition to Twitter, Tumblr is a popular microblogging site.
•	
Social bookmarking—These sites are set up so people can collect links to 
pages they like online and share them with their friends. They can usually add 
annotations or captions to the links and organize them into categories.
Currently, Pinterest is one of the most popular social bookmarking sites.
•	 Social gaming—Video games used to be played alone or by people who 
were in the same place. With the internet, games can be played by friends in 
different locations. Social gaming has become very popular, and the games 
range from very simple competitions to intensive military-style team game 
playing. Major game consoles, like PlayStation and Xbox, have social features 
that let players create friend lists and play games online with those friends. 
There are also many websites and apps for mobile devices that let people play 
together.
•	
Apps—The term “app” is short for “application.” These are (often) small 
programs that run alone or within other social media sites. They can have their 
own social experiences. For example, apps that run in Facebook allow users 
to connect with some of their Facebook friends within the game, but it may 
support its own types of posts and interactions.
CURRENT SOCIAL MEDIA LANDSCAPE
Because the landscape of social media changes so quickly, in one sense, parts of this 
book are outdated before they are written. However, the core lessons about what in-
formation is available and how to find it are accurate for much longer. We also focus 
on major sites, which are likely to be around for years because they have large, active 
user bases. The structure and features of these sites may go through changes, and the 
companion website for this book will offer updates to highlight these tweaks as well 
as new content.
At the time of writing in spring 2014, the ten most popular social media sites (by 
number of users) are as follows:
	 1.	 Facebook—they report having 1.2 billion active users. It is primarily a social 
networking website but has many features, from gaming to chat to email, 
which make it the main destination for many people online.
	 2.	 Twitter—a microblogging website with around 300 million users. People 
create social connections by following people whose content they are 
interested in. Posts are called “tweets.”
	 3.	 YouTube—the most popular video-sharing website. YouTube is owned by 
Google, which in turn has a single sign-in for all of their services. Also, people 

13
Some vocabulary
can use YouTube to watch videos even if they don't have an account; thus, an 
estimate of users does not make as much sense here.
	 4.	 LinkedIn—A business-oriented network frequently used in the job market with 
250 million users.
	 5.	 Pinterest—a social bookmarking site centered around sharing images from the 
web, with 150 million users.
	 6.	 Google+—Google's social networking site designed to be a competitor of 
Facebook. As with YouTube, Google users have a single sign-in for all Google 
products (including Gmail, YouTube, and Google+). However, Google+ user 
totals around 120 million.
	 7.	 Tumblr—a microblogging website that allows sharing text, photos, and other 
media with no strict limit on the length of content (unlike Twitter). Tumblr has 
around 110 million users.
	 8.	 Instagram—A photo-sharing website especially popular among teens and 
young adult audiences. It is not owned by Facebook and is not integrated into 
the Facebook platform. Instagram has around 85 million users.
	 9.	 VK—This is the only website that isn't extremely popular in the United States. 
It is a social networking site similar to Facebook but oriented toward European 
users. It has roughly 80 million members.
	10.	 Flickr—The oldest site on this list, Flickr was one of the early, popular social 
media tools. It is a photo-sharing site with 65 million users.
SOME VOCABULARY
To make the descriptions of these investigations easier, we will use some specific 
vocabulary throughout this book.
Since our focus is on finding information about individuals, we will refer to the 
individual under investigation as a target.
There are also a number of technical terms that we will use throughout the dis-
cussion. These are all addressed in the glossary, but some will benefit from further 
explanation here. First, we will look at the basics of the internet and the web. The 
internet is a system of computers networked together, which allows communication 
around the world. Every computer on the internet has to be uniquely identified so 
information can be sent directly to it. This unique identifier is called an internet pro-
tocol (IP) address, and it comprises four numbers between 0 and 255 separated by 
dot, for example, 192.168.0.1. IP addresses can almost always be tracked to a general 
location and, with assistance from internet service providers, can even be tracked to 
a specific address. While not all social media sites display IP addresses, some do. 
Others have access to the IP address of users, which can sometimes be obtained by 
request or subpoena.
A user's computer connects to the internet through an internet service provider, 
like a cable company. When a person requests a web page, their computer sends a re-
quest through the internet to a server. A server is a computer that has web pages and 
code stored on it, and it sends these to a user's computer in response to a request. For 

14
CHAPTER 2  Background and basics
example, if a user goes to twitter.com, their computer sends a request to Twitter's 
server, which processes the request, generates the appropriate page, and then sends it 
back to the user's computer (identified by its IP address).
When a user signs up for a social media site, they usually create a name to log 
in with. This is called a username or screen name. Usernames are usually one word, 
similar to the part of an email address that comes before the “@” sign. They then cre-
ate a profile, which is a collection of personal information, often generated by filling 
out questionnaires and forms or writing short biographical paragraphs.
OUR OWN TARGET
It will be useful to practice the techniques we cover in this book on your own. To do 
that, it helps to have a target with lots of information online that you can investigate 
without worrying about privacy. To that end, we have created a fake personality who 
is very active on social media.
Our example user is Malcom Conroy-Smith. He uses the same profile picture 
on all of his accounts (see Figure 2.4). His common username is “malcomcsmith” 
though, like many people, he has a few variations on this name depending on the site.
Malcom is obviously not a real person, and all the information you will find 
on his social media profiles has been made up and posted by this book's author. 
However, it is also designed to let you find patterns in his behavior, much like you 
could find on a real target.
You are encouraged to investigate Malcom deeply. Look at his information on 
all his accounts. Search for him on Google. Read things he has posted online. It will 
be good practice for finding actual targets without worrying about invading anyone's 
privacy.

Conclusions
PRIVACY: YOURS AND OTHERS'
Privacy is important on social media, both for people who have profiles there and for 
people who are searching.
Most sites provide users with privacy options that allow them to make all their 
information public or to restrict access. Most sites allow information to be restricted 
so that only friends can view it. Some allow much more complex and fine-grained 
privacy settings. Posts can be limited to specific groups of friends or even individual 
people.
You also have privacy protections when you visit people's profiles. Some sites let 
anyone browse users' profiles, photos, or other posts, even if the browser does not 
have an account. Other sites will require you to register before you can see users' 
information. Either way, most sites do not show any information to a user about who 
views their profile. Some sites are exceptions, though. Dating websites and some 
professionally oriented websites reveal the identity of each person who has viewed a 
user's profile. These exceptions are noted throughout the book, since, as an investiga-
tor, it is important to know when your searches are private.
CONCLUSIONS
Social media is a rapidly evolving space that now touches most of the web as we 
know it. As interaction moves from something we do primarily on desktops to mo-
bile devices, these sites and services have evolved to operate in a number of different 
ways and on various platforms.
Though the sites have different features that encourage users to share and allow 
them to interact in various ways, this chapter has introduced a basic taxonomy of 
purposes that can be used to categorize most sites. We have also covered basic social 
media vocabulary that will be useful in understanding all the sites we will discuss in 
the rest of the book.

Types of personal  
information
Social media sites provide such vast amounts of information about people that it can 
be overwhelming at times. Depending on your investigation, you may want different

divide the information into different types.
This chapter will define the major categories of information that are available 
on social media and show examples of how it appears on various sites. Later in the 
­
social media sites.
BASIC DEMOGRAPHICS
Nearly every social media site has some profile page for its users, and that page has 
some essential demographic information. Age, gender, location, and a short personal 
description are all very common. Some sites have very long personal profiles, while 
others have very brief personal profiles.
Figure 3.1 shows the “About” page on Facebook, which contains the background 
information for users. The figure shows the overview, but on the left-hand site is a 
list of subcategories. On Facebook, you will often find a user's current location and 
a list of all the other places they have lived. You can get education history, work his-
­
religion, and more.
On the other hand, the microblogging site Twitter has very limited demographic 
information. Figure 3.2 shows all of what is available on Twitter: a name, city, and a 
short self-written bio.

plentiful. Figure  3.3 shows only a small fraction of the information provided on 
OkCupid. You can see data about Malcom's height, weight, build, diet, smoking 
and drinking habits, exercise regimen, religion, personal preferences for dozens of

Social connections and associates
SOCIAL CONNECTIONS AND ASSOCIATES
The “social” part of social media implies that people are interacting with others and, 
indeed, social media profiles can be an excellent tool for identifying a person's friends, 
family members, and associates. Most sites support the creation of explicit social con-
nections with other people. These tend to come in two forms: friending and following.
When one person friends another, a request is sent from the person to the poten-
tial friend. If the potential friend approves the request, then the two people are linked 
to one another. Friending generally implies a mutual relationship, and it requires both 
people to acknowledge the relationship.
Following, on the other hand, can be a one-way relationship. A person follows 
someone on social media when they are interested in what that person posts. The 
person being followed does not have to approve the relationship in most cases, nor 
is there a requirement or expectation that the follow is reciprocated. Certainly, two 
people may choose to follow one another, but unlike “friending,” it is not required.
A person's social connections, regardless of how they are created, are often vis-
ible on social media. Usually, a list of friends or followers is linked from a user's 
profile. This list tends to have a profile photo and name for the person. Figure 3.4 
shows a user's friend list from Facebook. Clicking on the names of these friends will 
take you to their profile page.
Twitter uses a follower system. For any given user, you can see lists of who he fol-
lows and who is following him back. Figure 3.5 shows the list of people that Malcom

Location data
is following. Twitter uses a more extensive set of information for each person on this 
list, including their name, bio, profile picture, and “cover” image (a background photo).
Aside from the lists of social connections, a person's photos can reveal who they 
spend time with. Many sites support photo sharing and allow you to browse a per-
son's photos. If you are interested in a person's social habits, you may find success in 
looking at who appears frequently in photos with the target.
Similarly, most sites allow people to like or comment on posts. When you read 
a target's posts, look at who frequently likes them or offers a reply. This can be an 
indicator of who the target is especially close with (not only online but also offline).
LOCATION DATA
One interesting development in social media is geotagging, which allows people to 
associate GPS coordinates or other location data with their posts. Many networks 
support this, and later chapters in this book will explain when and how to access this 
information on each site. In addition, there is an entire chapter dedicated to explain-
ing location information.
In this section, we will look at just a few examples of how this data appears. In 
Figure 3.6, which shows a Twitter post, the location information appears under the 
text of the post. “Washington, DC” indicates the location.
Figure 3.7 shows how location information appears on Facebook. In this case, it 
has the name of a place (Whole Foods Market Georgetown). Moving the mouse over 
the place name brings up a preview of the Facebook page for that place.
FIGURE 3.6

22
CHAPTER 3  Types of personal information 
Some social media sites are dedicated to sharing location information, including 
Foursquare (discussed in depth in a future chapter). Figure 3.8 shows the profile for 
a Foursquare user. This lists every place the user has logged as somewhere he has 
visited. While we only see the top of the list in this figure, the interface allows you to 
scroll through the full list of everywhere the user has ever logged in.
There are also sites that will aggregate location information for a given user and 
show it on a map. Figure 3.9 shows a heat-map produced by the site GeoSocial 
Footprint.1 When given a person's Twitter username, this site collects GPS coor-
dinates from every available post and plots it on a map. Red areas are visited more 
often than green ones. The small red flags on the map can be clicked to bring up the 
actual Twitter post that was made at each location.
There is so much that can be done with location information. It can tell you where 
a person claimed to be, when, and what they were doing there. It can also help you 
establish patterns of behavior, which is discussed more in the next section.
BEHAVIOR PATTERNS
During investigations that run deeper than collecting demographic information or photos, 
discovering behavior patterns can be important. That may be what a person does, when, 
and with whom. It could be the way they interact with others or the tone of voice they use. 
Ultimately, your questions will drive the investigation you do; but in this section, we will 
look at a few examples of how you can find behavior patterns in social media.
Consider our example user Malcom. His Facebook profile shows a map of all the 
locations he visits (more detail on accessing this is available in the Facebook chapter 
of this book). Figure 3.10 shows us a map of those locations and the number of times 
he has posted from each. There are four posts from Elephant & Castle, a bar and res-
taurant near his office. Clicking on that location brings up a list of posts he has made 
FIGURE 3.7

Behavior patterns
from there. You can click through those posts, and what you will notice if you try this 
yourself is that he posts from this location every Friday after work.
Turning to Malcom's Instagram feed, which is made up entirely of photos he has 
taken, we can see a few things in the pictures he has posted. He likes to go out and 
tell people about it, and he seems to really like his dog. The biographical descriptions 
from a number of his social media profiles mention his dog, Barley. She is clearly a 
big part of his life (Figure 3.11).
Discovering a man loves his dog is not an earth-shattering revelation, but it is an 
insight nonetheless. As we will see in many stories throughout this book, one will 
often discover that a man loves his girlfriend, or his guns, or his drugs, or is lying

to his boss and then is taking off work to play volleyball. Depending on your goals, 
those revelations can be quite important.
POSTED CONTENT
Last, but not least, is the category that encompasses most of what people share. The 
content of people's posts—that is, the text they write, what it says, the content of their 
photos and videos, and the ratings they assign—is really the most valuable thing you 
can find in a deep social media investigation. It tells you what people are doing, what 
they care about, who they interact with, and why. It not only can provide deep insight 
into the psyche but also can be useful simply because people tell you exactly what 
they think or what they do.
Indeed, when we hear stories of people being sued, fired, questioned, or arrested 
because of social media, it's almost always because of the content of their posts.
Let's look at a few examples.
SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS THAT BACKFIRE
Taylor Harrison
A Florida man posted frequently on Facebook about his drug dealing.2 It turns out 
police were checking his page and collected a lot of information about him from it. 
He was arrested and charged, and the Martin County Sheriff's Office made its own 
Facebook post about him (see Figure 3.12 for the actual Facebook post).

CHAPTER 3  Types of personal information 
WHEN SELFIES BACKFIRE
These are photos of 21-year old Taylor Harrison of Port St. Lucie bragging on his 
Facebook page about his life as a drug dealer and how easy it is for him to sell 
drugs in front of our deputies.
The first photo Taylor took himself as he pulled alongside one of our deputies. The 
second photo is a selfie of Taylor with stacks of drug cash and drugs that he says 
he sells. Notice next to his car, is a patrol car.
The third shot is a MCSO undercover camera capturing Taylor selling drugs to 
one of us. He tells us, he is the best around!
The photo to the right is Taylor's booking photo at Martin County Jail after being 
arrested for…you guessed it, selling drugs to our undercover narcotics detectives.
Since Taylor was kind of enough to share photos of us on his Facebook page, we 
thought we would share these photos of Taylor on our page.
In a similar case, another man was arrested for stealing several guns from a pawn-
shop when he asked for ammunition3 to go with them on Facebook.
Justine Sacco
One of the most high-profile cases of someone being fired for a tweet was that of PR 
executive Justine Sacco.4 In December 2013, she tweeted “Going to Africa. Hope I 
don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!” (Figure 3.13). She made the post before

boarding a 12-hour flight to South Africa. While she was disconnected during the 
flight, Twitter erupted with angry replies. Upon her arrival, she was fired.
Scott Walker
She is far from the only one, though. An aide for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's 
2012 campaign tweeted a series of racist tweets against Hispanics5 (Figure  3.14 
shows a couple), and when they came to light in the media, she was also fired.
Katie Duke
Less obviously offensive posts can also lead to bad results. Nurse Katie Duke was 
fired from New York-Presbyterian Hospital after posting this photo on Instagram 
with the caption “Man Vs 6Train… the After. #lifesaving #EMS #NYC #ER #Nurses

#Doctors #nymed #trauma #realLife” (Figure 3.15). While her post did not violate 
any rules, her supervisors said the post was “insensitive.”
THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTENT
The point of looking at all these examples is not to say “bad things happen when 
you misbehave online.” Rather, you have to look at the content of the posts people 
are making. What people actually say reveals the most about them and their actions. 
These examples demonstrate that some of the greatest insights that come from inves-
tigating people on social media do not come from canned profile fields or analysis of 
travel locations (although they can also be useful, too).
WHAT YOU (PROBABLY) WON'T FIND
There is so much you can get from social media, but there are some things you should 
not expect to be able to access as someone approaching the websites as a normal user 
(as opposed to approaching the social media companies with a court order, which is 
outside the scope of this book).
First, you will not have access to truly private conversations. Email, instant mes-
saging, and private or direct messages sent on social media simply cannot be ac-
cessed by third parties. You may see some people having conversations in public 
parts of social media. For example, they may have discussions on Twitter or through 
FIGURE 3.15

Notes
comments on a post on Facebook. These are visible to anyone and are indeed quite 
common. However, when people use explicitly private channels to communicate, 
you will generally not be able to get access.
You also won't be able to see things a user has deleted. Sometimes, social media 
companies keep copies of deleted content. As a regular user, though, you simply 
won't be able to see or bring back these deleted posts.
CONCLUSION
There are many types of information that come from social media. Major categories 
include basic demographic information, social connections, location information, 
patterns of behavior, and the content of the posts themselves. Future chapters will 
detail where and how to find all this data, but keeping in mind what type of informa-
tion will help your investigation can guide your searches in the social media space.

Privacy controls
WHAT ARE PRIVACY CONTROLS?
The “social” part of “social media” means that people are sharing with one another. 
Sometimes, it's with a very small and carefully controlled group. But more often, it's 
with large groups of people. Many social media services make users' posts available 
­
In some cases, someone may be perfectly fine with their online post being shared 
broadly. It might even be desirable: someone searching for a job may want their pro-
­
and others who make their living from gaining public attention in some way. Plenty 
of people also like the attention they get from sharing things publicly; it can be excit-
ing if a stranger likes a video or photo you posted.
But not everyone wants to share that publicly or in all contexts. Someone who 
wants to share their professional profile for a job search may prefer to keep more 
personal information (like photos of their kids and their travel schedule) limited to a 
more select group.
Privacy controls allow users the power to limit who can see their posts. Depending 
on the site, the controls vary greatly. Throughout this book, chapters about specific 
social media sites will detail their privacy settings. In this chapter, we will overview 
the major categories of privacy control options.
­
PUBLIC/PRIVATE
The simplest privacy control is the public/private setting. On sites that use this, posts 
are usually public by default and visible by anyone online. Users have one option to 
restrict visibility of their posts, and that is to make them private. This generally re-
stricts them to be visible by only the user's friends or another approved list of people. 
­
Figure 4.1 shows the Twitter privacy options. Next to “Tweet privacy” 
is the one option for protecting posts: “Protect my Tweets.” If the user selects this, 
the user has to approve anyone who wants to follow their posts.
Many social media sites use some variant of this model. As one other example, 
­
common theme) that are either public or restricted to a specific list of approved viewers.

CHAPTER 4  Privacy controls
ITEMIZED PRIVACY
On the more complex end of the spectrum, some sites give users fine-grained control 
over who can see every post. Facebook is one of these sites. Users can set the privacy 
level for each post. Facebook provides a default set of options, including Public (vis-
ible to anyone on the internet), Friends, Friends except Acquaintances (the latter be-
ing a list of casual friends that the user maintains), Only Me (which prevents anyone 
else from seeing the post), or Custom. Figure 4.2 shows these basic options.
The user can also create custom lists of friends and restrict the post to be visible to 
only people on a specific list. Examples of lists could be high school friends, fellow 
Chicago Cubs fans, coworkers, etc. The advantage of these lists is that they can be 
used to avoid bothering people with certain posts they might not be interested in. For 
example, you may want to share a link about your profession with your work friends, 
even though you know your high school friends would not have any interest in it.
Users can also create custom settings for each post. This lets the user pick a 
default group to share with (e.g., Friends) and then selectively remove others from 
Privacy
Photo tagging
Tweet privacy
Allow anyone to tag me in photos
Only allow people I follow to tag me in photos
Do not allow anyone to tag me in photos
Protect my Tweets
If selected, only those you approve will receive your Tweets. Your future
Tweets will not be available publicly. Tweets posted previously may still be
publicly visible in some places. Learn more.

access. For example, if someone rants about work, they may want to share it with 
all their friends except coworkers. In the options shown in Figure 4.3, they could 
add their list of coworkers to the “Don't share this with” list. Users can also create a 
custom list of people who can see a specific post in the “Share this with” section by 
selecting each person who gets permission to see the post.
Google+ has similar privacy features. They have made friend lists (like the co-
workers, high school friends, and fellow Chicago Cubs fans lists mentioned above) 
even more central to the design of their site. They encourage users to create “circles,” 
which are essentially lists of friends. When sharing a post, users have to explicitly 
choose which people or circles to share with. This is a bit different than most sites 
that tend to have a default setting that users can override if they choose (Figure 4.4).
DEFAULT PRIVACY
While these advanced settings are available to users, the fact is that they often are not 
used. Most users of social media sites have a default setting. They may change that 
for certain posts on Facebook, for example, but advanced customized privacy levels 
remain relatively rare.
CASE STUDY: RANDI ZUCKERBERG
Even using the relatively simple privacy settings can be confusing. This was il-
lustrated, perhaps most ironically, in 2012.1 Randi Zuckerberg, the older sister of 
Facebook founder and CEO Mark, took a photo of her family all using the ­then-new 
Facebook app called “Poke” at the same time. Mark stood in the corner with a slightly 
FIGURE 4.3

CHAPTER 4  Privacy controls
confused look on his face. Randi shared the photo on her Facebook page, with the 
privacy set to Friends Only.
A short time later, Callie Schweitzer (of Vox Media) tweeted the photo. Randi 
Zuckerberg sent her a public and angry message saying, “Not sure where you got this 
photo. I posted it to friends only on FB. You reposting it to Twitter is way uncool.”
Schweitzer took the post with the photo down, but not before many other media 
outlets grabbed a copy. However, Callie got a copy of the photo in a completely 
legitimate way that Randi Zuckerberg did not expect. Randi had tagged her fam-
ily members in the photo. Callie was a friend with another of the Zuckerberg sis-
ters. Although Randi had set the privacy level so only friends could see the photo, 
Facebook's system still allows friends of anyone tagged to see the photo as well, 
essentially making the picture more public than the original poster intended.
That the complexities of Facebook's privacy controls caused a Facebook insider's 
post to be widely shared illustrates the difficulties faced by everyone trying to con-
trol access to their content. This story also illustrates something that privacy settings 
within a system can't control: people downloading a user's posts and sharing them 
somewhere else. Randi Zuckerberg posted her family photo on Facebook, but it was 
shared widely on Twitter after Callie Schweitzer downloaded a copy and reposted it.
Indeed, it is now commonplace to see media stories with photos pulled from 
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other sources. If one person has access to the 
content within a site, that person can save a copy and share it elsewhere. No privacy 
­setting can prevent this, which goes to support the adage that once something is 
posted online, control over who sees it and how it is used is lost.
FIGURE 4.4

reminded to choose whom the post will be shared with.

Privacy awareness
PRIVACY AWARENESS
While nearly all social media sites have some privacy options and, as we have seen 
above, some have very powerful privacy settings, the average user's understanding 
of privacy controls can be limited. Statistics vary widely about how many users have 
interacted with privacy controls and how often, but a few demonstrative projects 
have illustrated—to users and others—how people are often unaware of how much 
information they are sharing.
CASE STUDY: PLEASE ROB ME
One of the first examples of this was Please Rob Me. As background, the location-
sharing social media service Foursquare allows users to “check in” at places, record-
ing their presence there. Foursquare has strong privacy protections, never sharing 
these check-ins publicly; they are always restricted to a group of approved friends 
due to the sensitivity of the information. However, Foursquare allows its users to 
share their check-ins on Twitter. Since Twitter defaults to be publicly visible to ev-
eryone on the internet, and the vast majority of users maintain public accounts, the 
result was people's locations being widely shared. Not only did this allow a user's 
movements to be tracked, but also it revealed when they left home. A simple white 
pages lookup (using their Twitter name, which is often a real name, and the name of 
their current city) would yield an address.
To highlight the insecurity of this oversharing, the Please Rob Me site was 
launched. It looked for Foursquare posts on the public Twitter feed. The list could be 
filtered by location (Figure 4.5).
There were a lot of negative reactions to Please Rob Me from people who felt 
unfairly targeted when their names appeared on it. However, the goal of the site was 
always to bring awareness to people who were oversharing. The site was not respon-
sible for the privacy problem; the users were making poor choices.
CASE STUDY: TAKE THIS LOLLIPOP
A year later, Take This Lollipop was responsible for raising anxiety levels in millions 
of people. The interactive, personalized horror film was part art project and part pri-
vacy lesson. Facebook users could go to http://takethislollipop.com and log on with 
their Facebook account. The site then plays a short film where a mentally disturbed 
stalker becomes increasingly agitated while viewing the user's Facebook page. The 
movie integrates actual information from the user's account, including photos, friend 
lists, comments, and messages. Figure 4.6 shows a frame from that movie with the 
stalker's face reflected on the monitor that is displaying the user's page.
When the site launched, people reacted by believing their accounts had been 
hacked and suggesting the site had stolen their information. In fact, the users' had set 
up their accounts with privacy settings that allowed apps to access all this data freely. 
Even stringent privacy settings often could not prevent an app from accessing some 
of this information and illustrating how vulnerable their data was.

Facebook page.

Conclusions
PRIVACY AWARENESS IMPACTS
Research has also shown that these kinds of privacy warning sites can effectively 
increase people's awareness about privacy. In a scientific study, people took a test 
where they were asked to check off which pieces of data they believed Facebook 
apps could access. They were also asked about their level of concern regarding their 
data. Then, they watched the Take This Lollipop video. When they retook the test, 
they were significantly more aware of what data was shared and they showed higher 
levels of concern about their privacy.
There is a long way to go before average users can really understand the com-
plexities of how their social media data is shared, but these two sites illustrate how 
unaware people often are about this sharing and their reactions when they find out 
that people can see a lot of what they post.
INVESTIGATING PRIVATE ACCOUNTS
If someone has made their account private, how can you investigate them? Each 
of the chapters that follow about specific social networks will have suggestions. 
However, there are a few general techniques. The most basic of these is to try to get 
approved access to the target's account. It could be that someone you know already 
has a social connection with the target. This might allow you to access the target's 
posts by logging on through your associate's account.
On some networks, friends of the target's friends can see some information. Thus, 
even if you cannot befriend the target, becoming connected to one of the target's as-
sociates on the social media site might increase the access you have.
If you want to keep your identity private, one option is to create a fresh account 
and use that to request a social connection. However, this option should be exercised 
with caution. It is a violation of the terms of service of some social media sites to 
create accounts with false personal information.
Even if creating a dummy account is not a violation, it may be transparent to 
the target. Accounts with very little history or few social connections may appear 
suspicious to the target. Ultimately, this depends on the target's personal preferences. 
Some people create as many social connections as possible on social media, while 
others are much more careful about curating their friend lists.
CONCLUSIONS
Privacy controls allow social media users to control who can see their content. These 
can be simple settings that toggle an account between public and restricted to an ap-
proved group, or they can be sophisticated that give users control over every person 
who can see each individual post.
While privacy controls are important for users, especially when they are sharing 
sensitive personal information, people often do not fully understand how public their 
data is nor how to use all the controls at their disposal.

38
CHAPTER 4  Privacy controls
Future chapters will discuss specific tactics for accessing information that is pro-
tected on the target's social media profiles. However, the most common and success-
ful strategies generally involve creating closer social connections with the target.

Finding people on 
social media
Each of the chapters in this book that is about a specific social media site (e.g., 
Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn) has sections that are specifically about finding 
people. If you're interested in finding someone on those sites, it's always a good idea 
­
However, there are also more general techniques you can use to find people on 
any social media site. This chapter introduces some of those.
THE IMPORTANCE OF USERNAMES
­
they use to login and it often appears in the web address (URL) of their page on the 
site. For example, if a person's username is “malcomcsmith,” his Facebook page 
is at http://facebook.com/malcomcsmith and his Twitter page is at http://twitter.com/
malcomcsmith.
People frequently reuse their usernames across sites. Thus, if you know some-
­
you find someone's username?
The email address is a good place to start. If you only have an email address, you 
might try using the part before the @ in the address as a username. For example, if 
the target's email is malcomcsmith@gmail.com, you can use “malcomcsmith” as a 
­
Email is also an important clue, even if the first part is not the target's username on 
other services. Many sites allow you to search for the email address a person used to reg-
ister and will then return a link to their page—including showing their username. Once 
you know someone's username on one site, you can use it to search for them on other 
­
­
known usernames are good places to start finding people on social media.
FINDING PEOPLE
BY GOOGLE SEARCH TECHNIQUES
Google is a great source for finding social media pages about people, and sometimes, 
it returns better results than the social media sites' own internal search tools. To use it 
effectively, there are a few advanced Google search tools that will help you.

CHAPTER 5  Finding people on social media
Searching Domains
First is the ability to search within a site or domain. A domain is the core part of a web 
address, usually the last two parts. For example, facebook.com, twitter.com, npr.org, 
and example.net are all domains. Google allows you to use the domain for a site to 
search on that site only. To do this, you use the prefix “site:,” followed by the domain. 
For example, if we wanted to search for our example user Malcom Conroy-Smith on 
Twitter, we would search for his name and then add site:twitter.com (Figure 5.1).
This search will look for the words Malcom and Conroy-Smith only on twitter.com.
Searching for Exact Phrases
When you use multiple words in a Google search, Google searches for all of those 
words in any order and will also look for pages that have only one of the words. 
Google will sometimes even make best guesses at close matches. In this case, it may 
find people named Malcom Smith. That flexibility in search can be very helpful, but 
sometimes, it returns too many results. To search for the exact name you want, you 
can put it in quotes. In that case, Google will only return pages with an exact match 
for the phrase in quotes (see Figure 5.2).
Searching Images
If there are many search results returned, a Google image search for the same term 
may be effective. In Figure 5.2, under the search box, you can see a list of search 
types (“Web,” “Videos,” “News,” “Images,” etc.). If you click on Images, it will 
take you to a set of search results with photos only. If you include the “site:” part of 
the search, it will return images from that site only. Thus, you will often find profile 
pictures with this kind of image search.
If you happen to have a photograph of the target, especially if it is a profile picture 
from another site, Google has an image search functionality that can help there, too. 
Go to the Google Images search page, either as described above or by going to http://
images.google.com. On the right side of the search box, there is a camera icon. This 
is their “Search by Image” feature. It allows you to upload a picture and it searches 
FIGURE 5.1

FIGURE 5.2
Using quotes around a term on a Google search forces Google to search for that exact 
phrase.

for matching and near-matching images. Figure 5.3 shows the main Google image 
search page.
Click on the camera icon to bring up the dialog box to search for matching im-
ages. Figure 5.4 shows the page that comes up. If you have the web address of the 
image of interest, you can paste it in this search box.
If you do not have an online version of the image, click the “Upload an image” 
text next to the “Paste image URL” tab. That will bring up a dialog box, shown 
in Figure 5.5, where you can select the image from your computer. Then click the 
“Search by Image” button next to the search box. The results will include exact 
matches and visually similar images.
A matching image result could take you to the target's other social media sites, 
websites where they have profiles, or pages where they are mentioned.
BY CACHE OR ARCHIVE
Before we move on entirely from Google, there is one other Google search tool that 
may be of value: the “cache” option, which can show you old versions of a page. 
For example, if your target once had a public page on a social media site, but now 
FIGURE 5.3

it to Search by Image.
FIGURE 5.4

CHAPTER 5  Finding people on social media
it is protected, you can search for cache:[url] where you replace [url] with the web 
address of the page. That will show you an older version of the page.
If you want to see many previous versions of someone's social media page, try 
using the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. This is, as the name suggests, an 
archive of the internet. Available at http://archive.org, you can put in the URL of any 
web page and see older copies that the service has saved. For example, Figure 5.6 
shows the results for the author's personal Twitter page at http://twitter.com/golbeck.
FIGURE 5.5
The “Upload an image” tab allows you to choose an image file from your computer to 
search.
FIGURE 5.6
The Internet Archive results for the author's personal Twitter feed.

43
Finding people
The time line at the top shows years across the bottom with markers indicating 
the dates the page was saved. Clicking on a year brings up a calendar underneath 
the time line. Dates with archived pages are highlighted in blue. Clicking on a date 
brings up the archived version of the page. The Internet Archive works for many 
pages besides social media, but this can be an effective way to locate old online data 
in some cases.
There are other ways beyond Google to find current social media pages, too. 
Social media search engines take names or possible usernames as input and then 
search across social media sites to find accounts. These services are constantly 
changing, and the companion website for the book has an updated list. A Google 
search for “social search engine” will likely bring up the latest results.
BY OTHER SERVICES
Finally, people finding/background check services on the web may be a good source 
of background information. While most of these search tools provide things like 
names, addresses, and phone numbers, instead of links to social media sites, some 
have email addresses that are useful for username tracking as described above. 
Furthermore, additional information about a target that these sites provide, like his 
current city, could be useful in narrowing down search results on specific social me-
dia sites to identify the correct person.
BY OTHER TECHNIQUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
There are other techniques you can use to find people online. One of the most effec-
tive is to search through the target's known associates. Even if your target is online, 
he may use a fake or abbreviated name that makes him hard to find. He may even 
have most of his profile private and protected. However, a target's friends are not al-
ways as careful, and this can make them a useful source of information to locate the 
target's account or find public information about him.
Each chapter of this book that deals with specific social media sites includes 
information on how to find associates' accounts and look for the target among their 
social contacts, but there are some general rules that are useful to know.
First, if you want to find a person's profile on a social media site, you can begin by 
finding his known associates. At least some friends and family members are likely to 
have accounts somewhere, since many social media tools have hundreds of millions 
of users. Once you have located associates (using some of the tips above, if simple 
searches on the social media site don't turn them up), you can look at their social 
connections. It is possible your target will be identifiable in that list, by either photo 
or name.
Even if you can't find a profile for your target in his associate's contact lists, you 
may be able to find information about him posted by the associate. Look through the 
associate's photos, posts, and other information. It is possible you will come across 
information about the target in this way.

44
CHAPTER 5  Finding people on social media
Regardless of where you find information—from social media sites, web 
searches, or on other people's social media pages—it is important to remember that 
social media is not an authoritative information source.
CASE STUDY
One of my clients—let's call him “Fred”—was trying to track down someone for 
whom they had no contact information. We knew Fred had grown up in Johnston, 
Iowa, a suburb of Des Moines. He later attended the University of Michigan in Ann 
Arbor and then moved to Dearborn, just outside of Detroit. At the time of our search, 
we knew he was 35 years old.
Fred had a common last name, so there were many people with the same name. 
However, a few searches turned up a man with his name but with some inaccurate in-
formation. One page listed his previous residence as Urbandale, Iowa, the next town 
over from his hometown of Johnston. There was no mention of his actual hometown 
of Johnston. There was also no mention of Dexter, Michigan, where we knew Fred 
lived. However, the same person who appeared to be from Urbandale, Iowa, was 
listed as living in Detroit. His age appeared as 39 years old.
So was this the Fred we were searching for or not? My client was deeply wor-
ried that it was a different person, but the fact is that probabilities suggest it was 
indeed the right Fred. Location information can come from many places. While Fred 
may have never lived in Urbandale, Iowa, the fact that it shared a border with his 
hometown of Johnston means that he likely had connections to Urbandale. He may 
have worked there, attended high school there, or have used a friend's address in 
Urbandale at one point.
Similarly, it is very common to see people listed as living in the large city closest 
to them. It is not unusual to see the names of little-known suburbs dropped in favor 
of an identifiable city. And, as was the case with Fred's hometown, it would be likely 
that Fred worked, had a post-office box, or maintained some other connection to the 
neighboring large city of Detroit.
Finally, the age of the Fred we found was 4 years older than the Fred we were 
searching for. People lie about their birthdays and age all the time on social media. 
This may be to protect their privacy, to throw off potential investigators, or simply 
for amusement. Even ages that are pulled from external data sources instead of being 
supplied by the user can be wrong for a variety of reasons.
The important consideration is probability. What is the likelihood that there was 
another guy with the same first and last name as our Fred who grew up very near 
where our Fred grew up, who was close in age, and who moved to the same city 
several states away? While it is certainly possible, the probability of this is low, and 
it is reasonable to assume that the Fred we found is the Fred we were looking for. 
Indeed, in this case, the slightly off version of Fred was indeed the target, and using 
the profile we found, my client was able to make contact and resolve her issue.

Conclusions
CONCLUSIONS
As a starting point for finding people on social media, your best bet is to search for 
them on the specific sites you care about. Details for how to conduct those searches 
are contained in the relevant chapters in this book. However, there are useful higher-
level tips.
People often reuse their usernames. Thus, if you can find someone on a particular 
site, the username there may be the same as the username on other sites. Similarly, if 
you have an email address for someone, you may be able to search for accounts by  
email or use the part of the address before the “@” sign as a best guess at a username.
Google and other services offer a number of search tools and operators that will 
help you find people on particular sites and more broadly on the web. Older versions 
of pages may be cached at Google or available in the Internet Archive, and these can 
be useful in learning if you have found the correct account for someone.
Finally, searching for people through their associates and allowing for flexibility 
and some incorrectness in search results will help you discover targets in ways that 
you might not have initially expected.

Location data
The use of the internet, and social media in particular, has increasingly moved from 
desktop computers to mobile devices. In 2013, a study by Adobe found that 71% 
of people use their mobile device to access social media.1­
-
puters, mobile devices (such as smartphones) have nearly constant access to a per-
­
Consequently, everything people do on a mobile device, including their activities on 
social media, can be associated with a precise location.
Social media companies have taken advantage of this. Most offer users the ability 
to add a location to their status updates.
But why include location with updates? There are many reasons. In some cases, 
it can encourage face-to-face interaction. For example, on some platforms (like 
Foursquare), if a user indicates that he is at a particular place, he is automatically 
notified if any of his social media friends are there, too. Users may want to label their 
photos' locations to remember where they were taken.
Marketers are also interested. Some businesses offer discounts or other perks to 
people who post that they are there, since the posts serve as a type of advertising or 
publicity. They may also look for people who are nearby. An ice cream shop may of­
fer a discount to someone who has posted from a nearby store, hoping to entice him 
to purchase a sundae.
This location information can be a valuable tool for investigation. This chapter 
shows how location information is connected to posts, how to find it, and what you 
can do with it once you collect it.
THE LEXICON OF LOCATIONS
­
understand the associated terms and symbols used.
Most platforms have adopted a relatively standard location icon, based on loca-
tion markers typically used in mapping programs:
­

48
CHAPTER 6  Location data
On most platforms, moving the mouse over this icon or selecting it will reveal 
location information. Sometimes, this presents the option to add a location.
For example, on Facebook, users can add a location to a post, even if they are 
posting from their home computer that does not have a GPS location. The status 
update box has this location icon, and clicking on it adds a field prompting users to 
enter their location with the text “Where are you?” (Figure 6.1).
There's also a common vocabulary associated with adding location to posts. 
Geotagging refers to the process of adding a location (or “geolocation”) to a post, 
photo, or status update. This is typically determined via GPS coordinates, indicating 
a precise location of the post. This is easy on mobile devices, which know the user's 
precise location. For status updates with a place-name or a street address, geoloca-
tion is what maps that name or address to a pair of latitude-longitude coordinates.
Another way people share their location is through a check-in. Unlike geotag-
ging, which adds a location to a post, a check-in usually involves the user explicitly 
indicating that they are at a specific location. For example, Figure 6.2 shows our ex-
ample user Malcom having checked in at Reagan Washington National Airport. The 
name of the location is a link in Malcom's status update, and the airport's location 
(Arlington, VA) is listed at the bottom of the update.
COLLECTING LOCATION INFORMATION
When searching for location information about an individual under investigation, 
there are two major categories of data: the individual's own posts and automatically 
encoded sources.
FIGURE 6.2
A check-in at Reagan Washington National Airport.
FIGURE 6.1
The Facebook status update box. The location icon at the bottom left has been clicked, 
bringing up the small text area that says “Where are you?” Users can enter a location, like 
a city or a restaurant name, in that box.

49
Collecting location information
Future chapters on specific social media websites explain how to find location 
data on each site. In the meantime, here are general guidelines for finding this infor-
mation on any site.
USER-PROVIDED LOCATION DATA
Look for the location icon. On Twitter, for example, posts will have the location icon 
at the bottom of the post. This is shown in Figure 6.3.
On Twitter, location names are usually shown, but these are geocoded. Clicking 
on the name of the place reveals a map with the GPS coordinates shown.
The place-name in Figure 6.3 is “Jaleo-Bethesda.” If we were to click on that link, 
the following map would appear (Figure 6.4):
FIGURE 6.3
Note the location icon after the date in the bottom row of text. The location is listed after 
that, including a link to the specific place.
FIGURE 6.4
The map with the GPS coordinates of the location shown in Figure 6.3. Note the 
coordinates at the top of the window, along with the location on the map (shown with a pin).

50
CHAPTER 6  Location data
Many sites follow this same pattern: using a location icon to indicate when a 
user has included a location in a post and linking the location's name to its GPS 
coordinates.
Check-ins also have locations. These may be addresses, place-names, or GPS 
coordinates. Facebook's check-in feature, shown in Figure 6.2, features both a place-
name (Reagan Washington National Airport) and a city name (Arlington, VA). Some 
Facebook check-ins also have coordinates.
Other services are specifically designed around sharing locations. For 
­example, Foursquare is a social game based on the premise of users sharing 
their ­location. Users are awarded points for each check-in, receive offers and 
coupons, and can track places their friends visit. In location-centric systems like 
this, every single post has an associated location. Sometimes, that location data 
propagates ­elsewhere—even sites that aren't built around locations. For example, 
some users may choose to share their Foursquare check-ins through other social 
media services, like Twitter.
AUTO-ENCODED LOCATION DATA
When users don't explicitly share their location, there are still ways to obtain it. 
Photos and videos have associated metadata, which can include information about the 
GPS coordinates where the image was taken. This data is called Exif (“Exchangeable 
Image file Format”). Not all photos' or videos' Exif data contains GPS coordinates—
but many do, especially those created on mobile devices (like smartphones).
Exif data can be extracted from any image online. The data doesn't appear auto-
matically; you will need some software to view it. There are many free tools to do 
this, requiring varying levels of expertise.
Some are available as add-ons for your browser, such as Exif Viewer.2 With this 
tool, you can right click on an image, and the add-on provides an option to view the 
Exif data. Selecting the option opens a new window containing all metadata associ-
ated with the image. Figure 6.5 shows an example of a photo's Exif data (including 
encoded GPS coordinates).
There are also online tools for extracting this Exif data, as well as desktop programs. 
Since the software options change (as do their web addresses), please consult this book's 
companion website for an up-to-date list of Exif-extracting software options.
USING LOCATION DATA
You've got some location data … now what? Well, the obvious answer is that you 
can see where a person was at a given time. However, by collecting many posts with 
location data, there are possibilities for much richer analysis.
To start off, consider collecting the last 200 check-ins for a user. (Note: the com-
panion website for this book has a program you can download that will do this when 
the data is available.) One quick option is to plot that data on a map. Google Maps 

51
Using location data
has many options for doing this. There are also a number of websites that let you 
easily copy and paste a list of coordinates and view the output on a map. Again, the 
companion website has a list of options with instructions.
Figure  6.6 shows the map of check-ins for a user who lives near Vancouver, 
British Columbia:
A number of interesting patterns emerge in this map. There are two clusters of 
check-ins to the right: one by the highway and one near Langley (south of the first). 
Then, there's a spread of check-ins to the west, near Burnaby and Vancouver.
This alone reveals a lot about the user's movements and habits. Cross-referencing 
these points with place-names and their types (e.g., restaurants, shopping locations, 
and offices) can reveal where a person works, lives, and goes out.
FIGURE 6.5
Exif data for a picture of a park. The “Exif GPS IFD” section includes the latitude-longitude 
coordinates of where the photo was taken. Other Exif data (not shown in this image) 
includes the date the photo was taken, allowing an investigator to know exactly when the 
photographer was at this location.

52
CHAPTER 6  Location data
Another important point is that every post—whether it's a social media status 
update or a photo—has an associated time. Sometimes, plotting locations over time 
can be useful.
Figure 6.7 shows another Google Map. This comes from a different anony-
mous user.
FIGURE 6.6
A Google Map with the check-in locations of an anonymous user near Vancouver. Note the 
two clusters near the right of the image: one on the highway and one just north of Langley.
FIGURE 6.7
A series of locations gathered from one person's Twitter account, with a line connecting 
them based on the order they were posted. This clearly shows the person was headed west 
toward San Diego.

53
Notes
This user's last 200 posts were analyzed for location (when available), and the 
points were plotted on the map. A line connects the points based on the order in 
which they were posted.
In this case, we clearly see the person posting on Twitter as they move west to-
ward San Diego. Reading the posts that contain these locations reveals that the user 
was in the process of moving from Washington, DC, to San Diego, and he posted as 
they drove cross-country.
CHALLENGES TO USING LOCATION DATA
There are a number of challenges associated with location data, centered around the 
fact that it can be hard to access.
A 2013 Pew study3 showed that the frequency of check-ins is slowly declin-
ing. Meanwhile, users who include location data with their (noncheck-in) posts are 
increasing significantly. Nevertheless, only about 30% of adults report including 
location information. This means that, for most users, location information is not 
available with their social media posts.
As social media use increasingly moves to mobile devices, it's reasonable to ex-
pect that more location information will become available. However, including this 
is an opt-in process, not an automatic one—so it is unlikely to become something we 
will see by default.
Privacy concerns are also closely tied to location data. As a result, some systems 
(like Foursquare) keep users' check-ins restricted to their friend lists. Thus, it may 
be hard to actually access location information in certain environments, unless you 
already have an existing connection with the person being investigated.
CONCLUSIONS
As more and more users access social media from mobile devices, the availability 
of location information—both from their posts and embedded in their photos and 
­videos—also increases. It can be found in geotagged posts, check-ins, and the embed-
ded metadata of images and videos. Once it's collected, there are several ways to plot 
it, analyze it, and discover the patterns and movements of the person being investigated.
In later chapters, we will see how to find location information in a variety of 
websites and in what form the data can be found.

Legal issues
This chapter will come nowhere near laying out a clear and complete picture of 
what the law says about using social media for investigation. That's because the law 
is entirely unclear on these issues. There have been many court cases and lawsuits 
regarding a variety of investigative techniques, but the results are unclear and some­
times contradictory.
Guidelines often depend on who is doing the investigating. Law enforcement or 
parties in lawsuits have different rules and expectations compared to businesses do­
ing background checks on job applicants or a private citizen undertaking a personal 
investigation.
That said, this chapter will lay out the current legal landscape. What is presented 
here is an overview of how current cases have been handled and an interpretation of 
them. However, this chapter should not be taken as legal advice! I, your author, am 
not a lawyer or a law expert. If you are considering undertaking an investigation but 
are worried about the legal risks, you should contact a lawyer from your company 
or organization or a personal attorney. This issue is currently unclear for the law so 
consulting an internet law expert is essential for your own protection.
There are two core legal issues that come up in this area: a person's right to pri­
vacy and the investigator violating a site's terms of service (TOS). We will look at 
those areas individually along with a list of common investigative techniques that 
have not seen any legal challenge.
RIGHT TO PRIVACY
MELVIN COLON
In 2011, Melvin Colon was one of eight gang members charged with murder, at­
tempted murder, and a number of drug and gun charges. He had posted photos of 
himself on Facebook, which were accessible to anyone online, that showed him 
flashing gang signs and flashing cash (e.g., Figure 7.1). In posts that had privacy set­
tings that restricted access to his friends, Colon posted more incriminating material, 
including threats of violence and photos of illegal activity.1
The police obtained a warrant to collect Colon's private Facebook information. In 
order to show probable cause to obtain the warrant, the police accessed some of this 
private information through the assistance of a corroborating witness. Colon's friend

CHAPTER 7  Legal issues
list was public, and the police used this to find a friend who was willing to show them 
Colon's restricted posts. Colon's attorneys argued this was a violation of his Fourth 
Amendment rights, claiming he had a right to privacy for the posts he restricted to 
his friends.
A judge ruled against this, stating, “Colon's legitimate expectation of privacy 
ended when he disseminated posts to his ‘friends’ because those ‘friends’ were 
free to use the information however they wanted—including sharing it with the 
Government”.2
OCCUPY WALL STREET
In another case, a protestor in the Occupy Wall Street protests challenged an at-
tempt by the government to collect public tweets he had posted before his arrest 
during a demonstration. The subpoena went to Twitter, and the company argued 
that the user had a right to quash the subpoena. A judge ruled he did not because 
a user has “no propriety interest” in tweets—essentially, Twitter owned the data, 
not the user.
The user also argued that the Fourth Amendment should protect the privacy of 
his tweets. The New York City Criminal Court disagreed, stating that there can be no 
expectation of privacy for tweets shared with the general public.3
FIGURE 7.1
An example of Melvin Colon's posts. His username and face are blurred here for privacy, 
though the original photo is still available on his Facebook profile to the general public.

57
Terms of service
GEORGIA STUDENT
Another case that reinforces this argument is that of a minor student in Georgia. The 
student had posted a publicly visible photo of herself in a bikini on Facebook. This 
photo was found and used in a presentation by her school district on internet safety in 
a context that implied the student was promiscuous and abused alcohol. The student 
and her attorneys argued that this was a Fourth Amendment violation,4 but a judge 
ruled against her stating that she had no expectation of privacy for a photo she had 
published publicly. (Note that there may be other arguments against the school us-
ing this photo, such as copyright violation, but that was not the privacy argument at 
issue here.)
Indeed, most websites' terms state something to this effect. Facebook, for ex-
ample, says, “When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it 
means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Facebook, to access 
and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e. your name and profile 
picture)”.5
While there are likely to be more challenges on this front, it appears that the 
courts are inclined to accept that once a person shares data with someone else, he 
loses his expectation of privacy. This precedent has held since the predigital age—­
including written and mailed letters—and is likely to continue.
TERMS OF SERVICE
The TOS of a website provide a set of rules that users agree to follow when they use 
a site. A site might also use them to offer disclaimers or deny legal responsibility for 
some actions.
Each social media site has its own TOS, and so, there is no single rule an investi-
gator can follow in order to ensure he or she is within the bounds of allowable activ-
ity on every site—except that it is important to read the terms for each site.
FAKE ACCOUNTS
For investigations, the main issue that arises with respect to TOS is that of creating 
profiles with fake identities. If you are investigating someone, it is obvious that you 
would not want to use details from your personal account. You may not want to per-
sonally add someone as a friend or otherwise reveal your true identity as someone 
who is looking at what the target posted. Thus, creating a fake or anonymous account 
can be a solution.
However, not all sites allow fake accounts. Facebook does not, and, at the time 
of this writing in fall 2014, it was actively enforcing this requirement by shutting 
down accounts it believed to be fake. Facebook's Terms of Service page6 makes this 
requirement very clear:

58
CHAPTER 7  Legal issues
Registration and Account Security
Facebook users provide their real names and information, and we need your help 
to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to regis-
tering and maintaining the security of your account:
•	 You will not provide any false personal information on Facebook, or create an 
account for anyone other than yourself without permission.
•	 You will not create more than one personal account.
•	 If we disable your account, you will not create another one without our 
permission.
•	 You will not use your personal timeline primarily for your own commercial 
gain, and will use a Facebook Page for such purposes.
•	 You will not use Facebook if you are under 13.
•	 You will not use Facebook if you are a convicted sex offender.
•	 You will keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date.
•	 You will not share your password (or in the case of developers, your secret 
key), let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeop-
ardize the security of your account.
•	 You will not transfer your account (including any Page or application you 
administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission.
•	 If you select a username or similar identifier for your account or Page, we 
reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it is appropriate (such 
as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely 
relate to a user's actual name).
You can see that a number of these items explicitly exclude fake accounts. Aside 
from the explicit requirements, the requirements of keeping contact information up-
to-date, not sharing passwords, and not transferring accounts may prohibit many 
activities investigators may take with fake accounts.
The policy is out of sync with reality, where as many as 10% of accounts may be 
totally fake,7 and many users report including some fake information to protect their 
privacy. For example, a Pew study showed that 26% of African-American teens had 
at least some fake data in their profile for privacy reasons.8
As a side note, this “real name” policy has come under sharp criticism because of 
the real danger it presents to a lot of users.
Not all social networks prohibit fake accounts, however. Twitter has no rules 
about using a true identity. Google, and its social media services including YouTube 
and Google+, used to have a real name policy, but they eliminated that policy in 2014. 
They published this statement on Google+ describing the removal of the policy.9
When we launched Google+ over three years ago, we had a lot of restrictions on 
what name you could use on your profile. This helped create a community made 
up of real people, but it also excluded a number of people who wanted to be part 
of it without using their real names.

59
Terms of service
Over the years, as Google+ grew and its community became established, we 
steadily opened up this policy, from allowing +Page owners to use any name 
of their choosing to letting YouTube users bring their usernames into Google+. 
Today, we are taking the last step: there are no more restrictions on what name 
you can use.
We know you've been calling for this change for a while. We know that our names 
policy has been unclear, and this has led to some unnecessarily difficult experi-
ences for some of our users. For this we apologize, and we hope that today's 
change is a step toward making Google+ the welcoming and inclusive place that 
we want it to be. Thank you for expressing your opinions so passionately, and 
thanks for continuing to make Google+ the thoughtful community that it is.
LinkedIn does require the use of real names and accurate information10:
2.3. Service Eligibility
To be eligible to use the Services, you must meet the following criteria and repre-
sent and warrant that you: … (4) will only maintain one LinkedIn account (and/
or one SlideShare or Pulse account, if applicable) at any given time; (5) will use 
your real name and only provide accurate information to LinkedIn.
So it depends on the service whether or not you are required to create an account 
with your true identity. Reviewing the TOS is important if you want to ensure that 
you are not violating an agreement in your investigation—especially if you plan to 
bring evidence gathered from the investigation to court.
FAKE ACCOUNTS IN COURT CASES
There are a few ways the creation of fake accounts has come up in the courts so far: 
using a fake account and impersonation.
Let's first look at simply creating a fake account. The TOS are presented as legal 
agreements. Would it count as a violation of law if a person were to violate the terms?
United States v. Drew
The main court case to look at this is United States v. Drew. Lori Drew, the defen-
dant, is a Missouri woman and mother of a teen girl in 2006. Drew's daughter, Sarah, 
had been friends with another girl, Megan Meier, who was 13 years old at the time. 
When the two girls had a falling out, Lori Drew created a fake profile on Myspace 
claiming to be a 16-year-old boy named Josh. “Josh” friended Megan and the two 
became online friends, though the account was secretly being run by Sarah's mom 
and another 18-year-old girl.
In October 2006, “Josh” changed from his friendly tone and sent Megan a mes-
sage that said, “I don't know if I want to be friends with you anymore because I've 
heard that you are not very nice to your friends.” His account then started to publicly 
share private messages that Megan had sent. His last message read, “You are a bad 

60
CHAPTER 7  Legal issues
person and everybody hates you. Have a shitty rest of your life. The world would be 
a better place without you.” Twenty minutes after their last exchange, Megan hanged 
herself by a belt in her closet and died the next day.11
Lori Drew, the mother who had operated the “Josh” account, was arrested and 
charged with violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), a US federal 
law. The government argued that by creating the fake account on Myspace, Drew had 
gained “unauthorized access” to a computer in violation of the CFAA.
Drew was convicted of these charges, but a federal district court judge later over-
turned the conviction stating that violating the TOS does not constitute a crime under 
CFAA.12
Facebook v. Power Ventures
Another case, Facebook v. Power Ventures, established that it is not a crime to violate 
the TOS.
Power Ventures is a company that was collecting public information from peo-
ple's Facebook profiles. Facebook's terms prohibit the automated collection of infor-
mation from its pages. It blocked Power Ventures' IP addresses, and Power Ventures 
changed them to continue getting access. Facebook then sued Power Ventures, as-
serting their actions violated Section 502 of the California Penal Code, which deals 
with unauthorized access to computer systems.
The court ruled that simply violating the TOS was not a crime.13 Other issues in 
that case are pending, but the courts made clear that a person was not committing a 
computer crime simply by violating the TOS on a social media site.
However, even if fake accounts are not crimes that can be prosecuted, there can 
certainly be consequences to using them. First, the social media site can shut down 
the fake accounts at any time and refuse to reinstate them. Occasionally, this has even 
been the case for people who use real identities that the social media sites simply 
don't believe.14
If a fake profile claims to be another real person (rather than an invented person), 
there are many potential consequences. Twitter is an excellent site to learn about this 
because they allow fake accounts and even parody accounts (as long as the accounts 
identify themselves as parodies).
Coventry First
In one case, insurer Coventry First sued an unidentified John Doe for his Twitter 
parody account. Coventry First is a secondary insurance company; they buy life in-
surance policies and collect when the insured person dies. This marketplace has been 
criticized for being morbid, since they essentially profit from the deaths of people. 
(And the more quickly the people die, the more money the company makes.) The 
market gained some infamy in the 1980s for buying up policies of AIDS patients, 
because secondary insurance companies expected them to die quickly.
The fake Twitter account posted messages essentially rooting for mass death in 
order to increase profits (Figure 7.2).

61
Terms of service
The account did not properly identify itself as a parody account (though one could 
argue that the parody was quite clear from the contents of the tweets), and Coventry 
First sued for trademark infringement and unfair competition.15 Fortunately for John 
Doe, Coventry First did not file the proper paperwork to obtain his real identity, and 
after they were challenged by Doe's lawyer, they dropped the case.16
Todd Levitt
Similar circumstances were at play when Todd Levitt, a Central Michigan University 
professor (and criminal defense lawyer), sued a student for parodying him on Twitter. 
The parody included tweets like “Buying me a drink at Cabin karaoke will get you 
extra credit, but it's not like that matters because you're guaranteed an A in the syl-
labus”.17 Levitt sued for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
The student's lawyer argued that the parody tweets were protected by the First and 
Fourteenth Amendments, since they were caricatures and “rhetorical hyperbole”.18
At the time of writing, the lawsuit is still under way.
Jim Ardis
One parodied man took things into his own hands. Peoria, Illinois, mayor Jim Ardis 
was so upset about a Twitter account (@peoriamayor) that parodied him that he sent 
a SWAT team to raid the home of Jon Daniel who operated the account on charges 
that he was impersonating a public official.19 Police detained him and seized his com-
puters. No charges were filed against Daniel, but with the backing of the American 
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), he filed a lawsuit for wrongful arrest, claiming that 
his tweets were protected under the First Amendment. His case is also still pending.
These examples all show that it is currently unclear what is protected and what ac-
tions can be taken against someone who impersonates another person online. While 
we have looked at examples of parody accounts, law enforcement officials and other 
investigators face more complex challenges. For example, is it appropriate to imper-
sonate someone a target knows in real life? That is a different type of impersonation 
than parody, but there are no clear legal guidelines to follow in cases like this.
FIGURE 7.2
Examples of tweets from the Coventry First parody account.

CHAPTER 7  Legal issues
CONCLUSIONS
Fortunately, we have not seen any legal issues arise from one person simply access-
ing the public information provided on a person's social media site. It appears that if 
a private citizen looks at someone's content for his own purposes, no one has decided 
to sue as a result. However, once a social media post is used for something, it has 
been challenged.
Courts seem to be in agreement that users do not have an expectation of privacy 
for content they share on social media, whether it is shared publicly or not. In terms 
of creating alternative accounts to help access information, the story is more mixed.
There appears to be agreement that it is not a crime to simply violate the TOS 
of a website, though investigators who hope to bring information to court should be 
wary of such practice, as it calls into question the validity of an investigation. There 
is no case law that firmly establishes how acceptable it is to create fake accounts that 
impersonate another person. We examined this in the case of parody accounts, but 
investigators might think about creating fake accounts that appear to be someone 
from a target's life. We do not know how courts would rule on such an activity, so it 
should be undertaken with caution.
The one issue that is very clear is that legal precedent around social media is still 
evolving. The current case law is likely to change, and new laws are popping up at all 
levels, from the federal government to small towns. Investigators will be well served 
to keep abreast of developments on this topic.

CHAPTER
65
Facebook
In my own work, I was approached by a woman who wanted help finding someone 
online. Her niece, “Carol,” had lived several states away in the Midwest. Carol had 
died a few years earlier in a highway accident. She had had a rocky relationship with 
her husband, “Mike,” and they had been separated at the time of her death. Carol was 
­
had been given to Carol when she left home. It had little monetary value but a lot of 
sentimental value for the family. My client’s sister, Carol’s mother, had requested the 
heirloom be returned, and Mike had offered to hand it over for a price. Carol’s mother 
­
Carol’s heirloom with him.
Not having the family heirloom had become an emotional hardship for Carol’s 
mother. My client saw this and decided to make a deal with Mike on her own to get 
the object back. The only problem was that my client did not have any information 
about how to reach Mike. No email address, no phone, and no idea exactly where he 
was living.
We started by searching Carol’s Facebook profile. It was still active several years 
after her death, but she had deleted all of her connections with Mike when they had 
separated shortly before her death. This ruled out finding him through a known as-
sociate. Furthermore, Mike had a common last name, so there were thousands of 
people on Facebook who had his name. It was impractical to search for them all. 
­
Finally, we turned to Facebook’s graph search. This allows you to search for a 
name and then use filters to narrow down the search results. We searched for Mike 
using his full name and then filtered the search to only people living near the 
medium-sized city where he had last lived. This returned only four people. We ruled 
out one by the picture (a man shown with his wife and three children who was clearly 
not our Mike), one was excluded because he attended a high school in a different 
­
from a university that we knew Mike had not attended.
This left one option, but it was not necessarily the Mike we were looking for. Our 
Mike might have used a fake name or location or simply not have been on Facebook 
at all. Examining the profile, however, showed conclusively that this was our target 
Mike. He listed Carol’s father on his profile page as “father-in-law” and mentioned 
­

CHAPTER 8  Facebook
Using a fake Facebook account created just for this purpose, my client sent a 
friend request to Mike. After he approved it, she reached out to him with a Facebook 
message and offered to make arrangements with him to transfer the heirloom. Mike 
responded within a few hours and named a price. My client agreed, and within a few 
days, she flew to the Midwest airport closest to Mike, met him at a prearranged time, 
and made the exchange.
Carol’s heirloom is now home with her mother, all as a result of a Facebook in-
vestigation that allowed my client to reach out to her husband.
FACEBOOK OVERVIEW
Facebook is a social networking site and jockeys for position with Google as the 
most used website in the world. They report 1.4 billion monthly users, which con-
stitute over half the worldwide population of internet users (currently estimated 
at ≈ 2.4 billion).
Reflecting back on the categories of sites listed earlier in the book, Facebook can 
fairly be called the social networking site, since there is a heavy emphasis on creat-
ing connections with friends. The information users post is shared with their friends, 
and when users log in, they see a list of posts that their friends have made. However, 
Facebook is not just a social networking site; in many ways, it can be considered a 
one-stop destination for everything a person might want online.
We will discuss the different types of available data in detail below, but Facebook 
is a place where people come to share links, play games with friends, post photos and 
videos, share their location, and find trending news. Its usefulness goes far beyond 
the ability to post a simple update or maintain a profile.
BASIC FACEBOOK ACTIVITIES
Users can do many things on Facebook, but this chapter will focus on a core set of 
activities.
Adding Friends
Having social connections is a prerequisite for any social network. It’s therefore no 
surprise that one of the main features of Facebook is the ability to create lists of friends. 
When a user finds someone on Facebook they want to be friends with, they can send a 
friend request. If the recipient of the request approves it, the two users become friends. 
The main result of this is that each person will be able to see updates that the other has 
created. We discussed how this information is displayed later on in this chapter.
Status Updates
The main way that users share information with their friends is through a status 
update. Updates are usually text but may also contain links, photos, videos, and loca-
tion information. Users can also “call out” friends by name in their updates.

67
Facebook overview
Figure 8.1 shows the basic interface for creating a status update. This appears on 
the top of most pages that users see on Facebook. They can type their update into 
the box and add other data if they choose. Note that in Figure 8.1, the location icon 
at the bottom left of the window says “Washington.” This is Facebook automatically 
including the users’ location with the update. To the right of that is a camera icon that 
gives the user the option to choose a photo to include with the update.
Another important icon to note in Figure 8.1 is just to the left of the “Post” button 
in the bottom right. This has a globe with the word “Public” next to it. That indicates 
the privacy level of the post. This post is visible to anyone online. The small triangle 
to the right allows the user to select different privacy levels from a pull-down menu. 
They can choose to make the post visible to their friends only, to themselves only 
(making it practically invisible), or to a custom-defined group of people.
Likes, Comments, and Shares
Users can also interact with status update made by others. Figure 8.2 shows a post 
made by the grocery chain Whole Foods Market. At the bottom of this post in a gray 
box under the image are the options “Like,” “Comment,” and “Share.”
Liking something on Facebook is one of the most common ways users interact. 
It indicates exactly what the name suggests; the user clicks “Like” when they like a 
post.
User can also comment. In Figure 8.2, you can see the user has started typing a 
comment: “Yum!” The comment feature is a way that people can have a discussion 
about a link, photo, or other updates.
The option to share is the way people can repost something so that their friends 
can see it.
Liking “Pages”
Liking on Facebook isn’t only available for posts. A user can also like a “page.”
These pages are maintained by companies, celebrities, and other public entities. 
Figure 8.3 shows the top of the page for Whole Foods Market. You can see a “Like” 
button in the lower right. Clicking that is similar to creating a friend relationship on 
Facebook. If the user likes the page, he or she will see this brand’s updates posted on 
his or her newsfeed page.
FIGURE 8.1

icon indicates the status is taking place in Washington. To its right is a photo icon, allowing 
the option to include a picture with this update.

Facebook overview
Third-Party Integration
Facebook has even extended the ability to like and share content to other websites. 
Figure 8.4 shows a screen from the retailer REI website. REI is unaffiliated with 
Facebook, but they have integrated a Facebook icon (visible at the top right of the 
page). When a user clicks this, it allows them to automatically share a link to the cur-
rent page with their friends on Facebook.
Tens of thousands of websites have this capability integrated. This has made it 
very easy for people to share interesting information on Facebook even when they 
are using other websites.
COMPONENTS OF THE FACEBOOK SITE
Facebook is broken down into two major sections: the News Feed and the Timeline.
The News Feed
The first is for all the News Feed. This is the first page people see when they come on to 
the Facebook website. It’s a collection of all the status updates and activity announce-
ments that their friends have made as well as updates from brands or celebrities whose 
pages the user has liked. (Facebook also mixes ads in with this content to make money.)
The News Feed can be sorted in reverse chronological order, so the user sees his or 
her friends’ most recent posts first. By default, though, Facebook tries to highlight the 
post they think are most relevant to the user. Facebook does not explain exactly how they 
determine relevance, but it combines how recent post is, how many likes and comments 
have been received from people, and other factors that are in a constant state of change.
FIGURE 8.4
The REI website includes a link to share product info on Facebook. This is done by 
clicking the Facebook icon above the product name (on the right of the page).

70
CHAPTER 8  Facebook
Figure 8.5 shows the News Feed for our example user Malcom. If you were to 
scroll down, you would see more posts from his friends and the pages he has liked.
The News Feed aggregates posts from all of a user’s friends.
The Timeline
All the posts a user has made are contained in that user’s Timeline. To access a 
user’s Timeline, click on their name anywhere within Facebook. Clicking on the 
name brings you to their Timeline by default. Figure 8.6 shows the top of example 
user Malcom’s Timeline.
In addition to the user’s updates, all other personal data about a user is aggre-
gated and accessible to users from the Timeline. In Figure 8.6, you can see “About,” 
“Photos,” “Friends,” and “More” in the navigation bar beside Malcom’s profile pic-
ture, toward the top of the page. Rather than explore all of these items here, we’ll 
cover each in more depth later in the chapter, when discussing how to obtain infor-
mation about people.
FACEBOOK DEMOGRAPHICS
Because Facebook is so popular (1.4 billion users), it can be hard to distinguish their 
demographics from the demographics of the population at large. Close to 70% of 
the US internet-using population has Facebook profiles; similar numbers are seen in 
FIGURE 8.5
The News Feed of, for example, user Malcom.

71
Finding people
Europe. Penetration is higher in many countries abroad. Over 70% of India’s online 
population is on Facebook, and penetration is close to 90% in Indonesia, Turkey, and 
the Philippines.
Facebook users tend to be a bit overrepresented in the middle-age bracket, and the 
male-to-female ratio is slightly skewed toward female when compared to the overall 
population. Rates of adoption tend to be a bit higher among educated, wealthier 
adults; but there is a good chance of finding any adult on Facebook, regardless of his 
or her demographic characteristics.
FINDING PEOPLE
When you want to find a person on Facebook, there are a number of interesting ways 
to find them.
FIGURE 8.6
Our example user Malcom’s Timeline on Facebook.

72
CHAPTER 8  Facebook
BY NAME
The most straightforward way to find someone is to search by name. The search bar 
at the top of the Facebook window can be used for all the searches discussed in this 
chapter. When you type in someone’s name, you get a preview list of the results, as 
shown in Figure 8.7.
If the person you are searching for does not appear in this list, you can also 
try to search for them through Google. This requires an advanced search technique. 
You can limit the search results to a Facebook by including site:facebook in the 
query. To search for Alice Smith’s Facebook page on Google, the search would be 
as follows:
site:facebook.com "Alice Smith".
This will return only public pages on Facebook that contain the name “Alice 
Smith” and results for profiles with that name will be prioritized.
BY EMAIL ADDRESS
If this still doesn’t get you to the person you are looking for, you can also search by 
email address. Depending on a user’s settings, this may bring up their profile page 
even when the name does not.
FIGURE 8.7
A search for someone named “Alice Smith.”

73
Obtaining data
It is possible that both of these techniques fail. There are privacy settings in 
Facebook that allow people to prevent themselves from being found in the search. 
Fortunately, for the investigator, there are a number of other strategies although this 
may not be so fortunate for unaware users.
BY KNOWN ASSOCIATIONS
One technique is to look for someone through their associates. If you know who 
your target’s friends are, try to find those friends by name or email address. From 
there, you can navigate to the associate’s friend page. Your target may be listed there. 
(More details on the “Friends” page are in the next section.)
BY LIKES
Another option is to find the target through their likes. When someone likes a 
page on Facebook, they usually appear on the list of people who have liked the 
page.
Using Graph Search
Facebook has recently added new support for this kind of search through a tool they 
call graph search. These searches can be entered into the same search bar at the 
top of the page that you would use to search for someone by name. However, the 
searches can be more complex.
For example, you can enter the search “People who like Georgetown University.” 
This brings up a list of everyone who has liked that page and some additional infor-
mation about those people. Figure 8.8 shows a result page with the identities of the 
people blurred out to protect their privacy.
You can filter the results by someone’s gender, employer, etc., in your search. 
Using these filters can help narrow down the number of results dramatically.
For example, if you started with the search above and then added filters to se-
lect only men who graduated from Georgetown (in addition to liking it) in the class 
of 2000, there are only two people in the results, shown in Figure 8.9. Note that 
the query in the search bar updated is updated to “Male graduates of Georgetown 
University in 2000 who like Georgetown University.”
OBTAINING DATA
Once you have found your target, you can begin looking for information on their 
Facebook page. Facebook does not inform a user when someone has looked at 
their profile, posts, photos, and so on. Thus, a user will not know that you have 
browsed what they’ve posted. The only way for a user to know that you had looked 
at their page is if you comment, like, or otherwise send a message indicating you 
were there.

74
CHAPTER 8  Facebook
USER TIMELINES
Users’ Timelines have collections of the status updates they have made. Figure 8.6 
shows Malcom’s Timeline.
Each status update has the text a user has entered, but there is more information 
embedded in it. If you click the date or time listed on a status update, it will bring up 
only that post in the browser.
Figure 8.10 shows one of Malcom’s updates that has been opened in this fash-
ion. Next to his name, it says “at Elephant & Castle.” This is location information 
indicating exactly where the user was when he posted this update. Location data is 
discussed more below.
Under Malcom’s name is the exact date and time of the update, along with the 
city where it was posted. The globe icon to the right of this indicates that the privacy 
setting for this post makes it available to the general public. Different icons will ap-
pear based on the privacy setting the user has applied. Privacy levels are discussed in 
depth later in this chapter.
FIGURE 8.8
Results of the graph search for people who like Georgetown University. Note the 
information on the right that shows over 1000 people like this. A list of attributes for 
filtering also appears there.

75
Obtaining data
Personal Profile
Users maintain extensive personal profiles, which are relatively static and contain 
background and demographic data. Once you have found a person, you will be taken to 
their Timeline, which mostly contains their status updates. The majority of profiles’ at-
tributes are on the user’s “About” page. You can access this by clicking “About” in the 
navigation bar next to the user’s profile picture at the top of the page (see Figure 8.11).
FIGURE 8.9
A filtered graph search for men who like Georgetown University and who went to school there, 
graduating in 2000. Unlike the many results in Figure 8.8, these results have only two people.
FIGURE 8.10
A post with all the associated information.

76
CHAPTER 8  Facebook
This section is where you will find background information, including users’ em-
ployment and education history, personal traits, their relationship status, lists of relatives, 
organizations they belong to, and things (books, music, movies, sports teams, ideas, and 
celebrities) they like. Figure 8.11 shows example user Malcom’s About page.
At the bottom of the first large section, titled “About,” there is a link that says 
“See more.” Clicking this will bring up more extensive personal information, includ-
ing contact information if the user has made it available.
Readers are encouraged to visit Malcom’s “About” page to see all the information 
available there.
Social Connections
Each user also has a “Friends” page with a list of his or her friends. This is accessible 
on another tab toward the top of a user’s page. Figure 8.12 shows Malcom’s friend list.
From this page, you can click on a friend’s name to visit their Timeline and find 
more information about them.
FIGURE 8.11
The “About” page for Malcom. It includes information like work and education, family, 
places Malcom has lived, background information, and photos.

77
Obtaining data
Note that someone’s friends can be valuable sources of information as well. For 
example, Forbes magazine describes how Facebook friends can share damaging evi-
dence during divorce cases:
Married couples often have dozens of mutual friends and connections. If the mar-
riage breaks up, obviously some of these people will be more loyal to one spouse 
than the other. I’ve had more than one client report a steady stream of information 
about her estranged husband’s financial activities, as relayed by mutual friends 
who were still following his Facebook updates. So, even if he’s blocked you from 
seeing his posts directly, your mutual friends can still tell you all about the ski trip 
he took to Switzerland with his girlfriend a week after claiming he couldn’t afford 
to pay spousal support.
—Jeff Landers, Forbes.com1
Activities
Users may post updates about their activities in their status updates that are visible 
on their Timeline. But for some events, there is a more formal log. In the same row 
of options with the Timeline, About, and Friends pages, there is an option that says 
“More ▼” Clicking this opens a menu that lists additional information about the user. 
This menu is highlighted in Figure 8.13.
FIGURE 8.12
The “Friends” page for the example user Malcom.

78
CHAPTER 8  Facebook
Most options on the More menu are simply sections of the “About” page, but 
there is some additional information. One such option is “Events.” Clicking that will 
bring up a list of events the user has attended. These “events” are created by other 
Facebook users and allow people to RSVP (or choose not to). The events might be 
parties, sporting events, concerts, special events that businesses put on, or pretty 
much anything else.
Figure 8.14 shows two upcoming events that Malcom is planning to attend. The 
events screen was accessed by clicking on the “Events” button. Past events will also 
be listed on this page.
Location Information
There are a few ways to find out where a target has been. Using the events page 
mentioned above is one option. It shows when people have been to an event, and 
patterns in those events may reveal a club, bar, or sports venue that the target visits 
frequently.
Status updates may also contain location information. Not every update will have 
a location, but users can choose to include that. If a location is included, it usually 
appears with “- at «location name»” at the end of the status update. Figure 8.15 
shows a status update from Malcom that includes the location “Elephant & Castle,” 
a bar in Washington, DC. The status update automatically gets a map that shows the 
location when the user lists one. You can click on the place name or the map to see 
more precise information about the location.

80
CHAPTER 8  Facebook
In the “More” menu shown in Figure 8.13, there is also an option called “Places.” 
This has map pins for every place users list in their status updates and all the places 
they have worked, lived, or attended school. Figure 8.16 shows Malcom’s Places 
page zoomed in on Washington, DC.
Clicking on a pin in this map will show all the status updates or profile informa-
tion associated with that location.
PRIVACY LEVELS AND ACCESS
There are three major levels of privacy on Facebook. Information can be public, 
which means it is visible to anyone online, even without a Facebook account. This 
is indicated with a small globe icon next to the post. You can see this icon in all the 
figures in this chapter that show a post by Malcom.
Users can restrict their information to be visible to their friends only. This re-
quires someone to have a friendship that the user has approved. They can also limit 
access to be visible to no one or to a customized list of people.
FIGURE 8.16
The map from Malcom’s Places page showing places he has mentioned in his status 
updates or listed in his profile.

81
Case studies
All the different types of information described above—including status updates, 
likes, and personal information—can be shared at different privacy levels. A user 
may make one status update public and restrict another to be visible only to friends. 
Thus, if you are looking at a person’s profile without a friend relationship with that 
person, you are not necessarily seeing all the information they have posted; you can 
see what is public, but not content restricted to a smaller audience.
Exact numbers on how openly people share are hard to come by and change 
quickly. A 2012 study suggested 28% of US Facebook users were sharing most of 
their posts with an audience bigger than just their friends. This means there is a de-
cent chance you will be able to find some information about a person on Facebook, 
even if you are not friends with them.
Obviously, becoming friends opens up a much wider set of information. In most 
cases, you will have access to the vast majority of a target’s content if your target has 
accepted your account as a friend.
EXAMPLE: MALCOM CONROY-SMITH
Malcom’s Facebook account is located here:
https://www.facebook.com/malcom.conroysmith
Browsing through his profile reveals many interesting things. He has posted 
background information, including where he grew up, where he went to school, and 
his job history. His contact information is also available.
But beyond the information he has explicitly shared, you can learn many things about 
his habits. Under the “Places” tab, you can see that Malcom posts a message almost 
every Friday evening from Elephant & Castle, a bar just a block from the International 
Monetary Fund where he works. That makes it a good place to look for him on Friday 
evenings. It’s also somewhere you might find other people who know him.
He also posts photos of his dog Barley and talks about taking her to the dog park. 
While no dog park is listed in Malcom’s Places, it is reasonable to make a first guess 
that the dog park is near Malcom’s house. Other places indicate that he goes grocery 
shopping (at Whole Foods Market Georgetown), to the CVS pharmacy, and to get his 
dry cleaning in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, DC.
A Google search for “dog park georgetown washington dc” pulls up several 
pages for Montrose Park, a leash-free park very close to Malcom’s residence. This 
would be another good location to look for people who know him or to spot Malcom 
himself.
CASE STUDIES
Because of Facebook’s popularity, there are many cases where it has been used in 
investigations. We will look at the results of both criminal and civil investigations 
that leveraged Facebook.

82
CHAPTER 8  Facebook
CRIMINAL CASES
Arrests that come from Facebook usually happen because the target was unable to 
keep his or her mouth shut about their crimes. Sometimes, posts are picked up and 
spread widely across social media that brings them to the attention of authorities. 
These cases are interesting; but in this chapter, as with this book as a whole, I focus 
on investigations of specific targets where information turned up online.
The beating of an 11-year-old. In April 2014, police arrested three people in 
Flint, Michigan, after they posted a video of themselves beating an 11-year-old boy 
with a belt as punishment.2 The video went viral and was eventually brought to the 
attention of police.
Colleen Cudney, a 22-year-old Michigan woman, was on probation for a drunk 
driving conviction.3 Part of the conditions of her release was that she will not drink.
On St. Patrick’s Day of 2014, she went out and drank anyway. The following 
day, she had to take a breathalyzer test, which she passed. She was so pleased that 
she decided to post about it on Facebook: “Buzz killer for me, I had to breath-
alyze [sic] this morning and I drank yesterday but I passed thank god lol my 
dumba@@.”
A local police officer saw the post and alerted her probation officer, ultimately 
leading to her arrest for violating her probation.
Jeremy Thompson, an Indiana man, was arrested for illegal manufacture and 
sale of liquor.4 After receiving a tip about the man, officers began monitoring his 
Facebook account. The target then posted a photo of himself with an illegal still on 
Facebook (Figure 8.17). Investigators found other photos of him illegally making

and selling moonshine. Ultimately, this provided cause for a search warrant. He was 
arrested and charged with five misdemeanors.
Danny Gough. On the other side of the world, criminals have used Facebook to 
obtain information about subjects as well. One of the more dramatic cases is that of 
Danny Gough. Following a feud that took place in the summer of 2010, authorities 
alleged that three men plotted a revenge killing. Gough had left town on vacation, 
but his alleged killers tracked his movements on Facebook and determined when he 
would be returning home. Gough was confronted outside his home by three masked 
men who brutally killed him. The alleged perpetrators were shown to have accessed 
Gough’s Facebook page just hours before the crime.5
CIVIL CASES
There are countless cases of people being sued, fired, or otherwise punished be-
cause of the things they posted on Facebook. These are not necessarily the case of 
targeted investigation of an individual, but rather the case where information was 
posted on Facebook. The posting was then brought to the attention of people who 
used it to make their argument. One of the most recent and dramatic stories comes 
from Florida.
Patrick Snay, a school administrator, had sued the school he worked for. The two 
parties settled and the school agreed to pay Snay $80,000. As part of the settlement, 
he signed a confidentiality clause, agreeing not to reveal any details of the settlement 
to anyone besides his attorneys and his spouse.
However, Snay told his teenage daughter about the settlement. She went on 
Facebook and posted the following status update:
Mama and Papa Snay won the case against Gulliver…Gulliver is now 
officially paying for my vacation to Europe this summer. SUCK IT.
The school found the post and used it as grounds to refuse to pay the settle-
ment. Snay appealed and lost—making his daughter’s status update a very costly 
Facebook post.6
CONCLUSION
Facebook, as the most popular social networking site in the world, is the most likely 
place to find a target. There is a wide range of information, from personal history, 
to social connections, to location. Within their posts, people often reveal a lot about 
their preferences and patterns of activity.
Facebook users do have a lot of control over the privacy of their information, and 
they often allow only friends to see it. However, a lot of people make their posts more 
public, which means an investigator may be able to access them without having an 
account that the target has friended. Because of the vast amount of accessible data, 
Facebook is widely used in investigations of all types.

CASE STUDY PARAGON: ANTHONY WEINER
Perhaps, the most famous case of someone's Twitter activities revealing far too 
much is that of Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-NY). On May 27, 2011, Weiner, 
­
at a 12-year-old woman who followed him on Twitter. The tweet contained a link 
to a picture that was a close-up of an erect penis concealed by a pair of boxer 
briefs.­
Because the post was publicly accessible for a time—until it was deleted—many 
people saw and archived it. Weiner was not explicitly being investigated by most of 
these people; politicians' accounts are regularly followed by people who are inter-
ested in all their activities, including those who are interested in any content that 
could be potentially damaging.
However, it turns out Weiner's Twitter activity was also being explicitly investi-
gated by a group of conservatives.2 For months before the tweet described above was 
posted, a group calling themselves the­ #bornfreecrew monitored Weiner's posts. 
They sent public messages to the women who followed him, warning them to “stay 
away” from him. The New York Times reports that there is even evidence that this 
group or others created fake Twitter accounts to try to entice Weiner into making 
­
3
It was one of these #bornfreecrew ­
inappropriate photo to his followers and eventually shared it with conservative pub-
lisher Andrew Breitbart. Breitbart then published the picture on his website.
As the news broke, Weiner responded by claiming that he had not posted the 
picture and that, instead, his account had been “hacked”.4 On June 6, 10 days 
after the original photo was tweeted, Breitbart published another photo of 
Weiner, this time shirtless, that was obtained from a woman who said Weiner had  
emailed to her.5
Weiner called a press conference the same day and confessed to posting the origi-
nal tweet, sending other pictures to women, and conducting “inappropriate” conver-
sations on Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms. Ten days later, on June 16, Weiner 
announced he would resign from Congress.
When you are being monitored on Twitter, a single post can have dramatic 
consequences.

CHAPTER 9  Twitter
TWITTER OVERVIEW
Twitter is a “microblogging” website. Recall that blogs emerged in the late 1990s 
and resembled online diaries. People could write anything they wanted and post it 
for people to read or comment on. While blogs could take any form, the posts were 
often essay length. Microblogging allows users to make posts, but they tend to be 
very short. Twitter limits posts to 140 characters. This creates an environment that is 
fundamentally different from blogging, since it is easy for someone to read hundreds 
of posts in a short amount of time.
Twitter is the largest microblogging website. It launched in 2006, and studies es-
timate there are close to one billion Twitter accounts. Twitter reports approximately 
250 million active users (where “active” is defined as someone who accesses the site 
at least once a month).
BASIC TWITTER ACTIVITIES
On Twitter, all activities center around two things: posting and reading.
Posting (“Tweeting”)
On Twitter, posts are called tweets, and the act of posting is called tweeting. Figure 9.1 
shows a tweet by our example user, Malcom. Roughly half of the 250 million active 
users will have tweeted in the last month, while the rest spend their time reading 
posts others have made.
Tweets are public by default. Anyone can read someone else's tweets by going 
to their Twitter account page. Figure 9.2 shows Malcom's Twitter profile with all of 
his tweets.
@mentions
Users can have public conversations on Twitter. This is done by using something 
called “@mentions” (pronounced “at mentions”). A user types an at sign, immedi-
ately followed by someone's username (sometimes called a “handle”). For example, 
if someone wanted to send a tweet directed at Malcom, then he or she would begin 
the tweet with “@malcomCsmith.”
FIGURE 9.1
A tweet posted by Malcom.

87
Twitter overview
Like all tweets, these are publicly visible. However, the user who is mentioned 
will have the tweet highlighted in a section of their profile. Some users receive a 
notification that they have been @mentioned.
Direct Messages
There is also an option to have private conversations, using a feature called direct 
messages. However, we won't focus on them here, since they're hidden and inacces-
sible to an investigation.
Hashtags
Finally, an online convention seen more and more across the web—but which began 
on Twitter—is the hashtag.
As discussed earlier in the book, a tag is a label applied to something in order to 
make finding it easier. On Twitter, tags are prepended with a “#” character (hence the 
name “hashtag”).
FIGURE 9.2
Malcom's Twitter profile with all of his tweets.

88
CHAPTER 9  Twitter
Some hashtags are obvious in meaning. For example, people often use a 
hashtag to indicate a sports team they are discussing, like #redsox or #chicago-
cubs. Other hashtags evolve by convention. The #ff hashtag stands for “follow 
Friday,” indicating a tweet where people list other users that they think are worth 
following.
Hashtags are also links. Thus, if a hashtag doesn't make sense to you by itself, 
you can click on it to see other tweets with the same hashtag. The context of the other 
tweets may reveal the hashtag's meaning.
Reading
If a user likes a tweet someone has posted, they can choose to show it by one of two 
actions: favoriting and retweeting.
Favoriting Tweets
Under Malcom's tweet in Figure 9.1, there is a small Favorite link beside a star icon. 
Sometimes, only the star icon is shown (see Figure 9.2). Clicking this will mark the 
tweet as a favorite.
User can go back and revisit their favorites. The tweet's original poster is notified 
when the tweet is favorited.
Retweeting Tweets
A user can also retweet, which reposts the original tweet onto the user's profile. In 
each of the figures mentioned above, the “retweet” option with a double arrow icon is 
shown to the right of the Favorite link. When a tweet is retweeted this way, it appears 
as though it came from the original poster.
Alternatively, some people retweet manually. This was commonly done in the 
early days of Twitter. A manual retweet is simply the copy-pasted text of another 
tweet, preceded by “RT” (meaning “ReTweet”) or “MT” (meaning “Modified 
Tweet,” if the user changed the original text). Manual retweets are still used when 
someone is adding a comment to the original. In Figure 9.3, Malcom has retweeted a 
post from NASA with commentary.
Following Users
If a user finds that someone often has interesting tweets, they can follow that per-
son. By doing so, the followed user's tweets are aggregated and displayed in reverse 
chronological order on the home page when a user logs in (see Figure 9.4).
There's an important difference between following and the “Add Friend” feature 
common among other social networks: following is a one-way relationship.
On sites like Facebook, friendships are mutual. If you add someone as a friend, 
they must approve the friendship, and it establishes a two-way relationship.
On Twitter, there is no requirement that a relationship goes both ways. For exam-
ple, in Figure 9.4, we can see that Malcom follows the official accounts for the NFL 
team Baltimore Ravens, the Discovery Channel show MythBusters, and Netflix's 
show House of Cards. By following them, Malcom is able to see their updates, but 
those accounts do not need to follow Malcom back (and probably won't).

89
Twitter overview
To follow someone, simply find someone's Twitter profile (more on this later), 
and click the Follow button (see Figure 9.5). The user will receive a notification that 
they have a new follower.
TWITTER DEMOGRAPHICS
Twitter skews slightly toward women, who make up 53% of users. Twitter users tend 
to be under 30 and it is much less popular among older Americans. Urban dwellers 
are also more active on Twitter.
One standout point about Twitter users comes in race. Twitter is much more pop-
ular among African-American users. Among all African-Americans online, 22% use 
FIGURE 9.3
Malcom has retweeted a post by NASA. Malcom's text (“AWESOME!”) appears at the 
beginning of the tweet. Then, the “RT” characters indicate the subsequent text is a 
retweet. The “@nasa” indicates that NASA's account posted the text, and finally, the 
original text from NASA's tweet appears.

FIGURE 9.4

Amazon listed as “Promoted”).

91
Finding people
Twitter compared with 16% of Caucasian internet users.6 Among younger people, 
the rate is even higher with 40% of African-Americans under 30 using Twitter.
FINDING PEOPLE
BY SEARCH
There are two major methods for finding people on Twitter. First is through search. 
At the top of every Twitter page is a search box. You can see an example of this in 
Figure 9.4 at the far upper right. You can enter a person's name in that box, and you will 
get a set of results that are different than what you would find on many other services.
The Twitter search returns a mix of tweets and people that match the search term. 
Figure 9.6 shows example results if we searched for “Malcom Smith.” You can see 
the three top users who match the search term at the top of the screen, followed by a 
list of tweets that match.
You can narrow this using the sections on the left. Note the check mark next to 
“Everything” at the top of the column on the left. If you click on “People,” you will 
see a list of people who have names, usernames, or personal descriptions that match 
your search term; the results will not include tweets. This is shown in Figure 9.7.
FIGURE 9.6
The results page on Twitter after searching for “Malcom Smith.” Notice both people and 
tweets are listed.

92
CHAPTER 9  Twitter
As with Facebook, people can be found using their name or their email address. 
Searching for an email address is often an effective way to find people who have 
chosen not to use their real name on Twitter. Even with a fake name, if you know the 
email addresses a target uses, you may be able to find them.
BY FOLLOW LISTS
Another way to find people is to look for them in the “Following” and “Follower” 
lists of their known associates. This is essentially doing a search of the target's social 
network, even though the network is not explicitly a friend network on Twitter like it 
is on sites like Facebook.
For example, if we want to find our target Malcom Conroy-Smith and can't find 
him using search, we may search the lists of his associates. Say we know he associ-
ates with the person who runs the account for Hopper Dog, a golden retriever.7 If we 
go directly to Hopper Dog's profile page, we can see several relevant links toward the 
top of the page. Figure 9.8 shows the number of “Following” (people Hopper Dog is 
following) and “Followers” toward the top of the page.
FIGURE 9.7
The “People” section of the Twitter search results page, showing a list of users who match 
the search term.

93
Finding people
Clicking on the number of Following or Followers will take us to a list of those 
people. For example, if we click on “Following,” we see all the people who are fol-
lowing Hopper Dog (see Figure 9.9). We can then browse through this list to see if 
Malcom Conroy-Smith appears there.
FIGURE 9.8
The top of Hopper Dog's profile shows the number of people she is following and the 
number of her followers. Clicking on one of those numbers will link to a list of those people.
FIGURE 9.9
A list of people following Hopper Dog.

94
CHAPTER 9  Twitter
OBTAINING DATA
You can get to a target's page by going to http://twitter.com/«SCREEN-NAME» 
(where “«SCREEN-NAME»” is replaced with the screen name the person uses on 
Twitter). Our example target uses @MalcomCsmith as his Twitter screen name, so his 
profile would be at http://twitter.com/MalcomCsmith.
USER PROFILES
A target's profile contains some basic information about them. (Note that Twitter 
doesn't have “full” profile pages, like Facebook.) At the top of a person's page, you'll 
see their name, a short description of themselves, and—if they've chosen to share 
it—their location.
The location on a user's profile is manually entered; it's not detected from their 
tweets. So, it could be specific (like a city name), generic (like “Earth”), or even 
something made up (e.g., “The Hanging Gardens of Babylon 5”).
Figure 9.10 shows Malcom's profile.
FIGURE 9.10
Malcom's biographical information from his Twitter profile.

95
Obtaining data
TWEETS
Much more information can be found in the tweets themselves. On a user's profile is 
a list of their tweets in reverse chronological order. Figure 9.2 above shows a list of 
Malcom's most recent tweets. The content of the tweets themselves often reveals a lot of 
information. However, you can find metadata about the tweets that are also very helpful.
TWEET'S TIME
Each tweet has an associated date and time it was posted. At the top of each tweet, 
you will see the user's real name, followed by their screen name, followed by a date 
or time.
The specific date and time is not always shown on the user's main page. For ex-
ample, in Figure 9.2, we can see his top tweet has a date of “Apr 16” but no time. The 
two tweets below that are also dated “Apr 16” followed by one on “Mar 11.”
Clicking on the date (e.g., “Apr 16”) takes you to a page for that specific tweet. 
This page has more extensive data—not only the date and time but also other data. 
Figure 9.11 shows the detail for Malcom's first tweet from Figure 9.2.
TWEET'S LOCATION
On a specific tweet's page, its location may also be available. Not all tweets will have 
location information, since users can choose not to share it.
FIGURE 9.11
The details of one of Malcom's tweets. Note the additional date and time information at the 
bottom of the page. Under the image is a more specific date and time.

96
CHAPTER 9  Twitter
However, when location information is there, it is extremely specific. In 
Figure 9.11, Malcom's tweet is listed as being in “Washington, DC.” This is under 
the text of the tweet but above the photo next to the pin icon. The name of the city is 
itself a link. Clicking the link takes you to a detailed Google Map, with a pin marking 
the exact GPS coordinates of the tweet (Figure 9.12).
FOLLOW LISTS
Finally, friends and followers are available through a person's profile. These social 
connections are different than what we find in many social networks, since they do 
not reflect any relationship between the two users. Followers are simply interested 
in someone's tweets.
This isn't to say that social relationships don't exist on Twitter but rather that they 
can't be assumed from the presence of a follow relationship.
In this case, looking at the tweets people exchange (especially through @men-
tions) can reveal the nature of their relationship.
PRIVACY LEVELS AND ACCESS
Privacy is very straightforward on Twitter. Users either can make all of their tweets 
totally public or can restrict access to their accounts. This is called a “protected” 
account. In this case, only a user's followers can read the user's tweets, and those 
FIGURE 9.12
The map that we are taken to when clicking on the location of Malcom's tweet shown in 
Figure 9.11. Note that the precise GPS coordinates are given in the location box, and the 
pin shows the precise location along with the coordinates.

97
Privacy levels and access
followers need to be approved by the user. Estimates put the percentage of protected 
accounts under 12%, so the vast majority of people have totally public accounts.
There is no mechanism for limiting access to some tweets and not others. Thus, if 
you find someone's page and it is not marked as protected, you know you are seeing 
all of the target's tweets.
As mentioned above, direct messages between users are not public. These are 
similar to email messages sent within Twitter. They are restricted to 140 characters, 
but access to these direct messages is always limited to the two people participating 
in the conversation.
EXAMPLE
When users have location information turned on in their Twitter accounts, it can re-
veal a lot about their lives. Consider our example target Malcom. He has location tag-
ging turned on for almost all of his tweets. We could collect the GPS location of each 
tweet manually and then plot these on Google Maps or some other mapping tool.
In fact, interest in this kind of analysis is so common that there is a tool to do it 
called GeoSocial Footprint: http://geosocialfootprint.com.
At that website, you can put in a target's Twitter screen name and it will pull 
location from the target's last 200 tweets and plot them on a map. As an example, 
if we put Malcom's screen name into this website, it produces the following map 
(Figure 9.13).
Each pin marks a location from which Malcom has tweeted. Clicking on the pins 
pulls up the tweet associated with that location. Thus, not only can we see where 
Malcom goes, but also we can find out what he is doing in those locations. We can 
see many tweets centered around his place of work in the center of the screen and in 
the place he lives (toward the left on the map).
FIGURE 9.13
A heat map from geosocialfootprint.com of Malcom's tweets.

98
CHAPTER 9  Twitter
CASE STUDIES
Twitter is a very popular social media site, and it is particularly useful for investiga-
tion since almost all tweets are totally public. Thus, it is an easy platform to find out 
a lot about targets if they have accounts.
FAMILY LAW
Rackham Karlsson, a Boston-area attorney, shared a story with me of a family law 
case he worked. An unmarried couple with two children had separated and were 
fighting for custody and child support arrangements. The father claimed he had very 
little income. The mother knew he had worked as a nightclub promoter, but the father 
insisted he was not making any money from that job.
Using the father's known email addresses, attorneys were able to find a Twitter 
account for him under a different name, which he was actively using as part of job as 
a promoter. This allowed the opposing side to offer evidence both of his deception 
and of his income that was used to calculate child support.
HIRING AND FIRING
I spoke with many people who were in charge of hiring and firing who reported using 
Twitter. To my surprise, the majority of their responses were positive; many people 
emailed me reports of looking up applicants online and being so impressed with their 
online presence that they made them a job offer. However, as you might expect, some 
of the more interesting stories were negative.
Mitch Donaberger is the social media manager for Saladworks, a nationwide 
chain of salad-oriented restaurants with over 100 locations. As part of his job, he 
monitors employees and the company's reputation online.
One example he gave of how he used Twitter was in investigating a person who 
posted this photo (Figure 9.14).
The employee tweeted that she had worn flip-flops into an active kitchen—a 
violation of company policy and health safety laws. To comply, she put bags over 
the flip-flops and, as we can see, took a photo and posted it. Though she did not 
reveal her name or location on Twitter, Mr. Donaberger was able to cross-reference 
it against her other social media accounts and identify her name and general location 
and ultimately the store she worked in. Within a day, she was fired for damaging the 
brand through her post.
CRIME
Bad guys use Twitter, too—sometimes to investigate their targets. A dramatic case of 
this occurred in the United Kingdom.8
James Charters, known publicly as DJ Ironik, is a rapper and musician based in 
the United Kingdom. He has had notable musical success, including his song “Tiny 
Dancer,” which featured Elton John and reached number three on the charts.

99
Conclusions
On November 6, 2010, he was returning home after a performance at the Element 
Nightclub in Southend-on-Sea in the United Kingdom. As he approached his home, 
two hooded men attacked him in an apparent robbery. Ironik tried to throw his diamond 
necklace toward the men and flee, but the attackers managed to stab him in the leg. The 
wound was severe enough that he spent the weekend in the hospital receiving treatment.
The attackers apparently knew of his location by monitoring his Twitter account. 
After Ironik had boasted on TV about the value of his jewelry, the muggers moni-
tored his Twitter account to track his location. On the night before the attack, Ironik 
had tweeted about his performance at the Element Nightclub. The attackers used this 
to learn when he would be returning home and to wait there to ambush him.
Fortunately, Ironik fully recovered from his attack.
CONCLUSIONS
Twitter is a social media platform where people often post frequent updates. Photos 
and location information are quite common relative to what you might see on other 
sites. Also, the privacy issues are relatively simple since a person's tweets are either 
totally public or completely restricted to approved followers.
While profile information on Twitter is limited, people who post tend to do so 
frequently, sharing a lot of information about their daily activities.

kitchen.

Foursquare
DESCRIPTION
Foursquare is a location-based social media service. It works primarily on mobile 
devices, like iPhones and Android phones. Users check in at places like stores, res-
­
in. There is also a game element of Foursquare. Users receive points for each check-
in, and they can see a leaderboard that lists all their friends ranked by the number of 
points they have.
­
only Facebook, which offers location-tagging abilities to all of its 1.4 billion 
users. Foursquare has around 45 million users, with around 6 million check-ins 
per day.
When a user launches the Foursquare app, they see a list of places near them 
where they can check in. If a place is not on Foursquare already—for example, if 
a new restaurant opened—the user can add it. Figure 10.1 shows an example list of 
nearby places.
When a user chooses a place, they see information about the venue, including 
the address and hours, business details when appropriate (like if they accept credit 
cards), tips provided by other users, a map, and the name of the mayor.
­
 
 shows the venue page for the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. 
The “mayor” of a venue is the person who has checked in there the most, with higher 
weight given to more recent check-ins.
On that page at the top is a “Check In Here” button. A user may press it to 
­
details about their personal experience with the venue. Figure  10.3 shows an 
example.
After dismissing the check-in info, the user now sees additional information about

Figure 10.4 shows the 
additional information that appears on the venue page. Profile pictures for other users 
are blurred to protect their privacy.
A user receives points for each check-in. The game component of Foursquare al-
lows them to see how many points they have relative to their friends. Through their 
profile page, a person can see his or her leaderboard, which ranks the user and his or 
her friends according to points (see Figure 10.5).

CHAPTER 10  Foursquare
FOURSQUARE DEMOGRAPHICS
Foursquare users tend to be male (60% male vs. 40% female) and college-educated 
(60% have a college degree). It is roughly as popular with younger users (ages 18-29) 
and slightly older users (ages 30-42), with both comprising about 40% of the user 
base. The average income is around $50,000 per year. Hispanics also tend to be more 
frequent users of Foursquare, using check-in services at twice the rate of the overall 
population.

Finding people
FINDING PEOPLE
BY FACEBOOK, TWITTER, OR CONTACT INFO
If you are connected to a person on Facebook or Twitter, you can link your accounts 
and add them that way. If you know the person's email address or mobile phone 
­number, you can put them in your contact list on your mobile phone and then add 
people that way. These options are shown in Figure 10.6.
BY NAME
Figure 10.6 shows that you can also search for a person by name. If you choose this op-
tion, you can search by first or last name. Users' full names and profile pictures will ap-
pear in the search results, but the results are usually limited to roughly 100 results (even 
for searches with common names like “Smith”). Figure 10.7 shows a search results page.
BY FRIENDS' PROFILES
You can also locate people through social contacts. When you look at the public 
profile of a person, you can see a list of that person's friends. That means even if you 
are not friends with a target, or if you want to avoid connecting with a target, you can 
still get to their profile if you can find an associate.

106
CHAPTER 10  Foursquare
Figure 10.8 shows the profile page for a user. The grid underneath the profile photo 
includes a “Friends” section. You can see this grid for any user. Clicking on that Friends 
section will link to a list of friends, which appears much like the list in Figure 10.7.
BY OTHER SEARCH METHODS
As mentioned above, when you look at the page for a venue, the mayor is listed. 
Clicking on the mayorship (the bottom of Figure 10.2 is one example) takes you to 
the public page for the mayor.
Similarly, when you check in to a venue, you see a list of others checked in there 
(shown in Figure 10.4). If you click on the title “You are here” in that section of 
the page, it brings up a list of everyone checked in. This list is shown in Figure 10.9 
(with blurring for privacy). Clicking on anyone's name in this list will take you to 
their public page.
These features mean that, even if you cannot find someone in a search or through 
other social contacts, you may be able to find them if you know where they are 
checked in at a given moment—or if you know places they check in frequently and 
may be listed as mayor.

Obtaining data
OBTAINING DATA
Once you have found a person, you can find out information from their profile. 
Depending on whether or not you are friends with them on Foursquare, different data 
is available.
FROM NONFRIENDS
Figure 10.10 shows a profile page for Malcom as it appears to a nonfriend. This is the 
view you will have if you locate someone through a mayorship, check-in, or someone 
else's friend list.
This has a grid of icons. The “Friends” square in the upper left links to a list of 
Malcom's friends. The “Stats” square in the top center links to a list of mayorships 
that the user holds. This can be extremely informative. A user becomes mayor of a 
place when they check in there very frequently. If a person has many mayorships, it 
can paint a detailed picture of the places they frequent.
Figure 10.11 shows the mayorships for Malcom on the “Stats” page. You can 
see he is listed as mayor of the IMF, where he works. He is also mayor of a Chipotle 
restaurant.

list of friends.

FIGURE 10.9
A list of other people checked in at the same venue as the user. Clicking their name will 
take you to their public profile page.
FIGURE 10.10
The view of a user's profile when you are not friends with them.

109
Obtaining data
There are many of these restaurants, but clicking on the item in the mayorship list 
will take you to the venue page for that specific restaurant and show you its address. 
This could let you know which restaurants Malcom frequents.
Other items on the grid include “Photos,” which links to pictures the person has 
taken at different check-ins; “Tips,” which are tips associated with specific venues; 
“Badges,” which list accomplishments in the game component of Foursquare; and 
“Lists,” which may include lists of favorite venues or places the person wants to visit.
FROM FRIENDS
Much more information is available to friends. Figure 10.12 shows Malcom's profile 
page when we are friends with him. Beneath the grid in Figure 10.10, there is a list 
of the user's check-ins. The list can be scrolled to reveal more check-ins the person 
has made. Once you hit the bottom of the list, it loads the next batch of check-ins, 
allowing you to scroll continually back in time.
Each check-in has a date, time, and the location of the check-in. When a user has many 
check-ins, this list can help you build a profile of their activities, including the places they 
frequent, the neighborhoods they often visit, and when they tend to be in each area.
Friends may also have access to one another's email address and phone number. 
In the top right of the profile page (as shown in Figure 10.12), there is a contact link. 
That will take you to the contact information that a user has made available to friends.
FROM OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKS
Finally, some users connect their Foursquare accounts to other social media, espe-
cially Twitter. If you know someone's Twitter account, you may find links to their 
Foursquare check-ins there. This can give you access to individual check-ins, even 
if you are not friends with the person on Foursquare. Figure 10.13 shows what a 
Foursquare check-in looks like on Twitter.
FIGURE 10.11
Malcom's “Stats” page showing his mayorships.

110
CHAPTER 10  Foursquare
If you click on the 4sq.com link in the tweet (or other social media post), it will reveal 
a Foursquare page for the check-in itself, which includes the specific location, date, and 
time of the check-in. Figure 10.14 shows the page for the check-in from Figure 10.13.
PRIVACY
Because location information is quite sensitive—especially a very comprehensive 
list of all the places a person goes, which is available for active Foursquare users—
there are many privacy protections available on the service. As seen above, check-in 
FIGURE 10.12

111
Privacy
data is only available for a person's friends to see. A user may also control which, if 
any, of their contact information is visible to friends.
Users can also control how publicly they can be seen. They can prevent them-
selves from being seen on the list of people checked in at a venue (as shown in 
FIGURE 10.13
A Foursquare check-in on Twitter.
FIGURE 10.14

CHAPTER 10  Foursquare
Figure 10.9). They can also opt out of being eligible for mayorships, since that “of-
fice” is always public.
Users cannot opt out of appearing in search results, but they are not required to use 
their full name. Some only identify by a username, while others (like the author, whose 
account “Jen G” appears in some Figures) use a shortened version of their name.
CASE STUDIES
Despite its privacy controls, Foursquare has been used to investigate people and 
catch them misbehaving.
ALI ESLAMI
In Middletown, Connecticut, the Community Health Center, a nonprofit medical 
clinic, used Foursquare check-in data in a complaint against its former information 
technology director.1 Ali Eslami, the IT director and “director of innovation,” was 
involved in a complex disagreement with the clinic. He claimed he was fired for 
revealing information about security weaknesses in the clinic's information systems. 
The clinic claimed he stole emails and posted them online, illegally obtained patient 
records, and threatened his superiors online.
The latter claim is where Foursquare entered the picture. After his firing, Eslami 
posted a message on Twitter, directed at the clinic, that read “911 dispatch, how can 
we assist. We need a swat team here” with a picture of the CEO's house attached. 
He then used Foursquare to check in at the children's museum founded by the CEO's 
wife. He also repeatedly checked in at the clinic on Foursquare as he drove past.
The clinic used this information as evidence of “threats” in a complaint filed 
against Eslami.
CREDIT CARD COMPANIES
Credit card companies are also using Foursquare to analyze people's habits and in 
particular to predict whether someone is likely to get divorced.2 The idea is simple: 
married people tend to patronize different types of businesses than single people. 
Credit card companies already have insights into this from people's purchases on 
their cards. However, Foursquare can provide those insights even when people mix 
cards or pay cash. This lets a card company use a person's behavior to predict credit 
risk and make decisions about extending credit and managing accounts. It's a large-
scale way that Foursquare is used to investigate individuals.
AVOIDR
And in one amusing way to use Foursquare to investigate people, an app called 
Avoidr connects to Foursquare and helps people avoid their exes.3 It will track your 
ex's (or other enemy's) check-ins and let you know where they are, so you never have 
to run into them.

113
Notes
CONCLUSIONS
Foursquare, a popular location-sharing social media site, allows people to check in at 
different venues, track where they visit, and earn points in an in-app game with their 
friends. You can find users by name or social connection or through venues they are 
visiting or frequently visit.
Without being friends, you can still discover the places a user frequents through 
mayorships and possibly through their external social media sites, like Twitter, where 
they may post check-in information. If you are friends with a person on Foursquare, 
you can see the full list of all their check-ins, which allows you to develop a detailed 
understanding of where they go, when they go there, and what patterns appear in 
their behavior.
Although Foursquare has conservative privacy policies that allow users to protect 
a lot of their information, there are many traces that can be picked up about a person 
and where they go.

Pinterest
DESCRIPTION OF THE SITE
Pinterest is a relative newcomer to the social media scene, but it is quickly becom-
ing one of the most prominent sites in terms of driving traffic and holding users' 
­
PINS
The site's premise is simple: it's a visual bookmarking tool. It replicates a more old-
fashioned concept; people would cut out pictures or articles from magazines and pin 
­
pinterest) or organize them in folders. 
Pinterest does the same thing for the web. Users can create a post, called a pin, from 
any site. The pin must be an image. Users can add a caption and the image will have 
a link back to the original site. Pins are organized on thematic boards.
Figure 11.1 shows an example of an image pinned on Pinterest. It includes infor-
mation about the top with a button that allows the user currently looking at it to add 
the image to one of his own boards, a number showing how many other people have 
­
BOARDS
A Pinterest board is a collection of pins. Figure 11.2 shows a board with images from 
the Hubble Space Telescope. Clicking on an image will bring up a larger version, 
such as what is seen in ­
 
.
Users can create as many boards as they like on Pinterest. Boards do not need 
to follow any organizational structure, but they tend to each have a specific theme. 
Figure 11.3 shows what a user's list of boards might look like. This is the main view 
­
photos, like in Figure 11.2.
ADDING PINS
People generally add pins to their boards in one of two ways: They repin posts from 
other users that they find within Pinterest; or they pin content from external sites.

will reveal all the other images on the board.

117
Description of the site
Via Repinning
Figure 11.1 shows the red “Pin” button at the top of a post, which allows anyone to 
repin that photo (with its accompanying link) to their own board.
Pictures and links to external sites can be added in a couple major ways. First, 
many sites now have built-in functionality to share an item on Pinterest within their 
own sites. Figure 11.4 shows an example from the J.Crew website. Note the Pinterest 
icon in the lower right (found in the red box, which is added for emphasis).
Clicking the Pinterest icon there brings up a window to create the pin, shown in 
Figure 11.5. This window is actually part of Pinterest (you can see pinterest.com in 
the address bar at the top of the page). Once the user clicks the red “Pin it” button, 
the image is added to the board they have selected.
Via New Pins
The second way people can add images from external sites is by using a Pinterest 
“bookmarklet” or browser extension. Users can add this extension from the Pinterest 
site or through their browser's extension marketplace.
Figure 11.6 shows this browser extension at work. It appears as a Pinterest icon 
to the right of the address bar (a red circle with a curly “P” in it). If users click that, 
they see a list of all the images on the page. They can choose the one they want and 
pin it much in the same way as is shown in Figure 11.5.
Users can also upload their own photos from their computer, but this is a much 
less common way of adding content to the site.

Description of the site
FOLLOWING USERS
The social aspect of Pinterest is in following others. Following on Pinterest works 
in much the same way as it does on Twitter; users can follow one another, and it is 
a one-way relationship (i.e., it doesn't require approval or “following back”). When 
this occurs, any pins from the followed person are displayed on the home page. A 
person can follow all of another user's boards or select particular boards.
INFLUENCE ON TRAFFIC
The power Pinterest is assuming in the social media space is because of its ability to 
drive traffic to other sites. Because it is based on the idea of sharing images that link 
to other places, every pin is a link. Sites have started creating interesting, beautiful, or 
attention grabbing images specifically to be attractive for sharing on Pinterest. This 
sharing gets links to their content in front of a large audience.
FIGURE 11.6
The Pinterest browser extension appears as a button to the right of the address bar. When 
clicked, all the pinnable images on the page appear so the user can select which he or she 
wants to add to a board.

120
CHAPTER 11  Pinterest
As of early 2014, Pinterest was only second to Facebook in the amount of web 
traffic they were responsible for. Over 3% of every click on the web that took people 
to another site came from Pinterest. It drives more traffic than Twitter, LinkedIn, red-
dit, and Google+ combined.
In terms of investigation, it is also a place where users spend a lot of time curating 
content that they believe reflects their personality and interests. As such, it can reveal 
a lot about a person even though there is no personal text or location information, as 
is so important on other sites.
USER DEMOGRAPHICS
Pinterest has about 70 million users. It is quite popular in the United States, with 
around 21% of US internet users on Pinterest. The most distinguishing characteristic 
of Pinterest is that the vast majority of its users (≈80%) are women.
Pinterest users tend to be white, well educated, and with higher incomes. Age is 
not a big factor on Pinterest. Younger users ages 18-29 make up around 20% of the 
Pinterest population as do users ages 30-49.
FINDING PEOPLE
As with many of the social networking sites we have seen, there are two major 
ways to find people on Pinterest: a direct search for their name and through social 
connections.
VIA SEARCH
At the top left of each Pinterest page, as you can see in Figures 11.2 and 11.3, is a 
search box. This is a universal search for pins, boards, and people. You can search 
for a person by their actual name or by their username. When you search, you will 
see three tabs toward the top of the window on the left: Pins, Boards, and Pinners. 
This is shown in Figure 11.7. Clicking the Pinners tab will take you to a list of users 
who match your search term. While full names and usernames will work here, email 
addresses will not.
VIA USER PROFILES
If you cannot find someone through a direct search for their real name or username, 
you might try looking at their profile. For any individual user, you can see the full 
list of people whom they follow and who follow them. On a person's page, there 
are tabs for both of these groups, shown in Figure 11.8. If you know or can find the 
Pinterest page for an associate of your target, you may find the target's profile in 
one of these lists.

121
Obtaining data
OBTAINING DATA
To investigate a target on Pinterest, his main page will be the primary source of 
information. The boards they have will reveal their interests and tastes, as will the 
individual pins on them.
For example, consider Figures 11.9-11.12. These show the first fifteen boards of 
four randomly selected Pinterest users. You should be able to develop a profile for each 
user with very little additional information; all four users have quite distinct interests.
FIGURE 11.7

The lower right of this image shows the tabs that link to lists of people who follow the user 
and who the user is following.

FIGURE 11.12

124
CHAPTER 11  Pinterest
In fact, the ability of Pinterest to reveal private insights into users' life events is 
actually something that has been documented in the media on occasion.1 Because 
Pinterest allows users to easily collect ideas for planning life events—the two of 
the most popular search terms on Pinterest are “wedding” and “baby shower”—the 
creation of boards on a topic has signaled events to friends who follow a person on 
the site. Good Morning America reports many stories of women who started boards 
on Pinterest to plan their wedding or pregnancy and who received messages in 
response from friends or family who found out about the upcoming event through 
the board.
PRIVACY LEVELS AND ACCESS
Privacy on Pinterest is quite straightforward. By default, all boards and pins are 
public. The only way to change that is to create a “secret” board. These boards can 
be shared with individual users. Many people can be part of a secret board, but they 
need to be invited individually. There is no way to create boards visible only to 
“friends,” for example. Secret boards do not show up for anyone other than the user 
and those invited to the board, so their existence can't be discovered by anyone not 
authorized to see them.
Since most content is posted from external sites, rather than being personal in-
formation uploaded directly, there tends to be less sensitive information shared on 
Pinterest. As a result, the vast majority of content is public.
CASE STUDIES
Aside from the examples of pregnancy and marriage described above, there are ex-
amples of where Pinterest has revealed insights into targets' state of mind or criminal 
interests.
SHANNON CONLEY
A 19-year-old American girl, Shannon Conley, was arrested on terrorism charges 
after a six-month dramatic transformation2. The girl had met her 32-year-old 
Tunisian “boyfriend” online at that point and quickly turned to extremist Islam. 
Her social media interests went from pretty typical teen postings to violent Islamist 
posts. Her parents had contacted authorities a number of times over the 6 months 
of her change. She was eventually arrested as she boarded a flight to Turkey, where 
said she planned to join ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), sponsored by her 
boyfriend.
While her Facebook and Pinterest pages were not used to discover her terrorist activ-
ities, they did illustrate the shift in her interests. She posted pictures of herself in a burka 
and quotes and images promoting violent jihad and that were anti-Christian and Jewish.

125
Notes
REBECCA SHAW
Contact through Pinterest has also led to legal problems for some people. In 2013, 
Rebecca Shaw was arrested for violating a restraining order because she followed 
her estranged daughter on Pinterest.3 Whether or not this was an actual violation of 
the order is a tricky question. When the mother followed the daughter, Pinterest au-
tomatically sent a message informing the daughter of the new follower. The mother 
did not intentionally contact her daughter. However, the action of following could 
send a message of “I am watching you,” which can be considered threatening. This 
kind of issue is one that will have to work its way through the courts.
PAUL WEISER
Pinterest revealed similar things about Paul Weiser.4 He had written to advice-columnist 
Dear Abby in 2012 about his sexual interest in children. She reported him and he 
spent several years in prison for possession of child pornography. After his release, 
he was listed in the Wisconsin Sex Offender Registry.
He fell under suspicion again when he tried to order dolls designed for little girls. 
Investigators looked at his Pinterest page that included one board called “Things I 
Love.” That board was a collection of photos of open-mouthed preadolescent girls. 
The Department of Justice eventually discovered he had been recording and photo-
graphing children in his neighborhood, and he was rearrested and sent to jail. While 
the Pinterest pictures themselves were not illegal, they indicated to police that Weiser 
was still pursuing his sexual interest in children.
CONCLUSIONS
Pinterest is a fast-growing social media site dedicated to visual bookmarking. Users 
post pins, individual photos that link back to their source website. Pins are collected 
on boards that generally have a common theme. Users can follow other people's 
boards to keep up to date on what they are pinning.
The vast majority of Pinterest users are women, and they use the site for many 
purposes, including planning life events. This is one insight you may be able to ob-
tain through a Pinterest investigation. Overall, it is also an excellent reflection of a 
person's interests and aspirations, allowing you to develop a good understanding of a 
target's personality and hobbies.

LinkedIn
INTRODUCTION
One of the best stories of using LinkedIn for investigation comes from Michael 
Lewis’s book Flash Boys­
Street and realize that a type of computerized trading, high-frequency trading (HFT), 
has biased the equity market in favor of the big investment banks. The group, the 
eponymous flash boys, set out to investigate the big banks and expose how they are 
­
As part of their search, one of the men, John Schwall, begins searching for peo-
ple involved in HFT on LinkedIn. However, many banks did not want to appear as 
though they were involved in HFT. Thus, they did not advertise their HFT groups, 
and their employees did not have titles that reflected this.
Schwall was determined to identify the people involved in HFT. He began with 
one person, Josh Stampfli, who had joined the electronic trading group at Credit 
Suisse after working for now-disgraced investor Bernie Madoff. After identifying 
Stampfli as being involved with HFT at Credit Suisse, Schwall looked him up on 
LinkedIn and, from there, found a list of his contacts. From there, he followed to a 
list of their contacts, and so on. Among the people he came across were dozens of 
programmers who openly listed their responsibilities as including programming for 
­
chart for the group at Credit Suisse undertaking HFT.
DESCRIPTION OF THE SITE
LinkedIn is a social networking website where people maintain profiles and create 
connections with associates. It is explicitly designed for professional interactions. 
The site has roughly 200 million members, with roughly one-third of its traffic 
coming from the United States. Profiles are extensive and focus on education, 
­
endorse.
Since LinkedIn is very professional, instead of creating a fake account for our 
example user Malcom, we will look at the author’s profile in this chapter. Pictures 
and names of other users are blurred out in the images to protect their privacy.
The main activities on LinkedIn are profile maintenance and adding contacts.
­

128
CHAPTER 12  LinkedIn
USER PROFILES
A user’s profile consists of a number of sections, set up to approximate what you 
might find on a resume. They include work experience, education, projects, publica-
tions, skills, and organizations. Figure 12.1 shows the author’s profile with summary 
information and the beginning of the experience section.
VIEWING PROFILES
Because professional networking is the core of LinkedIn’s model, there are some 
important things to note about accessing information on the site:
•	
If you are not logged in, you see a different version of a person’s profile than if 
you are logged in.
•	
If you have an account and are logged in, when you visit a person’s profile, your 
visit is logged and information about your visit is shared with the target. (You 
can browse “anonymously” while logged in, but you need to change specific 
settings to make it happen.)
FIGURE 12.1
A LinkedIn profile page including summary information and some background.

129
Introduction
This makes LinkedIn a significant exception to the general rule that your social 
media browsing will not be tracked.
Figure 12.1 shows a profile’s appearance when the viewer is logged in. If the 
viewer is not logged in, a more résumé-like profile is shown. Figure 12.2 depicts the 
author’s profile in the logged-out view.
ADDING CONTACTS
To create a social connection on LinkedIn, the “Connect” button next to the person’s 
photo on their profile page (also shown in Figure 12.1) will launch a dialogue. The 
person initiating the connection must indicate he knows the person he is connecting 
to, either through their work at the same organization, through a shared educational 
institution, or by providing an email address. This is designed to limit spam and 
anonymous connections, since the site wants to encourage real-life connections. All 
relationships on LinkedIn are reciprocal; when one person requests a connection, the 
other must approve it.
Once people have made connections, there are two main activities: updates and 
endorsements.
FIGURE 12.2
A profile view when the viewer is not logged in to LinkedIn.

CHAPTER 12  LinkedIn
Updates
Updates on LinkedIn are similar to posts you might see on Facebook or Twitter. 
When a person posts an update, it appears on the home page feed of their con-
nections. However, one critical difference between LinkedIn and other sites is 
that a person’s updates cannot be retrieved through their profile. Essentially, if 
someone posts an update, the only way to find it is for one of their contacts to 
scroll through all of the updates they can see in hopes of finding it. This empha-
sizes the relatively low-importance updates have on LinkedIn. The relationships 
are the main focus.
Endorsements
As part of a relationship, a person can endorse someone else’s skills. Figure 12.3 
shows the list of skills on the author’s profile along with the number of people who 
have endorsed that she has that skill.

User demographics
Viewing the Viewers
Finally, because social connections are so important on LinkedIn, it has a very unique 
feature: a user can see who has been looking at his profile. Figure 12.4 shows the au-
thor’s page of views. Faces and names of people who viewed the profile are blurred 
for anonymity.
The view in Figure 12.4 is what someone with a free LinkedIn profile can see. 
People who pay to upgrade their accounts can see additional information and longer 
lists of people who have visited their page.
USER DEMOGRAPHICS
Because LinkedIn is a professional site, it has demographics that are quite different 
from most social media sites. It tends to have more men than women, about 62% to 
38%. The population of users is older than many other sites. The 25-34, 35-44, and 
45-54-year-old age groups each make up about 20% of the users on the site. Users

among social media websites that a user can see who has been viewing their information.

CHAPTER 12  LinkedIn
are more affluent. Eighteen percent of users make between $100,000 and $150,000 
per year, and 14% make over $150,000. In that same vein, users tend to have higher 
education levels than the overall US population; 78% have a college degree, and 27% 
have attended graduate school. Ethnically, the site is dominated by Caucasians, who 
account for 79% of users, but Asians are represented more highly than in the overall 
population, accounting for 6% of the users.
Overall, if you are looking for a professional adult, there is a good chance they 
maintain a LinkedIn profile.
FINDING PEOPLE
VIA SEARCH
If you are not logged in to LinkedIn, you can search for people on the main page. 
Figure 12.5 shows this page. While it largely features information about creating 
an account, lower down on the page, below the main white section, is an option to 
FIGURE 12.5
If you are not logged in to LinkedIn, you can search for people with the “Find a colleague” 
section that appears under the main white part of the page. In this example, “Jennifer” 
and “Golbeck” are filled in the first and last name sections.

133
Finding people
“Find a colleague.” This includes first and last name boxes. The results of this search 
will be similar to what is shown in Figure 12.2. If multiple people match the search, 
you will see short summaries for each, similar to what appears in the top section of 
Figure 12.2 next to the photo.
You cannot access any more information about people from this point unless you 
log in to LinkedIn.
When you are logged in, you get a denser set of search result as shown in 
Figure 12.6. From here, you can click on a person’s name to see their full profile as 
it appears in Figure 12.1. (Remember: visiting someone’s LinkedIn page while you 
are logged in leaves a trace that the person can see.) Either a link to your profile or a 
slightly anonymized version of your profile without a link will be shown to the user 
on the page shown in Figure 12.4. This means you should carefully consider how you 
browse someone’s LinkedIn profile.
VIA KNOWN ASSOCIATES
On other sites, it is possible to find someone through their known associates, but 
this ability is much more limited on LinkedIn. You cannot see someone’s social con-
nections if you are not logged in to LinkedIn. If you are logged in, you can see how 
many connections a target has (this is in the lower right corner of the top box in 
Figure 12.1). However, you can only see a full list of who those connections are when 
you have a LinkedIn relationship with the target. If you are exploring the target’s 
profile and you are not connected to the target, you can only see people who are your 
mutual connections. If you have no mutual connections, you cannot see anyone on 
the target’s connection list.
FIGURE 12.6
To change your privacy settings, including the ability to browse anonymously, click 
“Review” next to “Privacy & Settings.”

134
CHAPTER 12  LinkedIn
Thus, if you do not know where the target’s account is, you may be able to find 
him by connecting with his known associates. This allows you to browse the associ-
ate’s connections. Without connections to people close to the target, this technique 
will not be effective on LinkedIn.
OBTAINING DATA
As mentioned above, LinkedIn records information about your visits to other peo-
ple’s profiles. This is an important factor to consider if you do not want targets to 
know that you have visited their profiles. If you want to browse anonymously, you 
must change a setting.
In the upper right corner, mouse over your profile picture and click “Review” next 
to “Privacy & Settings” (see Figure 12.6).
About halfway down the privacy settings page, find the section labeled Privacy Controls 
(see Figure 12.7). Click on “Select what others see when you’ve viewed their profile.”
The pop-up will show three options. To browse anonymously, choose the bottom 
option, “You will be totally anonymous.” The middle “anonymous” option will not 
truly anonymized your browsing. See Figure 12.8 for the options in this window.
There are two major types of data you can obtain on LinkedIn for a target:
•	
Profile information is accessible on a target’s page, as shown in Figures 12.1 and 12.2. 
This includes work history, interests, projects they have worked on, and publications.
•	
Contact information (a list of the target’s connections) is available for people 
with whom you have a LinkedIn relationship. In Figure 12.1, you can see a 
number of contacts in the lower right of the summary profile box toward the top 
of the page. This number appears in blue and is “458” in Figure 12.1. Clicking 
this number will take you to a list of the person’s contacts. If he has not made 
the contacts private, you will be able to view a list of names and basic profile 
information, and then, click links to see the contacts’ profile pages.

Click “Select what others see when you’ve viewed their profile” (highlighted here in blue 
(dark grey in print version)) to change the privacy settings for your browsing on LinkedIn.

135
Case studies
PRIVACY LEVELS AND ACCESS
Users can limit the accessibility of some of their profile information. They can re-
strict who can see their profile photo, limiting it to only connections or only people 
within the user’s network. They can also restrict the visibility of their connections 
(i.e., friends). Those are visible to the user’s other connections by default, but they 
can be limited so only the user himself can view them.
CASE STUDIES
Because LinkedIn is business-oriented, most of the case studies for how it is used in 
investigation deal with hiring and firing decisions.
GETTING HIRED
Heidi Nazarudin, president of bloggerbabes.com, reports how she has used LinkedIn 
in her hiring decisions:
I was looking for a Content Manager and, there were about 6-7 shortlisted can-
didates but one candidate stood out considerably due to the fact that …checking 
out her LinkedIn profile, had about 2000+ connections from the print and digital 
FIGURE 12.8
Choose the bottom option “You will be totally anonymous” to prevent people from seeing 
your information when you browse their profile.

CHAPTER 12  LinkedIn
media industries. Upon asking her about this she told me she once worked as an 
event manager for a media association and those people were contacts she had 
made from past events. Even though she was less experienced than the other can-
didates, due to the fact that she had valuable connections for me, I hired her. My 
hunch proved right and until today, her contacts proved valuable regularly for me 
time and time again.
NOT GETTING HIRED
A poor LinkedIn profile can also prevent someone from getting a job. Michelle 
Campbell of the advertising agency Potratz explained to me that the HR director for 
their company had looked up an applicant on LinkedIn. For an advertising company, 
someone’s ability to present themselves well online speaks directly to their ability to 
sell products. This particular candidate had an extensive list of past jobs on LinkedIn, 
but none of these matched with experience he had discussed with the HR manager. 
The disconnect made her question all the experience the candidate reported, and he 
was not hired.
LEGAL MATTERS
Family lawyers have also reported to me that they use LinkedIn. For them, it serves 
more as background information. In particular, they describe using it to determine 
someone’s employment status (which they may be hiding to reduce alimony or child 
support obligations).
CONCLUSIONS
LinkedIn is a business-oriented professional network. As such, the information there 
is mainly relevant to someone’s work experience and employment information. The 
major consideration for an investigator using LinkedIn is that it is hard to access 
information without having an account and being logged in and that your visits to a 
person’s page are logged and visible to them. You can adjust this, but if you want to 
browse anonymously, it is important to change this setting first.

CHAPTER
137
Google+
INTRODUCTION: BEFORE GOOGLE+
Google­ (pronounced, and sometimes written, as “Google Plus”) is Google's online 
social networking platform. It is similar to Facebook in many ways.
Before we get into the details of Google­, it is interesting to look at Google's 
history of social networking platforms.
ORKUT
One of Google's earliest ventures into social networking was with a platform called 
Orkut. Launched in 2004, it was similar to many social networks at the time, includ-
ing Myspace. It became quite popular, especially in India and Brazil. However, it 
failed to keep up with Facebook in the US market.
GOOGLE BUZZ
To compete in the growing social networking space, Google launched Google Buzz 
in 2010. The launch is almost universally agreed to have been a disaster because 
of major privacy issues. Google automatically created a Google Buzz account for 
­
turned on their accounts, and publicly listed the names of the people each person 
corresponded with most frequently in Gmail. Thus, without any action by a user, 
Google shared all this information with the world. The privacy implications of this 
became clear quickly.
Business Insider lists a few troubling possible scenarios.­ A husband's profile 
shows that he has had a lot of contact with an ex. A boss sees that a competitor is 
a top contact of his employee. What about the case where journalists are emailing 
confidential, anonymous sources? Those sources could be revealed. Physicians and 
therapists who used Gmail to correspond with their patients would have their 
­
One case where this had implications was from a woman who had a serious need 
to keep her information private. She wrote the following about her problems2:
I use my private Gmail account to email my boyfriend and my mother. There's a 
BIG drop-off between them and my other “most frequent” contacts.
13

138
CHAPTER 13  Google+
You know who my third most frequent contact is? My abusive ex-husband.
Which is why it's SO EXCITING, Google, that you AUTOMATICALLY allowed all 
my most frequent contacts access to my Reader, including all the comments I've 
made on Reader items, usually shared with my boyfriend, who I had NO REASON 
to hide my current location or workplace from, and never did.
My other most frequent contacts? Other friends of [boyfriend] Flint's.
Oh, also, people who email my ANONYMOUS blog account, which gets for-
warded to my personal account. They are frequent contacts as well. Most of them, 
they are nice people. Some of them are probably nice but a little unbalanced and 
scary. A minority of them—but the minority that emails me the most, thus becom-
ing FREQUENT—are psychotic men who think I deserve to be raped because  
I keep a blog about how I do not deserve to be raped, and this apparently causes 
the Hulk rage.
Google eventually corrected many of these issues, but in a sense, the damage 
was done. The public outcry at the launch of the site and discussion of major privacy 
flaws led to users having low trust in the site. It was shut down after less than two 
years.
DESCRIPTION OF THE SITE
THE RELEASE OF GOOGLE+
Google+ came next and has been Google's most successful rival to Facebook. It 
focused on the importance of privacy from the start, important both because of 
the history with Buzz and because Facebook was actively criticized for its pri-
vacy issues at the time. Google+ was, in part, promoted as a privacy-respecting 
alternative.
Google+ has roughly 550 million active users, which makes it extremely popular, 
but with less than half of Facebook's usage. Many more people could use Google+, 
since anyone with a Google account—used for Gmail, Search, and even YouTube—
can instantly set up an account on Google+. Indeed, Google is working to make 
Google+ a more engrained part of their other experiences, linking Google+ accounts 
to YouTube, for example.
Aside from its role in other Google products, there are many features of the 
Google+ site itself. Its functionality is similar to Facebook's in many ways.
Posts
Users can post status updates. They can be text-only or they can have pictures, vid-
eos, links, or events created within Google+. Figure 13.1 shows a sample status up-
date being created.

139
Description of the site
Also shown in Figure 13.1 is the “To:” feature of the Google+ status update. This 
is essentially the privacy level for a post; it indicates who can view the post within 
Google+. Users may also share photos and links from external sites through a Google 
“g+” button. Clicking this brings up a post window, like that shown in Figure 13.1, so 
users don't have to worry about saving or copying information to upload it through the 
Google interface.
The current setting shown in Figure 13.1 is for a public post, visible to anyone. 
However, the pull-down menu shows a number of other options. These are based on 
the idea of “circles,” which is part of the core of Google+.
Before getting into the details of circles, it is important to note one major difference 
between Google+ and Facebook. On Facebook, friendships are mutual. If a person 
adds “Bob” as a friend, Bob must approve that friendship to create the relationship. On 
Google+, this is not the case. Google+ uses more of a Twitter model where users follow 
one another. Those relationships do not have to be mutual nor approved. Thus, users 
can follow anyone they like. Those people may follow back but they do not have to.
FIGURE 13.1
Posting a status update on Google+.

140
CHAPTER 13  Google+
Circles
When users follow someone, they add them to a circle. A circle is basically just a 
list of people. Users can create as many circles as they like. Google offers premade 
circles for “Friends,” “Family,” and “Acquaintances,” but a circle with any name can 
be created. When a user follows someone, they can add them to one or more circles. 
Figure 13.2 shows the menu that appears for adding someone to a circle, which in-
cludes the option to create a new circle.
When posting, as shown in Figure 13.1, a user can choose to share his update 
with people in any single circle or from multiple circles. When they share, anyone in 
those circles has permission see the content—even if they are not following the user.
The Google+ home page shows updates from all of a person's circles by de-
fault. Figure 13.3 shows Malcom's home page. Across the top of the page is a menu 
that allows the user to choose different circles. The three default circles—“Friends,” 
“Family,” and “Acquaintances”—have their own tabs, and additional circles are 
shown under “More.”
When a user makes a post, it will show up on the home page, or in the circle 
pages, for anyone who has followed him. If a user creates a post and shares it with 
people who have not followed him (e.g., a celebrity that he follows), the person with 
whom it was shared will not see the post on her own home page but would be able to 
see it if she came to the user's profile page.
Figure 13.4 shows Malcom's profile page. The default view, shown in this figure, 
has all the posts by a user. Notice that “Posts” is highlighted on the menu toward the 
top of the page. This view also includes the people in the user's circles.
The menu toward the top of the page includes several other views for the user. 
Photos, YouTube, and Reviews show specific types of content as the name indicates. 
Note that YouTube and Reviews are actually pulling content from these other Google 
services that the user would have accessed with his Google account.

142
CHAPTER 13  Google+
The About section contains profile information, similar to what you would find 
in the About section for a user on Facebook. Figure 13.5 shows Malcom's About sec-
tion. This includes another list of people in Malcom's circles as well as demographic 
and personal information.
It is difficult to see where to draw the line on what counts as a Google+ 
feature versus what counts as a different Google service. For example, Google 
advertises Hangouts (their group video chat service) as part of Google+, even 
though it can be used otherwise. For the purposes of this book and in the interest 
of investigation, we have limited our view to the core social networking features.

information.

Finding people
USER DEMOGRAPHICS
Google+ is sometimes touted as the world's largest social network, with 1.5 billion 
users, though this is misleading. This counts everyone who has a Google account as 
a user, though the majority of those people are not actively using Google+ in any 
real way. Google has pushed adoption of Google+. For example, anyone who wants 
to comment on a YouTube video (YouTube is owned by Google) needs to have a 
Google+ account. Thus, many people may technically have Google+ accounts and 
use them to comment on YouTube, but they may otherwise ignore the site entirely.
Because Google account holders are such a large percentage of the population, 
it is hard to gauge exactly what demographics are unique to Google+. However, the 
consensus of online demographic studies is that Google+ trends dramatically male, 
with men comprising over ⅔ of active users on the site.3 Users also tend to be more 
technically oriented and younger than their Facebook counterparts.4
FINDING PEOPLE
Google+ has a number of ways to search for people. The most straightforward is to 
type a name into the search box at the top of every page. You can see examples of 
this in Figures 13.3–13.5, above. All people with matching names will be returned 
as results of the search.
Their “Find People” interface5 offers a number of search options. Figure 13.6 
shows the main page for finding people. In the center is a list of options to connect 
email accounts to search for contacts on Google+. Beneath that, Google+ has looked 
at the employer Malcom listed on his account—the International Monetary Fund—
and found a list of other Google+ users who have also listed it. On the left, there is a 
menu that allows Malcom to see others who have listed his employer or alma mater 
(Haverford College). Clicking on those links will bring up a list of people that share 
the trait.
Beneath that are options to search for coworkers or classmates. Figure 13.7 shows 
the window that pops up when searching for a coworker (the classmate interface is 
basically the same). The user can type in an organization's name, and Google will 
help complete the name to help find the right match. Note that beneath that is a box 
that is checked that adds this place of business to the user's profile as somewhere 
they worked. That box needs to be unchecked in order to search any organization 
without adding it to the profile. The results of this search will be anyone who has 
the organization listed as a place they worked. The same logic applies to searches 
for classmates; people who have listed a school in their profile will appear in those 
search results.
Searching through social connections is also a viable option on Google+. If you 
cannot find a target, but you know who his or her associates are, you might be able to

CHAPTER 13  Google+

145
Obtaining data
find the target through them. Figure 13.8 shows the profile page for a user. Even though 
Malcom is not friends with the user, we can see two social sections: “In her circles,” 
which lists people the user follows, and “Have her in circles,” which lists people who 
follow this user. Next to each section is a list of the number of people. Clicking that num-
ber will bring up a browsable list of associates that you can look through to find a target.
At the time of writing, Google+ does not support search directly for a person's 
email account. However, if you link your email account (as shown in Figure 13.6) 
and you have the target in your contact list, you may be able to locate them that way.
OBTAINING DATA
Once you have located a target on Google+, there are a few types of information you 
can obtain about him. First, on his Google+ page, there is an “About” link under his 
profile picture at the top of the page. That will take you to his profile, which includes 
information like where the person works, where they went to school, descriptive 
personal text, and demographics like gender, age, and relationship status. Figure 13.9 
shows Malcom's profile page.
FIGURE 13.8
When looking at a user's profile, you can see people they follow (“In her circles”) and 
people that follow the user (“Have her in circles”). This can aid a social search for a target.

146
CHAPTER 13  Google+
Figure 13.9 also shows links to other sections of a user's page under his profile 
photo and next to the “About” link. These include pages with posts and photos, along 
with links to videos the person posted on YouTube and reviews he has written within 
Google. These all can be valuable sources of information about what a user is doing. 
Each post has an associated date and time. Figure 13.4 shows examples of dates and 
times shown next to a post.
PRIVACY LEVELS AND ACCESS
As mentioned above, posts, including pictures and links, are shared according to 
“circles” of people the user has set up. Similarly, profile information can be shared 
with different groups of people. Figure 13.10 shows the window the user sees when 
editing his profile. For each box, he can choose a privacy level. The menu for the 
“Occupation” section is shown open. The user can share with different levels of 
people, including “Your Circles” (essentially, everyone the user follows), and a cus-
tom level. This latter option lets the user choose specific circles or even specific indi-
viduals who can see the information. These same settings are available for all profile 
information, including lists of circles. Thus, it is possible you will be able to see 
FIGURE 13.9
Malcom's Google+ profile.

147
Case studies
profile information and posts for a target if you can find him on Google+, but it is not 
assured since privacy levels could prevent you from accessing this data. Of course, 
if the user adds you to one of his or her circles, you are more likely to gain access.
CASE STUDIES
AN UNWANTED INVITATION
A recent and high profile story of someone getting himself into trouble with Google+ 
is that of a man who was arrested for an automatic invitation sent to his ex-girlfriend.
When users sign up for Google+, Google prompts them to invite people to be 
their friends or to join. That can include inviting all of the user's contacts through a 
variety of email services. Google also invites people in ways users may not under-
stand. Fast Company explains:
Some users have even complained that Google is mining Gmail contacts to send 
out Google+ notifications. For example, when users register for Gmail, they're 
automatically welcomed to Google+, too. And by default, when someone joins 
Google+ and that person is in your Gmail contacts, Google will automatically 
send you a notification, along with an invitation suggesting that you “add him [or 
her] to your circles to stay connected.” The same occurs if someone adds you to a 
Google+ circle. (Users have the option of adjusting these settings.)6
In this case, it is unclear what the arrested man did to send the invitation. What is 
clear is that his ex-girlfriend had a restraining order against him. When she received 
FIGURE 13.10
The privacy options for profile sections are shown. Users can control who is able to view 
each piece of profile data.

148
CHAPTER 13  Google+
the Google+ invitation, she took it to the police who arrested him a couple hours later 
for violating the restraining order.
Initially, the man protested that he had no idea how the invitation was sent. For 
an average user, that would make sense. However, in his profile, he describes himself 
as an “IT Pro/Software Dev[eloper]”—someone who should understand when they 
take an action that would send a social media invitation. The man later admitted that 
the prosecution would have been able to prove that he did indeed send the invitation.7
STEINMETZ
Google+ was used as part of another investigation, when scientist Peter Steinmetz 
was arrested for bringing a riffle into Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.8 
Police and journalists turned to his social media accounts, including Google+, to un-
derstand his motivations. On his account, he had posted links and comments indicat-
ing he was a gun-rights advocate. Figure 13.11 shows an example of one such post.
At the time of writing, his case is still in progress.

Notes
CONCLUSIONS
Google+ is a comprehensive social networking website with many features similar to 
Facebook. Users can post updates, maintain profiles, and connect with friends. The 
social relationships on Google+ are more like those on Twitter. Users do not need to 
have mutual friendships and do not need to approve relationships created by other 
people.
Through profile information and posts, it is possible to gain a lot of insights into 
a target. And many people are using Google+, either explicitly for its social network-
ing features or because they have accounts established through their use of other 
Google services.

Tumblr
DESCRIPTION OF THE SITE
Tumblr is a microblogging website. Users can post photos, videos, and text blog 
entries. There is no character limit (as on Twitter), but the site is organized and pre-
­
POSTING
The top of the Tumblr page has options for users to create posts. There are seven post 
types (see ­
 
): Text, Photo, Quote (a stylized text post), Link, Chat (another 
stylized type of text), Audio, and Video.
Selecting any post type brings up a simple interface for either entering text or 
uploading a file. Figure 14.2 shows the interface for creating a text post.
Posts are published to a Tumblr blog created by the user. Figure 14.3 shows part 
of Malcom's Tumblr blog.
HASHTAGS
Hashtags are used very frequently within Tumblr. ­
 
 shows a couple on the 
photo Malcom has posted. Since photos are a very common type of media to share 
on Tumblr, hashtags improve the searchability of content.
SHARING
In addition to creating their own content, users have the option to share posts by others 
through ­
. At the bottom of each post is a double arrow icon. (See Figure 14.3, 
in the lower right corner of Malcom's first photo post.) Clicking that brings up a window 
where users can add comments and repost the original item to their own blogs. These 
­
Users can also like posts by clicking the small heart next to the reblog post.
FOLLOWING
Users can also follow others. When they do, posts from other users appear on their dash-
board. Figure 14.4 shows Malcom's dashboard. It includes his most recent posts along 
with those from other people. The dashboard is visible only to the user who controls it.

Tumblr is smaller than some of the sites we have covered in this book. Estimates 
suggest it has 30-50 million active users. But Tumblr's parent company, Yahoo!, 
claimed they receive 300 million unique visitors each month. This difference can be 
accounted for by people who visit the site to look at content without having accounts.
Tumblr has a very young audience, with nearly half its members aged between 
16 and 24. It also has a higher population of Hispanic users than might be expected. 
They make up roughly 20% of Tumblr users—twice the representation of Hispanic 
users online. The male-female split is pretty even, with women accounting for a few 
percentage points more of the population than men.

Finding people
FINDING PEOPLE
Tumblr has a search option, but it's designed mainly to find content, not individual 
users. For example, consider a search for “Robert Smith” as a common example 
name. Tumblr's search results are shown in Figure 14.5. The results consist of blogs 
that mention Robert Smith in the title (generally about the lead singer for The Cure).
VIA AUTOCOMPLETE
The autocompleted suggestions under the search bar (in the upper right) show blogs 
that have similar names to the search term. The results on the page include blogs that 
mention the name, followed by posts that mention it. You may be able to find a user 
this way.

Obtaining data
VIA KNOWN USERNAMES
If you know a common username used by the target, another option is to directly test 
it as a Tumblr blog name. Simply go to http://«username».tumblr.com, where 
«username» is replaced with the target's username.
VIA “FOLLOWING” LISTS
Most people do not share a list of people they follow on their blogs. However, some 
users choose to add this. It generally appears as a grid of icons, each representing 
the main picture of the blog being followed. Figure 14.6 shows an example (with the 
icons blurred to protect users' privacy).
When this is available, you may be able to perform a social search for a target. If 
you can find an associate of the target and if that associate has a list of people he or 
she follows, searching that list may turn up the target's account.
OBTAINING DATA
It is possible to browse Tumblr without having an account. After you have found a 
target, the main source of data you will find about him is in the posts he has made 
on his blog.
FIGURE 14.6
An example of a grid of icons that show who a user is following.

156
CHAPTER 14  Tumblr
If you want a quick overview of those posts, particularly if you are looking at a lot 
of photos, you can append “/archive” to the end of the address for his page. For ex-
ample, for Malcom's archive, you can go to http://malcomcsmith.tumblr.com/archive.
PRIVACY LEVELS AND ACCESS
Tumblr posts are all visible to the public, even if the viewer does not have a Tumblr 
account. But there's one exception: users can create private Tumblr blogs. Private 
blogs are password-protected. So, unless you know a password commonly used by a 
target, it will not be possible to access private blogs.
CASE STUDIES
Tumblr has been a source in a number of investigations.
JOANIE FAIRCLOTH
In 2013, a woman used her Tumblr account to accuse singer Conor Oberst of raping 
her nearly a decade earlier. Her original post read in part:
I became a huge fan of Conor's music, and for my 16th birthday, Bright Eyes was 
playing a local show and my old English teacher (Conor's brother) arranged for 
me to go and meet Conor after the show as a birthday present of sorts. Conor defi-
nitely took advantage of my teenage crush on him. At first, I was flattered when 
he was playing with my hair and had his hand on my leg. It was like my dream 
come true at that point. But then he clearly wanted to go further and I made it 
very clear and told him I was a virgin and wasn't prepared to change that right 
then but he didn't stop.1
The singer denied the allegations and sued the poster, Joanie Faircloth, for libel.
After her identity was revealed and she was sued, she retracted her post, saying:
The statements I made and repeated online and elsewhere over the past six months 
accusing Conor Oberst of raping me are 100% false. I publicly retract my state-
ments about Conor Oberst and sincerely apologize to him, his family, and his fans 
for writing such awful things about him.2
SHOPLIFTING COMMUNITY
On Tumblr, some people even create problems for themselves with the truth. 
A ­community of users formed on Tumblr around shoplifting. Posters would blog 
photos of the things they had shoplifted, including tallies of the value. They also 
posted lists of tips and tricks for successfully shoplifting.3

157
Notes
After one Tumblr user discovered the group, their posts were commented on and 
reblogged extensively. There are no reports of anyone being arrested as a result of 
these posts, but the public outing and shaming of this group of users illustrates what 
can be discovered when people think their posts are quiet and anonymous.
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY
As one might suspect on a photo-heavy site like Tumblr, pornography is popular. 
Unfortunately, cases of child pornography are being shared as well. In the summer 
of 2014, a Baton Rouge man was arrested for posting two pornographic images of 
children to his Tumblr blog, including one photo of a boy who was only 5-years-old.4 
A later search found additional images on his hard drive at home. He was subse-
quently arrested and charged with distribution of child pornography.
THREATS OF VIOLENCE
Another user who got himself arrested and jailed because of Tumblr posts is Caleb 
Jamaal Clemmons. The 20-year-old student created a Tumblr post that read: “Hello, 
my name is irenigg and i plan on shooting up georgia southern [university]. Pass 
this around to see the affect it has to see if i get arrested.5” Only hours later, he was 
arrested and charged with making terrorist threats. The man claimed his posts were 
merely a joke, but a judge disagreed. Not only was he sentenced to 6 months in jail 
and 5 years of probation, but also he was banned from four Georgia counties and 
banned from using any social media.
CONCLUSIONS
Tumblr is a microblogging platform where users share text, photos, and videos. It 
has a primarily young audience, with half their users under 25-years-old. Users can 
follow one another, reblog posts, and favorite each other's posts. There is basically 
no profile information on Tumblr, so the main source of information about a target 
comes from the content of his or her posts. These, however, can be quite revealing, 
so Tumblr is a worthwhile source to use if a target has an account.

Instagram
CASE STUDY PARAGON: SALADWORKS
Earlier, we met Mitch Donaberger, social media manager for Saladworks. Instagram 
is a platform where Mr. Donaberger finds a lot of information. This is especially true 
because Saladworks employees are in the core demographic for Instagram and use 
­
Figure 15.1 is but one example of how Mr. Donaberger used Instagram to inves­
tigate the employee who posted the photo.
The employee tweeted that she had worn flip-flops into the Saladworks kitchen: 
a violation of company policy and health safety laws. To comply, she put bags over 
the flip-flops, took a photo, and posted it to Instagram. Although she never revealed 
her name or location on Instagram, Mr. Donaberger was able to cross-reference it 
against her other social media accounts, identify her name and general location, 
and ultimately the store she worked in. Within a day, she was fired for damaging the 
brand through her post.
INSTAGRAM OVERVIEW
At its core, Instagram is just a photo-sharing application. Users take photos with their 
mobile devices, possibly apply some artistic filters to the photos, and then upload them.
POSTING PHOTOS
­
 
 shows two photos (left) and their Instagram-ed counterparts (right). Note 
that the Instagram photos are always square, which crops the original images; but the 
photos on the right have been modified further by filters. Filters can change colors, 
contrast, focus, add borders, or any number of other visual features.
When a user posts a photo to Instagram, they can add a caption and any number of 
hashtags. Other users can Like and Comment on the photo. One of the above photos 
­

Instagram photos can also attach location information. In Figure  15.3, under 
­
“Georgetown University.”
Instagram tends to be a real-time sharing platform. People take photos during the 
course of their daily activities and post them immediately, rather than sharing them

later. This makes Instagram a relatively reliable source of information about what a 
person was doing at a specific time.
INSTAGRAM RELATIONSHIPS
Relationships on Instagram are similar to those on Twitter. Users can follow people 
who they think are interesting, but the relationship does not need to be approved or 
reciprocal. One exception is that people with private accounts (discussed below, un-
der “Privacy Levels and Access”) have to approve followers since that status grants 
them access to the user's posts.
INSTAGRAM DEMOGRAPHICS
Instagram is popular among a younger demographic. Over 35% of people aged  
18-29 years use Instagram. The entire user population skews young; Instagram has 
about 150 million users, and over 90% of them are under 35.
Users also tend to be extremely engaged with the platform, with 70% of users 
accessing it daily. This is just slightly lower than the percentage of people who check 
their Facebook accounts everyday and, indeed, for younger users, Instagram is often 
the primary social media platform they interact with.
Women dominate Instagram, accounting for over ⅔ of users.
FIGURE 15.3
Example user Malcom's Instagram post.

162
CHAPTER 15  Instagram
FINDING PEOPLE
One of the most important aspects of Instagram is that its primary use is via mobile 
devices. There is a web interface (seen in Figure 15.3), which displays photos and 
provides some limited functionality; but most features are exclusive to the app on a 
mobile device.
Searching for people is one feature that's not available on the Instagram website. 
There are a few other options to search for a person.
BY THE MOBILE APP
First, acquire the smartphone app on either an iPhone or Android device. In order to 
search, you need to have an account. (Your searches and browsing behavior are not 
shown to anyone.)
Figure 15.4 shows the Instagram interface on an iPhone. At the bottom of the 
window is a set of icons. The second icon, a compass rose, takes you to the “Explore” 
screen. It shows thumbnails of photos and includes a search feature at the top.
Tap the search box at the top. From here, you can enter a person's name or user-
name to find them. In Figure 15.5, we searched for “Malcom,” and our example user 
Malcom Conroy-Smith appears in the search results.
BY SEARCH SERVICES
If you do not want to use the Instagram app, there are a number of websites that 
allow you to search. A web search for “search Instagram” yields a list of Instagram-
searching services, all of which work similarly with app search described above.
These sites also have the convenience of not requiring you to create an Instagram 
account to use them. One excellent website in this category is http://pinsta.me.
BY USERNAME
If you think you know someone's username—for example, if you know their Twitter 
handle and are testing if their Instagram handle is the same—you can simply enter 
the web address http://.instagram.com/«USERNAME», where «USERNAME» is re-
placed with the username you are search for. Thus, our example user Malcom can be 
found at http://instagram.com/malcomcsmith.
BY SOCIAL CONNECTIONS
Another method for finding someone is to search through their social connections.
One way to do this is to find a known associate of the target (using the search 
techniques described above). On Instagram, the total numbers that a user is follow-
ing and those who are following the user are public—but unlike many other sites, the 
actual list of people isn't available.

163
Finding people
However, you can select a photo and see the people who have liked or com-
mented on the photo. Figure 15.6 shows an example from the author's Instagram 
page. Our example user Malcom has liked the image, and another user, “rescueacls,” 
has both liked it and commented.
In Figure 15.6, note that the usernames are links. Click on a username to go to 
his or her Instagram page. Thus, even without a username or a successful search, you 
may be able to find someone by investigating interactions on their friends' photos.
The Instagram mobile app does let you browse a person's followers and the 
people they follow. Figure 15.7 shows the author's Instagram account. In the upper 
FIGURE 15.4
The Explore screen in the Instagram app (iPhone). To access it, tap the compass rose icon 
(second from the left, at the bottom of the screen). Note the search box at the top of the 
page.

164
CHAPTER 15  Instagram
right above the “Following” button are three numbers indicating posts, followers, 
and people the user is following. Tapping on one of those numbers will take you to a 
list of the corresponding information. When looking at followers, for example, you 
can then tap on one of the follower names to see their account information.
On the web, there are third-party services that will also let you view this informa-
tion. For example, on pinsta.me, you can enter an Instagram username or search by 
name. When you find a person, you can browse photos, followers, and people fol-
lowed in a similar way.
Figure 15.8 shows a search result from a search on pinsta.me. Note the box on 
the left shows profile information for the user hopper_dog. Clicking on the numbers 
above “Follower” or “Following” will display a list of users that can, in turn, be 
clicked to view their profile.

CHAPTER 15  Instagram
OBTAINING DATA
USER PROFILES
Once you have located a target, the username will be a point of access. As men-
tioned above, going to http://.instagram.com/«USERNAME», where «USERNAME» is 
replaced with the target's actual username, will take you to the target's page.
On a user's profile page, you can see some basic biographical information about 
them. Figure 15.9 shows example user Malcom's page. There is a short description of 
himself next to his profile photo (Living in DC with my dog Barley). Users can also 
include a link to their website. In this case, Malcom has linked to his Facebook page.
The real information about a target is in photos and captions. Instagram photos 
tend to depict moments from everyday life as they happen, so they can say a lot about 
where a person spends time, what they like to eat, who they go out with, and how 
they like to present themselves.
Each photo has an associated time, although it's not as precise as on some ­social 
media sites. In Figure 15.3, the time of posting is “1 hour ago.” In Figure 15.6, it is 
“17 months ago.” In Figure 15.7, both photos have a time of “3 hours ago.” This is as 
precise as time gets for Instagram posts. Thus, while photos are organized in reverse 
chronological order on a user's page, it's not always possible to have an accurate

information for this user, including clickable numbers for lists of followers and people followed.

167
Obtaining data
­estimate of the exact time the photo was taken, especially for older pictures. The 
same is true for comments on photos, which follow the same time scheme.
Hashtags
Hashtags are common on Instagram. As with Twitter and other sites, hashtags can 
be clicked on to view other images with the same hashtag. Since Instagram photos 
are generally public—and the community usually views them as publicly shared im-
ages (rather than, say, communications with their friends)—hashtags are a way for 
someone's images to reach a greater audience than their own followers. It is not 
uncommon to have a dozen or more hashtags on an image. This will not always tell 
you a lot about the person posting the image, but it will tell you which communities 
of people on Instagram that they like to interact with.
Social Connections
Social connections can also reveal a lot of information about someone's community, 
though it is important to remember that relationships are not necessarily reciprocal 
on Instagram. Just because someone follows another person does not mean they have

The default, zoomed out map view (left) shows that (2) pictures are geotagged near the 
same location. Zooming in (right) shows the photos on a map in their geotagged locations.

CHAPTER 15  Instagram
any kind of relationship. As described above, third-party websites like pinsta.me, 
or the mobile Instagram app, allow you to view lists of a target's followers and the 
people he or she follows.
LOCATION DATA
Instagram also has a number of location features. As described above, users can add 
a location to their posts. Figure 15.3 shows an example of this. Those geotagged 
photos then appear on a map for the user. Figure 15.7 shows the mobile app view of 
a user's profile page. Note the row of icons above the photos. The third from the left 
is a location pin icon. Clicking this takes you to a map with the user's photos on it. 
Figure 15.9 shows the default view of the map for Malcom, zoomed out. Zooming in 
pinpoints photos at their tagged location.
Instagram does not tag with GPS coordinates, but users can enter general loca-
tions (e.g., Washington, DC) or specific ones, like names of restaurants or businesses.
Clicking on the location for a given photo will take you to a page showing other 
photos tagged with that same location. This can be useful in identifying other people 
who have posted from the same place.
PRIVACY LEVELS AND ACCESS
Privacy on Instagram is simple and straightforward. By default, all of a person's pho-
tos are shared with the public. Even people who do not have an Instagram account 
can view them. Similarly, people's profiles are public.
Users have the option to make their Instagram account private. In that case, their 
photos and information is visible only to a list of approved followers. At the time 
of writing, Instagram has not released public numbers about what percentage of ac-
counts are private, but rough estimates from independent sources put it at 3-5%.
People can also send direct messages to one another on Instagram. These mes-
sages are always private and are only accessible by the sender and recipient.
CASE STUDIES
CIVIL CASES
Family Law
Family law, as we are seeing in many chapters, is a place where information from 
social media is frequently used to investigate parties. Lisa Helfend Meyer, a Los 
Angeles-based family law firm Meyer, Olson, Lowy & Meyers, shared a story of how 
pictures from Instagram were used in one of her cases.
She represented the father in a case where the mother had a history of substance 
abuse. The mother claimed to be off drugs and was testing negative for them. Indeed, 
the mother portrayed herself in court as someone who stayed home every night and 
led a relatively simple, kid-centric life.

169
Case studies
However, the mother also had an Instagram account where she posted frequently.
She shared pictures there of herself partying with people who were using drugs 
and alcohol. After surveying her Instagram friends, attorneys also discovered that 
she was friends with someone who worked the facility administering her drug tests.
One technique people use to confuse drug tests is to drink a lot of water. This 
dilutes urine and can lead to inconclusive tests. In this case, when the mother took a 
drug test that showed diluted urine, attorneys were able to use her Instagram feed to 
show that she had recently been out partying with friends—including the one who 
administered the drug test. They constructed a timeline and presented it to the judge 
to consider for his custody decision.
Firing
Haley Cousins of Naviga Business Services, a recruitment agency, told me the story 
of “Jim,” whom she had helped get hired for a job. After starting at his new position, 
Jim called in sick on a Monday. Later that day, someone in Jim's company who was 
following his Instagram feed found a picture Jim had just posted, with the caption 
“Great day at the beach with friends!” Later that day, Jim posted photos that showed 
him with a drink and playing volleyball with friends.
Jim's boss quickly became aware of the situation. When Jim arrived at work the 
next day, his boss confronted him with the Instagram photos. Jim was fired shortly 
thereafter.
Hiring
Instagram does not always lead to doom and gloom, however. David Bitton of 
PayPanther.com says that his company seeks out nontraditional candidates for their 
work and almost exclusively hires based on social media presence.
David said his company found a candidate because of this online following, and 
David explicitly cited his 2500 Instagram photos, as well as his audience of over 
1000 followers. This kind of attention to Instagram and other platforms showed that 
the candidate was influential and that he knew how to productively interact with 
people online.
Nine months later, David reports their Instagram-hire is the best employee in the 
office. Finding new candidates through social media is now the company's standard 
practice.
CRIMINAL CASES
Ephebophile
In May 2014, a 29-year-old man who played Captain America (and, for the pur-
poses of this anecdote, that's what we'll call him) at Universal Studios in Orlando 
was ­arrested for sending sexually explicit photos to a 16-year-old girl he met at the 
theme park.
When the girl visited the park, she took a photo with Captain America and posted 
it to her Instagram account. Captain America found the photo and commented. That 
started a friendly relationship between the two, in which Captain America ­eventually 

170
CHAPTER 15  Instagram
escalated, sending pictures of himself naked, sometimes masturbating, and with sex-
ually explicit text.
An investigation on Instagram established a pattern of behavior. Captain America 
had posted creepy comments on other girls' photos with him, including “Definitely 
my fav of the day!!” and “You're a sweetie.”1
Fortunately, Captain America has been forced to retire his shield and uniform; 
after his arrest, he was fired from his position in Universal Studios.
Smash and Grab Robbery
In a slightly less scandalous story of Instagram arrest, police were able to identify a 
man who robbed a store, based on his Instagram connection with the business.2 In 
April 2014, a man robbed an e-cigarette store in Boca Raton, Florida. He threw a 
brick through a window and made off with a backpack full of merchandise.
While reviewing the surveillance footage, the store's staff recognized the burglar 
as a frequent customer. Police went through the shop's Instagram account where they 
found photos of the man, including a picture of his driver's license.3 He was later 
arrested in connection with this robbery—and the robbery of a gas station down the 
street.
This case is particularly interesting as an investigation example, because it shows 
how the followers of an account can be searched to reveal information.
CONCLUSIONS
Instagram is an extremely popular photo-based social media site, used primarily by a 
younger audience. The photos people post are almost always publicly available. Since 
most photos are taken, filtered, and posted all at once from mobile devices, someone's 
Instagram feed provides a unique view into people's daily activities. Geotagging on 
images can add an additional layer of insight to the photos themselves.

CASE STUDY PARAGON: ELLIOT RODGER
On May 23, 2014, 22-year-old Elliot Rodger­
of Isla Vista, California.1
After stabbing his three roommates to death, he left in his BMW. He stopped at 
­
three young women who were outside, killing two of them.
He then continued driving, shooting at people on the sidewalk from his car win-
dow, running down cyclists, and eventually shooting at sheriff's deputies. When the 
spree finally ended, Rodger was dead from a gunshot wound to the head, six victims 
were dead, and twelve others were injured.
In the aftermath of the shooting, Rodger's 141-page manifesto, “My Twisted 
World,” was made public, in which he ranted about his anger at the world. However, 
the most accessed of Rodger's public material was a series of YouTube videos (still 
available online at the time of writing: https://www.youtube.com/ElliotRodger). Their 
­
“Life is so unfair because girls dont want me,” and “Why do girls hate me so much?”
In his final video, “Retribution,” Rodger detailed his plan for the massacre2
Well, this is my last video. It has all had to come to this. Tomorrow is the day of 
retribution, the day in which I will have my revenge against humanity, against all 
of you. For the last 8 years of my life, ever since I hit puberty, I've been forced to 
­
girls have never been attracted to me. Girls gave their affection and sex and love 
to other men but never to me.
He went on to detail his hatred of women for rejecting him, of his peers with 
whom he could not connect socially, and of humanity. He concluded with a detailed 
description of his plans:
­
(laughs) Yes. After I've annihilated every single girl in the sorority house, I will 
take to the streets of Isla Vista and slay every single person I see there. All those 
popular kids who live such lives of hedonistic pleasures while I've had to rot in 
loneliness for all these years. Well now, I will be a god compared to you. You will 
all be animals. You are animals and I will slaughter you like animals. And I will 
16

CHAPTER 16  YouTube
be a god. Exacting my retribution on all those who deserve it. You do deserve it. 
Just for the crime of living a better life than me. All you popular kids, you've never 
accepted me, and now, you will all pay for it. And girls, all I ever wanted was to 
love you and to be loved by you. I've wanted a girlfriend, I've wanted sex, I've 
wanted love, affection, adoration. You think I'm unworthy of it. That's a crime that 
can never be forgiven.
Police knew about these videos in the weeks leading up to the shootings but 
determined that Rodger was not a threat to himself or others. The police reportedly 
saw his final video where he detailed his plans for the killings about an hour after 
they took place.3
While the YouTube videos were not enough to stop Rodger's massacre, they 
­provided deep insights into the deranged thought process of an angry young man. 
They were used in investigations of Rodger before the killings and to investigate and 
better understand his motives afterward. The tragedy of this incident puts a spotlight 
on how much can be learned about a person from their YouTube content (Figure 16.1).
YOUTUBE OVERVIEW
YouTube is a video-sharing website. It's one of the most popular sites on the web, 
with over one billion unique visitors each month.
People can upload videos from their computers or mobile devices. They can then 
be viewed by anyone online or by a restricted group depending on the privacy set-
tings. Viewers can comment on videos and rate them.
POPULARITY
The most popular videos are wildly popular. The most viewed video of all time is the

Youtube overview
(or discredit), YouTube is also responsible for Justin Bieber's music career. His ama-
teur videos were accidentally discovered in 2007 when he was just 13.
Video sharing is dramatically increasing in popularity. This can be largely at-
tributed to the ease with which smartphones can be used to capture, edit, and upload 
videos. And while people can easily email a few photos to their friends, video files 
are often too large for emailing. Thus, sites like YouTube become an obvious plat-
form for sharing videos with friends.
VIDEO PAGES
Figure 16.2 shows a typical page for a video on YouTube. The video is shown at the top. 
Immediately beneath the video are the number of views (to the right) and the title and

name of the person who posted it (to the left). Beneath that is a list of options to share 
the video on a variety of platforms, and finally, beneath that is a space for comments.
Clicking on the name of the poster (in this case, “Malcom Conroy-Smith”) will 
take you to a profile page for that user. This is sometimes called the user's “channel.”
USER PAGES
Figure 16.3 shows Malcom's YouTube home page. It has a profile picture and back-
ground image at the top, beneath which are tabs with different sections of his profile 
information. The home page has all of the user's recent activity, including uploaded 
videos. A more organized and complete list of the videos appears in the “Videos” 
tab. The “Discussion” section allows people to make comments on the user's chan-
nel. Finally, the “About” section has a profile written by the poster. These tend to be 
short blocks of text.
Users do form social connections on YouTube. They can subscribe to one another, 
which means one person wants to see the videos posted by the person to subscribe 
to. However, these subscribers are kept private, so they aren't useful for investigation.
YouTube is owned by Google but operates relatively independently. Users' accounts 
on YouTube can be linked to other Google accounts—such as Gmail and the Google+ 
social network, discussed in another chapter—but they can also remain separate.
YOUTUBE DEMOGRAPHICS
There are two major demographics on YouTube: people who watch videos and peo-
ple who post them.
FIGURE 16.3
Malcom's home page on YouTube.

175
Finding people
Statistics about viewers are relatively easy to come by—and they are impressive. 
Over 1 billion unique people visit YouTube each month. However, not all these peo-
ple are sharing videos. Pew reports that 27% of adults have uploaded a video online. 
The percentage is much higher for younger users (ages 18-29): 41%.4
While YouTube is not the only place these people could have uploaded videos, it 
is the dominant site for sharing videos.
FINDING PEOPLE
BY SEARCH
To find someone on YouTube, you can use the search function at the top of the page. 
You can search for a person here by their name or their username. If the target has 
an account with that name, they are likely to appear in the results. The search box is 
shown in Figure 16.4.
You may also know, or have a good guess about, the target's username. This may 
be the first part of their email address (before the “@” symbol) or a username or 
screen name they use on other sites.
If that doesn't work, you can actually try going directly to the user's YouTube 
page. Simply append the screen name to https://www.youtube.com. For example, 
Malcom's username is “malcomcsmith,” so his YouTube page is https://www.you-
tube.com/malcomcsmith.
BY ADVANCED SEARCH
If you want to search for someone by name, but can't find them in the YouTube re-
sults, you can use the advanced Google technique (discussed earlier in the book). Put 
the target's name in quotes and restrict the search to the youtube.com domain. For ex-
ample, searching for our target Malcom would use the query “malcom conroy-smith” 
site:youtube.com. If you leave the quotes off the name, you'll get more search results, 
but they may be less relevant. For example, in this case, you might find people named 
Conroy Smith, without the “Malcom.”
BY KNOWN ASSOCIATES
If the target doesn't post videos, you may still be able to find videos of them. You 
can follow the same search advice to see if any of the target's known associates have 
accounts and then scan the associates' videos to see if the target appears in them.
FIGURE 16.4
The search box at the top of the page with Malcom's name entered as the search term.

176
CHAPTER 16  YouTube
Similarly, searching for the target's name may not reveal videos posted by the 
target, but there may be videos of the target. If the target's name is included in the 
caption, the video will appear in the search results.
OBTAINING DATA
YouTube is somewhat unique among the social media sites discussed in this book, 
since the videos are the main source of content. When you find someone on YouTube, 
you have access to the most important information–his videos.
PRIVACY LEVELS AND ACCESS
Privacy is relatively simple on YouTube.
YouTube users have the option to make their posts public, which is the default 
and the most common setting; private, which restricts their visibility to invited users 
only; or unlisted, where anyone who has a link to the video can view it but the video 
does not appear in the search results or on a user's YouTube page.
Most videos are posted publicly. It is not a violation to watch unlisted videos if 
you somehow obtain a link to them. However, private videos will be difficult to ac-
cess unless the video owner explicitly chooses you or invites you to watch.
CASE STUDIES
POLITICS
YouTube provides a place for people to share videos of people that the public might 
want investigated, especially in politics. One of the most high-profile revelations 
from YouTube came not from a politician's own channel, but from a video someone 
posted of him.
In the 2012 US presidential election, the Mother Jones magazine posted secretly 
recorded video footage of Republican candidate Mitt Romney speaking at a $50,000 
per place fund-raiser. (Those two videos are still available on YouTube.5) In them, 
Romney is captured making controversial remarks. These videos came to be known 
as the “47%” because of the following quotes:
There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. 
All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon gov-
ernment, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a 
responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to 
food, to housing, to you name it. That that's an entitlement. And the government 
should give it to them … And so my job is not to worry about those people—I'll 
never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for 
their lives.

177
Conclusions
There was a strong response to the videos from both sides. Within the Republican 
party, the campaign was called “incompetent”6,7 and “stupid and arrogant”.8 
Obviously, opponents on the other side seized on the remarks as well. The political 
blog FiveThirtyEight showed Romney's poll ratings decline after the video aired,9 
though there is some question about the role the video played.
Regardless of its quantifiable impact, the incident showed how YouTube videos 
could reveal information about politicians that could shape the national dialogue.
CRIME AND MISBEHAVIOR
For a variety of reasons, many people enjoy posting videos of their bad behavior on 
YouTube. There are quite a few case studies of people being arrested for crimes or 
punished for bad behavior as a result of their YouTube videos that depict it.
In May 2014, Michael Keith Maddox of Piedmont, Alabama, was arrested for 
reckless endangerment as a direct result of the videos he uploaded to his YouTube 
channel.10 The videos were mostly filmed from his dashboard and showed him rant-
ing about cyclists, revving his engine, and speeding past them. In some instances 
where the cyclists appeared frightened as Maddox passed them, he laughed mani-
cally. He also makes passive threats in some videos, yelling, “Ride your little bicycle, 
you piece of crap! I'm going to hurt one of them one of these days. I can't help it.” 
Maddox did issue an apology on Facebook for his “stupid” videos, but this did not 
prevent his arrest. His bond was set at $3000.
Another bad driving incident posted to YouTube led to an arrest. Derek Kellett 
was charged with reckless driving after he uploaded a video of himself running from 
the police on his motorcycle. The video, titled “Yamaha R6 Runs From Cops- Full 
High Speed Chase!!,” shows him speeding, running red lights, weaving across lanes, 
and coming close to several cars, narrowly avoiding collisions. He was charged with 
five counts of reckless driving and released on a $2225 bond.11
Two teen girls from Ohio were arrested after their video of a fight, in which one 
threw a shovel at the other, hitting her in the head and knocking her to the ground, 
which was posted on YouTube.12 Both were charged with disorderly conduct.
Adults are not immune from misbehavior caught on camera. Second-grade 
teacher Thomas Hammer was caught on a video, later uploaded to YouTube, where 
he threatened to hit a skateboarder over the head with the said skateboard. He was 
initially faced with both felony and misdemeanor charges. When the felony charge 
was dropped and he was allowed to return to work at his school, parents demanded 
he be fired. At the time of writing, his case is still being considered.13
CONCLUSIONS
YouTube is a video-sharing social media site and one of the most popular sites on the 
web. It has over a billion unique visitors per month. The videos themselves provide 
the main investigative insight on YouTube, and although videos can be made private, 
most are public. As video sharing becomes more popular online, sites like YouTube 

178
CHAPTER 16  YouTube
become increasingly valuable sources of information, both through videos people 
post of themselves and through videos posted by others that depict the target.

CHAPTER
179
Forums and question and 
answer sites
Long before Facebook, Twitter, or even “old” social networking sites (like Myspace 
and Friendster), there were internet forums. In fact, Usenet, one of the first manifes-
­
invented.
DESCRIPTION OF FORUM­
Q&A-STYLE SITES
Forums, at their heart, allow people to post topics and for others to reply. Discussions 
are usually grouped together by topic. A spin-off of the internet forum is the question 
and answer site. People certainly post questions and look for answers within forums. 
However, there are sites dedicated to question asking and answering, usually with 
less support for sustained discussions and more support for highlighting the best 
answer.
There are thousands of these sites. While some are general purpose, many are 
dedicated to a particular topic. Communities can (and often do) form within these 
forums. The result is that, if you can locate a target on one of these sites, the content 
­
their interests and personality.
The basic premise of forums is that someone starts a discussion thread, with a 
question, image, link, etc., and others reply. Figure 17.1 shows an example discus-
­
dogster.com. Each post 
is shown in its own box, with a picture, name, and other info to the left. The posts 
also have a date and time when they were posted. This type of configuration is com-
­
Question and answer sites have a similar structure. Figure 17.2 shows a question 
and answers from the popular site Yahoo! Answers.
Users can also maintain profiles on the site. These may be simple, like a list of 
posts they have made, or only a name and date they joined. They can also be long 
and detailed, similar to a Facebook profile, with pictures, personal information, likes 
and dislikes, and more.
As an example of more extensive profiles available on these sites, consider Ask.
fm, a question-answer site dedicated specifically to asking people questions about 
themselves. A person's profile contains their answers to all the questions people have 
asked them. Figure 17.3 shows Malcom's Ask.fm profile.

Major forums and question and answer sites
MAJOR FORUMS AND QUESTION AND ANSWER SITES
As mentioned above, there are thousands of internet forums. Some are public 
and easy to find and others are quite private, known only to their members. 
Some are free and open to join and others are restricted to approved or invited 
members only.
The ten most popular forums1 in Table 17.1 show the diversity in number and 
topic. Also, note that even the largest of these forums is much smaller than any of the 
social networking websites we have looked at.
Question and answer sites tend to have more general topical focus (though it 
could be argued that they are just forums with a question and answer topic). Ask.fm 
is among the most popular of these, with 125 million registered users. The site trends 
young, with most users in their teens or early twenties.
Yahoo! Answers is also very popular. The exact number of users is hard to define, 
since anyone with a Yahoo! account for any reason has a Yahoo! Answers account 
by default. However, Quantcast2 estimates it has about half the number of visits each 
month that Ask.fm receives.
FIGURE 17.3

asked him about himself.

182
CHAPTER 17  Forums and question and answer sites
For investigation purposes, it is certainly worth looking for people on some of 
these large sites, particularly the question and answer ones. However, a more ­effective 
strategy is often to find forums that focus on specific interests of your target and then 
look for the target there.
FINDING PEOPLE
Because there are so many forums and question and answer sites, there are a number 
of strategies to use when looking for people. We will look at two major categories 
of search:
•	
A wide search, when you don't know what sites a target might participate in
•	
A narrow search, within specific forums
WIDE SEARCHES
When you don't know where you might find a target, Google searches may be your 
first best bet. If you have a known username for the target, simply searching for that 
username and the word “forum” will often turn up results. Since most forums have 
the word “forum” somewhere on the page, including the word in the search will nar-
row down results. This Google search is particularly effective when the user has a 
distinctive username; one that is a common word is less likely to be effective.
As an example, a search for “malcomcsmith forum” turns up a few false results 
and links to posts Malcom has made on goldenretrieverforum.com (Figure 17.4).
You may find accounts for a user on multiple forums this way. That alone can be 
an interesting insight into a target's life. You can potentially learn where they live, 
what their hobbies are, and what issues matter to them.
Note that not all forums are included in Google's search results, so you may not 
find all the forums a user participates in this way.

Finding people
NARROW SEARCHES
Google can also be useful for finding forums dedicated to particular topics that may 
interest a target. Searching for the term “forum” with any given topic is likely to turn 
up at least one forum result. Then, you can search for a user within that forum.
Question and answer sites have mixed search capabilities. Yahoo! Answers has 
basically no functionality to search for a user. A Google search restricted to the 
­answers.yahoo.com domain may help you find a user. However, Yahoo! Answers 
does not have usernames—user profiles are shown with a name only (e.g., “Bob”), 
and they are usually first names. This makes it difficult to get a unique search result 
for a person. However, if the user has a unique name they might use on the site, a 
Google search like the following may work:
site:answers.yahoo.com “Malcom Conroy-Smith”
Ask.fm, on the other hand, has a search feature that lets you search by first and/
or last name, username, or email address, or if you connect through a Facebook or 
FIGURE 17.4
Searching for malcomcsmith forum on Google returns a link to Malcom's page (and links 
to his posts) on the Golden Retriever Forum.

184
CHAPTER 17  Forums and question and answer sites
Twitter account, you can search for anyone in your friend or follower list. Figure 17.5 
shows the Ask.fm search interface. You can get to it by clicking the “Search” link at 
the top right.
Forums run on many different platforms. Most websites do not implement the 
forum component of their sites from scratch; they usually install existing forum soft-
ware on their servers. The two most popular forum software packages are vBulletin 
and phpBB. You do not need to know about these to conduct an investigation, but 
their popularity means that knowing how to search and interact with each can be use-
ful when working with many different forums online.
If you encounter a forum that uses either of these packages to run their forums, 
they may have the following search features. However, server operators can adjust 
the code and turn off some features. Also, some sites may require you to be registered 
and logged in before search options become available. Thus, consider these guide-
lines for the search capabilities that may be present.
vBulletin
vBulletin includes an advanced search option that lets you search for users through a 
variety of attributes. You can search by email, the username they use on the service 
and sometimes their username on other services (like Skype or Yahoo!), location, 
and even in the “biography” text a user has written about himself or herself. You 
can even search by IP address, the unique numerical address (e.g., 192.168.0.1) that 
identifies each computer on the internet. Figure 17.6 shows the advanced user search 
options as described in the vBulletin manual.
Again, not all sites will make all these options available.
FIGURE 17.5
The Ask.fm search interface.

185
Finding people
phpBB
phpBB also has an advanced search option to find users. It too includes search by 
username on the site and on other services, as well as search by email and IP address. 
Figure 17.7 shows the phpBB advanced search that may be available on some forums 
running this software.
GENERAL SEARCH TACTICS
In addition to these advanced user searches, the social searches described for many 
other social media sites can also be effective in forums. If you can locate a friend of 
the target, you may be able to look at that person's “friends” list on the forum and 
identify the target in that list. In general, you can see a list of friends for any person 
on the forum, though this may be restricted unless you are logged in as a forum user. 
Searching these lists may turn up the target.
FIGURE 17.6
The advanced search option on vBulletin-powered forums.

186
CHAPTER 17  Forums and question and answer sites
An important note: As described above repeatedly, many forums restrict your 
ability to search and view information if you are not a logged in user. While reg-
istration is usually quick and relatively anonymous, many forums show users a 
list of people who have visited their profile pages. Thus, your browsing through 
profiles will not necessarily be anonymous.
OBTAINING DATA
Each forum and question and answer site is likely to have different information avail-
able about users, but they follow a similar structure in providing it.
First, you can get to a person's profile either through search (discussed above) 
or by clicking on their name next to a post they have made. Figure 17.8 shows an 
example post by Malcom. His username and picture are above the post. Clicking his 
username would take you to his profile page.
FIGURE 17.7
The phpBB advanced user search interface.
FIGURE 17.8
A post by Malcom on a forum. Clicking his username above the post would take you to his 
profile page.

187
Case studies
Other sites may have the username and photo off to the left or right of the main 
post text.
Profiles are likely to contain some personal information, like name, location, 
and the date the person joined the site. They often have additional data specific 
to the topic of the site. For example, the popular forum at Bodybuilding.com has 
options to include information about bodybuilding goals, body fat percentage, 
photos, weight history, and supplements being used. Each forum may have its 
own personalized profile information. Profiles often have a list of posts a user 
has made.
The posts themselves are great sources of insight, though it requires more work 
to get that insight than simply reading attributes from a profile. The posts will let 
you see how the target interacts online and may also contain text about his interests, 
movements, and activities.
CASE STUDIES
Investigators have used postings from forums and question and answer sites in a 
number of ways.
CASE STUDY 1
One case is that of Adel Daoud, an 18-year-old man arrested as part of an FBI sting in 
Chicago.3 FBI agents provided him with a fake bomb and arrested him after he tried 
to detonate it outside a Chicago bar. He came to their attention through his posts on 
Yahoo! Answers. These allegedly included talk of violent jihad, and, according to 
The Chicago Sun Times,4 he posted “Hmm. WELL on a personal scale i hate Shiites, 
Christians, Atheists and then Jews.”
He also is alleged to have had a private chat in which he said he wanted to be a 
martyr and that he wanted to make a bomb. The posts he made online, especially the 
public posts on Yahoo! Answers, were a core part of the evidence brought forward 
so far in his legal proceedings.
CASE STUDY 2
In a gruesome case, a 16-year-old Japanese girl was arrested after posting on the 
popular Japanese forum 2channel about murdering her 15-year-old friend and 
classmate.5
The Japan Times reports that she started a thread titled “I have ended up killing” 
that included the message, “Oh no, blood keeps pouring out even though I have 
wiped it away many times.”6
She also allegedly uploaded photographs of the dismembered body of her friend. 
Her posts went up late on a Saturday night and prompted a police investigation. The 
girl was arrested hours later and charged with murder on Sunday.

188
CHAPTER 17  Forums and question and answer sites
CASE STUDY 3
Not to be outdone, a British man was arrested after befriending a 14-year-old girl on 
a fetish-oriented internet forum and plotting to kill and eat her as part of a cannibal-
ism fetish. He had posted on the board that he already had consumed “a woman aged 
39 and a 5-year-old.”7
CASE STUDY 4
Internet forums also helped catch a man who, in 2009, threatened to kill the then-
President-elect Barak Obama.8 The man, Steven Joseph Christopher, had previously 
threatened to assassinate President George W. Bush.
In January 2009, he posted several times on an alien- and UFO-oriented internet 
forum at alien-earth.org about his plots. Below is the text of three such posts released 
by the Department of Justice, who removed some of the racial slurs.
ok we have 6 days until my Presidential Assasination.
Yes, I have decided I will assassinate Barack Obama. It's really 
nothing personal about the man. He speaks well, has a loving al-
though controlling wife and two cute daughters. But I know it's 
for the country's own good that I do this. And I'm not racist 
either, my family is a little, but isn't all Italian and euro-
pean families? I mean how many times have you heard the word 
(racial slur) in the comforts of your home? I have a lot, and it 
really bothered me and I would confront them about it. No, it's 
not because I'm racist that I will kill Barack, it's because I 
can no longer allow the Jewish parasites to bully their way into 
making the American people submit to their evil ways. How many 
of you Obama supporters are now disappointed after some of his 
arm-twisted Jewish appointee decisions??? Make's you think he's 
not really in charge (which he isn't). No it's the same old, same 
old filthy (expletive) (racial slur) who are poisoning America, 
who have murdered thousands of innocent lives on 9-11-01, and are 
thinking that they are going to get away with it again.
Barack, I view more as a sacrificial lamb, but the sacrifice MUST 
take place. He had good intentions, but like the Steve Taylor 
song goes, “a politician next door, swore, he'd set the Washington 
arena on fire, thinks he'll gladiate them, but they're gonna make 
him a liar.”
So, I'm stuck here in Mississippi, and I'll need bus fare or some 
way of getting to Washington. I don't own a gun, so maybe someone 
can give me one. And I'll need a leak in the secret service to

RE: ok we have 6 days until my Presidential Assasination.
Why is your heart so wicked?
I can get away with actually murdering Barack Obama OR just 
threatening to do it.

I wll have you found, arrested and executed, if you push me too 
far.
Christopher made the threats on January 11, 15, and 16. Secret Service agents 
read the posts and used them to track down the man's IP address, which they used to 
determine the place he was staying. He was arrested on January 16, the same day as 
his last threat. He was eventually convicted and sentenced to three years in federal 
prison.9
CONCLUSIONS
While any individual online forum or question and answer site is smaller than 
most social networking websites, they can be excellent sources of insight when 
investigating a target. There are forums for just about every imaginable interest 
online, and active participants may have thousands of postings. Profile informa-
tion can also be extensive, but the text of the posts themselves is the most valu-
able data. It not only may describe crimes or plots but also may give a detailed 
picture of a person's beliefs, interests, movements, and the way they interact with 
others.
Not only may Google searches help find evidence of a target posting on a forum, 
but also it may be productive to first identify forums where a target might post and 
then search for them there. Policies vary from forum to forum, but some will require

you to have an account and be logged in before you can search or access posts and 
profile data. Furthermore, users may be able to see when you have visited their pro-
file if you are logged in while browsing.

CHAPTER
191
Other networking sites
Earlier in this book, we looked in depth at the major social media and social network-
ing sites online. While these are your best chance to find an arbitrary target, there are 
thousands and thousands of other social networks online. Some are standalone sites, 
­
-
plications, like Yelp, which focuses on reviews of businesses but which has a social 
network feature as well. These sites can be great places to find information about a 
­
find more information about him or her on one of these smaller social networks. The 
communities that form there tend to be more trusted exactly because they are smaller, 
and this can lead to freer sharing of information.
In this chapter, we will look at some of these networks. Our goal will be to identify 
common features and attributes in them, so if you come upon any new network in which 
your target is a participant, you will have general guidelines to follow to find him.
CHINESE SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES
There are many social networking Web sites that are not particularly popular in North 
America and Western Europe, but that have large user bases in other countries. We 
won't cover those in depth in this book, but it is worth looking at the Chinese market 
as an example. It has several networks that rival the size of Twitter and Facebook.
QZONE
­
-
tion to making friends, users can post text entries, like blog posts, photos, and music. 
They can also read and comment on friends' posts.
RENREN
Renren is a traditional social network platform that started off as a near clone of 
Facebook for the Chinese market. With nearly 215 million users, it is quite popular in 
­
social network, including profile pages and friend lists. It is also very popular—and 
makes much of its income—as a gaming platform.

CHAPTER 18  Other networking sites
Sina Weibo
Often called “Weibo” (pronounced WE-boah) for short, this site is a microblogging 
platform (“weibo” means “microblogging”) that is similar to Twitter with some 
­aspects of Facebook mixed in. It is very popular in China, where other popular sites 
like Twitter and Facebook are blocked. Estimates of its user base vary wildly, from 
10 million core users to over 500 million registered users. Weibo itself claims 130 
million active users1. It is also a platform where users express concerns with the 
­government, within the allowed confines.
Chinese censorship limits what can be posted on Sina Weibo. The general type 
of content is similar to what is found on Twitter: Posts have a 140-character limit 
and hashtags and @mentions are commonly used. The content of posts is closely 
monitored, however, and posts can be filtered and deleted if they contain certain 
keywords or links. Accounts with offending material are often deleted. As an ex-
ample of the extent of this censorship, on June 4, the anniversary of the Tiananmen 
Square protests that were quashed by the Chinese military, Sina Weibo blocked any 
posts that contained the words “today,” “tonight,” “June 4,” and “big yellow duck”2. 
This latter block was because the famous picture of a man standing in front of a line 
of Chinese tanks during the protest had been circulating where the tanks had been 
replaced with rubber ducks; the image was created in response to Chinese censorship 
(see Figure 18.1).
Figure 18.2 shows an example profile page from Sina Weibo. You can see it 
closely resembles a Twitter page, with a background image and profile picture on 
top, ­followed by a list of posts underneath.
Chinese law states that internet companies are required to ensure that people 
register with their real names. The Chinese government also closely monitors what 
people post on social media and puts considerable investigation into people who post 
information unfavorable to the government.
Political cartoonist Wang Liming was arrested in 2013 for “rumor mongering,” 
a common charge used to detain people for their social media posts. On Weibo, he 
forwarded a post about a grandmother who was holding her dead grandson, who had 
starved in a flooded region of the country. He was detained for “suspicion of causing 
a disturbance,” according to Reuters3. Maya Wang, an Asia researcher for Human 
Rights Watch, was quoted by the media outlet, describing this type of arrest as the 
communist party trying “to dampen the effectiveness of the internet to embarrass the 
government and press it to change.”
Wang is not the only one. In 2014, 81 people were detained and 4 arrested for 
similar reasons, “us[ing] social network services to fabricate and spread rumors, or 
forward rumors published on foreign Web sites,” according to police4.
OTHER SITES
There are many popular social networking sites with millions of users. Some of these 
are general interest sites and others are dedicated to a particular topic.

193
Other sites
This section will look at Ning, a roll-your-own social networking site; Myspace, 
once the most popular social networking site on the Web, which still has tens of 
­millions of users; and three examples of popular topic-specific social networking 
sites: Yelp, Goodreads, and Ravelry.
Note that these are simply interesting examples of other social networking sites; 
they were not chosen because they are more likely to reveal information about an 
arbitrary target. Hopefully, the discussion of each will paint a picture of general strat-
egies for finding information across a wide range of sites.
NING
As social networks became increasingly prominent online in the mid-2000s, people 
were starting up their own networks all the time. Some were imagined as potential 
competitors to the big social networking sites, like Myspace and Facebook. Others 
were designed to support a specific community of users who wanted a more tailored 
experience than was available through a big networking site.
FIGURE 18.1
In protest to Chinese internet censorship, this image was created, replacing the tanks 
in the iconic photo from the Tiananmen Square protest with rubber ducks. The photo 
was later banned on Chinese internet sites and the words “big yellow duck” were also 
censored.

194
CHAPTER 18  Other networking sites
Ning was created to fill this latter need. It is a platform on which anyone can cre-
ate their own social network. Users can register a social network and Ning hosts the 
site and provides the software and support to make it run. Within each site, users have 
an experience much like on any social networking site. They register for accounts; 
create profiles; blog; share photos, videos, and updates; and interact in discussions 
with other users.
Networks on Ning come and go. Some are created and used and then fade away. 
Others remain strong and have persisted for years. Over its life, estimates indicate 
that there have been roughly 2 million Ning sites created and that there are in the 
neighborhood of 100,000 active networks. Some of those have over 1 million users. 
Others have a tiny user base of less than 100 people. Overall, Ning claims to have 60 
million active users across its sites5.
FIGURE 18.2
A user's page on Sina Weibo. Note that even without understanding the Chinese text, it is 
easy to identify the structure of the site as very similar to Twitter.

195
Other sites
Figure 18.3 shows an example of a user profile (for our example user, Malcom) 
on a Ning site. One of the more popular sites hosted on the platform is DIY Drones, 
a site dedicated to amateur UAV (short for “unmanned aerial vehicle”) building with 
nearly 57,000 members. This page shows Malcom's profile within DIY Drones. On 
the left of Malcom's profile page is basic information about him, including his demo-
graphic information and friend lists. The center column shows posts and comments 
he has made within the community.
The design of individual Ning sites may vary, but they often use a common tem-
plate for the overall structure. DIY Drones does this; see Figure 18.3.
To find someone on a Ning site, you can search for them using their name in the 
search box at the very top right of the page. Another feature of interest to find someone 
is the “Members” link on the navigation bar toward the top of the page (the third option 
from the right in Figure 18.3). This provides a full list of members of that site with links 
to their profile pages. Figure 18.4 shows the Members page for DIY Drones.
Ning does not provide a searchable list of all their sites or users. Thus, if you are 
looking for a target, you cannot simply search for them across all Ning platforms. 
However, if you encounter a Ning site, you will be able to identify it by a “Powered 
by Ning | Mode Social” banner at the very bottom of the page. If you see that, you 
know you should be able to find a member list and expect a certain type of profile.
FIGURE 18.3

196
CHAPTER 18  Other networking sites
One final note: Ning site creators can control the privacy for their sites. This 
might mean that you cannot access information within a Ning site without having 
an account. Unlike many larger social networks, registrations for Ning sites may be 
held for approval to ensure you are an interested and valid member of the community.
MYSPACE
In the early days of social media, Myspace was an important player. Before Facebook 
came on the scene, it was the dominant social networking site. In the mid-to-late 
2008s, after losing much of its user base to Facebook, the site went through several 
transformations. The “new” Myspace profile page is shown in Figure 18.5.
Even though the site has been through many iterations, users who had accounts 
in the early days still have accounts on the new version of the site. In fact, Myspace 
took advantage of this to entice users back to the site by emailing them old photos of 
themselves that they had posted on the site long ago6.
FIGURE 18.4
The “Members” page of a Ning Web site.

197
Other sites
Myspace now has about 36 million users. To find people on the site, you can 
search by their actual name or a common username using the search box toward the 
upper left (see Figure 18.5).
Because the Myspace audience tends to be younger, many stories of people be-
ing investigated through the site relate to interaction with younger people. In 2009, a 
South Carolina swimming coach was arrested for contributing to the delinquency of 
a minor. Using fake accounts he created on Myspace, he befriended two 13-year-old 
girls and enticed them to send him sexually suggested photos7.
He is not alone. A Los Angeles-area man was arrested after he also created fake 
profiles on Myspace between 2009 and 2014, which he used to have sexually explicit 
conversations with underage girls. He sent and received explicit photos with the teens 
and tried to arrange meetings8. According to the charges, he did meet with some of 
the girls, resulting in charges of committing lewd acts upon a child.
Not to leave those two men in small company, yet another man, a Jacksonville 
Florida man collected sexually explicit photos from over 200 underage girls by pos-
ing as a teenage boy on Myspace9. After receiving the photos, he threatened the girls, 
claiming he would post the photos online unless they sent him more. He was arrested 
and charged and will soon face trial.
YELP
Yelp started off as a question-answering site but quickly became a place for review-
ing restaurants and local businesses. It is now extremely popular and powerful in that 
space. The site has tens of millions of reviews, and a study showed that a one-star 
rating change on Yelp could lead to a 5-9% change in business for a local company10. 
That power has led companies to carefully monitor their ratings and reviews. Some 
companies also monitor the people who write them (more on that shortly).
FIGURE 18.5
Malcom's Myspace profile page.

198
CHAPTER 18  Other networking sites
First, let's look at an overview of the site. Yelp has over 130 million unique users 
each month. Figure 18.6 shows Malcom's Yelp profile page. It has his personal in-
formation in the column on the left, his reviews in the center (currently, there is only 
one), and a list of friends and groups on the right.
Yelp can provide interesting insights into a person's habits and location. By look-
ing at all the places a person has reviewed, you can get a sense of the neighborhoods 
they spend the most time in and cities they visit often. You can also find the types 
of venues they care about. One user may review a lot of bars and restaurants, while 
another may review playgrounds and children's activity centers.
To find people on Yelp, first click the “Find Friends” tab that is under the search 
boxes at the top. There, you can search for people by name or by email address. 
Furthermore, if you log in with a Facebook account, Yelp can search for your Facebook 
friends in their network. If you cannot locate a target this way, a social search is pos-
sible. As mentioned above, people's friend lists are public and browsable, so if you can 
find an associate of the target, you may be able to locate the target through this list.
Because Yelp has become a powerful influence on people's interest in businesses, 
it has also become a place where people can be punished for their reviews. One story 
that made headlines is that of an inn that told wedding parties that they would 
be charged $500 for every negative review a guest left for them on Yelp11. The venue 
was inundated with bad reviews in response to the story, as outraged Web users made 
their feelings known. However, there are many stories of people being specifically 
targeted for their comments.
FIGURE 18.6
Malcom's Yelp profile page.

199
Other sites
One article details case after case of people writing negative reviews and 
­threatened with lawsuits12. A woman was threatened with a suit after writing a 
negative review of a car repair shop; a dentist threatened to sue a patient for a bad 
review. Some suits were dropped, but not all. A woman in Virginia wrote a nega-
tive review of her contractor, who in turn sued her for $750,000. He was awarded 
$250,00013. The trial was complicated—there appeared to be lies in the Yelp review, 
including accusations that the remodeler stole jewelry from her home. Eventually, 
the reviews were taken down and both sides walked away without being awarded 
any damages.
However, many businesses who may want to file suit cannot, because Yelp users 
are anonymous in many cases. A California bankruptcy lawyer wants to sue a user 
for defamation as a result of a negative review, but that user's real identity is not 
known. Instead, the lawyer is suing Yelp in an effort to compel the company to turn 
over the true identity of the user14.
GOODREADS
For readers, social media has always been a place to share thoughts about the books 
they are reading. Goodreads was put together for people to share those books and 
their thoughts about them and to keep lists of books to read later.
The social network on the site helps people see what books their friends have 
added to the lists along with ratings and reviews of books they have finished. It also 
has discussion boards for individual books or for online reading groups.
The site has around 650,000 users—very small compared with the mammoth so-
cial networking sites discussed earlier in this book, but quite large for a topic-specific 
social network.
Figure 18.7 shows Malcom's Goodreads profile page. It includes some basic de-
mographic information and lists of books he has made along with ratings and reviews.
If you have an account, you can find people in the “Friends” section of your 
profile page. They can be searched by name or email address. The site also sup-
ports importing friends or contacts from Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Facebook, and Twitter. 
People's friend lists are public, so it may be possible to find a target through an as-
sociate's account.
If the books a person is reading are of interest, Goodreads can be a useful source 
of information. You can find a person and see all the books they have read or plan 
to read.
RAVELRY
If the target of your investigation is a knitter or crochets, you will probably find him 
or her on Ravelry. With 4 million users, it is among the largest of the topic-specific 
social networking sites online.
Figure 18.8 shows Malcom's profile on Ravelry. It has basic demographics along 
with site-specific information on the right.

FIGURE 18.7
Malcom's profile on Goodreads.
FIGURE 18.8
Malcom's profile on Ravelry.

201
Notes
Users on Ravelry post knitting and crocheting patterns and discuss projects. There 
are active forums on the site as well. An individual's forum posts can be found by 
clicking on the number of posts shown in the right of their profile (e.g., in Figure 18.8, 
Malcom's profile says “0 posts” at the bottom of the first column of links on the right).
The people search section of the site allows you to find people by username or 
full name. Users' friend lists are also public (e.g., in Figure 18.8, Malcom has “0 
friends” shown on the right), allowing for social searches for a target.
Essentially, this site would be useful for a target whom you might investigate 
through an online forum about knitting. It provides additional information through 
the projects and friends that are part of the site.
CONCLUSIONS AND GUIDELINES
It is totally possible that your investigation target is not much of a reader and is not a 
knitter. The target may not post restaurant reviews and may have never set up a Myspace 
profile. However, looking at all these different sites can lead to a set of guidelines that 
can be useful when investigating on one of the many smaller social network sites:
1.	 Finding people works in ways similar to those discussed for other networks: 
Knowing a target's username and email address can help if they have a common 
name or if they use a pseudonym on a site.
2.	 Social searches are effective on almost every site: If you can't find the target, 
try searching through his or her associates. Friend lists are often public and 
browsable.
3.	 Content is king: The most valuable information you find on these sites will not 
be the basic profile information (which tends to be limited to demographics or 
data specific to the site's topical focus), but the things people say in discussions, 
posts, and comments. These can reveal a lot about them (their preferences and 
their behavior, in particular).
4.	 Look broadly for social networking sites: There is valuable information to 
be found even on smaller sites, and there are thousands of them. Know your 
target's interests and look for what's out there online to attract them. If you can 
locate them in a smaller network, you are likely to find a lot of good data.

CHAPTER
203
Social media sharing
In addition to the many sites dedicated to supporting social networking as their main 
purpose, there are plenty of sites that allow social interaction around users sharing 
media like photos, videos, and music. In all cases, the social component of these 
sites comes from people being able to follow others who post things a person finds 
­
The content people share on these sites can reveal a lot of information as we 
have already seen in the chapters about Instagram and YouTube. In this chapter, we 
will look at some of other popular sites in these categories and what kind of data is 
­
PHOTOS AND VIDEOS
It used to be that video sharing was uncommon because the bandwidth required to 
upload video and download it was too taxing. However, smartphones with cameras 
that take photo and video, generous data plans, and Wi-Fi access have made it much 
easier to do.
As a result, sites that used to be restricted to photo sharing now also support video 
sharing, and there are a number of sites dedicated entirely to sharing videos.
FLICKR
Flickr is one of the most popular of these sites, with close to 90 million users. People 
can upload and view other people's pictures on the sites. Each user's personal page is 
a photo stream that shows all the pictures they have uploaded. Figure 19.1­
example of a user's photo stream. Users can tag images and add locations.
Anyone can click on any picture, like it, or comment on it.
Users can create limited profiles that include their name, location, occupation, 
and contact information if the user chooses to share this. You can find this profile 
by clicking the “…” on the right at the bottom of the user's header image, as can be 
seen in ­
 
.
Users can also create social connections to one another by following people 
whose pictures they are interested in. Many photos and videos on Flickr are public, 
but users can make them private or restrict them to different groups of friends.
19

204
CHAPTER 19  Social media sharing
For an investigation, Flickr images can be interesting sources of information 
about the kind of events a person attends, the types of places they tend to go, and the 
subjects that interest them.
PHOTOBUCKET
Photobucket has 100 million registered members and stores photos and videos. It 
operates with many features similar to those Flickr offers. Users can create short 
profiles, follow others, and maintain a photo stream with their pictures and videos. 
There are privacy controls that users can set, so some images may be publicly visible 
and others are protected.
Photobucket makes money by selling prints of the photos people upload. It is also 
a common site used to store photos used online for business websites, blogs, and auc-
tion sites like eBay. Thus, the types of photos people upload are much more varied, 
with less personal content than one might expect.
VINE
Vine is a social video sharing app used on mobile devices. It has about 40 million 
users and is growing very quickly.
Users create six-second video loops that can have captions. Profiles are very 
­limited and basically have a name, profile photo, location, and a short descriptive 
sentence. The main thing you can find on a user's Vine homepage is a series of videos 
he has created. Users can like videos or comment on them.
FIGURE 19.1
An example of a Flickr user's photo stream.

205
Photos and videos
All Vine posts are public, and they are often shared on other social media sites, 
like Twitter. Thus, if you suspect a target might be posting to Vine, you can see if they 
link to any videos on Twitter, Facebook, or other sites. This might help you locate 
their Vine profile more easily. You can also search for people by their real name on 
Vimeo.
Figure 19.2 shows the view of a Vine video on an iPhone. The username is at the

While you might think that it is hard for people to reveal too much in a six-second 
video, Vine played a role in the investigation of an Australian student. In August, 
2014, 23-year-old Chris Lane was jogging in Oklahoma where he was studying on a 
baseball scholarship. He was shot, and despite witnesses' attempts to revive him, he 
was declared dead on the scene1.

CHAPTER 19  Social media sharing
Three teens were arrested for the murder, and one claimed they did it “just for 
the fun of it.” In their investigation of the boys, police found a Vine video posted 
by James Edwards, the youngest of the accused who was only 15 years old2. The 
clip shows him brandishing a weapon (a still from this Vine video is shown in 
Figure 19.3). Another investigation on social media found photos of guns and money 
on the suspects' Facebook pages, shown in Figure 19.4.
The teens are currently facing charges of first-degree murder and are being held 
without bond. They are set to go to trial in April 2015.

Music
VIMEO
Vimeo is a video-sharing site with many features similar to YouTube. It has 22 ­million 
registered users and 100 million visitors each month. Users can upload videos and 
follow other people whose videos they like. They can also restrict the privacy of their 
videos. You can search for people by their real name or email address on Vimeo in the 
main search box.
Like on YouTube, the content people post is used in investigations. Though Vimeo 
is less popular, it, too, has been cited in cases. One such case is that of a French teen 
who posted an aerial video of the city of Nancy that he took with a remote-controlled 
drone3. The video collected hundreds of thousands of views before it was ordered 
to be removed and the teen was investigated. French law requires drone operators 
to have the equivalent of a light aircraft license, because officials fear they could 
injure someone if they crashed. This video maker did not have that license, so he was 
arrested and charged with “endangering lives.” The videographer eventually pled 
guilty and was fined $5504.
MUSIC
There are many sites for listing music preferences and listening to music. Some of 
these have social components. This section looks at a couple of the most popular 
social music sites online.
Last.fm
Last.fm is a site that recommends music and allows users to keep track of their favor-
ite artists and songs. They have around 50 million users. Figure 19.5 shows a Last.
fm profile page for Malcom, which includes his library—a list of songs and artists. 
Profile information includes name, gender, and location. Users can also participate in 
discussions, and those posts can be tracked from the profile page as well.
There are privacy settings on Last.fm, though most profile information is public. 
You can search for people on Last.fm by their real name or by username. While sites 
like this are unlikely to have a lot of information about people's activities, they do 
yield a lot of insight about people's interests and preferences.
SoundCloud
While Last.fm allows people to curate music they like that other people have created, 
SoundCloud lets people upload and share their own audio files. In the same way 
YouTube and Vimeo let people upload video, SoundCloud supports uploads of audio, 
both music and spoken word. The site has roughly 40 million users.
Figure 19.6 shows Malcom's profile page on SoundCloud. It includes the audio 
files he has uploaded. Users can comment on audio files and follow users who they 
find interesting. You can search for people by their name or username on SoundCloud 
in the search box shown at the top of Figure 19.6.

Notes 
We have seen many stories of people being investigated for their posts on social 
media. SoundCloud offers an interesting anecdote about a user leveraging the site to 
share results of his own investigation. Posting under a pseudonym, a Turkish user 
used the site to share audio files of secretly recorded phone conversations of the 
prime minister talking with others5. The calls discussed illegal and corrupt activity. 
In response, the Turkish government blocked access to the site entirely.
CONCLUSIONS
As with the smaller social networking sites we looked at, smaller media sharing sites 
for photo, video, or music can also reveal useful information about users, their pref-
erences, and their social interactions. The types of investigations you can conduct on 
these sites are similar to what you would do on their larger cousins like Instagram 
and YouTube. While it may be less likely that you will find any specific individual on 
these sites, if you do find them, these sites can be an excellent source of information.

Online dating
INTRODUCTION
Online dating websites are a specific type of social media designed for people to find 
romantic partners and friends. The industry is extremely popular. There are roughly 
54 million single Americans, and 41 million people have tried online dating. Ten 
­
≈40% of single Americans—have used an online dating 
service.
­
in these profiles is quite extensive. Sites have dozens of personal attributes and hun-
dreds of questions that people use to describe themselves. These include basics like 
age, race, height, and favorites (books, movies, music, etc.), along with other per-
sonal information, like smoking and drinking habits, interest in having kids, dietary 
preferences and restrictions, and religion. Figure 20.1 shows basic profile informa-
tion from the online dating site okcupid.com.
Most sites also have options for users to answer questions that give additional 
­
many questions as they wish. Figure 20.2 shows one of these questions.
Although this personal information can be useful for investigation, people aren’t 
always honest in their dating profiles. Over half of online daters believe that someone 
has seriously misrepresented themselves in their profile. Men most often lie about 
­
MAJOR ONLINE DATING SITES
There are dozens of dating sites. Some are intended for a wide audience. Others are 
dedicated to specific demographics (e.g., Christian Mingle, JDate, or Gay Friend 
Finder) or interests (e.g., Adult Friend Finder, a swinger-oriented site).
If you know your target has a particular interest, it is worth checking out related 
­
yield results. Some of the most popular sites in the U.S. are as follows:
•	
Match.com: With 35 million unique monthly visitors, Match.com is one of 
the most popular dating sites. People can sign up for free, but generally pay a 
subscription in order to communicate with others.

CHAPTER 20  Online dating
•	
Zoosk: Targeted to younger users, with 70% of users under 35. There are an 
estimated 12 million unique monthly visitors to the site. It runs on desktop 
computers and mobile devices (including Android and iPhone devices).
•	
OkCupid: A very popular free dating site with around 11 million monthly 
users. This site has a special focus on quizzes used to match people. Figure 20.2 
shows an example of one question in the quizzes.
•	
eHarmony: With roughly seven million unique monthly users, this paid site 
focuses on matching people through compatibility testing using an extensive 
questionnaire. The main site does not allow same-sex couples. They also refuse 
some people after they complete the long profile questionnaire.
•	
Tinder is a relative newcomer to the online dating scene, but it is increasingly 
popular. It’s a service accessed through an app on mobile devices. Users browse 
the photos and profiles of other people online near them (see Figure 20.3). They 
indicate people whose profiles they like. If that person likes back, they are able 
to text with one another.

213
Finding people
FINDING PEOPLE
BY BASIC AND ADVANCED SEARCH
Most online dating sites have extensive search functionality. The most basic search 
functionality includes gender, age, and location of the target. Most sites also have 
advanced search functionality, which allows filtering results according to many per-
sonal attributes and interests.
Figure 20.4 shows the search page from OkCupid. A number of search options 
have already been entered, and the “Advanced” search options allow the user to 
choose attributes (like religion, education, drug use, pets, languages, or astrological 
signs, among many others) to filter the results.
BY EFFECTIVE SEARCH STRATEGIES
Remember that people often lie about themselves on online dating sites. Therefore, 
you may wish to search for a wider range of ages, body types, and income levels. In 
addition, some people leave parts of their profile blank; for example, many choose 
not to share their income level. If you search for a specific income level, users who

CHAPTER 20  Online dating
haven’t specified one will usually not appear in your search results. Thus, keeping 
the search as broad as possible will yield more results to review, but may increase the 
chances of finding a target.
BY EMAIL OR USERNAME
You may also search for people by email address or username. Usernames from 
other social media accounts are good candidates to try here, though people often hide 
their real names in their online dating profiles—often specifically to keep interested 
people from finding them elsewhere online.
Tinder is an exception to this rule: it does not offer searching for individuals. 
Anyone within range of your current location may come up, and you can only com-
municate if you both have liked one another’s profiles.
FIGURE 20.3

Project, but represents the average kind of information on a Tinder profile.

215
Obtaining data
OBTAINING DATA
If you can find a target on an online dating website, you will usually find a wealth 
of personal information. All the attributes a person can search by, as shown in 
Figure 20.4, are listed on a user’s profile page. There are also often short personal 
essays on a profile page, along with photos. Figures 20.6 and 20.7 show samples of 
a condensed profile on Match.com and a full profile on OkCupid, respectively. Note 
the long lists of personal attributes.
WHAT YOU WON’T FIND
At the same time, for privacy and safety, dating sites try to keep users somewhat anon-
ymous. Full names are never shown; rather, a username or a first name and last initial 
are usually shown instead. Addresses, contact information, and other personal data 
(which could allow someone to track down someone else) is also kept off these sites.

that a user can choose from to narrow the results.

216
CHAPTER 20  Online dating
RECENT ACTIVITY
Another common feature on dating sites is to display when a user last visited the 
site. This can help you learn how often a user is checking in and how frequently they 
interact on the site.
PROFILE VIEW NOTIFICATIONS
An important thing to keep in mind when using online dating sites to investigate a 
target is that, in most cases, people can see who viewed their profile. Nearly every 
site requires you to have an account and to be logged in to search for others. When 
you visit someone’s page, the site typically logs your visit, and shows that person a 
list of everyone who’s viewed their profile. Some sites, like OkCupid, have options 
to browse anonymously. However, in general, you should expect a visit to someone’s 
page to notify them with a link to your profile.

Case studies
CASE STUDIES
There are many cases where profile information from online dating sites has been 
useful to better understand a target, to locate them elsewhere online, or even catch 
them misbehaving.
ARRESTS AND INVESTIGATIONS
There are many stories of people being arrested where information from their online 
dating profiles was used to discover more information about them or to confirm their 
identities.
John Baylo
In June 2014, Christian Radio Host John Baylo was arrested in Michigan on child 
pornography charges1. He allegedly met his victim through another man, Ronald 
FIGURE 20.7
Example user Malcom’s OkCupid profile.

218
CHAPTER 20  Online dating
Moser. Police used known screen names for Ronald Moser to find his account on 
a Russia-based photo hosting website that contained child pornographic images. 
They found that he used the same photo and email address from the Russian porn 
sites to create an OkCupid account. This linkage, though screen names, photos, 
and email addresses on a legitimate dating website that contains a lot of personal 
information to a pornographic website is not conclusive proof that the same per-
son maintained both accounts, but it is strong evidence that would justify further 
investigation.
Steven Zelich
Journalists used a similar technique to track down online accounts of Steven Zelich, 
a former police officer accused of murdering two women2. He was reported to have 
met his victims online, and reporters for Wisconsin radio station WTMJ found three 
accounts for him on bondage-themed dating sites.
Michael David Miller
In another case, Michael David Miller of Colorado was arrested for sexually as-
saulting women he met online3. With the username mike22486, he maintained 
accounts on OkCupid, where he met some victims who came forward. Another 
woman came forward and accused him of sexual assault after they met through an 
ad on Craigslist.
A Google search for that username also turns up accounts on several adult-
themed personal sites, including HotMatch.com, Fuckbook.com, along with more 
mainstream dating sites Plenty of Fish, and the dating section of the online market-
place Oodle. All of the profiles use pictures of the same person and list his location 
in (or around) Aurora, Colorado.
This consistency and frequency of profiles paints a picture of the target’s inter-
ests, and also serves as a starting point for further investigation into his communica-
tions and contacts.
CONCLUSIONS
Online dating websites generally have extensive profile information about people, 
including their personal attributes and self-descriptive text. Millions of single people, 
especially in the US, have tried online dating and have profiles on at least one sight. 
The most popular dating sites have millions of users, but there are dozens of other 
sites designed for users with narrower interests.
It is rare to be able to browse profiles on dating sites without being logged in. 
While many sites allow you to create a free profile to search and browse others’ 
profiles, viewing them is usually logged, and notifies the profile’s owner. Therefore, 
during investigations, you should be careful about how you use these sites, especially 
if you want to keep your searches private.

CHAPTER
221
Analyzing networks
So far in this book, we've addressed how to collect information that people post on 
their social media profiles. After collection, there may be useful things to learn from 
that information as is. But if you want to go further, then the information must be 
analyzed.
­
social network 
analysis: the analysis of social connections a person has with others. Social network 
­
SNA) involves studying the structure of people's connections—especially 
things like who is most important or influential in the network and which groups of 
people are closely connected.
This chapter will introduce basic concepts in SNA and describe some available 
tools for conducting it. These are more advanced techniques than those covered so far.
INTRODUCTION
Before learning any terminology or technical details, we can begin with an intuitive 
first example of what can be done with SNA.
First, recall that in almost all social media sites, people have friends or other 
social connections. In doing SNA, we look at the connections among the target's 
friends. For example, if Alice is friends with Bob and Chuck, we would consider 
­
VISUALIZATIONS
Much of the analysis involves using pictures (called visualizations) of a social net-
work. Each circle in the image represents a person. If two represented people are 
­
A SIMPLE VISUALIZATION
Consider the simple example of Figure 21.1. The three circles represent three people, 
labeled Alice, Bob, and Chuck. Lines from Alice to Bob and from Alice to Chuck 
­
between Bob and Chuck, we know they are not connected.
21

222
CHAPTER 21  Analyzing networks
Most social network visualizations are much larger than this. At those scales, 
patterns tend to emerge.
A COMPLEX VISUALIZATION
Take a look at Figure 21.2. It will seem complex at first but should be clear with a 
bit of explanation.
This picture shows all the followers of a specific target on Facebook. The lines 
that connect two dots indicate that the people have a social connection. In this case, 
since it is a Facebook network, a line between two dots means that the two people are 
friends. The target is not in the picture, since we know the target would have a line 
connecting him or her to every other dot. Remember that although the dots/circles are 
smaller than in Figure 21.1, each one still represents a person here.
Alice
Bob
Chuck
FIGURE 21.1
A visualization of a small social network. This shows that Alice has connections to Bob and 
Chuck, but that Bob and Chuck do not have a connection to one another.
FIGURE 21.2
A visualization of a more complex network. As before, each dot represents a person and 
each line connecting two dots indicates that those people have a social connection.

223
Terminology
Sometimes, when the dots are really close together, you can't see a line between 
them. On the other hand, the closer the dots are to one another, the more strongly 
they (and their friends) are connected. Thus, even if you can't see a line between very 
close dots, there's often a connection between those overlapping dots.
The color coding in the image is used to indicate which people are most tightly 
grouped together. You'll also notice that some dots are bigger than others. The size 
indicates the influence that person has in the network. Both the groups of nodes and 
the importance rankings are things that can be calculated by tools that produce these 
visualizations, and we will see how that works later in the chapter.
Learning from the Visualization
Proceeding only from the picture in Figure 21.2, we can draw some conclusions. 
(Recall that the dots are people and the lines are social connections.) First, this target 
has very distinct groups of friends. The red group toward the top of the image and the 
green one at the bottom are totally disconnected from everyone else. Only one person 
connects the blue and purple groups on the right with the larger yellow group on the 
left. If we put names on the dots, we would know which people are part of which 
group, who is most influential, etc.
SNA allows us to generate these pictures and make calculations about people's 
role in the social network. The rest of this chapter will explain the basic terminology 
and computations of SNA, along with the software available to help you collect and 
analyze this data.
TERMINOLOGY
If you choose to apply any SNA to your targets, there are some terms that are impor-
tant to know.
NODES, EDGES, AND GRAPHS
People in your network are called nodes. Nodes are represented by the circles/dots 
in the image shown in Figure 21.1. The relationships between people, shown as lines 
connecting the nodes in Figure 21.1, are called links or edges.
A group of nodes and edges make up a social network. This is also called a graph 
or social graph.
Nodes and edges can have information attached to them. For example, nodes rep-
resent people, so they could be labeled with the names of the people they represent. 
Edges can also have labels. This could describe the type of relationship people have 
(e.g., family, friend, and coworker), or it could be a numeric value that describes how 
often people interact with one another or how strong their relationship is.
You can use any labels you want on nodes and edges if it makes the network more 
informative.
EDGE DIRECTIONALITY
Edges can also have a direction.

224
CHAPTER 21  Analyzing networks
An undirected edge generally means that the people connected by the edge know 
one another. For example, on Facebook, when Bob adds Chuck as a friend, Chuck 
has to approve it. The friendship relationship on Facebook implies that both people 
want the social connection. However, that is not always the case. For example, on 
Twitter, Bob may follow Chuck, but Chuck may not follow Bob back. In that case, 
we would want to represent that the following relationship only goes one way.
A directed edge is usually drawn with an arrow head pointing in the direction of 
the relationship. If there are some directed edges in a network, all the edges should 
have a direction indicated, even if they are mutual. Figure 21.3 shows a couple ways 
of drawing these edges. In this case, A has a directed edge to B, while A and C have 
a mutual relationship. The graph on the left shows a double-headed arrow between A 
and C indicating their relationship. This can also be drawn with two arrows that show 
each direction, like in the graph on the right.
With any network (directed or undirected), there are common features that are 
helpful to consider. Figure 21.4 shows a sample network that we will use to think 
about these concepts. The network in Figure 21.4 is undirected.
FIGURE 21.3
Two ways of drawing directed networks. The graph on the left has a one-way relationship 
from node A to node B and a bidirectional relationship between A and C indicated by a 
two-headed arrow. The same is shown on the right, but two edges connect A and C.
FIGURE 21.4
A sample network with 8 nodes and 8 edges.

225
Terminology
PATHS
A path is a series of edges connecting two nodes. For example, though Ed and 
Alice do not have an edge connecting them (there is not a direct relationship), 
there is a path from Ed, to Heidi, to Alice. Paths have lengths, which are mea-
sured in the number of edges you have to traverse to get from one person to the 
next. In the path from Ed to Alice, the shortest path between them has a length of  
2 (one edge from Ed to Heidi and another from Heidi to Alice).
From Frank to Chuck, there are two shortest paths: the first step can go to either 
Ed or Gerda; then, the second step goes to Heidi, then to Alice, and then to Chuck. 
The path length is 4.
Shortest path length is a very important property in SNA. It helps you understand 
how closely two people are connected. If the shortest path connecting two people 
is very long, it is unlikely that they may ever interact or influence one another. Two 
people with a path of length 2 between them mean that it's more likely they will have 
some interaction.
NODE DEGREE
People may have many friends or few. In a network, the number of connections a 
node has is called a degree. In Figure 21.4,
•	
Alice has the highest degree: 4 (connections to Heidi, Bob, Chuck, and Dan);
•	
Dan has a degree of 1 (only one connection to Alice); and
•	
Frank has a degree of 2 (connections to Gerda and Ed).
If you have a directed network, nodes also have an in degree and an out degree, 
which correspond to the number of edges coming in (with arrows pointing at the 
node) and going out (arrows pointing away), respectively.
Egocentric Networks
It is not possible to look at the full Facebook network of 1.4 billion people. It is too big 
and it is unlikely to yield many interesting insights from looking at the whole thing. 
However, one way we often look at social network data is through an egocentric net-
work. This is a social network focused around one individual. The egocentric network 
for Alice will consist of Alice's friends' any edges that exist between her friends.
In Figure 21.4, Alice has four friends: Heidi, Bob, Chuck, and Dan. There are no 
edges directly connecting any of them to one another, so Alice's egocentric network 
would have only 4 stand-alone nodes.
In social media, egocentric networks are often much more complex and interest-
ing. For example, Figure 21.2 is actually a visualization of the author's egocentric 
network on Facebook. The colored clusters represent different groups of friends. The 
yellow group in the center is work friends. The blue group toward the upper right is 
family and the purplish group next to that is high school friends. The large blue node 
connecting family and high school friends is her brother. The green group isolated 
at the bottom is her hockey team, and the red group at the top is a group of internet 
friends who met on a forum.

226
CHAPTER 21  Analyzing networks
Clusters
This egocentric network also highlights another important concept for analyzing net-
works: clusters. Clusters are groups of nodes that have many connections between them 
and are more tightly grouped than others. There is no real technical definition of a clus-
ter, but they are easy to see when looking at a picture of the network, like in Figure 21.2.
This chapter will primarily focus on egocentric networks—specifically, a target's 
egocentric network. The analysis will reveal information about the target's social 
circles, the people important in the target's life, and those who have the most influ-
ence among the target's friends.
ANALYSIS
One of the most interesting things we can do when analyzing a social network is to 
determine which nodes are most important. There are a number of ways to do this, and 
each measure tells us about importance in a different way. In this section, we will look 
at the most popular measures of node importance, but we will not go over the details 
of how to calculate these values. If you use a network analysis program (discussed 
later in this chapter), it will calculate those values for you.1 Thus, the important thing 
to take from this section is to recognize the names and meanings of each measure.
CENTRALITY
Centrality is the term used to describe the collection of measures that indicate how 
important a node is. There are a number of ways to calculate centrality, but we will 
focus on four major methods: degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness 
centrality, and eigenvector centrality.
Degree Centrality
Degree centrality is the simplest centrality measure to compute. Recall that a node's 
degree is simply a count of how many social connections (i.e., edges) it has. The 
degree centrality for a node is simply its degree. A node with 10 social connections 
would have a degree centrality of 10. A node with 1 edge would have a degree cen-
trality of 1.
Sometimes, a SNA program will convert those numbers into a 0-1 scale. In such 
cases, the node with the highest degree in the network will have a degree centrality of 1,  
and every other node's centrality will be the fraction of its degree compared with 
that most popular node. For example, if the highest-degree node in a network has 20 
edges, a node with 10 edges would have a degree centrality of 0.5 (10 ÷ 20). A node 
with a degree of 2 would have a degree centrality of 0.1 (2 ÷ 20).
For degree centrality, higher values mean that the node is more central. As 
mentioned above, each centrality measure indicates a different type of importance. 
Degree centrality shows how many connections a person has. They may be con-
nected to lots of people at the heart of the network, but they might also be far off 

227
Analysis
on the edge of the network. For example, in Figure 21.5, both nodes labeled “Bob” 
have the same high degree (i.e., lots of social connections, 9 in this case), but the two 
roles they play are very different. The one on the right is very central and the one on 
the left is peripheral. These show that while degree centrality accurately tells us who 
has a lot of social connections, it does not necessarily show who is in the “middle” 
of the network.
Closeness Centrality
Closeness centrality looks for the node that is closest to all other nodes. Recall that 
a path is a series of steps that go from one node to another. Closeness centrality for a 
node is the average length of all the shortest paths from that one node to every other 
node in the network.
To see how it works, we can do a simple example with the network in Figure 21.6.
Let us determine the closeness centrality for node D and for node A.
Start by computing the average shortest path length of node D.
Next, we need the distance from D to every other node in the network. It has a 
distance of 1 to each of its direct friends: C, E, and H. The following table shows all 
of the shortest path lengths for D.
(a)
(b)

Two networks where “Bob” has a degree of 9. In (a), he is on the periphery of the main 
network. In (b), he is right in the middle.

The average of those shortest path lengths is
We divide it by 7 because there are 7 other nodes. Thus, the closeness centrality 
for node D is 1.71.
We do the same process for node A. The table below has all the shortest path 
lengths.

Thus, node A's closeness centrality is 3.43.
In the case of closeness centrality—unlike with degree centrality—smaller values 
mean that the node is more central, because it means that it takes fewer steps to get to 
other nodes. So, since D's value of 1.71 is smaller than A's value of 3.43, D is more 
central.
Closeness centrality corresponds the closest to what we see visually. Nodes that 
are very central by this measure tend to appear in the middle of a network. A node 
with strong closeness centrality also tends to be close to most people. In an inves-
tigation, that means the person will be in a good position to hear from most friends 
of friends. They will be a good source of secondhand information since it can reach 
them quite easily.

Analysis
The final two centrality measures are more complicated in their calculation, but 
they also offer additional insights.
Betweenness Centrality
Betweenness centrality is a widely used measure that captures a person's role in al-
lowing information to pass from one part of the network to the other.
For example, consider Bob in Figure 21.5 (A). He is the critical mode that allows 
information to pass from the cluster on the right to all the individual people he knows 
that were shown on the left. All information passing to and from those notes on the 
left must go through Bob if it is going to reach anyone else.
Thus, Bob is very important to the flow of information through this network. 
This is what betweenness centrality captures. Technically, it measures the percentage 
of shortest paths that must go through the specific node. The computation of this is 
quite complex, but every network analysis software tool will compute it for you. The 
important thing to know is that betweenness is a measure of how important the node 
is to the flow of information through a network.
In an investigation, a node with high betweenness is likely to be aware of what is 
going on in multiple social circles. For example, in Figure 21.2, the large blue node 
in the upper right connects the blue group to the purple group. It is the only node 
that does so. Thus, talking to this large blue node with high betweenness is likely to 
yield insights about what both groups are doing and what is going on between those 
two groups.
Eigenvector Centrality
The final centrality measure is eigenvector centrality. It measures the influence that 
a node has in a network. Again, the computation is quite complex, but any software 
package you use will compute it for you. (Interestingly, this measure is very similar 
to what Google uses to rank web pages by importance.)
A node may have a low-degree centrality—and maybe even weak closeness cen-
trality and betweenness centrality—but it can still be influential. Although a node 
that is central by one measure is often central by several other measures, this is not 
necessarily always the case.
Figure 21.7 shows centrality according to the four measures we have looked 
at. Red nodes are very central according to the given measure, and blue nodes are 
not central. Notice how there are large differences among the four pictures of the 
same network.
In summary, in an investigation, it is worth taking a look at anyone who has high 
centrality according to any of these measures. It's important to remember what each 
measure of centrality means:
•	
Degree centrality shows people with many social connections.
•	
Closeness centrality indicates who is at the heart of a social network.
•	
Betweenness centrality describes people who connect social circles.
•	
Eigenvector centrality is high among influential people in the network.

CHAPTER 21  Analyzing networks
OBTAINING SOCIAL NETWORK AND DATA
For anyone—of any skill level—obtaining data about the social network is often 
the most challenging part of the process. Although social networks can be en-
coded by hand, social media networks often have hundreds or thousands of people 
in them, with thousands or tens of thousands of edges, making hand encoding 
impossible.
Fortunately, there are tools available online and built into network analysis tools 
that will grab the social network for a target user and allow you to save it in a format 
that an analysis tool can open. Those tools are constantly evolving and changing, and 
new ones are becoming available.
FIGURE 21.7
This is the same network shown four times. Color coding indicates centrality according for 
different measures. Red nodes are more central and blue nodes are less central. Version 
(a) is degree centrality, (b) uses closeness centrality, (c) shows betweenness centrality, and 
(d) is eigenvector centrality. This visualization is adapted from Claudio Rocchini.

231
Example analyses
In the next chapter, we will look at popular and stable tools that are likely to be 
available to you. Those tools will also allow you to analyze social networks.
In addition to computing the centrality measures described above with other sta-
tistics, these tools create visualizations. The images in Figures 21.2 and 21.7 are 
network visualizations. It is essentially a picture of the network. Nodes are shown 
as dots and edges are lines connecting them. There are many automated techniques 
for arranging the network into patterns that highlight important features, like clusters 
and important nodes.
The next chapter will also illustrate how to get started with these tools, including 
how to calculate some of the statistics mentioned here and how to create a visualiza-
tion. But before we get to the details of how to get the data and create a visualization, 
let's look at some examples of what you should look for in a visualization and what 
it means in the context of an investigation.
EXAMPLE ANALYSES
To see how this analysis could work in an investigation, this section will present 
several example networks and walk through some of the insights that come from 
looking at them.
EXAMPLE 1
Start by looking at the network in Figure 21.8. (This network is contrived for illus-
trative purposes, not created from real-world data.) We will treat it as the egocentric 
network of a target (i.e., each node is a person the target knows). The edges connect 
which of those people know one another.
The nodes in Figure 21.8 indicate additional information as follows:
•	
Color indicates betweenness centrality (higher betweenness nodes are darker).
•	
Size indicates degree centrality (higher-degree nodes are larger).
Each node is labeled with a letter to make discussion easier.
What are some things we can learn about the target from looking at this network?
First, remember that this is an egocentric network. It shows only people who are 
connected to the target. The edges indicate which of the target's connections know 
one another. For example, since node Z and node S are connected in the network, that 
means that the target knows both Z and S and they know one another.
With that in mind, the groups at the top and bottom become very interesting. 
At the bottom, node Z is connected to six people (T, U, V, W, X, and Y) who are 
not connected to anyone else. Since this is an egocentric network, that means that 
the target and node Z know all these people, but they do not know anyone else in 
the social circle. This probably implies that the target and Z have a special kind of 
relationship where they are together when they meet other people. There is no way 
to know what kind of relationship, but spouses would be one example where we 

232
CHAPTER 21  Analyzing networks
might see this. If the target and node Z are married, it is likely that, as a couple, they 
would have met people together. The nodes connected to Z could be six people they 
had met as a couple.
Even more interesting is the fact that at the top of the network in Figure 21.8 
is another node with which the target had a similar relationship. Node A is con-
nected to 9 other nodes that are not connected to anyone else in the network. 
Could this be another romantic relationship for the target, where the couple is 
FIGURE 21.8

darker nodes being more central. Size indicates degree centrality, where larger nodes have 
higher degree.

233
Example analyses
meeting different people? Could it be a business partner and could this part of the 
network reflect business contacts that the partners have met together? We can't 
tell that from the network, but the fact that the target has these type of relation-
ships means that both node A and node Z would be interesting people to look to 
for more information.
There is also a tightly connected cluster of people in the middle of the network, 
and node A knows two of these people as well. While this group is very tightly con-
nected, it is not uncommon to see groups like this in egocentric networks. It usually 
reflects a tight group of friends or coworkers who are all connected to one another. 
Since, basically, everyone in this group knows everyone else, it makes it interesting 
that only two of the nodes know node A. Does that mean these two nodes (M and L) 
are connected to another part of the target's life? Do they hold a position of special 
privilege? Why would they know node A when no one else in the tightly clustered 
group does? This makes nodes M and L interesting for a couple reasons: first, be-
cause there are these open questions about their relationship with the target and, 
second, because they can likely provide more insights into the target's relationship 
with node A.
Node S is also connected to two people in this cluster: P and Q. But node S has 
only one other connection—Z.
This also raises a few questions. First, what does it mean that node Z does not 
know anyone in the central cluster? If node Z has a special relationship with the 
target, why is Z in the dark about people with whom the target obviously has a close 
relationship?
It also leads to questions about node S. Is S like the other singleton nodes known 
by the target and node Z, and it just happens that S knows other nodes in the main 
cluster? Or do the target and node S have a special relationship where node S is con-
nected to the target's main group and the group connected to node Z.
EXAMPLE 2
Now, let's consider a larger network that is more typical of what you might find when 
looking at a target's social media network. Figure 21.9 shows the egocentric network 
for a Twitter user.
There are two major features of this network that pop out in the visualization:
•	
First, there is a large, tightly grouped cluster shown in red that has some 
connections to the large central group but is mostly separated.
•	
Second, there is a very large blue node in the center cluster. It has a thick black 
border added to make it easier to see in this visualization. This node happens to 
connect the red cluster to the main part of the network.
Understanding who these groups and individuals are will provide insight into 
what the relationships are in this network.
We can begin by focusing on that large node. It has high betweenness (indicated 
by the large size) because many shortest paths pass through it. Essentially, this node 

234
CHAPTER 21  Analyzing networks
connects the main part of the network with the red cluster. Thus, we know that both 
this node and the target, who is not shown in the network, know one another and that 
they both know two groups of people: the red group and the main group including 
blue, green, orange, and purple nodes.
The next step is to understand what makes the red cluster unique. This is not 
something we can deduce just from looking at the visualization. Instead, we need to 
look at who the people are whom these nodes represent. On social media, that means 
finding the accounts of people in the cluster and looking for common patterns. When 
there are hundreds of nodes, as in this case, you can start by picking a handful to 
examine to see if patterns emerge. In this example, we would do that by displaying 
or finding the usernames of some nodes in the red cluster and going to their profiles 
at http://twitter.com/«username».
These users are not revealed here to protect their privacy, but an analysis would 
show that the users in the red cluster almost exclusively post in Japanese and are 
located in Japan. Users in the main cluster, on the other hand, are primarily English 
speakers. Thus, our target (and the large blue node in the center) appears to have 
connections to a community of Japanese users in addition to their main contacts who 
speak English.
FIGURE 21.9

tool guesses each person belongs to. Size indicates betweenness centrality.

235
Note
In many people's social media networks, you are likely to find clusters like this, 
and they will often share a distinguishing trait. It may not be something as obvious 
as language. You may have to probe deeper into their profiles to see where they are 
from, what they topics are that they discuss, or what other personal attributes they 
have in common.

Network data is inherently different than traditional datasets and require specialized soft-
ware to analyze and visualize. New tools, such as NodeXL, are making network analysis 
increasingly accessible, particularly to nonprogrammers. NodeXL is a free add-in for 
Microsoft Excel, supported by the Social Media Research Foundation. In this chapter, 
we'll introduce the basics of using NodeXL. For a more comprehensive treatment, see 
Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World.
INSTALLING AND NAVIGATING
Users of recent versions of Windows and Office can run NodeXL. The application 
is downloaded from http://nodexl.codeplex.com­
into the start menu and choose “NodeXL Excel Template.” This will open a blank 
NodeXL workbook file, which includes a custom NodeXL menu ribbon as shown 
in Figure 22.1. The menu provides access to all NodeXL features, which are orga-

a single network. Within each file, there are several specialized worksheets, which 
each contains data associated with different dimensions of a network. For example, 
the Vertices worksheet includes a row for each person (i.e., node) in the network 
as shown in Figure 22.1. Additional information about each person is shown in the 
many columns to the right of the person. For example, the number of followers and 
tweets associated with each user in Figure 22.1 are shown. Other columns show the 
visual properties of a node (e.g., its color, size, and shape), labels, and centrality met-
rics that help identify how “important” a person is in the network.
The Edges worksheet includes a row for each link, tie, or connection between 
two entities along with related information. For example, the first row of Figure 22.2 
shows that Twitter user bostontweetup mentioned ga_boston in a tweet posted 1 Dec,

2014 at 21:00, along with other information. Other columns show information such as 
the visual properties (e.g., thickness and style) and labels associated with each edge.
Additional worksheets contain additional information about the summary of 
overall network metrics, the composition of groups (i.e., clusters of related nodes), 
and the summary of textual analysis of text content. The following sections explain 
how to capture social media network data similar to this example and introduce the 
techniques needed to gain insights into network data by calculating appropriate net-
work metrics and creating meaningful visualizations.
COLLECTING NETWORK DATA
Although network data is at the core of social media sites, these services do not 
always make it easy to extract. NodeXL helps collect social media network data 
by providing data importers that automatically grab data from popular social me-
dia sources such as Twitter, email, YouTube, and Flickr. Additionally, third-party 
data importers (which can be installed separately) allow users to import data 
from other sources such as Facebook and MediaWiki (see http://nodexl.codeplex.
com/wikipage?title=Third-Party%20NodeXL%20Graph%20Data%20Importers). 
Network data can also be manually entered, copied in from another spreadsheet, 
and imported from another network analysis tool (e.g., GraphML file) or from the 
NodeXL Graph Gallery (found at http://nodexlgraphgallery.org), which features col-
lections of NodeXL network datasets available for download.
Importing Twitter Search Data
To import tweets that contain a certain keyword or phrase, choose the 
NodeXL > Data > Import > From Twitter Search Network menu option from the 
NodeXL menu ribbon. This will open the import dialog shown in Figure 22.3. This 
feature can create a network of Twitter users who recently used the keyword(s) you 
specify (“social media” in this example). Twitter users will be connected to each 
other based on mention and reply-to relationships as shown in Figure 22.2.
The search term(s) that you want to map and measure can be entered in this 
dialog along with other options as desired. By default, the importer only grabs the 
latest 100 tweets, which should be increased to as much as 18,000 for more popular 
items. Twitter's data access rules and restrictions limit the amount of data you can 
download, particularly for follow relationships, as described in the “More about this 
option” section. Additionally, only recent data is collected—anywhere from a few 
hours to about a week depending on the popularity of the topic. The first time you use 
the NodeXL Twitter importer, you will need to authenticate with Twitter as described 
in the checkboxes in the lower left corner of Figure 22.3. Selecting the “Expand 
URLS in Tweets” option will convert shortened URLs into their underlying form.
After clicking OK and waiting for the network data to download from Twitter, 
NodeXL will populate the Edges and Vertices worksheets with the basic network 
data and the additional Twitter statistics shown in Figures 22.1 and 22.2.
Other NodeXL network importers work in a similar way, although the networks 
they create differ depending on the types of connections supported by the social media 

240
CHAPTER 22  How to use NodeXL
platform. For example, the YouTube Video Network imports a network where the nodes 
are YouTube videos and the edges connecting them are generated based on the number 
of people who comment on both videos (or the number of category tags they share).
Importing a Sample Facebook Ego Network
The remainder of this chapter will use data from one of the author's anonymized 
Facebook ego network. In other words, it shows the relationships among all of one 
of the author's Facebook friends (though their names have been changed to the most 
popular baby names of 2014). You can find the Sample Facebook Ego network on the 
NodeXL Teaching Resources web page, which also links to other resources that may be 
of interest: https://nodexl.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=NodeXL%20Teaching%20
Resources. Once downloaded to your desktop (or other “trusted” location on your 
computer), open a new NodeXL file and choose NodeXL > Data > Import > From 
NodeXL Workbook Created on Another Computer. This will create a local copy of 
the NodeXL network data file, which you can then navigate to and open.
Alternatively, you can import your own Facebook ego network after installing the 
Social Network Importer for NodeXL plug-in (see http://socialnetimporter.codeplex.
com for download and installation instructions). There are three different Facebook 
importers that extract networks from Facebook Fan Pages, Groups, and personal 
Friend networks. To import your personal ego network, use the default settings in the 
From Facebook Personal and Timeline Network importer.
FIGURE 22.3

“social media” entered.

241
Analyzing networks
After importing the sample file or your own network, change the Graph Type to 
Undirected. To do this, find the Type: drop down in the Graph portion of the NodeXL 
ribbon and select Undirected. Facebook Friendship relationships must be mutual or 
“undirected.” When analyzing other networks, such as Twitter follow networks, the 
network Type should be set to Directed, which will assure that arrows appear on 
network edges to indicate a relationship that starts with one person and ends with 
another.
ANALYZING NETWORKS
NodeXL includes several tools to help analyze network data, which are available via 
the Analysis section of the NodeXL menu ribbon. This section introduces the most 
commonly used features including a guide to creating groups of nodes based on net-
work clustering algorithms and calculating common social network analysis metrics 
such as those described in the prior chapter.
CREATING GROUPS OF NODES
It is often useful to identify network groups or collections of nodes that belong to-
gether. Groups can be created based on different techniques in NodeXL, which are 
available via the Groups drop-down menu in the Analysis section of the NodeXL 
menu ribbon. One technique is to create groups based on a shared attribute of the 
vertices (e.g., Facebook users that share the same gender and Twitter users that are in 
the same time zone). Another technique, illustrated in this section, is to create groups 
based on the network structure itself.
As illustrated in the prior chapter, there are often subsets of nodes that are highly 
connected to one another, which are only loosely connected to other nodes or sub-
groups in the network. This will become apparent as we calculate network-based 
groups, called clusters in NodeXL, in the Sample Facebook Ego network file. The 
sample Facebook file includes all of one of the author's Facebook friendship inter-
connections. The author is not shown in the graph itself, since he would be connected 
to all other nodes, making it unnecessarily cluttered. The focus instead is on the 
shared connections among his friends.
Once you have opened the file, choose the “Group by Cluster” option in the 
NodeXL > Analysis > Groups drop-down menu, which will open a window similar 
to that shown in Figure 22.4. There are several clustering algorithms (also called 
“community detection algorithms”) to choose from, each of which will give slightly 
different results. Trial and error can help identify the one that creates the most mean-
ingful groupings. For now, use the Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm and make sure 
to check the box, which will create a single group that includes all nodes that are 
disconnected from all other nodes. This can help keep graphs with many isolated 
individuals less cluttered.
Once the clustering algorithm calculation completes, you will be taken to the 
Groups worksheet shown in Figure  22.5. Each row on the worksheet shows a 

242
CHAPTER 22  How to use NodeXL
­different group (named G1, G2, G3…) each of which is given a default color and 
shape, which becomes visible when the NodeXL > Graph > Refresh Graph menu op-
tion is selected. Clicking on one of the rows will highlight all of the nodes in that 
group. Labels can be entered in the label column (see Figure 22.5). Do not change 
the group names themselves (e.g., G1), since changing them will break the group 
functionality. Labels only show up if the network visualization is configured to 
FIGURE 22.4
Group by Cluster options.
FIGURE 22.5
Groups worksheet showing eight different groups (G1, G2, … G8).

243
Analyzing networks
show each group in a separate area on the graph pane, as described later in this 
chapter. NodeXL can automatically calculate network metrics for each group as 
described in the following section.
In the Facebook social network, the groups created and shown in Figure 22.5 
correspond to different groups of the friends of one of the authors. For example, G1 
consists of one of the author's family and friends, G2 includes friends from graduate 
housing, G3 includes work colleagues, and so forth. To be clear, the network cluster-
ing algorithm knows nothing about the individuals' attributes (e.g., where they went 
to graduate school). It creates groups based solely on which nodes are densely con-
nected to one another in distinct clusters. Labels, such as “work colleagues,” can be 
applied only by someone who knows the network and can interpret it.
The list of which nodes are included in each group is stored in the NodeXL Group 
Vertices worksheet. For example, in the sample file, we see that Becket, Tucker, and 
many others are part of G1 since they are next to G1.
CALCULATING NETWORK METRICS
Many commonly used network metrics can be calculated using NodeXL. Choose 
Graph Metrics from the Analysis portion of the NodeXL ribbon to open the dialog 
shown in Figure 22.6. This shows a list of all possible metrics that can be calcu-
lated including the centrality metrics described in the prior chapter (e.g., Degree, 
Closeness, Betweenness, and Eigenvector Centrality), Overall Metrics (described in 
the table at the bottom of the dialog), and Group Metrics. For moderately sized net-
works, you can Select All to calculate all of them and then decide which to use later.
The various network metrics are displayed on the appropriate worksheets. For 
example, the centrality metrics, which are calculated for each individual node, are 
displayed on the Vertices worksheet in a set of columns labeled Graph Metrics. 
Likewise, the Group Metrics are displayed on the Groups worksheet. The Overall 
Metrics that describe the entire network graph are displayed on their own Overall 
Metrics worksheet. If Twitter search network top item metrics were calculated (on 
imported Twitter data), they will also show up on their own worksheet.
The meaning of network metrics differs depending on the specific dataset you 
are analyzing. For example, in the Sample Facebook Ego network dataset, the 
­degree centrality metrics (found on the Vertices worksheet) can be interpreted as 
the number of shared friends that the person has with the author. Betweenness 
­centrality helps identify bridge spanners—that is, individuals who uniquely 
­connect to otherwise disconnected groups. For example, Lena has a high between-
ness centrality because she was the only friend connected to work colleagues and 
graduate housing friends.
Sorting by Network Metrics
A useful strategy for identifying the most “important” individuals in the network is to 
use Excel's built-in sort feature. For example, navigate to the Betweenness Centrality 
column on the Vertices worksheet and choose “Sort Largest to Smallest” from the 

244
CHAPTER 22  How to use NodeXL
drop-down menu found within the title cell. This will sort the entire table so that the 
vertices with the highest betweenness centrality will show up at the top of the table 
and those with the lowest will be at the bottom as shown in Figure 22.7. Note that 
eigenvector centrality in NodeXL is calculated as 1/(average shortest distance) so 
that higher numbers indicate that the node is more central to the network (i.e., has a 
shorter average path distance to all other nodes).
VISUALIZING NETWORKS
Networks are complex structures, and to fully understand them, it is often useful to 
visualize them. Network metrics give only a partial picture, just as summary statis-
tics like the average and standard deviation only give a partial picture of a distribu-
tion. Sometimes, a picture really is worth a thousand words—or numbers. NodeXL 
­provides a very sophisticated and highly customizable network visualization toolset 
that is briefly introduced in this section. Features associated with network visualiza-
tion are found in the Graph and Visual Properties sections of the NodeXL menu 
­ribbon and the top of the graph pane itself.
FIGURE 22.6
Graph Metrics dialog after choosing Select All.

245
Visualizing networks
DISPLAYING AND LAYING OUT NETWORKS
To visualize a network in NodeXL, simply click on the Show Graph/Refresh Graph 
button in the NodeXL graph pane or menu ribbon. This will place the vertices on the 
graph pane and show the edges between them. If it is a directed network, such as an 
email network, then it will state that the Type is Directed in the NodeXL ribbon and 
edges will include arrows. If it is an undirected network, such as a Facebook friend 
network, then no arrows will be shown. The network type can be changed at any time 
in the NodeXL ribbon menu.
Individual nodes can be moved by simply clicking and dragging them to a differ-
ent location. Groups of nodes can be selected by drawing a rectangle around them or 
by right-clicking on a node and choosing Select Adjacent Vertices, which will select 
all nodes that are directly connected to the selected node. Groups of selected nodes 
can be moved all at once. When a node is selected in the graph pane, it is highlighted 
in red, and its corresponding data in the Vertices worksheet are also selected. It is 
often useful to fine-tune layouts in order to reduce unnecessary edge crossings or 
nodes that are obscured by other nodes or edges.
Choosing a Layout Algorithm
There are a number of different “layout algorithms” that determine the position of 
nodes on the graph pane. NodeXL allows you to choose which layout algorithm 
to use as shown in Figure 22.8. The first two options are typically best for large 
social ­media datasets (including the Sample Facebook Ego network), though the 
FIGURE 22.7
Sorting on betweenness centrality from largest to smallest to identify bridge spanners.

246
CHAPTER 22  How to use NodeXL
Circle ­layout can also be used effectively at times. The Fruchterman-Reingold layout 
pushes and pulls nodes apart as if they were connected via springs. It is meant to be 
run many times in a row, where each successive run moves the nodes to a better posi-
tion. By default when you Show, Refresh, or Lay Out Again the graph, it will run for 
10 iterations. It is often helpful to click Lay Out Again several times to make sure 
the nodes have settled into a reasonable location. You can also change the default 
number of iterations and the “repulsive force” in the Layout Options dialog that's 
available at the bottom of the drop-down shown in Figure 22.8. The Harel-Koren 
Fast Multiscale algorithm is not iterative. Instead, each time it is run, it will create a 
unique layout, though the overall structure of the network is similar. Try these out on 
the same network and you'll get a feel for their effect. Once you have a layout that 
you're happy with, you can choose None from the layout algorithm drop-down menu. 
That way, if you refresh the graph later, it will not relayout all of the nodes.
Using the Group in a Box Layout
Visualizing large or dense networks can be challenging since they often end up look-
ing like a hairball. To help gain insights into complex networks, it is often useful to 
FIGURE 22.8
Graph pane with the layout algorithm drop-down expanded.

247
Visualizing networks
visualize each connected component (i.e., subnetwork that is not connected to other 
nodes in the network) or cluster of nodes in its own section of the graph pane. This 
is called the “Group in a Box” layout, since it assigns a different group into its own 
box as shown in Figure 22.9, which displays the Sample Facebook Ego network. To 
recreate this layout, choose Layout Options from the layout algorithm drop-down 
menu on the graph pane, which will open up the Layout Options dialog shown on 
the left-hand side of Figure 22.9. Choose “Lay out each of the graph's groups in its 
own box” and check the box that says “Use the Grid layout for groups that don't have 
many edges.” Click OK and refresh the graph to see the changes take effect. Labels 
that have been entered into the Groups worksheet, as shown in Figure 22.9, will now 
appear at the center of each group box. Play around with some of the other options, 
such as the box layout algorithm and intergroup edges in the Layout Options menu 
to see some alternatives.
VISUAL PROPERTIES
Each node and edge has a number of visual properties such as color that can be used 
to create more meaningful and readable network graph visualizations. The available 
visual properties for each edge are found on the Edges worksheet and include Color, 
Width, Style (e.g., solid, dashed, and dotted), Opacity, and Visibility (e.g., if the edge 
is shown at all). Nodes can be styled on the Vertices worksheet by changing their 
color, shape (including geometric shapes and images and labels, which pull image or

label data from other columns), Size, Opacity, and Visibility. The Groups page also 
has columns for Vertex Color, Vertex Shape, Visibility, and Collapse (which will 
combine all nodes in a group into a single large node).
Data can be entered into the visual properties cells in several ways. Some col-
umns such as Shape have a list of preset options that become available in a drop-
down menu once you click inside of a specific cell. To choose a color, click into a 
cell and click on the color picker icon in the Visual Properties section of the NodeXL 
ribbon. After choosing a color, the red, green, and blue values or the official name 
of the color will populate the cell. Notice that tool tips drop-down when the mouse 
hovers in these cells to explain what values are expected in these columns. In addi-
tion to manually selecting values, Excel formulas can also be used. For example, if 
Facebook data is provided on gender in a separate column, a simple If formula could 
be written to change the color of the nodes to differ for males and females. However, 
the easiest way to change visual properties based on other data is to use the NodeXL 
Autofill Columns feature as described below.
Using Autofill Columns
The Autofill Columns feature in NodeXL automatically fills the Visual Properties 
data (or other columns such as Label or Tooltip) based on data stored in some 
other column on the same spreadsheet. To see how this works, click on the Autofill 
Columns button in the NodeXL menu ribbon to open the dialog (Figure 22.10). Next, 
click on the Vertices tab and choose Betweenness Centrality from the drop-down 
menu next to the Vertex Size: row and click Autofill button at the bottom. This will 
make nodes with a higher betweenness centrality a larger size helping to draw visual 
attention to them.
Notice that the Size column on the Vertices worksheet now has been populated 
with values ranging from 10 (for Becket) to 1.5 (for most of the nodes with a rela-
tively small betweenness centrality). By default, a linear mapping is used. In other 
words, the largest betweenness centrality value (43,269) becomes 10, the smallest 
value (0) becomes 1.5, and something right in the middle would be mapped to a size 
right in the middle. As a result, since Becket has such a high betweenness centrality 
compared with the others, his circle becomes large (size 10) and all the others look 
incomparably small.
To create a more meaningful visualization, click on the arrow in the Options 
section (see right-hand side of Figure 22.10) next to the Vertex Size row and choose 
“Vertex Size Options….” This will open up the dialog shown in Figure 22.11, which 
allows you to change how size is impacted by betweenness centrality. Increase 
the maximum vertex size (To this vertex size) to 15 instead of 10. Next, check the 
“Ignore outliers” box. This will make it so that Becket's extremely high between-
ness centrality (considered an outlier) will not be used to determine the size of all 
other nodes. It will be given the maximum size (of 15), but the next nonoutlier score 
(Lena's betweenness centrality of 12,522) will become the new maximum size when 
determining the size of all other nodes. Click OK and the Autofill button and look at 
the Size column on the Vertex worksheet. It should look like the one in Figure 22.12.

CHAPTER 22  How to use NodeXL
Choosing Between Group and Vertex Level Data Sources for Determining 
Vertex Color and Shape
A final warning is in order. As you may remember, both the Vertices worksheet and 
the Groups worksheet have columns that define the Color and Shape of vertices. 
For example, the color on the Vertices worksheet may be based on the gender of the 
person, while the color on the Groups worksheet indicates which group the person 
is a part of. So, which worksheet takes precedence if they indicate different colors? 
The answer is that either one can take precedence, though you'll need to specify 
which one you want using the Group Options, which are available under the Groups 
drop-down menu on the NodeXL ribbon (see Figure 22.13). Simply choose which 
worksheet you want to govern the color and shape of the nodes in the graph pane. In 
Figure 22.13, I have changed the default so they are governed by the Vertices work-
sheet instead of the Groups worksheet.
Filtering Nodes Using the Visibility Column
To create more readable and insightful visualizations, it is important to determine 
which elements to display in a graph. One way to do this in NodeXL is to use the 
Visibility column, which is available on the Edges, Vertices, and Groups worksheets.
The Visibility options on the Vertices worksheet are shown in Figure 22.14. To re-
duce clutter, only nodes with at least one edge connected to them are shown by default 
FIGURE 22.12

with labels.

the Vertices worksheet.

CHAPTER 22  How to use NodeXL
(Show if in an Edge). This excludes any isolated nodes, such as Facebook Friends 
who do not have any connections to any other Friends in the sample ego network 
dataset. These nodes can be shown by typing or selecting “Show” into the Visibility 
column for each of the nodes that have no other connections (see Figure 22.14). 
Sometimes, there are too many nodes in the graph. To remove nodes from the graph 
pane, there are two options. The “Skip” option is typically what is desired. This will 
act as if the node did not exist in the network at all. In fact, if groups or metrics are 
calculated after Skip is selected for certain nodes, those nodes will not be included in 
the groups or metrics calculations. It is as if they were not in the spreadsheet at all. 
They also will not be shown on the graph. Alternatively, the “Hide” option simply 
makes the node (and its associated edges) 100% transparent in the graph pane. The 
layout algorithm, metrics, and groups all act as if it is still there, but it is simply not 
visible.
Though beyond the scope of this brief introduction, readers are encouraged to 
also explore the Dynamic Filters feature, which provides interactive sliders to hide 
certain nodes that do not meet selected criteria. Additionally, note that the Autofill 
Columns feature can be used to automatically set the Visibility column data based on 
some other data (e.g., if degree is below 2, Skip; otherwise, Show).
EXPORTING NETWORK VISUALIZATIONS
To save your network visualization as an image file, simply right-click on the image 
background and select Save Image to File > Save Image. There are Image Options 
available that can determine the size of the image and text for a header and footer. 
Images are best saved in a lossless format such as .png or .gif. The .xps vector format 
is also available, which will scale as large as you need it to. This is recommended for 
high-resolution printing (e.g., posters).
SIMPLIFYING NodeXL WITH AUTOMATE AND “RECIPES”
There are many settings, options, configurations, and adjustments possible in 
NodeXL. Expert users can make use of the many features in the application to 
achieve sophisticated results. But new users often struggle to get similar results. To 
save time for new users, experts can share their settings configurations with other 
users. All configuration changes in NodeXL can be saved and shared.
1.	 Start a new NodeXL session. For example, in Windows 7, click the Start 
button and then All Programs and then scroll down the list from the top until 
you see the NodeXL Excel Template item. Click it and wait until NodeXL is 
loaded; that is, you see the Document Action pane on the right. In Windows 8, 
click Start and type “NodeXL” to search for it.
2.	 Download some data. Select the NodeXL ribbon on the Excel menu's top line; 
then, in the Data section (the first one from the left), click the Import drop-
down, and click on the From Twitter Search network… item in the menu. In the 

253
Visualizing networks
box under “Search for tweets that match this query,” type (say) “your query” 
(without quote marks). If you have a Twitter account but haven't used it in 
NodeXL before, you'll have to select the first radio button under “Your Twitter 
Account” and follow the steps to authorize NodeXL to use your account to 
import Twitter networks. To keep it quick, just leave the other defaults the way 
they are; you can play with them later. Click OK.
3.	 Get a recipe from the NodeXL Graph Gallery. Once you have downloaded 
network data, you have to change various NodeXL settings to fine-tune the 
network graph to get the results you want. An easy alternative way to do this 
is to copy a recipe file from a network graphs saved to the NodeXL Graph 
Gallery. Many of these networks have a link to the recipe used to create them 
(technically referred to as the “NodeXL Options file”). Scroll to the bottom of 
many NodeXL Graph Gallery pages, and click the link “Download the NodeXL 
Options Used to Create the Graph.” Save this to a convenient folder, for 
example, the place where you keep your NodeXL data; you'll now have a file 
there called WorkbookOptions-#####.NodeXLOptions.
4.	 Apply the NodeXL data recipe to your network data. Returning to the 
NodeXL ribbon in Excel, in the Options section, click on Import. This opens 
a file open dialog; navigate to and open the file WorkbookOptions-#####.
NodeXLOptions that you just downloaded.
5.	 Automatically compute metrics and visualize the network graph. Click 
the Automate button in the Graph section on the NodeXL ribbon. (You can 
deselect tasks if you wish by unchecking boxes, and you can change Options 
for those tasks by selecting a task and clicking the Options… button.) Click the 
Run button. (You may get an error message that reads: “This workbook can't 
be saved”; you can avoid it by following the instructions in the dialog box. Just 
click OK for now.)
6.	 Explore the results. The network graph will now be in Document Actions 
pane. If you don't see the pane, you can bring it back by selecting the View 
ribbon in Excel and clicking the Document Actions icon in the Show section. 
Click on the various worksheets to dig into the data that NodeXL has created 
about each edge, vertex, group, and the network as a whole.
7.	 Export to NodeXL Graph Gallery. NodeXL will summarize information 
about the network for you and can export the visualization and report to the 
NodeXL Graph Gallery. Click the Export drop-down in the Data section of 
the NodeXL ribbon and then click on the “To NodeXL Graph Gallery…” 
entry. Select the “I don't have an account” radio button, and provide a guest 
name; for now, just leave the defaults the way they are. (You can create an 
account on http://nodexlgraphgallery.org by clicking on the Create Account 
link in the top left-hand corner.) When Excel's finished churning (uploading 
may take a while; wait for the dialog box to disappear), go to the NodeXL 
Graph Gallery home page http://nodexlgraphgallery.org/Pages/Default.aspx; 
you should see your graph near the top of the page. Click on the thumbnail to 
go to the page.

CHAPTER
255
Beyond the individual
This book has focused on how to find individual people and information about them 
on social media. However, it is worth dedicating one chapter to how social media can 
be used to understand groups of people. That could be organizations, communities, 
or people who share a common trait or demographic attribute.
­
on who or what you are investigating and what you want to know. If an organization 
is the target, like a terrorist group or organized crime syndicate, then any information 
you can find on the group might be useful. You can see how they are using social me­
dia, what their goals are, who participates, where they are posting from, etc. While 
large organizations (like al-Qaeda) may not be targets of investigation by anyone 
outside government groups, law enforcement has successfully used social media to 
investigate street gangs and other small organizations. Law firms have used social 
media to investigate disruptive groups' plan to sue. In these situations, any informa-
tion can potentially be useful.
It may be that an individual person is a target, but you know he or she is an active 
member of an organization or community or a participant in an event. In that case, 
learning about the group the target is part of can help an investigator understand more 
about the target's life and world views. You can learn about the target's motivations, 
interests, activities (through association with group activities), and interactions. You 
­
out to or influence the target.
Finally, when you have an individual target in mind but you do not know much 
about him, it can be helpful to understand information about the demographic groups 
that the target is a member of. These can be broad categories, defined by age or race, 
or more specific categories, like people with the same profession or background. 
The characteristics common to the group may not necessarily describe your target, 
­
to the target.
ORGANIZATIONS
All types of organizations have presences on social media, from small town commu-
nity service groups to international terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda. As we will

CHAPTER 23  Beyond the individual
and groups, investigating the behavior of a group can lead to excellent insights that 
apply to individuals and that often lead to critical information about events. However, 
even when that connection to individually interesting behavior is not there, under-
standing a group that a target is a member of can lead to valuable insights about that 
target.
Note that this chapter is separating out formal organizations, addressed in this 
section, from communities and events that tie people together (discussed in the next 
section). In one sense, it is a somewhat arbitrary distinction. However, the line gener-
ally falls in a way that separates people who identify with a particular organization 
that may have a hierarchy from those who identify with an issue, event, or philosophy. 
Both of these “groupings” are interesting, but the way you approach them can differ.
In particular, when looking at organizations and their members, there may be a 
greater assumption that the actions endorsed or encouraged by the organization will 
be embraced by its members. Therefore, understanding the activities, motivations, 
and online statements of the organization can be valuable background for under-
standing an individual target.
TERRORISTS
Though not everyone might expect it, terrorist groups are extremely active on social 
media. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, online forums, and other social media sites are 
all hosts to terrorist activity.
Gabriel Weimann of the University of Haifa asserts that 90% of organized terror-
ism online is conducted through social media.1 They use it for recruiting, intelligence 
collection, and communication with the general public.
In earlier chapters, we saw examples of people who were investigated for their 
individual terrorist activity. Those people were recruited through the online social 
media activity of terrorist groups.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) created a report in late 2010 ad-
dressing this issue, titled “Terrorist Use of Social Networking Sites: Facebook Case 
Study”. That report was restricted to dissemination among law enforcement, but cop-
ies of it are available online. This chapter relies on a version provided by Public 
Intelligence.2
The report summarizes terrorist use of Facebook as follows:
As part of this trend, jihad supporters and mujahideen are increasingly using 
Facebook, one of the largest, most popular and diverse social networking sites, 
both in the United States and globally, to propagate operational information, 
including IED recipes primarily in Arabic, but in English, Indonesian, Urdu 
and other languages as well. While some tactical information is available on 
Facebook, the majority of extremist use of Facebook focuses on disseminating 
ideological information and exploiting the site as an alternative media outlet for 
terrorist propaganda. However, to a lesser degree, the site is used as a ­gateway 
to radical forums and jihadi sites with explicit radical agendas (and easily 

257
Organizations
­downloadable operational information) and as a platform to promulgate some 
tactical and operational information.
Terrorist Use of Facebook:
•	
As a way to share operational and tactical information, such as bomb 
recipes, AK-47 maintenance and use, tactical shooting, etc.
•	
As a gateway to extremist sites and other online radical content by linking on
Facebook group pages and in discussion forums.
•	
As a media outlet for terrorist propaganda and extremist ideological 
messaging.
•	
As a wealth of information for remote reconnaissance for targeting purposes.
—Department of Homeland Security 
“Terrorist use of Social Networking Sites: 
Facebook Case Study”
For each of the bullet points above, the report goes on to detail how terrorist groups 
are using the site. The report even appears to contain screenshots of some of their 
posts. Figure 23.1 shows an example post with instructions on how to make a bomb.
This report, from 2010, came quite early in the timeline of online social networks; 
Facebook was around one-third of its current size at that time. As social media has 
grown in popularity, so has terrorists' use of the sites. As described in the 2010 DHS 
report, that activity is largely used for outreach and propaganda and often appears in 
English to reach Western audiences.
FIGURE 23.1
This Facebook screenshot is reported by Fox News to have come from a Department of 
Homeland Security report on terrorist use of Facebook. The post describes how to make a bomb.

258
CHAPTER 23  Beyond the individual
Many major international terrorist groups have social media accounts, includ-
ing al-Qaeda, ISIS, and the Taliban. Boko Haram, the Nigerian terrorist group well 
known for kidnapping over 200 school girls,3 makes extensive use of YouTube to post 
videos of propaganda messages and even videos of mass executions (Figure 23.2).
As another example, the Taliban was active on Twitter from 2011 on. Figure 23.3 
shows screenshot of their Twitter feed from May of 2014. Note that it is in English.
FIGURE 23.2

FIGURE 23.3

259
Organizations
You can see that each post has a link at the end to a news story. These link to the 
Taliban's English website, also used for propaganda. Figure 23.4 shows the top of the 
main page of the Taliban's website, which features strongly in their social media presence.
The Taliban's Twitter feed has since been shut down, and this is a common back-
and-forth battle between terrorist groups and social media sites. The social media 
sites have policies against much of the language and intention that terrorist groups 
use. Thus, they eventually find the accounts of the terrorist groups and shut them 
down, but new accounts pop up.
And while the contents of these accounts are often disturbing, understanding the 
propaganda and messaging terrorist groups are putting out can be an excellent way to 
understand the group's (and thus its members') motivation and activities.
STREET GANGS
Street gangs also have a strong presence online, and indeed, a lot of interaction be-
tween rival gangs takes place online. In 2013, Ben Austin wrote an excellent article 
for Wired, “Public Enemies: Social Media Is Fueling Gang Wars in Chicago.”4 He 
describes the violence that has overtaken Chicago in the past few years ­resulting 
FIGURE 23.4

260
CHAPTER 23  Beyond the individual
from the fractious street gang environment. He explains, through extensive ex-
amples, how gangs interact with one another and with rivals. With examples from 
Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, he explains how gang members post photos of 
themselves with guns, drugs, and cash, unconcerned about whether parents, teachers, 
or police see the posts. The term “Facebook driller,” describing a gang member who 
starts problems with rivals online, is not just introduced but demonstrated through 
examples that sometimes lead to real killings.
Austin's article is extensive and so thorough that I would like to reprint the whole 
thing here. Short of that, here is one excerpt that shows the role social media plays 
through one specific example:
Increasingly, disagreements that end in bloodshed have their origins online. 
The Chicago police department, which now patrols social media along with the 
streets, estimates that an astonishing 80 percent of all school disturbances result 
from online exchanges. At one point on Morgan Street, a 15-year-old joins us at 
the stone table. He calls himself Boss Nick, and he says he regularly posts pictures 
to Instagram of himself with guns. He doesn't care if the police or his teachers or 
really anyone sees it. He feels he has to let rivals know he is out there “with these 
poles.” Boss Nick had been friends with Shondale Gregory, known as Tooka, a 
15-year-old killed in 2011. Gregory was shot in the head, and rivals soon posted 
pictures of his corpse to Facebook, doctoring the image with horns and splattered 
brains. The Chicago police said that within minutes of the images' appearing on 
the site, 81 kids at Gregory's high school were suspended for fighting and an ad-
ditional 200 students walked out. Gregory's clique of Gangster Disciples, which 
had called itself the St. Lawrence Boys for their block on the South Side, started 
referring to their turf as Tookaville and to themselves as the Tooka Gang.
“All that 'cause of Facebook,” Baskin's 20-year-old grandson says. “That's why 
Tooka blew up.”
—Ben Austin from 
“Public Enemies: Social Media  
Is Fueling Gang Wars in Chicago”
Police have embraced this kind of investigation. Particularly for street gangs, 
investigating the entire group often leads to the arrests of individuals because of their 
participation. Consider one example from New York. Police arrested Melvin Colin 
for weapons and drug crimes and for murder. His Facebook page had some public 
material, but in his posts that were restricted to his friends only, he made many in-
criminating statements. Police were able to convince one of Colin's friends to give 
them access to those private posts.
Colin's lawyers appealed this, claiming he had an expectation of privacy, but the 
courts struck down that argument. The judge ruled that once Colin shared with his 
friends, the expectation that the information would remain private disappeared since 
the friends could do anything they wanted with the posts—including sharing them 
with police.5

261
Communities and events
Cincinnati also uses social media to track gang activity and has used it to break 
up street gangs. Officials there report that their officers, in partnership with the 
University of Cincinnati, use the social media posts to create and maintain a database 
of gang members and activities that officers can use in their investigations.6
COMMUNITIES AND EVENTS
As discussed in the chapter on “Forums and Question Answering Sites,” many online 
communities find gathering places to discuss their activities. These communities may 
be in forums, but they can also coalesce around hashtags within certain social media 
sites. For example, many conferences and conventions have an agreed upon hashtag 
that people use when they tweet about the event. At ComicCon, an entertainment fan 
convention, people tweet with the hashtag #comicon or #sdcc. Communities may also 
have a hashtag they use to identify their social media posts, regardless of whether 
there is an event. For example, politically conservative Twitter users in the United 
States often use the hashtag #tcot (Top Conservatives on Twitter) to label their posts.
As with organizations, it can be useful to analyze what is going on within a com-
munity or around an event within social media. The content of the posts tells you 
what topics are of interest to the group, what is going on, what plans are being made, 
etc. The people within the groups and how they interact can tell you who is important 
and what role they play.
Recall the chapter on “Analyzing Networks” where we created visualizations of 
social networks. We can apply those techniques in this domain. Figure 23.5 shows a 
visualization of an online community. Each circle represents one person in the net-
work, and a line connecting two circles shows those two people have interacted. In 
this visualization, larger circles indicate people who are more important in the com-
munity. The color of the circles indicates different subgroups.
Without a lot of other data, we can see there are three people who are quite im-
portant, represented by three large circles in the middle of the image (two purple ones 
and one green one). We can also see small pairs of people off to the sides who do not 
interact with everyone else. This kind of information can be very helpful when you 
are looking at a community online and want to learn more about who is important 
and who might be a good person to talk to in order to find more information.
One example of how some communities are monitored comes from the Southern 
Poverty Law Center, or SPLC. The SPLC is a civil rights organization, founded in 
1971 as a law firm. The group sues on behalf of victims of hate crime and is noted for 
its success in battling white supremacist groups including the Ku Klux Klan.
As part of their activities, they monitor hate groups around the country for all 
kinds of activity. These groups leverage the internet as much as anyone, and so SPLC 
monitors the online and social media activity of hate groups.
In the realm of white supremacy, that includes monitoring the online forum 
Stormfront (see Figure 23.6). Ku Klux Klan leader Don Black established the site in 
1995, and it is the first and one of the largest racial hate sites online.

262
CHAPTER 23  Beyond the individual
SPLC's Intelligence Report on the users is disturbing. They found that the site is a 
home for perpetrators of violent hate crimes. Author Heidi Beirich said “Stormfront 
is the murder capital of the racist internet.”7 Members of Stormfront were responsible 
for nearly 100 murders since 2009, and SPLC saw a marked increase in violence 
after Barak Obama took office as President.
The report8 both profiles the killers and details many of their crimes. They begin 
with a general description of the Stormfront users who go on to kill:
A typical murderer drawn to the racist forum Stormfront.org is a frustrated, un-
employed, white adult male living with his mother or an estranged spouse or 
girlfriend. She is the sole provider in the household. Forensic psychologists call 
him a “wound collector.” Instead of building his resume, seeking employment or 
further education, he projects his grievances on society and searches the internet 
for an excuse or an explanation unrelated to his behavior or the choices he has 
made in life.
—“White Homicide Worldwide” Southern Poverty Law Center
It goes on to detail the progression from frustration to committing acts of violence 
as it plays out within the Stormfront site. It then looks at case after case of racially

and lines connecting circles indicate two people who have interacted.

motivated murders committed by members of the site and details their participation 
on the site leading up to their crimes.
As disturbing as the contents are, the report is an excellent example of the value 
that comes from close monitoring of a community online. The authors track not just 
the content of posts, but the traffic rates to the site (which allows them to identify 
peaks of activity, like the one that followed in the immediate aftermath of the 2011 
white supremacist mass killings in Oslo9), topics discussed, the relationship between 
discussions and other current events, and individual members of the site.

CHAPTER 23  Beyond the individual
DEMOGRAPHICS AND SHARED TRAITS
Another way to look at groups in social media is to study the use, habits, and feel-
ings of certain demographics. That will not necessarily tell you how your target 
will behave, since these tend to be broad groups with a lot of diversity within them. 
However, understanding common behavior for a demographic group may be use-
ful in guiding your investigation. For example, we know that African Americans 
are disproportionately active on Twitter. Thus, if you are trying to find someone 
online in that group, Twitter may be a good place to start. As another example, we 
know teens use a variety of social media but have especially embraced Instagram. 
Thus, if you have a teen target, you will certainly want to look at all social media 
sources, but you might first turn your attention to Instagram where you could find 
richer information.
In this section, we will look at three groups: teens as a representative of an age-
based demographics, African Americans as a race-based demographic, and family 
caregivers as a behavior-based demographic. These results are drawn from studies 
conducted by the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project,10 which 
focuses heavily on obtaining balanced and representative samples of people to con-
duct their research.
TEENS
Teens are very active users of social media. This data is drawn from an extensive 
report from Pew Research Center about teens, social media, and privacy.11
Among 12-17-year-olds, 95% use the internet, and among those, 80% are on so-
cial media. Facebook is the most popular site, used by 77% of teens who are online. 
A typical teen has about 300 friends on Facebook. Twitter is also popular, with 24% 
of online teens using it, and the median number of followers is 74.
Teens who are very active on Facebook tend also to be active on other social me-
dia sites. Those who have more than 600 Facebook friends are three times as likely 
to have a Twitter account and six times as likely to use Instagram. That means that if 
you have a teen target who is very active on Facebook, you should look for them on 
other sites as well.
Teen users share a lot of personal information. The vast majority (91%) have 
posted photos of themselves. Sharing a school and hometown is also extremely com-
mon (71% of teens have done these things). More than half share an email address, 
which can be used to search for them on other sites and which may reveal a possible 
username to search on other sites.
At the same time, teens are also concerned about privacy settings. Only 14% 
say their profiles are totally public. The rest have their profiles restricted to friends 
only or to friends of friends. Girls are much more likely to keep their profiles pri-
vate than boys (70% vs. 50%). Some also try to mislead people with fake informa-
tion to protect their privacy; 26% say they have posted some fake information for 
this purpose.

Communities and events
AFRICAN AMERICANS
Pew Research Center has also conducted research on racial demographic groups and 
their use of social media. In this section, we look at results from a study on African 
American users.12
The “digital divide” between black and white users has been with us for decades, 
and while it still exists, it is less prevalent on social media platforms. 87% of whites 
have internet access compared to 80% of blacks, but the numbers are much closer on 
mobile platforms, which are particularly popular ways to access social media. The 
divide vanishes with education; black college graduates and higher-income African 
Americans have the same level of internet access as their white counterparts.
African Americans have high levels of social media use; 73% use social media, 
and that jumps to 96% among teens (much higher than the overall average discussed 
in the section above). Twitter is especially popular. Among 18-29-year-old African 
Americans, 40% use Twitter, much higher than their white counterparts (28%).
Focusing on teens in this group, there are differences that emerge in social me-
dia usage. As mentioned above, many teens post false information to protect their 
privacy. This behavior is more prevalent among African American teens. Compared 
to 26% of teens overall who have posted false information, black teens are far more 
likely to do this, with 39% claiming to have done so. Black teens are less likely to 
disclose their real names on their social media profiles; 95% of white teens use their 
real names, while only 77% of black teens do.
FAMILY CAREGIVERS
In contrast to the more traditional demographic groups discussed above, in this section, 
we will focus on a behavior-based demographic group: family caregivers. This is one ex-
ample of the wide range of behavior-based demographics who use social media in similar 
ways. Family caregivers are adults who help care for a loved one by doing chores, offering 
personal care, tending to finances, or regularly checking. Note that this demographic does 
not include parents raising children as caregivers. The majority of caregivers are taking 
care of an adult, while a small percentage take care of a child with significant health issues 
or care for multiple people. A full 30% of Americans qualify as caregivers. Information 
in this section comes from a Pew Research Center study on this group and internet use.13
We see typical internet access rates among this group, with 80% having access 
to the internet. They have a strong and active interest in medical information—88% 
report looking for this online, and many are conducting these searches on behalf of 
someone else. In terms of investigation, this does not speak directly to social media 
usage, but it might direct you to look at forums and online interest groups related to 
health issues if your target falls in this group.
Caregivers tend to look for personal connections online regarding health issues. 
Pew Research Center reports that 26% have looked for others with similar health 
concerns online, compared to 15% of people who are not caregivers. Caregivers are 
also significantly more likely to use social media sites in particular to follow other's 
health experience and to look for health information in general.

CHAPTER 23  Beyond the individual
CONCLUSIONS
There is a lot of information available on social media to better understand organi-
zations and communities of people. Similarly, there is excellent research done on 
how different demographic and interest groups use social media sites. Learning these 
insights about groups of people may not reveal exactly what a specific investigation 
target is doing, but it can provide valuable insight into where that target might be 
found online, how he or she is using social media as a member of that group, and 
what topics and activities are of interest. In addition, we saw in some cases that in-
vestigation of groups online can also lead to valuable intelligence about individuals 
within those groups who late become interesting.

Inferring traits from 
profiles
The technology to do everything in this chapter already exists. Most of it is in the 
hands of lab researchers, and not available for commercial use. However, it is likely 
to become available in the very near future, and it will have a profound impact on the

So far, we have looked at what people are sharing on social media, what they say 
about themselves, who they interact with, where they post from, and what is reflected 
in their posts.
­
including information they would prefer to keep private. This information is dis-
covered using advanced computer programs or algorithms, which examine the huge 
amounts of data people share online and look for subtle patterns within it. From that, 
they are able to predict or infer a wide range of personal attributes (including things 
like sexual orientation, personality traits, drug and alcohol use, and political lean-
ings). In some instances, they can even predict a person's future behavior.
This chapter will describe some of the work happening in this area and insights 
that may come within reach in the future.

TWITTER
Twitter is a great source of information for computer programs, because almost all 
of its data is public. Furthermore, most of it is text—and computer scientists know a 
lot about how to analyze texts.
­
The little words we use, which we could often dismiss as meaningless, are chosen 
unconsciously. Our unconscious choices reveal information about how our mind 
works. Research has shown that these words, called “particles”—which include pro-
nouns (“you,” “I,” and “we”), prepositions, articles, and auxiliary verbs (“could,” 
­
state, and social identity.1
Computer scientists can use this by grouping words into categories and then ana-
lyzing people's social media posts to find connections between the word categories 
and individual traits. The analysis starts with a long list of words and each word's 
24

268
CHAPTER 24  Inferring traits from profiles
­category. This is fed into an algorithm, along with a file that has text a person has 
written online; it could be, for example, a bunch of a person's tweets. The algorithm 
then compares that text to the lists of words and outputs a report. The report can then 
be used in statistical analysis to find connections between word use and personal 
attributes.
Here are some examples:
•	
As people get older, they tend to use more positive emotion words (like “happy” 
or “joy”), more future tense verbs, and fewer past tense verbs.
•	
Men tend to curse far more than women.
•	
People who rate higher in neuroticism (indicating they are less emotionally 
stable) tend to use more anxiety words (like “worry”).
•	
Agreeable people tend to use more positive emotion words.
•	
People who are anxious use more explainer words (like “because” and “since”).
The list goes on and on.
On Twitter, this kind of analysis has been used to predict social media users' big 
five personality traits.2 The traits include
•	
whether someone is extroverted or introverted,
•	
their openness to new experiences,
•	
how conscientious they are (which deals with planning or procrastination),
•	
how agreeable they are, and
•	
their emotional stability (neuroticism).
Algorithms have been able to guess a person's scores on a big five personality 
test with accuracy of close to 90%. Similar techniques have been used to measure the 
strength of people's interpersonal relationships, too.3
TOOL: ANALYZEWORDS
Most of the computer programs that discover people's personality traits from so-
cial media only exist within the research community and aren't public available. 
However, there is one online tool you can use to analyze someone's Twitter personal-
ity right now. It's called AnalyzeWords, and you can find it at http://analyzewords.
com. Enter your (or anyone else's) Twitter handle, and see a report of some high-level 
personality traits.
As an example, here are analyses of two Twitter accounts from AnalyzeWords: 
the author's account, and President Obama's account (Figures 24.1 and 24.2).
FACEBOOK
Because people share so much information on Facebook, there are numerous algo-
rithms that use its data to infer user traits. None of these tools are currently available 
for public use. We will look at two studies that highlight the breadth and depth of 
information that such tools can uncover from Facebook.

CHAPTER 24  Inferring traits from profiles
FACEBOOK LIKES
One of the studies that cover the widest range of traits is one that started with a nar-
row set of data: Facebook likes.4 From this data, researchers attempted to predict 
dozens of personal traits, including race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, intel-
ligence, personality, and even whether someone has used drugs and alcohol. They 
were able to guess all of these things (and more) just by looking at the Facebook 
pages a person liked. This works because, among the tens of thousands of people 
they analyzed, subtle patterns emerge in likes.
The liked pages may have nothing to do with the attribute they help reveal. For 
example, one of the top predictors of high intelligence was liking the Facebook page 
for “Curly Fries.” The reason the algorithms work anyway relies on advanced pat-
terns and analysis of how the likes spread through networks, the nature of people's 
social structures, and other attributes shared by the analyzed persons. From the out-
side, this research certainly seems mysterious. But when working with very large 
data, statistics can uncover many unexpected things.
ANALYZING SIGNIFICANT OTHERS
A different study used only the social network of a user, ignoring likes and all other 
profile information. The original goal of this study was to figure out which person 
among all of a user's friends was that user's spouse or significant other.5
A first guess at how to do this might be to find the person who had the most 
friends in common with the user. However, it turns out that a better indicator is find-
ing the person who knows people from the greatest number of the user's different 
social circles. Recall the chapter on network analysis that showed different clusters 
of friends. Ideally, someone's spouse will know people from many different groups; 
for example, they will know at least one high school friend, college friend, coworker, 
family member, teammate, etc.
This turned out to be a very good predictor of someone's significant other. 
However, when the algorithm was wrong, an even more interesting result came 
about. Researchers went back two months later to look at the people for whom they 
had guessed incorrectly. In those cases where the algorithm was wrong, people were 
50% more likely to have broken off their relationships.
Not only did a person's social network often reveal who their partner was, but also 
it gave hints about whether their current relationship would last.
SEXUAL ORIENTATION
A person's social network, when combined with a bit of additional information, can 
also be revealing. One of the earliest studies in this area actually began as a class 
project at MIT. Students analyzed people's Facebook friends with the goal of deter-
mining their sexual orientation. Their project, called Gaydar, looked at what percent-
age of a person's friends self-identified as gay on Facebook (recall that a Facebook 
profile has a section where people can indicate their orientation). They found that, 

271
Conclusions
for men, they could draw a line regarding a percentage of gay friends. If someone 
had a higher percentage of gay friends, there was a good chance they were gay, too.
This relies on a principle we all know, often stated as “birds of a feather flock 
together.” People tend to be friends with people who are similar to them more than 
would be expected if they chose friends randomly. This applies to not only sexual ori-
entation but also wealth, education level, race, politics, and many other traits. While 
projects like Gaydar are not online, this insight can be useful in an investigation. If 
you find someone has, for example, many politically conservative friends, it would 
be logical to guess that they, too, might be conservative.
OFFLINE
Obviously, this book is concerned with social media, but these same techniques are 
being used offline. One example worth mentioning comes from big-box retailer 
Target.6 In 2012, The New York Times reported a story of a 15-year-old girl who re-
ceived coupons for baby items like diapers and bottles in a flyer sent by Target. Her 
father was very upset by this until two weeks later when his high school daughter told 
him she was indeed pregnant. Target found out before her parents did.
How did they do this? By analyzing her purchases. Target calculates a score for 
their female customers that not only guesses whether or not they are pregnant but 
also even attempts to pinpoint their due dates. They do this through analyzing pat-
terns in what people buy.
As with some of the examples above, the patterns are not obvious ones. To find 
out someone is pregnant, it is not the purchase of a pregnancy test or of baby items 
that reveals it most clearly. Instead, strong indicators are things like buying more 
vitamins than normal, buying a large handbag, or buying a brightly colored rug.
If you saw those purchases in the checkout line ahead of you, it is unlikely that 
you would guess the woman buying them was pregnant. However, when considered 
in the context of data from tens of thousands of other customers, they happen to re-
veal a common attribute.
Target isn't the only company doing this kind of analysis, but this example reveals 
the kind of power that comes from analyzing the vast amounts of data in this digital age.
CONCLUSIONS
Computer scientists are actively developing technology that reveals all kinds of se-
crets about social media users. Although people say a lot online, there are things they 
want to keep secret, and that's becoming harder to do. From personalities to basic 
demographic information, a lot comes through in subtle or unconscious ways. When 
data from millions of people can be analyzed, statistical analysis and advanced com-
putational techniques can detect patterns that indicate that a person has a particular 
attribute.

272
CHAPTER 24  Inferring traits from profiles
While most of this technology is not yet available to the public, it is coming in the 
next five to ten years. Some tools, like AnalyzeWords, are already available online. 
Technologies like this will become an increasingly important tool for social media 
investigation.

CHAPTER
273
An Example Investigation
Many of the investigation stories in this book are relatively simple: A target uses one 
social media site, and an investigator collects information through that site. With 
large sites like Facebook and Twitter, there is often a good chance a target will have 
an account, so this is a good strategy.
­
chapter, we will examine one such case. This is a step-by-step description of an ac-
tual investigation that I was asked to do. I am anonymizing the identity of the target 
­
is intended to demonstrate the investigative process, including all the dead ends that 
led to the final insights.
THE TARGET
The target of this investigation, whom I will call “June Collins,” is a woman who has 
an unhealthy interest (perhaps obsession) for a classic rock band. Her interest was 
especially focused around one band member in particular, whom I will call “Dan.”
June maintains Facebook tribute pages to Dan. She travels around the country to 
see Dan's band and always has pictures taken with them. She also sends Dan emails 
and gifts. But it was when she showed Dan pictures she had taken of his house—
a few hundred miles from where she lives—that she was brought to my attention. 
Dan was concerned that June's interest had escalated to a level where she might be 
dangerous.
­
INITIAL INFORMATION
The initial information I had for June included some screenshots of discussions she 
participated in, from her Facebook tribute page to Dan. In the discussions, she would 
occasionally post angry rants about other women who had an interest in Dan, espe-
cially if they posted a comment she disapproved of. She actively banned people from 
­
Her true name was very common, so simply searching for her on the web was 
not likely to return good results. She also appeared to have several fake accounts that

274
CHAPTER 25  An Example Investigation
she used to post. The language used in the rants from these fake accounts was very 
similar to the language in June's own posts. Also, June's profile picture was a photo 
of her and Dan together, while the fake accounts' profile photos were beach scenes; 
no actual person was shown. While this is not evidence of anything by itself, it might 
suggest that someone did not have a personal profile photo to upload.
THE INVESTIGATION
Facebook, Part I: Finding an “In”
I began by visiting the Facebook fan page for Dan. Since the fan page was public, 
I found a few posts by June. These linked back to her Facebook profile page. She had 
her privacy settings turned on quite high, so I could not find any information about 
her from her page. In fact, I could not even send her a friend request, since we did not 
have any friends in common. (This is a Facebook setting people can choose to protect 
themselves from “spam” friend requests.)
I decided to start by sending friend requests to active members of the fan page. 
I assumed that some of them would be friends with June, which thus allows me to 
send her a friend request. I became a fan of Dan's page myself and sent the friend re-
quests. I did not include any messages with these requests; there was no deception. I 
simply befriended people who actively posted in the community, particularly people 
who had liked or commented on things June had posted.
Within an hour, one member had accepted my friend request. He was friends with 
June, so I could now send June a friend request. This would show up as a request 
from someone who had a friend in common with her.
Other Social Networks, Part I
While I waited for her to respond to my request, I began searching for her in a num-
ber of different ways on the web.
I started with her Facebook username, which was something like June.col-
lins.4121. However, this did not turn up anything outside of Facebook. I also saved 
a copy of her Facebook profile picture and did a Google image search for matching 
pictures, in case she had used it on other profiles. However, that returned no results 
either. I searched for forums or forum posts centered around Dan's career, hoping to 
find posts by June. No luck.
I went to both Twitter and Pinterest and searched for her by name. Since I had 
a photo of her from Facebook, I hoped I would be able to identify her visually in a 
profile picture. This did not turn up any accounts that I could identify. I also searched 
on Pinterest for boards dedicated to Dan, thinking she might have maintained one of 
these, but there were not any. I even looked at photos of Dan posted on Pinterest, but 
there were not too many. I was able to check out each one and confirm that, as far as 
I could tell, it had not been posted by June.
On LinkedIn, there were over 350 people with June's name. I went through the 
list by hand, looking for people in her known home state of North Carolina. I found 
one woman who did not have a profile photo. She was a fourth grade teacher. I then 

275
The background
searched for her and the name of her school. This Google search eventually leads to 
a Facebook page for her church that, in turn, linked to her Facebook profile. It was 
not the June I was looking for. I went through a few more dead ends before hitting 
page 8 of the search results, where I found a profile with her photo on it. It was the 
same person in the Facebook photo.
Unfortunately, this page did not provide much more information. She listed no 
places of employment, and her connections were not visible. All that showed were 
interests in freelance writing and photography. Using a nonpersonal account, I sent 
her a LinkedIn connection request.
Other Social Networks, Part II: First Success
However, since she had a different profile photo on LinkedIn than she had on 
Facebook, I did another Google image search for photos. This time, I looked for 
those that matched her LinkedIn picture.
I was rewarded with four hits, all on the internet forum “Find A Grave.” This site 
is dedicated to locating grave sites of celebrities and people's ancestors. The first 
hit was for June's profile page on this forum. It included a rambling and somewhat 
patronizing message, instructing people on what was “respectful and appropriate,” 
which was very much in line with her tone on Facebook.
The site provided a list of her ancestors and links to many pages she created and 
maintained, which described the graves of her relatives. The comments on her profile 
page also indicated that she has asked several people to transfer control to her for 
pages that they had created for graves of her relatives.
This was actually an important insight, even though it did not have anything to do 
with Dan. The fact that she used a condescending, demanding tone in her posts and 
that she overreached her bounds in a need to control things on this grave-oriented 
website indicated that her behavior was typical of her personality and not restricted 
to her interest in Dan (Figure 25.1).
June did have a username on Find A Grave that was not simply her name. 
Unfortunately, this name was also extremely common—something many different 
people would use across sites. Still, I tried searching for the username along with 
Dan's name and his band's name on Google, but there were no promising results.
Facebook, Part II: Fake Accounts and Friends
Back on Facebook, I looked for a couple of the fake accounts that Dan suspected 
June of maintaining. One had disappeared, but one was still active. Using the screen 
grabs, I was able to match photos from the deleted account with photos on the ac-
tive fake account. Both used the same beach scene on their profile pages. Again, 
while this is not necessarily evidence of anything, it suggested a possible connection 
between the two pages. I checked to see if the active fake account was friends with 
June, but I could not see a connection there (possibly because there was none or pos-
sibly because of June's privacy settings).
By this point, June had logged on and accepted my friend request. Now, I could 
see all her posts, photos, and profile information. Browsing through her photos and 

276
CHAPTER 25  An Example Investigation
status updates, it became clear that she was obviously a serious fan of Dan and his 
band, but she also mentioned other bands. She also mentioned her interest in tracking 
down the grave sites of famous actors and her family members, echoing what I found 
on the Find A Grave forum.
Facebook, Part III: Findings
About half her posts detailed her trips to see Dan's band or other bands perform. She 
talked about breaking down in her car when she heard one band member was retir-
ing. The other half of her posts were both melancholy and somewhat self-righteous. 
Examples include
•	
“How frustrating it is when you're the only person who can see how evil and 
sneaky someone is and everyone else is blind to it,”
•	
“Sometimes it's better to be alone nobody can hurt you,” and
•	
“A successful woman is one who can build a firm foundation with the bricks 
others have thrown at her.”
Her profile included links to her Twitter and YouTube pages. Her YouTube chan-
nel was dedicated to a totally different artist, featuring tributes to him and videos of 
him performing.
FIGURE 25.1

their grave sites.

277
Investigation results
Her Twitter handle included Dan's last name in it, but her tweets were protected. 
I sent a follow request to her from the Twitter account that matched the Facebook ac-
count she had already approved. To gain her trust through mutual interests, I tweeted 
a link to a video from Dan's band, so she would see it if she checked out my profile.
Other Social Networks, Part III
As I waited to see if she would respond, I used her Twitter handle as a username in 
another Google search. This username was more unique. It turned up June's Pinterest 
account (with her real name attached to that Twitter handle). The account had only 
one photo posted, and it was of a band in the same genre of Dan's band (but not Dan's 
band itself).
It also turned up a single post on the weight loss site MyFitnessPal, which did not 
have anything to do with Dan.
At this point, I had a pretty clear picture of June's activities. She had not replied 
to my requests to connect on LinkedIn or Twitter, but I felt like the other sources had 
provided enough background to draw my conclusions.
INVESTIGATION RESULTS
After reviewing all the information available about June on Facebook, Twitter, 
YouTube, LinkedIn, and the forum site Find A Grave, I was able to draw a few con-
clusions about June.
First, she ties a lot of her identity into her fandom for bands in general and Dan's 
band in particular. She is definitely a big fan of Dan himself as well. She follows the 
band around the country and posts about them frequently on a number of platforms. 
However, Dan (and his band) is not her only focus; she talks about other bands and 
maintains fan pages for them, too.
She is also a lonely person who does not seem to be happy with her life. She does 
not have a career, and her posts suggest she is divorced and unhappy being single. 
She gets angry with people for perceived small slights and responds with long, angry 
rants and often completely cuts these people out of her social media life. Many of her 
posts are preemptively defensive, warning people about the potential consequences 
if they get in her way. Yet, she has no power to actually do anything to anyone who 
“crosses” her, except to block them.
Taken together, it seems that June's few interests form the core of her personal 
identity. Her confidence is low, and she holds on to these interests with fierce inten-
sity. At the same time, it seems that she has never done anything to anyone who hurt 
her except to complain about it or hide from them.
In addition, she had interests beyond Dan and did not post anything especially 
creepy about him. Her enthusiasm seemed unhealthy, but not dangerous. Thus, as a 
result of the investigation, I reported back to Dan that nothing on social media indi-
cated he had to worry about June.

CONCLUSION
This investigative process is typical of what I do when I'm looking for information 
about someone online. It shows the different types of social media to look at, the vari-
ous and repeated Google searches for profile photos and usernames that can turn up 
previously undiscovered accounts, and techniques for gaining access to information 
restricted to a person's online friends.
Not all the techniques will be right for every investigation. In particular, you may 
have rules that prohibit you from friending people from fake accounts. However, 
most of what I did here required no interaction with the target. It is also important 
to recognize that many searches I did failed to find any useful information. That is 
typical of these searches—though usually, as in this case, you will eventually turn up 
information on someone who is active online.
