10    /    INTRODUCTION
The step up to a managerial role  
can be an exciting, but daunting,  
new challenge. Suddenly, you are 
responsible for making sure your 
team is working together, achieving 
results, and that overall your 
department is running smoothly. 
There is no single technique to 
becoming an excellent manager, but 
the Essential Manager’s Handbook 
provides indispensable advice on  
six of the key areas of management.
Lead your team
Managing People is essential to 
building a high-performing team, 
and in this section you will learn  
how to attain this goal. A successful 
manager must learn to set targets, 
plan work, delegate tasks, motivate 
employees, appraise performance, 
and solve problems. Managing 
people is a dynamic process that  
is always evolving to reflect the 
complex workspace, but by learning 
the core skills outlined in this 
section, you will be well prepared  
to accommodate future change.  
To run your team successfully, it is 
critical to be seen as a good leader. 
Leadership is the ability to create  
an environment where each 
individual feels totally committed  
to doing a great job. This section 
provides practical advice to help you 
to develop your leadership skills, 
allowing you to realize both your 
own and your team’s full potential.
Achieve your potential
Achieving this potential occurs 
through a combination of becoming 
more creative and confident, and 
improving your communication 
skills. In Achieving High 
Performance, you will be given the 
tools to understand yourself, and 
learn how to play to your strengths 
and overcome your weaknesses. The 
Effective Communication section of 
this book focuses on a wide range  
of topics, from planning a strategy  
to analyzing your audience, and will 
allow you to learn to communicate 
and listen well, both to your team 
and to your intended market. 
Improve your business skills
A good manager also needs to  
be a successful presenter, as 
presentations have become an 
essential tool for business 
communication around the 
world. Whether you are 
delivering a formal speech, 
giving an informal address to 
your staff, or communicating 
with the media, the elements

of great presentations are described 
in the Presenting section in clear, 
concise, and practical detail. 
Negotiating is challenging, complex, 
and exciting, and another important 
skill that all managers should 
master. This section outlines various 
techniques that can help to make 
you a more successful negotiator  
in every situation you face; from 
teaching you how to manage your 
own emotions, to understanding 
your negotiation style. 
Throughout this book, there are 
many features aimed at helping  
you to learn the essentials of being 
a manager quickly and efficiently. 
“Ask Yourself” boxes allow you to 
review your situation and assess 
how you can improve your skills, 
while “Tip” boxes provide expert 
advice. Case studies demonstrate 
real-life examples for you to  
learn from, and “Do’s and Don’ts” 
boxes provide at-a-glance advice  
on key topics.


MANAGING 
PEOPLE

Knowing yourself will give you valuable insights 
into your aptitude for managing others. It allows 
you to understand how you’re perceived by 
others, why they respond to you in the way  
they do, and how to get the best from them.

Developing self-awareness
Keeping moving
The best way to enhance your self-
awareness is to learn in a systematic 
way from your own experiences. Start 
by reflecting on situations in your 
working life, your actions in response  
to them, and the outcomes of these 
events. Schedule a regular time to do 
this, either at the beginning or end of a 
workday, when you are not in the thick 
of the action. Give yourself space to 
reflect, and make sure you can be alone 
and uninterrupted for a significant 
period of time. Try to gain a better 
understanding of what happened  
and think about how you can learn  
from each situation. 
Analyzing your performance
Assessing your progress toward  
your goals can help you gain a fuller 
understanding of your strengths and 
weaknesses. Whenever you make a key 
decision or take a key action, write down 
what you expect will happen. Then, every 
three or four months, compare the actual 
results with your expectations. If you 
practice this method consistently, it will 
help you discover what you are doing,  
or failing to do, that deprives you of the 
full benefits of your strengths, and will 
demonstrate areas in which you are  
not particularly competent and cannot 
perform adequately. 
Awareness of your emotions, personality, what you enjoy and dislike, 
what motivates you, and what comes easily or poses challenges is a key 
precursor to developing effective managerial ability. Quite simply, if  
you can’t manage yourself, you will not be able to manage anyone else.
MAKE NOTES
Use your journal to “think on 
paper” about what you have 
read about management in 
this or other books, or your 
experiences in management 
training programs.
Tip
Take time to reflect on 
situations in your working 
life, your actions in 
response to them, and the 
outcomes of these events 

DEVELOPING SELF-AWARENESS   /    17
Keeping a journal
Keeping a journal is a good way to help you 
learn from experience. Journals are similar to 
diaries, but include entries that address critical 
aspects of your managerial experiences and 
reflect on interactions with bosses, employees, 
and team-mates. If you want to solicit feedback, 
post your journal as an online blog.
Journal entries could describe: 
A good (or bad) way someone  
handled a situation
A problem in the  
making
 The different ways people  
react to situations
 Comments about insightful  
or interesting quotations
 Anecdotes, newspaper articles,  
or even humorous cartoons
 Your thoughts on people in the  
news, or in books or movies 
In focus
FEEDBACK
It is important to have a person  
in your life who gives you honest, 
gut-level feedback, to help  
you gain perspective on your 
experiences and learn from them. 
This should be someone you trust 
enough to go to when you have  
real problems and ask, “Am I off 
base here? Am I crazy?”  
This person could be a partner, a 
mentor, a best friend, a coworker,  
a therapist, or a personal coach. 
Today, many organizations  
are providing their managers  
with 360-degree feedback,  
allowing them to receive  
insights on their strengths  
and weaknesses from other 
members of staff.

18    /    UNDERSTANDING YOURSELF
Using emotional intelligence
Understanding EQ
Your EQ is the measure of your ability  
to understand and interact with others 
and becomes more important the more 
people you deal with. EQ does not 
measure personality traits or cognitive 
capacity. Emotional intelligence can  
be developed over time and can be  
improved through training and therapy. 
Those with a high EQ will be better  
able to control their own emotions,  
Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to monitor and work with your 
and others’ emotions. It is measured in EQ, which is the emotional 
equivalent of IQ. Daniel Goleman—author of the best-selling Emotional 
Intelligence—and other writers suggest that a technically proficient 
manager with a high EQ will be more successful than a manager who  
has only a high IQ.
while at the same time using them  
as a basis for action. Working with 
emotions, rather than being at the  
mercy of them, makes individuals  
more successful in dealing with the 
demands of the environment around 
them. They are better able to control 
impulses and deal with stress, and  
better at problem solving. All of these 
qualities help the individual perform 
more competently at work.

USING EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE    /    19
Using EI at work
To be a successful manager in today’s 
business world, a high EQ may be  
more important than sheer intellectual  
or technical ability. A manager who 
leads a project team of diverse people 
will need to understand and interact 
successfully with others. Applying 
emotional intelligence at work means 
you are open to the ideas of others and 
can build and mend relationships with 
others. You are aware of your feelings 
and act accordingly, articulating ideas 
so that others can understand them, 
developing rapport, building trust, and 
working toward consensus. Managers 
who are attuned to their own feelings 
and the feelings of others use this 
understanding to enhance personal, 
team, and organizational performance.

Managing emotions
Emotional intelligence has two aspects: 
one inward facing and one outward  
facing. The first of these is your emotional 
self-awareness and your ability to manage 
your own emotions. The second is your 
degree of empathy, or awareness of others’ 
emotions, and your ability to productively 
manage relationships with others. Both 
inward- and outward-facing aspects of 
emotional intelligence are made up of a 
number of skills or competencies.

22    /    UNDERSTANDING YOURSELF
Applying assertiveness
An effective manager needs to behave in an active and assertive  
manner to get things done. Assertive managers are able to express  
their feelings and act with appropriate degrees of openness and candor,  
but still have a regard for the feelings and rights of others.
STATE YOUR CASE
Try beginning your 
conversations with “I” 
phrases, such as  
“I think,” “I believe,”  
or “I need.”
BE PREPARED
Prepare for tricky 
encounters: have all the 
facts on hand, and try  
to anticipate the other 
person’s replies.
USE OPEN 
QUESTIONS
If you are finding it hard 
to get a person to talk to 
you, use open questions 
that cannot be answered 
with a simple “yes” or 
“no” answer.
Becoming more assertive
Assertive behavior for 
effective management
Most people fall between the extremes  
of passive and aggressive. At these 
extremes, passive and aggressive 
behaviors hinder effective managerial 
relations because neither encourages 
openness. Effective managers need to be 
assertive, express their ideas and feelings 
openly, and stand up for their rights, and 
all in a way that makes it easier for those 
they are managing to do the same. The 
assertive manager is always sensitive to 
the needs of others; he or she does not 
Understanding  
personality types
Assertiveness and the ability to  
express feelings are skills that people 
possess to different extents. Some are 
aggressive, direct, and blunt, and can 
appear domineering, pushy, or self-
centered. Some people tend to be 
passive, inhibited, and submissive; they 
bottle up their feelings and fail even  
to stand up for their legitimate rights.
Passive individuals seek to avoid conflicts 
and tend to sublimate their own needs 
and feelings in order to satisfy others. 

APPLYING ASSERTIVENESS    /    23
ASK YOURSELF…
YES
NO
Am I assertive enough?
1  Does my response accurately reflect how I feel if I’m given  
a compliment about my work? ......................................................... 
 
2 Am I able to speak up when I’m in a group of strangers? ............... 
 
3  If others interrupt me when I am talking, can I hold  
my ground? ........................................................................................ 
 
4 Do I avoid being taken advantage of by other people? ................... 
 
5 Am I able to criticize others’ work if I think  
 
they might react badly? .................................................................... 
 
GET PERSPECTIVE
Try to see a situation 
from the other person’s 
point of view. Most 
workplace bullies, for 
example, are hiding 
their own insecurities or 
an inability to do the job. 
BE PATIENT
You’ll need time and 
practice to become 
comfortable with the 
new behavior. Recognize 
that those around you 
may initially be 
uncomfortable when  
you start to become 
more assertive.
VISUALIZE 
YOURSELF
Try assertive role

see yourself as an

seek to rule less assertive people. Trying 
to achieve dominance may produce 
short-term results but will not make  
the best use of the abilities of members  
of your team. 
The assertive manager is 
straightforward yet sensitive 
to the needs of others

24    /    UNDERSTANDING YOURSELF
Examining your assumptions
Shaping the environment
Organizations that are designed based 
on X-style assumptions are very different 
to those designed by Y-style managers. 
For example, because they believe that 
their workers are motivated to help the 
organization reach its goals, Y-style 
managers will decentralize authority  
and give more control to workers than 
will X-style managers. A Y-style manager 
realizes that most people are not 
resistant to organizational needs by 
nature, but may have become so as a 
result of negative experiences, and 
strives to design structures that involve 
the employees in executing their work 
X-style managers 
Prominent management theorist 
Douglas McGregor distinguished  
two management styles—X and Y—
based on the assumptions held by 
managers about the motives of their 
staff. X-style managers believe that 
workers need to be coerced and 
directed. They tend to be strict  
and controlling, giving workers  
little latitude and punishing poor 
performance. They use few rewards 
and typically give only negative 
feedback. These managers see  
little point in workers having 
autonomy, because they think  
that the workforce neither expects 
nor desires cooperation. 
Y-style managers 
Y-style assumptions reflect a much 
more optimistic view of human 
nature. Y-style management 
contends that people will gladly direct 
themselves toward objectives if their 
efforts are appropriately rewarded. 
Managers who hold Y assumptions 
assume a great deal of confidence in 
their workers. They are less directive 
and empower workers, giving them 
more responsibilities and freedom  
to accomplish tasks as they  
deem appropriate. 
Managers tend to treat their staff according to assumptions they hold 
about what motivates people. These assumptions create self-fulfilling 
prophecies in the behavior of the staff. Managers reward what they 
expect, and consequently only get what they expect. Challenging your 
own assumptions is one of the first steps in becoming a better manager.
ANALYZE YOURSELF 
Honestly review every 
decision you make and  
every task you delegate.  
In each case, ask yourself 
what you assumed the staff 
involved would think, and how 
you expected them to behave. 
Remember that positive 
expectations help produce 
positive outcomes.

roles, such as participative management 
and joint goal setting. These approaches 
allow employees to exercise some 
self-direction and self-control in  
their work lives. 
In Y-style management, although 
individuals and groups are still 
accountable for their activities, the role 
of the manager is not to exert control 
but to provide support and advice  
and to make sure that workers have  
the resources they need to perform 
their jobs effectively. By contrast,  
X-style managers consider their  
role to be to monitor workers to  
ensure that they contribute to the 
production process and do not  
threaten product quality.

Clarifying your values
Defining values
Values are formed early in our lives, 
from the influence of our parents, 
teachers, friends, religious leaders, and 
media role models. Some may change  
as we go through life and experience 
different behaviors. Your values  
manifest themselves in everything you 
do and the choices that you make. If you 
are someone who particularly values 
promptness, for example, you will make 
sure that you always behave in ways that 
mean you are on time for appointments. 
The thought of being late will stimulate 
feelings of stress in you, and induce  
a subsequent adrenaline rush as you  
hurry to be at the appointment on time. 
As a manager, it is important for you  
to clarify your values, so that you can 
determine what your goals are and  
how you want to manage yourself  
and others to achieve them.
Clarifying your  
personal values
It may sound strange, but one of the  
best ways to clarify your personal  
values and gain a clear understanding  
of what is important to you is to  
think about how you would like to  
be remembered in your eulogy. Sit 
quietly and consider how you want your 
friends and family to remember you,  
and what you want your work colleagues 
Values are stable and enduring beliefs about what is good, right, and 
worthwhile, and about the behavior that is desirable for achieving what  
is worthwhile. To be an effective manager, it is necessary to have a good 
understanding of what your values are and to act accordingly.
to say they thought of you. Also think  
of your broader contributions—how 
would you like to be remembered in the 
communities you are a part of? Make 
notes, and use the information you  
write down to identify the values that  
are most important to you.
Dealing with conflicts
It can be challenging when your  
personal values conflict with those  
of your organization, or when there are 
conflicting values between individuals or 
subgroups. Value differences can exist, 
for example, about how to perform jobs,

About your influences

degree of intimacy in work relationships. 
Having a clear understanding of your 
own personal value set will help you  
to manage these conflict situations. If 
you are clear about your own values, you 
can act with integrity and practice what 
you preach regardless of emotional or 
social pressure. To address a conflict 
situation, first make sure you are aware 
of, understand, and are tolerant of  
the value differences held by the 
other parties. This will help 
you determine whether  
the value conflict is, in fact, 
irresolvable and will require 
personnel changes, or 
whether compromises 
and adjustments  
can be made to 
accommodate  
the different 
perspectives.
TYPES OF VALUE
Values can be classified  
into two types: terminal  
and instrumental. Terminal 
values (your “ends” in life) are 
desirable ends or goals, such 
as a comfortable, prosperous 
life, world peace, great wisdom, 
or salvation. Instrumental 
values (the “means” to those 
ends) are beliefs about what 
behaviors are appropriate in 
striving for desired goals and 
ends. Consider a manager  
who works extra hours to help 
deliver a customer’s rush order. 
The attitude displayed is a 
willingness to help a customer 
with a problem. The value that 
serves as the foundation of  
this attitude might be that  
of service to others.

Developing your personal 
mission statement
Defining your future 
Your personal mission statement spells 
out your managerial philosophy. It defines 
the type of manager you want to be (your 
character), what you want to accomplish 
(your contributions), and what principles 
guide your behavior (your values). It 
provides you with the vision and values  
to direct your managerial life—the basis 
for setting long- and short-term goals, 
and how best to deploy your time.
Setting out your philosophy
Make sure that your personal mission 
statement is an accurate reflection of  
your values, goals, and aspirations for 
A personal mission statement provides you with the long-term vision 
and motivation to manage yourself and others in your team according to 
your own values. It also allows you to establish your purpose and goals 
as a manager and sets a benchmark for self-evaluation.
LEARN FROM 
SETBACKS 
Things will not always work 
out as you have planned. 
When you face setbacks,  
be honest with yourself 
about what happened and 
why, and think carefully 
about whether you need  
to reevaluate your goals. 
Tip
EVALUATE PROGRESS
Continually evaluate your 
performance against your 
mission statement. When 
things do not work out, be 
honest with yourself about why.
SEE THE FUTURE

motivating force.

read: “My career goals are to effectively 
manage my team to achieve respect  
and knowledge, to use my talents as  
a manager to help others, and to play  
an active role in this organization.”  
Another individual’s statement might  
have a very different focus: “As a manager 
in this creative firm, I want to establish  
a fault-free, self perpetuating learning 
environment.” Reevaluate your statement 
on a regular basis—annually, at least—to 
ensure that it still describes your overall 
vision for your future as a manager.

Setting and attaining your personal 
managerial goals
SET YOUR GOALS
Personalize your goals. You will be far more committed 
to goals that you have set yourself, rather than those 
that have been set for you by someone else.
GET SUPPORT
Develop a support group of people who will help you in 
achieving your goals. Your support group should include 
those with the resources you need to be successful.
REWARD YOURSELF
Reward yourself for small wins. When you achieve 
incremental progress toward your goals, treat yourself to  
a reward, such as a night out or some recreational activity.
BE SMART
Set goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, 
Realistic, and Time-bound. You are much more likely to 
achieve goals that are well defined and within your reach.

Teams are the cornerstones of most public  
and nonprofit organizations. Successful  
team leaders understand what makes a team 
effective and what can lead to failure. To be  
a successful manager, you need to be able

Setting goals and planning
Planning is a key skill for any manager and starts with having a good 
understanding of the organization’s objectives. It involves establishing  
a strategy for achieving those goals using the personnel available, and 
developing the means to integrate and coordinate necessary activities.
Knowing your goals 
Planning is concerned with ends  
(what needs to be done) and means  
(how those ends are to be achieved).  
In order to create a plan, managers  
must first identify the organization’s 
goals—what it is trying to achieve.
Planning and monitoring
Goals are the foundation of all other 
planning activities. They refer to  
the desired outcomes for the entire 
organization, for groups and teams 
within the organization, and for 
individuals. In the best organizations, 
employees and teams work closely  
with their managers to set their own 
goals and plan courses of action. Goals 
provide the direction for all management 
decisions and form the criteria against 
which actual accomplishments can  
be measured. 
LOOK TO THE FUTURE
Write down three SMART 
goals that you want your 
team to achieve in the next 
five years, and then plan 
how you will reach them.
Tip
Define your overall goals,  
by asking questions such  
as “Why do we exist?”  
and “What do we do?”
Thoroughly analyze your 
working environment, to 
identify opportunities you  
can exploit and threats  
you may encounter.
Use the results to set 
objectives that you want to 
meet. These will create a 
standard against which to 
measure your progress.

Setting your goals
There are five basic rules that can help you set effective goals. 
Always make your goals SMART: Specific, Measurable, Aligned, 
Reachable, and Time-bound.
 Specific Goals are meaningful only when they are specific 
enough to be measured and verified. 
 Measurable Goals need to have a clear outcome that  
can be objectively assessed. They also need to have  
clear benchmarks that can be checked along the way.
 Aligned Goals should contribute to the mission, vision, and 
strategic plan of the organization and be congruent with the 
values and objectives of the employee implementing them. 
 Reachable Goals should require you to stretch to reach 
them, but not be set unrealistically high.
Time-bound Open-ended goals can be neglected because 
there is no sense of urgency to complete them. Whenever 
possible, goals should include a time limit.

Designing work
Job design refers to the way tasks are combined to form complete jobs. 
It involves trying to shape the right jobs to conform to the right people, 
taking into account both the organization’s goals and the employees’ 
satisfaction. Well-designed jobs lead to high motivation, high-quality 
performance, high satisfaction, and low absenteeism and turnover. 
CREATE NATURAL  
WORK UNITS
Design tasks to form an 
identifiable whole to 
increase employee 
“ownership” and to 
encourage workers  
to view their jobs  
as important. 
Defining jobs
Jobs vary considerably: a lifeguard,  
for example, will have very different 
day-to-day responsibilities than an 
accountant or a construction worker. 
However, any job can be described  
in terms of five core job dimensions:
•  Skill variety: the degree to which  
a job requires a variety of different 
activities so that the worker can 
employ a number of different skills 
and talents. 
•  Task identity: the degree to which  
a job requires completion of a whole 
and identifiable piece of work.
•  Task significance: the degree to which 
a job has an impact on the lives of 
other people.
•  Autonomy: the degree to which a job 
provides freedom and discretion to 
the worker in scheduling tasks and  
in determining how the work will  
be carried out.
•  Feedback: the degree to which  
the worker gets direct and clear 
information about the effectiveness  
of his or her performance.
As a manager, you can maximize  
your team’s performance by enhancing 
these five dimensions. Skill variety, task 
identity, and task significance combine  
to create meaningful work. Jobs with 
these characteristics will be perceived 
as important, valuable, and worthwhile. 
Jobs that possess autonomy give 
workers a sense of responsibility for 
their results. Jobs that provide feedback 
indicate to the employee how effectively 
he or she is performing.
Skill variety, task identity, 
and task significance 
combine to create jobs 
that are seen as important, 
valuable, and worthwhile

GET THE RIGHT PERSON 
FOR THE JOB 
It is very difficult to 
completely change how a 
person performs, so try to 
match people to jobs that 
they are good at. This will 
make them most likely to 
achieve good results.
Tip
COMBINE TASKS
Put existing fragmented 
tasks together to form 
larger modules of work. 
This can help increase  
skill variety and  
task identity. 
ESTABLISH CLIENT 
RELATIONSHIPS
Building direct 
relationships between  
the worker and the client—
the user of the product  
or the service that  
the employee works  
on—increases skill  
variety, autonomy,  
and feedback. 
EXPAND JOBS 
VERTICALLY
Giving employees 
responsibilities formerly 
reserved for managers 
closes the gap between the 
“doing” and “controlling” 
aspects of the job, and 
increases autonomy.   
IMPROVE FEEDBACK 
CHANNELS
Feedback tells employees 
how well they are 
performing, and whether 
their performance is 
improving, deteriorating,  
or remaining constant. 
Employees should receive 
feedback directly as they  
do their jobs.

High-performing teams
As Lee Iacocca, former CEO of Chrysler Corporation, said: “All business 
operations can be reduced to three words: people, product, and profit. 
People come first. Unless you’ve got a good team, you can’t do much with 
the other two.” Successful managers are those who create, work with, 
and manage successful teams.
WHO ARE WE?
Sharing strengths, 
weaknesses, work 
preferences, and  
values allows the 
establishment of a set of 
common beliefs for the 
team, creating a group 
identity and a feeling of 
“what we stand for.”
WHERE ARE WE 
NOW? 
Understanding the 
current position means 
that a team can 
reinforce its strengths, 
improve on its 
weaknesses, and 
identify opportunities  
to capitalize on and 
threats to be aware of.
WHERE ARE WE 
GOING?
Teams need to have  
a vision of the pot of  
gold at the end of the 
rainbow. They also need 
a mission, a purpose, 
and a set of specific 
team goals that they  
are all excited about.
Understanding team performance
Defining high- 
performing teams
A team is two or more people who  
meet regularly, perceive themselves  
as a distinct entity distinguishable from 
others, have complementary skills, and 
are committed to a common purpose,  
a set of performance goals, and an 
approach for which they hold themselves 
mutually accountable. High-performing 
teams engage in collective work 
produced by coordinated joint efforts  
that result in more than the sum of the 
individual efforts. Research and practical 
experience have shown that teams with 
many more than 12 members tend to 
lack cohesion and struggle to make  
fast and effective decisions.

HIGH-PERFORMING TEAMS    /    37
HOW WILL WE  
GET THERE?
Team members must 
understand who will  
do what and when to 
accomplish team goals,

their job description, 
roles on the team, 
responsibilities, and 
areas of authority  
and accountability.

MUTUAL TRUST
A climate of mutual trust is 
essential in a high-performing 
team—each member of the team 
needs to know they can depend on 
the others. Successful managers 
build mutual trust by creating  
a climate of openness in which 
employees are free to discuss 
problems without fear of retaliation. 
They are approachable and 
respectful and listen to team 
members’ ideas, and develop a 
reputation for being fair, objective, 
and impartial in their treatment of 
others. Consistency and honesty 
are key, so these managers  
avoid erratic and unpredictable 
behavior and always follow  
through on any explicit and  
implied promises they make.  
   Communication is at the  
heart of building and maintaining 
mutual interdependence between 
members of a team. Managers  
of high-performing teams keep 
team members informed about 
upper-management decisions and 
policies and give accurate feedback 
on their performance. They are  
also open and candid about their 
own problems and limitations.

38    /    MANAGING A TEAM
Achieving good teamwork
To help your teams perform to the best 
of their ability, create clear goals. All 
team members need to have a thorough 
understanding of the goals of the team 
and a belief that these goals embody  
a worthwhile result. This encourages 
team members to sublimate personal 
concerns to those of the team. Members 
need to be committed to the team’s 
goals, know what they are expected  
to accomplish, and understand how  
they will work together to achieve  
these goals.  
However, these goals must be 
attainable; team members can lose 
morale if it seems that they are not.  
To avoid this, set smaller interim 
milestones in the path to your overall 
goal. As these smaller goals are 
attained, your team’s success is 
reinforced. Cohesiveness is increased, 
morale improves, and confidence builds.
As the manager of a team, it is your 
job to provide the resources and support 
that the members need to achieve 
success. Offer skills training where 
needed, either personally or by calling  
in specialists within your organization  
or outside training services.

number for a team to work  
at optimal effectiveness 
6–12
Steering your team
Team members should all share in  
the glory when their team succeeds,  
but also share in the blame when the  
team fails. However, members need  
to know that they cannot ride on the  
backs of others. 
Identify what each member’s 
contribution to the team’s work should  
be and make it a part of his or her  
overall performance appraisal. To help 
monitor performance, select members of 
the team to act as participant–observers. 
While a team is working, the role of the 
participant–observer is to focus on  
the processes being used—the sequence 
of actions that takes place between team 
members to achieve a goal. Periodically, 
the participant–observer should stop the 
team from working on its task and 
discuss the process members are 
engaged in. The objectives of the 
participant–observer are to improve  
the team’s functioning by discussing the 
processes being used and creating 
strategies for improving them.

Create a performance agreement to 
record the details of what the team is

success clearly helps to ensure that 
there is a mutual understanding and

Valuing diversity
Understanding and managing people who are similar to us can be 
challenging, but understanding and managing those who are dissimilar 
from us and from each other is tougher. As the workplace becomes 
more diverse and as business becomes more global, managers  
must understand how cultural diversity affects the expectations  
and behavior of everyone in the organization.
Understanding the changes
The labor market is dramatically 
changing. Most countries are experiencing 
an increase in the age of their workforce, 
increased immigration, and, in many, a 
rapid increase in the number of working 
women. The globalization of business  
also brings with it a cross-cultural 
mandate. With more businesses selling 
and manufacturing products and 
services abroad, managers increasingly 
see the need to ensure that their 
employees can relate to customers  
from many different cultures. Workers 
who believe that their differences are  
not merely tolerated but valued by their 
employer are more likely to be loyal, 
productive, and committed. 
LET EVERYONE KNOW
Make a public commitment  
to valuing diversity—this  
will ensure that you are 
accountable for your actions, 
and may attract potential 
employees who prefer to 
work for someone who values 
equal opportunities for all.

VALUING DIVERSITY    /    41
Capitalizing on diversity
Managers face many challenges 
capitalizing on diversity, such as: 
coping with employees’ unfamiliarity 
with native languages, learning  
which rewards are valued by different 
demographics, and providing career 
development programs that fit  
the values of different targeted groups. 
There are several ways for you to try  
to capitalize on diversity:
•  Communicate your objectives  
and expectations about diversity  
to employees through a range of 
channels, such as mission and  
value statements, slogans, creeds, 
newsletters, speeches, emails, and 
everyday conversations.
•  Recruit through nontraditional 
sources. Relying on current 
employee referrals usually produces

a limited range of candidates. Try 
instead to identify novel sources for 
recruitment, such as women’s job 
networks, targeted newspapers, 
training centers for the disabled, 
urban job banks, and over-50s clubs. 
•  Use diverse incentives for motivation. 
Most studies on the subject of 
motivation are by North American 
researchers—unsurprisingly— 
on North American workers. 
Consequently, these studies are 
based on beliefs that most people 
work to promote their own well-being 
and get ahead. This may be at odds 
with people from more collectivist 
countries, such as Venezuela, 
Singapore, Japan, and Mexico, where 
individuals are driven by their loyalty 
to the organization or society, not their 
own self-interest.

Delegating effectively
Empowering others
Managers delegate by transferring authority and 
responsibility for work to employees. Delegation 
empowers employees to achieve goals by 
allowing them to make their own decisions about 
how to do a job. Delegation also helps develop 
employees for promotion opportunities by 
expanding their knowledge, job capabilities, 
and decision-making skills. 
Managers are responsible for getting things done through 
other people. You need to accomplish assigned goals  
by delegating responsibility and authority to others. 
Empowering others through delegation is one of the most 
powerful managerial tools for increasing productivity.
ALLOCATION OF DUTIES
Before a manager can delegate 
authority, the tasks and activities 
that need to be accomplished must 
be explained.
Delegating lets  
you focus on  
key strategic 
activities and can 
also lead to better 
decision-making 
Feeling the benefits
Effective delegation is key for  
any manager. It will free up your time, 
allowing you to focus on big-picture strategic 
activities. It can also lead to better decision-
making, because it pushes decisions down  
the organization, meaning that decision-makers 
are often closer to the problems. It also helps 
those you are managing develop their own 
decision-making skills and prepares them  
for future promotion opportunities. 

DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY
Delegation is the process  
of transferring authority to 
empower a subordinate to act 
for you as a manager.
ASSIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY
Managers should assign responsibility 
to the empowered employee for 
performing the job adequately.
CREATION OF ACCOUNTABILITY
Managers should hold empowered employees responsible 
for properly carrying out their duties. This includes taking 
responsibility for the completion of tasks assigned to them 
and also being accountable to the manager for the 
satisfactory performance of that work.

while motivation is the product of 
desire and commitment. All of these 
elements are required for high 
performance levels. If someone is  
not performing well, the first question  
you should ask yourself is: “Is this 
person’s poor performance the  
result of a lack of ability or a lack of 
motivation?” Motivational methods can 
often be very effective for improving 
performance, but if the problem is lack 
of ability, no amount of pressure or 
encouragement will help. What the 
person needs is training, additional 
resources, or a different job.

Using positive reinforcement
Rewarding progress and success  
and recognizing achievements are 
powerful ways to motivate your team.  
By rewarding someone for doing 
something right, you positively reinforce 
that behavior, providing an incentive for  
doing it again. There are two basic types 
of reward: extrinsic and intrinsic. Many 
people depend on and highly value 
extrinsic rewards that are externally 
bestowed, such as praise, a promotion, 
or a pay raise. Others place a high value  
on intrinsic rewards, which originate 
from their own personal feelings about 
how they performed or the satisfaction 
that they derive from a job well done. 
CASE STUDY
PRIORITIZING NEEDS
Theresa, a successful technical 
writer and a single parent,  
had been earning a good salary  
and benefits that enabled her  
to provide for her family’s  
physical well-being: ample  
food, comfortable housing and  
clothing, and good medical care. 
Her company then announced  
that it was downsizing, and she 
feared being laid off. This triggered 
concerns about her safety needs 
and meant that she became much 
less concerned about the higher 
order needs of belonging to a  
group or her own self-esteem to 
perform creative and technically 
accurate work. Rather, she  
was motivated to do whatever was 
necessary to ensure that she kept 
her job or could find a new one. 
Once Theresa knew that her job 
was safe, she changed back to 
having a higher-order need, 
energizing her behavior.

rewards that

MOTIVATING OTHERS    /    49
Rewarding success
Try to understand whether each individual 
you are managing values intrinsic or 
extrinsic rewards more highly. If you  
always praise achievements, for example,  
a motivated person who excels largely for 
the feelings of intrinsic satisfaction will 
probably begin to view you as superficial. 
The professional may think, “I know I did  
a superb job on this project. Why is my 
manager being so condescending?”
People also desire different types of 
extrinsic rewards. Praise may be perfectly 
acceptable to the person motivated by 
affiliation and relationship needs, but  
may do nothing for the person expecting  
a more tangible reward, like money.  
Typical extrinsic rewards are favorable 
assignments, trips to desirable destinations, 
tuition reimbursement, pay raises, bonuses, 
promotions, and office placements.

GIVING PERFORMANCE FEEDBACK
Provide feedback to demonstrate that you know what the 
members of your team are doing and to acknowledge 
improved performance or a job well done. Especially 
when individuals are unsure of themselves, you

Praising specific accomplishments will help bolster

rewards, such as allocating more favorable job assignments.

REINFORCING THE RIGHT BEHAVIOR
Quite often what managers say they want, what they reward, and  
what they get from their team are quite different. If you verbally 
espouse innovation but reward doing things by the book, you are 
sending mixed signals and reinforcing the wrong behavior. Think 
carefully about your rewards and what they mean, and make sure 
that you reinforce behavior that you want to see repeated.

Teaching skills
Learning by experience
People learn faster and retain more 
information if they have to exert some 
kind of active effort. The famous quote, 
attributed to Confucius: “I hear and I 
forget. I see and I remember. I do and  
I understand” is frequently used to 
support the value of learning through 
experience. A major implication of this 
notion is that new skills can be learned 
only through experimenting with new 
behaviors, observing the results, and 
learning from the experience.
Watching, thinking, and doing
The learning of new skills is maximized 
when learners get the opportunity to 
combine watching, thinking, and doing. The 
experiential learning model encompasses 
four elements: learning new concepts 
As a manager, an important part of your role is to help those you are 
managing to develop their skills. If you can encourage the development 
of skills such as self-awareness, communication, and time management, 
you will be rewarded with a high-performing team.

(conceptualizing), planning how to test  
the ideas (plan to test), actively applying 
the skill in a new experience (gaining 
concrete experience), and examining  
the consequences of the experience 
(reflective observation). After reflecting 
on the experience, learners use the 
lessons they have learned from what 
happened to create a refined conceptual 
map of the skill, and the cycle continues. 
To use the experiential learning model 
to teach skills, you need to: ensure  
that learners understand the skill both 
conceptually and behaviorally; give them 
opportunities to practice it; give feedback 
on how well they are performing the skill; 
and encourage them to use the skill often 
enough so that it becomes integrated 
into their behavioral repertoire.

Appraising performance
Assessing progress
Giving feedback in a formal way in 
performance appraisal interviews 
conveys to those you are managing  
that you care about how they are doing. 
Appraisals allow you to set goals and 
monitor achievement, helping to 
motivate your team to perform to a higher 
level. They allow you to tell your team 
how well each person is progressing, 
which can reinforce good behavior and 
extinguish dysfunctional behavior. 
However, the interview itself should  
be the final step in the performance 
As a manager, you must ensure that objectives are met and also that 
employees learn how to enhance their performance. Providing feedback 
through the formal performance appraisal process can increase 
productivity and morale and decrease absenteeism and staff turnover.

appraisal process. Appraisal should be  
a continuous process, starting with the 
establishment and communication of 
performance standards. Assess how 
each individual is performing relative  
to these standards, and use this 
information to discuss a person’s 
performance in the appraisal interview.
The appraisal interview
Start with the aim of putting the person 
at ease. Most people don’t like to hear 
their work criticized, so be supportive 
and understanding and create a helpful 
and constructive climate. Begin by 
explaining what will transpire during the 
appraisal and why. Keep your appraisal 
goal-oriented, and make sure that your 
feedback is specific. Where you can,  
get the person’s own perceptions of  
the problems being addressed—there 
may be contributing factors that you are 
unaware of. Encourage self-evaluation; 
the person may acknowledge 
performance problems independently, 
thus eliminating your need to raise them. 
They may also offer viable solutions.
Setting action points
At the end of the interview, ask the 
recipient to rephrase the content of your 
appraisal. This will indicate whether or  
not you have succeeded in communicating 
your evaluation clearly. Finish by drawing 
up a plan of action. Draft a step-by-step 
plan for improvement. Include in the plan 
what needs to be done, by when, and how 
you will monitor the person’s activities. 

Leadership is the process of providing direction, 
influencing and energizing others, and obtaining 
follower commitment to shared organizational 
goals. Managers need to lead their team, setting 
ethical boundaries for them to follow, developing 
a power base for influencing them to change in 
positive ways, and helping them improve through 
coaching and mentoring.

Taking an ethical path
Understanding ethics
Ethics refer to the rules or principles 
that define right or wrong conduct. In 
the workplace, acting ethically is not 
just an abstraction, it is an everyday 
occurrence. Consider this dilemma:  
an employee, after some pressure  
from you, has found another job. You  
are relieved because you will not have to 
fire him; his work has been substandard 
for some time. But your relief turns to 
dismay when he asks you for a letter  
of recommendation. Do you say no and 
run the risk that he will not leave? Or  
do you write the letter, knowing that 
you’re influencing someone else to  
take him on?
Being responsible
Ethics is important for everyone  
in an organization, particularly as 
some unethical acts are also illegal. 
Many organizations want employees  
to behave ethically because such  
a reputation is good for business, 
which in turn can mean larger profits. 
However, acting ethically is especially 
crucial for managers. The decisions  
a manager makes set the standard  
for those they are managing and help 
create a tone for the organization. If 
employees believe all are held to high 
standards, they are likely to feel better 
about themselves, their colleagues, 
and their organization.
Few of us would be likely to steal or cheat, but how principled 
would you be, or should you be, when faced with routine business 
situations involving ethical choices? As a leader, you need to  
have a clear understanding of your ethical principles and set  
a consistent example for your team.
ASK YOURSELF…
YES
NO
Is what I’m about to do ethical?
1 Am I clear why I’m doing what I’m about to do?  .............................. 
 
2 Have I acknowledged my true intentions in taking this action? ..... 
 
3 Are there any ulterior motives behind my action, such  
 
as proving myself to my peers or superiors? .................................. 
 
4 Will my actions injure someone, physically or emotionally?  ........ 
 
5 Would I disclose to my boss or my family what I’m about to do?  ... 
 

Developing ethics
The behavior of managers is under  
more scrutiny than that of other  
members of staff, and misdeeds  
can become quickly and widely  
known, destroying the reputation of the 
organization. It is important for managers 
to develop their own ethical boundaries—
lines that they and their employees should 
not cross. To do this, you need to:
>
> Know and understand your organization’s  
 
policy on ethics.
>
> Anticipate unethical conduct. Be alert to situations that may 
 
promote unethical behavior. (Under unusual circumstances, even  
 
a normally ethical person may be tempted to act out of character.)
>
>  Consider all consequences. Ask yourself questions such as: “What 
if my actions were described in detail on a local TV news show, or 
in the newspaper? What if I get caught doing something unethical? 
Am I prepared to deal with the consequences?”
>
> Seek opinions from others. They may have been in a similar 
 
situation, or at least can listen and be a sounding board for you.
>
> Do what you truly believe is right. You have a conscience and are  
 
responsible for your behavior. You need to be true to your own  
 
internal ethical standards. Ask yourself the simple question:  
 
“Can I live with what I have decided to do?”
A reputation for ethical 
practice boosts staff 
satisfaction and morale 
and is good for business, 
which in turn can mean 
larger profits

Ensuring cultural fit
Analyzing organizational 
culture
The cultural imperatives of an 
organization are often not written down 
or even discussed, but all successful 
managers must learn what to do and 
what not to do in their organizations.  
In fact, the better the match between 
the manager’s personal style and the 
organization’s culture, the more 
successful the manager is likely to be. 
Founders create culture in three ways. 
First, they hire and keep employees who 
think and feel the way they do. Second, 
founders indoctrinate and socialize 
these employees to their way of thinking. 
Third, founders act as role models, and 
their personality becomes central to the 
culture of the organization. 
An organization’s culture, or personality, refers to the key 
characteristics that the organization values and that distinguish it  
from other organizations. Managers need to be aware of organizational 
culture because they are expected to respond to the dictates of  
the culture themselves and also to develop an understanding  
of the culture in those they are managing.

Discerning the culture
Many organizations have given little 
thought to their culture and do not readily 
display it. To try to find out more about 
your organization’s culture, you might: 
•  Observe the physical surroundings. 
Look at signs, pictures, styles of dress, 
length of hair, the degree of openness 
among offices, and how those offices  
are furnished and arranged.
•  Listen to the language. For example,  
do managers use military terms, such 
as “take no prisoners,” and “divide  
and conquer”? Or do they speak about 
“intuition,” “care,” and “our family  
of customers”?
•  Ask different people the same questions 
and compare their answers. You might 
ask: how does this company define 
success? For what are 
employees most 
rewarded? Who is 
on the fast track  
and what did they 
do to get there?

ENSURING CULTURAL FIT    /    61
Sustaining culture
Managers are responsible for sustaining  
organizational culture, by helping new 
employees learn and adapt to it. A new 
worker, for example, must be taught 
what behaviors are valued and rewarded 
by the organization, so that he or she  
can learn the “system” and gradually 
assume those behaviors that are 
appropriate to their role.

Solving problems
Managerial success depends on making the right decisions at the  
right times. However, unless you define a problem and identify its  
root causes, it is impossible to make appropriate decisions about  
how to solve it. Effective managers know how to gather and evaluate 
information that clarifies a problem, develop alternatives, and weigh  
up the implications of a plan before implementing it. They are able  
to analyze  data and use their teams to develop creative solutions.
Spotting problems
A problem exists when a situation is  
not what is needed or desired. A major 
responsibility for all managers is to 
maintain a constant lookout for existing 
or potential problems, and to spot  
them early before they escalate into 
serious situations. Managers fulfill  
this responsibility by keeping channels 
of communication open, monitoring 
employees’ current performance,  
and examining deviations from present 
plans as well as from past experience. 
Four situations can alert managers  
to possible problems: 
• A deviation from past experience 
• A deviation from a set plan
•  When other people communicate 
problems to you
•  When competitors start  
to outperform your team  
or organization.

SOLVING PROBLEMS    /    63
Finding solutions
Problem solving involves closing the 
gap between what is actually taking 
place and a desired outcome. Once  
you have identified a problem that 
needs to be addressed, start by 
analyzing the problem and defining  
it as clearly as you can. This is a key 
step: the definition you generate will 
have a major impact on all remaining 
steps in the process. If you get the 
definition wrong, all remaining steps 
will be distorted, because you will  
base them on insufficient or erroneous 
information. Definition is important 
even if the solution appears to be 
obvious—without a full assessment  
you may miss an alternative resolution 
that is more advantageous. 
Gather as much information  
about the situation as you can. Try  
to understand the goals of all of the 
parties involved, and clarify any aspects 
of the problem you are unclear about. 
Developing an action plan
Once you are satisfied that you have a  
full understanding of the issues, develop 
courses of action that could provide a 
resolution to the problem. There is often 
more than one way to solve a problem,  
so it is critical to consider all possible 
solutions and arrive at several 
alternatives from which to choose.
Implementing and monitoring
Your decision will provide you with an 
action plan. However, this will be of little 
value unless it is implemented effectively. 
Defining how, when, and by whom the 
action plan is to be implemented and 
communicating this to those involved is 
what connects the decision with reality. 
Your involvement should not end at 
implementation. Establish criteria for 
measuring success, then track progress 
and take corrective actions when 
necessary. Try to develop and maintain 
positive attitudes in everyone involved.

Types of power
Your power within an organization can 
come from a variety of sources. Use these 
different types of power in their correct 
contexts to maximize your effectiveness  
as a manager.
•  Legitimate power This derives from 
your position in the hierarchy of a 
company and is enhanced by a clear 
chain of command and corporate 
structure in the organization. 
•  Coercive power The threat of sanction 
or punishment confers power, but  
should be used very carefully—when  
the organization is in difficulty or crisis. 
Ways to use managerial 
power to obtain desired 
outcomes
Legitimate power derives 
from your position in the 
hierarchy of a company, 
and is enhanced by a clear 
chain of command and 
corporate structure 
•  Referent power This form of  
power derives from being respected 
and admired by subordinates, and 
encouraging them to behave in 
imitation of your style. In this 
situation, giving subordinates 
responsibility for their own actions 
enhances your power. It works best in 
small workplaces, where one-on-one 
relationships can be fostered. 
•  Reward power This comes from  
the ability to provide incentives  
and rewards, such as praise or  
promotion, to subordinates. 

BUILDING POWER    /    67
FRIENDLINESS
Use flattery, create goodwill, act humbly, and be 
supportive prior to making a request. This works  
best when you are well liked.
BARGAINING
Exchange benefits or favors to negotiate outcomes 
acceptable to both parties. This works best when 
organizational culture promotes give-and-take cooperation.
ASSERTIVENESS
Be direct and forceful when indicating what you want  
from others. This strategy is most effective when the 
balance of power is clearly in your favor.
COALITIONS
Develop support in the organization for what you want to 
happen. This is most effective where final decisions rely 
on the quantity not the quality of support. 
REASONING
Use facts and data to make a logical or rational 
presentation of ideas. This is most effective when  
others are trustworthy, open, and logical.
HIGHER AUTHORITY
Gain the support of those above you to back your requests. 
This is only effective in bureaucratic organizations where 
there is great respect for authority.
SANCTIONS
Use organizationally derived rewards and punishments  
to obtain desired outcomes. This approach is only for 
influencing subordinates, and may be seen as manipulative.

Managing change
Individuals, managers, teams, and organizations that do not adapt  
to change in timely ways are unlikely to survive in our increasingly 
turbulent world environment. Managers that anticipate change, learn  
to adapt to change, and manage change will be the most successful.
Overcoming resistance
Change is the process of moving from  
a present state to a more desired state  
in response to internal and external 
factors. To successfully implement 
change, you need to possess the skills to 
convince others of the need for change, 
identify gaps between the current 
situation and desired conditions, and 
create visions for desirable outcomes. 
Experienced managers are aware  
that efforts to change often face 
resistance. This can be for a variety of 
reasons, including fear, vested interests, 
misunderstanding, lack of trust, differing 
perceptions of a situation, and limited 
resources. You need to be able to  
counter this resistance to change 
through education, participation,  
and negotiation.
TURN TO THE POSITIVE
Try to use any resistance  
to your proposed change  
for your benefit, by making  
it a stimulus for dialogue and  
a deeper, more thoughtful 
analysis of the alternatives.
Tip
Promoting change
Major change does not happen easily. 
Effective managers are able to establish 
a sense of urgency that the change is 
needed. If an organization is obviously 
facing a threat to its survival, this kind  
of crisis usually gets people’s attention. 
Dramatically declining profits and  
stock prices are examples. In other 
cases, when no current crisis

problems by scanning the external 
environment, the manager needs to find 
ways to communicate the information 
broadly and dramatically to make others 
aware of the need for change. Managers 
also have to develop and articulate a 
compelling vision and strategy that 
people will aspire to, that will guide the 
change effort. The vision of what it will be 
like when the change is achieved should

In focus
PHASES OF CHANGE
Planned change progresses through 
three phases:
Unfreezing This involves helping 
people see that a change is needed 
because the existing situation is 
undesirable. Existing attitudes and 
behaviors need to be altered during 
this phase to reduce resistance, by 
explaining how the change can help 
increase productivity, for example. 
Your goal in this phase is to help the 
participants see the need for change 
and to increase their willingness to 
make the change a success.
Changing This involves making  
the actual change and requires  
you to help participants let go  
of old ways of doing things and 
develop new ones.
Refreezing The final phase involves 
reinforcing the changes made so 
that the new ways of behaving 
become stabilized. If people 
perceive the change to be working  
in their favor, positive results will

Helping others improve
Helping employees become more competent is an important part of  
any manager’s job. It contributes to a three-way win for the organization, 
the manager, and the employees themselves. By helping others resolve 
personal problems and develop skill competencies—and so help  
them improve their performance—you will motivate your team to 
achieve better results for themselves and for the organization.
Diagnosing problems
If you can reduce unsatisfactory 
performance in the people you are 
managing, you ultimately make your job 
easier because you will be increasingly 
able to delegate responsibilities to them. 
Unsatisfactory performance often has 
multiple causes. Some causes are within 
the control of the person experiencing the 
difficulties, while others are not.

Demonstrating positive regard
The relationship between you and the 
person you are helping is critical to  
the success of the coaching, mentoring,  
or counseling you undertake with them.  
For a helping relationship to be successful 
it is important to hold the person being 
helped in “unconditional positive regard.” 
This means that you accept and exhibit 
warm regard for the person needing help 
as a person of unconditional self-worth— 
a person of value no matter what the 
conditions, problems, or feelings. If  
you can communicate positive regard, it 
provides a climate of warmth and safety 
because the person feels liked and prized 
as a person. This is a necessary condition 
for developing the trust that is crucial in  
a helping relationship. 
Start by discussing  
the purpose of the  
helping session.
Before you speak to someone 
about how to help them 
improve their performance, 
make sure you have acquired 
all the facts about the situation.
Conducting a 
helping session
Take time to think about what 
type of help the situation 
requires; consider how the 
person might react and how 
they might feel about what  
you are going to discuss.
Try to make the  
person feel comfortable  
and at ease.
Establish a nondefensive 
climate, characterized by open 
communication and trust.
The person being helped 
should be held in “unconditional 
positive regard”

Counseling others
Counseling is the discussion of emotional 
problems in order to resolve them or to 
help the person better cope. Problems 
that might require counseling include 
divorce, serious illness, financial 
problems, interpersonal conflicts, drug 
and alcohol abuse, and frustration over  
a lack of career progress. Although  
most managers are not qualified as 
psychologists, there are several things 
managers can do in a counseling  
role before referring someone to  
a professional therapist.
Confidentiality is of paramount 
importance when counseling others. To 
open up and share the reasons for many 
personal problems, people must feel 
that they can trust you and that there is 
no threat to their self-esteem or their 
reputation with others. Emphasize that 
you will treat in confidence everything 
that the other person says regarding 
personal matters.

FEEDBACK
People need feedback about the 
consequences of their actions if  
they are to learn what works and 
what doesn’t and then change their 
actions to become more effective. 
Carefully thought-out feedback  
can increase performance and 
positive personal development. 
Applying feedback in the helping 
process involves: 
•  Describing observed  
behaviors and the results and 
consequences of those behaviors. 
•  Assessing the impact of  
the observed behaviors  
in terms of organizational  
vision and goals.  
•  Predicting the personal 
consequences for the person 
involved if no changes take place. 
•  Recommending changes the 
person could make to improve  
their behavior.
This sequence of actions applies 
whether the type of help being  
given to the person is coaching, 
mentoring, or counseling.

Dealing with  
personal problems
Getting someone to recognize that he  
or she has a problem is often the first 
step in helping deal with it. You can then 
follow up by helping gain insights into 
feelings and behaviors, and by exploring 
the available options.
Sometimes people just need a 
sounding board for releasing tension, 
which can become a prelude to clarifying 
the problem, identifying possible 
solutions, and taking corrective action. 
Talking things through in a counseling 
session can help people sort out  
their feelings into more logical and 
coherent thoughts.
Above all, be supportive and provide 
reassurance. People need to know  
that their problems have solutions.  
If problems are beyond a person’s 
capability to solve, explain how 
professional treatment can be  
obtained, through employee  
assistance programs, for  
example, or health plans.

Coaching and mentoring
Helping others develop
As a coach, a manager’s job is to help 
members of their team develop skills 
and improve. This involves providing 
instruction, guidance, advice, and 
encouragement. Effective coaches  
first establish a supportive climate  
that promotes development. It is 
particularly important that you remain 
nonjudgmental and understanding 
throughout the process, try to solve 
problems jointly, and educate those  
you are coaching about how to solve  
their own problems in the future. As  
you learn more about the person you  
are coaching, try to determine the 
sources of any problems you discover, 
and provide meaningful feedback.
Coaching is the process of helping people improve performance. A coach 
analyzes performance, provides insight on how to improve, and offers  
the leadership, motivation, and supportive climate to help achieve that 
improvement. In mentoring relationships, a more experienced person 
formally pairs up with a less experienced one to help show them  
“the ropes” and to provide emotional support and encouragement. 
Coaching a process
To coach successfully, you will need  
to follow these steps: 
•   Explain and then demonstrate  
the process.
•  Observe the person practicing  
the process
•  Provide immediate, specific 
feedback
•  Express confidence in the  
person’s ability
• Agree on follow-up actions. 
The role of a mentor 
Mentoring is a broader role. The goal of  
a mentor is to help a less experienced 
person achieve his or her career goals. 
Mentors perform as both coaches and 
counselors as they guide their less 
experienced associates toward improved 
performance. Mentoring can help new 
organization members gain a better 
understanding of the organization’s 
goals, culture, and advancement criteria. 
It can also help them become more 
politically savvy and avoid potential 
career traps. As a mentor, try to help 
others reduce the stress caused by 
uncertainty about how to do things and 
deal with challenging assignments. Be  
a source of comfort when newer, less 
experienced people just need to let off 
steam or discuss career dilemmas.

Managing careers
Charting your own career path
Self-assessment is an ongoing process 
in career management. Successful 
careers develop when people are 
prepared for opportunities because they 
know their strengths, their methods of 
work, and their values. Self-directed 
career management is a process by 
which individuals guide, direct, and 
influence the course of their careers. 
This requires exploration and  
awareness of not only yourself, but  
also your environment. Individuals 
who are proactive and collect relevant 
information about personal needs, 
values, interests, talents, and lifestyle 
preferences are more likely to be 
satisfied and productive when searching 
for job opportunities, to develop 
successful career plans, and to be 
productive in their jobs and careers.
In today’s rapidly changing business landscape, managers need  
to actively manage their careers and provide career guidance to  
those they are managing. To determine where and how you can best 
contribute, you need to know yourself, continually develop yourself,  
and be able to ascertain when and how to change the work you do.
Driving forward
The first step in self-directed career 
management is planning. Taking your 
strengths, limitations, and values into 
account, start searching the environment 
for matching opportunities. Use the 
information you gather to establish 
realistic career goals and then develop  
a strategy to achieve them. As you 
progress through your career plan, 
regularly undertake performance 
appraisals to make sure that you  
are remaining on track and that  
your goals haven’t changed.
Ensure that those you 
are managing have 
reasonable workloads

Individuals just beginning

After settling into a job, focus  
shifts to achieving initial successes, 
gaining credibility, learning to  
get along with their boss, and 
Directing others
The most important thing you can  
do to contribute to the career 
development of others is to instill in  
them the need to take responsibility for 
managing their own careers. Then you 
can provide support that will enable 
those you are managing to add to their 
skills, abilities, and knowledge, in order 
to maintain their employability within the 
organization. To help those you are 
managing develop their careers:
managing image. Managers in the 
middle of their careers are more 
concerned with career reappraisal, 
overcoming obsolescence owing  
to technological advances, and 
becoming more of a generalist.  
In the later stages of their careers, 
managers focus more on teaching 
others and leaving a contribution 
before retirement.
•   Keep your team updated about  
the organization’s goals and future 
strategies so that they will know 
where the organization is headed  
and be better able to develop a 
personal career development plan  
to share in that future.
•  Create growth opportunities for  
your team, to give them new, 
interesting, and professionally 
challenging work experiences.
•  Offer financial assistance, such as 
tuition reimbursement for college 
courses or skills training.
•  Allow paid time off from work for 
off-the-job training, and ensure  
that those you are managing have 
reasonable workloads so that they  
are not precluded from having time  
to develop new skills, abilities,  
and knowledge.

When you take up a leadership role, you will be expected

Defining the challenge
Thinking leadership
Leaders are made rather than born. And while a real 
desire to lead is a prerequisite for leadership, the key 
skills you need to lead can be learned. Leadership has 
many facets and no simple definition: it is the ability to 
inspire and encourage others to overcome challenges, 
accept continuous change, and achieve goals; it is  
the capacity to build strong, effective teams; and it  
is the process of using your influence to persuade  
and steer. Leaders set a strong example through their 
own life principles; they achieve results but also take 
responsibility for failure. A life principle may be a rule, 
belief, or moral code that is important to you and 
guides your decision-making throughout life.  
If you thrive on thinking creatively, inspiring and guiding people, 
experimenting with different approaches, and making intuitive 
decisions, you are on the way to being a leader. However,  
truly accomplished leaders also possess sound analytical  
and problem-solving skills.
BE AGILE
To be a good leader, stay close

judgment to move between 
leadership and management 
roles as necessary.

MANAGEMENT

DEFINING THE CHALLENGE  /    85
Leading and managing
Leadership is a substantially different 
role from management. A leader is 
someone who makes decisions and 
communicates bold messages, while  
a manager implements strategies, 
measures performance, and runs 
systems. You probably aspire to be 
called a leader rather than a manager. 
Being a leader is exciting; being a 
manager is mundane. Of course, like 
most stereotypes, the statements above 
contain a measure of truth, but sound 
management requires some leadership, 
and great leaders are—or at least know 
what it takes to be—good managers. 
When you move into a leadership 
role you won’t and can’t abandon 
managing altogether; to be credible as  
a leader, you need to acknowledge the 
past and what is currently happening, at 
the same time as focusing on the future.

Being a frontrunner
People respect leaders who embrace 
strong values and take responsibility  
for their own choices in life. To 
demonstrate this internal strength  
you need to be seen to be leading by 
example. Show your team that you  
have the confidence to take risks, that 
you can persist through difficult times, 
and that you are prepared to keep on 
learning, adapting, and creating new 
business opportunities. 
The job of a leader is to give others a sense of purpose and self-worth. 
This is impossible to do with any conviction if you don’t understand your 
own strengths and weaknesses, or if you are uncertain about the direction 
in which you want to take your professional and personal life. Improving 
self-awareness is an essential part of growing into a more effective 
leader and becoming alert to the effects you are having on others.

Knowing yourself
People don’t all think in the same way. 
Understanding your own thinking style 
and the styles of others around you  
will give you some valuable leadership 
tools. The term “thinking style” does not 
refer to your IQ, but how you process 
information; broadly we can distinguish 
between three styles: tactical, 
operational, and strategic. 
Most people tend to get stuck using 
just one of the thinking styles. But by 
recognizing your own thinking style you 
begin to ask different questions and think 
about problems in fresh and exciting  
new ways. By doing this you work more 
effectively with your team because you 
can understand how they think and 
communicate, and you can talk to people 
in their own “language.”
LIST YOUR SKILLS
Make a list of the essential 
characteristics you already 
have as a leader—“I am 
focused,” “I am committed  
to excellence,” “I respect 
others,” “I work hard”—and 
those to which you aspire: “I 
am caring,” “I am trusted.”

Applying self-knowledge
The benefits of self-knowledge in the 
workplace may not be immediately 
apparent when set alongside other,  
more practical and cognitive skills, but 
its value  has been acknowledged by 
psychologists for decades. The term 
Emotional Intelligence (EI) was coined  
to describe an ability to identify, 
discriminate between, and use one’s  
own and others’ feelings to guide your 
thoughts and actions. The importance of 
EI cannot be overstated—there are many 
studies that indicate that EI is a far better 
indicator of leadership potential than 
standard measures of intelligence  
such as IQ. The emotions that leaders 
experience affect the culture of an 
organization, shaping productivity, 
employee satisfaction, and loyalty, and 
so having a real influence on results. 
COMMIT TO CHANGE
Seek out an experienced coach 
to guide you in building EI. The 
transformation will entail 
changing your attitudes and 
habits, as well as learning  
new skills, and requires a  
real commitment—in time  
and resources—from you and 
from your organization.

Assessing the benefits
Understanding and controlling your  
inner self has some real applications  
that benefit you and the organization: 
•  Being able to control your temper, to 
elevate yourself from boredom, or  
to turn dejection into positive energy 
are all desirable abilities. 
•  Knowing that sad or negative moods 
tend to make you focus on details, 
while happy moods direct you to new 
ideas and solutions, improves your 
productivity, and time management.
•  Confronting and analyzing your fears 
may illuminate a problem you are 
facing, so this may lead to a solution 
and save you time. 
Expertise in the key competencies  
of Emotional Intelligence opens the  
door to more sophisticated ways of 
forming and sustaining productive 
relationships. What’s more, these 
competencies can be learned through 
training and practice. So you will be  
able to change your behavior in a 
genuine, sustained manner.

Leading through vision
Setting out the vision
Leaders focus on vision and overall aims 
and then help their team members as 
they try to interpret how to achieve the 
agreed objectives in a way consistent 
with the organization’s values.
 
Business vision is a word picture of 
your future as a team or organization.  
It describes what things will look like 
when we get to where we want to be.  
Your leadership role may be to create  
the vision and strategic objectives at the 
top of your organization, or it may be to 
develop your team plan in alignment with 
a bigger corporate strategy. 
Developing the vision 
Involve your team in developing the  
vision right from the start. Begin  
by writing it down. As you move  
forward, you will need to restate and 
re-create the vision by communicating 
with your team through open question  
and answer sessions, one-on-one 
reviews, and team meetings. Soon  
each person will learn how to make  
a meaningful individual contribution 
toward team goals. 
People are motivated by a clear 
understanding of what they need to  
do to fulfill the vision, by when, how  
well, and why. These are key signposts 
on the journey to their professional 
development and to the achievement  
of the team’s vision. Your job is to help 
everyone in your team plan the route, 
and to review their progress.
As a business leader, you will be expected to set out the values of an 
organization and provide its stakeholders with an emotionally appealing 
and achievable vision of the future. Clear, thoughtful communication at 
every level is needed in order to develop this vision and translate it into 
medium-term strategies and day-to-day action.
EXPLAIN WHY
“Why” needs to be explained  
in two ways: “Because of A…” 
(referring to a past/present 
reason) and “In order to do  
B…” (explaining possible  
future consequences).
Tip
JUST REWARDS
Think laterally about the way 
you reward members of your 
team. Financial rewards often

94    /    UNDERSTANDING LEADERSHIP
Growing with your role
Start-up
When an organization starts up, it is 
entrepreneurial—focused on delivering  
a new service to new customers. Often, 
communication is informal, and people 
are prepared to put in long hours. 
Customer feedback is quick and the 
small group of people responds rapidly 
with enthusiasm and energy. 
Leadership at this stage is about 
keeping close to customers and staff, 
and encouraging new ideas. As a leader, 
you may well be involved in frontline 
activities as well as decisions. 
Rapid growth
As the organization grows, you may  
start to see problems with the quality of 
delivery. Communication with the team 
may become more formal and some of 
the initial energy and initiative can be 
lost. More of your time will be spent on 
designing and implementing systems, 
structures, and standards. 
At this stage, you need to work hard at 
remaining accessible to people who seek 
your advice and resist retreating into a 
purely management role.
Growth is built in to the vision of most organizations; and when an 
organization grows, its leaders must be prepared to adapt with it.  
Your role as a leader may become bigger and more strategic with  
each organizational transition, so anticipating change is a cornerstone  
of thinking like an effective leader.

GROWING WITH YOUR ROLE    /    95
Devolution
As the organization continues to grow, 
you may become part of a high-level 
leadership team directing strategy and 
coordination, while a group of managers 
in business units lead teams on a 
devolved basis. 
You need to become a strong 
communicator because a significant  
part of your role is resolving tensions 
between devolved units and the center.  
You need to manage relationships to 
ensure that all parts of the organization 
work collaboratively and are fully 
committed to the overall strategy.  
Bear in mind the development of future 
leaders is essential to the long-term 
survival of the organization and is 
another one of your new responsibilities.
Continued growth
The next organizational transition occurs 
when you realize that you can no longer 
control everything—there are simply not 
enough hours in the day. You may notice 
that team members are complaining 
about how long it takes for decisions  
to be made. They may ask for greater 
freedom to make their own decisions. 
At this point, you should begin  
to recognize the need to delegate—
essential if you are to retain and develop 
staff. You should put more of your  
time and effort into leadership and 
communication and less into your 
original expertise—for example, 
accounting, sales, marketing, 
engineering, or operations. 
You should be putting 
increasing amounts 
of your time and effort  
into leadership  
and communication 

When you are given a leadership position, you need  
to prepare yourself for intense learning and adaptation.  
From getting your feet under the desk to developing  
your competencies, there are many challenges in store.

Preparing to lead
Giving yourself a head start
It pays to prepare for your leadership 
role even before your first day on the  
job. Do some basic groundwork and 
research: ask your employer where you 
fit into their organizational plans; ask 
when you will be expected to produce 
objectives for your team; and when and 
how your performance—and that of your 
team—will be assessed. If possible, ask 
to meet the outgoing leader and discuss 
the demands of the role and the team 
dynamics. Research your team: request 
performance figures and personnel files; 
ask the outgoing leader and your peers 
what information will be of most use. 
Managing data
Throughout the first few weeks in your 
new role, you will be deluged with 
information. Unfortunately, you won’t 
necessarily know which of this data is of 
strategic importance, and which is just  
minor detail. Head off early errors by 
being systematic; file the information 
and make a list of everything you have 
received. Review this list weekly and try 
to place the relative significance of each 
piece of information in a broader context. 
When you become a leader, you need to quickly understand what is 
expected from you and from your team. Your employer will provide  
you with guidance, but don’t assume that you’ll get the complete  
picture. A lot of the groundwork is going to be up to you.
Ask your employer  
where you fit into their 
organizational plans

PREPARING TO LEAD  /    99
Managing people
You’ll also be introduced to many new 
people throughout the organization. Always 
carry a notebook and pencil with you; after 
each meeting, make a note of the name, 
position, and distinguishing features of the 
person you have met, along with anything 
memorable they said to you. When  
you meet them next, you’ll remember  
who they are and how they fit into the 
organization. What’s more, you’ll be able 
to pick up your conversation with them.

Being realistic
Your arrival as a team’s new leader will 
raise expectations of change for the 
better. However, you may discover that 
some expectations are less than realistic. 
For example, your team’s previous leader 
may have provided detailed guidance  
on how work should be carried out; if 
your leadership style is more about 
empowering your team to make their  
own decisions, they may initially feel 
poorly supported and even resentful  
of the added responsibility. Early in your 
tenure, ask others what assumptions 
they have about you and your role. 
•  Outline what success looks like to you. 
Does their view match yours? 
•  What expectations do they have of how 
long things will take?
•  Have they been made any unrealistic 
promises about what you will deliver? 
You can then begin to address any 
discrepancies between their expectations 
and your reality. 
Are you ready 
for anything?
What are the aims of your 
organization or team? 
Who are your key stakeholders?
Are there potential problems?
 What are the processes, culture,  
and structure of the organization?
How are internal systems audited?
Are your findings complete 
and accurate?

As a leader, you are likely to be inundated with communications, 
requests, new tasks, and initiatives. Recognizing—and focusing on—

Managing your time
It is easy to get distracted from key  
tasks by less important, but nonetheless 
urgent activities. Prioritizing your actions 
is something you should schedule in 
every day, and approach with discipline. 
A simple solution is to write a “to do” list

vision, values, and key objectives; then, 
number each item in order of priority.

Delegating successfully
Delegation is a critical leadership skill, 
and one that—when done well—has 
great benefits for you and your team.  
It liberates your schedule, makes 
members of your team feel valued,  
and develops capabilities in people 
throughout the organization. Delegating 
well requires more than just handing  
a task over to a subordinate, there are 
many issues you need to consider 
carefully before you act.

Milestones/reviews 
Selecting personnel
To identify the best member of your 
team to take on a particular task, try 
using a “Plan to Delegate” table, such 
as the sample at right, to give a degree 
of objectivity when making a decision. 
To use the Plan to Delegate table: 
•  List all members of your team.
•  Devise your criteria for choosing 
someone—those on the sample 
table are a good starting point.
•  Rate each member of your team for 
all criteria from 1–10. 
•  Add the scores.
•  Add comments on the amount and 
type of training, development, or 
support each individual needs. 
When you carry out this exercise, the 
best fit candidate is not always the 
most obvious. You may have developed 
the habit of just asking one experienced 
and skilled team member to do jobs for 
you. However, others on the team may 
have more time to devote to the task, 
and will benefit from the experience 
and responsibility.

Working at relationships
Telling stories
We each carry in our heads our own 
stories—the narratives we have 
constructed over the years to make 
sense of our collected experiences, 
emotions, habits, and thoughts.  
These stories bias our perspective  
in all new situations and may push  
us toward embracing the future  
or—conversely—constrain our actions.
Relationships are built by exchanging 
these stories with other people we meet. 
As we tell our stories, we disclose more 
about ourselves, our backgrounds, roles, 
and beliefs—and create new, emergent 
stories. Just as individuals have their 
own stories, so do organizations;  
these stories encompass the history  
and values of that organization and 
describe how they get things done. 
From your earliest days as a leader, you will need to build relationships 
with your team and a range of stakeholders throughout the organization. 
The ability to understand and influence people is a key skill, and thinking 
of relationships in terms of “stories” gives you some tools to analyze 
and control your interactions.
Do the stories convey  
a strong moral code, 
judgments, or beliefs?
Relationships are built by 
exchanging stories. Just  
as individuals have their own 
stories, so do organizations

WORKING AT RELATIONSHIPS    /    109
Listening to stories
By listening analytically to a 
person’s story, you may be able 
to understand why they want to 
work with you and what their 
motivations are likely to be. 
Stories also point to ways of 
negotiating successfully with 
individuals or companies, and 
even indicate whether a joint 
venture may succeed. Leaders 
who fail to take full account of a 
person’s or an organization’s 
past thoughts, culture, actions, 
and aspirations—as well as 
what they observe in the present 
moment—can find themselves 
facing a culture clash they had 
not anticipated.
LISTEN TO THE 
SUBTEXT 
Listen for recurrent patterns 
in peoples’ stories. What  
do they tell you about the  
way they relate to others, 
their modes of thinking, 
biases, and barriers?
Tip
Do the stories place the 
individual in a particular 
role—hero, participant, or 
victim, for example?
Are the stories explorative and 
adventurous, or conservative, focused on 
maintaining equilibrium?
Do the stories make or break 
connections between things?
Are the stories mostly 
set in the past, present, 
or future?
Do the stories express 
themselves in 
protective jargon? 
Do the stories 
claim particular 
skills for the 
individual? 

110    /    TAKING UP YOUR LEADERSHIP ROLE
•  I win, you win  This person wants to 
collaborate. He or she is concerned 
for both parties’ needs and wants  
to reach consensus or use lateral 
thinking to explore a better solution  
so that everyone wins. Leaders  
and organizations like this are  
good at building new narratives  
about new possibilities.
Learning from stories
By listening to the stories told by 
people—and by organizations—you  
can gain an insight into what types of 
relationships they will tend to form. 
By understanding the very nature  
of the relationship, you will be able  
to modify your own behavior to the  
best advantage. Most people—and 
indeed organizations—tend to fit  
into one of four main categories  
of relationship-building:
•  I win, you lose  This person has a  
need to control or compete. Their  
main reason for wanting a relationship 
with you is to achieve their own goals.  
Their concern is primarily for their 
own interests and they will bargain  
you down so that they achieve more.
•  I lose, you win  This person needs  
to belong and will prioritize the 
relationship above their own interests. 
They will always try to accommodate 
your wishes if you state them clearly 
and offer goodwill gestures.
•  I lose, you lose  This person has a 
strong desire to avoid conflict—indeed 
this is their primary concern in any 
relationship. They may focus on  
trivial issues to avoid areas of 
potential disagreement. 
KEEP TALKING 
Keep dialogue open with  
all stakeholders. Sound 
relationships—and new 
stories—are built layer  
by layer through a series  
of conversations that ask 
questions as well as  
offering answers.

Analyzing stakeholders
Pinpointing key relationships
You cannot hope to forge a strong 
relationship with everyone in your 
organization. As a leader, you need  
to concentrate your efforts on key 
stakeholders—those people who have 
the biggest investment in a project, or 
whose influence can help or hinder 
progress. To identify key stakeholders, 
start by asking yourself and your team 
who will gain or lose the most from your 
actions, and who is in a position to affect 
success. Be sure to consider internal and 
external parties, including suppliers, 
customers, directors, and in-house 
departments. Next, plot all the 
stakeholders on a chart, similar to  
that below, so you can more clearly 
assess the importance and type of 
relationship you should establish  
with each type of stakeholder.

Using competencies
Emulating the greats
Bookstores are lined with the biographies of famous 
leaders that tell us how they acted and dealt with 
adversity. A lesson that emerges from their life 
stories is that you lead from who you are. To lead 
effectively, you must be comfortable in your own 
skin and live a life according to your own principles. 
So, as much as you may admire Gandhi or Che 
Guevara, you can’t copy them—this will give rise  
to inconsistent behaviors that will be interpreted  
as indecisiveness or insincerity.
Setting objective targets
A more realistic way to shape your aims as a leader 
is through competencies. These short describers 
set out the behaviors we would like to see in 
ourselves as leaders. Competencies define what 
effective performance as a leader looks like and—
through self-assessment and feedback—help 
leaders to identify their development needs. You  
can refer to and use a standard set of leadership 
competencies to review your current performance 
and set objectives, or devise your own after carrying  
out suitable research and consultation.
How can you define what you need to become an effective leader? You 
may get some inspiration from the lives of great business, political, and 
military leaders of the past. However, a more reliable way of shaping 
your objectives is to use competencies—descriptions of performance 
outputs that characterize leadership in your organization.
Competencies define

performance as  
a leader looks like 
and help leaders

development needs

USING COMPETENCIES  /    113
Writing your own competencies
Using a set of standard competencies—
such as on the next pages—to define 
leadership roles may well be appropriate 
to you. Alternatively, you can identify  
and list competencies by learning from 
others’ experience—this is just one of the 
many benefits of joining a professional 
body for managers or leaders. The  
best option, however, would involve 
developing your own competencies—
ones that would accurately target your 
company’s objectives and values.
PUTTING COMPETENCIES  
TO WORK
The Chartered Institute of Personnel 
and Development (CIPD), a leading 
professional institute in the UK, 
wanted to define the behaviors of an 
effective leader. With involvement of 
the management team and a cross 
section of staff from all departments, 
eight core leadership competencies 
were identified and published in an 
internal document. A five-year 
leadership development program 
was designed to develop managers’ 
competencies. Development 
reviews, feedback, and self-
assessment, measured the 
progress of managers through  
a wide range of activities. The 
program included tailored 
workshops, case studies, action 
learning sets, executive coaching, 
and cross-functional projects that 
developed leadership and helped  
the organization move forward its 
strategic plan.

use them to develop your organization’s 
leaders. The main vehicles for this are 
formal appraisals and self-assessment: 
•  Make sure the leader knows  
and fully understands what the 
competencies are.
•  Appoint a “competencies advocate”—
someone to encourage the leader  
to use the competencies as a 
development tool.
•  Agree the competencies to be used  
in appraisals.
•  Train appraisers throughout your 
organization in the meaning and  
use of competencies. 
•  Encourage self-assessment  
against the benchmarks set  
by the competencies.
When being assessed in an appraisal  
or carrying out self-assessment, it  
is helpful to recognize four stages of 
progress toward competency in a given 
area. So, for example, if you were to 
assess development in the competency 
“Solving problems and taking decisions,” 
the results may be as shown below.

Providing feedback
Opening the dialogue
Giving feedback is not just about telling 
someone what you think. It is a two-way 
process that involves listening, asking 
questions, gaining commitment to 
change, summarizing what has been 
covered, and clarifying understanding. 
Feedback can be given informally in 
reviews or in quick one-to-one meetings. 
Many organizations also provide 
planned appraisals—regular, formal 
opportunities for the exchange of 
feedback that can include reviews  
of performance, development, or both. 
Appraisals happen at least annually and 
are usually between the line manager 
The ability to both give and receive feedback is an essential leadership 
skill. Giving feedback encourages development and innovative thinking 
in your team, while knowing how to receive feedback provides an 
opportunity to learn more about yourself as a leader and the effect  
your behavior has on others.
LISTEN WELL  
Be open in any feedback 
sessions. Other people will

in the same way as you, so 
listen to their suggestions.

and team member although they can 
include others. Feedback from your  
boss, your team members, peers, and 
customers is termed “360° feedback”; 
when segments are omitted (for example, 
feedback from customers and peers),  
the term is “180° feedback.” Take time to 
prepare for a feedback session. Book a 
private room to ensure no interruptions. 
Always start positively, talk about the 
recipient’s achievements: encourage 
them to talk about what has gone well. 
Avoid the tendency to focus more on 
mistakes they might have made than 
their strengths; make sure the positive 
feedback outweighs developmental 
points you bring up by at least 2:1.

to build on except their 
feelings of resentment.

Preparing to give feedback
Being specific 
Feedback needs to be specific. Deal with 
one issue at a time rather than trying  
to tackle a number of issues at once.  
Be clear and direct in your comments:  
for example, “The way you gave the 
information and drew the diagram was 
really helpful to the customer,” or “At 
that moment, I thought the customer  
was feeling uncomfortable because you 
seemed to be imposing your values, not 
just giving facts.” General comments, 
such as “You were brilliant!” or “That 
was awful!” do not give the recipient  
any opportunities for learning. 
Being realistic
Be realistic when using feedback—only 
refer to actions or behaviors that the 
person is able to change. You may have  
to start with small steps: for example,  
“It would help if you smiled more when 
you speak. I’m sure this would help our 
customers to feel really cared for.” Gain 
agreement from each person on small 
goals, and praise people for having 
reached the standards you have 
previously defined. 
Skilled feedback gives people 
information about their behavior and 
leaves them with a choice about how  
and if to act on it—change that is 
imposed too heavily will invite some 
degree of resistance. Finally, always  
ask the recipient to summarize the 
actions they are going to take as a  
result of feedback—this helps you  
to double-check their understanding  
and commitment to change.

Getting SMART—setting realistic objectives
Giving formal appraisals 
When giving a formal appraisal, never 
show boredom or interrupt. If you find 
that you are talking more than the 
person being appraised, rethink your 
tactics. Use open questions—ones that 
demand more than a “Yes” or “No” 
answer—to find out what someone is 
thinking or feeling. The best questions 
often start with “What...?” because they 
make the fewest assumptions about 
the response, so try: 
•  What went well? 
•  What have we learned? 
Identify activities and training that will 
develop the individual in their current 
role and prepare them for the future. 
Make clear the business case for  
any investment in development and 
training—does it help meet business, 
team, and individual objectives?

Setting SMART objectives 
Take time to review the individual’s achievements 
since their last appraisal and establish SMART 
objectives (see below) for the period until  
the next appraisal. Agree with them how and  
when you will measure change. There are many 
measurement tools at your disposal, including: 
observation; discussion during appraisals;  
informal one-to-one reviews; team meetings; 
examination of business results; other key 
performance indicators; surveys; and assessment 
against your organization’s competencies. 
Closing the appraisal
At the end of the appraisal, it is your turn as leader  
to ask for any feedback that might be helpful to your 
working relationship. Be sure to follow up on any 
support and training you have offered and review 
progress against agreed milestones. Throughout

Learning from feedback
Seeking the truth
Once you have learned to both give  
and receive feedback skillfully and 
constructively, you will be ready to lead 
your team to greater self-awareness and 
higher levels of performance.
You can ask for feedback (formally  
or informally) from any of the people  
you come into contact with on a daily 
basis—members of your team, your 
superiors, clients, or suppliers. 
The following series of questions  
is a good starting point for discussion 
with your appraiser, especially when  
you ask them to back up their answers 
with real examples: 
•  What do you see as my strengths?
•  What do you think I am blind to?
•  What development areas do you think 
I should be focusing on?
•  What should I do less of/more of?
•  What potential do you see in me?
•  Or, if you are using competencies to  
set and monitor your targets, try the 
following phrasing: 
•  Which competencies do I consistently 
demonstrate? (Enclose a copy of  
your competencies) 
•  Which competencies do you think I 
could go on developing further?
•  What changes do you foresee  
in the next 12 months and on which 
competencies do you think I should  
be focusing my development?
When you seek out and receive feedback, you develop your character  
as a leader. The two-way process of disclosing things about yourself  
and receiving comments on your performance builds trust. This in turn 
reduces the gap between your public and private faces and increases  
the authenticity of your leadership.
RUNNING 360° FEEDBACK
Ideally the 360° process should be managed by  
an objective external coach to ensure high-quality 
feedback, a balanced viewpoint, and anonymity  
for those individuals brave enough to give feedback 
on their boss. However, if your organizational culture  
is open, and all agree to a no-blame approach, the 
review could be carried out internally.
In focus

LEARNING FROM FEEDBACK   /    123
A questionnaire, set out like a customer 
satisfaction survey, will help provide  
a consistent format for the replies. 
When you receive feedback  
from others, compare it with your 
evaluation of yourself. Which leadership 
competencies are your strengths? Which 
are your development areas? Which  
key competencies did you find the most 
challenging last year and which will  
be even more demanding next year? 
Note the key development areas 
and think how you can broaden 
or deepen your knowledge, 
skills, or practice—for 
example reading up on a 
topic or attending a course. 
In addition to providing 
valuable insight into others’ 
perceptions of your leadership, 
360° feedback is an invaluable 
tool for helping you prepare for 
your appraisal discussion with 
your manager or mentor.
Becoming a rounded leader
A more formal means of gaining 
information about yourself—or any 
individual in your team—from a number 
of sources is 360° feedback. Ask a 
selection of 4–8 people at different levels 
in your organization to comment on the 
leadership behaviors they have observed 
you demonstrating over the last year. If 
appropriate, ask them to consider this 
against your stated competencies.

Developing yourself
Reflecting and reviewing
The best way to accelerate your own 
development and increase awareness  
of yourself and of others is through 
regular review and reflection. Put aside 
an hour every week for self-analysis  
and contemplation.
Start by reviewing your current 
development needs. Ask yourself how 
much of your activity the preceding week 
contributed to achieving your stated 
vision and objectives. Next, look at  
your future development needs and 
assess your progress against your  
stated leadership competencies. Finally, 
consider the ideas you have for the next 
steps in your career; are you honing the 
skills now that you know will be needed 
for your career progress?
In this action-oriented world, many of us devote insufficient time and 
energy to our own development. Yet dedicated time for self-development 
is absolutely essential when it comes to growing your character and your 
own individual brand of leadership, as well as the attitudes, skills, and 
behaviors that will exemplify leadership to others.
LISTEN TO YOURSELF
Review your own progress  
by questioning yourself:  
are you building on your 
strengths and minimizing your 
weaknesses? Are you training 
your team and delegating to 
them successfully? Are you 
scheduling time to develop 
key relationships?
Tip
YOUR LONG-TERM 
DEVELOPMENT
As you mature as a leader,  
you will need to undertake 
weekly reviews of your  
own development and 
achievements. However,  
you should also take time  
to think about your long-term 
goals, and your progress 
toward them. How well are  
you living up to your life 
principles? How have you  
dealt with disappointment  
and adversity? Have you 
managed to increase your  
level of performance? Have  
you fulfilled commitments  
to yourself and others? Are 
you happy in your career? 
What are your next steps?  
The more you learn, the  
more you realize you  
still have to learn. At  
this point, you might  
consider seeking advice  
from a career counselor.

DEVELOPING YOURSELF    /    125
Journaling
Great leaders possess self-awareness 
and character—attributes acquired 
through reflection and self-analysis,  
but also through dealing regularly  
with real-life situations. Using a private 
journal to write down what you have 
learned about yourself in your day-to- 
day life can be very helpful. Record, for 
example, how you have helped someone 
else develop and learn, and how this has 
honed your own strengths as a leader. 
Use your journal to make personal 
observations about how you respond to 
different conditions—what happens when 
you are tired or stressed? The pages  
of the journal can help you record and 
work through relationships that you are 
enjoying or struggling with, and to reflect 
on the highs and lows of your moods that 
you could not reveal in the workplace.
At first, journaling may seem like  
a chore; and initially your journal may not 
contain many connections or life lessons. 
But after a number of weeks, you’ll find 
that journaling becomes a habit that gives 
structure to your review and thinking 
time. Looking back over your journal  
will reveal how your leadership has 
developed, how you can trust yourself, 
even in difficult situations, and what  
are the recurring issues.
KEEP YOUR FEET ON 
THE GROUND  
Never become so grand  
that you lose touch with  
what it feels like to work  
with a customer on a project 
or to make a sale. Recognize 
that your role is now to help 
others enjoy this too.

Balancing work and life
Attending to different needs
Good leaders know their team, their 
capabilities, and what motivates them. 
The real skill, though, is being able to  
use this knowledge to balance the needs 
of the task, the team, and the individual 
team members.
Maintaining this equilibrium is  
not always easy, because emphasis 
inevitably shifts from one area to another. 
For example, bursts of intense effort 
may be needed to meet tight deadlines—
fine once in a while, but exhausting  
on a regular basis. 
Maintaining standards
Similarly, the leader may sometimes 
have to focus on one member of the  
team who is not pulling their weight, or 
perhaps finding certain tasks difficult; 
absolving them from obtaining agreed 
team standards for no obvious reason  
is clearly not acceptable.
Most people would say that they want to be healthy, happy, and make  
a valued contribution at work to a successful organization. Creating and 
maintaining this sense of well-being is an integral part of your role as a 
leader. It involves taking a measured view of the balance between work 
and life and having realistic expectations of your team.
ACCENTUATE  
THE POSITIVE  
Promote a healthy work–life 
balance and you’ll not only 
avoid the pitfalls of stress

business. Happy staff deliver 
better results and empathetic 
customer service; staff 
retention and recruitment 
then become easier.

Managing stress
If you have built a strong team during

short-term pressures, but you may

and calm tensions to maintain balance. 
Your goal should be to keep your team 
members stretched and working to their 
best ability, but not stressed. Remember 
that stresses are cumulative: a team 
member may be able to tolerate stress 
at work for a short while if the other 
aspects of their life are running well. 
However, if stress in the workplace is 
only one of many issues a team member 
is dealing with at the same time, then 
problems may arise that you should 
acknowledge and discuss.

Inspiring and encouraging 
Setting a good example
One of the basic rules of leadership is that 
in order to inspire others you must aspire 
to be a model of excellence yourself. Your 
personal journey toward excellence will 
never end, but it will give you two vital 
qualities—the desire to learn, and, in turn, 
that will lead to the humility of knowing 
how much more you have to learn. 
Your role is all about providing 
inspiration, and that starts with a  
clear vision for a better future, which  
you will need to communicate to  
your team on a daily basis through  
your words and actions:
•  Make it clear to others that they have 
the capability and power to make a 
difference—that their unique 
attributes can help achieve the vision. 
•  Bring hope for the future to sustain 
people through change and adversity; 
if people feel overwhelmed and slow 
down, bring them back to the vision 
with simple messages that show the 
next small steps forward. 
•  Point out progress made and signs of 
success on the way to fill people once 
again with confidence and the desire 
to go forward. 
•  Praise new ideas and the courage 
demonstrated in new ventures.
•  Keep team members stretched— 
one step ahead of what they thought 
they could do.
•  Keep positive: explain that most 
experiments that do not work are not 
failures—just feedback; turn setbacks 
into positive impetus for change.
From the way they formulate and express their overarching vision to  
the thought that they put into everyday interactions, which is the glue  
of any team relationship, you will find that leaders encourage and 
inspire others around them at every level of activity.

interaction you have. Give them your  
full attention whether you are speaking 
face-to-face or on the phone. Be 
dependable in your daily interactions: 
your consistency builds trust and peace 
of mind in your team members, freeing 
them to focus on their key tasks rather 
than worrying about you.
Focusing on the now
Inspiring people is less about delivering 
impassioned speeches and having a 
forceful personality, and more about 
focus and consistency. Treat everyone 
you deal with as a valued customer. 
Place them at the center of your 
universe for the duration of any 
Taking opportunities
Think how many opportunities you have in a single 
day to interact with your team, colleagues, bosses, 
and other stakeholders. Over 100 contacts a day—by 
phone, email, face-to-face, etc.—is not unusual for 
today’s busy leaders and managers. Each of these 
interactions is an opportunity to encourage, inspire, 
and make your leadership felt.
When you make every meeting count, you create 
thousands of potential advocates for you, your team, 
your vision, and your organization. Moments add up 
to real commercial gain.

Focusing on the future
Making decisions
Leaders set the agenda in three key 
areas—by determining the direction in 
which the organization will move, by 
shaping how the organization does 
business, and by setting the pace of 
change. Any decisions you make in any  
of these three key areas should be based 
on objective criteria; for example, in a 
choice between two equally attractive 
options that require large investment, 
you should be able to explain why your 
own decision was the best one in the 
circumstances. Test your decision by 
assessing its strengths, weaknesses, 
opportunities, and threats (SWOT). 
As a leader, you’ll need to make tough decisions, plan a course of action, 
and take your team with you. The best way to achieve this is to involve 
your team from the start: explain what criteria your judgment is based 
upon and how plans are connected to other activities in the organization.
Locating change
Deciding which opportunities to explore, 
exploit, and reject requires a crystal clear 
understanding of your organization’s 
purpose and mission. In particular, you 
must know what gives your business its 
edge over the competition and use this 
knowledge to guide your future focus. 
Competitive advantage is based on what 
customers value and the organization’s 
strengths relative to the competition. It 
takes into account external trends that  
will help or hinder momentum. In a SWOT 
analysis, internal factors are strengths 
and weaknesses, while external issues 
are opportunities and threats.

satisfy. Not all criteria are  
of equal importance, so give 
each one a score from 1 to 10 
depending on how valuable the 
team considers it to be. Check 
that the criteria are varied—not 
all skewed toward finance, for 
example. Score each option (A 
and B) out of 10 on each 
criterion, and multiply each 
score by its corresponding 
weighting. Add the scores to 
see which project fulfills the 
criteria best.

Strategic 
Business Plan
Setting the pace
When orchestrating strategic change 
within an organization, you need to give 
careful consideration to timing. If the 
rate of change is too slow, the process 
may simply run out of momentum;  
if it is too fast, you risk creating  
stress and burnout. 
Aim for a sustainably fast pace  
at which your major initiatives will  
have started to produce measurable 
results within a year—even if the  
whole process is scheduled to take 
much longer. Steering significant 
organizational change is hard work:

Keep listening to everyone you are 
connected to; share ideas, and keep 
open channels of communication  
that are needed now and may be 
needed in the future.
Tip

typically, there is a trough in visible 
results just at the point where you  
need the most effort and commitment 
from all stakeholders. Investors, in 
particular, may lose heart in this trough 
period, so need to be reminded regularly 
of the benefits to come. Plan in “quick 
wins” throughout the process of 
change—achievements that have  
high visibility but require little  
effort. Celebrate and publicize these 
successes, and drip-feed messages 
about how project milestones and 
results achieved so far are bringing  
the vision nearer to reality.

Integrating change
Everything in an organization is 
connected. Processes and systems  
in one area impact on others. As a  
leader, you should make explicit the 
connections between different plans  
and explain how each one contributes  
to the vision. Understanding the bigger 
picture will help your team recognize 
their role and commit to change. The 
message can be a complex one, so 
communicate little and often, and  
check regularly how well people have 
understood the connections between 
plans, departments, and roles.

Enabling change
Balancing priorities
A key leadership skill is keeping a  
good balance between short-term 
improvement and long-term innovation. 
If you are continuously improving at  
the margins while neglecting strategic 
innovation, it will lead to organizational 
myopia and the risk of missing out on  
the next big trend. Conversely, constant 
innovation at the core can become 
counterproductive because people will 
eventually feel worn out and unwilling to 
take on yet another new initiative. 
Maintaining stability
The leader seeks to progress with both 
short- and long-term change while 
maintaining equilibrium. This can be a 
challenge: while most people will quickly 
accommodate small steps that visibly 
improve the way things are done, bold 
strategic innovation requires the leader 
to inspire people, sometimes for many 
years, before seeing a return. Before 
implementing change, discuss its 
implications with multiple small groups 
of stakeholders. People should feel  
free to ask questions and express their 
concerns. Help people to see what will 
remain the same—these things can 
provide an anchor of stability for those 
who dislike change.
Opportunities for innovation exist at every level of an organization, and 
leaders must continuously plan change to move forward and stay ahead 
of competitors. Processes, systems, skills, and competencies can 
always be improved, or the whole business can be moved in an entirely 
new direction. Leading change requires a sense of balance between 
priorities and keen awareness of responses among all stakeholders.

ENABLING CHANGE    /    139
Adjusting to plans 
As leader, you need to use both logic and 
emotion when explaining your plans. Be 
persistent and emphasize to everyone 
the benefits to come when the changes 
have been made.   
People take different lengths of time 
to adjust to change and you should 
prepare for the long haul: typically, the 
adjustment process falls into distinct 
phases, which are characterized by 
different sets of behaviors. Be aware  
that people who adopt change quickly can 
show impatience with the slowest; this 
can lead to conflict within the team, which 
you may be called upon to help resolve. 
Reacting to change
People react differently to change. At  
one extreme are the innovators who  
may be so eager to walk toward a new 
future that they do not realize that no  
one has followed them. At the other  
end are the stragglers, who join in only 
when everyone else has moved on. 
Traditionalists hang on to the past, 
viewing change as a threat. Surprisingly, 
they have one thing in common with  
the innovators—they respond with 
emotion to the impending change. The 
remainder—the cautious majority—are 
likely to weigh up the arguments put 
across on the basis of reason.
EXPECT DISSENT 
When you introduce  
high-level change, expect  
at least 50 percent of your 
people to hate the idea.

Energizing the team
Choosing your team
Selecting team members who will work together 
well, motivating the group, and dealing with conflict 
are the essential aspects of team leadership. And as 
increasing amounts of work are project-based, you 
need to develop team cohesion and focus quickly 
despite rapid changes in the mix of the team. 
Invest time at the start of a project to choose  
or strengthen the team; your investment will be 
repaid later in the project cycle when the group 
comes under pressure. Select team members with 
complementary skills and talents that come into play 
at different stages of a project. As a minimum, your 
team should have a good mix of the following thinking 
styles listed below. If the team is small, members 
may need to be able to fill more than one of the roles.
When you put together a group of people—anywhere between two and 
several thousand—you won’t automatically get a team. For a group to 
become a team, it must be energized and focused and it must think of 
success as a collective rather than individual aim. Carrying out this 
transformation is your job as a leader.  
The leader—ensures everyone understands the objectives; 
motivates and communicates.
The creator—an imaginative thinker who has bold concepts at  
the outset of a project and provides ideas when the team is stuck.
The analyst—the problem-solver who tests the plan at every stage.
The facilitator—has good interpersonal skills, is sensitive to  
the group dynamic, and acts as the “glue” in a team.
The administrator—pays attention to details  
and keeps the team on time and focused on the task.

Running your team
Make clear the roles that each individual 
will play in the team. Devolve decision-
making to the group as far as possible, 
and encourage everyone to participate in 
decisions—this will share the ownership 
of goals. Set out shared values, develop 
ground rules that describe how the team 
will work together from the start, and 
watch the way that group dynamics 
develop; take action immediately at the 
first sign of conflict or if an individual 
starts to act in a way not consistent with 
the agreed team rules.

Leading difficult people
Dealing with conflict
Conflict arises when people stop listening 
and approach a situation from their own 
point of view. As leader, you must look 
beyond the immediate confrontation to 
understand what is really happening and 
discover the roots of the hostility. 
Begin with yourself: your role means 
you may be a factor in a team member‘s 
dissatisfaction. Differences in outlook, 
behavior, and style can lead to tension—
which can be used constructively to 
stimulate creativity and enrich the team 
or, if left unmanaged, can cause division.
Meeting standards
It is tempting to work around a “difficult” 
person, but this undermines the team  
and your position as leader. You should 
explore all courses of action to bring about 
improvement. However, many people find 
adversarial situations hard and may 
sabotage their own future if they do not 
see a way out. If open discussion and 
support fails to achieve changes, you will 
need to work within your organization’s 
disciplinary policy and procedures to 
deal with the person, and prevent an 
adverse effect on the rest of the team. 
Building a successful team depends on cooperation between all 
members of the group. But what if an individual just won‘t play ball? 
Unproductive confrontations with you as leader or between team 
members can take a lot of your time, create a bad atmosphere, and  
stop you from achieving your aims, so finding positive ways to deal  
with disagreement or difficult individuals is a key leadership skill.

Balancing targets
Getting the right results
The targets you set for your team should 
stretch everyone but also be realistic,  
in line with the SMART criteria. Ensure 
that the aims you set are balanced; 
alongside financial targets, include  
goals in areas such as speed of response, 
product and service quality, customer 
and team satisfaction, and brand 
development. List the desired results  
in each of four key areas—customers, 
operations, people, and finance—so that 
no one objective takes assumed priority 
over another. Review results in each  
area monthly so that you can prove 
progress to yourself, your team, and  
your investors. 
Setting service level 
agreements
Clarify the results you expect from 
interactions between purchasers and 
providers or between departments in a 
service level agreement. You can then 
present the obligations in a written 
format—minimum or maximum 
standards and timescales, or other 
measures of reliability or availability,  
for example:  
•  Our obligations: to provide you with 
information within four hours of 
request, etc. 
•  Your obligations: to respond to service 
requests within four hours of phone 
call inquiry, etc. 
Results are what it’s all about. They are the synthesis of all your 
thinking, planning, and enabling as a leader. To get what you want  
from a project, you should clarify standards and objectives from  
the outset. Your targets need to be realistic, and they also require  
a means of measuring the performance of all involved.

Improving confidence
Being prepared
Confidence can come in a number  
of different ways. It comes from 
experience as your track record as a 
leader improves. It comes from having 
well-formed plans and anticipating 
challenges, and it comes from the 
knowledge that you have a strong 
business built on productive  
working relationships. 
Confidence is a cornerstone of good leadership. Especially in times of 
uncertainty, upheaval, or crisis, believing in yourself and making the 
right decisions will give you credibility and integrity, which in turn will 
enhance the organization’s reputation and build trust in all stakeholders.
BOOST YOURSELF 
Regularly affirm your own 
strengths as a leader by 
privately listing your abilities 
and achievements. This will give 
you an instant confidence boost 
and banish that internal critic 
living in your head.
Tip
COMMUNICATING WITH CONFIDENCE
While there are no shortcuts to building confidence, there are ways that 
you can project confidence to your team and to your stakeholders. 
>
>  Consider giving your new vision a badge—a look or a logo to 
symbolize the change you want to happen. By implication, those who 
use the new language or adopt the new symbols share the leader’s 
vision and have committed to the change.
>
>  Deliver your vision messages in sound bites no more than 30 seconds 
long that sum up the benefits of the opportunities you wish to explore. 
>
>  Use confident language to describe your vision. Listen and learn 
from political leaders, who characteristically employ optimistic 
language that suggests a future state—words such as “innovative,” 
“special,” “original,” “latest,” “breakthrough,” “updated,” and 
“leading-edge.” Used regularly, this kind of vocabulary spreads 
through the organization. 

IMPROVING CONFIDENCE    /    149
Acknowledging ideas
Your inner confidence will grow when you 
behave in a confident manner and gain 
the trust of your team and colleagues.  
An ability and a willingness to devolve 
power and decision-making is one vital 
characteristic that marks out a confident 
leader, so take every opportunity to 
involve others and empower them  
to act on their ideas. Be open about what 
is not working for you, your customers, 
suppliers, or employees; your frankness 
will be interpreted as an expression  
of confidence because you approach 
success and adversity with equal zeal. 
Encourage people to discover and 
understand situations for themselves 
rather than spoon-feeding them issues 
and answers—remember your power 
increases as you give it away. 
Being consistent
As a leader, your every word and action  
is scrutinized by your team and could  
be given far more significance than  
you intended. Perceptions of you as a 
confident leader can be undermined  
by conscious or unconscious slips, so  
try and think in a measured way about 
the kind of signals you are sending out. 
Consistency and calmness in adversity 
are characteristics that most people  
will perceive as confidence.
FACE YOUR FEARS 
Confidence comes  
from self-knowledge; 
understanding your thoughts 
and actions gives you the 
ability to control them.  
A good way to become more 
self-assured is to face your 
fears—do that presentation, 
confront your difficult CEO, 
and reply to that demanding 
client—now!

What marks out entrepreneurs is  
their preparedness to listen to their 
customers, see new opportunities,  
and back their ideas with drive and 
determination. They also have a 
refreshing attitude to “failure”—
everything is viewed as a useful 
experience, and trial and error is  
seen as a legitimate path to success. 
Entrepreneurs think ahead, don’t  
accept the status quo, and ask  
questions that begin with “Why,”  
“Why not,” and “What if.” 
Entrepreneurs enjoy creating value by taking advantage of opportunities 
and solving problems for customers. Leaders in organizations of all 
sizes—and all ages—can learn from their bold approach, it is just a 
question of looking in new ways at old problems and producing 
innovative solutions.

Investing in the future
Appointing talent  
A successful organization needs a ready supply  
of new leaders. Recruiting all future leaders  
from outside your organization simply isn’t  
cost effective; it takes a substantial amount of 
management time and money to find the right 
candidates and bring them up to speed. By  
contrast, leaders who are promoted from within 
your organization already have a very good 
understanding of your organization’s culture and 
working methods, and will have been nurtured and 
trained by you to have exactly the suite of skills  
and knowledge required to take on their new role.
For an organization to expand, it needs to invest in the development  
of the new leaders that will take it forward. Individuals who display 
leadership potential should be considered an important asset that  
will grow if nurtured, and will be lost if not.

INVESTING IN THE FUTURE    /    157
Realizing potential
One of your key goals as a leader is to 
recognize leadership qualities in others, 
and to know how to encourage and assist 
future leaders so they can realize their 
full potential. It can be helpful to think  
of leadership growing in a series of 
transitions in self-awareness, skill, and 
responsibility. Recognizing these crucial 
changes in others, and responding 
appropriately to them, will help 
accelerate the development of new 
leaders in your organization. 
Each stage on the path to leadership 
will bring different challenges—not  
only in taking on new attitudes and 
responsibilities but also leaving behind 
familiar and comfortable behaviors.  
This can be a highly stressful time  
for newly appointed leaders and the 
individual may not recognize or expect 
the strains and associated emotions  
of transition to their new role. 
Feelings of uncertainty, being 
overwhelmed, and loss of confidence  
can immobilize new leaders at the very 
point that they are expected to shine. 
Moreover, it is unlikely that the person 
who is making the transition will feel 
comfortable raising these concerns  
with you, their manager, for fear of 
appearing to fail.

Recognizing leadership stages
The first sign of leadership potential is a 
transition from being self-focused, and 
simply performing to a high standard in 
your own individual role, to becoming 
more aware of, and helpful to, others. 
Potential leaders then start taking  
on more responsibility and begin 
questioning the ways things are done  
at the moment and coming up with  
ideas for doing things differently.  
As the potential leader develops, 
others in the organization start to 
recognize their vision and that they  
have a talent for spotting important 
opportunities that will benefit the team or 
the organization as a whole. They thrive 
on added responsibility, and when they 
have a team to manage, they contribute 
at a higher level, work well with their 
peers, and show a talent for developing 
team members. Others naturally 
gravitate toward them to sound out 
ideas; this process may be formalized 
into mentoring or coaching roles. 
Ultimately, they start to develop the skills 
needed to nurture the next generation of 
leaders in your organization.

Coaching for success
Releasing potential
It isn’t easy to find time to invest  
in coaching your potential leaders,  
but there is a considerable return  
to you, your team, and the organization, 
if you do.The selection of coaches  
needs to be undertaken with care— 
the careers of some of the brightest 
prospects in your organization  
will be in their hands. 
Challenging and supporting
The hallmark of a skilled coach is 
knowing when to challenge and when  
to support the individual being coached. 
Successful coaches work to build 
self-awareness and release potential,  
by, for example, unblocking limiting  
or constricting beliefs or confronting 
unhelpful behaviors. They encourage  
the people they are coaching to reflect 
deeply, think strategically, release  
their instinctive creativity, and feel  
good about who they are.  
The results of successful  
coaching should be an increased 
self-appreciation in your future  
leaders of their personal strengths, 
competencies, approach, and actions. 
These newly developed leadership 
elements, in turn, should align with  
your organization’s values and aims. 
A good coach can accelerate the development of your future leaders, 
helping them manage the transitions they need to make to gain 
leadership experience and develop the suite of competencies  
required to be a top leader within your organization.
VISUALIZE LEADERSHIP
Encourage those you are 
coaching to develop a detailed 
mental image of themselves 
as an effective leader, and to 
use this vision to motivate  
and commit themselves  
to making changes.
Tip

The right experience
You may choose to coach your  
potential leaders yourself, or you  
may prefer to appoint other internal  
or external coaches. Whoever you 
choose, they must have the right 
business and coaching experience  
or have received training on how  
to coach effectively. 

COACHING FOR SUCCESS   /    163
MAP OUT THE PROCESS 
When providing coaching, 
explain what the process  
is, how long it will take,  
and what will be covered. 
Encourage the coachee  
to journal their progress. 
Tip
Benefiting the business
Coaching and mentoring—especially of 
first line and middle managers—is often 
focused on specific issues or to help 
people make leadership transitions. In 
this case, experienced mentors from 
your organization may be most suitable. 
Senior managers may benefit from an 
external coach with more experience at 
board level. With successful coaching 
you may find leaders become better at 
innovating and developing the overall 
capability of their teams. The effects of 
coaching work through the organization 
and provide significant business benefits

Adopting new  
leadership patterns
Profiting from change
In business today, leaders need to manage and 
inspire not just their core teams but groups of 
freelancers, temporary staff, and outsourcers. 
Engaging such potentially disparate groups to 
align them with the vision and values of the 
organization is the new leadership challenge. 
Leaders today may be heading up a virtual 
team—with members based globally—
formed around a customer problem that 
needs solving or an innovative idea rather 
than a group of people physically working 
together for the same employer. Leaders 
with the ability to be agile, to build virtual 
networks, teams, and alliances quickly,  
will be the long-term winners. 
In the coming years, leaders will look  
less and less to their employers to provide  
a framework or support system for their  
life—they will need to develop it themselves.  
As an individual aiming to survive in this rapidly 
changing environment, you will need to be 
excellent at understanding customer needs 
and have supreme confidence in your ability  
to deliver, and market, yourself. Thinking 
creatively and with vision, both about your 
career and personal mission, should become  
a life-long process and a central theme in  
your continued success. 
The 20th-century idea of a job for life is rapidly being superseded by  
the concept of the portfolio career. Today’s leaders need to be skilled  
in change management because their own careers are almost certain  
to be characterized by frequent transition. The emphasis has shifted  
from excelling in a particular corporate position to excelling in one  
vital project—leading your own life based on consistent principles.

Branding yourself
So how exactly do you develop yourself 
as a leader for the 21st century? One way 
of answering this question is to think of 
what you can deliver to your customers 
as a brand. Your brand signals your 
professional, technical, and functional 
knowledge and skills, and also your 
position in the market. Aim to develop 
yourself much as you would steer a 
brand. Shape your product (what you 
offer) to anticipate customer demand, 
and develop your identity to make the 
best fit with desirable clients. For 
example, should your next client be a 
small enterprise where you can work 
closely on your entrepreneurial acumen, 
or should it be a large corporation where 
you can refresh process management 
knowledge? Carefully consider your next 
steps; how will they shape your brand?

ACHIEVING HIGH
PERFORMANCE

To prosper in both life and business you need to 
understand yourself. What are your strengths and 
limitations, what do you enjoy, and what do you really 
want to achieve? By reflecting upon and analyzing  
your own characteristics and how you are perceived  
by others, you can begin to produce a plan for  
self-development and ultimate success.

Looking in from outside
Other people’s perceptions of you may be significantly at odds with  
your own view of yourself. Finding out what others think of you is  
an important element of self-exploration, and helps you modify  
your behavior so that you can take on opportunities that you  
might otherwise have missed. 
PSYCHOMETRIC TESTING
Psychometric tests, such as the widely used Myers Briggs, offer a 
more scientific approach to self-understanding. These tests look at 
personality and attempt to give an indication of the type of environment 
in which an individual is likely to thrive. Myers Briggs Type Indicator 
positions people against four pairs of factors:  
• Extroversion and introversion 
• Sensing and intuition 
• Thinking and feeling  
• Judging and perceiving
There is nothing wrong with any of these personality traits. However,  
if, for example, you are at the extreme end of the scale on “thinking,” 
you may be ignoring people’s feelings when you make decisions. If you 
are a “perceiving“ rather than a “judging” person, you may need to set 
more goals and deadlines for yourself.
In focus
Seeking new perspectives
You may feel you lack confidence, or that you are  
too quiet, but others may see you primarily as 
someone who is trustworthy, honorable, and  
wise. Conversely, you may describe yourself as 
assertive and confident, while others see you  
as aggressive and avoid involving you in their 
projects. Other people’s views are important 
because they shape the way they behave toward  
you. That’s not to say you should always aim  
to please others, or change the person you  
are, but being aware of how others see you will 
enable you to change the signals you send out.

LOOKING IN FROM OUTSIDE    /    171
Getting answers
The only way to find out what other 
people think of you is to ask. Many 
international companies use a process 
called 360-degree feedback, which is a 
formal means of eliciting comment from 
colleagues, staff, and bosses. It is often 
used to develop senior management 
teams, but you can carry out a similar 
process yourself on a smaller scale. 
Approach people who see you in different 
roles—perhaps your business partner, 
work colleagues at the same level of 
management, your immediate boss, 
some of your suppliers and clients, and  
a couple of friends. Think of the best way 
to ask the questions: a questionnaire has 
the advantage of ensuring consistency, 
while structured face-to-face interviews 
give respondents the opportunity to 
elaborate, but may also inhibit honest 
responses. When you are drafting a 
questionnaire, keep it short and simple, 
and concentrate on specific questions 
that you really want answered, such as: 
• How confident do I appear to you?  
• Am I approachable? 
• Do I communicate clearly?
Using feedback
The feedback process won’t give you a 
definitive view of what you are like in the 
eyes of others, but it is certain to produce 
some valuable insights. It’s too easy to 
focus on criticisms when you see them  
in black and white, so make sure that  
you value and reflect on the positive 
points that emerge, and use them in  
your planning for the future. 
MAKE AN IMPRESSION
Lasting judgments can be 
made, based on subconscious 
cues, within the first few 
seconds of meeting. Think 
about any visual cues you 
display and the tone of voice 
you use—these can often be 
more significant than what 
you actually say.

Setting goals
Examining your ambitions
Getting a clear view of your ambitions is 
not quite as easy as it seems. First, you 
may have arrived where you are more by 
chance than by design and it can be hard 
to avoid being influenced by your current 
situation. So, if you are working in sales, 
you may not look beyond a future in  
which you progress through the ranks  
to become sales manager and then sales 
director. Second, you will have family ties 
or other responsibilities that limit your 
freedom to follow your dreams. Third, 
your “ideal” job will change over time  
as you develop skills and experience.
Looking at the future
There are many ways to systematically 
look at your career and life goals. Some 
prefer to work with a coach—an objective, 
sympathetic, and experienced person 
who can help identify directions for 
progress. Others favor less formal 
consultation with their colleagues or 
peers, but it is equally valid to work 
through the options on your own. Indeed, 
the question is so central that it is worth 
applying more than one approach and 
repeating the analysis from time to time 
as your circumstances change.
Visualizing the way
Visualization is a technique that can help 
you clarify your goals. Set aside some 
time to sit undisturbed and relaxed. 
Picture yourself at various points in the 
future, say in three, five, and ten years’ 
time. Think graphically and generate 
images of your ideal world, asking 
yourself questions such as:
•  Where will I be living? 
•  What job will I have? 
•  What type of organization  
will I be working in?
•  Will I own and be running my  
own business?
•  What will I be doing on a daily basis?
•  Will I have a team working  
for me or will I be a specialist?
•  Will I be commuting or working  
from home, perhaps?
•  What will my interests be? 
Work takes up a large chunk of your life, so job satisfaction is important. 
Achieving it doesn’t necessarily mean changing jobs, it could just be a 
matter of broadening your existing role. Knowing what you enjoy and 
want to achieve will help ensure you’re in the right job. If you’re in the 
right job, you’re more likely to succeed at what you do.

Analyzing your strengths 
and limitations
Describing your capabilities
When you ask yourself what you  
are really good at, your answer  
should encompass three important 
areas—your basic technical  
ability, your innate personal  
or soft, skills, and the knowledge  
and experience that you have  
acquired throughout your career.
Most people have a preference  
for what they like to do. Some people 
are good at working with numbers, 
while others excel at languages.  
These skills are the building blocks  
of your job—they are sometimes 
called your basic technical ability.
Gaining skills and experience
“Soft” skills are less tangible than basic 
technical ability. You may be a good 
listener or a powerful communicator,  
or have the ability to influence people or 
negotiate well, or you may command 
respect, have great presence, and be 
highly motivated. You need to achieve  
a certain level of skill in all these areas, 
but that level will depend on your precise 
role in the organization. 
The third dimension of your personal 
strengths and limitations is your 
knowledge and experience, both of the 
sector and the role in which you work. 
For example, if you work in Human 
Resources, do you have sufficient 
knowledge of employment law? Reflect 
on your skills and knowledge: they may 
be good enough for your current role, 
but will they suffice in the future? Try  
to identify the role that best fits with  
your ambitions, and ask yourself what 
skills you will need to fit that role. 
Published job descriptions and job 
advertisements provide a good guide  
to current industry standards and  
what employers are looking for. Set 
about gaining those skills through 
additional training, or by realigning  
your role with your current employer. 
To achieve high performance in your workplace, you need to understand 
and play to your strengths. You also need to recognize what you are less 
good at doing, so that you can develop appropriate skills and acquire the 
necessary knowledge and experience.  
REVIEW YOUR SKILLS
Even if you plan to stay in  
the same job, look closely at 
what’s happening around you. 
Your work environment is in 
flux and you should constantly 
be learning and adapting, to 
cope and thrive with the new 
circumstances your workplace 
presents to you.

Developing your brand
Giving the right impression
A company brand is a unique and 
consistent set of values that underpins 
its product or service. Just as a company 
builds its brand, you need to know what 
you stand for and how you want to project 
yourself to others. You need to make 
sure the messages you give out are 
consistent with your personal brand. 
This does not mean you should try  
to be something you aren’t. That may 
work for a short time but it will be 
impossible to keep up over a long  
period. Your “brand” has to be something 
that you are completely comfortable  
with. It should reflect your values  
and be uniquely yours. 
We have looked at the importance of how other people see you and  
of understanding yourself, your strengths and limitations, and your 
ambitions. Developing your brand is about how you bring these factors 
together, use them to differentiate yourself from other people, and 
develop your career.
FOLLOW YOUR 
CUSTOMERS’ LEAD
Match your personal style

Tip
Creating the right look 
There are some aspects of the way  
you look, sound, and behave that are 
essential to your brand, wherever you 
are working. Paying attention to your 
appearance, whatever your style, being 
polite, and fulfilling your promises, for 
example, are all “musts.” Your brand 
needs to take into account your “target 
audience,” such as the organization you 
work for and the customers you work 
with. If you work for an old-fashioned  
law firm, for example, wearing the latest 
fashion in shorts and flashy jewelry 
probably won’t inspire your clients with 
confidence, but it may if you work for  
a high-fashion retailer.
Being personable
While appearance is important, how you 
behave becomes far more important as 
time progresses. If you look the part but 
fail to do what you have been asked or 
are bad-tempered and difficult, then no 
amount of image makeovers will help 
you succeed. The key to defining your 
brand is to pay attention to every element 
of the image you project, and make  
sure your actions are consistent and 
acceptable to the majority of people.

Planning the future
Knowing where you’re going
Life is unpredictable, so why plan? First, 
all of the things you want to achieve in 
your life require effort and preparation. 
So, you need to ensure you acquire the 
qualifications and experience that will 
allow you to progress in your chosen 
career, and to do that, you need a plan. 
Having a plan gives you a framework 
against which to measure your progress. 
Setting objectives
Have you achieved what you set out to do? 
If not, why not? What can you learn from 
your successes and failures? A plan also 
provides a reference against which you 
can judge new opportunities. How much 
will this opportunity contribute to you 
achieving your goals? If it doesn’t, why  
do you want to do it? Is it a distraction  
or have your goals and plan changed?
There is a saying that “all plans are useless, but planning is vital.” Plans 
are useless as they become out of date very quickly. But without the 
process of planning, you won’t prepare for the future. You do need to 
plan, but don’t stick to your plans so rigidly that you miss opportunities.
WHAT’S ON YOUR RÉSUMÉ?
One good way to plan the future is to create  
a version of your résumé three, five, and ten 
years in the future. What qualifications would 
appear? What job titles would you have? 
Which companies would you have worked  
for? What experience would you have gained 
in each of the roles you have undertaken?  
If you don’t know what to put on the résumé, 
why not look in the papers or on the internet 
for job advertisements. They will tell you  
what people are looking for when filling  
these roles today. Although this won’t  
change dramatically, certain aspects,  
such as qualifications, computer literacy,  
and international experience, will be  
more in demand. So by looking at the job 
requirements today and thinking about the 
future, you should be able to construct an 
outline future résumé to work toward.

Creating a success map for

A success map is a useful tool for 
thinking through the key actions you 
need to take to achieve your goals and  
for representing these in a single picture. 
•  To create your success map start  
from the top—your ultimate goal. 
Write this at the top of your map. 
•  Think about how you will achieve this 
goal. For example, imagine your vision  
is to become sales director for a major 
pharmaceutical company. To achieve  
this goal, you will need to have been  
a regional sales manager for three  
to five years, to have handled some 
major clients within your portfolio, 
and to have gained a professional 
sales qualification. These objectives 
become the second-level goals on 
your success map.  
•  Next, ask yourself how to achieve 
these objectives, and fill in the next  
level of your map. 
•  At all stages, use arrows to connect 
later objectives that are dependent  
upon your having first achieved the  
earlier objectives. 
•  To check that your success map  
is complete and follows a logical 
progression, work up from the bottom. 
For each objective, ask “Why am  
I doing this?”—the answer should  
be to obtain the objective above.

Managing your time
While you can raise additional capital for your business, employ  
more people, and buy more machinery, there will only ever be  
24 hours in a day. Time is one of the few commodities you  
cannot buy, but there are many  
techniques to help you use your  
time more effectively. 
Tracking your time
Before you can start actively managing 
your time, you need to find out how you 
spend it. Rather than just guessing, 
measure and record your expenditure  
of time over a period of at least a week  
in a time log. When you have completed 
the analysis, consider if the way you 
spend time reflects your key objectives. 
For example, you may find that you  
spend five percent of your time visiting 
customers. Is this activity one that

MANAGING YOUR TIME    /    187
Making time
Planning encourages you to think not  
just about the day ahead, but also the 
more distant future. It’s all too easy  
to put off big but necessary strategic 
projects, such as arranging training  
for your staff or creating a database  
of contacts, because you are immersed 
in day-to-day activities. Think about the 
longer-term projects you would like  
to implement in the next quarter. Break 
these tasks into manageable chunks,  
and estimate how much time it will take 
you to complete each chunk. 
Keep a sheet of paper on your 
desk, divided into two columns.
Assign a code or letter to each of 
these categories (e.g. emails = E, 
thinking = T).
Categorize your tasks, e.g. 
answering emails, writing 
reports, planning, thinking, 
visiting clients, traveling.

Planning your day
Write an action plan setting out your 
activities for the day ahead. The best 
time to do this is at the beginning of  
the day, when you feel fresh. Build time 
into your plan for day-to-day duties  
and the work you need to do toward  
your longer-term projects. Failing to 
stick to an over-optimistic plan can  
be demotivating, so be realistic in your 
timings, allowing for interruptions  
and some breaks. 
Calculating priority
When writing your plan, prioritize  
your tasks objectively—it often helps  
to categorize tasks according to 
importance and urgency. Give priority  
to those that are both urgent and 
important (for example, producing 
up-to-date figures for the next day’s 
sales meeting). Tasks that are important 
but not urgent (such as completing 
segments of your large projects)  
take second priority. Tasks that are  
not important but urgent (such as  
dealing with someone else’s request for 
information) take third priority, and those 
that are neither important nor urgent 
should be delegated or not done at all.
BE DISCIPLINED
Try to deal with paperwork 
only once. Mark a red dot on a 
document each time you pick 
it up; attempt to minimize the 
number of red dots on your 
paperwork—the discipline 
will slowly work its way into 
all your processes.

To make the most of every work day,  
get to know the times of day when  
you are most effective and creative.  
If you are a “morning“ person, plan  
to tackle your creative tasks—such as 
writing proposals or reports—and your 
challenging tasks, such as talking to a 
difficult client, in the morning. Take on 
routine tasks in the afternoon. If you are 
an “afternoon” person, do your routine 
tasks first, but make sure that you don’t 
get hooked into doing them all day.

Working effectively
To help you work quickly and effectively, 
always keep your desk clean and ensure 
that frequently used items are readily 
available to hand. The same goes for 
information you use regularly. Set up 
favorites for websites; keep a list of  
who knows what, and of key phone 
numbers; and use an old-fashioned 
card index for storing nuggets of 
information you refer to often. 
Build thinking time into your

to be a time-waster, but it can also 
provide just the change of pace and

creative thinking.

Participating in meetings
Researching well
Preparation is essential to ensure that 
you make the most of your opportunity. 
Read any material in advance and note 
down issues you need to clarify and 
points you want to make. For important 
and complex discussions, you may want 
to sound out other people’s opinions to 
help you form your own view and get an 
idea of who will support your thinking. 
 
Making your mark
When you arrive at a meeting try to sit 
near people who are likely to support 
your views, and ideally in the middle 
rather than at the end of the group. 
During the meeting, it is very important 
to find opportunities to speak. If you are 
nervous about making your own points, 
get used to hearing your voice by making 
short remarks in support of others.  
A clear, firm: “I agree with that point” 
will get you noticed. Also, ask questions 
for clarification, which will make you 
sound interested. Try drafting some 
points to make in advance, and introduce 
them early in the discussion, but make 
sure that you do so in the context of  
the discussion. Be careful, too, that  
you don’t speak too much: it’s better  
to be known as someone who makes 
good points than as someone who 
speaks all the time.
It’s easy to forget the importance of meetings. This is where  
decisions are made that could affect your work and your future,  
where relationships are built, and where you have an opportunity  
to make an impression on others, make your views heard, and  
find out what others think. 
Do I speak clearly 
and loudly enough 
to be heard?
Do I contribute 
to the meeting 
early on?
Do I look at everyone as  
I make my point?
Do I listen to what 
is being said?
Do I support 
others?
Do I interrupt  
others only when  
it is necessary?
Am I participating 
well in meetings?

PARTICIPATING IN MEETINGS   /    193
Recording meetings
Minutes should be produced for  
all meetings, even if they are just  
simple notes of who agreed to do  
what. For regular meetings, such as  
staff meetings or committee meetings,  
it can be useful if they take a formal  
style, because this helps reinforce the 
importance of the meeting. 
Taking minutes
If you are the minute-taker, clarify what 
form the minutes should take with the 
chairperson. For some meetings it is 
important to know who said what. In that 
case you may need to place nametags  
in front of each of the attendees. For 
most meetings, however, the key point  
is to record actions you decide on, who  
is taking them, and when they must be 
completed. If the chairperson does not 
summarize what has been agreed at  
the end of each agenda item, ask them  
for further clarification. Always aim  
to produce the minutes as soon as 
possible after the meeting, when the 
discussion is fresh in your mind. Try  
to keep the minutes as succinct as 
possible without detracting from  
making a full and accurate record  
of everything that had been agreed. 
MAKE YOURSELF 
HEARD
Have the first words of what 
you want to say in your mind; 
wait for a pause, then say 
those words clearly. Pause, 
then carry on with the rest.

Chairing a meeting
Calling a meeting
People often complain about how many 
meetings they have to attend. At a time 
when few of us have time to spare, going 
to a meeting that results in no action is 
just a waste of time. So before you call  
a meeting, ask yourself: is this meeting 
necessary or can it be done by another 
means, such as by email or a conference 
call perhaps?
Inviting the right people
If you do decide that a meeting is 
necessary, next consider who should 
attend. This will obviously depend on  
the purpose of the meeting. If you are 
briefing employees about changes that 
are to be made to your department’s 
structure, for example, then it’s essential 
that everyone attends. If you want views 
on how the structure should change, on 
the other hand, you might want to invite 
just a few key people. Once you have 
decided who should attend, send out 
notices of the date and place in plenty  
of time. Give an indication of how long  
the meeting will take, to help your 
invitees plan their time.
Chairing a meeting is an excellent way to gain visibility. You don’t  
need to have expertise in the subject of the meeting, but you do have to 
develop a range of procedural skills. These range from the technical—
how to produce an agenda—to the diplomatic, such as how to keep the 
discussion moving and stop participants from speaking for too long.
How to run the 
meeting
Ensure that there is someone 
to take the minutes and let him 
or her know the format you 
want the minutes to follow.
At the end of the meeting, remind everyone what 
has to be achieved and summarize what has been 
agreed, to help the minute-taker.

CHAIRING A MEETING   /    195
Setting the agenda
An agenda is essential to ensure that 
your meeting has a focus and to enable 
participants to prepare beforehand.  
How you structure it will have a major 
impact on the success of the meeting. 
The best plan is to word the agenda so 
that the type of treatment necessary  
for each item is clear.  
Creating items
An item labeled “To discuss” on an 
agenda, means an open debate of the 
issues. The term “To note” means  
there will not be any real general 
discussion unless there is a point 
someone is desperate to raise. The 
timings you allot to each item and  
where you place items on the agenda  
will give participants an idea of the 
importance of that subject. For regular 
meetings, it is usually a good idea  
to ask participants in advance if  
there is anything they want to add  
to the agenda or whether there is 
anything they want to raise under  
“any other business.”
Running the meeting
The role of the chairperson is to ensure 
the meeting achieves its aims. There  
are a number of key techniques for doing 
this. One of the main characteristics of  
a successful chairperson is being able  
to make everyone feel they have been 
able to air their views, that their opinion 
has been valued, and that they have 
achieved something.
Let everyone speak, but 
move the conversation on to 
the next person when they 
have had their say. 
Keep to time, but allow 
sufficient airing of the issues.
If someone is dominating  
the discussion, politely say 
“Thank you. That was useful 
and I think we’ve understood 
your point. I see Joe has 
something to add.”
Try to bring quieter people 
into the conversation. If you 
think someone may have 
something to contribute,  
ask directly if he or she  
would like to add anything.

CONDUCTING A MEETING
Do’s
Don’ts
Dealing with difficult people
A difficult person could be someone who is genuinely obstructive or just 
an individual who sees the world differently from you. In either case, to 
manage difficult behavior, you first need to gain an understanding of the 
person, and then employ a set of tactics to manage the situation.
Planning for resolution
You can’t change a difficult person by 
being difficult yourself. You have to set  
a target for the situation or relationship 
you wish to achieve, and then create a 
strategy to reach that goal. The approach 
you take will depend on the situation,  
the person, and the type of behavior.  
One option is to call a private meeting 
with the difficult individual.
Discussing the situation
Select a location to meet in a place 
where you won’t be disturbed or noticed 
by colleagues. Prepare what you want  
to say and how you will say it. Tell the 
person how you see the main issues  
and problem, logically and without 
emotion. Ask how the individual sees it 
and don’t interrupt, even if you disagree.  
Ask for solutions and, finally, add some 
ways in which you think the problems 
might be resolved.
Facing up to conflict
Truly difficult people are difficult with 
everyone. Few will fail to notice their 
behavior, so it is important to face any 
conflict rather that allowing it to fester 
and affect the whole team. It is important 
to keep in mind that you need to act and 
not let the conflict affect you deeply. If 
the other person becomes threatening  
or abusive, walk away with dignity,  
saying you will consider the situation  
and get back to them. 
ACT EARLY
Tackle difficult behavior as 
soon as it becomes evident—
the longer you leave it, the 
harder it becomes to cope 
with, and it may affect other 
members of the team.

Reading and remembering
Scanning the details
The faster you read, the more you will 
remember. If you practice long enough, 
you will be able to scan a document  
and remember enough to hold a 
conversation about it. Start by reading 
whole sentences in one go. To do this, 
focus your eyes on the sentence rather 
than on each individual word. Move to 
looking at paragraphs. Soon you should 
be able to look at the page toward the  
top, in the middle, and finally at the 
bottom before you turn over. 
We are bombarded with information all day. The key to success is to  
be able to identify what is important and then remember it. Recalling  
an important fact can make the difference between success or failure  
in the heat of a negotiation or an important meeting.
Reading rapidly
Reading a textbook is not the same  
as reading for pleasure. There is a 
process for reading a textbook. Start  
by reading the introduction, then read  
the last chapter. At this point you should 
know what the book is about and how it’s 
structured; now, you can decide whether 
it’s worth reading the rest. If you think 
you would benefit from reading the  
book, begin by looking at the headings 
and diagrams on each page; you will be 
surprised by how much you learn. Once 
you have done your initial review, take  
a break before you read the book as a 
whole—this greatly reinforces learning.

READING AND REMEMBERING    /    201
Learning from documents
When you are learning, try scanning the 
whole document first. Then read it at 
your normal pace. Just scanning first  
will improve your understanding and 
memory. If you are late and unprepared 
for a meeting, try scanning some of your 
documents. You will be surprised how 
much you pick up. Even if it does not 
work, you will be able to find most of the 
information you need much more quickly.
Using mind maps
A mind map is an effective way to record 
information in a succinct format that you 
can easily remember. To create a mind 
map that summarizes the content of a 
book you have read, for example, start  
by writing the subject of the book in the 
center of a sheet of paper. Then draw 
branches radiating from the subject  
that sum up the major themes of the 
book. Next, fill in smaller branches 
containing the sub-themes, and finally 
add detail to these sub-themes in the 
outer “twigs” of your mind map. 
Remembering the ideas 
Use pictures and color liberally, as they 
make your mind map more memorable 
and will increase your recall of the 
information. If you want to be sure that 
you will remember the content of your 
map, review it the day after you have 
drawn it, one week later, one month  
later, and finally one year later.
REMEMBERING NAMES
Most people worry about 
remembering the names  
of the people they meet. If  
you have difficulty, try the 
following: when you are 
introduced, always repeat  
the person’s name. While you 
are doing this, look into the 
individual’s face and identify  
a feature that reminds you of 
their names. Does Sr. Marrón 
have brown hair, or is his hair 
so startlingly different that 
you will remember his name? 
If there isn’t a feature that is 
memorable, try imagining the 
person acting their names—
Julia Stokes the steam engine, 
for example, or Paul Parsons 
preaching a sermon.
In focus

202    /    BECOMING MORE EFFECTIVE
Being creative
Finding creative solutions
Creativity comes from abandoning  
linear thought and making leaps  
of the imagination. All your brain  
needs is the stimulus to make  
these leaps. Brainstorming is  
one technique for helping do this. 
Getting a group of people together  
to throw out possible solutions  
without the constraint of evaluating  
the suggestions creates energy  
and sparks new ideas. Another 
technique is asking people to  
consider the problem from a different 
perspective, such as: “How will our 
customers see this?” or “What if we  
turn the question on its head?”
Practice being creative in your private 
life, and it will develop your ability to  
be creative at work. Stimulate your  
brain by taking a different route to work, 
completing crossword puzzles, learning 
a new language, taking an activity 
holiday, or finding a new experience.
Many problems have simple solutions, but those are the problems that 
everyone can solve. Being creative enables you to solve, or contribute  
to solving, difficult problems. This will get you noticed. Some people 
appear naturally creative, but creative problem-solving is a skill that  
you can learn and hone through practice.
STIMULATE CREATIVITY  
Very few good ideas have 
been created by sitting alone 
at a desk. Change your scene, 
have a coffee and relax, or 
interact with others.
Tip
Practice being creative in 
your private life, and it will 
develop your ability to  
be creative at work

BEING CREATIVE   /    203
USE PRESSURE 
A tight deadline can increase 
your creativity. You will 
often find that with a short 
deadline you’ll come up with 
more alternatives and often 
a better solution. However, 
it’s also true that if you  
have a complex problem, 
“sleeping on it” can help  
you find the answer.
Tip
Asking the right questions
When you are faced with a problem, it  
is often the boundaries or rules that 
constrain your thinking. “We can’t do  
this because…” is a phrase that stifles 
creativity. Instead, asking the question: 
“What if this constraint wasn’t there?” will 
allow you to consider all the new options 
and benefits open to you, and can create 
a new world in your mind. You will often 
find the opportunities open to you when 
you remove a constraint are so great that 
it is worth the time and effort it takes  
to remove it. Did James Dyson ask the 
question “What if we don’t have a bag?” 
when he invented his revolutionary 
bagless vacuum cleaner?
 
Using benchmarking
Not every problem has to be solved 
again from scratch. Most problems  
have been solved before so all you have 
to do is find the solution. Benchmarking 
is a very useful tool for doing this. 
Benchmarking is about comparing 
processes. It is about weighing up the 
way your organization does something 
against the way in which that another 
organization performs the same 
function. Start by making sure that  
you understand your own processes. 
Who does what, when, how, and why? 
Just doing this will create ideas for 
improvement, but it also forms the  
basis for benchmarking: comparing  
your processes with those of your 
chosen benchmark subject. 
Who should you benchmark yourself 
against? Ideally, find an organization 
that is really good at the process you  
are trying to improve—for example,  
if you want to improve your delivery 
function, you might benchmark yourself 
against a company that is efficient at 
dealing with complex orders.  

204    /    BECOMING MORE EFFECTIVE
Being confident
Confidence is precious. It enables you to do what you want to do without 
constant fear of failure, or even despite fear on some occasions, and to 
maintain your sense of self-worth and not be dependent on what other 
people think. If you’re confident, you can take center stage when you 
want—you don’t always have to linger in the background. 
Thinking positive
The first step in building your confidence 
is to pay attention to what you’re thinking. 
Concentrate on your positive thoughts. 
It’s very easy to focus on the negative. 
You probably find that when you have 
been given feedback, at your appraisal 
perhaps, you concentrate solely on the 
one negative comment even though  
there were five positive comments. 
Creating good thoughts
To help overcome this, build a bank of 
achievements and positive comments 
that you can contemplate and reflect  
on whenever you feel uncertain about 
yourself and your abilities. Take some 
time to yourself and sit down with a pen 
and paper, and answer the following 
simple questions:
•  What have I achieved in the last year 
and in the last five years?
•  What am I most proud of? What did  
it feel like when I did it?
•  What am I good at? Create a list  
of your talents and skills.
•  What compliments have I received 
from others?
Concentrate solely on the positives of 
each situation, don’t let negative “but” 
thoughts creep in. Commit the answers 
to your “achievement bank” and draw  
on them in moments of doubt.
Pay attention to what you’re 
thinking. Concentrate on 
your positive thoughts

confidence of up to

DRAWING ON EXPERIENCE
A young executive was given the 
authority by his boss, the group 
managing director, to negotiate  
the purchase of a company. This  
in itself was a daunting task, but, 
arriving at the meeting with a 
partner from the company’s 
lawyers as his only colleague, he 
was ushered into a room to find  
11 people sitting opposite. The 
owners of the company he was 
buying were there, as were their 
accountants, tax advisors, and 
lawyers, and three merchant 
bankers. For an instant, he was 
totally overwhelmed. Then he 
remembered an industrial relations 
negotiating course he had attended 
a few years before. He recalled  
how he had handled that situation 
successfully, his confidence 
immediately returned, and he 
successfully negotiated the deal.

Managing thoughts
Most of us have a voice in our heads 
telling us to be careful and stopping  
us from doing things that would cause 
harm to ourselves. The same voice can 
also prevent us from doing new things 
and progressing: “If you do this, you’ll 
make a fool of yourself. Let someone 
else do it.” When you hear that voice, 
ask yourself: “What’s the worst that can 
happen if I do this?”, “How likely is that 
to happen?”, and “What’s the best that 
can happen?” In most cases you will 
find the good outweighs the bad, and 
you should go ahead. If not, at least you 
will have evaluated the risk logically 
and assessed whether it is one you  
are prepared to take.
Looking confident
It is also important to build confidence  
on the outside—how you appear to 
others. Even if you don’t feel it, “acting” 
confident can have an effect on both  
you and those around you. If you have  
a confident demeanor, you are more 
likely to be treated like a confident 
person by others. This will reinforce  
your self-belief and help you feel  
more confident in yourself. 
All of us get into bad habits, whether 
it’s slouching in our seat, forgetting  
to acknowledge people when we meet 
them, or not taking enough care over  
our appearance. Take a moment to think 
about the image you portray—is it one  
of a confident and professional person?

Making decisions
The place that you have reached in your career or your personal life  
is the result of the decisions you have made. Every decision closes off  
some opportunities and opens others. Life is full of difficult choices  
and that is why making good decisions is essential. 
Defining the process
Making big decisions isn’t simply about 
mulling over a few options. Big decisions 
require thought, information gathering, 
and the creation and evaluation of 
alternatives before the decision is  
finally made. Timing is critical: you  
may sometimes be able to delay a  
major decision—although think carefully 
through the consequences if you do— 
but for many you will have to seize  
the moment. 
Deciding process
When faced with a major decision,  
use the process described here to give 
structure to your decision-making. This 
will work for large personal decisions 
that you take yourself, but is even more 
important if you are working with others 
in making the decision.
GO WITH THE FLOW  
If your company culture is 
for decisions to be made by 
consensus, do that. If you 
act alone, you will not be 
supported and are likely to 
fail, regardless of whether 
the decision you made was 
correct or not.

MAKING DECISIONS  /    209
Establishing criteria
There are two reasons to establish early 
on the criteria by which you will evaluate 
your decision. First, these criteria will 
determine what information you need  
to collect to make the decision. Second, 
they help make the decision process 
transparent. Everyone involved knows 
what the list of alternatives will be  
judged against.
Prioritizing elements
In joint decisions, create and agree  
the evaluation criteria in a group. Your 
organization will have its own criteria,  
so make sure these are included on  
the list. If the result is a very long list, 
then persuade the group to agree and 
prioritize the most important criteria  
for making the decision.
In business, the evaluation criteria  
are often hard numbers—to do something 
for the least cost, for example, or to make 
the most profit. In your personal life, the 
criteria are usually more subjective— 
the relative size of the property you are 
buying, or the desirability of its location. 
Often you need both types, which is why 
you need to use judgment.
Making group decisions
Group decision-making can be very 
powerful, because it creates ownership of 
the decision. Make sure that all involved 
understand the process you will use, and 
are aware of the input that is required  
at each stage. The decision will even be 
supported by those who disagree with the 
outcome, as long as the process by which 
you have made the decision is seen to  
be transparent and fair. However, you  
will have to abide by the outcome of the 
process. If you fail to do so, the decision 
may be seen as arbitrary and the team 
will be reluctant to be involved again.

Finding alternatives
Decisions are usually choices between 
alternatives; so successful decision-
making depends on identifying the best 
possible set of alternatives to evaluate. 
Search widely, but remember you can’t 
evaluate everything. You may need to be 
creative and on occasions “to think the 
unthinkable,” but don’t forget the obvious.
One alternative you should consider  
is doing nothing. This is not always easy, 
but may be a real alternative. At the very 
least it gives you a benchmark against 
which to compare the other possibilities.  
In some circumstances you may find it is 
possible to do two of the alternatives at 
the same time. This will require greater 
levels of evaluation than discussed here, 
but asking the question can sometimes 
overcome major dilemmas.

MAKING DECISIONS    /    211
Using decision charts
Creating a decision diagram or chart  
can help you weigh up a number of 
alternatives. For example, imagine you 
are considering buying a house and have 
found two options, one of which is more 
expensive than the other. To buy house A, 
you will need to borrow $300,000; to buy 
house B, $500,000. You are concerned 
about how much each of the houses will 
cost you to buy over the lifetime of your 
mortgage. To compare the two options, 
first consider what the interest rates are 
likely to be in the future. For example, you 
may evaluate three possibilities: interest 
rates rising to 10 percent, staying at the 
current rate of 6 percent, and falling to  
4 percent. Next estimate the percentage 
chance of each change happening. For 
both houses there is a 50 percent chance 
of the rate remaining at 6 percent.
Now create your decision chart. To 
calculate the expected cost, multiply the 
annual mortgage cost by the percentage 
chance for each interest rate and then 
total the costs. The expected annual 
mortgage cost for house A is $18,600  
and $31,000 for house B. 
Use this information to evaluate  
your alternatives, but remember that  
this is the average expected cost. 
Averages very rarely happen, so you  
also need carefully to assess risk, for 
example, by asking yourself: “Can I 
afford the house if the interest rates  
are at 10 percent for a long period?”

Making the decision
By the time you have created the 
evaluation criteria and evaluated the 
alternatives, the decision should be all 
but made for you. Remember, however, 
that after all of your calculations and 
analysis, you will have to make the 
decision based on your judgment of  
the situation. You will have to decide 
whether one factor is more important 
than another, and will choose to value 
some things above others. 
Understanding emotions
There is evidence to suggest that  
you cannot make decisions without  
also making emotional choices  
such as these value judgments.  
Decision-making is not wholly rational,  
so be very careful about taking a  
decision that you are not entirely 
comfortable with. Your emotions  
or your subconcious may be telling  
you something important that the 
“rational” analysis has missed. 

MAKING DECISIONS  /    213
Acting on your choice
Once the decision is made, you will  
need to communicate it to those who 
have been involved in the process as  
well as those it will affect. Draw up  
an implementation plan and delegate 
authority to individuals who will be  
held responsible for implementing the 
decision. Appoint a project manager  
and a project sponsor to oversee the 
whole project where appropriate.
Evaluating the project
Once the project or task has been 
completed, evaluate how it went. This 
isn’t a witch-hunt, but an opportunity  
to learn. Some of the best-performing 
companies regularly reevaluate their 
projects to gain insight and learning  
for the future. You can even improve  
your personal decision-making  
ability by reflecting on what went  
well and what did not.
DEALING WITH RISK
All decisions contain risks. To assess the riskiness of your alternatives, ask:
• What is the best outcome I can contemplate?
• What is the most likely outcome?
• What is the worst outcome I can contemplate?
You can then estimate the probability of each outcome occurring  
and calculate the likely cost using a decision-tree diagram. However,  
regardless of the outcome of these calculations there are two further 
questions you need to ask: 
• Can the project survive if the worst-case scenario happens?
• Am I prepared to risk that probability of failure?
Your choice may depend on your appetite for risk. Others may have  
a different view, so ensure everyone understands the risks involved.

Saying “no”
Successful people know what they want and how they are going to get  
it, and say “no” when what they are being asked to do doesn’t fit in with 
their plans. Being successful is as much about what you decide not to  
do as what you decide to do. 
Maintaining a balance
We all have to keep a balance in our lives. You have 
to balance what your employer wants from you with 
what you get from your employer. The latter doesn’t 
only mean money, but also the training you receive, 
the experience you get, and the opportunities that 
working for the company opens up for your career.
Assessing work time
You also have to balance your working life and your 
family life. If you want to get ahead, the company 
you work for will expect some commitment and 
flexibility, but you do not have to be a doormat. 
Decide how much time you are willing to give to  
the company and how much you will keep for your 
family, and then stick to it consistently. There will  
be times when intensive effort is required and 
you may have to put in long hours, but if 
your employer doesn’t reciprocate,  
you should consider your position. 
STRIKE A 
BALANCE
Fight the urge to 
work long hours 
to try to impress 
your bosses. For  
a senior position, 
employers prefer 
a well-rounded 
individual to  
a workaholic.

SAYING “NO”   /    215
Getting it right
Use your judgment to assess when and 
how often you say no. It doesn’t look  
good if you are seen as someone who 
always says no, or who only says no to 
the difficult jobs, so make sure that you 
get the balance right. When saying no is 
appropriate, do so quickly and politely. 
Evaluating the project
You may sometimes find yourself in the 
situation where colleagues try to offload 
work on to you because they don’t want 
to do it themselves, and they see you as 
being accommodating enough to do their 
work for them. If this happens, think very 
carefully before you accept. Assess the 
situation: if there really is a crisis and you 
can help, then of course you should do 
so. However, if there are no good reasons 
and you feel the other person may make 
a habit of offloading their work, you 
should say no. Do this politely but firmly. 
Do not make complicated excuses, just 
say something like: “I’m sorry, but I  
can’t help out this time. I have a heavy 
workload myself.”  
THINK IT THROUGH
Think about the impact your 
decision to say no could have. 
For example, if your boss or  
a friend is in serious trouble, 
saying no to helping out could 
damage your relationship 
with them.

Listening effectively
Many people can talk, but few listen well. If you are good at hearing  
what others miss, it gives you a distinct advantage. Good listeners are 
also better at building rapport with others, so listening effectively  
is a good skill to develop and practice.
Being a good listener
Listening is not the same as hearing. You 
can hear something but not take it in or 
respond to it. The words are just flowing 
over you. When you are truly listening, 
the person talking to you knows you are 
listening and will appreciate it. Listening 
requires concentration, which will not  
be possible if you are busy thinking about 
what you are going to say next. Be in the 
present. If you are really listening you 
will find your next words come intuitively.
Reading all signs
Listen to what the speaker is saying, not 
just what you are hearing. Think about 
what the tone and inflection in the voice 
tells you about what’s behind the words. 
Are they congruent? If not, what is not 
being said? Their body language is 
important, too, and you will probably pick 
this up subconsciously. Does the speaker’s 
body language match the words?
Confirming your thoughts
As you listen, make sure that you always 
understand what the speaker is saying. 
Summarize your understanding and,  
if necessary, ask the speaker to repeat 
what he or she said, or ask for further 
clarification if you are unsure. Never 
pretend to understand if you don’t.  
Ending well
Finally, make sure that you end the 
encounter on the right note. If you need 
to take further action as a result of your 
conversation, summarize what you have 
heard and then discuss the action you 
are going to take. Make a note of what 
you have agreed should happen next, 
ideally in your colleague’s presence.  
This will emphasize the importance of 
the matters that have been discussed 
and decided. Always make a note of 
important points even if this has to be 
after the meeting. 
GIVE THE RIGHT SIGNS
Give signs of encouragement— 
nods, smiles, and winces in the  
right places—to the person you are 
listening to. If the story is distressing 
or embarrassing, it is better to vary 
your eye contact.
Tip

LISTENING EFFECTIVELY  /    217
Giving advice
There will be times when you get the 
impression that a conversation is 
actually a request for advice. Be wary  
of this. It’s better to be asked for advice 
than to offer it unsolicited. If you really 
feel you have something important to 
contribute, ask the person whether your 
advice is welcome, but be prepared to  
be told “no.” Alternatively, give advice  
by telling a personal story of how  
you dealt with something similar.  
Do this carefully, however—no  
two circumstances are identical.
Empathizing with care
There are some times when  
there is nothing you can do.  
The person may be telling  
you something simply to tell 
someone. In this case, your  
role is to listen carefully and 
empathize, letting him or her 
know you are always available  
if you are needed. Above all,  
when someone tells you 
something in confidence,  
keep that confidence.

Networking
Networking is about establishing groups of contacts that will add  
value to your business and career. It is a two-way process in which  
you must give to receive. Building good relationships will give you  
a competitive edge, but for many people, the thought of going out  
to make contacts is awkward and artificial. 
Six degrees of separation
Research carried out by the American social 
psychologist Stanley Milgram suggested that  
most people are connected to one another through  
a chain of just six acquaintances. Networking gives 
you access to a wealth of knowledge and expertise; 
it allows you to gain competitive information, build  
a good reputation, and even get your next job. And as 
you progress in your career, who you know becomes

You can meet people anywhere. Be open to chance

these unexpected opportunities to meet people  
and network can prove invaluable. Business 
contacts are increasingly made online, through 
targeted research or in business networking 
groups, but there is still no substitute for old-
fashioned, face-to-face networking.
Valuing networks
Networking is about building relationships,  
not selling. Your network should include not  
just customers, but others in your profession  
or trade with whom you can share experience,  
as well as suppliers, consultants, and others  
with influence. Do not forget about internal 
networks, which may be as important as

Working a conference
Try not to take too much with you to a conference.  
If you’re loaded with bags, files, a laptop, and  
stacks of sales brochures, it’s hard to appear  
cool and collected.  
INTRODUCTIONS
At conferences, make an effort to introduce your contacts to other 
people. The generally accepted rule is to introduce the junior person to 
the more senior. So, introduce a colleague to a customer or a manager  
to a director. Try to say something about the person you are introducing 
that will provide a starting point for conversation. For example: “Leo, I’d 
like to introduce Annabelle, who worked on our corporate responsibility 
program.” Don’t hesitate to ask someone to introduce you to one of their 
contacts if it’s difficult for you to do so yourself.
In focus
Choosing an event
Conferences are excellent arenas for networking, 
because they bring together a group of individuals 
who have a variety of interests in a common subject. 
At a conference on corporate responsibility, for 
example, you are likely to meet people from other 
organizations who are in a similar position to you,  
as well as experts in various aspects of the subject. 
You may make contacts with suppliers of equipment 
that could reduce your company’s environmental 
impact, or consultants who could provide advice.

than a few minutes.
BE SELECTIVE

Introducing yourself
If you don’t know anyone, join a group of 
two or three people who don’t appear too 
engrossed in conversation. Smile, and 
say something like, “Hello, I hope I’m not 
interrupting your conversation. I’m …”. 
Give your name and company. In almost 
all cases they will smile back and invite 
you to join them. 
Where possible, try to enlarge the 
group you’re talking with. This enables 
you to meet more people and makes  
it easier for you to move on when it  
is appropriate. Do this by noting any  
people standing nearby, and turning 
toward them when you speak. By 
addressing your comments to them  
as well as the group, you will bring  
them into the conversation. 
Connecting with delegates
Be attentive to the people in your group, 
don’t scan the room beyond for other 
prospects—this makes it impossible  
to create rapport. Ask open questions 
that will reveal common ground, and be 
sure to give other people in your group  
an opportunity to speak. 
Exit your conversations politely. If  
you want to keep in touch, make sure  
that you exchange business cards. There 
are rules about giving and receiving 
business cards in some countries, 
however, so do your research before 
attending international gatherings.

Networking time will

record and follow up your 
contacts. Your record  
can be very simple—a 
note of name, company, 
and contact details, the 
context of the meeting,  
a brief account of what 
was said, and a summary 
of what you think this 
person could do for  
you, or vice versa. Some

even more useful to you.

Defining the role
Mentors are people who guide others 
through periods of change toward  
agreed objectives. They can help you in  
a number of ways. First, they can enable 
you to work through your problems in  
a safe environment. They may not solve 
your problems for you (you need to learn 
to do so), but they will ask questions to 
make you analyze your position and alert 
you to pitfalls or alternatives. Second, 
they can give advice. This may be in the 
form of what to do, or who to approach 
within the organization to obtain help. 
They may point you toward training  
and development programs, or suggest 
projects that you should consider  
being involved with. 
Third, they may open up your career. 
They may have access to interesting job 
opportunities before they become widely 
available and may suggest roles that you 
would never have considered. If they are 
external to your company, they may have 
their own network of contacts, but don’t 
expect this as part of the relationship.
Choosing a mentor
Your organization may run a 
mentoring service, but if they do 
not, you will have to set up a more

The person you select as your 
mentor must, of course, possess 
the experience you want to access 
and should also be someone with 
whom you can build a good working 
relationship. He or she may not be a 
technical expert in the field in which 
you are working. This can be a real 
advantage because it enables you  
to work through issues from a  
fresh perspective. 
Working with a mentor
Finding and using a good mentor can be highly beneficial both to your 
career and to your personal well-being. A good mentor is impartial, has 
more experience than you in key areas, and acts as a safe and effective 
sounding board for your ideas.

Mentoring in-house
Mentors are typically separate from 
the line-management relationship, 
but your boss may be the ideal 
candidate, especially when the 
difference in age and seniority is 
large. Some companies establish 
roles where this is designed to 
happen—Assistant to the Managing 
Director, for example. 
If you have a very senior manager 
or director as your mentor, it can 
open doors to people whom you 
would not normally meet. Also,  
it may give you insights into the 
organization’s political process, 
identify career opportunities, and 
protect you when things go wrong. 
Qualities of a good mentor
The attributes of a good mentor depend 
on your circumstances and on your 
specific role, but he or she should  
always be: 
•  Someone you respect and trust,  
and who won’t always just agree  
with what you say
•  Someone you consider to be a  
role model
•  Someone who listens, probing what 
you say in order to understand you
•  Someone who is genuinely interested 
in you and what you want to do, and 
who is available when  
you need help.
THINK BEFORE 
YOU SPEAK
Remember that 
your boss is part  
of the organization, 
so if he or she is 
your mentor, be 
cautious about 
being completely 
open about every 
aspect of your 
ambitions or 
personal life.

Achieving promotion
Getting promoted within your organization depends 
on being seen to be doing a good job and having the 
capability of doing a bigger job. You will probably 
need to improve your visibility within the company 
and cultivate key internal contacts, so become 
known more widely. Try putting yourself forward  
as a spokesperson for your team, or devise 
presentations on aspects of your work that  
you can deliver to a wider audience. Many large 
organizations run fast-track schemes, so make  
sure both your boss and the Human Resources 
department know you are interested.
Considering options
A job is not just its title—it is the 
experience you gain and what you will  
be able to make of this experience in  
your later career. If you are in a clerical 
role, for example, why not volunteer to be 
involved in the continuous improvement 
program. And if people don’t see you as 
management material, volunteer for an 
external role, perhaps with a charity,  
and develop your leadership skills that 
way. Talk to your boss about opportunities 
that may be open to you. If you are a 
valued employee, your organization  
will be interested in your future.
Changing jobs 
You may need to leave your current 
organization to achieve your aims, but 
don’t act without careful consideration. 
Ask yourself where you want to go to 
next, rather than focusing on escaping 
from the present. How will your move 
look on your résumé three or five years 
from now? Future employers usually 
look favorably on an internal promotion 
on your résumé. Above all, try very  
hard never to leave a job on a sour 
note—you will probably need an excellent 
reference or testimonial from your 
current employer to get your next job.
Moving on
For some, the ideal career is a series of well-timed promotions within 
one organization, but gaining job satisfaction often necessitates finding 
a new role in a new company. Each move you make should give you  
the experience to progress in your career, so you should choose  
your opportunities carefully. But when is the right time to change  
and when is it better to stay put?

Qualifications These give an indication of your potential and so are 
particularly important in more junior jobs. Even working toward  
a qualification signals commitment and ambition to your current,  
or future, employer. Examine job listings in your area of expertise  
and analyze what qualifications employers are seeking; if you don’t 
have them, enroll in a suitable course. 
Experience There is no substitute for experience, but employers are not 
necessarily looking for candidates who have spent long periods in the 
same role—two or three years is often adequate. If you have spent less 
time in a role, and particularly if you have moved several times, you may 
be seen as someone who lacks commitment. If you have held one job for 
much longer, you may be perceived to be too set in your ways.
Experience is what you gain from each job and each project you 
undertake. If you make a mistake, learn from it. Reflect on everything  
you have done and what you have learned. Also, use someone to help  
you through a project so you can learn in real time. A mentor, a good 
colleague, or even a family member can sometimes fulfill this role.
Skills Many of the basic skills you will need in any job, such as 
negotiating, presenting, managing your time, and chairing meetings, 
have been covered in this book. To hone your skills, identify your 
preferred learning style and choose development experiences that  
best suit you:
•  Do you learn best from reading books, trade magazines, or online 
training material?
•  Do  you prefer learning in the classroom, at conferences, or from 
colleagues? Short courses give you the opportunity to develop 
specific skills away from your colleagues, in a safe environment.
•  Do you learn best by doing the task? A great way to learn something 
is by teaching it to someone else.

Position Impressive job titles will look good on your résumé and may get  
you an interview, but they are no substitute for experience. Discrepancies  
are sure to come to light when you are interviewed by your new employer,  
so be realistic. 
When you apply for a new job, check that the content of the advertised 
role matches the title. Is it really going to offer you the experience you  
want? For example, the title of Assistant General Manager may sound  
great, but in reality, will you be deputizing for the General Manager or  
will you be little more than a clerical assistant?
Success Most recruiters are looking for success and may not even 
shortlist you for interview if they don’t see evidence of progression  
on your résumé. More astute recruiters will want to examine how  
you have dealt with difficult and challenging situations. They want  
to see if you are someone who learns. To address this requirement, 
present yourself through a success story about your past. For example, 
compare the two statements below: 
•  “I was financial controller of a division in North Dakota for three  
years and every month the books were closed on time.”
•  “I led a project to replace the accounting system with new software:  
it was delivered on time and within the budget.”
•  The second statement clearly conveys success, where the  
first simply describes a role. Showing that you have taken up 
development opportunities and have been successful makes  
your résumé stand out from the crowd.

EFFECTIVE 
COMMUNICATION

Communication is more than just a way to get ideas 
across or exchange points of view. It is the process by 
which we interact with others and seek information 
essential to our daily lives, allowing us to control  
the circumstances in which we work.

Defining communication
Understanding each other
Humans aren’t the only beings who 
communicate—virtually all forms of life 
are capable of sending and receiving 
messages. People, however, are the only 
living organisms known to communicate 
Think of communication as a process, involving senders and receivers 
who encode and decode messages that are transmitted by various media 
and that may be impeded by noise. The aim of this process is to elicit 
feedback in order to generate a desired effect or outcome.
Defining levels of communication
INTRAPERSONAL
Communication within ourselves, sending messages to  
various parts of our bodies, thinking things over, or working 
silently on a problem.
INTERPERSONAL
Communication between or among people, sending messages 
from one person to another—verbally and nonverbally—with the 
hope of transferring meaning from one person to another.
ORGANIZATIONAL
Communication in the context of an organization, sending  
and receiving messages through various layers of authority and  
using various channels to discuss topics of interest to the group 
we belong to or the company we work for.
MASS OR PUBLIC
Sending messages from one person or source to many people 
simultaneously, through television, the internet, or print media.
not just with signals and signs, but 
through the use of symbols with 
agreed-upon meanings. If we think  
about communication as the transfer  
of meaning, then for each of us, 
successful communication means  

DEFINING COMMUNICATION    /    239
REDUCE NOISE 
The ultimate success of the 
communication process 
depends to a large degree  
on overcoming noise, so 
make an effort to keep your 
messages clear, concise,  
and to the point.
Tip
Understanding the principles
Communication involves a number of 
principles, which apply across time  
and cultures. The process is always: 
•  Dynamic It is constantly undergoing 
change.
•  Continuous Even when you hang up 
the telephone, you’re communicating 
a message that you have nothing  
more to say.
If communication is the 
transfer of meaning, then 
for successful communication 
to occur, you should understand 
something just as I do
•  Circular Communication is rarely 
entirely one-way. We each take  
in information from the outside  
world, determine what it means,  
and respond.
•  Unrepeatable Even if we say 
something again in precisely  
the same way, our listeners have 
heard it before, and so respond  
to it differently.
•  Irreversible We cannot “unsay” 
words: their effect remains even  
if we’re asked to disregard them.  
•  Complex We all assign slightly 
different meanings to words.  
This variation is a product of  
our backgrounds, education,  
and experience, and means  
that there is always the potential  
for misunderstanding.
that you will understand something  
just as I do: we are in agreement about 
what the sender intended and what the 
receiver ultimately understood.

240    /    UNDERSTANDING COMMUNICATION SKILLS
Overcoming barriers
Unblocking your communications
The information we receive about the world comes from our 
senses. It is possible, however, for our senses to be impaired 
or for the source of the message to provide inadequate 
information to be reliably decoded. In sending messages  
to others, we must be sensitive to the fact that they may  
not see, hear, touch, taste, or smell in the same way we do. 
Why do attempts at communication often fail? Broadly speaking, there 
are two barriers that keep us from communicating successfully: the 
operations of our bodies and our minds, and our assumptions that other 
people understand and react to the world in the same way that we do.
Overcoming barriers 
to communication
Be aware that different 
backgrounds, education,  
and experience give people 
different expectations. Your 
way of seeing the world is  
not the only one.  
Never make a judgment 
before knowing the 
facts about a situation. 
Acknowledge that you 
are usually working with 
incomplete data.
CONSIDER CULTURE
BANISH PREJUDICE

Ensuring understanding
Communication is more than sending  
and receiving messages; if the message  
has been delivered but not understood, no 
communication has taken place. Everything, 
from the culture in which we live to the norms 
or standards of the groups to which we belong, 
can influence how we perceive the messages, 
events, and experiences of everyday life.  
Even individual mindsets, such as holding 
stereotypes, can set up barriers, affecting 
what we understand and how we react to 
outside stimuli.
Learn to recognize the barriers likely to 
block your communications, and focus on what 
you can do to overcome them. When speaking 
to someone, for example, constantly monitor 
their reactions to confirm that you are being 
fully understood. 
Don’t assume that  
all members of a  
group share the  
same characteristics. 
Put aside any 
stereotypical views 
you may have; treat 
each person as  
an individual.
Try to present your 
arguments rationally  
rather than 
emotionally, and 
accept that other 
people may have 
strong feelings  
about a subject.
Recognize that 
language has 
different levels of 
meaning. People will 
respond differently 
to the same words, 
especially if the 
words are vague  
or general.
In sending messages 
to others, we must 
be sensitive to  
the fact that they 
may not see, hear, 
touch, taste, or 
smell in the same 
way that we do

Communicating at work
Tailoring your approach
Several factors alter the way we look  
at communication in the business 
context. We all have a personal 
communication style, but within an 
organization you often have to adapt 
your approach to accommodate the 
needs of those you work with and work 
for. If you put the preferences of your 
audience—particularly your boss and 
your clients—above your own, you will 
often get what you want faster. The way 
you communicate also depends on your 
position within the organization. The 
higher your level of responsibility,  
the more you have to take into account 
when communicating. And as you 
become more accountable, you need 
to keep better records—a form of 
communication to yourself that  
may later be read by others.
Adapting to your environment
Organizations, like the people who work 
in them, are in constant flux. Businesses 
change by necessity with the conditions 
of the marketplace and the lives of  
the managers who run them. Your 
communications must adapt to the 
conditions in which you find yourself. 
However, this never constitutes a reason 
for signing your name to a document that 
is false, or passing along information 
that you know isn’t true.
Communication is a skill that is central to the human experience.  
We each know how to do it; we’ve done it since birth and receive 
additional practice each day. So why is it so difficult to communicate on 
the job? As a manager, it is important to understand how the workplace 
changes the nature of communication, for both sender and receiver. 

COMMUNICATING AT WORK    /    243
Matching the culture
All communication must work within  
an organization’s culture. The accepted 
approach can vary considerably between 
different organizations: some companies, 
for example, require every issue to be 
written in memo form and circulated 
before it can be raised in a team 
meeting. Other organizations are 
more “oral” in nature, offering 
employees the opportunity to talk 
things through before writing 
anything down. 
Many companies rely on a 
particular culture to move day-to-day 
information through the organization. 
To succeed in such a business, you 
must adapt to the existing culture 
rather than try to change it or ask  
it to adapt to you.

Getting people to listen to what you say, read what you write, or look at

attention to your message is in their best interest? The key to ensuring

It’s all too easy to stereotype an audience,

the clock. Make sure you have collected 
all the information available about  
your audience, and refer to the key 
characteristics as you prepare  
your speech or document.
Tip
MESSAGE
What should your message contain? How should your message  
impart the information? Should your message be broad  
or detailed?
MEDIUM
What’s the best way to send this message? Is one medium quicker or 
cheaper than another? Will one offer a better opportunity for feedback 
or carry more detail?
CODE
Will your audience understand the words you’ve used? Will the words and 
images mean the same thing to the audience as they mean to you? Do 
these words and images have multiple meanings for various audiences?
FEEDBACK
How will you know if you’ve communicated successfully?  
Will the audience response be delayed? Will it be filtered  
through another source? 
NOISE
How many other senders and messages are out there? Whose message 
traffic are you competing with? Will others try to deflect, distort, or 
disable your communication attempts?
Who will receive the 
message? What is 
your relationship 
to them? What do 
they need to know? 
What action do you 
want them to take? 

246    /    UNDERSTANDING COMMUNICATION SKILLS
Understanding your audience
Who are these people you’re 
communicating with? What do you  
know about them? What do they know 
about you or your subject? How do  
they feel about it? When preparing  
to communicate, ask a few simple 
questions about the people in your 
audience. Once you know more  
about them, you can find ways to 
motivate them to listen.
Audience backgrounds
When you’re assessing your audience, 
look for any similarities in personal 
backgrounds. For example, what is the 
average age of audience members? 
Consider whether they will be familiar 
with the concepts you plan to speak 
about, and the sort of life experiences 
they may have had. Next, think about  
the education level of your audience.  
This will have a significant influence on 
the content of your talk or document, 
including its central themes and the 
vocabulary you employ. The personal 
beliefs of your audience are an important 
factor to take into account when planning 
what you will say. Are they liberal or 
conservative? What is their political 
affiliation? Are they committed  
to a particular religious or social  
point of view?
Considering ethnicity
The ethnic origin of members of your 
audience may be worth knowing, but 
don’t overestimate its value. The utility  
of this information may lie in knowing 
which issues and positions are of 
greatest concern to members of a 
particular ethnic group. The limitation 
lies in knowing that you cannot 
reasonably stereotype the views of all 
members of such a group. Sensitivity to 
ethnic issues and language styles should 
be sufficient as you prepare a speech.

GENDER TRAITS
Gender refers to the social and 
psychological expectations,  
roles, and views of men and 
women. Considerable evidence  
now indicates that this may be 
among the least useful pieces  
of information to know about  
your audience. Why? Because  
study after study has shown  
no statistically significant 
difference in the responses of 
professional men and women to  
a wide range of stimuli. Clearly, 
knowing that your audience might 
be composed exclusively of one  
sex or another might alter your 
approach somewhat, but you  
would be unwise to assume  
that you should communicate  
in one way for men and another  
for women.

248    /    UNDERSTANDING COMMUNICATION SKILLS
Socioeconomic factors
For certain forms of communication, 
knowing the economic status and 
lifestyle of your audience is especially 
important. Gain as much information 
as you can about the following:
•  Occupation Knowing how people 
earn their living will tell you 
something about their educational 
background and their daily routines, 
as well as their motivations  
and interests.
•  Income Knowing how much money 
an audience makes can give you 
some idea of what their concerns 
are. The less they make, the more 
they will be driven by basic needs, 
such as food and housing. American 
psychologist Abraham Maslow 
documented the hierarchy of  
human needs, showing that  
higher level needs—such as 
Targeting your communication
self-actualization—are only 
relevant to people once their  
more basic needs have been met.
•  Socioeconomic status This term 
describes where your audience  
is located in the social/economic 
spectrum. It is, of course, a 
direct function of other factors, 
such as income, education, 
occupation, neighborhood, 
friends, family, and more. 
Think of this as a single 
descriptor that explains 
just how much prestige 
your audience has in the 
eyes of others in their 
own society, and use  
it to target your words 
to address their 
problems, hopes, 
and needs.

PLANNING YOUR APPROACH    /    249
MANAGE EXPECTATIONS
Always let your audience know what to expect, and deliver 
what you promise, never less. People are disappointed only 
if their expectations exceed what they actually receive. 
EXPLAIN YOUR POSITION
Use words that your audience will understand and concepts  
they can relate to. This means, of course, that you must know 
who your audience are, as well as what they know and how  
they feel about the subject.
WORK WITHIN OBJECTIVES
All of your communication should be consistent with and directly 
supportive of the strategic objectives of your organization—its 
vision, values, and beliefs.
ADAPT TO YOUR AUDIENCE
Appeal to the basic needs (shelter, sustenance, safety, 
companionship, or social approval) of your intended audience 
or their senses (use motion, color, and sound). What can you  
do to hold their attention?
KEEP THEM ON SIDE
Make your audience resistant to counter-persuasion  
by asking for a tangible, preferably public, commitment 
from them, or reminding them of the benefits to be derived  
from doing as you ask.
MOTIVATE YOUR AUDIENCE
Encourage your audience to accept and act on your message by 
appealing to authorities that they respect, the social conformity 
displayed by others they know or admire, the rationality of your 
argument, or their desire to behave in consistent ways.

Matching the message
Hitting the right  
knowledge level
A thorough knowledge of what your 
audience already knows about  
your subject is useful in a number  
of ways. First, it tells you where  
to begin. Don’t speak down to the 
audience by explaining fundamentals 
they already understand. Second,  
don’t start above their heads. Begin  
at a point they are comfortable with 
and move on from there.

Even more important than what the 
audience knows about your subject is 
how they feel about it. What they know 
about taxation is far less relevant than  
how they feel about it when they listen  
to a talk about tax reform. You need to 
tailor your words carefully to what the 
emotional response of your audience is 
likely to be. The greater the degree of 
ego involvement (or emotional response) 
to a given topic, the narrower the range 
Once you know something about the individuals who make up your 
audience, begin to think about how to approach them. You’ll need  
a strategy to help devise the right message and to choose the most 
effective method of communication for your audience.
Establishing the audience’s role
Your message may 
need to reach only 
the audience in front 
of you, or you may  
be relying on those 
people to pass on  
the message to 
others. Think about 
everyone who might 
see or hear your 
message, including: 
 PRIMARY 
AUDIENCE
These are the people 
who will receive your 
written or spoken 
message directly. 
Make sure that  
you understand  
and address their 
needs, interests,  
and concerns.
SECONDARY 
AUDIENCE
Others might read  
or hear of your 
message indirectly. 
Could the 
communication  
be given to a 
reporter, union 
organizer, or 
competitor?

Choosing your medium
Learning to ignore instinct
Many managers choose a form of 
communication instinctively, and not 
always for the right reasons. For 
example, if you need to pass bad  
news to a colleague but don’t want  
to provoke a confrontation, you might 
choose to send an email, even though 
your colleague would prefer to hear 
from you in person. On another 
occasion, you might choose to make  
a phone call rather than write a letter, 
because it seems quicker or easier.
You might make this choice  
even when the message is complex 
and would benefit from extensive 
explanation, detailed description, or 
visual aids. In fact, just two factors 
Writing produces a permanent 
record, can be used to convey 
great detail, is often much more 
precise, and can be used for 
careful wording. If it’s important 
that you say something in a 
specific or exact way, you may 
want to write it down. And, of 
course, if your audience has a 
preference for source material  
or large amounts of detail, such  
as tables or large lists, you can 
provide that information as an 
appendix or attachment to a 
memo, report, or proposal. 
Keep in mind that you may have  
to share your message with many 
people and it may be impractical 
or impossible to speak to each  
of them. Writing in a precise, 
persuasive way may be the  
best approach to influence  
your audience.
Most managers make decisions about whether to write or speak to 
someone based on two criteria: convenience and their own personal 
preferences. But an effective choice of communication medium or 
channel depends on much more than what suits you at the time. 
should govern your choice of medium for 
any message. You should think first about 
the preferences of the person or audience 
receiving your message, and second 
about the characteristics and benefits  
of speaking versus those of writing.
When to write

CHOOSING YOUR MEDIUM    /    253
Speaking provides a richer context—
it includes the use of nonverbal cues 
and allows for more emotion. This 
communication form is less rigid, 
as it leaves no permanent record. 
It may also be much quicker. 
Speaking to others also invites 
their participation. It may be the 
best way to elicit ideas, size up 
other people’s feelings, and even 
discover any possible objections  
to your message before decisions 
have been made and formalized  
in writing. Once something is 
written down, people tend to feel 
committed to that course of action, 
even if the documents can easily  
be revised. A conversation or 
discussion, on the other hand,  
has a more transitory feel to it:  
it is flowing and flexible, and less 
permanent and formal than written 
forms of communication.
TURN OFF THE 
AUTOMATIC PILOT
Don’t just choose the easiest 
form of communication. Stop, 
consider your options, and 
choose the right channel and 
medium for your message.

THE PLATINUM RULE
We’re all familiar with the old rule: 
“Do unto others as you would have 
them do unto you.” It’s a good rule, 
but it contains a small flaw. What  
if others don’t want to receive the 
same treatment as you? What if their 
preferences are, in fact, significantly 
different? The Platinum Rule, 
devised by communication expert 
Tony Alessandra, who has advised 
When to speak
companies such as Apple, Ford, 
and IBM, is a variation of that 
age-old maxim: “Do unto others 
as they want to be done unto.” 
This means treat others as they 
want to be treated, not how you 
think they should be treated. 
Communicate with others in  
the manner that they prefer and 
you’ll get what you want: their 
time, attention, and cooperation.

Two of the most important skills for a manager, 
and often also the most daunting, are to  
stand up in front of an audience and deliver  
a presentation, and to communicate effectively  
in writing, whether in formal business letters, 
email correspondence, or detailed reports.  
For both, clear thinking, preparation, and 
practice are the keys to success.

Planning your speech
Defining substance  
and style
When it comes to giving a speech, 
content is king. Substance matters  
and there is absolutely no substitute  
for knowing what you’re talking about.  
This means that, whenever possible, you 
should select a topic that you know and 
understand, so that you can talk about  
it with confidence. However, this also 
depends on your audience; never forget 
that they are the reason you are in the 
room. Using your knowledge of your 
audience to tailor the content to meet 
their expectations is not a guarantee  
of success, but it is certainly a step  
in the right direction.
Determining your purpose
Before you start to plan the details of 
your speech, make sure that you know 
why you are speaking. If you can’t come 
up with a reason for speaking, then don’t 
speak. Identifying your role as a speaker 
and your importance to the listeners is 
especially important. It may be that this 
audience wants your views on the subject 
at hand and is keenly interested in your 
opinions. Alternatively, your purpose 
may be purely to inform them about a 
topic, and the demand for your opinions 
may not be as high as you imagine.
Find out, too, all you can about  
the context in which the presentation  
will take place. You need to know the 
answers to questions such as: is your 
audience still in the fact-gathering stage, 
or are they ready to make a decision? 
What is their reason for listening to  
you? How urgent is the subject you’ll  
be speaking about? Have recent events, 
either locally or globally, affected their 
view of the topic in any way? Are your 
listeners involved in a process that  
will require them to take action after 
hearing what you have to say?
Preparing for a business presentation is the most important stage of  
the process. While it may seem daunting at first, planning your speech 
becomes much easier once you break the task down into manageable 
steps, ensuring that you address all the relevant issues at the right time.
MAKE TIME  
FOR RESEARCH
You’re being paid for  
your time preparing and 
delivering the speech, but 
the 80:20 rule applies— 
spend around 80 percent  
of your time on research 
and preparation, and  
only around 20 percent  
on practice and delivery.

CASE STUDY
PREPARING TO SUCCEED
Elizabeth Allen, chief 
communications officer of the 
international office supplies firm 
Staples, Inc., was given the task  
of drafting a press-conference 
speech for her CEO, Tom Stemberg, 
to announce Staples’s sponsorship  
of a new sports arena in Los 
Angeles. Ms Allen knew that this 
financial arrangement would be 
covered by the sports press, not 
the business press. She also knew 
that sports figures, civic officials, 
investors, and reporters would be 
in the room: “Many people thought 
the name would be a local, 
California company.… This was a 
Boston company putting its name 
on a Los Angeles landmark. There 
were cultural factors at work here, 
as well as political and business 
factors.” As she considered how  
to prepare the speech, she decided 
three things: she would reduce her 
thinking to one or two main points; 
she would include a few examples 
and anecdotes that the local 
audience would relate to; and  
most importantly, she would cite at 
least one powerful reason why the 
relationship between her company 
and the City of Los Angeles would 
be productive and long-term.

Preparing your speech
Once you have a clear picture in your mind of why 
you are giving the presentation, who your audience 
is, and what they want to hear from you, start to 
make a detailed plan of your speech. This planning 
stage is vital, so make sure that you don’t leave  
it to the last minute. You need to be completely 
familiar with the structure and content of your 
speech by the time you deliver it. There are eight 
key steps to preparing a successful presentation. 
Steps to 
preparing  
a speech
COMPOSE A THESIS 
STATEMENT
Write a one-sentence 
declaration of what you  
want the audience to know, 
understand, believe, or  
do. Make it brief, simple, 
comprehensive, and  
as complete as possible.
DEVELOP THE  
MAIN POINTS
Restrict yourself to just two 
or three main points, so that 
you will have time to explain 
and support them all. Make 
sure that all of your evidence 
relates to and is supportive  
of your principal reason  
for speaking.
GATHER SUPPORTING  
 
MATERIALS
Now gather evidence to 
support your main points. 
Use your knowledge of the 
audience to select the kinds 
of proof that they will find 
most convincing. Make your 
evidence compelling, recent, 
and fully transparent to  
your listeners.
THINK ABOUT  
STRUCTURE
Consider the order in  
which you will deliver the 
information, and think  
about what you will say in  
your introduction, in the  
body of the speech, and  
in your conclusion.

PLANNING YOUR SPEECH    /    259
PREPARE YOUR OUTLINE
Write a one-page outline of 
your speech. Think about the 
issues you plan to raise,  
the sequence in which you 
will address each of them, 
and the evidence you’ll offer  
your audience in support  
of those ideas.
CONSIDER VISUALS
Think about what visuals will 
best enhance your speech, 
by helping to explain, 
reinforce, and clarify your 
main points. Sometimes it is 
easier to show the audience 
something than to say it.
WRITE THE SPEECH
Now prepare the content of 
your speech in detail. Some 
people choose to write in 
short bullet points, others 
write their script out more 
fully. Choose the way that 
best suits you, but remember 
that your audience want to 
hear you speak to them,  
not read to them.
Your purpose may  
be purely to inform  
your audience about a 
topic, or to deliver your 
opinions and judgments
You must be completely 
familiar with both the 
structure and the content 
of your speech by the  
time you deliver it
PREPARE YOUR NOTES
Finally, transfer your speech 
into the notes you will use  
to deliver it. These may be  
bullet points on a PowerPoint 
presentation, written notes  
on notecards, or the full 
manuscript.

Developing visual support
Behavioral scientists have known for many years that visual images  
can have a powerful effect on the process of learning. In some cases, 
pictures may reach people who simply don’t listen well to the spoken 
word, or who may not understand what the words mean.
How does visual support help?
Behavioral scientists have found that visual 
support is important in communication for  
three main reasons:
•  It can help explain, reinforce, and clarify the 
spoken word during a presentation. If you 
can’t say something easily, you may be able  
to show it to your audience.
•  Some people pay more attention to what they 
see than what they hear, and can more quickly 
and easily recall information and concepts 
with a visual component than those that  
are just spoken aloud.
•  People tend to recognize ideas most easily 
when they are presented as a combination  
of both words and pictures, rather than when 
presented as either words or pictures alone.

CHOOSE THE RIGHT CHART
Charts and graphs are a useful 
way to display data. Be sure to 
select the type of chart (such as a 
pie chart, bar chart, or line graph) 
that most clearly illustrates  
any comparisons you want to 
make, and use color carefully  
to emphasize your point.
Tip
Choosing when to use it
Displaying information in a visual manner will enhance most 
presentations, but tends to work best:
>
> When you have new data for your audience
>
> When the information you hope to convey is complex  
 
or technical in nature
>
> If your message is coming to the audience in a new context
>
> For certain types of information—such as numbers, quick  
 
facts, quotations, and lists 
>
> For explaining relationships or comparisons
>
> For revealing geographical or spatial patterns
Visual support  
can help explain, 
reinforce, and  
clarify the spoken 
word: try showing 
as well as telling

262    /    SPEAKING AND WRITING
Using visuals effectively
Good visuals have a number of 
characteristics in common. The most 
important is simplicity. The more 
complex a visual display becomes,  
the more difficult it is for an audience  
to understand. Keep your visuals clear, 
ordered, and simple when trying to 
explain an important idea or relationship.
Good visuals use color to explain and 
attract. Very few people tend to have 
exactly the same taste in colors, but 
almost everyone appreciates occasions 
when colors are used meaningfully and 
consistently. Certain traditions, such as 
Using visuals well

information. Try using a simple legend  
to explain color use on your charts and 
graphs; it helps the audience and will 
ensure consistency and simplicity in  
your visual aids.

Improving your confidence
It’s one thing to know your material. It’s another matter entirely to 
believe that you can get up on stage and speak with confidence to a group 
of strangers. Understanding your message and having a well-organized 
speech are important to your success, but so is self-confidence. 
KEEP NOTES SIMPLE
Losing your place in  
lengthy notes can give your 
confidence a serious knock, 
so make sure your notes are 
quick and easy to use, giving 
you the information you need 
at a glance.
Tip
Improving your delivery
Rehearsal will help improve your speech 
and raise your level of self-confidence. 
Simply knowing that you’ve been through 
the contents of your speech more than 
once builds familiarity and is reassuring. 
It will also ensure you talk for the correct 
amount of time. A run-through or two will 
show whether you have too much, too 
little, or just enough to say. Rehearsal 
will also help you improve your 
transitions. By practicing your speech, 
you‘ll be able to identify the rough spots 
and work on smoothing the transition 
from one point to another and from  
one part of the speech to another.
Using notes
The best speakers seem to  
confidently deliver their speeches 
extemporaneously, or “from the heart,” 
without notes. Such speeches aren’t 
really memorized word-for-word, but 
rather are thoroughly researched, well 
rehearsed, and professionally supported. 
Many extemporaneous speakers will use 
their visual support—usually PowerPoint 
slides—to prompt their memories. 
Others prefer to work from bullet points 
on notecards, or use the full manuscript. 
Whichever you choose, make sure that 
your notes are simple, easy to follow,  
and allow you to maintain eye contact 
with the audience.

Becoming a better writer
Very few people think writing is easy. Good writing—that is, writing  
with power, grace, dignity, and impact—takes time, careful thought,  
and revision. Such writing is often the product of many years of  
training and practice. Even though writing may sometimes seem  
like hard work, with a little effort you can learn to do it well.
Organizing your writing
Good business writing is simple, clear, 
and concise. By not calling attention to 
itself, good writing is “transparent,” 
helping the reader focus on the idea you 
are trying to communicate rather than on 
the words that you are using to describe it.
The key to good business writing is 
organization. You need to know where 
you are going before you start, so do your 
research and identify the key issues you 
need to cover. Compose a list of the most 
important points, and use them to create 
Have I explained 
adequately?
Does my writing flow in a 
logical way, and have I given 
complex explanations in a 
step-by-step form?
Have I ”translated“ any 
technical terms?
an outline. If your document will include 
an overview section containing your 
purpose for writing, write this first. Next, 
tackle the most important paragraphs, 
before filling out the details and any 
supplementary material.
Use simple, down-to-earth words,  
and avoid needless ones and  
wordy expressions

BECOMING A BETTER WRITER    /    269
Writing for clarity
When composing a memo, letter, or 
report, keep in mind that your reader 
often doesn’t have much time: senior 
managers, in particular, generally have 
tight schedules and too much to read. 
They need your written communication  
to quickly and clearly give them the 
details they need to know. 
Ensure that your writing style is  
both precise and concise. Use simple, 
down-to-earth words, and avoid 
needless ones and wordy expressions. 
Simple words and expressions are more 
quickly understood and can add power  
to your ideas. Be direct and avoid vague 
terms such as “very” and “slightly”;  
this will show that you have confidence  
in what you are saying and will add  
power to your ideas. Make sure, too, that 
everything you write is grammatically 
correct—you don’t want your busy reader 
to have to reread your sentences to try to 
decipher their meaning.
Keep your paragraphs short; they are 
more inviting and more likely to get read. 
If your document must include numbers, 
use them with restraint—a paragraph 
filled with numbers can be difficult to 
read and follow. Use a few numbers 
selectively to make your point, then  
put the rest in tables and graphics.
ALWAYS EDIT
Revising and editing are 
critical to good writing. 
Putting some time between 
writing and editing will  
help you be more objective. 
Revise your writing with the 
intent to simplify, clarify, and 
trim excess words.

THE RIGHT ORDER
A poorly organized letter reads like 
a mystery story. Clue by clue, it 
unfolds details that make sense 
only toward the end—if the reader 
gets that far. Your job is to make it 
easier for the reader, by explaining 
each point with an overview, 
followed by details. To avoid  
any confusion, always give 
directions before reasons, requests 
before justifications, answers before 
explanations, conclusions  
before details, and solutions before 
problems. Try the approach used in 
newspaper articles. They start with  
the most important information and 
taper off to the least important.
Making your writing come alive
To escape from outdated, excessively formal  
writing styles, try to make your writing more like 
your speaking, and then ”tidy it up.” Imagine your 
reader is in front of you and aim all the time for 
writing that is clear, fresh, and easy to read. You may 
need to write a first draft for structural purposes, 
and then go back over your document. 
 VIGOROUS AND 
DIRECT
Use active 
sentences and 
avoid the passive 
voice. Be more 
definite by limiting 
the use of the  
word “not.”
Make sure that your writing is:

 MADE UP OF SHORT 
SENTENCES
This won’t guarantee clarity, 
but short sentences will 
prevent many of the 
confusions that can easily 
occur in longer ones. Try  
the ear test: read your 
writing aloud and break 
apart any sentence you  
can’t finish in one breath.
 CONNECTING WITH  
THE READER
Reach out to your reader by 
occasionally using questions. 
A request gains emphasis 
when it ends with a question 
mark. Rather than writing, 
“Please advise as to whether 
the meeting is still scheduled 
for February 21st,” simply 
ask: “Is the meeting still 
scheduled for February 21st?

USE CONTRACTIONS
Make your writing softer  
and more accessible by 
occasionally using the 
contractions that we naturally 
speak with, such as “I’m,” 
“we’re,” “you’d,” “they’ve,” 
“can’t,” “don’t,” and “let’s.”
ALLOW SENTENCES TO  
END WITH A PREPOSITION
Don’t reword a sentence just to move 
a preposition (e.g. “after,” “at,” “by,” 
“from,” “of,” “to,” or “up”) from the 
end. You are likely to lengthen, tangle, 
and stiffen the sentence.

Meeting your reader’s needs
Before you write, find out what the 
reader expects, wants, and needs. If  
you later discover that you must deviate 
from these guidelines, let the reader 
know why. When composing your 
document, don’t include material that 
you don‘t need: you may be accused of 
missing the point. Make sure, too,  
that you always separate facts from 
opinions in your writing. The reader 
should never be in doubt as to what  
you know to be true, and what you  
think may be the case. Always apply  
a consistent approach to avoid 
misunderstandings.

USE THE PRESENT TENSE 
WHENEVER POSSIBLE
This adds immediacy to your writing. 
Be careful, however, not to slip from 
the present to the past tense and 
back again, because this will make 
your writing confusing. Select one 
tense and stick to it. 
USE SHORT TRANSITIONS
Use “but” more than “however,” and 
“more than” rather than “in addition 
to.” Use more formal transitions only 
for variety. Don’t be afraid to start a 
sentence with words like ”but,” ”so,” 
”yet,” ”and,” or ”or.”
WRITE WITH 
PERSONAL 
PRONOUNS
Use “we,” “us,” and “our” 
when speaking for the 
company. Use “I,” “me,” 
and “my” when speaking 
for yourself. Either way, 
be generous with the use 
of the word “you.”

Writing a business letter
Business letters are primarily external documents, although 
managers will occasionally use letters to correspond with 
subordinates and executives within their organization. Good letters 
are crisp, concise, and organized so that readers can follow and 
understand the content with little effort.
Writing successful letters
Your success as a business writer 
depends, in large measure, on your 
ability to convince others that what you 
have written is worth their attention.  
This is more likely if your letter meets 
three criteria: it should be concise, it 
should be informal, and it absolutely 
must be organized. Be careful, however. 
Brevity is desirable, but you can overdo  
it. Make sure that your letters are  
not too brief or curt. It is extremely 
important to make sure that your reader 
has enough information to understand 
the subject. Include each issue relevant 
to the subject, and explain the process,  
the outcome, or the decision to the 
satisfaction of the reader. If you  
were receiving the letter, would  
the information be sufficient?  
Would you be satisfied that the  
writer had taken you seriously?
Showing interest
When responding to a letter you have 
received, aim to show that you are 
genuinely interested. The person writing 
to you thought the issue was important 
enough to write about; you should think 
so, too. Show by your words and actions 
that you care about the person and the 
contents of the letter.
Give everyone the benefit of the doubt. 
Don’t automatically assume that the 
person corresponding with you is doing 
so for the purpose of cheating you or  
your company. 
BE PROMPT
When you receive a business 
letter, always send an answer 
within three business days.  
If you can’t reply within this 
time—because you need to 
speak with someone else  
or gather information—drop 
the writer a note to let them 
know that you are working  
on their problem.
Tip

WRITING A BUSINESS LETTER    /    275
Hitting the right tone
If a correspondent makes a joke, play 
along. Show that you have a sense of 
humor; however, consider the culture  
of your audience and keep in mind that 
some humor may not translate well. 
If you have to deliver bad news by 
letter, say you are sorry. Use phrases 
such as, “I am sorry to say that…” or  
“I regret to say that we’ll be unable to  
[do something] because…” You can 
soften the blow by saying that you’re 
sorry it happened, or that you regret the 
outcome. If it’s bad news and your reader 
thinks you don’t care, you may spark an 
unwanted reaction. If you’re bearing 
good news, say that you are glad: “I am 
delighted to tell you that…” Alternatively 
use a phrase such as: “You will be 
pleased to learn that…”
FORM LETTERS
It may be tempting to compile a “one-size-
fits-all” approach to writing when there 
are many recipients, but it is usually a 
recipe for disaster. A letter must answer 
all of the questions its audience is likely  
to have, responding to their fears, doubts, 
and concerns. In situations in which  
it is absolutely necessary to use this 
approach, you can test market form 
letters, by showing them to several  
people who are (or have been) members 
of the audience in question and asking  
for suggestions for improvement. 
In focus
A letter should  
be informal and 
organized. Brevity 
is desirable, but you 
can overdo it: make 
absolutely sure that 
your reader has 
enough information 
to understand  
the subject
Keep a cool head
Never write and quickly send off an  
angry letter. Venting your spleen in  
an angry, hostile reply to someone may 
make you feel good, but it’s almost never  
a good idea to post such a letter. Take your 
time and cool down before you compose 
an angry letter. Then, if you have written 
something you aren’t sure about, wait until 
the following day so that you can reread 
it before sending. Chances are, you’ll 
think twice about mailing.

Using email and  
texts effectively
Email is now a key means of staying in touch, passing data and graphics, 
and managing the flow of information needed to run a business. Text,  
or SMS, messaging, when properly managed, can also become a 
productivity booster, a direct, interactive link to customers, and an 
essential tool to communicate with other staff.
Pick the subject line of the email 
carefully: make it informative 
and brief so the recipient can 
easily find and act on it.
Be careful with criticism: be 
sure to provide enough context 
and background to avoid a 
misunderstanding.
Keep it short. If you need more 
than three paragraphs, call 
instead or send the material  
as an attachment.
Sending better emails
Reducing your emailing time
Email is a tool; don’t let it become your 
master. Limit the time you spend on 
email by following these tips:
•  Send less, get less Think carefully  
about whether you really need to draft  
new messages or respond to those  
you’ve already received. 
•  Escape the endless reply loop Silence  
in response to an email message may 
feel rude, but is acceptable. If you wish 
to reassure someone that no reply  
is necessary, finish a message with  
“no reply needed,” or a request  
with “Thanks in advance.” Avoid  
asking any questions for which you 
don’t really want or need answers.
•  Think twice about the “cc” box If you 
copy in a large number of people to 
your emails and they all respond with 
a reply that needs an answer, you may 
create unnecessary traffic.

Developing good email habits
Don’t check your email constantly. Check it at regular 
intervals, such as first thing in the morning, once after

your email management. Aim to handle each message 
just once. If it’s unimportant or irrelevant, hit the delete 
key. If you spend more than three hours a week sorting 
ESTABLISH A RESPONSE TIME
If you usually respond to email 
messages immediately, people grow 
to expect an immediate response,

the end of the same day. If it’s really 
urgent, use the telephone instead.

Texts as a business tool
Using text messages to reach out to 
customers is established practice in 
many businesses, but relatively few 
companies use texts for other types of 
business communications. The reason 
for this is that the content of a text

any coherent communications strategy. 
However, texts do have their place in a

Writing reports
Reports are longer and more comprehensive than most documents, 
and are written for the purpose of documenting actions, describing 
projects and events, and capturing information on complex issues. 
They are often written by more than one person for audiences with 
multiple needs and interests.
INCLUDE A  
COVER LETTER
As a courtesy to your reader, 
always include a cover letter  
to accompany the report, 
explaining what the report 
covers and why. Where 
appropriate, include the 
report’s most important 
recommendations or findings. 
Tip
Planning your report
There are three main questions to 
consider when compiling a report: 
•  Who is in your audience? Think 
about their level of interest in the 
content, and their familiarity with 
the issues, ideas, and vocabulary 
you plan to use.
•  What is the ideal format? Consider 
how your readers will use the 
document—will they start from  
the beginning and read through 
page by page, or will they skip to 
sections that interest them most?
• Is the document properly  
 organized? Consider using a  
 bold typeface for headings and  
 subheadings to help organize the  
 information and make it retrievable.
Writing the report
Reports are divided into three 
sections: front matter (including  
title page, abstract, table of contents, 
and list of figures and tables), the  
main body of the report, and end 
matter (bibliography, appendices, 
glossary, and index). Begin the  
main body with an executive  
summary, detailing the report’s  
key points and recommendations. 
Busy executives may only read  
this section, so it must tell them  
all they need to know in order  
for them to agree with your 
recommendations.
Busy business leaders may 
only read the executive 
summary of a report, so  
it must tell them all they 
need to know in order for 
them to understand  
your recommendations

A single page containing the full title of the report, the 
names of the authors, the date of issue, and the name  
of the organization to which the report is submitted.
A paragraph that summarizes the major points. It enables  
a reader to decide whether to read the entire work.
A list of all of the headings within the report in the order 
of their appearance, along with a page number for each.
Reports with more than five figures or tables should 
include a page listing each one with its page number. 
An introductory statement usually written by an authority 
figure. It provides background information and places the 
report in the context of other works in the field.
This describes the purpose, background, or scope  
of the report. 
This provides more information than the abstract, and 
enables readers to scan the report’s primary points. 
These summaries are usually restricted to a few pages.
This forms the main body of the report, and explains 
your work and its findings.
This contains not only concluding remarks but also any 
recommended actions for the readers.
A listing of all the sources consulted to prepare the report; 
it may also suggest additional reading and resources. 
Information that supplements the main report as evidence, 
such as lists, tables of figures, and charts and graphs.
An alphabetical list of definitions of unusual terms used.

Listening to your team
Learning when to listen
Listening is a skill you acquire 
naturally, but can improve upon if 
you’re motivated to do so. The first 
step toward becoming a better 
listener is, surprisingly, to stop: you 
need to stop talking, stop trying to 
carry on more than one conversation, 
and stop interrupting. Let the other 
person speak. As others are talking, 
allow yourself to respond cognitively 
and emotionally, taking in the factual 
information and the tone of their 
remarks, without responding. Then 
ask carefully thought-out questions 
that will clarify what they have said 
and reassure you of its basis in fact.
Studies show that adults now spend more than half of their daily 
communication time listening to someone else speak. As a manager, 
being able to listen effectively and understand others is at the heart  
of creating a team that performs to the best of its ability.
BEWARE WISHFUL

Just because you want to 
hear something doesn’t

Understanding nonverbal 
communication
Most of the meaning transferred from one person to another in a  
personal conversation comes not from the words that are spoken, but 
from nonverbal signals. Learning to read, understand, and use these 
wordless messages isn’t easy, but is essential for effective communication.
Using nonverbal signals
Reading nonverbal signals 
The movement, positioning, and  
use of the human body in various 
communication settings serves  
a number of functions: 
•  To highlight or emphasize some  
part of a verbal message
•  To regulate the flow, pace,  
and back-and-forth nature  
of verbal messages
•  To reinforce the general tone  
or attitude of a message
•  To repeat what the verbal 
messages convey (holding up 
three fingers to indicate the 
number three, for example)
•  To substitute for, or take the place 
of, verbal messages (such as 
giving a “thumbs up” gesture)
Nonverbal cues are often difficult  
to read, especially because there  
are few body movements or gestures 
that have universally agreed-upon 
meanings. A colleague who looks

your posture relaxed.

looking for meaning in a particular 
movement, position, or gesture, be 
careful not to miss more important 
signals that reveal the true feelings

messages being sent. Tears in a 
person’s eyes, for example, might 
involuntarily contradict a message 
telling you that the speaker is fine.

Organizing a meeting
Be clear about the purpose of any 
meeting before you start planning.  
Invite only those people who are directly 
related to your goals, and make sure  
you include all the key decision-makers. 
Once you’ve arranged a time, place, and 
date that is convenient to everyone, send

together the agenda, consider the 
following questions: What do we need to 
do in this meeting? What conversations 
will be important to those who attend? 
What information will we need to begin?
Briefings and meetings are an inescapable part of business life. They  
are a means of sharing information, initiating strategies, perpetuating  
a culture, and building consensus around business goals. Done well, 
they’re good for business and good for morale.

CASE STUDY
A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
As CEO of the international retail 
giant Walmart, David Glass knew 
the company would have to be quick 
off the mark with merchandising 
strategies, particularly in response 
to moves made by competitors.  
Each Saturday morning, when  
sales results for the week were 
transmitted to the corporate 
headquarters, Glass would  
gather key subordinates to share 
information from people in the field. 
They would tell the sales team what 
their competitors were doing;  
the senior team would then  
focus on corrective actions  
they wanted to take. By noon, 
regional managers would telephone 
district managers, and they would 
discuss and agree the changes they 
would implement in the next week. 
“By noon on Saturday,” Glass said, 
“we had all our corrections in place. 
Our competitors, for the most part, 
got their sales results on Monday  
for the week prior. They were 
already 10 days behind.”
Delivering a brief
When giving a briefing meeting, choose 
the delivery that best suits your speaking 
style and the needs of the audience. 
There are three forms to choose from:
•  Memorized presentations These are 
delivered verbatim, just as you wrote 
them. This gives you total control  
over the material, but unless you’re  
a trained actor, there’s a risk that 
you’ll sound wooden and the material 
contrived. Worse yet, you may forget 
where you are and have to start again 
or refer to notes.
•  Scripted briefings These are more 
common, but they can also sound 
stilted. The problem with reading  
is that you risk losing eye contact, 
lowering your chin, and compressing 
your vocal pitch. If you do use a  
script, rehearse carefully and look  
up frequently, making regular eye 
contact with your audience.
•  Extemporaneous briefings These are 
delivered either without notes or with 
visual aids to prompt your memory. 
They are the most effective choice, 
looking more spontaneous, while 
actually being thoroughly researched, 
tightly organized, and well rehearsed.

Communicating to persuade
Whether your are trying to sell a product, convince your superiors  
to release more resources, convince an investor, or win a promotion,  
you need a clear strategy to persuade your audience. Removing the 
barriers to people saying “yes” is a two-way process. 
If you want to motivate people to do 
something, you first have to catch 
their attention. Research shows  
that we selectively choose what to 
pay attention to, both as a defense 
mechanism against sensory 
overload, and because we seek  
out messages with particular  
value for us. We ignore virtually 
everything else. There are two  
ways to capture attention:
• Use physical stimuli, such as  
 bright lights, sound, motion,  
 or color.
• Present stimuli that relate  
 directly to the needs or goals  
 of those you want to persuade.
Next, you need to provide a reason  
for people to act. A persuasive writer 
or speaker is one who can lead  
others to believe in what he or she is 
advocating, and then encourage some 
form of behavior in line with that belief. 
This amounts to giving good reasons 
for what you believe. These are  
not reasons you think are good, but 
reasons your team thinks are good.
Identify the needs and interests of  
your team and connect them to your 
message. Which of their needs are  
you fulfilling? Appeal to their sense  
of rationality—show why it makes 
sense to act on your message. Or  
call on their sense of conformity,  
by showing how well others will view 
them if they act on your message.
GETTING THEIR ATTENTION
PROVIDING A MOTIVATION
Understanding the audience 
Before you can expect your request to

are their interests, their motivators,  
and their possible objections to your 
proposal? Most successful attempts at 
persuasion involve four separate,  
yet related, steps. Following these  
steps won’t guarantee success with  
any particular audience, but they will  
set the stage for the attitudes you’re 
trying to shape in your team and the 
behavior you hope will follow. 

COMMUNICATING TO PERSUADE    /    291
The arguments that you use to 
persuade others can be one-sided, 
presenting your case alone, or 
two-sided, presenting your case as 
well as dealing with real and potential 
counterarguments. Choose your 
approach based on the knowledge  
and preconceptions of your audience.  
If you decide to use a two-sided 
argument, you should:  
• Warn your team that others may try  
 to change their minds. 
• State some opposing arguments  
 and then refute them. If you are  
 aware of an opposing message,  
 consider previewing at least part  
 of it to the audience and then  
 explaining why it is flawed.
• Encourage commitment in some  
 tangible or visible way. It’s more  
 difficult for people to back away  
 from positions for which they’ve  
 publicly proclaimed their support.
Once you have captured the attention  
of those you want to persuade and have 
given them good cause to believe the 
message, you must provide them with  
a clear channel for action. 
First, however, take time to reassure 
them: show them that there is a high 
probability that you can deliver on the 
promised reward. Your team needs to 
know that what you’ve promised will 
actually come true. 
Next, recommend a specific proposal 
for action. Tell your team exactly  
what you want them to do, describe 
how you would like them to go about  
it, and set out a realistic timescale. 
Make sure that everyone on your  
team knows how and when progress 
will be measured and identify  
the end point and the rewards  
for achievement that lie ahead. 
When to use one- or two-sided arguments
ONE-SIDED ARGUMENT
TWO-SIDED ARGUMENT
The audience initially agrees with 
you and your aim is simply to 
intensify support. 
You suspect or know that the 
audience initially disagrees with 
your position.
The audience will not be exposed to 
any form of counter-persuasion.
The audience is not well educated or 
may become easily confused by an 
opponent’s argument or evidence.
You know the audience will be exposed 
to subsequent counter-persuasion.
You hope to produce a more 
enduring result with a 
knowledgeable audience.

Managing conflict
Conflict can arise from a variety of sources, 
but many experts see it as a function of  
such workplace issues as personality, 
personal and professional relationships, 
cultural differences, working environments, 
demands of the marketplace, and of course, 
competition. As organizations increasingly 
use teamwork, differences among team 
members can lead to conflict.
LIMITED RESOURCES
Everything from office space  
to budgets may put people in 
competition with one another. 
Allocate scarce resources  
fairly to avoid this.
VALUES, GOALS,  
AND PRIORITIES
Confrontation can occur when 
people in an organization don’t 
agree on strategic direction  
or basic priorities. Agreement  
on goals, large and small, can 
help to avoid this.

MANAGING CONFLICT    /    293
Identifying the sources of conflict
Not all conflict within an organization is unhealthy, 
but conflict between and among people within  
an organization can quickly become counter-
productive, divisive, and destructive if not 
properly managed. Conflict may develop over  
any number of issues or factors, but these  
five appear regularly:
POORLY DEFINED 
RESPONSIBILITIES
Conflict may result 
from differences 
between formal 
position descriptions 
and daily expectations 
of the job. Review  
and agree who is 
responsible for  
what (and to whom).
CHANGE
Many changes, 
including those to 
annual budgets, 
organizational 
priorities, lines of 
authority, or limits  
of responsibility, as 
well as restructuring, 
mergers, divestitures, 
and layoffs, can 
create anxiety, 
uncertainty, and 
conflict in an 
organization.
HUMAN DRIVE  
FOR SUCCESS
Conflicts can arise  
as a result of the 
natural sense of goal 
orientation that every 
human experiences. 
Many organizations 
actively foster a sense 
of competition among 
their members, 
creating many 
competitors and  
few rewards.

294    /    COMMUNICATING WITH YOUR TEAM
Conflict resolution techniques
Resolving conflicts between team members is an important function of  
an effective manager. To begin the process, you should first ensure that  
both parties acknowledge that the conflict exists and the effects that it is 
having on team performance and morale. It may be that one party sees 
the problem as trivial, or is ignoring the issue. Next, encourage the 
parties to set aside time to address the problem—schedule the first 
meeting, and offer to participate in the process. 
LISTEN CAREFULLY
Find out what’s on people’s  
minds, and ask them what  
they’re thinking and how they feel.
Get people to agree on 
the small stuff first: 
when this happens, the 
big issues become 
easier to address
SEPARATE PEOPLE  
FROM PROBLEMS
Rather than saying “I can’t support you,” 
say “I’m not in favor of that solution.”
FOCUS ON INTERESTS
Don’t focus on a person’s 
demands, but on their 
interests—the reasons 
behind their demands.
RECOGNIZE FEELINGS
Accept feelings in others, and work 
to communicate empathy. Keep 
your own emotions in check, to 
ensure that you act professionally.

MANAGING CONFLICT    /    295
Reconciling 
two sides
CUT YOUR LOSSES
Sometimes the conflict has 
simply gone too far, and you 
must decide to make 
personnel changes.
DEVISE OPTIONS
Find alternatives for mutual gain. By 
working together on the options, you 
can shift the dynamic from competition 
to cooperation.
KEEP COMMUNICATING
Keep the lines of communication 
open and speak as frankly and 
honestly as possible.
FIND THE SOURCE
Track the conflict to its source. 
Don’t accept the first answers  
you find; employees may have 
underlying concerns.
SUMMARIZE THE  
 
AGREEMENT
Review all the details with 
everyone involved. Make 
sure all are in agreement.
START SMALL
Get people to agree on the small 
stuff first. Once they start to agree 
on a few things, the big issues 
won’t be as difficult.

In today’s global economy, you may find yourself 
communicating across companies, countries, and 
cultures, through a variety of media, including 
the internet. Focus on your company’s core goals 
and identity to ensure consistent messaging.

Selling
Closing the sale
First ask the prospect’s opinion about 
the benefits you’re offering, using a 
question such as: “How does this 
sound to you?” If this throws up any 
objections, handle them as they arise. 
Don’t repeat negative statements or 
concerns; focus on positive outcomes. 
There are various ways to close a sale, 
so choose the one that is most 
appropriate to your situation. 
Selling is both a form of persuasion and a process of relationship 
building. Most people don’t want to feel as if they’re being sold 
something; they would prefer to believe that they’re buying it.  
This involves a balance of thoughtful questions, active listening,  
and a well-prepared presentation.
USE THE MINOR  
POINTS CLOSE
Ask the prospect to make 
low-risk decisions on 
minor, low-cost elements. 
Then ask for the order.
Ways to close a sale
Prospecting and presenting
Selling involves actively looking for 
prospects who have the money, the 
authority, and a desire to buy. Before you 
contact a prospect, make sure that they 
fulfill these criteria, and that you know 
both what you want to achieve, and how. 
Develop a presentation that you can 
deliver confidently. This may be entirely 
memorized, formulaic (allowing some 
buyer–seller interaction), or entirely 
flexible and interactive.  
If you’re offering a solution to a specific 
problem, base your proposal around a 
detailed analysis of the buyer’s situation. 
Before you contact a prospect, always: 
•  Determine your call objectives. Are 
they specific, measurable, achievable, 
realistic, and well-timed?
•  Develop a customer profile. What  
do you know about the person who  
is making the buying decision?
•  Familiarize yourself with all the 
customer benefits.
• Develop a sales presentation.

Understanding culture
When you’re communicating with 
a culture other than your own, 
you need to be sensitive about 
the particular beliefs and values 
of that culture, and how they 
differ from your own.
Communicating across 
countries and cultures
Defining culture
Culture is everything that people have, 
think, and do as members of their 
society. Culture affects and is a  
central part of our economy and the 
organizations that employ us. It is 
composed of material objects, ideas, 
values, and attitudes, as well as 
expected patterns of behavior. 
Whatever your business, you’re likely  
to encounter people of different 
ethnicity, citizenship, and cultural 
origin. Dealing with people of different 
cultures, conducting business over 
The industrialized nations of the world are experiencing unprecedented 
change. In much of Europe, for example, it is possible for EU citizens  
to travel from country to country without a passport, conducting 
transactions in a common currency. Barriers to trade have tumbled  
or vanished in recent years, but through it all, each of us has retained 
something essential to our identity as humans: our culture.
CULTURE IS INGRAINED
Few of us would give a moment’s 
thought to learning how to be a 
part of the culture we have grown 
up in. Our first culture is so 
closely defined for each of us that 
we’re barely aware that we have 
one. Learning a second culture, 
though, takes a purposeful effort.
international borders, traveling safely, 
and communicating effectively are  
not always easy, but are essential for 
success in today’s business world.
Culture is composed of 
material objects, ideas, 
values, and attitudes

COMMUNICATING ACROSS COUNTRIES AND CULTURES    /    301
Recognizing change
The culture of any country is constantly 
undergoing change. The clothing people 
wear, the transportation they use, the 
books they read, the topics they talk 
about, and so on, all change over time. 
This is due to the internal forces of 
discovery, invention, and innovation; and 
external forces, including the diffusion of 
ideas from other cultures. Some cultures 
change fast, while others evolve more 
slowly, either by preference or because 
they are more physically isolated. 
Changes in culture are often reflected  
in changes in the way people speak  
and write; make sure that your own 
communications reflect these changes.
INVESTIGATE THE 
SUBCULTURES
Virtually all large, complex 
cultures contain subcultures. 
These are small groups  
of people with separate  
and specialized interests 
—essentially, they are  
niche markets. 
Tip
CULTURE IS UNIVERSAL
All societies have an interest in passing along values 
and norms to their children, thereby creating and 
defining a culture. No matter where you travel, 
you’ll find people with cultures that differ from the 
one in which you grew up; noticing these differences 
will strengthen your communications.
CULTURES ALLOCATE VALUES
Some cultures engage in behaviors that 
others might consider reprehensible.  
Be careful never to cause offense when 
communicating by inadvertently breaking 
taboos or talking about matters that are 
considered “off limits.”

302    /    COMMUNICATING EXTERNALLY
Communicating internationally
On a personal level, communicating 
across international borders means 
becoming more aware of the ways in 
which your thinking or actions are 
culturally biased. 
Start by recognizing that your own 
education, background, and beliefs may 
be considered fine, or even laudable in 
your own culture, but they may not count 
for so much to someone from a different 
country. Take a nonjudgmental position 
toward those from other cultures, and you 
are likely to find that they will extend the 
same hospitable tolerance toward you.  
If you find yourself making personal 
judgments, keep them to yourself. When 
you’re writing or speaking to people from 
another culture, try to understand life 
LEARN TO  
RECOGNIZE “NO”
Some cultures consider it 
rude to say “no.” If you are 
met with vague answers to 
requests, such as “I‘ll try” or 
“yes, but it may be difficult”  
in these cultures, it may be 
safer to assume that your 
request has been refused.
Tip
In focus
ETHNOCENTRISM
All cultures, to one degree or 
another, display ethnocentrism: the 
tendency to evaluate a foreigner’s 
behavior by the standards of one’s 
own culture, and to believe that 
one’s culture is superior to all 
others. We tend to take our own 
culture for granted. We’re born into 
it, and we live with its rules and 
assumptions day in and day out.  
We quickly come to believe that  
the way we live is simply “the way 
things should be.” As a result, we 
often see our behavior as correct. 
However, culture is not value-
neutral. We have good reasons  
for believing and behaving as we  
do, but that doesn’t necessarily 
mean that others are “wrong.”

and their values.

Adopting the right attitude
You don’t have to adopt the local culture 
and begin doing things the way they do. 
Just be aware and respect that they  
do things differently. “Your way” of 
communicating might work brilliantly  
in your own culture, but less well in 
another. Try to adopt an open-minded 
approach, focusing on: 
•  Developing a tolerance for ambiguity 
Accept the fact that you’ll never 
understand everything about another 
culture. However, you can still 
appreciate and function within that 
culture satisfactorily. 
•  Becoming more flexible Things won’t 
always go the way you want. A small 
measure of flexibility will prove 
enormously helpful.
•  Practicing a little humility 
Acknowledge what you do not know  
or understand. Because you weren’t 
raised in another’s culture (or may not 
even speak the language well), you’ll 
never fully understand all aspects of 
it. Displaying humility and acceptance 
will win friends, influence people,  
and make life easier. Communication 
consists of the transfer of meaning,  
so do everything you can to make  
sure that your messages are  
not misunderstood.

around on a website looking for content 
that interests them, navigating back

segments or “chunks” will allow readers 
to quickly find what they’re looking for.  
A well-constructed chunk provides 
readers with a comprehensive account, 
as well as links to related or supporting 
pages. When your content lends itself  
to such treatment, use lists rather  
than paragraphs. Readers can pick  
out information more easily from a list 
than from a fully developed paragraph.

Communicating through 
social media
Devise a strategy 
Social media can be used in many 
different ways—from increasing 
awareness of your company’s brand, 
increasing traffic to your website,  
and forging new business contacts at 
home and abroad, to boosting sales  
or attracting customers to stores. So,  
the first decision you should make is  
to set the purpose of your social media 
interaction. Be specific in your goals,  
and list them in order of importance. 
Next, carry out some research—
formal or informal—into the internet 
habits of your customers or target 
audience: who are they? Which social 
media channels do they use? What do 
they expect from these channels? You 
will have far more success if you tune  
in to the needs of your customers. 
Social channels on the internet—notably Facebook, Twitter, Google  
Plus, and LinkedIn—have transformed the way people do business. A 
social media presence is no longer an option, but an essential—more 
than 80 percent of people are influenced in their buying decisions  
by a brand’s presence on social media. So how do you maximize the 
impact of your social media output?
Focus on success
Always consider how your social  
media activities will translate into 
business growth—there is little point in 
maintaining a costly presence on social 
channels if it doesn’t affect the bottom 
line. Think about how you can measure 
the effectiveness of your activities.

Facebook or Twitter, for example, may

Engaging with your audience
How you communicate through social 
channels depends on your goals (see 
above). However, you should always:
•  Post regularly: a media stream to   
which you contribute sporadically  
will soon dry up.
•  Post interesting comments: try to 
encourage debate, comment, or  
likes, rather than making passive 
statements. 
•  Vary contributors for differing 
perspectives.
•  Always respond to posts from  
users within a reasonable

Preparing for a teleconference
Running a successful and productive 
teleconference depends largely on the 
time you spend planning and preparing for 
it. If possible, find out as much as you can 
about the facility you have chosen before 
the day of the teleconference. If you’re in 
charge, it is up to you to make sure that 
the setting has everything you need. Try  
to meet with the support technician, if 
there is one, and learn what your physical 
responsibilities will involve. 
Recent improvements in technology have made video conferencing an 
essential tool for many businesses. Whether you are using a dedicated 
teleconferencing system or a computer package such as Skype, it is vital 
to plan carefully to avoid technical hitches and make the experience 
rewarding and successful for those involved.

Try moving your computer’s 
video camera closer to you 
so that your head and upper 
shoulders occupy the whole 
screen—any smaller and it 
becomes difficult to see and 
read your facial expressions.
Appearing well
On the day, dress conservatively: avoid 
busy patterns, thin stripes, and small 
prints that draw attention. Act always as 
if people are watching you, and refrain 
from quirky mannerisms—these may go 
unnoticed in a meeting but are magnified 
in a teleconference. Sit up straight, pay 
attention, and project a professional 
image. Make sure you know where the 
camera lens is before you start the call  
—it is not always above the screen. Make 
sure to look directly at the camera lens 
when you are speaking. You’ll enhance 
your credibility dramatically if you focus 
squarely on the camera; others will think 
you’re speaking directly to them.
Succeeding with Skype
Larger companies often have dedicated 
video-conferencing systems housed in 
rooms that are optimized for the purpose 
—and a technician to maintain the facility. 
However, if you work for a smaller  
firm or from home, you will probably  
use a computer-based conferencing 
system such as Skype and so must take 
responsibility for all aspects of a call.

Communicating in a crisis
There is a huge difference between business problems and crises.
Problems are commonplace in business. A crisis, on the other hand,  
is a major, unpredictable event. Without careful communication,  
crises have the potential to damage an organization’s reputation  
and financial standing, together with those of its employees, 
shareholders, products, and services. 
Identifying the crisis
Some business crises can be prepared 
for (to a certain extent), while others 
require an immediate and creative 
response. There are two main types:
•  Internal crises These arise within 
the company, such as accounting 
scandals, or labor strikes.
•  External crises These are caused 
by an external factor, such as a 
natural disaster, a technological 
disaster, or external threats by 
special-interest groups.
CASE STUDY
MERCK & COMPANY
In September 2004, 
pharmaceutical firm Merck & 
Company made the decision to 
remove its painkilling drug Vioxx 
from the market because of 
cardiovascular risks. More  
than 100 million prescriptions  
had been written for the drug. 
Within 60 hours of the initial 
announcement, Merck’s 
communications team launched  
a website and established a 
toll-free telephone number to 
address concerns. Traffic on the 
company’s Vioxx website grew 
from 4,000 hits daily to 234,000 in 
just 24 hours. The toll-free number 
received more than 120,000 calls  
in the first six days following  
the announcement. Without its 
sophisticated web presence and 
competently staffed call center, 
Merck would not have been able  
to address the enormous wave of 
public concern that arose overnight 
about Vioxx, and its reputation 
would have been badly damaged.
It is important to recognize the type of 
crisis you are facing, because this will 
help you pinpoint the groups of people 
you will need to communicate with,  
and give you an idea of how fast and  
how far the effects of the crisis could 
potentially spread.

COMMUNICATING IN A CRISIS    /    313
Dealing with a crisis
Communicating in a crisis is different 
from managing a business problem.  
You are likely to be unprepared, have 
insufficient information, and be under 
time pressure. Crisis communication 
often offers few precedents to work from 
and intense scrutiny from outside the 
organization. This can lead to a loss of 
control and a sense of panic, so it is 
important to keep your head, and 
address the crisis systematically.

Capitalizing on opportunity
Learn to see media interviews as an 
opportunity to reach a large audience. 
They represent a chance to tell your  
story and to inform the public of your 
business or expertise. They also offer an 
opportunity to address public concerns 
and set the record straight, if you’re the 
subject of misinformation in the press. 
Being the subject of a news media interview is never easy, and can be 
stressful and risky. You might say the wrong thing or forget to say what’s 
most important about the subject of the interview, or your comments 
might be taken out context when they’re aired. However, by following a  
few basic rules, you can limit risk and use the interview to your advantage.
Preparing for  
an interview
They can be a forum in which to apologize 
if you’ve done something wrong, and a 
chance to reinforce the credibility of your 
organization and its leadership. Don’t 
feel bullied into giving an interview if 
you’re not ready: you can say “no” or 
delegate to another staff member  
who is more accustomed to dealing  
with the media. 
The best way to ensure 
a good interview is 
thorough preparation.

Building brands
Winning hearts and minds
A brand is, first of all, a promise of an 
experience. It is what a product, service, 
or company stands for in the minds of 
customers and prospects. At its very 
core, a brand is a perception or a feeling. 
It’s the feeling evoked when we think 
about a product or the company that 
delivers it. And, of course, a brand  
is the basis for differentiation in the 
marketplace—a way to separate  
yourself from all other competitors in  
the hearts and minds of your customers.
Communicating the essence of a brand is more than simply using  
words and visuals to convey an image. This is because a brand is both  
a process and a product. It’s a living, breathing organism that must be 
nurtured and protected if it is to survive and thrive.
Defining the brand
The most crucial characteristics of  
a brand are content and consistency.  
To succeed, a brand must make a clear  
Empower your  
entire organization  
to get behind the  
brand. Give them the 
authority, responsibility, 
resources, and training 
to satisfy customer 
expectations.
Be certain that one 
consistent, strategic 
vision drives your goals 
for the brand. Prioritize 
your plan to deliver on 
the promise (what is most 
important and why?). 
Align all stakeholders 
behind the vision.

Communicating brand image
and unambiguous promise to its 
stakeholders (customers, employees, 
investors, suppliers, creditors, and 
others) and then deliver on that promise. 
The Starbucks brand, for example,  
is clearly aligned with the customer 
experience. When regulars in Starbucks’ 
coffee shops began to complain about  
the smell of hot breakfast sandwiches, 
the company’s CEO Howard Schultz 
decided to focus on the core experience 
(and aromas) of freshly ground coffee, 
and the relaxing experience of visiting  
a Starbucks. Retail giant Wal-Mart’s 
brand promise is “Everyday low prices.” 
It makes no promises about customer 
service, brand-name products, or the 
shopping experience.

BUILDING BRANDS    /    317

BRAND VALUE
Brands that have a clear  
sense of themselves and have 
worked diligently to deliver on 
their promises are often quite 
durable, withstanding economic 
downturns, changes in customer 
preferences, and game-changing 
innovations in their product 
category. The value of developing 
brands is highlighted in two 
quotes. John Stuart, former CEO 
of Quaker Oats Company, said: “If 
this company were split up, I 
would gladly give you the property, 
plant, and equipment, and I would 
take the brands and trademarks… 
and I would fare better than you.” 
Carlton Curtis, VP of Corporate 
Communication at Coca-Cola, 
stated: “If all of Coca-Cola’s 
assets were destroyed overnight, 
whoever owned the Coca-Cola 
name could walk into a bank the 
next morning and get a loan to 
rebuild everything.” 
You cannot stand still; you 
must continually innovate  
to stay ahead of the demands  
of the marketplace and the 
shifts in everything from 
demographics to target-
group tastes and preferences. 
Demonstrate that you are 
both innovative and protective 
of the brand experience.
Consistently and 
continually measure 
results. Show your 
investors, associates, and 
business partners what 
you’ve accomplished and 
what improvements you 
have yet to make.
Specify and communicate 
those actions that are 
essential to brand 
success to those within 
the organization who 
must deliver on the 
promise.

PRESENTING

A presentation is a way of informing, inspiring, and 
motivating other people. Whether your audience is a 
group of receptive colleagues, demanding clients, or 
strict regulators, your job is to influence the way they 
think and feel about your message. No matter how 
charismatic you may be, success depends on careful 
planning of your content and delivery.

322    /    PLANNING TO PRESENT
Putting the audience first
Identifying the need
A presentation serves a very different 
purpose from a written report—it is far 
more than just another vehicle for 
information. A presentation allows an 
audience to gain knowledge by watching, 
listening, and being inspired by you. 
Audiences come not to learn everything 
you know about a subject but to gain  
your perspective—they are likely to 
remember only the big themes even a 
short time afterward. Good presenters 
understand that audiences are looking 
for information in context, not in full 
detail, so ask yourself what you can add 
through your presentation of the subject.
Researching the audience
Get to know your audience, even before 
you plan your presentation. Talk to  
the organizer of the event about their 
expectations, and if possible, engage 
with those attending ahead of time;  
ask them about their existing level of 
knowledge, and what they hope to hear 
about. Work out if they need persuading, 
informing, educating, motivating, or a 
mixture of all these. The more you 
understand your audience’s expectations, 
the better you’ll be able to meet them.
Presenting successfully means stepping back from your own knowledge 
of your subject. Examine what you want to say and how you convey that 
information from the perspective of the audience. Their priorities will 
almost always be different from yours.
MIND YOUR LANGUAGE 
Check the language abilities 
of your audience—if you  
do not share the same first 
language, you will need to 
make allowances. 
Tip
Audiences are likely  
to remember only the  
big themes even a  
short time afterward 

PUTTING THE AUDIENCE FIRST    /    323
Focusing your message
Identify the essential information you 
want your audience to understand and 
remember—no more than three such 
core messages. Build your presentation 
around these points and add supporting 
details where necessary—but remember 
that less is more when it comes to 
presentation. Make your key points 
emphatically and repeatedly and don’t try 
to be too subtle or clever. Look for the 
overlap between what you want to say 
and what your audience wants to hear.
MATCH THINKING 
STYLES
Is your audience made up of 
creative thinkers or analysts? 
Bear in mind that you’ll need 
to tailor your presentation 
content and your delivery to 
match their thinking style.

324    /    PLANNING TO PRESENT
Presenting and selling
strength of your “sell.” You need to be 
able to “read” their reactions so that you 
can address their concerns. Successful 
presenters do this by inviting many 
questions from the audience and 
encouraging them to interrupt; the 
questions and comments from the 
audience provide vital feedback.
Pitching your ideas
The better you can meet the needs of  
your audience, the more successful your 
presentation will be. So when selling 
anything, from an idea to a product, your 
presentation should focus on how it will 
help your audience, how it will solve their 
problems. Whenever you talk about your 
idea, product, or service, don’t just list its 
features—express them as benefits. 
Throughout your presentation, your 
audience will be constantly assessing 
both your trustworthiness and the 
Presentations serve a variety of purposes. They can be used to inspire 
and motivate people or they can be designed to convey information 
formally (as in a lecture) or informally (as in a team briefing). But  
most often, they are used to promote a product, service, or idea, or to 
persuade stakeholders about a particular course of action. In other 
words—whether overtly or covertly—most presentations aim to sell.
SELL BENEFITS, NOT FEATURES
The presentation must center on what matters most  
to the buyer—general discussion won’t do. Talk about 
specific benefits. How does the product or service help 
to solve a problem or improve a situation?
BELIEVE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
An animated, enthusiastic presentation is a must. 
Buyers do not want to buy from someone who 
doesn’t appear fully committed to the product,  
even if it is relevant to their needs.

Your presentation should 
focus on how it will help

PRESENTING AND SELLING    /    325
GET TO THE 
POINT
Engage your 
audience by 
addressing what 
they want to know as 
quickly as possible. 
Avoid opening your 
presentation with 
background about 
you or your 
company—when it 
was founded, where 
it’s located, etc.
THE TWO-MINUTE PRESENTATION
We often encounter people casually—
between meetings or in quick 
conversations at conferences. It pays to 
develop a focused two-minute pitch that 
introduces you, your business, and the 
unique value you can offer. The pitch 
should be very easy to understand, 
describe the solutions you offer,  
and reflect your passion about what you 
do. A good two-minute pitch will get you a 
surprising number of follow-up meetings.
In focus
KNOW YOUR STUFF
To establish your credibility, you need to know a 
great deal about your product or service. As well as 
handling general, predictable questions, be prepared 
to demonstrate your knowledge in every respect.  
EXPECT TO CLOSE
If the presentation is effective, the decision to buy, or buy 
in, is a natural next step. Be prepared to ask for some 
kind of commitment and agree to take immediate action, 
even if it is only setting up another meeting.
SHOW, DON’T TELL
Visual representations and physical 
demonstrations bring sales presentations  
to life. People remember what they see  
and do for themselves, so be creative. 
Tip

326    /    PLANNING TO PRESENT
Presenting formally
Keeping focused
When you are asked to make a formal 
presentation, always request guidance 
about what is expected from you—what 
is the desired length, content, and 
context of your material. Play it safe— 
don’t attempt to be too innovative with 
the structure; rather, stick with a tried 
and tested formula.
Preparing to succeed
Before a formal presentation, seek  
out people who know the members of  
the board. Find out everything you can 
about their backgrounds, concerns,  
and predispositions. Use what you have  
learned to prepare your arguments 
carefully; if appropriate, try to gain 
advance support for your position with 
members of the board. 
Confidence is another key success 
factor. You will be expected to take a 
strong stand and support all your 
arguments with compelling evidence. 
Handle challenges with calm assurance 
and keep in mind that it is your position, 
rather than your personality, that is under 
attack. Finally, if you are presenting with 
colleagues, make sure you “get your  
story straight”—that all your materials 
are consistent. 
In many presentations, you are in control of what you say and how you 
say it. But be aware that some types of presentation are much more 
formal, following rules, requirements, timescales, or formats dictated 
by the audience or by a third party. They include presentations to 
boards, regulatory bodies, and examination and assessment panels, all 
of which require high levels of planning and rigorous attention to detail.
Introduce the topic, the 
argument you are about  
to make, and the conclusion  
that you will reach. 
How to structure a 
formal presentation
Presenting to a board 
Keep your presentation concise and 
limit the detail that you include. If 
presenting to a board of directors, for 
example, bear in mind that they don’t 
get involved in day-to-day management 
and have many demands on their time. 
Focus on what they really need to know, 
but ensure you don’t withhold anything 
important—choose your words very 
carefully to ensure that you cannot be 
interpreted as being misleading. 

PRESENTING FORMALLY    /    327
Being a panelist
Panel presentations are often a feature 
of conferences. If you are asked to be a 
panelist, make sure you understand 
the specific areas or questions you 
have been invited to address. Find out 
who is talking before and after you, and 
what they are focusing on to avoid 
repeating their content.
Build flexibility into your 
presentation, since time slots often 
shift to accommodate delays. Make 
sure you have time to present your  
key points. If you feel the topic is too 
complex for the time frame, suggest  
an alternative. 
Following protocol
Some expert panels are very formally 
structured, with individual members 
asked to stand and present on a topic in 
turn before fielding questions from other 
panelists or the audience. Others are 
much looser, with any panelist permitted 
to interject, or add remarks or questions 
at any time. If the format of your panel is 
unstructured, always be attentive while 
others are speaking, don’t interrupt 
others too often, and don’t speak for too 
long. No matter how informal the 
structure, always take the time to develop 
your key messages in advance.
EXPECT TOUGH 
QUESTIONS 
Formal presentations to 
boards and panels  may 
be met with adversarial 
questions—boards may 
view harsh questioning as  
perfectly acceptable, so 
come prepared with 
robust answers. 
Tip
Develop your arguments 
clearly and persuasively, 
justifying what you say.
Facilitate discussion of your 
presentation; check that 
everyone has understood 
exactly how you have arrived 
at your conclusion.
Make a conclusion: 
summarize your main 
arguments and explain the 
relevance of the conclusion 
made; explain why you are 
confident of your conclusion. 
You will be expected to take  
a strong stand and support it 
with compelling evidence

328    /   PLANNING TO PRESENT
Planning the structure
Setting out the basics
All presentation structures share three 
high-level elements: the introduction or 
opening, the body or main content, and 
the conclusion or close. Most of your 
time will be spent delivering the body, 
but don’t underestimate the importance 
of opening with an introduction that 
captures the audience’s attention, and 
tying everything together at the close.
There are many ways to organize your ideas to create an effective and 
convincing presentation. Sometimes, the content you need to convey will 
fall more naturally into one type of structure rather than another. There 
may also be an element of personal preference—you may simply feel 
more comfortable with one type of structure than another. But however 
you choose to organize, the end result must achieve your communication 
goal. In other words, content always dictates form, not vice versa.
Quick and easy storyboarding
Sticky notes are a useful tool when 
storyboarding your presentation. Use a 
different colored note for each type of 
element: for example, blue for a key 
message, pink for each proof point  
that backs up a message, and orange  
for a visual aid. Reposition the notes  
to experiment with running order,  
the balance between “showing” and 
“telling,” and to identify weak sections. 
Storyboarding is a method of sequencing 
your ideas that can help you decide  
how to represent them in a logical  
and compelling order when planning 
your presentation. It adds a physical 
dimension that is especially useful for 
organizing and understanding the impact 
of a presentation using visual aids.
75%
of the presentation should  
be content, 10% should be 
introduction, and 15% 
should be conclusion

PLANNING THE STRUCTURE   /    329
KEEP IT BALANCED
Your structured content 
should fall roughly into these 
proportions: 10 percent 
introduction, 75 percent 
body, and 15 percent 
conclusion. Let each section 
fulfill its function: don’t 
overload the introduction  
or bring in new ideas in  
the conclusion.
Tip
THE INTRODUCTION
Think of your opening as a promise to the audience. It should tell them 
what they are going to hear, and why it is important. This section needs 
to get their attention and give them a reason to keep listening.
THE BODY
This is where you deliver on the promise you made in your introduction. 
Here you deliver the facts, analysis, explanation, and comment to fill out 
your message. Sustain interest by keeping the opening promise in 
mind, and making sure every element advances that goal.
THE CONCLUSION
Your close is the “so what?” of your presentation. Remind the audience 
of your key points and clearly articulate where they lead, or conclusions 
that can be drawn. An effective close demonstrates your conviction 
about the action you are suggesting or the position you hold. While you 
should spend no more than 15 percent of your presentation time on the 
close, remember that it will probably be the section that your audience 
remembers most clearly after you have finished. Whatever you want 
them to remember, say it now.

330    /  PLANNING TO PRESENT
Selecting a 
framework
To structure your presentation for 
maximum impact, choose a framework 
sympathetic to its content. For example,  
if your material is data-driven, use  
a numbered list; if you are selling a 
concept, employ case studies. Described 
here is a selection of useful structural 
alternatives.
NUMBERED LIST 
Use this model to 
present modular 
information such as 
the top competitors 
in your market.

information helps 
your audience to

PROBLEMS AND 
SOLUTIONS
Outline a problem, 
then reveal how to 
fix it. This structure 
is excellent when 
discussing change. 
It can help to 
position you as 
someone who can 
read a situation 
clearly, explain it, 
and offer a way to 
move forward.
FEATURES AND 
BENEFITS 
Work through  
the elements  
of a product or 
proposal and 
explain the 
positive outcomes 
each one can 
generate. This 
method works  
well for more 
persuasive sales 
presentations.
DEDUCTIVE OR 
INDUCTIVE?
Deductive reasoning 
moves from general 
principles to the 
specifics (“our 
market is growing, 
we should do well”); 
inductive reasoning 
moves from specifics 
to principles (“we’ve 
done well, our 
market is growing”).

MESSAGING
Tell them you are 
going to tell 
them, tell them, 
and then tell 
them you have 
told them. This 
simple structure 
works well, 
provided the 
messages are 
clear and backed 
up with proof.
STORIES AND 
CASE STUDIES 
Present your idea 
or argument 
through a good 
narrative. People 
love hearing 
stories, making 
this a compelling 
and forceful 
presentation 
method. Keep 
your story simple 
and explain  
the “moral.”

COMPARE AND 
CONTRAST
Put your material 
in context by 
comparing it with 
something else. 
Ensure that 
similarities  
and differences 
are clear.
OPTIONS AND 
OUTCOMES 
List some 
choices and the 
pros and cons of 
each. Make sure 
the options are 
different, not 
refinements of 
one idea. If you 
are going to 
suggest the best 
way forward,  
be prepared  
to back it up  
with data.
TIMELINE
A chronological 
structure is  
useful for showing 
progressive 
developments.  
Its linear structure 
is intuitive and easy 
to understand.  
To avoid seeming 
one-dimensional, 
ensure that your 
material has both 
purpose and pace.

As your presentation approaches, all the preparation  
you have put into your material and delivery may be 
overshadowed by the prospect of having to perform. Don’t 
worry. There are plenty of techniques that will give you a 
real advantage on the day of your presentation, boost your 
confidence, and help you deal with nerves or mishaps.

Creating a first 
impression
Connecting with  
the audience
Appearance alone won’t win over your 
audience, but it plays an important 
role in setting out your intent and 
credibility. When choosing what to 
wear, consider which outfit will have 
the greatest influence on the people 
you would like to impress the most. 
For example, if the audience 
consists mostly of your casually 
dressed peers, but also includes two 
suited directors, dress up not down. 
And if you are the manager of a 
factory addressing the factory floor, 
think how differently your message 
will be perceived if you are wearing  
a suit or clean corporate coveralls.
The first thing your audience will notice is how you look, and this first 
impression is hard to change. Give plenty of thought to the message you 
want to send through your attire, grooming, and posture. Study yourself 
in a mirror, and ask colleagues for their opinion on your appearance.
LOOK SHARP
Change into a fresh, pressed 
outfit just before you begin 
your presentation; check 
beforehand that changing 
facilities are available.

CREATING A FIRST IMPRESSION    /    337
Dressing to impress
There are no fixed rules about dress and 
appearance, but if unsure, veer toward 
neat, professional, and conservative 
rather than trying to reassure your 
audience by “blending in” with their  
style. You are dressing to create an air of 
authority and confidence rather than to 
please yourself, so steer clear of casual 
clothes like jeans and sneakers, leather, 
shiny fabrics, and anything with 
prominent emblems or designer labels. 
Avoid distracting blocks of bright color, 
though color can be used to provide an 
accent. Make sure your shoes are clean, 
polished, but comfortable—if it is painful 
to stand in them for the length of the 
presentation, change them.
Minimize jewelry—you don’t want your 
accessories to be the most memorable 
part of your presentation—and always 
pay attention to details, even if you won’t 
get that close to the audience. You can 
bet that they’ll notice if your clothes  
are wrinkled or your cuffs are frayed. 
Remove bulging keys, change, and other 
loose items from all your pockets, and 
check that your lapels are free from  
any name tags. 
Whatever your dress, always take the 
time to groom yourself—your audience 
will not forgive an unkempt appearance 
or poor personal hygiene.
KEEP IT REAL
It is important to feel at ease 
while presenting. While you 
shouldn’t forsake style for 
comfort, avoid wearing 
clothes so formal that they 
make you feel self-conscious 
and false.

Looking confident
Growing self-belief
Inner confidence comes from a 
combination of self-belief and real 
enthusiasm for your message. When  
you are confident, you behave naturally,  
and in the full expectation of a positive 
outcome; your self-assurance is genuine 
and the audience buys into your message.
You can build your confidence over 
time through exercises in which you 
visualize success and, of course, through 
experience. Looking confident and 
feeling confident may seem two very 
different things to you, but to your 
audience, they are one and the same. 
Employing techniques that make you 
appear more confident will bring positive 
feedback from your audience, which  
will boost inner confidence.
The audience is on your side—they want you to succeed; they want  
to learn and be inspired by you. But to win their attention and trust,  
and to exert your influence, you need to impose your presence and 
demonstrate confidence in yourself and in your presentation material.  
ACCENTUATE THE 
POSITIVE
Refrain from crossing your 
arms or leaning backward, 
away from the audience; 
these actions send out very 
strong negative signals. 
Tip

LOOKING CONFIDENT    /    339
Establishing your presence
You can win the attention and respect of 
an audience before you begin simply 
through your posture, and by the way you 
occupy the space around you. Even if  
you cannot rearrange the seating in the 
room, you should become familiar with 
the room, your position, and the lines of 
sight—“owning” the space will make you 
feel more comfortable and confident. 
Give yourself room to move, and make 
sure the audience can see your hands; 
don’t trap yourself behind a desk or use 
the lectern as a shield—the audience 
may interpret your position as defensive.
USE PROPS
If nerves deter you from 
using your body, hold a 
prop—such as a pen or 
wireless remote—in one 
hand until you find your 
comfort level and confidence.

Using body language
If your content is irrelevant or your 
delivery dull, you shouldn’t be surprised 
if your audience switches off. But they 
will also disengage if the nonverbal 
messages that you send out are

SPRING-CLEAN YOUR 
BAD HABITS 
Rid your performance of any 
visible signs of discomfort 
you may be feeling. Avoid 
nervous mannerisms such as 
putting your hands stiffly 
behind your back, looking 
down at the floor, playing with 
jewelry or hair or fiddling 
with your sleeves or buttons.
Tip
THE 7-38-55 RULE
According to a study by Dr. 
Albert Mehrabian of the 
University of California, how 
much we like someone when 
we first meet them depends 
only 7 percent on what they 
say. Tone of voice accounts 
for 38 percent. The remaining 
55 percent is body language 
and facial expression. This is 
known as the 7-38-55 rule.
In focus
inconsistent with your words. Your 
stance, gestures, and eye contact must 
support what you say; in the event of any 
conflicting information, the audience will 
tend to believe what your body language 
appears to be saying. 
Start your presentation with a neutral 
but authoritative posture. Maintain a 
balanced stance, with your feet slightly 
apart and your weight spread evenly 
between them. Keep upright, facing  
the front, with shoulders straight, not 
hunched, and your arms loosely and 
comfortably at your sides. Don’t lean on  
a chair or perch on furniture for support.
Timing your movement
For the first 30 seconds of your 
presentation, try not to move your feet. 
This “anchoring” will help establish your 
authority with your audience. As you build 
rapport, you can relax your posture—this 
will help win you trust and make the 
audience feel much more comfortable—
leaning forward sends a positive and 
friendly message.

342    /    TAKING CENTER STAGE
Using gestures
Use gestures to reinforce points, just as 
you would in casual conversation; you 
may need to “amplify” small movements 
to take into account the scale of a room: 
for example, a hand gesture may need  
to become a movement of the whole 
forearm if it is to be seen from the back. 
You may need to practice to make such 
gestures appear “natural.” Avoid at all 
costs any intimidating gestures, such  
as pointing fingers at your audience or 
forcefully banging your hand or fist on 
the table or lectern.  
Making eye contact
Many presenters deliberately avoid 
making eye contact with the audience. 
But if you can keep your nerve, engaging 
with the audience in this way creates 
trust and intimacy, and is one of the most 
effective means of keeping attention, 
especially throughout a longer 
presentation. 
95%
You may need to “amplify” 
small movements to take 
into account the scale  
of a room  
of an audience thought the 
style of a talk was equally 
important as the content
Your movements need not be too 
theatrical—your goal is to hold the 
attention of the audience rather 
than to entertain them. 
Coordinate your movements to 
emphasize an important point—for 
example, walk across the room, and 
turn quickly to coincide with the 
conclusion of a point.
Move to a different spot on the stage 
area when moving from point to 
point—this can help the audience to 
separate out your key messages. 
When you want to refer the audience 
to a projected slide, step back 
toward it, and sweep your arm to 
guide the viewer’s eyes up toward 
the slide: be careful not to turn your 
back on your audience as you move.
Moving for effect
Human attention is drawn to 
movement—it is programmed into our 
genes—so one of the most powerful 
ways to hold on to your audience, and to 
make viewers focus on you, is to move. 
Always use movement purposefully 
and intentionally—if you merely walk 
back and forth it will be interpreted as 
nervous pacing and will distract the 
audience. However, using movement in 
tandem with words will boost impact. 
Listed below are a few examples where 
actions will reinforce the message: 

LOOKING CONFIDENT    /    343
Keeping a connection
Unless you are presenting to a very large 
group, attempt to make eye contact with 
every member of the audience at least 
once. Maintain contact for no more than 
three seconds—longer contact may be 
seen as hostile. If you find this unnerving, 
start by making eye contact with 
someone who looks friendly and 
approachable before moving around the 
rest of the room.
Remember also to target people at 
the back and sides, or those who appear 
less enthusiastic. If you remain too 
nervous, look between two heads or scan 
the room—never avert your eyes from 
the audience. Not only will you lose their 
trust, but your voice may become 
muffled and indistinct, too.

Holding the audience
Keeping interest
You have prepared an interesting 
presentation. You are delivering it with 
conviction using a good range of visual 
materials and rhetorical devices. Yet 
when you look out, you don’t get the 
reassurance of attentive expressions  
on the faces of the audience; you may 
even detect signs of distraction.
Perhaps your audience is tired, or your 
presentation is the last in a grueling  
day, or maybe you are delivering some 
difficult material. In any case, you need 
to take action fast: 
•  Ask the audience if they can hear  
and understand your words and if  
they are comfortable. Take remedial 
steps if necessary. 
Novelty and expectation will keep your audience focused through the 
early parts of your presentation. But keeping their attention once they  
are accustomed to the sound of your voice and your presentation style 
can be more of a challenge. Look for signs of disengagement, and  
be prepared to act quickly to bring the audience back on track.

Calming nerves
Channeling your energy
Before your presentation, you will be 
brimming with  nervous energy. Start by 
giving that energy a release: vent any 
concerns to a trusted colleague, then go 
for a walk, or do some gentle stretching 
and warm-up exercises. Your body’s 
physical response to stress tends to 
work against your mental preparations. 
Take the following preventative action 
before you begin your presentation: 
•  Take several deep breaths, holding 
each for a count of four, then slowly 
release through your mouth. This  
will help moderate a quickening  
pulse and heartbeat.
•  Don’t take your position too  
early. Keep your body moving  
in the moments just before  
your presentation. 
•  Shrug your shoulders to help  
ease tension.
•  Give your voice a warm-up by 
humming; stretch and release  
your facial muscles.  
Public speaking ranks at the top of many people’s list of worst fears.  
Be assured that this fear is understandable and normal—and even  
highly experienced presenters sometimes feel some anxiety. Rather  
than fighting your fear, try to harness it so it works for you; as ever,  
this requires preparation, practice, and persistence.
CONTROL THE 
SYMPTOMS  
There are many symptoms of 
nerves: feeling “butterflies” 
in your stomach is common, 
as is dryness of the mouth; 
twitching eyes; fidgeting or 
playing with your hair or a 
pen; and rocking from side to 
side.  Work on controlling the 
external signs so they are 
not visible to your audience.
Tip
RITUALS AND 
CONFIDENCE
Repeating the same sequence 
of actions and thoughts before 
each presentation is a helpful 
tool in preventing nerves. 
Rituals are used by people to 
combat much stronger 
fears—such as agoraphobia 
and fear of flying—because 
they set up a safe zone of 
familiarity. Your ritual can be 
anything from cleaning your 
glasses to arranging your 
papers geometrically on the 
desk—just make sure that it is 
a sequence of simple, 
undemanding tasks that won’t 
cause stress themselves. 
In focus

CALMING NERVES    /    347
Imagine yourself taking 
the stage confidently and 
speaking well. See 
yourself enjoying  
the moment.
Letting yourself shine
Once you begin the presentation, control the 
release of energy. Don’t dissipate it too early by 
pacing around or rushing your delivery. Maintain 
eye contact with individuals in the audience; this 
will help your nerves because it gives you a mental 
focus, and you will probably get positive feedback 
from your audience (smiles and nodding heads) 
that will boost your confidence. Behavioral 
research has found visualizing a stressful event  
is enough to trigger a real physical reaction. 
Conversely, we can all achieve a calmer state 
through positive images. So, before your next 
presentation, try visualizing your own success.
Remember how you feel at 
your most confident. Tell 
yourself you can and  
will succeed.
Tell yourself you don’t 
need to be perfect;  
the audience is on 
your side.
Picture yourself as

you look more confident 
than you feel.
Tell yourself you are 
well prepared.

How to visualize success

348    /    TAKING CENTER STAGE
Speaking powerfully
Using confident vocals
As you speak, your audience “reads” your voice— 
its nuances of pitch, volume, pace, and so on. This 
process happens imperceptibly, below the radar  
of consciousness, yet it shapes your audience’s 
perceptions of your message. Sound hesitant and 
your audience will question your content. Sound 
confident and your audience will side with you. Try 
using the various facets of your voice (see right) 
when you practice your presentation and use them 
to effect.
Remaining calm
Slow and deep breathing enhances your 
performance. It boosts the supply of oxygen to your 
brain, making you more alert; it helps you stay calm; 
and it increases the flow of air over your vocal cords, 
enhancing the clarity of your voice. To keep from 
stumbling during your presentation, declutter your 
speech by removing unnecessary words and any 
trite expressions. 
Finally, learn to be comfortable with silence  
in front of an audience: it feels odd at first, but 
remember that “dramatic pauses” after key points 
add memorable emphasis.
How do you sound? In control? Authoritative? Dynamic? Voice is a 
powerful tool in the presentation arsenal. Don’t worry—you don’t  
need to have the booming resonance of a stage actor to convince  
your audience that you are fully involved in what you are saying. 
TONE
Whether presenting 
good or bad information, 
do so with a tone that 
matches the content of 
what you are saying.
INTONATION
Using an upward 
inflection (upspeak) at 
the end of sentences 
may signal you are 
uncertain. Using 
declarative sentences 
with the voice ending in 
a downbeat will give 
even neutral phrases 
an authoritative touch.
PACE
Vary the pace of your delivery. This 
helps keep your audience alert. Speak 
slowly when delivering key messages: 
new ideas need time to be processed.

SPEAKING POWERFULLY    /    349
PROTECT YOUR VOICE
Don’t drink milk or milk 
products before speaking—
they will coat your mouth. 
Rest your voicebox (larynx) 
for at least a day before your 
presentation, and take 
regular sips of water  
while speaking.
Tip
PITCH
Slow your delivery and breathe 
deeply. Only then will you be 
able to use the full range of 
highs and lows of your voice. A 
confident speaker varies pitch 
more than a rushed one, whose 
pitch is flat and unengaging. 
VOLUME
Be comfortable projecting 
your voice so that it can be 
heard everywhere in the 
room. Vary your projection  
to grab and keep attention. 
Your goal is not only to be 
heard, but also to alert 
listeners to the importance 
of what you are saying.
DICTION
Enunciate words clearly, adjusting the 
pace of your delivery where needed. Be 
careful with acronyms or unusual words 
your audience might misunderstand. 
Repeat important numbers for emphasis 
and to be certain they are heard.

Succeeding with formal 
speeches
Crafting your content
Delivering a formal speech at an official 
or ceremonial occasion requires a 
particular method of preparation. 
Formal speeches may be read verbatim 
from a script, delivered from detailed 
cards, or delivered extemporaneously 
based on careful preparation. However, 
they lack important features of other 
presentations: visual aids are rarely 
used, and the speaker is physically 
separated from the audience, limiting  
the degree of interaction. 
As with other presentations, consider 
who will be in the audience and what they 
need, as well as the messages you want 
the audience to receive. 
Speaking naturally
Match your delivery to the nature of the 
occasion; evening receptions, for 
example, are not the time for complex 
content—the audience is more inclined to 
be entertained. Without visual aids, 
handouts, or interactivity, your words 
must carry the full weight of your 
message. Keep your sentences short and 
confine yourself to one point per sentence. 
Emulate the natural rhythms of speech 
in your script, keeping your sentences 
flowing naturally. Although the occasion 
may be formal, don’t use “sophisticated” 
vocabulary solely to try to impress  
your audience. Instead, use everyday 
language in a concise and accurate way. 
Formal speeches such as keynote addresses, appearances at award 
ceremonies, and addresses to trade conferences and plenary sessions 
follow structured formats and are often delivered in large group 
settings. Look on them less as a chance to inform—more to entertain 
your audience while enhancing your own reputation.
KEEP DOWN  
THE DETAIL
There is a limit to the level  
of detail people can absorb 
while listening as opposed  
to reading. Test your speech 
on someone who hasn’t  
heard it and check that  
they understand.

Adapting your delivery style
Even though you will probably be reading 
your speech, look for different ways in 
which you can show personality and 
commitment to your message. Use hand 
gestures as you would naturally when 
you speak, to emphasize your points. A 
simple device such as this will help to 
keep things interesting for your audience. 
Don’t feel you have to read each word  
or phrase exactly as written. You should 
feel free to depart from your speech as 
required; this will give your delivery a 
much more spontaneous feel. Aim for  
a style of delivery that does not call 
attention to itself, but that conveys your 
ideas clearly and precisely without 
distracting the audience. 
 Break up your 
sentences more 
than usual so you 
can deliver them 
more easily.
Write delivery 
reminders to 
yourself on your 
script—for 
example, highlight 
words you want  
to emphasize or 
write in “pause”  
to remind yourself 
of pacing.
 Err on the side  
of brevity.
 Practice your 
speech until  
it becomes

Using teleprompters
Text-display devices such as hidden 
screens and teleprompters can avoid  
the need for a podium. They allow you  
to appear more fully engaged with your 
audience by looking in their general 
direction as you read and delivering  
your text more naturally. 
However, it takes practice to use 
these devices well. You need to be 
sufficiently at ease with them, so they 
aren’t a distraction, either to you or  
your audience. 
Follow these simple steps in order to ensure a smooth, 
professional performance:
>
>  Teleprompters do vary. Rehearse with the actual  
device you will be using.
>
>  As with every visual aid, make sure you are in control.  
Be sure to set your own pace of delivery.
>
>  If your script is hard to read in this format, rewrite it. 
Adjustments now will pay off later.
>
>  Build in and script pauses to sound natural.
>
>  Read ahead in phrases to look more natural.
>
>  Deliberately increase your blink rate in order  
to prevent “teleprompter stare.”

USING A PODIUM
Do’s
Don’ts
Speaking from podiums
Speaker podiums give the presenter a 
place to stand, room to place a hard  
copy of the speech, and, sometimes, 
a stationary microphone. However, 
podiums can also pose problems. While 
they do provide some comfort, they may 
also create a physical barrier between 
speaker and audience that is a challenge 
to overcome. Even transparent podiums, 
designed to mitigate this problem, still 
force the speaker into a small, tightly 
constrained space, making it difficult for 
the audience to gauge their commitment 
and belief in what is being said.
Working the room
To counteract the constraints of a 
podium, exaggerate your gestures so you 
can be seen clearly. Use a handheld or 
lapel microphone to avoid obstructing

MAKE IT READABLE

large, clear font on single-
sided pages. Mark your script 
for points of emphasis, but 
make sure you can easily 
read any handwritten edits  
or notes.
Tip
the audience’s view of your face. Plan 
moments where you can move toward 
the audience, however briefly, to address 
a point—question and answer sessions 
following the speech can offer this 
opportunity. Freedom of movement will 
signal your willingness to engage with 
your audience. 
If you are stuck behind the podium, 
keep in mind that you must still find ways 
to connect with the audience. Make eye 
contact at points around the entire 
audience, and find a natural delivery that 
lets people know that the words and 
thoughts you are speaking are in fact 
your own.

Running the Q&A
Making time for questions
Always allow time in every presentation 
for questions and answers or some other 
form of audience feedback. If your format 
doesn’t allow for a session following  
your presentation, consider addressing 
questions as they come up. 
Audiences often look forward to the 
question and answer session more than 
to the presentation itself. It is at this time 
that their needs move to center stage—
they can engage with you directly and 
test the strength with which you hold 
your ideas. You should welcome the  
Q&A because the questions will indicate 
if you have been effective, and if you  
have addressed what the audience really 
wants to know. Consider the Q&A as 
feedback—a way of strengthening your 
presentation content and delivery. 
The question and answer part of your presentation is a great  
opportunity to drive home your key points and cement the bonds you 
have established with your audience. Q&A sessions keep an audience 
engaged and provide you with an invaluable insight into how they have 
received and understood your communication.
MAINTAIN OPENNESS 
Stay away from defensive 
language—phrases such  
as “You misunderstand  
my point”—and seek to be 
empathetic: “I can certainly 
understand your objections.”
Tip

RUNNING THE Q&A    /    357
Staying in control
Clearly signal the start of the Q&A 
session not only with your words  
but through body language; an open 
posture indicates you are ready for 
questions. Stay in control of the session 
at all times by directing the format and 
focus of the questions. Although this  
part of the presentation is unscripted, 
there are techniques to help keep the 
session focused:  
•  Keep questioners on track: if they 
begin to wander off the point, you 
could say, for example, “We’re 
running short of time and I want  
to make sure we return to the 
immediate issue at hand.”
•  Don’t allow audience members to 
engage in their own separate debates, 
or to interrupt one another. Step in 
and direct the process with a quick 
assertion of control: “Susan, I’d like  
to hear your question, then we will 
turn to the issue Brian is raising.” 
•  Seek to find common themes,  
or larger points that will get the 
discussion back to a message:  
“These are good points that deal  
with different ways to reach the  
goal we’ve been talking about.”
•  Don’t dismiss questions even if  
it is clear that someone missed  
a key element of your presentation. 
Graciously repeat a quick summary 
for the questioner without making 
them feel awkward. 
USE TOUCHSTONES 
Keep repeating key words and 
phrases—or touchstones— 
in your answers. This will 
emphasize crucial points  
and help audience retention.
GOOD QUESTION!
Don’t overuse the response: 
“That’s a good question!” or  
it will lose its meaning with 
your audience.
Tip
Tip
WRAPPING UP
Signal in advance your intention to close off questions, with a statement 
such as, “We have time for two more questions and then I’ll wrap this up.” 
Don’t just end abruptly after the last question is answered. Instead, take a 
moment to summarize your key points and offer your audience next steps 
or actions they can take. Be succinct in this final closing, and restate 
without repeating what has come before. Remember to leave on an upbeat 
and positive note, and thank people for their time and their attention.

Answering tough questions
Anticipating situations
IIt is always easier to appear confident 
when you have done your research, so be  
prepared for your Q&A session. Although 
it is unscripted, you should be able to 
anticipate the questions you are most 
likely to be asked, and those you hope  
not to be asked. Be ready with suitable 
answers to both types, but also prepare 
to be surprised by unconventional 
questions. No one expects you to have all 
of the answers all of the time, so don’t be 
afraid to say, “I don’t know.”  
Maintaining poise
The key to handling difficult questions  
is keeping your poise. Maintain a calm 
demeanor, even if the questioner does 
not. Avoid signaling any discomfort 
through body language—stepping back 
from the audience or breaking eye 
contact, for example. If you have been 
standing up for the duration of the 
presentation, remain standing for  
the Q&A session.
Answering calmly
Keep a level tone, even if your answer  
is a candid “I don’t know.” If caught off 
guard by a question, buy some time; ask 
for the question to be repeated, or say 
that you will return to the question later. 
Even if your audience perceives the 
question as hostile or unfair, they will 
still want to see how you handle the 
response. Try not to take statements or 
questions personally, and address the 
answer to the entire audience while 
responding. Avoid being provoked  
and remember, you are in charge  
of your presentation.
Even the best-prepared presenter will come up against hard  
questions, or difficult questioners. How you deal with these challenges 
can win or lose you the presentation, as the audience waits to see  
just how confidently and competently you can defend your position.  
In many cases, just staying calm and remaining in control under 
pressure is more important than having all the answers. 
REPEAT THE QUESTION 
In larger rooms, when 
wearing a microphone, 
repeat or summarize each 
question for the benefit of 
others in the audience before 
offering an answer.

Dealing with the media
Understanding your role
Dealing effectively with independent 
media means recognizing the nature of 
the relationship that you are about to 
enter into. When you are interviewed, 
your role is not just to answer questions 
passively, it is to shape the agenda so 
that you can present your key messages 
succinctly and effectively. While you can’t 
control the questions asked or the 
context, you do have control over access 
and over what you say. Maintaining a 
balance of control in interviews is a 
matter of delivering your messages well, 
through preparation and practice.
Investing in training
Having expertise on a subject doesn’t 
mean you are media-ready. In fact, being 
close to a topic often makes it difficult to 
speak in the broad and brief terms media 
interviews demand. Given that every 
media interview can impact on your 
organization’s image and reputation, it is 
worth thinking about investing in training 
for all managers who are likely to come 
into contact with the media. Media 
training often provides managers with 
the best possible means to prepare for 
interviews. Training also helps managers 
to shape a story through their careful 
responses to the reporter’s questions, 
and to meet the organization’s 
requirements and the demands of 
reporters at the same time.
Media attention carries more credibility with audiences than advertising 
because it is perceived as being less partial and not paid for. It can help 
your organization to advance ideas or products, and build awareness 
and credibility with a targeted audience. However, not understanding 
media priorities can have severe negative consequences, even for 
smart businesses.
Shape the agenda so 
that you can present your 
key messages succinctly

Talking to reporters
Preparing for the interview
Reporters are always under pressure to 
produce their stories. You will need to 
respect their deadlines while allowing 
yourself time to prepare thoroughly for 
an interview. Before the interview takes 
place, ask the reporter for the following 
information: 
•  What was it that captured their 
interest?
•  What do they think that you can add to 
the story?
•  What approach is being used—do they 
want a personal story, or a balancing 
opinion? 
•  What other sources will they be 
using—what can you uniquely add?
•  Who is their primary audience?  
Keeping it in context
Speaking to reporters under such 
circumstances—especially about 
controversial or news-based subjects—
makes many people worry that they will 
be taken out of context. You can reduce 
the likelihood of this happening by 
planning ahead: 
•  Work your messages into a short, 
memorable form—sound bites for 
broadcast and quotes for print media. 
These are what you want the reporter 
to take away with them.
•  Formulate “bridges”—ways of moving 
between an answer to an anticipated 
question and a sound bite that you 
have prepared.
•  Seize the initiative by talking to the 
reporter about the subject, even 
before the questions begin. This is 
your opportunity to influence the 
direction of the interview. 
Anyone in business is a potential interview subject for a reporter 
searching for an expert opinion. Whether it is TV, radio, or print media, 
that opportunity, provided you get it right, can win you a wider platform 
to gain attention for a product or service, or to raise your own profile.
FORM CONNECTIONS  
Let the reporter know if 
there are others you are 
aware of who can provide 
information or points of view 
that can aid in understanding. 
Help the reporter get in touch 
with those resources.
MAKE INDEPENDENT 
STATEMENTS
Make sure everything you say 
to a reporter can “stand 
alone”; that is, make sure 
your statements are not 
entirely dependent on a 
specific context to be 
understood correctly.

Getting your message across
A standard line of questioning for reporters 
concerns the “worst case scenario.” 
Reporters who are seeking interesting 
comments are prone to press subjects to 
speculate on what might happen in a given 
case that the public might need to know. 
However, speculation—no matter how 
carefully phrased—is likely to create 
problems if you are quoted out of context. 
Replace speculation with an interesting 
comment about what you do know. You will be 
in a good position to do that if you understand 
what the reporter wants and develop your own 
well crafted messages to provide it.

Becoming a negotiator
Seeing the benefits
When you become skilled in negotiation, 
you can be of real value to your 
organization. Negotiation allows you,  
for example, to secure cost-effective  
and reliable flows of supplies, enhance 
the financial value of mergers and 
acquisitions, settle potentially damaging 
disputes with government officials or 
union leaders, and resolve internal conflict 
constructively. Negotiation is increasingly 
recognized as a core competency. Many 
companies develop their own approaches 
and methodologies, and offer training and 
mentoring programs for negotiators.  
Many people shy away from negotiation because they think it implies 
conflict. In fact, negotiation is what you make it. When undertaken with 
confidence and understanding, negotiation is a creative interpersonal 
process in which two parties collaborate to achieve superior results.
LEARN YOUR ART 
Developing the skills needed to be a 
successful negotiator can take time, 
so be patient. Try to learn from every 
negotiation you undertake, both for your 
organization and in your life outside work.

Understanding the basics
Good negotiators are made rather than 
born.  Although some may be naturally 
gifted and intuitive (possessing, for 
example, the ability to empathize with 
others), most have developed their 
principles and tactics over time and 
recognize that negotiating is a largely 
rational process.
To be a successful negotiator, you 
have to feel psychologically comfortable 
in the negotiation situation. This means 
being able to tolerate uncertainty,  
deal with unexpected behavior, take 
measured risks, and make decisions 
based on incomplete information.  
You need to think about solving  
problems and creating opportunities 
rather than winning or losing: if you  
are confrontational, you are likely to  
have a fight on your hands. And if you 
“win” there will necessarily be a loser, 
with whom you may have to work in  
the months to come.

Understanding negotiation 
dilemmas
Identifying true dilemmas
Over time, a number of myths have 
evolved about the nature of negotiations. 
Many negotiators continue to hold to  
them, failing to recognize the difference 
between these myths and the real 
dilemmas they face. For example, it is a 
popular misconception that a negotiator 
must either be consistently “tough”  
or consistently “soft” if they are to be 
successful. In reality, effective negotiators 
do not need to choose between these 
approaches, but are flexible and use  
a repertoire of styles.
Using processes 
Some believe that negotiation is largely an 
intuitive act, rather than a rational process. 
Many effective negotiators will use their 
intuition to a certain extent (to know the 
right moment to make a concession or 
present an offer, for example). However, 
most of the negotiating task requires 
systematic processes such as masterful 
due diligence, identifying interests, and 
setting clear objectives.
 
Skilled negotiators are able to recognize 
the myths and focus their energy on the 
true negotiation dilemmas, balancing  
their approach and making the difficult 
decisions needed to achieve the most 
successful outcomes in their negotiations.
The negotiating task is very complex because it embodies a number  
of fundamental dilemmas. To be successful in your negotiations, you  
need to understand the difference between the true dilemmas that  
you need to address, and the many myths that surround negotiating.
The five negotiation 
dilemmas
THE STRATEGY OR 
OPPORTUNITY DILEMMA 
Unexpected opportunities 
sometimes arise in negotiation.

UNDERSTANDING NEGOTIATION DILEMMAS    /    371
THE HONESTY DILEMMA
How much should you tell the 
other party? If you tell them 
everything, they may exploit the 
information and take advantage  
of you, so you need to strike  
a balance between honesty  
and transparency.
THE COMPETE OR 
COOPERATE DILEMMA 
You must compete for the benefits 
on the table, but also cooperate to 
create them with the other party. 
You therefore need to be skilled at 
both, to be able to create and then 
claim value.
THE EMPATHY DILEMMA
If you develop empathy with the 
other party, it may stop you from 
acting assertively and negotiating 
for your interests. Try to do both 
well—maintain good relationships, 
but protect your interests too.
THE TRUST DILEMMA 
Trust is needed for a negotiation to 
move forward, but if you trust the 
other party completely, you put 
yourself at risk of being taken 
advantage of. Invest in building 
trust, albeit with measured caution.

and focus on the 
true negotiation 
dilemmas 

372    /    PREPARING TO NEGOTIATE
Being prepared
Setting the limits
You should always go to the negotiating 
table with clear answers to the following 
questions: why do you want to negotiate 
the deal? How will this deal create value 
for you? What are your “deal breakers”? 
What must you have from the deal, what 
would you like, and what are you willing 
to give away? There may be alternative 
outcomes that you would be willing to 
accept—what are they?
Knowing your objectives
Set your objectives high but not 
outrageously so. It is tempting to censor 
your aspirations, setting them too low to 
protect yourself from the prospect of 
failure, but in doing so, you will almost 
certainly achieve less than was possible. 
If you fail to set clear objectives, there is 
also a danger that you could get trapped 
in an “escalation of commitment”—an 
irrational urge to “win” the negotiation at 
any cost.  
Escalation of commitment is a real 
hazard in negotiation, and happens when 
you refuse to give up your pursuit of a 
negative course of action when the wiser 
choice would be to cut your losses and 
move on. Always set a limit for how far 
you are prepared to go and prepare an 
exit strategy (a means of walking away 
from the deal). 
Your success in a negotiation depends largely on the quality of your 
preparation. Start by thinking through your position and your objectives.  
Having clear goals will protect you from making too many concessions 
and motivate you to perform better. Objectives should be specific, 
quantifiable, and measurable. Only then can they be used as valuable 
benchmarks to measure your progress during the negotiation process.
DO THE RESEARCH 
Information is power. Find  
out as much as you can about 
your counterpart before you 
sit down to negotiate.  
VALUE THE ISSUES 
Draw up a list of potential 
negotiating points, starting 
with the most critical.  
Give each issue a value,  
and estimate the value that 
your counterpart is likely  
to place on it.

Looking across the table
A negotiator was once asked if he  
could formulate a proposal that took  
into consideration both his and his 
counterpart’s interests. He was puzzled. 
“Why should I care about the other 
party’s interests?” he asked. “His 
interests are his problem.” Such an 
attitude of blinkered self-interest 
characterizes the unprepared negotiator. 
In order to succeed, you not only need to 
understand yourself and your interests, 
but also the other negotiating party, and 
the situation as a whole. Ask yourself the 
questions listed above when preparing 
for a negotiation. 
AVOIDING ESCALATION OF COMMITMENT
It can be easy to fall into the trap of competing with the other party at all 
costs, to ensure that you get that “win.” For example, in the late 1980s, 
Robert Campeau, a Canadian businessman, made a hostile bid to acquire 
Federated Department Stores (FDS). Macy’s, a competitor of FDS, was  
also interested and a bidding war began between Campeau and Macy’s. 
Determined to win, Campeau kept increasing his already high bids to a 
point where he offered to pay an additional US$500 million. Campeau  
won the competition, but two years later he declared bankruptcy. This is a 
classic case of escalation of commitment, and a lesson for all negotiators 
in keeping a sense of perspective in their negotiations.

Preliminary research

374    /    PREPARING TO NEGOTIATE
Understanding your 
counterpart
It is important to understand the issues 
and interests of the other party before 
you start the negotiations. Negotiators 
come to the table because they each need 
something from one another, so you must 
identify your counterpart’s key issues and 
interests. How important is each one? 
Which are the deal breakers and which 
may they be willing to concede? 
Try to assess whether it is you or your 
counterpart who holds the power. What 
are your counterpart’s strengths and 
weaknesses? What is their level of 
information and expertise? How badly do 
they want to make a deal with you? Do 
they have other attractive options? Are 
they pressed for time? If you know that 
the other side has a tight deadline that 
you are able to meet, you may be able to 
negotiate a better price. Similarly, if you 
know that your counterpart has recently 
expanded production capacity, you may 
be able to gain better terms for larger 
volumes of orders. 
Can your counterpart walk away from 
the table and exercise a Best Alternative 
To a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA)? 
This term is used by negotiators to 
describe the course of action taken  
if negotiations break down.
Thinking strategically
Much of what occurs in the negotiating 
room is, in fact, determined by what 
happens outside the negotiating room. 
This requires you to think strategically 
about your situation in relation to the 
situation of your negotiating counterpart. 
For example, in some negotiations, you 
and the other party may be representing 
others. Make sure you are very clear 
about the identity of your constituency, 
and that of your counterpart. What are 
their expectations for the negotiators and 
can you influence them? 
If there are several negotiating 
parties, analyze all of them and begin  
to think in terms of coalitions. With 
whom and how can you build a winning 
coalition and how can you block a 
threatening coalition? 
CONSIDER THE 
TIMESCALE 
Shape your negotiating 
strategy with respect to the 
timescale. You can be more 
blunt in a short, one-time 
negotiation than in a long 
negotiation that is part of  
an ongoing relationship.
Tip

BEING PREPARED    /    375
Tailoring your strategy
Make sure that your negotiating strategy and behavior 
reflects the other party’s situation and approach. For 
example, in many negotiations, the other party is free to 
leave or join the negotiating table as they wish. In some 
cases, however, the parties are bonded together over the 
long term and cannot simply walk away, and your strategy 
should reflect this. 
Some negotiators prefer to negotiate away from the 
public eye, while others insist on keeping all stakeholders 
and the public informed. Consider which mode is more 
advantageous to you, taking into account the sensitivity of 
the issues, the history between the parties, and the legal 
and governance systems of each party. 
Some negotiation counterparts observe formal 
protocols in negotiations, while others are freer in what can 
and cannot be said. Take particular care to do your research 
when negotiating internationally to learn the formalities 
expected of you.

Designing the structure
Structuring your approach
Every successful negotiation starts with 
a clear structure: defined roles, agreed 
rules, a set agenda, and a schedule for 
action. A framework for the negotiation 
will most likely be suggested by each of 
the participants. It is then subject to 
negotiation and joint re-creation so that 
all parties are satisfied that it reflects 
their concerns. Consult with the other 
party before you negotiate to agree on  
all procedures that you will use. If you 
cannot agree on the procedures, it may 
be better to postpone or abandon the 
negotiations altogether. 
 Basic ground rules These need to be 
agreed to with your counterpart. For 
example, is it acceptable to change 
negotiators in midstream? Are 
observers allowed? Is the meeting 
open or closed? How should people be 
addressed and how should priority of 
speech be given? What will be the 
course of action if you cannot reach an 
agreement? All parties should agree  
to listen respectfully to one another, 
attempt to understand the positions of 
others, and refrain from legal 
proceedings for the duration of the 
negotiation.
Before producing a blueprint for a building, an architect first studies the 
functionality of the structure—the purpose it will serve. When you are 
planning a negotiation, you need to think like an architect and devise a 
structure and a process that will best fit the purpose of the negotiation. 
CREATING THE RIGHT 
TEAM

carefully consider the  
size and composition of  
your team so that you  
include all necessary  
skills and represent  
all key constituents.

at least cover the elements below.  
An agreed venue Chinese 
philosopher Sun Tzu’s Art of War 
states that one should “lure the tiger 
from the mountain”—that is, make 
your counterpart leave their 
comfortable environment. Ask 
yourself how the choice of venue will 
affect you and your team. At the very 
least, ensure that you will have 
access to the necessary support 
(computers, secure phone lines, and 
the necessary advisers).
Elements of a successful framework

A clear agenda This should include 
all the substantive issues and 
interests that you and the other

the level of importance of each 
issue and decide the order in which 
issues should be discussed. Some 
negotiators prefer to start with  
easy issues, others tackle 
everything together.

378    /    PREPARING TO NEGOTIATE
Managing processes
Once you have an agreed framework in 
place, you also need to structure the 
processes that will steer the negotiation 
through its various phases. There are 
three distinct processes—the negotiation 
process, the temporal process, and the 
psychosocial process—that come 
together in any negotiation. Each 
requires a different set of skills.
The negotiation process involves 
managing all the information and

DESIGNING THE STRUCTURE    /    379
Thinking straight
The psychosocial process requires a 
sound knowledge of human behavior  
and an understanding that people will 
take on “roles” during negotiations.  
You need to be able to overcome barriers 
to rational negotiation and avoid 
psychological traps, such as the illusion 
of optimism, a sense of superiority, and 
overconfidence. Other hazards include  
a reluctance to reverse a decision that 
produces poor results or intense conflict, 
and competition between negotiators in 
the same team.
Keeping time
The temporal process involves managing 
time and the way in which the negotiation 
moves from one stage to the next by 
appropriately pacing the speed of each 
stage and synchronizing the actions of 
the negotiators. Many negotiations (and 
sales presentations) stall because the 
negotiators belabor points for too long 
and are unable or unwilling to move the 
process toward its closure phase.

OVERCONFIDENCE 
If you underestimate your 
counterpart you will neglect 
to plan well. If you already 
think you know how a 
negotiation will end, you  
may exclude new sources  
of information and overlook 
creative solutions. 
AVAILABILITY BIAS 
It is very easy to find 
information that is widely 
available. So make a  
real effort to uncover 
information that is obscure 
and not so easy to obtain.
Never underestimate the  
risks associated with poor 
preparation: when you fail to 
plan, you plan to fail. The most 
common errors in forward 
planning include: 
CONFIRMATORY BIAS 
Do not filter out important 
information because it 
does not fit with your 
existing points of view  
and beliefs. 
Playing by the rules
The purpose of processes and structures 
is not to constrain the progress of the 
negotiation, but to give you tools to 
resolve challenges or impasses. Having 
clear rules will allow you to:

UNDERESTIMATING 
RESOURCES 
In any negotiation you must be  
able to present supporting facts, 
anticipate how the other side will 
respond to your arguments, and 
prepare counterarguments. Do 
not underestimate how long it can 
take to assemble such information, 
especially if you require input from 
experts and colleagues. 
INFORMATION 
ASYMMETRY
Do you really know as 
much as you think? To be 
safe, you should assume by 
default that you know less 
than the other party. 
RELYING ON SECONDARY 
INFORMATION  
Always seek out reliable sources 
of primary information. By all 
means read industry report 
analyses, reports of management 
projections, and corporate annual 
reports, but consider that these 
reports may sometimes be 
inaccurate or biased. 

There are many approaches to negotiation. Some negotiators 
advocate a hard-line, uncompromising style. But skilled 
negotiators know that you are more likely to achieve a 
satisfactory outcome by taking the interests of the other party 
into account and trying to create win–win deals, develop mutual 
trust, and build relationships for the future.

Defining negotiation styles
Spotting different approaches
There are three styles of negotiation: 
distributive, integrative, and mixed 
motive. Negotiators that mainly use the 
distributive style view negotiations as a 
competitive sport, a zero-sum game with 
a winner and a loser. Such negotiators 
compete fiercely for the distribution of 
the outcomes (the size of the pie) and 
engage in value-claiming behavior.
 
These negotiators use competitive 
actions in an attempt to gain a win-lose 
outcome in their favor. They dismiss the 
value of building relationships and trust 
as naive, tend to make excessive 
demands and use threats to obtain 
concessions, and exaggerate the value  
of the small concessions that they make. 
They also conceal their needs, do not 
share information, do not look for 
possible creative ideas, and even  
use deceptive tactics. 
Using the integrative style 
In contrast to value-claiming negotiators, 
integrative negotiators believe that the 
size of the pie is not fixed and can be 
expanded, and that the negotiation 
process is able to produce a win–win 
solution. The integrative style of 
negotiation is designed to integrate the 
needs of all the negotiators. Negotiators 
engage in value creation behaviors.  
They invest time and energy in building 
relationships and nurturing trust, share 
information openly, and are cooperative, 
flexible, and creative.
Negotiators come to the negotiation table because they have needs  
that they believe may be fulfilled through negotiations. In order to fulfill 
these needs, negotiators use different styles and engage in a variety of 
behaviors that they trust will help them get what they want.  
Mixed-motive style
Distributive style

DEFINING NEGOTIATION STYLES    /    385
Using mixed-motive tactics
The true nature of effective negotiations 
is often mixed, requiring both cooperative 
and competitive tactics. The rationale  
for this is that, through cooperation, 
negotiators create value; they put money 
on the table. Following this, once value 
has been created and the money is on the 
table, the parties have to split it between 
themselves. In order to secure the most 
profitable split, a negotiator has to switch 
from the cooperative mode to the 
competitive mode.
TAILOR YOUR 
APPROACH   
Utilize all of the negotiation 
styles—distributive, 
integrative, and mixed 
motive—where appropriate, 
depending on with whom you 
are negotiating and what 
their negotiating style is.
Tip
RESPONSES TO DISTRIBUTIVE TACTICS
If the other party is using a distributive win–lose approach, a negotiator 
who favors the win–win style must protect their own interests. Some 
respond with the same hard tactics, meeting toughness with toughness. 
However, since the win–lose negotiation style is most likely to produce 
suboptimal outcomes, it is advisable first to try and influence the other 
party to move toward a more integrative style. Value claimants often think 
the other party is oblivious to their tactics, and so some negotiators 
inform the other party tactfully but firmly that they know what they are 
doing and that it doesn’t contribute to productive negotiations. If all 
approaches to dealing with value-claiming tactics fail, however, and if 
they do not require the deal, many negotiators will simply leave the table.

Defining interest-based 
negotiation
Focusing on interests
In interest-based negotiation, the 
negotiators come to the table with a  
clear understanding of what they want 
and why they want it, but also with an 
understanding that the other party has 
its own set of needs to fulfill. Knowing 
that both parties’ needs can be satisfied 
in multiple ways allows for the 
negotiation process to be more about 
constructive problem solving—that is, 
collaborating to find out what they can  
do together in order to achieve their 
respective interests.
Understanding reasons 
Focusing on interests concentrates on 
the “why” instead of the “what.” People 
always have a reason for wanting 
something. For example, imagine that 
you and your friend are arguing over who 
should have the last orange in the fruit 
bowl. Your friend may want the orange  
to make juice, while you may want it 
because you need the rind to make cake. 
If, rather than arguing, you talk about 
why you need the orange and uncover  
the underlying interests behind your 
respective positions, you will discover 
that one orange can satisfy both of you. 
Negotiators often make the mistake of turning the negotiation process 
into a contest of positions. Some are hard bargainers, thinking of the 
other party as an adversary; others take a soft approach, considering 
the other person as a friend and making concessions easily. Instead  
of utilizing hard or soft bargaining tools, effective negotiators  
tend to focus on the interests of both parties.
AIM FOR JOINT GAINS 
Instead of limiting the thinking 
to only one or two options, 
work jointly to creatively 
explore potential solutions.
FOCUS ON INTERESTS
Make sure that you have a 
clear understanding both of 
your own interests and those 
of the other party.
KNOW YOUR BATNA
Make sure that you have a clear 
understanding of your Best Alternative 
To a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA)—

negotiation process falls apart.

USE STANDARDS
Base your negotiation  
on precedents, laws,  
and principles, rather  
than arbitrary judgments. 
This makes the agreement 
fair and makes it easier to 
explain the rationale  
to others. 
SEE BOTH SIDES
Assess the situation from the other 
party’s perspective. This improves 
communication and helps the other 
party understand how they stand

separate from

(such as price or

exchange information with

Negotiating from the  
whole brain
Understanding your own style
Ned Herrmann, author of The Creative 
Brain, proposed that there are four 
thinking styles: the rational self, the 
safekeeping self, the feeling self, and  
the experimental self, which relate to 
dominance in different quadrants of the 
brain. Negotiating is a whole-brain task, 
requiring the ability to be diligent and 
rational (quadrant A activities), to plan 
and organize well (quadrant B activities), 
to interact well with others (a quadrant  
C trait), and to be bold and take risks (a 
quadrant D characteristic).
Improving your style
However, only four percent of the 
population is dominant in all four 
quadrants. So most negotiators have 
strengths and weaknesses in performing 
the negotiating task, and should work  
to improve their weakest areas. 
Negotiators who have limited abilities  
in the feeling self (quadrant C), for 
example, can improve by developing  
their emotional intelligence. A negotiator 
with limited abilities in the experimental 
self (quadrant D) can improve by taking 
creativity workshops.
We all think differently, and naturally bring our own “style” to the 
negotiating table. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of your 
thinking style, and tailoring your approach to take into account the style 
of your counterpart, can greatly improve your success in negotiation.

Influencing others
The whole brain model can sometimes 
help you to influence your counterpart 
negotiators. For example, if you believe 
that your counterpart’s strength is  
in the feeling self (quadrant C) and their 
weakness is in the rational self (quadrant 
A), you will be more successful if you 
connect to him or her emotionally by 
building the relationship, and not by 
trying to connect cognitively through  
long speeches or rational arguments.
A: THE RATIONAL SELF
Individuals with brain dominance 
in quadrant A tend to be logical, 
analytical, fact-oriented, and 
good with numbers.
B: THE SAFEKEEPING SELF
Individuals with brain dominance 
in quadrant B tend to be cautious, 
organized, systematic, neat, 
timely, methodical, obedient,  
and risk-averse.
C: THE FEELING SELF
Individuals with brain dominance in 
quadrant C tend to be friendly, enjoy 
human interactions, engage in open 
communication, express their 
emotions, enjoy teaching, and are 
supportive of others.
D: THE EXPERIMENTAL SELF
Individuals with brain dominance in 
quadrant D tend to think holistically 
and see the big picture. They are also 
often creative, comfortable with 
uncertainty, future-oriented, and 
willing to take risks.
The four types of 
thinking styles

390    /    SETTING YOUR STYLE
Creating win–win deals
Getting the conditions right
Effective negotiations, unlike competitive 
sports, can produce more than one 
winner. However, it takes motivation by 
both parties to find creative alternatives 
that fulfill their interests to create a 
win–win outcome. To promote win–win 
deals, effective negotiators focus on both 
the substantive issues of the deal (price, 
terms of payment, quality, and delivery 
schedule) and on formulating a social 
contract between the negotiators—the 
spirit of the deal. This involves setting 
appropriate expectations of how the deal  
will be negotiated, implemented, and 
revisited, in case future disputes arise.  
If, by contrast, negotiators believe that 
negotiations are a zero-sum game that 
must inevitably be won at the expense  
of the other party, a win–win deal is  
not possible. 
Some negotiators talk about wanting to create win–win deals, but when 
they hit major roadblocks leave the negotiating table prematurely, thus 
missing out on an opportunity to make a good deal. Effective negotiators 
utilize techniques to ensure they can create win–win deals.
To promote win–win deals, 
negotiators focus on the 
substantive issues and on 
formulating a social contract

CREATING WIN-WIN DEALS    /    391
Bundling the issues
Effective negotiators do not negotiate  
a single issue at a time because this 
implies that there is a fixed pie and only 
leads to a win–lose scenario. Instead, 
they bundle several issues together. 
Trade-offs can then be made between 
negotiators because negotiators do not 
place equal importance on every issue. 
The principle of bundling issues involves 
placing an issue that is of high value to 
you (for example, price) with another that 
you consider to be of low value (for 
example, warranty).  
When you trade-off on issues, you can 
then keep your high-value issue (price) 
and give your low-value issue (warranty) 
away to the other party. The other party, 
in return, will allow you to have your 
high-value issue, because your low-
value issue is, in fact, of a high value to 
them. If your low-value issue is also 
considered to be a low-value issue by  
the other negotiating party, then they  
will reject the trade-off. Therefore, it is 
important for you to know what the  
other party considers to be their 
high-value issues.
Capitalizing on risk
You can also capitalize on differences in 
risk tolerance. Some negotiators are 
more comfortable with high-risk 
situations than others. As a win–win and 
risk-taking negotiator, it is possible for 
you to design a deal where you assume 
more risk and receive more benefits 
while your counterpart, who is also a 
win–win negotiator but risk-averse 
(avoider), assumes a lower level of risk 
but receives fewer benefits from the deal.
SHOW THE WAY 
If you are dealing with a win–
lose negotiator who thinks 
that the idea of win–win deals 
is naive and unrealistic, show 
them how to create value and 
reach superior agreements 
by focusing on interests and 
bundling issues together.

Building relationships
Making contact
Effective negotiators know that, in the 
long run, good relationships are best 
built through face-to-face interaction 
rather than by talking on the telephone 
or corresponding via email. Where 
possible, try to create opportunities to 
socialize with the other party before the 
negotiations begin. This is not to talk 
about the negotiations and “discover 
secrets,” but rather to get to know the 
other person better and connect with 
them on a human level. The atmosphere 
of the negotiation process may be very 
different if you are not meeting your 
counterpart for the first time at the 
negotiation table. 
Making a personal connection
Today, more and more negotiators from 
the West value what Asian, Arab, and 
Latin societies recognized thousands  
of years ago—the high value of good 
relationships. Experienced negotiators 
invest in building relationships because 
good relationships “oil” the negotiation 
process and make it more efficient. For 
example, former US Secretary of State 
James Baker has stated that he has seen 
this occur time and again—that once 
negotiators have a good relationship, 
even the most difficult and conflict-
inducing issues have been resolved, 
simply because the negotiators were 
more transparent and flexible in their 
dealings with each other. 
Contract negotiators are typically task-oriented and pragmatic, tend  
to focus on negotiating specific issues, and do not invest in building 
relationships. Relationship negotiators, in contrast, invest first in 
building good relationships before negotiating on specific issues. 
Effective negotiators need to be skilled at both approaches.
Case study
BEING PREPARED
When US businessman Robert 
Johnson was looking for financial 
investment to enable him to create 
a new cable channel, Black 
Entertainment Television, he did his 
homework. Before pitching the idea 
to John C. Malone—one of the 
industry’s biggest players—he 
learned about Malone’s business 
philosophy of believing in the 
entrepreneurial spirit and of 
individuals helping themselves 
rather than relying on others.  
When they met, Johnson was  
able to connect with Malone by 
highlighting their shared business 
values. This similarity provided a 
positive start for their successful 
business negotiations.  

BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS    /    393
Interacting informally
In your interactions with the other party, 
take advantage of any opportunities to 
express your appreciation genuinely
and congratulate them for their 
achievements. Use small talk and humor 
where appropriate—taking opportunities 
to interact informally will help you build a 
relationship. Be cautious, however, and 
use “safe humor” so as not to offend the 
other party. Where possible, focus on the 
common ground between you. You may 
find that similarities are personal (you 
may share the same hobby, for example) 
or ideological, such as a similar business 
philosophy. These findings offer a solid 
start for building a long-lasting, friendly, 
and constructive business relationship.
Thinking long-term
You should also protect the “face,” or 
dignity, of others and treat them with 
respect when you are taking more  
from a deal than they are. This is 
especially helpful when you are trying  
to build long-term relationships.  
In team negotiations, it can work well  
to include socially skilled negotiators  
in your team who can take greater 
responsibility for building lasting 
relationships, while other team 
members (contract negotiators) focus 
more on the specific issues.

394    /    SETTING YOUR STYLE
Developing mutual trust
Understanding the benefits
Trust involves a willingness to take risks. 
It has to do with how vulnerable one is 
willing to make oneself to a counterpart. 
There are many benefits to having trust 
between negotiators: it promotes 
openness and transparency, and makes 
the negotiators more flexible. Negotiators 
who trust each other take each other’s 
words at face value and do not have to 
verify their statements. This reduces 
emotional stress and other transaction 
costs, and makes the negotiation process 
more efficient. Trust also means that the 
likelihood of achieving good and lasting 
agreements is also higher. 
Developing trust
Reciprocation is important for  
building trust. When negotiators offer 
information or concessions, they expect 
the other party to reciprocate. Without 
reciprocation, no further gestures  
of goodwill will be offered. With 
reciprocation, the negotiating parties  
will be able to find ways to collaborate 
and create value for both. 
It is also important to be seen to be 
fair. As fairness is a subjective matter, 
however, make sure that you understand 
the standard of fairness that your 
counterpart adheres to. Past behavior  
is often used as a predictor for future 
behavior, so try to behave consistently. 
Keeping your commitments
Building trust is difficult but losing it  
is easy, especially if you break your 
commitments. The French diplomat 
Francois de Callier, who wrote the  
first negotiation book in 1716, stated  
that a relationship that begins with 
commitments that cannot be maintained 
is doomed. Shimon Peres, the former 
President of Israel, has said that  
promises have to be kept, otherwise  
one’s reputation is at stake. Although 
people do sometimes make genuine 
mistakes and promises in good faith that 
they ultimately cannot keep, if you want  
to build trust, you need to make every 
effort to keep your commitments.
Trust is an essential component of success in all types of negotiation, 
whether business, diplomatic, or legal. Ambassador Dennis Ross, 
former US Coordinator of the Middle East, has stated that the ability of 
negotiators to develop mutual trust is the most important ingredient  
of successful negotiation, and that without it, negotiations fail. 
TREAD CAREFULLY 
Although there are many 
benefits to a trusting 
relationship, it is not always 
possible to build trust. Some 
individuals and groups are 
simply untrustworthy, so  
be cautious in your efforts  
to develop trust.

Building your reputation
One of the most important currencies 
negotiators have is their reputation. It 
may sometimes be tempting to maximize 
short-term gains by overlooking the 
long-term consequences, but 
experienced negotiators know that 
people prefer to do business with  
those that they trust, and guard their 
reputations fiercely.
In 1873, US financial 
markets were in poor 
shape and “king of steel” 
Andrew Carnegie needed 
to cash in a $50,000 
investment with J.P. 
Morgan. Expecting a 
$10,000 profit, he asked 
Morgan to send him 
$60,000. Morgan sent 
$70,000—the investment 
had made a $20,000 profit.
When Henry Hollis sold the 
Palmer House in Chicago to 
Conrad Hilton, he shook 
hands on Hilton’s first offer  
of $19,385,000. Within a week

higher. However, he never 
wavered on his first 
commitment to Hilton.

Ways to ensure that 
the pie is sliced fairly
Negotiating fairly
Ensuring fairness
There are several categories of fairness 
that contribute to creating successful 
negotiations. Distributive fairness 
relates to the distribution of outcomes 
(the splitting of the pie). Negotiators  
use three different principles of 
distributive fairness: 
•  Equality: this states that fairness is 
achieved by splitting the pie equally. 
•  Equity: this states that the outcome 
should relate to the contribution made 
by each party.
•  Needs: this states that, regardless of 
their contribution, each party should 
get what they need.
Fairness is an important characteristic in negotiations. Negotiators 
need to believe that the negotiation process and its outcomes are fair, 
otherwise they may choose to end the negotiations without coming  
to an agreement, or fail to put the agreement into action. 
CONSENSUS
Confirm that all parties  
in the negotiation are in 
complete agreement  
on the method of slicing  
the pie.
CLARITY
Be certain that the  
final decision is clear, 
without any potential 
misinterpretations.
CONSISTENCY
Make sure that you apply the 
fairness principles (equality, 
equity, or needs) in the same 
manner throughout the 
negotiation process.

NEGOTIATING FAIRLY    /    397
Creating a fairness frame
In addition, a negotiator’s level of 
satisfaction and willingness to follow 
through with an agreement are usually 
determined by their perception of the 
level of fairness of the procedure 
(procedural fairness), and also the way 
they feel they have been treated by the 
other party (interactional fairness).
Fairness is a subjective issue. When 
negotiating, if you first define what you 
consider to be fair, you can then use  
this “fairness frame” as a bargaining 
strategy in your discussions with the 
other party. Alternatively, if you state the 
importance of fairness at the beginning 
of the negotiation process, it may 
encourage the other party to be fair. 
SIMPLICITY
Ensure that all negotiating 
parties can understand and 
describe the pie-slicing 
procedures you use to 
guarantee smooth 
implementation.
JUSTIFIABILITY
Make sure that all parties  
are able to explain why  
you are slicing the pie this 
way to someone else.
SATISFACTION
Make sure that all  
parties are happy with  
the results—they are  
then more likely to  
follow through with  
the agreement.

to be fair—you can then use

The negotiation process is a strategic interplay between the 
parties on either side of the table. To be successful, you need to 
know how to build a strong position, deal with difficult situations, 
influence your counterpart, and close your deals.

Power is a central factor in determining the outcomes of the negotiation

thus engage in continuously assessing and enhancing it. It is, however, 
equally important to know how to negotiate when you do not have power.

The fewer deadlines you are 
pressed with, the more power 
you have to wait and explore 
opportunities for better deals.
The more skilled you are in the 
art of negotiation, the more 
power you have to produce 
better joint outcomes.  
Being well informed enables 
you to support your arguments 
and also to challenge the other 
party’s arguments.
The party that has more resources—financial, 
technological, or human—has more power. 
The less badly you need the 
deal, the more power you have 
not to settle for it.
The more willing you are  
to let go of your sunk costs  
(such as financial and 
emotional expenses), the 
more power you have.
RECOGNIZE YOUR

at any point, which may strengthen your 
BATNA and your negotiating position. 
Even if your position is weak overall,  
try to identify any areas of strength you 
have and use them as leverage. Even  
the most powerful party will have some 
weaknesses, so try to discover these  
and target them. 
Never make “all or nothing” deals 
from a weak position—you may miss  
out on opportunities that would have 
arisen as the value of what you are 
bringing to the table increases during  
the negotiation process. Instead, make 
deals sequentially and in small chunks, 
to ensure that the other party will be 
more likely to recognize the added value 
that you bring to the table. 
Case study
CREATING POWER
When Thomas Stemberg, the 
founder of office products retailer 
Staples, needed a new round of 
capital to expand his business, he 
went back to the venture capitalists 
who had already financed the 
company. This time, however, they 
closed ranks and demanded a 
higher equity share than Stemberg 
was willing to provide. Determined 
to break the venture capitalists’ 
cartel, Stemberg sought alternative 
sources of funding—the pension 
funds, the insurance companies, 
and high net worth individuals—
with which he could negotiate  
from a more powerful position.
Even if your position is weak 
overall, try to identify any

Making offers and 
counteroffers
Knowing when to go first
Some experts suggest that you should 
not make the first offer and should 
always allow your counterpart to go first. 
Skilled negotiators, however, question 
the conventional “never open” rule. They 
choose to tailor their approach to each 
negotiation. How should you decide 
whether to go first or second? You should 
present your offer first when you are 
confident in the thoroughness of your 
due diligence and also when you suspect 
that your counterpart is ill-informed.  
By going first, you will “anchor,” or set  
a benchmark, that will be used as a 
reference point for the counteroffer. 
If you are not fully informed, do not go 
first. Consider the other party’s first 
offer, do not respond to it, and do your 
due diligence. In some cases, two 
negotiators are equally skilled and  
well informed and neither wishes to  
go first. Such cases often require the 
involvement of a trusted third party to  
act as a neutral go-between and get  
the negotiations started. 
Before you go into a negotiation, it is vital to plan your 
opening move. Do you open negotiations and make the first 
offer or do you wait and allow the other party to go first? 
Make sure that you have an opening offer in mind, and plan 
how you will respond to your counterpart’s offers.
POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO TOUGH OPENING OFFERS
It is easy to be thrown if the other party’s opening offer is extremely low. 
Effective negotiators make sure that they are not startled by a tough first 
offer, and avoid making a quick, emotional reaction. It is vital that a low 
opening offer does not become a benchmark for the negotiation. Possible 
responses to low offers include rejecting the offer as unreasonable; 
asking the other party to revise the offer; or asking questions and probing 
the other party for justifications for the toughness of the offer.
In focus
You should present your offer 
first when you are confident 
in the thoroughness of your 
due diligence  

MAKING OFFERS AND COUNTEROFFERS    /    405
Setting your offer
Whether you present your offer first or 
second, how high should your offer be? 
Former US Secretary of State Dr. Henry 
Kissinger believes that a negotiator is 
better off starting with a high offer. Most 
negotiators, however, tend to negotiate 
first with themselves and thus restrain 
themselves from making bold offers. 
They tend to justify their modest offers  
by thinking that their counterparts would 
not go for a higher offer. Experts today 
suggest that a seller who puts forward a 
high offer may risk his or her credibility 
and offend the buyer, who may very well 
walk away without even providing a 
counteroffer. Instead of coming up with 
offers that are either too high or too 
modest, it is often better to make offers 
that are bold and daring. Bold and daring 
offers are reasonably high, tend not to be 
acceptable, but are still negotiable.
CONSIDER THE  
LONGER TERM 
If you are hoping to form a 
long-term relationship with 
the other party, do not take 
advantage if they make you  
a very low first offer. You will 
generate goodwill and 
nurture the relationship if  
you instead respond with a 
counteroffer that is higher, 
but still reasonable to you.
Tip

406    /    CONDUCTING NEGOTIATIONS
Making concessions
Conceding in small steps
Each negotiation event is unique, so 
there are no absolute rules for how  
to make concessions that apply to all 
situations. However, it is generally true 
that people like to receive good news or 
benefits in installments, rather than all 
at once. Skilled negotiators, therefore, 
tend to make multiple small concessions 
in order to increase the level of 
satisfaction of their counterparts.
Knowing what to concede
Inexperienced negotiators often  
make a first sizeable concession as  
an expression of goodwill. However,  
this can set the expectation that  
there are many concessions to be 
provided. Experienced negotiators,  
by contrast, tend to untangle the 
relationships from the concessions. 
Sometimes, in order to set the tone  
of reciprocating concessions, these 
knowledegable negotiators concede  
first by making a concession on a  
minor issue. 
Wait before you make the first 
sizeable concession. During this time, 
advocate for your initial offer and convey 
the idea that it is not that easy to make 
concessions. The second concession 
should be smaller in size than the  
first and be a longer time in coming. 
Making concessions in progressively 
declining installments will then lend 
more credibility to when you finally say: 
“There is no more to give.”   
Experienced negotiators know that successful negotiations involve a 
certain amount of give and take, and are well versed in the process of 
making concessions. They tend to develop offers that leave room for 
concessions, as these are the oil that lubricates the making of a deal.
WATCH YOUR TIMING 
Think carefully about the 
timing of your first sizable 
concession. If you make it too 
soon after your initial offer, it 
will give the other party the 
impression that the initial 
offer was not a credible one.

MAKING CONCESSIONS    /    407
ENABLING RECIPROCITY
Label the concessions you make as ones that are costly to you and then 
reduce your value. This sets up the expectation that you will receive a 
concession in return, implying value for value. 
USING CONTINGENCY 
If you suspect that your concession will not be reciprocated, offer a 
concession that is contingent upon the other party providing a concession in 
return. For example: “I will be willing to extend the terms of payment to 45 
days if you will increase your order by 500 items.” 
SETTING BOUNDARIES 
Some negotiators put the deal at risk by asking for too much. Set boundaries 
for the other party by being clear and precise about what you can concede and 
what you absolutely cannot. 
SETTING RULES 
Sometimes negotiators make final concessions but then withdraw them or 
make them contingent on receiving a new concession. Set a clear rule that a 
concession cannot be withdrawn, unless it was explicitly offered as a tentative 
or conditional concession.
SPOTTING DEAL BREAKERS 
Some concessions are deal breakers: without them, your counterpart will 
walk away from the negotiation table. Try to distinguish these from value-
enhancing concessions, which are demands that will get a better deal, but if 
not provided, would not result in the other party abandoning the negotiations.

Influencing others
Effective negotiators use a range 
of influencing techniques that 
take advantage of the natural 
responses of negotiators to 
certain types of information.  
For example, negotiators are 
generally more motivated  
to avoid losses than they are  
to obtain gains. 
A successful negotiation process requires effective persuasion.  
When attempting to influence your counterpart, it is crucial to  
identify your moments of power and take advantage of them.  
Seasoned negotiators understand how to use appropriate  
persuasion techniques to sell their ideas to the other party.

was given the advice that “if you insulate

Another group was told that “if you fail  
to insulate your home, you will lose 50 
cents a day.” More home owners under 
the second set of instructions insulated 
their homes than under the first set of 
instructions. Similarly, you are more 
likely to persuade the other party of the 
benefits of your deal if you emphasize 
what they would lose if they don’t agree, 
not what they could gain if they do.

Offering small concessions
Making small unilateral concessions can 
be a successful way to influence your 
counterpart. Negotiators feel obligated 
to reciprocate, no matter how big or 
small the concessions are. Even a small 
concession on your part can help the 
other party to comply. The more 
beneficial your concession is to the other 
side, the more likely they are to feel 
obliged to return the favor.

BEING PERSUASIVE    /    411
USE SCARCITY
It is human nature for people to want more of what they cannot have.  
When you present your offer to the other party, inform them of the unique 
benefits you are offering that they would not be able to get elsewhere.
GAIN COMMITMENT
Encourage the other party to agree to an initially modest request. They are  
then more likely to follow up with their commitment by agreeing to your 
key demand to justify their past decision to say yes to you.
GIVE A REASON
People are much more likely to agree to a demand if you have given 
legitimate justification for it. Try to give a reason that can be backed up 
with evidence, but using even a frivolous reason increases your chances of 
reaching agreement.
GIVE “SOCIAL PROOF”
People often use “social proof” when making decisions—they think that if 
many people are doing things a certain way, it must be good. Demonstrate 
how your product or service has been successfully used by others.
LET THEM SAY “NO”
Give the other party the opportunity to say “no”  by making an outrageous 
demand, before retreating immediately and putting forward a more 
reasonable demand. This can also serve to make the other party feel 
obligated to make a concession.
SET A BENCHMARK
Negotiators who are not fully informed tend to compare the cost of an item 
to a reference point or benchmark. You can influence the way they make 
their decision by setting a benchmark for them.

Managing impasses
Dealing with deadlock
Skilled and experienced negotiators expect there  
to be impasses in the negotiating process. They 
anticipate deadlocks and develop counteractions  
to deal with them when they occur. They view an 
impasse as a natural ingredient in negotiations  
and do not give up easily in their attempts to reach 
an agreement. 
Impasses usually generate negative emotions 
and sometimes deep feelings of resentment.  
Prior to and during the negotiation process, you 
should always be sensitive to the other party’s 
concerns, feelings, and, particularly, their self-
image. Research has suggested that negotiators 
have an image to uphold and that negotiations are 
less likely to be successful when either or both 
parties are not sensitive enough to each other’s 
dignity, or “face.” You should always be mindful not 
to harm the self-image of your counterpart, and this 
is never more important than during critical 
moments of an impasse. 
Negotiations do not always conclude with an agreement. You may 
encounter an impasse or a deadlock during the process. How should you  
deal with a deadlock? Should you leave the negotiation table, concluding 
that the process has failed, or should you encourage yourself and your 
counterpart to remain at the table and keep the negotiations going?

MANAGING IMPASSES    /    413
Oiling the wheels
If you are facing an impasse, experts 
suggest that, in the intensity of the 
moment, you should first take time out  
to cool down. This will help to defuse  
the emotional situation and you can 
resume the discussion at a later time.
When you reconvene, start with any 
existing mutual benefits. Impasses often 
occur after some progress has been 
made. So, it may be useful to frame  
the impasse in the context of what has 
already been achieved and highlight  
the potential losses to both parties if 
agreement is not reached.
If you are still deadlocked, you may need 
to try expanding the pie. If you maintain  
a zero-sum, fixed-pie mentality toward 
the negotiation, this will restrain your 
creativity in negotiating for the best deal. 
The purpose of negotiation is not to win 
an argument, but to find solutions that 
would maximize the benefits for both 
parties. Consider new ideas to help you 
reach agreement. Expand the issues  
you are discussing, but avoid making 
concessions. In this way, you may be able 
to overcome the impasse on one critical 
issue by adding another issue that is 
attractive to the other party.

Avoiding decision traps
Making the right decisions
Understanding the decision traps that 
negotiators can fall into will help you 
avoid making the same mistakes 
yourself, and may allow you to use the 
other party’s errors to leverage your  
own power. There are many tactics and 
strategies you can use to avoid decision 
traps or to use them to your advantage.
Most negotiators believe that they are rational. In reality, many 
negotiators systematically make errors of judgment and irrational 
choices. It is important for you to understand and try to avoid making 
these common errors, as they lead to poor decision-making. 
WATCH YOUR TIMING 
To keep from feeling that you 
have not made the best 
possible deal, never accept 
the first offer that is made, 
even when it is a great offer. 
Always negotiate a little.

Hot and cold coginition
Psychologists have identified two 
approaches to decision-making: “hot 
cognition” and “cold cognition.” High-
speed, pressurized decisions use “hot 
cognition,” while logical, slow decisions  
use “cold cognition.” In high-pressure 
environments try to overcome your 
emotions and use “cold cognition.”

AVOIDING DECISION TRAPS    /    415
 Do not hesitate to reverse your original decision and 
cut your losses; create an exit strategy even before 
you get involved in the negotiation process.
Set a benchmark that could give you an advantage 
when your counterpart is ill-informed, but be aware 
that they could do the same to you. 
 Engage a trusted expert who will challenge your 
overconfidence in your ability to negotiate and put 
pressure on you to do a reality check. 
 Make sure that your offer is based on solid research. 
When buying, demand a performance guarantee of 
the product. 
 Invest time and energy in looking for information that 
is not easily available. You will often find accessible 
information that can improve your position.  
 Present information more or less vividly to 
influence others, but be wary of overvaluing 
information that is attractively presented to you. 
 As a negotiator, be aware of how the other party 
frames the situation and presents its offers.  
 Approach each negotiating event as a unique case. 
They are never identical.

Managing emotions
Understanding the approaches
There are three types of emotional 
approach in negotiations: rational 
(having a “poker face”), positive (being 
friendly and nice), and negative (ranting 
and raving). Of the three emotional 
strategies, the positive and rational 
approaches are more effective than  
the negative approach in achieving 
targets in an ultimatum setting.  
The positive approach is more helpful  
in building a long-term, constructive 
relationship than the rational or  
negative methods.
In the heat of a negotiation, the emotions you display can significantly 
influence the emotions of the other party. Effective negotiators try  
to synchronize their behavior with the other person’s, developing  
an interpersonal rhythm that reflects a shared emotional state.
POKER FACE
Some negotiators believe that 
exposing their emotions to the 
other party makes them vulnerable 
and will result in them giving away 
too much of the pie, and so try to 
always keep a “poker face” when 
they are negotiating. They also 
believe that emotional displays  
may result in an impasse or in 
defective decision-making, or 
cause negotiations to end.

MANAGING EMOTIONS    /    419
STRATEGIC USE OF ANGER
Some negotiators successfully use displays of anger strategically to try  
to encourage the other party to agree to their demands. They aim to gain 
concessions from their opponent because the other party takes their 
anger as a sign that they are close to their reservation point. Inducing fear 
in their opponent pushes that person to cave in and agree. It sends the 
signal that they would rather walk away from the table without reaching 
an agreement than settle for less than what they want. The opponent may 
also wish to end the unpleasant interaction by giving in.
In focus
BEING POSITIVE
Some negotiators believe that displaying positive 
emotions enhances the quality of the negotiated 
agreement, because a good mood promotes 
creative thinking, leads to innovative problem-
solving, and smoothes out communication. 
Negotiators with a positive approach use more 
cooperative strategies, use fewer hard tactics, 
engage in more information exchange, generate 
more alternatives, and come to fewer impasses 
than negotiators with a negative or rational mood.
BEING NEGATIVE
Negotiators who use the negative approach 
display anger, rage, and impatience to influence 
the other party. Anger is sometimes used 
strategically, but negotiators who are genuinely 
angry feel little compassion for the other party, 
and are less effective at expanding and slicing  
the pie than positive negotiators. They tend to 
achieve fewer win–win gains when angry than 
when they experience positive emotions. Angry 
negotiators are also less willing to cooperate  
and more likely to seek revenge.

Using emotional intelligence
When negotiators are emotionally 
overwhelmed, their mental capacity  
to negotiate effectively is impaired. To 
overcome this, you must manage your 
emotions intelligently. You need to  
be aware of the emotions you are 
experiencing and be able to monitor  
and regulate them, and you need to find 
ways to empathize with the other party.  
When negotiating with any other group  
or individual, it is important to make a 
conscious attempt to modulate your 
irritation. For example, while it might be 
frustrating if your counterpart retracts 
from an earlier commitment, you could 
disguise your irritation and use the term 
“misunderstanding” instead of openly 
displaying your anger.

Dealing with  
competitive tactics
In competitive win–lose position-based negotiations, negotiators  
use various manipulative tactics to maximize their interests while 
disregarding the interests of their counterparts. They usually believe 
that these tactics are quite effective. Often, however, these tactics  
can backfire, escalating the level of negotiation or even leading to  
an impasse. Skilled negotiators recognize these tactical traps and  
know how to avoid and neutralize them.
MAKING A HIGHBALL OR LOWBALL OFFER
A negotiator assumes that you are not fully informed  
and tries to take advantage by making a very high offer 
as a seller, or a low offer as a buyer. Their objective is to 
replace the benchmark you have in your mind with one  
in their favor. 
To avoid: Be confident in your benchmarks and try to see 
clearly through this ploy.
PLAYING GOOD GUY/BAD GUY
One negotiator plays tough and uses aggressive 
tactics, such as threats and ultimatums. Another 
empathizes to make you believe that he or she is 
on your side. Neither is on your side—both are 
trying to maximize their own interests. 
To avoid: Focus squarely on protecting your  
own interests.
Competitive tactics and how to avoid them

DEALING WITH COMPETITIVE TACTICS    /    423
USING EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL
A negotiator tries to intimidate or influence you by fabricating 
anger, frustration, or despair. They try to emotionally shake 
you and make you feel responsible for the lack of progress.  
To avoid: Use your emotional intelligence. Stay calm and 
centered, and try to steer the negotiations back on track.
SEPARATING THE ISSUES  
A negotiator insists on reaching an agreement on a single 
issue before moving on. This prevents you from bundling 
issues together and creating opportunities for trade-offs. 
To avoid: Negotiate multiple issues at once, stating that 
“nothing is agreed upon until everything is agreed upon.”
APPLYING TIME PRESSURE
The other party uses the pressure of time to try to get you  
to concede by setting tight deadlines for an offer, or using 
delaying tactics to reduce the time free for the negotiation. 
To avoid: Use your judgment to decide whether a deadline  
is real or not.

concession at the last minute is not usually a deal breaker.

424    /    CONDUCTING NEGOTIATIONS
Closing the deal
Preparing to close
Before you close the deal, both you and 
your counterpart need to understand  
that the purpose of making the deal is  
not to sign the contract, but rather to 
accomplish what the contract specifies. 
What goals is each party pursuing 
through the deal and what will it take  
to accomplish them? As you depend on 
each other to accomplish your goals,  
it is important to make sure that  
both parties are signing the contract 
wholeheartedly. Review both parties’ key 
interests and ensure that nothing has 
been neglected. It is quite possible for 
the other party to decide to overturn the 
entire deal if he or she feels pushed into 
an agreement without having their own 
needs taken care of.
Considering implementation
Most negotiators underestimate the 
importance of implementation. If not 
considered, the intense process of 
negotiation can undermine your ability  
to achieve your goals after the deal has 
been signed. For example, if you have 
used hard negotiation tactics to push the 
other party to agree to the deal, the other 
party may feel, upon signing the contract, 
that they have been unfairly treated and 
sabotage the deal, or fail to deliver.
Before you put pen to paper, discuss 
the implementation of the deal with the 
other party. What you agree must fulfill 
the needs of both parties if you are to 
ensure successful implementation 
Unless both parties have confidence  
that the deal can be successfully 
implemented, there is no point in 
continuing the discussion.
Closing the deal after reaching an agreement is the last but most critical 
part of any negotiation process. It is certainly not simple, and is not just 
about outcomes. It also has to do with building relationships and making 
sure that the negotiated agreements can be carried out smoothly. 
Closing the deal properly is especially important when negotiated 
agreements are complex and multidimensional.
When closing the deal,  
make sure that neither  
party overcommits.
Treat closing as the start of a 
collaborative process between 
you and the other party.

effective 
implementation

CLOSING THE DEAL    /    425
Reaching agreement
A written agreement usually marks the 
closure of a negotiation. The agreement, 
which includes solutions for both parties, 
may be summarized and you may ask the 
other party to sign this document. This is 
the most simple and natural way to 
conclude a negotiation. Changes should 
be allowed after the agreement has been 
signed. In other words, if circumstances 
change, both parties should feel quite 
comfortable contacting the other party to 
discuss these changes. Upon mutual 
agreement, such necessary changes can 
be incorporated into the new agreement. 
Make sure you include this last point in 
the agreement, as a deal is not done until 
it is done—it is better to allow for some 
flexibility than to force the other party to 
overthrow the entire deal, should the 
circumstances change.

Negotiating as a team
Deciding when to use a team
Some negotiations demand a diverse  
set of abilities. In addition to sound 
negotiation and psychosocial skills  
you may need specific technical 
expertise, for example, in areas of law, 
drafting joint ventures, or the planning 
system. You may need to exercise 
leverage on your counterpart through 
the use of PR, or require a keen 
appreciation of politics and strategy to 
identify the multiple stakeholders in  
the negotiation and figure out their 
interests. If you lack any of these 
abilities, you will probably benefit 
from the collective wisdom  
of a team.
Many business situations are too complex for a solo negotiator to be  
fully informed about every aspect of the deal. In such cases, working in  
a team may give better results, though this requires a high degree of 
internal coordination and a smooth flow of information between members.

DECISION TIME
Negotiating as a team begs the 
question of how to decide on a 
course of action. Broadly, there  
are three ways to reach a decision. 
The first is unanimity, in which all 
team members agree on a given 
issue. This is a tough rule and not 
recommended for most situations. 
The second is the majority rule. 
The majority will decide and the 
minority comply with the decision. 
The hazard here is that the 
majority may impose a tough 
solution that the minority cannot 
live with. The third, and usually 
best, decision-making rule is 
consensus: making a decision that 
not all the team members agree 
with fully, but that all can live with.

Understanding the advantages
There are many benefits to negotiating as a 
team. Being part of a team provides for multiple 
creative trade-offs and options and has other 
advantages, too. Sheer “strength in numbers” 
makes a team feel secure and powerful and 
sends a clear message to the other party that 
you are serious about the deal. You are also 
likely to feel less pressured when negotiating 
as a team, and are unlikely to make too many 
concessions too early in the process. 
Advantages and pitfalls

NEGOTIATING AS A TEAM    /    431
Avoiding the pitfalls
Working in a team can lead to a lack of focus 
and consistency, so appoint a chief negotiator to 
lead your team and agree in advance each 
member’s roles and responsibilities. Avoid 
falling into “group think,” when team members 
feel pressured to conform to an existing group 
mindset and reluctant to present ideas that 
conflict with it. It can also be easy for a team to 
create a false sense of cohesiveness: “us,”  
the good team, versus “them,” the bad team.  
If this happens, genuine conciliatory attempts 
made by the other party can be dismissed as 
dishonest “tricks” and rejected, resulting in 
missed opportunities to make a deal.

Dealing with many parties
Balancing complex issues
Multiparty negotiations are in many  
ways similar to two-party situations but 
require a wider set of skills to deal with 
their additional complexities, which 
include those listed here: 
Many business partnerships or deals involve agreements between three 
or more different parties, each with its own positions, needs, and goals. 
Negotiating in this environment requires dexterity and a constant eye  
on the pitfalls, such as coalitions between the parties opposing you.  
 Social complexity With more 
negotiators involved, the social 
context becomes complex. In a 
two-party negotiation, your focus  
is on one individual, but multiparty 
negotiations require you to 
understand, analyze, and build 
relationships with each negotiator. 
You must learn to resist social 
pressure and protect your interests, 
even when faced by a coalition of 
parties in the negotiation.
 Emotional complexity Negotiating 
in a multiparty context can be  
very taxing. Hold your emotions  
in check; emotional distress often 
results in poor decisions.
 Strategic complexity Multiple 
parties have many interests,  
and often conflicts of interest, 
between them. Each party has 
its BATNA (Best Alternative  
To a Negotiated Agreement),  
which may change as alliances 
are formed. To be well prepared 
for a multiparty negotiation,  
you will need to constantly 
reassess both your own and 
your counterparts’ BATNAs.

CHAIRING MULTIPARTY 
TALKS
The central challenge for the Chair 
of a meeting is to gain the trust of 
the negotiating parties. Former 
Senator George J. Mitchell, US 
Senate Majority Leader, stated that 
in mediating the dispute in 
Northern Ireland, his ability to be 
effective ultimately depended more 
on gaining the delegates’ trust and 
confidence than on his formal role 
and authority. The Chair should  
be clear about his or her role, 
introduce the agenda, introduce 
ground rules, provide parties  
with opportunities to express 
themselves, and distill common 
interests. The Chair should  
also regularly summarize the 
progress that has been made  
in the negotiation.

 Informational complexity  
The number of parties involved 
produces multiple exchanges of 
information, proposals, and 
multiple trade-offs. You need to 
develop a solid information system 
that can record and recall all the 
information exchanged in the 
negotiation room. 
 Procedural complexity The design 
of the negotiation process may be 
fraught with difficulty. Its structure, 
the rules of engagement, selection 
of venue, sequence of issues, and 
how decisions will be made, must 
be perceived to be fair. In high-value 
negotiations, it is wise to employ  
an expert to facilitate the process 
more effectively.

Building winning coalitions
The moment there are more than two parties in a 
negotiation, there are opportunities to make 
coalitions. To protect your interests and remain in 
the negotiating game, one of your major objectives 
will be to think well in advance about offense (how to 
build a winning coalition) as well as defense (how to 
put together a blocking coalition).   
When attempting to build a stable coalition, there 
are three essential factors to consider. The first is 
the issue of agreement. Some parties will agree and 
others will disagree with your vision and the 
strategies and tactics you plan to use to achieve it. 
DIVIDE THE PIE 
Make it clear to your 
coalition partners  
how the benefits—the 
proverbial pie—will be 
divided if you achieve 
your goals. The division 
certainly must be fair, 
but fairness does not 
necessarily mean an 
equal share. 
Tip
To build a coalition, 
there are three 
factors to consider

DEALING WITH MANY PARTIES    /    435
Gaining influence and trust
The second important factor to consider when 
building a coalition is influence. Some potential 
partners may be highly influential and can use 
their positions of power to assist you in moving 
your agenda forward, while others will be weak 
and unable to help much. The third factor to 
consider is trust. Coalitions are temporary entities 
driven by self-interest, so partners are easily 
seduced to defect once the payoffs elsewhere 
become higher. Your main objective should be to 
recruit potential partners who are trustworthy  
and will remain loyal to the coalition.
GAIN POWER 
Consider building  
a coalition if you 
think you hold  
a weaker hand  
than one of your 
opponents. Being 
part of a successful 
coalition may help 
you shift the balance 
of power. 
Tip

436    /    DEVELOPING YOUR TECHNIQUE
Recruiting coalition partners
When building a coalition, start by 
identifying all stakeholders, both 
supporters and opponents of your 
objectives. Classify each one according 
to their level of agreement (high, 
medium, or low, on a scale from one  
to 10), the degree of influence they  
could bring to the coalition, and their 
level of perceived trustworthiness.  
First, approach your best potential 
allies—the parties who agree with  
your vision and agenda and are very 
influential and trustworthy.

Gaining allies
Next, focus on the allies who agree with 
your vision and are trustworthy, but who 
do not hold positions of power at the 
moment; they may gain influence as the 
negotiation proceeds. Ignore the weak 
adversaries: those who disagree with 
your agenda and have little influence.  
At the same time, think how you could 
block your powerful adversaries.  
Can you make a coalition with one of their 
potential partners? Coalition partners 
are often motivated solely by gains.  
Once the gains elsewhere are higher, 
they may defect, so you should attempt  
to cement integrity within the coalition.  
One way to do this is to ask each partner 
to make a public commitment to the 
coalition, making it harder for them  
to defect.

Negotiating internationally
Understanding the differences
You are likely to experience significant differences 
in several key areas when you engage in 
international negotiation:
 Agreements Western negotiators expect to 
conclude the process with a comprehensive 
bulletproof legal contract. In other regions, and 
notably in Asia, memorandums of understanding 
(MOAs), which are broader but less substantial  
agreements, may be more common.
Time sensitivity In countries in which a 
“doing” culture is prevalent, people believe 
in controlling events and managing time 
strictly. In some countries, time is not 
viewed as such a critical resource, and 
negotiations can be slow and lengthy.
Degree of formality Negotiators from informal cultures 
tend to dress down, address one another by their first 
names, maintain less physical distance, and pay less 
attention to official titles. In contrast, negotiators from 
formal cultures tend to use formal titles and are mindful 
of seating arrangements.
In today’s global economy, ever more business deals are made across 
national borders. Negotiating international deals is a challenge because 
you must be familiar with the complexities of the immediate negotiation 
context, such as the bargaining power of the parties and the relevant 
stakeholders, as well as the broader context, which may include 
currency fluctuations and government control.

NEGOTIATING INTERNATIONALLY    /    439
POLITICAL RISK 
While some countries have long traditions of an abundance of 
resources and political stability, others have scarce resources  
and are marked by volatile political changes.
IDEOLOGY  
In individualistic cultures like the US, the purpose of the business is  
to serve the interests of its shareholders, but in collective cultures, 
the business has a larger purpose: to contribute to the common 
good of society.
CULTURE 
Different cultures have starkly different cultural beliefs about the role 
of individuals in society, the nature of relationships, and the ways in 
which people should communicate. These have a fundamental effect  
on how you need to approach a negotiation.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE 
Currencies fluctuate and affect the balance of expenses and profits. 
The stability of the currency your investment is made in affects the risk 
to you. Many governments also control the flow of currency, limiting the 
amount of money that can cross their borders.
BUREAUCRACY 
Business practices and government regulations vary from country to 
country. In some countries, the government bureaucracy is deeply 
embedded in business affairs, and businesses are constantly required 
to secure government approval before they act.
POLITICAL AND LEGAL SYSTEMS
Different countries have different tax codes, labor laws, legal 
philosophies and enforcement policies, laws that govern joint 
ventures, and financial incentives for attracting business 
investments.

Negotiating in Asia
Succeeding in any international 
negotiation means taking the time to 
understand the complex negotiating 
environment, being sufficiently flexible to 
be able to change your ways of working if 
necessary, and learning to work within 
different governmental bureaucracies. 
The overall cultural and business 
landscape in Asia is especially unfamiliar 
to Western organizations. With the 
region’s rapid rise in economic 
prominence, however, every manager 
needs to be aware of how it differs.

Tip

NEGOTIATING INTERNATIONALLY    /    441
Chinese business leaders invest heavily in making interpersonal 
connections and creating a dependable social network, known as 
“guanxi.” They prefer to do business within their trusted network. 
The Confucian teaching xinping qihe, meaning “being perfectly 
calm,” makes it difficult for Western negotiators to “read” their 
counterparts and to know where they stand. 
The concept of fairness is based on needs: those who have more 
should give to those with less.
Asian businesses like to do business with trustworthy individuals 
rather than faceless organizations. The lengthy process of building 
trust is based on openness, mutual assistance, understanding, 
and the formation of emotional bonds. 
Dignity and prestige are gained when individuals behave morally 
and achieve accomplishments. Face is a formidable force in the 
Asian psyche that negotiators in Western organizations must be 
particularly aware of.
You risk insulting your Asian counterpart if you emphasize 
penalties for not honoring commitments in detail. Contracts are 
short and merely a tangible expression of the relationships being 
created. They are not treated as “fixed” legal instruments. 
Although Chinese and Japanese societies are hierarchical, they 
use the consensus style of decision-making. Lead negotiators 
refrain from dictating a decision in order to preserve 
relationships and give face to others.

442    /    DEVELOPING YOUR TECHNIQUE
Acknowledging differences
Asian culture is characterized by concern 
for people’s feelings. It emphasizes 
interdependence, cooperation, and 
harmony, while Western culture tends  
to be more competitive and achievement-
oriented, and rewards assertiveness. 
Like Asian culture, in South America 
good relationships are vital, but so is 
emotional expression.
Asian and South American societies 
tend to give a higher priority to collective 
goals; self-sacrifice for the good of the 
whole is a guiding principle. Also, there 
is a greater acceptance of unequal  
power distribution, and relationships  
are built based on differences of  
status, age, and gender.
Avoiding uncertainty  
Another cultural differentiator is  
the level of comfort of individuals  
in ambiguous situations. Business 
people in China and Japan like to avoid 
uncertainty, preferring structured and 
clear situations in which they are able  
to make decisions after careful 
evaluation of a large amount of 
information. Contrast this with some 
Western societies, where people are 
more comfortable with ambiguous 
situations and are prepared to make 
quick decisions based on a limited 
amount of information. In South America, 
people may be deliberately ambiguous to 
avoid being directly negative.
Be aware too that there are 
differences in communication styles: 
Asians may be “high context” (indirect, 
implicit, and suggestive), while those 
from the West are “low context”—more 
direct and specific.
Understanding emotions 
South American business people often 
seek to form close, friendly relationships 
at the outset of any negotiation. They  
may talk and express their emotions  
with a level of intensity that many Asian 
and European cultures avoid.
MAKE A CONNECTION 
Present your partners with  
a long-term vision of the 
mutual benefits of a deal, 
stressing your personal 
relationship rather than  
legal obligations.

The South American style of negotiation
EXPRESSING EMOTIONS
Using expansive gestures and speaking loudly and with 
passion is considered usual in many conversations. Do  
not wait for a pause to join the debate—a continuous flow  
of conversation builds bonds and deepens trust. 
RESPECT
Treating people with the correct level of respect in relation 
to both their role in a company and standing in society is 
equally important. A chain of command guides business 
processes, but at each level team members work together 
with mutual respect.
FAMILY TIES
Extended families form the core of South American society. 
Often there is limited distinction between personal and 
business life, so expressing interest in the families of  
South American colleagues and discussing your own  
family is important when negotiating. 
GREETINGS
A close, personal greeting to every team member at the 
start of each meeting will make people feel valued and 
important. In South American cultures, being open and 
welcoming is part of professional life.
AVOIDING CONFLICT
The word “no” is rarely expressed in conversation. Refusing 
a request or being negative is considered impolite, so many 
South Americans will avoid certain subjects or use reserve 
and closed expressions to imply their true intentions. 

444    /    DEVELOPING YOUR TECHNIQUE
Using a coach
Understanding the benefits
Many negotiators do not realize that 
they could improve their techniques. 
They continue to make the same  
type of mistakes because they filter 
information, hearing only what they 
want to hear, rather than absorbing 
the complete information that is 
required to perform well. Another 
self-serving trap is attribution. 
Negotiators often attribute problems 
in negotiations to their counterpart 
negotiators. An objective coach who 
is willing to challenge you can help 
raise your awareness of your 
limitations and improve your 
negotiating performance. 
Many negotiators have blind spots, hold false assumptions, and are 
prone to repeating their mistakes. Some people continue to fail to 
understand the other party’s perspective, are unable to convert 
positions to interests, or are unable to manage their emotions. Working 
with a coach is an excellent way to gain perspective on your weaknesses 
and strengths and develop your skills for greater success.

USING A COACH    /    445
Being assessed
When you first work with a coach, they 
will make an assessment of your 
performance. This often starts with a 
360-degree feedback session, in which 
your coach collects data from people you 
negotiate with, in order to identify your 
strengths and weaknesses. The coach 
may also “shadow” you in some actual 
negotiations, to take note of your existing 
performance. Witnessing you in action 
allows a coach to provide relevant and 
insightful suggestions for improvement. 
The key outcome from the diagnosis is 
for the coach to identify your patterns in 
beliefs and behaviors so that you have a 
higher level of self-awareness.
Fine-tuning your style
The coach then works with you to identify 
the skill sets and attitudes you want to 
focus on throughout the coaching period. 
Coaches are experienced in diagnosing 
possible pitfalls in your negotiation 
styles, and can help you be proactive in 
preventing them from occurring. They 
can also help you to uncover issues and 
resolve them on your own. They can 
expand your repertoire of behaviors by 
trying out different approaches and 
styles with you. Coaches ask a lot of 
questions. A good coach helps the 
negotiator to test his or her own 
assumptions, consider different 
perspectives, and reach a conclusion 
about how to proceed. Many coaches will 
use scenario role play to help you 
practice new ways of doing things.
Once you have used the new ideas and 
approaches in a real negotiation, a coach 
can provide a non-threatening evaluation 
and help you learn from your mistakes, 
achievements, and missed opportunities. 
Your learning can then be applied in your 
next round of negotiations.
ROLE PLAY
Scenario role play can be an effective method of preparing for 
negotiations. A coach can help you rehearse your role and make sure 
there are no gaps or weaknesses in your case and in the negotiation 
process. For example, the coach can help identify your BATNA or make 
sure that you are not too enamored with the potential deal to the extent 
that you are unable to walk away from it. Although it is impossible to 
perfectly script a negotiation process ahead of time, it is helpful to “know 
your destination and all the terrain” so that even if the other party takes 
the process off track, you can still find a way to achieve your goals.

Being a mediator
Defining mediation
Mediation is a structured process in which an 
impartial third party facilitates the resolution of  
a conflict between two negotiating parties. For 
mediation to be successful, the person selected to 
mediate a dispute must be acceptable to both of the 
parties. They must be entirely happy that the 
mediator is unbiased and will assess the 
circumstances of the dispute objectively.  
Acting appropriately
If you are asked to mediate a dispute, you 
need to be certain that you will be able 
to remain impartial and not let yourself 
get swept up in the emotional side of 
what is taking place. Your role will 
require you to look at the situation 
from the perspective of each of 
the disputing parties to find 
areas of common ground 
between them, and use 
this information to 
make some 
recommendations 
that would be 
acceptable to  
both parties.
As a manager, you will often have to negotiate directly with others within 
your organization, but will also sometimes be asked to get involved as a 
third party to try and help parties engaged in disputes to resolve their 
conflicts. You therefore need to understand the principles of effective 
mediation and how your role is different to that of other mediators.

BEING A MEDIATOR    /    447
ENCOURAGE SELF-
DETERMINATION 
Ensure that the disputing parties 
recognize their differences and know 
that their participation in the mediation 
process is voluntary and they are free  
to leave at any time.
GIVE OWNERSHIP
Let the disputing parties 
know that they must take 
responsibility for the 
conflict and for its 
resolution, and are 
expected to identify  
the issues and engage 
creatively in solving  
the conflict.
REMAIN NEUTRAL
Ensure that you remain 
neutral and help to facilitate 
the mediation process, 
rather than actively trying to 
influence the outcomes of 
the conflict.
ADVOCATE 
CONFIDENTIALITY
Make it clear to all parties  
that the mediation process  
is confidential. Disputing 
parties are only likely to share 
important information if they 
believe that the mediator is 
neutral and trustworthy.
USE AN INTEGRATIVE 
APPROACH
Try to understand the interests of 
each of the disputing parties, and 
help them reach an integrative 
(win–win) resolution that they 
would both find acceptable.
KEEP THE GOAL IN MIND
Always remember that the aim of mediation 
through integrative negotiation is not to 
achieve absolute justice, but to develop 
options and find the most workable and 
satisfactory option.
Principles of effective mediation

448    /    DEVELOPING YOUR TECHNIQUE
Remaining impartial
The manager’s role as a mediator is similar to that  
of other neutral third-party mediators. He or she  
is working to the same goal as other mediators: to 
help the disputing parties resolve their disputes. 
However, as the types of conflict a manager has  
to deal with often affect organizational goals and 
performance, he or she may sometimes find it 
difficult to remain neutral to its consequences. In 
order to protect the organization’s interests, the 
manager may sometimes have to exercise more 
control over how the conflict is mediated and also 
over how the dispute will be resolved. In addition, 
managers will often have a shared history and 
possibly a future relationship with the disputing 
parties. Given these challenges, a manager must  
do his or her utmost to mediate the dispute in an 
unbiased manner.

BEING A MEDIATOR    /    449
Understanding the process
The mediation process is a step-by-step, structured process. However, unlike the 
rigid legal process used for mediation, the process used by managers is flexible. It 
involves five main steps:
•  Initial contact Start by meeting with each party to identify the issues and provide 
general information about the mediation process and principles.
•  Assessment and preparation Next, you need to introduce your role as the 
mediator and talk to each disputing party to obtain information about the nature 
of the dispute. You should also make an assessment of your ability to mediate 
this dispute, by deciding whether the disputing parties are ready for mediation. 
You also need to get the parties to commit to engaging in constructive mediation, 
by asking them to sign a contract. Finally, make a list of the issues in dispute for 
later discussion.
•  Joint opening session Once you are fully prepared, you then need to establish a 
psychologically safe environment in which the mediation can take place. Clarify 
the rules of engagement, such as mutual respect, taking notes and meeting 
privately with each disputing party. Educate the parties on the differences 
between each of their positions and interests and begin to work on the issues.
•  Joint sessions Facilitate a productive joint problem-solving situation by 
continuing to move the disputing parties from positions to interests. Prioritize 
and narrow down the issues, identify areas of agreement and areas of 
disagreement, and encourage the disputing parties to make realistic proposals. 
This may take one or a number of sessions.
•  Agreement Write down aspects of the agreement as the disputing parties begin 
to agree on more issues. Ensure that the final agreement is very precise, is 
owned by the disputants, and is forward-looking.

Master negotiators have superior 
negotiating capabilities in three major 
areas: the ability to understand and 
analyze issues (cognitive skills); the 
ability to manage emotions, especially 
negative ones (emotional skills); and  
the ability to connect with others by 
developing relationships and trust  
(social skills). These are the areas  
that you need to work on if you are to  
hone your negotiating skills and work  
toward becoming a master negotiator.
Irrespective of the field in which they practice their trade, be it business, 
law, diplomacy, labor, or sports, master negotiators possess a unique 
set of combined characteristics that clearly differentiate them from 
common negotiators, and define their success. Every negotiator can 
benefit by understanding the skills and attitudes of a master negotiator.
BAD DEALS
Master negotiators know that negotiations are not about making the deal 
and signing the contract, but rather about diligently pursuing their 
interests. No deal is better than a bad deal, so they condition themselves 
mentally to walk away from the table if and when their interests are not 
met. Inexperienced negotiators tend to be biased toward securing a deal 
and often tend to stay at the table and get a poor deal. There are two 
reasons for this: first, negotiators do not want to let go of the sunk costs 
(expenses) involved in attempting to make the deal. Second, they do not 
want to face the fact that it simply is not possible to make the deal and 
thus feel that they have failed to produce results. Master negotiators, in 
contrast, are willing to let go of the sunk costs and do not feel that they 
have failed in the negotiation task if the deal does not go through.
In focus
Defining key attributes
Using masterful due 
diligence Master negotiators 
understand the dangers of 
being poorly prepared, and 
invest ample resources in 
planning and gathering useful 
information.

LEARNING FROM THE MASTERS    /    451
Being firm and flexible 
Master negotiators are firm 
and clear about the issues 
they must have, and flexible 
on the issues they would like 
to have.
Thinking strategically 
Negotiations are rarely a 
one-on-one business, so master 
negotiators spend time analyzing 
the interests of the “players” who 
are not at the table, how the 
power balance lies, and what 
opportunities exist to increase 
their own power.
Seeing the other side Master 
negotiators know that they can only 
present a good offer or trade-off if 
they know what their counterpart’s 
interests are. They are able to easily 
shift from seeing things from their 
point of view to seeing things from 
that of the other party.
Investing in relationships 
Master negotiators use all 
possible opportunities to 
nurture trust and develop 
relationships, and make sure 
that those connections 
remain intact over time.
Appreciating 
uniqueness Master 
negotiators approach 
every situation afresh 
and are always ready to 
modify their practices 
and adapt themselves to 
the specific conditions of 
any ongoing negotiation.
Managing emotions 
Master negotiators  
make an active choice  
to always monitor and 
constructively control 
their emotions.

Acknowledgments
Achieving High Performance
We would like to acknowledge and thank  
Mike’s friends and colleagues at the Centre  
for Business Performance, Cranfield School  
of Management for their support and ideas 
incorporated into this book. We would also like  
to thank the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
in England and Wales for giving Pippa the time  
to write this book and, in particular, Charles 
Carter and Debbie Kimpton for their support.
Effective Communication
My thanks to the good people at Cobalt id  
who have helped me condense decades of 
experience, teaching, and research into an 
interesting, readable volume. Had Marek 
Walisiewicz not called and asked me to consider 
this project, I’d never have gotten it done.  
My appreciation goes, in particular, to Kati Dye 
and the other talented artists, editors, and 
designers who’ve transformed my thoughts and 
observations into a lovely book. My thanks, as 
well, to Daniel Mills and the very professional 
staff of Dorling Kindersley whose diligence  
and professionalism with this title and this 
series have been nothing short of remarkable. 
Thanks to you all.
Managing People
This book would not have been created without 
the initiation, guidance, perseverance, and 
flexibility of Kati Dye at Cobalt id. We also want  
to thank Peter Jones at Dorling Kindersley for 
his assistance and adaptability in managing the 
schedule and business side of this project. 
Leadership
Writing a book for Dorling Kindersley 
immediately involves you in teamwork at its  
best—a combination of many talents, much 
patience, and great commitment. I would like  
to thank Adèle Hayward and Peter Jones for 
their vision and stewardship throughout and 
Marek Walisiewicz for his inspiring leadership  
in bringing about the meld of visual impact and 
words, with his team of editors and designers, 
which has made this such an interesting project.
Presenting
The author would like to thank the editors  
at Dorling Kindersley and Cobalt for their  
sure hand in guiding this project. This book  
is dedicated to: Scot, Benjamin and Anna,  
for their love, support, and patience; and  
to my father, Meyer Pincus, whose love  
of words and ideas lives on.
Negotiating
Our thanks go to the business associates  
at the Center for Negotiation (US) and the 
International Perspectives (Singapore), to the 
academic colleagues at Singapore Management 
University, to our editor Amrit Kaur, and to our 
research assistant Deborah NG Sui Ling. We 
appreciate your support. Thanks to the many 
managers and executives in US, UK, China,  
India, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, 
and the Philippines. Your active participation  
in our negotiation training and coaching 
workshops put our expertise to the ultimate  
test of relevancy and precision. Thanks to  
our students at Johns Hopkins University, 
Singapore Management University, and Nanyang 
Technological University, Singapore. Your 
inquisitive nature helped us crystallize our 
thinking. Thanks to Marek Walisiewicz, Peter 
Jones, Kati Dye, and many other talented 
designers and editors. Your commitment to 
publish this book gave light to our negotiation 
and coaching ideas. This collective endeavor  
will promote the best practice of negotiation.
