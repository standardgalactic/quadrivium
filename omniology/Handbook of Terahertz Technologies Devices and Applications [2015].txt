and (iii) Landau-level splitting under the magnetic field. Plasmons in 
patterned graphene are strongly coupled to electromagnetic waves, 
which constitutes a potential for development of tunable graphene-
based THz plasmonic metamaterials [84, 99, 105, 106]. Therefore, 
the prospects of graphene plasmonics for mid-IR and THz applica-
tions attract rapidly growing interest [46, 47, 51, 81, 94].
	
A number of models of the graphene conductivity has been 
developed so far [100], each being valid in a certain range of 
frequencies and carrier densities. For a high-frequency (from THz to 
IR) range, we use the relation for the graphene conductivity derived 
from the Kubo formula by Falkovsky and Varlamov [77]

, corresponds to the Drude absorption and is always 
positive. The THz frequency domain is situated in the intraband 
Drude conductivity-dominated region. The plasma-wave kinetic 
equations (hydrodynamic Euler equation and continuity equation) 
are derived from semiclassical Boltzmann equations for massless 
Dirac fermions. As is seen in Fig. 9.14 [112], in the low-frequency 
region, including the THz range, the intraband Drude conductivity is 
dominated and decreases with increasing frequency. The interband 
conductivity vanishes due to the Pauli-state blocking. At the photon 
energy twice as large as the Fermi level the interband conductivity 
starts to increase and saturate to a plateau of the quantum 
conductivity e2/4h.

9.5.2  Concept of Graphene THz Lasers
9.5.2.1  Negative THz conductivities in optically pumped 
graphene
Interband population inversion in graphene can be achieved by its 
optical pumping [69, 72] or carrier injection [68, 71]. At sufficiently 
strong excitation, the interband stimulated emission of photons can 
prevail over the intraband (Drude) absorption. In this case, the real 
part of the dynamic conductivity of graphene, Re[σ(ω)], becomes 
negative at some frequencies ω. Due to the gapless energy spectrum 

249
of graphene, Re[σ(ω)] can be negative in the THz range. This effect 
can be used in graphene-based THz lasers with optical or injection 
pumping, as shown in Fig. 9.15. A graphene photonic laser with the 
Fabry–Pérot resonators based on dielectric or slot-line waveguides 
[70, 113] was proposed for lasing THz photons. Stimulated emission 
of near-IR [114] and THz [66, 67] photons from population-inverted 
graphene was observed experimentally.

radiation in IR laser–pumped graphene (left: schematic image; 
center: band diagram; right: vertical Fabri–Pérot-type THz 
laser cavity structure in which multiple layers of monolayer 
graphene are installed.
	
Carrier relaxation and recombination dynamics in optically 
pumped graphene are schematically shown in Fig. 9.16. When the 
photogenerated electrons and holes are heated, collective excitations 
due to the carrier–carrier (CC) scattering take a dominant roll to 
perform an ultrafast carrier quasi-equilibration within a 10–100 
fs time scale [115–117]. Then carriers at high-energy tails of their 
distributions emit optical phonons (OPs), cooling themselves 
and accumulating around the Dirac points [118–120]. For the 
electron–hole recombination, optical-phonon-assisted or radiative 
recombination via direct transition may take place, thanks to 
the gapless symmetrical band structure. Moreover, interband CC 
scattering like Auger-type and/or impact ionization-type processes, 
which have been thought to be theoretically forbidden in graphene 
[121], may take place due to higher-order many-body effects and/or 
imperfections of crystal qualities, which could also strongly modify 
the carrier relaxation dynamics [122–125]. Recent experimental 
and theoretical works demonstrate such aspects on the carrier 
relaxation dynamics [122–125].

holes, the population inversion is obtainable, as seen in Fig. 9.16 
[67, 117]. When the pumping intensity exceeds a certain threshold 
level (staying ~107 W/cm2 for 0.8 eV pumping photons), the quasi-
Fermi level goes to the positive level, testifying to population 
inversion. The temporal evolution of the quasi-Fermi level and 
the carrier temperature in optically pumped graphene with a 
femtosecond laser pulse are numerically simulated, as shown in 
Fig. 9.17 [67]. Depending on the graphene quality (reflecting the 
carrier momentum relaxation time) the gain spectral profile and 
its temporal profile are different; in high quality of graphene the 
intraband Drude conductivity loss factor reduces so that a wider 
gain spectral bandwidth with an increased lower-frequency end is 
obtainable after few picoseconds from pumping to and last after 
~10 ps. Stimulated THz [66, 67] and IR photon emission [114] in 
optically pumped graphene have recently been observed at room 
temperature (Figs. 9.18 and 9.19), encouraging us to proceed toward 
the creation of graphene THz and IR lasers [70, 71, 113, 115, 116].

9.5.2.2  Ideas for current-injection THz lasers
Optical pumping suffers from significant heating of the electron–
hole plasma and the optical phonon system, which suppresses the 
formation of population inversion, as seen in Fig. 9.17. In the case of 
optical pumping with sufficiently low photon energy, however, the 
electron–hole plasma can be cooled down [67]. Another important 
parameter is the optical phonon decay time, todecay, which stands 
for the thermal conductivity of the material. A longer todecay (like 
suspended free-standing graphene) suppresses carrier cooling, 
preventing population inversion and thus negative conductivity 
[126]. Current injection pumping is the best solution to substantially 
reduce the pumping threshold because electrical pumping can serve 
any pumping energy below the order of “meV” when a p-i-n junction 
is formed like semiconductor laser diodes. A dual-gate structure can 
make a p-i-n junction in the graphene channel, as shown in Fig. 9.20 
[68, 71]. Gate biasing controls the injection level, whereas the drain 
bias controls the lasing gain profiles (photon energy and gain). To 
minimize the undesired tunneling current that lowers the injection 
efficiency the distance between the dual-gate electrodes must be 
sufficiently long.

9.5.3  Giant THz Gain by Excitation of Surface Plasmon 
Polaritons in Graphene
It is worthy to note that the negative THz conductivity of monolayer 
graphene is limited to or below the quantum conductivity (e2/4h), 
as seen in Eq. 9.11. This is because the absorption of THz photons 
that can contribute to the stimulated emission is only made via 
the interband transition process whose absorbance is limited by 
pe2/hc ~ 2.3% [127]. To overcome this limitation on quantum 
efficiency, a carrier-recycling process exploited in quantum cascade 
lasers (QCLs) should be introduced. In this regard, waveguide 
structures with in-plane THz photon propagation along the 
graphene sheet are preferable for conforming the laser cavities to 
maximize the gain overlapping and hence to overcome the quantum 
mechanical limit in comparison with vertical photon-emitting cavity 
structures (see Figs. 9.15 and 9.20) [70, 113]. To overcome the 2.3% 
absorbance limit, introduction of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) 
is a promising, smart, and important idea. There are several factors 
to exploit graphene plasmons: (i) excitation and propagation of the 
SPPs along population-inverted graphene [76, 86, 87], (ii) resonant 
plasmon absorption in structured graphene-like microribbon 
arrays as well as microdisk arrays [96–100, 112, 128–130], and (iii) 
superradiant emission mediated by the SPPs [86, 131]. 
	
As compared to the lasing associated with the stimulated emis-
sion of electromagnetic modes (i.e., photons), the stimulated emis-
sion of plasmons by the interband transitions in population-inverted 
graphene can be a much stronger emission process. The plasmon 
gain under population inversion in intrinsic graphene has been 
theoretically studied in Refs. [76, 86]. Nonequilibrium plasmons in 
graphene can be coupled to the transverse magnetic (TM) modes 
of electromagnetic waves, resulting in the formation and propaga-
tion of SPPs [76]. It is shown in Ref. [76] that the plasmon gain in 
pumped graphene can be very high due to the small group velocity 
of the plasmons in graphene and strong confinement of the plasmon 
field in the vicinity of the graphene layer. Consider the case shown in 
Fig. 9.21 (left) in which the TM-mode THz photon is irradiated to the 
xz plane. The propagation index ρ of the graphene SPP along the x 
coordinate is derived from Maxwell’s equations to be

where c is the speed of light in vacuum, n is the refractive index of the 
substrate, and sw is the conductivity at ω [76]. Thus the absorption 
coefficient α is obtained as the imaginary part of the wavevector 
along the x coordinate: a = Im(qz) = 2Im(r◊w/c). Figure 9.21 (right) 
plots simulated α for monolayer graphene on a substrate for 
various refraction indices n at 300 K. To set graphene in population 
inversion and hence negative dynamic conductivity a quasi-Fermi 
energy εF = 20 meV and a carrier momentum relaxation time τ = 
10 ps are assumed, respectively. The results demonstrate giant 
THz gain (negative values of absorption) of the order of 104 cm–1. 
An increase in the substrate refractive index and, consequently, 
stronger localization of the surface plasmon electric and magnetic 
fields results in markedly larger gain, that is, a negatively larger 
absorption coefficient, (compare curves 1 and 2 in Fig. 9.21). As 
follows from the comparison of curves 2 and 3 in Fig. 9.21, the 
contribution of the substrate loss to the surface plasmon absorption 
can be relatively weak at realistic values of the imaginary part of the 
substrate refractive index (corresponding to curve 3). In particular, 
in the case of the substrate made of undoped Si (Im (n) ≈ 3 × 10–4), the 
imaginary part of the refractive index can be smaller than those used 
in the calculations of curves 3–5 in Fig. 9.21. Indeed, waveguiding 
the THz emitted waves with less attenuation is another key issue to 
create a graphene THz laser.

We conducted optical pump, THz probe, and optical probe 
measurement at room temperature for intrinsic monolayer graphene 
on a SiO2/Si substrate. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 9.22, 
which is identical to the one described in Ref. [66] and is based on 
a time-resolved near-field reflective electro-optic sampling with a 
femtosecond-IR laser pulse for optical pumping and a synchronously 
generated THz pulse for probing the THz dynamics of the sample in a 
THz photon-echo manner. A 140 μm thick CdTe crystal acting as a THz 
probe pulse emitter, as well as an electrooptic sensor, was placed on 
an exfoliated monolayer-graphene/SiO2/Si sample. A femtosecond-
pulsed fiber laser with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 80 
fs, a repetition rate of 20 MHz, and an average power of ~4 mW was 
used as the optical pump and probe source. The laser is split into 
two paths used for pump and probe. The pumping laser beam, being 
linearly polarized, is mechanically chopped at ~1.2 kHz (for lock-in 
detection) and focused with a beam diameter of about 120 μm onto 
the sample and the CdTe from the back side, while the probing beam 
is cross-polarized with respect to the pump beam and focused from 
the top side. The CdTe can rectify the optical pump pulse to emit the 
envelope THz probe pulse. The emitted primary THz beam grows 
along the Cherenkov angle to be detected at the CdTe top surface as 
the primary pulse (marked with “” in Fig. 9.22b) and then reflects 
being subject to the graphene sample. When the substrate of the 
sample is conductive the THz probe pulse transmitting through 
graphene again reflects back to the CdTe top surface, which is 
electro-optically detected as a THz photon-echo signal (marked with 
“” in Fig. 9.22b). Therefore, the original temporal response consists 
of the first forward-propagating THz pulsation (no interaction with 
graphene) followed by a photon-echo signal (probing the graphene). 
The delay between these two pulsations is given by the total round-
trip propagation time of the THz probe pulse through the CdTe. The 
system bandwidth is estimated to be around 6 THz, mainly limited 
by the Reststrahlen band of the CdTe sensor crystal [66]. The roll-off 
at a higher frequency of the photon-echo spectrum starts at ~2 THz, 
continuing monotonically till ~4THz, and lasts at ~6 THz [66].
	
The sample prepared for this experiment is monolayer graphene, 
which was exfoliated from graphite and transferred onto a SiO2/
Si substrate, and is identical to the one used in Refs. [66, 67]. The 
graphene sample was characterized by the surface morphology using 
atomic force microscopy (AFM), crystallographic properties using 
Raman spectroscopy, doping effects using Hall-effect measurement,

and the microscopic surface potential distribution (fluctuation) 
using Kelvin force microscopy (KFM), as shown in Refs. [66, 67]. 
The flake size of the graphene was ~7000 μm2. The momentum 
relaxation time was characterized to be 3.5 ps from the G-band-to-
D-band peak intensity ratio of the Raman spectra, as also shown in 
Refs. [66, 67]. Table 9.3 summarizes these properties.

We observe the spatial distribution of the THz probe pulse under 
the linearly polarized optical pump and THz probe pulse conditions 
[132]. To measure the in-plane spatial distributions of the THz probe 
pulse radiation, the optical probe pulse position (at the top surface 
of the CdTe crystal) was changed step by step by moving the incident 
point of the optical pump pulse. The pumping intensity IΩ was fixed at 
the maximum level, 3 × 107 W/cm2. We measured 10 times at every 
point with and without graphene, respectively, and took averages 
to obtain the electric field intensities and the resultant Fourier 
transform spectra. The observed field distributions for the primary 
pulse and the secondary pulse intensity are shown in Fig. 9.23 [132]. 
The primary pulse field is situated along the circumference with 
diameter ~50 μm, concentric to the center of the optical pumping 
position. On the other hand, the secondary pulse (THz photon echo) 
field is concentrated only at the restricted spot area on and out of 
the concentric circumference with diameter ~150 μm where the 
incoming THz probe pulse takes a TM mode being capable of exciting 
the SPPs in graphene. The distance between the primary pulse 
position and the secondary pulse position is ~100 μm or longer. The 
observed field distribution reproduces the reasonable trajectory of 
the THz echo pulse propagation in the TM modes inside the CdTe 
crystal, as shown in Fig. 9.22, when we assume the Cherenkov angle 
of 30 degrees, which was determined by the fraction of the refractive 
indices between IR and THz frequencies.
	
How to couple the incoming/outgoing THz pulse photons to the 
surface plasmons in graphene is the point of discussion, because 
the defect-less and flat surface of graphene itself has no structural 
feature that can excite SPPs. One possibility of the excitation of 
SPPs by the incoming THz probe pulse is the spatial charge density 
modulation at the area of photoexcitation by optical pumping. The 
pump beam having a Gaussian profile with diameter ~120 μm may 
define the continuum SPP modes in a certain THz frequency range, 
as seen in various SPPs waveguide structures [133, 134]. After a 
short propagation of the order of ~10 μm the SPPs approach the 
edge boundary of illuminated and dark areas so that they could 
mediate the THz electromagnetic emission [135, 136]. The plasmon 
group velocity in graphene (exceeding the Fermi velocity) and 
propagation distance give a propagation time of the order of 100 fs. 
According to the calculated gain spectra shown in Fig. 9.21 (right)

the gain enhancement factor could reach or exceed ~10 at the gain 
peak frequency of 4 THz, which is dominated in the optically probed 
secondary pulse signals. The obtained gain enhancement factor is  
<50, which is still higher than the calculated results and whose 
causes should be clarified in further study.

9.5.4  Active Graphene Plasmonic Metamaterials for 
Super-Radiant THz Plasmonic Lasing
The amplification of the THz wave by stimulated generation of 
resonant plasmons in a planar periodic array of graphene plasmonic 
microcavities has been theoretically derived using a self-consistent 
electromagnetic approach [86]. Figure 9.24a depicts the graphene 
device structure. Graphene microcavities are confined between the 
contacts of the metal grating located on a flat surface of a dielectric 
(which can be Si or SiC in a practical case) substrate. Suppose that 
the graphene is pumped either by its optical illumination [66, 67, 69] 
or by injection of electrons and holes from opposite metal contacts 
in each graphene microcavity. In the latter case, the opposite ends 
of each graphene microcavity adjacent to the metal contacts have 

259
to be p- and n-doped [68, 71]. One can imagine a biasing scheme for 
applying DC voltages to successive metal contacts in an interdigital 
manner [32–36] in order to ensure injection of the carries into each 
graphene microcavity. The carrier population and hence the dynamic 
conductivity are characterized by the quasi-Fermi level and carrier 
temperature, as described in the previous section. 
	
We assume that an external electromagnetic wave (of 
THz frequency) is incident upon the planar array of graphene 
microcavities at a normal direction to its plane with the polarization 
of the electric field across the metal grating contacts (Fig. 9.24a). 
Then we solve the problem of the amplification of the THz wave by 
the array of graphene micro-/nanocavities in a semianalytical self-
consistent electromagnetic approach similar to that described in 
Ref. [137]. Figure 9.24b shows the contour map of the calculated 
absorbance as a function of the quasi-Fermi energy (which 
corresponds to the pumping strength) and the THz wave frequency 
for an array of the graphene microcavities with period L = 4 μm and 
the length of each microcavity a = 2 μm. The absorbance is defined 
as the ratio between the absorbed or emitted (which corresponds to 
negative absorbance) THz power per unit area of the array and the 
energy flux density in the incoming THz wave. In the amplification 
regime, the negative value of the absorbance yields the amplification 
coefficient. The value of Re[σGr(ω)] is negative above the solid black 
line in Fig. 9.24b, corresponding to Re[σGr(ω)] = 0 (i.e., to transparent 
graphene). Above this boundary line, negative absorption (i.e., 
amplification) takes place at all frequencies and pumping strengths. 
The plasmon absorption resonances below the Re[σGr(ω)] = 0 line 
give way to the amplification resonances above this line. Plasmon 
resonances appear at frequencies ω = ωp(q) determined by the 
selection rule for the plasmon wavevector qn = (2n − 1)π/aeff, where 
aeff is the effective length of the graphene micro-/nanocavity. The 
frequency of the plasmon resonance is determined mainly by the 
imaginary part of the graphene conductivity, while the real part of 
the conductivity (Eq. 9.11) is responsible for the energy loss (for 
Re[σGr(ω)] >0) or energy gain (for Re[σGr(ω)] <0).
	
With increasing eF, the energy gain can balance the energy loss 
caused by the electron scattering in graphene so that the net energy 
loss becomes zero, Re[σ(ω)] = 0, and correspondingly graphene be-

comes transparent. In this case, the plasmon resonance line exhibits 
a nonsymmetric Fano-like shape because the real part of graphene 
conductivity changes its sign across the plasmon resonance. In this 
case, the plasmon resonance linewidth is given solely by its radiative 
broadening (because the dissipative damping is close to zero in this 
case). Above the graphene transparency line Re[σGr(ω)] = 0, the THz 
wave amplification at the plasmon resonance frequency is several 
orders of magnitude stronger than away from the resonances (the 
latter corresponding to the photon amplification in population-in-
verted graphene [66, 67, 70, 71, 113]). Note that at a certain value of 
the quasi-Femi energy, the amplification coefficient at the plasmon 
resonance tends toward infinity with the corresponding amplifica-
tion linewidth shrinking down to zero. (Of course, the divergence 
of the amplification coefficient is unphysical; it is a consequence of 
the linear electromagnetic approach used in this work.) This corre-
sponds to plasmonic lasing in the graphene micro-/nanocavities in 
the self-excitation regime. The behavior of the amplification coeffi-
cient around the self-excitation regime is shown in Fig. 9.24c. The 
lasing occurs when the plasmon gain balances the electron scat-
tering loss and the radiative loss; see Fig. 9.24c. It means that the 
plasmon oscillations are highly coherent in this case, with virtually 
no dephasing at all. The quasi-Fermi energy corresponding to plas-
monic lasing in the first plasmon resonance is marked by the red 
arrow in Fig. 9.24b.
	
It is worth noting that the plasmons in different graphene 
microcavities oscillate in phase (even without the incoming 
electromagnetic wave) because the metal contacts act as 
synchronizing elements between adjacent graphene microcavities 
(applying a mechanical analogy, one may think of rigid crossbars 
connecting oscillating springs arranged in a chain). Therefore, the 
plasma oscillations in the array of graphene microcavities constitute 
a single collective plasmon mode distributed over the entire area of 
the array, which leads to the enhanced super-radiant electromagnetic 
emission from the array [131]. Notice that extraordinary properties 
of a collective mode in an array of synchronized oscillators are well 
known in optics: the power of electromagnetic emission from such 
an array grows as the square of the number of the oscillators in the 
array [137].

It is important to stress that the giant amplification enhancement 
at the plasmon resonance is ensured by strong confinement of 
the plasmons in the graphene microcavities; see Fig. 9.24c. As 
mentioned above, an elevated gain in graphene (approaching the 
negative of the plasmon radiative damping) is required to meet the 
self-excitation condition. However, the elevated gain would lead 
to strong dephasing of a plasma wave over quite a long distance 
of its propagation (which corresponds to nonresonant stimulated 
generation of plasmons [76, 87]). Therefore, strong plasmon-
mode confinement in a single-mode plasmonic cavity is required to 
ensure the resonant stimulated generation of plasmons. Plasmon 
confinement to a single-mode microcavity also enhances the rate of 
spontaneous electromagnetic emission by the plasmon mode due 
to the Purcell effect [138]. It is expected that the confinement of 
plasmons in 2D graphene microcavities (arranged in a chessboard 
array) could enhance the amplification even more.
9.6  Summary
Recent advances in emission and detection of THz radiation 
using 2D plasmons in semiconductor nanoheterostructures for 
nondestructive evaluations were described. The Doppler-shift effect 
of the plasma-wave velocity under an asymmetric plasmon cavity 
boundary and/or the spatial modulation of electron transit time in 
a submicrometer scale 2D plasmon system with a nonuniform 2D 
electron density distribution can promote the plasmon instability, 
resulting in self-oscillation of plasmons in the THz regime. The 
hydrodynamic nonlinearity of 2D plasmons can rectify the incoming 
electromagnetic radiation, resulting in photovoltaic detection of THz 
radiation under an asymmetric 2D plasmon cavity boundary. The 
device structure that can provide practical emission and detection 
performances were addressed, which are based on an HEMT and 
incorporates an asymmetrically interdigitated DGG structure. 
Excellent THz emission and detection performances, including 
coherent, monochromatic emission beyond the 1 THz range and 
the record detection responsivity of 2.2 kV/W at 1 THz at 300 K, 
were experimentally demonstrated by using InAlAs/InGaAs/InP 
heterostructure material systems. Finally their applications to 

263
nondestructive material evaluation based on THz imaging were 
demonstrated. Obtained results encourage us to proceed to further 
industrialization of these plasmonic THz devices.
	
Ultrafast carrier relaxation and recombination dynamics of 
relativistic Dirac fermions in gapless linear band structures of 
optically or electrically pumped graphene give rise to negative 
dynamic conductivity in a wide THz range. This will open a new 
paradigm to create solid-state THz emitters and lasers using 
graphene. 2D plasmons in graphene dramatically enhance the light–
matter interaction, improving the quantum efficiency and hence 
leading to higher output power. Graphene ribbon arrays coupled 
with metallic grating can extensively promote the cooperative 
excitation of plasmon resonances at the mode frequencies, resulting 
in superradiant THz emission of a lasing operation. Numerical 
simulation reveals the new physics in graphene–metal ribbon 
arrays. It is shown that due to strong confinement of the plasmon 
modes in graphene microcavities and the super-radiant nature 
of electromagnetic emission from the array of the plasmonic 
microcavities, amplification of the THz wave is enhanced by several 
orders of magnitude at the plasmon resonance frequencies. The 
simulated gain coefficient exceeds 104 cm–1 in a wide THz range, 
which is now under test device fabrication. To this end we have two 
possibilities of stimulated emission of THz “photons” and “plasmons.” 
These new findings can lead to the creation of new types of room-
temperature-operating graphene-based intense THz emitters and 
lasers.
	
Nonlinear graphene plasmon dynamics can further extend the 
functionality from simple THz emission. Mikhailov and Ziegler 
have theoretically shown that Dirac fermions in graphene with 
linear dispersion in the presence of an applied AC electric field 
with an angular frequency ω produce an AC current of not only 
the original fundamental frequency mode but also odd harmonic 
modes with angular frequencies nω and magnitudes 1/n as large 
as the fundamental one (where n is a series of harmonic odd 
numbers), even within the linear response without any saturation 
due to the Pauli blocking [139, 140]. This should be contrasted 
with conventional semiconductors such as GaAs, which, within the 
linear response, will only produce an AC current with the original 
frequency component. Therefore, the dynamics of graphene in an

AC electric field are intrinsically nonlinear, and efficient frequency 
multiplications for THz generation substantially outperforming any 
existing materials can be expected for microwave-driven graphene.

Electromagnetic 
metamaterials 
are 
artificially 
constructed 
composite media that are composed of subwavelength-scale, periodic 
metallodielectric structures. They have emerged recently as a very 
promising platform for the manipulation of electromagnetic waves, 
such as microwaves and terahertz (THz) waves. To date, various 
exotic phenomena have been demonstrated experimentally as a 
result of the benefits derived from well-developed, microfabrication 
techniques. For example, negative indices of refraction as well as 
ultrahigh refractive indices, both of which are generally unattainable 
in nature, have been achieved successfully in the THz frequency 
regime with so-called THz metamaterials. Moreover, active control 
of THz waves, which is regarded as one of the most challenging 
issues in the field of THz science and technologies, can now be 
accomplished using THz metamaterials coupled with various active

negative indices of refraction, can be accessible by using THz 
metamaterials [12, 13]. THz metamaterials may be useful in the 
development of THz imaging systems with resolutions beyond the 
diffraction limit and the development of perfect THz absorbers, to 
name a few. In addition, THz metamaterials may be utilized further 
for active devices to manipulate THz waves, such as switches, 
modulators, and memory devices. 
10.3  Fabrication of THz Metamaterials
Since metamaterials are composed of subwavelength-scale meta-
atoms, suitable fabrication methods are required depending on the 
operating frequencies. In the THz regime, the wavelength is about

and thus, a single unit cell should be in the microscale size to satisfy 
the homogenization condition. To pattern such micrometer-sized 
structures, various fabrication methods have been used. 
	
The

methods

to

THz 
metamaterials are the technology used to fabricate conventional 
integrated circuits (ICs) and microelectromechanical system 
(MEMS) processes. Typically, meta-atoms are made of metals and 
dielectrics, and their host medium is chosen selectively from solid-

intended purpose. These methods are based on photolithography, 
and they are more appropriate for use in creating 2D, planar, THz 
metamaterials. Although three-dimensional metamaterials can 
be made by multistacking [16, 17] or rolling-up 2D layers [18,

using conventional photolithography. Recently, nonconventional, 
microfabrication methods have been used to create more complex 
3D THz metamaterials [20]. The representative microfabrication 
methods for genuine 3D structures are listed below: 
	
	 Direct laser writing [21, 22] 
	
	 X-ray lithography (e.g., LIGA process) [23, 24] 
	
	 Femtosecond laser microlens array (fs-MLA) lithography [17, 
25] 
	
	 Multilayer electroplating (MLEP) [26–28]

materials, depending on the controllability of the electromagnetic 
properties, such as resonance frequency, amplitude/phase in

case of passive-type metamaterials, the electromagnetic properties 
cannot be altered by additional stimuli once the metamaterials are 
fabricated. Conversely, the properties of active-type metamaterials, 
in which various active media generally are embedded, can be

refractive indices at microwave frequencies by Shelby, Smith, and 
Schultz [7], the same kind of approach has been used to realize 
artificial negative refractive indices for higher frequency ranges, 
such as the THz to IR regime. Realizing such negative refractive 
indices would show promise for various applications, including 
super-resolution imaging. 
	
Second, the principles used to design THz metamaterials that 
have high refractive indices are presented. Such metamaterials 
have the potential to extend the positive limit of the refractive index 
in various frequency ranges. For the THz regime, Choi et al. [16]

high refractive index.
10.4.1  Metamaterials with Negative Refractive Indices
A question for the existence of a material that has a negative refractive 
index was raised by Victor Veselago in the late 1960s [32]. He 
introduced a simple plot of the materials’ effective parameter called 
the “epsilon–mu table” to classify the electromagnetic response 
of materials (Fig. 10.3). According to Maxwell’s equations, the 
refractive index of a material ©≥ §•ϐ©Æ•§ °≥   , the sign of which

depends on the signs of  and . Veselago predicted that a negative 
value of  ∑Øµ¨§ ¢• •∏∞•£¥•§ ©¶ ØÆ• £Øµ¨§ ϐ©Æ§ ≠°ßÆ•¥©£ ≠ØÆØ∞Ø¨•≥ 
in natural materials, providing the basis for the existence of negative 
refractive indices. Although he knew that identifying conditions in 
which materials had negative refractive indices would be physically 
meaningful work, unfortunately, the magnetic monopoles have yet

or permeability was proposed theoretically by Sir John Pendry et al. 
[3, 4]. By constructing metallic wire arrays with a subwavelength-
scale lattice constant, the effective plasma frequency, which 
determines the range of negative permittivity, could be decreased 
to microwave frequencies (as was introduced in Section 10.2.1). 
Similarly, negative permeability was observed near the resonance 
frequency using split-rings resonators (SRRs), that is, so-called 
magnetic meta-atoms. 
	
A year later, Smith et al. developed the clever idea of combining 
two different meta-atoms into a single metamolecule to make a 
composite medium that simultaneously had negative permittivity 
and negative permeability [33]. As shown in Fig. 10.4, this composite 
medium had overlapping frequency regions of negative permittivity

the composite metamolecule at microwave frequency [7] with 
copper SRRs and wires on a circuit board. By conducting a Snell’s

to rethink their understanding of the propagation of waves in matter, 
and the metamaterial with a negative refractive index opened up 
new frontiers in photonics with many interesting physical concepts.

In the early stages of developing THz metamaterials, efforts 
were devoted to achieving strong magnetic responses [34] in order 
to extend the frequency ranges for the negative refractive index. 
Similar to microwave metamaterials, the development of materials 
with negative refractive indices at THz frequencies was achieved 
by overlapping the frequency ranges of negative permittivity with 
those of negative permeability. For this purpose, a combined array of 
SRRs and thin metallic wires was patterned onto a dielectric, planar 
substrate using microfabrication methods [12, 22]. Unfortunately, 
the negative refraction through this structure was valid only in the in-

from conventional photolithography. More recently, negative 
refractive indices were demonstrated with THz waves propagating 
in the direction normal to the substrate plane utilizing different unit

10.4.3  Ultrahigh-Refractive-Index Metamaterial
The development of a positive, high refractive index would broaden 
the research field of metamaterials (Fig. 10.5). For example, a high 
index would provide better light-bending power and more design

Passive-Type THz Metamaterials
	
By stacking metasurface layers, Choi et al. circumvented this 
difficulty in fabrication and experimentally proposed a feasible 
high-index structure for quasi-3D THz metamaterials [16]. Each 
layer was composed of an array of thin, I-shaped, gold meta-atoms 
that were patterned within a highly flexible polyimide substrate. The 
fabricated metamaterials exhibited a very high refractive index for 
broadband THz frequency ranges. By significantly increasing the 
effective permittivity through strong capacitive coupling between 
the meta-atoms, while maintaining effective permeability around/
near unity by minimizing the volume fraction of the metal, a peak 
refractive index of 38.6 was demonstrated experimentally for a 
single-layer THz metamaterial (Fig. 10.6). As a natural extension 
of this single-layer metamaterial, quasi-3D, high-refractive-index 
metamaterials also were fabricated, and a maximum bulk refractive 
index of 33.2 was obtained.

10.5  Active-Type THz Metamaterials
Active control of electromagnetic waves is at the heart of modern 
electronics and photonics. During the last few years, active-type THz 
metamaterials have been studied intensively for the manipulation 
of THz waves. While most natural materials have a very weak 
response to THz waves, engineered metamaterials, when combined 
with active, natural materials, are able to control THz waves more 
effectively due to their strong electromagnetic resonances. Recently, 
the importance of active THz metamaterials has been highlighted

three distinct categories, that is, optically tunable metamaterials, 
electrically tunable metamaterials, and mechanically tunable 
metamaterials, according to the methods that are used to tune the 
electromagnetic properties. 
10.5.1  Optically Tunable THz Metamaterials
In 2005, Janke et al. fabricated a 2D, indium antimonide (InSb) 
grating with square apertures and demonstrated all-optical 
switching of the transmitted THz waves by controlling photoexcited 
carriers in the semiconductor [43]. Two years later, Hendry et al. 
expanded this work to show ultrafast optical switching of the THz 
response, such as extraordinary transmission using subwavelength 
metallic apertures patterned onto a silicon substrate [44]. Noting 
the fact that semiconductors can be used as suitable active-
tuning media for THz waves, especially when combined with 
subwavelength metallic structures, researchers started to integrate 
specially designed metamolecules with a semiconductor material. In 
2006, Padilla et al. demonstrated that the electromagnetic response 
of THz metamaterials can be controlled dynamically by an optical 
pump [45]. In their experiment, metallic SRRs were patterned on a 
semi-insulating gallium arsenide (SI-GaAs) substrate, and optical-
pump THz-probe spectroscopy was used to characterize the pump-
induced THz responses of the metamaterial. As shown in Fig. 10.7, 
the real part of permittivity changed noticeably with optical pulse 

291
excitation. Without the optical pump, strong resonances of SRRs 
∑•≤• £¨•°≤¨π Ø¢≥•≤∂•§Ǥ (Ø∑•∂•≤ǡ ∑©¥® ©Æ£≤•°≥•§ ∞µ≠∞ ϐ¨µ•Æ£•ǡ ¥®• 
resonance strength of SRRs was weakened due to the photoexcited 
carriers in SI-GaAs.

GaAs substrate. Reproduced form Ref. [45] by permission of

In addition to controlling the resonance strength of metamaterials, 
shifting of the resonance frequency was demonstrated with a 
different kind of active metamaterials in which a part of the meta-
atom was made of the active semiconductor [46]. Small capacitor 
plates in the center part of a meta-atom were made of silicon, and 
these composite meta-atom structures were placed on a quartz 
substrate. With optical pump excitation, the effective capacitance of 
the meta-atoms was increased by the photoexcited carriers in the 
Active-Type THz Metamaterials

silicon. As a result, the resonance frequency was shifted gradually to 
lower frequencies as the pump fluence increased. 
	
Utilizing the change in the conductivity of semiconductors under 
photoexcitation, chirality switching was reported recently [47]. 
Zhang et al. demonstrated strong rotatory power of the polarization 
angle and controlled its ellipticity with optical pulse excitation. 
Similarly, the negative index from the THz chiral metamaterials was 
controlled by the same method [48]. Optically tunable metamaterials 
have great potential for use in ultrafast modulation of THz waves 
when they are combined with semiconductor materials that possess 
short electron–hole recombination times. An ErAs/GaAs nanoisland 
superlattice [49] or graphene [50] could be a promising candidate 
for the semiconducting materials for this purpose because the 
recombination time of photoexcited carriers for these materials 
typically is of the order of a few picoseconds. 
10.5.2  Electrically Tunable THz Metamaterials
Although optically tunable THz metamaterials have been 
demonstrated to be a quite versatile platform for the ultrafast 
control of THz waves, as described in the previous section, a more 
practical method is required for the realistic implementation of 
THz devices. Electrical tuning may be a promising alternative to 
optical control. Series of electrically tunable THz metamaterials

manipulation of THz waves, such as amplitude [51], phase [52], 
and spatial modulation [53]. As shown in Fig. 10.8a, these devices 
are based on the hybrid structure of the n-GaAs/metamaterial in 
which a Schottky junction is formed at the interface. By applying a 
bias voltage between metallic meta-atoms and the substrate, charge 
carriers are depleted near the split gap, which causes a change in 
the resonance strength. Therefore, the amplitude and phase of the 
transmitted THz waves can be controlled effectively by the bias 
voltage. In the modulation scheme that utilizes carrier depletion, 
the speed of modulation generally depends on the mobility of the 
carrier. Therefore, to increase the modulation speed, high-electron-
mobility transistors (HEMTs) with an embedded 2DEG layer were 
tested. For this metamaterial, modulation speeds up to 10 MHz were 
achieved [54].

Another type of electrically tunable THz metamaterials, which 
used single-layer graphene as the active medium, was reported 
recently by Lee et al. [55]. A graphene/metamaterial hybrid structure

with a “THz” transparent gate electrode (Fig. 10.8b). Unlike near-
IR and visible light, THz waves are absorbed in the graphene layer 
via intraband transition. In their device, the Fermi level of graphene 
(and the degree of intraband transition) was controlled by electrical 
gating. To increase the modulation depth, hexagonally shaped meta-
atoms, which were strongly resonant at THz frequencies, were placed 
directly onto the graphene layer. With this approach, amplitude and

by electrical gating. More interestingly, the device showed hysteretic 
behavior in the THz transmission for a cyclic variation of gate voltage, 
and this hysteretic behavior was utilized for the demonstration of 
electrically controlled, photonic memory operation. 
10.5.3  Mechanically Tunable THz Metamaterials
The electromagnetic response of metamaterials was determined 
mainly by the structural shapes of the basic building blocks, that is, 
the meta-atoms. Accordingly, THz wave modulation can be achieved 
by modifying the structural shape directly or by arranging the meta-

metamaterials at THz frequencies were fabricated using the 
MEMS process [56]. In their work, metallic SRRs were attached 
on a bimaterial microcantilever that can be deflected by a thermal 
stimulus. As a result, a remarkable transmission change was 
observed, which was attributed to the structural deformation of

passive-type and active-type THz metamaterials, there is a possibility 
that THz metadevices will become the next enabling technological 
breakthrough in THz technologies.

Terahertz-Wave Plastic Fibers and Their Application
transmitted through air. THz waveguides proposed and based on this 
concept can be classified, in general, into three types. The first is the 
subwavelength type [5], which is a thin metal or dielectric wire, with 
its diameter much smaller than the wavelength and thus high power 
fraction outside the wire. The second is the hollow type, which is 
essentially an air-core waveguide surrounded by a structured 
cladding and confines most of the power within the air-core region 
[6–11]. The third is the porous type [12, 13], where subwavelength 
air holes are arranged in the core region to reduce material losses.
	
In this chapter, two kinds of plastic waveguides will be introduced 
for THz waveguiding. One is the subwavelength plastic fiber [14], 
and the other is the pipe waveguide [15]. Working principles and 
operating characteristics of these THz plastic waveguides will be 
discussed first. Then, some of their applications, including THz 
directional couplers and THz fiber-scanning imaging systems, will 
be described.
11.2  Terahertz Subwavelength Plastic Fiber
A simple plastic wire with a subwavelength diameter can provide 
low guiding attenuation in a single-mode operation for THz waves 
[14]. The concept of such low-loss waveguiding was previously 
demonstrated at both microwave [16, 17] and optical [18] frequencies. 
In the THz frequency range, we first demonstrated a low-loss plastic 
fiber for THz waveguiding [14]. In our first study, we adopted a 200 
μm diameter polyethylene (PE) wire as the subwavelength THz fiber 
for a frequency near 300 GHz. With a small diameter-to-wavelength 
ratio, a large portion of THz waves was guided outside the lossy core 
such that the attenuation constant is successfully reduced to be of 
the order of 0.001 cm−1, while the measured free-space coupling 
coefficient of the fiber can reach up to the order of or much greater 
than 20%. With direct coupling capability, the subwavelength THz 
fibers can be easily integrated with current THz systems to improve 
flexibility and reliability.
11.2.1  Fractional-Material-Loss-Induced Attenuation 
Constant
To simplify the analysis of a subwavelength THz fiber, we assume 
that the plastic wire, which has the same geometry as an air-

303
cladding fiber, as shown in Fig. 11.1a, has a circular cross section, 
a uniform radius a, and a step-index profile with an inner refractive 
index n1 and an outer refractive index n2. Since air serves as the 
cladding material, we assume that n2 = 1. By solving Maxwell’s 
equations, the mode fields can be analytically expressed. However, 
because of the lack of a nonabsorptive material in the THz regime, 
all the guided modes within the dielectric core will be subject 
to material absorption, and the fiber will be too lossy to compete 
with a metal-based fiber. A straightforward way to improve the 
attenuation is to reduce the fractional power inside the dielectric 
core by using a subwavelength-diameter plastic wire with a small 
diameter-to-wavelength ratio, which will also ensure single-mode 
(HE11) operation as long as

, where λ is the 
wavelength [19]. To calculate the fractional power flow inside the 
core area, one needs to solve Poynting vector Sz in the direction of 
propagation (z direction). Figure 11.1b shows the calculated spatial 
distributions of the normalized Sz of a 200 μm diameter PE wire for 
300, 500, 700, and 900 GHz with n1 = 1.5 [20]. It can be observed 
that the fractional power flowing outside the PE core decreases as 
the frequency of the guided waves increases. One can obtain the 
fractional power η inside the core by

(11.1)
	
The value of η can be used to estimate roughly the effective fiber 
attenuation constant influenced by the core absorption. For a small 
η, which happens when a small-diameter plastic wire is adopted, the 
attenuation constant will approach that of the air cladding, while for 
an η close to 1 the attenuation constant will approximate that of bulk 
PE. To precisely estimate the fiber attenuation caused by material 
absorption, we adopted a perturbation method [16]. It assumes that 
the power loss per wavelength in propagation is small compared 
to the total power flowing along the fiber, which is reasonable for 
a subwavelength plastic wire in the THz regime. Using the method 
simplified with the Poynting theorem [16], we can find the fiber 
attenuation constant α, given by

where τ is an infinite plane perpendicular to the fiber axis and σ is 
the conductivity. For the plastic core, conductivity is a function of 
the refractive index n1 and the absorption constant of the plastic αm, 
which can be expressed as σ = n1cαm/4π, where c is the velocity of 
light in free space. For air cladding, the conductivity approximates 
zero because of its negligible absorption of air. The calculated α as a 
function of electromagnetic frequency is shown as a dashed curve in 
Fig. 11.2, for which it is assumed that αm = 1 cm−1.

where Emode is the guided mode (the HE11 mode) of the subwavelength 
fiber and Einput is the field distribution of the input beam, which is 
usually Gaussian-like. Since the Bessel-function-based HE11 mode 
has a field distribution similar to the Gaussian, theoretically, the free-
space coupling efficiency for the subwavelength plastic fiber could 
be very high (near 100%) as long as the spot size of the input beam is 
properly adjusted to match the mode size of the subwavelength fiber. 
In experiments, we determined the coupling efficiency by measuring 
the ratio of the output-to-input power and then calibrating it with 
the loss caused by the attenuation of the fiber. Figure 11.6 shows 
the measured values for a PE wire with a 600 μm diameter. As 
theoretically predicted, a direct coupling efficiency as high as 95% 
was experimentally achieved for the THz subwavelength plastic 
fibers.

11.2.4  Subwavelength Hollow-Core Fiber
Due to its low attenuation constant, the subwavelength single-
mode fiber shows a promising prospect in an evanescent-wave-

311
based THz fiber-sensing application. It is because the large 
portion of the evanescent wave outside the fiber can provide great 
sensitivity. However, in some aspects, a hollow waveguide may be 
more convenient than a solid wire, such as gas or liquid molecular 
sensing. Therefore, here we also show a subwavelength hollow-core 
PE fiber with an outer diameter of 600 m and an inner diameter 
of 280 m [24]. In our experiment, three different fiber lengths, 8.6 
cm, 11.5 cm, and 14 cm, were chosen. We measured the frequency 
dependence of power transmission for the three lengths. The fiber 
attenuation constants calculated from the measured data are shown 
in Fig. 11.7 with a similar but higher value compared to that of the 
solid-core fiber shown in Fig. 11.2.

core PE fiber. Reproduced from Ref. [24] by permission of 
SPIE, © 2006. 
	
In the preliminary experiment for subwavelength hollow-core 
fibers, it was demonstrated that a plastic tube can successfully guide 
the THz wave with an attenuation constant of the order of 0.01 
cm−1 for a frequency around 300 GHz. Note that the guided mode 
of this subwavelength hollow-core fiber is similar to the solid-core 
case where the subwavelength core yields an extended evanescent 
Terahertz Subwavelength Plastic Fiber

312
Terahertz-Wave Plastic Fibers and Their Application
field, and the hollow-core fiber has a subwavelength cladding, which 
causes the THz wave to extend well outside the lossy cladding and 
thus a lower material-induced loss. However, slightly different from 
the above-mentioned subwavelength solid-core fiber mode, the 
field confinement in the central region (air core and PE cladding) is 
relatively stronger in the subwavelength hollow-core fiber case [25]. 
A detailed comparison between the subwavelength solid-core and 
hollow-core fibers can be found in a later publication [26].
	
Note that there is a second type of hollow-core THz fiber, where a 
subwavelength air hole was also adopted in the core region [27] but 
with thicker cladding. Owing to the effect of low-index discontinuity, 
THz power is tightly confined in the air hole to reduce the material 
loss. The operation principle of porous fibers [12, 13] with more 
subwavelength air holes arranged in the dielectric core is similar to 
that of this second type one-subwavelength-air-hole THz fiber [27].
11.3  Terahertz Pipe Waveguides
In this section, we introduce another plastic waveguide, a pipe 
waveguide, for THz wave transmission [15, 28]. Much different from 
all previously reported air-core THz waveguides, which bear high 
reflection materials [6–9] or periodic structures [10, 11] to provide 
high cladding reflection, the structure of a THz pipe waveguide is 
very simple, and it is only a thin pipe consisting of a large air core 
(with a diameter greater than the wavelength) and a thin dielectric 
layer (with a thickness much smaller than the core diameter) 
with a uniform but low index. The guiding mechanism of a pipe 
waveguide is similar to that of an antiresonant reflecting optical 
waveguide (ARROW) [29], which is mostly in planar and solid-core 
form with multiple cladding layers, but is realized here with a single 
dielectric layer. Compared to other ARROW-like circular air-core 
THz waveguides [7, 11], our study indicates that a single dielectric 
layer can achieve excellent THz mode confinement without the 
need of multiple-layered periodic structures [11] or high-reflection 
metallic coatings [7]. Using commercially available Teflon air pipes 
up to 3 m long, it was experimentally confirmed that THz waves can 
be successfully guided in the central air core with excellent mode 
qualities, high coupling efficiency (as high as 80%), and controllable

bandwidth, while the measured attenuation constants can be as low 
as 0.0008 cm–1 [15].
11.3.1  Guiding Mechanism of the Core Modes
A transverse cross section of a THz pipe waveguide is shown in Fig. 
11.8a. It has a large air core (n1 = 1) with diameter D and a thin layer 
of cladding with thickness t. The medium outside the cladding is also 
air. The material of the cladding is assumed to be a dielectric with a 
uniform low refractive index n2.

(b) The cladding can be viewed as a Fabry–Pérot etalon.
	
The pipe waveguide supports cladding modes for which fields 
are confined within the cladding region. These modes are guided 
on the basis of the total internal reflection (TIR) owing to the 
higher refractive index of the cladding. However, the cladding 
modes attenuate rapidly since high material absorption losses are 
encountered. Alternatively, the pipe waveguide also supports core 
modes with fields confined in the air-core region. As the refractive 
index of the core is less than that of the cladding, fields of the core 
modes will oscillate and radiate through the cladding, making the 
core modes leaky. However, as the core modes suffer less material 
absorption losses than the cladding modes, they are the dominant 
modes. Here, only the core modes are investigated.
	
The guiding mechanism of the core modes in a THz pipe waveguide 
is similar to that of ARROWs [29]. The mechanism can be briefly 
described by viewing the cladding of the pipe waveguide as a Fabry–

314
Terahertz-Wave Plastic Fibers and Their Application
Pérot etalon, as shown in Fig. 11.8b, where θ1 and θ2 are angles of 
inclined wave vectors with respect to the interface normal in media 
1 and 2, respectively. It is well known that a Fabry–Pérot etalon 
behaves like a resonator [30]. Its transmission spectrum is periodic, 
and narrow peaks corresponding to transmission maximums occur 
at the frequencies at which the etalon resonates. That is to say, at or 
near the frequencies at which the cladding of a THz pipe waveguide 
is resonant, nearly no reflection takes place at the core-cladding 
interface and thus fields could hardly exist inside the core region. On 
the other hand, under the antiresonant conditions of the cladding, 
that is, at frequencies away from the resonant ones, considerable 
reflections occurring at the core-cladding interface cause the core 
modes to appear, resulting from the fact that waves bounce back and 
forth inside the core region.

Equation 11.6 can be used to predict the frequencies at or near 
which the core modes of the pipe waveguide do not exist.
11.3.2  Attenuation Constant of the Fundamental Mode
In the following section, modal characteristics of the pipe waveguide 
are first examined numerically over the frequency range from 200 
GHz to 900 GHz. Numerical simulations are performed by a full-
vectorial finite-difference frequency domain (FDFD) mode solver 
[31]. If not particularly specified, we assume the parameters of the 
pipe waveguide as core diameter D = 9 mm, cladding thickness t = 
0.5 mm, and cladding refractive index n2 = 1.4 (Teflon). 
	
Figure 11.9 shows the simulated attenuations of the fundamental 
mode. To investigate the dependences of the attenuation constant 
on D, t, and n2, simulations of respective variations are shown in 

315
Fig. 11.9a–c. We first examine the effect of the core diameter, and 
the calculated results are shown in Fig. 11.9a. Like the Fabry–Pérot 
etalon, periodic passbands are clearly shown. It is observed that 
there are discontinuities in Fig. 11.9a. At these frequencies, no core 
modes can be found by the mode solver. Substituting m = 1 and 2 in 
Eq. 11.6, the obtained resonant frequencies are 306 GHz and 612 
GHz, respectively, which coincide with the discontinuity frequencies 
in Fig. 11.9a. In fact, the discontinuities correspond to the resonance 
conditions of the cladding under which core modes of the pipe 
waveguide do not exist. From Fig. 11.9a, obviously, the attenuation 
constant decreases as D increases. That is to say, pipe waveguides 
with a larger core diameter suffer less waveguide losses. We further 
plot the attenuation constant as a function of D in Fig. 11.9d, and the 
log–log plots shown in the inset reveal that the attenuation constant 
is proportional to 1/D4, different from the 1/D3 dependence for the 
hollow dielectric waveguides with an infinite cladding [32].

cladding, n2. (d) Attenuation constant as a function of D. Inset:

Next, we increase the cladding thickness from t = 0.5 mm to t = 
1.0 mm. It is found the discontinuity frequencies, which are relevant 
Terahertz Pipe Waveguides

316
Terahertz-Wave Plastic Fibers and Their Application
to the cladding resonant frequencies, depend significantly on the 
thickness of the cladding. As can be observed in Fig. 11.9b, when 
the thickness doubles, the period of the discontinuity frequency 
becomes one-half. This phenomenon complies with what can be 
deduced from Eq. 11.6. In addition, the cladding resonant frequencies 
for t = 1.0 mm derived from Eq. 11.6 with m = 2, 3, 4, and 5 are 
306 GHz, 459 GHz, 612 GHz, and 765 GHz, respectively, which also 
coincide with the discontinuity frequencies shown in Fig. 11.9b. If 
the bandwidth of the passband is approximated as the period of the 
resonant frequencies of the cladding, from Fig. 11.9b, it is clear that 
when t doubles, the passband width reduces to one-half, indicating 
that the passband width is proportional to 1/t. Moreover, from Fig. 
11.9c, the passband width decreases if n2 increases.
	
From Fig. 11.9, it is found that discontinuity frequencies of the pipe 
waveguide are independent of the core diameter and are inversely 
proportional to the cladding thickness. These characteristics agree 
with those of the cladding resonant frequencies, as described by 
Eq. 11.6. Moreover, values of the discontinuity frequencies coincide 
with those obtained from Eq. 11.6. Therefore, we can conclude 
that the discontinuity frequencies are exactly the same as the 
resonant frequencies of the cladding, and hence confirm the guiding 
mechanism of the pipe waveguide to be antiresonant reflecting 
guiding.
	
Generally speaking, for a THz pipe waveguide to be low loss, 
larger air core is preferred, while to possess a high passband width, 
a thin cladding layer and a low-index material are more favorable 
[15, 28, 33].
11.3.3  Characteristics of Higher-Order Modes
A THz pipe waveguide is a multimode waveguide. The first four 
lowest-order modes (HE11, TM01, HE21, and TE01) of a pipe waveguide 
are solved at a frequency of 380 GHz. Modal intensity distributions 
and electric field vector distributions of these modes are shown in 
Fig. 11.10a and Fig. 11.10b, respectively. Calculated attenuation 
constants of the fundamental mode (HE11) and the three higher-order 
modes (TM01, HE21, and TE01) are shown in Fig. 11.10c. It is clear 
that basic characteristics of the higher-order modes are the same 
as those of the fundamental mode, including the same discontinuity

frequencies. Moreover, compared with the higher-order modes, the 
HE11 mode has the smallest attenuation constant and thus is the 
dominant mode for the pipe waveguide investigated here.
11.3.4  Performances of THz Pipe Waveguides
Previous discussions assume that the refractive index of the cladding 
is real. In other words, material absorption is not considered. Here, the 
effect of material absorption is examined by assuming the refractive 
index of the cladding is n2 = 1.4 – 0.0015j. From the calculated 
attenuation constants shown in Fig. 11.11a, it is clear that the effect 
of material absorption is not obvious in the lower frequency region. 
However, as the frequency increases, the attenuation constant is 
getting affected owing to the gradual dominance of the material 
loss over the waveguide loss. Several commercially available thin 
pipes made of various materials had been experimentally tested 
for THz waveguiding. It was found that pipes of acrylic glass 
(polymethylmethacrylate, PMMA), Teflon (water and air pipes), 
polypropylene (straw pipes used for drinking), and glass are all 
capable of delivering terahertz waves, and the measured attenuation 
loss for the Teflon pipe was the lowest owing to its lowest material 
absorption.
	
The effect of environmental variation is examined by changing 
the refractive index of the outside region surrounding the cladding. 
It is taken to be 1 in all previous discussions and denoted here as 
n1o. Note that the refractive index of the inside core is still assumed 
to be 1. Calculated results shown in Fig. 11.11b indicate that the 
attenuation constant is highly sensitive to the variation of the 
outside environment. Even only a 1% increase of n1o (from 1 to 1.01) 
would yield a significant increment to the attenuation constant. 
Such sensitivity would make the pipe waveguide ideal for sensing 
applications.
	
For practical applications, THz power emitted from the source is 
usually butt-coupled into the pipe waveguide directly. By assuming 
that the field distribution of the source is Gaussian-like, Fig. 11.11c 
shows coupling efficiencies calculated according to Eq. 11.4 as a 
function of the beam waist 2w0 for different frequencies, where D is 
assumed to be 9 mm. It is clear the coupling efficiency can be easily 
over 90% if a proper beam waist is applied.

Terahertz-Wave Plastic Fibers and Their Application
	
To demonstrate the structure of THz waveguiding, commercially 
available Teflon air pipes were used for THz wave transmission. The 
measured refractive index of Teflon is dispersive with an average 
value of 1.4. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 11.12a. The 
intensity distributions of the output waves were measured using a 
metallic pinhole after a 3 m long Teflon pipe with D = 9 mm and  
t = 0.5 mm. Measured distributions at 356 GHz and 455 GHz, shown 
in Fig.11.12b, indicated that the THz waves were indeed guided 
inside the air-core region with an excellent mode quality over a 
wide frequency range. The intensity distributions resemble that 
of the fundamental mode (the HE11 mode) shown in Fig. 11.10, 
which also implies that higher-order modes were absent after such 
a propagation distance. The attenuation constants of Teflon pipes 
were measured for pipes with the same diameter, D = 9 mm, but 
different thicknesses, t = 0.5 and t = 1 mm. Experimental results 
shown in Fig. 11.12c display the same trend as the simulated ones 
shown in Fig. 11.9b. For example, the measured passband-width 
for t = 0.5 mm is about twice that of t = 1 mm. Note that for t = 0.5 
mm, the passband width is relatively broad with at least 200 GHz. 
Moreover, low attenuation constants were obtained of the order of 
or lower than 0.005 cm–1, and the lowest value measured was (7.85 
± 0.05)  10 –4 cm–1. Coupling efficiencies from the source to the 
pipe waveguide were also measured, and a maximum of 84% was 
obtained for t = 0.5 mm. It has been experimentally demonstrated 
that high butt-coupling efficiency (near 100%) between pipe 
waveguides with different shapes of cross section, for example, from 
a circular pipe waveguide to a square one, can be achieved as well if 
the two waveguides are with the same air-core sizes [34].
	
Compared with the simulated spectra, a slight shift of the 
cladding-resonant frequencies can be observed for the measured 
results. This is unavoidable due to cladding-thickness variations in 
the commercial Teflon pipes. Cladding-thickness was found to be 
0.49–0.56 mm for t = 0.5 mm and 0.93–1.13 mm for t = 1 mm. Hence, 
the frequency mismatch could be partially attributed to the non-

t = 0.5 and t = 0.55 mm are assumed for simulation. Other discrepancy 
source includes the frequency-dependent cladding refractive index.

Since the resonant frequency is an important feature of the pipe 
waveguides, it is further verified using PMMA pipes with better 
cladding uniformity by measuring the transmission spectra through 
the standard THz time domain spectroscopy [35]. Normalized 
transmission spectra of PMMA pipes with two different sizes, one 
with D = 8 mm and t = 1 mm and the other with D = 4 mm and t 
= 2 mm, are shown in Fig. 11.13a and Fig. 11.13b, respectively. 
Resonant frequencies of the cladding obtained from Eq. 11.6 are 
also shown for comparison. Theoretically, transmissions at the 
resonant frequencies are expected to drop because there are no core 
modes existing to deliver THz powers. It is clear in Fig. 11.13 that 
the transmission minima and resonant frequencies match very well, 
indicating that the guiding mechanism of the pipe waveguides is 
indeed that of antiresonant reflecting guiding. 
	
Before leaving this section, modal profiles of the HE11 modes 
for the Teflon pipe waveguide and the subwavelength PE fiber are 
numerically compared at 200 GHz and 400 GHz. The results with 
x polarization are shown in Fig. 11.14. For the pipe waveguide,

loss from the HE11 mode field to the field of the linear combination of 
the two system modes would become more and more significant [43]. 
As a result, the modal excitation loss may exceed the propagation 
loss and become the dominant loss factor for the subwavelength 
directional coupler. Furthermore, when the core separation is 
eventually too small, for example, the fibers touch each other (s = d), 
the odd mode may encounter cutoff and thus cannot be guided in the 
coupler [44]. Under the cutoff condition, the THz power is unable to 
switch back and forth.
	
In one experiment, the core diameter d of the PE fibers is 300 
μm. The measured attenuation constant α for a single PE fiber at 324 
GHz was 0.008 cm–1. We first conducted the length-of-the-coupler-
region (ℓ)-dependent measurement with a fixed core separation s 
to investigate the power switching between the two subwavelength 
fibers. Numerical simulations are also presented, which were 
performed by the FDFD mode solver. Figure 11.16 shows both 
measured and simulated results of (Pout/Pin)eαℓ as a function of 
ℓ with the core separation s = 2 mm. The oscillatory behavior of 
power transfer between the two fibers can be clearly observed. The 
maximum (Pout/Pin)eαℓ is close to 100%, which indicates that the 
modal excitation loss is negligible. We can observe that the coupling 
length Lc is about 9 cm when s is 2 mm.

The core separation s was then varied from 1.17 mm to 2.55 mm 
(odd-mode cutoff occurs when s < 1.1 mm). Figure 11.17 shows both 
measured and simulated coupling lengths Lc as a function of s, and 
the results are close to each other. With a smaller s, Lc is shorter, 
owing to more field overlap between the two fibers. The measured 
shortest coupling length Lc is 2.8 cm (30λ) when s is 1.17 mm. Note 
that such a short coupling length, in terms of wavelength, is hard to 
achieve in the optical domain.

We then investigated the insertion loss of this subwavelength 
directional coupler. The values of Pout/Pin as a function of core 
separation are shown as red open circles in Fig. 11.18a, where Pout 
was measured at the corresponding coupling length Lc. According 
to Fig. 11.14, Lc varies with s. From Fig. 11.18a, we can observe that 
the maximum Pout/Pin value is between s = 1.4 mm and s = 1.8 mm. 
We then use the term exp(–αLc) to estimate the propagation loss 
of the coupler, where α = 0.008 cm–1 is the measured attenuation 
constant of a single subwavelength PE fiber. To compare the values 
of the measured Pout/Pin and the propagation loss, that is, exp(–αLc), 
we plot the results together in Fig. 11.18a, and the propagation loss

is shown as blue open triangles. It can be found that when 1.7 mm 
< s < 2.55 mm, the Pout/Pin and the propagation loss agree with each 
other, meaning that the propagation loss is the dominant loss factor 
and the modal excitation loss can be neglected. The trend of Pout/
Pin decreases with increased core separation. With 1.17 mm < s < 
1.7 mm, Pout/Pin becomes less than the propagation loss, a clear 
indication for the existence of the modal excitation loss [43]. We then 
calculate the insertion loss with the definition of 10 log10(Pin/Pout). 
The measured and simulated insertion losses as a function of core 
separation are shown in Fig. 11.18b. Experimentally, an insertion 
loss of less than 0.3 dB can be achieved.

As stated previously, when the core separation is too small, the 
odd mode may encounter cutoff [44]. Previously we demonstrated 
this phenomenon by placing two identical PE fibers touching 
together. The core diameter of the PE fibers was 210 μm, and the 
working frequency was 304 GHz. Numerical simulation indicates 
that the odd mode is cut off below 715 GHz. Under the odd-mode 
cutoff, only the even mode exists. Hence it is expected that the power 
in each fiber will be equal and the power transfer ratio, defined as 
P2/(P1 + P2) where P1 and P2 are the powers of the input and coupled 
fibers, will be 50% and independent of the length of the coupler 
region ℓ. Figure 11.19 shows the measured power transfer ratio as 
a function of ℓ. It is clear that the measured result agrees with the 

329
theoretical expectation and the phenomenon of odd-mode cutoff is 
thus evidenced.

11.4.1.2  THz couplers with pipe waveguides
After describing the subwavelength-fiber-based THz directional 
couplers, here we introduce couplers formed with THz pipe 
waveguides. For the convenience of discussion, we start with 
studying the directional coupler, which is composed of two slab-type 
hollow waveguides [41]. The structure is shown in Fig. 11.20, where 
two identical slab-type hollow waveguides are placed touching each 
other. The slab-type hollow waveguides can be treated as the 1D 
version of the pipe waveguide with the air core sandwiched by two 
thin dielectric cladding slabs. For each hollow waveguide, we assume 
the core width w = 5 mm, the cladding thickness t = 0.5 mm, and the 
refractive indices n2 = 1.4 and n1 = 1 (air). Antiresonant frequencies, 
which are midway between two adjacent resonant frequencies for 
a single hollow waveguide, can be obtained from Eq. 11.6. For the 
parameters assumed here, antiresonant frequencies of the first 
three passbands are 153.1, 459.3, and 765.5 GHz, respectively. In the 
following section, only the transverse electric (TE) polarization is 
considered.

A Gaussian beam of unity power with beam waist 2w0= 3.6 mm is 
launched into the input end of hollow waveguide 1. Power evolution 
along the propagation distance z is simulated by using the finite-
difference beam propagation method (BPM) [45]. When calculating 
the powers of each waveguide, P1 and P2, only the amount in the 
air core region is counted. We first observe the result calculated 
at 540 GHz, which is a common frequency between resonant and 
antiresonant frequencies. The result is shown in Fig. 11.21a. Clearly, 
owing to the leaky nature of the hollow waveguides, the total power 
P1 + P2 attenuates with the distance. The attenuation constant of the 
coupler is very low, and it can be estimated from the log plot of the 
total power (not shown here), which is 1.5 × 10−3 cm−1 in this case, 
about the same magnitude as that of a single hollow waveguide. If 
the coupling length Lc is defined as the distance at which P2 obtains 
the maximum power, from Fig. 11.21a, Lc = 244.6 cm at 540 GHz, 
which is equivalent to 4400 wavelengths. Next, we examine the 
result calculated at 460 GHz, which is very close to the antiresonant 
frequency 459.3 GHz, and the result is shown in Fig. 11.21b. It can 
be seen that the power transfer between the hollow waveguides 
occurs much more rapidly and Lc reduces dramatically to 16.8 cm, 
equivalent to only 258 wavelengths, while the attenuation constant 
is almost the same; it is 1.1 × 10−3 cm−1.
	
To further investigate the coupling characteristics of the 
directional coupler, modal analysis was conducted by using the FDFD 
mode solver. We still checked the results calculated at 540 GHz first. 
It is found that the field profiles in the air-core region of the even and 
odd system modes are both Gaussian-like. Hence, it is expected that 
both system modes would be equally excited by the Gaussian input,

image has good contrast and a high signal-to-noise ratio (>800) with 
a 210 μm effective spatial resolution (<λ/4), as measured by the 
knife-edge method. THz near-field images shown were normalized 
to the background for correcting the angle-dependent bending loss. 
The background was measured by scanning a blank coverglass with 
no breast tissue on it. After THz near-field transmission illumination 
imaging, all samples were sent for routine pathological hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E) staining and examination to identify the cancerous 
area in the THz-imaged breast sections.

The insets of Fig. 11.27b,c show the actual photograph of a 20

regions scanned by the THz near-field microscope. As shown in 
Fig. 11.27b,c, we defined the color bar as follows: If the absorption 
coefficient was greater than 9 mm−1, we showed the region in yellow 
and red (with a high cancer probability according to Ref. [65]). As 
a result, the color near-field image obtained by this transmission 
illumination system reflects a high capability of identifying tissues 
between breast cancer and normal tissues (such as fatty and fibrous 
tissue). Figure 11.27d displays the microscopic image of sample 1

after H&E staining. In this sample, the type of breast cancer was 
diagnosed as a papillary carcinoma and marked by a solid black 
boundary. The result clearly indicates that the distribution of breast 
cancer identified in the THz near-field image matches well with 
that seen afterward by pathologic examination. The absorption 
coefficient of fibrous tissue (shown in green) is obviously much less 
than that of the breast cancer tissues. In addition, the THz near-field 
image and the corresponding pathologic photomicrograph of sample 
2 are shown in Fig. 11.27c and Fig. 11.27e, respectively. Obviously, 
the scanned THz image indicates that no region in sample 2 should 
be diagnosed as malignancy, and the fibrous stroma shown in green 
could be distinguished from the fatty tissue shown in blue. These 
results are also in excellent agreement with pathologic diagnosis 
followed by H&E staining.
11.4.2.3  Diagnosing breast tumors with THz fiber-scanning 
near-field microscope
The aforementioned THz fiber-scanning near-field microscope is 
further improved to study the performance of diagnosing unstained 
breast tumor slices without dehydration [55]. The system setup and 
corresponding experimental data analysis method are described 
in Section 11.4.2.2, except that the THz power was detected by a 
Schoktty diode detector. Compared to the Golay cell detector adopted 
previously, the imaging time (scanning area: 10 × 10 mm) was highly 
improved from 50 minutes/100 × 100 pixels to 3 minutes/100 × 
100 pixels. The THz near-field images of the breast tissue sections 
are shown according to the measured absorption coefficient. The 
reference values we used for analyzing experimental results were 
taken from Ref. [65], that is, the mean absorption coefficients at 320 
GHz of fatty tissues, fibrous tissue, and tumor are 2–4.5 mm–1, 7.5–9 
mm–1, and 9–12 mm–1, respectively. Therefore, as the THz near-field 
images show, we defined the color bar as follows: If the absorption 
coefficient inside a certain region of the THz image was greater than 
9 mm–1, we marked the regions as tumor and showed the region in 
red color (9–12 mm–1), while fat was shown in blue (2–4.5 mm–1) 
and fibrous was shown in green (7.5–9 mm–1).

papillary tumors (cases 6–10), and invasive ductal carcinoma (cases 
11–16). From Fig. 11.28, the diagnosis results of the THz near-field 
microscopy examinations of the same samples from 16 patients on 
the basis of the THz absorption coefficients are normal for cases 1–5 
and with tumor for cases 6–16, all in excellent agreement with the 
corresponding pathologic diagnosis by H&E staining, to distinguish 
tumors from normal tissues. In clinical diagnosis, sensitivity

breast tumors from normal tissues.
	
Due to the extensive processing procedure and time-consuming 
analytical examination, pathologists can only analyze a small fraction 
of excised tissues. This current procedure risks the sampling error 
as only a few representative areas in a given lesion were taken for 
examination and only a few sections were observed. By using the 
easily quantifiable THz absorption images to differentiate breast 
tumors from normal tissues, automation on a faster and more 
complete prescreening program becomes possible, which makes 
THz near-field microscopy valuable to field surgeons so that 
pathologists can take advantage of the THz technology to choose 
slices or reduce the number of slices to be processed for pathological 
analysis. With the capability to reduce the load of the extensive and 
time-consuming pathological examination procedure, this THz near-
field microscopy technique can be expected to economize the use of 
hospital and human resources.
11.4.2.4  Detection of early human breast cancer in a 
subcutaneous xenograft mouse model by using THz 
mammogram
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women. 
Early detection of breast cancer allows treatment at an earlier stage 
and would significantly reduce associated mortality. In clinical prac-
tice, X-ray mammography is one of the methods of detecting breast 
cancer and is the only proven method for screening. However, mam-
mography utilizes ionizing X-rays, which may induce malignancy. 
Therefore, a new noninvasive screening examination is needed for 
better early detection. As addressed previously, THz radiation has

OAWG Overview
	
As Fig. 12.5 indicates the integrated OAWG contains 1200 
independently addressable components and is currently the largest 
integrated photonic circuits on an InP platform. The AWG has a total 
of 400 array arms, and each pair of arms has an electro-optic Mach
Zehnder modulator (MZM). High-resolution AWGs are especially 
susceptible to phase errors that can result from imperfections in the 
fabrication process, causing variations in the array arm path length 
[27]. The MZMs enable implementing both phase error correction

The OAWG device supports propagation in both the quasi-
transverse-electric (TE) and quasi-transverse-magnetic (TM) 
polarizations, but full functionality is only available in TE polarization. 
This is due to the fact that the [001] orientation of the InP crystal

phase error correction, the relative phase across the array arms is 
reduced, most notably in the range of array waveguides 150200 in 
Fig. 12.6. The standard deviation of the phase errors also reduced 
from 1.03 radians to 0.33 radians after phase error correction, as a 
result of removing most of the linear phase and mitigating the slowly

bidirectionality of optical signal propagation). Currently, optical-
to-optical modulation response for a Michelson interferometer is 
limited by the photogenerated carrier lifetime and its sweepout 
from the waveguide region. The modulation speed can be improved 
through H + ion implantation, which affects the InP crystal lattice by 
adding defects and vacancies. These additional imperfections serve 
to reduce the carrier lifetime by providing additional recombination 
centers for free carriers. Researchers have already demonstrated the

potential for carrier lifetimes of less than 1 ps at very high doses of 
H+ ion implantation [35]. In our InP OAWG, the H + ion implantation

Optical Arbitrary Waveform Measurement
12.3  Optical Arbitrary Waveform Measurement
The inverse process of OAWG allows detection of the THz arbitrary 
waveform of full amplitude and phase information (or in-phase 
and quadrature information) by OAWM, which is a waveform 
characterization technique analogous to OAWG utilizing inverse 
Fourier transform and coherent detection (instead of Fourier 
transform and coherent modulation in OAWG). Figure 12.11a shows 
a schematic of OAWM, which is essentially the inverse of dynamic 
OAWG, where instead of producing a waveform by creating and 
combining spectral slices, OAWM splits the signal into spectral slices 
                            ä                                      
demultiplexer for spectral slicing of the THz waveform signal so that 
no information is lost. The reference OFC is split into isolated lines 
by the spectral demultiplexer with high isolation. Then, these two 
signals provide inputs to an array of optical coherent receivers. A

(i.e., spectral and frequency responses of demultiplexers and 
photoreceivers). If the waveform data is recorded continuously, the 
spectral resolution is limited only by the reference OFC stability 
and the optical coherent receiver performance. Integrated circuit 
implementation provides the stability required for the coherent 
process.

of OAWM employed a specially designed silica planar lightwave 
circuit (PLC), which integrates all passive optical components 
necessary to implement the spectral slicing and optical coherent 
detection. Balanced detection (i.e., homodyne down-conversion) 
and digitizing occurs off-chip using DC-coupled high-speed balanced 
photodetectors (BPDs) connected to the inputs of high-speed 
digitizers. As Fig. 12.12 shows, the OAWM PLC incorporates two 
AWG spectral demultiplexers, both aligned so that their transmission

the PLC. The gapless AWG slices the signal into slightly overlapping 
spectral slices and directs each slice to a different optical hybrid. The 
high-isolation AWG demultiplexes and directs each comb line to the 
reference (LO) input of the corresponding optical hybrid. Then, each 
hybrid combines a spectral slice in four quadrature phases with a 
reference line. The hybrid outputs are coupled off chip to balanced 
photodiode pairs, which generate the I and Q signals. Then the 
signals are digitized at 20  GHz electrical bandwidth.

by driving the 2 × 2 MZM with a voltage ramp from an electronic

12.13b shows the intensity and phase of the waveform for a 400 ps

15 dB. At this point, the total 100 GHz spectrum was divided into 
ten 10   GHz spectral slices. For the electrical equalization case, 
multiplexer and I/Q modulator pre-emphasis was applied, the in-
phase and quadrature-phase components of the waveform were 
quantized, and then the inverse multiplexer and I/Q modulator 
preemphasis was applied. The optical equalization case involved 
only quantization of the spectral slices. The Q-factor was then 
estimated from the constellation diagrams after reassembling the 
quantized spectral slices into the aggregate waveform.
