ABOUT THE AUTHOR 
About the Author 
RON WHITE is the former executive editor of PC Computing magazine, where he developed the 
popular How It Works illustration to explain the new technologies that were emerging in computing at a 
prodigious rate. He is also the author of the best-selling How Digital Photography Works, and books on 
software, MP3, and digital cameras. His writing and photography have appeared in some of the leading 
magazines in the nation. He can be reached at ron@ronwhite.com. 
About the Illustrator 
TIMOTHY EDWARD DOWNS is the national award-winning illustrator of How Computers 
Work and How Digital Photography Works. Tim has been involved in all facets of graphic design in his il-
lustrious career. From illustrator to creative director, Tim has led teams of artists and designers in advertis-
ing agencies, marketing communications firms, and consumer magazines to better tell their stories 
through illustration, photography, typography, and design. "Our job doesn't start when the writer hits 
Save. In order to effectively communicate the tone or the concept of the piece, we need to know and un-
derstand the story from the original brainstorm all the way through final execution," reminds Tim.

THE changes in PCs have been so rapid, so extensive, and so complex, I could never have learned the 
tricks behind the new technologies without the help of many knowledgeable people who were not only 
generous with that knowledge, but were patient enough to explain it to me until the mental LED lit up. 
My first acknowledgment must be to the late Jim Seymour, who was a columnist in PC Magazine and 
Infoworld, and who was the editor-in-chief of PC Computing when it was launched in 1988. Jim died un-
expectedly and left a void in the universe for knowledge, friendship, and serenity. The longer I spend in a 
world without Jim, the more keenly I feel the loss. 
Jim and his wife, Nora, who was editor of PCC and a woman of great warmth, charm, and smarts, gave 
me my first chance at a national magazine. And what a chance it was. I had the privilege of launching 
the How It Works feature in PC Computing in 1989, but over the years, many people have worked on the 
series, and several chapters are based on the research and explanations they've done. Deep thanks go to 
Margaret Ficklen, Herb Brody, Brett L. Glass, Marty Jerome, Raymond Jones, Matthew Lake, Jack 
Nimersheim, Randy Ross, Stephen Sagman, Jan Smith, Dylan Tweney, Doug van Kirk, Mark L. Van 
Name, Bill Catchings, Christine Grech Wendin, and Kenan Woods. lowe a huge debt to Mike Edelhart, 
who a dozen years ago was editor-in-chief of PC Computing and who convinced a dubious publisher to 
take a chance on a kind of computer book that had never been done before. To Preston Gralla, who 
guided me in the launch of How It Works and who jumped in when I needed help to write several of the 
spreads, thanks for a friendship and too many acts of kindness to list. 
I'm also grateful to the dozens of people in the PC industry who've shared their knowledge, schematics, 
and white papers to infuse How Computers Work with detail and accuracy. I'm particularly grateful to 
Chris Thornton of ClipMate; Karen Thomas at Olympus; Joe Vanderwater, Bryan Langerdoff, Dan

Mark Reddin and John Rizzo for tech editing, and John for researching several chapters. I'm deeply 
grateful for the editing of this edition by Todd Brakke, who is the type of intelligent, dedicated editor every 
writer wants. And thanks to my wife, Sue, for her constant encouragement, spirit-raising, and humor 
while waiting for me to pop out of writing mode. 
I learned long ago that a writer's skill depends largely on how well the writer can steal from others. In ad-
dition to just about every book in the Que How It Works series, other books were invaluable for details on 
PC innards: Understanding I/O Subsystems by W. David Schwaderer and Andrew W. Wilson, Jr.; Inside 
the IBM PC by Peter Norton; The PC Configuration Handbook by John Woram; Marshall Brain's 
HowstuffWorks.com; The Winn Rosch Hardware Bible by Winn L. Rosch; and Scott Mueller's Upgrading 
and Repairing PCs. Also helpful was The Way Things Work by David Macaulay, not only for its informa-
tive explanations of computers, but for its inspiring examples of how to combine text and art into clear ex-
planations. 
Finally, this book would not be what it is without the art work of Timothy Edward Downs. Invariably, he 
transformed my Neanderthal sketches into clear, informative illustrations, but also managed to make them 
into wonderful works of art. Tim has created a new, visual way to communicate technology, and I'm 
proud one of its first appearances was in this book.

INTRODUCTION 
Introduction 
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. II 
-Arthur C. Clarke 
SORCERERS have their magic wands-powerful, potentially dangerous tools with lives of their own. 
Witches have their familiars-creatures disguised as household beasts that could, if they choose, wreak 
the witches' havoc. Mystics have their golems-beings built of wood and tin brought to life to do their 
masters' bidding. 
We have our personal computers. 
PCs, too, are powerful creations that often seem to have a life of their own. Usually, they respond to a 
wave of a mouse or a spoken incantation by performing tasks we couldn't imagine doing ourselves with-
out some sort of preternatural help. But even as computers successfully carry out our commands, it's often 
difficult to quell the feeling that there's some wizardry at work here. 
And then there are the times when our PCs, like malevolent spirits, rebel and open the gates of chaos onto 
our neatly ordered columns of numbers, our carefully wrought sentences, and our beautifully crafted 
graphics. When that happens, we're often convinced that we are, indeed, playing with power not entirely 
under our control. We become sorcerers' apprentices, whose every attempt to right things leads to deeper 
trouble. 
Whether our personal computers are faithful servants or imps, most of us soon realize there's much more 
going on inside those silent boxes than we really understand. PCs are secretive. Open their tightly sealed 
cases and you're confronted with poker-faced components. Few give any clues as to what they're about. 
Most of them consist of sphinx-like microchips that offer no more information about themselves than some 
obscure code printed on their impenetrable surfaces. The maze of circuit tracings etched on the boards is 
fascinating, but meaningless, hieroglyphics. Some crucial parts, such as the hard drive and power supply, 
are sealed with printed omens about the dangers of peeking inside-omens that put to shame the warn-
ings on a pharaoh's tomb. 
This book is based on two ideas. One is that the magic we understand is safer and more powerful than 
the magic we don't. This is not a hands-on how-to book. Don't look for any instructions for taking a 
screwdriver to this part or the other. But perhaps your knowing more about what's going on inside all 
those stoic components makes them a little less formidable when something does go awry. The second 
idea behind this book is that knowledge, in itself, is a worthwhile and enjoyable goal. This book is written 
to respond to your random musings about the goings-on inside that box you sit in front of several hours a 
day. If this book puts your questions to rest-or raises new ones-it will have done its job. 
At the same time, however, I'm trusting that knowing the secrets behind the magician's legerdemain won't 
spoil the show. This is a real danger. Mystery is often as compelling as knowledge. I'd hate to think that 
anything you read in this book takes away that sense of wonder you have when you manage to make 
your PC do some grand, new trick. I hope that, instead, this book makes you a more confident sorcerer. 

BEFORE YOU BEGIN 
xiii 
Before You Begin 
THIS book has been written with a certain type of personal computer in mind-the Wintel, a PC most 
often built around an Intel processor and running Microsoft Windows. Many of the specifics in these ex-
planations apply only to that class of computer and those components. 
In more general terms, the explanations also apply to Macintosh computers, Unix workstations, and even 
minicomputers and mainframes. But I've made no attempt to devise universal explanations of how com-
puters work. To do so would, of necessity, detract from the understanding that comes from inspecting spe-
cific components. 
Even so, there is so much variety even within the Intel/Microsoft world of PCs that, at times, I've had to 
limit my explanations to particular instances or stretch the boundaries of a particular situation to make an 
explanation as generic as possible. If you spot anything that doesn't seem quite right in this book, I hope 
that my liberties with the particulars is the only cause.

BOOT-UP PROCESS 
"/ think there is a world market for maybe five computers. " 
-Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, 1943 
BEFORE your personal computer is turned on, it is a dead collection of sheet metal, plastic, 
metallic tracings, and tiny flakes of silicon. When you push the On switch, one little burst of elec-
tricity-only about 3-5 volts-starts a string of events that magically brings to life what would oth-
erwise remain an oversized paperweight. 
Even with that spark of life in it, however, the PC is still stupid at first. It has some primitive 
sense of self as it checks to see what parts are installed and working, like those patients who've 
awakened from a coma and check to be sure they have all their arms and legs and that all their 
joints still work. But beyond taking inventory of itself, the newly awakened PC still can't do any-
thing really useful; certainly nothing we would even remotely think of as intelligent. 
At best, the newly awakened PC can search for intelligence-intelligence in the form of an 
operating system that gives structure to the PC's primitive, amoebic existence. Then comes a true 
education in the form of application software-programs that tell the PC how to do tasks faster and 
more accurately than we could. The PC becomes a student who has surpassed its teacher. 
But not all kinds of computers have to endure such a torturous rebirth each time they're turned 
on. You encounter daily many computers that spring to life fully formed at the instant they're 
switched on. You might not think of them as computers, but they are: calculators, your car's elec-
tronic ignition, the timer in the microwave, and the unfathomable programmer in your DVR. The dif-
ference between these and the big box on your desk is hard-wiring. Computers built to accomplish 
only one task-and they are efficient about doing that task-are hard-wired. But that means they 
are more like idiot savants than sages. 
What makes your PC such a miraculous device is that each time you turn it on, it is a tabula 
rasa, capable of doing anything your creativity-or, more usually, the creativity of professional 
programmers-can imagine for it to do. It is a calculating machine, an artist's canvas, a magical 
typewriter, an unerring accountant, and a host of other tools. To transform it from one persona to 
another merely requires setting some of the microscopic switches buried in the hearts of the 
microchips, a task accomplished by typing a command or by clicking with your mouse on some 
tiny icon on the screen.

How Computers Used to Work 
At the beginning of the 21 st century, comput-
ers are such complex beasts---despite their rel-
ative youth-that it's difficult to imagine how such elaborate contraptions could have 
sprung fully grown from the brows of their creators. The explanation is, of course, that 
they didn't. The development of computers has been an evolutionary process, and often 
it's well nigh impossible to figure out which came first, the chicken of software or the 
egg of hardware. 
Human attempts to create tools to manipulate data date back at least as far as 
2600 B.C. when the Chinese came up with the abacus. Later on, Leonardo da Vinci 
created a mechanical calculator. When the slide rule was invented in 1621 , it 
remained the mathematician's tool of choice until the electronic calculator took over in 
the early 1970s. 
All the early efforts to juggle numbers had two things in common: They were 
mechanical and they were on a human scale. They were machines made of parts big 
enough to assemble by hand. Blaise Pascal 's Arithmetic Machine used a system of 
gears turned by hand to do subtraction and addition. It also used punch cards to store 
data, a method that's survived well into the 20th century.

This portion of the Difference Engine 
#1, a forerunner to Charles Babbage's 
Analytical Engine--the first true 
computer--was completed in 1821. It 
contained 2,000 handmade brass 
ports. The entire machine would have 
used 25,000 ports and would have 
weighed 3 tons. The Analytical Engine 
was never completed, although port 
of it was built by Babbage's son, 
Henry, in 1910, and was found to be 
"buggy."

make decisions such as sequential control, 
branching, and looping. But Babbage's 
machine was so complex that he died in 
1871 without finishing it. It was built 
between 1989 and 1991 by dedicated mem-
bers of the Science Museum in London. The 
physical size and complex mechanics of 
these mechanisms limited their usefulness; 
they were good for only a few tasks, and 
they were not something that could be mass 
produced. 
Mechanical devices of all types flour-
ished modestly during the first half of the 
20th century. Herman Hollerith invented a 
mechanized system of paper cards with holes 
in them to tabulate the U.S. Census. Later, in 
1924, Hollerith's Computing-Tabulating-
Recording Company changed its name to 
Although no one could have known it at the time, the first breakthrough to the modern 
computer occurred in 1904 when John Ambrose Fleming created the first commercial 
diode vacuum tube, something Thomas Edison had discovered and discarded as worth-
less. The significance of the vacuum tube is that it was the first step beyond the human 
scale of machines. Until it came along, computations were made first by gears and then 
by switches. The vacuum tube could act as a switch turning on and off thousands of times 
faster than mechanical contraptions. 
Vacuum tubes were at the heart of Colossus, a computer created by the British during 
World War II to break the codes produced by the Germans' Enigma encrypting machine. 
And the Germans reportedly came up with a general-purpose computer---one not limited to 
a specific task as Colossus was. But the German invention was lost or destroyed in the war. 
The war also gave birth to ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator Analyzer and 
Computer), built between 1943 and 1945 by the U.S. Army to produce missile trajectory 
tables. ENIAC performed 5,000 additions a second, although a problem that took two sec-
onds to solve required two days to set up. ENIAC cost $500,000, weighed 30 tons, and 
was 100 feet long and 8 feet high. It contained 1,500 relays and 17,468 vacuum tubes. 
Those same tubes that made ENIAC possible in the first place were also its Achilles' 
heel. Consuming 200 kilowatts of electricity each hour, the tubes turned the computer into 
an oven, constantly cooking its own components. Breakdowns were frequent. What was 
needed was something that did the job of the tubes without the heat, bulk, and fragility. 
And that something had been around since 1926. 

In 1926, the first semiconductor 
transistor was invented, but it wasn't 
until 1947, when Bell Labs' William 
Shockley patented the modern solid-
state, reliable transistor, that a new era 
in computing dawned. The transistor did 
essentially the same thing a vacuum 
tube did-control the flow of electric-
ity-but it was the size of a pea and 
generated little heat. Even with the tran-
sistor, the few computers built then still 
used tubes. It wasn't until 1954, when 
Texas Instruments created a way to pro-
duce silicon transistors commercially, 
that the modern computer took off. That 
same year IBM introduced the 650, the first mass-produced computer. Businesses and 
the government bought 120 of them the first year. 
Four years later, Texas Instruments built the first integrated circuit by combining five 
separate components and the circuitry connecting them on a piece of germanium half 
an inch long. The integrated circuit led to the modern processor and has made a never-
ending contribution to smaller and smaller computers. 
The computer grew increasingly smaller and more powerful, but its cost, complexity, 
and unswerving unfriendliness kept it the tool of the tech-
nological elite. It wasn't until 1975 that something 
resembling a personal computer appeared. The January 
issue of Popular Electronics featured on its cover some-
thing called the Altair 8800, made by Micro 
Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS). For 
$397, customers got a kit that included an Intel 8080 
microprocessor and 256 bytes of memory. There was 
no keyboard; programs and data were both entered by 
clicking switches on the front of the Altair. There was no 
monitor. Results were read by interpreting a pattern of 
small red lights. But it was a real computer cheap 
enough for anyone to afford. MITS received orders for 
4,000 Altair systems within a few weeks. 
The new computer was at first a toy for hobbyists and hackers. They devised clever 
ways to expand the Altair and similar microcomputers with keyboards, video displays, 
magnetic tape, and then diskette storage. Then two hackers-Stephen Jobs and Steve 
Wozniak---created a personal computer that came complete with display, built-in key-
board, and disk storage, and began hawking it at computer clubs in California. They 
called it the Apple, and it was the first personal computer that was powerful enough,

new computers as toys, and at the same time they saw 
microcomputers as a threat to their turf. 
The development that finally broke the dam, unleash-
ing microcomputers on a society that would forever after 
be different, was not a technical invention. It was a mar-
keting decision IBM made when creating its first per-
sonal computer, the IBM Pc. IBM wanted to keep the 
price down, and so it decided to build the computer 
from components that were already available off the 
shelf from several suppliers. IBM also made the overall 
design of the PC freely available to competitors. The 
only part of the machine IBM copyrighted was the BIOS, 
the crucial basic input! output system, computer code

residing in a single chip that defined how software was to interact with the PC's hard-
ware. The competition could create their own PCs as long as they duplicated the opera-
tions of IBM's BIOS without directly copying it. 
While Apple continued to keep its design proprietary, IBM's openness encouraged 
the creation of IBM clones that could use the same software and hardware add-ons the 
PC used. And the clones, while competing with IBM, at the same time helped establish 
the IBM architecture as the machine for which software and add-on hardware develop-
ers would design.

KEY CONCEPTS 
BIOS (basic input/output system) 
A collec-
tion of software codes built into a PC that handle 
some of the fundamental tasks of sending data from 
one part of the computer to another. 
boot or boot-up 
The process that takes place 
when a PC is turned on and performs the routines 
necessary to get all the components functioning 
properly and the operating system loaded. The 
term comes from the concept of lifting yourself by 
your bootstraps. 
circuit board 
Originally, wires ran from and to 
any component in any electrical device, not just 
computers. A circuit board replaces the need for 
separate wiring with the metallic traces printed on 
the board-sometimes also on the bottom of the 
board and in a hidden middle layer. The traces 
lead to connections for processors, resistors, capac-
itors, and other electrical components. The impor-
tance of the circuit board is that its entire creation 
can be automated, and the board packs more com-
ponents into an ever-smaller space. 

clock 
A microchip that regulates the timing and 
speed of all the computer's functions. The chip 
includes a crystal that vibrates at a certain fre-
quency when electricity is applied to it. The short-
est length of time in which a computer can perform 
some operation is one clock, or one vibration of 
the clock chip. The speed of clocks-and therefore, 
computers-is expressed in megahertz (MHz). One 
megahertz is 1 million cycles, or vibrations, a sec-
ond. Thus, a PC can be described as having a 
200 or 300 MHz processor, which means that the 
processor has been designed to work with a clock 
chip running at that speed. 
CMOS 
An acronym for complementary metalox-
ide semiconductor-a term that describes how a 
CMOS microchip is manufactured. Powered by a 
small battery, the CMOS chip retains crucial infor-
mation about what hardware a PC comprises even 
when power is turned off. 
CPU 
An acronym for central processing unit, it is 
used to mean the microprocessor-also, 
processor-which is a microchip that processes the 
information and the code (instructions) used by a 
computer. The "brains" of a computer. 
expansion slot 
Most PCs have unused slots 
into which the owner can plug circuit boards and 
hardware to add to the computer's capabilities. 
Most slots today are personal computer interface 
(PCI) or it's next-generation sibling PCI-Express (PCI-
E). One other slot, the accelerated graphics port 
(AGP), accepts a video card designed to move 
images out of memory quickly, although it is fast 
being replaced by PCI-E-you might also see shorter 
slots on older computers. These are industry stan-
dard architecture (ISA), the only type of slots on the 
first Pc. 
motherboard 
A sheet of plastic onto which 
metallic circuits have been printed and to the rest 
of the PC's components are connected. These com-
ponents could be connected via a socket, such as 
with the CPU, a slot, as with graphics cards and 
memory modules or they may be built directly onto 
the motherboard, as with external ports, such as 
USB. 
OVERVIEW 
9 
operating system 
Software that exists to con-
trol the operations of hardware. Essentially, the 
operating system directs any operation, such as 
writing data to memory or to disk, and regulates the 
use of hardware among several application pro-
grams that are running at the same time. This frees 
program developers from having to write their own 
code for these most basic operations. 
ROM and RAM 
Acronyms for Read Only 
Memory and Random Access Memory. ROM is 
memory chips or data stored on disks that can be 
read by the computer's processor. The PC cannot 
write new data to those chips or disk drives. RAM is 
memory or disks that can be both read and written 
to. Random access memory really is a misnomer 
because even ROM can be accessed randomly. The 
term was originally used to distinguish RAM from 
data and software that was stored on magnetic 
tape, and which could be accessed only sequen-
tially. That is, to get to the last chunk of data or 
code on a tape, a computer must read through all 
the information contained on the tape until it finds 
the location where it stored the data or code for 
which it is looking. In contrast, a computer can 
jump directly to any information stored in random 
locations in RAM chips or on disk. 
system files 
Small disk files that contain soft-
ware code that are the first files a computer reads 
from disk when it is booted. The system files contain 
the information needed, following the initial hard-
ware boot, to load the rest of an operating system. 
write and read 
Writing is the process by 
which a computer stores data in either RAM chips 
or on a disk drive. Reading is the process by which 
a computer transfers data or software code from a 
drive to RAM or from RAM to the microprocessor.

Getting to Know 
the Hardware 

CHAPTER 1 
GETTING TO KNOW THE HARDWARE 
1 1 
THE handy thing about gears, pulleys, and the wheel-man's first tools-is that even someone who hasn't seen 
them before can quickly figure out what they are and how they're used. Humankind's latest and greatest tool-the 
computer-isn't nearly as obliging. It is made up of tiny rectangular blocks of plastic and cylinders of metal and 
ceramics that hide their inner workings. It has a maze of metallic lines, wires, and cables that would drive a lab rat 
schizo. The bigger components are encased in metal jackets that hide their purpose and operation. And the computer 
is as mute as a sphinx. The numbers and letters found on components certainly are not a part of any language you 
and I use. 
But then, first meetings are always the most awkward. The purpose of this chapter is to get you and your PC 
beyond the sticky introductions so that you're on a first name basis with most of those mysterious components. As in 
any relationship, somebody's the boss. Let's be sure it's you by opening up your PC for a quick tour. All you'll need is 
a screwdriver. Check the screws sealing the case of your PC to determine what kind of screwdriver you'll need. Some 
PCs don't even require a screwdriver; instead they employ twistable thumbscrews that require no tools at all. A flash-
light will also help. One of those little mirrors dentists use will enable you to see some of the more bashful components 
as well. 
Now, before you do anything, touch a metal portion of the computer while it's still plugged in to discharge any 
static electricity that might have built up in your body and clothing. The components in your PC work with minute 
amounts of electrical current. A zap between your finger and some unsuspecting microchip after you've shuffled 
across a carpet on a cold, dry day is like sending the chip to the electric chair. You might not even feel the shock that 
kills your PC's components, so you should always take this precaution when working on your Pc. 
Then shut down your PC and unplug it. This is another safety precaution, but one to protect you instead of the 
machine. I don't know of anyone who has been fried by a PC, but don't take chances. Now you can undo the screws 
holding your case shut. They're usually around the edge of the back of your Pc. The screws will run away if you're 
not careful, so put them somewhere where they can't get away from you. Slide off the chassis's cover. This is not 
always easy, but take some comfort from the fact that taking off the cover is easier than putting it back on. 
Now shine your light into the bowels of the beast. What you're looking at is a mechanical organism of enormous 
complexity. If you counted the transistors in a modern PC as people, and the circuits connecting them as highways, 
you would be looking at something twice as enormous and intertwined as the United States-and you're the new kid 
in town. The illustration on the next two pages is a map to the major landmarks of a personal computer. It tells you 
what each does and why you would want it on your Pc. Don't worry if you don't have everything shown in the pic-
ture. I've stuffed the example with more components than most computers have in the interest of thoroughness. The 
components in your PC might be located in different positions, but generally they will look like the components in the 
illustration. Following your tour of the inside of your PC, we'll linger at another illustration to get a close-up view of 
those highways of circuitry. 
Finally, don't worry about damaging the computer. Unless you do something really stupid-such as throwing a 
glass of Coke into the computer while it's running-you won't hurt your Pc. The only component that you could con-
ceivably damage-if you don't count chips zapped by the homicidal static electricity-is the hard drive. The platters 
inside it are spinning at a breathtaking rate within fractions of a millimeter from other parts that could, if jostled, col-
lide like race cars on Memorial Day. But don't worry. This is going to be a midnight run.

Inside the Personal Computer 
~ 
Power Supply: All electricity enters your PC through this shielded metal box. 
El 
Inside it, a transformer converts the current that comes from standard ourlets into the 
voltages and current flows needed by various parts of the computer. All other com-
ponents, from the motherboard to disk drives, get their power through the main sup-
ply via colored wires that end in plastic shielded connectors. 
CD-ROM/DVD-
ROM Drive: CD and 
DVD drives use a laser 
beam to read data from 
a spiral of indentation 
and flat areas on a 
layer of metallic film. 
New PCs now simply 
feature a DVD drive, 
which also reads CDs. 
The CD holds about 
650 megabytes (MB) of 
data. A DVD disc holds 
about 4.7gigabytes 
(GB) on each side of the 
disc. The DVD gets the 
extra storage by using a 
narrower laser beam, 
which reads from two 
separate layers in the 
DVD. Writable CD 
and DVD drives: 
Both CD and DVD dri-
ves are read-only 
devices, but each has 
version s that write to 
blank CD and DVD 
discs. Different drives 
record differenrly, mak-
ing it uncertain whether 
a DVD made on one 
drive will play on a dif-
ferent drive. All software 
today is distributed over 
the Internet or on 
CD/DVD. In combina-
tion with writable 
CD/DVD becoming a 
standard, this means 
that the floppy drive is 
starting to disappear 
from the PC (see 
Chapter 12). 
Hard Drive: This is the main repository-in 
the form of magnetic recordings on hard, thin 
platters--Qf your programs and the docu-
ments on which you work. It also contains the 
system files that let your computer spring to 
life (see Chapter 3). It is the busiest mechani-
cal part of your computer, with com-
ponents moving at a 
blinding speed (see 
Chapter 10).

Disk Controllers: The motherboords of most new PCs have two types of 
connections for passing data and instruc~ons to disk drives. The older IDE 
controller is used for floppy and optical drives, which are inherently slower 
that the controllers' ability to pass signals to the drives via flat, wide ribbons 
containing 40-80 wires. The newer Serial-ATA (SATA) connectors are 
reserved for hard drives, which take better advantage of the speed with which 
SATA passes informa~on along a slim four-wire cable. 
Expansion Slot: like disk controllers, expansion slots used to integrate 
new circuit boards into the motherboard, are combinations of the newest 
technology and legacy slots for compatibility with expansion boards still lag-
ging behind in the engineering. 
Video Card: Translates image information into the varying electrical cur-
rents needed to display an image on the monitor (see Chapter 17). 
Sound Card: Contains the circuitry for recording and reproducing mul~me­
dia sound. This might be an expansion card or some computers might have it 
built into a few chips on the motherboard and attached by cables to external 
connections for amplified speakers, headphones, microphone, and CD player 
input (see Chapter 22). 
RAM: Random Access Memory is a collection of microchips aligned on small 
circuit boards that fit into slots with a couple of hundred or more connectors. 
RAM is where the computer stores programs and data while it uses them. 
When the computer is turned off, the contents of RAM are lost (see Chapter 4) 
Real-Time Clock: A vibrating crystal in this component is the drummer 
that sets the pace and synchronizes the work of all the other components (see 
Chapter 2). 
CMOS: This is a special type of memory chip that uses a small battery to 
retain information about your PC's hardware configuration even while the 
computer is turned off (see Chapter 2). 
BIOS: If the microprocessor is your PC's brains, this is the heart. It is one 
or two chips that define the personality, or individuality, of your computer. 
The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) knows the details of how your PC 
was put together and serves as an intermediary between the operating 
software running your computer and the various hardware components 
(see Chapter 3). 
CMOS Battery: Rarely needs changing, but if you ever have to, be sure 
you have a file backup of the information the CMOS chip contains (see 
Chapter 2). 
Microprocessor: Often called the brains of a computer, the micro-
processor or central processing unit (CPU) is a tight, complex collec~on of 
transistors arranged so that they can be used to manipulate data. The 
processor handles most operations of your computer, the design of which 
dictates how software must be written to work correcrly (see Chapter 5).

direcrly to periph-
erals. USBs can 
connect keyboards, 
input devices 
(mice, trackballs, 
etc.), flash memory 
drives, printers, 
and other devices 
without encounter-
ing resource con-
flicts (see 
Chapter 16) . 
II] Mouse Port: Also 
called a PS2 port, 
this is a standard, but 
waning, feature on 
all current PCs. 
Personal computers 
can use a mouse that 
connects to a serial 
port or USB port. 
m Keyboard Port: Keyboards are usually separate 
from the CPU housing and connect to a mini-DIN port, 
which looks identical to the PS2 port. The keyboard 
connection might be a larger, 5-pin round port on 
older systems and a USB port on newer systems. 
E::J Network Connector: The network connecter allows 
you to connect your PC to a local area network (LAN) or 
a broadband cable or DSl modem for high-speed 
Internet access (see Chapter 27). 
m 
Parallel Port: Although falling into disuse, when the 
parallel port is used, it's most often to connect a printer, 
but some drives and other peripherals can piggyback 
on the port. 
EE] Serial Ports: Some PCs still have one or two serial 
ports, but they are all but obsolete because of the USB 
port. A PC can have four serial ports, but only two are 
usable at one ~me because one pair uses the same 
hardware resources as the other pair. 
m Heat Sink: Because microprocessors produce so much heat, a heat sink 
is used to dissipate the heat so that internal components of the chip don't 
melt. 
E!] Sound Card Connections: External jacks on the 
sound card or motherboard enable you to attach a 
microphone, speakers, or an external sound source. The 
PC's op~cal drive (CD or DVD) is attached to the sound 
card internally (see Chapter 22). 
C Modem: Connects your PC to a telephone line so that 
you can get to information services and the Internet. 
Modems also come as external devices that connect to a 
serial port (see Chapter 26).

How Tablet PCs Set You Free 
The deskless PC has long been computing 's holy groil, a computer that slips the bounds of keyboard and cables, of monitor and mouse, to 
soar free as a bird-a bird endowed with a constant feed from the Internet, applications that will run a multinational corporation, and on 
easy abandon that lets it go with you anywhere, like a parrot perched on a pirate in pinstripe. Two factors foiled that quest-networking, 
which required an electronic umbilical cord, and haphazard human handwriting, which required a keyboard for intelligible communica-
tions. After a few false starts, the grail overflows with WiFi for always-on Internet and handwriting recognition that doesn't require you to 
learn a new way of writing. 
How Screens Feel Your Touch 
Of the dozen or so ways to design touchscreens, most of them follow a similar <rr'prr' ...... vv thin or above the layers of glass and plastic that 
make up the tablet computer's LCD screenething-electrical capacitance, electrical resl 
, light, infrared light, or sound waves. When 
a stylus or finger disrupts whatever makes up the field, sensors measure the disruption 
where it must have happened . There 
are a couple of exceptions to this, as we'll see while we look at some of the more com 
mentations of touchscreens. 
Resistive System 
The screen on a tablet PC using the resistive 
system includes a glass panel covered with a 
thin metallic layer made of a substance, such 
as indium tin oxide, that conducts electricity. 
Spacers on the layer support a metallic layer 
that resists the flow of electricity. When you 
touch the screen with your finger or a stylus, 
the two layers make contact, changing the 
electrical field produced by the layers. This per-
mits the computer to calculate the coordinates 
of the contact.

Capacitive Touchscreen 
In a capacitive system, a transparent material 
that stares an electrical charge covers the screen's 
glass panel. When you touch the monitar, some of 
the charge is transferred to your finger and the 
capacitive layer's charge decreases. Circuits at 
each corner of the screen constantly measure the 
change in the charge reaching them. From those 
measurements, the computer calculates where the 
touch occurred. 

GETTING TO KNOW THE HARDWARE

Surface Acoustic Wave 
A tablet PC using a surface acoustic wave system has two trans-
ducers, such as piezoelectric devices, that translate energy into move-
ment and back again . Placed on the X and Y axes of the screen, one 
transducer converts electrical signals into ultrasonic vibrations that travel 
through the screen to the second transducer, which converts the vibrations 
back into electrical current. Also on the screens are reflectors, which 
reflect the vibrations. Because the reflected vibrations travel different 
paths, they arrive at the receiving transducer out of phase, producing 
an interference pattern. Something touching the screen's face also pro-
duces an interference pattern . The computer deciphers the changes in the 
signals' wave pattern to determine exactly where the screen was touched . 
SenICr 
Oplicallmaging 
Inlerferen(! Pon!rn 
Two or more simple image sensors overlook the screen, usually from 
the corners. Opposite the sensors are infrared backlights positioned so 
the sensors constantly detect the infrared lights. A touch on the screen is 
detected as a shadow by the sensors. By coordinating the position of the 
shadow as detected by each senor, a signal processor built into the 
screen determines where the touch took place. 
Infr",d Ughl Source 
Dispersive Signal Sensing 
Touchscreens equipped with dispersive signal sensing technology work with-
out special layers or elements that emit a field of signals to be disrupted by a 
touch. Instead, this system measures the strengths of bend waves produced in 
the screen's glass surface by the pressure placed on the screen when it is 
touched. As the waves disperse through the glass, they become smeared-the 
faster high frequencies separate from the slower low frequencies. The farther the 
waves travel, the more they are smeared. Piezoelectric sensors positioned at each 
corner convert the smeared waves into electrical impulses a processor uses to 
determine the position of the touch . 
What's Got the Touch? 
pjezoele~ri ( SenICr 
Not all objects register equally well on all types of touch-sensitive screens. Just about anything will work with a resistive system, provided it 
makes the two metallic layers touch each other. But a capacitive system registers only touches from objects that have their own electromag-
netic fields. That can be your finger or a stylus that picks up an electrical charge from your hand. The wave system is similar to a resistor 
touchscreen except it does not accurately register hard, small objects such as the tip of a stylus. Both image sensing and dispersive signal 
processing have the advantage that no light-absorbing layers are embedded in the screen, making the screen's image brighter.

How Tablet PCs 
Read Your Handwriting 
Early aHempts at a computer screen that could convert handwriting into editable text, such as the 
Palm, required users to write in a special alpbab . As awkward as that seems today, at the time, 
it was a technological breakthrough . But a "C 
e later, today's handwriting recognition can 
decipher the scrawls of the most harried d 
to Here's how. 
One approach is stroke 
timing. An ink paHern is inter-
preted as a sequence of points 
on a flat surface. Their sequence 
is based on the timing with which 
each point appeared . The ink not 
only has a shape, but it has a tra-
jectary that aids in determining 
what the ink represents. A lower-
case "g" and "q" can both con-
tain closed loops whose 
distinctions are too subtle far a 
computer to recognize. But given 
the trajectaries of the strokes in 
the two characters, a tablet PC 
can easily discern the two.

When our hypothetical doctor writes on the 
screen of a tablet PC, he creates ink, the 
term for both a touchscreen 's display of 
handwriting before it is turned into digital 
text and for drawings, arrows, and other 
images that should not be turned into text. 
Handwriting recognition's first job is to rec-
ognize what is handwriting and what isn't. 
The character expert in the recognition 
software begins with a two-pronged 
approach. 

The other approach is a spatial 
matrix. The recognition soft-
ware plots the digital ink on a 
matrix with X and Y axes and a 
point of origin. The software com-
pares the matrix plot to a data-
base of shapes, any of which 
may be used to represent a spe-
cific letter, and selects the closest 
match. 
C Because a tablet is designed to recognize script handwriting 
as well as printed block letters, a segmentation expert 
analyzes the ink to decide where a continuous stream of ink 
should be divided to yield individual characters. For exam-
ple, if the doctor writes "clay" in script as one continuous 
application of ink, the work can be divided at least three 
ways. 
c 
a 
As in the example of "clay," there is no way to deter-
mine the correct translation of ink to text by visual 
examination alone. The recognition software relies on 
the language expert to identify the word by com-
paring it to an exhaustive database of words, lexicons, 
regular expressions, idioms, and language models. If 
only one choice ~merges, the .expert picks that choice 
unaided. If there IS some ambigUity, the software pre-
sents the doctor with a list of alternative possibilities. 
This method of recognizing words by looking at them 
in context is more accurate than recognizing individual 
letters when the words written by the doctor are in the 
expert's database.

In Windows XP, users could not train their 
computer to better recognize their handwrit-
ing. The only way to get better results was for 
users to retrain themselves to write more care-
fully. In Windows Vista, however, the hand-
writing engine gives users the option of 
correcting specific errors and then it learns 
from the corrections. The software also pays 
attention to the words used in email and 
incorporates them into its dictionaries.

UNDER the big top of your computer, the microprocessor-the central processing unit-is always the 
headliner. You don't see ads or reviews raving that a new PC has "revolutionary 1 OO-ohm resistors!" 
Hard drives and graphics cards have the top supporting roles, but when it comes to the components on 
the motherboard-the mother of all boards-the CPU steals the spotlight. 
There are many good reasons for the CPU's fame, but like all stars, it owes a lot to the little compo-
nents-the circuit board supporting parts without which the central microprocessor would be only a cold 
slab of silicon. Without them, electronic messages meant for the CPU would crash into the chips and 
each other, moving so fast there would be no time to read their license plates. Contrarily, other messages 
would arrive like dying murder victims at the ER, so weak they can only whisper their crucial clues in 
pulses so faint the microprocessor can't understand them. 
These supporting casts were much smaller in the early days of PCs because the starring role of the 
motherboard was much smaller. It was basically a platform for the microprocessor, which is a transporta-
tion grid for conveying signals back and forth between the CPU and the parts the CPU controlled-disc 
controller cards, video cards, sound cards, input/output cards. Back then, nearly everything that made a 
PC a PC was handled by expansion cards, which was handy because you could easily update a single 
component as innovation and budget allowed. Today, almost any computer comes with sound, video, 
disk controllers, and an assortment of input/output options all on the motherboard. Your computer's char-
acter is largely determined by the motherboard's capability, and those capabilities are largely defined 
by the parts that populate it. 
So here, ladies and gentlemen, are the little parts that make it all possible. 
• Tiny metallic cans house the circuit board's strong men-the resistors! They clamp down on 
the wild, untamed electricity before it has the chance to burn up the rest of the components. 
• Wrapped in ceramic casing and coats of plastic are the voracious, singing capacitors! They 
hum as they consume great quantities of electrical charge, holding it in so other components 
can have a steady supply or a sudden surge of electricity when they need it. 
• Scattered everywhere on the motherboard are those mysterious, miniature monoliths, the 
microchips! What the millions of transistors do inside them is known to only a few. 
• And connecting them all are stripes of copper and aluminum, circuit traces, that tie it all 
together so the individual players are a coordinated whole. 

22 
BOOT-UP PROCESS 
How Circuit Boards Work 
Most of the components in a PC are mounted on printed circuit boards. The 
motherboard is the largest printed circuit. Expansion cards and memory chips 
plug into the motherboard. The memory chips are grouped together on small cir-
cuit boards to create dual in-line memory modules, or DIMMs. 
Components that at first glance don't appear to have circuit boards often have 
them, they're just hidden inside their housings. Disk drives and some micro-
processors, such as the Athlon 64 and Core 2, tie their internal parts together 
with printed circuits. 
Printed circuits eliminate the need for individual wires that connect compo-
nents and also greatly reduce the time and cost of building a PC by doing 
away with hand-soldering of most connections. Instead of wire, metallic 
traces-usually aluminum or copper-are printed onto sheets of hard 
plastic. The traces are so narrow that dozens fit across a single inch. 
design of a circuit 
board might require traces 
to cross over other traces with-
out actually touching each 
other, which would cause a 
misrouting of electrical signals. 
In this case, one of the traces 
goes through the board to the 
opposite surface, where it can 
continue on its path without 
intersecting the other trace. 
Some circuit boards with 
complex tracings have a 
third layer sandwiched 
between the two external 
trace surfaces. 

CHAPTER 2 
HOW CIRCUITS JUGGLE DATA 
23 
Originally, chips and other electrical components were inserted into sockets that had metal connections soldered into holes in the 
plastic board. This allowed a bad component 
I 
without resoldering, but the dependability of computer components 
has made that precaution largely unnecessary. 
kets are used almost exclusively to seat chips that can be replaced or 
upgraded to improve performance, such as 
ules and microprocessors. 
Capacitors and 
resistors stabilize the 
flow of current and half 
remove static and elec-
trical surges or drops. 
Traces end at metal connections 
on chips, resistors, capacitors, or 
cable connections. On expansion 
boards, some traces lead to edge 
connectors, often made of gold to 
resist tarnish. These connectors 
allow the daughterboards to be 
inserted into sockets on the moth-
erboard. 
Some circuit boards have 
dip switches or jumper 
pins. A dip switch is a 
minuscule rocker switch 
that turns a circuit trace off 
or on. A jumper is a small 
piece of plastic-encased 
metal that completes a cir-
cuit. Electricity can flow 
through it when the jumper 
is placed across two metal 
pins sticking out of the cir-
cuit board. Dip switches 
and jumpers are used to 
make a board work prop-
erly in different configura-
tions, such as differing 
amounts of memory. 
Chips not likely to be 
replaced are usually 
surface mounted. The 
metal leads coming 
out of the chips are 
soldered directly to 
the traces that carry 
signals to and from 
the chips, forgoing 
both sockets and the 
holes into which the 
sockets were 
attached. This preci-
sion mounting of chips 
is usually done by 
robot machinery. 
Pin connectors are used by ribbon cables-wide, flat 
collections of wires joined together-for internal connec-
tions between circuit boards and disk drives.

How the Motherboard Brings It All Together 
Memory Slots: Current slots support 
either DDR (184 pins) or DDR2 RAM 
(240 pins), which is now the more pop-
ular type of memory. Slots usually come 
two or four to a board, and are often 
color-coded to tell you where to place 
matching memory cards. Look for DDR3 
to start appearing in systems in 2008. 
Power Supply Connections: Older boards 
have only one 20-pin connector. Boards that 
used specific iterations of the AMD Athlon 64 
and Pentium 4 processors have a second 
power connection near the CPU socket. More 
modern systems, like those based on the Intel 
IDE Connector: Connects to two 
EIDE/ ATA hard drives and optical dri-
ves using the older parallel connection . 
(See "How a Parallel Port Works, 
p.234.) 
CPU Socket: This 
determines what kind of 
microprocessor, or central 
processing unit (CPU), the 
motherboard uses. Boards are 
designed to work with processors made 
by either Intel or AMD. Motherboards 
do not work with all CPUs from the same 
company. The socket and board must be 
designed for specific lines of microprocessors and 
must have the right shape and number of holes for 
the chip's pins to fit. 
Bus: To send data to any of the other motherboard 
components-a write operation-the microprocessor, or another 
component, raises the voltages of a combination of 24 of the traces 
that make up the address bus. This combination of traces, or lines, 
is the unique address of something on the internal bus, such as a 
location in memory; one of the components located on the mother-
board itself, such as expansion cards inserted in the board's add-in 
slots; or a device, such as a disk drive on the external bus, also 
called the expansion bus. 
The processor puts the data it wants to write on a bank of electrical 
traces, the data bus, by raising the voltages on some to represent 
ones and leaving voltages unchanged on others to represent zeros. 
Other lines are used to pass control signals for common specific 
commands, such as read and write commands for memory and each 
input/output device. 
The Motherboard: As its name implies, the motherboard is the unit-
ing element among all the chips and circuitry that make up a computer. 
Devices communicate with each other through the motherboard's cir-
cuits, from which they also draw their power. Motherboards come in 
different form factors that align the board with different sizes and 
styles of computer cases. They also come with different sockets that 
determine what types of chips and expansion boards they can 
accept. 
North Bridge: The North Bridge and South Bridge 
together form the computer's chip set, secondary only to 
the processor in determining the performance and capa-
bilities of a Pc. The North Bridge chip either provides or 
controls the computer's graphics, RAM, and the front 
side bus, the main highway for data connecting graph-
ics and memory to the CPU. 

CHAPTER 2 
HOW CIRCUITS JUGGLE DATA 
25 
Battery: It keeps the BIOS 
chip alive. 
Connectors: Each connector, or header, is designed for the newer serial-ATA hard drives, provid-
ing faster delivery of drive data. These will eventually entirely replace IDE connections on most boards. (See 
" How a Serial Port Works," p. 236.) 
BIOS: When you turn on your computer, this is the first component to come to life, providing 
enough code to wake up the rest of the hardware. It also contains code to support specific 
types of processors, drives, and other functions that might need updating occasionally. 
Ports: An input/output panel holds 
the miscellaneous ports on the back and 
front of the PC that are used for communi-
cating with external devices. (Notice the 
lack of serial or parallel ports, which used 
to be standard. If they are needed for 
your computer's peripherals, they can be 
added with an expansion card .) Audio 
input/output ports are often part of the 
panel, although this board has a separate 
panel for them . 
Port 80 Display: A two-digit display provides codes used in trou-
bleshooting a disabled Pc. These displays are not found on all 
motherboards. 
South Bridge: The other half of the PC chip set, the 
South Bridge is in charge of input/output with the 
disk drives, audio, networking, universal 
serial port, and Firewire communica-
Front Panel 
Connectors: 
Wires from these 
lead to the front 
of the PC for the 
on/off switch, reset switch, 
power light, and hard drive light. 
Expansion Slots: Additional capabilities can be added to the computer by plugging 
a circuit board called an expansion card in one of the slots. The design of the slots 
has changed over the years. The legacy PCI slot is the most common, used for func-
tions that do not require great quantities or speed in data transmissions. Because all 
devices, except for an accelerated graphics port (AGP-not shown here) are on 
the same buses, they all receive the same signals on the data and control buses. The 
memory controller, expansion cards, and other input/output devices along the bus con-
stantly monitor the command lines. When a signal appears on the write command line, 
for example, all the input/output devices recognize the command. The devices, alerted 
by the write command, turn their attention to the address lines. If the address specified 
on those lines is not the address used by a device, it ignores the signals sent on the 
data lines. 
If the signals on the address lines match the address used by the adapter, the adapter 
accepts the data sent on the address lines and uses that data to complete the write 
command. 
The accelerated graphics port is being pushed aside by the newer PC I-Express 
slots, which come in several denominations to make them the do-all, fit-all slot for every 
expansion board, not just graphics. The shorter ones here are xl PCI-E shots and are 
common to all PCI Express slots. To handle graphics and sound data faster, the PCI-E 
slot can be expanded to x4, x8, or, shown here, x16 slots, where the numbers repre-
sent multiples of the speed of an xl PCI-E slot. Their ability to move data is indicated 
by the multiplier factor in their designations. 

26 
BOOT-UP PROCESS 
How the North and South Bridge 
Move Traffic 
The personal computer has become so complex that even the most recent, powerful processors can 't do the entire job of managing the flow 
of data by themselves. The CPU has been given help in the form of the chip set, located nearby on the motherboard. The chip set tradi-
tionally consists of two microchips, often referred to as the North Bridge and the South Bridge, that act as the administrators to the 
CPU, or chief executive. The chip set bridges logical and physical gaps between the CPU and other chips, all the time watching and con-
trolling the input and output of specific components . The exact function of the chip set is constantly changing. The bridges have been put 
into one chip and in some designs, the CPU reclaims some functions. But in all cases, the bridges determine what kinds of memory, proces-
sors, and other components can work with that particular motherboard. There is an unfortunate trend to replace the names North Bridge 
and South Bridge with less elegant terms such as Graphics Memory Controller Hub (GMCH) and the I/O Controller Hub (ICH), 
even though their basic purpose is the same. For our purposes here, we'll stick to the more seemly bridge nomenclature. 
The North Bridge 
You can distinguish the North Bridge because it 
resides as close as possible to three other compo-
nents that get special attention from the chip: the 
CPU, the memory, and the graphics port. 
Although for something operating at the speed of 
light, you wouldn 't think that a difference of a 
couple of inches could matter. But 
when you're counting in nanosec-
onds-billionths of a second-even 
small differences make themselves felt. 
A crucial mechanism in the North Bridge is 
the memory controller, which constantly renews 
the memory modules (RAM). These modules contain 
memory cells, each made of a transistor and capaci-
tor. (See " How a Transistor Works," p. xxx.) Each cell 
with an electrical charge represents a 1 bit. Because the 
charge begins to dissipate as soon as it's created, the bridge's 
memory controller endlessly, thousands of times a second, reads 
each of the millions of cells and writes back the values it read. 
When the CPU needs data from RAM, it sends 
a request to the North Bridge memory con-
troller. The controller, in turn, sends the request 
along to memory and tells the CPU how long 
the processor must wait to read the memory 
over a speedy connection called the front 
side bus (FSB). 
The North Bridge is also 
the liaison with the other 
component for which speed is 
crucial : the video card. (Some 
chip sets have video, sound, or 
other functions built into them, but on-
chip video is not as fast as a dedi-
cated expansion card .) 

----'c 
Previously the North Bridge worked 
with the accelerated graphics port 
(AGP), providing a quick transfer of 
bitmaps from RAM to the AGP card's 
own memory. Now, however, the still 
faster PCI-Express (PCI-E) interface is 
replacing AGP video as you'll see 
when you turn the page. 
Some South Bridge chips incorporate 
audio capabilities good enough to 
support Dolby Digital and THX multi-
media audio. 
CHAPTER 2 
HOW CIRCUITS JUGGLE DATA 
27 
The South Bridge 
The remaining connection of the North Bridge is 
to the South Bridge, ICH, or Input/Output Bridge, 
as the case may be. 
The South Bridge primarily handles the routing of traffic 
between the various input/output (I/O) devices on the 
system for which speed is not vital to the total perfor-
mance, such as the disk drives (including RAID drive 
arrays), optical drives, PCI-Express devices, the older 
PCI bus, and the USB, Ethernet, and audio ports. It is 
also responsible for less prominent input/output, such as 
the real-time clock, interrupt controller, and power man-
agement. The remaining slowpokes of the computer-
the keyboard, the serial ports, and the mouse-are 
handled by a separate device called the 510 for super 
input/ output. 
---,,.---- PCI- E 
expansion 
card 
Although South Bridge input/output is leisurely com-
pared to that of the North Bridge, the frenzied electron 
traffic in both generates enough heat to require some 
sort of cooling device, such as a fan or heat sink, to 
stop the chips from overheating.

I· · . I BOOT-UP PROCESS 
How Pel-Express 
Breaks the Bus Barrier 
New computer applications, such as streaming video and photo editing, put new demands on PCs to move vast 
amounts of data ever quicker. Until recently, our PCs were bogged down as data was trundled among compo-
nents by outdated buses-the peripheral components interconnect (PCI) and the accelerated graphics 
port (AGP) . Even the fastest of them, AGP, which spewed out 2 .134 gigabytes a second, 
couldn't keep up with the demands of real-time-photorealistic animation that 
needs values for the colors of millions of pixels pushed through the 
circuits 60 times or more each second. The solution is a 
bus arch itecture that uses both parallel and 
serial transfers. It's called PCI-
Express, or PCI-E. 
A PCI-Express bus breaks all data 
it handles into pieces and wraps the 
pieces in a packet. The packet 
includes other binary codes that identify 
where the information has come from, 
where it's headed, its sequence among all the 
other packets being sent, and the results of a 
cyclic redundancy check (CRC). A CRC is a 
mathematical operation that acts as fingerprint for 
the data. For more information on packet communi-
cations, see "How Packets Divvy Up Data" p. 316. 
As with the older PCI bus, the two components in 
the motherboard's chip set work together to 
shepherd data among peripherals. The part of the 
chip set referred to as the North Bridge contin-
ues to be the chip that rushes packets to the CPU 
and RAM, the components for which speed is 
most critical. It has traditionally passed less urgent 
packets to the South Brid e for handlin . 

CHAPTER 2 
------Elln a PCI-Express bus, the South Bridge continues its relatively unheroic job of 
dribbling data to the pokey hard drives, USB connections, and legacy PCI 
cards. But now the South Bridge feeds packets to components, such as video 
cards, that are data speed freaks. It does so by using dedicated serial cir-
cuits for each component, simultaneous back-and-forth transmission, and 
parallel routes for its serial signals. 
HOW CIRCUITS JUGGLE DATA 
29 
The chip set sends packets serially over two lines. Another pair of lines is responsible for packets 
going in the opposite directions. Taken together, the two pairs are called a lane. One of the lines 
in each pair carries the original signal. The other line carries a negative image of the signal; each 
o becomes a 1 and each 1 becomes a O. The lines are laid out so that any electrical noise, or sta-
tic, that affects one line should also affect the other. 
When packets reach their destination, the receiver 
restores the negative packet to its positive version. 
That same operation reverses the values of any 
junk signals introduced by electrical interference. 
The bus combines the two paired packets, and 
any interference in the original packet is canceled 
by its negative image in the matching packet. 
It also performs the same CRC operation that was 
performed on the packet before its journey and 
compares its result to the earlier one bun-
dled into the packet. If CRCs differ, the 
bus orders the packet be re-sent. 
Because the seguence of the 
data in each packet is 
included in the packet, 
the bus doesn't have to wait 
for the corrected packet. It can con-
tinue to accept other packets and shoehorn 
the corrected data into its proper place in line 
when it arrives.

After subtracting the overhead for packet packaging, the basic PCI-Express slot has a top bandwidth 
of 250 megabytes a second. But PCI-E is scalable. Devoting two or more lanes to send data to and 
from a single component-called channel bonding-increases the bandwidth for each lane 
added to the channel. PCI-E transfers data at 250MB a second in each direction per lane. With a 
maximum of 32 lanes, PCI-E allows for a total combined transfer rate of 8GB a second in each direc-
tion. That gives a single channel nearly twice the bandwidth of the older PCI and an eight lane slot a 
data rate comparable to the fastest version of AGP. You can identify the expansion slots with the 
increased bandwidth by comparing the slots' lengths. The basic PCI-E slot is about 24.5mm long. 
Each 13.5mm added to other slots represents another 250MB added to their bandwidth. 
Goodbye to the Party Line 
In the older PCI bus, all the devices share the same parallel circuits and receive the same data. The data 
includes an identifier that says which device the signals are destined for. All other devices simply ignore 
them. But like telephone users on a party line, the components can't receive data while some other device 
monopolizes the connection. The links in PCI-E are point-to-point. The South Bridge uses a crossbar 
switch to route incoming signals from one point to another down circuit lines dedicated to specific com-
ponents. Data goes to several components at the same time. It's like talking on a private, single-line phone.

CHAPTER 3 
HOW A PC COMES ALIVE 
31 
A personal computer can't do anything useful unless it's running an operating system-a basic type 
of software, such as Microsoft Windows, that acts as a supervisor for all the applications, games, or 
other programs you use. The operating system sets the rules for using memory, drives, and other parts of 
the computer. But before a PC can run an operating system, it needs some way to load the operating sys-
tem from disk to random access memory (RAM). The way to do this is with the bootstrap--a small 
amount of code that's a permanent part of the PC, or simply to boot. 
The bootstrap is aptly named because it lets the PC do something entirely on its own, without any 
outside operating system. Of course, the boot operation doesn't do much. In fact, it has only two func-
tions: one is to run a POST, or power-on self-test, described on the next page of this chapter, and 
the other is to search drives for an operating system. When these functions are complete, the boot opera-
tion launches the process of reading the system files and copying them to random access memory. 
Why do PCs use such a roundabout arrangement? Why not simply make the operating system a part 
of the PC? A few low-end or specialized computers do this. Early computers used primarily for playing 
games, such as the Atari 400 and 800, and the more recent palm-sized PCs, have a permanent operat-
ing system. But in most cases, the operating system is loaded from hard disk for two reasons. 
Upgrading the operating system is simpler when loading from a disc, be it a CD, as in Windows XP, 
or DVD as is the case with Windows Vista. When a company such as Microsoft-which made MS-DOS 
and now makes Windows, the most commonly used PC operating system-wants to significantly revamp 
its OS, usually by adding new features or fixing serious bugs, it can simply issue a disc. Clearly, it's 
cheaper for Microsoft to distribute an operating system on disc than to design a microchip that contains 
the operating system. And it's easier for computer users to install a new operating system from disc than 
it is to swap chips. 
The other reason for loading an operating system from disc is that it gives users a choice of operat-
ing systems. Although most PCs based on microprocessors built by Intel use Windows, there are alterna-
tive operating systems, such Linux. In some PC setups, you can even choose which of the operating 
systems to use each time you turn on your computer. We'll use Windows here because it's the most 
widely used operating system in the world.

BOOT-UP PROCESS 
How the 
Power-On 
Self-Test 
Gets Your 
PC Started 
~ 
When you turn on your PC, most of 
the electric ity rushes off to warm up 
the components that will be called 
on in a few seconds to send, 
receive, slice, hash, squeeze, and 
memorize bits and bytes of data 
rushing through the system like a 
busy terminal in time-lapse. Amid 
this tremendous surge to power, 
one narrow stream of electricity fol-
lows the only channel it can, the 
same permanently programmed 
path it has followed each time the 
computer came to life. 
The familiar path takes the current 
to the CPU, or microprocessor, 
which is the brains, boss, and bully 
enforcer of the entire system. There 
the electrical signal clears leftover 
data from the chip's internal 
memory registers. The signal 
also places a specific hexa-
decimal number, FOOO, into 
one of the CPU's digital notepads, a 
register called the program counter. 
Like the next clue in a treasure hunt, whatever 
number is in the program counter tells the CPU the memory 
address of the next instruction it needs to process. In this case, 
it's the first instruction, and the address is located on a flash 
memory chip on the computer's motherboard. This chip 
holds a few small programs and some of the settings that 
determine how your 
computer works. 
All together, 
they're called 
the BIOS 
because they are 
fundamental to the 
computer's basic 
input/ output 
system. 

CHAPTER 3 
The first trickle of electricity has done its job. Now the BIOS takes over the 
task of awakening the computer's components, giving them a pop quiz called 
the power-on self-test (POST) to make sure the necessary parts of the 
computer are present and functioning 
rly. It's while the POST is being 
administered that you may hear 
rious churnings from your drives 
and see some LEDs flash, 
but the screen, at first, remains 
black. 
HOW A PC COMES ALIVE 
33 
The BIOS has the CPU send signals over 
the system bus to be sure all of the basic 
components are functioning. The bus 
includes the electrical circuits printed on 
and into the motherboard, connecting all 
the components with each other. 
The BIOS first checks 
a small, 64-byte chunk 
of RAM located on a 
complementary metal 
oxide 
The POST tests the memory contained on the display adapter and the 
video signals that control the display. It then makes the adapter's BIOS 
code a part of the system's overall BIOS and memory configuration. 
This is the first point you'll see something appear on your PC's monitor. 
semiconductor(CMOS) chip that is kept alive by a battery even when 
the computer is off. The CMOS contains the official record of which com-
ponents are installed in your system. As the BIOS continues the POST, it 
uses that information as a check against the response it receives. 
Before inspecting other 
parts of the components, the 
BIOS and CPU check to 
make sure they're working 
m The BIOS checks to see if it's engaged in a cold boot, meaning the com-
puter had been turned off, or if it's a warm boot, or reboot, by check-
ing the value at memory address 0000:0472. If it finds the number 
1234, the BIOS knows this is a reboot and skips the rest of the POST. 
right. The BIOS instructs the CPU to read 
code stored at various locations and compares what it 
finds to identical records stored permanently in the BIOS 
chip set. 
The BIOS loads into memory the device drivers and interrupt 
handlers from the basic hardware in the system, such as the key-
board, mouse, hard drive, and floppy drive. Whenever you press a 
key, the keyboard generates a code specific to that key, and the 
device driver translates the code as needed for the CPU to under-
stand it. The interrupt handlers are responsible for bringing the 
CPU's attention to the code waiting for the microprocessor. 
To be sure all the PC's operations function in a synchro-
nized, orderly fashion, the CPU also checks the system's 
timer, or real-time clock, which is responsible for 
pacing signals. 
For a cold boot, the BIOS runs a series of 
tests to ensure that the RAM chips are 
function ing properly. The tests write 
data to each chip, and then read 
it and compare what they 
read with the data sent to 
the chips in the first 
place. At this point 
on some PCs, 
you'll see a 
running 
account of the 
amount of memory 
that's been checked 
on the monitor. 
The POST sends signals over specific paths on the 
bus to the internal floppy, optical, and hard 
disk drives, and listens for a response to 
determine which drives are available. 
That ends the POST and the BIOS transfers 
control of the PC to the operating system on 
the hard disk, a process called the boot.

BOOT-UP PROCESS 
How a Disk Boot Wakes Up Your PC 
After conducting a POST check of all the hardware compo-
nents of a PC, the boot program contained on the computer's 
ROM BIOS tells the processor to execute a program con-
tained in the C: hard drive's boot sector (or the CD-ROM or 
floppy disk if there's no boot sector of the hard drive). That 
code, NTLDR (NT loaDeR), tells the processor where to 
find more code on the drive.

On a Windows XP system, that code is NTDETECT.COM, 
which displays the Windows XP splash screen before 
making a list of all the system's hardware it recognizes. 
NTDETECT displays the list onscreen and passes it along to 
the Windows Registry, where other programs have access 
to the information. 
With its drive support loaded, Windows XP then loads

CHAPTER 3 
HOW A PC COMES ALIVE 
35 
A computer is only a collection of millions of possibilities until it has an operating system (OS). The collection of rules and instructions 
in an operating system make the computer a Windows XP or Vista machine, a Linux computer, a Windows 98 PC, or even an MS-DOS 
computer. Whatever flavor of OS goes into a computer takes over the PC like a binary body snatcher. For this explanation, we're going 
to assume the operating system taking hold in the computer drive's boot sector is Windows XP. 
El The Registry takes some of the chores of booting the system off 
NTLDR's back. The Registry loads several low-level programs 
into memory. These are programs working at the most basic 
machine level to control the hardware. This is when those prole-
tariat programs help Windows XP expand the machine's artifi-
cial consciousness by loading still other programs that Windows 
quickly assimilates as parts of an operating system. 
Next to join the mixture are services. These are 
essential services, such as disk defragging and parti-
tion management. Other services, such as remote 
access, might have no appeal for some PC users. 
With enough files located to handle basic hardware opera-
tions, Windows begins another survey of components, this 
time loading Plug and Play's enumerator. (See p. 42 for 
more on PnP.) This process also loads drivers for the PCI 
bus and those of the older ISA bus, should the computer 
have one.

CHAPTER 4 
HOW AN OPERATING SYSTEM CONTROLS HARDWARE 
37 
OPERATING systems were originally developed to handle one of the most complex input/output 
operations: communicating with a variety of disk drives. This is evidenced by the names given to early 
operating systems, which often contained the acronym DOS, for disk operating system. Eventually, the 
operating system quickly evolved into an all-encompassing bridge between your PC and the software you 
run on it. 
Without an operating system, such as Windows, each programmer would have to invent from scratch 
the way a program displays text or graphics onscreen, how it sends data to the printer, how it reads or 
writes disk files, and how it implements other functions that mesh software with hardware. An operating 
system, however, is more than a way to make life easier for programmers. 
An operating system creates a common platform for all the software you use. Without an operating 
system, you might not be able to save files created by two different programs to the same disk because 
each might have its own storage format. An operating system also gives you a tool for all the tasks you 
want to perform outside an application program: deleting and copying files to disk, printing, and running 
a collection of commands in a batch file. 
The operating system does not work alone. It depends not only on the cooperation of other programs, 
but also on meshing smoothly with the BIOS and software drivers. The BIOS-or basic input/output sys-
tem-is made of code contained on chips in a Pc. It acts as the intermediary among the hardware, 
processor, and operating systems. Device drivers are like a specialized BIOS. Drivers translate commands 
from the operating system and BIOS into instructions for a specific piece of hardware, such as a printer, 
scanner, or DVD-ROM drive. When some parts of the operating system are loaded from disk, they are 
added to the BIOS and then joined by device drivers, and all of them carry out routine hardware func-
tions. The operating system is really composed of all three of these components, plus scores of other pro-
grams, common code, and data files. 
Together, the BIOS, device drivers, and Windows perform so many functions that it's impossible to 
depict their complexity with a couple of pages of illustrations. Here we'll show how the operating system 
and Plug and Play work, how a PC's software and hardware components work together, and how hard-
ware interrupts whatever software is doing to get some attention from the processor.

Operating System Checklist 
On older systems, if the disk 
drive is one for which the BIOS 
maintains a specifically tailored 
set of instructions, the BIOS 
itself sends the instructions 
along with the data to the mech-
anism that controls the disk 
drive. On new systems, the 
BIOS is more likely to 
the instructions from the 
device driver. 
-
PI 
In the early days of personal computers, only a few dozen 
hard drives existed that could be used in a Pc. But the drives 
had mechanical and electronic differences; One might've had 
twice the capacity, more speed, or used platters that were an 
odd size compared to another. Because there were so few dri-
ves, IBM and the companies that cloned the original PC 
included instructions in the computer's BIOS chip for every 
hard drive that someone was likely to install. This, of course, 
was not a long-term solution. As the number of hard drives 
evolved as rapidly as fruit flies, their instructions outgrew the 
capacity of the BIOS. The solution was device drivers, 
coded instructions for a specific hardware peripheral con-
tained in a file and copied to the computer when that device is 
installed. The device can also be a mouse, printer, keyboard, 
or any other equipment that needs custom handling, and each 
drive is tailored for a specific brand, size, and design of what-
ever hardware it's written for. The device driver has an impor-
tant role when, for example, you save a document. 

CHAPTER 4 
HOW AN OPERATING SYSTEM CONTROLS HARDWARE 
El 
When you tap a key or click an icon to save a word processing file, the software, which con-
tains virtually no code for dealing directly with a disk drive, hands off the command to the 
operating system, usually Windows. The operating system checks to be sure that there are 
no problems with the command to save the data. For example, it makes sure that the filename is 
a legal one-that it does not contain any forbidden characters such as * and ?-and that 
you're not trying to save a file with the same name as a file marked read-only. 
If everything is on the up and up, the operating system checks whether 
operation requires a device driver; these days it almost always does. Most 
drivers are loaded when the operating system is loaded, and become seam-
less extensions of the BIOS. For this save operation, Windows simply turns 
over the nitty-gritty job of saving the document to the BIOS and the driver. 
The controller mechanism trans-
lates the instructions from the 
BIOS/driver into the electrical sig-
nals that move the drive's 
read/write heads to the proper 
locations on the disk and that cre-
ate the magnetic signals to record 
the document's data onto the disk's 
surface.

How Hardwar 
CPU 
hat to 
A CPU is the old woman who lived in a shoe of 
computing. This mother didn't know what to do 
because she didn't devise a method of responding 
to the demands of all her children . She could have 
borrowed one of two methods from computing: 
polling and interrupts. With polling, she would 
have gone from child to child endlessly, asking if 
she could do anything for them . If one needed 
something, the other children would have to wait 
until that task was completed, even if they had an 
urgent need to use the bathroom . Not very efficient. 
With interrupts, Mother would go about her work 
until a child tugs at her apron, asking for some-
thing. The interruption gets her immediate attention, 
at least until another child needs something. In com-
puters, as in shoe houses, interrupts are the pre-
ferred method of handling requests from software 
and hardware. 
When you press the A key, an electrical 
signal travels along a circuit, which serves 
to identify what key you pressed, to the 
keyboard controller. 
The keyboard interrupt arrives on one of 16 
interrupt request (IRQ) lines. Seven of 
the IRQs monitor specific components, such 
as the keyboard controller. 
The controller relays a signal to a subsystem 
called the interrupt controller, which acts 
as chief-of-staff, running interference between 
the CPU and the 256 possible kinds of inter-
rupts that clamor for the CPU's attention . 
The other interrupt circuits keep an eye on the 
input/output bus, which includes the com-
puter's expansion slots. More than one expan-
sion cord on the Peripheral Component 
Interconnect (PCI) and PCI-Express slots can 
use the same IRQ because the requests are 
managed by the Plug-and-Play function. 
The interrupt controller sends a signal to one of 
the pins sticking out of the bottom of the CPU 
called the INTR, used for normal interrupt sig-
nals. (There'S 0150 a pin called NMI, for non-
maskable interrupt. INTRs can be interrupted 
by other interrupts; NMls, such as the one gen-
erated by pressing Ctrl+AIt+Del, can't.) 
The CPU puts whatever it was doing on hold. 
This takes the form of a memory address writ-
ten to a stack. The address is akin to a book-
mark, later reminding the CPU where it left off 
its previous task. 

S HARDWARE 
41 
The CPU checks another pin 
to find out what key you 
pressed. But rather than dis-
play the letter for that key 
on the screen, the CPU 
checks a section of memory 
called the interrupt 
descriptor table (lOT). 
Specifically, the CPU per-
forms the instructions at one 
of the IDr's locations associ-
ated with the A key. Like the 
next clue in a treasure hunt, 
the instructions, called an 
interrupt service rou-
tine (ISR), tell the CPU 
what to do when someone 
presses the A key. This 
allows programmers to 
replace the normal instruc-
tions (display an A) with 
operations peculiar to a 
program. In a game, for 
example, pressing the A 
key could make a character 
move to the left, W to make 
the character move up, and 
so on. 
When the ISR completes its 
job, it sends a return from 
interrupt (RET) instruction 
to the CPU. That tells the 
CPU it is free to return to 
whatever it was doing 
before it was interrupted. 
The CPU pulls the last mem-
ory location it had been 
working with off the stack 
and processes the next 
instructions from that 
address.

BOOT-UP PROCESS 
How Plug and Play Works 
Sound card 
Video card 
The configuration manager in Windows adds to 
itself special device drivers called enumerators-
programs that act as the interface between the oper-
ating system and the different devices. There are bus 
enumerators, enumerators for a special type of bus 
called SCSI (small computer system interface), port 
enumerators, and more. Windows asks each enu-
merator to identify which devices the enumerator is 
going to control and what resources it needs. 
When you turn on a Plug-and-Play system, the primary arbitra-
tor between Windows and hardware-the BIOS-is the first 
component to take charge. The BIOS searches for all devices it 
needs-such as a video card, keyboard, and floppy drive-so 
the PC can run properly. The BIOS identifies these devices 
based on their unique identifiers, which are codes that are 
burned permanently into the devices' ROM, or read-only mem-
ory. The BIOS then passes control to the operating system.

CHAPTER 4 
HOW AN OPERATING SYSTEM CONTROLS HARDWARE 
Windows takes the information from the enu-
merators and stores it in the hardware tree, 
which is a database stored in RAM. The 
operating system then examines the hard-
ware tree for resource arbitration. In

database, the operating system decides 
resources-interrupts (IRQs), for exam-

then tells the enumerators what resources it 
allocated to their respective devices. The enu-
merators save the resource allocation infor-
mation in the peripherals' microscopic 
programmable registers, which are like digi-
tal scratch pads located in some chips.

Finally, the operating system searches for the appropriate device driver for each 
device. A device driver is a small piece of code for Windows that tells the operating sys-
tem the facts about a piece of hardware with which the system needs to com-
municate. If the system doesn't find a device driver it needs, it prompts 
you to install it. The system then loads all necessary device drivers and 
tells each driver which resources its device is using. The device 
drivers initialize their respective devices, and the 
system finishes booting.

How the Registry Knows It All 
If you just want a passing idea of how complex Windows is, take a 
look at the Windows Registry. If you're not sure how to do that, 
don't even think the word registry until you learn more about it. In 
the Registry, you' ll find 90-something percent of the filenames, 
paths, parameters, programs, and patches that keep the operating 
system running without a hitch. Here's just a hint of what you'll 
encounter. 
The Windows Registry is a hierarchical database of configu-
ration settings that controls all aspects of how Windows 
looks and works. When you use a menu to change 
Windows in some way (for example, deciding to use the 
classic Start menu or the newer style Windows Start menu), 
you're actually making a change to the Registry. Many of 
the menus and dialog boxes you use to configure Windows 
and Windows programs are only front ends to protect you 
from having to stare direcrly into the maw of the beast. 
~ _ 
_ 
O
K 
Dau 
El The Registry is organized in a hierarchical manner, with keys at the top, 
subkeys beneath them, and still more values beneath them. At the very 
top of the Registry are five root keys that each controls a different aspect 
of how Windows works: 
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT (HKCR)-The settings under this root 
key contain information about file types and filename extensions. 
The settings tell Windows how to handle files, and they control basic 
interface options, such as double-clicking and context menus. 
HKEY _CURRENT_USER (HKCU)-These control the settings of the 
user currently logged into Windows. They control the current user's 
Desktop, as well as Vista's or XP's appearance and behavior They 
manage network connections, connections to devices such as printers, 
and display personal preferences. Also included are Security 
Identifiers (SIDs) that identify users of the PC and have information 
about each user's rights, settings, and preferences. 
In some instances, 
you can't make 
changes to 
Windows without 
directly editing the 
Registry using a 
built-in Windows 
tool called the 
Registry Editor 
(Regedit if you using 
it from a run com-
mand). 
"---------- HKEY _LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM)-These settings track the computer, its 
hardware, and the operating system. They include specific details about all hard-
ware, including the keyboard, printer ports, and storage devices. They also con-
tain information about security, installed software, system startup, drivers, 
services, and the machine's specific Vista or XP configuration. They affect every 
user who logs onto the computer. 
HKEY_USERS (HKU)-These keys control the user-by-user settings Windows uses to dis-
pia)' the default desktop-the desktop that displays before anyone logs on~s well as user 
profiles. It contains information about every user profile on the system. 
HKEY _CURRENT _ CON FIG (HKCC)-These settings control configuration of the current hardware 
profile. It contains information about the hardware configuration in the same way that HKEY _ CUR-
RENT_USER contains information about the current user of the system.

REG_SZ (string value)-This data type is made up 
of plain text and numbers and is one of the most com-
mon data types in the Registry. For example, the key 
DoubleClickSpeed determines the amount of time 
between mouse clicks that must elapse before Windows 
won't consider it a double-click. 
REG_MULTI_SZ (string array value)-This data 
type contains several strings of plain text and numbers. 
The Registry Editor enables you to edit these values, but 
won't let you create them. 
REG_EXPAND_SZ (expanded string value)-
This data type contains variables that Windows uses to 
point to file locations. For example, the expanded string 
value used to point to the location of the Aero theme 
file, which gives Vista its glassy transparency, is 
%SystemRoot% \resources \ Themes \Aero \Aero.msstyles. 
REG_DWORD (DWORD values)-This data 
Individual keys and subkeys control every aspect of how 
Windows works. As a way to control the computer and 
Windows, a key uses one and sometimes more than one 
value. The five primary data types of values are: 
type is represented as a number. Sometimes 0 furns 
on the key or 1 furns off the key, although other num-
L-___ bers can be used as well. Although you see and edit 
the value as a number, the Registry itself views the 
number as a hexadecimal number. 
To change or create a Windows Vista or XP setting, you need 
to know the proper Registry key or subkey and the correct 
value for the change you want to make. For example, if you 
want to change the Places, the shortcuts to often used folders 
that are displayed to the left of Open and Save dialog boxes, 
you must find a Registry key at HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-

ate a new subkey, which I've named PlacesBar. Another right 
click there allows you to add subkeys for PlacesO through

HOW MICROCHIPS ARE THE PC'S BRAIN 
"But what ... is it good for?" 
-Engineer at the Advanced Computing Systems Division of IBM, 1968, 
commenting on the microchip 
THOMAS Edison in 1883 noticed that electrical current flowing through a light bulb's 
filament could make the wire so hot that electrons boiled off, sailing through the vacuum 
inside the bulb to a metal plate that had a positive charge. Because Edison didn't see any 
way the phenomenon would help him perfect the light bulb, he only made a notation of the 
effect, which he named after himself. The effect sat on the shelf until 1904, when a former 
Edison employee, inventor John Fleming, went to work for the Marconi Radio Company. 
For his first assignment, finding a better way to receive distant radio signals, Fleming 
began experimenting with the Edison effect. He discovered that radio waves passing 
through an airless tube created a varying direct current, which could be used with head-
phones to reproduce the sound carried by the waves. Fleming named it the oscillation valve 
and applied for a patent. Marconi, though, chose another, less expensive technology: a 
crystal wave detector. 
The discoveries sat on the shelf until radio pioneer Lee DeForest read about Fleming's 
valve and built one himself. The valve he created in 1906 had something new: a grid 
made of nickel wire placed between the filament and the plate. Applying even a small elec-
trical charge to the grid disrupted the flow of electrons from the filament to the plate. It was 
the beginning of the vacuum tube, which essentially let a small amount of electrical current 
control a much larger flow of current. 
If you're not at least old enough to be part of the baby boom generation, you might 
never have seen more than one type of vacuum tube-the cathode ray tube (CRT) that dis-
plays images on desktop PC monitors and the ordinary TV screen. Except for CRTs-and in 
the sound systems of audiophiles who swear vacuum tube amplifiers are better than transis-
torized amps-vacuum tubes are rarely used in modern electronics. It isn't the amplifying 
capabilities of the vacuum tube that have made it one of the seminal discoveries of science; 
It is the vacuum tube's capability to act as a switch. When a small amount of current was 
applied to the grid, it turned off a much stronger current. Turn off the electricity going to the 
grid, and the larger current is switched back on. On, off. Off, on. Simple .

OVERVIEW

Essentially, a computer is just a collection of onloff switches, 
which at first doesn't seem very useful. But imagine a large array of 
light bulbs-say, 10 rows that each have 100 light bulbs in them. 
Each bulb is connected to a light switch. If you turn on the right 
combination of switches, you can put your name in lights. 
Computers are similar to that bank of lights, with one important 
difference: A computer can sense which light bulbs are on and use 
that information to turn on other switches. If the pattern of on 
switches spells "Tom/' the computer could be programmed to asso-
ciate the Tom pattern with instructions to turn on another group of 
switches to spell "boy." If the pattern spells" Mary/' the computer 
could turn on a different group of switches to spell "girl. " 
The two-pronged concept of On and Off maps perfectly with 
the binary number system, which uses only 0 and 1 to represent all 
numbers. By manipulating a roomful of vacuum tubes, early com-
puter engineers could perform binary mathematical calculations. By 
assigning alphanumeric characters to certain numbers, they could 
manipulate text. 
The problem with those first computers, however, was that the intense heat generated 
by the hundreds of vacuum tubes made them notoriously unreliable. The heat caused many 
components to deteriorate and consumed enormous amounts of power. But for vacuum 
tubes to work as switched, the tubes didn't really need to generate the immense flow of 
electrons that they created. A small flow would do quite nicely, but vacuum tubes were big. 
They worked on a human scale in which each part could be seen with the naked eye. They 
were simply too crude to produce more subtle flows of electrons. Transistors changed the 
way computers could be built. 
A transistor is essentially a vacuum tube built, not to human size, but on a micro-
scopic scale. Because it's small, a transistor requires less power to generate a flow of elec-
trons. Because it uses less power, a transistor generates less heat, making computers more 
dependable. And the microscopic scale of transistors means that a computer that once

THE transistor is the basic building block from which all microchips are built. The transistor can only 
create binary information: a 1 if current passes through, or a 0 if current doesn't pass through. From 
these 1 s and Os, called bits, a computer can create any number as long as it has enough transistors 
grouped together to hold all the 1 s and Os.

Personal computers, such as the original IBM PC and AT systems based on the Intel 8088 and 80286 micro-
processors, are 16-bit PCs. That means they can work directly with binary numbers of up to 16 places, or bits. That 
translates to the decimal number 65,535. If an operation requires numbers larger than that, the PC must first break 
those numbers into smaller components, perform the operation on each component, and then recombine the results 
into a single answer. More powerful PCs, such as those based on the Intel 80386, 80486, and Pentium, are 32-bit 
computers, which means they can manipulate binary numbers up to 32 bits wide-the equivalent in decimal notation 
of 4,294,967,295. The capability to work with 32 bits at a time helps make these PCs much faster and capable of 
directly using more memory. 
Transistors are not used simply to record and manipulate numbers. The bits can just as easily stand for true (1) or 
not true (0), which allows computers to deal with Boolean logic. ("Select this AND this but NOT this.") Combinations 
of transistors in various configurations are called logic gates, which are combined into arrays called half adders, 
which in turn are combined into full adders. More than 260 transistors are needed to create a full adder that can 
handle mathematical operations for 16-bit numbers. 
In addition, transistors make it possible for a small amount of electrical current to control a second, much stronger 
current-just as the small amount of energy needed to throw a wall switch can control the more powerful energy surg-
ing through the wires to give life to a spotlight. 

Creating a Chip from Transistors 
Thousands of transistors are connected on a single 
slice of silicon. The slice is embedded in a piece of 
plastic or ceramic material and the ends of the cir-
cuitryare attached to metal leads that expand to con-
nect the chip to other parts of a computer circuit 
board. The leads carry signals into the chip and send 
signals from the chip to other computer components. 


Software, in combination w ith 
the operating system, sends a 
burst of electricity along on 
address line, which is a 
microscopic strand of electrically 
conductive material etched onto 
a RAM chip. Each address line 
identifies the location of a spot 
in the chip where data can be 
stored. The burst of electricity 
identifies where to record data 
among the many address lines 
in a RAM chip. 
The electrical pulse turns on (closes) a transis-
tor that's connected to a data line at each 
memory location in a RAM chip where data 
can be stored. A transistor is essentially a 
microscopic electronic switch. 
While the transistors ore turned on, the softwore 
sends bursts of electricity along selected data 
lines. Each burst represents a 1 bit, in the 
native language of processors-the ultimate unit 
of information that a computer manipulates.

Reading Data from RAM 
When software wants to read data stored in 
RAM, another electrical pulse is sent along 
the address line, once again closing the 
transistors connected to it. 
Everywhere along the address line that there 
is a capacitor holding a chorge, the capaci-
tor will discharge through the circuit created 
by the closed transistors, sending electrical 
pulses along the data lines. 
The software recognizes from which data lines the pulses 
come and interprets each pulse as a 1. Any line on which 
a pulse is lacking indicates a O. The combination of 1 s 
and Os from eight data lines forms a single byte of data. 

CHAPTER 5 
HOW TRANSISTORS MANIPULATE DATA 
59 
The fastest processors are limited by how fast memory feeds them data. Traditionally, the way to 
pump out more data was to increase the clock speed. With each cycle, or tick, of the clock regulating 
operations in the processor and movement of memory data, SDRAM memory-the kind illustrated 
here-could store a value or move a value out and onto the data bus headed to the processor. But the 
speeds of processors outstripped that of RAM. Memory caught up to processors two ways. 
One is double data rate (DDR). Previously, a bit was written or read on each cycle of the clock. 
It's as if someone loaded cargo (writing data) onto a train traveling from Chicago to New York, 
unloaded that cargo (reading), and then had to send the empty train back to Chicago again, despite 
having fresh cargo in New York that could hitch along for the return trip. With DDR, a handler could 
unload that same cargo when the train arrives in New York and then load it back up with new cargo 
again before the train makes its journey back to Chicago. This way, the train is handling twice as 
much traffic (data) in the same amount of time. Substitute memory controller for the persons loading 
and unloading cargo and clock cycle for each round-trip of the train, and you have DDR. 
The other method is dual channel architecture-the 2 in DDR2 . With double data rates alone, 
there are times when no data is ready to be stored or read from memory locations. It's as if the train 
reached one end of its line and the handler there hadn't found any cargo to put on the train. Dual 
channel adds another pipeline to supply memory to help ensure there is data for the train .

CHAPTER 6 
HOW A MICROPROCESSOR WORKS 
63 
TH E 
easiest way to visualize how computers work is to think of them as enormous collections of 
switches, which is really what they are-switches in the form of microscopic transistors etched into a 
slice of silicon. But for the moment, think of a computer as a giant billboard made up of columns 
and rows of lights-thousands of them. Then imagine a control room behind that billboard in which 
there is a switch for everyone of the light bulbs on the sign. By turning on the correct switches, you 
can spell your name or draw a picture. 
But suppose there are "master switches" that control dozens of other switches. Instead of having 
to flip each switch individually for every light bulb that goes into spelling your name, you can throw 
one switch that lights up a combination of lights to create a B, then another master switch that turns 
on all the lights for an 0, and another switch to light up another B. 
Now you're very close to understanding how a computer works. In fact, substitute a computer 
display for the billboard, and substitute RAM-which is a collection of transistorized switches-for 
the control room, and a keyboard for the master switches, and you have a computer performing 
one of its most basic functions: displaying what you type onscreen. 
A computer must do a lot more than display words to be helpful. But the off and on positions of 
the same switches used to control a display can also add numbers by representing the 0 and 1 in 
the binary number system. If you can add numbers, you can perform any kind of math because mul-
tiplication is simply repeated addition, subtraction is adding a negative number, and division is 
repeated subtraction. To a computer, everything-math, words, numbers, and software instruc-
tions-is numbers. This fact lets all those switches (transistors) do all types of data manipulation. 
Actually, the first computers were more like our original billboard in how they were used. They 
didn't have keyboards or displays. The first computer users actually did throw a series of switches in 
a specific order to represent both data and the instructions for handling that data. Instead of transis-
tors, the early computers used vacuum tubes, which were bulky and generated an enormous amount 
of heat. To get the computer's answer, the people using it had to decipher what looked like a ran-
dom display of lights. Even with the most underpowered PC you can buy today, you still have it a lot 
better than the earliest computer pioneers. 
The Brains 
The microprocessor that makes up your personal computer's central processing unit, or CPU, is 
the ultimate computer brain, messenger, ringmaster, and boss. All the other components-RAM, disk 
drives, the display-exist only to bridge the gap between you and the processor. They take your 
data and turn it over to the processor to manipulate; then they display the results. The CPU isn't the 

64 
HOW MICROCHIPS ARE THE PC'S BRAIN 
only microprocessor in PCs. Coprocessors on graphics, 3D accelerators, and sound cards juggle 
display and sound data to relieve the CPU of part of its burden. And special processors, such as 
the one inside your keyboard that handles the signals generated whenever you press a key, per-
form specialized tasks designed to get data into or out of the CPU. 
The first processor in an IBM PC was Intel's 8088 (the CPU itself was a follow-up to Intel's 
8086). The generations of Intel processors that followed it were in the 80x86 family-80286, 
80386, and 80486. All were more elaborate versions of the original 8088, but improved on its 
performance by one of two ways: operating faster or handling more data simultaneously. The 
8088, for example, operated at 4.7MHz, or 4.7 million frequency waves a second; some 
80486 chips go as fast as 133MHz. The 8088 could handle 8 bits of data at a time, and the 
80486 handles 32 bits internally. 

CHAPTER 6 
HOW A MICROPROCESSOR WORKS 
6S 
Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are the only companies that make processors for 
Windows-based personal computers. The current standard for Intel processors is the Core 2 
chip, the most recent being the Core 2 Quad. The combined chips cover less than a couple of 
square inches but hold more than 582 million transistors. All the operations of the Core 2 are 
performed by signals turning on or off different combinations of those switches. In computers, 
transistors are used to represent zeros and ones, the two numbers that make up the binary num-
ber system. These zeros and ones are commonly known as bits. Various groupings of these tran-
sistors make up the subcomponents within the Core 2, as well as those in coprocessors, memory 
chips, and other forms of digital silicon. 
There are Core 2 processors designed to fill every market niche, from the bargain basement 
to the network server room. At the lowest end are Celeron processors with limited internal 
cache. They provide the function of the Pentium architecture with less speed. At the high end are 
Extreme Editions, which include large caches, and move data more quickly between it and the 
motherboard's chipset. 

How the Processor 
Uses Registers 
Few of us can do complex moth in our heads. Even for something as simple as adding several rows of numbers, 
we need a pencil and paper to keep track of our operations on individual numbers. Microprocessors are not all 
that different in this regard . Although they are capable of performing intricate moth involving thousands of num-
bers, they, too, need notepads to keep track of their calculations. Their notepads are called registers, and their 
pencils are pulses of electricity. 
A microprocessor's registers consist of reserved 
sections of transistors in the foster memory inside 
the microprocessor. There the processor's arith-
metic logic unit (AlU). in charge of carrying out 
moth instructions, and the control unit, which 
herds instructions and data through the processor, 
have quick access to the registers. The size of the 
registers determines how much data the processor 
can work with at one time. Most pes have regis-
ters with 32 or 64 bits for data. 
The processor's control unit directs the fetching 
and execution of program instructions. (See " How 
a Microprocessor Moves Data", on page 70, for 
more information.) It uses on electrical signal to 
fetch each instruction, decodes it, and sends 
another control signal to the arithmetic logic un it 
telling the AlU what operation to corry out. 
With each clock cycle-the thin unit of time during 
which the different components of a computer can 
do one thing-the processor writes or reads the 
values of the bits by sending or withholding a 
pulse of electricity to each bit. Each chunk of 
binary numbers is only thaI. They have no labels to 
identify them as instructions, data, values going 
into a computation, or the product of executing 
instructions. What the values represent depends on 
in which registers the control unit stores them. 

67 
When the processor reads the con-
tents of a location in memory, it tells 
the data bus to place those values 
into a memory data register. 
When the processor wants to write 
values to memory, it places the val-
ues in the memory data register, 
where the bus retrieves them to 
transfer to RAM. 
A program counter register holds the 
memory address of the next value the proces-
sor will fetch. As soon as a value is retrieved, 
the processor increments the program 
counter's contents by 1 so it points to the 
next program location . (A computer launches 
a program by putting the program's first 
value into the counter register.) 
The processor puts the results of executing an operation into several 
accumulation registers, where they await the results of other execut-
ing operations, similar to those shown in the illustration on the next 
spread, "How a Computer Performs Addition ." Some of the instructions 
call for adding or subtracting the numbers in two accumulators to yield a 
third value that is stored in still another accumulator. 

68 
HOW MICROCHIPS ARE THE PC'S BRAIN 
How a Computer Performs Addition 
All information-words and graphics as well as numbers-
is stored in and manipulated by a PC in the form of binary 
numbers. In the binary numerical system, there are only 
two digits-O and 1. All numbers, words, and graphics 
are formed from different combinations of those digits.

El Transistor switches are used to manipulate binary numbers 
because there are two possible states of a switch, open (off) or 
closed (on), which nicely matches the two binary digits. An open 
transistor, through which no current is flowing, represents a O. A 
closed transistor, which allows a pulse of electricity regulated by 
the PC's clock to pass through, represents a 1. (The computer's 
clock regulates how fast the computer works. The faster a clock 
ticks, causing pulses of electricity, the faster the computer works. 
Clock speeds are measured in megahertz, or millions of ticks per 
second.) Current passing through one transistor can be used to 
control another transistor, in effect turning the switch on and off to 
change what the second transistor represents. Such an arrange-
ment is called a gate because, like a fence gate, the transistor can 
be open or closed, allowing or stopping current flowing through it. 
The simplest operation that can be performed with a transistor is called a NOT logic gate, made up of only a single transis-
tor. This NOT gate is designed to take one input from the clock and one from another transistor. The NOT gate produces a 
single output-one that's always the opposite of the input from the transistor. When current from another transistor represent-
ing a 1 is sent to a NOT gate, the gate's own transistor switches open so that a pulse, or current, from the clock can't flow 
through it, which makes the NOT gate's output O. A 0 
input closes the NOT gate's transistor so that the clock 
pulse passes through it to produce an output of 1.

NOT gates strung together in different combinations create other logic gates, all of which have a line 
to receive pulses from the clock and two other input lines for pulses from other logic gates. The OR 
gates create a 1 if either the first or second input is a 1, and put out a 0 only if both inputs are O.

DECIMAL 
With different combinations of logic gates, a computer performs the math that is the foundation 
of all its operations. This is accomplished with gate designs called half-adders and full-adders. 
A half.adder consists of an XOR gate and an AND gate, both of which receive the same input 
representing a one-digit binary number. A full-adder consists of half-adders and other switches. 
FULL-ADDER 
A combination of a half-adder and a full-adder handles larger binary numbers and can gener-
ate results that involve carrying over numbers. To add the decimal numbers 2 and 3 (10 and 11 
in the binary system), first the half-adder processes the digits on the right side through both XOR 
and AND gates.

The result of the XOR operation (1) becomes 
the rightmost digit of the result. 
The result of the half-adder's AND operation (0) 
is sent to XOR and AND gates in the full-adder. 
The full-adder also processes the left-hand digits 
from 1 1 and 10, sending the results of both of 
the operations to another XOR gate and 
another AND gate. 
The results from XORing and ANDing the left-hand digits 
are processed with the results from the half-adder. One 
of the new results is passed through an OR gate. 
I 
The result of all the calculations is 101 in binary, which 
is 5 in decimal. For larger numbers, more full-adders are 
used-one for each digit in the binary numbers. An 
80386 or later processor, including today's Pentium 
DECIMAL 
class processors, uses 32 full-adders.

HOW MICROCHIPS ARE THE PC'S BRA 
How Multi-core 
Processors Work 
You'd think the microprocessors humming along on the billion and a half tran-
sistors you find in some processors today would more than satisfy the 
requirements of the most intense software you would push through the 
chips. But in computing, there is no such thing as "enough." So if it's too 
hard to put more transistors on the processors, there's another solution: 
Put more processors in the computer. Multi-core processors are like bolt-
ing a couple of computers together and having them share the same 
memory, power and input/output. Already, a machine with two 
processors from either AMD or Intel is the standard buy at computer 
stores. And if that's not enough for you, systems with four process-
ing units are available in the next isle, thank you very much, and 
Intel already has configurations with more processors in the 
works. 
El 
An Intel quad-core processor combines two 
dies, or silicon chips, in a single housing. 
Each of the dies, in turn, has two processor

If the application software isn't equipped to work in multiple 
cores, the operating system can still take advantage of them. 
It picks one of the cores to run the software and creates an 
affinity between that core and the program. It then creates 
affinities between the remaining cores and various tasks. A 
second core may handle background operations, such as 
disk optimizing; a third core might supervise a download; 
and the fourth could be rendering a video to a different for-
mat. Neither the operations nor their finish times are affected 
by the processing going on the in other cores. 
The OS puts that operation into a time-staggered queue 
along with requests that are going to other cores. Each of the 
operations enters its respective core on different clicks of the com-
puter's clock so they are less likely to run into each other or cause 
a traffic jam in the areas they have mutual access to. 
Among those mutual access areas are two 4MB caches, one for each 
of the dies. If only one core is active, the operating system devotes 
most of the die's cache to that core. The operating system changes that 
allocation on the fly as the other cores become active or inactive.

HOW MICROCHIPS ARE THE PC'S BRAIN 
How a PC Keeps Its Cool 
Overclocked PCs are invariably overcooked PCs. The collisions of electrons moving 
through the traces and wires of microchips and circuit boards generate heat. The 
heat, in turn, contributes to the electrons' volatility. Like speeding cars, fast-moving 
electrons can lose the ability to stay on the track, especially as PC companies make 
circuits -their tracks- narrower. The result is that heat causes errors, as well as 
faster deterioration of the materials that make up computer components. One study 
found that every increase of 10° Celsius (C) drops the reliability of PC 
components by 50 percent. Aggressive computer users and makers 
have found several ways to cool 
their machines. 
Heat 
Sinks 
Fins 
With no cooling airs at all, a rnrnnl)n"nt 
the CPU transfers its heat by 
Hot, 
rapidly vibrating molecules within the chip bump 
against neighboring atoms and molecules, trans-
ferring heat in the process. Eventually the heat 
reaches the chip's surface, where conduction trans-
fers the heat to the air, allowing the heat to slowly 
dissipate. 
El The more surface area a chip has, the more heat can be passed on to the air. The 
added surface is provided by heat sinks. The sink is glued to a chip with a highly 
conductive thermal paste that assures there are no gaps filled with the less con-

ductive air. Heat passes into the sinks, 
of copper or aluminum, which 
rapidly move the heat to 
surface area to transfer 
more heat to the surrou 
The lighter hot air rises, and the 
denser and heavier cool air falls. 
Away from the heat source, the hot 
air cools and sinks; the fallen cool 
air is heated by the source and rises. 
The result is a roughly circular con-
vection system. But the cables, drive 
bays, and expansion boards inside 
a computer block the circulation, 
making convection less efficient. 
Even with heat sinks and heat pipes, there remains the problem of getting the 
heat transferred to the air, away from the sinks and pipes, so they can pass 
more heat into the air. This is performed naturally through convection, based 
on the fact that the more rapidly moving atoms and molecules in hot air are far-
ther apart from each other, making the hot air less dense and, therefore, lighter. 

OW A MICROPROCESSOR WORKS 
77 
Heat 
Pipes 
Pipe 
Heat pipes are 
supercharged heat sinks 
that cool in the same way air 
conditioning does-through 
evaporative cooling. One end of 
the pipe is connected to a microchip in the 
way a heat sink is; the other end is in a rela-
tively cool part of the computer. The pipe is a sealed, 
hollow tube that contains a small amount of Huid 
coolant, usually some combination of ammonia, 
alcohol, and water. The rest of the tube contains a 
near vacuum with only a thin vapor of the coolant. 
Heat from the microchip 
evaporates the coolant, 
drawing heat from the hot 
end of the pipe through a 
process called latent 
Fluid 
heat, which occurs 
whenever a substance 
changes its state, such as a 
liquid becoming a gas. 
The liquid resulting from condensa-
tion returns to the hot end, either 
through a wick that coots the inside 
of the pipe or simply by running 
down the inside of pipes mounted 
vertically. 
The evaporation increases vapor pressure 
inside the pipe at the end touching the chip. 
This results in a rush of vapor toward the cool 
end of the pipe as the pressure seeks to equal-
ize itself throughout the pipe. At the cool end, 
the vapor condenses, releasing the heat it car-
ried with it from the hot end. The cool end is 
typically enveloped by fins that dissipate the 
heat to the surrounding air. Evaporation of a 
single gram of water uses the energy required 
to raise that same gram by 540
0 C. 
Not all heat pipes are pipes. Flat heat pipes are two thin sheets of metal that create a nar-
row cavity between them. Some Hat pipes are no thicker than 500 microns--{]bout 2-hun-
dredths of an inch. The space between the metal sheets is divided between hollow areas and 
sheets of a thin material with capillaries to act as wicks. The pipes' flat design allows them to fit 
Hush against the surface of a microchip for maximum transfer of heat, which is carried to a

~ 
One solution is similar to the fan-forced 
convection found in ovens. A strategi-
cally-placed fan blows air across the fins 
of a heat sink or heat pipe; some are 
integral paris of sinks or pipes. This forces 
the hot air to circulate without relying on 
convection. Other fans, often outfitted 
with neon or LED lights, may be fitted in 
holes in the computer's case to move the 
hot air outside the computer. 
Probes built into the motherboard or added to 
the PC by an overclocker read the temperature 
of key components, such as the CPU, GPU, and 
RAM. The results may be read on an LED dis-
play or may automatically turn fans on as 
needed to cool components off and to reduce 
noise levels when temperatures are not as 
great.

How Advanced Cooling 
Solutions Refrigerate Your PC 
Water Cooled PCs 
The most popular solution to eliminat-
ing the noise of fans while at the same 
time providing an even lower tempera-
ture is the same as that found in cars 
and the Browning .50-caliber machine 
gun : water cooling . 
same type 
I paste 
with heat sinks holds a water block 
tightly to the CPU. Inside the block is a 
watertight channel that travels back 
and forth to create the maximum oppor-
tunity for heat from the CPU to transfer 
to a fluid inside the channel. Similar 
water blocks may also be attached to 
the North Bridge and South Bridge 
chips and the graphics processing unit 
on the video card-all sources of 
extreme heat. 
It there are more than one microchips 
being cooled, they are daisy-chained 
by tough plastic tubing designed to 
take turns without kinking. A pump con-
tinually moves liquid through the tub-
ing . The liquid might be distilled water, 
to which additives may be added to 
improve the water's ability to absorb 
heat, to discourage corrosion and bac-
terial growth, to give the fluid a bright 
color, or to make it glow under ultravio-
let light. 
The pump moves the hot coolant to a 
metal radiator located outside the computer, or at least an 
area far-removed from the hotter components. The radiator 
has an undulating channel that gives the metal ample opportu-
nity to absorb heat from the water. The heat moves through 
the absorbing metal to a system of fins that, as on a heat sink, 
expands the surface area for the heat to dissipate into the air. 
There mayor may not be a fan cooling the fins, depending 
on the efficiency of the water system and the owner's desire 
for a quiet system . 
The cooled liquid flows through a reservoir. The reservoir pro-
vides another area where heat can escape. Only part of the 
reservoir is filled with liquid. Air in the reservoir allows the liq-
uid to expand and contract as its temperature changes without 
putting undue pressure on the tubing . It also provides a conve-
nient place for adding additional coolant if needed. From the 
reservoir, the cooled coolant returns to the system of water 
blocks to continue the cooling process. 

CHAPTER 6 
Peltier Cooling 
When electricity flows through 
the n-type elements and 
crosses through a metallic con-
nector to the p-type material, 
the extra electrons in the n-type 
semiconductor flow in the 
opposite direction of the elec-
trical current. 
Ceramic Substrate 
HOW A MICROPROCESSOR WORKS 
79 
One of the more exotic methods of cooling computers uses the 
Peltier effect, first observed by Jean Peltier in 1834. The effect 
appears in a device made of two dissimilar metals-metals that 
react differently to electrical current-that are joined in at least 
two different places. A Peltier device, also called a thermo-
electric cooler, can also work with two different types of semi-
conductors-n-type, to which impurities have been added so it 
has extra electrons, and p-type, in which impurities create 
holes, or vacancies where electrons could be. For simplicity, 
we'll just use semiconductors for our example. 
El After the current continues 
on and passes through the 
p-type material, it returns 
to the n-type through 
another metallic bridge. 
This time the holes in the 
p-type element move 
through the metal bridge 
in the same direction as 
the current. 
In both instances, the electrons and the holes carry heat with them. The junction they are headed for 
warms, and the junction they are leaving cools off. The cool side of the device is attached to a microchip 
like a heat sink, and the hot side uses some combination of fins, heat pipes, and fans to dissipate the 
steady stream of heat originating at the chip. (Despite its high-tech nature, a Peltier device is an electricity 
hog and only 49-60 percent as effective as a refrigerator compressor. ) 
Cooling with Crisco 
The strangest method overclockers have developed to keep 
a computer cool is to submerge the motherboard and its 
expansion boards in cooking oil. Oil has dual strengths-
it's an insulator and an excellent conductor of heat, making 
it a good, if messy, substance for cooling pes, as well as 
frying chicken .

-Walt Disney's Cinderella 
THE language programmers use to create software sound a lot like the fairy godmother's 
incantation: grep, mov, end if, cur_x, and selField. And software really is magical. You slide 
a DVD into your PC, or you invoke your PC-maybe with a touch, maybe at the sound of 
your voice-or you point at a little picture with a mouse and click, and suddenly all these 
things begin to happen that could only be witchery. Beautiful color images and voices and 
sounds emanate from your Pc. The software looks at a few numbers and predicts banana 
futures in three months. Ask for information on a person, a country, or a date, and the soft-
ware responds like a crystal ball. You ask the software to take you to another computer on 
another continent, and in seconds you're there; magic carpets really can 't compete. 
Software's abracadabra needn't be a mystery to those of us who don't speak BASIC, 
Java, Pascal, C, C++, C#, Lisp, and other curiously named software languages. Even if 
you've never touched a computer before, you 've used software. Software doesn't include 
only things like WordPerfect and Microsoft Excel. Software is also music recordings and 
videotapes. A recipe for Aunt Hattie's chocolate pie, a dress pattern, and a telephone num-
ber are programs. A program is simply any set of instructions for an ordered series of 
actions. A program can exist as a printout of computer code or as a recipe in a cookbook. 
And you're already a programmer, even if you've never touched a computer. 
Have you played the latest Stones' CD? That's software! Can you program your VCR? 
You 're creating software. A computer software program-not really redundant, trust me-is 
simply a recipe , no less, no more than a recipe for Aunt Hattie's chocolate pie. 
Think of what you do when you use a microwave. You press buttons in a certain order 
to make the microwave work at a specific power level for a certain length of time, then 
change to a different power level, and so on until your program produces beef stew. That's 
programming---a set of instructions in a particular order, created on the fly. But if you press 
a button that's preset for microwave popcorn, you 're using software-a preconfigured set 
of programming instructions that, in this case, are recorded permanently in a microchip 
inside the microwave .

Hardware is capable of doing a variety of tasks, but without programming and soft-
ware to control it, hardware can't do much of anything. By itself, for example, a claw 
hammer is useful only as a paperweight, but used by a carpenter, it can drive nails, 
pullout old nails, and even crack walnuts. The carpenter swinging the hammer is pro-
gramming it on the fly. A home entertainment center is a complex system of hardware 
capable of generating a variety of sights and sounds, but it can't whisper a peep on its 
own . It needs software in the form of a compact disc, videotape, or at least a basic 
cable connection. The signals produced by the disc, tape, and broadcasts tell the hard-
ware what electrical pulses re-create the sounds of Mahler's Tenth Symphony or the 
sights of Terminator 2. 
Software of the Second Millennium 
If you think of software as a recorded set of instructions that control the actions of 
a machine, then software's really been around for quite some time. Music nota-
tion is written instructions for programming a piano on the fly. But if you have a 
player piano, the rolls of punched paper are its software. In the 18th century, 
weaving was done by someone manually slipping a bobbin wrapped with 
thread over and under other threads on a loom. The process was slow and rife 
with opportunities for slip-ups. But in 1804, Joseph-Marie Jacquard programmed 
a weaving loom using a series of punched cards that controlled what patterns 
were woven into a fabric. Different cards resulted in different patterns. Jacquard's 
invention is considered the birth of modern computer programming, and punch cards 
were used with computers well into the 20th century. The invention was also the occa-
sion for the first wave of automation fear. In 1811, Ned Ludd, a Nottingham weaver 
who feared the new looms would replace people, led his co-workers in a frenzied 
attack on the machinery. Luddite has come to mean any person who resists technology 
advancements. 
Software made little progress for the next century. In 1889, Thomas A. Edison 
invented the kinetoscope, a hardware device that let people view moving pictures on

film. Film, sound recordings, and radio broadcasts-things we don't normally think of as 
software-were, in fact, just that, and the most prevalent form of software in the first half of 
the 20th century. 
The first computers had neither a keyboard nor a monitor, and they had no software. 
Their creators programmed instructions by tediously flipping a series of switches in a pre-
cise arrangement. This set up a pattern of on and off electrical currents the computer then 
used to activate more electrical switches in the form of vacuum tubes. Finally, the result was 
displayed in the form of a panel of lights turned off or on to represent the zeros and ones 
in the binary number system. 
John von Neumann in 1945 first proposed the idea of a general-purpose electronic 
digital computer with a stored program. But the computer, the ENIAC, was not built until 
1952. Meanwhile, scientists in England in 1948 created the Manchester Mark I, the first 
computer that could store a program electronically instead of making programmers set 
switches manually. 
During the next two decades, computers gained such accoutrements as keyboards and 
displays. They used software in the form of punched cards, punched paper tape, and mag-
netic tape. All those forms of software were awkward and slow to use compared to mod-
ern software, but they made life much easier for early programmers. 
Not that there were many programmers back then to have their lives made easier. 
Some of the earliest writers of software sprang from a model railroad club at MIT. The rail-
roaders used telephone switches to control their complex system of tracks, crossings, and 
rail switches. In the railroad, they had created a simple and very specialized form of com-
puter. They already thought in terms of switches, the perfect training for writing software. 
Most of the software writing then was going on in the universities, military, and busi-
nesses that were big enough to afford the then room-filling computers, called mainframes. 
But regardless of where different programs originated, in the 1960s they had one thing in 
common: They would work only on a specific computer for a specialized purpose. A pro-
gram that was written, for example, to handle Gizmo Corp.'s payroll was customized 
specifically to match that company's accounting practices and record keeping, and it 
would run only on a computer configured like the one at Gizmo Corp. If another company

wanted a payroll program, it was written from the ground up again. And if a manager 
at Gizmo wanted to look at payroll information from a different angle, the entire pro-
gram had to be altered. 
Programs back then had one other thing in com-
mon: They were either very expensive or free. 
Computer companies, such as IBM, saw software as a 
tool to sell hardware-"big iron." Because each pro-
gram was a custom job-in a discipline that was still 
finding itself---companies expected to spend thousands 
of dollars. And compared to a computer that cost mil-
lions, a few thousand for software didn't seem so bad. 
On the other hand, computer companies didn't 
charge for an operating system-the crucial software 
that lets a computer run a program that performs spe-
cific applications. Programmers routinely swapped their 
software code with other programmers. Many program-
mers saw computers as more than business tools. 
Computers, somehow, were going to be the great 
equalizer. Information was going to be the next indus-
t---

trial revolution, and computers were going to give Joe Blow access to the same infor-
mation available to the board of GM. Such idealism, joined with the fact that all 
programmers were really just in the learning stage, led to a philosophy that all software 
should be distributed for free. That ideal is still alive today in the open source move-
ment, where powerful operating systems such as Linux are free and users are encour-
aged to make improvements for all to share. 
Gradually, the nature of software changed. Computer companies began 
unbundling software from hardware. A new working class-the "cowboy," program-
mer for hire-traveled from company to company customizing programs and then mov-
ing on. In the mid-60s, it occurred to some of these cowboys that they could write one 
program and sell it to several companies. A new market was born.

Killer Software 
When the personal computer came along, soft-
ware followed a similar route. The users of the 
first personal computers-the Altair and the 
Commodore Pet-were pioneers who expected to 
do their own programming. They happily shared 
the coding tricks they learned and the programs 
they created. A revolution was in the making, 
although few realized it at the time. All the revolu-
tion needed as a spark was the "killer app." 
.,..,1010 0 
A killer app is an application program so use-
ful and popular that it can create a demand for 
hardware. The first killer application for the per-
sonal computer was VisiCalc. An MIT graduate, 
Dan Bricklen, made one of those connections that 
change society. He saw that millions of accoun-
tants, business managers, executives, bankers, 
and stock brokers were wasting their time doing 
The first computer progrom, written in 
1948 by Tom Kilburn for the Mork 1, 
wos designed to find the highest proper

It took 52 minutes to solve the 
problem for the number 218. 
something a computer can do easier and faster: 
number crunching. Using mechanical adding 
machines, people were feeding in enormous strings of numbers and crunching them 
into other numbers. The possibilities for error were great. And the certainty of monoto-
nous labor was greater. 
The result of Bricklen's inspiration is the electronic spreadsheet, a killer app by defi-
nition because it was easily understood-at least by people who work with numbers-
and in time saved, it quickly paid for itself and a computer to run it on. On the monitor 
of the first truly mass-market computer, an Apple II, VisiCalc looked substantially like a 
paper ledger sheet. The hapless accountant still had to enter the numbers to be 
crunched by the computer, but he didn't have to add, subtract, divide, or multiply them. 
VisiCalc did that according to formulas---another type of program-which the computer 
user types into "cells," those little rectangles created by the grid of a ledger's lines. The 
formulas, of course, were created by humans, and there was always the possibility of 
human error. But once you got the formula right, you didn't have to think about it again, 
and you didn't have to worry about math mistakes. Just as importantly, you had to enter 
each relevant number only once. If a five percent sales tax was added to each pur-
chase, the spreadsheet user had only to enter it once for VisiCalc to add the correct 
sales tax for each purchase. 

But it wasn't only accuracy, speed, and ease that made VisiCalc so popular. It was 
also a matter of power, something business people understood even if they had only the 
vaguest idea of how these new electronic spreadsheets worked. Until VisiCalc, when a

the IS department, which would get around 
in the next few days to loading a program 
and data from huge spools of magnetic 
tape, letting it all churn for a while and then 
spitting out the information in the form of 
cards with holes in them or long streams of 
green and white striped paper. Wars have

The personal computer changed all that. Within a few minutes, any business person 
with a passable knowledge of algebra and some fortitude could crunch his own num-
bers. Knowledge was literally at his fingertips. And in modern commerce, knowledge 
was valuable. It was power. 
That lesson was not lost on the people managing the traditional corporate computer 
centers. They saw personal computers as threats to their own power bases. If anyone 
could juggle their own numbers, why would the company need a big, expensive 
department dedicated to information? The computer managers, of course, claimed that 
they were only trying to avert catastrophes at the hands of information amateurs. The 
result was that many PCs were bought with purchase orders claiming the PCs were elec-
tric typewriters. 
There was another lesson in VisiCalc. The software market was to become some-
thing so volatile, so innovative, and so important that no application remained top killer 
for long. When the IBM PC debuted in 1981, it could not run the software then avail-
able for the Apple. Bricklen's company was slow in creating a version that would run 
on a Pc. Before anyone knew it, a new killer app dominated the scene. 
Lotus 1-2-3, introduced in 1982, was, like VisiCalc, an electronic spreadsheet. But it 
expanded the definition of spreadsheets by adding capabilities for graphing the data in 
the spreadsheet and manipulating its information the way a database manager does. 
The use of graphics was particularly impressive for a computer, the IBM PC, that was 
designed basically to display only text. Lotus 1-2-3 justified the buying of IBM PCs and 
compatibles in many offices. It also revealed the perils at that time of buying IBM 
clones. 1-2-3 took advantage of some quirks in the IBM PC to speed up performance.

HOW SOFTWARE WORKS

lotus 1-2-3 was the first big business 
hit on the IBM PC because it combined 
the functions of an electronic 
spreadsheet, a database, and 
graphing. 
Courtesy of Lotus Corp. 
But the same quirks weren't duplicated in imitation IBM PCs, with the result that 1-2-3 
wouldn't work on some systems. Computer builders were forced to reproduce what they 
considered flaws in the IBM machine to be sure they could run any software the IBM PC 
could run. 
The 1980s were a decade of explosive growth-and often rapid death-of com-
puter makers and software publishers. Compared to today's machines and operating 
systems, the early PCs were simple enough so that 
one programmer working nights in a bedroom 
could turn out software that was killer. Software 
with eccentric names such as Electric Pencil and 
Volkswriter, both word processors, quickly 
expanded the capabilities of PCs. The early suc-
cess of dBASE II, a database manager, inspired 
countless other programs with "base" in their 
names. Inevitably, someone created 4-5-6, which 
added more features to 1-2-3. Many programs 
filled in functions PCs were lacking. Peter Norton 
launched a series of products with Norton 
Unerase, capitalizing on the fact that the PC's 
operating system neglected to provide a way to 
retrieve a file that had been deleted accidentally. 
At the same time commercial software was burgeoning into every possible niche, 
another software movement grew alongside the programs from big corporations. In 
1982, Andrew Fluegleman created PC-Talk, a program allowing computer users to 
communicate over phone lines. Despite the name, you did not use PC-Talk by talking. 
Conversations were typed, but you could also transfer entire programs from one com-
puter to another. The decisive feature of PC-Talk, however, was the fact you could get it 
for free, and it established an important category of software: freeware, which later 
became known as shareware. Freeware programs were distributed without charge over 
electronic bulletin boards accessed with a modem and at the meetings of computer 
clubs called user groups. Often, freeware was totally free. Other shareware gave you a 
chance to try the program risk free, but if you liked the software and continued to use it, 
you were expected to send some money to its author. At $5-$40, the suggested prices 
were still cheap compared to software sold in boxes at stores. Some programmers 
humbly suggested users send whatever they thought the program was worth. Not unsur-
prisingly, a lot of people used the programs without paying. But enough people were 
honest enough and enough shareware was good enough that at least a few program-
mers made respectable livings. The shareware tradition continues today on the World 
Wide Web, although now programs you download from the Internet are likely to have 
some features disabled or stop working after a month to encourage users to pay regis-
tration fees. 

The abundance of software in the early years also meant confusion. Many program-
mers had idiosyncratic concepts of what software should do and how it should do it. 
And they found equally idiosyncratic users. WordStar, for example, quickly dominated 
the word processor market despite a system for formatting documents based on starting 
lines with a period-hardly an intuitive approach. But WordStar could be modified by 
anyone with scant programming knowledge, a bit of daring, and a different idea of 
how a word processor should work. 
Power to the Software 
In fact, the dominating factor in the early software leaders was not that it came out of 
the box as an ideal product. Instead, programs like WordStar, 1-2-3, dBASE, and 
WordPerfect could be manipulated by non-programmers. This was the opposite extreme 
from the days of big iron, when a bright idea for a way to handle information had to 
be submitted to the computer pros, who would get around to it Real Soon Now. The fac-
tor distinguishing software from all the helpful tools invented before it was that software 
was malleable. You weren't limited to using it as intended. One Lotus 1-2-3 user devised 
a way to use the number cruncher as a word processor. Users of WordPerfect routinely 
pressed the word processor's mail merge functions into duty as a database manager. 
What really accounts for the popularity of the best software is the empowerment it 
gives people over computers. The best software came with macro or scripting capabili-
ties that gave a layman user enormous power over this new machine. Macros let you 
record a series of keystrokes or write a list of simple commands for the software to fol-
low. You made the software work the way you thought it should. You could create your 
own menus, fill in rows of information with a couple of keystrokes, or make your com-
puter connect to a bulletin board service to download the latest games as you slept. 
There is a physical, Frankensteinian thrill to creating a macro in 1-2-3 or writing a script 
in CrossTalk and watching your computer obey your instructions like a faithful genie. 
There was, of course, despair as well as thrill. The truly insane greatness of the 80s 
was as confusing as it was empowering. There was no master plan, no one person in 
charge of creating software. This often led to brilliant breakthroughs born of an individ-
ual spark of genius. But it also led to a new round of learning with each new program. 
In some programs, you might display a help screen by pressing Alt+H. Or Ctrl+H, or 
F7, or Fl. (1-2-3's F1 came to be accepted by other programs as the standard help key 
because of 1-2-3's dominance and the universal need for help.) 
Although some other conventions arose among programs, diversity dominated. 
Only with Microsoft's domination of the operating system-first with MS-DOS and 
today, Windows-has some semblance of order been imposed on the wild garden that 
software was throughout the 20th century.

HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
Operating Systems and Other Software 
Operating systems are important enough to warrant their own chapter. But a brief explanation of 
what an operating system was and what it evolved into will give you a better perspective on modern 
software blessings and annoyances. 
First of all, an operating system is fundamentally different from all other types of software in that an 
operating system is the one program you must have to do anything with your Pc. No computers need 
a word processing program or a spreadsheet or the game World of Warcraft just to work. But each 
PC must have an operating system. 
On its own, a computer can do little more when you turn it on than wake up and, like 
an infant, search for something to feed it. The food of computers is software, and the appe-
tizer is always the operating system. When a computer boots, it only has enough code built 
into it to look on a disk for a few crucial operating system files. It pulls those into memory, 
and they in turn load the rest of the operating system. The loaded operating system estab-
lishes rules by which the computer can then load other programs and work with hardware 
that the computer isn't smart enough to handle on its own. 
Operoting System 2 (OS/2) begon 
in 1983 os 0 joint project between 
Microsoft ond IBM for high-end 
computers. Windows would be the 
operoting system for entry-level 
pes. Ten yeors loter, the two 
componies let the joint 
development ogreement expire. 
Windows ond OS/2 competed for 
the some morket, but OS/2 lost 
the numbers gome. For the first 
time, 0 computer com pony other 
thon IBM corried the stondord to 
which other developers conformed. 
The name for Microsoft's DOS, for example, comes from disk operating system, or OS. 
Originally, DOS was designed as a software tool to create disk files, copy files, delete 
them, and organize them. All this was done by typing text commands on a black screen. 
More significantly, DOS let you run other software simply by typing the name of a pro-
gram. Today Windows does the same thing with a click on a tiny cartoon. 
You can look at the operating system as an office's mid-level manager. The operating 
system posts the office rules that other programs must obey. These other programs are 
called applications-which roughly means anything that isn't DOS, Windows, UNIX, 
System 8, Linux, or the few other operating systems out there. Think of applications as 
being an office's top executives. Like most executives, the applications have a lot of bright 
ideas but not the slightest clue about how to carry them out. But applications, like execu-
tives, have someone to do the real work. Applications give the OS some general, vague instruc-
tions-such as "Save this file with the name mybudget." The operating system, in turn, passes more 
detailed instructions on to the office's clerks, who are the ones who really get their hands dirty. In our 
little metaphor, the clerks are the computer codes contained in the BIOS, dynamic link libraries, and 
drivers. These are the people/code who know how the office actually runs-how to record a file or 
add two numbers. 
All applications must have an operating system or else you couldn't run them at all. But the same 
isn't true of operating systems. Even if Windows is the only software on your PC, you can still use the 
computer. This is becoming increasingly true as Microsoft integrates into Windows functions that 
were once performed only by separate programs, such as faxing, word processing, disk compres-
sion, and Internet browsers. The broadening of the definition of an operating system is a legal as 
well as a technical job. For better or worse, it's increasingly true that although applications must have 
an operating system to run, an operating system doesn't need application programs to be useful. 

OVERVIEW 
91 
The Devolution of the OS 
If you've been using a PC long enough to know what a DOS prompt is, then you know that MS-DOS 
wasn't designed to be easy to use. Actually, DOS was only one of two operating systems for the Pc. 
Initially, IBM sold the PC with both Microsoft's DOS and CP/M-86, an upgrade for the 8086 proces-
sor of CP/M (Control Program for Microcomputers). CP/M was a down-and-dirty operating system 
found on several brands of microcomputers at the time. Both DOS and CPM-86 were more con-
cerned with providing a learning path that would be familiar to people who already knew CP/M, 
the original computer geeks. 
Microsoft and other companies realized early on that this shortcoming was a road-
block to more widespread user acceptance, and there were continual attempts on sev-
eral fronts to improve or replace DOS with an operating system that extends the 
computer's capabilities and make it easier to use. Some operating systems, such as 
GEOS and DR DOS, gained cult followings but never had the market commitment 
needed to overtake Microsoft's own evolving operating system. IBM and Microsoft split 
over their joint development of a new graphic operating system, OS/2. Following the 
split, IBM continued to develop and sell OS/2, but even IBM's clout was no match for 
Microsoft's marketplace entrenchment. 
What an operating system needed more than bells and whistles-what it had to 
have-was the capability to run the thousands of programs that had already been devel-
oped under DOS. Software developers were loath to jump any bandwagon unless they 
were sure the public would follow. Microsoft had the only working bandwagon in town. 
Windows 1 
In 1985, Microsoft introduced 
Windows, 0 grophic interfoce 
thotlet you moke selections 
with 0 mouse from menus ond 
run more thon one program ot 
o time. It wos slow, required 
mojor memory, ond received 0 
universol yown. 
When Windows first appeared in November 1985, it was slow, crash-prone, and demanded pro-
cessing and memory resources that were then prohibitively expensive. It used graphics and a mouse 
pointer to do the jobs that required obscure typed commands in DOS. It was an unimaginative copy-
cat of the Macintosh operating system. Still, Microsoft, better than any competitor, could guarantee 
that billions of dollars of software and business data already created under DOS would still be usable. 
Technically, Windows was at first an "operating environment," window-dressing that hid DOS 
continuing to do the dirty work behind the curtains. And the dirtiest of them all was running program 
code that was originally designed for the PC's first processor, which could at best manipulate only 
16 bits of data at a time. Many programs written for DOS depended on that 16-bit mechanism even 
after Intel introduced the 80386, which could process 32 bits of data at once. DOS and even more 
recent Windows variants like Windows 95, 98 and Me, had to maintain parts of its own code that 
handled 16-bit operations. Microsoft did develop a variant of Windows-Windows NT, which 
became Windows 2000-that ran only 32-bit instructions. NT was a more stable variation of 
Windows, but it couldn't run older applications designed for older processors and it is found mostly 
on file servers, brawny computers that feed files to hundreds of other computers on a network. 
Despite the deservedly cold reception Windows first received, Microsoft kept revising Windows 
until, with version 3.1 in June 1992, it had an operating system that, although still far from ideal and 
still tied down by 16-bit code, was fast enough and stable enough to convince the public and soft-
ware publishers to hop on. 

92 
HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
The biggest step for Windows came in 2001, when Microsoft updated its consumer-oriented OS 
to Windows XP, a fully 32-bit operating system, giving it the speed, features, and security of 
Windows 2000. If Windows XP was about speed and power (the improved security was still lack-
ing), then five years later Windows Vista's appearance was largely about. .. appearance. With see-
through windows and dialog boxes decorated with sweeping fields of color and endowed with 
endlessly cute gadgets to give toys to all levels of computer users, there was very little even the most 
die-hard disparager of Windows could find to complain about. Even security issues got a potent and 
needed boost. 
Today, Windows has no serious challenge as the mainstream operating system, although 
Microsoft, beset with charges of monopolism, has perfected the art of trembling and pointing fingers 
at Java and Linux. Java is a programming language that is popular on the Internet, and is accessible 
by computers running every operating system imaginable. Linux is a version of Unix, a geeky operat-
ing system for high-powered computers. Linux has gained popularity more on philosophical than 
practical grounds. It is free, and the underlying code is available to anyone. Other programmers are 
encouraged to make improvements to the code and share them with other Linux users. Linux has the 
idealism found in the earliest programmers who considered selling software for profit the equivalent 
of crossing over to the Dark Side. It's even gaining a market share in use on file servers. But despite 
generic ports like Linux, the future of the operating system is devolution. Instead of evolving into a 
multitude of varied species, each riding its own varied strengths, the few primitive operating systems 
of an earlier era have devolved into even fewer species. The most serious threat to Windows might 
come from an unlikely source: the Internet. You can already see the distinctions starting to fade 
between what happens on the desktop and what happens on the Internet. Sun and Corel are provid-
ing software that operates partly in one arena, and partly in another. Eventually, the concept of an 
operating system could dissolve into tiny pieces of software residing on our hard drives and on the 
Internet that are called upon to furnish various services by other pieces of software or by computer 
hardware. The operating system might simply become part of the background-an important part, 
like highways are to transportation, but something we rarely think about except when there are traffic 
jams and holes. 
In this part of the book, we'll look at three types of software. First, the programming languages 
that software developers use to create other software. You might never use programming languages, 
but understanding how a program is created can help explain some of the inexplicable eccentricities 
of your computer. Then we'll look at Windows and how the operating system functions as an ambas-
sador between hardware and other software and as a straw boss riding herd on the third type of 
software we'll look at-applications.

AI (Artificial Intelligence) 
AI is used in 
games for everything from making a computer 
opponent behave believably like a human oppo-
nent to having automated units perform tasks in a 
realistic manner. 
algorithm 
A procedure, rule, or formula for 
solving a problem. A computer program is essen-
tially an elaborate algorithm that goes through a 
series of steps to arrive at a specific outcome. 
application 
Software that performs a specific 
function that is the end result of using the computer. 
Word processors, database programs, Web 
browsers, and image-editing programs are all 
applications. 
beta version, or beta 
A working version of a 
program being developed in which most of the 
components work. A company often sends betas to 
its customers, who try to find bugs in the beta. A 
program might go through several betas before 
being released to the public. 
bug 
A flaw in software that causes the program 
to malfunction or freeze when it encounters specific 
situations. 
call 
A programming command that uses---calls 
on-a specific routine elsewhere in the program or 
in a .DLL file. After the routine has ended, execu-
tion returns to the point in the code where the call 
happened. 
compiler 
A software tool that converts source 
code into a format that can run only with the assis-
tance of an operating system. Contrast with inter-
preter. 
dynamic link library (DLL) 
Collections of 
code all housed in the same DLL file that can be 
used by more than one program. 
dialog box 
An onscreen display that allows a 
computer user to select among several choices to 
determine how a program should operate. 
flow 
The sequence of functions a program 
follows. 
flow chart 
A diagram that depicts the flow of a 
program. 
game engine 
A computer game's master pro-
gram that coordinates all the other components, 
such as graphics, sound, calculating, and physics. 
graphic user interface (GUI) 
A method of 
controlling software using onscreen icons, menus, 
dialog boxes, and objects that can be moved or 
resized, usually with a pointing device such as a 
mouse. 
high-level language 
Software code written 
with recognizable words that more closely resemble 
convention languages, such as English. See low-
level language. 
interface 
The design of a program that deter-
mines how a computer user interacts with software. 
The two most common interfaces are the graphic 
user interface and the text interface, which consists 
of typing command words. 
interpreter 
A software tool that converts source 
code on the fly into instructions the computer can 
understand. Contrast with compiler. 
loop 
A section of software commands that 
returns to its beginning and runs again as long as 
no specific condition has been encountered. 
low-level language 
Software code written 
with specialized words that bear little resemblance 
to ordinary language but which require less inter-
pretation or compilation to create a finished pro-
gram. 
module 
A generic term for self-contained sec-
tions of a program that perform specialized func-
tions, such as a spelling checker. 
multithreaded 
A type of program designed to 
take advantage of Intel processors' ability to exe-
cute more than one string of data-thread-at the 
same time. Multithreaded programs must be 
designed so the threads can run independently and 
will not interfere with each other. 
operating system 
The software that serves as 
a bridge between the computer hardware and 
application software with which the computer user 
works. 
runtime 
The time a program or routine is being 
executed, or running. A program that is not depen-
dent on an interpreter or other program the com-
puter user works with.

CHAPTER 7 
HOW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES WORK 
9S 
OUR most fundamental tool as intelligent beings is language. It is through language that you learn new informa-
tion and share your knowledge, feelings, and experiences with others. Through language, you can express any 
thought anyone has ever had and describe any event, real or fictional. The world is controlled through language. 
Presidents to petty functionaries, generals to Gis, CEOs to clerks-all rely on language to give instructions to others 
and to gather information. 
Language is a necessity for a computer, too. Software is created using special languages that provide instruc-
tions for telling the computer what to do. And language defines the data with which the instructions will work. 
Computer language is similar to human language in many ways. The nouns, verbs, prepositions, and objects found 
in English, for example, have their counterparts in programming code-or the source code, the actual lines of text 
that get translated into functioning programs. But software sentences have their own syntax, and the words that 
make up the languages have their own precise meanings. 
Computer language is more exacting and more limited than English. An often-repeated story tells how, in an 
early attempt to use a computer to translate English into Russian, the phrase "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is 
weak" was interpreted as "The vodka is ready, but the meat is rotten." The story might be mythical, but it illustrates 
a reality-that computers and their languages do not do a good job of managing the ambiguities and shades of 
meaning in human language that any four-year-old understands (although advances in voice recognition have com-
puters understanding what we say, if not what we mean). 
If programming languages lack the subtleties of human language, human language cannot match the precision 
of computer-speak. Try, for example, to describe a simple spiral without using your hands. It's impossible in English. 
But because math is an integral part of computer languages, those languages cannot only describe a spiral but also 
can provide the instructions to create an image of that spiral on a display or printer. 
Different Programming Languages 
Just as there is more than one language for humans, so is there more than one computer language, even for the 
same type of computer. Generally, the various languages are described as low-level or high-level. The more a com-
puter language resembles ordinary English, the higher its level. Lower-level languages are more difficult to work 
with, but they usually produce programs that are smaller and faster. 
On the lowest level is machine language. This is a series of codes, represented by numbers (ones and 
zeros), used to communicate directly with the internal instructions of the PC's microprocessor. Deciphering machine 
language code or writing it is as complex a task as one can tackle in computing. Luckily, we don't have to do it. 
Programs called interpreters and compilers translate commands written in higher-level languages into machine 
language. We'll look at both interpreters and compilers later in this chapter. 
On a slightly higher level than machine language is assembly language, or simply assembly, which uses 
simple command words to supply step-by-step instructions for the processor to carry out. Assembly language directly 
manipulates the values contained in those memory scratch pads in the microprocessor called registers. In machine 
language, the hexadecimal code 40 increases by one the value contained in the register named AX; assembly lan-
guage uses the command INC AX to perform the same function. Although assembly language is more intelligible to 

96 
HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
humans than machine language codes, assembly is still more difficult to use than higher-level lan-
guages. Assembly remains popular among programmers, however, because it creates compact, fast 
code. 
On the high end, languages such as C and Java allow programmers to write in words and terms 
that more closely parallel English. And the programmer using these languages need not be con-
cerned with such minutiae as registers. The C language is powerful and yet reasonably simple to 
write and understand. Currently, Java is the rising star among languages because a program written 
in Java will run on any computer no matter what its operating system. This is a distinct advantage 
when you're writing programs people will use over the Internet, using anything from PCs to Macs and 
Sun workstations. Software written in C, in contrast, must be modified to allow a program written for 
one type of computer to be used on another. 
At the highest level are languages such as BASIC (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction 
Code), Visual Basic, the DOS batch language, and the macro languages used to automate applica-
tions such as Microsoft Office and Corel WordPerfect Office. 
Software Construction 
A program can be a single file-a record of data or program code saved to a disk drive. But gener-
ally, complex software consists of one file that contains a master program-the kernel-surrounded 
by a collection of files that contain subprograms, or routines. The kernel calls the routines it needs 
to perform some task, such as display a dialog box or open a file. A routine can also call other rou-
tines in the same file, in another file that's part of the program, or in files provided by Windows for 
common functions. Together, the kernel and subprograms give programs a way to receive, or input, 
information from the keyboard, memory, ports, and files, rules for handling that input data, and a 
way to send, or output, information to the screen, memory, ports, and files. 
Typically, when a user types information into a program, it is stored as a variable. As the term 
suggests, the information a variable stores varies from one instance to another. Programs on their 
own are also capable of storing in variables the information based on the results of a calculation or 
manipulation of data. For example, to assign the value 3 to a variable X, BASIC uses the command X 
= 3. Assembly language accomplishes the same thing by assigning the value to the AX register with 
the command MOV AX,3. Some languages require several commands to achieve the same effect 
another language accomplishes with a single command. 
After a program has information in a variable, it can manipulate it with commands that perform 
mathematical operations on numbers or parse text strings. Parsing is the joining, deletion, or extrac-
tion of some of the text characters to use them elsewhere in the program. When a variable is text, it 
is often called a string. You can have math strings, but most often, the term string refers to an unin-
terrupted series of alphanumeric and punctuation characters. Through parsing, a program can 
locate, for example, the spaces in the name "Phineas T. Fogg"; determine which parts of the string 
make up the first name, the middle initial, and the last name; and assign each segment to a separate 
variable. A typical math manipulation would be X = 2 + 2, which results in the variable X having the 

CHAPTER 7 
HOW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES WORK 
97 
value 4. If that command is then followed by X = X + 1, the new value of X would be 5. The com-
mand X = "New" + " " + "York" assigns the string "New York" to variable X. 
Programs can rely on the BIOS (see Chapter 3) to perform many of the input and output func-
tions-such as recognizing keystrokes, displaying keystrokes onscreen, sending data through the par-
allel and serial ports, reading and writing to RAM, and reading and writing disk files. The 
programming language still must have commands to trigger the BIOS services. Consider the following 
series of BASIC commands: 
OPEN "FOO" FOR OUTPUT AS #1 
WRITE #1, "This is some text." 
CLOSE #1 
These commands create a file named FOO that contains the text in quotes: This is some text. It 
then closes the file. The language Pascal does the same with these commands: 
Assign (TextVariable, "FOO"); 
Wri teLn (TextVariable, "This is some text."); 
Close (TextVariable); 
So far, we've described a fairly straightforward scheme: in, process, out. The reality is more complex. 
A program must be capable of performing different tasks under different circumstances-a feature 
that accounts for programming languages' power and versatility. And because a program hardly ever 
proceeds in a straight line from start to finish, there are commands that tell the computer to branch 
to different parts of the program to execute other commands. In BASIC, the command GOTO causes 
the execution to move to another part of the program . Assembly language does the same with the 
command JMP (short for jump). 
Branching is used in combination with the Boolean logic functions of the programming lan-
guages. For example, when a program needs to change what it's doing because a particular condi-
tion exists, it can use "if ••. then ••• " The program checks to see whether a certain condition is true, 
and if it is, the program then performs a certain command. For example, if the variable State is the 
string "Texas/' the program uses the abbreviation TX to address a letter. 
To get an idea of how programs are written, we'll look at a flowchart-a kind of map some-
times used by programmers to layout the logical connections among different sections of the program 
code. As an example we'll use a type of game that was popular in the days when text-only adven-
tures like Zork were plentiful. In such games, the user types in elementary commands, such as "Go 
east/' "Go north/' "Take knife/ ' and "Hit monster." And the game displays a sentence describing the 
consequences of the player's action. Our example is oversimplified and takes into account only one 
small portion of such a game. As such, it gives you an idea of how many commands and how much 
programming logic go into even the simplest code. In our adventure, the player is already on the bal-
cony of a castle turret surrounded by Fire Demons ... 

Display text on screen: 
"You are standing on the balcony of 
a cos~e turret. There is a cannon 
and 0 match. To the north you see

opproaching. The roil on the east 
side of the balcony is broken."

1 HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
How Software Interpreters Work 
Some software programs can't communicate directly with a computer. They are written in languages that require an interpreter, 
another program that translates the software's commands into instructions the processor can use. Interpreted programs include DOS 
batch files, programs written in BASIC, WordPerfect macros, and Java software written for use on the Internet. Each command in 
the program is written on a separate line. When you launch an interpreted program, an interpreter designed particularly for that 
EJ 
language establishes a small area in memory. 
BAS'C SOFTWARE 
There, the interpreter puts the name of the file 
As the interpreter reads each line of the file, it compares the first 
word in the line to a list of valid commands. In some instances in 
a BASIC program, the interpreter will also recognize a variable 
at the start of a line. A variable holds some temporary data, such 
as a filename or a number.

In a batch file, if the first word of a line 
is not found on the approved list, the 
interpreter will look for a .COM, .EXE, 
or .BAT file with a name matching the 
word. If none of these conditions are ful-
filled in a batch file, or, if in a BASIC 
program a matching command word or 
variable is not found, the interpreter gen-
erates an error message . 

CHAPTER 7 
HOW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES WORK 
101 
If the word is found on the list of valid commands, the interpreter executes 
the entire line, translating the command word along with the words that rep-
resent the parameters on which the command word is operating. For exam-
ple, the line "DEL MYFILE.DOC" consists of a command, DEL or DELETE, 
and a filename, MYFILE.DOC, as a parameter telling the command which

After the line has been processed, the inter-
preter retrieves the offset location of the next 
line and repeats the procedure. The exception 
to this straightforward progression occurs if a 
command, such as 
GOTO, branches 
execution to another 
section of the prog ram. 

102 
HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
How a Compiler Creates Software 
The interpreter in the previous illustration 
and a compiler are both software programs 
that translate program source code that 
humans understand, such as BASIC or C+, 
into machine language, which computers 
understand. The difference between a com-
piler and an interpreter is this: An interpreter 
translates the source code, line by line, each 
time the source program is run; a compiler 
translates the entire source code into an exe-
cutable file that a specific type of computer, 
such as a PC or Mac, runs without need of an 
interpreter. Most commercially sold or down-
loaded programs are compiled . 
The compiling process begins with a part of the 
compiler program called a lexer. It reads the 
entire source code one character at a time, and 
performs a process called lexical analysis. 
As it reads characters, the lexer tries to assem-
ble them into reserved words-computer 
commands-or punctuation characters that it 
understands. The lexer discards spaces, car-
riage returns, and remarks included by the pro-
grammer to explain what sections of the code 
are supposed to do. 
When the lexer comes across a reserved 
word or punctuation mark, it generates a 
code token. A token is like an abbreviation, 
representing more information succinctly. 
When the lexer finds a string of characters that don't form a reserved 
word, the lexer assumes that those characters stand for a variable. It 
assigns the variable a place in an identifier table that tracks the name 
and contents of every variable in the program. Then the lexer generates a 
variable token that points to the variable's position in the identifier 
table. When the lexer finds a string of numeric characters, the lexer con-
verts the string into an integer and produces an integer token to stand 
for it. 
IF X>3 THEN Y=2 ELSE Y=Z+3 
LE ER 
The result of the lexical analysis 
is a stream of tokens that 
represent everything of 
significance in the pro-
gram-commands, 
variables, and 
numbers.

Each node on the tree represents a program operation that generates data 
or an instruction that is passed to the node above it. The node, in turn, per-
forms another operation and passes that result to the node above it. When 
the parser is finished, the compiler has converted the entire program into a 
tree that represents the program's structure. The topmost node is called the

and so forth, all the way down to very specific nodes at the bottom of the

tree. 
-
A third part of the compiler called the code generator 
works its way through the syntax tree, producing seg-
ments of machine code of each node. To each node on 
the tree, the generator matches a template of machine 
code to the operation assigned to that node. 
The generator fills the blanks in each template 
with the values and variables found in each 
node. After each template is filled, it is 
added to the string of binary 
numbers that constitute the 
machine language and values 
of the program. 
In a final state, an optimizer inspects the code produced by the code generator, looking for 
redundancies. The optimizer eliminates any operation that produces results identical to those 
af the preceding operation, making the program turned out by the compiler smaller and faster.

How Windows 
Works 

CHAPTER 8 
HOW WINDOWS WORKS 
THE Windows operating system is more than just a pretty face. Sure, it's cute, with all the tiny pictures called 
icons, sound effects, your personal color scheme, and the capability to drag things around like pull-toys. 
But behind that face is a stern taskmaster. Both Windows XP and Windows Vista, Microsoft's two most 
advanced versions of Windows, are not your father's operating systems. Earlier versions of the consumer level 
of Windows were built on top of DOS, an elementary operating system for small computers and modest pro-
grams that came with the first PCs. DOS was inept at graphics, color, and sound, features that are common-
place in Windows. 
lOS 
More importantly, DOS was intended to run only one program at a time. There was no competition by dif-
ferent programs for the attention of the processor, memory, and drive storage. Computers back then might not 
have had much memory, but any program loaded into that memory had the run of the place. Now, these pro-
grams were expected to play nice and share such toys as RAM and the cpu. They didn't, of course. And when 
programs trampled on another program's RAM, Windows didn't know what to do and collapsed into the 
dreaded Blue Screen of Death. 
With XP and Vista, Windows finally got smart-and sneaky. As you'll discover in this chapter, Windows 
became enormously more stable when it used pretend computers so that each program thought it was the only 
program running on the pc. You'll also see how Windows is more than one program. It's a complex, inter-
twined organization of scores of programs, more like a hive than a single worker. 

106 
HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
How Windows XP Controls 
Programs Gone Wild 
Windows XP's first line of defense against crashes is the system virtual machine (VM). A 
virtual machine is a computer rendered entirely in software. The virtual machine emulates hard-
ware features, such as ports and external connections, to make each program believe that it's 
running on the real, physical PC, when it's actually running on the virtual computer. The 
has no knowledge of other virtual machines that might be running. The VM also runs the 
ing system's shell-usually 32-bit Microsoft Explorer-in a separate process. 
The VM gives each of the 32-bit programs a separate program with 
4GB of memory. (Of course, most of this memory is usually virtual 
RAM-drive disk storage that fools the processor into thinking 
the disk space is memory chip storage.) And 32-bit pro-
grams under XP practice preemptive multitask-
ing rather than cooperative multitasking. 
The VM gives each 16-bit program its 
own virtual machine. Each 16-bit pro-
gram thinks it's the only software run-
ning on a system. If one of the 
applications crashes, it's far less likely 
than in Windows 9x to bring down the 
rest of the system with it. Although each 
of the programs thinks it has exclusive 
rights to memory, drives, and other hard-
ware, it's only digital sleight-of-hand on 
the part of Windows XP, which con-
stantly juggles conflicting demands for 
resources. 
--------~----~~~ 
The system virtual machines are in the processor's user mode, ~ 
~~
where a rash action by a human can't plunge the computer into dis-
~ 
aster. Dangerous commands are stored in the kernel mode in a 
rich set of instructions called the kernel, or base system. The 
kernel mode is off-limits to applications. To call on any 16-bit or 32-
bit operations, applications must send requests through the API. 

CHAPTER 8 
HOW WINDOWS WORKS 
107 
The applications in their virtual machines are a rowdy bunch, digitally speaking . When any 
of the applications wants to call on any of Windows XP's core services, such as writing a 
file, the application must first go through the API-the Application Programming 
Interface. The API acts as a middle agent between the users, who could carelessly ask 
their applications to do something that could damage the kernel and its core services. 
The API contains three paired programs, half-
USER.EXE, GDI.EXE, and KRNL386.EXE-
for helping 16-bit Windows programs, and the 
other half-USER32.DLL, GDI32.DLL, and 
KERNEL32.DLL-for the full-blown 32-bit pro-
grams that XP prefers. The USER files contain 
the routines applications need to control and 
track windows. GDI files are collections of 
graphic elements applications use to build their 
dialog boxes and send information to the 
screen. The kernel files work with low-level 
operations, managing memory, input! output 
operations, and interrupts. 
In the kernel is a set of services, or subsys-
tems, code that powers the most common 
and most necessary functions in all Windows 
programs. Applications can use these ser-
vices with little risk of treading on forbidden 
memory addresses. To see how Vista protects 
programs from being trampled on by viruses 
or errant programs, see p. 116. 
Earlier PC processors could use memory at the higher numbered addresses only by using a method called segmented 
addresses. The address looks like this: 1234:E789, two sets of hexadecimal (base 16) numbers with four digits each . 
The first number is the segment, and the other is the offset from that segment. An analogy is a postal carrier who 
knows how to deliver mail to only houses numbered 1 to 100. But by using house numbers (offsets) combined with 
blocks (segments), the carrier can deliver mail to 100 houses on 1 st Street, move on to the second segment, 2nd Street, 
delivering to 100 houses with the same numbers as 1 st Street, and on to 3rd Street and beyond. Reading and writing 
memory was slower because the processor had to take an extra step to work with the segment and the offset. 

108 
HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
How Windows Shares Program Code 
El 
Windows 9x and Windows XP both provide several files called DLLs (dynamic link libraries). 
These are collections of software code that perform common software functions. Windows has one 
of the most frequently used DLLs, COMMDLG.DLL. As the name suggests, the DLL specializes in 
commonly used dialog boxes. Its functions include displaying File Open, File Save, Search, and 
Print dialog boxes. Microsoft is not the only creator of DLLs for Windows. Other companies have 
created DLLs to provide functions such as file compression or added printing abilities. 
An application that wants to take advantage of a DLL func-
tion first checks with an API (application programming 
interface) to find out how to call the function. All DLLs have 
APls to help an application make a successful call of a func-
tion from a DLL it's never encountered before. 
With the API 's help, the application calls 
the function to life by sending it the 
proper digital command. The application 
also sends any information the DLL func-
tion needs to complete the operation . For 
example, a program calling the Open 
File function in COMMDLG.DLL passes 
along a file specification, such as *. * or 
* .DOC, to be displayed in the dialog 
box's Filename text box. 
The application also passes along a 
specification for the type of information 
it expects the DLL to return to the appli-
cation when the DLL has done its job. 
The application, for example, might 
expect return information in the form of 
integers, true/ false values, or text. 
CAU 
DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARIES (DLLS) 
FILE SAVE 
SEARCH 

The DLL loads the specific rou-
tine into memory and then the 
processor executes it. At this 
point the DLL, rather than the 
application, is running things. 
The DLL performs all the oper-
ations necessary to communi-
cate with Windows and, 
through Windows, with the 
PC's hardware. 
After the DLL function is com-
plete, the DLL puts the return 
information into memory, where 
the application can find it, and 
instructs Windows to remove 
the DLL routine from memory. 
The application inspects the return 
information, which usually tells whether 
the DLL function was able to execute 
correctly. If the operation was a suc-
cess, the application continues from 
where it left off before issuing the func-
tion call. If the operation failed, the 
application displays an error message.

1 HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
How Windows Shares 
Data on the Clipboard 
The simplest way to share the same data among different doc-
uments and different applications is through the Windows 
Clipboard. Any time you select some data-text, graphics, 
spreadsheet cells-and copy it, Windows places a replica of 
that data into a section of memory reserved for its Clipboard. 
Actually, Windows creates three different versions of the data. 
Applications save their documents in different formats-
the exact coding that defines how the data is structured. 
When you copy or cut data, Windows transfers the selec-
tion to the Clipboard in multiple formats so that it can 
then be pasted into applications that use different formats. 
One format is that of the application that created the 
data. The second is a translation of the application's for-
matting codes for boldfacing, justification, fonts, and so 
on into a generic form called rich text format (RTF), 
which is recognized by all Windows applications. The 
third format is called OEM (original equipment 
manufacturer) text, which is used to paste text into 
DOS applications or when you prefer no formatting.

For example, if the data is a graphic, Windows saves it in 
three formats-the original format, such as .TIF or .PCX; a 
bitmap format; and a metafile format. A bitmap is a 
record of the specific pattern of display pixels that need to 
be turned on to re-create the image in its original size. A 
metafile is a collection of commands that can be used 
by the' graphic device interface (GDI) in 
Windows to re-create the image. Metafiles are resalu-
tion-independent; that is, they aren't locked into a specific 
array of pixels, as a bitmap is. This lets metafiles take 
advantage of all the resolution your display or printer can 
provide, and it lets you resize images without distorting 
them. (A metafile is often called an object-oriented 
graphic because it is stored as a series of distinct objects-

HOW WINDOWS WORKS 
When you paste data from the Clipboard, the application receiv-
ing the data inspects the various formats in which the data has 
been copied. If you are pasting data into the application from 
which it was copied, the application will choose its native format. 
111 
If you are pasting from one application into another, the receiving appli-
cation inspects all the formats saved on the Clipboard. The application is 
looking for formats it understands and for which one of them retains the 
most formatting information. For example, a metafile graphic is prefer-
able to a bitmapped graphic because a metafile contains more 
detailed information that the receiving application can use to 
change the graphic's size or placement on a page.

To paste data that's in a format other than its native one, the receiving 
application first translates any information about the format of the 
data-such as boldfacing or fonts-into the formatting codes the 
receiving application uses. If it is receiving a metafile graphic, the 
application sends the commands contained in the Clipboard to 
GDl.exe and GD132.dll in Windows, which control the graphic look of 
Windows XP and its ancestors. They, in turn, send the display driver 
the information the driver needs to create the graphic onscreen .

HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
How Vista Creates New Vistas 
Over the years, Microsoft has determinedly made Windows more and more 
graphic. Sure, it's been a marketing ploy and eye candy, but it has been more 
graphic. The idea has been to create zipperless computing. With a sweep of 
the mouse or, now, a spoken command, you can find information, finish your 
work faster, and even rain hell on intergalactic invaders. But until Vista came 
along, Windows' and hotshot graphics were not a perfect marriage. Game 
players-the ones to whom superior graphics are so important, they make 
Photoshop users look like doodling cavemen-for a long time refused to leave 
DOS because it gave software direct access to hardware for snappy action. In 
Vista and with the Vista-only DirectX 10 interface, Windows has finally claimed 
an innovative approach to graphics that Microsoft is rightly proud of. To under-
stand how Vista graphics work and why they are such an achievement, it helps 
to first take a look at how Windows graphics used to look. 
Even if you use graph ics 
software to enlarge an 
image by careful inter-
polation to determine 
what colors are needed 
to create a smoother, 
truer enlargement, the 
result is imprecise. 
Increase Size • 
=5 
Video Card 
Until Vista, the graphics used by Windows for icons, 
windows, thumbnails, wallpapers, logos-anything 
that contributed to the Windows graphic user 
interface (GUll-were bitmaps. Every pixel in a 
bitmap is assigned a specific color and position for 
that particular bitmap. If the graphic changes sizes, 
moves, or changes any of its features, Windows has 
to rebuild it from scratch or load it from the hard 
drive. The process is a drain on the central process-
ing unit and the result might only be a blocky approx-
imation of what the graphic should look like. 
The graphics in all but the low-end editions of 
Vista are built of vectors. Instead of describing 
each pixel every time the graphic changes, Vista 
uses a mathematical description of the graphic. To 
describe a sphere, a vector graphic would include 
the radius of the sphere and another number rep-
resenting the location of the center of the sphere. 
Another number would describe the color of the 
sphere. Still more numbers could tell Vista the 
intensity of the light striking the sphere and the 
direction it's coming from. 
Under Vista's new scheme for handling graphics, 
Windows Presentation Foundation, Vista 
does not have to determine the properties of thou-
sands of pixels for a new image and store them in 
memory just to change the size of the sphere. The 
operating system only has to substitute a new num-
ber for the radius, and a graphics processing 
unit (GPU) on a video card renders the new ball. 

ltpswitch WSJ TP Professional 
Several features that are new in Vista show the advantages and 
efficiencies of vector graphics. Once a vector image is created, 
it's a simple matter to resize and reuse it for other purposes. For 
example, pressing Alt+ Tab in earlier Windows versions displays 
the standard icons for each application that is running. With 
Vista, Vectors make it a simple job to resize the actual, real-time 
screens of each program to use instead of static icons. 
How Vista Manages the Desktop 
El 
. ~=---. 
Under the new Desktop 
Windows Manager 
(DWM) in Vista, each 
application sends DWM 
information about what 
would appear on screen 
if it were the only appli-
cation and were taking 
up the entire screen. 
DWM stores this informa-
tion in a buffer, dedi-
cated in RAM, for each 
application. 
When the information for all the screens has been 
gathered and stored, DWM uses it to construct the 
complete screen image, much like creating a mon-
tage from pictures clipped out of a magazine-
parts of some pictures are covered by others, but 
they are not discarded. If the artist changes his 
mind, it's a simple matter to move the partly hid-
den clipping so it is fully exposed and obscures 
some other clipping. 
Before Vista, when more than one e ement was on screen, Windows 
rendered only those parts of a dialog box, message box, or program 
that were "in the open." It didn't bother to render those parts of an 
application hidden by the displays of other programs. If you dragged 
a top-level program, Windows had to hurriedly calculate which pixels 
would be covered and which would be uncovered by the moving pro-
gram and repaint the screen to add the pixels coming into play for the 
first time. Windows then had to write the location and appearance of 
the pixels going into hiding, so it could faithfully restore them later. 
When the display drivers could not keep up with the software, moving 
a program or dialog box could leave a cascade of identical dia-
log boxes or a sweep of empty white space 

114 
HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
How the Aero 
Interface Sees All 
Contributing to this new flexibility of onscreen elements are the 
pixels themselves-not the actual physical pixels we see on the 
screen, but the logical pixels the software sees. The logical 
pixels come with characteristics-shadings-that are evoked, 
not unsurprisingly, by shaders, specialized functions with 
which the GPU manipulates graphics on the pixel level. 
Returning to the example of a sphere created in vector graph-
ics, it's as if the GPU shouted, "Glisten!" and the pixels 
changed their colors, saturation, and luminance so the sphere's 
surface looked as if it had just taken a dunk in water. 
Shading is not all the 
shaders' control. They add 
details, control movements 
on the pebble level, and 
enforce the laws of 
physics. Because shading 
calculates the visual effects 
on a pixel-by-pixel basis, 
the technique produces 
incredible detail, as shown 
in these two screen shots, 
one of which was rendered 
with older technology and 
the other with pixel 
shaders. 
Pixel shading is also responsible for 
the glass effects on the Aero desktop. 
Each element on the desktop is fully 
rendered, whether or not you can see 
it. All it takes to reveal, for example, a 
dialog box hidden behind the start 
menu, is for the pixels in the menu to 
activate a translucent shading.

How ClearType Divides 
and Con~ue t e 
Jaggies 
CRT Pixel --
Computer monitors create text and graphics on a matrix-a grid of invisible vertical a 
a display can light up a pixel. The problem with the matrix is diagonal lines and edges don't fit well, and the result is jaggies, the 
pointy shapes that appear whenever a distance along a diagonal line is smaller than the distance from one pixel to another. For 
example, here a diagonal edge formed by the barn's roof creates jaggies because the successively smaller divisions of the edge 
invariably become smaller than the screen's pixels. This is also called aliasing. 
LCD Pixel 
El 
One way to combat aliasing is with anti-aliasing, a trick that takes advantage of how the eye per-
ceives shades of color, so that blurring the colors along a diagonal line actually makes the line look 
sharper. Anti-aliasing disguises the jaggies by using pixels along the edge that are a mixture of the two 
colors on either side of the line. The eye sees these pixels, not as separate colors dotting the intersec-
tion of sky and barn, but as a sharper drawing of the edge. 
For text, Vista carries the concept of anti-aliasing to the subpixellevel, provided the text is displayed 
on an LCD screen. The technique, ClearType, does not work well with the old CRT monitors because 
their red, blue, and green subpixels form a triangle. The subpixels on LCD monitors are in horizontal 
rows. 
In addition to any anti-aliasing Vista may perform on 
the slanted strokes in text, ClearType also uses one or 
two of the three colors in each pixel to fill in gaps 
caused by aliasing. By turning off those subpixels, 
ClearType extends the black text to make minute 
changes in the shape so the text is easier to read. 
Without ClearType, the slant here would have had to 
follow the pixels outlined in white.

How Vista Protects 
Your PC with Decoys 
Under Windows XP, a person with administrator rights can run any program and create or change files anywhere in the computer. 
Ordinary users are limited to the programs they can run and the files they can see. Most users setting up their own computers understand-
ably give themselves an administrator's super user permissions. Generally, software assumes administrator rights are in effect and that 
the programs can write to 
any file or any part of the' 
registry of Windows.

El 
For each person using a computer, Vista's UAC sets up file and registry 
virtualization. User access control creates for each person a virtual system of 
directories and registry entries that mimic directories, such as C: \program files, 
and parts of the registry ordinary users do not have permission to work with. 
When a program tries to write a file to, for example, 
the C: \program files directory, Vista instead writes 
the file to the virtual version of C: \program files. 
Later if any program tries to read the file, Vista redi-
rects the read request to the virtual file. To the pro-
gram and the user, these switch-a-roos, like a TV 
episode of Mission Impossible, are indistinguishable 
from the real thing. 
With virtualization, any virus that attempts to access 
forbidden files is routed to the virtual directories; the 
virus does its dirty work and there's nothing to tip it 
off that it has not succeeded.

C If an application-or a virus-wants to 
perform some restricted operation in a 
forbidden zone, UAC prompts the user 
for confirmation . (This may be the user's 
first clue that a virus is at work.) Once 
the user confirms the need for access to 
restricted operations, UAC carries out 
the action using the unrestricted token. 
Once the action is complete, it returns 
control to the restricted token . 
CHAPTER 8 
HOW WINDOWS WORKS 
C File and registry virtualization is by 
itself not enough to protect a com-
puter when a super user is at the 
keyboard. Under XP, malicious soft-
ware is free to take advantage of 
the super user's access to sensitive 
areas. When a user logs in as an 
administrator, UAC registers two 
tokens. The first token authorizes 
the user to do anything an adminis-
trator normally does. The second 
token restricts privileges to those of 
a standard user. 
m 
Once the login is complete, the second, 
restricted token is in control, restricting 
the user and all programs to approved 
actions.

CHAPTER 9 
HOW SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS DO YOUR WORK 
HERE'S the quick definition of application software: It's everything except the operating system. 
Windows, DOS, OS X, UNIX, and other operating systems exist only so you can run applications-your 
apps. The long definition of apps encompasses everything from first-person shooter games such as Bioshock 
to the most strait-laced accounting program. Increasingly, the distinction between operating systems and 
applications is blurring as Windows, in particular, grows to encompass jobs that were once the purview of 
separate applications: faxing, file management, animation, videoconferencing, and most notoriously, brows-
ing. But there are still applications whose power and scope exceed anything that could be packed into an 
operating system. In fact, if a job involves information, there's a program out there that will handle it. 
What all software has in common is data. Data can appear in the form of stock prices, addresses, money, 
dates, statistics, phone numbers, recipes, probabilities, dots of color, pages of text, notes of music, the num-
ber of lives left in a game, positions in a virtual world, or your longitude and latitude on Earth. Data are raw 
facts. Names are data, and so are the letters that make up the word" names." Even computer code is consid-
ered data (which means data is manipulating data, a line of thought that is perilous to pursue). And all data 
are numbers, even if they're words or colors. 
Computerdom has, by mutual consent, agreed on a standard called ANSI (American National 
Standards Institute). In ANSI, each letter of the alphabet, punctuation, numbers, and even an empty 
space is assigned an 8-bit binary number. Eight bits is enough to represent all the decimal numbers between 
o and 255. A capital "A" is 65. A capital "B" is 66. A lowercase "b" is 98. An @ symbol is 64. $ is 36. ? 
is 63. 1 is 49, and 49 is 52 followed by 57. (Another path better left untrampled.) 
All sounds can be expressed in numbers in the form of frequencies, amplitudes, and decibels. Your PC 
displays the colors on your screen by resorting to some combination of red, blue, and green-the only pure 
colors a display can create. With only 256 values representing 256 shades each of red, blue, and green, 
your monitor can produce more colors than most eyes can distinguish. 
No matter what kind of data you feed into a computer, the PC ultimately sees it only as numbers, strings 
of zeros and ones written with transistors in the microchips of your motherboard (see Chapter 5). The deci-
mal numbers of ANSI are converted to binary. A capital "A" becomes 01000001. A lowercase "b" is 
01100010. After you master the concept that virtually anything can be represented as some collection of 
numbers-especially binary numbers-you have a good concept of what computing is made of. 
Data, alone, though, is not really helpful. For example, 2.439, Donald Trump, green tells you nothing. It 
is not yet information. What software does is make data useful; it processes the data into information. No 
one program can process all kinds of data. Different raw data must be processed differently. Generally, soft-
ware falls into one of these categories: database management, word processing, number crunching, graph-
ics, multimedia, communications, or utilities. Each of those categories has more specialized subcategories: 
• 
Database management underlies most other software, but it surfaces most visibly in inventory, mail list, 
contact management, and other software ranging from family-tree builders to digital jukeboxes. 
• 
Word processing extends to desktop publishing and Web page design. 
• 
Numbers-as numbers, not the ANSI kind---are crunched in electronic spreadsheets, accounting pro-
grams, and financial software. 
• 
Graphics programs range from the precision technical drawing of computer-aided design (CAD) to the 
Paint program that comes with Windows. 
119 

120 
HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
• 
Multimedia includes anything that can be depicted best in pictures, music, sounds, and spoken 
words, whether an encyclopedia such as Encarta or a game such as Call of Duty 4. 
• 
Communications software, once the province of thorough dweebs who never left the house, has 
been made the most vigorous category because of the Internet, electronic commerce, email, and 
broadcasti ng. 
• 
Utilities are programs that help other software run better. They speed up drive access, clean up out-
dated files, and compress files. Utilities are truly geek software, and they are not discussed in this 
chapter, but you can find out how file compression works in Chapter 12. Multimedia and communi-
cations are covered in more detail in Parts 6 and 7. 
Database Managers 
Software's reason for being is juggling. Whether the data are words, facts, or numbers, software finds 
new ways to compare, sort, order, merge, separate, and connect it-all an impressive juggling act. 
Collect a lot of data in some organized way, and you have a database. The software used most often 
to do that is called a database manager. 
If you've visited a library that still uses card files, you've worked with one type of non-computerized 
database: one that illustrates perfectly the advantages of a computerized database. Typically, libraries 
have three sets of 3x5-inch card files: One set includes a card for each book in the library, sorted 
alphabetically by title; a second set also has a card for each book, but sorted by authors' names; and 
the third set is sorted by subject matter. That arrangement makes it easier for library patrons to find a 
book if they have only one piece of information about it; however, it is a terrible duplication of 
resources. The same information is repeated on cards in each of the three files. Obviously, it would be 
simpler and more efficient to have only one set of records that you can search by title, name, or subject 
matter. And that's exactly the advantage of a computerized database: It stores data that can be 
accessed and manipulated in many different ways. 
Many programs that we don't think of as databases actually involve some form of database man-
agement. One reason why electronic spreadsheets such as Lotus 1-2-3 and Excel have become so pop-
ular is that, in addition to being capable of calculating complicated mathematical formulas, they can 
sort and extract both mathematical and textual data. Accounting and inventory programs are special-
ized databases. Even word processors use database features in their spelling checkers and mail-merge 
operations. But the databases we'll look at here are those dedicated exclusively to the collections of 
data. The range of tasks a database manager can perform varies with the complexity of the program. 
But in general, they all do these jobs: 
• 
Database managers let you define a data type for the information you want to store; alphanumeric 
or numeric, for example. They also define a data format that aids in retrieving and organizing the 
data. A single piece of data might, for example, be limited to a certain length or to specific values. 
• 
Database managers store data in records. A record is a collection of data about a particular per-
son, place, or thing. The individual items are contained in fields, similar to the blank areas on a 
paper form. A record, for example, could include fields for information on one person's name, 
address, and phone number. The records are displayed in an onscreen form, where field data is 
entered, edited, deleted, and viewed. Several records with the same fields of information for 
entries constitute a table. 

CHAPTER 9 
HOW SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS DO YOUR WORK 
121 
• 
Database managers carry out queries, which are searches for data that meet specified criteria, 
to allow you to retrieve certain subsets of the data. These queries sort and filter the data to let 
you see it from different angles. A typical query, for example, would ask the database to display 
all records for bills that are more than 60 days overdue. 
• 
Database managers perform calculations on the data. Not only do they do mathematical calcula-
tions, they also perform "if true" logic tests-if inventory is below X amount, order more-and 
parse text data, allowing you to perform operations such as combining a person's first and last 
names from two pieces of data into one. 
• 
Finally, database managers present the data in a formatted, easy-to-read report, which can 
include calculations on the data, such as the total value of sales orders taken from several store 
locations. 
How database managers perform these operations varies with the type of database. Many databases 
are designed for simple on-the-fly use. They provide ready-made tools and commands for performing 
relatively simple, common operations, such as searching and sorting. More powerful database man-
agers, such as Microsoft Access, Corel Paradox, and Lotus Approach, include their own programming 
or script languages that let the managers be used to create other specialized applications designed for 
specific tasks, such as maintaining a wine list or handling personnel records. A person might use an 
inventory program without realizing it was created in the Paradox programming language. 
Database managers are distinguished from one another on another basic level. Some can manipu-
late only one collection of data-a table---at a time; these database programs are called flat-file 
database managers. Other managers can link data from several different tables. They're called rela-
tional database managers because they define relationships among common elements of different 
tables. 
In this chapter, we'll look at some of the fundamental operations performed by database man-
agers: storing data; creating indexes that allow fast retrieval of data; and, in the case of relational 
database managers, linking data from different tables. 
Spreadsheet Software 
A program called VisiCalc is responsible for the fact that you're using a personal computer today. The 
early PCs-by today's standards, wimpy machines-made by Radio Shack, Apple, and Commodore, 
were mostly the playthings of electronics hobbyists. The mere fact that these hobbyists could buy a 
functioning, real computer was enough in itself to satisfy their experimental urges. The computer didn't 
have to do anything really useful, as the big mainframe computers did. 
Then, two young men named Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston wrote a software program called 
VisiCalc, and the direction of the personal computer changed radically. Suddenly there was a real, 
practical reason to buy a Pc. Running on the Apple II, VisiCalc was an electronic version of what 
accountants, department managers, bankers, and financial officers had been staring at on paper for 
ages: the spreadsheet. In both its paper and computerized forms, the spreadsheet is simply a grid of 
vertical and horizontal lines into which labels and numbers can be entered to keep track of all sorts of 
numerical records, usually financial. But there is an important difference between the paper and elec-
tronic versions. On paper, to enter the sum of a long column of numbers, you must add them manually 

122 
HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
or with the aid of a calculator, and then pencil in the result. If any numbers in the column change, you 
must pullout the calculator and do the whole job over again. 
With an electronic spreadsheet, you can enter a formula that represents the sum of that same col-
umn of numbers, and the computer program will do the calculation and enter the result in the proper 
position on the grid. If the numbers change later, the electronic spreadsheet will automatically recalcu-
late the formula and enter the new sum. 
If the spreadsheet did nothing more than such simple calculations, it would still be a great saver of 
time and labor. But it actually does much more complicated tasks. Complex mathematical formulas are 
reduced to a few formula commands. Also, various cells-the rectangles formed by the grid's lines-
can be linked so the results of one calculation become an element in a formula elsewhere. A change in 
the data in one cell can cascade in seconds through hundreds of calculations scattered among thou-
sands of cells. 
Imaginative business people quickly saw how this new computer program was a real business tool 
that justified the cost of personal computers, making microcomputers machines for the office rather than 
merely toys for hobbyists. The demand for PCs created a market for programmers, who in turn created 
database managers, word processors, and other software that generated, in an upward spiral, more 
demand for PCs. 
Early electronic spreadsheets were significant in another way. They represented the first graphic 
user interface (GUI), a term reserved today for the way that Windows and Macintosh systems dis-
play programs. Compared to today's GUls, the first electronic spreadsheet was a crude but recogniz-
able onscreen representation of the paper ledger that people were already used to. That fact made it 
simple for computer users to grasp how the electronic spreadsheet was supposed to work. That capa-
bility to mimic real-world tools continues to be one of software's greatest strengths. One historical note: 
No one uses VisiCalc today. Although it broke important ground in the development of the PC, 
VisiCalc failed to keep up with the innovations of other electronic spreadsheets, such as Lotus 1-2-3, 
Excel, and Quattro Pro, which added database and graphing capabilities to VisiCalc's number crunch-
ing. Similarly, the software you find most useful on your PC today will probably look ridiculously primi-
tive in another decade. 
In this chapter, we'll look at two of the fundamental operations of electronic spreadsheets: how 
they arrange all the data in their cells so that cells can be linked to one another, and how formulas are 
used to perform the spreadsheets' calculations. 
VVord Processors 
The office personal computer quickly grew from a number cruncher to a word processor-not sur-
prising when you consider how the business world most often communicates-with words. Whether 
through a company policy booklet, a letter to a customer, an annual report, or a memo to tell some 
boss to take this job and shove it, people in business communicate in written words, and they want 
those words to be perfect. 
A sheet of paper that's a crazy quilt of whiteout and penciled corrections might be an accurate 
record of words, but by today's computer-perfect standards it simply is not acceptable. Nor should it 

CHAPTER 9 
HOW SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS DO YOUR WORK 
be. Word processors provide tools not just to record and print words but to make them attractive and 
more communicative; and not with words alone, but with photos, graphics, and color. 
In this chapter, we'll look at the function most crucial to this task: formatting text onscreen in prepa-
ration for sending it to the printer. 
Graphics Software 
We think of the Mona Lisa as a brilliant example of Renaissance art, as a mysterious image, or as a 
thoughtful study in composition, light, and shadow. We don't think of it as a mathematical formula. But 
in the computer world, all art, graphics, shapes, colors, and lines involve some type of mathematical 
algorithm. That statement isn't meant to belittle the works of Da Vinci and other great artists. 
Mathematical algorithms cannot create art; that still takes a true artist, whether the artist's tools are 
brush, oils, and canvas or a computerized stylus. But math embedded in specific file formats can 
describe any piece of existing art. A graphics-file image of the Mona Lisa that you can display on your 
PC is the result of mathematical calculations on the bytes of data saved in that file. 
Today, all the capabilities of a darkroom and an artist's studio are available on a personal com-
puter. You can retouch, lighten, darken, crop and do virtually anything else to a computer image that 
you could do to a photograph. You can do more, really. With a PC, even a semi-skilled retoucher can 
make Mona Lisa frown. Other software lets an artist re-create the effects of different media: oils, water-
colors, airbrush, charcoal, and so on. The artist can even mix media in ways that are difficult to match 
in real life-to obtain, say, the effect of a water-based paint dissolving chalk lines on paper. 
Modern PC graphics are not just about creating pretty pictures. We live in a world of images and 
colors; not a world of words, which are, after all, only abstractions for the things we see, feel, touch, 
and do. We use shape and color in everyday life to convey information faster than words can. Just 
consider the red, octagonal stop sign; you can be illiterate and know what it means. So, too, in com-
puters, graphics are an increasingly important way of conveying information. Imagine an onscreen 
map of a city, showing in red those Zip code areas where family income is more than $100,000. You 
comprehend it at a glance. A spreadsheet printout of the same information consisting of nothing but 
numbers would require ponderous study to comprehend. 
Shapes and colors are information as surely as words are. The difference is that words are nicely 
defined and limited, but shapes and colors have infinite variations, which means that a PC handling 
graphics is up against a more daunting job than the old text-based DOS computers. There are two 
basic ways in which graphics software copes with this infinity of variation: through bitmap and vector 
graphics. This chapter looks at how bitmapped and vector images are stored and how graphics soft-
ware translates the data into images.

How a Database Organizes Information 
Field Records 
Most database information is stored in fixed-length fields, 
so called because the number of characters-spaces-that can 
be used for each field is determined when the database is cre-
ated . The beginning of a fixed-length field file contains 
information that defines the file's record structure-
each field's name, data type (usually numeric or 
alphanumeric), and length. In addition, the structure 
might include information on the format of the data held 
in the field; for example, a field used to record dates might 
require the MM-DD-YY (month-day-year) format. A field can 
also be required to validate the information 
entered into it; for example, if the data entered 
into a validating state field is not one of the 50 
postal service abbreviations, it will be rejected. 
The rest of the file is data, laid down in one continuous 
stream . The locations at which specific pieces of data 
are recorded are determined by the lengths allotted to 
each field. 
To find any given record, the database software calculates 
the location's offset through a simple formula: The number 
of a particular record multiplied by the total length of each 
record equals the starting point of that record . With the 
starting point calculated, the program reads the bytes begin-
ning at that point in the file. 
Record length 
Record number 
Minus 1 
2 x 52 
Record 3 starts at 104 bytes 
To locate fields within each record, the program 
follows a similar process of calculating the num-
ber of bytes in the fields preceding the field it 
wants to find, and then reads bytes at the field's 
starting point. 
To modify an existing record, the database software reads the record 
into variables it creates in the computer's RAM and lets you modify the 
information in these variables through an onscreen form . The software 
then writes the new contents of these variables to the database file. 
I"ILrn"''''U'''\~I\I'-,' LENGTH=20; FIELD="ADDRESS"; 
20 bytes 
156 bytes 
p>''-''-'''--''-..., 176 bytes 
As new records are 
added, they're sim-
ply stuck onto the 
end of the database 
file. The data itself is 
rarely reorganized 
or sorted in the file 
in any way. For that, 
the software uses 
indexes. 

CHAPTER 9 
HOW SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS DO YOUR WORK 
125 
Variable-Length Field Records 
Information can also be stored in variable-length fields, which, as their 
name suggests, are fields whose size can change from one record to another. 
Memo files are separate files linked to a fixed-length database file. Memo 
files are made up entirely of clusters of text; for example, memos, which can 
~:;.::;;::==:.J .. ____ 
each be up to thousands of bytes long. 
In the memo file's related fixed-length record, one of 
the fields is devoted to recording where the corre-
sponding text begins in the memo file. 
This type of field is called a pointer 
because, although it contains no data 
that's useful in and of itself, the field's contents point 
to where the real information can be found. 
To read the memo text, the database manager software 
reads the value of the pointer from the fixed-length file, 
goes to the specified point in the memo, and begins 
reading text until it reaches a code that marks the end of 
the memo. The computer user never actually sees the 
information in the pointer field. Instead, as far as the 
on screen display goes, the software replaces the pointer 
with the words to which it's pointing. The combined infor-
mation from two files appears seamless. 
To add more data to an existing vari-
able field, the database software first 
writes the additional text to the end of 
the memo file. 
I 6WBmS71fl1iPM ' 
The software then replaces the end-of-record marker with a pointer to the 
I~~ 
disk location at which the rest of the field's text can be found. Longer memos 
~ 
might end up being stored in several separate segments, with the end of 
each segment pointing to the beginning of the next segment. 

126 
HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
How a Database Stores Records 
~ 
To index records, the database 
manager first requires you to tell 
it on which of the fields the index 
is to be based. This field is called 
the key field. Some databases can 
have more than one index and more 
than one key field . 
IE] The database manager reads each 
record and constructs a temporary file 
consisting of the values contained in 
each record's key field and correspond-
ing pointers that give the location of 
each record in the database file. If 
duplicate values are found , each dupli-
cate entry is recorded in the index file. 
After the database program has 
read all the values and their point-
ers, or record numbers, into the 
temporary file, it arranges the 
copied values in alphanumeric 
order, creating an index. 

CHAPTER 9 
HOW SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS DO YOUR WORK 
127 
The database writes the ordered information to an index file that is structured as a binary tree. The binary tree, or b-tree, is designed 
to speed up the process of finding information in the index file. It's an upside-down tree in which each node has two branches. These 
branches break logical divisions of the index file into increasingly smaller halves. For example, A-M represents one of the first two 
branches of the tree and N-Z represents the other main branch. A b-tree search lets a database search a million-entry index by 
checking only 20 sets of nodes rather than each of the one million nodes. 
When the database manager needs to find records based on the key 
field, it checks successive branches of the b-tree. If the man-
ager is looking for records whose key fields begin with an I, 
;.:.A-M
....:.:.:. _______ 
...1-_______ 
N:.;:-....;
Z 
for example, the manager starts by looking down the main 
trunk of the tree, where it finds key-field values 
beginning with A-M. 
Because I comes before M in the alpha-
bet, the manager next looks at the 
A- B 
key-field values halfway between A 
and M. There, it finds values begin-
ning with G. I comes after G, so the 
manager looks halfway between 
G and M, and so on, until it finds 
values beginning with I. 
Eventually, the manager arrives at an end 
node-the leaf, so to speak-which con-
tains a short, fixed number of entries 
(eight or so, depending on the pro-
gram) and their pointers. It finds the 
entry it has been looking for and uses 
the pointer to locate the actual record in the 
database table.

[] To re-index the database after new 
records have been added to the 
database, the program puts each

the index's b-tree.

If there's no room under the leaf, the software creates two new 
nodes under what had been the last node. For example, an L node 
would be divided into an LA-LK node and an LL-LZ node, each of 
which would receive roughly half of the parent node's information.

How Databases Make Connections 
~ 
Imagine moving to a new city and filling out a single form that automatically updates information about your new address and 
phone number on your driver's license, in the phone book, all your subscriptions, your bank records-everyone you deal with. 
That's the concept behind a relational database. It separates information into tables that share each other's data. A change of 
information in anyone of the tables is picked up by any other table that needs it. A relational database is designed so that most 
information must be entered only once, and yet it can be used by more than one table of data . 
.----------------:=---- Common field -----, 
When you need to access informa-
tion stored in the database, you use 
a form or report that has been cre-
ated to work with that database. It 
displays the fields that hold the infor-
mation you want to retrieve. In this 
example, you want to obtain infor-
mation about authors and their 
The form for this example specifies several fields 
from the Authors table, so the software finds that 
table, pulls out the contents of those fields for the 
current record, and displays them onscreen. 
The Authors table contains fields for the 
name, nationality, year of birth, and year of death of each of several authors. 
The Books table contains only the titles, publisher names, prices, and author 
names for books. The Author field in the Authors table is the primary key for 
the relationship between the tables. A primary key must be a unique field in 
the parent table; that is, it must identify only a single record in that table. The 
Books table in this example is called the child table. The Author field is also 
a part of the Books table, but in that table, the contents of the Author field are 
not unique: The same name can appear in several records. (One way to 
remember these terms is to 
recall that a parent table 
can be related to several 
children, but a child table 
has only one set of par-
ents.) 

CHAPTER 9 
HOW SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS DO YOUR WORK 
The database manager then goes to the index of the Books table to find all the records with 
" Hemingway" in the Author field . It uses the pointers of those index entries to locate the right records 
in the Books table, and then it pulls out the requested fields and displays those onscreen. When you 
switch to a new record in the Author table (for example, Fitzgerald), the software displays that infor-
mation from the Author table, and then goes back to find all the records in the Books table that have 
Author fields matching the new record . 
C A single report or form might include 
data from many different tables and 
incorporate a complex set of relation-
ships created by the use of multiple 
links.

HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
How Spreadsheets Solve Formulas 
When you type a formula into a cell, the 
spreadsheet processes the formula 
through a minicompiler that converts 
the function names into a more efficient, 
tokenized format, in which functions are 
represented by specific numbers. For 
example, functions such as SIN and 
COS are converted into specific byte 
values the spreadsheet recognizes as 
meaning sine or cosine. The compiler 
also stores the formulas in reverse 
Polish notation, so that, for example, 
(3 + 2) * 10 becomes 3 2 + 10 *. This 
type of notation is more efficient in terms 
of both space and speed. 
4 
5 
The result of the compilation is written to a memory location 
reserved for that cell. The location also includes room for the 
result of the calculation, a pointer to the next formula in the 
spreadsheet, and a pointer to the previous formula. The pointers 
create, in effect, a list of those cells that contain formulas and 
save the program the time it would take to search every 
cell for formulas during recalculation. When you 
delete one formula, its pointer to a pre-
vious formula is used to recon-
nect the formula chain.

Auto Recalc 
If you've turned on a spreadsheet's automatic recalc feature, the spread-
sheet is updated every time you make a change that affects any formula. 
How does it do this? When you create a formula, the spreadsheet software 
marks all the cells on which that formula depends by changing a notation in 
each of their records. In addition, it leaves itself hints in those cells about 
how to find the formulas that depend on them, a more efficient method than 
using pointers. When you make a change to any cell that's been marked in 
this way, the software finds the formula or formulas that are affected and 
recalculates them.

How Bitmaps Save 
Artwork 
~ 
When a graphics program reads a bitmapped file from a drive, it first looks at information contained in the file's header, which is 
several bytes at the beginning of the file that contain information the program needs to interpret the data in the rest of the file. The 
header begins with a signature that identifies the file as a bitmap. You don't see this signature, but you can tell that a file is a 
bitmap if it has an extension such as .BMP, .PCX, .TIF, or .JPG. Following the signature, the header tells the width and height of the 
image in pixels, which are distinct points of light, and then defines the palette (how many and which colors are used in the image) .

After determining the parameters of the graphic file, the 
program reads the bytes of data following the header that 
contain the image as a pattern of bits. The simplest 
bitmapped image has only black-and-white pixels. For 
images of this type, the graphics program needs only two 
pieces of information: the location of a pixel and whether 
to turn the pixel on or off. The locations of the pixels are 
determined by the image's width and height as defined in 
the header. In this crude image of a man in a hat, the line 
pixels wrap every 11 bits to the next row of pixels.

In the memory set aside for video display, the bytes that make up the black-and-white 
image consist of some bits set to 1 and the rest to O. A 1 means a pixel that corresponds to 
that bit should be turned on. A 0 bit indicates a pixel should be turned off. The man in the 
hat consists of 121 pixels, which in a black-and-white image can be stored in 16 bytes.

CHAPTER 9 
A color bitmap 
requires more than 
1 bit of information 
for each pixel. 
Eight bits (or 1 
byte) per pixel are 
enough data to define a palette 
of 256 colors because 8 bits of binary 
information has a total of 28 possible val-
ues, or 256. (The values shown here are in 
HOW SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS DO YOUR WORK 
hexadecimal, a BASE-16 number system that uses 
A-F as well as 0-9.) Each possible 8-bit value is 
matched in the palette to a specific combination of red, 
blue, and green dots that make up a single pixel. Although 
the dots of color are separate, they're close enough to each other 
that the eye sees them as a single point of blended color, called a 
virtual pixel. 
For 24-bit graphics, 3 
bytes of memory are used to 
define each pixel. Three bytes 
provide enough data to define more 
than 16 million possible colors (224), 
which is why 24-bit color is sometimes 
referred to as true color-it's difficult to 
imagine that any real-life shade would not be 
among the 16 million. A common way of ren-
dering 24-bit color is to have each of the three 
bytes assigned to a pixel represent the amount of 
red, green, or blue that makes up the pixel. The values 
of the three bytes determine how much of each color goes 
into the pixel. Think of the difference between 8-bit and 24-
bit color this way: 8-bit lets you choose from 256 colors that 
are "premixed," the way some cans of house paint are sold; a 24-
bit method essentially mixes custom colors for each pixel on the fly. 
Note that in configuring Windows, you're likely to see 32-bit as a color 
depth option . The higher number doesn't mean more colors, however. In this 
case, the extra bits are used to render an alpha channel that handles the 
transparency and translucency of images and objects.

of all the pixels to the average; your

CHAPTER 9 
HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
135 
Software, in a camera or computer, that compresses a file in the JPEG format exam-
ines the file for pixels whose absence is unlikely to be noticed by the uncritical 
human eye. More accurately, it's not their absence that's overlooked; it's the fact 
that they've been disguised to look like neighboring pixels. If half of the area of a 
landscape photograph is devoted to a cloudless sky, saving the color values of each 
of the pixels making up the sky is an extravagance when many of the pixels are 
exactly the same shade and intensity of blue. 
Rather than recording the 24 bits needed to describe each pixel, the compression 
software records the bits for only one-the reference pixel-and then writes a list 
of the locations of every pixel that is the same color. 
Banding 
A problem with JPEG compression has been that a photo is 
recompressed-with more original pixels thrown away-
each time it is re-saved to the JPEG format. If it's saved too 
many times, you increase the appearance of unnatural 
banding-obvious strips of color instead of smooth grada-
tions as you see, for example, in the sky. It also causes arti-
fads-shapes and colors that weren't in the original photo 
and are solely the product of mathematics. Eventually the 
photo may come to look posterized, so named after 
posters that have been simplified by using only a few colors. 
A more recent form of JPEG, called JPEG 2000-using a .jp2 
or .j2k file extension-compresses photos by using wavelet 
technology, a type of mathematical calculation that transforms 
pixel values into strings of numerical tokens for frequently recur-
ring combinations of pixels, such as combinations of red and 
blue pixels that might be used to create a brown tree trunk. The 
strings replace the cruder blocks of JPEG compression and result 
in smaller files without the same types of visual artifacts seen in 
standard JPEG photos.

HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
How Vector Graphics 
Change Shape 
El 
A vector-based graphic image is stored in a 
file as a display list that describes in mathematical 
terms every shape, or object, in the image along 
with its location and properties, such as line width 
and fill (the color pattern that fills a shape). The 
display list also specifies the hierarchy of 
objects-which ones should be drawn first and 
which are on top of others. Vector graphics differ 
from bitmapped graphics, which are locked into 
an unchanging size and shape. Vector graphics 
can change size and shape by changing the math 
that defines them. 
To draw an object, the program must know 
the locations of only a few points. The for-
mula for a Bezier curve, for example, 
needs only four points: the beginning 
point, the ending point, and two control 
points that determine how far the curve is 
"pulled" away from a straight line. 
The points are each defined by two num-
bers-one for the point's vertical position 
and the other for the horizontal position. 
Each of those numbers is stored to a much 
higher degree of precision than the pixel 
locations alone could specify. This preci-
sion allows the software to draw the curve 
accurately, no matter how much its size is 
increased or decreased, or if it's moved or 
otherwise manipulated. 

5 
To display a fill, the program computes a mathemati-
cal formula that determines the locations of all the pix-
els that make up the edge of the shape. With that 
information, the program can determine which pixels 
are inside the shape and change the color values for 
all those pixels to match the fill. 
LEVEL: 1 
FILL --
-;; 
ANGLE: 90 
DESCRIPTION: 
6 
Any time you change or move a shape, change a 
shape's aHributes (such as its color), or add a new 
object to the image, the software changes the data stored in the display list for all 
the affected objects. Data for any object not changed is left unmodified. Viewing 
transform then recomputes the display bitmap to update the screen .

HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
How Software Uses Numbers to 
Correct Photos 
The humongous advantage of using numbers to represent images is that you can lighten or darken an image, bring out contrast, sharpen or 
blur it, turn it upside down, or transform it into a psychedelic abstract, all by using simple arithmetic. It's not so simple that we can sit at a 
computer with the Mona Lisa on the screen and subtract numbers from the color values in Mona's portrait, turning her smile into a frown. It 
would be an excruciating job, the kind of job computers are made for. A PC can calculate a frown job on Mona in less than 10 seconds. 
It's all just a numbers game. 
~ 
Your digital camera records your digital photo as a set of tiny pixels. As you look closer at a photo, you begin to see the pixels as 
jagged edges and then squares. What you thought were distinct lines and boundaries turn out to be more gradual transitions 
between colors. 

CHAPTER 9 
HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
139 
El 
Zoom in far enough and you see 
that each pixel is actually a tiny 
square consisting of a single, 
solid color. 
When you tell your image editing software 
to make a change, such as sharpen, 
brighten, or apply effects, the software 
looks at the differences in color between 
pixels. Often, it compares those values 
with pixels that are close but not touching 
the pixels under scrutiny. 
~ ............ PEN FILTER 
The software applies a mathematical formula to recal-
culate the color of each pixel. It starts with the formula 
for the type of editing or effect you are asking it to do. 
It also takes into account the differences in color 
between pixels, often those in or near transition areas. 
Not all pixels are changed equally. Some pix-
els might retain the same general color but take 
on a slightly darker or lighter tone. Other pixels 
might be assigned a very different color. Pixels 
that are not near a border area might not be 
changed at all.

How Photo Editors Restore 
Old Pictures 
Color photos are subject to the same slings and arrows of outrageous shoe boxes that torment 
black-and-white pictures-the dirt, the creases, the spills, the humidity, and of course 
the fatal reactions that occur when the still-active chemicals of one photo-
graph are crammed up against those of another picture for a 
decade or so. But the chemicals in color photos are still 
more volatile and more susceptible to turning the only 
picture of beloved Uncle Ernie into what looks like an 
extraterrestrial blob of protoplasm. Luckily for all the myr-
iad misfortunes that can affect photos, we have an arsenal 
of E.R. weaponry to bring them back from the brink. There 
are so many tools in the digital darkroom, there's no space 
to cover them all in detail, but here are some of the most 
common devices available in programs such as Photoshop, 
Elements, and Paint Shop Pro to bring color-the right color-
back to the cheeks of fading ancestors. 
Levels (histograms) is the most versatile of several 
methods to isolate and tame discolorations that have 
taken over the photograph.

Burn and Dodge duplicate 
the techniques of the old 
chemical darkroom so the 
retoucher can darken and 
lighten specific portions of the 
photo. 
Healing brush repairs 
numerous dust spots, 
scratches, and assorted and 
unexplained flaws by dupli-
cating the pixels surrounding 
the damage so they cover the 
defects seamlessly. 
Selection tool isolates 
the mother and baby so 
they can be worked on 
without affecting the back-
ground. The selection can 
also be reversed to work 
on the background with-
out worrying that touch-
ups will spill over onto the 
mother and child. 

CHAPTER 9 
Variations are used as a final 
touch so the retoucher is able 
to see and choose from a selec-
tion of thumbnail versions of 
the same photograph in which 
hues and brightness are slightly 
varied. This enables the 
retoucher to see, at a glance, 
which variation produces the 
most pleasing result.

Layers provide a way of working on a 
duplicate of the photograph within the 
same file and then controlling how 
changes are blended into the original 
picture. Two duplicate layers of the 
washed-out image that emerged from 
color changes were multiplied to increase 
the contrast and color depth of the photo.

Gradient tool fills a sky that has 
lost all hint of color, permitting the

Airbrush brings out clouds that 
have been submerged by the blue 
gradient. The airbrush also adds a 
hint of eyeballs that have been lost 
entirely in the shadows of the 
mother's eyes. 
Cloning tool covers bigger and 
more complex flaws by copying, 
through a sort of artistic wormhole, 
good portions of the photo to 
replace flawed areas with the same

HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
How the Digital Darkroom 
Pokes Fun at You 
Raising a young boy to be a man is no easy chore-unless you have morphing software. Morphing converts one image into another in a 
number of discrete steps, each of which is a blend of the characteristics of both. Although there are many mathematical methods of morph-
ing, the basic procedure is a combination of two techniques: cross dissolving and warping. 
~ 
Cross dissolving is the same technique used in 
slideshows and PowerPoint presentations: One 
image fades out while another fades in . A com-
puter producing the effect begins by holding both 
images in memory simultaneously as it displays 
the first image. 
The morphing software randomly chooses some of 
the pixels in the first image and replaces them with 
the pixels from the same positions in the second 
photo. It repeats the process until it replaces all the 
original pixels. This gives us a dissolve, a common-
place feature of any movie. But it's not yet a morph o 
It needs to warp as well. 
In one common warping method, the user manually places dots on one face and part-
ner dots on the other face to identify major features, such as the nose, mouth, and eyes. 
The more pairs of dots used in the warp, the more realistic the result. The program here 
uses a variety of colors for the dots, to help the user keep track of what's been done . 
• 

CHAPTER 9 
HOW SOFTWARE WORKS 
The software also makes a record of 
what is inside each of the regions the 
dots define. It uses this information when 
it performs a cross dissolve, replacing 
pixels in one photograph with pixels from 
the other. The software simultaneously 
repositions the transported pixels and the 
polygons they form to warp the emerging 
image so the pixels move steadily toward 
the positions they occupied in the picture 
from which they came. 
143 
The end result is the same as the cross dissolve: One picture replaces the other. But when all the stages are displayed in an 
animation, warping makes the subject of one photo morph gradually into the other. (By working with two copies of the same 
photo, you can warp without dissolving. The effect is to distort the original image so it grows a bigger nose, longer hair, or 
bulging eyes.)

How Word Processors Format Text 
El 
When you type characters into the word processor, they are stored as ASCII codes, shown here as 
numbers, in a section of memory set aside for that document. 
Text 
ASCII 
Hex Codes 
If new characters are inserted into the middle of existing text, 
the word processor adds the new text to the end of the preexist-
ing text in RAM and sets up a pointer to the place in the text 
where the new text should appear. When the document is writ-
ten to a disk, the separate sections of text are sorted out and 
written to the file in a continuous stream. 
A special section of the document, called the header, stores information about 
the file, such as the default font, margin settings, tab settings, and other data 
that is applied throughout the document unless a specific change is made. 
LEfT MARGIN: 1.5"

When you change a section of text by applying an attribute, or formatting-such as boldfacing, italics, 
underline, margin settings, and type size-the word processor uses one of two methods to track format 
changes. WordPerfect for Windows and HTML, the formatting language used to create Web pages, uses 
inline formatting. Inline formatting inserts its own code for that attribute where it's supposed to start. At 
the end of the affected section, the formatting software inserts another code that signals the end of the for-
matting. These codes are not usually displayed onscreen. 

CHAPTER 9 
HOW SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS DO YOUR WORK 
Microsoft Word uses a collection of tables to track all for-
matting information. One table tracks section properties, 
such as headers that appear at the top of each page, 
tab settings, and whether the page orientation is portrait 
(vertical) or landscape (horizontal). 
A second table tracks the formatting properties applied 
to paragraphs, such as the margin settings, first-line 
indentations, and line spacing. 
A third table tracks formatting properties applied to 
individual characters, such as typeface and size, 
boldfacing, italicizing, and underlining. 
As you type or scroll through a document, the 
word processor reads more text and formatting 
codes from RAM and sends its own commands 
to Windows, which passes them to the dis-
play driver, a collection of codes for control-
ling your specific display adapter card. Finally, 
the card sends to the monitor the electrical sig-
nals that turn pixels on and off as needed to 
display text, graphics, or any other part of the 
document. When the word processor sends 
text to be printed, a printer driver performs a 
similar function to translate text and formatting 
into the patterns of dots created by all printers, 
whether dot matrix, ink-jet, or laser.

Pointers in the section, 
paragraph, and char-
acter tables lead to 
the sections of text 
where one or more of 
the attributes should 
be used.

Not that new technologies haven't expanded the capabilities of drive storage. The use of the 
laser in multimedia disks has vastly increased the amount of data that can be stored on the same sur-
face area. But on a cost per megabyte, magnetic storage is still the best bargain, and optical tech-
nology is still too slow to be a workhorse everyday drive. We'll look at all these technologies in this 
part and the book's section on multimedia. And we'll even look at tape storage, which after all these 
years and all these changes, is still being used. 
KEY CONCEPTS 
access time 
The time, measured in milliseconds, 
from when the access command is given to when 
the read/write head is positioned to read or write a 
specific sector. The access time for hard drives is a 
combination of seek time, controller overhead, and 
rotational latency. 
actuator 
The mechanism that moves read/write 
heads to the correct cylinder. A rotary voice coil 
and head gimbal assembly control movement. The 
actuator houses the heads at the tips of its arms. 
Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) 
The command protocol used with the parallel ATA 
and serial ATA interconnects. 
Advanced Technology Attachment Packet 
Interface (ATAPI) 
An extension to ATA for con-
trolling optical (CD and DVD) drives. 
average latency 
Derived from the spindle 
speed, this is the average amount of time it takes for 
the drive to rotate to the correct address, so that the 
head can begin reading or writing in its desired 
location. 
bad block/sector 
The area on a drive platter 
that is damaged and not reliable. The locations of 
such sectors are recorded in a special area of the 
drive so the drive does not attempt to write data to 
them. 
1987 
1991 
buffer 
Part of a drive that temporarily stores 
data in memory chips. The buffer compensates for 
differences between the time for transferring data 
and the time it takes to process the data. 
CRC (cyclic redundancy check) 
Part of a sec-
tor that detects missing data within a sector. It is 
used to test that the data retrieved from a disk is 
without error. When data is written to disk, a spe-
cial check number (CRC) is calculated, based on 
the data itself, and stored with it. As data comes off 
the disk, the CRC is recalculated and compared 
with the stored CRe. The two match if no errors are 
present. 
command protocol 
A set of commands that 
tell drives what actions to take, such as reading 
and writing data. 
cluster 
One or more successive sectors that con-
tain a continuous group of data. Also, the smallest 
unit in which data is stored on a drive. 
compression 
A process to remove redundant 
data so that a file is smaller. 
cookie 
The Mylar disk to which data is written 
in a floppy drive. 
cylinder 
The vertical position of all a drive's 
read/write heads over their corresponding platter 
on a specific track, forming a vertical cylinder.

A table the operat-
ing system maintains on a magnetic disk that pro-
vides a map of the clusters that contain each file. 
flying height 
The height at which the head 
moves over a drive's platters. The lower the height, 
the greater the density of bits recorded to a specific

when a read/write head accidentally touches the 
surface of a platter, damaging the drive and mak-
ing data stored there unreadable and possibly mak-
ing the entire drive unusable. 
head landing zone 
An area on the media to 
which the read/write head returns when it is not 
active. No data is recorded in the zone so that if 
the head crashes into the platter there, no data is 
lost.

Long-Term 
Memory Works 

CHAPTER 10 
HOW A COMPUTER'S LONG-TERM MEMORY WORKS 
MAGNETIC disks are the most common form of permanent data storage. Their capacities can 
range from a few hundred kilobytes to scores of gigabytes, but they all have some elements in common. 
For one, the way that a drive's mechanism creates the ones and zeros that make up the binary language 
of computers might differ, but the goal is the same: to alter microscopically small areas of the disk sur-
face so that some of the areas represent zeros and others represent ones. The new disk uses only those 
two numbers whether it records a great novel or this week's grocery list. 
Another common element among magnetic drives is a scheme that determines how the data on the 
disk is organized. The computer's operating system, beginning with DOS and continuing with Windows 
and every other OS, determines the scheme. Many people forget just how long PC hard drives felt 
DOS's influence, even after Windows 95 took the world by storm. In Windows 95, Windows 98 and 
Windows Me, the older DOS is still there, it was just hidden beneath Windows's graphic interface. The 
operating system controls so many of a PC's operations that many PC users forget that DOS stands for 
disk operating system and that, originally, its primary function was to control disk drives. 
Before any information can be stored on a magnetic disk, the disk must first be formatted. 
Formatting creates a road map that allows the drive to store and find data in an orderly manner. The 
road map consists of magnetic markers embedded in the magnetic film on the surface of the disk. The 
codes divide the surfaces of the disk into sectors (pie slices) and tracks (concentric circles). These divi-
sions organize the disk so that data can be recorded in a logical manner and accessed quickly by the 
read/write heads that move back and forth over the disk as it spins. The number of sectors and tracks 
that fit on a disk determines the disk's capacity to hold information. 
After a disk is formatted, writing or reading even the simplest file is a complicated process. This 
process involves your software, operating system, the PC's BIOS (basic input/output system), soft-
ware drivers that tell the operating system how to use add-on hardware such as an external USB flash 
memory drive, and the mechanism of the disk drive itself.

All atoms are made up of positively charged parti-
cles called protons at the center, or nucleus, of the 
atom, and the cloud of negatively charged elec-
trons that surround the nucleus. (The nucleus also 
contains neutrons, particles that have 
mass but no electrical charge.) 
Each type of charged particle 
repels similarly charged parti-
cles and attracts particles 
with the opposite charge.

field that surrounds the wire. 
Electromagnetism is a form of energy --.-... -_tJ""" 
that spreads in the form of waves. Light, radio signals, microwaves, 
television signals, and heat are examples of electromagnetism. 
In some atoms, such as copper and aluminum, the attraction is weak between the protons and the electrons in the 
atoms' outermost layer. In such conductive materials, electrons jump freely from one atom to another under the 
right circumstances. This movement of electrons is electricity. In other materials, such as rubber and glass, elec-
trons are more closely bound to their nuclei and do not easily move from one atom to another. These nonconduc-
tive materials are insulators. Still other materials, such as silicon, can act as either conductors or nonconductors 
under different conditions. These are semiconductors, an important component of microchips and transistors. 
currents 
Nonconducting 
wires muffle 
nOises 
All electrical devices invariably create stray, unwanted electromagnetic fields called noise. 
Static on the radio and snow on a television screen are tangible examples of electrical noise. 
Much of the electromechanical design of computer components, such as adding nonfunctioning 
wires to cables, is aimed at reducing the interference of noise. The noisier the environment, the 
stronger a signal must be to make itself heard over the noise. And the stronger a signal, the 
more noise it creates that affect other components. 
Conversely, when a wire moves through a 
magnetic field, the interaction creates an 
electrical current in the wire. AC electrical 
current is produced by generators that are 
essentially giant coils of wire spin-
ning through a field created by 
massive magnets. 
Similarly, electromagnetic fields are influ-
enced by the presence, proximity, shape, 
composition, and mass of objects moving 
through the field. Those changes to the fre-
quency or amplitude of an EM field can be 
detected and are the basis for metal detectors, radio receivers, 
and the capability of a computer drive's read/write heads to detect how 
particles on the disk are arranged magnetically to represent data.

Angstrom units (units of 10-10 meter) . 
The frequency of an EM field is inversely related to its wavelength, the distance 
between identical points in adjacent waves. The higher the frequency of the signal, 
the shorter the wavelength . A signal at 1 OOMHz-in the middle of the FM radio 
broadcast band-has a wavelength of about 10 feet. A signal at 30 gigahertz 
(GHz)-in the range of radar and microwaves-has a wavelength of a little less 
than half an inch. 
FREQUENCY 
II:] Electromagnetic fields are used as signals to 
carry data by creating variations in the 
waveform. 
Frequency modulation (FM) carries data 
by varying the frequency of a fundamental 
waveform . 
Amplitude modulation (AM) varies the 
strength, or amplitude, of a basic waveform . 
The amount of data that a signal can carry 
increases with the frequency of the electromag-
netic field creating them. Because there are 
more variations in one second of higher fre-
quency waves, there are more opportunities to 
modulate the wave so that it carries data.

How a Drive Writes and 
Reads Bits on a Disk 
Before a PC writes any data to a mag-
netic drive, iron particles are scattered in 
a random pattern within a magnetic film 
that coats the surface of the disk. The film 
is similar to the surface of audio and 
video tapes. To organize the particles into 
data, electricity pulses through a coil of 
wire wrapped around an iron core in the 
drive mechanism's read/write head, 
which is suspended over the disk's sur-
face. The electricity turns the core into an 
electromagnet that can magnetize the par-
ticles in the coating, much as a child uses 
a magnet to play with iron filings. 
The coil induces a magnetic field in the 
core as it passes over the disk. The field, 
in turn, magnetizes the iron particles in 
the disk coating so their positive poles 
(red) point toward the negative pole of the 
read/write head, and their negative poles 
(blue) point to the head's positive pole.

El After the head creates one band of aligned, magne-
tized particles on the revolving disk, a second band is 
created next to it. Together, the two bands represent 
the smallest discrete unit of data that a computer can 
handle-a bit. If the bit is to represent a binary 1, 
after creating the first band, the current in the coil 
reverses so that the magnetic poles of the core are 
swapped and the particles in the second band are 
magnetized in the opposite direction. If the bit is a 
binary 0, the particles in both bands are aligned in 
the same direction. 
When a second bit is stored, the polarity of its first 
band is always the opposite of the band preceding it to 
indicate that it's beginning a new bit. Even the slowest 
drive takes only a fraction of a second to create each 
band. The stored bits in the illustration represent the 
binary numeral 1011, which is 11 in decimal numbers. 
To read the data, no current is sent to the read/write 
head as it passes over the disk. Instead, the magnetic 
opposite of the writing process happens. The banks of 
polarized particles in the disk's coating are themselves 
tiny magnets that create a magnetic field through which 
the read/write head passes. The movement of the head 
through the magnetic field generates an electrical current 
that travels in one direction or the other through the wires 
leading from the head. The direction the current flows 
depends on the polarities of the bands. By sensing the 
changes in direction of the current, the computer can tell 
whether the read/write head is passing over a 1 or a O.

DATA STORAGE 
How a Drive Maps a Disk's Surface 
The first task a magnetic drive must accomplish is to format any disk that is used with it so that there is a 
way to organize and find files saved to the disk. It does this by writing a pattern of ones and zeros onto 
the surface of the disk-like magnetic signposts. The pattern divides the disk radially into sectors and into 
concentric circles called tracks. As the read/write head moves back and forth over the spinning disks, it 
reads these magnetic signposts to determine where it is in relation to the data on the disk's surface. 
Two or more sectors on a single track make up a cluster or block. The number of bytes in a cluster varies accord-
ing to the disk's size and the version of the operating system used to format the disk. A cluster is the minimum unit 
the operating system uses to store information. Even if a file has a size of only 1 byte, a cluster as large as 32 kilo-
bytes (KB) might be used to contain the file on large drives. The number of sectors and tracks and, therefore, the 
number of clusters that a drive can create on a disk's surface, determine the capacity of the disk. 
The drive creates a special file located in the disk's sector O. (In the computer world, numbering often begins with 0 
instead of 1.) This file is called the file allocation table, or FAT, in DOS, and the VFAT (virtual FAT) in Windows 
95/98. VFAT is faster because it allows the computer to read files 32 bits at a time, compared to the 16-bit reads of the 
older FAT. VFAT also allows the use of filenames up to 255 characters long, compared to the 11 used by DOS. The FATs 
are where the operating systems store the information about the disk's directory, or folder structure, and which clusters are 
used to store which files. They also permit clusters of 4KB regardless of disk size. With Windows 98 came FAT32, which 
allows hard drives larger than 2 gigabytes to be formatted as a single disk. An identical copy of the FAT is kept in 
another location in case the data in the first version becomes corrupted. Ordinarily, you will never see the contents of the 
FAT, VFAT, or FAT32. In the NT file system (NTFS), which is used in Windows 2000 and XP, the FAT disappears entirely. 
Information about a file's clusters is instead stored in each one of those clusters.

How a PC Saves a File 10 Disk 
When you click your mouse to save a file, the 
program you're using sends a command to 
Windows, asking the operating system to carry 
out the steps needed to save the file from RAM, 
where it's being held temporarily, to disk for 
permanent storage. For this example, we'll 
assume you 're using a word processor to save 
a file named Letter to Mom.doc.

What Happens When You Delete a File? 
When you delete a file, the data that makes up the file 
is not actually changed on the disk. Instead, the oper-
ating system changes the information in the VFAT to 
indicate that the clusters that had been used by that 
file are now available for reuse by other files . Because 
the data remains on disk until the clusters are reused, 
you often can restore-or unde/efe--a file that you've 
accidentally erased.

How a PC Retrieves 
a File from a Disk 
El The FSD gets the disk location of the first 
cluster of the letter for Mom from VFAT or, in 
Windows XP, from the MFT (master file 
table), which is the VFAT on steroids, con-
taining more details about a file than its 
location. In fact, if a file is smaller than 2KB, 
the file is stored entirely in the MFT itself. 
Copies of the MFT are stored at various 
places on the disk as a precaution against 
damage to any single copy. 
When you use the File menu command 
to open a file-for example, Letter to 
Mom.doc-the first thing your word 
processor does is call on its API and, in 
Windows', DLLs (see Chapter 8 ,"How 
Windows Works"). These tools build a

of files from the current default folder, 
display them in the box, and wait on

handle all this, Windows calls on the 
Installable File System (IFS) Manager. It's the 
job of the IFS to pass control, whether it be from DOS, a 16-
bit application, or a 32-bit application, to the appropriate file sys-
tem driver (FSD) from a choice of four or more that work with 
different storage systems-NTFS, VFAT, CDFS for optical drives, and 
Network.

The volume tracking driver (VTD) might get into the action if

How Disk Drives 
Save Information 

CHAPTER 11 
HOW DISK DRIVES SAVE INFORMATION 
167 
IN more ways than one, a computer's disk drives are where the action is. The platters on which data is stored 
spin at speeds of up to 15,000 revolutions a minute-167 spins each second. Each time the hard drive is 
accessed to read or save a file, it causes the read/write heads to burst into a flurry of movement that must be 
performed with microscopic precision. So exacting are the tolerances in a hard drive-the gaps between the 
heads and the platters aren't big enough to admit a human hair-it's a wonder the drive can perform its work at 
all without constant disasters. Instead, it keeps on plugging away as the repository of perhaps years of work-
with surprisingly few failures. 
The capacity, size, and performance of hard drives have changed dramatically since the introduction in the 
early 1980s of the first IBM XT with a hard drive. Back then, a capacity of 10 megabytes was considered gener-
ous. The hard drive was 3 to 4 inches thick and filled a 5.25-inch drive bay. An access time of 87 milliseconds 
was warp speed compared to the access times of floppy drives. A decade later, hard drives that hold more than 
1000 gigabytes, smaller than a 3.5-inch floppy drive, and with seek times of 8.5 milliseconds are comparably 
inexpensive and commonplace. The best part is that it's a certainty the size and prices of drives will continue to 
decrease while their capacities increase. Who says you can't have a win-win situation? 
Amid super fast, super big hard drives, writable CD and DVD drives, and all the other new high-tech mar-
vels, it's hard to get excited about the common floppy drive. After all, it's slow, and a floppy disk doesn't store 
much information compared to ... well, compared to any other type of disk. When the size of software is mea-
sured in tens of gigabytes, it's almost unheard of, these days, to see a program distributed on floppy instead of 
a CD or DVD. In fact, the floppy drive's lifetime is all but over. A little more than twenty years after the 3.5-inch 
floppy drive was born, today PCs are sold without any type of floppy. Rewritable CD and DVD drives and USB-
based flash memory drives, combined with networking that lets you exchange files with others without resorting 
to any type of drives, have made the floppy obsolete. Oh, you still find them on many new PCs-but not for 
long. 
For all its deficiencies, the floppy drive was an underappreciated wonder of its time. Think of it: An entire 
book full of information can be contained on a cheap disk that you can slip into your pocket. Until the advent of 
small, cheap USB-based flash drives, floppy drives were still found on nearly every PC, making them a sure and 
convenient way to get small amounts of data from one PC to another. No communication lines, networks, gate-
ways, or infrared links were needed; just pull the floppy out of one machine and slip it into another. Today, USB-
based flash drives have largely replaced floppy drives for these purposes, but they can't replace the venerable 
floppy's legacy. 



Because a hard drive stores data on a microscopic scale, the read/write 
heads must be extremely close to the surface of the platters to ensure that 
data is recorded accurately. Typically, there is a gap of only 
2/1,000,000 of an inch between the heads and the disk surface.

How a Mirrored Drive Array 
Protects Files 
When a file is to be read from a mirrored array, the 
controller reads alternate file clusters simultaneously 
from each of the drives and pieces them together for 
delivery to the Pc. This process makes reads faster. 
How fast depends on the number of drives in the array. 
If two drives are mirrored, read time is cut approxi-
mately in half; three mirrored drives reduce read time to 
about one-third that of a single drive. 
Drive arrays work on the simple theory that if one 
hard drive is a good thing, two hard drives are four 
times as good. A drive array or RAID-for redun-
dant array of independent, or inexpensive, 
drives-can speed up the performance of a com-
puter's biggest bottleneck, disk drives, or it can pro-
vide second-by-second protection against a disk crash. 
Or both; It depends on how an array is configured. 
On computer systems where data integrity is more 
important than speed and there are only two hard dri-
ves, the best solution is a mirrored drive array, or 
RAID 1. The RAID controller-a replacement for 
the ordinary disk controller with software to handle 
arrays-writes every file to two or more drives simulta-
neously. By using multiple hard drives configured so 
the operating system thinks they are only a single 
drive, you get greater protection from data loss. 

CHAPTER 11 
HOW DISK DRIVES SAVE INFORMATION 
If the read failure is caused by a media 
defect and the rest of the drive is 
unscathed, the controller automatically 
reads the data from the intact copy of 
the file on the other drive and writes it 
to a new, undamaged area on the 
drive on which the defect occurred. 
But the real purpose of a RAID 1 is not speed. It's redun-
dancy. In case of a read failure-caused by either a 
defect on the surface of one of the disks or platters or a 
potentially more serious crash of one of the drives-the 
controller simply reads the intact version of the file from 
the undamaged drive. 
173

How a Striped Drive Array 
Boosls Performance 
When a file is read from a striped drive array, the con-
troller simultaneously pulls each part of the file from the 
different drives on which it is stored, a faster way of 
retrieving the information . The controller pieces together 
the parts of the file in the right order when it writes the 
file to RAM. 
For faster reads and writes, a RAID is set up as a 
striped array of two or more hard disks. When a 
file is saved, the RAID controller divides the file into 
several pieces and writes different sections to differ-
ent drives at the same time. 

EJ 
CHAPTER 11 
If a striped array, also called a RAID 0, 
has more than two drives, it can be con-
figured as a striped array with par-
ity, or RAID 4. With this array, the 
controller writes striped data to all but 
one of the drives and uses the remaining 
drive for error checking. The con-
troller's array software performs a 
Boolean XOR operation on the data 
written to the drives and writes the result, 
often called a parity bit, to the remain-
ing drive. An XOR operation results in a 0 
bit whenever two like bits are compared 
and a 1 bit whenever two dissimilar bits 
are compared. For example, XORing 
each bit in the two binary numbers 1 100 
and 1010 yields the parity 01 10. If more 
than three drives are in an array, the first 
two drives are XORed and then that result 
is XORed with the next drive, and so on, 
until all the drives containing data have 
been XORed and the final result is written 
to the parity drive. 
Later, if one of the files is damaged or if 
one of the drives crashes, the controller 
performs a reverse XOR operation. By 
comparing the undamaged bits with the 
parity bits, the controller can deduce 
whether the missing bits are Os or 1 s. The 
information can also be used to repair 
data caused by minor media defects, 
allowing the controller to detect and 
repair flaws on the fly.

HOW LITTLE THINGS MAKE DRIVES FASTER AND BIGGER 
THE common image of technological breakthroughs-the wild-haired scientist rising from his test tubes 
and proclaiming, "Eureka!"-is exciting when it does occur, but that rarely actually happens. Most tech-
nological advances are made less by momentous discoveries than by everyday plodding toward incre-
mental gains. 
The fundamental technology in personal computers has not changed in the quarter of a century PCs 
have been changing our lives. Despite the hyping of Matrix-like direct links to computers, we're still 
using keyboards and mice. Fifteen years ago I wrote about how computer data would be stored in holo-
graphic cubes of crystal bombarded by laser beams. Yet I was still excited this year when I bought a 
new hard drive even though it uses electromagnets to write information to metal platters, the same as 
hard drives have done for decades. But a couple of decades ago, the biggest hard drive you could get 
for a PC stored 10MB of data in a drive heavier than one of today's laptops. My new drive holds 
25,OOO-twenty-five thousand-times as much data, and it's less than half as small. Why isn't that 
something to shout "Eureka!" about? 
Because all that progress has been made in baby steps. All science progress is 99% incremental-a 
tweak in design here, a bump in power there, a goose to speed over here, all occasionally given a 
huge, mind-bending boost by a theory of evolution, the unraveling of DNA, or the invention of the laser. 
The big developments might pull in the headlines like a black hole, but it's the constant small, day-to-day 
improvements that have the most immediate impact on what we do. In this chapter we'll look at some 
less-than-monumental ways in which computer storage-always the laggard in computing speed-has 
constantly improved by tids and bits.

for a Zip drive looks similar to an ordinary floppy disk. It's about the same size, 
although slightly thicker. And yet a normal 3.5-inch floppy disk can hold a maxi-
mum of only 1.4MB of data. The Zip disk holds up to 750MB and accesse~ .. thg!.. 
data at speeds that rival low-end hard drives. How does Zip do it?

The read/write heads are 
about one-tenth the size of 
a floppy drive's heads-
closer to the size of 
read/write heads in a 
hard drive. 
The smaller heads allow the Zip drive to write data using 2,1 18 tracks per 
inch, compared to the 135 tracks per inch on a floppy disk. 
Further storage capacity comes from coat-
ing the cookie with the same magnetic par-
ticles that are used in S-VHS video tape. 
The particles have a higher energy 
level, which means they are not as easily 
magnetized. As a result, magnetic fields 
from the write head affect a far smaller 
area than a floppy drive does. The smaller 
the surface area needed to write a 0 or 1 
bit, the mare bits can be packed onto the 
same track.

A conventional floppy is divided into sectors radially. There are 
as many sectars in the outmost track as there are in the inner-
most. As a result, the outer tracks use up mare surface area than 
the inner tracks-o waste of the recording surface. A Zip drive, 
along with hard drives, uses zone recording, so that the some 
recording density is used throughout the disk. This results in more 
sectors per track as the heads move toward the outer edge of the

By reversing the direction of the current, the drive 
magnetizes particles in the metallic coating on a disk 
so the particles' north and south poles are oriented 
to create combinations representing a 0 ar a 1 bit. 
In longitudinal recording, the magnetized particles 
are aligned with the outer edge of the disk. 
Attempts to increase storage by making the magne-
tized areas smaller ran afoul of the superpara-
magnetic effect. The particles' proximity to each 
other causes their charges to interfere with one 
another to the point that their north and south poles 
spontaneously reverse, corrupting data. 
In perpendicular recording, the iron core has 
been redesigned to ride close to the disk's surface 
and to force a stronger electromagnetic field 
through a narrow area, leaving particles that 
are magnetized perpendicular to the path 
of the magnet. In 2007 Hitachi, devel-
oper of the drive along with 
Toshiba, brought to market 
a 3.5-inch drive using 
perpendicular recording 
that stores up to one ter-
abyte of data. That's

How File Compression 
Makes Files Smaller 
El 
Files, even those on a compressed disk, can be made still smaller by file compression-a process often called 
zipping a file. This type of compression reduces file size by eliminating the redundancies in the file. This is 
called loss less compression, which means decompression can precisely restore every bit in the file.

Compressed file 
The compression program uses some variation of a scheme generally called LZ (after its creators, Lempel and Ziv) adaptive dictio-
nary-based algorithm. As the program reads an uncompressed file, it examines the file for recurring patterns of data . When LZ 
identifies a pattern, instead of writing the pattern in line with the text, as it does other sections of the file, it writes the pattern to a dic-
tionary. The dictionary is stored as part of the compressed file.

Where the pattern would have been written to disk, LZ instead writes a much shorter pointer that tells where the omitted pattern can be 
found in the dictionary. Adaptive means that, as the algorithm writes more of the file, it constantly looks for more efficient data pat-
terns to use and changes the entries in the dictionary on the fly. In the example here, LZ could have chosen "se" in "sells," "seashells," 
and "seashore" as one of the patterns for the dictionary, but it's more efficient to use "ells" and "seash ."

Other Compression 
The formats for some types of files, particularly graphics and database files, include their own compres-
sion. Graphics files often use lossy compression, which reduces file size by forever discarding data, 
such as small variations of color, whose loss won't be noticed. Lossy compressed files cannot be decom-
pressed to their original state. Utility programs, such as PKZip, can further compress files already 
squeezed by disk compression or built-in file compressions. The utilities use different algorithms that 
emphasize storage efficiency at the expense of speed.

How Disk Defragmentation Works 
When the first file is saved to a disk drive, it is laid 
down on a track in clusters that are contiguous. 
In other words, the read/write head can move 
directly from one cluster in a file to the next, all 
in one continuous, smooth operation. The head 
stays in one place over a single track and 
writes the file as the disk moves beneath it. 
As more files are added, they too are writ-
ten to contiguous clusters. If we could see 
the files, identified here with different colars, 
they would look like this in a greatly sim-
plified representation of a disk.

are erased, they 
leave empty clusters 
that are available for 
writing new files. 
However, some of the empty clus-
ters are not big enough to hold the new files. 
As a result, part of the file is wriHen to one cluster, a 
the rest of the file is divided-or fragmented-among whatever empty clusters 
exist anywhere else on the disk.

CHAPTER 13 
HOW pes USE LIGHT TO REMEMBER DATA 
THE days of magnetic recording are numbered. That number might be very large, but eventually the stan-
dard for computer storage will be writing with light in some form of optical drive. We're already doing 
this with recordable and rewritable CDs and DVDs, which use a finely focused laser beam to both write and 
read data. They sound like the same things, but there's a difference. Data recorded on a CD-recordable 
(CD-R) drive cannot be erased or changed. A CD-rewritable (CD-RW) drive lets you reuse the same disc, 
much as you use a floppy. 
Compared to a floppy disk, either type of disc is gargantuan. Each plastic-encased CD holds up to 
700MB of information. The capacity comes from being able to focus a laser beam so tightly that it packs 
data using a surface area that is smaller than a pinpoint. The relatively clumsy magnetic read/write heads 
in a conventional drive don't have the precision needed to jam-pack the data. That has made the compact 
disc the medium of choice for distributing today's software, which takes up hundreds of megabytes. You find 
CD-ROMs filled with clip art, photographs, encyclopedias, the complete works of Shakespeare, and entire 
bookshelves of reference material. 
As capacious as compact discs are, they're pikers compared to DVD, or digital versatile discs-a 
silly name adopted because the industry wanted to get across the idea that DVDs weren't limited to digital 
video discs, as they were originally called when the only use for them was distributing digitized movies. 
By either name, DVDs use a two-level storage system that holds at least 8.6 gigabytes of information. And 
that's using only one side of the disc. 
Writable CD and DVD drives are quickly becoming standard equipment on new PCs. The low cost of 
writable CDs and DVDs makes them a cheap way to back up and transport information as well as a store-
house of MP3 tunes burned to play on your car's music CD player. 
As revolutionary as both the CD and DVD have been, they pale in comparison to the potential of two 
new high-capacity optical disc formats: Blu-Ray and HD-DVD. Both of these formats, which look no different 
than any other CD or DVD, hold an enormous amount of data. A single layer HD-DVD disc can hold 15GB 
of data. A single layer Blu-Ray disc holds between 23GB and 27GB of data. And no matter which flavor 
becomes your preference, both can hold multiple layers of data. No wonder their primary application, to 
date, has been for holding feature films in high-definition video. 
Waiting in the wings are storage methods, such as holograms, that expand the capacity of PC storage 
into the scale of the terabyte-a thousand billion bytes, a thousand gigabytes, or 20,000 four-drawer fil-
ing cabinets filled with text.

tiny depressions in the reflec-

The laser beam penetrates

A motor constontly varies the rate ot which 0 CD-ROM disc spins so 
thot, regardless of where a component, called a detector, is 
located in relation to the radius of the disc, the portion of the disc 
immediately above the deteelor is always moving at the same speed. 
Optical 
The Same Old Spin 
Magnetic disks, such as those used in hard drives, have data 
arranged in concentric circles called tracks, which are divided radi-
ally into sectors. Using a scheme called constant angular veloc-
ity, the magnetic disk always spins at the same rate; that is, the tracks 
near the periphery of the disk are moving faster than the tracks near 
the center. Because the outside seelors are moving past the read/write 
heads faster, the seelors must be physically larger to hold the same 
amount of data as the inner seelors. This format wastes a great deal of 
storage space but maximizes the speed with which data can be 
retrieved. 
A Different Spin 
Typically, CD-ROM discs use a different scheme than magnetic disks 
do to stake out the areas of the disc where data is recorded. Instead of 
several tracks arranged in concentric circles, on the CD-ROM disc, 
data is contained in a single track that spirals from the center of the 
disc to its circumference. The track is still divided by seelors, but each 
seelor is the same physical size. Using a method called constant lin-
ear velocity, the disc drive constantly varies the rate at which the 
disc is spinning so that as the deteelor moves toward the center of the 
disc, the disc speeds up. The effeel is that a compael disc can contain 
more seelors than a magnetic disk and, therefore, more data.

How a Recordable CD-ROM 
(CD-R) Works 
A laser sends a low-energy light beam at a compact disc built on 
a relatively thick layer of clear polycarbonate plastic. On top of 
the plastic is a layer of dyed color material that is usually green, 
a thin layer of gold to reflect the laser beam, a protective layer of 
lacquer, and often a layer of scratch-resistant polymer material. 
There might be a paper or silk-screened label on top of all that. 
The laser's write head follows a tight spiral groove cut into 
the plastic layer. The groove, called an atip (absolute 
timing in pregroove), has a continuous wave pattern 
similar to that on a phonograph record. The frequency of 
the waves varies continuously from the beginning of the 
groove to its end. The laser beam reflects off the wave pat-
tern and, by reading the frequency of the waves, the CD 
drive can calculate where the head is located in relation to 
the surface of the disc. 
Polymer 
Dye 
EJ As the head follows the atip, it uses the position 
information that the groove's waves provide to con-
trol the speed of the motor turning the disc so that 
the area of the disc under the head is always mov-
ing at the same speed. To do this, the disc must spin 
faster as the head moves toward the center of the

The dye layer is designed to absorb light at that specific fre-
quency. Absorbing the energy from the laser beam creates a 
mark in one of three ways, depending on the design of the 
disc. The dye might be bleached; the polycarbonate layer 
might be distorted; or the dye layer might form a bubble. 
Regardless of how the mark is created, the result is a distor-
tion, called a stripe, along the spiral track. When the beam 
is switched off, no mark appears. The lengths of the stripes 
vary, as do the unmarked spaces among them. The CD drive 
uses the varying lengths to write the information in a special 
code that compresses the data and checks for errors. The 
change in the dye is permanent, making the recordable com-
pact disc a write-once, read-many (WORM) medium. 
The software used to make a compact disc recarding 
sends the data to be stared to the CD in a specific format, 
such as ISO 9096, which automatically carrects errors and 
creates a table of contents. The table is needed because 
there is nothing like a hard drive's file allocation table to 
keep track of a file's location. The CD drive records the 
information by sending a higher-powered pulse of the laser 
beam at a light wavelength of 780 nanometers. 
The CD-Recordable drive-like an ordinary read 
only CD drive-focuses a lower-powered laser 
beam onto the disc to read data. Where a mark 
has not been made on the surface of the disc, the 
gold layer reflects the beam straight back to the 
read head. When the beam hits a stripe, the distor-
tion in the groove scatters the beam so that the 
light is not returned to the read head. The results 
are the same as if the beam were aimed at the 
lands and pits in an ordinary CD-ROM. Each time 
the beam is reflected to the head, the head gener-
ates a pulse of electricity. From the pattern in the 
pulses of current, the drive decompresses the data, 
error-checks it, and passes it along to the PC in the 
digital form of zeros and ones.

How DVDs Play the Blues 
The technology to record movies on DVD in high definition has sprung on the public in the form of a competition. Two competing, incom-
patible designs to use the ultra-thin beam from a blue light laser are battling for supremacy in much the way Betamax and VHS video tape 
formats battled it out a couple decades ago. Sony offers a DVD reader (writers will come later) that it calls Blu-Ray. Toshiba is selling 
HD-DVD. Both have courted movie studios to convince them to sell high-definition versions of their films exclusively in their formats. Some 
studios have agreed; other are pressing movies in both formats. The quality of video and audio is similar on both formats. But there is one 
puzzling difference: The width of the blue laser is what makes it possible to pack onto a normal-size DVD all the additional data high defi-
nition demands. The lasers in both DVD drives have the same width-and yet a Blu-Ray disc holds 26GB of data and an HD-DVD disc 
holds only 15GB. Here are the differences between blue laser DVD and old optical discs and how the two battling blue light differ from 
each.

Compact Disc: A CD uses a red laser that has a wavelength 
of 790 nanometers (nm). That's a little less than a millionth of a 
meter; it would take more than 300 dots of red laser light to 
cover the width of a human hair. The distance between coils of 
the spiral track carrying data is 1.6 microns (1.6 millionths of a 
meter). The data is encoded in the form of pits (holes) and 
lands (unchanged, level areas). 
DVD: The common DVD that's been around for about 10 years 
also uses a red laser beam, but it is narrower-650nm. That 
small difference allows a single-sided, single-layer disc to hold 
seven times as much as a CD. The coils of the tracks are 0.7 
microns apart and the lands and pits are smaller. 
HD-DVD and Blu-Ray: With these high-definition formats, opti-
cal technology takes a leap to much smaller pit and land sizes. 
Both technologies use a blue-purple laser with a beam that's 
405nm wide. The coils of their tracks are 0.3-0.4 microns apart, 
about a fourth of the distance that separates common circuit 
traces in microprocessors.

Mystery capacities: The first thing you might 
notice in the graph showing the data capacities of 
CD, DVD, and blue laser optical discs is that Blu-
Ray discs hold nearly twice as much as HD-DVD. 
The second thing you might notice is that each of 
the technologies uses a laser beam with a wave-
length of 405nm . Based on what we've learned 
about the relationship between wavelength and 
the ability to pack more and more bits onto a disc, 
you'd assume the two competing blue laser drives 
would have the same data capacities. A couple of 
factors come between us and an easy explanation . 
Optical bits: One reason is the way bits are recorded and 
interpreted. Optical discs actually use the transition between 
lands and pits and pits and lands to represent a 1 bit and the 
lack of such a transition to be a 0 bit. But these are optical bits, 
not the bits that are used to record music and videos on DVDs.

Data bits: Before optical bits become data 
bits, the optical drives must demodulate 
them, a process that takes several of the 
optical bits and converts them into single 0 
and 1 data bits. HD-DVD uses a process 
called twelve to eight demodulation. 
It converts each group of 12 optical bits 
into 8 data bits.

Protection versus capacity: The big 
difference comes in the protective plastic 
layer on the two types of DVDs. The Blu-
Ray layer is only 0 .1 mm thick, which 
allows the disc's higher recording density. 
HD-DVD uses a thicker layer (0.6mm) that 
provides more protection but which forces 
the drive to use wider lands and pits.

In a similar technology battle-
between Sony's Betamax video tape 
recorders and VHS sponsored by a 
consortium of electronics makers-
technology was not the deciding factor 
that eventually led to VHS's triumph 
over Betamax, which was considered 
better technically and in the quality of 
recordings. The reasons VHS won out 
are that it was cheaper to make tapes 
for it, and the biggest source of video 
was porno, an industry that doesn't 
waste money on frills such as resolu-
tion, audio, and clothes. Of Blu-Ray 
and HD-DVD, the latter discs are 
cheaper to produce, leading industry 
observers to predict HD-DVD is the 
likely winner after porn purveyors 
make it the blue laser disc of choice.

REAR Admiral Grace Hopper was an early computer engineer who helped create the lan-
guage COBOL and invented the term "bug" when she literally found a dead insect that had 
caused Harvard's Mark II computer to malfunction. Dr. Hopper often taught computing classes, 
where she would ask, "What is a microsecond?" To answer her own question, Dr. Hopper 
pulled several wires out of her handbag. Each wire was about 11 inches long, which she had 
calculated was the distance an electron travels in one millionth of a second. 
We don't usually think of distance being an issue in the everyday appliances and electron-
ics we use, including our computers. I know I tend to think of electricity as instantaneous. After 
all, moving at 186,000 miles a second, what's a few inches here or there? But on the scale 
where electrons move and become bits of information, it's not just seconds that count, or even 
microseconds. In microchips and circuits, things happen in a matter of nanoseconds-bil-
lionths of a second. Chips can contain as much as a quarter of a mile of wire traces through 
which millions of pulses of electricity are being pushed every second. The territory electricity 
has to cover is crucial enough that Cray supercomputers were built in a circle to minimize the 
distance electrical signals traveled. 
As if requirements that signals move at light speed weren 't demanding enough, the signals 
must share the traces of aluminum and copper on circuit boards and in chips. Timing is every-
thing. One computer component's output is another component's input. A file being read from 
disk is output as far as the drive is concerned, but for the memory chips receiving the file, the 
same data is input. If hard drives are slower than memory chips-and they are-that means 
that memory is left cooling its heels, accomplishing nothing, while the hard drive grinds out 
data bits. Much of the design of a PC is aimed at pipelining input and output to eliminate awk-
ward delays in a lightning-fast ballet of bits. 
Among the foremost timing masters are caches. A cache is any storage-RAM, a micro-
processor's own memory, or hard drive-that's used as a buffer to contain frequently used data 
that would otherwise come from a much slower source. Speed is relative. Memory chips cache

that, jf they weren't on the drive, would have to be drawn from the still slower Internet. 
A delay for one signal can create bottlenecks for thousands of other signals. If two sig-
nals collide, trying to use the same circuits at the same time, the result can be fatal. But 
faster and faster computers require more nimble switches and transistors, able to 
squeeze through just a few more bits of electricity each billionth of a second. 
Electricity does not flow freely. Even con-
ductive materials, such as copper, have elec-
trical resistance built into them. Resistance is 
like a clogged water pipe. If the pipe's filled 
with gravel, less water gets through. Impurities 
in conductors slow the flow of electrons. Small 
pipes conduct less water than big pipes. The 
resistance of a conductor increases as the 
diameter of a wire or the width of an electri-
cal trace decreases. Water pipes, though, 
don't have to contend with all the distractions 
that plague electricity. Imagine if water in a 
pipe had to switch direction thousands of 
times a second, or that an invisible force 
emanated from each pipe and interfered with 
the flow in other pipes. The latter is a phenomenon of electromagnetism-the fields 
of radio waves that are produced by moving electrons. 
An early keyboard. 
Electromagnetic fields were first discovered in the 19th century, when physicists 
noticed that arcing-leaping sparks of electricity-were replicated from one device to 
another with no wires connecting them. This led scientists to believe that it was possible 
to communicate over long distances without wires. The first radio transmitters used elec-
tric arcs, ushering in the first wave of what would later become multimedia. Radio in the 
early 20th century was as exciting and important as the Internet at the end of the cen-
tury. In other machines, from TV to microwave ovens and radar, we've used electromag-
netism to our advantage. The downside is that every device in your computer-for that

Xerox's Polo Alto Research Center (PARC) investigates the "architecture of information" and how to make computers easy 
enough for anyone to use. Using the ideas that people would respond better to intuitive command structures and they 
don't need to understand how the hardware functions to use the technology, PARC comes up with block-an-white screens, 
a bitmopped display, icons, pointers, loser printers, word processors, and networks (notably Ethernet). The Xerox Star 
and the Alto are two computers that embody all these groundbreaking ideas but they are never successfully marketed.

matter, everything from the phone to the air-conditioning-is spewing out electromagnetic 
fields of different strengths and frequencies. Those fields, in turn, can affect the flow of 
electrons in other wires. Often, electromagnetic waves pass through each other invisibly, 
as different light waves do. But if the frequency or wavelengths of the fields are too similar, 
they can interfere and distort each other. Then it's called electrical noise, and many of the 
improvements in computer hardware are related directly to creating new, better sets of 
electrical ear muffs. In many cables, there are twice as many wires as are needed to carry 
data. The extra wires are included to absorb noise that might interfere with the working 
wires. 
Noise is important because the nanoworld of electricity is 
still finite; a voltage doesn't just instantly appear on a wire. It 
takes time, like turning open a pipe valve. The longer it takes 
for the valve to open, the fewer times it can be turned on and 
off in a second, which means fewer chances for drops of data 
to flow. On the input end, how much voltage is flowing out is 
important. A trickle is ignored, but finally the voltage rises 
enough to register itself with the receiving device. The more 
noise computer components have to contend with, the more 
difficult it is for a component to tell whether some passing 
spike in current is intended to convey data or is just stray 
noise. Many of the improvements in speed and versatility for 
the first two decades of the personal computer have come incrementally-a few nanosec-
onds off the time it takes to recognize a change in voltage there, a microsecond shaved 
off a switching operation here. 
We don't see computer operations on this scale, of course. We measure time in the 
seconds it takes a menu to drop down or the minutes it takes a dial-up modem to negotiate 
an Internet connection. So, when we talk about input and output, we usually aren't think-
ing about the subatomic voyages of electrons. We are used to thinking about input and 
output on a human scale, and that means keyboards, mice, game pads, displays, digital 
cameras, scanners, printers, and a host of other devices designed to let us get information 
into a computer and get it out again. 
Human-Computer and Real World Interaction 
All the marvelous tasks that a personal computer is capable of doing would be meaningless 
without some way for the PC to communicate with the world outside itself. The first personal 
computers, such as the Altair, used a method of communicating so primitive that it's a won-
der computing pioneers had the imagination to conceive that these contraptions could be 
practical in the real world. Program instructions and data were fed into the computer by flip-
ping electrical switches-not miniaturized switches in the form of transistors, but ordinary 
thumb-sized switches. The results of a computation were presented in the form of a pattern 
of tiny light bulbs lit on a panel. To the uninitiated, the pattern of lights was incomprehensible. 

Altair hobbyists, of course, were quick to come up with a keyboard and a monitor 
to make communications easier with the new microcomputer. For years, though, the 
keyboard was computing's main input device, and the monitor or printer were the 
prime ways to get data out of a computer. But even as keyboards and monitors gave us 
a way to communicate with a computer, they also tied us down to the computer. Only 
with the emergence of ultra-portable notebooks less than three pounds has the PC 
become small enough and light enough to be carried around easily. Wireless network-
ing and a fully charged battery mean that, today, you can compute anywhere within 
range of your network, totally unencumbered by wires connected to anything. 
Most of the advances in input/output, especially in the last decade of the 20th cen-
tury, have been devoted to making both input and output more natural. The first target 
has been the keyboard, which makes sense because it's the only part of the PC with 
which any computer user actually comes into contact with. The first attempted 
change was a different layout for the keys devised by John Dvorak (not the com-
puter columnist) in 1936. It put the least-used keys along the outside of the key-
OVERVI EW 
199 
board where the weaker pinky finger and ring finger could reach them. The more -. 
often used keys were put under the index and middle fingers to reduce the time it 
takes to move to them. It's certainly a better concept than the current QWERTY key 
arrangement, which no one can explain, but which all keyboard users, even hunt-and-
peckers, are invested in. But the Dvorak keyboard also reveals a fundamental truth 
about computer technology: The better idea doesn't necessarily win. Of more impor-
tance than scientific, mechanical, or electrical excellence is compatibility with past tech-
nology. Repeatedly, a better idea has been defeated in the marketplace because it 
requires too much effort, money, and time to change to different hardware, learn new 
software, or simply break old habits. 
There have been scores of other innovations for keyboards. The best known is the 
design that splits the keyboard down the middle so the keys lie at more natural angles 
to how the arms and wrists bend. But there's also been a design that took that 
approach even further-tilting the two halves of the keyboard up so they become two 
vertical surfaces controlled by hands with the palms turned toward each other. Relax in 
a chair with armrests, and you'll see that your hands indeed do come to rest naturally 
with the palms facing each other. But the totally split keyboard went a step too far; The 
arrangement is too alien. Some keyboards have been stranger still, designed with the 
keys in two circular depressions, or as the device from an alternate universe: a one-
handed device using chording-pressing different combinations of keys at the same 
time to represent different letters. 
Some of the most accepted input/output innovations have been born at Xerox's Palo 
Alto Research Center (PARCL which since the 1970s has been studying how people 
communicate information so as to make computers easy enough for anyone to use, 
including people who have no idea of how the underlying technology works. PARC cre-

processors, and networks, most notably Ethernet. All these innovations are commonplace today, but 
a Xerox personal computer is not. It's proof once again that better technology doesn't guarantee a 
win. Xerox did produce two computers, the Xerox Star and the Alto, that brought all these ground-
breaking inventions to realization. Maybe it was too soon, but in any case, they didn't sell. 
The input innovation that's received the most acceptance is the mouse combined with a graphic 
interface. Mouse innovations, if anything, have been stranger than keyboards. I've used pointing 
devices that looked like ballpoint pens, were worn as a ring, and controlled with your feet. They 
didn't sell either-which is amazing when you consider there's nothing particularly intuitive about 
using a mouse. It requires a lot of tricky eye-hand coordination-more than you need when touch 
typing. 
Language is not really intuitive either, but it's an increasingly important part of computer 
input/output. By the end of the 20th century it really was possible to speak to a computer and have it 
respond correctly, even speak back to you. It's possible, but not quite there. In the next chapter, we'll 
look at how speech recognition is likely to pan out. Meanwhile, we'll be looking at more down-to-
earth forms of input and output, including new devices that eliminate human beings as input devices 
entirely. 
KEY CONCEPTS 
accelerated graphics port 
An expansion 
slot that gives a video card fast access to bitmap 
stores in a PC's main RAM. This slot has quickly 
lost ground to the PCI-Express slot. 
adapter (expansion card) 
A circuit board, 
often with its own microprocessor and memory, 
that is inserted into an expansion slot to add to a 
PC's capabilities. For example, video, sound and 
SCSI cards. 
analog/digital 
An analog signal is a continu-
ous, varying electrical output, such as those cre-
ated by microphones and sound amplifiers. A 
digital signal consists of discreet, separate values 
for input or output data. 
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 
A chip 
that converts an analog signal to digital values that 
a PC can manipulate. 
ASCII 
Acronym for American Standard Code 
for Information Interchange. ASCII consists of the 
256 numbers assigned to the alphabet, numbers, 
punctuation, and other characters. 
bandwidth 
Generally, the same as data trans-
fer rate but also specifically the number of bits that 
can be sent through a network connection, mea-
sured in a second (bps); and the range of transmis-
sion frequencies a device can use, measured in 
Hertz (Hz) or cycle per second. 
bitmap 
A graphic file that contains a record of 
the color value of each pixel in the graphic. 
bus 
The circuitry and chips that manage the 
transfer of data from one device to another. A PC's 
motherboard has a bus, such PCI or PCI-Express, 
but there are also buses between memory and the 
processor and external components, such as a SCSI 
or universal serial bus. 
cable 
A collection of wires separated by insula-
tion that carry electrical signals between compo-
nents. They can be inside or outside a Pc. 
capacitance 
A measure of the charge between 
two electrical plates that are separated by a non-
conductive dialectic material. Because capacitance 
changes depending on the proximity, shape, and 
size of the plates, dialectic and even nearby object 
capacitance often is used to measure input. 

circuit, circuit board 
Metallic traces printed 
on a fiberglass panel that carry electrical signals 
among larger components. 
contact 
The metal pins and tabs where electri-
cal circuits from two components make physical 
contact so electricity can flow from one to the 
other. 
charge-coupled devices (CCDs) 
Miniature 
devices that convert the energy from light into elec-
trical current. CCDs are used in digital cameras 
and scanners. 
CRT (cathode ray tube) 
The "picture tube" of 
a traditional TV set or a computer monitor. Rays of 
electrons from a cathode in the back of the tube 
are guided along lines of phosphors on the inside 
front of the tube that glow when the electrons ener-
gize them. 
data transfer rate 
The amount of data that 
moves from one device to another in a specific 
amount of time. 
digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 
A chip 
that converts a series of digital values into a 
smoothly varying analog electrical current. 
dot pitch 
The distance between the nearest two 
pixels of the same color. Smaller is better. 
expansion slot 
A strip of connectors on a PC 
motherboard into which an adapter card is 
plugged. 
input/output 
Input is data flowing into a 
device; output is data flowing out. Note that one 
device's output is another's input. You can't have 
one without another. 
ISA 
Acronym for Industry Standard Architecture, 
referring to a 16-bit bus/expansion slot design that 
has been the most common type of adapter slot. 
LCD (active matrix) 
A flat display screen 
using liquid crystals. It uses individual electrodes 
leading to each pixel, resulting in a bright image. 
OVERVI EW 
PCI 
Acronym for Peripheral Component 
Interconnect, a 32-bit successor to the ISA bus. 
pixel 
Derived from "picture element"-the small-
est unit of a computer display. A physical pixel 
equals the physical size of the dot pitch and con-
sists of only one dot each of red, blue, and green. 
Several physical pixels can go into making up one 
logical pixel, the smallest grouping of color dots 
that a video card works with as if they were a sin-
gle point of light. 
polarization 
Light is ordinarily non-polarized. 
That means on a straight line leading away from a 
light source, light waves will be vibrating at all 
angles to the line. Polarization happens when light 
passes through a filter that permits the light waves 
to pass only if their plane of vibration is within a 
limited range. 
port 
Generally, a specific place where one 
device, usually represented by a cable or wire, is 
physically connected to some other device through 
a socket or slot. In a broader sense, any point at 
which this data is transferred. 
serial/parallel 
A serial port or connection is 
one in which only one bit of information can be 
sent at a time because only one wire or path is 
used for data. A parallel connection allows several 
bits-usually at least eight-to be transmitted simul-
taneously along separate wires. 
throughput 
The amount of work a computer or 
component can do in a specific amount of time. 
VGA, super VGA 
VGA is a specific standard 
of monitor resolution-640 pixels horizontally and 
480 pixels vertically-and a limited range of col-
ors. A super VGA monitor is capable of displaying 
resolutions of 800x600, 1028x782 pixels and 
higher. The number of colors in a super VGA dis-
play range from 256 to several million.

CHAPTER How Data Gets 
Into Your PC 

CHAPTER 14 
HOW DATA GETS INTO YOUR PC 
YOU come into direct contact with your PC's keyboard more than you do any other component. You 
might go for years without ever thinking about-much less touching-your PC's processor or hard drive, 
but most people pay much more attention to those components than they do to the one part of the com-
puter that determines not how well the computer works, but how well they themselves work. 
A poorly designed keyboard acts as a constant stumbling block to productivity and can even cause 
health problems. A well-designed keyboard is one that you never think about; your thoughts seem to flow 
directly from your mind to the computer's screen without you being aware of what your fingers are doing. 
Despite the importance of the keyboard, most manufacturers---and too many users-pay little attention 
to it. In 1996, Microsoft made the biggest change in the keyboard since the function keys moved from the 
left side to the top: Microsoft's split-board design made a concession to ergonomics by splitting the layout 
in half and angling the halves so they're in line with how our arms rest naturally on a desktop. The design 
has been widely copied, but it's unlikely to completely replace the older arrangement that most people are 
used to. 
Regardless of changes in layout, the basic way a keyboard works has not changed significantly since 
the first IBM PC was introduced in the early 1980s. 
Unfortunately, there is nothing natural or intuitive about a keyboard. No child is born knowing how to 
type, and even when the skill is learned, there's little sense to it-no one can give a sensible explanation 
of why the alphanumeric keys are arranged the way they are. 
For many, the keyboard is actually a barrier to learning how to use a computer. Even for the experi-
enced typist, there's nothing instinctive in pressing F5 to print a file. Engineers-not one of them touch typ-
ists, I'll bet-at Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) developed a concept first explored 
by Douglas C. Engelbert of the Stanford Research Center. The concept was a pointing device, some-
thing a computer user could move by hand, causing a corresponding movement onscreen. Because of its 
size and tail-like cable, the device was named for the mouse. Apple Computer made the mouse a stan-
dard feature of its Macintosh computers, and Windows has made a mouse standard equipment on PCs, 
as well. 
The mouse is not the only pointing device that's been invented. Digitizing tablets are popular with 
artists and engineers who must translate precise movements of a pen into lines on the screen. The most 
successful pointing innovations have been "eraserhead" pointing devices, so called because they look like 
a pencil's eraser stuck between the G and H key; the touch pad, which is a digitizing table without the 
precision; and trackballs. All three are popular on laptops, used where there's no space for a conven-
tional mouse. 
The mouse and its cousins can never replace the keyboard, but they can supplement the keys by doing 
tasks such as moving and pointing to onscreen objects, tasks for which the cursor keys are ill-suited. We're 
only just reaching the point where we control our PCs simply by speaking to them.

OUTPUT DEVICES 
The Keyboard and Scan Codes 
Depending on which key's circuit carries a signal to the microprocessor, the processor generates a number, 
called a scan code. There are two scan codes for each key, one for when the key is depressed and the 
other for when it's released. The processor stores the number in the keyboard's own memory buffer, and it 
loads the number in a port connection where it can be read by the computer's BIOS (basic input/output 
system) . The processor then sends an interrupt signal over the keyboard cable to tell the processor that a 
scan code is waiting for it. An interrupt tells the processor to drop whatever else it is doing and to divert its 
aHention to the service requested by the interrupt. 
A microprocessor built into the keyboard constantly scans circuits leading to the keys. It detects the 
increase and decrease in current from the key that has been pressed. By detecting both an increase 
and a decrease in current, the processor can tell when a key has been pressed and when it has been 
released . Each key has a unique set of codes, even if, to the users, the keys seem identical. The proces-
sor can, for example, distinguish between the left and right shift keys. To distinguish between a real sig-
nal and an aberrant current fluctuation , the scan is repeated hundreds of times each second. The 
processor only acts upon signals detected for two or more scans. 
Pressing a key causes a 
change in the amount of 
current flowing though a 
circuit associated specifi-
cally with that key.

Two types of keys are used on keyboards. 
Capacitive keys are built around a 
spring that makes a clicking noise when 
the key is depressed. Pressing it causes a 
metal plunger to pass between two metal 
pads on the underlying circuit boards that 
act as a capacitor. The plunger causes a 
change in the electrical potential between 
the two pads, which signals that the key is 
pressed down. Hard-contact keys are 
mounted above a rubber dome. Pressing 
the key collapses the dome and presses

toggle keys. Depending on the status indicated 
by those bytes, the BIOS translates the appropri-
ate scan code into an ASCII code, used by the 
PC, that stands for a character, or into a special 
code for a function key or a cursor move-
ment key. Uppercase and lowercase charac-
ters have different ASCII codes. Applications 
can choose to interpret any keystroke to dis-
playa character, or as a command. Ctrl+B, 
for example, is universally used by Windows 
applications to toggle the boldface attribute. 
In either case, the BIOS places the ASCII or 
special key code into its own memory buffer, 
where it is retrieved by the operating system 
or application software as soon as any cur-
rent operation is finished.

How Mice Obey Your Every Gesture 
Mechanical Mouse 
Signals are sent to the PC over the mouse's 
tail-like cable. Windows converts the num-
ber, combination, and frequency of signals 
from the two encoders into the distance, 
direction, and speed necessary to move the 
onscreen cursor. 
On the rims of each encoder are tiny 
metal contact points. Two pairs of 
contact bars extend from the housing 
of the mouse and touch the contact 
points on each of the encoders as 
they pass by. Each time a contact bar 
touches a point, an electrical signal 
results. The number of signals indi-
cates how many points the contact 
bars have touched-the more signals, 
the farther you have moved the 
mouse. The more frequent the 
the faster you're moving the m 
The direction in which the rollers 
turning, combined with the ratio 
between the number of signals from 
the vertical and horizontal rollers, 
indicates the direction in which the 
mouse is moving. 
Tapping either of the buttons atop the mouse also sends a signal to the PC, 
which passes the signal to the software. Based on how many times you click, 
and the position of the onscreen pointer at the time of the click, the software 
performs the task you want to accomplish. 
Each roller is attached to a wheel, known as an encoder, 
much as a car's drive train is attached by its axles to the 
wheels. As the rollers turn, they rotate the encoders. 
A wheel protruding between 
the left and right buttons is 
attached to another encoder. 
As you move the wheel for-
ward or backward, the 
encoder sends signals that the 
software interprets to scroll the 
screen up or down. 
As the ball rotates, it touches and turns two rollers mounted at a 90° angle to 
each other. One roller responds to back-and-forth movements of the mouse, 
which correspond to vertical movements onscreen. The other roller senses 
sideway movements, which correspond to side-to-side movements onscreen. 
As you move a mechanical mouse by drag-
ging it across a flat surface, a ball-made of 
rubber or rubber over steel-protruding from 
the underside of the mouse turns in the direc-
tion of the movement. 
A Mouse on Its Back 
Want to know how a trackball works? Turn a mechanical 
mouse upside down and you'll get some idea. A trackball 
is simply a mouse mounted so the ball is rotated with your

Optical mice are usually more expensive 
than a mechanical mouse, and subse-
quently come with more bells and whis-
tles. Its scroll wheel enables you to tilt 
it to the right or left so it presses against 
microswitches that send signals to the 
software telling it to scroll sideways. 
Several other buttons on the top and side 
of the mouse allow you to move forward 
or backward with an Internet browser, 
control the volume of music, or jump from 
one application to another. 
Whatever the transmission method, the 
information makes its way to the PC, which 
uses the data to reposition the mouse on the 
screen. This entire process results in the 
mouse sending reports on its current 
speed and direction 125 times a second. 
The signals from the camera are 
fed to a microprocessor called a 
digital signal processor 
(DSP) for interpretation. The 
DSP chews through as many as 
4.7 mega pixels a second.

are sent via a radio frequency (RF)

As you move an optical mouse, an

moving across on low-friction

a laser. The basic operation is the

How a Touchpad Works 
Beneath the top rubber 
layer of a touchpad are 
two more layers, each of 
which contains a row of 
electrodes, one row going 
horizontally and the other 
vertically. 
The crossing electrodes do not touch, 
but a positive electrical charge builds 
up in one set and a negative charge 
in the other. This creates an electric 
field between the layers. Integrated 
circuits for the horizontal and vertical 
electrodes sample the strength of that 
field's electrical potential, or mutual 
capacitance. The size and shape of 
the electrodes and the non conductive, 
dialectic material separating them 
influence the amount of capacitance. 
Center of field 
Capacitance is also affected by the sur-
rounding electromagnetic field from 
other objects, including a finger, which 
has very different dialectic properties 
from air. Even if the finger doesn't actu-
ally touch the pad, the fingertip's field 
penetrates the grid of electrodes, chang-
ing the capacitances where electrodes 
cross over and under one another near-
est the fingertip.

The capacitances are most affected at the center of the finger. By reading the capacitances of adjoin-
ing intersections, the touchpad can identify the finger's center, and it feeds that location to Windows to 
position the on screen arrow. The capacitances are measured about 100 times a second. Changes in 
those measurements caused by moving the finger are translated into cursor movement.

How Speech 
Recognition Works 
A person who's going to use speech recognition software 
must first go through an enrollment. This consists of the 
person dictating text that is already known to the software 
for 10 minutes to an hour. From this sampling, the software 
creates a table of vocal references, which are the ways in 
which the speaker's pronunciation of phonemes varies from 
models of speech based on a sampling of hundreds to thou-
sands of people. Phonemes are the smallest sound units 
that combine into words, such as "duh," "aw," and "guh" 
in "dog." There are 48 phonemes in English . 
Once every 1 0-20 milliseconds, the analog 
signal generated by the microphone is sam-

CHAPTER 15 
HOW SCANNERS CAPTURE WORDS AND IMAGES 
THE problem with computers from the very start was that before they could do all their marvelous 
tricks with math and information, you had to input some data with which they could work. Whole ware-
houses full of people were hired to sit at a keyboard for eight hours a day to input-the new word for 
typing-information that, for the most part, they were reading off forms onto which other people had 
already input information about themselves. 
What's wrong with this picture? How could it be that we were capable of creating machines that 
could do in minutes (seconds!) what would take a university full of mathematicians 1,000 years to com-
plete-and that's without spring breaks. It was swiftly becoming clear that the computers got all the fun 
assignments, like calculating the trajectory of artillery shells, while we humans were turning into 
drudges typing census information on punch cards that would then be fed to the computer so it could 
do the really important work. 
The obvious solution to such indignities was to make the computers do their own input. See how 
they like typing-inpuHing-thousands of characters a day as if they were ... machines! Of course, the 
computers always had the perfect comeback: "Sorry. No eyes." Can't argue with that-unless you had 
a tiny device that could measure light and, say, convert those measurements into electrical currents that 
could be fed into a computer somehow so it could" see" as well as humans. That tiny device, the photo-
diode, had actually been around since the 1970s. It just took a couple of decades for the miracle of 
seeing machines to really get geared up. 
Part of the delay was due to the lack of software to take advantage of this new vision. Optical char-
acter recognition is no easy trick. It takes humans a few years to get the hang of it. But scanners are 
now capable of translating printed text in virtually any shape, form, or layout into editable text. The 
search engine company Google is currently on a project to convert-to the extent that they are allowed 
to-every public domain book and paper in major libraries into editable, computer-searchable text. 
Scholarship will never be the same. Neither will war, now that computer eyes search for our enemies 
and guide our rockets. 
As scanning software got better and the PCs more powerful and able to see sharper images, scan-
ners began appearing in businesses and in homes, where a scanner could become an ad-hoc Xerox as 
well as save priceless family photos that were slowly decomposing. 
Now, as an integral part of digital photography and digital darkrooms, the computer's eyes have 
let it become our artistic vision-and our forger, as software allows the most clumsy draftsman to do 
photo touch-ups that are nearly undetectable. Who would have thought computers would become so 
good at being our eyes?

Computer scanners that can see, store, and manipulate 
words and images are the end product of a technologi-
cal evolution that began with a single cell-a photo-

or photo site. The cell is one of thousands, often mil-
lions, etched into the surface of a chip of silicon.

The cell is made by joining two pieces of silicon crys-
tal. One piece has been doped so that every millionth 
atom of silicon is replaced with one atom of boron. 
Pure silicone is electrically inert. The infusion of boron, 
though, creates p-type silicon, which has a positive 
charge. The other part is doped, also a million to 1, 
with phosphorous. The phosphorous results in n-type 
silicon, which has a negative charge. The charged 
areas are called the p-Iayer and the n-Iayer.

electrons, creating a negative

n-Iayer create a magnetic field 
in which electrons from the 
p-Iayer are drawn by the positive 
force into the diode's deple-
tion area, a narrow strip sep-
arating the negative and

light that hits a pixel, the more 
electrons travel to the depletion 
layer, creating an electrical 
charge whose strength is pro-
portional to the strength of the

The paper isn't always stationary when it's being 
scanned . Higher-end scanners feed sheets of paper 
past a scan head that stays still. A roller transport 
feeds a document between two rubber rollers, much 
like a fax machine. A belt transport uses two opposing 
belts to do the same thing. Drum transports pass the

How Optical Character 
Recognition Works 
El 
When a scanner reads the image of a document, the 
scanner converts the dark elements-text and graphics-
on the page to a bitmap, which is a matrix of square 
pixels that are either on (black) or off (white). Because the 
pixels are larger than the details of most text, this process 
degenerates the sharp edges of characters, much as a fax 
machine blurs the sharpness of characters. This degrada-
tion creates most of the problems for optical character 
recognition (OCR) systems. 
The OCR software reads the bitmap that the scanner created 
and averages out the zones of on and off pixels on the 
page, in effect mapping the whitespace on the page. This 
enables the software to block off paragraphs, columns, 
headlines, and random graphics. The whitespace between 
lines of text within a block defines each line's baseline, an 
essential detail for recognizing the characters in the text. 
In its first pass at converting images to text, the software 
tries to match each character through a pixel-by-pixel com-
parison to character templates that the program holds in 
memory. Templates include complete fonts-numbers, punc-
tuation, and extended characters-of such common faces 
as 1 2-point Courier and the IBM Selectric typewriter set. 
Because this technique demands a very close match, the 
character attributes, such as bold and italic, must be identi-
cal to qualify as a match. Poor-quality scans can easily trip 
up matrix matching.

219 
The characters that remain unrecognized go through a more 
intensive and time-consuming process called feature 
extraction. The software calculates the text's x-height-the 
height of a font's lowercase x-and analyzes each charac-
ter's combination of straight lines, curves, and bowls (hollow 
areas within loops, as in 0 or b) . The OCR programs know, 
for example, that a character with a curved descender below 
the baseline and a bowl above it is most likely a lowercase g. 
As the software builds a working alphabet of each new char-
acter it encounters, recognition speed accelerates. 
Because these two processes don't decipher every character, 
OCR programs take two approaches to the remaining hiero-
glyphics. Some OCR programs tag unrecognized characters 
with a distinctive character-such as - , #, or @-and quit. 
You must use the search capability of a word processor to find 
where the distinctive character has been inserted and correct 
the word manually. Some OCR programs also display a mag-
nified bitmap onscreen and ask you to press the key of the 
character needed to substitute for the placeholder character. 
Still other OCR programs invoke a specialized spelling 
checker to search for obvious errors and locate possible 
alternatives for words that contain tagged unrecognized 
characters. For example, to OCR programs, the number 1 
and the letter I look very similar, so do 5 and S, or cI and d. 
A word such as downturn might be rendered as downturn. 
A spelling checker recognizes some typical OCR errors and 
corrects them . 
Most OCR programs give you the option of saving the con-
verted document to an ASCII file or in a file format that popu-
lar word processors or spreadsheets can recogn ize.

CHAPTER 
How (ompulers 
Use Power 

CHAPTER 16 HOW COMPUTERS USE POWER 
THI NGS are not as they seem. We're pretty smug in our universe, where events unfold evenly and 
seamlessly. Cars don't simply stop; they come to a stop. It takes time. A pendulum swings smoothly and pre-
dictably. Any time something moves from A to C, it passes an infinity of points B along the line. The light at 
the end of the tunnel gradually grows brighter. We are so comfortable with a perception of the world that is 
smooth and continuous, we've learned not to notice the finite increments of space and time in which things 
really do happen. We know that moving pictures are not moving; they appear to move because we're 
shown a rational series of still pictures so rapidly we literally can't tell where one ends and the other kicks 
off. When you twist the volume knob on the radio, the volume seems to increase smoothly; but volume con-
trols are variable resisters. A piece of wire is wrapped in a coil, and a contact moves up and down the 
turns of wire to increase or decrease the amount of current. But the least it can adjust the current is by the 
difference between one wire and the next. 
Our perceptions are analog-a continuous wavy line of events that move at predictable rates. What's 
really happening is actually digital-represented by discrete, separate, and different numerical values. 
The light doesn't fade; it's either on or off. You don't move; you're either there or not there. Light can be a 
wave and it can be a particle. It just depends how you measure it. At the subatomic level, where no one's 
really figured it all out yet, it might turn out we-every thing-are just the vibrations of something we 
couldn't possibly understand. 
Machines-particularly computers-thrive on digital existences. The metaphor for a computer is a 
switch. Off means one thing, on means the opposite. 1 and 2, true and false. Black and white. But we've 
got this analog monkey on our back, so we've had to figure ways to translate the analog values we work 
with and the digital values of the computer. 
The translation you'll encounter most often in this book is an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 
and the opposite, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The idea's simple enough. If you have some 
current moving through a wire, you just sample it regularly-dozens of times a second at least---and give 
the amount of current at exactly those moments. And because often we just need to know whether it's yes or 
no, on or off, we don't really have to be all that exact. If voltage is higher than a certain level, it's on. If it's 
lower, it's off. 
What works so nicely with DACs and ADCs is another part you'll encounter in several computing com-
ponents, the charge-coupled device (CCD). It consists of an array of sensors made from a material that 
turns light energy into electrical energy. Light hitting the material must do something with the energy it's car-
rying, so it's transferred to the electrons in the substance. The electrons start acting like teenagers while 
their parents are out of town and jump all around, moving from atom to atom: electricity. The stronger the 
light, the stronger the electrical current, which is sent to an ADC, which turns those different intensities into 
numbers with which a computer can work. 
Inputting data into a computer has, until lately, been slow and deliberate and limited. But we're on the 
eve of developing computers that are aware of their surroundings with sensors for stimulation we can't 
detect ourselves. It means that, eventually, input and output will have lost today's meaning. Humans and 
computers will simply communicate and let us keep our illusions. 
221

OUTPUT DEVICES 
How the Power 
Supply Works 
The power supply's power cord plugs into a normal elec-
trical outlet that in the United States provides alternat-
ing current (AC) power at 1 10 volts and 60Hz. The 
1 10 volt AC power coming into the power supply needs 
to be transformed into direct current (DC) power at 
much lower voltages that can be used by the sensitive 
electronic components inside a Pc. 
The incoming power is dirty power; that is, there are small fluctuations in 
its current and power. PC components could theoretically be damaged by 
these variations, and so some power supplies (generally the more expensive 
ones) filter and condition the power before converting it to lower-voltage DC 
power. The power flows through an electromagnetic interference 
(EMI) filter to smooth out fluctuations and line-conditioning circuitry to main-
tain a consistent power level. 
Looking Out for Power No. 1 
Power supplies also make sure the PC only starts if the supply can provide it 
with the proper amount and voltage of electricity. When the power supply 
starts, it runs a series of internal tests to make sure it is working properly and 
supplying the right voltage and amount of power. If everything is working 
properly, it sends a Power Good signal to the PC's motherboard that alerts the 
motherboard to start up. It is constantly sending that signal. If the power supply 
stops working properly at any time, it stops sending the signal, and the PC 
shuts down. 
The power is sent to a series of cables that ultimately provide power to 
the PC's components. Each cable has several wires in it, and each of 
those wires carries different voltages. Twelve-volt power is for devices 
such as disk-drive motors, while 3.3-volt and 5-volt power is used by 
PC I! AGP cards, ISA cards, CPUs, DIMMs, and other components. The 
cable joins with the PC via cable connectors. Each connector is keyed 
so that it only attaches in a certain way, which ensures that the proper 
voltage is supplied in the proper place. 
J 

16 
HOW COMPUTERS USE POWER 
223 
The cleaned power goes to a set of transistors that convert 
the 60Hz current to a much higher frequency-one with 
more cycles per second. This allows small, lightweight trans-
formers to do the work of stepping down the power from 
1 10 volts. If the current stayed at 60Hz, much bulkier trans-
formers would be needed, which would be impractical 
because they would not fit into a computer. Additionally, AC 
current at a higher frequency than 60Hz is easier to filter 
and keep at a constant voltage, which is required by sensi-
tive electronic components inside a Pc. 
The higher frequency power is sent to trans-
formers that step down the voltage from 1 1 0 
volts to 3.3 volts, 5 volts, and 12 volts, which 
are the three voltages used by different parts of 
a pc. 
The lower voltage power now goes to diodes 
that rectify the power-they change it from 
AC power to the DC power required by PC 
components. 
Two types of capacitors make sure there is 
always a steady source of power available to a 
PC's components by storing power and then pro-
viding it when necessary. An input capacitor, 
usually the largest capacitor in a power supply, 
has a reserve of power in it that the power supply 
draws on when there is a drop of power from the 
wall outlet, such as when a blow dryer is turned 
on . Smaller output capacitors provide a reser-
voir of electricity when a computer suddenly 
needs it, such as when a DVD drive and CD 
drive simultaneously turn on. Because the capaci-
tors store voltage even when the power supply 
isn't connected to a wall outlet, they can be 
exceedingly dangerous (even lethal) . You should 
never open a power supply. 
Diodes, transistors, transformers, and capacitors 
get very hot and could easily burn out if they 
were not cooled . One or more heat sinks, in 
conjunction with a fan built into the power supply, 
draw heat away from them and cool them off. 
electricity goes through filters that make 
sure the power is of a constant, non-fluctuat-
ing current so electronic components are not 
damaged by it. 

224 
How a UPS Keeps Your 
Computer Going 
Alternating electrical current (AC) is 
drawn from a wall outlet to the uninter-
ruptible power supply (UPS). What 
happens then depends on whether the 
UPS is an offline or online device. 
An offline, or passive, UPS splits the cur-
rent into two branches. One branch feeds 
power normally to a computer or other 
peripheral. The other branch passes 
through a rectifier, or battery charger, 
which changes the current from AC to 
direct current (DC) to replenish the 
charge that commonly leaks slowly from 
a baHery inside the UPS. 
A microprocessor in the offline UPS constantly monitors the main cur-
rent line far a drop in voltage. If the power fails, within 4-20 millisec-
onds the microprocessor closes a switch that sends direct current power 
from the baHery through an inverter, which turns the battery's DC into 
the alternating current the computer expects to receive. (High-quality 
hardware can survive microbreaks in current up to 100 microseconds.) 
TO PC 

CHAPTER 16 
An online, or serial, UPS feeds all current from the wall 
outlet through an ACto-DC converter. From there, the 
current replenishes a battery and then travels to an 
inverter before it travels on to the computer as alternat-
ing current. Whether there is a power failure or not, the 
UPS's battery always supplies current to the computer. 
If power fails, a 
microswitch in the UPS 
breaks the connection 
between the wall outlet 
and the battery. Current 
continues to flow from the 
battery to the PC as if 
nothing had happened. 
Either type of UPS 
sounds an alarm to tell 
you of the power fail-
ure. Usually you have 
at least five minutes to 
save and close files 
and to shut down 
the Pc. 
TO PC 
HOW COMPUTERS USE POWER 
225 
Some UPS units use a serial or USB con-
nection to the PC to launch software that 
automatically saves files and shuts down 
the system if no human is handy. In one of 
the few known cases of electrical irony, 
when alternating current from the inverter 
is received by the PC's power supply, the 
supply converts it to direct current again.

How Surge 
Protectors Work 
Under ideal circumstances, electrical current would stay within close limits of volt-
age, frequency, and other characteristics. But turning on an air-conditioner, 
nearby electrical lines, close lightning strikes, and other electrical events can intro-
duce power sags, power surges, or general electrical noise into power 
and telephone lines. These disturbances can cause a computer, modem, or phone 
to malfunction. They can crash a PC or destroy its power supply or other parts. 
Ideal current 
Power surge 
Electrical noise 
Most UPS devices also provide some form of line conditioning, which tries to compensate 
for the irregularities in current. The act of converting current from AC to DC and back again 
helps eliminate some irregularities. Or a surge protector, an electrical extension cord that 
includes components to tackle electrical distortions, provides basic line conditioning. 

MOYs 
CHAPTER 16 
HOW COMPUTERS USE POWER 
227 
The first line of defense against a power surge-a sudden spike in the voltage-is the 
shunt mode. It uses a metal-oxide varistor (MOV) between the power line and 
its neutral or ground line. The MOV consists of metal-oxide material, such as zinc oxide, 
which transmits electricity separated by semiconductors that don't carry current unless 
the voltage reaches a certain level. 
Fuse 
A power surge overcomes the MOV's resistance, opening a pathway that 
diverts the surge to the neutral or ground wire. Each time this happens, 
the MOV loses some of its effectiveness, eventually becoming useless. For 
this reason, some surge protectors contain multiple MOVs. 
If the surge is too large to be diverted safely, some surge protectors use a 
thermal fuse to block the rush of current. The fuse is a resistor designed to 
become hot and melt if too much current passes through it. The fuse is sacri-
ficed and works only once. Note that you should not depend on any surge 
protector or UPS to guard against a near-direct lightning strike; unplug com-
ponents during a lightning storm. 
Less harmful but still perturbing line noise-often 
caused by high-frequency radio waves-is unde-
tected by a MOV or fuse. But some of it might 
be clamped by a toroidal choke coil 
made of wire wrapped around a 
doughnut-shaped magnetic 
core. Current on the way to 
the PC passes through

CHAPTER How Serial Porls 
Triumph 

CHAPTER 17 HOW SERIAL PORTS TRIUMPH 
THIS book used to have one of those explanations that made so much sense, that clicked with our 
common perceptions so precisely, that they could only be called elegant. The explanation went like this: 
Computers have two basic types of connections for sending data from here to there: serial connections 
and parallel connections. Serial connections were used with peripherals that are inherently slow, such as 
modems, which are themselves serial devices. Parallel connections invariably led to components such as 
hard drives, where components moved at breath-taking speeds to handle the enormous quantities of data. 
The reason why, so the explanation went, was that serial connections could only send bits of data down a 
single wire one at a time. It was serial in the same sense of a serial killer, who murders only one victim at a 
time. Parallel connections were the mass murderers of communications, moving several bits at the same 
time, down several wires that were laid out, parallel to each other, in a cable. The explanation encouraged 
the reader to think of serial connections as soldiers marching in a single line. Parallel cables were like sol-
diers marching eight or more abreast. Which formation would get an army of data into the fray faster? 
Why, it was obvious. 
Until the soldiers marching in formation began stumbling allover themselves. 
When a device is reading bits of data, it's actually detecting a change in the voltage level of voltage on 
a wire or circuit. A high voltage-usually 3 or 5 volts in a computer-stands for a 1 bit; a low voltage (or 
no current) represents a 0 bit. Such changes aren't instantaneous. It takes a few milliseconds for the voltage 
to climb to the high point or to dissipate down to a low voltage. Then it must remain that way long enough 
for the device to be sure it's not just some momentary spike or drop. So, if you built a device that does a bet-
ter job of recognizing differences in voltage, instead of 5 volts, the circuits can use 3 volts, which takes less 
time to generate. 
The problem with parallel connections is that it expects all of its signals coming in on separate wires to 
arrive at precisely the same time. Push the speed of those signals by making them shorter or using a lower 
voltage, and parallel ports generate constant errors. The signals don't arrive at the same time, and if there's 
an error on one line, the signals on all lines would have to be resent. 
A serial connection, however, can easily ask for a resend of an erroneous signal. It works because serial 
bits are sent as groups inside a packet that contains other helpful information about the data, including 
where the packet's bits belong in the sequence of signals. And, as it turns out, sending bits one after the 
other is faster than trying to make a lot of parallel signals march in precision.

OUTPUT DEVICES 
Analo and Digital Converters 
El 
Computers extract information from the world around them using devices such as microphones and 
photosensitive diodes to detect changes in energy levels. Inside a microphone, the energy from 
sound waves vibrates metal plates, which changes the voltage in an electrical current passing 
through the plates. The photodiodes are made with a material that absorbs light's energy and con-
verts it into electrical energy. Th 
er the light hitting the diode, the stronger the electrical cur-
rent. The

Computers are designed to manipulate digital data-specific values are expressed in real numbers. A computer 
must convert all analog input it receives into digital values before the PC can use it. Conversely, most of the 
results of the computer's digital manipulation must be converted back to analog when it becomes output. 
A microchip called an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) con-
stantly samples an analog signal in the form of a wavering electri-
cal current. Each time the current is measured, the ADC generates 
a number that represents the analog value of the current at that 
moment. 
On the output end, analog currents are needed by 
most monitors, sound speakers, and modems. A 
digital-to-analog converter (DAC) changes a 
string of digital values into rapidly changing volt-
ages. The DAC manages this by routing current 
through a matrix of resistors, components that 
resist the flow of electricity. The resistors are 
weighted to present different degrees of 
resistance. By sending current along dif-
ferent patterns through the resistors, the 
resulting analog stream of current is 
varied to correspond to the digital data.

The precision of on ADC/DAC conver-
sion is affected by how often the ana-
log signal is sampled. Samples made 
frequen~y detect finer changes in the 
analog signal. The precision is also 
affected by the sensitivity of the convert-
ers. Two ports of the a nalog signal can 
differ so sligh~ that on ADC cannot 
detect a difference, sa it assigns both 
ports the same digital value. 
R ..... ution is the range of analog values on ADC or DAC can 
handle and, consequen~y, how much information a device can 
hold for anyone sample. Resolution depends on the number of 
bits the devices can devote to the digital translation of the a na-
log values. If the DAC has only one bit to represent a nyone 
sample of the analog signal, it can only show whether the ano-
log signal is on, representing white (1), or off and block (0). 
One-bit samples are sufficient for scanning printed text for con-
version into text you can edit with your PC.

However, if a DAC has 16 bits to 
represent each of the colors-red, 
blue, and green-that make up a 
pixel, those 16 bits can express any of 
256 shades of each of the colors. The 
array of red shown here demonstrates 
that the higher the number, the more

would be as intensely red as the moni-
tor can produce. Combined with 256

high color, produces a total of 
16,777,216 colors. The array of col-
ored squares here shows each of the

How Bandwidth Moves Your Data 
People and machines 
generate more complex, 
but weaker, waves that 
represent words, images, 
music, and electronic 
data. These modulator 
waves superimpose 
their wave patterns on 
the simpler carrier waves. 
The result is an entirely 
new waveform, similar 
to when two ripples on a 
pond collide, creating an 
Information-data-moves 
from one place to another 
riding on the crests and val-
leys of waves called carri-
ers. Carriers are simple, 
pure waves of sound or 
electromagnetism, which 
includes light, heat, radio 
and TV transmissions, X-
rays, and every other type 
of radiation. (See the 
spread titled " How 
Electromagnetism Reacts 
with Matter" in Chapter 1 0 .) 
entirely new set of ripples . ..... ------
El How much data a carrier moves from here to there in one second is that waveform 's bandwidth. Although we talk of one band-
width being faster than another, what we're really measuring is capacity. For example, imagine two ships traveling from San 
Francisco to Japan:

• 
Ship A carries 3,000 tons traveling at a steady 40 knots. 
• 
Ship B is half as fast, traveling at 20 knots. 
However, Ship B carries 15,000 tons, so it has the greater bandwidth. If each of the ships had to transport 100,000 tons, it would take Ship 
A 366 days to move all the material. Ship B would finish the job sooner, in 150 days, not because Ship B is faster-it's not-but because it 
has a broader bandwidth (it carries more). 
High Bondwi dth

High Bandwidth 
Increase the frequency. Each cycle 
of the carrier wave is a new opportunity 
for data to merge with the carrier. The 
higher the frequency of the waves, the 
greater its capacity to carry data . We 
measure frequencies in hertz, which is 
one oscillation a second . 
Each part of a PC-its processor, disk drives, system bus, video card-
has a bandwidth . Anyone of these channels can become a system bot-
tleneck if its bandwidth doesn't keep pace with the bandwidths of other 
components. There are several ways to boost bandwidth : 
Compress the data. Zipped files and MP3 songs allow an Internet con-
nection to send more information in the same time it would take to send a 
much smaller amount of uncompressed data. 

CHAPTER 17 HOW SERIAL PORTS TRIUMPH 
233 
Cache data. The device saves copies of frequently repeated 
data in a special pool of memory called a cache. The next time 
the same data is needed, it can be fetched quickly from the cache. 
Reduce latency. The theoretical bandwidth, or throughput, is 
rarely realized in reality. As much as 60 percent of a transmission's 
potential bandwidth is lost when many of the bits being transmitted 
don't represent data. Instead, they are used for addressing, identifi-
cation, error-checking, and other necessary chores that are collec-
tively called latency. Using improved materials and more sensitive 
signal detectors can reduce latency. 
Prefetch data. A device makes an educated guess as to what 
data it will have to handle next and prefetches that data so it's 
already waiting to be processed when its time comes. Doctors are 
prefetching patients when they keep their waiting rooms stocked 
with more patients than they can treat at one time.

.. 
We most often hear of bandwidth in connection with Internet con-
nections, particularly broadband, which is a high-capacity line, 
such as DSL and cable. But anything that moves some sort of data 
has a bandwidth . The charts shown here give you an idea of the 
relative bandwidths of different means of transmitting data. The 
band capacities here don't take into consideration latency or 
methods of overcoming latency, such as compression . 
Send less data. If you don't have the 
bandwidth to send high-resolution color 
images, save them as black-and-white at 
a lower resolution, which requires fewer 
bits to record the image. If you can't 
send 30 frames a second of video, send 
15 frames.

Think of parallel communications as being like a pla-
toon of soldiers marching eight abreast. Draw a line 
in the ground in front of the soldiers, and eight sol-
diers will cross it simultaneously, followed by the 
eight soldiers behind them. A battalion marching in 
this manner could cross the line in about 10 seconds.

How the Universal 
Serial Bus (USB) Works 
El A cable can attach to 
another hub, the only 
purpose of which is 
to provide more 
ports to which 
USB devices are 
attached-sort of a 
digital extension cord. 
Inside the PC, a universal serial bus (USB) controller-a set of special-
ized chips and connections-acts as an interface between software and hard-
ware. Applications, the operating system, and device drivers-which provide 
details about how particular hardware devices work-send commands and data 
to the USB host hub, located on the controller. 
Leading from the host hub are special USB 
~---
connectors, or ports. Matching, four-
wire cables plug into the ports. 
Or a cable can lead directly to a USB device, such as a webcam. USB 
supports connections for nearly every type of external peripheral, such as 
a keyboard, mouse, modem, external hard drive, microphone, scanner, 
and printer. Two of the four wires in the USB cable are used to supply a 
limited amount of electrical power to peripherals, sometimes eliminating 
bulky power supplies. The other two lines, called D+ and D-, are used for 
sending data and commands. A high voltage on D+ but not on D- is 
a 1 bit. A high voltage on D- but 
not on D+ is a 0 bit. 

Any USB device can also 
include a hub, so that a 
monitor, for example, pro-
vides ports into 
which multimedia 
speakers, a micro-
phone, and a key-
board can be 
plugged.

These devices can, in turn, provide ports for further 
USB hardware. For example, a mouse and a digitiz-
ing pen could attach to the keyboard, which is 
attached to a host hub. This system of branching con-
nections lets the universal serial bus handle up to 
1 27 devices.

in the following order: 
Highest priority 
Isochronous, or real-time, 
where there can be no inter-
ruption in the flow of data, 
such as video or sound. 
Now that the new device is an official member of the bus, it takes its place as the host 
controller polls the devices-to issue commands, to ask whether the device is ready to 
send or receive data, and to apportion chunks of the bus's bandwidth (data-transmitting 
capacity) to each device. About a million times a second, the controller sends queries or 
commands downstream to all the peripherals on the USB. Each of the host's messages 
begins with a token that identifies to which peripheral it's addressed. The message goes 
to all devices on the bus, but devices that don't match the token's address simply ignore 
it. Devices send data upstream to the host only after the host gives them permission.

How Serial AlA Overtakes EIDE 
El 
El 
The EIDE/ ATA connection standard for hard drives 
tops out at transfer rates of 133MB a sec-
ond. Above that, crosstalk, or electrical 
interference, from their 40-wire parallel 
cables drowns out meaningful communication. 
Its replacement is SATA, which stands for serial 
AT-attachment. Its cables have only seven wires: 
four for carrying data and three grounding wires to 
dampen any crosstalk. The arrangement is designed to 
allow the cables to have a bandwidth of up to 300MB 
per second or 3 gigabits per second. At its debut, how-
ever, the technology was limited to 150MB per second. 
DE 
Connection 
With a planned port multiplier, a single SATA cable can lead to 15 hard drives that are hot-swappable so they can 
be unplugged and inserted while the computer is running. Each drive has its own channel and recognizes commands 
from the motherboard only if the signals identify it as the recipient. The arrangement eliminates the need to designate 
drives as master and slave. Although SATA 
does support optical drives, only a hand-----= 
ful of these drives are on the market 
because they do not benefit from SATA's 
increased bandwidth . 
How SCSI Works 
El 
Computers such as servers, where there is constant demand for disk files, often 
use SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) because it moves more data 
in less time than EIDE, and it can pass data among up to 7 to 15 other devices 
(depending on the type of SCSI). SCSI is also not limited to drives; it connects 
such equipment as printers and scanners that have enough intelligence to work 
independently of the CPU. 
On a SCSI bus, all devices are equal: A printer could initiate a message to the 
CPU, or a scanner could send a photo to a printer. Any of the devices can 
communicate with any of the others. 
SCSI (ontroller (ard 
CD-ROM drive 
Terminator 

CHAP ER 17 
Drives on an SATA connection also improve their performance by 
using a technique called Native Command Queing (NCQl. 
This allows the drive to rearrange the order in which it executes 
up to 32 commands that it receives. The drive can choose to first 
carry out those commands that call for data nearest the 
read/write heads and then work out to the most remote data 
locations. 
Eight of the wires in an SCSI cable are 
data lines. They carry data in parallel, 
which is one reason why SCSI is faster 
then EIDE. Wide SCSI uses 16 lines to 
carry data and makes transfers as fast 
as 40MB a second. There's also Ultra2 
SCSI and Ultra-640 SCSI, which 
transfer at rates up to 40MB per second 
and 640MB per second, respectively. 
The devices use another eight wires 
to send messages among themselves 
akin to "May I have the floor? " or 
"This data is going to the printer." 
The last SCSI device on the bus must be terminated. That involves 
circuitry or a physical metal cap to damp the electrical noise the 
SCSI cable would generate otherwise.

CHAPTER How a Com~uler 
Display Works 

CHAPTER 18 
HOW A COMPUTER DISPLAY WORKS 
WHEN you read the Sunday funnies, you're looking at a hardcopy version of the way a computer 
displays graphics. Put a magnifying glass to the color comics and you'll see that they are made up of 
hundreds of dots of red, blue, yellow, and black ink. Different colors and shades are created by varying 
the sizes of the dots, called Ben Day dots. Large red and yellow dots and small blue dots create a 
shade of orange. Increase the size of the blue dots in the same area, and the color becomes brown. 
If you look at a comic strip too closely, you see the dots themselves rather than the image they are creat-
ing. But hold the comics away from you and the dots resolve themselves into a single image. 
A PC monitor works the same way but uses green instead of yellow, and it's additive color as 
opposed to printed color's subtractive process. Glowing dots of red, green, and blue chemicals blend 
into millions of colors. 
If you were to study a comic strip and make a meticulous record of the position, size, and color of 
each dot, you would in effect create a non-computerized version of the most common form of computer 
graphics, a bitmap. 
As its name implies, a bitmap contains a specific map of all the bits of data-location and color 
information-that create a computer image by changing the colors in specific pixels on a monitor. 
(Pixel stands for picture element, the smallest area of a monitor's screen that can be turned on or off 
to help create an image.) Bitmaps can be displayed quickly and they're useful when an image is static, 
as Windows's icons and wallpapers are. 
Windows uses graphics and color, largely in the form of bitmaps, to create an interface between 
you and the operating system. They don't simply make Windows prettier, they convey more information 
than black-and-white text. 
We saw in Chapter 9 how computers store and display bitmaps and vector graphics, which can 
adapt themselves to size changes and the movement that 3D animation requires. Here, we will look at 
the two most common ways of displaying output from a computer-the CRT monitor and the liquid crys-
tal display-plus another promising technology: digital light processing.

OUTPUT DEVICES 
How a CRT Paints the Screen 
The DAC compares the digital values 
sent by the PC to a look-up table that 
contains the matching voltage levels 
for the three primary colors needed to 
create the color of a single pixel. In a 
normal VGA adapter, the table con-
tains values for 262,144 possible col-
ors, of which 256 values can be 
stored in the VGA adapter's memory 
at one time. Today's Super-VGA 
adapters have enough memory to 
store 16 bits of information for each 
pixel (65,536 colors, called high 
color) or 24 bits a pixel (16,777,216 
shades-or true color). 
Digital signals from the operat-
ing environment or application 
software go to the super 
video graphics array 
(SVGA) adapter. The adapter 
runs the signals through a cir-
cuit called a 
log converter (DAC). 
Usually, the DAC circuit is 
contained within one spe-
cialized chip that contains 
three DACs-one for each 
The adapter sends signals to 
three electron guns located 
at the back of the monitor's 
cathode-ray tube (CRT). 
Through the vacuum inside 
the CRT, each electron gun 
shoots out a stream of elec-
trons, one stream for each 
of the three primary colors. 
The intensity of each stream 
is controlled by the signals 
from the adapter. 
eRTs Go on a Diet 
The adapter also sends signals to a mecha-
nism in the neck of the CRT that focuses 
and aims the electron beams. The mecha-
nism, a magnetic deflection yoke, 
uses electromagnetic fields to bend the 
path of the electron streams. The signals 
sent to the yoke help determine the moni-
tor's resolution-the number of pixels 
displayed horizontally and vertically-and 
the monitor's refresh rate, which is how 
frequently the screen's image is redrawn. 
Video engineers overwhelmingly agree that despite the popularity of 
sexy, thin LCD and gas plasma displays, the best display in these days of 
high-definition TV is still the same old CRT that has been the mainstay of 
television since the era of Milton Berle. But CRTs have been losers to dis-
plays that are getting more expansive even as they are getting thinner. 
The traditional CRT requires more depth as the screen size increases 
because it needs more room and power to bend its single electron beam 
so the electrons can reach the far edges of the screen. 
A technology called surface-conduction electron-emitter display 
(SED) promises to combine the best of CRTs, LCDs, and plasma displays. 
The screen is that of a CRT in that it is made of phosphors painted on the 
inside of a plate of glass. But instead of a roving electron beam that 
sweeps the inside of the screen, each phosphor dot has its own emitter, 
which shoots electrons at only its matching phosphor. SED, scheduled to 
go into full production by 2007, has the visual quality of a CRT and the 
slimness of LCD and plasma flat panels. 

CHAPTER 18 
HOW A COMPUTER DISPLAY WORKS 
245 
The beams pass through holes in a 
metal plate called a shadow mask. 
The purpose of the mask is to keep the 
electron beams precisely aligned with 
their targets on the inside of the CRT's 
screen. The CRT's dot pitch is the 
measurement of how close the holes 
are to each other; the closer the holes, 
the smaller the dot pitch. This, in turn, 
creates a sharper image. The holes in 
most shadow masks are arranged in 
triangles, with the important exception 
of those of the Sony 
Trinitron CRT used by 
many monitor 
manufacturers. 
The Trinitron's 
holes are 
arranged as 
parallel slots. 
Dot 
The electrons strike the phosphors coating the inside of the screen. Phosphors 
are materials that glow when they are struck by electrons. Three different phos-
phor materials are used-one each for red, blue, and green. The stronger the 
electron beam that hits a phosphor, the more light the phosphor emits. If each 
red, green, and blue dot in an arrangement is struck by equally intense electron 
beams, the result is a dot of white light. To create different colors, the intensity 
of each of the three beams is varied. After a beam leaves a phosphor dot, the 
phosphor continues to glow briefly, a condition called persistence. For an 
image to remain stable, the phosphors must be reactivated by repeated scans 
of the electron beams before the persistence fades away. 
After the beams make one horizontal sweep 
across the screen, the electron stream s are 
turned off as the magnetic yoke refocuses the 
path of the beams back to the left edge of the 
screen at a point just below the previous scan 
line. This process is called raster scanning.

The magnetic deflection yoke continually changes 
the angles at which the electron beams are bent so 
that they sweep across the entire screen surface 
from the upper-left corner of the screen to the lower-
right corner. A complete sweep of the screen is 
called a field. Upon completing a field, the beams 
return to the upper-left corner to begin a new field. 
The screen normally is redrawn, or refreshed, 
about 60 times a second (or higher). 
Some display adapters scan only every other line with each field, a process called 
interlacing. Interlacing allows the adapter to create higher resolutions-that is, to 
scan more lines-with less expensive components. But the fading of the phosphors 
between each pass can be noticeable, causing the screen to flicker. 

The model shown here is only 
one way in which liquid crystals 
and polarizers can manipulate 
light. Some LCD panels use two 
polarizers with the same align-
ment so that a charge applied to 
a liquid crystal cell results in light 
that's blocked because it's 
twisted. Also, two methods are 
used to apply charges to liquid 
crystal cells. Passive matrix 
displays use relatively few elec-
trodes arranged along the edges 
of the liquid crystal layer and 
rely on timing to be sure the cor-
rect cells are charged. The 
charges in passive matrix cells 
fade quickly, causing the colors 
to look faded. Active matrix 
displays, such as the one shown 
here, have individual transistors 
for each cell. The individual tran-
sistors provide a more precise 
and stronger charge, creating 
more vivid colors.

How Plasma Displ

Address 
Electrodes 
A television receiver or a video card controll ing 
a gas plasma display sends electrical currents to 
two sets of electrodes. The address electrodes 
running vertically in the rear of the gas plasma 
display identify which of the display's pixels are 
affected when electricity passes through another 
set of transparent display electrodes, mounted 
horizontally in the front of the pixels. Running 
through layers of glass and magnesium oxide, 
which protect and insulate the electrodes from 
each other, the electrodes extend the length and 
width of the rows and columns of pixels that 
make up the display. The electrodes form inter-
sections that sandwich each of the more than 
three quarters of a million pixels. 
The pixels are cells, depressions in ridges called ribs 
that separate the cells. The walls of the cells are spray-
pointed on the inside with one of three types of phos-
either red, blue, or green when they 
Trapped inside each cell is a mixture of 
Gas plasma displays have a lot going for them in the race for flat, thin 
computer and television displays. Like an LCD screen, a plasma display is 
less than two inches thick. You can hang it on the wall like a painting (a 
very heavy painting). But unlike LCD, plasma is brighter and can be seen 
from a wide angle-160° -because light does not pass through polarizing 
filters. Polarization, by its nature, absorbs most of the light that strikes the 
filters, and the light that does pass through travels mostly at a right angle 
to the surface of the screen, requiring you to view the screen straight-on for 
best brightness and contrast. Gas plasma displays can easily be larger 
than LCDs. Plasma does, however, have a problem with burn-in, but mak-
ers are working on that. 
LCD, on the other hand, has price advantages, creates lighter displays, 
and their manufacturers are working to overcome the blurring of fast-mov-
ing objects and to increase the view angle. But both LCD and plasma 
might be supplanted by surface-conduction electron-emission displays 
(SED). The new technology is essentially a flat CRT screen with a separate 
electron gun for each pixel. See the illustration on CRT, "How a CRT Paints 
the Screen," p. 244. 

CHAPTER 18 
When the display controller wants a particular 
pixel to glow, it opens the address line that 
leads to that pixel's cell. (Opening is accom-
plished by closing a circuit so electricity can 
flow through it.) At the same time, the con-
troller sends a stream of electricity down the 
display line leading to the same pixel. The 
electricity, aHracted by the charge on the open 
address line, jumps through the cell to com-
plete a circuit with it. The energy from the elec-
trical current excites the atoms in the gas 
mixture, turning the gases into a plasma, the 
fourth state of matter high school science 
classes don't tell you about when studying 
solids, liquids, and gases. 
HOW A COMPUTER DISPLAY WORKS 
249 
Matter turns into 0 plasma 
when an energy source 
excites normally stable 
gases, such as neon and 
xenon. Free-running elec-
trons from the electricity 
strike the gas atoms, creat-
ing and imparting their 
energy to ions, which are 
atoms that have become 
positively or negatively 
charged because of an 
imbalance of electrons. 
The ions are unstable and 
revert to their normal state. 
When they do, they emit 
the energy that created 
them in the form of ultravi-
olet bullets of light called 
photons. 
The ultraviolet photons strike 
the phosphors on the walls of 
the cell. The photon's energy 
excites the phosphors so they 
glow-similar to the process in 
an everyday cathode-ray tube 
monitor. Different phosphor 
materials that glow either red, 
blue, or green coat the inside 
of adjacent cells to create a sin-
gle logical pixel. By varying 
the amount of current going to 
each cell, the display changes 
the mix of the three primary 
colors to create different hues. 

Another way of casting a computer display image is with a liquid-
crystal display projector. Colors and images are created the same 
way for an LCD project as they are for a laptop computer's LCD 
panel. The essential differences are that the projector's light 
source is much stronger than a laptop's, and the image is focused 
through a lens. But the nature of an LCD means much of the light 
is absorbed so that an LCD image is dimmer than a DLP projec-
tion. In addition, the gaps between the mirrors in a DLP display 
are smaller than those between the cells that form the LCD, mak-
ing the DLP image sharper.

CHAPTER 19 HOW DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY WORKS 
253 
PUT a digital camera next to a comparably priced camera that still uses film. What's the difference? Certainly it's 
not anything you can see: They both have a lens, some sort of viewfinder to peer through, and similar assortments of 
buttons and knobs. 
The important difference between the two cameras is buried inside them. Take off the back of the film camera and 
you'll see a slot at one end where you insert your cassette of film and an empty spool on the other end to take up the 
roll of film as each frame is exposed. Between them is the shutter. When the camera back is closed, the film is held 
firmly against the frame around the shutter by a smooth flat surface called the pressure plate. 
Take a digital camera and open the back-and you can't! There is no way to open it and see what's inside. 
That's what this chapter is for, to show you what you ordinarily can't see on your own. What you'll see in this chapter 
is that all the apparatus inside a film camera-and the film itself-have been replaced by a microchip packed with 
microscopic electronic switches called transistors. This chip is similar to the computer microchips you've been read-
ing about in this book. 
This particular type of microchip, as you'll see in more detail later in the book, is covered with a special type of 
transistor-millions of transistors, actually-that is sensitive to light and converts that light into electricity. The chip is 
called an image sensor, or an imager. 
The image sensor's ability to translate different colors and intensities of light into constantly changing electrical 
currents is what accounts for the other important differences between digital and film cameras. The most obvious is 
that most digital cameras have an LCD screen on the back of them, like a tiny N set, where the camera displays the 
scene to be shot or the photographs already stored in the camera. The LCD has its own array of transistors that do 
just the opposite of the imager's transistors: They convert electricity into light. (More about that, too, later on.) 
If you inspect the two cameras closely enough, you might find some other differences. The digital camera might 
have, for example, a button or switch for something called white balance. It might have controls for onscreen 
menus, or for displaying information about a shot you've snapped, or a button with an icon of a trash can that's used 
for deleting files. 
But that's about it. Those are all the differences you'll find by visually inspecting your digital camera---even if you 
tear it apart. With few exceptions, such as the aforementioned white balance, you use a digital camera just as you 
would a film camera. 
But after you click the shutter, letting light fleetingly strike the image sensor, you've created not just one picture, but 
the possibility for scores of pictures. The future of that picture is limited only by your imagination.

How Digital Cameras Capture Light 
The street you're driving down doesn't suddenly end here and start again over there, with no way to bridge 
the gap. Time doesn't stop for 5 minutes and then pick up again where it left off. Of course, if it did, how 
would we know? The point is that we're used to thinking of things as analog-smooth, continuous objects 
without any quantum gaps between here and there. But in the computer world-and your digital camera is a 
computer-nothing is smooth and continuous. It's digital. There are gaps between this point and that one, 
between this moment and the next. Before we can do all the wonderful things available to us now 
109 
that a computer is packed into our camera, we and our cameras have to communicate- we 
~no 
with our words; the cameras with a mathematical alphabet of only Os and 1 s. 
Anything in the universe can be measured in analog or digital terms. 
Analog simply means that the expression of the measurement is analo-
gous to whatever it's measuring. An old-fashioned thermometer with red-
dyed alcohol in a tube gives an analog representation of how hot it is 
because the alcohol rises, literally, as the temperature rises. A digital 
thermometer expresses the temperature in numbers on a small LCD screen. 
The numbers themselves don't grow larger as the temperature rises. 
Film is an analog method of 
recording a photo. Where 
light strikes the silver halide 
crystals embedded in film, the 
crystals clump together. 
Where the light is stronger, 
more crystals clump. Where 
the light is dimmer, fewer 
crystals clump. 
The photodiodes that replace film in a digital camera don't 
look any different after a picture is snapped than they did 
before. They don't shift about on the surface of the image 
sensor to clump where the light is stronger. But there is an 
unseen analog process afoot when a digital photo is taken. 
Each of the photodiodes collects php tons of light as long as 
the shutter is open:. The brighter a p.art of a photograph is, 
the more photons hit the pixels. that 'are analogous to that 
part of the scene. ;When the sh'utter:closes, all the pixels 
have electrical chQrges that ar~ proportional to the amount 
of light they recei-,led. If ;'ou picture' the photons piling up 
like little piles of glowing pebbles, you'v;e gotth~ idea.

CHAPTER 19 HOW DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY WORKS 
255 
What happens next depends on whether the image sensor is a CCD (charged coupled device) or CMOS (complementary metal 
oxide semiconductor). Don't bother with the full-fledged names. Everyone uses the acronyms, and they won 't be on the quiz. You will 
hear a lot of techno-hype from camera makers citing reasons one technology is better than the other. You can ignore that, too. The type of 
imager is just one factor that contributes to the photo that eventually will come out of your printer. It's the print that's important. Whether 
you' re happy with it or not doesn't hinge on the type of image sensor. But here, for the sheer joy of knowledge alone, are the differences 
in how the two types of chips work. 
CCD 
The charges in an interline 
CCD imager, which is what 
most CCDs are, begin an 
orderly procession toward 
their future existence as digi-
tal numbers like well-
behaved schoolchildren in a 
fire drill. At one end of the 
imager, the charges move 
down and out at the bottom 
of the column as if someone 
were continually pulling the 
bottom can of Coke out of a 
dispenser. 
When the last charge has 
rolled out of the bottom of the 
column, the charges in the 
second column shift to fill the 
vacancies left by the newly 
departed charges. The 
charges in the third column 
move to the second column, 
and the thousands of remain-
ing columns follow their lead 
like a panoramic Busby 
Berkeley number. 
CMOS 
When a column of charges falls out of the imager, it is 
detected by the read-out register, which takes them to an 
amplifier. Until they are amplified, the charges are more faint 
static electricity than electrical current. The amplifier pumps 
energy into the charges giving them a voltage in proportion to 
the size of each charge, much as a flagging video game 
character is pumped up with "life force" by jumping on a coin. 
Unlike the photosites 
in CCDs-pretty much 
passive capacitors 
that do little but store 
an electrical charge 
until a control some-
where else tells them 
what to do with it-a 
CMOS sensor is able 
on its own to do some 
of the processing nec-
essary to make some-
thing useful out of the 
charges the photosites 
have obtained from 
the light. 
The first thing the 
CMOS image sensor 
does is use the ampli-
fiers that are part of 
each photosite. This 
eliminates the need 
for the charges to go 
through an amplifier 
in single file after 
they've left the sensor. 
More importantly, the 
onsite amplifier elimi-
nates the slow class-
room drill CCDs use to 
leave their nest. As 
soon as the amplifiers 
have turned the 
charges into actual 
voltages, those volt-
ages are read over a 
grid of X-Y wires 
whose intersections 
correspond to loca-
tions of the photosites. 
It's the voltages' way 
of saying simultane-
ously, "Beam us up." 

256 
How Autofocus Lenses Work 
The light falls on a strip of 100-200 
photocells similar to those that make up 
the imaging sensor. The strip is positioned 
so that the distance the light travels to it is 
equal to the distance to the imaging sensor. 
Light passing through the lens of a 
camera is diverted from the image 
sensor at the back of the camera by 
a mirror or prism.

The microprocessor moves the lens and 
again compares the photocell intensities . 
As the scene comes more into focus, the 
contrast between adjacent photodiodes 
increases. When the microprocessor 
gauges that the difference in intensity is 
at its maximum, the scene is in focus. 
Autofocus Limitations 
Both passive and active autofocus have advantages and disadvantages. Active focusing works at night and in dim lighting, but 
the infrared light can bounce off glass or mirrors, confusing the camera's processor. Using passive focusing , you aim through win-
dows and there are no distance limitations beyond which it cannot work. But a blank wall or a scene devoid of straight edges, 
particularly vertical lines, throws passive autofocus for a loop. 
To minimize the effects of shooting through glass, the photographer can put the lens directly on the glass. The infrared light 
passes through the glass. Any light that bounces back makes the trip too quickly for the camera to use its timing information. 
With passive autofocus, turning the camera 90° can give the camera the perpendicular lines it needs. In scenes with little con-
trast, try focusing on an object elsewhere about the same distance away as your subject. Then keep the shutter button pressed 
down about halfway as you turn to frame your real subject. On some cameras, holding the button locks the focus until you press 
the button all the way to shoot your photo or until you release it. The camera's processor compares the intensity of the light falling 
on each photocell to the intensities of the adjacent cells. If the image is out of focus, adjacent pixels have similar intensities; there 
is little contrast among them . 

258 
OUTPUT DEVICES 
How Auto Exposure Works 
The most complex part of a digital camera is its exposure system. It's more than a photodiode measuring the light coming 
through the lens. Among the most versatile cameras, the exposure system has more than one way to measure light and mixes 
those measurements into a brew made of settings for the type of lighting; the sensitivity of the image sensor; and special set-
tings for action shots, fireworks, black-and-white, or even special effects such as sepia toning. That brew is siphoned to set into 
action the diaphragm and shutter, all in the blink of an eye. 
Less-expensive digital cameras-called point-and-shoot (POS) 
models-often have only one of the many ways of measuring light 
that more-expensive cameras boast. It's called full-frame and it 
typically uses one photodiode device mounted next to the lens. On 
better cameras, full-frame metering uses several photodiodes-as 
many as 45-mounted in the path of the light on its way from the 
lens to the shutter hiding the image sensor. Either type of full-frame 
averages the intensities of light reflected off a subject to determine 
a shutter speed and aperture that will produce an exposure that is 
expected to render everything in the photo. But unless a scene is 
evenly lit and contains only subjects with the same color value, full-
frame exposures are usually less accurate. 
Photodiode arrays 
Photodiode 
In the photo here, for example, the 
bright sunlight falling on the bricks 
behind the boy riding in his car has 
made the camera's auto exposure fea-
ture overcompensate and shut down the 
diaphragm too much. The result is 
muddy shadows revealing little detail in 
the most important part of the photo. 

El 
CHAPTER 19 
This occurs because exposure systems think that no 
matter how bright or how dim something is, it is 1 8% 
gray (which is considered a medium gray). In these 
photographs, you can see white, gray, and black sheets 
of paper in their true colors when they are all in the 
same photo. But when each is photographed so that it 
is the only object measured by the exposure meter, the 
camera's exposure automatically is set to render the 
three sheets of paper as the same medium gray. 
To overcome the perils of using an average of an 
entire scene's illumination, better digital cameras have 
alternative ways of measuring light that can be chosen 
from a menu displayed in the camera's LCD screen or 
by one of the camera's control knobs or buttons. The 
first alternative is center-weighted measurement. It 
meters the light in an area that amounts to about a 
tenth of the total photo area. As the name implies, that 
tenth is located in the center of the screen on the the-
ory that that's where the most important part of the 
scene is. 
The Half-push 
HOW DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY WORKS 
259 
The other common alternative is spot metering, which gives 
the photographer greater ability to expose the part of the 
scene that is most crucial. Illumination is read from only a 
small circle in the center of the screen, allowing the photogra-
pher to expose for the lighting on a cheek that might be sur-
rounded by dark hair and a beard that would otherwise 
overwhelm the light readings. When the crucial subject matter 
is off-center, some cameras have the capability to make small 
areas on different parts of the image the spot for purposes of 
metering. For those without such cameras, you can use the 
shutter lock described in the box below. 
When the most important element of a photo is not in the center of the frame, most cameras have a shutter lock feature that 
lets them focus and get an exposure reading for their picture by aiming the center at that important element. Then, by push-
ing the shutter button only halfway, the autofocus and auto exposure settings are locked. The photographer then reframes 
the picture with that key element away from the center and presses the shutter button the rest of the way.

GAMES AND MULTIMEDIA 
If you could do whatever you wanted, it wouldn't be a game. 
-Clive Thompson 
THE original IBM pc, compared to today's personal com-
puters, was a poor, introverted little thing. It didn't speak, 
sing, or play the guitar. It didn't even display graphics well 
or show more than four colors at a time. Not only is today's 
multimedia revolution changing the ways we use PCs, it is 
also changing our use of information itself. Where informa-
tion was formerly defined as columns of numbers or pages of 
text, we're communicating both to and from our PCs and 
using our voices, our ears, and our eyes, not simply to read, 
but to see pure visuals. 
Today the distinctions among computers, movies, televi-
sion, radio, CD players, DVD players, TiVo, and game con-
soles have all but disappeared. They are losing their 
individual identities to be co-opted, Borg-like, into one all-
encompassing, networked system that serves up entertain-
ment, information, and communication throughout the home 
and the work place. Add the cell phone, which is rapidly 
morphing into an extension of this 
computer/entertainment/communication personal conglomerate, and the boundaries of 
the home and office dissolve, too. 
We are headed quickly toward the utopian idea of pervasive computing. Expect 
other devices to join the party. Sensors in the walls, in your bed, or in your cereal will be 
able to monitor your blood pressure, cholesterol, diet, and provide your doctor with a 
video view of your alimentary canal without you realizing any of it. As you play 
squash-prescribed because micro-analyzers in your vitamin pill radioed back a less 
than ideal body fat ratio-an ear bud whispers a warning that the stock you're watching 
shows signs of a collapse. Without missing a stroke, you whisper back to sell.

If all this turns out to be true, you can thank a bunch of computer hackers-an 
admirable term back then-who in 1961 had been set loose on a new PDP-l computer 
in the laboratory basement at MIT. Without someone like them, 
computers would have very likely remained tools for crunching 
drab numbers and data, text-only machines that would have been 
only a glorified combination of typewriter, adding machine, and 
card catalog. But the MIT hackers nudged computing in the right 
direction to develop, after decades of growth, into talking, breath-
ing, listening, living machines that are a part of our world and that 
invite us into their virtual worlds. 
After creating from scratch the basic software---compilers, 
debuggers, and text editors-needed by any computer to write real 
programs, the hackers plunged into creating a serious piece of soft-
ware: Spacewar. The game began as cute graphics demonstration 
that allowed three points of light to interact with each other based on parameters 
entered at the keyboard. The three points of light quickly evolved into a star and a cou-
ple of spaceships, which soon developed the ability to fire torpedoes in the form of 
even smaller dots of lights. There was a realism to the game that most computer games 
for the next couple of decades didn't have. The objects followed laws of physics. The 
ships had to overcome inertia to get moving and overcome inertia to stop. The sun's 
gravity affected their paths and those of the torpedoes, and Spacewar allowed you to 
reverse the laws so the sun repelled objects instead of attracting them. 
It wasn't until 1992 that computing took its next big step toward creating virtual 
worlds, although few back then could have seen where it was headed. id Software dis-
tributed a free game called Wolfenstein 3D. The back story was that you were a soldier 
on the loose in a Nazi prison. You had to fight your way through several levels full of 
enemy soldiers, vicious dogs, and the Big Boss himself. 
The graphics were crude. But it had a grabber: It was modeled on a 3D environ-
ment that enabled you to move in any direction you wanted. Most games until then had

The enemy soldiers had a primitive artificial intelligence that enabled them to react to 
what you did. (Fire your gun, for instance, and they might hear you and come running.) 
Wolfenstein 3D was followed by id's Doom, which was Wolfenstein 3D on a big 
budget and with all imaginative shackles cast off. The popu-
larity of Doom and all its imitators spurred the development 
of video cards and sound cards that could more realistically 
render a 3D environment, which made it possible for soft-
ware developers and artists to create more and more realis-
tic games until they reached the point today where each 
blade of grass and every strand of hair can move in individ-
ual reaction to a 3D world. 
Games have brought us to the point that our world and 
game worlds are separated by only a thin fabric of reality. 
It's easy to become caught up in these games and easy to 
see how they have already overlapped into television and 
movies, where some characters exist only as creatures of a 
computer performing next to flesh-and-blood actors. 
We're in the next big revolution without knowing it. It's a revolution that enables a 
3D model to contain an entire virtual world as a collection of software files, a database 
of objects, and their locations in the virtual world. Join in the 3D world through your 
computer, your TV, and maybe soon through your cell phone, and the database records 
your movements and your position and those of thousands of others in the same game-
world. It gathers information about what you should be seeing, hearing, and feeling and 
transforms that data into changes you see on the display; hear on your 3D, spatialized 
speakers; and feel in your force feedback controller. If it keeps on like this, soon, very 
soon, we might stay home for a visit to virtual reality more often than we leave the house 
to visit real reality.

KEY CONCEPTS 
3D graphics 
Not the same as 3D movies, in 
which you have a sense of depth. Instead, computer 
animation is rendered in real time, in which you can 
infinitely change the viewpoint. 
AVI 
Acronym for audio/video interleave, one of the 
most common file formats that combines video and 
sound. 
bitmaps 
Graphics designed to look like skin, cloth-
ing, brick walls, and other 3D objects in games or vir-
tual reality. 
DVI 
Stands for Digital Visual Interface. It's a video 
connector standard that is designed for use with fully 
digital displays, such as those based on LCD and DLP 
technology. 
frame rate 
Speed of animation, usually expressed 
in frames per second. 
laser 
Originally an acronym for light amplification 
by stimulated emission of radiation, a laser is a 
device that produces a coherent beam of light. That 
is, the beam contains one or more extremely pure col-
ors and remains parallel for long distances instead of 
spreading as light normally does. 
MIDI 
Acronym for musical instrument digital inter-
face, MIDI is a protocol for recording and playing 
back music on digital synthesizers supported by most 
sound cards. Rather than representing musical sound 
directly, it contains information about how music is 
produced. The resulting sound waves are generated 
from those already stored in a wavetable in the receiv-
ing instrument or sound card. 
MMORPG 
Acronym for massively multiplayer 
online role-playing game, a computer role-playing 
game that enables thousands of players to play at the 
same time and interact with each other in an evolving 
virtual world over the Internet. 
MP3 
An audio file compressed so that it's one-tenth 
the size of the original sound file. The compression 
technique is based on the third layer of MPEG, a 
scheme devised for compressing video as well as 
sound.

For example, Final Fantasy and Dungeons and Dragons. 
shader 
Plug-in code for graphics rendering soft-
ware that defines the final surface properties of an 
object. Originally, shaders computed only surface 
shading, but the name stuck as new shaders were 
invented that had nothing to do with shading. For 
example, a shader can define the color, reflectivity, 
and translucency of a surface. 
shooter 
Game devoted to shooting many monsters 
and characters. Typically, a first-person shooter, 
as in Doom. 
streaming 
Sending video and audio transmission

vector graphics 
Images created by mathemati-
cally constructing a 3D framework out of polygons. 
The sides of the polygons are vectors in the sense that 
they have a length and a direction. The direction is set 
against some mathematical coordinate system that 
describes a 3D (or two-dimensional) space. Changing 
the mathematical description of the vectors animates 
the polygon images. Shading provides the polygons 
with various characteristics such as color, lighting, and 
texture to create surfaces for the polygons. 
virtual reality 
The simulation of a real or imag-
ined environment that can be experienced visually in 
the three dimensions of width, height, and depth. It 
can include other sensory experiences, including 
sound, touch, and feedback from "touched" objects, 
or other forces and sensations designed to enable a 
person to work in a computer environment by seeming 
to manipulate objects by handling them.

CHAPTER How Multimedia 
Sound Works 

CHAPTER 20 
HOW MULTIMEDIA SOUND WORKS 
FOR years, DOS and Windows personal computers sounded like cartoon roadrunners. They could play 
loud, high-pitched beeps and low-pitched beeps. But they were still only beeps. There was no hiding it. 
We owe today's multimedia sound capabilities to game players. They saw the advantages of hearing 
realistic explosions, rocket blasts, gunshots, and mood-setting background music long before developers cre-
ating business software realized the practical advantages of sound. Now, you can listen to your PC speak 
instructions as you follow along on the keyboard, dictate a letter by talking into your PC, give your PC spo-
ken commands, attach a voice message to a document, and not have to take your eyes off a hard-copy list 
while your PC sounds out the numbers as you're typing them into a spreadsheet. 
None of the multimedia that enhances business, personal, and family use of a PC could exist without 
sound capabilities. Multimedia CD-ROMs and DVDs bring their subjects to life in ways not possible in 
books, because you hear the actual sounds of whales, wars, and warblers, of sopranos, space blaster 
shots, and saxophones. Not that sound capabilities must always enlighten you on a topic. You should have 
fun with your PC, too. It won't make the work day shorter to replace Windows's error chime with Homer 
Simpson saying, "D'oh!" You won't be more productive every time a Windows program opens or closes if it 
makes a sound like those doors in Star Trek. And you'll spend more time than you should creating an MP3 
song collection from your stockpiles of music CDs. But so what? Taking advantage of the sounds in a multi-
media PC personalizes a machine that has a rap for being impersonal. Sound simply adds to the fun of 
using your computer. And we all spend too much time in front of these things for it not to be fun. 
Lately, multimedia sound has taken a reverse spin. As we discussed in Chapter 14, now, instead of us 
listening to our computers, our computers can listen to us. Although a slow, painstaking version of voice 
recognition has been possible for years, it's only with the faster processing first made possible by the 
Pentium III and 4 processors and their technologies that natural speech recognition has become possible. 
We can now dictate, speaking in a normal voice, instead of typing. And although we do so much typing 
that it seems natural, if you think of it, there's hardly a more unnatural way to communicate than tapping lit-
tle buttons. Don't throwaway the keyboard just yet, but in the not-so-distant future, expect to be holding 
complete conversations with that machine on your desk.

GAMES AND MULTIMEDIA 
How Sound Cards Work 
From microphones or equipment such as an audio CD player, 
a sound card receives a sound in its native format-a continu-
ous analog signal of a sound wave that contains frequencies 
and volumes that are constantly changing. The sound card can 
handle more than one signal at a time, allowing you to record 
sounds in stereo. For clarity, this illustration shows separate 
inputs and outputs for stereo, but left and right signals are 
almost always combined in a single jack. 
I 
The analog current is amplified, usually by an amplifier built into the PC's 
speakers. Then, the stronger current powers an electromagnet that's part of 
the speaker, causing the speaker's cone ta vibrate, which re-creats the sound . 
The signals go to an 
analog-to-digital 
converter (ADC) 
chip. The chip changes 
the continuous analog 
signal into the Os and 
1 s of digital data. 
The DSP decompresses the data on the 
fly and sends it to a digital-to-analog 
converter (DAC) chip, which trans-
lates the digital infarmation to a con-
stantly wavering electrical current. 

To playa recorded 
sound, the CPU 
fetches the file con-
taining the com-
pressed digital 
replication of the 
sound from a hard 
drive or CD-ROM 
and sends the data 
to the DSP. 
CHAPTER 20 
HOW MULTIMEDIA SOUND WORKS 
A ROM chip contains the instructions for 
handling the digital signal. Newer 
designs use rewritable memory instead 
of ROM. The flash memory chip allows 
the board to be updated with improved 
instructions as they're developed. 
The ADC sends the binary information to 
a chip, called a digital signal 
processor (DSP), that relieves the 
computer's main CPU of most processing 
chores involving sound. The DSP gets 
instructions about what to do with that 
data from the memory chip. Typically, 
the DSP compresses the incoming signal 
so that it takes less storage space. 
269 
--------------~~ The DSP sends the compressed data to the 
PC's main processor, which, in turn, sends 
the data to a hard drive to be stored, typi-
cally as a .WAY or .MP3 file. 

270 
GAMES AND MULTIMEDIA 
How MIDI and FM Synthesis Work 
The DSP looks up the sound in the ROM's 
table. If the instructions call for, say, a 
trumpet's D-sharp, but the table has a 
sample of only a D note far the trumpet, 
the DSP manipulates the sound sample to 
raise it to a D-sharp pilch. 
If the sound card uses wave-table syn-
thesis to reproduce the sound qualities of 
musical instruments, samples of the actual 
sounds different musical instruments make 
are stored in a ROM chip. 
The MIDI instructions tell the digital 
signal processor (DSP) which instru-
ments to play and how to play them. 
Whereas some types of sounds are straightfarward 
recardings, such as those contained in .WAY files, 
musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) 
sound was developed to conserve disk space by 
saving only instructions for how to play music on 
electronic versions of various musical instruments, 
nat recardings of the actual sounds. 

CHAPTER 20 
HOW MULTIMEDIA SOUND WORKS 
If a sound card uses FM synthesis instead of wave-table synthesis, the DSP tells an FM 
synthesis chip to produce the note. The chip stores the characteristics of different musical 
instruments in a collection of mathematical descriptions called algorithms. By combining 
the DSP instructions with the algorithm, the chips synthesize a facsimile of the actual instru-
ment playing the note. The chip handles some instruments better than others, but generally, 
FM synthesis is not as realistic as a MIDI wave table or .WAV sound reproduction.

TREBLE 
11111II111I1I"""IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIl~""111111111111111 
As a sound track is recorded, just before it is embedded on tape, Dolby noise 
reduction (NR) encodes only the soft, treble sounds so they will be recorded 
louder than they actually are. 
ENCODED SOUNDS 
When the track is actually recorded to tape, the magnetic 
material embedded in the tape adds an unwanted hiss in the 
same range that the Dolby encoding amplified. 
Amplified

Tape hiss 
When the track is replayed, the Dolby player 
decodes the treble sounds to return them to 
their original volume. In the process, the 
volume of tape hiss is reduced to the point 
where it is not detectable.

Multichannel Sound 
A 
Full Dolby Digital 5.1, also called AC3, records sounds in six channels. Five channels record the same range of sounds, from 
V 
3Hzto 
20,OOOHz. 
The sixth channel, the. 1, is narrower. It's the low frequency effect (LFE) channel. It carries bass sounds from 
3-1 20Hz, used for explosions, crashes, and similar loud sounds.

El Among the five main channels, Dolby bandwidth is 
based on each channel's needs. The center channel 
typically carries more data, and Dolby allots it a wider 
band of the bandwidth. But as the channels' relative 
requirements for bandwidth change, Dolby dynami-
cally-on the fly-reallocates the sizes of all the chan-
nels to be sure the most data, and the most important 
data, gets through. 
MP3 and Digital Audio Compression 
A stream of sounds-music, effects, ar speech-contains changes in 
volume, pitch, and overtones that the human ear cannot distinguish 
because they do not exceed the JND-the just noticeable diHer-
ence. If the intensity of a sound doubles, for example, the ear hears 
only a 25% increase; the extra increase is wasted on human ears. 
The JND is not a constant. The JND between any two sounds varies 
with the frequency, volume, and rate of change (which explains why 
you can listen to a car radio comfortably, but when you start the car 
the next time, the radio seems ridiculously loud) . 
MP3, Windows Media Audio, Dolby NR, and other farms of 
audio compression squeeze a sound file to as small as 10% of the 
original size by recording only the JNDs. It ignares differences the 
human ear can't distinguish. It also doesn't waste recarding band-
width by capturing sounds such as faint, high-pitched tinkles, 
which will be drowned out by the pounding of a bass drum. 
When replayed on a Dolby Digital 5.1 system, the sounds are sep-
arated along the six channels to individual speakers, typically three 
front speakers and two surround speakers to the sides. The sixth 
channel, with its explosive bass, goes to a nondirectional sub-
woofer that can be positioned anywhere. AC3 recordings can be 
played on systems that have only one, two, or four speakers. In 
that case, Dolby mixes the signals from the six channels as needed 
to create the most realistic sound it can for that system. 
RIGHT 
LEfT 
To understand how digi-
tal sound processing 
improves recorded 
sound quality and cre-
ates auditory illusions of 
space and environment, 
it's helpful to examine 
one of the oldest tricks in 
the digital audio reper-
toire, Dolby noise 
reduction (NR). 

274 
GAMES AND MULTIMEDIA 
How 3D Audio Works 
~ one of the clues the brain uses to determine 
the source of a sound is the difference in how 
each ear hears the sound. An interaural 
intensity difference is detected because 
the sound is louder to the ear nearer to the 
source. An interaural time difference 
occurs because the sound reaches one ear 
sooner than the other ear. 
DIFFERENCE IN 
SOUND INTENSITY 
SOURCE SPECTRUM 
PINNAE SPECTRUM 
Positional clues are also found in how the pinnae-the exterior 
ear flaps-deform the sound waves as they enter the ear. The 
contours of the pinnae echo, muffle, and accentuate differently 
the various components of a complex sound, depending on the 
angle with which the sounds strike the flaps.

An important environmental factor is surrounding surfaces. 
They both reflect and absorb sound. The reflections called 
reverberation, or reverb, give clues to the direction a 
SOURCE 
sound' is coming from and contribute to the realism of 
sound, because in the real world sounds are almost always 
reverberating off a variety of surfaces. 

CHAPTER 20 
HOW MULTIMEDIA SOUND WORKS 
[) The values for the perceived sound are 
subtracted from the values of the original 
sound, creating a mathematical filter. The 
filters are used to create algorithms that 
software uses with digital signal 
processors (DSP) to create environ-
mental sound that can be applied to any 
sound to re-create the illusion of a sound 
coming from a specific direction and 
reflecting off different surroundings.

a padded cell sounds different 
than in a large tiled room. 
Sound engineers cap-
ture the effect of distance, 
position, pinnae, and reflec-
tion by recording a test sound

using microphones placed in a person's ear canals. As the 
sound source moves in a circle that has the person at its 
center, a record is made of the differences between the 
source sound and the perceived sound as recorded with 
the mikes. Similar comparisons are made between a 
source sound and the sound after it has bounced off an 
array of surfaces, from hard to soft, and smooth to rough. 
SOUND INAUDIBLE OUTSIDE HERE j 
D In an immersive game, for example, the algo-
rithm creates two spheres spreading out from 
each sound source that mathematically

How iPods Dish Oul 
Media To Go 
The Apple iPod was not the first MP3 
The Classic iPod 
player, and you could argue that it does a 
better job of buying songs than playing 
them . But it is nevertheless the undisputed 
ruler of portable music-and video. It owes 
its SU(lcess to an inspired design that ban-
ishes obvious buHons, dials, and knobs to 
replace them with stealth controls that cre-
ate only the tiniest ripples in the smooth sur-
face CDf the player. An early version had 
four s btle buHons beneath the iPod's LCD 
screen, but even they were too obtrusive far 
Apple's designers, who moved them to the 
clicker dial so that one simple circle is the 
only (lontrol you need. 
The controller chip detects the 
increased charge at your finger's 
position, and as you move your 
finger, the chip constantly tracks 
its position and speed. Those 
two measurements are sent to the 
iPod microprocessar which inter-
prets them in terms of what is on 
the screen. If it's a menu, the fin-
ger movement causes a selection

The Shuffle, Nano and Touch 
Despite the iPod's small size and weight, Apple has introduced two more iPods that carry 
compactness to an extreme by eliminating the hard drive and storing all music tracks in non-
volatile memory. 
The Shuffle weighs less than an ounce and measures only about 1 x 1 .6 inches. It has no 
LCD screen and stores about 240 songs in 1 GB of memory. 
The Nano has a color LCD screen and 4 or 8GB of memory, and yet it is considerably 
smaller and lighter than a classic iPod. It stores about 1,000 songs for each 4GB of memory. 
The Touch The resemblance of the iPod Touch to an iPhone is no coincidence. Despite 
the popularity of Apple's Click Wheel for the classic iPod, Apple chose to go with the 
multi-touch technology developed for its cellular phone. (See "How the iPhone 
Works," p. 358, for a detailed explanation of multi-touch.) Like the iPhone, the touch 
displays video and plays MP3s. All it lacks to make it an iPhone is a phone. One thing 
it does have that the iPhone doesn't is built-in WiFi for wireless connections to Apple's 
iTunes website, allowing you to buy and download songs directly to your iPod. 
You make menu selections and control 
playback functions such as volume, 
pause, and skip by using the Click 
Wheel. Four labels along the wheel's 
rim and a raised, but unlabeled, area 
at the center rest on top of five buttons. 
The four rim buttons, which click when 
pressed, are for functions such as 
play/pause and stop. The center button 
selects whatever is highlighted on a 
menu. 
On the undersurface of the Click 
Wheel is a metallic grid that holds 
a faint electrical charge. Each inter-
section in the grid is mapped to a 
different address by the wheel's 
controller chip. When you run your 
finger around the rim, even though 
you exert no pres-
sure against the 
wheel, your finger 
acts as a potential 
electrical ground 
and attracts the 
grid's charge. 
When you select a song or photo, 
the iPod copies that file from its 
permanent storage on the hard 
drive to a temporary storage area 
in RAM and turns off the hard drive 
to conserve the battery. Longer 
music or video is fed to RAM in 
chunks and the drive turned off 
between transfers.

CHAPTER How Multimedia 
Video Works 

CHAPTER 21 
HOW MULTIMEDIA VIDEO WORKS 
279 
VIDEO is nothing new. We grew up with Howdy Doody, Gilligan, and Teletubbies. In many households, the 
camcorder has replaced the still camera as the memory-catcher of choice. So, why does video's arrival on PCs 
seem like such a big deal? It's precisely because video in more traditional forms has become so much a part of 
our lives. We rely daily on talking, moving pictures to get so much of the information we need to learn, to con-
duct business, and to lead our personal lives. 
All the excitement and technical innovations in multimedia concentrate on video and audio, which has it all 
backward. The excitement isn't really in what video brings to computers. It's what computers bring to video. 
After all, we've had multimedia ever since the first talkie (movie with sound). VCRs have been around a lot 
longer than DVDs. So, what's the difference between a videotape and a DVD? What's the big deal? 
Videotape doesn't have random access. The freedom to move to any point in a stream of information is 
random access. It's where RAM gets its name, random access memory. Early computers used magnetic 
tapes to store programs and data, and using them was slow because to get to where data Z is stored, you have 
to go past data A through data Y. That's sequential access. 
It's exactly this issue of access that differentiates multimedia video from a videotape. You have control over 
what you see and hear. Instead of following a preprogrammed course of videos and animation, you can skip 
about as you like, accessing those parts of a multimedia program that interest you most. Or, with videoconfer-
encing, you can interact live with another person in a different part of the world and work on the same docu-
ment or graphic simultaneously. 
Despite the superficial resemblance between a TV set and a PC display, the two produce an image in differ-
ent ways. At least before high-definition digital TV started to become more common, television has been an ana-
log device that gets its information from continuously varying broadcasting waves. A traditional computer 
monitor uses analog current to control the image, but the data for what to display comes from digital informa-
tion-zeros and ones. Of course, most LCD panels don't even bother with that, using a purely digital connection 
from PC to display. 
The flood of data can easily exceed what a display can handle. That's why multimedia video is sometimes 
small and jerky. A smaller image means less information-literally, fewer pixels-the PC has to track and 
update. The jerkiness comes from the slow update of the image-only 5 to 15 frames per second (fps), com-
pared to 30 fps for a TV or movie. By further increasing data compression, many of these limitations have been 
all but eliminated. MPEG compression, for example, lets multimedia video cover the entire screen at a full 60 
fps. Further development of the techniques described here for compressing and transmitting will eventually make 
computer video as ubiquitous as sitcom reruns.

How the Digital Camcorder 
Captures Future Memories 
The digital camcorder is not your father's 8mm movie camera. Fifty years ago, family events and 
vacations were recorded on narrow silent film that faded with the years and grew jerkier each 
time it was fed through the home projector. Today, the family video camera comes within a hair-
breadth of producing movies-videos that are technically as good as you see in the theaters or on 
a TV set. For all the similarities between digital video and still cameras, they are, for the time 
being, different animals. Because the subjects in videos are constantly moving, the eye doesn 't 
notice if the image is not as sharp as a good photo. But the two animals are evolving into a new 
creature-one joins the different circuitry and mechanisms needed to shoot both stills and motion . 
The operator of a low to mid-range digital camcorder has a 
choice of equipment for framing a shot. A viewfinder with 
a magnifying glass in the end of it enlarges a small LCD 
image that shows the lens's vantage point, focus, and amount 
of zoom, regardless of whether the camera is recording . The 
method cuts out distraction and lets the photographer concen-
trate better on the subject. 
The focused light from the lens falls on an image sensor, called a charge-coupled device (CCD), 
The second choice is a larger LCD 
screen that can be twisted to any 
position, even toward the front of 
the camera so the photographer 
can be in the frame while keep-
ing an eye on what the camera is 
seeing. 
or complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chip. Over the surface of the sensor lie ------------
thousands of photodiodes, or pixels, each of which generates electrical current in proportion to the 
brightness of the light that strikes it. Note that camcorders use fewer pixels than still cameras, which 
count their pixels in the millions. Camcorders are more concerned with hustling images through the sys-
tem, at rates of a dozen or two each second, than with image sharpness. In fact, the millions of pixels in 
a camera would quickly be bottle necked by the relative slowness with which camcorders can store the 
visual information they gather. 
The image sensor in less expensive camcorders is larger than the actual image size. This is so the cam-
era can use electronic stabilization to compensate for any jiggle or vibration that would otherwise 
be captured by the camera . Small gyroscopes in the camera detect the movements and signal the cam-
era's circuitry. If the movement, for example, shifts the image hitting the sensor to the right, the circuitry 
shifts which pixels are being recorded to the right. Note that the pixels do not actually move, but rather 
the responsibility each has to capture a certain part of the image moves to a different pixel. More 
expensive camcorders make use of optical image stabilization to move the actual image sensor. 
After an image processor in the camera massages the 
visual data passed on by the sensor, the processor converts 
the image to a system of numerical values that represent dif-
ferent colors and hues. They are joined to similar digital infor-
mation coming from the camera's microphone. The combined 
signal is recorded, usually to magnetic tape. 

CHAPTER 21 
HOW MULTIMEDIA WORKS 
281 
An active autofocus system bounces 
infrared light off the subject and mea-
sures the time it takes to return to gauge 
the distance from the camera to the sub-
ject. Small motors use the distance infor-
mation to adjust the lens so the subject is 
,......-1------ in focus. 
A sophisticated zoom lens 
system provides real, optical 
zoom as strong as lOx. Some 
cameras try to embellish that 
with digital zoom, but optical 
zoom is what really counts. 
An exposure system, similar to those found in 
still cameras, measures the lighting and adjusts the 
lens's diaphragm to the correct aperture opening. 
In most consumer video cameras, varying the 
length of time the shutter is open is not used to con-
------ trol exposure. But the number of times during each 
second that the shutter is opened to create a 
frame may be varied to produce slow-motion and 
fast-motion effects. The standard for commercial 
television in the United States is 30 frames per sec-
ond (fps); for motion pictures, 24fps.

How a Digital Camera Squeezes 
Video Down 10 Size 
Compressing one picture on-the-fly is daunting enough for a digital still camera. But consider the task that con-
fronts a video camera : compressing 15 to 30 images each second-and putting the squeeze on sound at the 
same time. There is no time for lossless compression, even if it could do a good enough job to store even a 
short feature on a DVD. The technology universally used for professional 
and amateur video is a lossy compression called MPEG, named after 
the organ ization that created it: the Motion Picture Experts Group. 
MPEG compression is likely to be used on anything you watch on TV, 
your computer, or iPod . 
• 
An essential part of video compression strategy is limiting the 
amount of work the video camera has to do to record so many 
frames each second the camera is rolling. Standard TV 
(non-high definition with a 4 :3 aspect ratio) is made up of 
720 pixels across and 576 pixels ver-
tically. Depending on the sophistica-
tion of a digital video camera, frames 
may be limited to 640 pixels wide 
and 480 pixels high, or even as few 
as 352 x 288 . At 640 x 480, the 
camera is relieved of the task of 
recording information for a hundred 
thousand pixels for every frame it 
processes. 
Inside a video camera, you'll find a chip 
that specializes in MPEG compression (or 
circuitry that does the same job built into 
the master microprocessor) . 
Part of the job MPEG performs 
is similar to the lossy JPEG 
compression used to shrink still 
photos. MPEG looks for redun-
dant data. The wall in the 
background of a video may be 
painted a solid red, making it 
unnecessary for a video cam-
era to record the sa me i nfor-
mati on about each of the red 
pixels that make up the wall. 
As JPEG compression did with 
a blue sky in the example a 
few pages previous, MPEG 
establishes reference values for 
the wall's shade of red and 
refers all the pixels that make 
up the wall to that color. 

Of course, few things in the real world 
are consistently the same color. Vagaries 
of light and shade cause a spot in the 
background to be a slightly different 
shade. MPEG makes a decision: Will 
anyone notice if it makes that errant 
shadow the same color as the rest of 
the wall? If the decision is "no," 
that's a few thousand more bits 
saved. 
CHAPTER 21 
HOW MULTIMEDIA WORKS 
283 
One compression technique assumes, 
rightly, that much video changes little from 
one frame to another. To save space 
recording the video-and broadcasting it, 
for that matter-the technique combines 
part of one frame with part of the next one. 
In the case where there is little change, the 
economy works. 
But in this case, for example, 
where the scene changes 
abruptly from one frame to the 
other, the technique results in 
a fleeting visual glitch. 
The same premise is behind motion estimation, which assumes that 
consecutive frames will be the same except for changes caused by 
objects moving between frames. By examining the changes in two of the 
frames, MPEG predicts the position of objects in a third frame. 
Key frame compression records only 
certain crucial frames and deduces 
from them what the missing intervening 
frames should look like. 
A similar technique makes a 
record of one frame that is 
largely unchanged in subse-
quent frames. The only data 
recorded is the delta-the dif-
ferences that occur in the 
frames trailing the original ref-
erence frame. 

El If the TV signals are analog broadcasts-stili 
transmitted by some cable companies and, since 
the early days of TV, sent over the air and picked 
up by antennas-TiVo passes the analog signals 
though an MPEG-2 encoder. The encoder con-
verts the signals into compressed digital data. 
MPEG-2 is the same compression technique 
on standard DVDs.

There was a time when people thought it was a good idea to control the movements of a computer 
game character with the W, A, S, and D keys, and admittedly, many still do. It shows not just how desper-
ate they were for computer games and hardware yet to be invented, but how the idea of using a computer 
to play games is one of those inborn instincts, like the natural, primal desires to cook meals over an open 
fire and to avoid mimes. 
Still, it took a while for the computer industry to produce decent game hardware because doing game 
controllers right can be expensive. The joystick that controls a fighter plane in Flight Simulator must be as 
precise and capable at the stick in a real jet. There are now controllers that emulate the functions of throttles, 
steering wheels, gas and brake pedals, fishing rods, golf clubs, bats, and pistols, all in manners so realis-
tic-push some of them, and they push back-that you can easily forget it's all a game. 
We'll see here how they work, from the classic joystick through the two-fisted game controls that have 
become ubiquitous and caused young boys to memorize obscure combinations of buttons to push so their 
onscreen game charter will tear off their opponent's head. And we'll get inside Nintendo's revolutionary Wii 
Remote-the Wiimote-that destroys the barrier between a game and playing it with natural movements.

How Video Cards Break the Game Barrier 
The most serious challenge desktop PCs face is not complex spreadsheets or gargantuan databases. It's games. Computer games are 
voracious users of processing power, and gamers merrily pay top dollar for any hardware that will give them a faster frame rate, 
which means they can get off a shot before the next guy does. The need for speed used to be sated by a computer's micro-
processor, but now the video card makers are brave, new pioneers into making computers faster. The two big compa-
nies in gaming video-Nvidia and AT I-both use the tactic of running two video cards at the same time, but 
they've each found different ways to combine the talents of two video cards. 
El 
The two ATI cards, in a parallel processing design ATI calls CrossFire, are joined by the 
cables that form a Y before the tail of the Y goes on to connect the cards to a monitor. 
Nvidia does not make video cards itself, but it makes graphical 
processing units (GPU) and other chips used by many video 
card manufacturers. Nvidia's double-card technology, which uses a 
small circuit board to span the two cards inside the PC's case, origi-
nally was called scan line interleaved (SLl) because every other 
scan line making up a screen display was divided between two 
graphics cards. Nvidia now prefers 
the term scalable link interface 
because it has developed more than 
one way to employ the two linked 
cards. 
In each type of graphics system, the paired cards split the 
geometrical data that describes the game's three-dimensional 
world. Each card has a geometry engine that translates 
the mathematical description of a scene or a character into a 
specific set of points in the 3D arena. Each card's processor 
performs rendering or rasterization, which is crunching 
the intensive math needed to translate the data for a three-
dimensional world into polygons that cover a two-dimen-
sional screen. Many GPUs are programmable, meaning that 
software can teach them new tricks. 
Both graphics systems use scissors rendering to split the 
work load. One card takes responsibility for the top half of 
the screen, more or less, and the other card renders the bot-
tom half. If one of the halves is simpler to render, such as a 
cloudless sky, that card will take on some of the other 
burden to equalize their loads. 
DATI also provides supertiling. This rendering scheme 
breaks the work into a checkerboard pattern. One card takes the 
black squares and the other card works on the red squares. A ch ip on 
one of the boards shuffles the squares into the proper order before sending 
the instructions to the display. 

CHAPTER 22 
HOW GAME HARDWARE PUTS YOU IN THE ACTION 
289 
C An on-chip feature called a shader has responsibilities far beyond those that 
it started with, which had been to paint the pixels of each polygon with the 
proper shading to make them appear three-dimensional. Teday's shaders also 
supply textures, height, specific gravity, weight, and a host of other features 
so an object looks and reacts realistically according to laws of physics. 
The first time the shader pulls any of these properties from RAM, it 
stashes copies of them in faster memory chips on the video card. 
When the shader needs those same properties, it retrieves them 
faster from the onboard memory. 
The rendering engines always try 
to stay a step or two ahead of 
what's being displayed. When both 
cards finish rendering a screen, the 
engines sluff the pixel values into 
frame buffers, sections of high-
speed memory on the card, where 
they wait until it's that frame's lurn 
to show up on screen for its 33 mil-
liseconds of fame. 
The dual cards can also be used to 
create double anti-aliased 
graphics. Jaggies along what 
should be smooth lines are caused 
by having too lillie information to 
properly render the edge. The two 
cards attack the problem from two 
approaches and combine their 
anti-aliasing to achieve smoothing 
effects one card alone could not, at 
least not without incurring a perfor-
mance hit. 
16x PCI-ExprMs bus: With a peak bandwidth of 2 . 1 GB/sec, it 
makes the accelerated graphic port (AGP) at 266MB/sec 
suddenly seem like a fogey. 
Auxiliary power connector: Some cards require this con-
to supply the extra power that powerful video cards demand.

smooth out the lumps in the current.

memory 10 slore bitmaps and give the math and rendering engines 
enough room 10 do their calculations. 
Fan and heat sinks: Needed on both the processor and memory 
chips 10 siphon off the extra heat the hard-working chips generate. 
Crystal: Vibrotes at a steady frequency to regulate all operations on 
the boord. (The cryslol may be susceptible to over-clocking.)

TV and/or to display the computer's own graphics on a TV screen.

How a Joystick Puts You at the 
Controls 
All joysticks are designed to tell a computer how the handle of the joy-
stick is positioned at any time. To do this, all the joystick has to do is 
provide the X-V axis coordinates of the handle. The X-axis represents 
the side-to-side position. The path of the Y-axis is shifted 90 degrees 
from that of the X-axis and represents the forward-back position. 
The base of the handle is connected to a yoke with 
pivots that allow the joystick to move freely in any 
direction. Other types of game controllers, such as 
steering wheels and game pads, might look different 
from a joystick, but they produce signals using the 
same devices and connections a joystick does. 
Position sensors attached to each axis of the joystick 
respond to the joystick's X-V coordinates and send sig-
nals to the game adapter card that the software uses to 
interpret the position of the game controller. The tradi-
tional joysticks create varying electrical analog signals 
through devices such as a potentiometer. Newer joy-
sticks use a device that creates digital measures, often by 
registering how many and how quickly lights on the bot-
tom of the joystick move past some point. 
Signals for the X-V coordinates of the joystick are sent 
along a USB cable to the computer, where the software 
interprets them to figure out the joystick's position.

More advanced joysticks use both sets of X-V axis signals-one set for communicating 
the joystick position and the other to communicate the position of the top hat, an addi-
tional control that's maneuvered with the thumb. Some controllers also track the rota-
tional movement (R-axis) of the joystick. 
Simple contact switches are used for 
the trigger and buttons on the joy-
stick. If a button is pressed, the 
switch sends an electrical signal 
down a matching wire to the game 
card . The adapter card, in turn, 
writes a 1 bit to a specific memory 
address if the button is not pushed 
and a 0 bit if it is pushed. What 
pressing the trigger or buttons does 
depends on how the game software 
is designed to use them . 
Potentiometer 
D The most common type of joystick position-
ing sensor is made up of a capacitor and a 
potentiometer-or pot-which consists of a vari-
able resistor controlled by the two pivotal direc-
"'-----..... 
tions of the joystick. Current flows through the pot to ~ 
the capacitor, an electronic device that holds a tem-
porary electrical charge. When the charge in the 
capacitor reaches five volts, the capacitor discharges. 
When the joystick is pushed one way along either of the axes, 
resistance to electrical current is increased, and it takes longer for the capacitor to charge and 
discharge. When it's pushed the other way, resistance is lowered, more current flows to the capaci-
tor, and it charges and discharges faster. The game adapter card counts how many milliseconds it takes 
the capacitors to charge and discharge, and from that calculates the position of the joystick on both axes. 
Other ways of sensing position are also used, particularly in new digital joysticks. A piezo-electric 
.... sor, commonly used in the smaller top-hat control, uses a crystal that generates an electrical current 
when it is pressed and distorted. 
--Piezo 
An optical grayscale position sensor uses a light-emiHing 
diode (LED) and a charge-coupled device (CCD) that converts light 
from the LED into electricity. Between the LED and CCD is a strip 
of film shaded gradually darker from one end to the other. As the 
joystick moves the strip, the film lets more or less light pass 
through it to reach the CCD.

How Game Controllers Put 
Play at Your Fingertips 
For years, the term game controller was synonymous with joystick. Even Flight Simulator, for many years the most elaborate and realistic of games, 
needed little more than a joystick, a trigger, and a button or two. But as games grew more versatile, players needed more versatile tools to control 
the action. From that need and from hand-held players such as the GameBoy came today's most prevalent controller-a device studded with buttons 
and pads, and held with two hands, as if at any moment it might try to escape. The Playstation's Dual Shock, shown here, is typical of most 
gamepads. Despite their almost universal use, little is intuitive about using them,a fact that has inspired the next generation of digital toys, including 
the Wiimote, shown on the facing page.

HOW GAME HARDWARE PUTS YOU I 
The Wiimote 
With most games, the way gamepads are used has little similarity to what happens onscreen. Delivering 
a kick to an opponent may be accomplished by pressing the action button sequence left, left, Up, Down. 
It's like talking in Morse code. That changed in 2005 when Nintendo showed the controller for its forth-
coming Wii game system. It had no joystick, analog stick, or D-pad and only a few buttons. It looked 
more like a N remote control than a game controller. In fact, Nintendo calls it the Remote; everyone else 
calls it a Wiimote. It also came without obscure button sequences to remember. Its versatility is in its sim-
plicity. Swing it, and it's a bat, a golf club, or a tennis racKet. Point it and push a button and it's a gun. 
Hold it in two hands and it's a steering wheel. To play, you do with the Wiimote what would be natural 
with a bat, a gun, or a steering wheel. It revolutionizes action video games.

CHAPTER 23 
HOW GAMES (REATE 3D WORLDS 
IF most men using computers would admit it-and of course, they won't; men never admit anything 
they're not forced to-the real reason for buying that computer was not to do the taxes, work brought home 
from the office, and an inventory of all those valuable tools in the garage. The guy got it to play games. 
When I was shopping for my first personal computer, some 25 years ago, it had to be able to run 
Microsoft's Flight Simulator. Looking back, Flight Simulator wasn't the most exciting experience you could 
have. Basically you controlled a plane simulation, taking off, flying around for a bit, and then landing-if 
you could; I never mastered it and ended my flights by crashing in as spectacular a manner as possible, 
usually by slamming it into the Sears Tower in Chicago. (It never once occurred to me back then that some-
day someone might use Flight Simulator in a similar way, but for much more sinister purposes.) 
Back then, Flight Simulator was an exceptionally sophisticated piece of software; although unless you 
had propellers in your eyes, flying 300 miles in a straight line is, well, boring. Where are the obstacles to 
avoid, the enemy planes to battle, the drama, the heroism? It was boring for exactly the same reason it was 
such a hit among real pilots. Everything, from the layout of the plane console to the time it took you to fly 
anywhere was realistic. You can get realism in real life. We play games for a little unreality. The unreal has 
stirred brains and imaginations, dreams spawn inspiration, and the new and the different spur change and 
growth. Microsoft had likely reached similar conclusions when they eventual released Combat Flight 
Simulator in 1998. 
And yet computer games get a bad rap, the same kind of bad-mouthing aimed at comic books, outer 
space movies, and Looney Toons when I was a kid. These were the sparks that ignited my visions. And yet I 
look back at those same sparks today and they seem so dull. The giant ants of Them are puny mindbogglers 
compared to the creatures of Alien. An episode of Deadwood has more complexity, characterization, irony, 
inspired use of language, and more challenges for my brain than most novels I read for English courses. 
Computer games-the good ones-immerse you in an alternative reality, force you to use your mind as well 
as your fire button, and stimulate you many times over what a good 01' game of checkers can do. 
So don't keep your DVD of Bioshock at the office hidden in a drawer. Don't be ashamed because you 
sent the kids to bed early so you can play with the Xbox 360. You're exercising your brain, and if anyone 
doesn't understand that, you'd be happy to explain it to them during a death match battle of Unreal 
Tournament 3.

need only three numbers and some agreed-upon 
starting points-the floor, the walls-to precisely 
pinpoint anything in the universe. (For our pur-
poses, we'll ignore that curved space thing 
Einstein came up with.) That's how 3D games get 
started, by using three numbers to determine the 
position of all the important points in the graphic 
rendition of the world they're creating. Of

Three-dimensional objects are created by connecting two-dimensional 
polygons. Even curved surfaces are made up of flat planes. The smaller 
the polygons, the more curved an object appears to be. The graphics pro-
cessing unit on the video card (or cards) has a geometry engine that 
calculates the height, width, and depth information for each corner of 
every polygon in a 3D environment, a process called tessellation, or 
triangulation. The engine also figures out the current camera angle, or 
vantage point, which determines what part of a setting can be seen. For 
each frame, it rotates, resizes, or repositions the triangles as the viewpoint 
changes. Any lines outside the viewpoint are eliminated, or clipped. The 
engine also calculates the position of any light sources in relation to the 
polygons. Tessellation makes intense use of floating-point math. Without video 
cards with processors designed specifically for 3D graphics, the primary Pentium and 
In 3D games, as in life, we locate points 
along three axes: horizontal, vertical, and 
distal-the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis, 
respectively. In three-dimensional space as 
well as games, three points are all that's 
needed to define a two-dimensional 
plane. 3D graphics create entire worlds 
and their populations from 2D 
polygons, usually triangles, because 
they have the fewest angles, or vertices, 
making them the easiest and quickest 
polygon to calculate. Most times, even a 
square, rectangle, or curve consists of 
combinations of flat triangles. (The ver-
tices, as we'll soon see, are mere anchor 
points for straight lines.)

CHAPTER 23 
HOW GAMES (REATE 3D WORLDS 
How Geometry Becomes a Thing 
The results of the geometry engine's calculations-the three-
dimensional location of each vertex in the camera's viewing 
range-are passed to the rendering engine, another part of 
the graphics processing unit (GPU). The rendering engine 
has the job of rasterization-figuring out a color value, pixel by 
pixel, for the entire 2D representation of the 3D scene. It first cre-
ates a wireframe view in which lines, or wires, connect all the 
vertices to define the polygons. The result is like looking at a 
world made of glass with lines visible only where the panes of 
glass intersect. 
To create an illusion of depth, the 3D software must determine, from the cam-
era's viewpoint, what objects are hidden behind other objects. The easy, 
memory-conserving way to do this is z-sorting. The rendering engine sorts 
each polygon from back (the objects closest to the distant vanishing point) 
along the z-axis to the front, and then draws each polygon completely in that 
order so objects nearer the vantage point are drawn last and cover all or part 
of the polygons behind them. In the illustration of z-sorting here, the engine 
renders all the points A, B, C, and D on the line AD. But point C covers point 
D, point B is painted over point C, and point A covers point B. 
Wire frame view 
299 
El Z-buffering is faster than z-sorting but requires more memory on the video card to 
record a depth value for each pixel that makes up the surface of all the polygons. 
Those pixels that are nearer the vantage point are given smaller values. Before a new 
pixel is drawn, its depth value is compared to that of the pixels along the same AB line 
that passes through all the layers of the image. A pixel is drawn only if its value is 
lower than that of all the other pixels along line AB. In the illustration here of z-buffer-
ing, pixel A is the only one the engine bothers to draw because pixels in the house, 
mountain, and sun along line AB would be covered by pixel A. With either z-sorting 
or z-buffering, the result is called a hidden view because it hides surfaces that 
should not be seen. 
Hidden view

GAMES AND MULTIMEDIA 
How 3D Graphics Get Dressed 
Drawing lines among all the vertices on a screen in the process of becoming a 3D image produces a wire frame, or mesh. But it's a naked mesh 
that, even in a hidden view, gives us only the rudimentary clues as to what all the meshes within the mesh depict. To turn these digital skeletons into 
digital objects is to clothe the mesh. The easiest technique to accomplish this is to run a flat layer of even color connecting all sides of each polygon, 
like a tent stretched taut over its poles. Needless to say, the 
effect is still more virtual cartoon than virtual reality. Few

evenly colored. In the real world, objects have spots, streaks, 
grit, grain, bumps, lumps, and, in a word, texture. And so 
were born .... 
Texture Maps 
The early computerized 3D worlds tried to simulate real-
istic surfaces with texture maps. Texture maps are 
bitmaps (unchanging graphics) that cover surfaces like 
wallpaper-more specifically, like the bitmaps that can 
be titled to produce a seemingly seamless surface, a la 
Windows wallpaper. In this scene from a Quake level-
and seen on the previous pages on wireframe and hid-
den views-texture maps are tiled to cover an entire 
surface and to simulate stone and lava. In simple 3D soft-
ware, a distortion called pixelation occurs when the 
viewpoint moves close to a texture-mapped object: The 
details of the bitmap are enlarged and the surface looks 
as if it has large squares of color painted on it. 
Texture maps 
MIP Mapping ---------------, 
MIP mapping corrects for pixelation. The 3D application 
uses variations of the same texture map--MIP stands for 
mu/tim in parvum, or "many in few"-at different resolu-
tions, or sizes. One texture map is used if an object is 
close up, but a bitmap saved at a different resolution is 
applied when the same object is distant. 
Perspective Correction ------------, 
Perspective correction makes tiles of texture maps at the 
far end of a wall narrower than tiles near the viewer and 
changes the shape of texture maps from rectangles to a 
wedge shape. 
Alpha Blending ------------, 
To create effects such as the semi-transparency that occurs 
through smoke or under water, the rendering engine uses 
alpha blending between texture maps that represent the 
surface of an object and other texture maps representing 
such transient conditions as fog, clouds, blurriness, or a 
spreading circle of light. The rendering engine compares 
the color of each texel-a texture map's equivalent of a 
pixel-in a texture map with a texel in the same location on 
a second bitmap. Then, it takes a percentage of each color 
and produces an alpha value somewhere between the two 
colors. A less memory-intensive way to accomplish a simi-
lar effect is stippling to blend two texture maps. Instead 
of performing calculations on each pair of texels, stippling 
simply draws the background texture and then overlays it 
with every other texel of the transparency texture. 
Fogging and Depth Cueing 
Fogging and depth cueing are two sides of the same effect. Fogging, shown in the 
screen shot from British Open Golf-and not to be confused with the effect of wisps of 
fog that comes from alpha blending-combines distant areas of a scene with 
white to create a hazy horizon. Depth cueing adds black to colors by lowering the 
color value of distant objects so, for example, tlie end of a long hall is shrouded in 
darkness. The effect is not merely atmospheric. It relieves the rendering engine of the 
amount of detail it has to draw. 

CHAPTER 23 
301 
People Are Polygons, Too 
The techniques on the facing page were state of the art fewer years ago than this book has been in print. 
But they already look crude compared to the methods of rendering polygons today. In the screen shots 
here, Dawn, the fairy mascot of video chip maker nVidia, is a good example. Constructed entirely of 
polygons, she doesn't reveal her secret no malter how closely she's inspected. That's because she has so 
many polygons that when you see her in wireframe, as in the middle screenshot, the polygons blend into 
a white silhouelte. It's only when you remove the lines that connect the vertices that you can see the con-
struction of her body in the form of a few thousand points. A few years ago, it would have been beyond 
the capacity of PC video cards to construct such a creature in real time. Today's video cards, however, 
can construct and fill more than 6 million polygons every second.

How Shaders Conlrollhe World 
Vision includes shape, color, and, even more importantly, value, or shading. You don't have to have all of these to determine what 
you're looking at, but you do have to have shape and shading. Look at the depictions of the same object on the left. Color is not at all as 
helpful in identifying a shape as is the values-the intensities, or the lightness or darkness-of colors for different portions of an object. 
This is why 3D graphics 
gave birth to shaders. 
The first shaders did 
exactly what their name 
implies: They shaded 
certain polygons on spe-
cific sides of an object 
to give the illusion of 
depth and fullness . The 
technique began simply 
enough, using a single 
shade to each polygon, 
much as you might paint 
different walls of a 
room, but it became .. . 
Bilinear Filtering 
CXlkir In<! 't'aJue r~tilllXm 
whICh IS mDft Importal'll? 
Bilinear filtering smoothes the edges of textures by measuring the color values of four sur-
rounding texture-map pixels, or texels, and then making the color value of the center 
texel an average of the four values. Trilinear filtering smoothes the transition from one 
MIP map to a different size of the same texture. 
Shading 
Flat shading 
Gouraud 
shading 
Using information from the geometry engine about the location of 
light sources, the rendering engine applies shading to surfaces of the 
polygons. The rudimentary flat shading applies a single amount of 
light to an entire surface. Lighting changes only between one surface 
and an adjacent surface . A more sophisticated and realistic method is 
Gouraud shading, which takes the color values at each vertex of a 
polygon and interpolates a graduated shading extending along the 
surface of the polygon from each vertex to each of the other vertices. 
Ray Tracing 
Before long, software and hardware developers realized they 
could have their shaders do more than apply different colors to 
polygons. They melded the abilities of shaders with other rendering 
techniques, such as ray tracing, which plots the path of rays of 
light as they are naturally reflected, absorbed, or refracted by the 
materials they shine on. The combination allowed shaders to create 
polygon chameleons who could take on qualities even real 
chameleons couldn't.

does the same, only with any property animators want to assign an object, such as luminosity, temperature, and qualities that are not at all 
visual, such as weight and specific density. One of the most useful vertex shaders is displacement. In the screenshots above from the game 
Pacific Fighters, the one on the left is an ordinary animation with a necessarily limited number of polygons creating the ocean surface. On the 
right displacement, shaders control not just the height of the polygons but also the height of individual pixels making up the polygons for a more 
complex, more realistic 
surface. 
Particle Shaders 
Vertex shaders are helpful in many areas where objects are so fluid or scattered that the traditional polygons handicap 
the realism of the animation . In these scenes from a short animation by NVIDIA featuring Vulcan, the god of fire, you 
can see how traditional polygons are used to construct Vulcan's body. But notice that the fire leaping from his body is 
not wireframed. That's because the animation uses particle shaders, which operate on each pixel independently of 
polygons to give a unified appearance to fluid objects that are nevertheless separate particles, or molecules. 

Worlds Within Worlds 
MMORPGs are a direct descendent of the non-com-
puterized role-playing game Dungeons and 
Dragons (which also has an online game, called 
Dungeons and Dragons Online). That partially 
explains why so many MMORPGs have medieval 
settings, mythological monsters, and more than a 
modicum of magic. But MMORPGs are not limited 
to the classic D'n'D genre. You can also choose sci-
fi MMORPGs, including Star Wars Galaxies, EVE 
Online, and Tactical Commanders. Back here on 
Earth, Samurai Empire puts you in a medieval 
Asian setting, whereas City of Heroes lets you 
become a full-fledged superhero.

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
IT would be a lot easier to explain how the Internet works if you could hold it in your hand. 
Hardware-real, tangible, with a weight and size-is always easier to understand because 
you can see it and you can point with confidence to say this gizmo leads to that gadget, every 
time. The Net is not just a single thing; it is an abstract system. To understand the significance 
of this term, consider a less abstract system-your body. 
The molecules that make up your body are not the same all your life. New molecules are 
constantly being taken in as food, water, and air, and are recombined into different molecules 
of muscle, blood, and bone. But no matter which molecules make up your hair and eyes and 
fingers, at any moment, the structure of your body remains the same. Your heart doesn't refuse 
to pump because new molecules of blood are created. If you remove some parts of your body, 
the system continues to function; sometimes, as in the case of brain damage, transferring the 
job of the missing parts to healthy parts of the brain. 
As a system, the Internet is similar to a living organism. It grows, taking in new "molecules" 
in the form of PCs and networks that attach themselves to the Net. Parts of the Internet commu-
nicate with other parts that then respond with some action, not unlike the muscle activity set off 
by nerve impulses. You can think of the Internet as a network of networks. Amoeba-like smaller 
networks can break off the Net and live independent lives. Unlike amoebas, those smaller net-
works can later rejoin the main body of the Net. 
The Net is ephemeral. Some pieces-the supercomputers that form the backbone of the 
Internet-are always there. The local area networks (LANs) found at countless businesses qual-
ify as individual organs in the Body Internet. But nothing is really fixed in place-hard-wired. 
Each time you use your PC to connect with, say, a PC in Pittsburgh that maintains information 
on Star Trek, you don't have to use the same phone lines, switching devices, and intermediate 
networks to reach it. The route to Pittsburgh one time might run through Chicago; next time it 
might run through Copenhagen. Without realizing it, you can bounce back and forth among 
several networks from one end of the country to the other, across an ocean and back again, 
until you reach your destination in cyberspace.

It's a lot easier to say what you can get from the Net-infor-
mation of all kinds. Being a system without physical limitations, 
it's theoretically possible for the Net to include all information on 
all computers everywhere, which in this age means essentially 
everything the human race knows, or thinks it knows. But 
because the Net is such an ad-hoc system, exploring it can be a 
challenge. And you don't always find exactly what you want. 
Plenty of software tools make surfing the Net easier, but the 
Internet itself has no overall design to help those using it. You're 
pretty much on your own when you jump in with whatever soft-
ware you can find. 
Despite the amorphous nature of the individual elements that make up the Internet, it 
is possible to describe the structure of the Net-the system that always remains the 
same even as the elements that make it up are changing from moment to moment. And 
for that structure, we can thank Sputnik. 
The Little Net That Grew 
It was 1957 and the Cold War was subzero. The Soviet Union launched the first satel-
lite, Sputnik, shaking the confidence of the United States in its scientific and technology 
leadership. President Eisenhower created the Advanced Research Projects Agency 
(ARPA) within the Department of Defense (DoD) to get the U.S. into space. That role was 
replaced by NASA, and ARPA redefined itself as a sponsor of advanced research pro-
jects at various universities and contractors. 
In late 1960, Paul Baran of the RAND Corporation wrote a series of technical 
papers for the Pentagon analyzing the vulnerability of communications in case of a 
Soviet nuclear attack. A part of the papers were two ideas that would have far greater 
impact than anyone imagined. Baran said that military command messages and control 
signals should be carried over a distributed network that has redundant connections in

case a missile took out part of the system. The best way to do this 
would be to break each message into blocks and send each block 
separately over that network, avoiding any parts that aren't working. 
A specific distributed military network was never built, but a few 
years later ARPA began looking for a way its members could distrib-
ute messages and data among themselves so they could take advan-
tage of each other's research. They came up with the idea of a 
distributed network called ARPAnet, built around something called 
interface message processor (IMP), which connected computers at 
university research centers. IMP also incorporated a technology 
called TCP liP, developed at the National Science Foundation. 
Standing for transmission control protocol/Internet protocol, TCP liP 
calls for breaking up messages and data into packets to which 
addressing information, error correction code, and identification are 
added. The packets can all travel to their destination over the distrib-
uted network, and a computer on the other end checks for mistakes 
and pieces them together in the right order. In 1969, computers at 
universities allover the country were linked to ARPAnet. The first let-
ter sent over the new network was an " L" sent from UCLA to the 
Stanford Research Institute. 
The ARPAnet continued to expand until, in 1972, it connected 
23 host sites. By 1975, one new installation was being added each 
month. Meanwhile, other types of networks, such as the Computer 
Science Network (CSNET), designed to be a less expensive version of ARPAnet, sprang up 
across the country. In 1974, researcher Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf came up with the idea of 
a "network of networks" that would let dissimilar networks communicate with one another. 
By 1982, different networks were adopting TCP liP as their communications standard, and 
the term "Internet" was used for the first time. A year later, a gateway was set up between 
CSNET and ARPAnet using TCP liP as a common standard so people on the two networks 
could communicate with each other.

A high-speed (56Kbps) backbone was built by the NSF to connect five supercomputing centers. 
All the transmission time wasn't used, so the NSF agreed to let local networks connect to each other 
through the backbone. The Internet was born, even if people didn't realize it yet. For years, the 
Internet was the territory of colleges and defense contractors. As the Internet grew, many of the 
people who nursed it through its infancy were dismayed when, in 1991, the NSF lifted restrictions 
on the commercial use of the Net. The first time someone sent out advertising over the Internet-a 
practice destined to earn the name spam-reactions among Internet purists were angry and vocal. 
And equally futile. The Internet and the World Wide Web, a section of the Internet developed to lift it 
out of its text-only origins into the world of graphics, sound, and video, had lives of their own. The 
imp was out of the bottle, and today what started as a modest experiment in communicating is grow-
ing at a rate of 100-200 percent a year. 
KEY CONCEPTS 
ADSL 
Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line: 
Modems attached to twisted pair copper wiring 
that transmit from 1 .5Mbps to 9Mbps downstream

analog 
A signal that can take on any value in 
a range. 
asymmetrical 
Provides different data rates in 
the upstream and downstream directions, where 
upstream is the direction from the end-user to the

The capacity of a channel to carry 
information. Measured in hertz (kHz or MHz) for 
analog transmission media, and in bits per second 
(kbps or Mbps) for digital transmission media.

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
CHAPTER How Local Area 
Networks Work 

CHAPTER 24 
HOW LOCAL AREA NETWORKS WORK 
A local area network (LAN) is, for many people, the entry point to the Internet. A LAN physically 
links several PCs to each other and often to a server that hosts shared data or provides access to the 
Internet. This is accomplished with a variety of materials-twisted-wire cables, fiber optics, phone lines, 
and even infrared light and radio signals. 
Whatever the technology, the goal is the same-to send data from one place to another. Usually, the 
data is in the form of a message from one computer to another. The message might be a query for data, 
the reply to another PC's data request, an instruction to run a program that's stored on the network, or a 
message to be forwarded to the Internet. 
If the data or program for which the message asks isn't on the Internet, it might be stored on a PC used 
by a co-worker on the network, or on a file server, which is a specialized computer. A file server is usu-
ally a high-performance PC with multiple large hard drives that are not used exclusively by any individual 
on the network. Instead, it exists only to serve all the other PCs using the network-called clients-by pro-
viding a common place to store data that can be retrieved as rapidly as possible by the clients. Similarly, 
a network might include an Internet server that links the LAN to the Net, CD-ROM jukebox servers, or print 
servers that everyone on the LAN can use for printing. A print server is a PC connected to a printer, or 
a network printer that can be connected to a network without an intervening Pc. 
If a network does not have a dedicated server, it is a peer-to-peer network. In a peer-to-peer net-
work, each individual's PC acts as a server to other PCs-its peers-on the network and also is a client to 
all its peers acting as servers. 
The network must receive requests for access to it from individual PCs, or nodes, linked to the net-
work, and the network must have a way of handling simultaneous requests for its services. When a PC has 
the services of the network, the network needs a way of sending a message from one PC to another so that 
only the node for which it's intended recognizes it, and it doesn't pop up on some other unsuspecting Pc. 
And the network must do all this as quickly as possible while spreading its services as evenly as possible 
among all the nodes on the LAN. LANs are a microcosm of the Internet, even as the LANs are a part of the 
Internet. 
In this chapter, we'll look at the most common types of networks, including the notorious file-sharing 
networks and the works of the most common LAN configuration, Ethernet.

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
How Packets Divvy Up Data 
Sending information digitally isn't all that new. Samuel Morse sent the first telegraphed message in the U.S.- " A patient waiter is no loser."-in 
1838. He used a binarr system-dots and dashes-to represent letters in ~he alphabet. Before Morse, smoke signals did much the same thin~ing

me 
the standard ways to send data over great distances. With networking and the Internet, however, digital communications are once more in vogue, 
even replacing analog signals used in television, radio, and telephone. What makes this all possible is something called a packet. 
How Analog Data Works 
~ 
Analog communication works with two types of waves. 
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I 
~ 
~ 
A carrier wave, or carrier signal, is a steady, strong wave that car-
ries no information of its own. It is usually sinusoid, which means it has a 
constant waveform, both for amplitude (its loudness) and frequency 
(how many times it cycles from its high point to low point and back again 
in a second). An FM radio station broadcasting at 104.5 "on the dial!" is 
broadcasting a carrier that cycles 1 04.5 million times a second. 
An information wave is produced by a microphone and a recording 
on tape, CD, or DVD. It lacks the carrier wave's strength to cover long dis-
tances. And unlike the carrier signal, it is irregular, changing form con-
stanrly due to the processes that produce it. 
I 
J 
El When the information wave is superimposed on the carrier, the 
information wave modulates the carrier (modulate simply means 
to change something). The informational signal could vary the 
amplitude or the frequency of the carrier. Speech is an example of 
a modulation. Vowels are the carrier that let you project your 
words far enough and clearly enough for others to hear you. 
Consonants are the information signals that transform the Nee" 
vowel into "me," "we," "see," and other variations on the basic 
"ee" sound. When the modulate signal is received (by a radio, 1'1, 
amplifier, or human ear}, the receiver strips away the known values 
of the carrier signal. What is left is the original information signal.

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
File Server (node) 
How Networks Are Laid Out 
I 
Client /Server Networks 
El 
A local area network (LAN) is made up of nodes, usually 
two or more computers in the same building that are linked 
together with wires or radio signals so that files can move 
among the computers. In a client/server network, one cen-
tral computer is the file server. The server contoins pro-
grams and data files that can be accessed by other 
computers in the network. Servers are often faster and 
more powerful than personal computers, running a net-
work operating system, or NOS, such as Windows 
Server 2003, Unix, Linux, or Novell NetWare. A NOS 
manoges the movement of files and the network's 
security by maintaining lists of users, their passwords, 
and the drives and directories for which a user has 
been given access privileges. A server is also 
called a host computer. 
/' 
Some servers specialize in functions 
other than passing out files. A print 
~ 
server lets everyone on a network share a printer. 
The printer can be attached to a computer on the net-
work; some printers designed for network use can be 
connected directly to the network without a host Pc. 
Other specialized servers provide shared access to the 
internet, banks of CD-ROM drives, and tape backup. 
Some servers specialize in running programs that are 
designed for network-wide use, such as an email or 
database server. 
Print 
Server 
(node) 
Peer-to-Peer Networks 
In a peer-to-peer network, there is no central server. 
Instead, all computers on the network act as servers to 
every other node. At the same time, all computers on the 
network act as clients to all the other pes. This is the simplest 
type of network to install. Windows 98, Me, XP, 
and Vista come with the software to set up a 
peer-to-peer network. 
..;------ Clients 
(nodes) 
computers 
attached to a server are 
the clients. Clients run the 
gamut from fat clients-computers 
that run most programs from their own 
hard drives and use a minimum of network ser-
vices-to inexpensive thin clients that might have no 
hard drive at all. They run programs and graphics using their 
own microprocessor, but depend entirely on a server to 
access programs and store data files. A dumb terminal is 
a monitor, keyboard, and the bare minimum of hardware 
needed to connect them to the network. it uses the server's 
microprocessor to perform all functions.

Network (WAN) 
When components 
of a network are 
spread among 
several buildings, 
it becomes a 
wide-area net-
work. Chunks of the net-
work in different locations might be 
connected by phone lines, T1 or T3 con-
nections, leased phone lines, microwaves, 
or the Internet itself. One way to use the 
Internet for a WAN is through a virtual network, software that uses heavy encryption to main-
tain privacy among Internet-connected PCs so that they work and fend off hackers as if the scat-
tered nodes were at the ends of Ethernet cables in the next room. 
(ONNEaION 
TO ANOTHER LAN 
The Shapes of LANs 
The way that data moves from one node to others in a LAN determines 
the network's topology-its shape. 
Bus topology All the nodes in a LAN are connected along a 
single cable-the bus-stretching from one node to the next. It is 
inexpensive and simple to set up, but a bad connection at one 
of the nodes also takes other nodes off the network. 
Token ring All the nodes are connected to a giant ring of cable 
that has no real beginning or end. Data travels from one node to 
another by one node grabbing a token of code that endlessly 
loops through the network. The node replaces the token on the ring 
with the node's data and the address of the node for which it's 
intended. The message circles through the ring until another node 
recognizes that the data is addressed to it. 
Star topology The most common shape for a LAN is the star. Several nodes are 
linked to the network by a cable, radio signals, optic fiber, and so on. They lead to a 
common point at the center of the star, where there's a hub, switch, or router (which 
are explained in the next illustration). Data from a node travels to the center of the 
star, where the device located there passes the data along to the node to which the 
data's addressed. Star configurations are often used to connect two LANs. 

320 
HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
How Network Nodes Connect 
To become part of a network, a personal computer uses a network interface 
card (NIC) or an RJ-45 connector that's part of the motherboard. (For 
portable computers, the interface can be in the form of a PC Card or USB adapter.) 
Communications signals pass from the PC's RAM and through the connection to a 
LAN's backbone, the part of the network that carries the most traffic. The backbone 
and connections leading to and from it might use coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable, 
twisted-pair cable, radio waves, and phone and power wiring to link PCs. The 
combination of connector, circuitry, wiring, and other hardware determines the net-
work's bandwidth.

Coaxial Cable 
,...--,-.vuIAial 
From the connector, data can be sent along BNC coaxial cable, like that used for cable tele-
vision. (BNC stands for Bayonet Neil/-Conce/man, a fact you will not be quizzed on.) Coaxial 
consists of a single copper wire, which is sheathed by plastic and braided copper that shields 
the center wire from electrical disturbances. Each end of a segment of cable has a bayonet 
connector, which requires only a quarter of a turn to attach the cable. 
Twisted-Pair Wiring 
A more common alternative to coaxial is twisted-pair wiring. A plastic outer jacket encloses four 
pairs of insulated wire that are twisted with a different number of turns per inch. The twists cancel 
out electrical noise from adjacent pairs of wires and from motors and other electrical devices in 
the same building.

Each node on the network has a separate twisted-pair cable that connects the node to a central

signals from anyone computer travel to any other node on the network. Any of the connections

nodes themselves check the address data to determine which packets to pay attention to and 
which to ignore. 
• 
Preamble-Synchronizes the network nodes. 
• 
Destination Address-A single PC or all PCs on a network. 
• 
Source Address-The address of the computer from which the packet originated. 
• 
Type-Defines the format used for the data. 
• 
Data-The actual information. 
• 
CRC-Cyclical Redundancy Check, which is used to spot transmission errors. 
Hubs, Routers, and Switches 
In a star configuration, a network uses hubs, switches, and/or routers as traffic cops to move data to the right destination and to 
ward off intruders from the Internet. Each of these devices is a simple box with several plugs to accept RJ-45 or fiber-optic cables. 
Hubs 
El 
A hub receives incoming data packets from different nodes and temporarily 
places them in a memory buffer if the hub is busy with another packet. 
Each packet the hub receives is sent to every other node regardless of the packet's 
addressing. Nodes ignore any packets that are not addressed to them. 
Switches 
El 
A switch functions similarly to a hub, but a switch knows which of its connections lead to 
specific nodes. The switch reads a packet's addressing information and transmits the 
packet out only on the line that leads to the node it's addressed to. 
Some packets-for example, one announcing that another computer has come 
online-arrive addressed for broadcast. This means the sending node wants 
all other nodes to see the packet. The switch sends copies of the packet. 
Routers 
A router is similar to a switch, except that a router does not accept or trans-
mit broadcast packets. A router requires a specific delivery address for a 
node located on the LAN. (But most routers also have switch capability.) 
Routers provide connections to the Internet at the same time they protect the 
LAN from the Internet. The rules might, for example, require the router to 
block any LAN packet that has a destination address outside the LAN and 
somewhere in the Internet. 
If the packet comes from the Internet and is headed toward a node on the 
LAN, the router can send the signal to a log-in routine or reject it entirely. 
If the destinatian address is valid-say, far an email server an the LAN-the 
router lets the packet inta the netwark. Befare sending the data to its destinatian, 
same routers check the packet's CRC segment for errars that have occurred en 
route. If a packet has an errar, the rauter discards it and sends a message to the 
ariginatian address, requesting a fresh packet af the same data. 

322 
HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
How Phone and Power 
Lines Bring LANs 
Networks that work aver existing electrical wiring or tele-
phone wires use radio frequency waves that spread 
through all the wiring in either the phone or electrical 
systems. The variations on the technologies can use 
onloff pulses or sh ift between two different frequencies 
to represent bits of data. The data signals can share 
wires used for electrical or phone because the networks 
operate at frequencies higher than 2MHz. Phone conver-
sations operate between 20Hz and 2.4KHz, and power 
lines cycle at 60Hz in the U.S. 
Electrical line 

CHAPTER 24 
HOW LOCAL AREA NETWORKS WORK 
Because other uses of the lines dramatically affect their electrical characteristics, both networks must adapt instantly to 
changes in current or voltage. By avoiding the frequencies involved in electrical current and phone signals, electrical 
noise does not contaminate data on the lines. Phone conversations, fax transmissions, and use of appliances plugged 
into power lines continue normally without affecting or being affected by the network transmissions.

CHAPTER How PCs 
Connect to 
the Internet 

CHAPTER 25 
HOW PCs CONNECT TO THE INTERNET 
YOUR PC is a digital device. It accomplishes most of its tasks by turn-
ing a series of electronic switches on or off. A binary 0 represents a 
ON 
switch that is turned off; a binary 1 indicates that the switch is on. There 
OFF 
is no in-between designation. A graph of digital code would look like 
this: 
The traditional telephone system is an analog device, designed-at a time 
when digital electronics was unknown-to transmit the diverse sounds and 
tones of the human voice. Those sounds are conveyed electronically, in an 
analog signal, as a continuous electronic current that smoothly varies its fre-
quency and strength. It can be depicted on an oscilloscope as a wavy line, 
such as this: 
A modem is the bridge between digital and analog signals. It converts on and off digital data 
into an analog signal by varying, or modulating, the frequency of an electronic wave, a process 
similar to what FM radio stations use. On the receiving end of a phone connection, a modem does 
just the opposite: It demodulates the analog signals back into digital code. The two terms modu-
late and demodulate give the modem its name. 
There are several modems that aren't modems at all because they work with digital signals. 
Among them are cable modems, which connect a PC to the Internet using the same pathways as 
cable television, and digital subscriber line (DSL) modems, which send purely digital signals 
over telephone lines. The more correct term for them is terminal adapters, but no one calls them 
that. So we won't either. 
Cable and DSL make surfing the Internet a totally different experience. They are broadband, 
which means they have the bandwidth-the capacity-to carry so many words, images, and 
video to your computer, so quickly, that the Net becomes virtually instantaneous 24/7. No waiting, 
no cussing. The appeal is so great that within a few years, the dial-up modem will be found only 
where cable and DSL are too distant to work. And even in the wilderness, there's the option of 
employing a broadband satellite connection that can send broadband anywhere. 
We'll look at both DSL and cable connections in this chapter, but first we look at the traditional 
modem, which manages data transfers up to 28.8 kilobits a second, though most dial-up modems 
today use a scheme called V.90, which involves both analog and pure digital communications for 
transfer rates nearly twice as fast as conventional modems. 
A lot of people continue to use these ancient dial-up connections. If you don't, it's still worthwhile 
knowing how they work. Knowing about the first modems gives you a better understanding and 
appreciation for the newest modems. 
325 

326 
HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
How a Dial-up Modem Calls the Internet 
The current standard in dial-up modem technol-
ogy is called 56K, or Y.92. The technology 
allows a person at a home or office PC to send 
data at the normal analog modem rates of 
33,600bps (bits per second), but get informa-
tion back nearly twice as fast. When a PC uses 
a 56K modem to connect to a host, the 
modem first probes the connection to deter-
mine whether the host modem supports the 
Y.92 standard of transmitting 56,600bbps and 
whether any of the signals coming from the 
host to the PC go through any conversions from 
digital to analog to digital again. In the case 
of multiple conversions, 56K transmissions are 
not possible, and the modems on either end of 
the connection default to normal transmissions. 
However, if a 56K connection is possible, the 
PC and host modems synchronize their timing 
to help ensure the accuracy of the downloaded 
data. 
The PC sends a message or a request, which begins as digital data in the Pc. 
The modem converts the bits to an ordinary telephone analog signal. The 
request travels from the PC's modem along two twisted copper wires that lead 
to a local telephone company's central office. This stretch 
In the client modem, a dig-
ital signal processor 
returns the voltages to 
their digital symbol values 
and translates those val-
ues, according to the sym-
bol scheme that the V.92 
protocol uses, into data in 
the form of bits sent to the 
computer. 
of wire is called the analog local loop and 
the outgoing signals that travel on it, 
under ideal conditions and with data 
compression, are limited to 
36,OOObps. 
Analog 
local loop 

CHAPTER 25 
HOW PCs CONNECT TO THE INTERNET 
327 
At the central office, the signal enters the public 
switched telephone network (PSTN), what 
we generally think of as simply "the telephone 
system ." There, the analog signal is transformed 
into a digital signal. Except for the local analog 
loops, virtually the entire U.S. phone system 
transmits data digitally, which theoretically 
allows data to move as fast as 64,000bps 
and makes V.92 technology possible. 
The data travels through the phone system 
until it arrives at a host system, such as 
America Online or a local Internet ser-
vice provider (ISP). The provider's 56K 
modems recognize whether the signal is 
coming from a matching modem . 
The codec translates the 
data into values 
corresponding to 
the most recogniz-
able of the 256 
possible voltages 
that can be distin-
guished on an analog loop. 
These values are called 
symbols-i nformation-bea ri ng 
tokens. 
When the signals reach the analog 
local loop, a digital-to-analog con-
verter (DAC) generates 8,000 electrical 
pulses each second. The voltage of each pulse 
corresponds to one of the 128 possible symbol 
values. 
At the telephone facility, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) samples 
the incoming analog waveform 8,000 times a second, and each time the sig-
nal's approximate amplitude, or the strength of the current, is recorded as an 8-
bit pulse code modulation (PCM). Although there are an infinite number of 
values for the amplitude each time it's sampled, the ADC can detect only 256 
discrete levels. That's because along the path the electron ic sig-
nals travel, it encounters fleeting electromagnetic fields 
that can come from innumerable sources, including the 
phone wires themselves. These fields produce a current 
voltage that distorts the signal's value-makes it fuzzy. 
This line noise limits analog lines to 33 .6Kbps. 
In response to 
the request from the PC, the ser-
vice returns some sort of information, which 
could be a web page filled with art and 
music, a shareware program, plain text, 
or simply a "Not Found" message. The 
service sends the information through, 8 
bits at a time, to a device called a fJ-law 
codec (fJ-law coder/decoder) . fJ-law 
is named for a mathematical progres-
sion in which the difference between one 
value and the next larger value gets larger itself 
as the values increase. (In Europe, an A-Iaw codec 
uses a different coding scheme, which is why U.S. 56K 
modems only reach their full potential communicating with 
servers in the U.S.) 
If the modems could use all 256 possible symbols, they 
could send 64,000 bits of data each second . But the 
host and client modems use some of the symbols to keep 
tabs on each other. The symbols whose values approach 
zero are too closely spaced to each other to be distin-
guished accurately on a noisy phone line. The modems 
rely on the 128 most robust symbols, which only allow 
56,600bps. (Current FCC regulations limit the power that can be 
used for phone signals, which limits real-world transmission rates to 
about 53Kbps.) 

328 
HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
How DSL Turbocharges a Phone Line 
There are several forms of digital subscriber lines, or xDSL, with the x depending on the 
particular variety of DSL. All xDSL connections use the same ordinary pair of twisted copper wires 
that already carry phone calls among homes and businesses. Unlike cable modem connections, 
which broadcast everyone's cable signals to everyone on a cable hub, xDSL is a point-to-point 
connection, unshared with others using the service. 
Signals travel between a coax or RJ-4S connector in 
your PC and an xDSL modem. You do not have to dial 
up an Internet service provider; your Net connection is 
always on.

You can use the same phone line for Internet 
service at the same time it's carrying a voice 
call because the two signals use widely sepa-
rated areas of the frequency spectrum. A split-
ter next to your xDSL modem combines the 
low-frequency voice signals and the higher-fre-
quency data signals.

CHAPTER 25 
HOW PCs CONNECT TO THE INTERNET 
329 
The most common form of xDSL is ADSL. The A stands for 
asynchronous, meaning that more bandwidth, or data-car-
rying capacity, is devoted to data traveling downstream-from 
the Internet to your PC-than to upstream data traveling from 
your PC to the Internet. The reason for the imbalance is that 
upstream traffic tends to be limited to a few words at a time-
a URL, for example-and downstream traffic carrying graph-
ics, multimedia, and shareware program downloads needs the 
extra capacity. 
Kilohertz 
Transmission rates depend on the quality of 
the phone line, the type of equipment it uses, 
the distance from the PC to a phone com-
pany switching office, and the type of xDSL 
being used. 
A splitter on the other end of the line 
breaks the voice and data signals apart 
again, sending voice calls into the plain 
old telephone system (POTS) and 
computer data through high-speed lines 
to the Internet. 
Downstream data moves at about 8Mbps for the most common forms of DSL. That's fast 
enough to transmit Moby Dick in just under six minutes compared to the 14 hours a V. 90 
modem would take. 
Upstream data moves at about 640Kbps. 
VDSL (very high-speed DSL) reaches data transmission speeds as high as 
10-26Mbps downstream, but only within about 4,500 feet of a phone switch. 
ADSL is limited to 18,000 feet from the phone office with downstream 
speeds of 6-8Mbps, upstream 512Kbps. 
G-Lite, or Universal DSL, at the same 18,000 feet, allows only 
1.5Mbps downstream and 512Kbps upstream. G-Lite eliminates the 
need for a splitter and is the industry's proposal for a standard 
modem that can work with any phone lines. 
RADSL (rate adaptive DSL) reaches as far as 21,000 feet but is 
limited to 600Kbps-7Mbps downstream rates and 
128Kbps-1 Mbps upstream.

Internet to Your PC 
Computer data is sent along frequencies that lie 
between the 1 10 6MHz frequency bands carrying 
TV programming over hybrid fiber coaxial 
(HFC) cable. Data is sent as standard Internet 
protocol (IP) packets with error correction and a 
header identifying wh ich subscribers' PCs they are 
destined to reach. The wide bandwidth of fiber 
optics, depending on the configuration, lets you 
receive downloads at up to 40Mbps, fast enough to 
download Moby Dick in about one minute, com-
pared to six minutes for a DSL connection and 14 
hours with a V.90 modem. 
Slow servers within the Web with only a 
TV Progtlll1ming 
1 .5Mbps Tl connection can act as bottle-
necks, not allowing your cable connection 
to reach its full potential. A cable supplier 
might cache popular Web pages on its 
own servers to avoid bottlenecks in the 
Internet itself. 
Data going upstream-from your PC to the 
Internet-gets only seven bands for transmis-
sion, limiting upstream data to 30Mbps or 
lower. 
[) High-speed fiber optic cable links each distribu-
tion hub to the cable supplier's own network, 
which handles email and routes PC data to the 
Internet through a 45Mbps T3 connection. The 
cable network is flexible so that if one part of it 
crashes, your data is routed through working 
sections of the network.

Cable is a broadcast medium. Everyone 
connected to the same distribution hub

CHAPTER How the Internet 
Moves Data 

CHAPTER 26 
HOW THE INTERNET MOVES DATA 
WHAT'S amazing about the Internet is not that it ties together the entire world into one giant con-
glomeration of civilization's accumulated data, but that your mom got the email you sent her yesterday. 
Even the simplest communication over the Net is broken up into scores of discrete packages of data. 
Those packages are sent over thousands of miles of telephone lines, satellite signals, and microwaves-
and all the packages in a single communication might not be sent over the same path. Along the way, 
they pass through systems running operating systems as diverse as UNIX, NetWare, Windows, and 
AppleTalk, through PCs, mainframes, and minicomputers-hardware and software that were never 
designed, really, to work peacefully with one another. Messages are coded and decoded, compressed 
and decompressed, translated and retranslated, bungled and corrected, lost and repeated, shredded 
and stitched back together again, all so many times that it's a miracle anything even resembling 
coherency gets from one place to the other, much less that it gets there filled with gorgeous fonts, musical 
fanfares, eye-popping photos, and dazzling animation. 
Want to make it even more amazing? Consider this: No one's in charge! No one owns the Internet. 
Oh, people and companies own bits and pieces of it, and there are some organizations that by common 
consent rule over things such as the domain names that appear in addresses, such as www.quepublish-
ing.com, www.whitehouse.gov, www.ucla.edu, and www.howcomputerswork.net. But their rule is 
entirely at the whim of the governed. There's no technological reason why someone couldn't start a spe-
cialized Net service-and in fact that's exactly what America Online, CompuServe, Microsoft Network, 
and Prodigy are, except that they're more than just themselves, because they are also portals to the 
whole of the Internet. There is, however, one good reason why someone would not start another, com-
pletely separate Internet-it'd be stupid. The thing that makes the Internet the Internet is its universal 
receptiveness. It's open to anyone with access to a computer and a connection. It includes more informa-
tion, and misinformation, than you will learn in your lifetime. 
The Internet is built on cooperation. The illustrations in this chapter show how complex Internet com-
munications are and how the technical challenges they present are overcome. The illustrations don't 
show an important element: the people behind these languages, routers, protocols, and contraptions that 
all cooperate to make sure you can send a dancing, singing email to Mom on her birthday.

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
How Networks Talk with 
Each Other 
For a message, file, or any other data to 
travel through a network, it must pass 
through several layers, all designed to 
make sure the data gets 
through intact and 
accurate. The first 
layer, the applica-
tion layer, is the 
only part of the 
process a user 
sees, and even 
then the user 
doesn't see most 
of the work the 
application 
does to prepare 
a message for sending 
over a network. The layer 
converts a message's 
data into bits and 
attaches a header identifying the 
sending and receiving computers. 
The presentation layer translates the message into a lan-
guage that the receiving computer can understand (often 
ASCII, a way of encoding text as bits). This layer also 
compresses and perhaps encrypts the data. It adds 
another header specifying the language as well as the 
compression and encryption schemes. 
The session layer opens communications. It sets boundaries (called brackets) for 
the beginning and end of the message and establishes whether the message will 
be sent half duplex, with each computer taking turns sending and receiving, 
or full duplex, with both computers sending and receiving at the same time. 
The details of these decisions are placed into a session header. 
The transport layer pro-
tects the data being sent. It 
subdivides the data into 
segments and creates 
checksum tests- mathe-
matical sums based on the 
contents of data-that can 
be used later to determine 
whether the data was 
scrambled. It also makes 
backup copies of the data. 
The transport header i 
dentifies each 
segment's 
checksum and 
its position in 
the 
message.

The physical layer encodes the packets into the medium that will 
carry them-such as an analog signal, if the message is going 
across a telephone line-and sends the packets along that medium. 
At the receiving node, the layered process that 
sent the message on its way is reversed. The 
physical layer reconverts the message into 
bits. The data-link layer recalculates the check-
sum, confirms arrival, and logs in the packets. 
The network layer recounts incoming packets 
for security. The transport layer recalculates 
the checksum and reassembles the message 
segments. The session layer holds the parts of 
the message until it is complete and sends it to 
the next layer. The presentation layer decrypts, 
expands, and translates the message. The 
application layer identifies the recipient, con-
verts the bits into readable characters, and 
directs the data to the correct application. 
An intermediate node calculates 
and verifies the checksum for 
each packet. A router might also 
reroute the message to avoid 
congestion on the network. 
....... 
, 
The data-link layer supervises 
the transmission. It confirms the 
checksum, and then addresses and 
duplicates the packets. This layer 
keeps a copy of each packet until 
it receives confirmation from the 
next point along the route that the 
packet has arrived undamaged.

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
CHAPTER How We Reach 
Each Other 
Through the Net 
'POPDNC'II 
'~, .. 

CHAPTER 27 HOW WE REACH EACH OTHER THROUGH THE NET 
ELECTRONIC mail is everywhere. Many people in business, government, and education now use 
email more than the telephone to communicate with their colleagues. And in their private lives, many use 
email as an inexpensive but quick method of keeping in touch with friends and family scattered around the 
world. 
Although electronic mail has been around since the formative years of the Internet, email first achieved 
mass popularity on local area networks. LAN-based email systems allow people in an office or campus to 
resolve problems without holding meetings, and to communicate with others without the dreariness of for-
mal hard-copy memos. Today, the proprietary email systems of LANs are being replaced by email client 
software and server software used on the public Internet, creating popular, broad-based standards 
that make email easier for everyone. 
Internet email uses two main standards: the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, or SMTP, to send 
messages, and the Post Office Protocol, or POP, to receive messages. Because these standards are 
universal, the software sending and receiving email, as well as the servers that handle the messages, can 
run on a variety of normally incompatible computers and operating systems. 
The country's largest Internet service provider, America Online, doesn't use SMTP or POP, but instead 
uses its own proprietary protocols to send and receive email. The reason users of AOL can communicate 
with people outside AOL is that America Online uses gateway software that translates between different 
email protocols. 
The body of an email message is where you type your note. But email has moved beyond mere words 
to encompass the capability to enclose complex document files, graphics, sound, and video. You can add 
these types of data to the body of a message by enclosing or attaching a file. When you enclose a file, 
your email software encodes it, turning all the multimedia data into ASCII text. At the receiving end, the 
user's software turns this ASCII gibberish back into meaningful data-if the software at both the user and 
the sender ends uses the same encoding scheme. The most popular of these is MIME, the multipurpose 
Internet mail extensions. MIME doesn't care what type of data is being enclosed with a message. 
Another set of email standards can be seen as a great enabler of communication or an annoying 
source of inundating junk email-spam. Electronic mailing lists automatically send messages to a large 
number of users, either on a one-time basis or on a regular schedule. A mail reflector is server software 
that distributes mail to members of a mailing list. With a list server, individuals send email messages to 
subscribe and unsubscribe to the mailing list just as one would subscribe to a newsletter or magazine.

Unless you live in Canada, where the supreme court ruled that people 
cannot be sued for downloading songs and movies, you're violating 
the law if you download copyrighted material, regardless of the meth-
ods. BitTorrent enthusiasts don't argue that point as much as they 
argue that BitTorrent has plenty of perfectly legal uses distributing pub-
lic domain material and works created using common copywrite. And 
then, with its vagabond ways, BitTorrent makes it less likely for you to 
be nabbed with an illicit copy of the Transformers movie rolling onto 
your hard drive. BitTorrent transfers tend to be hit-and-run violations, 
making it harder to determine who's involved than it was in the 
Napster heyday when servers operated 24-7 with hard drives that 
brimmed over with goodies for the downloading. With the introduc-
tion of trackerless trackers, it becomes even harder to catch someone 
in the act. Not that it's impossible. The entertainment industry has suc-
cessfully sued to close down BitTorrent sites that specialized in main-
taining databases of other sites where songs and movies could be 
bittorn. At least one person, in Hong Kong, has been jailed. So the 
question is, are you feeling lucky? Well, are you?

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
How Chal Rooms 
Throw a Party 
El 
Computers make it hard to be a hermit. At this very moment, 
there are hundreds of thousands of computer users engaged in 
friendly chats over the Internet. Chats are held in a chat 
room, a virtual room that's really software running on an 
Internet server. The chat software is designed to let several 
computer users, all online at the same time, type messages 
that are seen simultaneously by all the other chatters. 
To join a chat, you must first run a chat client software 
on your computer. Client programs work over a net-
work with a host program running on a hefty-sized 
server. The installation, performed by the server soft-
ware, is barely noticeable. The chat client shown 
here is for Yahoo!, at chat.yahoo.com . 
The first time you use a 
chat program, you set up 
a screen name, or 
handle, for yourself. 
Traditionally, chatters pick 
a name that's edgy. We'll 
go with Tabascorow. 
After you log in under 
your screen name, you 
choose which chat room 
you want to enter. At the 
same time, thousands of 
other people are also 
signing on to the same 
server. Most of them head 
for a chat room devoted 
to a particular subject, 
such as computer games 
or politics. 

CHAPTER 27 HOW WE REACH EACH OTHER THROUGH THE NET 
347 
When you make your choice, the chat server associates 
you with the path you took to it so that it will recognize any 
other messages from you. Then it adds your screen name 
to a list of other people who are already in the room. 
Finally, it sends a line of text that appears 
on the screens of everyone in the chat 
room announcing that Tabascorow has 
joined the room . 
Now anything you type is 
sent to the chat server. 
The server adds your 
screen name to the words 
you typed so others will 
know who's " talking," 
and sends them out to the 
computers of everyone in 
that chat room . 
They see everything you 
write, and you see every-
thing everyone else writes. 
It can get confusing, espe-
cially in a crowded room. 
Most chat software lets you 
give your message a dis-
tinctive typeface, size and 
color that make it easier for 
everyone to follow conver-
sation threads.

How Instant Messaging 
Leis You Pass Noles 
El 
While chat rooms are for public use, you need to use instant 
messaging software for a private conversation. It lets you and 
selected friends write messages that appear instantly on the 
screen of the person receiving it. 
To use Instant messaging, you must first sign up with one of the 
free instant messaging service, such as AOL Instant Messenger 
(AIM), MSN Messenger, or Yahoo! Messenger. Choose the 
one used by the people you want to be in instant contact with. 
With the messaging service's software, you create a 
buddy list of your contacts, using online pseudonyms 
called handles. The list is like the bouncer at an elite 
night club. If a name isn't on your buddy list, its mes-
sages never appear on your Pc. 
Chatters 
Menu ~ EmQtions ~ 
Once installed, whenever you log onto the 
message service, the software running on 
your computer sends both your handle and 
buddy list to a central 
computer, a messag-
ing server that takes 
care of thousands of 
users simultaneously. 

CHAPTER 27 HOW WE REACH EACH OTHER THROUGH THE NET 
349 
The message server adds your name to a list of 
people who are online. It also compares your 
buddy list with the handles of people online, 
and sends a message to let you know who's 
available for instant messaging. 
Hands-on 
AOL instant messaging can't exchange notes with Yahoo! 
messaging or with MSN. If you use AOL but a friend 
uses MSN, the two of you ordinarily can't swap mes-
sages. However, programs such as Trillian work with any 
of the major messaging services. You still have to register 
with your friend's service, but you communicate with all 
your buddies, and Trillian does the necessary translations 
to make it seem as though you were all using the same 
service.

When you pick a name from that list, a small window 
opens up where you can type a short message. When 
you click on send, the message is sent to the messag-

On the buddy's computer screen, a window opens to

( H A PT E R How Wireless 
Sets PCs Free 

CHAPTER 28 
HOW WIRELESS SET pes FREE 
WIRELESS was once a quaint term we encountered in British WWII movies in which Britons would hud-
dle around massive radios. Only they called it the "wireless" because the leading-edge technology of radios 
was that, unlike telephones and telegraphs of its day, a radio received music, news, and entertainment with-
out being connected to anything but an electrical outlet. 
Today, wireless has a new meaning. Radio's offspring, television, has become increasingly wired as 
broadcasters learn how to pump more broadcasting over a cable connection than they could over the air-
waves. For a while-maybe a couple of years in the 90s-someone who was in the in crowd technologically 
was said to be "wired." The more wires-cable, DSL, T1 Internet connections, piped-in music channels, voice 
lines, fax lines-you had leading to your desk was a sign of how connected you were to the world's hustle 
and bustle. 
Forget it. Now, having a jumble of wires creating some electrical monster's nest beneath your desk is the 
mark of someone who is no longer on the bleeding edge. The freedom of wirelessness has become an impor-
tant issue as people are increasingly on the go and can't be tied to a desk or even a single address. Even if 
you were willing to put up with the immobility, the rabbit-like multiplication of devices that need to swap infor-
mation with each other is increasing to the point that stretching wires among them all would be impossible. 
Today's technology makes possible wireless devices that were impossible in the old wireless era. Radio 
signals back then had to use a relatively large amount of the spectrum of radio waves that could carry a sig-
nal a long distance. Now, engineers have devised ways of packing more information into the same band-
width and ways to let several devices use the same airwaves at the same time without jumbling everything. 
New, too, are the devices that don't require the power to broadcast over vast distances, as radio and TV 
originally had to do. Today, your laptop needs to talk to that printer in the corner. Your cell phone and pagers 
are, at least in the cities, within range of smaller, less encompassing radio-wave transmitters and receivers. 
And wirelessness is coming to devices we didn't conceive of a decade ago: Refrigerators wirelessly send 
automatic grocery lists to pes; keyboard, mice, and game controllers are shedding their tethers. WiFi radio 
connections are creating hot spots in cities around the world where anyone with a laptop can wirelessly 
plug into the Internet. Look at anything with wires running out of it; Soon-probably within the next decade-
those wires will be as quaint and antique as a telegraph key. 
In this chapter, we'll lead off with the device that started the current wireless mania-the cell phone-and 
how WiFi and cell phones are now giving us ubiquitous access to the Internet. We'll also touch on how a 
technology with the unlikely name of Bluetooth is going to make devices in the home and office smarter and 
more communicative, with you and with each other. And it's all done without wires.

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
How Wi-Fi Spreads the Net 
Everywhere 
Any of the varieties of IEEE 802 .1 1 wireless networks begins with an access 
point, or AP, a network node connected directly to a wired local area network 
or to the Internet. An AP also includes a radio transmitter and receiver operating 
in either the 2.4GHz radio band ar the 5GHz range. (See box for the distinguish. 
ing characteristics of the three popular 802.1 1 flavors.) The access point might 
also provide ordinary RJ45 Ethernet jacks for connecting nearby nodes via cable. 
The other wireless nodes, called stations, each 
have a transmitter/receiver working in a match· 
ing bandwidth. A desktop PC uses an antenna· 
equipped expansion card or a USB antenna 
attachment. Notebook computers use a PC Card, 
USB attachment, ar have the radio components 
built into the notebook . 
If an access point within that range picks up the probe request, 
the AP broadcasts an acknowledgment, and the two go through 
whatever security or payment arrangements the network has set 
up. They also establish any settings needed so the 
notebook can talk with the rest of the network. If 
two APs reply to the probe, the notebook will 
use whichever has the stronger signal.

versions. 
Currently there are three forms of the 802.1 1 standard proposed by the 
IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) for wireless network-
ing: 802.1 1 b, which came, strangely enough, before 802.1 1 a, with the 
next proposal skipping to 802.11 g. Each standard has advantages, but 
802.1 1 g has the speed, compatibility, and range to replace 802.1 1 bas 
the most common configuration of Wi-Fi. Above are their pros and cons. 
When a notebook, for example, connects to the 
network, it broadcasts a probe request identi· 
fying itself and asking if any other 802.11 
devices are within range. That range covers a 
25·foot to 150·foot radius. The range is a factor 
of the frequencies, transmitter signal strengths, 
and the sensitivity of the receivers. Lower frequen· 
cies travel farther than higher frequencies.

Many access points are also routers, dividing Internet 
access among several stations on the wireless local area 
network (WLAN). The Internet sees the entire WLAN as a 
single Internet address, such as 207.8.157.204. It's called 
an IP (Internet protocol) address, and it's how comput-
ers see the Internet addresses that we see as words, such as

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
CHAPTER 
How the Net 
Provides Video 
and Audio on 
Demand 

CHAPTER 29 
HOW THE NET PROVIDES VIDEO AND AUDIO ON DEMAND 
TODAY you use the World Wide Web to listen to Mozart and watch Super Bowl highlights, but the 
Internet began as a text-only medium. In fact, the Internet was a multimedia late-bloomer compared to 
personal computers. That's because the problem of how to handle the necessarily huge amounts of 
data involved in graphics, audio, and videos was easier to solve on the desktop than on the Internet. 
Conveniently, there's a name for the problem: bandwidth. The term is used to describe how much 
data you can push across a network, a computer bus, or any of the many other data pathways that let 
components work with the same information. The wider the bandwidth, the better. 
The Internet's bandwidth is growing at rates unimagined only a few years ago. The move toward 
cable and DSL as the connections of choice to the Net means that the Internet is losing a reputation for 
jerky, small video and tin-can audio. The tricks used today to overcome the narrow bandwidth of tradi-
tional modems, described in this chapter, will soon be only of historical interest. If your home doesn't 
yet have multiple PCs, it probably will eventually, and at least one of them is destined to become your 
television, radio, stereo, and telephone-it'll blend into one universal source of information and commu-
nication. 
The first audio and video on the Internet were short clips because a computer had to download 
them completely to its hard drive before it could play them. A newer technology called streaming 
extends the length of a multimedia clip from seconds to hours. Streaming, used with a variety of players 
and audio/video formats, enables your PC to play the file as soon as the first bytes arrive, instead of 
forcing the PC to wait for an entire multimedia file to finish downloading. 
Streaming doesn't send files as other files are sent on the Internet; that is, it doesn't use the same 
protocol. A protocol is the rules governing how two computers connect to each other-how they 
break up data into packets and synchronize sending them back and forth. Instead of the 
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) used to track most Internet transactions, streaming calls on 
the User Database Protocol (UDP). The crucial difference between the two protocols is how they 
check for errors. If you're downloading a hot new game off the Internet and a passing electrical inter-
ference garbles one packet, TCP suspends the download while it asks the sending computer to resend 
the bad packet. But with audio and video, if you miss a frame or word here or there, the loss isn't cru-
cial. You might not even notice it. But you would notice if the protocol took the extra time to enforce the 
retransmission. That's why UDP lets the connection lose occasional packets without fussing. 
Because of streaming technology, you can listen to a live concert located across the country, select 
from an archive of interviews with celebrities and scholars, or take a video call from beyond an ocean. 
Streaming technology proves that audio and video are more than fancy ways to dress up a Web page. 
They add immediacy to Internet communications.

browser contacts the web server hold-
ing the current web page.

Listen to this 
now 
The server sends your browser a small file 
called a metafile. The metafile indicates 
where your browser can find the sound 
file, which doesn't have to be located on 
the first server. Your PC also gets instruc-
tions on how to play that type of audio. 
Audio Player 
The metafile tells the web browser to launch 
the appropriate audio player. The players 
are plug-ins, mini-programs designed to 
work with a particular browser such as 
Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet 
Explorer. Plug-ins let software developers 
who don't work for Mozilla or Microsoft 
write code to expand the browser's capa-
bilities. If you have not previously set 
up a particular plug-in, you 
might have to download 
and install it before 
continuing. 
When the buffer 
fills up, the 
audio player 
starts to 
process the file 
through your 
sound card, 
turning file 
data into 
0001110 
1 011 00 1011 
1001001101001100 1011 
voices, music, and sounds while the server continues to send the rest of the audio file. 
This process can continue for several hours. The buffer can temporarily empty if it doesn't 
receive enough data to replenish it. This happens if you access another web page, if you 
have a poor connection, or if Internet traffic is heavy. If the buffer empties, the audio 
replay pauses for a few seconds until your PC accumulates enough data to resume play-
ing. If the sound source is live, the player will skip portions of the audio program. If the 
sound source is prerecorded, the player will continue from the point it stopped. 
When the packets arrive 
at your PC, your system 
decompresses and 
decodes them and sends 
the results to a buffer, a 
small portion of RAM that 
holds a few seconds of 
sound.

Based on the speed of your connection, the audio server chooses one of several versions of 
the audio file. It sends higher-quality sound, which requires a wider bandwidth, over faster 
links, and lower-quality sound over slower connections. The server sends the audio files to 
the PC as a series of packets in User Database Protocol (UDP), which permits the 
occasional packet to get lost without critically disrupting the transmission. 

364 
HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
How a PC Displays Streaming Video 
Inside the computer that acts as a server for Internet video, a video cap-
ture expansion card receives the ordinary analog video signal from its 
source, either a live feed or recorded tape. The capture board turns the 
analog signal into digital information at a rate of 30 frames a second. 
Interframe com-
pression compares 
adjacent frames and 
transmits only those pixels 
that change from one to the 
other. When the camera is 
still, the background is not 
transmitted after a key 
frame has established what 
the background looks like. 
When the camera pans, 
causing the background to 
change, the entire frame is 
transmitted, creating another 
key frame. Thus, a still cam-
era generally creates less 
data to transmit than a cam-
era that is always moving. 
Codecs also skip frames for 
slower Internet links. The faster 
your connection, the more 
frames you receive and the 
smoother the video is. 
Key Frame 
The capture board sends the digital information 
through a codec, a compression/ decom-
pression algorithm. Different codecs use sev-
eral methods to compress the video.

CHAPTER 29 
HOW THE NET PROVIDES VIDEO AND AUDIO ON DEMAND 
365 
The server breaks up compressed video into one of two types of packets for two types of transmis-
sion protocols. One type is called IP (Internet provider) multicast packets. IP multicast uses 
less bandwidth, which is helpful when transmitting the same video to several people at different 
PCs. The video server sends a single signal to a computer acting as a multicast server, which 
duplicates the video signal for all client PCs attached to it. 
The other protocol is User Database Protocol (UDP), discussed in the 
previous illustration. UDP video delivery is more common because it 
doesn't require special network hardware, such as a multicast server. UDP 
packets must be sent to every client PC, which uses more bandwidth but is 
more efficient in preventing gaps or pauses in the audio part of the signal. 
IUFm 
The PCs receiving the signals decompress the 
video and load it into a small buffer in RAM. 
From there, the signal splits into video and audio 
components, which are sent to the video card 
and sound card. As with pure audio streaming, 
video streams simply skip packets that they can 't 
handle in real time. 
But unlike audio, a corrupted video packet can 
cause a defect that carries over to other frames. 
To correct this, the software compares new 
frames with other ones to detect errors and cor-
rect them by using visual information from an 
untampered frame.

CHAPTER 30 HOW THE WORLD WIDE WEB WORKS 
JUST a few editions ago when I got to this part of the book, I used to compare the World Wide 
Web to a Model A Ford. It got us where we wanted to go in cyberspace, but it was cantankerous 
and slow-slated for better things, to be sure, but some time in the far, far future. And no one today 
could imagine what enormous, pervasive effect the Internet is going ... blah, blah, blah. 
The far future's not as far off as it used to be. In just a few years, the Web has lost most symp-
toms of terminal crankiness. It's turned out to be a bomb for tasks that would have seemed a natural. 
(Ordered any groceries online lately?) And it's fulfilled other promises, but not in the way we 
expected. Previously, I wrote about the Web fulfilling the promise of Gutenberg, with everyone 
becoming a publisher. But I didn't expect them to be called blogs, nor that they would be as popular 
as they've become. Not long ago Web designers were cautioned not to use graphics, music, anima-
tion-anything that would make the Internet cool-because they choked pokey Internet connections. 
Now photos, Flash animations, and streaming video are commonplace. A decade or so ago, a cou-
ple of lawyers became nationally scorned by the pioneers of the Internet because they used the Web 
to advertise their practice-an obvious sacrilege. Today we don't make purchases larger than a 
pack of gum without consulting the Internet's consumer advice, sales, discount codes, and reviews 
by thousands of fellow consumers. 
The Web is changing how we do everything and creating new standards for commerce, educa-
tion, and communication. Want to know how much something is worth? Go to eBay. It's the ultimate 
free market, where the value of anything is quickly determined by a few bids that tell you-in real 
terms, not some economic gobbledygook-the most that anyone in the world would pay for a set of 
2005 Chevy hubs. 
And then there is Google. Someone joked that Google is a god because it is omniscient and 
omnipresent. Religious issues aside, it has changed research, scholarship, and the settlement of bar 
bets around the world. Okay, it might not be a god, but certainly it's an oracle.

A website is a collection of files, documents, and graphics 
that someone has made generally available to others 
through the Internet. One way to begin a jump through 
the cyberspace of the World Wide Web is to click on a 
hyperlink. A hyperlink is a text phrase or graphic that 
conceals the address of a site on the Web. When the 
hyperlink is text, it is underlined and in a different color. 
The text doesn't have to be the actual address. These 
three words could hide a link to my page to supplement 
this book: www.howcomputerswork.net. 
Address http://www.howcomputerswork.net 

CHAPTER 30 HOW THE WORLD WIDE WEB WORKS 
369 
The browser software on 
your PC sends the address 
to a network-either direclly 
through a Tl conneclion to 
a local area network, gener-
ally found in businesses, or 
it might use a modem to 
conneclto a dial-up net-
work. Or, it might use DSL 
or cable lines to conneclto 
an Internet service 
provider (ISP). 
When the site server receives 
the browser's request, it reads 
the origination address in the 
header and returns a signal to 
acknowledge that it has received 
the request. At this point, the 
message in the status line at the 
bottom of your browser's screen 
changes so you know you've 
made a successful conneclion. 
The request itself is put into a 
queue to wait until the server fin-
ishes fulfilling earlier requests. 
Server 
The LAN or Internet provider sends the address to the nearest node of 
the domain name server (DNS). The DNS is a cooperatively run set 
of databases, distributed among servers, that volunteers to be a reposi-
tory for a different kind of address that is also called an IP (this time for 
Internet Protocol). This address is expressed in numbers, as opposed 
to the text of a URl. For example, the IP of www.cdron .comis 
205.1 81 .1 1 2.101 . The two types of addresses exist because 
while computers find it easier to work with numbers, 
humans comprehend words beller. 
The DNS returns to your browser 
the site's IP address. Using the IP, 
the browser sends a request 
through 0 router, which consults 
the most recent report of Internet 
traffic and hands the request 
along a path with the least traffic. 
At each interseclion in the 
Internet, the routing process is 
repeated to avoid traffic jams. 
D The server might send the request 
to a proxy server, where the page aclually 
resides. For example, jumping to www.how-
computerswork.net automatically takes you to a wel-
come page, 
http://www.howcomputerswork.net/index.html. In addition, 
mirror sites-servers that periodically make copies of the 
files on the parent server-help relieve the parent of some of 
the traffic.

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
How a Web Browser 
Displays Pages 
Stored on the server, the Web page 
itself consists of an HTMl text file. 
HTMl is a collection of codes enclosed 
in angle brackets-<>-that control the 
formatting of text in the file.

CHAPTER 30 
HOW THE WORLD WIDE WEB WORKS 
371 
As the different parts of the page arrive at 
your PC, they are stored in a cache, a 
combination staging area and reservoir in 
the computer's RAM. Later, if your 
browser requests the same page or any of 
the elements on the page, such as a 
graphic, the browser retrieves it from the 
cache rather than going back over the 
Internet to the original sources. 
If a non-streaming sound, music, or video file, such as a 
wave, MIDI, or AVI recording, is part of the page, the 
browser waits until all the file has arrived in the cache, 
and then it feeds it to Windows's Media Player, which 
uses your sound card to reproduce the sound. 
Meanwhile, the browser begins using the elements in the cache to reassemble the Web page 
onscreen, following the hidden HTML codes in the main document to determine where to place text, 
graphics, or videos onscreen. Because not all portions of the Web page arrive at your PC at the same 
time, different parts of it appear onscreen before others. Text, which is the simplest element to send, 
usually appears first, followed by still and animated graphics, sounds and music, and videos. 
Icons in the upper-right corners of both 
Netscape Navigator and Microsoft 
Internet Explorer are animated while 
parts of the page are still being 
received. When all elements have 
arrived and have been added 
onscreen, the animations freeze into 
still images, telling you that the 
browser has successfully retrieved the 
entire Web page.

CHAPTER 31 
HOW INTERNET SECURITY FIGHTS OFF PC INVADERS 
WE should be grateful that most computer crackers are grossly egotistical. The very premise of break-
ing into a megacorporation's giant computer, leaving a virus, or substituting a screen of his own scato-
logical design for the company's home page-that's done by someone who wants attention. They 
can't resist leaving a program or note that's a digital sign of Zorro, something to let you know that 
while you might own the computer, the cracker owns its soul. 
I'm using the term cracker here instead of hacker, which most people think of when they hear 
about some teenager who broke into the high school's computer and gave himself a lot of A's. Self-
described hackers break into computer systems out of curiosity or to test their skills, without stealing 
information and without trashing the hacked system. Hackers look down on crackers as immature, 
unsophisticated kiddies. 
Crackers and hackers have one thing in common: Both must have endless patience, a high toler-
ance for delivery pizza, and a dedication to their life's calling that you rarely find outside of a 
monastery. It means starting as a script kiddie, running program scripts written by others that sniff and 
nudge and try to bluff their way past a computer's defenses. The world of hacking is ultra cool and 
ultra exclusive. You will only be admitted-make that tolerated-when you show that you've mastered 
those scripts and even written some of your own. You might take on a monster crack to prove you're 
up to snuff. 
This proving yourself is the undoing of many crackers. It's difficult to do a crack and leave no clues 
behind-if only because the up-and-coming cracker just has to let someone know he did it. The only 
payoff in this game is recognition. The only way you earn it is to have encyclopedic knowledge of net-
work security, including all the holes and back entrances that not even the people running a network 
know about. 
Fortunately, while no system, from a home PC to an Internet-connected corporate supercomputer, is 
truly crack-proof, as a user there are tools at your disposal that help you keep control of your Pc. 
Firewalls and antivirus software are readily available to help you keep control of your PC where it 
belongs-in your hands. 
Still, the next time you tune in to the news and learn about a new virus, a denial-of-service attack 
that overwhelms an organization's incoming lines, or a crash that spreads like a California wildfire, 
remember this: These are the cyber-attacks you don't have to worry about. A really dangerous cracker 
would keep his activities secret, and limit himself to, say, small transfers of money, none so large as to 
attract attention. When the real master cracker comes along, no one will know anything's going on. In 
fact, it could be going on right now, but you'll never really know if he's stopped.

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
How Computer Hackers 
Break Inlo Your PC 
~ 
Unlike in movies, where hackers break into 
a computer in minutes with only a few key-
strokes, hacking deep enough into a com-
puter to take control of it might take days or 
weeks. The computer hacker methodically 
follows a set of procedures that pries open 
a crack wider and wider with each step. 
Casing the Target 
S 
El 
The hacker performs a footprint analy-
sis of the intended target using publicly 
available information, such as its size, 
subsidiaries, and vendors that might have 
access to the target's computers. 
Using readily available hacking software, 
he scans the target computer's ports for 
potential break-in points. Ports are num-
bers used to identify different services the 
computer provides, such as network 
input/output and email. 
Identifying Target Components 
C Based on the analysis, the hacker creates a map of the ports and their relationships to 
each other. He uses this to try to identify the types of file transfer and email the system 
uses by sending random data to the ports. Many port services respond to data with a 
banner that identifies the software that's using the port. The hacker looks up the soft-
ware in online databases that list the software's vulnerabilities. Some ports yield real 
pay dirt in the form of user names and dates that passwords change. 
PORT 34 E-MAIL 
Microsoft Outlook 
Corporate partners 

CHAPTER 31 
HOW INTERNET SECURITY FI 
Obtain Access 
To gain access to the target system, the hacker has two approaches. The 
low-tech method involves contacting employees to trick them into revealing 
their passwords. The hacker might call pretending to be part of the IT help 
staff, claiming that a security malfunction requires the employee to verify 
her password. A daring hacker might visit the offices in person to look for 
passwords employees have taped to their monitors.

COMMON PASSWORDS 
sexy 
... 
funguy 
open sesame 
mypassword 
thisoneworks 
version4 
newpassword 
default 
guestpassword 
password 1 
.,. 
The second method is a brute force attack. The 
hacker uses a hacking program to try to log onto 
the system with the usernames she's acquired. 
When the system asks for a password, the pro-
gram responds with a word from a list of likely 
passwords, such as opensesame or sexy. The pro-
gram repeats the process until the list is exhausted, 
it chances upon the right password, or the host 
locks the user out for too many failed attempts. 
Escalate Privileges 
Doe, Jane 
Doe, John 
Green, Lori 
Jones, Ken 
Smith, Lisa 
Smythe, Tom 
o After the hacker has entered the system with user-level privileges, he looks for passwords 
of higher-level users that grant greater access to the system . Good sources are registry 
keys and email. 
[] Finally, with access to the most secret ranges of the network, 
the hacker uploads innocuous-seeming trojan programs to one 
or more of the computers on the network. These programs 
appear to the human eye or a virus 
scanner to be ordinary, 
harmless files . In actual-
Hacker's computer 
ity, they are programs 
that open a back-
door through 
which the hacker 
may now enter the 
network at will.

How Spyware Reports Everything 
You Do 
~ 
Spyware is a program on 
your hard drive that sends 
information about you 
and how you use a 
PC to marketers 
----=-=----./ 
and advertisers, usually 
....a 
without you being aware it's happen-
ing. Adware is a variant of spyware that dis-
plays advertising for products it thinks might 
interest you based on your website browsing 
habits. 
A web link might launch a spy program to 
your hard drive when you click the link. 
Normally, however, spyware enters your sys-
tem when you download free software such as 
KaZaA and Alexa. Installation of the program 
you wanted also installs the spyware. Antivirus 
software and firewalls do nothing to block spy-
ware installed with a download you ask for. 
El A warning that you have installed a program that col-
lects information from your computer usually appears in a 
Privacy Policy where you found the download or during 
installation. Such fine print is notoriously unread.

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
How Internet Firewalls 
Keep Out Hackers 
Setup 
~ 
Computer owners or network managers place a fire-
wall between their computers and the Internet, either 
by installing firewall software or hardware. Both types 
are designed to block a hacker's attempts to break into 
a computer or network. 
EJ The firewall's manager sets up rules the firewall 
uses to filter out unwanted intrusions from the 
Internet. The wall shuts any nonessential ports a 
hacker might probe for openings. The manager 
might block all inbound traffic except for email or 
data that someone inside the firewall has requested . 
Types of Rules 
El Packet Filtering: Data travels over the Internet 
and into a computer in the form of packets, 
which are small chunks of data, along with infor-
mation about where the data originated and 
where it's bound. The firewall examines each 
packet and if the outbound address of the data is 
on a list of banned Internet locations, such as porn 
sites, the firewall blocks it. Packet filtering is typi-
cally used with small business/home connections. 

CHAPTER 31 
HOW INTERNET SECURITY FIGHTS OFF PC INVADERS 
385 
Proxy: All traffic in or out of the network goes 
through a file server, called a proxy, located 
outside the firewall. The server examines all data 
based on the filtering rules and only forwards 
packets that obey the rules. If a dangerous trans-
mission manages to sneak past the filters, the 
proxy takes the hit to protect the network. 
PACKET INSPECTION 
Stateful Inspection: The firewall compares key parts of each packet to a 
database of known safe data. The packet data must resemble data the fire-
wall has seen before. The wall sends incoming data that passes muster to 
its final destination . Packets that fail the test are discarded by letting subse-
quent data packets write over them. 
Alerts

agai'n, i your S y ,tern. Plea"" view the 
, 'N elD efe",reLog\S "curl l~" D iafog for detailed inform a lio n on Ihe 
atlack.. 
When a firewall detects suspicious activity, 
it sends an alert in the form of a pop-up 
window or email to notify the computer's 
user or the network manager that someone 
might have tried to break in. 
The firewall also adds the intrusion to 
a security log, including information 
about the type of attack and the IP 
address of the computer sending the 
intrusive code. Typically, the firewall 
also saves records of packets that 
have gone in and out of a computer. 
This information can be reported to a 
user's Internet service provider (ISP) or 
to the computer help staff.

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
How Computer Viruses 
Invade Your Computer 
~ 
A virus is created when a programmer intention-
ally infects a program or disk with computer code 
that has the capability to replicate itself, hide, watch 
for a specific event to occur, and deliver a destruc-
tive or prankish payload . 
When the infected program is run, the virus code is 
executed first. The code typically performs four actions: 
Replication: The virus inserts copies of itself into other program files. 
Each descendant of a virus then replicates itself each time its host is read 
by the computer. 
Boot record viruses target the master boot record. -----, 
The computer must read this record to find out 
how the disk is organized before it can get to any 
of the other files. By hiding here, the virus can run 
even before an operating system is loaded. 
PProgram viruses look for executable . 
and .EXE program files. The virus often 
inserts its copy immediately behind the 
program's header, a small section 
of code at the beginning of the file 
that contains information about 
what kind of file it is. This 
ensures that the virus is 
always executed before the 
legitimate portion of the file 
Event watching: t:VI~rv--::== ==::!!;:==: 
time the virus runs, it 
checks for a certain condi-
tion, usually a specific date. 
Whenever the triggering con-
dition exists, the virus delivers its 
destructive payload. If the trigger-
ing event is not present, it does nothing 
but replicate itself. 

CHAPTER 31 
HOW INTERNET SECURITY FIGHTS OFF PC INVADERS 
387 
Camouflage: Stealth viruses disguise themselves to avoid detection by 
antivirus software. The disguises used by a morphing virus consist of nonfunc-
tioning, changing sections of fake code interspersed among working sections 
of the virus. Each time the virus replicates, it creates different fake code to 
break up its identifying signature. (See the facing page for more information 
on signature detection.) The virus might also falsify information in the header 
about the file's length so the program file appears to be the correct size. 
El 
:----------Delivery: When the triggering condition is met, the virus unleashes 
its payload-the operation that is its raison d'etre. The payload might 
be harmless, such as displaying a "you've been had" message. Or, 
the payload can be destructive, erasing or scrambling files or infor-
mation on the drive that tells the operating system how to find files on 
the disk. The most insidious viruses are those that do not announce 
their presence and make subtle changes to files. It could, for example, 
randomly change numbers in an accounting program, steal pass-
words, or introduce delays to make a computer run slower. 
Some viruses copy themselves to memory. 
There, the virus can constantly check for a 
triggering action such as certain keystrokes. 
The memory-resident virus can also 
watch for attempts by antivirus software to 
find infected files and return phony informa-
tion that hides the virus from detection.

An unsuspecting victim receives an email that 
appears to have been sent by someone the victim 
knows, and the subject of the message is worded to 
entice the patsy to open the email, such as "Wild 
EJ Hidden within the email is one of three types of viruses.

vacation.jpg.vbs 
An attachment virus is a program 
attached to an email message. It pretends to 
be a photo or movie the victim can view on 
his computer. The name of the attachment is 
disguised to hide its true nature. For example, 
the attachment could be vacation .jpg .vbs. 
Many users notice the "jpg" and assume it's a 
vacation photo without realizing the "vbs" 
identifies the attachment as a Visual Basic 
script, a type of program. Attachments are the 
most common type of virus. Examples: 
Melissa, Love Letter, and AnnaKournikova. 
El What makes the virus launch its attack 
depends on what type of virus it is. 
The aHachment virus runs only when the 
victim double-clicks the attachment's filename. 
An HTML virus is active content code, 
essentially a small program written in 
JavaScript or ActiveX software lan-
guages. Active content is used on the Web 
whenever you buy something, fill in forms, 
vote in a poll, or take part in any other 
interactive pages on the Web. The HTML 
virus is not displayed when you open a 
message formatted in HTML. Examples: 
Kak worm, BubbleBoy, and HapTime. 
The HTML virus jumps into 
action when the victim opens 
the message to read it. Merely 
displaying the message in the 
preview window also launches 
the virus. 
A MIME (Multi-Purpose Internet 
Mail Extensions) virus takes 
advantage of a security hole in 
Outlook Express and Internet Explorer. 
The perpetrator fills in forms in the 
email's header with more information 
than the header can hold in its 
buffer-memory reserved for the form 
entries. When the buffer runs out of 
room to hold the entry, the 
overflow-the virus-spills into 
stack memory being used by the 
microprocessor to run programs, and 
the virus is executed instead of legiti-
mate code. Example: Nimba.

It] Viruses hidden in email do different kinds of mischief, 
but the first thing any of them does is propagate itself. 
it searches the victim's address book, old email, even 
documents created with Word or Excel. From these, it 
extracts names and email addresses. 
C Eventually, thousands of copies of the original 
virus deliver their payloads, which are any-
thing from taunting messages to erasing hard 
drives. They might dump their payloads right 
after they've finished replicating themselves, 
after so much time has passed, or they might 
all go off at the same time on the same day. 
B The virus uses the addresses to send duplicates of 
itself to the victim's friends and business acquain-
tances, hidden in the same email it rode into the 
computer. To make itself harder to trace, the virus 
might pick a name at random from the address 
book and put that in the From: field. in minutes, 
the virus spreads itself to hundreds of other com-
puters, sometimes accompanied by haphazard 
attachments of letters and spreadsheets the virus 
has found among the victim's files. 
Tricky Viruses 
The VBS.Hard.A@mm virus is an attachment that 
comes on an email message, warning against a 
nonexistent worm called 
VBS.AmericanHistoryXJI@mm. The subject of the mes-
sage is "FW: Symantec Anti-Virus Warning;" the mes-
sage promises more information in the attached 
memo. 
When the attached file, www.symantec.com.vbs.is 
opened, it makes the internet Explorer home page a 
phony website that warns about a fictitious worm. it 
also makes Outlook send copies of the bogus virus 
warning to everyone in the address book. Each 
November 24, infected computers display the some 
message: "Don't look surprisedl It is only a warning 
about your stupidity. Toke corel"

Software 
Fights Back 
The first line of defense against viruses 
is antivirus software that inspects 
the master boot record, program files, 
and macro code for the presence of 
viruses. Signature scanners look at 
the contents of the boot record, pro-
grams, and macros for telltale sections 
of code that match viruses contained in 
a table of all currently known viruses. 
Such tables must be updated regularly 
to be effective against new viruses. 
Because stealth viruses evade detection by 
signature scanners, heuristic detectors 
look for sections of code triggered by time 
or date events, routines to search for 
.COM and .EXE files, and disk writes that 
bypass the operating system.

Memory-resident antivirus software 
installs programs in RAM that continue to 
operate in the background while other 
software applications are running. These 
programs monitor all the computer's 
operations for any action associated with 
viruses, such as downloading files, run-
ning programs directly from an Internet 
site, copying or unzipping files, attempt-
ing to modify program code, or pro-
grams that try to remain in memory after 
they're executed. When they detect sus-
picious operations, the memory-resident 
programs call a halt to operations, dis-
playa warning message, and wait for 
the user's OK before allowing the task to 
continue.

How Spammers Find You 
Public Sources for Spammers 
El 
Not all spammers 
compile their own 
spam lists. Many buy 
lists from others, who 
use a variety of tech-
niques to harvest 
email addresses or 
potential email 
addresses, and then 
sell those lists to the 
highest bidder. 
Spammers send out 
automated spiders 
across the Internet that 
crawl across web 
pages looking for 
email addresses in 
mail:to links or posted 
on the page. The spi-
ders send all the 
addresses back to the 
person compiling the 
spam list. 
Spiders also look 
through Usenet news-
groups for email 
address, and when 
they find them, they 
send the addresses 
back to the spam list 
compiler. 
Other kinds of spi-
ders visit chat 
rooms and grab all 
the email addresses 
of those in the 
rooms.

Harvesting from Email Directories 
A dictionary attack, also called a directory harvest attack, is a 
common technique for harvesting email addresses. It is used to 
harvest email addresses from Internet Service Providers, mail 
services such as Hotmail, and private corporations. In the 
attack, software opens up a connection to a mail server and 
sends millions of delivery attempt requests to email addresses 
on the server, such as timsmith@hotmail.com, tomsmith@hot-
mail.com, tom 1 smith@hotmail.com, and so on .

Because the software is only guessing at the 
addresses, most of the addresses are invalid, 
and the server responds with a Simple Mail 
Transfer Protocol (SMTP) 550 error message, 
which means that the address is not a valid one. 
The Speed at Which Spam Spreads 
Mail server 
When the address being sent is a real 
one, the server responds with a mes-
sage that the address is valid and real. 
The spammer compiles all of these into 
a spam list. Even though a very low 
percent of addresses are valid, if the 
spammer has sent millions of requests, 
they will get tens of thousands, or 
more, of valid email addresses. 
How effective are spammers in harvesting ema il addresses from public locations? According to an investigation by the Federal Trade 
Commission and several law enforcement agencies, they are remarkably efficient. The commission and agencies posted 250 fresh, new 
email addresses in 175 locations on the Internet to see how much spam each received. The addresses were posted on web pages, dating 
services, chat rooms, message boards, Usenet newsgroups, and other locations. In the six weeks after posting, the addresses had 
received 3,349 pieces of spam. Eighty six percent of addresses posted to web pages drew spam, and an equal percent of addresses 
posted on newsgroups drew spam. And chat rooms were possibly the biggest spam magnets of all: One address used in a chat room 
received spam a mere nine minutes after it was first posted.

How Antispam Software 
Sniffs Out Phony Email 
Mail server 
joe _ huckster@ripoff.com 
Blacklists are a common way 
of fighting spam . A blacklist 
is a list of email addresses 
and Internet domains known 
to be spammers. When anti-
spam software comes across 
an address on the blackl ist, 
it flags it as spam. 
There are many types of antispam software. Some reside on a mail server 
and delete spam before it reaches people's PCs. Another common type runs 
inside a person's email program and routes suspected spam to a special 
spam folder, where the mail can be examined and deleted. Most ISPs 
include antispam software, but that in itself isn't enough to stop the deluge of 
spam from reaching people, so most people also run antispam software on 
their PCs.

Antispam software also uses content filtering, in which the software 
examines the body and subject line of an email message and looks 
for specific words that indicate spam. The software contains a data-
base of terms and phrases that spammers often use, such as Viagra. 
So if the software comes across a subject line such as Herbal 
Viagra!, it would consider the message spam. 
A Bayesian filter might be the most powerful antispam technique of 
all. A Bayesian filter analyzes the actual content of a message, com-
pares the content to a database of spam characteristics, and calcu-
lates the probability that the message is spam. All messages above a 
certain threshold are considered spam, and messages below that 
threshold are not considered spam. You can tune the fi lter to change 
the threshold level, depending on whether you want to be more 
aggressive or less aggressive in flagging spam . Being more aggres-
sive means you'll get less spam, but also more false positives, mes-
sages that are not actually spam. Being less aggressive means that 
more spam will get through, but you'll get fewer false positives. When 
you use a Bayesian filter, as you get 
mail, you flag certain messages as 
spam and others as not being 
spam. So the more use you a 
Bayesian fi lter, the more effective 
gail_ mysister@gms.(om 
it becomes 
because 
as you tell it 
what is spam 
and what isn't, it 
adds that information to its database. 
Bayesian filters are more effective than 
content filters that only block email 
with certain words or phrases 
because spammers can easily alter 
the spelling of words. 
Whitelists can be used to tell antis pam soft-
ware that certain addresses are valid, and so 
should always be let through by antispam 
software. Far example, some antispam soft-
ware examines a person's contact list and 
automatically adds all those addresses to a 
whitelist. Additionally, you can add addresses 
to a whitelist, telling the antispam software to 
let certain addresses through . 
Some software uses peer-te-peer technol-
ogy to fight spam. Everyone who uses the 
antispam software flags certain messages 
as spam. This information is sent to a cen-
tral server, which compiles blacklists and 
whitelists. The software on every person's 
computers is then updated by the central 
server. 
What Is Spammerwocky? 
Some spam includes random words and lines of gibberish, such as "inexorable lie stone liver conclude 
grandma trickster." This technique, called spammerwocky, tries to fool spam filters into believing the mes-
sage is not spam. The spammer hopes that the inclusion of random words will not be construed as spam by 
Bayesian filters. But spam-killing software has caught on and includes methods for detecting spammerwocky.

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS 
How Prime Numbers 
Protect Pri 
Secrets 
A person who wants to be sure 
information she exchanges over 
the Internet is not read by oth-
ers and is not a forgery uses 
encryption software to create 
two keys. 
The person then posts the 
product of multiplying 
those keys somewhere it 
can be read by anyone-
a printed or online direc-
tory. That number 
PU 
becomes the public key' 
The software typically 
multiplies two prime 
numbers-numbers 
that can be evenly 
divided only by itself 
and the number 1. The 
software uses up to 128~
bits to record those num-
bers. With that many 
bits, there are a POSSi~

000,000,000,000,000,000,000 different combinations. If, say, bot . of 
those numbers have 75 digits, their product will consist of 150 digits. Those 
two prime numbers become a private key. The person wh0 creates the

Another person who wants t send the first person

tions that Gange data in a way that makes the 
original ocument incomprehensible. A simple 
eX<lmple of an algorithm is "shift one letter to the 
Ight," so that HAL becomes IBM. The key to 
decrypting it would be "shift one letter to left."

Anyone who wants to reverse the algorithm to restore the original message 
must figure out which two prime numbers out of the 3,402,823,669,209,

is no known formula for factoring large numbers

signature is typically created by computing a message digest or hash

mary of the document. The hash value is then encrypted using the private key. 
The recipient of the message uses the sender's public key to decrypt the hash 
values. The recipient runs the document through the same algorithm the 
sender did and, if the document is from whom it claims to be from, the two 
sets of hash values will match. If as little as a comma has been changed, or 
if the sender is impersonating someone else, the hash values won't match.

HOW PRINTERS WORK 
From the earliest days the hands of printers have wielded a great power, the magical power to reproduce words a thousandfold. 
-Helmut Presser 
IN the early days of personal computers, when people thought it was simply a revolution 
rather than a fundamental change in our existence, someone came up with the idea that all this 
computerized data would lead to the "paperless office. " We're entering the second century in 
which we will have been using computers, and more trees than ever are giving their lives to 
produce hard copies of everything from company budgets complete with full-color graphs to 
homemade greeting cards. Not only are we creating more printouts than ever before, but com-
puter printing has turned into a fine art. The very essence of a whole new category of soft-
ware-desktop publishing-is the accomplishment of better and better printed pages. 
Whoever made that erroneous prediction about a paperless office missed an important 
fact. That person was probably thinking about how offices used paper in the age of the type-
writer. Back then there wasn 't much you could put on paper except black letters and numbers-
most often in an efficient but drab typeface called Courier. If all those ugly memos and letters 
had been replaced by electronic mail, the world would not have suffered a great loss. But what 
forecasters didn 't see is that software and printing technology would make possible fast, easy, 
graphic, and colorful hard copies of reports, newsletters, graphs, and, yes, company budgets 
and greeting cards, that even IBM's best Selectric could never come close to producing. 
Speed and ease were the first improvements in printing. Whereas a simple typo on a type-
writer might just be whited out or hand-corrected with a pen, today-because of the speed of 
printers-it's easier just to correct a mistake onscreen and print a fresh, flawless copy. Graphics

were the next big advance. The day of the all-text document ended with the first soft-
ware that could print even the crudest line graph on a dot-matrix printer. Now anything 
that's visual, from line art to a halftone photograph, can be printed on a standard office 
printer. 
Today, color is the current frontier being 
conquered with office printers. The quality and 
speed of color printers is increasing as their 
cost is decreasing. Because they can double 
as black-and-white printers, you can expect to 
see the color printer increasingly the only 
printer in the office and home. 
Paper hasn't disappeared from the office. 
Instead, it's taken on a whole new importance. 
And the lowly printer that used to turn out 
crude approximations of characters is now one 
of the most important components of a com-
puter system. 
We'll start by looking at the dot-matrix 
impact printer. Black-and-white impact printers have been pushed out of the office and 
home markets by cheap, colorful ink-jet printers. With each new edition, I'm tempted to 
take it out of this forward-looking book, but understanding the dot-matrix printer is a 
good foundation for understanding how other, more sophisticated printers work. Other 
printers make their dots without the miniature violence an impact printer commits on a

HOW PRINTERS WORK 
ribbon smeared with soot. But any printer, 
whether dot-matrix, ink-jet, laser, dye sublima-
tion, or solid ink, accomplishes essentially the 
same task: It creates a pattern of dots on a sheet 
of paper. The dots can be sized differently or 
composed of different inks that are transferred to 
the paper by different means, but all the images 
for text and graphics are made up of dots. The 
smaller the dots, the more attractive the printout. 
This is a fundamental change in computer 
printing from all printing that's gone before it 
since Gutenberg. The freedom that Gutenberg's 
movable type brought also created restrictions. 
Printing was done with fully formed characters, 
letters, and numbers. The dot matrix changed 
that. With it, a printer could print anything that 
could be made up of many tiny dots, which as we see today, is anything. It led directly to what 
have become the standards for home and office printing-ink-jets for the home and laser print-
ers for the office. Like an impact dot-matrix printer, they create images with dots. It's just that 
the process is hidden and silent relative to the pounding whine of an impact printer.

KEY CONCEPTS 
Ben Day dots 
The individual dots of ink that 
make up a printed graphic. 
bitmapped font 
Characters created by using 
records of where each and every dot of ink is placed 
in a dot matrix. Sometimes referred to as raster fonts, 
they are most often used in impact and low-end print-
ers. The use of bitmapped fonts is decreasing because 
of the versatility of outline fonts used in Windows. 
CYMK 
Cyan, yellow, magenta, and black (K)-
the four colors most often used in color printing. 
dithering 
A process in which the frequency and 
placement of ink are used to create shades of gray 
and hues of color. 
dot matrix 
The grid of horizontal and vertical 
dots that make up all the possible dots-most often 
as many as 900,000-that could be included in the 
bitmap of a single character. Don't confuse dot 
matrix with impact printers. An ink-jet printer also 
creates bitmapped letters using a matrix. 
DPI 
Dots per inch, the number of ink dots a printer 
lays down in a single row one inch long . The higher 
the dpi, the better the resolution. 
font/typeface 
A typeface is a design for the 
alphabet distinguished by its use of such elements as 
serifs, boldness, and shape. Times Roman, Helvetica,

a particular size and a particular variation, such as 
italic. Courier 12-point bold and Courier 12-point 
italic are different fonts in the Courier typeface family.

of the page on a special drum. Through various 
exchanges of positive and negative static electricity 
charges, a laser printer transfers black, or colored, 
powders from the drum to a sheet of paper.

Multifunction office machines 
provide printer, scanner, copier, and fax machine 
capabilities. They are less expensive than buying 
separate machines and take up less office space. 
Also called "all-in-one" printers. They may use 
either ink-jet or laser printing technology.

Printing Works 

CHAPTER 32 
HOW BLACK-AND-WHITE PRINTING WORKS 
ALL computer printing these days is based on the dot matrix. Whether it's a laser printer going 
through an intricate ballet of movement and time or an ink-jet printer spitting dots of color on paper, the 
printer is limited to producing dots. Thousands of dots on a single page, but still dots. 
Regardless of how the dots are created, there must be a common method for determining where to 
place the dots. The most common schemes are bitmaps and outline fonts. Bitmapped fonts come in pre-
defined sizes and weights. Outline fonts can, on the fly, be scaled and given special attributes, such as 
boldfacing and underlining. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on what 
type of output you want. 
Bitmapped images are the computer's equivalent of Gutenberg's type. Bitmaps generally are lim-
ited to text and are a fast way to produce a printed page that uses only a few type fonts. If the hard 
copy is to include a graphic image in addition to bitmapped text, then, to create the graphic, your soft-
ware must be able to send the printer instructions that it will understand. 
Outline, or vector fonts, are used with a page description language, such as Adobe Postscript or 
Microsoft TrueType, that treats everything on a page-even text-as a graphic. The text and graphics 
used by the software are converted to a series of commands that the printer's page description lan-
guage uses to determine where each dot is to be placed on a page. Page description languages are 
no longer so much slower than matrix printers. Outline fonts are more versatile at producing different 
sizes of type with different attributes or special effects, and they create more attractive results. It is the 
printing triumph of the bit.

Outline fonts, unlike bitmapped fonts, are not limited to specific sizes and attributes of a type-
face. Instead, they consist of mathematical descriptions of each character and punctuation mark 
in a typeface. They are called outline fonts because the outline of a Times Roman 36-point capi-
tal A is proportionally the same as that of a 24-point Times Roman capital A. 
When you issue a print com-
mand from your application 
software using outline fonts, your application sends a series 
of commands the page description language interprets 
through a set of algorithms, or mathematical formulas. The 
algorithms describe the lines and arcs that make up the charac-
ters in a typeface. The algorithms for some typefaces include 
hints, special alterations to the details of the outline if the type is to 
be either extremely big or extremely small. 
Some printers come with a page description language, most com-
monly PostScript or Hewlett-Packard Printer Command Language, 
in firmware-a computer program contained on a microchip. 
The language can translate outline font commands from your PC's 
software into the instructions the printer needs to control where it 
places dots on a sheet of paper. For printers that don't have a 
built-in page description language, Windows printer drivers 
translate the printer language commands into the instructions 
the printer needs. 

CHAPTER 32 
HOW BLACK-AND-WHITE PRINTING WORKS 
409 
--f----t----I-.....;;;;c t 
The commands insert variable values into the formulas to change the size or attributes of the 
outline font. The results are commands to the printer that say, in effect, "Create a horizontal line 
3 points wide, which begins 60 points from the bottom and 20 points to the right." The page 
description language turns on all the bits that fall inside the outline of the letter-unless the font 
includes some special shading effect within the outline. 
-. 
Instead of sending the individual commands for each char-
acter in a document, the page description language sends 
instructions to the printing mechanism that produces the 
page as a whole. Under this scheme, the page essentially is 
one large graphic image that might also happen to contain 
text; text and graphics are treated the same here. Treating a 
page as a graphic rather than as a series of characters gen-
erally makes producing text slower with a page description 
language than with a bitmap.

HOW PRINTERS WORK 
How the First Printers Created Text 
Your PC sends a series of hexadecimal ASCII codes to an impact 
printer, also often referred to as a dot-matrix printer. The 
codes represent characters, punctuation marks, and printer move-
ments such as tabs, carriage returns, line feeds, and form feeds that 
control the position of the print head in relation to the paper. 
The ASCII codes are stored in a buffer, which is a special section of 
the printer's random access memory (RAM) . Because it usually takes 
longer for an impact printer to print characters than it takes a PC and 
software to send those characters to the printer, the buffer helps free 
up the PC to perform other functions during printing. When the buffer 
gets full , the printer sends an XOFF control code to the computer to 
tell it to suspend its stream of data. When the buffer frees up space 
by sending some of the characters to its processor, the printer sends 
an XON code to the PC, which resumes sending data.

tt~------------------------------- 41h=A 
.... Among other codes are commands that tell the printer to use a certain 
42h= B 
font's bitmap table, which is contained in the printer's read-only 
43h=C 
memory chips. That table tells the printer the pattern of dots that it 
should use to create the characters represented by the ASCII codes. 
The printer's processor takes the information, which the bitmap table 
provides, for an entire line of type and calculates the most efficient 
path for the print head to travel. Some lines might be printed from 
right to left. The processor sends the signals that fire the pins in the 
print head, and it also controls the movements of the print head and 
platen.

Electrical signals from the processor are 
amplified and travel to some of the cir-
cuits that lead to the print head. The 
print head contains 9 or 24 wires, 
called printing pins, that are aligned 
in one or two straight lines. One end of 
each of the pins is matched to an indi-
vidual solenoid, or electromagnet. The 
current from the processor activates the 
solenoid, which creates a magnetic 
field that repels a magnet on the end of 
the pin, causing the pin to race toward 
the paper. 
The moving pin strikes a ribbon that is 
coated with ink. The force of the 
impact transfers ink to the paper on the 
other side of the ribbon. After the pin 
fires, a spring pulls it back to its origi-
nal position. The print head continues 
firing different combinations of print 
wires as it moves across the page so 
that all characters are made up of vari-
ous vertical dot patterns. Some printers 
improve print quality or create bold-
face by moving the print head through 
a second pass over the same line of 
type to print a second set of dots that 
are offset slightly from the first set. 

In this description, the electrical charges in all instances 
can be reversed and the result would be much the 
same. The method described here is true of most print-
ers that use the Canon print engine, such as Hewlett-
Packard models, which are the standard among laser 
printers. This approach is called write-black because 
every dot etched on the printer drum by the laser beam 
marks a place that will be black on the printout. There 
is, however, an alternative way that a laser printer can 
work, and that way produces noticeably different 
results. The other method, used by Ricoh print engines, 
is called write-white because everywhere the laser 
beam strikes, it creates a charge the same as that of the 
toner-the toner is attracted to the areas not affected by 
the beam of light. Write-white printers generally pro-
duce darker black areas, and write-black printers gener-
ally produce finer details.

CHAPTER How Color 
Printing Works 

CHAPTER 33 
HOW (OLOR PRINTING WORKS 
THERE were two revolutions in computer printing in the twentieth century. One was the laser printer, 
which brings typeset-quality printing of text and graphics to the masses. The second was the development of 
inexpensive, fast, high-quality color printing. 
The complexity of color printing, of course, means trade-offs. At the low-price end is the color ink-jet 
printer. It is in some ways a dot-matrix printer without the impact and with four times the colors. A color inkjet 
costs barely more than a black-and-white ink-jet. The visual detail approaches that of laser printers, in some 
printers surpassing it. But ink-jet technology is relatively slow, and you always have to fuss with cleaning and 
replacing the ink-filled print heads. Color ink-jets are the ideal printer for the home, where printing volume is 
small, a budget might be nonexistent, and the flash of color in a school report or a greeting card is worth the 
extra wait. 
For the office, there are different color-printing solutions that match the budget of a small business or 
home office and solutions that give the most fussy graphic artists the speed, color-matching, and details they 
need to create professional results. The crucial difference among color printers is how they get ink on the 
paper. Because it involves four colors of ink to achieve full color printing, a printer must either make multiple 
passes over the same sheet of paper-as happens with some laser and thermal wax color printers---or it 
must manage to transfer all the colors more or less simultaneously, which is what happens with ink-jet, solid-
ink, and other laser printers. 
A common office color-printing device is the color thermal printer, which uses heat to transfer colored 
waxes from a wide ribbon to paper. The process provides vivid colors because the inks it uses don't bleed 
into each other or soak into specially coated paper. But its four-pass method is slow and wastes ink. The 
color laser printer provides the most precise detail, but is expensive because it requires four separate 
print engines that must each take their turn to apply colored toner to the page. 
Two other color printing methods provide speed and photographic dazzle: dye-sublimation-also 
called dye diHusion thermal transfer (D2T2)-and solid-ink. By controlling not only how many dots 
of color they put on the page but the intensity of the dots, they produce continuous-tone printing. The result is 
virtually indistinguishable from a color photograph, even though its actual resolution might be no more than 
the 300 dots per inch of the old laser printer. 
In this chapter, we'll look at how color printing tricks the eye into seeing hues and shades that aren't 
really there, and how ink-jet, photo, color laser, and solid-ink color printers work.

HOW PRINTERS WORK 
How Printed Colors are Created 
El 
All color is made up of different combinations of light. We see all the wavelengths that make white 
when we pass white light through a prism, breaking it into the spectrum. Although the spectrum is a 
continuous blending of colors, using only a few of those hues are necessary to produce color print-
ing. Different mixtures of those primary colors re-create virtually any color from the spectrum by either 
adding colors or subtracting them. 
Additive color is used to create colors on televisions, computer monitors, and in 
movies. Three colors-red, green, and blue-are emitted to produce all other col-
ors and white by adding various intensities of those primaries. Each time a color is 
added, it increases the number of colors the eye sees. If red, green, and blue are 
all added at their most saturated shades, the result is white. 
Subtractive color is the process used when light is reflected from colored pigments-rather than emitted as in 
additive color. Each added color absorbs (subtracts) more of the shades of the spectrum that makes up white light. 
All colors reflected 
No colors reflected 
Red only reflected 
Red and blue reflected 
Color printing uses four pigments: cyan 
(blue-green), yellow, magenta (purple-
red), and black. This system is called 
CYMK. (K stands for black.) Some low-
end color ink-jet printers save the cost of 
a black-ink print head by using equal 
portions of magenta, yellow, and cyan 
to produce black. But the resulting black 
lacks density, which is why better per-
sonal printers include a print head for 
black ink.

CHAPTER 33 
HOW (OLOR PRINTING WORKS 
417 
All color printers use tiny dots of those four inks to create various shades of color on 
the page. Lighter shades are created by leaving dots of unprinted white. Some print-
ers, such as dye-sublimation, control the size of the dots and produce continuous-tone 
images that rival photography. But most printers create dots that are essentially the 
same size no matter how much of a particular color is needed. The most common 
color printers create up to 300 dots of color per inch, for a total of 8 million dots per 
page. Many printers can create about 700 dpi, and a few printers can create up to 
1,440 dpi. 
For all shades beyond the 
are produced by overlaying the primaries, the printer generates a varied pattern of dif-
ferently colored dots. For example, the printer uses a combination of one magenta dot to two of cyan to produce a deep 
purple. For most shades of color, the dots of ink are not printed on top of each other. Instead, they are offset slightly, a 
process called dithering. The eye accommodatingly blends the dots to form the desired shade as it hides the jagged 
edges, or jaggies, that the dots produce. Dithering can produce nearly 17 million colors. 
Uncoated 
paper 
~ 
The type of paper used in color printing affects the quality of 
the hard copy. Uncoated paper, the type used with most black-
and-white office machines, has a rough surface that tends to 
scatter the light, reducing the brightness, and it tends to absorb 
ink, which slightly blurs the image. 
Wax 
,/ 
-- Paper 
--------------------------------
Paper coated with a fine varnish or wax takes applications of 
ink more evenly so that the ink dries with a smooth surface that 
reflects more of the light hitting it. The coating also helps pre-
vent the paper from absorbing the ink, producing a sharper 
image.

HOW PRINTERS WORK 
How a Color Ink-iet Printer Works 
An ink-filled print cartridge attached to the ink-jet's print 
head moves sideways across the width of a sheet of paper 
that is fed through the printer below the print head. 
The print head usually contains four ink 
cartridges-one each for magenta (red), 
cyan (blue), yellow, and black. Each 
cartridge is made up of some 50 ink-
filled firing chambers, each attached to 
a nozzle smaller than a human hair. 
El An electrical pulse flows through thin resistors at 
the bottom of all the chambers of all the colors 
that the printer uses to form a small section

Resistor 
When an electrical current flows through a resistor, 
the resistor heats a thin layer of ink at the bottom of 
the chamber to more than 900 degrees Fahrenheit 
for several millionths of a second. The ink boils and 
forms a bubble of vapor. 
Paper 
Droplet 
The droplet overcomes the surface tension of the ink, and the 
pressure of the vapor bubble forces the droplet onto the paper. 
The volume of the ejected ink is about one millionth that of a 
drop of water from an eyedropper. A typical character is 
formed by an array of these drops 20 across and 20 high. 
As the vapor bubble expands, 
it pushes ink through the noz-
zle to form a droplet at the tip 
of the nozzle. 
Ink dot 
As the resistor cools, the bub-
ble collapses. The resulting 
suction pulls fresh ink from the 
attached reservoir into the fir-
ing chamber.

HOW PRINTERS WORK 
How a Photo Printer Works 
Pigment Inks 
~ 
Photo-quality printers often use more colors of ink-the usual 
black, cyan, magenta, and yellow, with the additions of light red, 
light blue, and gray or green. Photo printers use inks that get their col-
ors from either dyes or pigments. Dye inks are slow to dry and fade 
when exposed to light and pollutants, but have a wide gamut-the range of 
color shades they create. Pigment inks are dye-based inks. Pigment inks have dye 
ink's brilliance, 
withstand better the assaults of light and the environment. 
Piezo-Eledric Nozzles 
The use of thousands of piezo-electric nozzles gives 
photo printers greater control over the size of sprayed 
ink drops compared to ink jet nozzles. The back

Varying the amount 
of current sent through the 
piezo changes how much the nozzle wall flexes, 
which determines the amount of ink pulled into 
and shot out of the nozzle. The nozzles create 
drops as small as two picoliters. 
Photo Paper 
~ 
For the highest quality and longest lasting 
images, photo printers use special papers 
made to work with the type of ink the printer 
uses. Ceramic-coated porous papers 
absorb inks quickly, but their ceramic coating 
leaves dyes exposed to light and gases. 
Plastic-coated swellable papers protec-
tively encapsulate particles of dye and pigment 
when the ink seeps into the paper's fibers. 
wall of each nozzle is made of piezo, a crys-
talline substance that bends when electric-
ity passes through it. The wall's bending 
sucks new ink into the nozzle. 
El Current to the nozzle shuts off. The piezo 
flexes back into its normal position, forcing 
a droplet of ink out of the nozzle.
