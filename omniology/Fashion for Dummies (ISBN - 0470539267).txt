About the Authors
Jill Martin: Jill Martin is a fashion expert and three-time Emmy-Nominated 
television personality. Jill appears regularly on NBC’s Today discussing 
everything from the latest trends to how to shop on a budget. She is well-
known for the wildly-popular “Ambush Makeovers.” Jill has done in-depth 
coverage from the Golden Globes and Oscars, conducting celebrity inter­
views and discussing red-carpet fashions. A contributor to US Weekly maga­
zine, the Long Island native can also be seen frequently on Access Hollywood, 
Extra, Entertainment Tonight, and The Insider. A diehard sports fan, Jill is also 
a broadcaster for the New York Knicks, reporting during pregame and post­
game shows and doing celebrity interviews at halftime. She is a graduate of 
the University of Michigan and is currently living in New York City developing 
her own clothing line. To learn more about Jill, check out her Web site (www.
jillmartin.com).
Pierre A. Lehu: Pierre Lehu began as a publicist, working with a wide variety 
of celebrities, and over time broadened his working repertoire to include the 
roles of lecture agent, literary agent, manager, and writer. Having been instru­
mental in launching the meteoric rise of Dr. Ruth Westheimer as a celebrated 
sex therapist, he soon became her “Minister of Communications” and in that 
capacity was co-author on many of her books, including two For Dummies 
titles, Sex For Dummies and Rekindling Romance For Dummies as well as more 
than ten others. He also acted as co-author for Rocky Aoki, the founder of the 
Benihana chain of restaurants, on Sake: Water From Heaven. A double gradu­
ate of NYU (BA and MBA), he resides in Brooklyn with his wife and is the 
father of two.
Dana Ravich: Dana is a fashion stylist and works in the fashion and enter­
tainment industry styling models and celebrities for editorial shoots, 
catalog, advertising, and television. She got her start at Mademoiselle 
magazine in New York and then moved on to E! Entertainment TV and 
the Style Network in Los Angeles, styling the networks’ hosts for every­
thing from E! News Daily to red-carpet Oscar coverage. During her time 
in Los Angeles and then Miami, Dana styled shoots for Glamour; O, The 
Oprah Magazine; In Touch; Us Weekly; People; Fitness; Shape; GQ; and 
Vanity Fair. Her advertising clients have included Coppertone, L’Oreal, 
Olay, Perry Ellis, and MTV. She has also worked closely with and advised 
designers and buyers. A graduate of Columbia University, she is now 
back in New York and continues to work in fashion.

Dedication
We would like to dedicate this book to all the women out there who want to 
look as good as they feel.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
From Jill: I would like to thank Pierre Lehu for asking me to be his partner-
in-crime on this amazing project. It has been quite a journey, and I cannot 
thank you enough for your expertise and kindness . . . you are the consum­
mate professional. 
I would also like to thank Dana Ravich, my collaborator and friend, for your 
invaluable contribution and support. You made this process fun and exciting, 
and your expertise was a perfect fit to sculpting this book. 
To my fabulous mother, father, and brother Jonathan, who always put up 
with my craziness. Thank you for all of your support and for always believing 
in me. I have the best family in the world. I am so, so lucky. And now, I will 
make every family function, I promise! And to Dan Le Batard for teaching me 
the importance of perfect punctuation. 
There are so many other people who contributed to the book who we all 
cannot thank enough: Designer Betsey Johnson and Agatha Szczepaniak 
for letting us shoot our cover at the fabulous Bestey Johnson boutique; 
Photographer George Kalinsky for his expertise and dedication; Rebecca 
Taylor, Angela Cranford, and Avi Gerver for all of their hard work on the 
shoot; Stylist (and co-author) Dana Ravich along with Makeup artist Bella 
Sirugo; Jennifer and Mark Miller for letting us use their amazing jewelry; 
The celebrities and designers who shared their fashion wisdom: Kathie 
Lee Gifford, Hoda Kotb, Tory Burch, Nancy O’Dell, Sara Blakely, Tracy 
Reese, Liz Lange, Cynthia Rowley, Lisa Rinna, Tori Spelling, Tommy Hilfiger, 
Shoshanna Gruss, Selita Ebanks, Beth Stern, Tyson Beckford, and Michelle 
Smith; Allison Ross Levitan, Andrew Waranch, Jill Fritzo, Alison Brod, Steve 
Herz, and Jeff Feldman for their help; Lindsay Sobel for the great introduc­
tion to Pierre; Maury Rogoff for her support; and Amy Rosenblum for always 
being my biggest fan.

From Pierre: This book was born as a result of holding our class reunion at 
Vera Wang’s, so thanks to my Friends Seminary classmates one and all. And 
if it weren’t for Dr. Ruth Westheimer, I wouldn’t have gone to the Today set 
where I saw Jill Martin reporting on fashion, so thank you Dr. Ruth for that 
connection and for everything else we’ve shared during our 28-year long 
adventure. And without Jill’s expertise, dedication, and persistence, this 
book would never have blossomed the way it did, so Jill, thank you, thank 
you, thank you. And one more thanks to Jill for bringing Dana Ravich along 
for the ride as her contributions have been invaluable . . . and, of course, 
thanks to Dana for her hard work.   
To my wife, Joanne Seminara, it’s been thirty plus years of counting our 
blessings, and I can’t thank you enough. And our two most important bless­
ings are our children, Peter and Gabrielle — thanks for all the joy you’ve 
brought us. And Pete, an extra thanks for bringing Melissa on board. And to 
our family members, mine who are gone and whom I miss so much, and to all 
the Seminaras, an extended thanks.
Others who also deserve my thanks for their help and support include 
Merle Frimark, Teresa Jusino, Lindsay Sobel, and Lindsay Weiner. 
And all three of us want to thank everyone at Wiley who’ve made this proj­
ect possible and who’ve been so helpful in pulling the many, many details 
together to make this fabulous book, including Lindsay Lefevere, Tracy Barr 
(we put you through a lot, but it was worth it!), Diane Steele, Alicia South, 
Lauren Bishop (you’re such a talented artist!), PJ Campbell, Melisa Duffy, 
Kathy Nebenhaus, and Stephen Kippur. 
From Dana: Thank you to my most inspirational friend and biggest sup­
porter, Jill Martin. I am so glad you asked me to be a part of this most incred­
ible experience.  And, of course, to Pierre Lehu, thank you for letting me join 
you. It has been truly a joy working with you. I would also like to thank my 
family for their love and unwavering support — Robert, Lucy, Rachel, Lyle, 
Helen, Lou Lou, and Leo.  And to Sarah Hamilton-Bailey, Michelle Jonas, 
Amy Hall Browne, Renannah Weinstein, Jennifer Smith, and Adam Glassman: 
Thank you for all of your support and everything that you have taught me.

Introduction
“I 
don’t know what to wear!” “Do these pants make my butt look big?” 
“Is this outfit too boring for my big date?” Chances are you have had 
one (or all) of these thoughts at some point in your life. (I know I have!) 
Fashion is a topic so many women need help with and don’t know where to 
turn. Many women find navigating through the fashion world difficult. Your 
budget, body type, and personality all play a part in the choices you make 
every morning when you get dressed. But whatever your style, knowing a few 
basic rules can help you whenever you bounce back to that annoying ques­
tion, “What am I going to wear today?” 
Now trust me, I am not going to preach that you should be dressed up, look­
ing like you are heading to a black-tie affair everyday. (I am well aware of how 
hard it is to carry on a full life and try to look good doing it.) So as you read 
through this book, understand that it is not just about what you wear, but 
how you wear it. 
Getting dressed in the morning should be fun. You should open your (soon-to-
be-if-not-already) organized closet and enjoy putting together different combina­
tions. I know, I know . . . figuring out what to wear can be exhausting. But after 
reading this book, you’ll have the tools you need to look stylish for any occasion. 
I want you to learn what works for you and your body type and what makes you 
feel most confident. I truly believe that confidence is your best accessory. 
On NBC’s Today show, Colorist to the Stars Louis Licari and I pluck two lucky 
ladies out of the crowd and give them a complete makeover. These women 
come down to the plaza wanting a change (many of them have either looked 
the same for years or have never developed a style of their own.). In just a 
few hours, hosts Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb bring these women out 
totally transformed. Now, I am not saying that the second you finish read­
ing this book, you’ll become a whole new person. What I can promise is that 
you’ll have a better understanding of what works for you and your body type. 
My mother read this book and called me saying, “I am donating anything that 
is not a 10!” You’ll soon discover what that means, but trust me: To get my 
mother to give anything away takes a small army. 
We have all been through mini-makeovers in our lifetime. Now it’s your turn!

Fashion For Dummies 
About This Book
When I was approached to write a For Dummies book, I said what many of you 
would probably say: “Oh those yellow and black books — I love them!” But then 
I thought, “How could there not be one on fashion?” They have Dummies books 
for just about everything. I read one on golf and my best friend’s husband read 
one on how to use a BlackBerry. But sure enough, no Fashion For Dummies 
existed then. And I was glad, because I really feel that I can help many of you 
who are tired of waking up in the morning and thinking, “I have nothing to wear!”
On NBC’s Today, I appear on fashion segments that cover everything from 
trends to budget shopping. My main goal in every segment is to teach women 
how to look and feel their best. I believe there is a formula to looking and feel­
ing good every day when you leave the house, and over the years, I’ve devel­
oped a few tricks to help you get through your busy day while always looking 
your best. In this book I give you the tools you need to develop your own style. 
I also show you exactly how to orchestrate some of these ideas, so as you go 
through the book, take a close look at the illustrations.
I know how overwhelming a book like this can be, but here’s the story: You 
don’t have to read this book all in one sitting, and you never have to read 
it all the way through if you don’t need or want to. The great thing about 
For Dummies books is that everything is segmented. Look at the Table of 
Contents and decide what you want to focus on. The only thing I ask is that, 
if you’re not going to read this cover to cover, go to Chapter 2 before reading 
anything else and take my style quiz and read about my 10 System to be able 
to really understand how you should approach building your own style. 
Conventions Used in This Book
I am a person who understands everything in numbers. If a friend calls and says 
she’s depressed, I immediately say, “How depressed, 1 to 10?” (10 being the most 
you can be). This is how I communicate, and I use this system in every aspect 
of my life, including what makes it into my closet. Every single piece I own, from 
a sizzling dress to a pair of sweatpants, is a 10. What I mean by that is that par­
ticular piece of clothing is the best it can be. My gray sweatpants are cozy, fit me 
properly, and look cute on me. My black dress hugs me in all the right places, 
does not look faded in any way, and is a classic style that can take me to almost 
any occasion. For a piece of clothing to get into my closet, it needs to meet cer­
tain requirements, and I want you to adopt this process as well. After reading 
this book, there should not be anything hanging around that does not make you 
feel your most fabulous. For that reason, the most important convention in this 
book is my reference to this system. You’ll see that I refer to it often. 
As you read this book, you’ll see I suggest things you should splurge on and 
those you can save on. Price doesn’t interfere with my 10 System. (I have an 

3
 Introduction
H&M dress that’s a 10 and was under $30 — it’s fab!) In addition, don’t get 
overwhelmed thinking you need to go buy everything new. Revamping your 
closet is a process, and the items that are must-haves, most of you already 
have in your closet. 
Other than these things, there are a couple other conventions you need to 
know about: 
	
✓	Italic is used for emphasis and to highlight words or terms that I define.
	
✓	The action part of numbered steps appears in boldfaced text.
	
✓	Web addresses appear in monofont.
What You’re Not to Read
Again, For Dummies books are great because you don’t have to read one 
chapter to understand the next. So if you are very interested in accessories, 
but not in pajamas, you can skip the PJs chapter and focus only on the acces­
sories chapter. (Use the Table of Contents to find the chapters you want; you 
may even discover a different topic you want to explore!) 
As you read, watch for the Technical Stuff icon. This appears beside extra 
information for those who like to delve that much further into a topic. You 
can read these paragraphs if you’re interested but skip if you’re not. Even 
without reading these bits, you can still get all the info you need to under­
stand the topic being discussed. Same goes for the sidebars, the shaded 
boxes. If you see one that doesn’t pique your interest, skip it and move on. 
Foolish Assumptions
I am laughing as I write this because I do not think any of my assumptions are 
foolish! But I have made some assumptions about you:
	
✓	You want your style to reflect your personality, and you want to look 
your best each and every day, but you just don’t know how to do it. 
	
✓	You know what you love about your body and what you dislike about it 
and you want to find out how to accentuate your best parts and camou­
flage the ones you would rather downplay.
	
✓	You’ve got a ton of clothing sitting in the back of your closet that you’ve 
never worn. Many of the pieces still have the tags on them and others are 
in sizes too big or too small, and while you had every intention of wearing 
them when you bought them, now don’t know what to do with them. 
If any of these assumptions fit, you’ve definitely got the right book in your hands.

Fashion For Dummies 
How This Book Is Organized
This book is very organized. Believe me, I’ve gone through it over a million 
times! But even more than this book being organized, you have to be. The 
beginning of your makeover does not start at your favorite boutique with you 
buying out the entire store. Before you whip out that credit card, you need 
to develop your personal style, figure out your body type, and decide what 
styles work for you. After doing this and seeing what you already have in 
your closet, you can then assess what you need. To help you accomplish all 
of these tasks, I’ve arranged this book into parts so that you can easily find 
the information you need. 
Part I: Fashion, Style and You
If you’re like most women, you’re searching every morning looking for that 
perfect outfit. In order to confidently decide what you should and shouldn’t 
wear, you need to know the basics. Trends, developing your own style, and 
figuring out what looks good on you helps you develop the skills you need to 
make getting dressed easier. Sounds good, right? Before you hit your favorite 
store though, read (and reread) this part.
Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment 
Construction, Fabrics, and Color
Even after you read Part I, it’s not time to go shopping. You still have to learn 
about the clothing you are about to buy. Before you start filling up your 
closet, you need to know what goes into making a quality item. This part 
explains how to recognize a well-made garment, how to pair patterns and 
colors, and how a particular piece of clothing goes from being a designer’s 
vision to a must-have in a store near you. 
Part III: Stocking Your Closet without 
Going Crazy or Broke
This book may not come with a winning lottery ticket, but in this part, I 
explain how you can manage your clothing budget so that you’ll come out a 
winner after every shopping expedition.

 Introduction
In addition to managing your budget, I also offer various ways to help you 
begin to build your new, fabulous wardrobe. Should you hire someone to 
help you or would you rather do the research all on your own? This section 
is filled with information that will help you make the best decision for you. 
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion
“What am I going to wear to that?” How many times have you gotten an invita­
tion and asked yourself that question? Without the right information, getting 
ready for a big night out (or big night in) can be stressful. Speaking of stress, 
are you in the camp of never knowing what to wear on those in-between days 
when the seasons change? In this part, I go over how to get ready for anything 
and everything from a day at the office, to a formal event, to a cozy night in.
Part V: Finishing Touches
Getting dressed in the morning isn’t just about the clothing you choose. A 
perfectly wrapped present is nothing without the bow . . . and that is how I 
feel about accessories. One necklace can take your outfit from frumpy to fab­
ulous. In this section, we go through all the different options you can use to 
spice up an otherwise simple look and what works best for your body type.
Speaking of what works best, what you wear underneath your clothing is 
just as important as what you are actually wearing. Underwear, bra straps, 
or pantyhose gone wrong is never a good look. In this section, I give you the 
tricks and tips you need before you even put on a stitch of clothing.
Here’s another essential for all women: fabulous shoes. The heel or flat 
you choose to put on with your favorite outfit can make or break a look, so 
choose wisely! 
Part VI: The Part of Tens
We’ve all been fashion victims at one point or another, but there is a way to 
avoid fashion faux pas. In this part, I go over the most common mistakes and 
how to avoid them. I also show you how you can go from day to night in a 
flash. Most days of the week, I leave the house at 7 a.m. and don’t return until 
after dinnertime. I’ve perfected a number of ways to make your day outfit 
turn into something that works come evening and share ten of them so that 
you’re ready when a spontaneous plan comes your way. This part ends with 
a list of my favorite Web sites where you can get many of your must-haves 
and find helpful fashion information without ever leaving the house.

Icons Used in This Book
As you read through this book, you’ll see icons popping up. Obviously, differ­
ent ones mean different things. I wanted to familiarize you with them so you 
can know what to stop for. Here are the icons you’ll be seeing throughout: 
	
When you see this pop up, check out the accompanying paragraph. You’ll find 
shortcuts, bits of advice, and answers to many questions you may have asked 
yourself while reading that particular topic.  
	
Some of what I have to tell you really needs to be absorbed because I refer 
to it many times throughout the book. If you see this icon, you’ll know to pay 
extra attention.
	
The text accompanying the Fashion Fix icons helps you get out of any fashion 
emergency. These are great tips that you will (and should) remember every 
time you leave the house. Fashion Fixes can save you a lot of headaches and 
help you make it through common fashion disasters. 
	
I use this icon to highlight inexpensive alternatives to pricier items. Even if 
you don’t love exactly what I am suggesting, you can still find helpful sugges­
tions for saving money while building a fabulous wardrobe.
FFP
	
Pantyhose with open-toe shoes! Need I say more? Everyone should read the 
text that appears next to the Fashion Faux Pas icons because I saved these for 
those fashion no-nos I feel very strongly about. These are mistakes that you 
should avoid no matter your age, body type, or personality. 
	
Not everybody cares about the technical stuff, but others find it fascinating. 
For those of you who eat up details like how dresses were made in the 19th 
century and why a woman’s shirt-buttons are opposite a man’s, keep a look 
out for this icon.  
Where to Go from Here
So where do you start? If you’re not planning to read this book cover to cover 
(no offense taken), then start with Chapter 2. That chapter gives you informa­
tion you cannot be without when moving on to other chapters. Also, if you 
feel you need a little guidance, the Table of Contents and Index point you in 
the direction you are looking to go. 
Finding your personal style and building a great wardrobe isn’t brain surgery. 
So have fun! I promise: The new you is only a few pages away! 

Part I
Fashion, Style, 
and You

In this part . . .
Y
ou learned to dress yourself by the time you were, 
say, 5 years old, right? Eventually, you became a 
teen, and shopping for the trends was a must. Now you’re 
all grown up and, as an adult, you’re an expert on what 
does and doesn’t look good, right?
Not necessarily. Before you can confidently judge what 
you should and shouldn’t wear, you need to know the 
basics about fashion, about developing your own style, 
and about your body. You’ll find that information in this 
section. Don’t buy one more stitch of clothing until you 
finish reading this key information.

True elegance and style comes from being confident and feeling comfortable 
in your own skin.
Tory Burch, Fashion Designer
You may have been born naked, but minutes later a nurse wrapped you 
in swaddling (how chic an outfit is that!), and you’ve been wearing 
clothes ever since. While some women have mastered the art of 
fashion and look fabulous all the time, many still struggle to 
figure it all out. If you are one of the women still searching 
for what exactly to wear every day, you’ve come to the 
right place. Whether you’re going to the grocery store 
or heading to a gala, I want you to feel your best at 
all times, no exceptions.
As children, most of us were dressed by our par­
ents. As teenagers, you likely just followed the 
trend du jour. But as adults, the options are end­
less. Because the choices are so vast, how can you 
possibly arrive at your very own style? After all, 
while you may find your one true love after dating less 
than a dozen people, you can fall in love with a dozen 
pairs of shoes in one store alone. Now, the ideal solu­
tion for many people would be to hire a personal shopper 
and leave the decision-making to expert hands. Unfortunately, 
few people can afford that route. So the next best plan is to gain a better 
understanding of how to develop your personal style. This chapter gives you 
all the info you need to begin that journey.

Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
The Real Trendsetters
Literally thousands of fashion designers around the world are busily turning 
out mountains of clothing, and as the media continues to focus more and 
more attention on the fashion industry, hundreds of new designers are trying 
to make their way into the field every year. With so many working fashion 
designers, it’s not surprising that you, the fashion consumer, have a flood of 
new clothing to choose from. If you feel like you’re swimming upstream in 
this tide of satin, leather, and beading, try to take comfort in knowing you’re 
not alone.
While each new fashion season brings out a variety of new styles that make 
you feel like everything in your closet is dated, not every designer has an 
impact on the latest trends. There’s a filtering process between the design­
ers’ creations and the hottest trends that land in your closet. Figure 1-1 
shows a designer outfit and a mass market outfit based on that design.
You may wonder how all those who make the cut seem to know that it’s time 
to raise hemlines or douse the world in plum. You may also wonder what 
role, if any, the buying public has in this process. Getting the answers to 
these questions helps you figure out what you need to wear day and night.
	
Although fashion may seem like a one-way street, with all the clothes stream­
ing out of Seventh Avenue and into the malls and boutiques nearest you, the 
truth is far different. Quite a number of people actually set the trends: design­
ers, buyers, fashion houses, the fashion media, and, believe it or not, you. You 
have a much greater influence on what designs actually end up in the stores 
than you may think. The following sections outline the key players.
Designers
Designers are people with creative vision. They have an idea about the 
way clothing should look, and they take this idea all the way from an initial 
sketch to an actual sample to, hopefully, a store near you. Top designers dis­
play their latest creations at shows held in New York, Paris, and Milan (see 
Figure 1-2).

11
 Chapter 1: Fashion 101
Figure 1-1: From the runway to real life.
Naturally the big name designers have more clout than those that are lesser 
known, but even they aren’t operating in a vacuum. Everyone in the fashion 
industry has his or her finger in the wind, trying to decipher what the next 
trend may be. And the fashion designers aren’t the only ones navigating 
public taste. The buyers (who pick and choose from the designers’ collec­
tions, determining what makes it from the runway to you) also have a huge 
impact.

12
Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
Figure 1-2: A design on a runway.
Buyers
Buyers are the people who decide, for every upcoming season, what will be 
hanging on the clothing racks in a store near you. Every store — from large 
department stores to small boutiques — has a buyer (or buyers). The buyers 
for the major retail outlets are one of the most important filters of the fashion 
trade. They have to be sure about what they’re buying, because if the general 
consumer has different tastes, the stores end up with a ton of extra merchan­
dise that will just end up on the sale rack.

13
 Chapter 1: Fashion 101
	
Back in 1919, an attempt was made to artificially change the course of fashion. 
Pressure was put on the fashion industry to stop raising hemlines because 
showing so much leg was thought to be damaging America’s morals. Designers 
responded and agreed to send hemlines back downward. The only problem was 
that women weren’t fans of the new fad, and so the longer skirts and dresses 
bombed, and American women roared into the 1920s wearing flapper dresses.
Fashion houses and their ads
Fashion houses are the companies behind the bigger name designers. 
They’re considered houses because the company bears the designer’s name, 
even after the designer has retired and someone else has taken over design­
ing the label. The fashion houses influence trends and, consequently, sales 
through the use of advertising. If you look through a fashion magazine, you 
see that most of the pages are ads. These ads, which are just as visually inter­
esting and informative as the editorial pages, can have quite an impact. For 
example, department stores didn’t want to stock designer jeans back in the 
1980s, but the ads placed by the jeans companies created the public demand, 
and it wasn’t long before those jeans were in every store.
Fashion media
Another important set of players is the fashion media, which is led by the 
major fashion magazines such as Vogue, Elle, and Harper’s Bazaar. The fash­
ion media decode what’s happening on the runways and download all the 
information to you. Anyone interested in fashion looks to these trend-setting 
publications (or their Web sites) to see what’s in style and what is the next 
“must have.”
Long before the designs hit the stores, the magazines’ editors choose what 
to feature in their magazines from the hundreds of looks on the runway. 
Because the fashion shows are about six months ahead of the next fash­
ion season, and the fashion magazines are sent to the printer two to three 
months ahead of when they hit the newsstand, the editors, who consult 
closely with the fashion designers, try to look ahead and anticipate what will 
be popular. Because of their position as a fashion authority, their decisions 
exert a considerable amount of influence.

14
Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
The other players
Other prognosticators also have a role to play. One example is the Color 
Marketing Group, a non-profit organization made up of design profession­
als from all sorts of fields, from fashion to interior design, who get together 
every year and decide that, say, powder blue will be “the” color for the next 
year. That sets off the fabric and yarn manufacturers to stock up on material 
for the fashion designers in this color.
Trend forecasters also play a role. Most of the big design houses have either 
in-house staff whose job it is to know what trends are coming around the 
corner, or they hire firms (yes, there are firms that do this) that special­
ize in predicting trends. These people are well versed in what’s cool in the 
celebrity world, with teenagers, and pretty much everything going on in pop 
culture. They also have to keep abreast of what all the other designers are 
doing. Not only do they know what’s going on now, but they are also steps 
ahead. Remember, the designers are designing their collections way ahead of 
when the trends will be “in.” They show their lines six months ahead of when 
they will be in stores and are designing even further ahead than that.
And stylists like Dana Ravich, who along with Pierre co-authored this book, 
dress stars for big red carpet events and for appearances on television shows 
or in print. If a celebrity is wearing a dress from an up-and-coming designer, 
that could be his or her ticket to fame, too.
You
The designers, buyers, and magazines can tell you what’s in style and guide 
you toward what to buy, but at the end of the day, it’s up to you. What makes 
the most sense for you, your lifestyle, and your body type determines what 
you purchase. After you develop your personal style, you can take cues from 
all these outside influences in order to navigate through all this information 
and make the choices that are right for you.
Getting Your Personal Style Started
Some of the factors that go into deciding what to wear include where you 
live, what your interests are, where you work, what you like to do when 
socializing, and what colors and styles suit your body type. By weaving all 

15
 Chapter 1: Fashion 101
these factors together (as Chapter 2 does), you can create your own personal 
style. To find out what belongs in your personal wardrobe, see Chapter 7.
Decide which trends can work for you
If you pick up a fashion magazine and look at the outfits the beautiful models 
are wearing, you may think, “What does this have to do with how I dress?” 
But even though you may not buy one of those designer outfits, it can give 
you clues on how to dress fashionably.
To begin with, when flipping the pages of a fashion magazine, stop and take 
a good look at those outfits that attract you. Decide what you find appealing 
about that particular look. You should even take notes. If you see a dress 
with an off-the-shoulder style showing off the model’s collarbones and that’s 
a body part you like, take note. If, while flipping the pages, you see that sev­
eral other designers are also making off-the-shoulder styles, you’ve spotted a 
trend that you’ll want to make yours.
	
Because magazines usually show photos of clothes for coming seasons, these 
designs may not yet be in stores. So tear out the pictures that you like. They 
can help when you’re shopping because you’ll know exactly what to look for. 
And if you’re tempted to buy a random dress at the end of the current season 
just because it’s on sale, the pictures you’re carrying around will inspire you 
to wait for the style you’re seeking. This is especially important if your budget 
only allows you to buy a few pieces.
Know your body
Of course clothing comes in all different sizes, but just because an outfit 
comes in your size doesn’t mean that it suits you. Some designers know how 
to make creations that can be adapted to women who don’t fit the runway 
mold. Other designers have a great eye for color and fabric, but when it 
comes to cut, they’re more the one-size-better-fit-all types. Your job is to 
learn what your body shape is and find out what types of clothes flatter your 
figure. If you find a designer whose fit works for your body, check out the rest 
of his or her line. Chances are good that all the pieces will fit you well. (Go 
to Chapter 3 for help in identifying your body shape and developing a better 
understanding of what clothes can make you look your best. Go to Part IV for 
advice on how to dress fashionably for any occasion.)

Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
	
Many women buy clothes that don’t fit, using the excuse that this gives them 
the incentive to get into shape or lose ten pounds. Some brides are able to 
meet such goals because they’re aiming for one particular and very important 
day in their lives, but most women don’t end up ever wearing those clothes. 
Of course, if you are aiming to lose weight (great!); I’m not trying to discourage 
you. But a more practical (and successful) strategy is to invest in pieces you 
can wear as the beautiful you that you are right now.
Make educated purchases
To make educated purchases, you have to understand a few fashion basics, 
like what styles look best on you, what fabrics are appropriate for certain 
seasons, and what colors are you. If you are not equipped with all the infor­
mation you need, shopping efficiently can be challenging.
	
When you shop, look at the short term (“I just love the way this looks on 
me”) and the long term (“Is this something I must have in my closet?”). If 
you see a pair of trendy gladiator sandals, ask yourself, “Is this something I 
need, or should I use this money toward a great black cashmere cardigan?” 
Buying trendier, less expensive items is fine, but buying quality pieces that 
can last you many seasons is essential. The decision-making process isn’t just 
about the way an article of clothing looks, but also how it was made. Head to 
Chapters 4 and 5 to pick up the required basics.
Determine where you want to fit in
A key to building your wardrobe is to decide what you want your overall 
personal style to be. If you’re a mother of three and spend most of your days 
playing with your children and carpooling, a good portion of your wardrobe 
will be geared to that. But you are also a woman with a personality of your 
own, and your wardrobe should have pieces of clothing that work off the 
playground as well.
So what should determine your style? Would you prefer to look like you’d fit 
right in walking down the streets of a fashion capital like New York, Milan, or 
Paris? Or are you more comfortable adopting the style more popular to the 
area where you live? (Figure 1-3 shows two outfits, one that would look good 
in a fashion center and another that is more mainstream.) Or do you want to 
identify with a particular group? If you work in an office, you need to under­
stand the dress code of that environment, and when socializing among your 
friends, you want to dress appropriately for the occasion, all the while being 
true to your personal sense of style.

17
 Chapter 1: Fashion 101
Figure 1-3: Your personal style is defined by many different aspects of your life.
During the course of a week, or maybe even a very hectic day, you could 
change your outfit over and over again, depending on where you are and 
where you’re going. But rather than consider playing clothes chameleon a 
chore, look at it as an endless series of opportunities to look gorgeous and 
express your personal style. To do that, you need to build up confidence in 
your ability to dress in the right attire no matter what the setting.

18
Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
Figure out how you want 
the world to see you
What you choose to put on your body when 
you wake up in the morning says a lot about 
how you feel on any particular day. Even the 
most basic outfit can say so much. Take jeans 
and a T-shirt, for example — an ensemble 
most women can relate to. The number of 
combinations you can put together with 
these two items is endless, 
but each look sends out 
a very different message. 
If you’re going for cute, 
you can pair a T-shirt with 
boyfriend jeans (a baggy 
jean that’s often cuffed and 
distressed) and flip-flops 
(see Figure 1-4). If you’re 
going for “hot and sexy,” 
add jewelry and stilettos to 
your basic look, and you’ve 
gone from simple to sexy in 
a flash (see Figure 1-5). For 
a more sophisticated look, 
try a blazer over your T-shirt 
with a trouser jean and black 
pump (see Figure 1-6). And a 
cute sweatshirt with a pair of 
ripped jeans that you’ve had 
forever can show that even 
on a casual Sunday, you put 
effort into looking cozy yet 
adorable (see Figure 1-7).
Now I understand that after a long work week, the last thing 
you want to do is try to look hot while running to get the 
newspapers. What I am saying is that, in the split-second of 
choosing what to wear for the day, make an effort to go the 
more flattering, put-together route. Doing so not only gives 
you more confidence to start the day, but it also prepares 
you for anything (or anyone) that comes your way! You 
may think of jeans and a T-shirt as only one kind of look, 
but even the most basic outfit can represent many differ­
ent aspects of your personality, as Figures 1-4 through 1-7 
show.
Figure 1-4: A casual, cute look.
Figure 1-5: A great pair of jeans 
and high heels is a sexy look.

 Chapter 1: Fashion 101
Figure 1-6: Jeans can be 
very sophisticated. 
Figure 1-7: Even cozy can be 
stylish.
	
Most of the time, you pay attention to what you’re 
wearing because you’re going out of the house. 
When you’re home relaxing, you’re likely to throw 
on any old thing or your favorite sweats. (And, of 
course, that’s okay.) However, sexiness and per­
sonal style develop only with confidence. My 
point? You should feel your best at all times. If 
you’re sitting at home, do it in your favorite 
sweats and your coziest T-shirt. If you’re heading 
to the market in sweats, make them look casual 
but sexy (yes, there is a way to make sweats 
look cute!).
	
To motivate your­
self to abandon 
the “it doesn’t 
matter how I look” 
mentality, try this: 
Remind yourself 
that you may run 
into someone you 
haven’t seen in 
years. Nine times 
out of ten you 
won’t, but you 
may. I want you 
to look great and 
feel fabulous at 
all times because 
then you’ll impress 
the person who is 
most important to 
you: you.
Go for diversity
A spice rack with 25 herbs lets you express 
yourself so much better than a spice rack 
with only salt and pepper. The same is true of 
your wardrobe. The more variety you have to 
choose from, the more you can express your 
personal style, which is only possible when 
your wardrobe has the depth to match all 
sorts of moods.

20
Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
When shopping, look at each purchase to see whether it expands your rep­
ertoire or is just another item like most of the others in your closet. Sure, 
you may love wearing gray, but if you already have numerous tops in your 
favorite color, try grabbing a top that highlights a different part of your per­
sonality. But always remember to buy only items that you’ll wear. Don’t buy a 
green top just because you don’t have one, if green isn’t a good color for you. 
The goal is to expand your wardrobe and express your style, all while staying 
in your color palette and wearing clothes that suit your body type.
	
If you’re not sure of the vibes you want to give off when you’re getting dressed 
in the morning, pick an outfit that allows you to add some variations. If you 
choose a monochromatic blouse, for example, stick a scarf (or a pair of fabu­
lous chandelier earrings) in your purse, so that you can jazz it up if you end 
up going out for a drink after work. Try to think ahead. If your outfit is one that 
can be livened up, you’ll be able to say, “Let’s go” when someone suggests 
doing something fun.
Build your wardrobe to include both 
basics and trendy stuff
For most photo shoots, the person being photographed hires a stylist who 
brings various outfits to choose from to achieve the perfect look. When Dana 
and I were choosing what to wear for the front and back covers of this book, 
we just went shopping in my closet. We were laughing, saying, “We really 
do practice what we preach!” I had every basic item we needed to convey to 
you exactly what we wanted to. My point? Having basics in your wardrobe 
is a must. (The black dress on the back of the book is one I’ve had for eight 
years.) Now, I am not saying I don’t have trendy items in my closet — I do. 
But I’m careful when buying something that I know will be out next season, 
and I don’t spend as much money on it as I do on something I know will be 
around for a while. Your closet, too, should include the basics and a few 
trendy things.
Fitting Your Style to Your Budget
In creating a style, you’re going to run into a reality check, otherwise known 
as your clothing budget. If you happen to have an unlimited amount of money 
to spend on clothes, then you can skip this section. But because most people 
do have to watch what they spend, learning to shop within your budget is an 
important skill to develop.

21
 Chapter 1: Fashion 101
Spend more on the basics, less on the 
trendier things
Some people approach clothes shopping as they do their grocery shopping. 
They make a list of what they need and go out searching for the cheapest 
price. While stretching your food dollars this way can be quite effective, it 
doesn’t always work with clothing. I encourage you to spend more on certain 
staples, items that will take you from season to season and look rich with any 
outfit. Trendier items are the pieces to save on because they may only last 
you the season. (In Part III, I explain what to look for so that even your “save” 
items will look like splurges.)
	
Sales are great times to buy staples, seasonless items, and classic pieces. 
Although the store just needs to clear space for new shipments, that classic 
pair of black Calvin Klein pants marked down and down again may fit perfectly 
in your wardrobe. Sale racks often take time (and patience, for that matter) to 
look through, but don’t walk by because you feel like sales mean something is 
of poor quality. Quite often, it’s just the opposite. (To find out more about this 
topic, check out Chapter 7.)
Take stock of your wardrobe
The temptation for many women to go out and buy clothing is a strong one. 
If you think your wardrobe has a hole that needs filling, you could just take 
the first opportunity to hit your local stores or surf the Web. But at some 
point you’ll likely run into the ceiling of your clothing budget, and you don’t 
want that to happen at a time when you need the perfect dress for a special 
occasion.
So don’t always be so quick to look for an opportunity to shop outside your 
closet. Shopping can give you a psychological boost, but if you’re using it as 
a way to lift your spirits rather than as a way to create a look for yourself, 
then you’re almost certain to miss both goals. Rather than reach for your 
credit card every time you feel like it, do what every clothing store does sev­
eral times a year: Take inventory.
If you don’t take stock of what you already have in your closet, you’re likely 
to buy the same thing over and over again because that’s what you’re drawn 
to. Being organized and allowing yourself to really see what you have gives 
you the freedom to buy new pieces you may have otherwise overlooked.

22
Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
I’m not suggesting you enter every item you own into an Excel spreadsheet. 
Still, you should take some time as a new season is about to arrive to go 
through all your clothes and give away whatever isn’t perfect for you. (For 
more on how to pare the ordinary or unexceptional from your closet, see 
the next section for a brief introduction on my 10 System and Chapter 2 for 
additional details.) At the same time, make a list of what you need and put 
down as many details as possible. For example, “a white button-down shirt to 
wear under blazers” may top your list. That way the next time you’re looking 
through the racks in your favorite store, you’ll able to fill in the gaps in your 
closet.
	
Some people give away items as soon as they buy a new one. While that 
method preserves closet space, it places unnecessary limits on you — espe­
cially if you’re a good shopper. There’s no reason to get rid of one pair of 
navy slacks just because you buy another pair, especially if you can wear the 
new pair in a different way. Maybe you wear one pair to work with ballet flats 
because they’re too short to wear with heels. Another pair of navy slacks 
that you can wear with heels wouldn’t be considered a repetitive item in your 
wardrobe. Although both slacks look similar, they serve different purposes.
Invest only in 10s
My main goal in this book is to help you concentrate on quality instead of 
quantity. I would rather you own one black blazer that fits you perfectly and 
is of the best quality than four that are “eh” — which leads me to my 
10 System: Every item you have should be evaluated on a scale of 1 to 10, and 
only 10s should remain in your closet. Every blazer, sweater, or pair of jeans 
(shall I go on?) must fit this requirement to keep a place in your fabulous 
closet. As you go through the next chapters, keep this scale in mind. (To find 
out more about the 10 System, see Chapter 2.)
	
Throughout this book, you’ll find tips on how to shop for key items, especially 
in the chapters in Part IV. Because these important garments have to be close 
to perfect, they may require the extra expense of being altered by a profes­
sional tailor. Although I try to help you save money throughout this book, in 
some instances, I encourage you to spend a little extra because it’ll pay off in 
the long run.

23
 Chapter 1: Fashion 101
Prolong that new clothes feel
Putting on a new article of clothing is a great feeling. Even if no 
one notices, you know that your mood has been elevated. But 
after a while, that blouse (or pants or scarf) joins the ranks of 
all the other items in your closet. Even though it’s no worse for 
wear, it loses the punch it once had on your emotions. It’s no 
different than if you ate your favorite dish over and over. After 
a while, you’ll yawn instead of salivate when you see it on the 
menu.
While you can’t stop this 
process, you can slow it 
down. Learning how to rein­
vent pieces you have is key. 
For example, a white button-
down shirt can take you 
many different places. It can 
be worn under a sweater, 
as in Figure 1-8. When you 
are on vacation in a tropical 
place, it can be tied over a 
bathing suit and paired with 
a long skirt (see Figure 1-9). 
If you’re heading to work, 
it can be worn with a 
sweater-vest (see Figure 
1-10). And finally, if you’re 
off to a fancy event, you 
can dress it up by pairing 
it with a sequin skirt, as in 
Figure 1-11.

yet sophisticated with a

down will have you looking

A Last 
Important 
Point
Throughout this book I talk a 
lot about personal style. My 
hope is that you’ll use all the 
information here to figure 
out the overall image you 
want to project to the world. 
When all is said and done, 
no matter what you’re wear­
ing, you have to be yourself. 
If that means certain styles 
are not for you, so be it. But 
with so much to choose from, 
you can be sure to find pieces 
that are perfect for you. And 
by the time you’ve finished 
reading this book, you’ll 
know just how to be the styl­
ish woman you’ve always 
dreamed of being!

Be confident in your clothes and wear what you feel best in. If you’re not 
comfortable in what you’re wearing, it will show. 
Tracy Reese, Fashion Designer
W
hat you wear reveals so much about you. That’s 
why choosing what to put on every day can be 
so hard. If the clothes you put on reflect your personal­
ity, then every day you’re making choices that show 
the world a little something about yourself. These 
choices can actually affect how you go about the 
rest of the day. So when you get dressed every 
morning, you’re revealing how you feel, showing 
an aspect of your personality, and preparing your­
self for what type of day it’s going to be. (Amazing, 
right? Did you realize that old sweater you put 
on last week may have been the cause for your 
chaotic day?)
In this chapter, you discover how to create and manage 
your own personal style so that you always leave the house 
feeling fabulous! And please don’t look at this as some massive 
project. This aspect of your life is in your control and is very easy to manage. 
You are steps away from walking out the door every day with a new, confi­
dent look — so get ready!

What You Wear: The Key to Confidence 
and a Window to Your Personality
You can find many definitions of what it means 
to “be fashionable.” When I talk about a per­
sonal style, I don’t mean that your clothes need 
to reflect what the latest issue of Vogue shows, 
What I mean is that your clothing should reflect 
you and your personality. Here’s why:
	
✓	How you look on the outside reflects 
how you feel on the inside. Are you full of 
confidence or more the shy type, raring to 
go or in need of a nap, ready to meet any 
challenge or looking for any excuse to dive 
under your desk? 
	
✓	How you look affects your attitude, your 
decisions, and often what plans you 
choose to make (or, more importantly, 
not make). You never know what the day 
is going to bring, so you should be pre­
pared for all situations (within reason). If 
you leave the house in the morning looking 
so-so, you’re less inclined to accept that 
spontaneous invitation for drinks or dinner 
after work. You don’t always have to be 
dressed up in cocktail attire, but if you 
look great and are confident in your outfit 
(even if it isn’t as dressy as you’d like), 
you’ll be more inclined to accept the 
invitation.
	
✓	The way you look and feel about yourself 
influences your confidence. One of the 
sexiest things a woman can own is her 
confidence. You want to look fabulous at 
all times because, let’s face it, you should 
always look like the fabulous person you 
are! Confidence is your best accessory 
(see Figure 2-1). When you walk into a place thinking, “I look smashing!” 
others will think the same thing. Trust me.
Figure 2-1: Looking and 
feeling your best boosts 
your confidence. 

27
 Chapter 2: Impression Management: Developing Your Personal Style
This chapter (and this book, for that matter) is all about empowering you. 
And the first step in grabbing some of that power is recognizing that your 
appearance is very much in your hands to mold; you have complete control 
over it. If you believe you’re not good at selecting your clothing and the pro­
cess isn’t any fun, you probably haven’t yet figured out the right way to do it 
for you.
What to Aim for When Creating 
Your Own Personal Style
Personal style is about finding a look that best expresses your personal­
ity. It’s also about coordinating looks and really accentuating your physical 
attributes while camouflaging the areas that need a little help. In fact, your 
personal style is something that is going to carry you through your adult life. 
Yes, it may change a bit over time. And yes, it will and should incorporate 
some of the latest trends, but it’s not about blindly following what appears in 
the pages of the latest fashion magazines.
	
A key to creating your own style is knowing the difference between fashion 
and style. Fashion is what is current and in the moment according to maga­
zines and top designers. Style is something you develop according to your per­
sonality and body type. So while miniskirts and knee-high boots may be the 
latest fashion, they may not be appropriate for you because of your body type, 
personality, or both. That doesn’t mean you have to abandon them entirely. 
You can incorporate parts of a particular look into your own style. If a mini­
skirt is the wrong length for you, try a pencil skirt that comes to your knee. 
If skirts aren’t in your repertoire at all, try a pair of boots under some great-
fitting slacks. If the current boot has a pointy toe, wear one in that style and 
you’ll be incorporating the latest trend in a way that works with your style.
Accentuating your personality
You can shape your personal style in many ways. The choice of what distin­
guishes your personal style from somebody else’s, such as a specific color 
or chunky jewelry or stiletto heels, should be one that suits your personality. 
If you love to be the topic of conversation at a cocktail party, investing in 
statement jewelry may be the way to go. Many women feel sexier in heels, so 
maybe topping off each outfit you wear with an unbelievable pair of pumps 
or sandals is your style. (You get the drift, right?)

28
Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
Feeling comfortable whenever you head out the door gives you added con­
fidence. And this part of the puzzle is a lot of fun. It really allows you to play 
with accessories, shoes, scarves, and bags. Plus, it gives you the freedom to 
buy and wear things that are unique to you!
Using clothing to complement 
your personality
It’s great to experiment to see how you can bring out other facets of your per­
sonality. You’ll be surprised how a different look can make you feel. Consider 
these examples: 
	
✓	If you aren’t used to being the center of attention and tend to dress in 
darker or more subdued colors, try something a bit bolder. If putting on 
a red dress is too much at first, start with a big accessory to brighten up 
your outfit or try a red top with jeans to ease into dressing in brighter 
colors. Play around with different combinations to discover which ones 
you feel comfortable in. Maybe you’ll decide to dress up an otherwise 
plain outfit with a pink scarf. That scarf will show the world that you 
were careful about what you chose to wear, but it won’t do it in such an 
obvious way. 
	
✓	If you love being the center of attention and are always wearing showy 
or ornate pieces, you may want to try toning your look down from time 
to time. 
	
✓	If you have a fabulous figure (good for you!) and love to show it off, try 
a more subtle approach occasionally, which is also very sexy. (It may 
sound cliché, but less really is more.) Having a little mystery in the mix 
is always good. 
	
You have to feel comfortable in the clothing that you wear. Your style is a 
reflection of your personality. While experimenting is great, especially when 
you’re developing your style, being confident and expressing your true self 
is the most important thing. Find out what works for you and your body type 
and develop your wardrobe around that.
Using clothing to project 
the image you want 
In creating your style, you not only want to reflect who you are, but you 
also have to be focused on the image you want to project. While you should 

29
 Chapter 2: Impression Management: Developing Your Personal Style
always stay within your comfort zone, it’s okay to push the envelope a bit. 
For example, if you’re very conservative and are looking to dress a tad sexier 
but you’re not sure how to do it, take baby steps. Instead of wearing your 
little black dress with pumps and pearls, try a stiletto heel and a great pair of 
chandelier earrings. This takes your look from simple to sizzling with just a 
couple of changes, while staying within what’s comfortable for you.
Showing you’re in control
One of the great cries of women everywhere is, 
“I don’t know what to wear!” Now it’s one thing 
to say that in the privacy of your own home, 
but when you walk out the door, you don’t want 
anyone else wondering, “What was she thinking!?” 
You want to have control over your wardrobe 
and, more importantly, give the impression you 
have that control (even if you were in total panic 
five minutes before leaving the house). It’s all 
about looking put together as opposed to looking 
thrown together!
Keep in mind that looking put together doesn’t 
mean that everything you have on matches per­
fectly. To be honest, women who wear everything 
matchy-matchy look more like fashion victims 
than mavens. The idea is to create an overall 
image that makes those looking at you think you 
were in complete control when you selected your 
outfit.
	
Only one item you’re wearing should pop. If you 
choose a patterned blouse, keep the rest of the 
outfit simple (see Figure 2-2). If you have an intri­
cate necklace with a lot of beading, make that 
necklace the center of attention and go with one 
color when choosing the rest of the outfit (see 
Figure 2-3). This rule definitely has exceptions, but 
it serves as a great jumping-off point.
Yes, you can break these rules, if you know what 
you’re doing. Mixing and matching patterns is defi­
nitely possible, but the key is that one or both are 
Figure 2-2: Pick one item to 
pop in your outfit.

30
Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
very subtle and the color scheme must match. 
For example, you can wear a pinstripe pantsuit 
with a floral blouse. If the pinstripe is subtle, 
the blouse can take more of center stage (for 
more on matching patterns and colors, see 
Chapters 4 and 5). As long as the colors in the 
suit and the blouse are in the same family, or 
one is totally neutral, you’re good to go. Before 
you mix patterns, be confident you know what 
you’re doing. If you’re not sure, keep it simple 
and pair either pattern with a solid.
Reflecting different moods
To reflect every possible mood, you need the 
clothes to do that. When you go shopping, 
think about how a particular item of clothing 
or accessory can help you expand your abil­
ity to express yourself. If everything you own 
is very loud, how are you going to dress when 
you’re in a quieter mood? Or if everything 
you own is very subdued, you don’t have the 
option of really dressing up if you’re invited 
to a great party.
I’m not saying that if you love wearing all 
black, you need to ditch your entire ward­
robe. What I am saying is that if black is your 
choice of color, make sure you have acces­
sories, shoes, or bags that make your outfit 
pop when an event calls for it. Different colors 
make you feel different ways, so keep your 
options open!
	
I love to wear all white. I think it’s extremely fresh and clean-looking. But white 
isn’t appropriate for all occasions. I wouldn’t wear all white in the dead of 
winter to a dinner party. My point? The color you wear (and the part of your 
personality you want to project) depends on the time and place. 
Fitting perfectly — literally 
and figuratively
Every woman should develop her own personal style and create a wardrobe to 
express it. Building a style is a gradual process that happens as you find and 
Figure 2-3: Let your accessory be 
the focal point.

31
 Chapter 2: Impression Management: Developing Your Personal Style
collect pieces that fit into the big picture. Does that mean you have to look the 
same all the time? No. It’s okay to have subsets of style. The image you want 
to project at the office is going to be different than on the tennis court. But 
you have to remember that you’re projecting an image in both places. If you’re 
going to have a personal style, those images generally need to be compatible.
With that said, I know how overwhelming and confusing building a wardrobe 
can be. It may take some time before you have the confidence to walk into 
a mall or department store and instantly say, “Oh, that fits perfectly in my 
closet.” Finding items that are a perfect fit (and I mean that in both senses of 
the word) can be difficult. But look at it this way: Because you have so much 
to choose from, differentiating yourself from everyone else becomes a little 
easier, and after all, that’s really your goal.
Defining Your Personal Style
There’s no end to the type and amount of items you can purchase to jazz up 
your wardrobe. What you choose defines your personal style. So if the items you 
select are all of the latest fashion, then your style is going to be high fashion. If 
you choose to wear T-shirts and jeans every day, that too is a style statement. By 
carefully choosing what you wear every day, you’re projecting an image. The fol­
lowing sections help you get started in developing your own personal style.
Getting familiar with fabrics and styles
To have the confidence you need when buying clothing, you must become 
familiar with the different fabrics and styles. That way, when you grab an 
item from the clothing rack, you can be absolutely sure of what you’re 
buying. (For more information about what to look for, see Chapter 4.)
Keeping up with what’s “in” is also important. Picking up a fashion magazine 
every month is a great way to stay in the loop. And remember, the ads are just 
as important as the editorial pieces. Chapter 8 has the details on what to look 
for, but for now you just need to know that the magazines, as well as what you 
see celebs wearing on talk shows or the red carpet, can give you a glimpse into 
what’s hot. Even if you examine only one of these outlets, you’ll be able to pick 
up the basic trends like the latest hemlines, colors, cuts, and fabrics.
Considering your characteristics
What about you can be part of your personal style? Lots! Your lifestyle, age, 
profession, attitude, and hobbies all play a part in defining your personal 
style. Here are some guidelines:

32
Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
	
✓	Lifestyle: Are you a single woman living in 
the big city or the mother of three running an 
entire household? When you’re on vacation, 
do you head for Broadway or the beach? The 
answers describe your lifestyle and, in turn, 
help define your personal style.
	
✓	Age: Everyone wants to look younger, right? 
The desire to knock off a few years is natural, 
and your wardrobe is one of the ways to do 
that. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to 
dress in the latest trends, but do it in an age-
appropriate way. Some trends transcend gener­
ations. Asymmetrical necklines (see Figure 2-4), 
for example, were big at the Oscars and Golden 
Globes in 2009. Celebrities of all ages were 
wearing one-shoulder dresses as they graced 
the red carpets. It was just how they were wear­
ing them that was different. Don’t be afraid to 
get in on the latest trend if it’s something you 
love. Just make sure you do it in a way that fits 
your age, personality, and body type.
FFP
	
	If you like a current trend but feel it may be 
too youthful-looking for you, it probably is. 
This is true of fashions that reveal the most 
skin and are the most adorned. Use your judg­
ment when trends veer in this direction, and 
err on the more conservative side.
	
✓	Profession: If you work in an office, the dress 
code is likely different than if you work in a 
store or at a school. Although you have to 
work within the constraints of your particular 
industry, you should be able to express your 
style no matter what the dress code.
	
✓	Attitude: Whether you’re a free spirit or some­
one who’s more conservative, your clothing can reflect your attitude. 
Use your wardrobe to express yourself.
	
✓	Hobbies: What you do in your free time determines your look as well. 
Whether you’re running errands or running on the beach, your outfit 
reflects your personality and what you like to do.

Evaluating your answers
Now that you’ve taken our style quiz, find out who you are and how to define 
your look. If your answers fall mostly in the A’s, B’s, C’s, or so on, you fall 
pretty neatly into one of six groups, outlined in the following sections.

35
 Chapter 2: Impression Management: Developing Your Personal Style
Mostly A’s: Group 1 — The bohemian
You are a true bohemian (see Figure 2-5). You 
love wearing loose-flowing, romantic tops, skirts, 
and dresses. You tend toward looking casual, yet 
pretty. Most of your clothes can go from day to 
night. You look like you just walked off the beach, 
no matter what time it is, because you have a 
relaxed, easy vibe about you. Your color palette 
includes white, off-white, white, and more white, 
earth tones, brown, and some beachy colors like 
turquoise and coral.
Figure 2-5: The true bohemian.
Figure 2-6: The prep.
Mostly B’s: Group 2 — The prep
You love to wear your polo shirts. You pair them with crisp 
pants or shorts, depending on the weather and the activity. 
You are likely to be seen in shorts at the country club during 
the day and pants at the evening barbeque. The cable knit 
sweater is the cornerstone of your wardrobe. Your color 
palette is navy blue, kelly green, and pink — all paired with 
crisp white, if not one another. Your wardrobe is also filled 
with bold prints, such as plaid, madras, and argyle, for 
when you’re in the mood to be noticed. The prep look (see 
Figure 2-6) is totally “old school” yet multigenerational and 
current as well.

36
Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
Mostly C’s: Group 3 — The surfer chic
If you answered “C” to all or almost 
all the questions, you are the quint­
essential surfer chic (see Figure 2-7). 
Your number one priority is how big 
the waves are. You don’t care what’s 
going on in the real world. Your 
world is the beach. You spend your 
mornings and evenings, and all day 
if possible, at the beach and out on 
the waves. Your outfit of choice is 
a bikini and rash guard, with sheep­
skin boots (of course). Your color 
palette is red, yellow, and blue — all 
paired with sand or off-white. The 
bright colors are reminiscent 
of all the beautiful foliage 
in Hawaii. Plus, they let 
other surfers know 
you’re coming when 
you catch the big 
wave!
Figure 2-7: The surfer chic.
Figure 2-8: The fashionista.
Mostly D’s: Group 4 — The fashionista
If you answered “D” to all or almost all the questions, 
welcome to group 4. You’re the ultimate fashionista (see 
Figure 2-8)! You love the big city. You adore your uniform 
of all black with stiletto boots, stiletto pumps, or stiletto 
sandals. You love to dress up, be in all the latest trends, 
and wear all designer names. You’re never a fashion 
victim, and even if you can’t afford the high-end designer 
labels, you look like you do. You know which pieces to 
spend your money on and how to make the whole look 
appear expensive. You never miss an issue of Vogue, Elle, 
or Harper’s Bazaar. Your color palette is black and more 
black, paired with the color of the moment, which is, of 
course, “the new black.”

37
 Chapter 2: Impression Management: Developing Your Personal Style
Mostly E’s: Group 5 — The classic
You’re in group 5 if the letter E came up the 
most, which makes you a total classic (see 
Figure 2-9). You have an easy way about dress­
ing and are always put together and chic. You 
stick very close to the basics. You can buy 
your clothes at Gap or on Madison Avenue, or 
a combination — after all, a classic is a classic. 
Your wardrobe consists of white button-down 
shirts, jeans and slacks, the perfect black 
blazer, the perfect little black dress, and a 
fabulous trench coat or two. You also have a 
drawer full of beautiful scarves and a closet 
full of gorgeous purses. Your color palette 
is denim, white, and black, with splashes of 
color here and there in the form of an acces­
sory such as a scarf or purse. Clothing is 
basically neutral in color. The ultimate 
example of a classic is, of course, 
Jackie O.
Figure 2-9: The timeless classic.
Figure 2-10: The suburbanite.
Mostly F’s: Group 6 — 
The suburbanite
If you answered mostly F’s, you fit comfortably into group 
6, the realm of the suburbanite (see Figure 2-10). You have 
a casual lifestyle outside the big city. You spend most of 
your time taking care of everyone else, but you manage to 
squeeze in an exercise class, a trip to the gym, or a run out­
side when you can. Errands and shuttling the kids take up a 
huge portion of your time, so you need to be comfortable, 
yet still feel stylish. A cute, well-fitting sweat suit is your 
go-to outfit first thing in the morning, and it generally car­
ries you through all the day’s activities. If an evening activ­
ity is on the agenda, a quick change to slacks or jeans and 
a sweater or nice T-shirt does the trick. Your color palette 
consists of darker colors like navy, gray, and black. These 
colors are flattering and slimming and don’t show stains or 
wear and tear from all your daily activity.

Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
Help! I didn’t have “mostly” anything
If your answers didn’t indicate a definite tendency toward one look or another, 
it means that you don’t currently dress in any particular style but throw on 
something generic to fit the activity. If that’s the case, this is an area you can 
work on. The easiest way to do so is to answer the questions according to how 
you picture yourself and see your life, rather than what it currently may be.
	
You don’t want to have too many styles going on at the same time. Of course, 
as your social settings change or your mood shifts, you want to be able to 
adapt your style to fit your needs at the time. But while there’s no doubt that 
you’ll have to massage your style regularly to get it to fit your schedule, you 
also don’t want to abandon it on a regular basis. Rather than attempting to 
develop different styles for different occasions, work on finding ways to use 
your personal style as a common thread in any outfit you put together.
	
Even if you aren’t entirely categorized by one group or another, picking a style 
and going with it can make life a lot easier. I’m not saying you can’t delve into 
other looks when the mood strikes or the occasion arises — but to develop a 
personal style, you need to narrow it down.
Building Your Stylish Wardrobe
After you have an idea of the direction you want to go in, you can get started 
searching for the tools — that is, the clothing and accessories — that can 
help you to meet your goal. Woo-hoo! Time to have some fun. Your closet is 
about to get a makeover, and so are you! The next section has the details.
Using my 10 System to create 
the perfect closet
Once you decide on your style direction, it’s time to focus on what you have 
going on behind those closet doors. Quality, fit, and style are the most impor­
tant factors when creating your wardrobe. This means everything in your 
closet should be first-rate, whether it’s a formal gown or sweat pants. So 
here’s the deal about your closet (and read this sentence over and over again): 
Everything in it is a 10 — that is, the best — or it’s about to be. If it isn’t a 10, 
guess where it’s going? Yup! Out the door. Nothing less than a 10 is acceptable. 
No, not even to just run to the market, walk the dog, or lounge in at home. 
In order for your clothing to be considered a 10, it has to pass the following 
test. And, yes, you must go through your closet piece by piece, trying things 
on and asking these five questions of every single item. These questions are 
in no particular order and are all equally important. Be ruthless! This is not a 
multiple-choice portion of the book. Every criteria in this list needs to be met 
or the item is out the door like a bad date!

39
 Chapter 2: Impression Management: Developing Your Personal Style
	
You must be brutally honest with yourself. Sometimes it helps to have a friend 
with you, someone whose fashion sense you trust (but any really honest friend 
will do). It makes the whole process a lot more fun, and you can do it for each 
other, so you both benefit.
What condition is it in?
Before you even try anything on, take a look at each garment and survey 
its condition. Is it permanently stained? Are there holes beyond repair? Is 
it stretched out to the point that it no longer fits well? Is the material pilly 
(does it have those little round nubby things that cling to lots of sweaters in 
particular)? If you answer yes to any or all of these questions, you don’t even 
need to try it on. Toss those pieces straight onto the donation pile.
Does it fit?
If it passed the quality control test, the next step is to try it on. Does it fit? 
And, more importantly, is it flattering? Is it really a 10? Do you feel like a mil­
lion bucks when you put it on? If not, it’s outta there.
	
If you have a blouse that goes perfectly with a particular pair of pants but it 
happens to be a little tight so that it shows off that bulge around your tummy, 
then it’s the wrong choice for you. Ditch it! If you feel uncomfortable about its 
defects, you won’t wear it no matter how well it goes with the pants. Better to 
get rid of that blouse and avoid feeling conflicted every time you see it than to 
keep it just because it’s the only blouse you have in that color.
Is it in style?
Is the piece in style? If not, is it more of a classic piece that will always be in 
style? Or is it a high-quality item that may come back into style? (The latter 
scenario is rare. Even when things come back into style years later, they’re 
always a bit different. Remember the shoulder pads in the 1980s? Well, when 
they tried to bring them back recently, the pads were on a much smaller 
scale and the whole trend didn’t really take off again, so those pieces weren’t 
worth keeping anyway.) So, if the piece isn’t a classic and is truly last year’s 
trend (or even last decade’s trend), out it goes.
Is it relevant to your current life?
How does this garment fit into your life? Is it an old college sweat shirt? Are 
they your spinning shoes, and you haven’t seen the inside of a gym in years? 
Is it a sweater set from your younger, more conservative days? Take stock of 
your day-to-day life and your activities, and then evaluate what you actually 
need and actually wear. Do you need office clothes, workout clothes, party 
clothes? It can be all of the above, but if you don’t play tennis anymore or 
don’t work in an office anymore, or if anything in your life has changed that 
affects your wardrobe, then you need to be okay with letting these pieces go. 
Don’t get sentimental about your old suits. If you don’t use them, someone 
else may be able to. Isn’t that a lot better? And just think about how nice your 
closet will look with less clutter!

40
Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
Do you ever actually wear it?
This is where you really have to be straight with yourself. We all have things 
in our closet that we’re either “saving” or we just think we may wear some­
day in this other life we’re not living. Sometimes, the piece isn’t really your 
style or color, but you think it’s a nice top and you may find a reason to wear 
it one day. Trust me, you won’t. If it’s something you put on and then change 
out of every time before you leave the house, you really don’t feel comfort­
able in it, so don’t even bother. Just get rid of it.
If there’s even a question, a maybe, it’s out. Seriously.
	
Obviously, if your ex-boyfriend gave you a sweat shirt back in high school, you 
can keep that. Yes, even if it’s full of holes. But there better be a really good 
story behind any item you choose to keep that isn’t a 10!
In with the new: A-shopping you will go
Dressing in style doesn’t mean that every single item you wear every day 
has to be brand new. Although some women have the luxury to do that, the 
vast majority of women don’t have the money, the time, or the storage for 
all the clothes and accessories needed to accomplish that. Nor do you have 
to throw out every thing you already own to develop a personal style. Your 
shopping goal at this point is to add classic-looking basics and pieces that 
Where to take the things you don’t want
After you know what you’re getting rid of, the 
next thing is to figure out what to do with the 
outgoing piles. Here are the options:
	✓	Charities: Any number of charities would 
be more than thrilled to receive the goods 
you’re unloading, such as homeless shel­
ters, women’s shelters, and other charitable 
organizations like Dress for Success.
	✓	Vintage shops: If it’s truly a vintage piece, 
designer, and really worth something — just 
not something that still fits you or your life — 
you can try selling it to a high-end vintage 
shop.
	✓	Consignment shops: If the item isn’t 
really vintage or high-end but is in good 
condition, relatively current, and is a rec­
ognizable brand with possibly some resale 
value, then by all means take it to a con­
signment shop. You may be able to get 
some cash for it. Some shops pay you only 
if or when they sell the items (hence, the 
name “consignment.”) Other shops pay you 
upfront for the merchandise.
Nothing feels better than purging all that excess 
from your closet. You’ll be so happy you did. 
Just think about all the room you’ll have for all 
your fabulous new clothes. Plus, you’ll actually 
be able to see what great pieces you already 
have and can use to start putting together fash­
ionable outfits.

 Chapter 2: Impression Management: Developing Your Personal Style
truly express the new look you want. That means you want to begin purchas­
ing any fashion essentials that you’re missing.
The following basic items are the building blocks for every wardrobe. 
Incorporate them with other pieces to express your personality and style. 
When you shop for these items, consider your body type and fit when choos­
ing the cut, length, and style that works for you. I explain how to determine 
what you need for your body type in Chapter 3:
	
✓	Little black dress (LBD)
	
✓	Black blazer
	
✓	Crisp white button-down shirt
	
✓	Black trousers
	
✓	Knee-length black skirt
	
✓	Classic beige trench coat
	
✓	Black leather bag
	
✓	Dark denim jeans
	
✓	Pair of black pumps
	
✓	White cardigan sweater (to layer)
	
✓	Black cardigan sweater (to layer)
	
✓	Set of pearls
	
✓	Diamond studs (can be cubic if need be — just keep them small)
You may already have some of these items, but are they really high quality? 
If not, replace them with high-quality items. For these staples, it’s okay to 
spend a little more. (You can wait for a sale, but keep in mind that some of 
these items don’t go on sale very often because they’re always in demand.) 
If you don’t have the money for a new one now, it’s better to wear your old 
raincoat for another season and buy a really good one next year. Remember, 
you’re not on a schedule. Building a stylish wardrobe is a gradual process.
These staple garments are the basis of your wardrobe; they have their own 
style — classic — and that speaks volumes. After you establish your basic 
wardrobe, you’ll add additional pieces to create your personal style.
	
As you shop, keep these tips in mind:
	
✓	Choose clothes that blend in rather than stand out. Creating a style 
using accessories is easier and less expensive, but for those accessories 
to shine, you need clothes that frame them, not overwhelm them. So 
make sure you have enough solids in your wardrobe. Having solids that 
you can wear over and over is easier on your budget and makes putting 

42
Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
outfits together easier, too. You can do this with neutrals, which can be 
anything in the white, black, gray, or beige family.
	
✓	Shop online or use the Web if you lack the time to go shopping. If you’re 
completely frazzled when you hit the mall, then your attitude may stop you 
from seeing how a particular article of clothing can help you to express 
yourself. Offsetting this lack of time are all the new ways to shop, especially 
the Internet. If you can’t get to a store, set aside some time at night when 
you can surf the Web. Even if you don’t buy anything, you can print out the 
type of clothes you like. Then when you go to a store, you can follow the 
decisions you made when you weren’t so stressed out.
	
✓	Buy things you like. Even if you buy an item at a time, after a while 
they’ll start to match up. After all, they all suit your taste, and with that 
common denominator, eventually they’ll mesh. So if you see a blouse 
that you really love but you feel like you have nothing to go with it, buy 
it! Trust me, you probably already own something it will go with, or 
you’ll buy something soon enough that will be its perfect mate! By the 
way, 99 percent of all the blouses you own will go with jeans, a black 
pencil skirt, or classic black pants. (Just an FYI for when you say to 
yourself “I have nothing to wear with this!”)
Getting help from the pros
As you shop for pieces to include in your new stylish wardrobe, asking a 
salesperson for assistance is often helpful. She’ll know the lay of the land and 
can direct you straight to what you’re looking for so you can avoid wandering 
around aimlessly (to later purchase something you don’t need).
	
When you find a helpful salesperson in one department, let her know which 
department you’re going to next and ask who you should ask to see. Chances 
are, she’ll be able to guide you toward another salesperson who “gets” it.
If you think that you’re really clueless and you need more than just a depart­
ment store salesperson, then you need to find a fashion consultant. A sales­
person is limited to the clothes in that store, but an outside professional 
can steer you toward a variety of stores where you can find what you need. 
Hiring a fashion consultant can also be a good first step in the process of 
deciding what your personal style should be. The two of you can create your 
style, develop a game plan, and go out shopping. Then, if need be, you can 
continue to shop on your own or engage the consultant on a regular basis to 
go on shopping trips — either with you or for you.
For more information on how sales associates, personal shoppers, and fash­
ion consultants can help you, go to Chapter 8.

▶	Knowing when to have your clothing altered
Not every trend is going to work for everybody, or body type. Determine 
what works for you and what does not. 
Shoshanna Gruss, Fashion Designer
Just because an article of clothing is in style does not mean it belongs in 
your closet. I know, I know, sometimes you walk by the window of your 
favorite store, you see that perfect dress, and you say to yourself, 
“I have to have it!” Well, before you whip out your credit card 
or wallet, wait! Just because that dress looks fabulous on 
the mannequin does not mean it’ll look fabulous on you. 
If you try it on, and it looks nothing like what it looked 
like on the mannequin, put it down; do not buy it. If 
it’s not a 10 on you, it won’t be a 10 in your closet 
(see Chapter 2 for information on my 10 System).
How can you ensure that everything you choose 
is a 10? You need to pay attention to your size and 
body type. These are key factors in deciding what 
you can and can’t wear. I don’t mean to steer you 
away from trying to make the latest trends work for 
you. I just want you to figure out the best way to flatter 
your figure so you look and feel your best. This chapter 
tells you how.

Golden Rules and Good Advice for Finding 
Clothing that Compliments You
Every woman has something to complain about when she looks in the mirror. 
(If you don’t, good for you — you can move to Chapter 4!) But if you’re like 
most women, once you fix the one thing that bothers you, another seems to 
emerge. You lose weight; now it’s time for smoother skin. You get your teeth 
whitened; now it’s time for buffer-looking arms. The journey never ends. Why 
do so many of us feel the constant dissatisfaction? One theory is that the 
closer we get to “perfection,” the more annoying other imperfections feel! 
(Exhausting, isn’t it?)
With that said, we all have parts of our bodies that are great and parts that, 
well, just aren’t. You need to be honest with yourself, know what your strong 
features are, and then pick stylish items for your wardrobe that flatter those 
areas. The key is to find a style that compliments your shape, size, and stat­
ure. The following sections show you how.
	
I’m not saying that some items in your closet should highlight what works best 
on you. I’m saying all of them should. You should always be your sexiest self, 
whether in sweaters, sweats, or sizzling evening wear.
	
Whatever your shape, you may have noticed that some designers fit you 
better than others. Why? Because each designer uses a fit model as the stan­
dard for their sizing, and each fit model is different, which means that each 
designer’s garments fit differently. Because it costs more for manufacturers 
to provide a variety of fits for every garment, they just stick to the one base­
line fit and size up and down from there. So if you find a particular brand that 
works for your body, see what else is in that designer’s line. Chances are good 
that many of the line’s items will also work for you.
Getting key measurements
Most women have a good idea what their measurements are, but rather than 
assume you know, get an accurate measurement. Going to a tailor will give 
you more accurate measurements, but you can certainly get a close approxi­
mation handling the measuring tape yourself. The measurements that you 
definitely need are your chest, waist, hips, and inseam. You may also want 
to add your thigh and upper arm measurements. Figure 3-1 shows where to 
place the tape to measure each of these areas.

45
 Chapter 3: Dressing to Flatter Your Body
When taking these measure­
ments, use a cloth tape measure, 
not a metal one. Make sure that, 
when you circle your chest, 
waist, or hips, the tape is level 
and neither too tight nor too 
loose. Also measure yourself on 
your bare skin, not over clothes. 
And this may sound silly, but 
don’t trust your memory — be 
sure to write the measurements 
down!
	
✓	Chest: Measure the circum­
ference of your chest. Place 
one end of the tape measure 
at the fullest part of your 
bust, wrap it around (under 
your armpits, around your 
shoulder blades, and back 
to the front) to get the 
measurement.
	
✓	Waist: Measure the circum­
ference of your waist. Use 
the tape to circle your waist 
(sort of like a belt would) 
at your natural waistline, 
which is located above your 
belly button and below your 
rib cage. (If you bend to the 
side, the crease that forms 
is your natural waistline.) 
Don’t suck in your stomach, 
or you’ll get a false measurement. If you generally wear your clothes 
below your waist, take that measurement as well.
	
✓	Hips: Measure the circumference of your hips. Start at one hip and wrap 
the tape measure around your rear, around the other hip, and back to 
where you started. Make sure the tape is over the largest part of your 
buttocks. Because making sure the tape is level back there can be hard, 
try to do it in front of a mirror.
	
✓	Inseam: This is the distance from the uppermost inner part of your thigh 
to the bottom of your ankle. You can measure your inseam in two ways.
 
• With help: While you’re wearing a pair of pants, have a friend 
stretch the tape from your crotch to the bottom of your ankle.

• Without help: If you have a pair of pants that fit you perfectly (and 
they shouldn’t be too loose around the waist), measure the inseam 
of the pants, again from the crotch to the hem.
	
	The proper inseam on a pair of pants you’re going to purchase will 
depend on the height of the heel you’ll be wearing with them.
	
✓	Thigh: Measure the circumference of the fullest part of your thigh. Wrap 
the tape measure around your thigh from front to back and then around 
to the front. You may be tempted to cheat by lowering the tape measure 
a few inches but then you won’t get an accurate measurement.
	
✓	Upper arm: Measure the circumference of your arm. Wrap the tape mea­
sure around the widest part of your upper arm from front to back and 
around to the start point.
	
✓	Sleeve length: Get help for this one because it’s hard to do yourself. Place 
your hand at your waist (your elbow should be bent at a 90-degree angle). 
Then start at the middle of the back of your neck and measure to your 
shoulder, down your arm to the elbow, and then on to the wrist.
	
You may need a family member or friend to assist you with the measurements. 
If you have a garment that fits perfectly, measuring the garment rather than 
your body can be a good substitute.
The fruit basket: Determining your shape
What is the ideal shape today? I bet you’re saying, “It depends on who 
you ask.” If you look at many fashion magazines, you’ll likely see the ideal 
as tall and thin. If you ask the average male, he may say a woman who is 
“curvaceous.” And if you ask yourself? Hmmm, that may take a little while 
to answer. But here’s the deal: In order to begin to build a wardrobe that 
expresses your personal style, you must determine what your shape is.
Okay, don’t roll your eyes, but yes, I’m asking you to assess your body and 
then compare yourself to a piece of fruit. You’ve probably heard these terms 
before, but perhaps this is the first time you’ll actually identify yourself with 
food that usually works as a centerpiece on your kitchen table.
The shape of many women can be described as bearing a similarity to either 
a pear or an apple. Now, take a look in the mirror and decide which of these 
you resemble most. If you’re a pear, you tend to carry your weight around 
your hip and bottom area, and if you’re an apple, you tend to carry your 
weight in your upper body.

47
 Chapter 3: Dressing to Flatter Your Body
Once you know your shape, your next job is to figure out how to use fashion 
to accentuate the parts you love and help hide the parts you don’t. By dis­
covering how to draw attention away from problem areas, you then have the 
general knowledge you need to dress in the most flattering way for your body 
type, no matter the occasion.
	
Whether you’re a pear or apple does not mean you’re overweight. Apples 
simply carry their weight in their upper bodies, and pears tend to carry their 
weight around their hips and bottoms. The trick is to use your clothing to 
make your figure more proportioned on top and bottom. What if you don’t fall 
into either category (some women are cut pretty straight up and down; others 
are fairly proportional)? Fortunately, you don’t have to be either one or the 
other to make this information work for you. No matter your shape, you can 
use the advice I give in the following sections to make the most of your cloth­
ing! Plus, you have more leeway with what looks good.
The most common fruit: The pear
The most common shape for women is the pear shape (see Figure 3-2). What 
that means is that the widest part of your body is below your waist, around 
your hips. Remember, you can be tall, short, heavy, or skinny and still be 
pear-shaped.
Figure 3-2: A pear-shaped woman.

48
Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
If you’re a pear, your fashion goal is to elongate your figure so that you look 
less bottom-heavy. The first line of attack to reaching this goal is to balance 
your hips and your shoulders while showing off your curves. The key here is 
to accentuate your top half. For example, if the eye is drawn to your cute top 
or the scarf around your neck, it takes the focus off your bottom half.
Always wear something darker and slimming on the bottom, like dark jeans or 
slacks, or a dark knee-length pencil skirt or A-line skirt. And, no, that doesn’t 
mean that you always have to wear black on the bottom, but make sure that 
the bottom is solid in color and darker than whatever you have on top.
As a pear, you want to direct attention to 
your tops. Fun colors, prints, or details at the 
neck all serve the purpose of drawing the eye 
away from the hip area. Just make sure that 
your tops don’t end at your hips because that 
draws unnecessary attention there. Figure 3-3 
shows how combining a tailored, flared pant 
with an attractive, eye-catching top can play 
up a pear’s best features.
Read on for even more pear-pleasing 
suggestions:
	
✓	Go for clean, tailored lines on the 
bottom. Whatever you wear on the 
bottom should always be more tailored, 
such as flat front pants. With skirts, the 
A-line or flared skirt is a great piece to 
use as a base to accentuate a beautiful 
selection of tops. Stay away from pleats, 
side pockets, or anything that is going to 
add dimension to this area.
	
	If you wear a belt, make sure it’s slim 
and the same color as your pants (a 
wide belt draws more attention to the 
area you’re trying to deemphasize). If 
you belt a dress, make sure the belt sits 
higher up at your waistline rather than 
your hips. Better yet, wear a top that’s 
gathered around the stomach. Doing so 
hides your tummy if you need to, while 
creating dimension someplace other 
than your hips.
Figure 3-3: The perfect outfit for 
a pear.

 Chapter 3: Dressing to Flatter Your Body
	
✓	Wear pants or jeans that have a flare on the bottom. A flared leg draws 
the eye away from your hips and creates a more flattering line for your 
whole body. Conversely, stay away from capri or tapered pants. They 
drive the eye right to the hips. 
	
✓	Check out tunic tops or dresses. You can wear a tunic top or dress as 
long as it fits properly. (Don’t wear a tunic top or dress if it’s in any way 
clinging to your belly or your hips.) One that fits properly gives a clean, 
elongating line while camouflaging everything underneath. The great 
thing about this style is that it accentuates your arms and your whole 
upper body and makes you appear taller and leaner at the same time.
	
✓	Make use of jackets. Jackets are great for pear-shaped people because 
they usually have interesting details around the neckline and give more 
structure to the shoulder area, where you’re trying to direct the focus. 
When wearing a jacket, choose one that ends past your hips, not at 
them. A longer jacket, such as a cute blazer, creates a long, lean line and 
covers the hip area.
	
✓	Experiment with different necklines. A deeper, more plunging neckline 
elongates your upper body and draws all the attention upward. Try 
wearing a long necklace to fill in the neckline, which also adds to the 
lengthening of your upper body.
	
✓	Show off your shoulders. The shoulders are a great and sexy part of a 
woman’s body. Especially if you’re pear-shaped, you want to show them 
off by wearing off-the-shoulder tops that expose one or both shoulders. 
These tops immediately attract attention and steer the eye exactly where 
you want it. Ruffles or puffy sleeves on your top are also great for pears.
	
When you keep it simple on the bottom, you have so much room to play with 
tops and accessories. You can start to stock your wardrobe with great fitting 
pants, jeans, and skirts, and then play with colors, prints, and less expensive, 
trendier items on top. Try a fun scarf around your neck, a fabulous necklace, 
or a great pair of earrings. These items all serve to draw the eye up to your 
best feature — your face!
	
Choose materials that hold their form like wool slacks or denim. They flatter 
and streamline your shape. Avoid any tight knits on the bottom because they 
cling and accentuate your width.
The next most popular fruit: The apple
Apple-shaped women (see Figure 3-4) are fuller around the middle. If they 
gain weight, it shows up around their belly and upper body. They’re usually 
larger-breasted and their upper arms and shoulders are broader, too. Their 
legs tend to be thin and their butts tend to be flat.

50
Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
Figure 3-4: An apple-shaped woman.
As an apple, you want to emphasize your strong points (your bust and legs) 
while camouflaging your weaker ones (your midsection), keeping it all in bal­
ance. Since the idea is to draw the eye toward those parts of your body that 
shine and away from those that don’t, you want to show off your great legs.
	
✓	You can wear patterns, just follow these guidelines. Any large pattern 
is going to draw attention, so don’t wear a large pattern on top. Wear a 
small, subtle pattern on top, or save the patterns for the bottom. A great 
print skirt with a solid sweater set is a great way to express yourself 
while also flattering your figure.
	
✓	If you have a fuller chest area (and are comfortable accentuating this 
area), draw attention to it. Doing so keeps straying eyes from your mid­
section. Wear a sexy V-neck. (Ooh la la!)
	
	Wear bras that support your bust. And any straps on your tops should 
be wide enough to cover your bra straps. (See Chapter 14 to find out 
more about the different types of bras.)
	
✓	If, like most apples, you have great legs, short skirts are in order. If 
you’re in the office, the shortest your skirt should be is just above the 
knee. If you’re going out for a night on the town, go a little higher!
	
✓	A-line skirts also work with your figure. Since they flare out from the 
waist, A-line skirts offer balance and proportion to your upper half.

51
 Chapter 3: Dressing to Flatter Your Body
	
✓	If you don’t have much of a backside, and you want to give the illu­
sion that you do, wear pants with back pockets. Your jeans should 
have a rise lower than your natural, wider waist. Don’t wear pants with 
pleated fronts, as that only makes your middle look larger.
FFP
	
	Don’t wear pants that are too tight, even if you have good legs, because 
that makes your top seem extra large. Remember, while you want to 
emphasize your better attributes, the challenge is to do so while also 
keeping your overall look in balance.
	
✓	Go for longer jackets. Your jackets should be on the long side, never 
ending at waist level. Make sure they come down to your hips to create a 
long, lean line right over your waist and tummy area. And opt for single- 
breasted jackets that you can keep unbuttoned. A double-breasted 
blazer that needs to be buttoned to look 
right only makes you look larger on top.
	
✓	Opt for drop waists. A dress or top with a 
drop waist (that narrows down at the point 
of your hips instead of your true waist) 
bypasses any constricting fabric around 
the tummy area and makes your torso 
appear longer and leaner overall.
Figure 3-5 shows an outfit appropriate for an 
apple-shaped woman. It hides the problem 
areas and accentuates the positive features.
	
If you’re an apple with great legs, you can get 
away with anything on the bottom, even knits. 
As far as your top goes, stay with materials that 
offer more structure, like a straight cut cotton 
blouse, or something blousy like silk. Both of 
these camouflage the midsection. You want to 
avoid tight knits on top because they cling and 
accentuate this area.
Where’s your waistline?
Another common attribute of women is to be 
either short-waisted or long-waisted. To deter­
mine your own “waistedness,” follow these 
simple steps:
	
1.	Measure the distance between your 
armpit and your waist.
	
2.	Measure the distance between your waist 
and the bottom of your bum.
Figure 3-5: An A-line skirt is a 
great cut for an apple-shaped 
woman.

52
Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
	
3.	Compare the measurements.
	
	 If the two aren’t equal, you’re either short- or long-waisted: If the first 
measurement is shorter, you’re short-waisted. If the second measure­
ment is shorter, you’re long-waisted (see Figure 3-6).
Short-waisted women
Maintaining balance is one important key to flattering your figure and dress­
ing for your body type. If you’re short-waisted, you’re going to look out of bal­
ance with a top half that appears smaller than your bottom half. Finding ways 
to make your top half look proportionate to your bottom half, by making your 
waist appear longer, helps you achieve balance.
	
✓	Try a top with vertical lines. These lines give the illusion that your top half 
is longer than it is. The stripes can be as subtle as a pinstripe blouse — 
anything that keeps the eye moving up and down right over your waist 
works.
	
✓	Wear tops that you can leave untucked. This is another way of hiding 
where your waist actually is.
	
	A deep V-neck draws the focus upwards and away from your waist (this 
is a little tip that works for everyone — not just short-waisted women).
Figure 3-6: A short-waisted (left) and a long-waisted (right) woman.

53
 Chapter 3: Dressing to Flatter Your Body
	
✓	Avoid dresses with a waistband. If you do need a belt, choose a narrow 
one that’s in the same color as your outfit to minimize the attention to 
the waist area.
	
✓	If you wear prints, limit it to your top and make sure your top ends by 
your hips. This hides your true waistline, and the break between the pat­
tern and the solid bottom make your waist seem longer than it really is.
What you don’t want to do is draw attention directly to your middle, as the 
left-hand model in Figure 3-7 does. The wide belt at the waist accentuates the 
short waist, making the top half look out of proportion with the bottom half. 
The tunic top, on the other hand (also in Figure 3-7), elongates the waistline 
and makes the body look balanced.

Long-waisted women
The problem that long-waisted women have is that their body type makes 
their legs seem shorter. If you’re a long-waisted woman, you need to use your 
clothes to add length to your bottom half:
	
✓	Choose dresses that have an A-line or an empire waist. These styles 
make your waist appear higher than it is, thus making your legs appear 
longer too.
	
✓	Choose shirts that cover your waist. The short, stomach-baring shirts 
are a problem for long-waisted women. When these types of shirts were 
the trend, it became difficult for long-waisted women to find tops that 
didn’t look like they’d shrunk in the dryer. (By the way, anyone over the 
age of 12 should avoid this trend at all costs. No adult women should 
ever wear stomach-bearing tops. And, no, it doesn’t matter if you spend 
every day at the gym!)
	
✓	Choose pants that are at your natural waistline or a bit above. You 
definitely want to avoid hip huggers because they make your legs look 
even shorter.
	
	Never feel as though you’re not “in” if you aren’t wearing what are sup­
posedly the current trends. Even the fashion industry makes mistakes. 
You don’t have to follow its lead! As I’ve mentioned before, don’t let a 
trend dictate what you wear. Not all trends work with all body types, 
and you don’t want to be a fashion victim. Better to stick with your own 
style and wear clothes that flatter you.
	
✓	Opt for short jackets. The bolero style, for example, can be very elegant 
on a long-waisted woman.
	
✓	Wear heels. They add length to your legs.
	
✓	To heighten the effect of longer legs, make sure your shoes match 
your bottom. If you’re wearing a skirt or dress, matching hosiery also 
adds to that effect, as does a wide belt that matches the color of your 
bottom.
Whatever you do, avoid styles and cuts that make your legs look shorter (see 
Figure 3-8). Low-waisted jeans with a shorter top only accentuate your long 
waist, cut you in the middle, and make your legs look shorter. High-waisted 
pants, on the other hand, will elongate your legs, and raise the appearance of 
your natural waistline (also in Figure 3-8).

Tackling other problem areas
The preceding sections concentrate on the waist and hips because those are 
the most common problem areas, but there are others as well:
	
✓	Full arms: If your arms are very full, try wearing tops that extend the 
shoulder, such as a drop shoulder. Adding a colorful shawl in cooler 
months can also work well. And, of course, tops with lots of fabric in the 
sleeve can also disguise what’s underneath.
	
✓	Long necks: If you don’t like your neck because you feel it’s too long, 
use scarves, turtle necks, cowls, or high collars to make it appear less 
elongated.

56
Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
	
✓	Short necks: For a short neck, you want to expand the neck area by 
making it seem that the area just below the neck appears to be a part 
of it. For that, keep your neckline open by unbuttoning a top button or 
wearing V-necks.
	
✓	Too-large or too-small chest: If you want to make your chest area seem 
smaller than it is, a fuller top deemphasizes what’s underneath. You 
can also wear darker, solid tops with a higher neckline. These minimize 
the look of the bust area and make it appear smaller. If you have small 
breasts and want them to appear larger, try wearing tops in lighter 
colors or with prints. These draw attention to your bust and also make 
it appear bigger, as do V-necks, sweetheart necks, or any neckline that 
shows off the bust area. And a very colorful scarf tied in a knot at chest 
level draws the eye there and accentuates the bust as well.
	
Remember these two general principles: Cover problem areas with some cre­
ative fashion sense, and highlight the other parts of your body that you find 
attractive to draw the eye there.
Getting Your Size Right
Clothing is available for all body types. Whether you’re buying pieces from 
the general misses collections, the petites department, or the plus-size 
department, make sure your clothing fits you properly.
Clothing sizes are never exact because no two people have the exact same mea­
surements. In many instances, the compromises that you have to make to wear 
“your” size are not that noticeable. Other times, you really must have your cloth­
ing altered to get the right fit. If you can find a manufacturer whose size is really 
close to yours, buy whatever you need and like from that designer’s line.
Petites
Regular misses clothing is designed to fit a woman who is 5 feet 5 inches. If 
you’re significantly shorter than that, even if some measurements like your 
waist or bust match a particular regular size, many others like sleeve length 
or inseam won’t. So women on the shorter side need to shop in the petite 
section in order to get the best fit.
As you’d expect, if you’re shorter than average, your goal for your wardrobe 
is to make yourself seem as long as possible. So petites should wear clothes 
that don’t cut them off in the middle but rather offer the eye the longest 
possible line.

57
 Chapter 3: Dressing to Flatter Your Body
	
✓	Clothing that offers vertical lines such as 
stripes or is monochromatic (or has colors 
in the same family) are your best bet. If you 
wear patterns, make sure that they’re smaller 
(larger patterns can overwhelm you). Stay 
away from opposites, such as a stark white 
shirt and black pants. These color combos 
cut you in the middle. If you want to wear 
contrasting colors, make sure that the overall 
look remains vertical so you maintain a longer 
appearance. For example, go ahead and wear a 
red blouse with a charcoal gray skirt, but make 
sure that you also have a matching charcoal 
jacket.
	
✓	As a petite, you want to avoid horizontal 
lines. Wide belts or sashes shouldn’t be a 
part of your wardrobe, unless they’re the 
identical color of your outfit.
	
✓	Detailing can also be useful. A long skirt 
with a line of buttons down the side adds 
length to the eye. A wrap dress with an edge 
that stands out, for example one made of 
satin, offers a long diagonal line, which has 
much the same effect as a vertical line.
	
✓	Need I mention heels? Shoes are most 
women’s favorite accessory, not to mention 
biggest weak spot when shopping! Women 
always make an excuse to buy more shoes. 
Well, petite women, as long as you can walk 
in them, break out the high heels! They’ll 
give you a couple extra inches and, in most 
cases, give your confidence a boost, too.
Figure 3-9 shows an outfit that makes a petite 
woman look taller because of the pinstripes and 
because the color scheme is the same from top to bottom.
The taller woman
Many tall women likely didn’t love their height growing up. (It’s never easy 
being the tallest girl in the class!) But get older and being tall is likely easier. 
Now it’s just about finding clothing that flatters your long body!
Figure 3-9: A pinstripe top is a 
good choice for a petite woman.

Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
Unless you’re over 6 feet tall or have some real figure 
flaws that you’re trying to hide (refer to the earlier 
section “The fruit basket: Determining your shape”), 
you’ll have an easy time shopping and finding cloth­
ing that works and looks great on your body. Most 
models and fit models (models designers use to size 
their clothing) are on the taller side, and so most 
designers cut according to those models.
	
The Baby Phat line of clothing is designed by Kimora 
Lee Simmons who is 6 feet tall, and tall women report 
that she has adapted her line to suit taller women, so 
you may want to check out her clothing line. You can 
find Baby Phat designs at Macy’s as well as online at 
www.babyphat.com.
If, for some reason, you’re uncomfortable with your 
height and want to draw attention away from it, your 
goal should be to differentiate your top half from the 
bottom to keep the eyes from seeing you as one long, 
lean line. To accomplish this, you can use horizontal 
stripes or a wide belt. Both keep eyes from looking 
you up and down. Another way to accomplish this 
is to wear different colors on your top and bottom 
halves. Black and white does this well, as do any two 
contrasting colors. A taller woman can also use larger 
accessories, like a large bag and chunky jewelry. If 
your accessories are eye-catching and/or in bright 
colors, they attract all the attention. Figure 3-10 dem­
onstrates how you can wear a contrasting black belt 
to cut the body in half and make it appear shorter.
	
If you’re really trying to appear shorter, flat shoes 
(obviously) help. Tons of cute flats are out there these 
days, from boots to ballet flats to sandals to flip-flops. 
The variety is endless and a very welcome addition to 
most tall women’s wardrobes!
Plus sizes
If a size 14 in misses clothing is too small for you, you fall into the plus-size 
category. You’ll have a larger variety to choose from and a much easier 
time finding clothing that fits properly and works on your body type if you 
shop in the plus-size department.
Figure 3-10: Tall women 
look great in contrasting 
colors and flats.

59
 Chapter 3: Dressing to Flatter Your Body
As a plus-size woman, you’re still a 
fruit (lucky you!) and need to follow the 
rules that fit your body shape (head to 
the earlier section “The fruit basket: 
Determining your shape” to get the 
appropriate tips).
In addition to the fruit tips, as a plus-size 
woman, you’re going to look better in 
solids or small patterns because with so 
much extra material, any larger pattern is 
going to make too strong an impact. If you 
wear plus sizes, a monochromatic look 
will help elongate your appearance, as 
Figure 3-11 shows. Of course, while muted 
colors are going to blend in more, don’t 
be afraid of color. If the clothing fits right, 
is flattering, and accentuates your better 
attributes, go for it. Bright accessories 
and statement jewelry are also a great 
way to make any basic outfit pop.
Since a little added height also makes 
you look more proportioned, wearing 
heels is a good idea, especially when 
you dress up. If you’re showing your 
legs and wearing hosiery, don’t wear 
hose with patterns or bright colors, how­
ever, because that makes your legs look 
larger. Better to stick with dark tights or 
flesh-colored hose.
Depending on your exact shape, low-rise 
pants may be good for you because they 
don’t squeeze you around the middle 
(assuming that’s your widest part). You want to avoid wide belts because 
they draw the eye to your waist. When you wear a belt, choose one that 
matches the color of your top or bottom. Doing so deemphasizes your 
waistline.
	
If you haven’t done so already, try out Spanx (head to Chapter 14 for these 
and other undergarments). Spanx are made to hold you in basically wherever 
you need a little help! They should become your best friend whether you’re a 
size 2 or 20!

If you’re plus-size and constantly choose 
loose dresses because you think they 
hide what you’re insecure about under­
neath, stop! Loose dresses with an abun­
dance of material make you look even 
bigger (see Figure 3-12). They also make 
you look like you don’t have any shape at 
all and do nothing to accentuate the attri­
butes you should be showing off.
	
Just because you’re plus-size doesn’t 
mean you need to be wearing mu-mus. 
Make an effort to find clothing that flatters 
your body. Every woman has beautiful 
parts and those should be accentuated, 
not hidden under a tent. Along those same 
lines, be careful that your clothing is not 
too tight. Avoid materials that cling to 
your body, like spandex.
Evens and Odds: 
Understanding 
Clothes Sizing
In most settings, two is twice as big as 
one, but not in women’s clothing. In the 
past, most women either made their own 
clothes or had them custom-made, so 
there was no need for standardized sizes. 
But once most women started buying 
their clothes ready-made, a system of standardization was required. In the 
early 1950s, the National Bureau of Standards, a government agency, was 
called in to study the situation. An Acting Secretary of the Subcommittee on 
Body Measurements for Wearing Apparel Sizes was appointed and various 
engineers and mathematicians were brought on board. After three years of 
hard work, the standards were set.
The operative word in the preceding sentence is “were.” Even though the 
federal government spent three years working to figure out standard sizes for 
clothing, this relatively easy-to-understand system didn’t last long because 
women started to grow larger. In order to please women who didn’t want to 
Figure 3-12: Don’t choose anything that 
resembles a mu-mu.

61
 Chapter 3: Dressing to Flatter Your Body
have to say they were buying sizes that were at the higher end of the scale, 
the fashion industry introduced vanity sizing, which effectively moved every 
size down by four notches, so what was once a size 10 became a size 6. In 
1983, the government threw up its hands and got out of the sizing business 
altogether, and so sizes today are a bit of a free-for-all. Because the govern­
ment doesn’t dictate standard sizes anymore, you can’t always be confident 
that what a label reads on one garment will be at all similar to another. In 
other words, a size 8 made by one manufacturer does not necessarily fit the 
same way a size 8 from another manufacturer does.
	
Today the only vestige of the old standard sizes can be found in patterns, 
which have steadfastly retained the old sizing formula.
Nowadays clothing manufacturers have developed their own systems and the 
result can be a bit confusing. Consider these examples:
	
✓	Junior clothing includes only odd numbers, 0–13. The fit is more 
youthful, which generally means smaller and younger in style. If 
you’re past your teenage years, you should generally not be buying 
junior clothing. It most likely won’t fit properly and is not really age 
appropriate.
	
✓	Women’s clothing (often called “misses”) runs from sizes 0 to 14, even 
numbers only. These sizes are for most women, unless you’re petite, 
plus-size, or still young enough to wear junior sizes. These garments 
are cut with the assumption that women have fuller figures, taking into 
account the bust and hips.
	
✓	Plus-size clothing in most clothing lines is anything above a size 14. 
However, there have been recent changes made with women’s or misses 
clothing. Now you can find some misses clothing up to a size 20. A true 
plus size will be designated, say, 18W. The difference is that the plus size 
is cut larger in the bust and middle.
So what does all this mean to you? If you understand that the size indication 
on a garment is only a rough guideline, you’ll be much more careful to try 
on every item you buy before you make the purchase so that you won’t have 
drawers filled with clothing that doesn’t fit properly.
The Beauty of Altering
Just because you’re a size 6 and the label on the dress in your hand says 
“Size 6” doesn’t mean that dress is going to fit you. Instead of getting frus­
trated by this, find yourself an expert tailor. Yes, it’s going to force you to 

62
Part I: Fashion, Style, and You 
spend some of the money you normally would on buying clothes on getting 
the ones you have fixed, but you’ll end up with a wardrobe filled with clothes 
that fit you like a glove. Believe me, you can do more with a closet full of 
clothing made up of all 10s than you could with a lot of 5s laying around.
Here’s the situation with getting things altered: Do it when it makes sense. If 
you find the perfect dress in a size 14 but are yourself a size 2, you shouldn’t 
take the dress to the tailor to make it fit. But if you find a perfect dress that 
just needs to be a little shorter, or the waist needs to be taken in, or the arms 
are too long, the tailor should be your next stop.
	
A great fit is nearly priceless. So if the clothing is really worth it — it looks 
great and makes you feel great — invest the money to have it tailored prop­
erly. If it doesn’t fit properly, you can bet it’s not a 10 (refer to Chapter 2), and 
it shouldn’t be in your closet, let alone on your body!
Finding someone schooled in the art of altering clothes can be difficult. Here 
are some suggestions:
	
✓	Department stores often have tailors on the spot who can measure you 
and do the necessary work. If this is an option, grab it. The department 
stores know the tailors’ work well and use them time and again. You’re 
pretty much guaranteed quality workmanship.
	
✓	Dry cleaners are often a good source, either because they have a tailor 
in house or know of someone. If you need something like a simple hem, 
the dry cleaner is a safe bet. If the alteration is more complicated, con­
sider an alteration shop.
	
✓	Alteration shops specialize in alterations and should be able to do what 
you require.
	
A referral from someone who has used a good tailor is always your best bet. 
The last thing you want is to experiment with a new tailor if you have a com­
plicated alteration or the garment was very expensive. You may want to have 
two people, one who is less expensive and you can trust to do little jobs (like 
the hem on a pair of pants) and another who specializes in dressy dresses and 
more complicated items.
	
Not so long ago, most women could sew a simple hem. (I can’t, so don’t feel 
badly if you can’t either.) That was because pants only came in one long length 
and so they all had to be hemmed to the proper length. Then manufacturers 
started selling pants, especially jeans, in a multiple of inseam lengths and the 
concept of having clothes altered started to fade, especially as sewing machines 
became less and less common a household appliance. (If you don’t own a sewing 
machine or are laughing at the notion of it, you’re not the only one!)

A
 true fashionista can distinguish between 
designer clothing and knock-offs in a milli­
second. The main way of doing that is by the fabric. 
It’s easy to imitate a style, but since one of the main 
costs of an item is the fabric, imitations are usually 
easy to spot if you know what to look for. And vice 
versa, if you find an affordable outfit by an unknown 
designer but recognize that it was made with quality 
fabric, then you’ve found yourself a true bargain.
In order to build your wardrobe properly, you must have a 
general knowledge of the fabric you’re buying. By discovering 
how to recognize quality materials and construction, you’ll be able to 
make better decisions on what to purchase. This chapter gives you the lowdown.

Fabric Basics Everyone Should Know
The garment industry uses hundreds of different fabrics in the making of 
clothes. About 220 different fabrics alone can be used to produce a woman’s 
suit, for example. Some of these are variations of a basic fabric, such as the 
many types of cottons, ranging from broadcloth to Pima, while others are 
made from various fibers and have unique characteristics, like brocade, 
which has raised designs on a flat surface. (See the later section “Fabrics and 
fabric blends” for a list with descriptions.)
How much do you really need to know about fabrics? Actually it helps to 
know quite a lot. Here’s why:
	
✓	One of the keys to dressing fashionably is having variety in your 
closet. If you have ten blouses that are identical in fabric, except for 
their color, it’s difficult to put together an outfit that stands out. But if 
your collection of blouses features lots of different fabrics as well as a 
variety of textures, weaves, and shades, you can put together outfits 
that are more unique.
	
✓	Knowing the different fabric varieties helps when you’re shopping. 
Asking a sales associate for a black blouse doesn’t really give her very 
much to go on. But if you say you want a black silk blouse, you’ve nar­
rowed down the choices considerably. And if you say a black silk-satin 
blouse, you’ve done even more refining. Knowing one fabric from 
another can also help you as you scan your favorite store and look for 
that perfect outfit.
	
✓	The care of your clothing is dependent on what it’s made of. Most 
synthetic fibers, for example, are prone to heat damage, especially hot 
water in a washer as well as the heat of a dryer or iron.
Practical matters aside, the more you know about fabrics, the better you can 
become at selecting clothing of quality (which is the only type you should 
have in your 10 closet; refer to Chapter 2 for more on my 10 System).
Common fibers
There are five natural fibers (cotton, wool, silk, linen, and hemp) and five 
manmade fibers (acetate, acrylic, nylon, polyester, and rayon). These fibers 
are the building blocks of most of the material used in clothing. In some 
instances they’re used alone, but very often they’re blended together so that 
manufacturers can combine the look of one fabric (usually a natural one) 
with the durability of another (usually a synthetic).

67
 Chapter 4: Fundamentals on Fabrics and Garment Construction
Natural fibers
Natural fibers are just that — those that are found in nature. They come from 
plants or animals, as opposed to being chemically produced. The following 
lists a variety of natural fibers and explains how they’re used in clothing:
	
✓	Cotton: Cotton comes from a plant and is the most popular fabric, in 
part because it breathes. Among the fabrics made from cotton are flan­
nel, muslin, oxford, poplin, seersucker, and terry cloth. Because cotton 
cloth wrinkles easily, manufacturers often blend it with polyester to 
make it wrinkle resistant; unfortunately, this pairing also makes it less 
breathable. However, today you can buy 100 percent cotton shirts that 
don’t need to be ironed but merely thrown in the dryer for a short time 
because permanent finishes have been added to them that reduce wrin­
kling. While such shirts are more costly, in the long run they can save 
you a bundle in cleaning costs.
	
✓	Wool: Wool comes from animals and is woven into a fiber that can be 
made into clothing. Wool retains heat and absorbs moisture without 
feeling wet so it’s particularly good as an outer layer. When treated, 
worsted wool holds a crease and is smooth and quite durable, making 
it popular for suits, skirts, and slacks. Among the types of fabrics made 
from wool are flannel, gabardine, tartan, and various tweeds.
	
	Most wool comes from sheep, but the wool of other animals — such 
as alpaca, angora goat (mohair), angora rabbit, cashmere goat, vicuna 
(a type of llama), and camel — is also used.
	
✓	Silk: Silk is made from the hairs in the cocoon of the silk worm, and man 
has been using this wonderful fiber since 2,700 BC. Silk is one of the 
more elegant fabrics because the cloth produced is shiny and gives a 
dressier appearance. Among the fabrics made from silk are chiffon and 
doupioni, a knobby silk found in some men’s lightweight suits.
	
	Keep your silk away from alcohol. If you’re going to put on perfume or 
hairspray, do so before you don a silk garment and allow the alcohol to 
evaporate.
	
✓	Linen: Linen is made from fibers in the stalk of the flax plant. It’s the 
strongest of any vegetable fabric, as much as three times stronger than 
cotton. Yes, linen wrinkles easily, but it’s also easily pressed. Linen 
is a good conductor of heat, which makes it perfect to wear in hotter 
­temperatures.
	
✓	Hemp: Hemp comes from the stalk of the plant whose flowers and leaves 
make marijuana (but no, the stalk doesn’t contain any of the narcotics 
that give marijuana its punch). Like linen, it wrinkles easily. Because 
it’s considered a “green” fabric, hemp is growing in popularity, but it’s 
still illegal to grow hemp in the United States and so the fabric is usually 
imported from China.

68
Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment Construction, Fabrics, and Color 
Manmade fibers
While natural fibers require just some simple processing, manufactured 
fibers are a little more involved. They start as various combinations of raw 
ingredients that you may not associate with clothing at all, like petroleum 
and wood pulp. These substances are turned into fiber using techniques 
that  have only been around for the last century or less. Manufactured fibers 
can have advantages over natural fibers. For example, they can be made into 
hollow tubes that offer loft without the weight (such as those found in winter 
overcoats) and microfibers that are excellent at repelling water.
	
✓	Acetate is made from wood pulp. It can have the look of silk, dries 
quickly, and drapes well. If you own clothing made from acetate, keep it 
away from acetate in its liquid form, such as nail polish and nail polish 
remover. Liquid acetate will damage the acetate fabric.
	
✓	Acrylic is a synthetic fiber, meaning it’s manufactured from petroleum 
products. It has the bulk of wool, draws moisture away from the body, 
and can be washed. It also dries quickly, but melts if it becomes too hot.
	
✓	Nylon, the first completely synthetic fiber, entered the fashion world in 
the form of stockings introduced in the 1940s. It’s lightweight but strong, 
and its fibers are smooth and dry quickly. After many washes, nylon 
tends to “pill”; it also melts at high temperatures.
	
✓	Polyester fibers are strong and wear very well. Because it doesn’t 
absorb water easily, it dries quickly. The downside is that polyester 
doesn’t breathe. Unfortunately, polyester got a bad name for itself when 
it was used in double-knit fabric that was popular for a while in the 
1970s and then became overused. Today, polyester is often used in a 
blend with cotton or other fibers.
Cleaning silk
Though many people think silk has to be dry 
cleaned, it’s a natural fiber that was used 
for eons before such a thing as dry cleaning 
existed. That means it can definitely be washed, 
but you have to know how:
	✓	Hand-wash your silk garments. The agita­
tion of a washing machine can damage silk 
clothing.
	✓	Use lukewarm water and a non-alkaline 
detergent and don’t leave silk garments to 
soak. Never expose silk to bleach or deter­
gents with brightening agents. If you notice 
a soapy residue, add a spoonful of vinegar 
to the rinse water.
	✓	To dry silk, lay the garment down on a towel 
that will absorb the moisture. Don’t dry silk 
in the dryer or in the sun.
Note: If a silk garment has care instructions that 
say, “Dry clean only,” that may mean the manu­
facturer hasn’t taken the precaution to preshrink 
the fabric and didn’t use color fast dyes — in 
other words corners were cut. If that’s the case, 
make sure you dry clean that item so that it 
doesn’t shrink or fade and ruin the garment.

69
 Chapter 4: Fundamentals on Fabrics and Garment Construction
	
✓	Rayon is created from wood pulp, and it shares many of the qualities 
of cotton. It’s strong and absorbent, comes in a variety of qualities and 
weights, and drapes well. If rayon is washed before being made into a 
garment, it’s a washable fabric.
Fabrics and fabric blends
Given the relatively limited number of fibers — manmade and synthetic — 
that are used to make clothing, you may wonder how there can be so many 
fabrics. The answer has to do with how a fiber is woven, whether the fibers 
are blended, and what finishes are applied. This section gives you a quick 
rundown of a variety of fabrics and fabric blends.
A glossary of fabrics
Below is a quick look at the different fabrics and the weaves that can be con­
structed from them. It’s a good idea to become familiar with these fabrics 
(at least on a general level) so you know what you’re looking at the next time 
you’re deciding between garments.
	
✓	Boucle: A plain or twill weave made from looped yarns that give it a tex­
tured, nubby surface.
	
✓	Broadcloth: A fine, tightly woven fabric, either all cotton or a blend, with 
a slight horizontal rib.
	
✓	Brocade: A decorative cloth that is characterized by raised designs. It’s 
usually made of silk, sometimes supplemented by actual silver or gold 
threads.
	
✓	Calico: A plain-weave cotton fabric printed with small motifs.
	
✓	Cashmere: A wool, woven from the fleece of the Cashmere goat, that is both 
very soft and exceptionally warm. Because of the difficulty of separating the 
fine fibers from the surrounding coarse hair, cashmere is a luxury product.
	
✓	Chantilly lace: Lace with a net background and floral design patterns 
created by embroidering with thread and ribbon.
	
✓	Chiffon: A lightweight, extremely sheer and airy fabric with highly 
twisted fibers. Often used in full pants and loose tops or dresses.
	
✓	Corduroy: A fabric, usually made of cotton or a cotton blend, that uses a 
cut-pile weave construction. The wale is the number of cords in one inch.
	
✓	Crepe: A fabric that has a crinkled, crimped, or grain surface and that can 
be made from several different materials. Crepe de chine is made of silk 
and comes in various widths, with 4-ply considered the most ­luxurious.
	
✓	Duck: A closely woven, plain, or ribbed cotton fabric that is very dura­
ble. It’s similar to canvas but lighter in weight.

70
Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment Construction, Fabrics, and Color 
	
✓	Dobby: A decorative weave that has small patterns, often geometric.
	
✓	Faille: A closely-knit fabric that is somewhat shiny and has flat, cross­
wise ribs. Faille can be made from cotton, silk, or synthetics.
	
✓	Gabardine: A twill weave, worsted fabric that can be made from wool, 
cotton, rayon, or nylon, or blended, with obvious diagonal ribs.
	
✓	Gingham: A fabric made from various yarns, most often in a checked 
pattern.
	
✓	Herringbone: A twill weave with a distinctive zigzag effect.
	
✓	Microfibers: An extremely fine synthetic fiber that can be woven into 
textiles with the texture and drape of natural-fiber cloth but with 
enhanced washability, breathability, and water repellency.
	
✓	Satin: A lustrous fabric most often used in evening wear.
	
✓	Spandex: A stretchy fabric that offers comfort, movement, and shape 
retention. It is also known by its brand name Lycra (created by DuPont). 
	
✓	Taffeta: A crisp, tightly woven fabric with a fine crosswise rib that’s 
easily identifiable by the rustling sound that it makes. Originally all taf­
feta was made from silk, but today it can be made from a variety of syn­
thetic fabrics, sometimes combined with silk.
	
✓	Velvet: A luxurious fabric once exclusively made from silk but that today 
can be composed from a number of different fabrics including cotton. 
The dense loops, which may or may not be cut, give it a plush feel.
Fabric blends
Blending fibers in a fabric can help prevent wrinkling or lower the cost of a 
garment. Here are a few examples of blends and their advantages:
	
✓	Polyester and cotton: Polyester is crease resistant; cotton isn’t. A gar­
ment that blends the two may not need to be ironed or will require less 
ironing, while retaining much of the comfort provided by cotton.
	
✓	Linen and silk: Linen creases easily while silk doesn’t. By adding silk 
to linen, a garment won’t crease as readily and will drape better.
	
✓	Spandex and cotton: Spandex is stretchy and durable, and cotton 
lets your skin breathe. The two make a perfect combination for sports 
clothing.
	
✓	Cotton, polyester, and rayon: Cotton offers breathability, polyester 
strength, and rayon shininess. A fabric with all three offers durability, 
ultra-softness, and excellent resilience so that if wrinkled, the fabric 
bounces back.

 Chapter 4: Fundamentals on Fabrics and Garment Construction
How fabrics are made
To get the different types of fabrics used to make clothing, the fibers have 
to be turned into threads or yarns and then woven or knit together. Which 
fibers (or combination of fibers) are used and how they’re put together deter­
mine what type of fabric is made. The higher quality fibers used, the better 
the quality of the fabric and (provided that the fabrics are designed and sewn 
together well) the better the overall quality of the final garment.
Step 1: The making of the thread
Since natural fibers are originally “manufactured” by Mother Nature, they don’t 
necessarily come in the appropriate format for making cloth, which is why they 
have to be fabricated. The natural length of a fiber, say the wool that comes off 
of a sheep, is called the staple. The staples are then twisted together to make 
the thread or cloth that’s needed for turning out actual fabric. Manmade fibers, 
on the other hand, come out of the manufacturing process as threads, as they 
are mostly chemicals spun together using various processes.
Step 2: Knitting or weaving the threads together
Fibers are manipulated in several different ways to make clothing. The first 
is knitting, which involves using hooks to loop the yarns together. You may 
be most familiar with the type of hand knitting that people do at home with a 
single set of needles, but knitting machines can produce much more sophis­
ticated fabrics. Fabrics in the jersey family, for example, are knitted. Knitted 
fabrics have more stretch than woven fabrics.
Weaving is the most common form of making fabric. A woven fabric is made 
by interlacing threads of one or more types of material. Originally weaving 
was done by hand, but then the loom was invented and simplified the pro­
cess. Today, computerized looms can produce amazing designs. Following 
are the most common weave designs, as shown in Figure 4-1:
	
✓	The plain weave: Early woven patterns were plain, with one set of threads 
going over and under the other set. The technical term for the yarn going 
over is the warp yarn; the term for the yarn going under is the weft yarn. 
The plain weave is still used today in the making of chiffon and taffeta.
	
✓	The twill weave: In the twill weave, the weft yarn passes over at least 
two but not more than four warp yarns, moving one step to the left or 
right with each line. The corded effect produced in twilled fabric greatly 
adds to the fabric’s durability. Some examples of twill weaves include 
denim and gabardine.
	
✓	The satin weave: The satin weave is similar to the twill except the warp 
yarn passes over four to eight weft yarns, yielding the characteristic 
sheen of satin cloth.

72
Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment Construction, Fabrics, and Color 
Figure 4-1: Three common weaves: plain, twill, and satin.
Some other common weaves include the rib weave, which has a higher 
concentration of yarn going in one direction to produce broadcloth 
and poplin; pile weave, which forms loops used to make terrycloth; and 
dobby and jacquard weaves, which combine various weaves to make 
patterns.
	
Make sure you understand the difference between weaves and fibers. Many 
different fibers can be woven to make satin, including silk, polyester, acetate, 
or even a blend. So if you’re looking for a satin blouse, don’t make the mistake 
of thinking that all satin is the same, because while the weave is the same, 
the fibers that are woven together to make satin can be different.
Step 3: Finishing
The last step in making fabric is finishing. A finish can add many types 
of effects, changing the appearance and texture. For example, flocking, 
which uses adhesives to add material, produces a fuzzy texture. Other 
finishes add water repellency, moth resistance, flame resistance, or pilling 
resistance.

73
 Chapter 4: Fundamentals on Fabrics and Garment Construction
	
Understanding how your clothing is made allows you to choose garments that 
are well-constructed, keep their appearance, and are easy to maintain. If 
you’re buying a trendy item that you don’t plan to wear for more than a 
season, you can use this information to your benefit as well — that is, don’t 
buy a trendy item in one of the more expensive fabrics because it’s a garment 
you don’t plan to wear for years to come. But again, if you’re purchasing a 
quality piece for your wardrobe, you want to make sure that you’re making an 
investment in a quality fabric that can stand the test of time.
From smooth to rough: Texture
Texture, the surface appearance of a fabric, is a result of the type of fibers 
used in the manufacturing process and the weave or knit. Texture is the one 
element you can both see and feel. Texture is defined by the thickness and 
appearance of a fabric, and words that describe texture include furry, soft, 
shiny, rough, smooth, and sheer.
In general, the more dressed up you’re going to be, the more likely the tex­
ture of your clothing is going to feel soft to the touch. And because most 
manmade fabrics can’t match Mother Nature when it comes to the combina­
tion of softness and durability (think of how strong the light threads of the 
silkworm are when woven together into cloth), natural fabrics are considered 
more luxurious than manmade fabrics.
When considering a garment, be aware of the effect the texture has on your 
overall look:
	
✓	Textures that make you look bigger: Some textures — shiny textures 
that reflect light, or thick and bulky textures, for example — make you 
appear bigger in a garment. Stiff fabrics do the same. In order to avoid 
looking bigger, try matte fabrics and smoother, less bulky materials. 
Finishing touches from ancient times to today
While finishing may seem like a new technique, 
and most of the finishes added today are quite 
new, the Chinese were known to flock cloth in 
the year 1,000 BC, though for decorative pur­
poses only.
In recent years, a new attribute to clothing 
has been resistance to the damage the sun’s 
UV rays can have on the skin. By using a high 
thread count, often with some chemical finish­
ing as well, some fabrics can offer a degree 
of protection against UV ray penetration. Of 
course, the garment can only protect the body 
part it’s actually covering.

74
Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment Construction, Fabrics, and Color 
Also, don’t wear fabrics that are too stiff, such as coarse tweed. Figure 4-2 
shows the difference between a matte fabric and a shiny one.
	
	If you’re petite, you may not want to buy clothing with a very coarse 
fabric, because while it may add to your size, the coarse look may also 
overwhelm your small figure.
	
✓	Textures that make you look thinner: Fabrics that have smooth, flat 
surfaces and a dull or matte surface that absorbs light can make you 
appear thinner. These fabrics include matte jersey and cashmere.
Soft or clingy fabrics show the shape underneath the garment, which may or 
may not be something you want. While they don’t increase your size as far 
as width or breadth, they do show every curve, so if you don’t want to draw 
any added attention to your hips or rear, avoid these materials, too. Opt for 
something with a bit more structure.
Figure 4-2: Matte (left) versus shiny (right) can alter your appearance.

75
 Chapter 4: Fundamentals on Fabrics and Garment Construction
Transparent versus opaque
While most of the material used to make clothes is opaque, that is, what lies 
underneath it cannot be seen, that’s not true of all cloth. Transparent cloth is 
also used in clothing. Transparent fabrics are light and flowing, and they give 
a very feminine look.
	
Unless the transparent garment is a piece of lingerie, the wearer usually has 
some other item of clothing underneath, like a flesh-colored bra under a sheer 
blouse to maintain whatever degree of modesty is desired. What you wear 
underneath depends on where you are as well as your level of modesty. If 
you’re going out on the town, you may choose to wear no more than a bra. 
While in the office, a camisole would be more appropriate (see Figure 4-3).
Figure 4-3: Where you’re going dictates how much layering you do.

Key Features of a Garment
Knowing about fibers, fabrics, and weights is only part of the information you 
need to be a savvy shopper. You also need to know about garment construction. 
Even if you never buy a hand-sewn designer gown for thousands of dollars, you 
still need to know what to look for when buying a piece that fits your budget.
Stitching
Most stitching is utilitarian and not something you need to concern your­
self with — except when it’s not done well and the garment falls apart while 
you’re wearing it (at which point you’ll have learned the hard way to appreci­
ate good stitching).
The basic stitch is called the straight stitch. Other types of stitching include
	
✓	Zigzag: A stitch used for garments that require some stretch. One stitch 
goes left and the next right. 
	
✓	Baste: A simple stitch used to just hold pieces of cloth together before 
final sewing.
	
✓	Buttonhole: A stitch used to make buttonholes.
	
✓	Back: A stitch in which the thread is sewn backward as compared to 
other threads to outline decoration.
In general, stitching (unless it’s decorative) isn’t supposed to be noticeable 
because its function is merely to hold the garment together. While stitching 
often does not add to a garment’s appearance, you can often figure out a gar­
ment’s overall quality — and know whether you’re paying a good price for it — 
by checking the stitching. Some things to look for are
	
✓	How many stitches there are per inch: The more stitching per inch, the 
stronger the garment. Sixteen to 20 stitches per inch defines the high-
end. Of course, some stitching is merely decorative, such as the type 
you may see made into a pattern on the back pocket of a pair of jeans.
	
✓	Whether it’s machine sewn or hand sewn: While machine stitching is 
usually acceptable, in some cases, where attention to detail is demanded, 
hand sewing is superior. If a garment’s label indicates that some hand 
sewing took place in its creation, you can be sure that it’s a quality item, 
since hand sewing takes a lot more effort and costs more to produce. At 
the other end of the spectrum, instead of stitching the pieces of fabric 
together, the pieces may be fused together, a less expensive method of 
production and one not guaranteed to last very long.

77
 Chapter 4: Fundamentals on Fabrics and Garment Construction
	
✓	The type of thread used. The threads used can be made from various 
materials. Silk threads are strong yet thin, providing the very best 
stitching. Cotton threads are next in line, and synthetic threads can per­
form their job well even though they’re not quite as good quality 
as cotton.
	
Another way to spot a piece that may not be well-constructed is to look on 
the inside for seams where the stitching is most apparent. Check to see 
whether the stitching looks neat and the ends are tied off. If you see a lot of 
loose threads, then you know this garment is not of the highest quality. 
Seams
The seam is where two pieces of a garment are stitched together. Major 
seams are hidden away inside the garment (as opposed to hems, which are 
seams at the base of edges, such as at the bottom of a skirt, and can’t be 
hidden completely). Note that this isn’t true in some articles of clothing, like 
jeans, where the seams are part of the overall look.
Because most seams are hidden, they’re not usually made to look pretty. 
French seams are an exception (see Figure 4-4). These seams are doubled 
over so that, if visible, they appear a lot neater. (French seams won’t work 
where the material is too bulky, however, because the folded over material 
makes too much of a bump.)
Figure 4-4: A French seam.

78
Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment Construction, Fabrics, and Color 
To learn more about the quality of a piece of clothing, do the following when 
you’re looking at seams:
	
✓	Check how tightly knit and strong the thread is. If the seam appears 
to be tightly knit together with strong thread, that’s the sign of a better 
quality garment. But if the spacing between the threads is wide and the 
thread looks weak, you can be sure the manufacturer was cutting cor­
ners, and the seam is probably not the only place.
	
✓	Give the seam a good tug. This gives you some solid evidence of the 
care that went into its construction.
	
✓	If there’s a lose thread, pull on it. It may just be some extra material, 
and nothing will happen except that it will pull away. But if the seam 
starts to unravel when you pull on the thread, put that garment back 
and start looking for another one.
	
✓	Pay particular attention to curved seams. Curved seams are used when 
two curved pieces of cloth must come together, such as when attaching 
sleeves to the body of a shirt or jacket. While many people learn to sew a 
simple plain seam in order to make hems, mastering the curved seam is 
more difficult and a poorly made jacket may not have the proper curved 
seams where they’re required. Figure 4-5 shows a well-sewn curved seam 
compared to a poorly sewn one.
	
✓	See how much extra material is at the seam. On a regular pair of pants, 
you’ll notice that there’s extra material at the waist seam. This extra material 
is there so that the seam can be let out. Better quality clothing usually has 
more material to allow for such alterations. (Note: The seams on jeans, called 
flat felled seams, don’t provide this extra material. This type of seam was 
originally used because jeans were considered work pants and the flat felled 
seam is very strong. The disadvantage is that there is no extra material.)

 Chapter 4: Fundamentals on Fabrics and Garment Construction
Making the cut
One of the most important elements in making clothes is the cut — how 
the finished product is put together. The cut not only affects the garment’s 
appearance but also its comfort. In an expensive jacket, for example, the 
design calls for a curve where the arms get attached to the body of the jacket 
to accommodate the way your arm moves; you’ll notice the difference both 
in the jacket’s appearance and how it feels. In a less expensive jacket, the cut 
is straight up and down. Not only does it not look as good as the more expen­
sive jacket, but it feels even worse as material hits under your arm instead of 
flowing around it.
You find such differences in almost every type of garment, from expensive 
designer gowns to blue jeans. In better quality jeans, for example, the two legs 
are separate units and the last seam is around the crotch. In less expensive 
jeans, the legs are part of the front and back and the last seam is up and down 
the inside of the leg. The first method gives you a much better and more com­
fortable fit. Figure 4-6 compares a well cut jean with a poorly cut jean.
Figure 4-6: The proper cut (right) makes all the difference in the appearance 
of a garment.

Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment Construction, Fabrics, and Color 
If you’ve always wondered how a particular item of clothing can cost so 
much, it’s worth going to a high-end store and trying on some designer pieces 
(even if you never plan on buying anything). Often, you’ll see how different 
the fit and feel actually are.
Mixing and Matching Fabrics
Here’s the thing about mixing and matching fabrics: You can as long as it 
looks right. The following sections have the details.
	
Fashion rules aren’t just arbitrary edicts sent down from above. Instead, 
they’re based on a common denominator: what looks right and what doesn’t. 
While not everybody agrees on these rules, the vast majority of people do find 
certain looks pleasing and others unpleasant. Using this as a guide certainly 
makes it easier for you to choose your outfit each day.
A word about weight
In the fashion world, weight refers to the thickness of the thread. The thicker 
the thread used, the heavier the cloth that is woven from it. In most cases, 
especially when comparing very similar fabrics, the heavier a fabric is, the 
more material it contains, the higher the quality, and the more it costs. The 
difference in weight is sometimes more apparent in the simplest of garments. 
If you have a choice between two cotton T-shirts and you’re wondering why 
one is a lot more expensive than the other, pick each one up and compare 
their weights. Odds are that the heavier one, which has more cotton threads 
per square inch, is the more expensive one.
Three standards for measuring weight are ounces per linear yard, ounces per 
square yard, and grams per square meter. It’s important to know which unit 
is being used when being given the weight of a cloth because something that 
would be lightweight in one would be heavyweight in another. In the United 
States and Asia, fabric weight is more likely to be given in ounces, while in 
Europe it’s grams.
In addition to using weight as an indication of quality, there are also practical 
aspects to choosing the weight of a garment. While you may want a suit with 
extra weight in winter to keep you warm, in summer you’ll choose lighter 
weight material.

81
 Chapter 4: Fundamentals on Fabrics and Garment Construction
	
You can certainly combine weights of clothing, but you don’t want the con­
trast to be too great. For example, you wouldn’t wear summer weight linen 
pants with a thick wool sweater. Basically, you want to make sure the two fab­
rics are meant for the same season. So while you wouldn’t pair heavy wool 
with linen, you can pair heavy wool with corduroy (see Figure 4-7). Use your 
common sense. The reason you wear these fabrics when you do is generally 
to keep warm in winter or cool in the summer.
Figure 4-7: A bad pairing (left) and a good pairing (right).

82
Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment Construction, Fabrics, and Color 
Pairing patterns
Don’t be afraid to pair patterns. You can find many ways to make this work. 
The biggest key is to keep everything in the same color family. If you’re going 
to wear two different patterns, the colors have to match (see Chapter 5 for 
more on color). The other thing to remember when pairing different pat­
terns is balance. If one print or pattern is big and bold, make sure the other 
one is small. If you’re just starting out, and not sure exactly how this works, 
start with something small: Pair a patterned blouse with a printed scarf and a 
solid pant or skirt. Just make sure all the colors in the blouse and scarf work 
together and that the pattern on one of the pieces is small, if the other is 
large.
It’s a bit easier to see what to avoid when you examine extremes. Wearing 
two bold patterns, say polka dots with stripes, certainly risks causing a visual 
clash. But what about two stripes? It depends on the stripes. Do the colors 
compliment each other? Are the stripes the same size or is one set wider than 
the other? Do they go in the same direction? Obviously the combinations are 
endless, and I can’t possibly go over all of them, so to some extent you have to 
develop your own eye and learn to trust it. But here are some rules that you 
can use to help you combine stripes:
	
✓	Make sure they’re not the same size, which creates too much tension. 
If one stripe is a lot broader than the other, then they can work together, 
assuming the color combinations also work. If your patterns don’t 
match, better to pair with a solid, as Figure 4-8 shows.
	
✓	Keep everything else in your outfit simple. If you’re going to combine 
two stripes, anything else has to be simple and in neutral tones so as not 
to make the whole effect far too busy.
The same concept holds true for checks, with one caveat: Because checks 
are more intense, you have to be even more careful when wearing two differ­
ent checks. Wearing two different checks of similar size is disorienting to the 
viewer’s eye. But if you have one small check, like a houndstooth pattern, a 
larger check can work, though their colors would have to complement each 
other.

83
 Chapter 4: Fundamentals on Fabrics and Garment Construction
Figure 4-8: A mismatched outfit (left); a better alternative (right).
When it comes to combining patterns, like stripes and checks, it’s best if one 
of the two is on an accessory item (see Figure 4-9). You can pair a jacket with 
checks, for example, with a striped scarf, as long as the colors complement 

84
Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment Construction, Fabrics, and Color 
each other. But you wouldn’t want to wear a 
striped skirt with a checked blouse. Yikes! You 
also need to consider the scale of each pattern. 
Again, you don’t want the scale and colors to 
match too closely because then the look is dis­
cordant. Instead, choose scales that contrast 
one another: If one pattern is small, like narrow 
stripes set far apart, then the checks can be 
more dense and larger.
FFP
	
If you’re thinking of combining three patterns, 
don’t. Unless you really know what you’re doing, 
three different patterns can easily come off look­
ing way too busy. For the most part, picking one 
pattern or item to accentuate is the way to go.

working together well.

Dress to be happy. 
Betsey Johnson, Fashion Designer
“W
hat’s your favorite color?” How many times has your daughter, 
niece, or nephew asked you that question? No matter our age, 
we all have favorite colors. I love white and always gravitate toward a white 
dress, T-shirt, or jeans. But the truth is that your favorite color may not be 
what looks best on you. Your hair, eyes, and skin tone all play a 
part in selecting colors that belong in your closet.
This chapter explains how to use colors to highlight the 
parts of your body you love and camouflage the ones 
you don’t. Also, if you’re challenged in the what-­
colors-go-with-what department, I guide you through 
that as well.
Color Wheel Basics
If you’ve ever looked at a rainbow (and I’m sure 
you have), you know that colors appear in a natural 
order. This is called the color spectrum. Designers like to 
show the color spectrum in a wheel (like the ones shown 
in Figure 5-1). It turns out there’s a practical reason for doing 
so: Not only are there visual effects when specific colors are compared 
to colors adjacent to them on the color spectrum, but there are also visual 
effects when a color is compared to the one opposite itself on the color 
wheel.

You may think it’s a coincidence that suddenly some colors are very in, but 
it’s not. An organization called the Color Marketing Group  pulls in experts 
from different fields — fashion, interior design, and so on — and decides what 
the popular colors are going to be two years from now.
Color designations: Primary, secondary, 
and tertiary
Colors fall into the following three categories (refer to Figure 5-1):
	
✓	Primary: The three primary colors are red, blue, and yellow.
	
✓	Secondary: When you mix the primary colors in specific combinations, 
you get the secondary colors: purple (red and blue mixed), green (blue 
and yellow), and orange (red and yellow). If the mixture is not exactly 
50 percent of one primary color and 50 percent of another, you get 
shades of these colors.
	
✓	Tertiary: To make a tertiary color, you mix two colors adjacent to one 
other on the color wheel. If you mix blue with green, for example, you 
get the tertiary color blue-green; mix green with yellow, and you get 
yellow-green.

87
 Chapter 5: The Art of Color
Analogous and complimentary colors
When it comes to fashion, you need to know how colors are perceived when 
they’re together so that you can combine them correctly when you get 
dressed. For example, primary and secondary colors that are neighbors to 
one another are said to be analogous. So the colors analogous to green are 
yellow and blue. Orange’s analogous colors are red and yellow. When worn 
together, analogous colors tend to subdue each other and therefore work 
well together.
Colors that sit opposite from each other on the 
color wheel are considered to be complimen­
tary colors, so blue’s complimentary color is 
orange and purple’s is yellow. Complimentary 
colors make each other stand out more, so 
they appear bolder than they do when alone. 
Figure 5-2 shows how lavender (a lighter shade 
of purple) and pale yellow compliment each 
other in an outfit.
Analogous colors almost always go well with 
one another. Complimentary colors can also 
go together if you want to make a bold state­
ment. Keep in mind, though, that complimen­
tary color combinations (like red and green 
or blue and orange) can be more difficult to 
put together. Colors that may compete in their 
strongest hues can go well together in softer 
tones. Similarly, using shades of these colors, 
especially one darker and one lighter (baby 
blue with orange, for example) can work. If 
your skin tone is darker or you have a tan, you 
can get away with brighter colors.
	
There really are no strict rules with this; you 
just have to try different versions of color 
combinations and see what works. Be adven­
turous if you have a knack for what looks good 
(running it by a friend you trust is also not a 
bad idea).
	
If you mix complimentary colors, make sure 
you choose the right accessories to tie the 
whole outfit together. Neutrals are a good 
choice because they frame, but don’t compete 
with, the strong colors in the outfit.
Figure 5-2: A good way to pair 
complimentary colors.

Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment Construction, Fabrics, and Color 
Black and white: The noncolors
So what about black and white? Technically, black and white are not really 
colors (even though many people call them colors). Black is the absence of 
color while white is the sum of all the color of light.
Because they’re not actual colors, they can work well with each other, with 
any other colors, or by themselves. When using black and white, you really 
don’t have to worry about whether two garments go well together because 
they almost always do.
	
The mandate to not wear white after Labor Day is antiquated. Basically dif­
ferent shades of white and ivory can work all year long, with each other, or 
mixed with other colors (although if you’re going to wear all white, I suggest 
waiting until the warmer months). In the winter, a pair of white jeans with a 
bulky sweater and boots is fab. Black can work all year, too, even though in 
summer, you’ll want to mix it up with some color. When wearing black, be 
careful to stay away from non-matching items. The shade of black should be 
exact when pairing them together.
Color Categories: Jewels, 
Neutrals, and More
Colors are often sorted into groups based on similar characteristics. Knowing 
what group each color belongs to helps you choose the right combination 
when putting together your outfit. For example, jewel tones are very rich 
colors; therefore, they’re generally worn in the fall and winter. Neutrals, 
because they can be paired with just about anything, are perfect to wear 
with strong colors (to provide balance) or with other neutrals (to create 
a more subdued look). The following sections describe the most common 
color categories.
Jewel tones
Jewel tone colors, shown in Figure 5-3, are associated with various gem­
stones: emerald green, ruby red, topaz yellow, amythest purple, and sapphire 
blue, for example. Jewel tones have a high level of color saturation, making 
them very bold and lush. You’re most likely to find jewel tones in stores in 
the fall and around the holidays. They’re particularly appropriate during the 
holidays because they add a festive feature to your wardrobe.

89
 Chapter 5: The Art of Color
If you want to wear jewel tones, keep these points in mind:
	
✓	Be careful that you don’t pair two jewel tones in the same outfit. 
Because these colors are so strong, they are best on their own. Pair 
a jewel tone top with black slacks, dark denim jeans, or another dark 
neutral such as brown to balance out the look.
	
✓	Make sure the jewel tone compliments your hair color and skin tone. 
Brunettes and those with black hair can carry off jewel tones better than 
blondes and those with paler hair and skin tones. The vibrancy of jewel 
tones tend to make people with lighter hair and skin look washed out.

Neutrals
Neutral colors — black, white, brown, beige, and gray (see Figure 5-4) — 
are really shades without color, and they’re the linchpin colors of a classic 
woman’s wardrobe. When combined with other colors, neutral shades put 
the focus on the other colors and, depending on the combination, can serve 
to tone the other color down or make it stand out.

Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment Construction, Fabrics, and Color 
Black
Black is slimming. It’s also sophisticated, elegant, and chic (yet another 
reason everyone should have the perfect LBD!). Black makes a good back­
ground color because primary colors really stand out when paired with it.
Gray
Gray is the most neutral of neutrals and goes well with any other color. Gray 
comes in various shades. Lighter grays work well with lighter colors, such as 
pastels. Darker grays work well with bolder colors like red and blue. You can 
also substitute darker gray for black.
White
White is pure and dazzling and goes with absolutely everything, just as black 
does. White and black are great together too. While black is slimming, white 
tends to show more of your body because of the way it reflects light, so keep 
this in mind if you’re trying to camouflage a certain body part.
Brown
Brown is a warm, neutral color. As a neutral, brown goes well with all colors. 
You’re more likely to wear dark brown in fall and winter, and a lighter brown 
in spring and summer. Browns can also be paired with each other in such 
combinations as camel and chocolate, tan and gold, and auburn and coffee.
Beige
Beige is the true neutral color and goes with anything. It has a bit of the warmth 
of brown and the coolness of white. Beige can warm up a color, like blue, with­
out overpowering it. If you have lighter skin and want to wear a lot of beige, 
make sure you throw in an accent color to add a pop of life to your overall look.
Pastels
Pastels are lighter shades of basic colors: baby pink, light blue, lavender, pale 
yellow, and mint green (see Figure 5-5). Pastels work well with navy blue, 
kelly green, and white — colors that tend to appear in preppie wardrobes. If 
you have a lot of pastel pieces in your wardrobe, keep the following in mind:
	
✓	They have a youthful quality. Too many pastels can make you look too 
cutesy (after all, babies are often dressed in pastels).
	
✓	They work well with neutral colors. The best colors to match with 
­pastels are those in the neutral family — camel, gray, beige, and tan. 
These colors give pastels an appearance of being stronger than they 
actually are.

91
 Chapter 5: The Art of Color
	
✓	They are more appropriate for spring wear. Lighter weight spring 
clothing often comes in pastel colors.
	
✓	If you’re fair skinned and want to wear pastels, you need to pair it 
with a stronger color. A light purple blouse with a deep grey skirt, for 
example, is beautifully chic. For a more casual look, a pair of dark jeans 
with a pale yellow polo is also classic.

Earth tones
Earth tones, shown in Figure 5-6, are aptly named because they include the 
browns of the earth, from sand to dark brown (some people include other 
muted colors in the earth tone category, but I stick to browns in this discus­
sion.) Earth tones are very common in clothing that has a bohemian style. 
They differ from the neutral colors, such as white, gray, and black, which 
tend to be cooler and more stark. Earth tones are softer and warmer.
Like neutrals, earth tones can be paired with anything. Since the undertones 
are the brown family, which is considered a “warm” color, they’re flattering 
on all skin tones.
	
If you want another color in your outfit to stand out, pair it with a paler earth 
tone such as sand. If you want to balance and tone down a stronger, darker 
color, pair it with chocolate brown.

Choosing the right colors for you
You’ve all heard someone say, “That color looks great on you!” Well, there’s a 
reason. Some colors work really well with your skin tone and even hair color. 
You can tell which colors best flatter you by just holding up a few different col­
ored tops below your face to see which ones make you look brighter and which 
ones wash you out. Too many combinations of skin tones, hair colors, and cloth­
ing colors exist to cover them all here, so in this section I focus on the basics to 
get you started (see Table 5-1 for a quick list of flattering combinations).

Dark colors: A busy mother’s best friend
If you’re a woman who gets up before dawn 
and doesn’t stop moving until after dusk, I’ve 
got your number. If you have children, in addi­
tion to wearing comfortable fabrics (think terry 
or cotton), you probably dress in dark colors to 
avoid accidents (which likely occur throughout 
the day!) showing up on your outfit.
Well, you can still look good while managing busy 
schedules and babies that spit up. A dark jogging 
suit (provided it’s a 10 — see Chapter 2) can take 
you through the day looking casually chic. Dark 
colors can also make a bold statement when 
you finish your errands and are off to dinner. You 
can never go wrong with a little black dress, and 
combining darker colors definitely gives you a 
dramatic look.
Don’t be afraid to combine black and navy, black 
and brown, navy and brown, or gray with black, 
navy, or brown. These color combinations are 
actually very chic. By discovering how to mix 
and match colors you wouldn’t normally pair 
together, you can triple the number of outfits in 
your closet.

93
 Chapter 5: The Art of Color
Warm and cool colors
All colors are considered either warm or cool. Colors with red 
undertones are warm, and colors with blue undertones are 
cool. If you have darker or olive color skin, warm tones are 
going to be more flattering. So colors on the warm end of the 
spectrum like reds, oranges, pinks, peaches, and yellows (pro­
vided they don’t have blue undertones) are better for you, as 
is anything in the brown family (see Figure 5-7).
Just because you have fairer skin 
doesn’t mean you can’t wear the colors 
on the warm end of the spectrum. You 
just have to be careful with the tone of 
the color. For example, a woman with 
fair skin can wear pink; it should just 
be a pink with blue undertones, as in 
Figure 5-8.
If you have fair, medium, or even pale 
skin, cooler colors are going to flatter 
you. Coolers colors — such as greens, 
blues, purples, and grays — are at 
the other end of the spectrum from 
warmer colors. Something like an ice 
blue top works well on someone with 
fairer skin (see Figure 5-9).
Figure 5-7: This outfit has 
warm, earth tones, perfect 
for darker skin.

blue undertones flatters

Figure 5-9: Cool, pastel colors 
compliment fair skin.
Figure 5-10: A warm pink acces­
sory and earth tones flatter dark

Considering hair color and make up
The other thing to consider when choosing your 
clothing is hair color. If you have brown or dark 
brown/black hair, warmer colors are going to look 
better on you. If you have blond, red, or gray hair, 
cooler colors look good. For example, someone with 
brown hair looks better in red, while a blond or red­
head looks better in green.
Most often, unless you 
dye your hair or wear 
a lot of makeup, people 
with darker hair tend 
to have darker or olive 
skin complexions and 
women with blond or 
red hair tend to have 
fairer skin. So accent­
ing with warmer colors, 
like the warm pink scarf 
in Figure 5-10, works 
on someone with dark 
hair and dark skin.
	
You can always use 
makeup as a tool to 
enhance or change your 
skin tone, and you can 
also change your hair 
color if you want to 
change your color pal­
ette as far as what you 
choose to wear. You’re 
not locked in to specific 
colors, although as you 
get a feel for what looks 
good on you, you’ll 
want to stick to the pal­
ette that’s most flatter­
ing for you.

95
 Chapter 5: The Art of Color
Making Your Color Choices Work for You
Your personality, body type, and personal style are going to determine what 
colors you choose to wear. As long as you understand which colors work 
together and how to use them to flatter your figure, feel free to experiment 
with combinations you may not have tried before. You may just find a whole 
new wardrobe right in your closet!
Pairing colors
The primary colors (red, blue, and yellow) in the brightest shades can be 
hard to match because their intensities are high in and of themselves. When 
you pair one primary color with another, the intensity is multiplied and the 
combination can be too much. However, the primaries, like all colors, have 
different shades. So where a cherry red may be hard to match with anything 
but a neutral, a brick red may be less overpowering (any muted primary 
color is less overpowering).
Following are some other examples of ways to use primary and secondary 
colors without being overwhelmed by the effect:
	
✓	Yellow: A bright yellow can be quite difficult to match, but a pastel 
shade blends nicely with most colors, both analogous and complimen­
tary. If you’re partial to bright yellow, use it as an accent color. Or if you 
want to use it as the primary color of an outfit, make sure that the rest of 
the outfit is more subdued (it’s always safe to pair with white).
	
✓	Green: When it comes to the many shades of green, go with one that 
looks good on you. If you’re not comfortable wearing bright green, try a 
subtler shade, like fir green or mint green, instead. A subdued green can 
go with many other colors, but I’d stay away from pairing it with red, 
regardless of the shade, unless, of course, it’s Christmas (even then some 
basic rules exist; see Chapter 12 for tips on dressing for the holidays).
	
✓	Purple: Because purple is such a strong color, it works best when paired 
with a pale shade of another color. A lighter shade of purple gives you 
more leeway when pairing it with other colors. A pale yellow paired 
with a brighter purple, for example, can be beautiful during springtime.

96
Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment Construction, Fabrics, and Color 
	
✓	Blue: Blue is another strong color. For a 
bright, royal blue, you follow the same rules 
as with the other bright colors: Pair it with 
a neutral color or something more toned 
down. Because most denim clothing is blue, 
we tend to think it matches everything, but 
this is only true with lighter and darker 
shades of blue, as they are toned down 
already and can be paired with most colors.
FFP
	
So what goes with blue jeans? Almost anything 
you can name. The only thing that doesn’t go 
with denim? Denim. I don’t care what magazines 
say it’s the latest trend; unless you’re taking a 
time machine back to the 1980s, denim and 
denim (see Figure 5-11) don’t go together. Ever!
	
Brighter colors and pastels tend to be worn in 
spring and summer, and the more muted and 
subdued shades are worn in fall and winter.
Combining colorful 
­patterns
You can combine colorful patterns as long as 
you don’t combine colorful patterns that don’t 
match. Pairing patterns is tricky in and of itself. 
You can pair patterns as discussed in Chapter 4, 
but when you throw color into the mix, the 
color scheme has to match (see Figure 5-12). 
The items need to be in the exact same color 
family or one has to be a print in a neutral color 
scheme.
If each pattern has a dominant color, make sure those two dominant colors 
are the same. The colors must match exactly when pairing patterns. This 
pairing should look like it came together from the same designer. In fact, 
pairing items from the same designer is about the only way to ensure that all 
the colors and patterns aren’t too busy. Plus, it’s rare to find an exact match 
when pairing pieces from different designers’ collections.

Using color to impact 
your mood
Studies have shown that color can have psy­
chological effects. Yellow, for example, is said 
to help concentration, pink is supposed to 
make you seem more approachable, and red is 
an attention-getter.
It’s also said that colors affect your mood. Wear 
too much black, for example, and you may find 
yourself feeling sad. Still, no scientific study has 
proved any such link between color and a par­
ticular effect, and because colors have different 
meanings around the world, these theories are 
far from proven.
Matching mood to color
While no scientific study makes a direct 
link between what wearing one color versus 
another may do for your state of mind, or 
how the color you wear influences those 
around you, simple observation tells you 
that a lady dressed all in red is going to draw 
the eye’s attention first over someone dressed 
in muted tones. While not carved in stone, 
there are appropriate colors for certain 
situations:
	
✓	For somber occasions: Black is obviously 
acceptable. You can also wear navy, dark 
browns, and gray.
	
✓	For serious occasions: When you’re going for a job interview, keep 
your color palette on the more subdued side even though the days of 
wearing simple black pant suits with a button-down blouse are over. A 
black pencil skirt with a classic sweater set and beautiful necklace (see 
Figure 5-13) is appropriate and highlights your personal style.

when pairing patterns.

✓	For celebratory events: When you’re attend­
ing an occasion that calls for celebration, like 
a baby shower or graduation party, bring out 
your bright colors. When attending an event 
that invites you to have fun, have fun — even 
with your clothing!
Getting a mood boost from your favorite color
To a certain degree, how a color affects your mood 
can enhance its ability to camouflage problem 
areas. You’d be surprised that black is not the only 
color that can hide a problem area. Some larger 
women, for example, tend not to wear red because 
they feel it attracts too much attention to their 
bodies. But red is also a color that exudes confi­
dence. It’s the ultimate power color. If red’s your 
favorite color, find ways to wear it while still flatter­
ing your figure. For example, if you’re a pear shape, 
wear a red top with a darker bottom. This combina­
tion attracts attention to your upper half, allows 
you to wear a color you love, and camouflages an 
area you want to minimize.
	
Get the best of both worlds. Combine the natural 
slimming effects of wearing dark colors with the 
brightening effect of wearing your favorite brighter 
colors. If you prefer a bright color but don’t think it 
flatters your figure, use the bright color as an 
accent. You can use accents in so many different 
ways: shoes, belts, handbags, scarves, jewelry, and 
so on. Chapter 15 tells you how to accessorize.
Figure 5-13: Muted colors 
are good for job interviews.

 Chapter 5: The Art of Color
Camouflaging with color
Creating color combinations that camouflage is an art form per­
fected by the military, but the traditional military pattern is not 
the only way to use color to camouflage. Many people who try to 
hide their problem areas turn immediately to black and for good 
reason. Not only is black slimming; it’s also chic. But you don’t 
have to wear all black all the time. It isn’t the only color that you 
can use for camouflage. Consider these examples on how to flat­
ter your figure:
Figure 5-14: The same 
color on the top and the 
bottom creates a slimmer 
line.
Figure 5-15: Contrasting colors on 
the top and bottom make you look 
more petite.
	
✓	Wearing all one color 
makes you appear taller. 
A monochromatic outfit 
helps anyone — from 
petite to plus-size — 
­project a longer, leaner 
look, which makes you 
appear taller and slimmer 
(see Figure 5-14).
	
✓	Wearing colors that 
are in stark contrast to 
one another make you 
appear shorter. If you’re 
tall and want to appear 
shorter, wear contrasting 
colors on the top and the 
bottom. The two colors 
break up the one long line 
(see Figure 5-15).
	
✓	Wearing any color of 
narrow, vertical stripes 
makes you look thinner. 
The thinner the stripe, 
the more pronounced the 
slimming effect.

Color meanings
The fashion world talks a lot about the psycho­
logical meanings of color. Here’s what propo­
nents of this theory hold to be true. First, colors 
on the red side of the color wheel are generally 
considered to be the warm colors, while those 
on the blue side are the cool ones. While psy­
chologists differ on the importance of color, 
there’s some agreement on the following points:
	✓	Red depicts strength and courage.
	✓	Blue is cooler and more intellectual.
	✓	Yellow is the emotional color and gives off 
confidence and optimism.
	✓	Green, because it’s in the center of the 
color spectrum, is the color of balance and 
harmony.
	✓	Purple is the spiritual color leading to 
introspection.
	✓	Black is both sophisticated and menacing.
	✓	White is hygienic, which can stand for good 
health or sterility.

ights, camera, action! Fashion Week in New York City 
is a twice-a-year extravaganza in the heart of the Big 
Apple. (There are also other “Fashion Weeks” that take 
place in cities like Paris and Milan.) Every fashion 
editor, fashionista, and celebrity is looking for a 
front-row seat to the hottest shows — not to men­
tion a ticket to the chicest parties! Although much 
of what is unveiled during Fashion Week is just for 
show (the more dramatic the better), the events 
are still a great place for you to educate yourself on 
upcoming trends and get new ideas for how to put 
outfits together.
The designers try to catch the attention of the buyers, 
editors, and fashion media so the wilder and edgier the 
show, the more attention they get. For the most part, the 
clothing that actually gets produced is a toned-down version of 

102
Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment Construction, Fabrics, and Color 
what was seen on the runway. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t learn any­
thing by examining these outfits. This chapter helps you take the looks from 
the runway to your closet. 
From Designer to Mass Market 
There isn’t an article of clothing in existence that wasn’t designed by some­
body. It could be a creative individual designing for herself, or a profes­
sional designing for some segment of the market. Perhaps the design bears 
the designer’s name, or perhaps it is someone designing for someone else’s 
label. But even simple white T-shirts require the creative juices of a designer 
because someone has to pick out the exact cloth, choose the neckline, the 
length of the sleeves, and so on.
Getting any piece of clothing made takes a variety of steps, whether the gar­
ment is from a high-end designer or is mass produced. The process goes like 
this (see Figure 6-1): 
	
1.	The designer comes up with an idea for a garment and creates a 
sketch, which goes to the pattern maker.
	
2.	The pattern maker draws the actual pattern. 
	
3.	Materials are picked and a sample is made. 
	
	 The sample is fit to a fit model and then scaled up and down in size to 
accommodate small, medium, large, and so forth. Colors and patterns 
are also decided, as are any embellishments or details. 
	
4.	The design goes off to the showroom (and a runway show if the 
designer is high-end). 
	
5.	The buyers come to look at the merchandise and, if they like it, place 
orders. 
	
6.	The garment is sent to production. 
	
	 The quantity produced is based largely on the number of sales already 
made and predicted reorders. 
	
7.	The pieces are tagged and shipped off to a store near you. 
And you thought the clothes just appeared in the stores!

Step 1: Designer sketches idea
Step 2: Pattern is created
Step 3: Sample is made
Step 4: Garment is introduced in showroom or on runway
Step 5: Buyers place orders
Step 6: Garment is sent to production
Step 7: Garment is shipped to store near you
Figure 6-1: From designer to a store near you.
The following sections provide more specifics about these steps.
Even a T-shirt requires a careful design
You may think a T-shirt is just a T-shirt, but like 
every other item of clothing, a sketch, pattern, 
and sample has to be made for every single 
T-shirt style, too. You can’t just produce a 
V-neck T-shirt from a basic crewneck sample, 
or a short-sleeve T-shirt from a long-sleeve one. 
Each type requires all of the steps outlined in 
Figure 6-1, which takes time and costs money. 
The sleeve length has to be precise when you 
make either a short-sleeve or a long-sleeve 
T-shirt — no guesswork is allowed! — and the 
amount of material used determines how much 
of that particular fabric has to be purchased. All 
of this goes into the production costs and, of 
course, determines the shirt’s cost.

Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment Construction, Fabrics, and Color 
Creating the design 
During the early stages of a designing career, a designer works on every little 
detail with his or her own hands. Often, the higher the designer moves up 
the ladder of success, the less physical work he or she actually does. Instead, 
the designer has a staff to carry out the process of cutting, sewing, and so on. 
In addition, the very famous designers have other designers working under 
them, which means that once a designer reaches the top rungs of the ladder 
of success, he or she may never have to sketch out an idea again. (On the 
other hand some designers are very hands on, and for big celebrity events or 
weddings, many designers get extremely involved in the process.)
It isn’t enough to just work on patterns and samples (or to direct other 
people to do so). The other trick to being a successful designer is to be ahead 
of the game. Designers create patterns and samples for future seasons. While 
their spring merchandise is just hitting the stores, designers have to have 
their fall lines ready to show to buyers and editors at Fashion Week. In other 
words, designers have already thought of, sketched, and produced their 
designs a season prior to when they’ll come out. Many designers actually 
work about a year ahead, not just a season ahead. How far in advance they 
have to design depends on the designer, how big his or her line is, and the 
size of the overall enterprise.
Keeping their fingers on the public’s pulse 
In order to avoid designs that are out of fashion, a designer has to know what the 
competition is doing and what colors and fabrics are expected to be in fashion 
in the coming seasons. And because the ultimate buyer is the public, a designer 
also has to try to gauge what customers’ moods and desires are going to be a 
few years from now. To do that, designers have to be up on the current trends in 
music, art, cinema, TV, and so on, as well as try to get ahead of those curves. So, 
for example, if a major motion picture about some historical era is being made, 
designers may try to capitalize on that by including one or two outfits in their 
collections that reflect that era on the off chance that the film becomes a big hit.
King Louis and his dolls; Napoleon and his edicts 
Fashion has been an important part of many a 
country’s economy, notably France. In order 
to publicize French fashions, King Louis XIV 
had life-sized fashion dolls made and sent to 
every court in Europe. Even after dress patterns 
became widely used, the dolls continued to be 
made up until World War I, and the mannequins 
seen in every department store have kept the 
idea alive even today. The French revolution 
badly damaged the French fashion industry, and 
when Napoleon became emperor, he issued 
many decrees in order to revive it. Among them, 
he ordered that ladies could not wear the same 
outfit twice to his court.

105
 Chapter 6: From the Runway to a Store Near You
Following or bucking trends
The big question every designer has to answer is whether to follow the cur­
rent trends or buck them. If hemlines have been inching up, then without a 
doubt they will head back down at some point, but does a particular designer 
risk lowering hemlines too early or wait until everyone else heads in that 
direction? A designer like the late Yves Saint Laurent was such a style setter 
that virtually every other top designer felt compelled to follow his lead. If 
Saint Laurent decided that the safari look was in, then almost all the other 
designers added one or two safari-inspired outfits to their collections. 
	
Saint Laurent even influenced real estate, opening a store on Paris’ Left Bank 
when the top designers were all based on the right bank and then watching as 
many others followed suit by also opening stores in the Left Bank.
An established designer can pave his or her own road, but for others it’s a 
big gamble. Go too far afield, and you may get ignored. But be too conserva­
tive, and you stand no chance of breaking out from the pack. Fashion is an art 
form but also a business, and many a designer has failed because of an inabil­
ity to cope with both. 
Introducing the design
A fashion show is the best way for a designer to get his or her designs out into 
public view. So how do you score tickets to a designer’s fashion show? It’s not 
easy. These shows have limited seating, and the seats are primarily reserved 
for fashion editors, stylists, celebrities, and, of course, the buyers. The people 
attending the shows filter the information to you via the fashion magazines, 
celebrities wear the designs to events that are covered in the press, or eventu­
ally the buyers bring the designs to a boutique near you. If you want to get a 
head start, check out the shows online at www.style.com and www.elle.com.
On the runway 
If there’s one thought about the world of fashion that is shared by most 
people when looking at the fashions coming down the runways, it’s “What 
normal woman could ever wear that?” And you’d have a hard time finding 
most of those items in a store if you did want to buy them. So why do the 
clothes displayed on runways end up being so outrageous? The basic answer 
is to satisfy the fashion media.
The major fashion magazines, Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, and Elle, can devote only 
so many pages to covering the fashion shows. Understandably, they show outfits 
that are eye-catching and innovative. Because it’s vital for designers to get cov­
ered in the fashion media, they all know that some of the outfits they send down 
the runway are for show only. And don’t forget, designers are also artists. Sure, 
they want to sell clothing, but they also want to express their artistic talents, 
and sometimes the two don’t necessarily mesh. But that’s fine, as long as you 

106
Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment Construction, Fabrics, and Color 
understand that what you’re seeing walking down those runways is both fashion 
and art (see Figure 6-2).
	
Fashion Week, be it in New York, Paris, Milan, or wherever, is really more the­
ater than anything else. The point is to get celebrities in the audience, photog­
raphers crowding behind the velvet rope, and cause as much buzz as possible. 
In fact, most of the buying isn’t done at fashion shows at all, but before that in 
the showrooms. 
Figure 6-2: Fashion Week in New York City is always an extravaganza.
In the showroom
The top buyers visit the designers’ showrooms. The buyers then pick and 
choose what they think will sell best in the stores. Familiar with the most 
common sizes and most popular colors and styles, these buyers filter even 

107
 Chapter 6: From the Runway to a Store Near You
further from the designers’ collections and only buy what they think will 
actually sell. They place their orders, and based on these orders, the design­
ers determine how much of each item to produce.
That’s not to say that top designers don’t also carry their higher-end apparel 
at their boutiques and high-end department stores. They absolutely do, and 
these clothes certainly have aspects of the more innovative designs that are 
shown on the runway, if not almost exact replicas. 
That said, women still get a thrill from wearing the latest trends. So even if it 
isn’t exactly what’s shown on the runway, women want new clothes that incor­
porate the new and trendy. Designers know this, and they produce clothes 
that are actually wearable versions of the theatrical garments shown on the 
runway. In addition, savvy women know they need to stay true to their lifestyle 
and body type. Designers, therefore, produce basics, classics, and staples in 
addition to their current and trendy pieces. 
Moving the design toward 
a wider audience
Other designers, whose names you may not be familiar with, take the same design 
elements and trends shown on the runways and come up with different lines that 
are more (or much more) affordable. Elements such as the quality of the fabric 
and the attention to detail usually determine at which level these clothes fall. 
But that’s not the end of the story. Not every garment ends up a big seller. If 
a particular style sits unsold for too long, it gets marked down in price, just 
like you see when department stores and boutiques have their big sales. And 
sometimes designers produce more pieces than they sell to the stores, and if 
there are no reorders on those designs, these articles can end up at discount 
outlets like Loehmann’s, or even T.J. Maxx or Marshall’s. 
Even the designs themselves may have other lives. If a particular design sells 
well, you can almost bet that some other clothing manufacturer will make a 
copy of that design, perhaps using less expensive material and less costly 
manufacturing processes, and sell the item as a so-called knockoff. 
Ranking Clothing: From Haute Couture 
to Mass Market
Visit a vintage clothing store and you’ll quickly see that just as high-end cars 
hold their value, so do designer clothes. There’s a real pecking order when it 
comes to clothes, and the designers fight to make it to the top of the ladder 

108
Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment Construction, Fabrics, and Color 
because along with the fame and adulation comes that pot of gold. The follow­
ing list explains how to differentiate between the lines of designer clothing:
	
✓	Haute couture: This is the highest end. It’s made-to-measure and costs 
thousands of dollars. 
	
✓	Prêt-a-porter: This line is the next level down in a designer’s collection. 
Prêt-a-porter clothing is still high-end and very pricey, but the pieces 
aren’t one of a kind. The construction, materials, and fit are of impec­
cable quality. These outfits are shown on the runway, as are the haute 
couture pieces, and they’re sold at the designers’ boutiques or on the 
designer floor of the higher-end department stores. 
	
✓	Contemporary: Designers that are mostly well known under their own 
labels design these pieces. These items are shown in the designers’ own 
boutiques and are also sold in department stores on the contemporary 
floor. Contemporary pieces are less expensive than prêt-a-porter.
	
✓	Mass market: These are more affordable pieces that may or may not 
have a designer’s name attached. They’re not shown on the runway 
and are generally mass produced. Because there are a variety of mass 
market stores, ranging from stores like H&M to Walmart, the prices and 
the quality of their merchandise vary considerably.
	
Traditionally, when the term “designer clothing” was used, it meant high-end 
clothing, that is to say, clothing of limited quantity, high cost, and designed by 
somebody who, if not a household name, was at least somewhat famous. But 
beginning in the 1960s with Pierre Cardin, top designers began attaching their 
names to clothing meant for the masses, so that even babies could be dressed 
from head to toe in Calvin Klein or Ralph Lauren. 
Haute couture 
If you are Angelina Jolie and are heading to the Oscars to be photographed for 
the entire world to see, haute couture is appropriate! Haute couture dresses are 
made to order for a specific customer and are made from high-quality, expensive 
fabrics and sewn with extreme detail (see Figure 6-3). Making a haute couture 
garment is very time-consuming because these creations are hand made. The 
time and effort is worth it to the designer, though, because having a big celebrity 
wear a creation is a big coup and gives the designer an enormous amount of 
press and exposure. 
What distinguishes haute couture from every other type of clothing? Most 
specifically, it’s made for the person wearing it. A woman walks into the salon 
of a designer and sees various models, chooses one, and then selects exactly 
what fabric it will be made of. The dress is then hand-sewn to her exact size 
and specifications. (When this is done for a man, the term used is bespoke, 
which comes from Saville Row — the London street where the great mens­
wear shops are located.) 

109
 Chapter 6: From the Runway to a Store Near You
A designer has to be designated 
as worthy of the appellation of 
haute couture. To do so, the French 
Ministry of Industry must decide 
whether the house meets certain 
requirements, including having a 
minimum of 15 employees and hold­
ing fashion shows twice a year, with 
each show having a minimum of 
35 outfits for both day and evening 
wear. Surprisingly, not every one 
of today’s most famous designers 
can use the term “haute couture” to 
describe its creations. Those who 
can include Chanel, Givenchy, Yves 
Saint Laurent, Christian Dior, and 
Jean Paul Gaultier.
Prêt-a-porter: 
The designer’s 
ready-to-wear line
Haute couture is such a small niche 
in the fashion market because of its 
high price tag and the extravagance 
of the garments themselves. These 
pieces are mostly crafted for the art 
of fashion, the drama of the show, 
and the editorial exposure. They’re 
not produced on a large scale, if at 
all. So how do these haute couture fashion designers make a living? Well, they 
sell their other line — the prêt-a-porter line, or in English, ready-to-wear. This 
line is at a much more attainable price for the general consumer. Don’t get me 
wrong: Designer clothing is expensive, but the ready-to-wear line is much more 
wearable as far as design and much more affordable. 
Comparing prêt-a-porter to other lines
What distinguishes prêt-a-porter from contemporary and so-called mass 
market clothing is that the fabrics are of better quality, some hand-sewing 
may be involved, and there is more attention to detail, all of which allows the 
designer to charge more. Where a haute couture dress may cost from $3,000 to 
$10,000 or more, a designer dress of the prêt-a-porter category probably costs 
between $500 and $2,500. 
Figure 6-3: A haute couture dress.

110
Part II: Mastering the Basics of Garment Construction, Fabrics, and Color 
One of the biggest differences between 
prêt-a-porter and haute couture is in the 
design. Haute couture is not necessarily 
made to be worn by the average person; 
prêt-a-porter is (see Figure 6-4). And, even 
though prêt-a-porter is made in greater 
volume than haute couture, the quality 
is still top-notch. Make no mistake, when 
you’re buying from a designer’s ready-
to-wear line, you’re getting a high-quality 
garment made with the finest materials 
and using the finest labor methods. Some 
pieces may be hand-stitched or hand-
beaded. Another major difference is that 
prêt-a-porter is fully completed, which is 
why a customer can go into a store, buy it, 
and wear it home. In many instances, some 
alterations have to be made, but because 
every store has the garment in several 
sizes, it may actually fit perfectly. 
Ways to buy prêt-a-porter
Because prêt-a-porter is not inexpensive, 
such higher-quality garments are expected 
to last, both in terms of wear and tear and 
style. A two-year old dress may be out of 
style for a fashionista who feels she must 
dress on the cutting edge, but the quality 
should be obvious for many years. This 
gives women two avenues when it comes 
to purchasing clothing of the prêt-a-porter 
quality. 
	
✓	Look for classics at discounted prices: If you can find a high-quality item 
that didn’t sell when it first came out, it may be deeply discounted. Yes, 
it may no longer be cutting-edge, but it certainly will still make a state­
ment. The difference in price may make such a purchase very worth­
while. And because it is of higher quality, it will also last. So if you find a 
staple item, like a blazer or little black dress or charcoal wool skirt, that 
is greatly reduced in price, definitely consider its purchase. Especially if 
you consider that with a few alterations, like an adjustment to the hem­
line, it may actually be right in style.
	
✓	Consider buying previously owned pieces: Because prêt-a-porter 
items are more upscale, they most likely weren’t worn very often. Many 
women don’t like to repeat and will consign items to make money to 
buy more! See Chapter 7 for more advice on buying vintage clothing, but 
keep this option in mind when looking for higher-quality garments that 
may otherwise be out of your reach. 
Figure 6-4: Prêt-a-porter.

111
 Chapter 6: From the Runway to a Store Near You
Contemporary 
Contemporary designs may have recognizable names 
but are not considered as high-end as prêt-a-porter. 
These garments can be sold in the same department 
stores as the prêt-a-porter lines but are often sold 
on a different floor. These dresses generally run 
anywhere from $150 to $450 (see Figure 6-5). A mass 
market dress, on the other hand, can easily be found 
for under $100.
Mass market
If you think of fashion as a pyramid, with the haute cou­
ture clothes at the top, mass market forms the bottom, 
and because the bottom is the widest, it encompasses 
the most variety at the lowest price points. 
Stores such as Nordstrom, Macy’s, Kohl’s, and Walmart 
are all big department stores, but the merchandise 
you find at each is different. Even though each of these 
stores is likely to have a selection of black dresses, 
you’re unlikely to find the same dress, because the 
buyers for each of these chains has a different price 
point. 
While finding 10s in the mass market category is cer­
tainly possible, as Figure 6-6 shows, you have to look a 
little harder to find the perfect item that also fits your 
style and body type. 
Figure 6-5: A contempo­
rary black dress.
Dressmaking was all done by hand until the 
middle of the 19th century when technological 
advances brought major changes. The year 
1856 is the landmark year when the Singer 
Sewing Machine Company was born. The 
origin of the sewing machine stretched back 
more than 20 years prior, but when the Singer 
machine began to be sold in quantity, it was the 
beginning of a revolution. Tens of thousands of 
tailors would soon be out of a job, and while at 
first these machines permitted women to make 
their own clothes, eventually, as the machines 
became more elaborate, it spelled the birth of 
the mass market clothing business, and shops 
devoted to selling ready-to-wear clothes began 
to spring up.

Building Your Fashion Awareness 
Assuming that you’re not going to rush out and buy an outfit in the category 
of haute couture or maybe even of prêt-a-porter, what does all this have to do 
with you and your fashion sense? Everything! If you’re going to develop your 
personal sense of style, you have to have an idea of what’s going on in the 
fashion world. 
At the top is haute couture, and you can never go wrong wearing a designer 
dress of this caliber because it will be tailored to your measurements, made 
with exquisite care using the finest cloth, and be of the most cutting-edge 
design. At the next level, prêt-a-porter, you can be sure that the design is 
up to date, the fabrics are wonderful, and the manufacturing process is first 
class. The rest of the market is made up of contemporary designers and mass 
market merchandise.

 Chapter 6: From the Runway to a Store Near You
Here’s what fashion awareness lets you do:
	
✓	Invest wisely in your clothing: As 
you know so well, there’s a very 
big difference in what you can buy 
at a department store and a dollar 
store. As you build your fashionable 
wardrobe, you have to decide which 
pieces are worth spending a little 
more on and which you can spend 
less on. My advice? Invest smartly in 
classic pieces and staple items that 
will stand the test of time as far as 
quality and style, and spend less on 
the super trendy items that’ll be out 
of style before you can bat an eye. 
You’ll never feel bad purchasing a few 
fun, trendy items to wear all season 
until they are “out” if you didn’t over­
spend on them. 
	
✓	Create your own versions of 
designer fashions: When you keep 
abreast of what the top designers 
are doing, you can create your own 
version of their designs, using mer­
chandise that fits your budget (see 
Figure 6-7). Every designer, whether 
a household name or not, has his or 
her version of the latest trend. So 
even if you’re getting your ideas from 
the high-end designers that grace the 
pages of the fashion magazines (tear 
out pictures of the pieces you like 
and take them shopping with you), 
you’ll still be able to find items that 
work for you in your budget. 
	
✓	Be a savvy shopper: Your goal is 
to be fashionable, not a slave to fashion! Raising your level of fashion 
awareness is going to make it a lot easier to buy clothes. You won’t 
spend time guessing whether or not a particular outfit you see in the 
stores is fashionable or relying on a sales assistant who may have more 
incentive to push something that’s not going to sell on its own. Instead, 
Figure 6-7: With the right 
accessories, you can dress up 
even an inexpensive LBD.

you’ll be able to browse through the racks with confidence, selecting 
items that will let those around you know that you’re someone who has 
good fashion sense.
	
	What factors into something being trendy? The shape, hemline, neckline, 
color, type of material, and so on. How many times have you read that 
“X color is the new black?” If blue is the new black, for example, then 
maybe you want to add a little blue to your wardrobe this season. 
	
If you want to be fashion conscious, you need to see what the top designers 
are doing. The reason is that so many of the designers who produce more 
affordable clothing will offer similar versions of the same trends the high-end 
designers produce. By seeing what the top designers are doing, you’ll be able 
to spot trends that you can then imitate at whatever level comfortably suits 
your income. Even if you never purchase one of the gowns featured in the 
coverage Vogue gives to Fashion Week, by understanding what’s being shown, 
you’ll be able to select outfits in your price range that still reflect the latest 
trends.
	
Before you buy something because it’s trendy, make sure it fits into your 
style and body type. If blue is the new black but it’s not a color that you’re 
comfortable in or look good in, then avoid it, regardless of the trend. If you’re 
a women whose body type doesn’t fit the latest fashion — if the latest style 
is low-waisted pants when you are long-waisted, for example — don’t follow 
the herd. Be selective and wear only clothing that fits your body. This doesn’t 
mean you can’t be trendy. Accessories are very trendy items and are great 
ways to express your style and fashion sense without falling victim to unflat­
tering hemlines, materials, and so on. Remain true to your style and your body 
type, and you’ll look fabulous whatever you wear!

W
hen is the best time to shop? Hmmm...that’s a tough ques­
tion to answer, right? Here’s the basic rule to follow 
(unless you’re facing an extreme circumstance, and I mean 
extreme): Don’t go on a shopping frenzy if you’re feeling 
down, bloated, or bored. Although you may think these 
seem like the perfect scenarios to soothe yourself in 
a time of distress, they’re not. If you’re reading this 
while in a relatively calm frame of mind, you know 
where I’m coming from. With that said, for many of 
us, shopping does the trick when we need a lift, but 
then the focus should be on what you buy, not how 
much you buy.
This chapter explains what to do (and not do) to 
ensure that your forays into clothing shops leave you 
feeling good and owning items you need, want, look good 
in, and can afford. It also explains what items you should 
look for if your closet doesn’t already have them.

Wardrobe Staples
There are some items that you absolutely need. These make up the basis of 
your wardrobe; they’re the must haves, no matter what your style. I call them 
wardrobe essentials. To be considered a wardrobe essential, an article of 
clothing has to have several important attributes:
	
✓	It must be versatile. This is the most important quality of an essential 
piece of clothing. One key factor in versatility is color. Because ward­
robe essentials have to go with lots of other clothing, they tend to be 
monochromatic and neutral in color. They also must work with different 
outfits. A blazer that you can pair with a skirt, pants, or a pair of jeans is 
a good example. 
	
✓	It has to be of good, perhaps even exceptional, quality. A wardrobe 
essential makes a statement, and anyone looking should be able to tell 
that it’s top shelf. High quality also means that it wears well — very 
important for a garment that you’ll rely on again and again. 
	
✓	It should be in a classic style. You don’t want your wardrobe essentials 
to ever really go out of fashion. 
	
✓	It must be a 10. These garments, like everything in your closet, should 
have all the qualities of a 10 (refer to Chapter 2), and because they 
form the basis of your stylish wardrobe, it’s okay to spend a little 
more for these than you would other, less essential, items.
So what are the basic wardrobe essentials? Read on.
	
A lot of the items in the following list are black. Why? Because black provides 
a clean slate on which to build your outfit. Black garments offer many pluses: 
No one knows how often you wear them. Stains are difficult, if not impossible, 
to see. The color is flattering on every person and every body type. And with a 
black basic, you’re free to add color in other areas of your outfit and have fun 
with prints or great accessories.
Little black dress (LBD) 
Ah, the little black dress. It should be sexy, yet sophisticated. It should be 
well-made and fit like a glove. It should hide your flaws and accentuate your 

119
 Chapter 7: Building Your Wardrobe: Your What- and Where-to-Buy Guide
attributes. It should go from day (wear it to 
the office with a cardigan or blazer and a set 
of pearls and leather pumps) to night (take off 
the blazer or cardigan and add some makeup, 
jewelry, and heels). Really, the little black 
dress, shown in Figure 7-1, is so versatile, it 
can go anywhere and be appropriate. 
Choose a LBD in the style that suits you, 
makes you feel comfortable, and looks most 
like you. It can be sleeveless, have cap sleeves, 
or have 3⁄4-length sleeves. It can have a V-neck, 
boat neck, crew neck, or square neck. It can 
be knee-length, a little longer, a little shorter, 
or miniskirt length. Really, the LBD is both 
universal and individual at the same time. Find 
one that makes you feel fabulous and make 
the investment because this is one piece that 
really gives you your money’s worth!
Black blazer 
The black blazer is key in your wardrobe. 
Because it’s black, it goes with virtually every­
thing. You can change the look just by chang­
ing the accessories. (And, as I mentioned 
previously, because it’s black, no one will 
notice how often you wear it.)
Although it doesn’t need to be ridiculously 
expensive or high-end, the blazer does need 
to fit you perfectly and work with your body 
type. If you want to appear taller or longer, 
choose a blazer that’s longer. If you want to 
accentuate your beautiful waistline, make sure it’s fitted in the waist area. 
Also make sure it’s current. Avoid one that looks like something from the 
80s — oversized with enormous shoulder pads.
Figure 7-1: Pearls and pumps make 
the LBD simple yet chic.

120
Part III: Stocking Your Closet without Going Crazy or Broke 
	
Should you go with a double- or single-
breasted blazer? My advice is choose a single-
breasted one. You can wear a single-breasted 
blazer comfortably and fashionably either 
open or closed, and you have the option of 
wearing it over dresses or skirts, as well as 
pants. (Don’t underestimate the power of a 
black blazer and jeans. As Figure 7-2 shows it’s 
a classic look that can take you from day to 
night. It’s my go-to outfit when in doubt!)
Don’t be afraid to make the blazer your own: 
Add a favorite pin to the lapel if you want to 
jazz it up when the occasion calls for it. A 
black blazer doesn’t have to be boring. Again, 
it’s a basic that you can build your outfit 
around.
Crisp, white button-down 
shirt 
The white button-down shirt should fit you 
well. Nothing oversized here. At first glance, 
your white shirt may look no different than 
the one your husband or boyfriend wears 
under his suits, but yours is made and cut 
specifically for a woman. It should be flatter­
ing and accentuate your best features. You 
can wear a white shirt on its own, tucked in 
or out, under a sweater, under a jacket, or 
as part of a suit. Keep the following things in 
mind as you decide on your white shirt:
	
✓	Style: The more expensive shirts look a little dressier and need to be 
pressed (otherwise, they look messy), but if you’re buying only one, a 
dressier shirt is the way to go because it’s more versatile. You can dress 
it up for work under a suit or on its own with slacks or a great skirt. Or 
you can dress it down by putting it under a sweater or with a pair of 
jeans. Less fancy shirts are also an option if you’re planning to wear the 
shirt only as casual dress. This type is good with jeans or tied at the 
Figure 7-2: You can never go wrong 
with a black blazer and blue jeans. 

121
 Chapter 7: Building Your Wardrobe: Your What- and Where-to-Buy Guide
waist over a bikini, for example. These shirts aren’t as structured and 
don’t need to be pressed. 
	
	If you have a great waist, buy a fitted shirt; if not, buy one that is cut 
straight.
	
✓	Material: Whether dressy or more casual, the white shirt is generally 
made of cotton. If you can, go for combed cotton, which means that 
longer fibers were used; these fibers are stronger and give the mate­
rial a more luxurious appearance. Many shirts designed for office wear 
are made of cotton in an oxford weave. Although a comfortable type of 
cotton, these types of shirts don’t wear as well, and tend to pill at the 
collar and cuffs. Cotton broadcloth is sturdier and resists soiling. 
	
✓	Construction: Because your collar is usually at eye level, make sure it’s 
sewn properly. Women’s button-down shirts don’t generally have actual 
buttons on the collar that button down to the shirt, so make sure there 
are no puckers in the material and that it lays flat. 
	
Brooks Brothers (www.brooksbrothers.com) makes an iron-free, non-
wrinkle shirt that you don’t have to dry clean. You can throw it in the dryer 
and it comes out looking perfect!
Black trousers
A pair of high-quality, flat front, black trousers are a necessity in every ward­
robe. Stay away from pleats because they only accentuate an area that no 
one really needs accentuating! If you can buy only one pair of trousers, select 
a length that matches the heel height you most commonly wear. And choose 
a lightweight wool that will work in summer or winter.
	
If you can buy another pair of trousers, ivory is great to have (even in the 
winter). I love winter white! It’s such a refreshing change in the darker months, 
and it shows that you have style and are daring enough to let everyone know it. 
Knee-length black skirt
Every woman should have a knee-length black skirt that fits perfectly and 
gives her a slim appearance. The particular style is up to you (and what looks 
good on your body type): It can be a pencil skirt or an A-line skirt (head to 
Chapter 9 to see a range of skirt styles). So that it can go from season to 
season, look for one that’s a lightweight wool.

122
Part III: Stocking Your Closet without Going Crazy or Broke 
Think how much you can do with the 
basic black skirt. Not only is black always 
flattering, but the outfit possibilities are 
endless — a beautiful blouse, a gorgeous 
sweater, and high boots or pumps. You can 
pair a knee-length skirt with solids, such as 
a basic white cardigan set (see Figure 7-3) 
or with a fabulous print. If you keep the 
outfit simple, you can liven it up with great 
jewelry or a great bag. 
Classic beige 
trench coat
The classic trench is a necessary staple 
because it never goes out of style and you 
can wear it in just about any season — 
spring, summer, fall, and, depending on the 
winter temperatures where you live, some­
times winter. If you stick to a classic trench 
coat, it will last you for years. When choos­
ing a trench coat, follow these suggestions:
	
✓	Make sure the coat fits in the shoul­
ders. You don’t want to be drowning 
in your coat. You should always be 
wearing your clothes; they should not 
be wearing you. 
	
✓	Choose a style and length that 
gives you the look you want. Decide 
whether you want it to cinch at the 
waist or be looser fit. A belted trench 
flatters your waistline in contrast to 
your shoulders and the overall volume 
of the coat itself. If you plan to wear it over dresses and pants, make 
sure it’s long enough that your dresses aren’t sticking out the bottom. 
You can get away with a shorter trench if you are only going to wear it 
with pants or jeans (see Figure 7-4).
Figure 7-3: The basic black skirt and 
sweater set — always chic and 
­classic.

123
 Chapter 7: Building Your Wardrobe: Your What- and Where-to-Buy Guide
	
✓	Make sure the coat doesn’t overwhelm you. If 
you’re on the smaller side, pick a coat that’s 
less busy, that is, has less going on with the 
pockets, lapels, buttons, and so on, and make 
sure it’s single-breasted. If you’re taller, you can 
carry off a more traditional looking double-
breasted trench. 
	
Because you’ll probably buy only one trench coat, 
make sure it goes with everything in your closet and 
that it’s a length to give you the look you want. 
Black leather bag
You can look at a bag as something handy to carry 
your makeup, cell phone, and other necessities, 
or you can look at it as a great way to show off your 
sense of style. Or better yet, why not have both! 
Most women buy one great bag for the season and 
carry it everywhere. 
A black leather bag is a perfect everywhere bag, a bag 
you can wear to work, to lunch, to dinner, and even 
shopping on the weekend. It goes with everything, 
and you’ll feel comfortable using it with whatever 
color or prints you may be wearing. It should be 
medium-sized: large enough to hold whatever you 
need during the day but not so large that it looks 
awkward if you find yourself running straight out to 
dinner with it. 
	
I highly recommend having several bags in your arse­
nal so that you can accessorize your various outfits, 
but as a go-to bag for every day, the black leather bag 
is key. You live out of your bag, so this isn’t an item to skimp on. And just the 
way you notice every other woman’s bag, every other woman will be taking 
notice of yours, so make sure it gives a good first impression of you!
Quality blue jeans
Everyone should have a pair of favorite jeans — you know, the kind of jeans 
that make you feel sexy, pulled together, and comfortable. These jeans 
should be current in style, and the cut should be one that flatters your 
Figure 7-4: Make sure 
you wear the trench and 
that it doesn’t wear you!

124
Part III: Stocking Your Closet without Going Crazy or Broke 
best assets. The great news is that nowadays jeans companies are making 
jeans to accommodate every body type. So figure out what your body type 
is (refer to Chapter 3 for help), then pick the cut of your jeans accordingly. 
Some suggestions:
	
✓	If you have great legs, you may want a pair of skinny jeans. 
	
✓	If you want to direct attention away from your waist area, choose a 
flared jean. 
	
✓	If you have a great waistline and want to draw attention to it, go for a 
pair of high-waisted jeans. 
	
Jeans can get a little pricey, but you can still get a great pair for around, or 
even under, $100. And always check the sale section because jeans do actu­
ally go on sale — a great price break if you can find your size. If you are only 
investing in one pair of jeans, go with dark denim. They are more slimming 
and more versatile. You can wear them totally casual during the day, and you 
can dress them up for night.
Pair of black pumps 
Every woman needs a pair of “go to” shoes. Along the same lines as the little 
black dress and the black skirt, a pair of black pumps serves you well. Black 
pumps go with everything, they won’t get too dirty, and they can also go 
from day to night. If you can afford only one pair of black pumps, go with a 
dressier pair; shoes are generally easier to dress down than to dress up.
	
When buying shoes, make sure they’re comfortable! Don’t expect them to 
“break in.” You’re going to spend some money on them because shoes tend to 
cost a bit more, so please, please, please make sure they fit right. For more on 
sizing shoes, head to Chapter 16.
White and black cardigan sweaters 
Cardigan sweaters are great for those times when you don’t know what the 
weather will be like or if it’s the middle of summer and you get stuck in a 
ridiculously cold air-conditioned restaurant or office. If you get warm, you 
can always throw the cardigan over your shoulders and tie around your neck, 
and if you’re chilly, you can wear it. 

125
 Chapter 7: Building Your Wardrobe: Your What- and Where-to-Buy Guide
	
If you can afford it, get your cardigans in a light cashmere. If you can’t afford 
cashmere, a great cotton does the trick! Whether cotton or cashmere, a good-
quality cardigan sweater should last a very long time. You can find great 
cardigans at a store like Gap or Old Navy for a very reasonable price. (Target 
also has great ones.) You should be able to purchase a cotton cardigan for 
$50 or less. 
Want more than black and white? Cardigans come in all sorts of other colors. 
Spring is a great time to buy cotton cardigans, which are generally a spring 
item and the stores will be well stocked. You can buy cashmere whenever; 
they generally have seasonal colors, too.
Set of pearls
A set of pearls can be a beautiful accent 
to any outfit. They’re perfect for the office 
and for a formal affair. Obviously, real 
pearls are expensive, so if you can borrow 
from Grandma — lucky you! If not, you can 
buy fakes. Just play around with them. 
Pearls aren’t just for those who prefer 
classic styles. There are many ways to 
wear them, and a long strand can be 
worn with a funkier outfit. Remember, 
they don’t have to look like your grandma’s 
pearls if your outfit isn’t like grandma’s 
(see Figure 7-5). 
	
You can get a nice strand of pearls that 
will do the trick at a good trimmings store. 
Try layering a few strands. M&J Trimming 
sells them for $10 each. If you’re not able to 
visit the New York store, get them online at 
www.mjtrim.com.
Diamond studs, or shall 
we say cubics!
You definitely don’t want to leave your 
ears bare, and diamond studs go perfectly 
Figure 7-5: Pearls are not just for 
Grandma.

126
Part III: Stocking Your Closet without Going Crazy or Broke 
with everything. If you are heading to work in a suit and then out at night in 
jeans and a blouse, studs are the perfect complement. They’re classy, and 
you can throw them on without worrying whether they go with what you’re 
wearing because diamonds go with everything! 
	
Don’t have the money for genuine diamonds studs? Don’t worry. Buy cubic 
zirconia instead; just keep them small. 
Making the Most of Your 
Shopping Excursions
In real estate, it’s location, location, location. In clothes shopping, it’s focus, 
focus, focus. If you know what you want and how much you want to spend 
for it, every shopping expedition can work like a well-oiled machine. But if 
you shop with your eyes darting at every item that attracts your attention, 
you can be sure that you’re going to wind up buying the wrong items for your 
wardrobe. The time to act like a kid in a candy store is . . . when you’re a kid 
in a candy store. 
Budgeting for your fashion wardrobe
It’s possible to spend an almost unlimited amount of money on clothes. After 
all, Imelda Marcos, former first lady of the Philippines, left behind over 1,200 
pairs of shoes when she had to flee the presidential palace. Throw jewelry 
into the mix, and she spent even more. But most of us don’t have unlimited 
budgets. The trick is to dress fashionably within your budget. 
To paraphrase Mick Jagger, you can’t always get what you want, but if you 
try, you can usually get what you need. The first thing to do when putting 
together a clothing budget is to figure out what you need versus what you 
want. If you don’t have a black blazer, for example, then that’s a need. If you 
have a black blazer, but you’d like a new one by Ralph Lauren, that’s a want. 
When you think about how much to budget, be willing to spend more on the 
must-have items because they need to last a long time. Consider these pur­
chases investments.
The next thing to do is to determine how much you have available to spend. 
If you have enough to afford both what you need and what you want, lucky 
you. If not, focus on the needs. As explained earlier, they form the basis of 

127
 Chapter 7: Building Your Wardrobe: Your What- and Where-to-Buy Guide
your wardrobe and, because of their versatility, can be worn in a variety of 
situations and expand your wardrobe. What should you do with your list of 
wants? Write them down on a piece of paper that you keep with you when 
you go shopping, in case you see an item from your want list on sale.
	
Many people don’t bother with a clothing budget, and that’s a mistake. Using a 
budget — that is, knowing how much you can spend on an item and keeping 
track of when you spend more or less — allows you to buy more clothes, not 
less. If you know you saved money on a pair of black pumps, for example, you 
can add your savings to the money you’re putting away for the diamond studs, 
and eventually you’ll get them. But if you don’t keep track, then those studs 
will always remain far off in the distance.
	
Figure out how much you can pay before looking for a particular article of 
clothing. By having a top price in mind while you’re going through the racks, 
you can eliminate anything that costs a lot more, thus saving you time. 
The following sections explain how to get the most for your hard-earned 
money. 
Focusing on quality 
When it comes to building your wardrobe, quality is more important than 
quantity for two basic reasons: One, better-quality clothing lasts longer. If 
you spend twice as much for a trench coat and it lasts you three times as 
long as a cheaper coat, you’re actually ahead of the game. True story: The 
year I graduated from the University of Michigan, I used most of my gradua­
tion money to buy a black, Prada-belted raincoat that goes with everything. 
That was over ten years ago, and I still wear that same raincoat. The point? 
Investing in fine, good clothing is a bargain. I would rather you buy one fabu­
lous item and mix and match it than ten that are just “eh.”
	
So does that mean you should buy the $25 pair of plastic flip-flops rather than 
the 99-cent store variety? Absolutely not. Sometimes it makes sense to buy an 
item that is less expensive (when an item is trendy, for example, or when it’s 
made of a material that doesn’t shout out “This only costs $10!”). But more 
often than not, a quality item will be recognized for what it is, and it doesn’t 
need a fancy label for that to happen. (I don’t encourage wearing items that 
scream a certain designer anyway.) Even if people don’t know exactly why one 
leather bag stands out more than others, they can still tell the difference. And 
trust me, you’ll feel great every time you wear that great investment piece that 
you waited to buy. 

128
Part III: Stocking Your Closet without Going Crazy or Broke 
Shopping to look, not to buy
In English, we call it window-shopping. In French, it’s called leche carreau, 
which translates into “window licking” (when you think about it, it’s an 
apt term for the fabulous windows in the Parisian fashion houses like Dior, 
Chanel, and Hermes that can easily cause you to drool when the prices may 
make it impossible for you to buy). But window-shopping serves a greater 
function than just being a way to spend a Saturday afternoon when you don’t 
have money to spend. If you approach it as a learning experience rather 
than a shopping trip, it can be time very well spent. To get the most of your 
window shopping excursions, do the following:
	
✓	Adjust your attitude. When browsing, don’t let yourself get frustrated 
because you can’t plunk down the cash for everything that you see or 
try on. 
	
✓	Don’t stay out of high-end department stores or boutiques because 
you can’t afford to buy. These stores shouldn’t intimidate you, nor 
should you think that you shouldn’t try anything on if you can’t afford to 
buy. You should try on designer clothing if you fall in love with it. Doing 
so gives you an idea of what you’re looking for, and perhaps you’ll find 
a similar look in another store that is in your price-range. Knowledge is 
power, and if you see something you like, try it on! Trust me, the fashion 
police are not going to come and get you just because you had no inten­
tion of buying.
	
✓	Comparison shop. You know that you’re eventually going to buy 
something, so think of window-shopping as preparation. You no doubt 
already comparison shop for big-ticket items. Not many of us buy the 
first car we see. Window-shopping gives you the same opportunity 
with clothing: It lets you make sure that you’re getting the best item 
for your needs. 
	
✓	Understand how anticipation can increase the ultimate satisfaction 
you feel when you do eventually buy. As you slowly narrow down 
your search (taking your time is important) and as the moment of pur­
chase actually approaches, you’ll feel more and more excited, and the 
purchase itself will give you that much more satisfaction — certainly 
more than if you just ran into a store, grabbed a few things, and took 
them home.

Choosing your wingman (or woman)
Sometimes you go shopping to buy a specific item, and other times you go 
shopping to, well, just go shopping. Some people like to hunt solo (which is 
totally cool if you are 100 percent confident in your judgment), and others 
need approval on every hair band purchased. Most of us fall somewhere 
between the two extremes. So what type of person do you need by your side 
when trying to find whatever you are looking for that day? 
Choosing a friend 
The best people to take shopping with you are the people who
	
✓	Make you feel secure
	
✓	Have your best interests at heart
	
✓	Give you his or her honest opinion
	
✓	Knows what you can and can’t afford
If the person you are with fits these requirements, you are sure to walk out 
with only 10s for your closet. 
In his comic strip, poor Dagwood is often shown shopping with his wife, bur­
dened down with a mountain of packages. While a husband may make a good 
schlepper, most husbands, boyfriends, or partners may not want the role of the 
professional bag-carrier. So should you or shouldn’t you shop with your signifi­
cant other? If he (or she) does all the things in the preceding list, go for it. 
Shopping with a sales associate
Whether you know what you’re looking for or not, a sales associate can be 
very helpful to you. She knows what merchandise is in the store better than 
anyone and can direct you efficiently to areas that may be just what you’re 
looking for. Sales associates also know what’s trendy or current, and they can 
make your shopping experience a whole lot easier. 
	
The thing to be careful of when working with a sales associate is overspend­
ing. If you stay focused, the salesperson can expedite shopping for you. But 
if you’re aimlessly wandering and vulnerable to outside influences, especially 
if you’re on your own, you could end up spending a whole lot more than you 
bargained for. Make sure that you shop in stores where you can return the 
merchandise without a problem.

Many times sales associates work on commission. Although you’re looking 
for the approval of another person, it’s hard to fully trust someone you know 
benefits from the sale. The best advice I can give is if you love an item, see if it 
is refundable, buy it, and then try it on at home or in front of someone you 
truly trust. 
Keeping up the pace: Shopping tempo
As you may have observed, most retail establishments don’t have clocks in 
clear view. Why? Because retailers know that if you feel rushed, you’re likely 
to make fewer purchases. Which should tell you something about choosing 
your shopping tempo. Dawdle too long, and you’re probably going to end up 
buying something that you’ll later regret. Certainly you don’t want to make 
mistakes because you were rushing around too quickly, but if you are back 
and forth about a certain item, chances are it is not a must-have. Remember, 
the 10s (refer to Chapter 2) should be obvious in the mirror when you try 
them on! 
	
Having a hard time making up your mind? There’s nothing wrong with leav­
ing the store and taking some time to think about it. Almost every store will 
hold things, unless they’re on sale, for at least 24 hours. If you leave the store 
and are still thinking about the garment the next day, chances are you really 
want it. If you haven’t given it a second thought, then lucky you didn’t buy it 
because you obviously didn’t love it enough anyway.
Checking out the details
Okay, so you’ve found a fabulous must-have. Good for you! But before swiping 
your credit card, you need to take a few more steps: 
	
✓	Carefully examine the garment. Check for any signs of damage. Make 
sure any closures, especially zippers, are in working order. 
	
	If you do find a small defect, don’t be too quick to put the garment aside. 
If it’s small enough that no one looking at it could detect it, you may 
be able to show it to a floor manager, get a decent price reduction, and 
walk out with quite a bargain. If an item isn’t perfect, 10 to 20 percent 
is a fair discount to ask for, depending on the damage. If the item is just 
dirty, stores often give you 10 percent off for dry-cleaning.
	
✓	If you didn’t actually try on the garment, make sure it wasn’t misla­
beled. There may be a different size on the inside than is marked on the 
store label, for example.

 Chapter 7: Building Your Wardrobe: Your What- and Where-to-Buy Guide
Knowing Where to Shop
Many places try to get you to spend your hard-earned dollars in their retail 
emporium. Each type offers different advantages and disadvantages, and you 
should know what options are near you so that you can make an informed 
choice of where to purchase your clothes. 
Department stores
Department stores offer you the biggest selection of clothes to choose from, 
which can definitely be a time saver. Many department stores are part of 
national chains, like Macy’s, which because of their buying power, can offer 
attractive prices. A department store is also a one-stop shop, so that you 
can buy not only clothes, but also shoes, accessories, coats, and jewelry. But 
sometimes having so much to choose from can end up being confusing and 
make it harder to decide. And the sales help in a department store can be hit 
or miss. 
Each department store is slightly different, some being more upscale than 
others. They all have sales, so you can save money on quality clothes if 
you’re willing to be patient. It’s also very easy to return clothes because even 
if you’re not nearby the store from which you actually purchased the item, 
you can return it to a different branch. 
Dressing room etiquette
The advantage of shopping in a store is that you 
can try on the clothes before buying them (duh!). 
That means going into a dressing room, which 
should be a straightforward enough activity, 
right? But there are rules, especially if you’re 
shopping in a store you go to often. If you bring 
in a large amount of clothing, put the items back 
on the hanger after you’re done trying them on. 
It doesn’t have to be perfectly done, but leav­
ing a mess in the dressing room is not proper 
etiquette, nor does it fit in with the fabulous 
new you. Also, don’t be afraid to ask for bigger 
or smaller sizes, other items that you remember 
seeing, and heels (or flats) in your size to see 
how that particular outfit will look. At some of 
the less-expensive chain stores, you will not 
have the luxury of a tailor or shoe options to try 
on, but at department stores you should be able 
to reap many of the benefits. After all, if you’re 
paying for something, you should get what you 
pay for.

Inexpensive and trendy stores
Let’s face it — everyone wants a bargain, but no one wants to look like 
they’re wearing hand-me-downs. Luckily, several chains offer the hottest 
clothes at really affordable prices. H&M, the Swedish chain that first spread 
across Europe, has landed in America and is quickly spreading itself from 
sea to shining sea. Forever 21 was founded in Los Angeles and now has over 
1,500 stores across the country. Other popular chains include Wet Seal, 
Charlotte Russe, and Urban Outfitters. 
These types of stores are great places to buy trendy items. While you may 
occasionally be able to find classic pieces in these places, their real forte 
involves fun jewelry, layering T-shirts, and look-at-me tops.
Fashion boutiques
Chain stores have buyers who shop for the entire chain. The buyers for 
boutique stores, often the owner, shop only for their boutiques. Although 
boutique buyers could choose the same dress that you’d find in Macy’s, usu­
ally fashion boutiques offer items that aren’t being sold everywhere else. 
Boutiques also generally have a much smaller quantity of merchandise, and, 
even if they do have the same dress that’s in Bloomingdale’s, it’s probably at 
a higher price. 
There are many more boutiques than department stores, and each one has 
its own personal vision. Most feature trendier items mixed with more classic 
pieces. The main advantage a boutique offers is service. The sales associ­
ate is both knowledgeable and helpful. And if you’re a regular customer, 
she’ll probably learn your tastes and may let you know when a new piece 
has arrived that she thinks you’ll like. Boutique prices may be a bit higher, 
but your overall shopping experience will also be quite pleasant. If you don’t 
have to worry too much about what you spend, a boutique could be the ideal 
place for you to shop.
	
Boutique shopping is a great way to help form your personal style. Most 
boutiques help you focus on what you like and are not as overwhelming as 
department stores.

 Chapter 7: Building Your Wardrobe: Your What- and Where-to-Buy Guide
Catalogues
The first mail-order catalogue was created by none other than Ben Franklin in 
1744. Although he was selling academic books, catalogue shopping has been 
a convenient alternative ever since (even though online shopping is now 
giving catalogues a run for their money).
Since you can’t touch or try on the clothes that you buy through a catalogue, 
you have to trust the catalogue company to do a good job in offering you 
quality merchandise. Many catalogue companies have thrived doing just that. 
Yes, you can send anything you buy back, in some cases even years later, but 
the repacking and mailing process is a pain. On the other hand, you can leaf 
through a catalogue while commuting or in bed. 
The Internet
Shopping for clothes online can be very efficient, saving you the time it takes 
to get to the store(s), the cost of gas, and the wear and tear that a day of shop­
ping takes on your body. Shopping online also eliminates having to fight your 
way through the crowds and increases your chances of saving a bundle of 
money because of the fierce competition between online markets. In addition 
to the savings, you get immediate access to the widest possible selection of 
merchandise, and you can shop whenever you want to, even at 3 o’clock in 
the morning. So why doesn’t everyone shop online? Usually for these reasons:
	
✓	You can’t try on the clothing. Of course, you can try it on after you buy 
it and (most of the time) send it back if it doesn’t work out. But that can 
take days or weeks and you have to put in the effort of rewrapping it and 
going to the post office. If you were in an actual dressing room, all you’d 
have to do is put it back on the rack. 
	
✓	You don’t get to feel the material and look closely at the way the gar­
ment has been made. Chapter 4 has information on why garment con­
struction is important. 
	
	Do what many online buyers do: Go to an actual brick-and-mortar store 
to try on and touch the merchandise and then go home and look for the 
cheapest price online. 
	
✓	You may have to pay extra for shipping costs. Many online stores these 
days try to lure you to make a purchase by offering free shipping. Just 
double-check that you don’t have to pay for shipping if you have to send 
something back. 

134
Part III: Stocking Your Closet without Going Crazy or Broke 
	
✓	You have to pay by credit card. Many people shy away from buying 
goods online because they’re afraid of giving out their credit card 
number. Of course many of those same people gladly hand their card to 
a waiter who could easily write down the number as well as the security 
code. While online shopping is usually safe and millions shop online 
with their credit card every day, the possibility does exist for fraud; 
however, because of the Fair Credit Billing Act, your financial risk for 
unauthorized use is limited to $50. 
	
	Because the e-retail industry knows that this fear is holding many people 
back, retailers are coming up with various ways to increase the public’s 
confidence. The buySAFE Web site rates over 300,000 e-retailers. Those 
that have passed its standards (which include examining each site’s 
encryption procedures) are allowed to display the buySAFE logo (see 
Figure 7-6). buySAFE also has its own shopping portal which provides a 
$25,000 bond on each purchase and 30 days worth of ID theft protection 
insurance.
	
	Another solution is to use PayPal. Your credit information is stored on 
PayPal’s server, and PayPal pays the merchant, so your credit informa­
tion remains in one secure place and is not given to the merchants. 
Not every online site accepts PayPal, but more and more are doing 
so. Another alternative is to buy a gift card, which both MasterCard 
and Visa offer. The gift cards do have limitations and fees, but as with 
PayPal, the company from which you’re purchasing doesn’t get to see 
your credit card number.

Where to look 
Almost every major clothing store has a Web site where you can purchase 
everything featured in its stores, and then some. No matter where you live, 
you can shop online at any store across the country and around the world. 
In addition to Web sites associated with the big clothing stores, thousands of 
online stores aren’t associated with so-called brick-and-mortar stores. These 
stores carry clothing that you can’t find anywhere else. So the more important 

135
 Chapter 7: Building Your Wardrobe: Your What- and Where-to-Buy Guide
question when shopping online is not how broad a selection there is but how 
to narrow it down so that you don’t get overwhelmed. There’s no easy answer, 
but you can employ a couple different strategies:
	
✓	Search by store. Type names of stores you already know (like Macy’s 
or Bloomingdale’s) into your browser, then search the site for the item 
you’re looking for. The downside of this strategy is that you’ll see only 
what that particular store offers and you may not be getting the lowest 
possible price. 
	
✓	Let someone else narrow down the possibilities. If you use Google 
Directory (www.google.com/dirhp), for example, and look under 
Shopping and then select Clothing, you get a list to choose from of every 
type of clothing, ranked by popularity (in Google). Just because a site 
is popular doesn’t guarantee that you’ll find anything you like, but it’s 
a good way to narrow down the sites you visit. (Of course on the Web, 
“narrow down” is a relative term. At the time I wrote this, Google offered 
324 sites under the women’s clothing category alone. So while this strat­
egy does narrow things down a bit, it’s still a large selection, and one 
you couldn’t possibly go through in one sitting.)
	
Mark your favorite sites so you can easily go back to them later. If you find 
a Web site that you like and know you’ll want to go back to it, put it on your 
Favorites list or bookmark it. 
Making allies online
While online shopping may tend to be a solitary pleasure, you don’t really 
have to tackle this job all by yourself. There are two sets of allies that you 
can use to help you: family and friends (of course) and bloggers. 
	
✓	Friends and family members: Let’s say you just spent an hour checking 
out some new Web sites that sell clothes. Make a list of the places you 
visited and your opinions about those places (“good selection of shoes, 
not much in the way of plus sizes, and so on”) and send that list to your 
allies in shopping. If they return the favor for sites they visit, you’ll soon 
have a good list of sites worth visiting, as well as those to stay away 
from.
	
✓	Bloggers: While you may not have the time to visit a lot of Web sites, 
bloggers do. It’s not hard to find fashion bloggers because most of them 
link to each other’s blogs, so if you find one, you’ll quickly be able to 
see who the other major bloggers are. They all have their specialties, 
and you’ll soon learn which blogs you want to check regularly for sales 
and other fashion tips. If you love fashion, reading all these blogs can 
become addictive, so try to be selective.

136
Part III: Stocking Your Closet without Going Crazy or Broke 
	
	To get started, go to Google (or your favorite search engine like Yahoo 
or AOL) and type in fashion blog to see a list. The ones listed at the 
top generally include sites that offer a directory of fashion blogs: www.
apparelsearch.com/Fashion/Fashion_Blogs.htm and nymag.
com/daily/fashion are two available directories as of this writing. 
	
One easy way to see what’s new on the blogs is to use RSS feeds, which are 
basically updates sent out by Web sites. You need a place to assemble these 
feeds, like Netvibes (www.netvibes.com). After you open an account, which 
is easy and free, you can create a fashion area and subscribe to the RSS feed 
on your favorite blogs. Then all you have to do is go to your Netvibes site to 
quickly see all the updates from the blogs you’ve selected. This can be a real 
time saver. 
Vintage and consignment stores 
When people clean out their closets, looking to give worn-out pieces to char­
ity, they usually give to an organization like The Salvation Army. But vintage 
clothing takes quite a different path. Just like a boutique owner shops for 
items that she likes among the clothing manufacturers, the owner of a vintage 
store looks for used clothing that stands out. Now there are thrift shops that 
represent charities where people may donate designer clothing, and if you 
have one in your neighborhood, great. But keep in mind that shopping in a 
vintage clothing store is not something you do to save money (not everything 
in a vintage store is inexpensive; in fact, it can be the opposite), but because 
you expect to find unique items to help you define your own personal style.
	
✓	Quality vintage clothing shops. At these shops, you’ll likely find original 
Dior, Chanel, and other very high-end designer dresses, blouses, skirts, 
and more. These pieces are great to have. Chances are there aren’t any 
others like them still around, so you never have to worry about being 
in the same dress as anyone else at the party. These vintage pieces are 
also a great way to express your sense of style. They show that you’re 
savvy enough to appreciate fine designer workmanship and bold enough 
to wear something different from everyone else. As far as cost, each 
piece is unique and is priced based on the designer, the workmanship, 
and the condition of the garment. 
	
	In some cases, you will be able to find a vintage designer piece for less 
than the original cost, but in others, the price could be very high. So 
don’t go vintage shopping thinking that used means you’ll get a bargain. 
In many cases the items have only been worn a few times, if at all. Just 
like classic wardrobe essentials though, a great vintage piece will stand 

137
 Chapter 7: Building Your Wardrobe: Your What- and Where-to-Buy Guide
the test of time, and if it’s in your budget, it could be well worth the 
investment.
	
✓	Thrift stores. These stores are another option when looking for vintage 
clothing. Chances are good that you won’t find the most high-end pieces 
there, but you never know what you may come across if you take the 
time to search through the merchandise. 
	
✓	Consignment stores. People who drop off clothes to these stores 
expect to get money for them when the clothes are sold. The people 
running such stores only take clothes that are in good shape, so the 
price may be a little higher, as both the store and the owner expect 
to make some money. Still the selection is decent and the prices still 
very reasonable.
Sample sales 
What happens to the designer wear that’s made to be shown to buyers but 
doesn’t get sold? Since they cost a fortune to make (because they’re all 
hand-made), rather than let them go to waste, they’re sold in what are called 
sample sales. While you may only know the very top names in fashions, liter­
ally hundreds of designers work in the fashion industry with their own lines, 
and they all have sample sales, so there can be lots to choose from, though 
obviously you can’t expect to find a wide variety of sizes as these clothes 
were made to be worn by models. 
To find out where the latest sample sales are being held, go to www.top
button.com. This site is free, but you have to register. Otherwise, you 
can purchase a copy of New York Magazine or Time Out New York at the 
newsstand. You can also find sample sales in other cities like Los Angeles, 
Chicago, and Boston, but there aren’t as many as in New York. Check 
www.dailycandy.com, which covers all the big cities across the U.S. 
and always has information on sample sales, boutique openings, and 
more. 
You can even find sample sales online now. Certain Web sites have sales last­
ing for 48 hours or so for designer merchandise. The good news is that the 
merchandise for sale isn’t just samples; the sites have excess stock, so you 
have a better chance of getting your size. A couple of good ones to check out 
are www.hautelook.com and www.gilt.com. After you register, you’ll get 
e-mails about upcoming sales.

Controlling Your Inner Shopaholic
A shopaholic is a person who needs to shop and does it excessively. If you’ve 
got the time and the bank account to afford to use shopping as a form of 
entertainment or therapy, then more power to you. But most of us don’t, 
and so allocating large chunks of both time and money to shopping for 
clothes poses dangers to those who get so caught up shopping that they 
leave reality behind and end up with bulging closets and skeleton-thin 
wallets. This section may not be able to help shopaholics lose their 
addiction to shopping, but it can help you improve your shopping 
experience and cut down both the time and money you spend to create 
a fashionable wardrobe.
Making a list and checking it twice
I know what you’re thinking, “Does she really think that every time I go to the 
mall or my favorite store, I’m going to make a list of what I need and stick to 
it?” Well, that is sort of what I’m saying, but hear me out. 
Most people make a shopping list before going to the supermarket, for sev­
eral reasons, the most important of which is so that, when they actually 
return home, they have what they need. The same idea applies to clothes 
shopping.
Many of us shop as a way to blow off steam and brighten the day a little. 
And that’s okay — sometimes. The key is that you have to be smart about it. 
Here’s a strategy you can use to make your shopping trips more productive, 
without losing all the spontaneity and fun: 
	
1.	With our list of “must-haves” in mind, take inventory of your closet 
(refer to the earlier section “Wardrobe Essentials”).
	
	 When scanning your closet, make sure every item you keep is a 10 — 
meaning each of your staple items must be the right fabric, must fit you 
perfectly, and must look like you bought it at the start of the season 
(even if you didn’t). 
	
2.	Make a list of what you actually need in your wardrobe. 
	
	 If you’re into gadgets, feel free to make this list electronically. 

139
 Chapter 7: Building Your Wardrobe: Your What- and Where-to-Buy Guide
	
3.	The next time you feel like just buying something, like so many of us 
do, buy something from the list. 
	
	 That way, you still get the boost of a shopping pick-me-up and are pro­
ductive at the same time, because in the process you got something you 
needed. 
	
Having  a wish-list of items that you want to save up for, hope for as a gift, or 
want in a less-expensive version is totally appropriate (and fun!). Some people 
have a folder of tear-outs from magazines of things they would kill for — and 
you never know when those items may go on sale. If you’re one of these 
people, you may not need a tangible list (when you see it you’ll know it), but 
it’s good to have these items stored in the back of your head for those “you 
never know” times!
Spur-of-the-moment shopping 
without busting the bank
Now I know what you’re thinking: You have a big party Saturday night, and 
you really want to buy something new to wear. Trust me, I get it! Before you 
run out and impulsively buy an expensive new dress, try this: Go into your 
closet and pick out the dress that already fits you perfectly and hugs you in 
all the right places. Then hit the stores with that dress in mind and look for 
a statement necklace or a pair of beautiful chandelier earrings to spice it up. 
Going in with this approach lets you add another dimension to your ward­
robe, because not only will you have a knockout necklace for your big party, 
but next week, you can wear that same piece of jewelry with jeans and a 
white T-shirt! Often, you’ll find that just buying something new gives you that 
natural high. 
You can also look at sales racks. Because something is on sale doesn’t mean 
it’s of poor quality. Great pieces that don’t move in a certain amount of time 
are forced onto the sales rack to make space for new inventory. When you 
scan the sales rack, keep the basics on your mind. That perfect pencil skirt is 
often waiting right there. The sales rack is also good for those impulse pur­
chases. If you see a trendy item that you want but know won’t last through 
the season, buy it on sale.
Electronic aids
Use electronic devices — digital cameras or phones with cameras, for 
example — to help avoid buying something you’ll regret or don’t need:

140
Part III: Stocking Your Closet without Going Crazy or Broke 
	
✓	Take a picture of a top or skirt in your closet that you’re looking to 
match. This way when you are in the mall, you can refer to the picture 
while on your hunt. 
	
✓	Need a second opinion? Camera phones can help. It’s always a good 
idea to e-mail a friend who is honest if you are teetering on buying that 
perfect outfit (especially if it’s not refundable!). 
	
	Many stores don’t allow you to take photos of yourself in their cloth­
ing, but some don’t make a fuss. Many high-end stores (especially bou­
tiques) enforce this rule because they don’t want people taking pictures 
of their items and then copying their designs. So if you try to take a pic­
ture and the salesperson tells you they don’t allow it, just apologize and 
put your camera away. If the salesperson doesn’t mind and thinks you’re 
a serious buyer who’s just getting reinforcement from a trusted friend, 
she may even take the picture!

Don’t get stuck in a fashion rut. Try new things, experiment.
Cynthia Rowley, Fashion Designer
K
eeping up with fashion is a full time job and you probably already have 
at least two of those! Luckily there are people who earn their living by 
keeping track of what Paris, New York, and Milan are producing, and in this 
chapter I show you who the best ones are and how to make use of their skills.
Calling In the Pros
Most professionals don’t perform their respective 
service on themselves. Obviously there are many 
procedures that doctors or dentists couldn’t do for 
themselves even if they wanted to, but even most 
lawyers seek outside counsel if they run into a legal 
problem. And the reason is that when it comes to a 
personal problem, your emotions can get in the way 
of your reasoning ability and cause you to make mis­
takes. (How many women hang onto their long hair 
when in fact they’d look far better with a shorter hair­
cut? Check out the “Ambush Makeovers” I do every Friday 
on Today, and you’ll know the answer is “Too many!”). 

142
Part III: Stocking Your Closet without Going Crazy or Broke 
The point? When it comes to creating (or refining) 
your style, you can probably use a professional 
fashion expert. If you tend to look like the woman 
in Figure 8-1 when you try to get dressed up, maybe 
the time has come for you to consult with an expert. 
Fortunately, you have a few options to get the help 
you need. 
The following sections describe what fashion con­
sultants and personal shoppers do and explain 
where you can get help even if you’re shopping 
online. To find out how fashion media can help, 
head to the later section “Fashion Media: Where to 
Look for Fashion and Style Help.”
There are two basic services a professional fashion 
expert can offer: 
	
✓	Teaching you how to dress in general, using 
the clothes you have and/or adding to your 
wardrobe 
	
✓	Selecting what you need to wear for a particu­
lar event, which usually means going out to 
shop for you 
In many cases, one person does both, but because 
you can hire a professional to do one or the other, 
you have to let them know what services you 
require.
Using a professional 
­consultant
If you have some money in your budget to spare, hiring a fashion consultant 
may be the route for you.When you pay for something, you tend to put more 
importance on it. If a friend tells you to stop wearing so much black, you may 
not heed her advice, but if a trained professional whom you’re paying tells 
you the same thing, you are more likely to listen up! (The woman who wrote 
this book with us, Dana Ravich, is actually my consultant whenever I have a 
question about something!)
	
There are distinctions between a fashion consultant and a fashion stylist. A 
fashion consultant generally works with private clients, while a fashion stylist 
generally works doing photo shoots for magazines, television, and so on. 
Figure 8-1: Don’t know 
which pieces work 
together and which don’t? 
Time to call in the pros.

143
 Chapter 8: Eliminating Fashion Confusion
What a consultant does
A fashion consultant is going to look at you, ask you questions about your 
lifestyle, examine your closets and tell you what to keep and what to get 
rid of, and push you in the right direction when it comes to the way you 
dress. She may also put together outfits with items already in your current 
wardrobe (see Figure 8-2). And if you choose to take it further and decide to 
spend the money to add more items to your wardrobe, then the consultant 
will actually take you shopping. Or the consultant may go to the stores on 
her own, pick out several items, and then bring them to you — a more practi­
cal option if you need help with a specific event and not an overhaul of your 
whole wardrobe. Either way, if shopping is involved, in addition to the cost of 
the consultant, you’ll also be spending money on items for a new wardrobe.
Figure 8-2: A fashion consultant helps you put the pieces of your fashion puzzle together.

144
Part III: Stocking Your Closet without Going Crazy or Broke 
Selecting a consultant
The best way to find a fashion consultant is by personal referral. You could 
look in the phone book, or go online to a Web site like www.fashion-411.
com, but before you put your image in somebody else’s hands, you want to 
make sure they know what they’re doing. If none of your friends or family has 
ever used a fashion consultant, ask the owners of any boutiques in your area. 
They should be a reliable source. 
When you’ve narrowed down the field, ask the two or three you like best to 
provide you with referrals and call them. 
Before you choose any fashion consultant, do the following: 
	
✓	Get a referral. Since referrals tend to be satisfied customers, you can’t 
expect to get very many negative reviews. But ask the referrals how this 
consultant operated: Did she ask a lot of questions about their likes and 
dislikes, or was she dictatorial? You may be happy to just put yourself 
into someone’s hands, but if not, you’d better know ahead of time. Also 
find out whether the store owners they visited knew the consultant well. 
Finally, ask questions to find out whether she was very busy: Did she 
leave the minute the time was up to go meet another client? (This could 
be a good sign, because it means she’s talented, but it may also mean 
that you could become like Cinderella when the clock strikes midnight.) 
	
✓	Have a consultation with the person you’re considering. Check out the 
consultant’s style. Is her personal style one you’d like to emulate? When 
you speak to her, does she understand your lifestyle and your personal­
ity? Even if your goal is not to look exactly like a professional fashion 
stylist, you should still expect to get help defining a style that works for 
you. You should also ask the consultant what her background is to get 
an idea of her level of experience.
What you can expect to pay
The cost of a consultant varies according to where you live (consultants in 
small towns usually charge less than those in big cities) and the consultant’s 
experience. The consultant will charge in one of two ways:
	
✓	By the hour: Most consultants charge this way. The hourly fee can 
range from $50 to $300 per hour, and usually a minimum of three hours 
is required. At the mid-level price range (about $150 an hour), your mini­
mum cost is going to be $450. (And that doesn’t include the cost of the 
clothes!) 
	
✓	Day or half-day rate: Stylists who charge this way, charge you a flat fee 
for the day. 

145
 Chapter 8: Eliminating Fashion Confusion
In addition to the consultation rate, some consultants get a commission from 
the stores they take clients to. Some simply pocket that commission (and 
may push you to buy more clothes in order to fatten their wallets), while 
others offer you that percentage as a discount for your purchases. While the 
second option may sound like it’s more to your advantage, if the consultant 
charges a higher hourly fee, it may not be. 
Using a department store’s 
personal shopper 
Many major department stores allow you to come into the store and work 
with a personal shopper for free (ah, yes, I said free!) Saks Fifth Avenue for 
example, has the Fifth Avenue Club. You just call, make an appointment, give 
your sizes, and when you show up to shop, there’s a room with all of your 
desired looks waiting for you! There is no minimum amount you need to 
spend and no fee; you just need to make an appointment. Call your favorite 
store to see whether it offers this service. Other department stores that have 
personal shoppers include Macy’s (Macy’s By Appointment), Nordstrom, 
Bloomingdale’s, Belk, and J.Crew. 
You’re also likely to find a personal shopper in the smaller department stores 
in only one or two cities. These stores offer this service as a way to stay com­
petitive with the larger chains. However, you won’t find personal shoppers at 
lower-price stores, such as Target of Kohl’s, because the prices are already 
so low, they don’t offer this additional service.
If you use a personal shopper, keep the following things in mind:
	
✓	Using a personal shopper can be a time saver. If you pick something 
out that doesn’t fit you, the shopper will go back to the floor to get the 
right size. And if she knows her merchandise, once she sees something 
on you and realizes why it works (or doesn’t), she’ll be able to get you 
other items to try that should work on your body. 
	
✓	While a personal shopper is there to sell clothes, the stores recognize 
that if a personal shopper is too pushy, she’ll turn away customers 
rather than make sales. So for the most part, your personal shopper will 
be as helpful as possible without seeming overbearing (though remem­
ber, she does get paid a commission). 
	
✓	If you’re going to ask the advice of a professional, be willing to accept 
at least some of it. If you walk out of a store with shopping bags full of 
clothes that you would have bought without anyone helping you, there’s 
no point in using a consultant of any kind. You have to be willing to trust 

146
Part III: Stocking Your Closet without Going Crazy or Broke 
this person to take you out of your comfort zone. Just make sure every­
thing you buy is returnable. That way you can afford to be a bit more 
daring when you shop.
	
✓	It’s always wise to call ahead to make an appointment. You may go into 
a store and find that one of the personal shoppers has an opening, but 
they’re usually busy. 
	
✓	Since either a consultant or personal shopper is going to be right there 
in the dressing room with you, make sure that you’re wearing underwear 
that you don’t mind being seen in.
Fashion Media: Where to Look 
for Fashion and Style Help
The fashion media may not create styles, but if they decide to blow their 
collective horns about a particular designer, you can be sure that very soon 
people everywhere will be wearing that designer’s creations (for a more 
in-depth look at the role the fashion media play in setting a trend, head to 
Chapter 6). 
Print and online media
The Grande Dame of fashion media is certainly Vogue. Begun in 1892, Vogue’s 
current editor is Anna Wintour. While she’s known for having her own style, a 
famous bob haircut (which she adopted at the age of 15 and never changed), 
and ubiquitous sunglasses, as an editor she’s actually very much for change, 
always championing young, new designers. And while Vogue gives expanded 
coverage to designer wear, in a televised interview with Barbara Walters, 
Wintour admitted that “Jeans and T-shirts can be equally fashionable as an 
Oscar de la Renta ball gown.” Figure 8-3 proves her point.
But any fashion magazine can help you when you’re trying to figure out the 
current trends and, more importantly, what looks work for you. Buy one or 
two fashion mags a month, and check out the Web sites of the others, and 
you’ll definitely be au courant (up to the minute!).
Many of the weekly magazines we all love to read also offer the hottest 
trends (admit it, you love to see what your favorite celeb is doing!). I work 
with Us Weekly, and every week you can find great buys and finds at every 
price point. To broaden your knowledge, check out some of these sources:

147
 Chapter 8: Eliminating Fashion Confusion
	
✓	Women’s Wear Daily is the fashion 
industry’s daily newspaper. Much of 
the information is on the business of 
fashion, which may interest you or 
not. While you may not want to pay to 
receive either the paper copy or get 
access to the full Web site, there’s plenty 
of good information (including photos 
from the latest fashion shows) that 
anyone can access at www.WWD.com. 
	
✓	Burda is the world’s best-selling 
magazine for those who sew their own 
clothes. But even if you can’t sew on a 
button, there’s a lot of good information 
within the magazine’s pages, or on its 
Web site (www.burdafashion.com). 
For example, you can learn a lot about 
fabrics through Burda, knowledge that 
will serve you well when checking out 
the clothes on the racks of your favorite 
stores.
	
✓	Figure, which bills itself as being for 
“Real Women,” is for larger women. It 
includes lots of tips on how to dress if 
you’re a size 14 and above.
	
✓	More Magazine is for women over 40. 
The magazine covers fashion along with 
many other areas of interest. 
	
✓	MaternityandStyle.com is a good place 
to get ideas if you’re expecting.
	
✓	Magazines from other countries: You 
can learn a lot by checking out maga­
zines from other countries. Some will be 
in English, such as Canada’s Flare, while 
others may be in a language you don’t understand, but because fashion 
is a visual medium, you may still get some ideas, especially from the 
French magazines, such as Jalouse, L’Officiel, and Madame Figaro, since 
many styles originate there before crossing the Atlantic. 
There are also magazines that don’t have a paper version but are strictly 
electronic. Among the top Webzines for those interested in fashion are 
Hintmag.com, Fashion156.com, Glossmag.ca (which is a Canadian company), 
Unvogue.com, and Glam.com. Like their paper cousins, Webzines cover more

than just fashion, but unlike them, you can find videos from the latest fashion 
shows and any late-breaking fashion news long before the print magazines 
can cover it. (Many of the women’s magazines have deadlines of three to 
six months, meaning the stories have to be written that far ahead of time in 
order to make it into the magazine.) 
TV goes high fashion
Though fashion was never off the radar of women, in recent years, it’s been 
even more in your face with the advent of a multitude of television shows. 
It began with Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and exploded into more reality 
shows covering every aspect of the fashion business, and turning models and 
fashion professors into superstars overnight. 
Many reality shows are centered around fashion. Here are a couple of my 
favorites:
	
✓	The Fashion Show (Bravo) will keep you glued to the TV. Fifteen profes­
sional designers compete in this series for a chance to have their cre­
ations sold in the retail market. Over $100,000 is also at stake! Designer 
Isaac Mizrahi and Grammy Award-winning performer and actress Kelly 
Rowland run the show. You really get to see what goes into the making 
of a clothing line. 
	
✓	What Not to Wear (TLC) is also extremely entertaining and informative. 
The show teaches women how to find their personal style. Hosts Stacy 
London and Clinton Kelly take someone who dresses frumpy and give 
her a fabulous new look.
While some of these shows are more educational than others in that they 
focus on teaching you about how to dress, they’re all fun. If you enjoy watch­
ing them, go ahead. (Just don’t watch them instead of my fashion pieces on 
Today!)

W
hen you’re out and about, be it at the office or a 
special occasion, no doubt you want to look your 
best. Without the right information, getting ready for a big 
night out or packing for a weekend away can be very 
stressful. What you wear on a ski trip will obviously be 
­different from what you wear in the bedroom, but the 
­concept remains the same: You always want to look your 
best whether you’re on the slopes, in the boardroom, or 
at the grocery store.

▶	Knowing what to look for in blouses and sweaters
▶	Understanding skirt and dress styles
▶	Finding the perfect pants 
I think every woman needs at least one pair of jeans that she absolutely loves! 
Selita Ebanks, Victoria’s Secret Model
D
o you wake up in the morning, open your closet, and pull out the same 
pair of pants or skirt every time? My guess is you do. Well, that’s okay. 
We all have pieces in our wardrobe that we just can’t live without. And, for 
the most part, it’s fine to wear those pieces over and over again, provided 
that they are 10s and as long as you mix and match them with a 
variety of different tops. 
Before the late 1800s, women always wore dresses. 
Obviously, that’s not the case today. Women nowa­
days have an overwhelming variety of clothing 
and styles to choose from: pants, dresses, blouses, 
skirts, and more. The key to being stylish is to 
make sure that each piece you put on works with 
your shape and the items you pair with it. This 
chapter lists the basic wardrobe pieces and explains 
how you can use them to express your style while 
remaining true to your personality and body type. 
Tops First: Blouses 
and Sweaters
The right sweater worn with jeans can make for a very sexy outfit. So what’s 
the “right” sweater? Depends on your body type. Different materials and cuts 

152
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
work better on certain body types. If you’re larger on top, you can project a 
slimmer appearance by wearing a more fitted, longer sweater (bulky sweaters 
just make you appear larger). The same holds true for blouses: Just because 
you love a blouse you see in a store window doesn’t mean that that blouse is 
the one for you. A beautiful blouse with ruffles draws attention to your upper 
half. If you’re an apple shape, you’d do better with something simpler on 
top so as not to draw too much attention to an area you’d rather minimize. 
If you’re a pear shape, a ruffled blouse accentuates your top half and draws 
attention away from your hips, which is the goal. The following sections 
explain what to look for to make sure your tops look and feel great on you. 
A fitting start: Getting a good fit 
You face a lot of choices when you go to buy a blouse — fabric, color, and 
pattern — but the number one reason to buy, or not buy, a blouse is fit. 
No matter how great the blouse looks on the rack, if it doesn’t fit your body, 
then it won’t look good on you.
How can you tell whether a blouse fits or not? Here are some guidelines: 
The blouse is too big if 
	
✓	You can grab handfuls of fabric.
	
✓	The neckline won’t lie flat on your neck.
	
✓	The shoulders drop, causing the neckline to ride up.
	
✓	The sleeves are too long.
The blouse is too small if
	
✓	The button line pulls, especially across the chest area.
	
✓	It feels tight when you cross your arms.
	
✓	The sleeves are too short.
	
✓	You can’t roll up the sleeves because it’s too tight on your arms.
	
A shirt that fits nicely feels comfortable and allows you to move without 
making it look like you have no shape. In other words, it should make you 
look and feel like a 10 (refer to Chapter 2 for my 10 System)!

153
 Chapter 9: Dressing for Every Day 
Paying attention to cut
There are two ways to make a blouse or any article of clothing:
	
✓	Draping: You drape the cloth over a model, work to get the right fit, and 
then make a pattern from that one piece.
	
✓	Flat cut: You create the pattern first and then fit the pieces together. 
It takes a lot more effort to design with draping, plus there’s the added 
cost of the models, who can earn as much as $200 an hour. For that reason, 
blouses (and other articles of clothing) that have been draped are more 
expensive than those that have been flat cut. You can often tell whether a 
blouse was draped just by looking at it. If all the angles seem rounded, like at 
the shoulders, then it was draped. If it appears flatter, then it was flat cut. 
In better quality blouses, you also find different cuts: classic, slim, and 
skinny. The classic cut is looser than the slim cut. The skinny cut is fairly 
tight. Which cut you choose depends on your body type, your breast size, 
and where you plan to wear it. If you’re at work and need to move around, 
you’re going to want a fit that allows you to move easily, such as the classic 
cut; if you’re going out and want to appear a little sexy, then you may choose 
the slim or skinny cut.
Buttons to the left or right?
You may have noticed that the construction of a 
woman’s blouse is different than a man’s shirt. 
The most interesting difference is the location 
of the buttons: On a woman’s blouse, the but­
tons are on the left side; on a man’s shirt, they’re 
on the right. No one knows exactly when or 
why this change took place, but one interest­
ing theory is that buttoning a blouse from the 
left made it easier for ladies’ maids, who were 
responsible for helping the lady of the house 
dress, to get the buttons in the buttonholes. 

154
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
	
Higher-end brands, like Ralph Lauren, designate their blouses as slim cut, clas­
sic cut, and so on. But not all manufacturers define the cut of their blouses. 
And not all manufacturers make all three cuts. If you try on blouses by several 
different designers, you can see which designer’s line fits you best. When you 
find a blouse that fits you perfectly, see whether you’re interested in anything 
else in that designer’s line. Chances are, the designer’s other items will also fit 
you well. 
Style elements
For an article as basic as a woman’s blouse, an incredible variety exists. Each 
area of the blouse — the collar, neckline, sleeve, cuff, waist, and length — can 
have many different iterations. When you combine them, the variety seems 
endless.
Collar types
Originally collars were a separate item attached to the shirt. Today all collars 
come pre-attached. Out of the more than 50 different collar types, the follow­
ing are the most common:
	
✓	Conservative collars: The classic and the round collars (shown in 
Figure 9-1) are the most common and conservative, and they work with 
all body types. You really can’t go wrong choosing this collar style.
	 	
	
	
Figure 9-1: Conservative collars.

155
 Chapter 9: Dressing for Every Day 
	
✓	Feminine collars: The ruffle, sash-bow, and shawl collars are the most 
girlie and feminine, and because they draw the eye to your neckline, 
they’re perfect if you want to draw attention to your upper half. Any of 
these collars, shown in Figure 9-2, are perfect with a pencil skirt to give 
your look a little flair. 
	
	
Figure 9-2: Feminine collars.
	
✓	Youthful collars: The Peter Pan and sailor collars, shown in Figure 9-3, 
tend to be on the youthful side. You see them mostly in little girls’ 
clothes. If you want to be taken seriously as an adult with style, I suggest 
you avoid these collars altogether. 
	
	
Figure 9-3: Youthful collars.

156
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
	
✓	Other collars: The Mandarin and the Chelsea collars are style statements 
in and of themselves, but they’re rarely considered high style. The 
Chelsea is a very old-fashioned look and is rarely, if ever, seen; the man­
darin collar looks a bit costumey. These two collars aren’t necessary to 
have in your wardrobe. 
	
	The button-down collar is more of a man’s shirt collar type. For women, 
stick with the classic collar. Figure 9-4 shows the Mandarin, Chelsea, and 
button-down collar types.
Figure 9-4: Other types of collars.
Necklines
Not all shirts have a collar, in which case the neckline is what shows. 
Because some necklines may suit you more than others, they’re an important 
factor to consider. The following list describes the most common necklines:
	
✓	Conservative necklines: The boat neck and the jewel neck, shown in 
Figure 9-5, are more conservative. The boat neck covers you to the neck, 
but because it opens wider at the shoulders, it makes your shoulders 
appear broader, which in turn makes your waist look narrower. If you’re 
on the small side on top, have narrow shoulders, or want to minimize 
the waist area, this neckline is great for you. The jewel neck is a round, 
flat neckline that works well when you want to wear a fabulous necklace. 
The jewel neck works for every body type and won’t draw attention 
unless, of course, you accessorize. 

157
 Chapter 9: Dressing for Every Day 
	
	
Figure 9-5: Conservative necklines.
	
✓	Feminine and flirty necklines: The halter, keyhole, one-shoulder, and off-
the-shoulder necklines are the most feminine and flirty. They expose your 
shoulders (or at least one of them), which is flattering for most women. 
(Shoulders are sexy, and bare shoulders are appropriate for any age.) 
The keyhole neckline exposes just a bit of skin, but makes the top fun 
and interesting. All of these necklines, shown in Figure 9-6, draw atten­
tion to your shoulder and neck area, thus minimizing the attention paid 
to your bottom half. 
	
	
Figure 9-6: Flirty necklines.

158
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
	
✓	Necklines that expose your décolletage: The scoop, square, sweetheart, 
V-neck, and wrap-over all expose your décolletage. The only difference 
is the actual shape of the neckline (as Figure 9-7 shows). If you like this 
area and want to show it off, these necklines do that. Again, an interest­
ing neckline always draw attention to that area and away from your 
lower half. 
Figure 9-7: Necklines that expose your décolletage.
Sleeves
Sleeves have less variety than other parts of a top, but finding the right 
sleeve is an important factor for many women. Obviously short-sleeves 
and sleeveless tops, as well as cap sleeves, are going to expose your arms 
(see Figure 9-8). If you have great arms and want to show them off, any of 
these lengths are good for you. 

159
 Chapter 9: Dressing for Every Day 
Figure 9-8: Sleeves that expose your arms.
Fortunately, if you don’t want to expose your arms, especially your upper 
arms, you have other options. In addition to long-sleeves, you can try the 
three-quarter length sleeve, which ends anywhere from just below your elbow 
to the middle of your lower arm, showing off just the thin part of your arm. 
They’re a classic, as well as a perfect way to keep cool in the warmer months. 
The bell sleeve is another option. This sleeve gets wider and bells out toward 
your wrist. Just like flared jeans draw attention to your lower leg, this sleeve 
draws attention to your lower arm. If you’re self-conscious about your upper 
arms, bell sleeves flatter you and make a style statement at the same time. 
Figure 9-9 shows the long, three-quarter, and bell sleeves.
Figure 9-9: Sleeves that cover your arms.

160
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
The extended-shoulder and princess sleeves (see Figure 9-10) are all about 
shoulders and femininity. The extended-shoulder is an unstructured look that 
softens the appearance of broad shoulders (because there’s no definition to 
where the shoulder ends and the arm begins). The princess sleeve has a puffy 
shoulder, a style that also softens the appearance of the shoulder area and 
gives the top some style.
Figure 9-10: Sleeves that soften the appearance of broad shoulders.
Shapes
The manner in which a blouse covers the upper half of your body is deter­
mined by its shape. In addition to length, here are some features that can 
alter the shape of a blouse (see Figure 9-11):
	
✓	Darts: Darts make a blouse more fitted and structured. If you have a thin 
midsection and you want to show it off, a darted blouse accentuates this 
area.
	
✓	Peasant or camp style with front and back yokes: This shape is a 
looser, unstructured cut, with more material around the midsection. 
It’s soft and feminine and hides your midsection because it just drapes 
around it.
	
✓	Shirred waist: A shirred waist is gathered at the waist line. This look is 
great if you have a thin waist and want to draw the attention there.
	
✓	Straight hem meant not to be tucked in: This shape is cut straight 
down, so it doesn’t accentuate your waistline, nor does it hug too 
tightly. If you are larger in the middle, this cut works for you because it 
doesn’t look too tight but still shows that you have some shape.

161
 Chapter 9: Dressing for Every Day 
Figure 9-11: A variety of shapes.
	
Length is another factor that determines shape. If you have a narrow waist, 
you can show it off by wearing a shorter length blouse. If you prefer to camou­
flage your waistline in order to appear longer and leaner, then a longer length 
may be better. 
Cute as a button
Most blouses have buttons that go all the way 
down the front or have several in the back near 
the neck to make the garment easier to put on 
and take off. Buttons in the front, back, or none 
at all are style choices you make when buying 
a top. In addition to providing a utilitarian or 
decorative purpose, buttons can clue you in on 
the quality of the blouse. The opening down the 
front is called the placket. If the stitching on the 
placket looks weak, or the stitches are far apart, 
then the garment is not top quality. 

162
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
A word about sweaters
Sweaters are tops made from knit material which, when used as a top and 
not an over-garment to add warmth, are generally tighter fitting and typically 
don’t have collars. Sweaters that have buttons down the front are called car­
digans. Others are pullovers, because you pull them on over your head (duh!), 
which is possible because their knitted material is more stretchy. 
	
✓	Fitted sweaters: Fitted sweaters are generally on the simpler side and 
typically worn alone or over a very thin layer. They can be made from 
everything from cotton to cashmere, and they come with a variety of 
necklines: round, V-neck, or turtleneck. They’re usually solid in color 
and are great to wear with jeans, corduroys, slacks, or even with a skirt. 
You can dress them up or down, depending on what you pair them with. 
Fitted sweaters show off your torso. If you want to show off your midsec­
tion, these sweaters are right for you.
	
✓	Chunky sweaters: Chunky sweaters tend to be very casual (they’re best 
paired with jeans or cords) and, for this reason, they aren’t really for 
work. If you’re on the heavier side, a chunky sweater makes you look 
even larger. If you’re on the petite side, a chunky sweater can over­
whelm you. 
	
✓	Fancy sweaters: If you want to wear a sweater out at night or to some­
place dressier, look for one with adornments. Fancy sweaters are 
especially appropriate and readily available around the holidays. Many 
sweaters are decorated with sequins, paillettes, or rhinestones, which 
make them dressier and more appropriate for evening wear. 
	
Sweaters by nature are clingy and show off your curves. If you are at all self-
conscious about this, sweaters on their own may not be the right look for you. 
Try putting a fitted sweater under a blazer or layer a sweater over a blouse so 
that it doesn’t cling as tightly.
Skirts and Dresses
Nothing is better than wearing a dress to work (or out!) that fits your body 
perfectly. Some women say that slipping on a dress is easy because there is 
very little thinking to do; just accessorize and go! 

163
 Chapter 9: Dressing for Every Day 
Dress styles
I wear dresses to the beach and to black-tie affairs. Dresses were once 
considered formal, but now you can pretty much get away with a dress 
anywhere, anytime. When choosing the right piece to wear, you must ask 
yourself many different questions regarding length, style, and what you want 
your overall look to be. You must make many choices before determining the 
perfect dress for any occasion. 
	
✓	A-line: An A-line dress (see Figure 9-12) is fitted at the waist and flares 
out from the waist down. This style looks good on everyone. It’s espe­
cially good for camouflaging your hips and thighs, so if you’re a pear 
shape or just want to hide this area, the A-line is the perfect choice.
 	
✓	Babydoll: Short, flouncy, and with an empire waist (see Figure 9-12), a 
babydoll dress may look more like a negligee than a dress. Even though 
the neckline is usually more round than plunging, it is sexy. The empire 
waist on this style camouflages your midsection by loosely draping over 
that whole area. If you’re trying to cover your tummy, a babydoll dress 
will work for you. If you’re apple shaped, be careful. The empire waist 
accentuates your bust and upper body, causing you to look even more 
top-heavy. This style is best for tall, thin types and tends to look very 
youthful, so take your age into account if you try to pull this off.
	
✓	Cocktail dress: The cocktail dress encompasses many styles (including 
the little black dress) and is appropriate at almost every occasion (see 
Figure 9-13). You can dress it up or down with the help of accessories. 
Cocktail dresses are generally around knee length — unless, of course, 
they’re tea length, which means they end mid-calf. They can be sleeve­
less, strapless, or have sleeves long or short. Because there are so many 
styles, you can easily find one that’s right for your body type. 
	
✓	Empire dress: The waist of this style of dress is set above the natural 
waistline, often just below the bust (see Figure 9-13). Similar to the 
babydoll dress, the empire dress can be any length and doesn’t have to 
be flouncy. This type of waist is good for someone with a smaller bust 
because it accentuates that area. It also takes your true waistline com­
pletely out of the picture. So if you have issues with your tummy, waist, 
hips, or anywhere below the bust line, this dress hides all that for you.

164
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
Figure 9-12: From left: A-line and babydoll.
	
✓	Evening gown: For formal, black-tie occasions, most evening gowns 
are floor length (see Figure 9-13). Because they’re not exclusive to one 
body type, anyone should be able to find an evening gown that flatters 
her body type. You just need to follow the body type rules and find one 
that works for you. Evening gowns can be very simple or have embellish­
ments like lace or beading. It’s really about personal style. My favorite 
evening gown is strapless, black, and simple.

165
 Chapter 9: Dressing for Every Day 
Figure 9-13: From left: Cocktail, empire, and evening gown.
	
✓	Jumper: A jumper is a sleeveless dress designed to be worn over a 
blouse, T-shirt, or sweater (see Figure 9-14). Jumpers can vary in length, 
but most hit right at the knee, and they’re often paired with pumps or 
high boots. This cut is pretty straight so anyone can wear it. 
	
✓	Mini: Any dress that stops 2 or more inches above the knees qualifies 
as a mini, shown in Figure 9-14, though the actual style can vary from 
a sheath to a shift. Micro-minis are even shorter. The mini is best for 
someone — apples, this usually means you — with thin legs. Regardless 
of your shape, if you’ve got great legs, show them off. Keep in mind, 
though, that the mini is a youthful look.

✓	Maxi: The maxi was a counterpoint to the mini, bringing hemlines down 
after they’d crept up. A maxi, shown in Figure 9-14, is a full-length dress 
and works for those who want to cover up their bottom half. It also gives 
you the appearance of being longer and leaner because of the one, long 
line of material.
	
✓	Sheath: A sheath dress, shown in Figure 9-15, is very fitted (so it shows 
off your curves) but has no waist, thus creating a long line that has a 
slimming effect. Sheaths are usually sleeveless. If you’d prefer not to 
expose your arms, this dress style isn’t right for you.

✓	Shift: A shift is a straight-cut dress with no waist (see Figure 9-15). Shifts 
are a great choice for those who don’t want something as fitted as a 
sheath but still want to wear a flattering dress. Again, because the dress 
has no waist, it creates a long, lean line in the torso; it’s a good style for 
every body type.
	
✓	Wrap: A wrap dress, shown in Figure 9-15, wraps around your body and 
closes in the front. Diane Von Furstenberg made the wrap dress famous 
back in the 1970s. These dresses are classic and flatter every body type 
because they accentuate the neckline, and the line where it wraps cre­
ates a long appearance. You can also wrap the dress so that it’s just the 
right fit — not too tight or too loose — which also is more flattering.

Skirts
The advantage that skirts and blouses have over dresses is that you can mix 
and match them to get many different looks. Take a bold, fun-patterned skirt, 
for example, and match it with a plain white T-shirt for a chic look, or pair a 
beautiful silk blouse with a pencil skirt and be ready to go. It’s all about how 
you mix and match.
If you’re like most women, you like certain parts of your body more than 
others. Because women have so many likes and dislikes, designers have 
created a plethora of skirt styles to fit any body type. The trick is (again) 
knowing what your best parts are, highlighting them, and choosing with 
­confidence clothing that works best on you. Take skirt length, for example. 
	
If your legs are skinny, you want to wear skirts that have hemlines ending at 
the widest part of your leg (your thighs) — in other words, miniskirts. This 
doesn’t mean you can’t wear other types of skirts; instead it means that a mini 
looks great on you. If, on the other hand, your legs are heavier, your hemline 
should hit the skinniest part of your leg, which is most likely somewhere 
below the knee, possibly even below the calf. 
In addition to skirt length, you have skirt style to consider. Here are some of 
the most popular varieties:
	
✓	A-line: A-line skirts are snug at the waist, barely touch your hips and 
thighs, and widen as they approach the hem (see Figure 9-16). Usually 
their length is below the knee. They’re a good look for pear-shaped 
women who are heavier in the hips and thighs and not flattering to 
women without much of a derriere. However, a large pattern can make 
an A-line more suitable for thin women.
	
✓	Flared: A flared skirt is an A-line with more material so that it swings 
and swishes about your lower legs as you walk, adding to the slimming 
effect (see Figure 9-16). A flare with an uneven hem, especially in a light­
weight fabric like chiffon, draws the eye away from your hips even more. 
	
✓	Circle or peasant skirt: With lots of material, these skirts hide every­
thing! They’re full length and very loose and drapey, as shown in 
Figure 9-16, so you really can’t see any shape underneath. So girls, 
whether you want to appear larger or smaller, this skirt does the trick!

169
 Chapter 9: Dressing for Every Day 
Figure 9-16: From left: A-line, flared, and circle skirts.
	
✓	Straight skirt: In a straight skirt, the material falls straight from the 
hip (see Figure 9-17). Larger women should have more length in their 
straight skirts, while thinner women look better if the skirt is shorter. 
If you’re tall, you can pretty much get away with a straight skirt being 
long or short, but if you’re shorter, showing more leg makes you appear 
taller. If you want to show off your curves, choose a straight skirt in a 
material that clings, like satin. Vertical details on the skirt, such as pin­
stripes or stitching, can add to the slimming effect. 
	
✓	Pencil skirt: Like the straight skirt, the pencil skirt’s material falls 
from the hip but is more fitted to the body to emphasize the hips (see 
Figure 9-17). These skirts aren’t ideal for those who need camouflage. 
If you have small hips, a high waist makes you appear more curvy. 
Generally pencil skirts are knee length, but the shorter your torso, the 
shorter the skirt should be to add length to your legs. Normally pencil 
skirts are plain and monochromatic.
	
✓	Tube skirt: The tube skirt is like the pencil skirt but longer, sometimes 
all the way to the ankle (see Figure 9-17). In fact, the only way you can 
walk in a tube skirt is if the skirt has a slit. This isn’t an easy look for 
most women to pull off because it is very fitted and clingy and shows 
everything on your lower half except for skin. Not to worry though, you 
don’t see many of these skirts around!

170
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
	
✓	Wrap skirt: A wrap skirt, shown in Figure 9-17, can be long or short. If 
you get one that’s the right length to flatter your legs, this type of skirt 
can look good on any body type. Like the wrap dress, you can adjust it 
to fit you perfectly. 
Figure 9-17: From left: Straight, pencil, tube, and wrap skirts.
Slacks
Many women think skirts are sexier than pants. Are they? The answer is, not 
always. Although a great pencil skirt can show off your curves and give you 
a sophisticated, classic look, the right pair of slacks can do the same thing. 
Find out how to choose your pants wisely in this section. 
Length
The most distinguishing aspect of slacks, besides the material (discussed in 
the later section “Pant material”), is length. Women have the choice between 
pants that are full length, ankle length, or capri style, which can reach 
anywhere from the calf almost all the way to the knee, where they actually 
infringe on the territory claimed by shorts.
	
Pant length is measured not from the top of the waist, but from the bottom 
of the crotch to the bottom of the pants leg. This measurement is called your 
inseam. It’s hard to measure your inseam yourself, but if you get help and keep 
it noted somewhere, it can be a very helpful measurement to know when buying 
slacks. (For information on other key measurements, refer to Chapter 3.)

171
 Chapter 9: Dressing for Every Day 
In determining the best length, keep these things in mind:
	
✓	The type of shoes you’re wearing: The biggest problem women have 
with pant length is that their height changes depending on the shoes 
they wear. If your pants are full length, you always want them to hit the 
top of your shoe or foot, if you’re wearing a sandal (see Figure 9-18).
	
	
Figure 9-18: The correct hem length.
The zakkerz 
Are you one of those women who wear flats to 
work and then change to heels when you get 
there? How many times have you worn a pair of 
pants and ruined the bottom of them because 
they are just too long for flats? Well, I have 
found the invention for you! The zakkerz (www.
zakkerz.com) is an item that you use to tem­
porarily hem your pants without using stitches! 
To use the zakkerz, follow these steps (it works, 
trust me!):
	 1.	 Roll pant leg up to desired length.
	 2.	 Wrap the zakkerz around the bottom of 
pant, with one end of zakkerz inside the 
pant leg and other end outside pant leg. 
	
	 The magnets bring the two ends of the zak­
kerz together and hold the roll-up in place.

✓	The area you want to highlight (for capris or pedal pushers): Pedal 
pushers or capri pants are supposed to be short. But exactly where they 
fall can change your appearance. Ideally you want to show your legs off 
to their best advantage. If your legs are thin, your capris should end at 
your widest part, the middle of your calf, which adds breadth to your 
leg. If your legs are heavy, your capris should end just below the calf in 
order to highlight the thinnest part of your lower leg. 
Pant rise
The rise of a pair of slacks is the distance between the crotch and the waist. 
Depending on your size, the rise for a normal pair of pants is usually around 
10 or 11 inches. Low-rise pants (which have waists below the normal waist 
line) and high-waisted pants (which have rises higher than the normal 
waist line) have different rise lengths. 
When you consider rise, don’t be unduly swayed by the current fashion 
(such as when low-rise pants are all the rage). Instead, consider what looks 
good on your body type: 
	
✓	Short- versus long-waisted: If you’re a short-waisted person, you gener­
ally look better in a low-rise pair of pants, because they make your torso 
look longer. If you’re long-waisted, a low-rise extends your torso even 
further — probably not what you want. 
	
✓	Apple versus pear: Low-rise pants show off more of the belly. So the 
more belly you have (if you’re an apple shape), the less appropriate a 
low-rise is for your shape because your goal is to minimize your midsec­
tion. (If low-rise is more comfortable for you to wear because it’s less 
binding around the middle, by all means wear low-rise pants. Just make 
sure you wear a long top and/or jacket to cover and elongate the area.) 
If you’re a pear and have a slim waist, you can wear low- or high-rise 
pants. Both accentuate your thin waist. 
Pant legs
In addition to the height of the hem, the shape of the leg is also very impor­
tant in determining what kind of pants look good on you (see Figure 9-19). 
	
✓	Straight leg: A straight leg drops straight down from its widest point, 
which is the part that touches the hips. This look is flattering for every 
body type. The straight line doesn’t accentuate the top or the bottom of 
the leg, nor does it attract the eye to any particular area. 

173
 Chapter 9: Dressing for Every Day 
	
	
Figure 9-19: A variety of pant legs. 
	
✓	Tapered: Tapered pants have a slight narrowing below the hips, all the 
way down to the ankle. Skinny pants are a style of tapered pants. The 
difference is that they hug your legs from top to bottom. These pants 
are better for those with skinny legs because they draw the focus to the 
legs, but because the pant leg gets narrower at the bottom, it accentu­
ates the waist. If you don’t want to accentuate your hips or waist area, 
avoid this style.
	
✓	Flared: Flared-leg pants widen toward the bottom. A slight flare is called 
a boot cut, meaning you can fit a tall boot under your pants. When the 
flare is extreme, it’s called a bell bottom. This style is great if you’re 
hippy or bigger in the waist area, because the flare draws attention 
to the lower leg. The width of the flare balances out the waistline and 
minimizes its appearance. 
	
✓	Stirrup: These pants have a piece of elastic that extends under the foot. 
Originally for people who rode horses (the stirrup stops the pant leg 
from riding up), stirrup pants are also used in other sports, like skiing, 
where the same thing may happen. 

174
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
	
✓	Cargo pants: These pants are especially popular as an alternative to 
jeans. Although traditionally they’re not very dressy and are best meant 
for play time, some versions have been made in dressier materials and 
can be worn as such. Cargo pants have pockets on the side of the legs 
and are best suited for women with skinny legs, because the pockets 
tend to make you look wider. 
Pant material
Pants can be made from any material, but certain materials have become 
closely associated with pants more than tops, mostly because of their dura­
bility. Pants get more wear and tear than tops, so they need to be able to 
stand up to all the activity.
Denim
The most ubiquitous pant material is denim, particularly blue denim. Blue 
jeans, originally made by Levi Strauss in the 19th century, started out as 
work pants and the material was made as sturdy as possible so that it would 
last. In the 1960s, jeans became part of the uniform of young people and then 
morphed into a piece of apparel that was worn by everyone. 
Jeans have their own look, and people of every size and shape wear them. 
They are a great staple, and so many styles are available that you can definitely 
find a pair that suits your body type and flatters your figure. Styles include 
low-waisted, high-waisted, straight leg, skinny leg, flared leg — just make sure 
you get the right size (measured by waist size and inseam length) and choose 
the style that suits you. Jeans tend to be form-fitting and show off your legs. If 
that’s not what you want, you probably won’t choose jeans for every occasion. 
Most people, though, feel comfortable in them. Even if your jeans are for casual 
wear only, having a pair that fits you really well is a good idea. 
	
If you’re going to go with only one pair of jeans for the season, pick a pair of 
dark denim, boot cut jeans. Dark denim is the most versatile kind, and boot 
cut is a safe choice because it fits most women and can go with most looks. 
Khakis
Khakis, or chinos, are made from a yellowish brown cotton twill fabric (refer 
to Chapter 4 for information on twill and other types of weaves). Khaki pants 
can range in color from olive green to a light tan. Like jeans, khakis have 
become a separate entity unto themselves. They’re very preppy and can be 
worn to informal occasions and also to work. The same rules apply to khakis 
as to any other slacks: Choose a style that works for your body type.

ven though I consider myself a put-together person, whenever I do a 
segment on television, I am even more aware of what I look like and what 
I’m wearing. Of course, the content and the information I provide to viewers 
is the most important thing, but what I look like is also important. If I look 
disheveled, how on earth are viewers (including you, hopefully!) 
going to be able to concentrate, let alone trust, what I say? 
The same holds true in any profession. People who look 
put together give the impression that they have things 
under control and know what they’re doing.
When you look put together, your overall confi­
dence improves, and that in turn helps you be more 
successful at work. Makes perfect sense, right? A 
recent survey conducted by careerbuilder.com 
offers support: Of the employers surveyed, 41 per­
cent said they tend to promote people who dress 
professionally. In this chapter, I discuss not only 
hemlines, but also how to help your bottom line.
Deciphering Office Dress Codes
You can wear various types of clothing in a business environment, but the 
key to climbing the ladder of success is understanding which style in your 
place of business makes that climb go smoothly and quickly. The following 
sections outline the different categories for business dress.

176
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
Business casual
With business casual, you have the freedom to be a 
little more stylish and a lot less conservative. Instead 
of the traditional business suits, you can wear pants, 
blouses, skirts, and dresses. These selections make 
business casual more comfortable and give you the 
opportunity to inject some more of your personal 
style.
	
If you’re the slightest bit confused about what to wear 
as far as business casual, take a cue from the men in 
your office. If they’re wearing khakis and polo shirts, 
you can use that as the standard, even though you 
don’t want to wear exactly that. Your goal is to distin­
guish yourself in a way that makes you look both styl­
ish and feminine. So instead of khakis, try sharp wool 
gabardine slacks or a pair of linen pants, and instead 
of a polo shirt, put on something more fitted that 
shows your curves without revealing any extra skin. Of 
course, if you do decide to wear khakis and a polo shirt 
(a preppy look), make sure the fit on each is a 10: The 
shirt should be fitted and in a feminine color (pink or 
another soft pastel), and the khakis can be capri length 
to show off your legs. Don’t forget a great pair of shoes 
(ballet flats are always chic yet comfortable). Figure 
10-1 shows how a pair of khaki pants and ballet flats 
can be a stylish yet comfortable outfit for work.
Dealing with some of the challenges
Business casual may be one of the most common 
forms of dress these days, but with no exact definition, 
getting dressed in the morning can be complicated. 
When you just had to choose from one of the five suits 
you owned, the limitation made choosing your outfit 
for the day a lot easier (shopping was a lot easier, too). Now that you have 
a lot more options (pants, blouses, skirts, and more), the selection process 
can be tricky. Following are some tips to help you adapt your business casual 
wardrobe when the need (or desire) arises:
	
✓	Keep a few items in your office to throw on when you need to. These 
items include a cardigan of neutral color and/or a scarf. Suppose you 
wear something to the office that’s a little on the edgier side and you 
have a meeting with a client late in the day and need to tone it down. 
Figure 10-1: Business 
casual: Put together 
and comfortable.

177
 Chapter 10: Dressing for Success
You can throw on the sweater or 
tie the scarf around your neck for 
a more conservative look.
	
	Keep a perfect pair of black 
pumps and a perfect pair of black 
flats at work, too. You’ll be glad 
you have the flats if your feet 
are killing you, and if last minute 
plans come up, you can dress up 
your outfit with the black heels.
	
✓	Even if your place of work 
doesn’t require you to dress for­
mally, show up decked out from 
time to time. You’ll feel great 
when people say “Wow, you look 
nice today!” It also helps people 
see you in a different light, which 
never hurts. And when people ask 
why the change (which you know 
some inevitably will), just say 
with confidence, “I felt like getting 
dressed up today.”
	
✓	You can be playful, but make 
sure it doesn’t turn from playful 
to too sexy. If you’re wearing a 
tight skirt that rides up when you 
sit and you’re in a business meet­
ing, part of you will constantly 
worry about how much of your 
legs are showing instead of the 
subject matter being discussed. 
While you’re tugging at your skirt, 
you could be missing an impor­
tant point, and others in the room may notice that you’re distracted. 
Plus any type of fidgeting often can be misinterpreted as anxiety or lack 
of preparedness. Why chance it?
Accessorizing to add flair
Aside from wearing more comfortable clothing, business casual dress is an 
opportunity to wear clothes with more flair. A scarf, earrings, and a nice pair 
of sandals can totally transform your work look (see Figure 10-2).
Figure 10-2: Adding flair to business casual.

178
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
	
Accessories can be a quick fix when trying to make an outfit pop. If you’re 
wearing a simple outfit, you can use statement jewelry to express your per­
sonal style. A chunky necklace or chandelier earrings can dress up any outfit, 
but don’t wear both — choose one or the other! Also don’t underestimate the 
power of a belt. An outfit that is simple or even a little roomy around the mid­
section can be totally transformed with a great belt. Play around with it. If you 
do go the belt route, make sure you don’t over accessorize. Earrings or a 
bracelet (or even a small necklace) is fine. But just one is likely enough!
Casual
From business casual we move to simply casual. 
The distinction between the two is slight, but 
important: Business casual doesn’t incorporate 
jeans; casual can bring denim into the mix.
How casual you can go depends on the attitude of 
the office environment and the industry in which 
you work. In the fashion industry, a lot of the fash­
ion PR companies tell their girls to dress casually. 
They want stylists to feel comfortable and relaxed 
when they walk in, so I often see women in jeans 
and funky tops, like the one shown in Figure 10-3. 
When I walk into a more corporate office environ­
ment, the look and feel is a little more formal and 
conservative.
In casual work situations, jeans have become the 
go-to item. Obviously, jeans come in countless 
varieties. Some jeans scream casual; others can 
be chic and appropriate. A beautiful pair of nicely 
fitted, dark denim jeans are always appropriate in 
a casual work situation. Try them with a sophisti­
cated blouse or sweater set for the office. Faded 
jeans with holes in the knees, on the other hand, 
are an entirely different story. Save those for the 
weekend.
	
If you dress casually every day, invest in a few 
great pairs of jeans and quality blouses and 
sweater sets. With these basics in your closet, 
you can make jeans fashionable yet appropriate 
for work. A fabulous sweater with a great scarf 
or a statement belt (or even a bold cocktail ring) 
paired with jeans not only makes you stand out in 
Figure 10-3: Done right, 
casual attire can be quite 
stylish.

179
 Chapter 10: Dressing for Success
the office, but it can also take you from day to night in a flash. Furthermore, if 
you’re wearing jeans and casual clothing to work, make sure you have a few 
great pairs of heels and at least one fabulous work tote. These items help pull 
an outfit together and make you look “done.”
Going casual without overstepping the bounds
Casual clothing can be very tricky for women, 
especially during hot weather. Baring too much 
skin can become too sexy and provocative, which 
can create problems that can affect your work and 
work environment.
Are shorts ever okay? That’s a tough question. 
The easiest answer is a simple no, but there may 
be times when shorts are okay. First, never wear 
shorts to work unless you work in a very (and I 
mean very) casual environment. Second, if you’re 
going to break this rule, wear a pair of tailored 
shorts that hit right above the knee and pair it with 
a sweater set or blouse (see Figure 10-4).
Because shorts tend to be a very casual look, you 
can wear them with ballet flats or flat sandals, or, 
if you want to take it up a notch, you can wear 
them with heels.
	
Most firms that allow casual clothing do have some 
restrictions. Even if the policy is “anything goes,” 
you must remember to always dress appropriately. 
Take cues from your co-workers. Often your super­
visor sets the tone. See what the appropriate level 
of dress is in your office, and add your personal 
flair to those clothes. For general expectations 
about any work attire, head to the later section 
“Universal rules for all kinds of business dress.” It’s 
always better to be a little overdressed than under­
dressed. You can never go wrong if you follow this 
advice. In fact, people will end up looking to you to 
set the standard.
Business conservative
Conservative business attire for women is a variation on the suit and tie 
requirement for men. You may wonder whether pant suits are as acceptable 
Figure 10-4: Long, tailored 
shorts paired with a blouse 
and heels can be casual yet 
chic.

180
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
as suits with skirts. The answer is yes. A suit in almost any color (I would 
stay away from white in a work setting) paired with a blouse, camisole, or 
shell always looks professional and put together.
Be sure to put your own style into this look. If you love jewelry, try adding a 
bold necklace or earrings. Make sure your necklace lays properly and falls 
in the right place and doesn’t compete with the neckline of your top or suit 
jacket. And keep the earrings on the smaller side or just wear studs (you 
don’t want your earrings to make you look like you’re going out for a night on 
the town).
Getting that polished look
Business formal for the woman who wants to look fashionable means being 
both professional and polished. To accomplish that, do the following:
	
✓	Buy nicer quality suits. You may not want to spend a fortune on the 
suits you wear to the office, but you do spend a huge portion of your 
time at work and in those suits. For that reason, spending a little more 
money to feel and look great is a good investment.
	
✓	Stick with suits in darker colors. You can tell more easily the quality 
of the material when the color is lighter. So if you’re buying a suit that’s 
not of the highest quality, it will be less noticeable in a darker color, 
which is why most people default to buying black.
	
✓	Make sure that whatever you wear fits properly. If you need to, spend a 
little more to get your suits altered.
	
✓	Keep your suits in great condition. Dry-clean them whenever necessary 
(do both jacket and pants or skirt together to keep the colors on both 
pieces looking the same) and possibly invest in a home steamer for last 
minute touch ups. You don’t have to dry-clean every time you wear a 
suit. I recommend just steaming it for the second wearing. Depending on 
how grueling your work days are, you can usually get away with wearing 
a suit two to three times before dry-cleaning it.
	
✓	Make sure that every item you wear complements the other items. 
Haphazardly throwing together your bag, blouse, and shoes projects an 
overall look of disorganization. Everything you wear from your coat to 
your scarf to your shoes, must (in some way) work together.
	
✓	Make sure your coat and briefcase (or work bag or tote) are as pol­
ished and refined as you are. What you look like when you enter and 
leave the building can leave a lasting impression. Nothing is worse than 
a fabulous woman in a great suit with the wrong outerwear. It’s like a 
great present with the wrong wrapping.

181
 Chapter 10: Dressing for Success
Being prepared for emergencies
To keep up your polished appearance, be prepared for emergencies because 
accidents do happen. If your hose or tights catch on your desk and rip, make 
sure you have another pair on hand so that you can dash to the ladies room 
before that big meeting. (Nail polish or hairspray also prevents a run from 
spreading.) And because winter time means static, keep static guard handy 
in case your skirt clings to your legs. A lint remover is another handy thing 
to have close by. For clothing rips, a piece of tape on the inside can keep you 
going for the rest of the day.
	
A convenient and relatively inexpensive way to be ready for any accident is 
to buy a Shemergency Survival Kit (see Figure 10-5). It holds mini-versions of 
everything you need in the event of a fashion emergency: folding hairbrush, 
hair spray, emery board, nail clipper, nail polish, nail polish remover, static 
remover, breath freshener, safety pin, shoe shine wipes, dental floss, pain 
reliever, double-sided tape, deodorant wipes, tampon, adhesive bandages, 
facial tissues. Can you believe it — all these items fit into this hand size pouch 
and the whole thing costs only $20! You can find one at www.msandmrs.com.

Letting your style stand out
Even if the attire is more formal at your place of work, you can still dress 
appropriately while expressing your personal style. To dress up a suit, a 
sweater set, or a simple blouse and look sharp and stylish while still main­
taining a more formal look, use the following suggestions:

182
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
	
✓	Wear statement jewelry: Statement jewelry is a great way to make a 
simple suit stand out (and it can also work as a talking point). If you 
wear a bold necklace, bracelet, ring, or earrings, someone is likely to 
say, “I love that! Where did you get it?” This may strike up a conversa­
tion with a co-worker you’ve never had interaction with before. It may 
sound silly, but that’s how relationships start sometimes!
	
✓	Wear something other than pumps, if allowed. If you’re in a conserva­
tive environment, pumps are definitely the safe way to go, but if you 
have some leeway, sandals are a great way to express your style. If 
you’re required to wear hose, wear a closed-toe shoe, no matter the 
season. Look to the women in higher positions to see what’s accept­
able in terms of shoes and hosiery. (For more on these topics, head to 
Chapters 14 and 16.)
	
✓	Have fun with your hair. Changing your hairstyle every so often can 
give you a new look without having to go out and buy a new wardrobe. 
Just always make sure your style looks clean and neat.
	
	If your hair covers your face or your bangs get in your eyes, your hair 
will be seen as an encumbrance to working most effectively. Need a styl­

 Chapter 10: Dressing for Success
	
You always want to feel and look your best, but remember to keep your audi­
ence in mind. Your goal is to wear what you’re comfortable in and also make 
the person or people you’re meeting with feel like you’re on the same page. In 
a work situation, you want to make the people you’re meeting with feel confi­
dent in your abilities. The way you look has a huge impact on how they per­
ceive you before you even say a word. So if you’re meeting someone who’s on 
the more conservative side, dress more conservatively. If you’re meeting with 
someone you know is on the trendier side, grab that trendy bag (or pair of 
shoes) you’ve been dying to wear.
Universal rules for all kinds 
of business dress
Understanding exactly what a business’s dress code is (and consistency in 
enforcing such a code) would certainly take some of the guessing out of what 
to wear to work. But some types of dress don’t fly in most offices. In the same 
careerbuilder.com survey, 64 percent of employers said they banned flip-
flops, 49 percent said no to miniskirts, and 28 percent didn’t allow jeans.
Whether dress code rules are written down in your office or not, certain 
guidelines are pretty universal:
	
✓	Whatever you wear to work, make sure it’s neat. No wrinkles or tears. 
If you have a pair of capri pants, but you’re not sure they’re appropriate, 
try ironing them. Being crisp and neat may put them over the edge from 
unacceptable to acceptable.
	
✓	If one part of your outfit may be pushing the envelope, pair it with 
something conservative. A sleeveless blouse, for example, can be 
acceptable when you wear it with a conservative skirt.
	
✓	Stay away from showing too much cleavage or wearing something too 
revealing. Tops made of translucent or wispy material are inappropri­
ate, unless you wear a tank or camisole underneath it. And if you find 
yourself wondering, “Is this too much cleavage?” it’s too much. While 
showing cleavage can be sexy and appropriate in the evening, it’s unnec­
essary and distracting in the office. Worse, it can undermine the impres­
sion of professionalism you want to exude. That doesn’t mean you can’t 
wear a blouse with buttons or a V-neck, just err on the side of more con­
servative in the office.

Dressing for Off-site Work Events
Some people travel all the time — the road warriors — while others rarely 
leave the office. If you’re going on a quick jaunt that doesn’t require an over­
night stay, your challenge is to try to keep your clothes looking fresh after 
you’ve been on the road for a few hours. On longer trips, you have a variety 
of challenges, like what to wear on the plane, what’s appropriate attire for 
the various activities and venues you may be at, and how to pack everything 
you need.
Looking stylish en route
You may be tempted to wear just any old thing on the plane (or bus or train) 
and change at the hotel, but I advise against it. First, lost luggage or a delayed 
flight can end up causing a problem. Second, you should always look your 
best while flying because you never know who you may meet (yes, I know I 
sound like your mother). The trick for dressing for the flight is to find cloth­
ing that is stylish, comfortable, and resistant to wrinkles. Some materials that 
fit the bill are
	
✓	Wool and silk: These fibers (refer to Chapter 4) have natural elasticity, 
which helps keep them from wrinkling.
	
✓	Synthetic fabrics: Fabrics such as nylon and polyester are less prone to 
wrinkling.
	
✓	Fabrics that use finishing agents designed to reduce wrinkles: Textile 
manufacturers began to add finishing agents to their cloths that change 
the chemical structure in such a way as to make fabrics that once 
wrinkled easily, like cotton, wrinkle free. When purchasing garments 
for travel, look for pieces that say they’re wrinkle resistant and still 100 
percent cotton. Some wrinkle resistant garments aren’t all cotton, but 
cotton polyester blends.
	
✓	Knits: Knits wrinkle much less than woven fabrics, so anything that’s a 
cable, ribbed, tricot, or jersey knit will remain wrinkle free. If you roll 
knits instead of folding them when you pack, they come out of your suit­
case wrinkle and fold free.
	
The Donna M clothing line (www.bbydonnam.com) sells something called the 
5 Piece Wardrobe (see Figure 10-7). Most of the items are under $100, and you 
can mix and match them hundreds of different ways. The pieces are comfort­
able, don’t wrinkle, and will take you from day to night in a flash. I wear them 
whenever I fly.

Wrinkles can get you coming and going. So pay attention to how you look 
from the rear as well as the front. If your pants are creased in the back or the 
label on your blouse is sticking up, you may make a good first impression but 
a lousy parting one. So check both the front and back in a mirror before you 
head to that meeting.

186
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
Daytime casual
Daytime casual varies from industry to industry and from state to state. What 
you may wear to a luncheon in New York among people in finance is differ­
ent from what you’d wear to a meeting in Los Angeles with people in the 
film industry. Most businesses have their own definitions of daytime casual. 
Unless you’ve been to a particular event or a place many times before, play 
it safe and slightly overdress. Better to feel a little uncomfortable because 
you’re slightly overdressed than to feel very uncomfortable because you’re 
underdressed.
One way to handle this type of dilemma is to dress in layers or use versatile 
accessories. If you’re wearing a jacket and no one else is, simply take the 
jacket off and you’ll fit right in. A silk scarf worn around your neck can make 
an outfit seem more formal. If it makes you seem too formal, you can simply 
take it off.
When you’re away from the office, sharing a meal with your colleagues is 
very common. If you know ahead of time where you’re dining, check out the 
restaurant’s Web site to get an idea of how formal or casual it is. That way, 
you’re prepared for each scenario.
	
If you travel for business, you’ll probably try to pack as few clothes as pos­
sible so that you don’t have to check your luggage. Convenient, yes, but it 
means you won’t have a spare blouse or skirt to change into if the one you’re 
wearing gets stained. Some materials are more stain resistant than others, and 
for those pieces that need more protection, you can use Scotchgard. Taking 
such garments on trips can be a good form of stain insurance. A quick and 
easy alternative, though, is to use a Tide Stain Stick, which removes stains on 
the spot. (I use my stain stick all the time!) Simply take off the cap and press 
down on the tip to release the stain fighter directly onto the stain. (Use cau­
tion depending on the material and item you’re wearing.) 
Daytime conservative
Some business trips or events require you to get dressed up. Perhaps you’re 
a lawyer going to court or pitching a new business to a firm. For men, the 
decision of what to wear is fairly easy because the key word is conservative. 
For women, dressing conservatively is a bit more vague. While dressing more 
conservatively used to mean wearing a skirt rather than pants, that’s no 
longer the case.

187
 Chapter 10: Dressing for Success
A suit (pants or skirt) always works well. Alternatively, a pencil skirt paired 
with a blouse or sweater set and accessories works in almost any setting. 
What about a dress instead of a suit? Yes, as long as it’s a simple dress 
­(especially with a blazer over it) — no cocktail or sexy dresses! It doesn’t 
need to be black, but it should be conservative in color; a conservative print 
is fine, too. Even a sleeveless dress that hits below the knee is perfectly okay.
	
Each situation is different, but the old way of thinking — that a woman must 
wear a suit for a presentation or big meeting — is antiquated. The key is to 
know your audience. And if you don’t, you’re better off being as conservative 
as possible. No one will fault you for being too conservative, but if you’re not 
conservative enough, someone may immediately judge you as a person who 
doesn’t “get it”— a group you never want to be in!
Feeling confident is so important, and finding the right mix between dressing 
appropriately and dressing with confidence is the ultimate goal in any situa­
tion. Even if you have to dress conservatively, it’s sometimes fun (and appro­
priate) to switch it up. So pack a colorful scarf and some dangly earrings, and 
if it seems like you can get away with standing out a bit, go for it.
Evening casual
It’s always good to feel like you’re wearing the right thing from the second 
you walk in, but evening casual gets a little tricky. A cocktail party could be 
at the fanciest hotel in town or a pub down the block. A trip to a ballgame 
could be in the stands or in a company box with a waiter in a tux. Following 
are some suggestions:
	
✓	The little black dress (LBD): You can rarely go wrong with the LBD 
(see Chapter 7) and a pair of perfect pumps. It’s the perfect solution if 
you know you’re going out after work straight away. To work, wear the 
dress with a blazer, pumps, and work tote; for evening, simply take off 
the blazer, switch out your shoes and bag, and add some dressy jewelry 
(see Figure 10-8).
	
✓	Statement jewelry: Adding bold jewelry is a great way to make your 
outfit more exciting.
	
✓	A suit with something pretty underneath: An outfit like this takes you 
from day to night and is the perfect solution if you know you’re going 
out after work straight away. If you wear a pant suit with a pretty blouse 
or tank underneath, you can go from your business meeting to a cocktail 
party simply by removing the jacket.

188
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
Figure 10-8: With the right basics, you can easily go from work wear 
to social wear.
Of course the final decision about what to wear depends on the activity 
involved. Dinner at a barbeque restaurant obviously rules out your LBD. 
There is nothing wrong (by the way) in saying to a co-worker you trust, 
“What are you wearing tonight?”

189
 Chapter 10: Dressing for Success
Evening fancy
A business black-tie affair is not a wedding or 
a party with friends, where you may want to 
show off your fabulous back or beautiful cleav­
age. Leave that look for your next big social 
event. At a business event, even one where you 
need to dress to the nines, keep your outfit styl­
ish but work-appropriate at the same time (see 
Figure 10-9). Following are some guidelines:
	
✓	Don’t wear anything too revealing. “Too 
revealing” is anything that implies sexy, 
especially when it comes to cleavage, 
though in some situations, you also want 
to make sure your upper arms and back 
are covered, too. If you decide to wear 
something that you have in your closet 
already but that may be too revealing on 
top, a wrap is always a great solution. It 
covers you up a bit while maintaining a 
pulled together and, depending on the 
wrap, dressy look. Many kinds of wraps 
are available, some with beading, that are 
perfect for evening wear.
	
✓	Choose an outfit that’s relatively easy 
to put on. You may not have a lot of time 
to change. If you have business meetings 
during the day, the meeting may run longer 
than expected. If you don’t have a female 
associate with you to zip you up, you’d 
better wear something that you can get in 
and out of on your own.
	
✓	Make sure whatever you take looks great 
once it comes out of your suitcase. A great trick to get rid of wrinkles 
is to turn your shower on hot and close the bathroom door. The steam 
from the shower helps take out any wrinkles and generally freshens up 
your outfit.
Figure 10-9: An outfit that’s 
elegant without being too sexy.

190
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
Your gown should be modest but it doesn’t have to be dowdy. Take advan­
tage of embellishments like beading, embroidery, rhinestones, velvet, and 
metallic pieces to give your look some sparkle. Make sure that you have a 
matching evening clutch because, again, everything should be fabulous like 
you. Buying a great silver or gold clutch to keep in your wardrobe is always a 
good idea as it can work with many different outfits.
	
All these warnings don’t mean that when you go out with co-workers, you 
can’t show a different side of yourself. Business black-tie affairs are prime 
opportunities to let co-workers see glimpses of what you’re like outside of the 
office (which is often interesting and fun). But you have to walk a fine line. If 
you have any question about whether something will work, don’t wear it. It’s 
better not to test the water until you know for sure.
	
If you don’t have a great work-appropriate formal dress and you’re just find­
ing your personal style, a black cocktail dress is always a safe bet and works 
well for many occasions. Choose one with a conservative neckline that doesn’t 
show cleavage. Some good options include a basic round neck, a square 
neck, or a boat neck (Chapter 9 describes the different kinds of necklines). 
Sleeveless can work if you pair it with a shawl or shrug that you can remove 
if appropriate.
Packing for a Business Trip
When you pack for a vacation or a weekend getaway, you usually have 
the luxury of packing more than you need. If you can’t decide between the 
strappy sandals and sparkly sling-backs, you can pack both and decide later. 
Packing for a business trip is an entirely different thing. Your goal is to pack 
the most functional clothing into the least amount of space because if you 
can avoid having to check your luggage, all the better.
You’ve seen the road warriors. They travel differently than everybody else. 
First, they’re usually carrying around a lot of electronic equipment, heavi­
est of all being their laptop computer and battery pack. Second, they almost 
never check their luggage (see Figure 10-10). They manage to fit everything 
into a carry-on.

191
 Chapter 10: Dressing for Success
Yes, packing everything you need 
into one case is a challenge, but it’s 
a must for an overnight trip. And it’s 
completely doable. Here’s how:
	
✓	Wear the clothing that’s going 
to take up the most room in 
your luggage. If a blazer is 
required, wear it on board. You 
can probably hang it up once 
you’re on the plane. If you’re 
flying from a warm climate to a 
colder one, wear your overcoat 
and stick it in the overhead 
compartment when you get 
on the plane. If you absolutely 
need two pairs of shoes, wear 
the one that would take up the 
most luggage space (which are 
hopefully the ones that are more 
comfortable).
	
✓	Roll, rather than fold, your 
clothing. As I said earlier, 
knits make great travel clothes 
because they can be rolled 
up without wrinkling. In fact, 
any type of clothing generally 
accumulates less wrinkles when 
rolled. Clothes made with span­
dex or polyester blends throw 
off wrinkles no matter how you 
pack them. (These fabrics are 
good not only for packing, but 
also for sitting in long meetings.)
	
✓	Make sure everything you take can be mixed and matched. If you’re 
going for two days, you need to pack only one and a half outfits rather 
than two. Black is an especially good color to wear because it doesn’t 
show any stains that may splash your way.
Figure 10-10: Ready for a business trip.

192
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
	
✓	Choose things that you can wear multiple times. If you have a pair of 
straight-legged black pants and a black pencil skirt (which has less fabric 
so packs easier) and a pair of black pumps, all you need are a couple of 
monochromatic tops and you can go for quite a few days that way.
	
✓	Choose lighter rather than heavier clothing. Because it may be cold on 
the plane and many airlines no longer give blankets, a cardigan is a good 
idea because it can also substitute for a jacket. Instead of bringing jeans 
to lounge in your room (if you don’t plan to wear them when you’re not 
working), take along a pair of lightweight sweat pants instead. They take 
up less space.
Though more companies are cutting their travel budgets these days, busi­
ness travelers will never completely disappear. If you find yourself one of 
them, don’t allow being on the road make you any less fashionable.

“The sexiest thing on a woman is a little black dress.”
Tyson Beckford, Model/TV Personality
I
f you’ve been reading this book straight through, you know 
by now that I want you to feel like a 10 anytime you leave 
the house. When you head to the market, you should look 
put together in your sweats or jeans. When you’re off 
to work, you should look and feel like you’re ready for 
a productive day. And when you’re getting ready for 
a special occasion, well, the fabulous you better be 
ready for a fabulous night out!
In this chapter, I explain the differences between 
white tie, black tie, and cocktail attire; how to dress 
for holidays and weddings; and how to shop for 
whatever else you may have coming up that falls 
in between!
Evening Wear
How many times have you received an invitation in the mail and said to your­
self, “What am I going to wear to this!?” Well, we’ve all been there, excited 
for an occasion but less than thrilled about deciding what to wear to it — 

194
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
especially when you don’t quite know the fashion rules that apply to the 
­different types of events, be they white tie, black tie, cocktail, or something in 
between. It can be confusing and the rules are a bit subjective, but I steer you 
in the right direction in this section.
	
In real estate, the key phrase is location, location, location. When deciding 
what to wear for an evening out, the same phrase applies. When picking out 
your attire, you have to keep in mind where you’re going and who your audi­
ence is.
Dressing for a cocktail party
Cocktails anyone? Now we’re talking my language! A 
cocktail party can celebrate many different occasions. 
Some people hold cocktail parties just for the fun of it 
while others center this type of party around birthdays, 
anniversaries, promotions, and so on. A typical cocktail 
party usually starts somewhere between 6:00 and 
9:00 p.m. and lasts for a couple of hours. Light food — 
a selection of hors d’oeuvres, for example — is served, 
but not a sit-down dinner, hence the name cocktail 
party!
What should you wear to a cocktail party? This type of 
event is much more casual than a black-tie event but 
dressier than a dinner out with friends. The following 
can clear up any confusion you have about cocktail 
attire.
	
✓	Dress length: If you wear a dress, cocktail length 
is the way to go (obviously). That means that your 
dress should hit your leg right below the knee, 
as shown in Figure 11-1. But because there are 
no strict rules when it comes to a cocktail party, 
if you have fab legs, feel free to wear a shorter 
dress. How short should you go? With a cocktail 
party, you have a lot of leeway. How short you 
can go depends on a few things. Is it business or 
purely social? When it’s business, it’s still safe to 
wear something above the knee as long as it’s not 
a mini, but if you have doubts, always err on the 
longer side. If it’s purely social, use your judgment. 
In this case you can get away with something 
shorter.
Figure 11-1: A dress 
that hits right below 
the knee is always a 
safe bet for a cocktail 
party.

195
 Chapter 11: Très Chic: Threads for Special Occasions
	
	For cocktail parties, you aren’t limited to 
cocktail dresses. If you feel more comfort­
able in a two-piece outfit, go that route. For 
example, a sequin skirt paired with a beau­
tiful cashmere sweater is perfect cocktail 
attire (see Figure 11-2). You can also go 
with a beautiful pair of slacks and a dressy 
blouse. Wear what you look best in. 
“Cocktail attire” is a looser term than 
“black tie.” You’ve got room to play 
around, so play!
	
✓	Color: What is the appropriate color 
to wear to a cocktail party? Well, that 
depends on where the function is and on 
what day of the week. A little black dress 
always works. But if you’re always in your 
LBD, try to get away from that. If you’re 
heading to a work cocktail party at 6:00 
p.m. on a Tuesday, I suggest sticking with 
more neutral tones in a fabric, like wool or 
silk, that’s not shiny; avoid the red strap­
less satin dress. If, on the other hand, 
you’re going to your best friend’s home 
on a Saturday night for a soiree, go for it! 
No colors are off-limits, as long as you’re 
season appropriate. (See Chapter 5 for 
more on color.)
	
✓	Accessories: Obviously, the accessories 
you choose depends on what dress you 
decide to wear. I love wearing simple 
dresses and switching up my acces­
sories. Bold statement necklaces or 
chandelier earrings always complete an 
otherwise plain-looking dress. If your 
dress already has a lot of embellishment, go simple with the accessories. 
Fun, fun, fun. This is the type of event where you can really express your 
personal style, especially with the right statement piece.
	
If you question what to wear, don’t be afraid to ask other women whose style 
you trust and who are attending the same event. Other partygoers may offer 
some clues as to what is the most appropriate thing to wear. Maybe one of 
them has been to this venue or knows the crowd better than you do and can 
give you guidance. For example, if the event you’re going to involves a more 
mature crowd, you may want to dress a bit more conservatively. If you’re 
heading to a soiree with a crowd you know well and are comfortable with, 
Figure 11-2: Cocktail dresses aren’t 
required at cocktail parties.

196
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
your outfit can take a sexier turn! Remember, if someone is inviting you to a 
cocktail party, they want you to have fun. So have fun!
	
If you have a lot of cocktail parties or other events coming up and are on a 
tight budget, buy one classic dress in a neutral color. You can switch up the 
shoes, accessories, and clutch and create many different looks. Also, don’t 
forget the power of a shawl. A beautifully made, adorned wrap can take a 
dress from simple to sizzling in a flash! Figure 11-3 shows how a dress can take 
on a different look.

Attending a black-tie affair
So you’re heading to a black-tie affair. Should be fun, right? Is someone get­
ting married? Are you attending a bat or bar mitzvah? Is your loved one being 
honored for being fabulous? Whatever the occasion, I assume you know it’s 
black-tie, because, well, the invitation says so.
Men are lucky when the invite says “Black Tie” because they pretty much 
know what to wear: A tuxedo of some sort is the dress du jour. The only big 
choice a man has to make is what tie or cummerbund to wear! Women, on the 
other hand, face a multitude of choices. Do you wear a floor length, tea length 
(one that hits mid-calf; see Figure 11-4), or cocktail length dress (one that 
hits just below the knee). Do you choose a black dress or take a chance with 
a bright color? Do you wear your hair up or let your hair down (so to speak). 
Time of day, location, and the nature of the event are just a few of the factors 
you must take into account when deciding on the big pick.
Don’t stress out yet! Here’s the good news. When an invitation says “Black 
Tie,” the person or people throwing the party are pretty much telling you 
how they want you to look. They want you dressed to the nines! A long dress 
is the safe choice for an affair of this magnitude, but going shorter (as I men­
tioned) is no longer a faux pas. Similarly, wearing that fabulous long black 
number is totally appropriate, but it’s also acceptable to redefine, within 
boundaries, what black tie looks like. While I’d advise against whipping out 
that sexy dress from New Year’s Eve, you can, for most black-tie occasions, 
choose a dress with color or adornments that highlight your personal style. 
Next time you’re perusing the racks for that perfect dress, keep these ideas in 
mind because you are allowed to have fun when dressing up — I promise!
Here are some pointers for choosing an outfit for a black-tie affair:
	
✓	Know your audience. If the person or people hosting the event are more 
conservative, follow suit. You can never go wrong with a simple, floor 
length dress when attending a black-tie affair.
	
	Black-tie attire can range from conservative to whimsical. For example, 
a couple I’m close with had a black-tie wedding on a Saturday night, and 
I debated what to wear to it. The couple is very edgy and far from con­
servative, so I knew I could play around with my black-tie look. I chose 
a cocktail length, midnight blue dress — did I mention my fab accesso­
ries? I loved it. It was perfect for that wedding.

Figure 11-4: Show your personal style when picking 
	
what to wear to a black-tie event.
	
✓	Pay attention to the event’s timing. A black-tie event on the weekend is 
often dressier than a black-tie event held during the week.
	
✓	Have fun! Make sure your personal style shows when you saunter into 
your event. Confidence is key!
	
If you plan to wear that long black dress you have already worn to an occasion 
with the same group of people, switch it up: Buy a big statement necklace or 
earrings to serve as the centerpiece of that look. If First Lady Michelle Obama 
can repeat an outfit, so can you!

White-tie affairs: The most formal of all
A white-tie affair is the most formal event you can attend. State dinners at 
the White House and similar high status locations distinguish themselves by 
being extra formal — that is, white tie. Most people never attend an event of 
this stature (I never have). But knowing what’s expected is important, just in 
case your invitation comes in the mail!
White-tie events are more formal than black-tie events, and a long gown is 
always a must (see Figure 11-5). As I said, many white-tie events are state 
dinners, when the head of state of one country visits another. But other occa­
sions may also call for white-tie dress, such as fancy balls or cotillions. And 
of course, any group that wants to be very formal can host a white-tie event 
(although this is very rare).
Because of the formal nature of these events, there are certain expectations 
regarding attire. The dress for a white-tie evening is not only an evening 
gown, but a rather modest one. Bare shoulders are generally not acceptable, 
and women often wear opera length gloves (reaching up the arm just past the 
elbow, usually made of satin). Silk or satin shawls are usually worn as well. 
One exception: A woman from a foreign country attending a state dinner may 
wear the dressiest clothing representative of her country, such as a sari for a 
woman from India.
If you find yourself with an invitation to a white-tie affair, bring me as a date! 
Seriously, if you’re heading to this type of affair, there is no room for error. 
Rules must be followed.
Tuxes for women
Yves Saint Laurent was the first to show women 
in tuxedos. The year was 1962, and since then, 
many designers have shown women in either 
full tuxes or outfits with a tuxedo motif. But it’s 
definitely a daring selection for most occasions. 
My advice? Unless you know your audience is 
one that is on the edgier side, and you feel totally 
comfortable in one, stay away from the female 
version of tuxes! True, megastar Rihanna did 
get a lot of play for wearing a black Dolce & 
Gabbana suit to the Met Costume Institute Gala 
in 2009, but, hey, she’s Rihanna!

strict dress code.
Dressing for the Holidays
There are two schools when it comes to dressing for the holidays. Some 
people like to wear items to commemorate the season: Santa Claus sweaters, 
socks with dreidels, and other items with a seasonal feel. Now I don’t want 
to sound like the Grinch, but if you’re going this route, I suggest you do it 
minimally (especially if you’re leaving the house). The only way to pull off 
this look in style is to pick one gimmicky item and make it the focal point of 
your outfit. Everything else you wear should be a solid color and nothing else 
should have details.

201
 Chapter 11: Très Chic: Threads for Special Occasions
Another way to commemorate the holidays is to go in a subtle direction. You 
can wear seasonal colors and materials that give off a holiday vibe. This section 
shows you how to be the life of the party without looking like the centerpiece!
Wearing holiday colors
A great way to celebrate the holidays is to wear the 
season’s colors. You can still look the part without 
shouting out the particular holiday you’re enjoying 
by doing the following:
	
✓	Mix holiday colors with neutral ones. Pick 
one color (red or green for Christmas or, if 
you celebrate Chanukah, blue or silver) and 
pair that color with a complementary one. For 
Thanksgiving, maybe try a top in the pumpkin 
or cranberry family. No matter your faith or the 
type of holiday you’re celebrating, the goal is 
the same: Stay festive while remaining stylish.
	
	If you don’t look good in the colors of the 
season, don’t wear them. Stay true to your 
style, your color scheme, and your body type.
	
✓	Try accessories. An alternative to wearing a 
color representative of a particular holiday is 
to pick an accessory that gives you the same 
feel. Chandelier earrings that sparkle will put 
you right in the mix with other partygoers. 
For more on accessories, head to the section 
“Accessorizing holiday-style.”
	
You can get a dressier holiday look by wearing a 
sweater or dress with sequins, beading, or paillettes, 
which give you the sparkle and the festive feel with­
out the gimmick (see Figure 11-6). These choices are 
sophisticated and appropriate for everything from a 
holiday dinner to the office holiday party.
Holiday dress styles
What dress styles are acceptable for the holidays? Good question! As always, 
your LBD is acceptable, as is your favorite cocktail dress. But you have other 
alternatives to play around with, too.
Figure 11-6: Sequins can 
give you holiday style 
­without the gimmick.

Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
If you love your shoulders, try an asymmetrical or strapless dress. If you love 
your legs, try a shorter dress with a higher neckline. If you want to show a 
little cleavage (and I stress a little), try something with a plunging neckline. 
Whatever your preference, just pick a dress that’s made with a winter-like 
material and in a color that’s seasonally appropriate. Now of course “winter-
like” material is different depending on what part of the country you’re in. If 
you live in New York, go with velvet or satin. If you’re spending winter galli­
vanting in Miami (lucky you!), you can wear a silk-satin or chiffon number.
FFP
	
If you choose to go the short route, make sure you don’t push the envelope. If 
you have any doubt that your dress is too short, it is. Always err on the longer 
side. Sexy is really sexy when only one part of your body is on display. If you’re 
showing a little cleavage, don’t wear a short dress. If you’re wearing a short 
dress, don’t wear something low cut. You never want to be the girl in the reveal­
ing dress that everyone is talking about for all the wrong reasons.
Choosing materials that give 
a holiday vibe
Delving a little deeper into materials appropriate for the holidays, certain 
fabrics make you think “party” as soon as you see them. For example, a blazer 
with satin lapels is understated yet celebratory because of the extra shine 
provided by the satin. Velvet and cashmere give you that same holiday feel 
because they provide an added sense of luxury. I go skiing for the holidays. 
After a day on the slopes, my favorite thing to do is lounge around in my cash­
mere sweater and pants (which I invested in eight years ago and still have) 
and drink hot chocolate. Cozy, right? What’s great about wearing materials 
that are holiday-like is that you probably have many items sitting in the back 
of your closet that, when paired with the right things, will work perfectly.
	
During the holidays, you can wear an outfit that’s a little more dramatic. For 
example, a black velvet pant suit may be too much to wear to just any old 
event in the winter, but at a holiday party, the same pant suit paired with a 
simple tank and fun jewelry makes you queen of the night. Any other night 
you’d put the blazer with jeans or the pants with a blouse. Bottom line: It’s all 
about how you put your outfit together.
Patent leather is another holiday staple (in fact, the material is so versatile 
it should be in your closet year round). Patent leather shoes, handbags, and 
belts are all items that make an outfit pop. The trick is to pick one piece to 
add to what you’re already wearing. For example, if you plan to wear a velvet 
blazer with jeans, grab a white button-down shirt, silver chandelier earrings, 
and a pair of black patent pumps, and you’re instantly holiday chic (see 
Figure 11-7).

Patent leather shows scuff marks more readily than 
other materials, so avoid the lighter colors where 
scuffs are more obvious. Bad shiny shoes can ruin 
even the most stylish outfit.
Accessorizing holiday style
A way to look chic without wearing holiday-obvious 
clothing is to shimmer with metallic accents. A great 
way to do this is with silver and gold jewelry. The 
good thing is you likely already have pieces that you 
can combine to make a holiday statement. Here’s 
some advice based on questions I get all the time:
	
✓	“Does brown (or black or any other particu­
lar color) go with gold or silver earrings?” 
Here’s the deal: Any solid color can go with 
yellow gold, silver, white gold, or platinum. 
You run into a problem when you get into 
a top or a dress that already has embellish­
ments. Almost 100 percent of the time (and I 
say “almost” because there are always excep­
tions in life), you should wear an accessory 
that matches what is highlighted in the dress. 
If your dress has gold paillettes around the 
neckline, a simple gold hoop works best.
	
✓	“Is it okay to mix metals?” The answer is 
yes, yes, yes! Don’t be afraid to mix your gold 
and silver necklaces. Different length chains 
(and even ones with charms or lockets), when 
mixed correctly, can be chic and festive. 
Experiment with what you have. You’ll be sur­
prised how you can reinvent jewelry you’ve 
had for years.
Jewelry is not the only way to accessorize for the holidays. A shawl with 
metallic accents is very chic. So are metallic colored shoes and handbags. 
Again, the key is to not overdo it. If you’re wearing all black, try pairing gold 
sandals and a gold clutch with your outfit. (Metallics are considered neutral, 
so use them instead of basic black to spruce up your wardrobe.) I’m also a 
huge fan of small hair accessories! (Did I say “small” in a strong enough way?) 
I often wear low buns with a very small studded bobby pin on the side. You 
almost don’t see the bobby pin, but when you do, it becomes a conversation 
piece. Another trick is to take a festive brooch you’ve had forever and pin it 
to a clutch. I also do this with jean jackets (on the pocket). 
Figure 11-7: A sophisticated, 
festive look.

Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
The holidays are a time that you should really have fun with what you wear. 
Don’t forget you can make a statement with any article of clothing you put on 
your body. If you’re set on wearing that little black dress, how about pairing 
a great pair of heels with it? Nothing says “Happy Holidays!” like a great pair 
of red stilettos! Have fun, don’t be too theme-y, and be sexy! No matter your 
age, when you feel great, you’ll enjoy yourself more — trust me!
What to Wear to a Wedding
Chances are you’ve opened a wedding invitation, seen the requested attire, 
and said to yourself, “I have nothing to wear to this!” Well, you’re not alone. 
Nowadays, with all the different types of weddings, who can keep up? When 
it comes to a wedding, many variables affect what you should and shouldn’t 
wear. The following sections go into more detail, but it all boils down to these 
two key factors:
	
✓	The couple whose wedding you’re attending: Take into account the 
bride and groom’s personality and adopt their vibe into your personal 
style. If the bride wants you to look “hot” because she has a great friend 
she wants to fix you up with, then opt for a sexier dress. If the couple is 
more conservative, better to err on that side and go with a more con­
servative dress. If the couple is more relaxed, you can get away with 
having some fun with your look. Bottom line: Respect the couple hosting 
the affair and choose something that expresses your style while staying 
within the boundaries of what’s appropriate.
Open-toe shoes in winter — yes or no?
It’s perfectly fine to have your feet exposed 
during the winter. Here’s a little guidance to 
help you determine if open-toe is the way to go:
	✓	Let common sense be your guide. If you 
think you’ll be outside for an extended 
period of time, go with a shoe that keeps 
you warmer. But if you’re out in the ele­
ments only long enough to get in and out of 
the car, you can wear a sandal during the 
holidays whatever the climate.
	✓	When you wear open-toe sandals in the 
winter, stick with darker colors that have 
more of a wintery feel. Keep brights, pas­
tels, and light colored shoes packed up until 
spring and summer come around! Black, 
gold, and silver are acceptable year round.
	✓	If you wear an open-toe shoe or sandal, go 
sans stockings. For more on hosiery do’s 
and don’ts, head to Chapter 14. 

205
 Chapter 11: Très Chic: Threads for Special Occasions
	
✓	The location of the wedding: Consider the location and setting of the 
wedding. If you’re heading to an outdoor barbeque in the summer, you 
can never go wrong with a nice sundress and flat sandals. A formal wed­
ding in a cathedral requires something more formal.
The following sections go into more details.
Type of attire specified on the invitation
Many invitations specify a type of attire, but even when you open the enve­
lope and the invite spells it out for you, you’re still left wondering, “What am I 
going to wear?” The following helps you decipher what is what when it comes 
to wedding wear:
	
✓	Casual: An invitation that says “Casual” clearly indicates the couple is 
planning a more informal wedding and requests casual dress. An informal 
wedding can be anything from a barefoot beach wedding to a barbeque 
where flip-flops are the requested footwear. Because of the variation in 
what constitutes casual dress and what any particular couple envisions, 
figuring out what to wear can often get tricky. As I mentioned earlier, 
think about the couple whose wedding you’re attending and, if you need 
to, feel free to ask them what other people are wearing.
	
✓	Cocktail: If the wedding invitation says “Cocktail Attire,” a cocktail dress 
is most appropriate. I recommend staying away from wearing a floor 
length dress, which for the most part shouts black tie (if they wanted 
you that dressed up, they would have said so). See the earlier section 
“Dressing for a cocktail party” for advice on choosing an appropriate 
cocktail dress. And remember, cocktail attire generally means cocktails 
are in the mix, so get ready to have some fun!
	
✓	Black tie: If the invitation says “Black Tie,” you’ll see a lot of floor length 
dresses, but don’t be afraid to wear a cocktail dress if that is what looks 
best on you. You can be elegant and formal and totally appropriate 
without wearing a floor length gown. For almost every black-tie event, 
a dress that comes right below the knee is totally appropriate (for wed­
dings, I wouldn’t go too short — no more than an inch above the knee, 
tops). The earlier section “Attending a black-tie affair” offers more 
advice on black-tie attire.
Figure 11-8 shows types of attire for weddings: casual, cocktail, and black tie.

206
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
Figure 11-8: Different styles of wedding attire, from left: casual, cocktail, black tie.
	
If you’re at a loss, don’t be afraid to ask questions. E-mail or call the bride and 
ask what most people are wearing. If you don’t have that kind of relationship 
with the bride, ask a mutual friend who is attending as well. Between that, the 
invitation, and the advice in this section, you have all the info you need to pick 
the perfect dress!
	
I know I’ve said this before, but I’m saying it again: It’s always better to be 
slightly overdressed than underdressed — always.
Time of day
Knowing the time of the wedding is a huge factor in helping you decide what 
fabulous dress you’re going to choose. Fortunately, you only have to look at 
the invitation to get this info! The key thing to know is that nighttime wed­
dings are, for the most part, dressier than those held during the day. Here are 
the details:

207
 Chapter 11: Très Chic: Threads for Special Occasions
	
✓	Daytime weddings: Typically, daytime weddings are informal or semi­
formal. A shorter dress is fine, as is a suit. If you go with a suit, don’t 
wear one in a Wall Street pinstripe or anything that looks too corporate. 
Feel free to wear something in a lighter color. And if any part of the 
wedding is going to be on grass or sand, remember to leave the heels 
behind. If you want to wear two pieces, keep it on the dressier side, such 
as a satin A-line skirt paired with a dressy blouse. For the most part, you 
also want to stay away from black if you’re attending a daytime wedding. 
Weddings are fun and festive, and black, although dressy, tends to be 
more conservative and serious. So while you can get away with black at 
night (as long as you dress it up with fancy or statement jewelry), during 
the day it’s more appropriate to wear something happier.
FFP
	
	Don’t feel you can go ultra casual just because the wedding is during the 
day. You’re still going to a wedding. Whether it’s 11:00 a.m.or 11:00 p.m., 
it’s still the bride’s most important day, so dress up for it! When my 
friend Pam got married at 11:00 a.m. on a Sunday in Miami, I wore a long 
sundress and some people even wore cocktail length dresses.
	
	People always ask me whether it’s okay to wear sunglasses for a daytime 
wedding held outdoors. The answer is yes. You want to be able to see 
the ceremony without squinting!
	
✓	Evening weddings: Woo hoo! Dress up time! Evening weddings almost 
always have a dress code. “Cocktail Attire” or “Black Tie” will likely be 
nestled in the corner of your invitation. This type of affair calls for a cock­
tail or black-tie dress. For everything you need to know, see the earlier 
sections “Dressing for a cocktail party” or “Attending a black-tie affair.”
The setting
Where the wedding takes place certainly plays a part in what’s appropriate 
attire. Different venues call for different types of attire. A wedding that’s held 
in one of the top hotels in a big city is going to be more formal than a wedding 
held at a local restaurant in a small town. If you’re going to a country club 
wedding, expect people to be dressed up; if you’re off to a night club type of 
venue, the outfits will be edgier; and a beach wedding is more casual. Location 
is definitely one of the key ingredients when figuring out what to wear.
	
If you’re going to a wedding at a venue you’re familiar with, the dress is easier 
to predict. Never heard of the venue? Then let Google be your friend! Type the 
name of the venue into the search field to find out what the venue’s like.
	
If the ceremony is outdoors where you’ll be walking on grass, sand, or cobble­
stones, here’s a great invention to put on your heels to keep them protected: 
SoleMates (see Figure 11-9). These plastic heel covers are intended to keep 
your slim sticks from sinking into grass, grates, or other tough-to-manage sur­
faces. Check them out at www.thesolemates.com.

A wedding that takes place in a house of worship generally means that you 
need to dress in the manner appropriate to that location. If you’re unsure, 
the simplest solution is to ask the bride, or you can call ahead to the house of 
worship, though their guidelines may be stricter than the ones the bride will 
provide. In any case, you can rarely go wrong if you bring along some sort of 
wrap just for the service.
	
Have a great dress that’s perfect for the reception but not quite as conserva­
tive as you want it to be for the wedding ceremony itself? Pair it with a shawl. 
With a shawl, you can transition your dress seamlessly from sexy to conserva­
tive. A wrap can also be good to have on hand if the reception hall is very well 
air-conditioned or if the air temperature drops as you swing from late after­
noon to evening.
General rules for all weddings
While no two weddings are exactly alike, most weddings follow the same 
basic pattern. For example, usually a religious ceremony precedes the recep­
tion, and that means you have to take the rules for dressing in a house of 
worship into account as well as the party afterward. The following are some 
other basic guidelines:
	
✓	Don’t wear white. One wardrobe no-no when it comes to weddings is 
never wear white, ivory, cream, or any color in that family to a wedding, 
or even to a rehearsal dinner for that matter. White is normally reserved 
for the bride.
	
✓	Stay away from the color the bridesmaids are wearing. It’s a little awk­
ward if you’re the only non-bridesmaid in peach. You’ll look like a wed­
ding party wannabe.

209
 Chapter 11: Très Chic: Threads for Special Occasions
	
✓	It’s okay to break out the dressier accessories. Weddings are certainly 
the occasion to wear those special pieces that you normally don’t get 
the chance to wear. This goes for jewelry, a fancy clutch, or dressy 
heels. (But be careful not to over accessorize; see Chapter 14 for 
details.)
If you’re someone who buys something and then waits to wear it for that 
“special” occasion, listen up! I want you to feel special all the time. So in addi­
tion to wearing that jewelry to your next big occasion, try to incorporate 
some of it with a more casual outfit. Your good things should be worn, not 
stored!
Shopping for Evening Attire and Clothing 
for Other Special Events
Regardless of your budget, when shopping for clothing for special events, 
make your first stop a store that carries high-end designer gowns and 
dresses. Why? Because you’ll learn the current trends and see what’s hot at 
the moment. With this info in mind, you can then head to the stores that fit 
your budget and find dresses that are of a similar style to the more expensive 
ones. So once you get the lay of the land, begin searching more seriously 
elsewhere (unless you happen to find the perfect designer dress on sale — 
lucky you!).
How low can you go? The neckline dilemma
When it comes to plunging necklines, there’s 
always the question of how much is too much? 
To arrive at the right answer for a wedding, con­
sider the following:
	✓	How well-endowed you are. If you stick 
with the theory that less is more, bigger 
busted women may want to opt for a dress 
that is not low cut. A sweetheart neck (see 
Chapter 9) or strapless dress would be flat­
tering and appropriate choices. If you’re 
smaller around the bust area and want 
to wear a dress with a plunging neckline, 
you can. Just make sure that nothing that 
shouldn’t be exposed is exposed. (If neces­
sary take precautions like using double-sided 
tape.) As long as you can be comfortable and 
move around and not worry about falling out 
of your dress, you should be fine.
	✓	Whose party you’re attending. If the couple 
is more conservative, it’s more respectful 
and appropriate to dress on the more con­
servative side. As much as you’d like to be 
noticed for your taste and style, you don’t 
want to stick out like a sore thumb.

210
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
Next, look for a style that is most flattering for your body. For example, in 
2009 asymmetrical necklines were all the rage at the awards shows, but if you 
don’t have fabulous arms, this isn’t a trend you should adopt. Instead, pick 
the body part you like most and accentuate it. If you love your bust line but 
hate your hips, a plunging neckline is the answer. If you carry most of your 
weight in the lower half of your body, try picking a dress that has patterns or 
embellishments on the upper half of it.
	
Whether you’re a size 8 or a size 18, I want you to feel fabulous! That means 
highlighting the parts of your body you’re confident about and choosing cloth­
ing that helps camouflage what you consider your flaws. Here are some spe­
cific pointers:
	
✓	Don’t shy away from color; just wear it the right way. As a general rule, 
darker colors are more slimming. But don’t feel like you have to buy 
black every time you go shopping. If you carry most of your weight in 
the lower part of your body, for example, choose a dress with a plunging 
neckline or a top that is detailed or ornate. This way you draw the atten­
tion to the upper half of your body.
	
✓	Find a feature you like that you can focus on. This is all about being 
real and honest with yourself (not to mention giving yourself a break). 
If you look in the mirror and say, “I hate my stomach, thighs, tush, and 
arms,” you’re going to have a hard time finding a dress. But if you look 
and say, “My arms are good, but I don’t love the way my hips look,” you 
have enough to work with to find the perfect outfit. In this case, buy a 
sleeveless A-line dress, which will show off your arms and camouflage 
your hips.
	
✓	Think about the material the dress is made of. Some gowns are made 
of heavier fabrics and others are made of very wispy ones. You have 
to know which type works best for your own shape. A more structured 
dress made of a heavier fabric gives you more support and camouflages 
more, whereas a flowing, wispy dress is more likely to be made of a 
thinner, possibly sheer material and more revealing. You can find more 
detailed information on how to accentuate your attributes, no matter 
what your body type, in Chapter 3.
	
When you try on dresses, make sure you look put together so that you can 
envision, at least to some degree, what you’re going to look like. If you plan to 
wear your hair a certain way, try to wear your hair in that ’do. No, you don’t 
need to go to the salon before you go shopping. Instead, fake it! Simple hair 
clips that pull your hair away from your face, for example, may give you a more 
formal look. Also don’t forget to wear shoes with about the same heel height 
as the shoes you’ll be wearing. Everything helps when making a significant 
purchase.

F
or those of you who live in a tropical climate, shopping for 
one season is hard enough. Imagine having to rotate 
your wardrobe for four seasons! Fortunately, you can 
stock your closet with items that transition you from 
season to season, which means you do not need four 
different wardrobes to get you through the year. The 
trick is choosing wisely and buying right.
Winter: Staying Warm and 
Stylish
Nothing is quite like cozying up in front of a fire with 
someone you love, right? Well, that is the picture-perfect 
view on winter. But if you’re someone who views the colder 
months with a frown because of the bulky clothing you have to wear, 
this section is for you.

212
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
Layering for winter
If there’s one distinguishing characteristic of the clothes worn in winter, it’s 
weight. Heavier fabrics like woolen tweeds and corduroy help you retain 
body heat and stay warm. If not worn correctly, however, they can also make 
you appear heavier. That’s where the art of layering can come to the rescue. 
The trick is to layer your outfit in a way that enables you to remove a layer or 
two when indoors and still have something fabulous underneath.
	
Just because you need the added warmth, 
don’t assume you can’t wear your lighter-
weight clothes in winter. You may be sur­
prised how smart layering lets you stay warm 
without looking bulky:
	
✓	Layering tops: A natural tendency when 
layering is to add layers on top, like put­
ting a heavy sweater over a blouse. But 
if the look you’re going for is the blouse, 
not the sweater, layer a silk camisole 
beneath the blouse to get an added layer 
of warmth without the bulk. If you choose 
to wear a thin, fitted sweater (one that’s 
meant to be worn on its own and not over 
a shirt), try a long-sleeve silk undershirt. 
These undershirts don’t add bulk to your 
appearance, but they do help you retain 
body heat (see Figure 12-1).
	
✓	Layering bottoms: If you don’t want 
to wear thick wool slacks, wear a pair 
of tights under pants made of a thin­
ner material. You can even wear tights 
under your jeans. Just make sure the 
pants aren’t tight (otherwise, the extra 
layer underneath shows). Also, a pair of 
boots that go up to your knee gives you 
another layer of warmth on your legs.
Choosing coats and jackets
Outerwear is just as much of a fashion statement as the clothes you wear 
beneath them. In fact, in the colder months, it’s the first thing people see 
on you when you show up to work, dinner, or a party — so select a coat or 
jacket that really expresses your style.
Figure 12-1: A silk undershirt can 
keep you warm without adding 
bulk.

213
 Chapter 12: The Four Seasons: Dressing for Comfort and Style
	
One difference between a coat and a jacket is length. Coats are generally 
longer, giving you more coverage and protection from the cold, and jackets 
are shorter. Another difference between the two is weight. Coats tend to be 
heavy and too warm to wear inside. A jacket is an item that you may wear 
inside or out. In other words, a coat typically has one purpose: to keep you 
warm and protect you from the elements (keeping in mind that a great-looking 
coat makes a fashion statement, too). Jackets, on the other hand, are a bit 
more versatile. They’re perfect for warmer temperatures or transition 
weather, and you can use a jacket much the same way you would a cardigan 
or a wrap — to keep yourself warm in an air-conditioned office or restaurant 
without looking like you have one foot out the door.
Coats and jackets can be pricey, particularly the good-quality ones. They also 
take up a fair amount of closet space, so you want to be especially careful 
when buying one. The criteria for the perfect outerwear? Your piece needs to 
be stylish, fit you properly, and most of all, keep you warm. Most likely, you 
won’t have a different coat or jacket for every day of the week, so pick versa­
tile ones. As you shop for a coat or jacket (or evaluate the ones you already 
have), keep these things in mind:
	
✓	Choose a length that complements your body type. If you want to 
appear longer and thinner, a long coat is a great option. If you’re on the 
taller side, opt for a shorter one. When considering length, think about 
what’s most practical. If you’re always getting into and out of a car (as 
mothers of young children tend to do), the shorter one may be more 
practical and the longer one may be too cumbersome. Many lengths 
between the full-length coat and the short jacket are available, which 
means you absolutely can find one that suits your body type.
	
✓	Analyze your body before you make any big investment purchases 
such as a winter coat. Coats come in a variety of styles and lengths, 
ranging from fitted pea coats and belted trench coats (which are gen­
erally on the shorter side), to the less fitted A-line and unstructured 
poncho-style coats, to the full-length coat. If your hips are wide, you 
don’t want the coat to end in the middle of your hips, making the over­
all appearance even wider; choose a longer coat instead. If you’re on 
the thinner side, buy a fitted or belted coat, which allows you to show 
off your figure. And if you want to camouflage your bottom, get a wider 
body coat with some swing to it. An unstructured coat that drapes, 
rather than clings, camouflages any body part you’d prefer to keep 
under wraps. (For more on body shapes, see Chapter 3.)
	
✓	Keep your coats and jackets in the neutral color range. Because few 
women have the budget or closet space to have a different coat for 
every outfit, make sure the ones you do select match most of your 
­wardrobe.
The following sections describe the different kinds of coats and jackets you 
can choose from.

214
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
	
If you’re buying two pieces of outerwear, buy one down jacket to keep you 
warm and that you can wear when it snows or rains. Make the other one a pea 
coat or full-length coat that you can wear to work and out at night. A good 
place to find designer jackets for less is Burlington Coat Factory. I got a jacket 
last season for under $50, and it was a two-in-one. The sleeves zippered off 
and it became a cute vest!
Down outerwear: Dressing for warmth without looking bulky
Down outerwear is called a parka. Parkas come in short, sporty jacket lengths 
(see Figure 12-2) and in full-length coat style. They’re very warm and very 
light, and if they have a Gore-Tex or other microfi­
ber shell, they also protect you from the elements. 
Fortunately, you don’t have to look like a marshmallow-
man when you wear a parka. You can find chic ones 
that have minimum bulk. (I live in mine for work 
and play.) Although big, puffy down parkas are out 
there, you can also find very stylish and trendy 
brands (like Marmot, The North Face, and Bogner) 
that can keep you warm and looking fabulous. Here’s 
how to choose a down coat that looks good on your 
body type:
	
✓	Apples: If you’ve got an apple shape, choose 
a down coat that creates a waist. Look for one 
with a belt or an inner draw string (make sure 
that you pull it tight).
	
✓	Pears: If you’re pear-shaped, go with an A-line 
jacket, which emphasizes your top while maxi­
mizing coverage around your hips.
	
✓	Plus sizes: A three-quarter-length coat is the 
right choice because this length keeps the coat 
from being too short (which would probably cut 
you at the wrong spot) or too long (which would 
just be too bulky).
The underbelly of the camel: Camel hair coats
The camel hair coat is definitely a classic (see 
Figure 12-3). Warm and never out of style, these coats 
are worth the investment because they can take you 
from day to evening and are just as appropriate over 
jeans as they are over a fancy dress. Camel hair coats 
come in the traditional camel color, as well as a vari­
ety of neutral colors such as black, navy, and gray.

is perfect for après ski or 
après Starbucks!

 Chapter 12: The Four Seasons: Dressing for Comfort and Style
	
The original camel hair coats were worn by polo 
players and were actually made from the under­
belly hair of the Bactrian camel. Today’s “camel 
hair” is more likely to be a combination of wool 
and cashmere dyed to look like camel hair.
Camel hair coats come in different lengths; the 
longer the coat, the longer your profile. If you’re 
trying to appear taller or leaner, a longer coat 
may be a better investment. Also, for evening, 
longer coats are more elegant. Plus, if you wear 
a skirt or dress they extend past your hemline. 
However, if a shorter jacket looks better on you 
and still serves your wardrobe needs, invest in a 
shorter one. 
	
If camel hair coats have a drawback, it’s that they 
can easily get dirty, especially in slushy condi­
tions. To solve this problem, either buy one in a 
shorter length to avoid splash stains or choose 
one in a darker color.
Wool coats
Wool is a very popular fabric for winter coats 
because it’s a very good insulator. Wool coats 
come in a variety of lengths, from the shorter pea 
coat style to the full-length coat, and in the basic 
neutral colors as well as bright colors like red. 
The following are some suggestions that can help 
you find a wool coat that fits your body shape:
	
✓	If you have narrow shoulders: Pick a 
coat with wide lapels to accentuate your 
upper half while balancing out your lower 
half. Epaulets serve the same purpose and give your coat a little flair. 
Figure 12-4 shows how lapels and epaulets can provide balance.
	
✓	If you’ve got curves or a thin waistline: Pick a coat with a belt to 
emphasize your waist. 
	
✓	If you’re tall: Try a shorter coat to cut your long line and show off 
your legs.
	
✓	If you’re petite: Wear a fitted coat so you don’t look like your coat is 
overwhelming you. Keep it in close proportion to your size.
Figure 12-3: The camel hair 
coat fits in anywhere.

Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
	
✓	If you’re heavier on top: Choose a long coat to provide balance 
between the top and bottom halves of your body.
	
✓	If you’re a little wider in the midsection: A long coat gives you a longer, 
leaner line.
Figure 12-4: Wide lapels (left) or epaulets (right) provide balance for women 
with narrow shoulders.

 Chapter 12: The Four Seasons: Dressing for Comfort and Style
Pea coats
The pea coat remains a classic. Originally designed for sailors, it’s double-
breasted (the extra flap of cloth over the chest adds warmth), usually three-
quarter length (which allows sailors to swab the decks without problem), 
and has slash pockets. Traditionally made of wool, these coats also come in 
inexpensive versions made of synthetic fibers (but these aren’t very warm). 
These days, pea coats don’t have to be in the traditional Navy blue, yet they 
still look best in the basic neutral colors, such as camel or black.
The classic double-breasted pea coat doesn’t work well for women who don’t 
have a waist or who have a large bust. If you have a large bust and want to 
wear a pea coat, choose the single-breasted variety, which draws less atten­
tion to the bust area. Figure 12-5 shows both single- and double-breasted pea 
coats. (As this figure shows, not all pea coats have to be navy blue, either.)
FFP
	
A double-breasted pea coat doesn’t look good on anybody if it’s left hanging 
open and unbuttoned. If you’re going to wear a pea coat in situations where 
you won’t have it closed all the time, such as commuting or while at the mall, 
consider getting the single-breasted style.
Figure 12-5: Two pea coats, one single-breasted (left) and one double-breasted (right).

Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
Leather coats
If you take the hide of a cow or pig, without the short fur on these animals, 
you’re left with leather or suede. Although leather coats and jackets are 
usually considered more appropriate for the transitional seasons because 
they’re not very warm, they can be lined with fur, wool, or a synthetic liner, 
and then they can be used in winter. A leather coat can be a bomber jacket 
style (which is not very flattering or feminine and probably best avoided), or 
it can be a fitted blazer-type jacket (which can be very fashionable).
Fur coats
Fur coats remain a classic and elegant look. Designer fur coats can cost tens 
of thousands of dollars, and even the most modest run into the thousands. 
Fur is light and warm, but a lot of controversy surrounds wearing fur. Some 
groups, like members and supporters of PETA, the animal rights organiza­
tion, think killing animals to wear their fur is wrong. Designers who are sup­
portive of this stance have come out with fake fur options. Fake fur is a great 
way to keep up with the trends while being kind to animals.
Whether you’re choosing fake or real fur, keep these style elements in mind:
	
✓	Length: Just as with all coats, fur comes in a variety of lengths. Before 
you make the investment, decide what looks good on you and where 
you plan to wear the coat. For a more casual look, a short fur or faux fur 
jacket may be more appropriate. If you’re buying a jacket to wear out at 
night, a long coat may work better because it’s dressier.
	
	If you’re petite or on the smaller side, choose a coat that doesn’t look 
like it’s wearing you.
	
✓	Color: Real fur and faux fur come in a variety of colors. Choose one that 
best matches what’s in your wardrobe.
	
Sheepskin, in which the skin is used in addition to the wool, is another type 
of fur. Coats made of sheepskin are not as expensive as many other furs, but 
they are quite warm. And of course, fake fur is always a great option — to save 
money and the animals.
Adding a shot of color
Winter clothing and coats can be drab, and wearing dark colors all the time 
can definitely take a toll on your mood. I know, I know — the last thing you 
want to do is put on your favorite ivory slacks when it’s sleeting outside. 
Fortunately, you don’t have to risk ruining your prized pieces of clothing to 

219
 Chapter 12: The Four Seasons: Dressing for Comfort and Style
add some color to your winter wardrobe. If you’re wearing charcoal gray 
slacks, try pairing them with a sweater set in a bright color.
The same rules apply for coats. If you’re wearing a black coat, pair it with 
a colorful scarf, a great bag, a pair of boots, or even a great hat. Use acces­
sories to draw attention away from the coat itself and express your sense of 
style. However, if your coat, boots, and bag are all of impeccable taste and 
quality, a dark monochromatic look is very chic and elegant, not drab at all.
Summer: Looking Good When 
You’re Wearing Less
Ah, summer. Picture yourself sitting under a palm tree drinking a margarita 
getting fanned by a cute cabana boy. Okay, enough daydreaming! The truth 
is, many women don’t look forward to a season where they may have to wear 
lighter or less clothing. Never fear, you can dress for summer without feeling 
too exposed.
	
Fashion rules apply in summer just as they do in any other season: Find 
summer clothing that accentuates your attributes, while camouflaging any­
thing you don’t want to show. How much skin you show is completely your 
preference. If you prefer to keep covered, simply choose the right fabric and 
color.
Summer fabrics
Keeping cool in the summer doesn’t mean you have to wear less clothing. 
You just have to be smart about the fabrics you select. Natural fibers like 
cotton, rayon, and linen are better for hot weather than manmade fabrics like 
polyester because natural fibers allow your skin to breathe. Your skin — the 
human body’s largest organ — keeps you cool by sweating. As sweat on your 
skin evaporates, it removes heat. Clothes that promote the free flow of air 
allow sweat to evaporate more easily. Summer clothes should be not only 
lightweight and made of fabrics that breathe, but also loose so that the air 
can get under the material and aid in evaporation.
Some modern fabrics also add an element of protection from the damag­
ing rays of the sun. These fabrics, with brand names like Solarweave and 
Suntect, have actual SPF ratings, just like suntan lotion, and can help protect 

220
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
you against sunburn. Of course, they 
only protect the body parts they’re 
actually covering. They also make hats 
with these treated fabrics, some of 
which have a piece that hangs down to 
protect your neck. Note: Most derma­
tologists will tell you that wearing SPF-
rated fabrics shouldn’t stop you from 
wearing suntan lotion as well.
Cool colors for 
summer
In addition to the fabric fiber and 
weight, another factor to consider is 
the color. Darker colors absorb light 
and heat, while lighter colors reflect 
light and heat. That’s why people wear 
more white and other pale shades in 
the summer. 
One of the most popular pieces of 
summer apparel is a pair of white pants 
or jeans. You can wear white on the 
bottom and look and feel fabulous if 
you follow these pointers:
	
✓	Don’t throw out the fashion rules 
for your body type just because 
it’s hot out. Everyone should be 
able to pull off an outfit with white 
pants or jeans. If you’re apple-
shaped and love to wear white, 
pair some white linen slacks with a longer tunic-type blouse, which elon­
gates your upper body. And if you’re pear-shaped, belt your top to draw 
attention to your waist.
	
✓	White pants reveal everything (panty lines, the tucked in parts of 
your blouse, and more), so be careful! Make sure you look at yourself 
from every angle. If you look only at your front, you’ll miss the view that 
everybody else has as you walk away.
Figure 12-6: Loose clothing helps you 
keep cool.

221
 Chapter 12: The Four Seasons: Dressing for Comfort and Style
	
✓	If you wear less-expensive white pants, be careful of the pockets 
(both  front and back). If you can see them through the pants, they 
detract from the clean look you want (see Figure 12-7). A great idea is to 
have them removed altogether. You really aren’t going to use them to 
hold anything (that’s what your great purse is for), and the look will be 
much cleaner and more flattering. (Note: Having pockets in white jeans, 
however, is totally acceptable. Denim is a heavy fabric, and often the 
pockets are part of the design.)
Figure 12-7: Think about having any pockets removed from white pants.

222
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
When it comes to other white items like tops, skirts, and dresses, draw peo­
ple’s attention away from your problem areas by adding splashes of color. 
You can wear colorful scarves in a variety of different ways to spice up any 
outfit; you can even tie a brightly colored scarf around your waist or wrap 
your hair in one (head to Chapter 15 for different ways to swear scarves). In 
addition to color, black is a great accent with summer white. A black patent 
leather belt can brighten up a white outfit, and a bold black-and-white floral 
or geometric pattern on a dress or skirt serves to dazzle the eye and keep 
whatever’s underneath camouflaged. For further help, use the right undergar­
ments. Flesh-colored body shapers will hold you in and smooth you out, and 
won’t allow anything you don’t want seen to show through.
Summer styles
Sure, summer wear is more casual than that of other times of the year, but 
that can lead some people to forget all sense of fashion. You can still be very 
fashionable, even with the least amount of clothing. Even bathing suits, cov­
ered in the later section “By the sea,” can be fashionable. Just remember to 
keep in mind what works for your body type.
Who wears short shorts?
Shorts come in a variety of lengths. Find a pair that looks good on your body 
type.
	
✓	Short shorts: Very short shorts belong on young teens or women with 
really skinny legs. If you’re an apple shape and have great legs, short 
shorts can be a great way to draw attention to your assets. But if you 
don’t have very thin thighs, short shorts cut you at just the wrong place.
	
✓	Mid-thigh shorts: These shorts are less revealing and more appropriate 
for women who are no longer in their teens or twenties. 
	
✓	Bermuda shorts: These very fashionable shorts come to just above your 
knee and work on women of all ages.
If shorts are flattering to your legs, go for it. If not, try a skirt or dress. You’ll 
be just as cool, while remaining true to your look and sense of style.

223
 Chapter 12: The Four Seasons: Dressing for Comfort and Style
Skirts and dresses
Skirts and dresses are a great way to keep cool and fashionable in the warm 
weather. They feel lighter and cooler than pants and give you the opportunity 
to really express your personal style. So many options are available, from the 
structured pencil skirt to a flowy dress.
Wrap skirts and dresses, which are a classic look and never go out of style, 
can be very flattering because the diagonal line makes you appear taller and 
keeps the eye from focusing on any one part. 
Capris
Three-quarter length capri pants are another great option for summer. You 
can mix and match them with tops and shoes to your heart’s content. You can 
even make them part of a suit if you want. Again, just be careful about what 
is most flattering to your legs. If you want to make your legs appear longer, 
capris may not be right for you. For more on capris, head to Chapter 9.
Summer tops
T-shirts aren’t the only summer tops. You can find so many types of blouses 
in a wide variety of materials that are cool and great-looking, from peasant 
tops to silk blouses to longer tunic tops. Another popular look these days 
are babydoll tops with an empire waist. They’re very youthful-looking and go 
well with jeans. 
By the sea
Summertime is bathing suit season, which some women can’t wait for and 
others dread. Don’t dread it. The fact is that everyone has flaws. You just 
need to figure out a way to accentuate your attributes and camouflage what­
ever you don’t want exposed. Hiding flaws is obviously more of a challenge in 
a bathing suit, but it can be done.
One piece or two?
The first decision is whether to wear a one-piece or two-piece suit. What you 
choose depends on what you’re comfortable in and what body part you want 
to show off or hide. Get a one-piece suit if your belly is an area that you don’t 

224
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
feel comfortable revealing. Many one-piece suits 
come with tummy control. And ruching, shown in 
the suit in Figure 12-8, is one of the many tricks you 
can use to camouflage your body even while baring 
so much of it. If you like your back, then look for 
one that covers your front but is cut-out in the 
back. Go for a two-piece bikini if you have a great 
waist and want to accentuate it. If you like the ease 
of a two-piece, but still want to cover your tummy, 
try a tankini. The tankini is a two-piece that looks 
more like a pair of underwear and a camisole, so 
you get the coverage you want without having to 
be in a one-piece suit. 
When buying a two-piece suit, buy separates if you 
can. This way if you’re large on top and small on the 
bottom, you can get the appropriate size for each 
part and a better fit all around. This is true for all 
body types. If you can’t buy separates, try to get a 
top that adjusts in as many ways as possible so that 
you can make it work for you.

smaller-chested woman.

Look for bathing suits with built-in 
control panels that hold you in while 
you frolic in the pool or ocean. (www.
drreyshapewear.com)
Here are some tips to help you choose 
a suit style that fits your body type:
	
✓	Small-busted: The bandeau 
top or triangle top, shown in 
Figure 12-9, looks great on you 
(and many suits now come with 
padding if you want an extra 
boost!). Also, a cute suit with 
ruffles on top helps accentuate 
the chest area. Any detail on top 
helps give the illusion that you’re 
more curvaceous. These tops are 
available in either a one-piece 
or two-piece style, so you can 
choose which look you prefer.

225
 Chapter 12: The Four Seasons: Dressing for Comfort and Style
Figure 12-10: Small as they are, bikinis can 
still provide the support a fuller-breasted 
woman needs.
Figure 12-11: A high cut suit gives 
the illusion of longer legs.
	✓	Large-busted: If you have larger breasts and 
want to wear a two-piece suit, try ones that 
have more supportive straps. The bra-style 
bikini top is a very good choice for you (see 
Figure 12-10), as is the halter top suit. These 
both flatter and support you in the chest area. 
If you prefer to wear a one-piece suit, look for 
one with straps that provide the support you’re 
looking for.
	✓	Bottom-heavy: Play up your top in order to 
even out the proportions. Choose either a one- 
or two-piece suit with a top half that attracts 
all the attention. Separates, where the top 
has thicker straps or a colorful print and the 
bottom half is a dark solid 
that flatters and still 
matches the top, 
are always a good 
choice. Or try 
a color block 
one-piece with 
lighter colors 
on the top 
and darker 
ones on the 
bottom, as 
in Figure 12-12. Avoid boy short 
bottoms, which emphasize 
and attract attention to your 
derriere.
	
	Accentuating your cleavage is a 
good way to divert attention from 
other areas.
	
✓	Short legs: Choose a suit that’s cut 
high at the hip to make your legs 
look longer. A plunging neckline also 
creates a more vertical look (see 
Figure 12-11). Vertical stripes serve 
the same purpose.

226
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
	
✓	Long torso: Go for horizontal stripes. 
A two-piece suit breaks up your mid­
section. If you wear a one-piece, try 
one with cutouts, which break up 
your torso. And don’t be afraid to add 
splashes of color to keep eyes from 
looking at you in a straight up-and-
down manner (see Figure 12-12).
	
✓	Thick waist: If your hips and waist 
are about the same size, wear a two-
piece with bright colors so that there’s 
a clear definition between your two 
halves. Choose bottoms that sit low 
on your hips (these add a lengthen­
ing effect), and try to find a suit that 
has some bows or other adornment at 
the hips to differentiate your hips and 
waist. In a one-piece, look for a suit 
that has a sash in the middle or a hori­
zontal color block stripe to accentuate 
the waistline.
	
✓	Plus-sized: Dark colors are best. A 
streamlined one-piece in a dark color 
makes you look longer and leaner. Try 
an interesting neckline, maybe one 
that’s deeper rather than rounder, as 
it creates more of an illusion of length 
and draws attention to your chest area 
(which is most likely an attribute).
Cover-ups
If you want to be a little less exposed when 
you’re not in the water, another option 
for looking great while hanging out by the pool or at the beach is a cover-
up. These can range from sarongs to caftans, depending on the amount of 
coverage you desire. The great thing about a sarong is that you can use it in 
several ways, depending on which parts you want to cover (see Figure 12-13). 
Tie it above your chest, like a bath towel, and it covers you entirely without 
being too hot or looking out-of-place. If you just want to cover your lower 
half, tie it at your waist. Sarongs are so easy to put on and take off. You can 
even use it to lie on at the beach when you take it off!
Figure 12-12: By mixing colors, you 
can create an assortment of effects.

Spring and Fall: The Transition Seasons
For those of us who live in climates with four seasons, spring and fall are 
usually the favorites because they don’t offer any temperature extremes. 
What these transition seasons lack in extremes, though, they make up for in 
variability. No wonder there’s so much confusion about what to wear during 
these times. Really, the trick is just to layer so that no matter what the day 
brings, you’ll be dressed appropriately.

228
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
Slipping from season to season
One way of slipping from one season to the 
next is to make some subtle changes. When 
the weather starts to get a little warmer in 
spring, for example, ditch the boots and dark 
tights for jeans and peep-toe shoes. You may 
still need a coat to fight that nip in the morn­
ing air, but by late afternoon, you can slip 
off the coat and feel like you’re actually at 
the edge of summer. Other changes you can 
make are to go from heavy sweaters to lighter 
knit cardigans. Or put a camisole under a 
blouse, so if the day turns a lot warmer, you 
can just take the blouse off. In the fall, you 
transition your wardrobe the opposite way: 
Start with switching from open-toe to some­
thing like a ballet slipper before you dive into 
the boots. Add a jean jacket or a wrap over 
your top; during the warmer part of the day, 
just take it off.
Green leaves and spring flowers or fall foliage 
aren’t the only colorful additions to these 
seasons. As the next sections explain, your 
wardrobe should make the transition from 
winter to spring or summer to fall by using 
the appropriate colors as well.
In the spring
You may not be ready to give up black alto­
gether, nor do you have to, but you’ll feel a 
lot more spring-like if you begin to add some 
dashes of color, as shown in Figure 12-14, 
and even a few bold prints. Eventually you’ll 
be able to substitute lighter-weight coats for 
those that have to hold back those March 
winds. A spring coat in a lighter color is a 
good transition piece. It can still be neutral so that it matches most of your 
wardrobe, but you have a little more freedom from black, navy, and other 
dark colors. If you can afford more than one coat, try a fun spring color to 
start you on the way to lightening up your wardrobe. Scarves can also make 
a good bridge accessory. Put your wool scarves in the closet with mothballs 
and pull out the silk ones in a wide array of colors.
Figure 12-14: Add a touch of color 
to your spring wardrobe.

229
 Chapter 12: The Four Seasons: Dressing for Comfort and Style
In the fall
When the weather starts to turn cooler in 
the fall months, you can begin to add layers. 
Begin by slipping a cardigan over a summer 
dress, and then go to wearing long sleeves 
and lightweight wool under a jacket. Finally, 
resort to pulling out your gloves and hats.
Fall is a good time for vests, which allow you 
to slowly ease into the idea of requiring all 
that clothing to keep warm. It’s also a great 
time to break out those fabulous boots from 
last season that have been stored away all 
summer (see Figure 12-15). And, yes, the 
cooler temperatures mean it’s okay to start 
wearing black again.
Transitional outerwear
During the transitional seasons, you need 
outerwear that provides enough warmth to 
combat the low temperatures, but it also 
needs to be light enough that, when left 
open, it won’t make you sweat if the sun 
starts to warm up the atmosphere. And 
between April showers and the cold fall 
rains, you also want your outerwear to be 
waterproof.
Vests
For mid-range weather, vests are a great 
option (see Figure 12-16). They keep you 
warm, especially if they’re down (refer to the 
earlier section “Down outerwear: Dressing 
for warmth without looking bulky”) and still show off your arms, so you’re 
not too hot and you get to see a little of your body. They’re a little tougher 
for apple shapes because they accentuate your top half, so use your judg­
ment when trying them on and deciding whether or not they flatter your 
shape.
Figure 12-15: Ah, fall, when you can 
start wearing your favorite boots 
again.

Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
Shawls, wraps, and sweater coats
The most versatile item for transitional 
weather is the shawl or wrap. Sometimes, 
just adding that one layer warms you up 
enough when it’s chilly. Obviously, the 
cooler it is outside, the weightier your 
shawl or wrap should be, and vice-versa. 
You can also pair a shawl or wrap with 
other outerwear. If you’re wearing a light­
weight jacket designed for both indoor 
and outdoor wear, you can better fend off 
the cold by throwing a colorful wool or 
pashmina shawl over your shoulders. And 
voilà — you’re all set!
A sweater coat is a longer version of a 
sweater that doesn’t close in the front but 
hangs open like a cardigan without the 
buttons. Sweater coats, which come in 
lengths ranging from just below your rear 
to knee length, are knit and cling in all the 
right places. Most of them even have belts 
that you can tie. If you want to show your 
curves, a long knit sweater coat may be just 
what you need.
The trench coat: A transitional 
­superstar
If there’s one piece of outerwear that 
you’re going to wear the most, it’s a trench 
coat — particularly if it has a zip-out lining. 
Depending on where you live, a trench coat 
may even get you through an entire winter. 
Because you’ll wear your trench coat so 
often, it’s definitley worth spending a little extra if you find the perfect one. 
And because you’ll wear it in many different seasons, stick to the classic neu­
tral colors — those in the beige or gray family. Be careful if buying black; it 
can look heavy in spring.
	
Is it worth spending $800, $900, or even $1,000 on a Burberry designer trench 
coat? It all depends on your budget, of course, but you have to look at this as 
an investment in style and function. A trench coat is an item you can proudly 
wear for years and years, and the satisfaction it will give you every time you 
Figure 12-16: A vest is perfect for 
transition weather.

 Chapter 12: The Four Seasons: Dressing for Comfort and Style
slip it on will definitely make the price you paid five years before seem to be 
a bargain. Look for good quality brands that don’t force you to empty your 
wallet. Who says you have to buy yours at the most expensive retailers? 
Visit a place like Burlington Coat Factory or Loehmann’s for a great deal on a 
trench coat.
Slickers and jackets
Although you can still buy a yellow slicker based on the polyurethane 
raingear worn by fishermen and almost identical to the one you wore as a 
child, today you can also find slickers that are much thinner, though just as 
waterproof, and that don’t come down to your knees. These shorter, more 
fashionable lengths, when paired with the colorful rubber boots, such as 
the popular classic brand Hunter (www.Hunter-Boot.com), help you look 
stylish and remain dry.
Jackets made from fiber instead of polyurethane are not as waterproof, 
unless they have a Gore-Tex lining. But if you’re not backpacking and you’re 
packing an umbrella, it really doesn’t matter if your jacket isn’t entirely 
waterproof. In fact, if you don’t expect the temperatures to drop too much, 
you could just put on a simple blazer. On the other hand, if you’re going to be 
outdoors for an extended time (maybe you’re watching your kids play soccer 
through an October drizzle), having outerwear that has a microfiber lining 
like Gore-Tex is your best bet at staying dry.
Should your slicker or jacket be long or short? That depends on your body 
type. If you prefer to keep your bottom and hips from showing, then long is 
better, and an A-line or swing coat serves your needs best. If you don’t mind 
showing off your derriere, then go with a short jacket. (And a reminder to all 
you pears: Make sure it doesn’t end at your hips.)
	
When purchasing a jacket, especially for cooler temperatures, be sure to pay 
attention to its design elements, which also serve a purpose. Although you 
may not care that much about the pockets on a jacket that you only wear 
indoors, that’s probably not true for one that you plan to wear outdoors. 
If you want to be able to stick your hands in the pockets if a sudden chill 
descends, make sure the pockets allow you to. You may also want to have the 
option to turn up the collar for added protection from the wind, so look for 
one with a collar as opposed to one without.
Can you wear a spring jacket in the fall and vice versa? Obviously there’s 
nothing stopping you, but each of these seasons announces the coming one, 
which is why a spring jacket would normally be in a lighter, brighter color 
while a fall jacket, like one in black or brown leather, is more appropriate for 

232
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
the fall months. Of course, if the jacket is in a neutral beige or gray, or mid-
range blue or red, it can definitely be worn in both spring and fall. A denim 
jacket is a great spring-to-summer and fall-to-winter option (see Figure 12-17).

hether you’re sleeping alone or with someone special, 
you always want to look, and more importantly, 
feel confident and beautiful. So this chapter pertains to 
everyone — single, married, dating, or divorced, what­
ever your status on Facebook says! (For the record, 
I’m single. Know anyone?) You’re probably rolling 
your eyes and saying to yourself, “She really wants 
me to dress up when I go to bed?” No, I don’t 
want you to dress up like you’re going to a black-
tie affair, but I do want you to feel fabulous and 
comfortable at all times. It all goes back to my 10 
System (refer to Chapter 2).
Let me explain: I have a great T-shirt that I got as a 
freshman at the University of Michigan. It’s 100 percent 
cotton and, because I’ve worn it over and over again, 
feels perfect every time I put it on. My goal in this chapter 
is to help you keep only the sleepwear that is 100 percent 

234
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
something — 100 percent comfortable, 100 percent sexy, or 100 percent spe­
cial. So ditch those ratty T-shirts that aren’t your favorites and do away with 
lingerie that no longer makes you feel great. Everything you own, including 
your PJs, needs to have a reason to be in your closet.
Sleepwear 101
Obviously you should be comfortable when you go to bed, and sleepwear 
manufacturers (successful ones at least!) are well aware of how important 
that is. But there are different levels of comfort: cozy-comfortable, cute-
comfortable, and sexy-comfortable. You just have to choose one and go with 
it. Your final outfit of the day should be as put together as you want to feel 
when you get up the next morning.
	
Just as you may wear a skirt one day and a pair of pants the next, you can 
alternate between nightgowns and pajamas and maybe even nothing at all! 
There’s nothing wrong with switching it up according to your mood or the 
season, and the best thing about sleepwear is that you get to experiment in 
the comfort of your own home.
Pajamas
The word pajamas comes from pyjamas, traditional loose pants held up by 
a string tied around the waist worn in Southeast Asia. The colonial Brits, who 
paraded around in the blistering sun all dressed up in uniforms or ties and 
jackets, eventually understood the advantage of the native dress and brought 
this style back to England toward the end of the 18th century. They added a 
jacket and found it to be a comfortable sleeping outfit and a nice replacement 
for drafty nightgowns during their long, cold winters. 
Although the basic design of pajamas is pretty set, that doesn’t mean you 
can’t make a fashion statement in them. Ever since women adopted this 
particular style, pajamas have come in a greater selection of fabrics, from 
cotton to flannel to satin and silk. You can even find some made out of 
eco-friendly bamboo. As to styles, you can choose from a large variety. 
In winter, you may want to get as much coverage as possible (and throw 

235
 Chapter 13: Dressing for the Bedroom
on a pair of socks to boot). As the 
weather heats up, you may prefer 
shorter sleeves and legs. With all the 
variety available, your PJ pants can 
go from full-length to capri-length to 
shorts, and your tops can shrink from 
full sleeves to short sleeves to no 
sleeves.
If PJs are your sleepwear of choice, 
keep these suggestions in mind:
	
✓	Stick to natural fibers. Synthetic 
fibers like nylon or spandex may 
keep you too warm or may be too 
constricting.
	
	Although it’s a natural fiber, I don’t 
recommend wool. Although very 
warm, it can also be scratchy — 
not so much fun in bed! If you’re 
especially cold, better to add 
another layer of cotton (in the 
form of thermal underwear, 
for example) rather than switch 
to wool PJs.
	
✓	If you sleep on your stomach, 
look for PJ tops that pull over 
your head. Traditional pajama 
tops generally button down the 
front, which can be uncomfortable 
for tummy-sleepers (like me). 
If you fall into this category, 
try a pajama top that pulls 
over your head, such as one 
in the T-shirt or cami style (see 
Figure 13-1).
	
	Why not just sleep in any old T-shirt and sweats and avoid the whole 
button-down-the-front dilemma? Because PJs, which are usually a 
matching set, help you look pulled together. It all goes back to feeling 
put together and fabulous, even when you’re just heading off to 
dreamland.
Figure 13-1: PJs can keep you cute 
and cozy.

236
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
	
✓	Limit the number of gimmicky 
pajamas you have. Pajamas run 
the gamut from conservative solids 
(see Figure 13-2) to the most ridicu­
lous prints. Seriously, you can find 
everything from animal prints to 
crossword puzzles. These tend to 
be a very popular gift, especially 
around the holidays (if your friend 
likes golf, pajamas with golf balls 
is a no-brainer). Although it’s okay 
to have a couple pairs of gimmicky 
pajamas, you don’t want to look like 
you belong on the lunch box of a first 
grader all the time.
	
✓	Look for pajamas that suit your 
style. PJs can be sexy or conserva­
tive, less material or more, sheer or 
opaque, camisole or long sleeves. 
Make sure you select only those that 
fit you perfectly and are in a style 
that represents you. Material is also 
key — choose a fabric that makes 
you feel comfortable and cozy. 
Suffering through a formal affair 
in high heels is one thing; the last 
thing you want is to be uncomfort­
able in bed.
	
✓	Choose PJs that work best for your 
body type and accentuate what you 
want to show off. If you have long 
legs, for example, try a set with shorts. 
If you’re on the short side, a design 
with a vertical stripe elongates your 
appearance. And if you prefer to keep 
your partner’s eyes away from your 
bottom, keep the top button or two of 
your top undone. (Woo hoo!)
Nightgowns: Naughty or nice
Before there were pajamas, everyone, both male and female, wore night­
gowns to bed. The preference for nightgowns had to do with comfort: They 
Figure 13-2: A basic pajama set is a 
perfect look for bedtime.

237
 Chapter 13: Dressing for the Bedroom
didn’t constrict you while you slept, and they allowed couples to be intimate 
without having to take all their clothes off on a chilly night. Today, night­
gowns are still very popular among some women.
	
If you’re really concerned with camouflaging 
some body parts, even in the bedroom, a night­
gown is your best bet. The flowing style of a 
nightgown covers up pretty much everything 
because it doesn’t cling to the tummy or hips 
or behind. (Nightgowns can be found in plus 
sizes, so don’t allow anyone to tell you that 
these outfits aren’t for you if you’re above a 
certain size.) You can shop for all this sleepwear 
online, a great solution if you’re too shy or 
uncomfortable shopping for this kind of clothing 
in public!
Because nightgown styles vary from conserva­
tive (those that totally cover you up) to super 
sexy (and revealing), you can definitely find a 
gown that fits your comfort level and sense of 
style.
	
✓	The traditional nightgown: Traditionally, 
nightgowns served two purposes: cover­
ing up in the interests of modesty and 
keeping warm. If that’s what you want in 
a nightgown, flannel is a good choice. It 
retains heat, is comfortable, and because 
it’s opaque, is totally concealing. If, on the 
other hand, you want your nightgown to 
silhouette what’s underneath, silk would be 
your first choice (see Figure 13-3).
	
✓	Negligees: Negligees are nightgowns 
designed to be seductive. These usually 
have more frills (lace and bows, for exam­
ple) than traditional nightgowns and are 
made of sheer or semi-transparent mate­
rial. They also generally reveal more skin. 
Although you may want to wear a negligee 
for your husband’s or boyfriend’s benefit, you need something to cover 
it up outside the bedroom, especially if other family members are in the 
house! Luckily, most negligees are sold in sets with a matching peignoir 
(see Figure 13-4). For all intents and purposes, a peignoir is a robe, only 
much sexier and fancier.
Figure 13-3: Even though 
you’re fully covered, a silk 
nightgown is still sexy.

238
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
	
	Traditionally, a peignoir was the garment 
a noble woman wore as her personal maid 
combed her hair (the word peignoir, in 
fact, is from the French word peigner, 
which means “to comb hair”).
	
✓	The babydoll: As women became less 
modest in their outerwear, the trend fol­
lowed suit in the bedroom, and along came 
the babydoll. The babydoll is a negligee, 
except it’s much shorter in length and is 
generally sold with matching panties (see 
Figure 13-5). To raise the bar on the sexi­
ness factor, you can wear a babydoll with 
a thong or a G-string. Figure out which 
bottom is most flattering for your backside 
and go for it!
Figure 13-4: Most negligees 
come with a special robe, 
called a peignoir.
Figure 13-5: A sheer babydoll is very sexy.
Color is another factor in the level of sensuality in 
a nightgown. A white negligee conveys a mixture 
of innocence and seduction. A negligee in black or 
red conveys out-and-out seduction, no matter how 
many little bows it may have! And if you really want 
to turn it up a notch, try a negligee in some type of 
animal print or one that is totally sheer.

 Chapter 13: Dressing for the Bedroom
Teddies and other things
In the 1920s, the original name for a teddy was 
camiknickers, because it was a combination of 
a camisole top and knickers bottoms. It was 
intended to be worn under shorter skirts. Because 
the shape reminds one of a teddy bear, the nick­
name “teddy” eventually stuck.
Women wearing pants in the factories during 
World War II adopted the teddies to wear under 
their work clothes. Although some teddies are still 
sold because of their utilitarian value as a one-
piece undergarment, most are made to be highly 
suggestive. They don’t leave much to the imagina­
tion because they’re see-through and have open­
ings pretty much everywhere. So, ladies, if you’re 
looking for another option when you want to look 
seductive in the bedroom, look no further.
	
It’s a good idea to have some type of sexy sleep­
wear in your repertoire. You may not wear it every 
night, but you want to be able to express your dif­
ferent moods with your clothing. Figure out which 
style, color, and material best suits you and go for 
it! You’ll be amazed at how sexy sleepwear makes 
you feel, not to mention how happy it will make 
your partner! 
I once dated a man who told me that the sexiest 
thing I ever wore for him was his white button-down 
shirt. You can make your partner’s clothing work for 
you, too (see Figure 13-6). Be creative. A woman can 
be sexy in many different ways; all I needed to do 
was go shopping in my boyfriend’s closet!
Robes
A robe is generally used to add a layer of warmth to whatever you’re wearing 
underneath, if anything. Robes designed to keep you warm come in all types 
of fabrics, and with heating bills going up, there will surely be more and more 
people putting on their robes right after they lower their thermostats. Today 
you can buy robes in fleece or microfiber, and they do an excellent job of 
retaining heat while not being too heavy. The following sections detail the dif­
ferent kinds of robes.
Figure 13-6: A simple button-down 
shirt (from his closet) can be as 
sexy as lingerie.

240
Part IV: Dressing for Any Occasion 
Bath robes
Bath robes are usually made of terry cloth or are at 
least lined with terry cloth so that when you step 
out of the shower or bath, you can quickly wrap 
yourself up against any lurking drafts (see Figure 
13-7). You can then step out of the bathroom and 
head for your bedroom to get dressed knowing that 
you’re amply covered.
	
If you prefer robes to sweaters when lounging or 
working at home, give some thought to how you 
look. Make sure you choose a robe that flatters your 
shape. Because robes add an extra thick layer, they 
can leave you looking very bulky, especially terry 
cloth robes. As an alternative to terry cloth, try a 
robe made of silk or cotton. If you have great legs, a 
shorter robe will flatter you. And keep in mind that 
darker colors are always more slimming.
Silk robes
A fine silk robe not only gives you a slimmer 
appearance, but the feel of silk is also very sensu­
ous. Silk also lends itself to many types of imprints 
(because silk originated in China, many silk robes 
have an eastern motif). Of course, you can get a 
solid color silk robe and just bask in the look and 
feel that simple silk offers. (By the way, woven silk 
is softer than knit silk, and so better for a robe.)
	
To reduce the cost of using real silk, some manufac­
turers offer silk blends or use fabrics that have the 
appearance of silk but are made entirely of synthetic 
fibers (nylon or rayon, for example). These synthetic 
silks don’t have the same luxurious feel of silk, nor 
do they hold up as well, but they’re still an option.
Kimonos
A kimono is a form of silk robe. Because silk was first woven into cloth in 
China, the most beautiful silk robes still come from the Far East. Kimonos, 
Figure 13-7: A terry cloth 
robe.

241
 Chapter 13: Dressing for the Bedroom
which have Chinese or Japanese 
designs (see Figure 13-8), are elegant 
and quite beautiful. The more elabo­
rate the design, the higher the price, 
of course. Traditionally, kimonos 
were one-size-fits-all garments and 
were cut on the small side; today, 
plus-size kimonos are readily avail­
able. When selecting a kimono, make 
sure that the decorative pattern 
matches your body type. If you have 
full hips, for example, make sure the 
design is mostly around your top, 
drawing the eye away from your 
hips.
Housecoats
An offshoot of the robe is the 
housecoat, which is basically a robe 
meant to be worn during the day, 
as opposed to the traditional robe 
which is associated with evening 
lounge wear. Housecoats are a cross 
between a dress and a robe. For that 
reason, the material generally has 
more of a pattern than does a robe. 
Although younger women usually 
put on their jeans or sweats to do 
household chores, older women 
sometimes put on a housecoat.
Housecoats are functional and allow 
for more freedom of movement than 
jeans do. As long as you don’t decide 
to live in a housecoat 24/7 or let anyone see you in it, they can be an appro­
priate mode of dress around the house. (They’re definitely not appropriate 
outside the house, even if you’re just running to the store or the salon.) 
Really consider how you look and feel before deciding to wear a housecoat. 
Don’t wear one if it makes you feel dumpy, no matter how practical it may be. 
Other options are available that will make you feel like a 10.

and comfortable.

Vintage sleepwear
Society today is a lot less formal than it used to 
be; so many people simply sleep in their under­
wear, sweats, or nothing at all. (However, I hope 
this chapter has inspired you to give a little more 
thought to your nighttime wardrobe than that!) 
Fifty years ago, however, the nighttime regime 
included slipping on a complete outfit designed 
for going to bed. Because the demand for sleep­
wear was so much greater back then, people 
had a lot more to choose from. So if you really 
want to get fancy, or you’re looking for sleep­
wear or loungewear that is special and unique, 
try shopping for something vintage.
You may not want to wear someone else’s old 
pair of flannel pajamas, no matter how many 
times it’s been washed. But when it comes to 
robes, silk pajamas, and negligee and peignoir 
sets, you can find fabulous, one-of-a-kind items 
that will bring the height of glamour to your eve­
nings at home. Even if you don’t want to wear 
them for sleeping, putting them on to lounge 
around the house can make those few hours 
between work and sleep extra special.
These items were usually well cared for, if even 
worn at all. If you shop carefully, you can find 
some in impeccable condition that will make 
you look sensational. A set that is really fancy 
and in perfect condition can set you back quite 
a bit (more than you’d normally spend on sleep­
wear), but if it’s really special and makes you 
look and feel great, it can be worth the price. 
Just remember to take good care of them in 
order to protect your investment!

ow many times have you seen a woman in a

out like that?!” Here’s the deal: You never want to 
be the girl in the great outfit with the wrong under­
garments. This chapter explains how to make your 
outfit look even better with only a few purchases 
and a few key tricks.
Hosiery
Women have a wide variety of choices when it comes to hosiery: stockings, 
pantyhose, tights, knee highs, or nothing at all. I don’t know how we got into 
such a complicated state of affairs, but I personally tend to opt for nothing at 
all (crazy, I know). I remember my grandmother would never leave the house, 

246
Part V: Finishing Touches 
let alone go to a formal affair, without the right hosiery. But what is consid­
ered appropriate and accepted has definitely changed throughout the years. 
Warmth, office decorum, and what flatters your body best are just a few of 
the issues to consider as I take you on a journey into the world of hosiery.
Different types of hosiery styles
Hosiery styles vary in color and transparency and come in various patterns. 
With all these varieties, be sure to select a style that fits your body type:
	
✓	If you want to appear taller or leaner, wear a darker color or one with a 
simple seam up the back of the leg.
	
✓	Lighter colors, especially ones with patterns, draw more attention to 
your legs and can make them look wider.
	
The right hose or some great tights can really make an outfit. But hosiery isn’t 
just a fashion statement; some women wear it to cover up parts of their legs 
they aren’t fans of, like veins, blemishes — you name it. (I have a friend, in 
fact, who doesn’t like her knees.) In addition, covering your legs is appropriate 
or required in certain situations, like at many offices or events. The following 
sections take a look at pantyhose and stockings (shown in Figure 14-1).
Figure 14-1: Pantyhose (left) and stockings (right).

247
 Chapter 14: It’s What’s Inside That Counts: Undergarments
Stockings
Stockings cover the foot and lower part of the 
leg and end mid-thigh. Formerly made of woven 
cloth, they can now be found in knitted wool, 
cotton, nylon, or silk.
Many women prefer stockings to pantyhose 
(covered in the next section) for these reasons:
	
✓	They’re not as restrictive. Stockings can 
be more comfortable than pantyhose or 
tights, especially in warm weather.
	
✓	They’re sexier. Stockings allow for some 
bare skin on the upper thigh that could 
inadvertently (or not) be exposed.
Use one of these methods to keep your stock­
ings up:
	
✓	A garter belt: A garter belt is a piece of 
lingerie that goes around the waist that 
has “suspenders” that clip to the top of 
the stockings (see Figure 14-2).
	
✓	An elastic garter: Have you ever been to a 
wedding and watched as the groom pulls 
a garter off his new wife’s leg and everyone 
laughs? Of course you have! Well, garters 
aren’t just wedding souvenirs. You can use 
them to actually hold stockings up. 
	
✓	“Stay Ups”: Here, the inside of the top of 
the stocking has an elastic band added 
to it that allows it to, well, stay up. (Duh, 
hence the name!)
Pantyhose
When women began to wear miniskirts in the 1960s, stockings, which up until 
then had been kept up with garters, proved to be too short. So one-piece 
pantyhose came to the fore (interestingly, dancers were the first to come 
up with the idea of sewing stockings to the leg bands of their briefs). Shortly 
thereafter, the majority of hosiery sales were in the form of pantyhose (see 
Figure 14-3). What do so many women like about pantyhose?
Figure 14-2: Stockings held up by 
a garter belt can be sexy.

✓	They don’t have to worry whether their stockings are sagging or 
attached.
	
✓	Pantyhose provide welcome extra warmth when it’s cold outside.
	
✓	Because pantyhose use a stretch material, they provide extra support, 
which has a slimming effect on the legs (and, if the pantyhose are con­
trol top, to the tummy as well).
Figure 14-3: Regular (left) and control top (right) pantyhose.
Hosiery rules
Manufacturers have come up with a wide variety of hosiery textures and 
designs, including fishnet, fencenet (which has a wider webbing), stripes, 
checks, and other woven designs. You can also find them with bows, lace 
panels, and in a rainbow of colors. They can be opaque, medium sheer, or 
completely sheer. Other advances include a seamless toe or sandal-foot that 
you can wear with sandals and other open-toe shoes.

249
 Chapter 14: It’s What’s Inside That Counts: Undergarments
The following list offers a bit of guidance to help you decide what style looks 
best on you and some pointers on how to wear them:
	
✓	Creating a slimming effect: To get a slimming effect, wear dark hose. An 
alternative is to wear medium sheer, which is more slimming than very 
sheer or opaque because it allows for some shading on the leg. Also, 
wear hose that echo the color of your outfit — a navy skirt or dress with 
navy hose and navy shoes, for example — to elongate the appearance of 
your body.
	
✓	Using hosiery as an accessory: Wearing a simple black dress with a pat­
terned pair of tights or stockings make your legs the centerpiece of your 
outfit.
	
✓	Getting a dressier look: Hosiery with a sheen is considered dressier and 
makes your outfit fancier. 
	
	Stocking thickness is measured in denier. The lower the denier number, 
the sheerer the garment. (Stockings knitted with a higher denier are less 
sheer but more durable.)
For comfort and style, be sure to keep these tips in mind:
	
✓	If you wear flesh-colored hosiery, make sure it matches the color of 
your flesh. Having legs a different color than your arms (either because 
they’re too dark or too light) looks funny.
	
✓	Knee highs, a variety of hosiery to be worn under pants, leave marks 
on your legs that show for some time. If you wear them during the day 
and intend to go barelegged at night, take them off well ahead of time.
	
✓	If you wear a garter belt to hold up your stockings, make sure the belt 
matches the color of the stockings. Also, adjust the straps so that the 
front straps are two inches shorter than the back ones. That way, they 
don’t show if your skirt gets hiked up, such as when you sit.
	
✓	You put the garter belt and stockings on first and your panties on last. 
Otherwise, you have to remove everything when you go to the bath­
room.
FFP
	
✓	Never wear hosiery with open-toe shoes or sandals (see Figure 14-4). 
Never. No exceptions. In fact, I’m getting anxious just thinking of that 
outfit!

Figure 14-4: Don’t wear hose with open-toe shoes!
	
How much should you spend on hosiery? You can get a good pair of brand-
name hose or stockings for $12 to $25, and they’ll last a while if cared for prop­
erly. Get the right size (hosiery that’s too tight wears out more quickly), and 
wash them before you put them on to help the material stretch a little (this 
also helps them fit better). Hand-washing is preferable, but if you must wash 
hosiery in a washing machine with other clothes, put them in a lingerie bag to 
protect them.

Bras
The bra has a history that stretches back several thousands of years. But 
it wasn’t until the early 20th century, when Warner, a huge bra manufactur­
ing company, began selling bras in various cup sizes that the “modern” bra 
was born. Since then, bra manufacturers have been using their creativity to 
design bras for almost every purpose and occasion. 
Types of bras
Women wear bras to prevent sagging, to provide shape for a particular look, 
and to add a layer of opacity to a sheer top. Today, more than 20 different 
types of bras are available — not to mention all the varieties of designs avail­
able for each type. Here is a brief description of the most common categories:
	
✓	Full-support bras: This type of bra fully envelops the breast (see 
Figure 14-5). The objective is to give the breast as much support and 
concealment as possible. Full support bras include minimizers (for large-
breasted women who want to appear smaller) and underwire bras (which 
have wire built into the cup to help support, lift, and shape the breasts).
Figure 14-5: The bigger your cup size, the more support you need.

252
Part V: Finishing Touches 
	
✓	Seamless bras: Designed more for sheer or fitted clothing (see
 Figure 14-6), seamless bras are perfect under a T-shirt because 
no lines show. These come with underwire and padding if you’re 
looking for a little boost, too!

✓	Strapless bras: Strapless bras, or bandeau bras, are designed to be 
worn with strapless tops or dresses, and tops that don’t fully cover the 
shoulders.
	
✓	Convertible bras: These bras have removable straps that you can 
wear in a variety of ways (see Figure 14-7): over the shoulder, criss­
crossed in the back, as a halter, as a T-back, or without the straps. 
The crisscross style is great for underneath a racerback tank or a 
sleeveless top.

new bra.
	
✓	Plunge bras: These are ideal when you wear low-cut garments but still 
have enough coverage to feel comfortable.

✓	Shelf bras: These bras support the breast but don’t cover it, giving the 
appearance that you’re not wearing a bra.
	
✓	Demi bras: These bras leave the top half of the breast exposed and are 
good when you wear a top with a deep neckline.
	
✓	Padded bras: Padded bras are designed to increase the appearance of 
the volume of the breast.
	
✓	Push-up bras: These bras create more cleavage by using padding or gel 
to push up the breast. One of the most well-known push-up bras is the 
Wonderbra.
	
✓	Adhesive bras: These are latex-free adhesives that you place on your 
nipples to hide them. They give no support at all. Wear them with back­
less dresses or when you want the braless look but want to maintain a 
hint of modesty.
	
	Many brands sell nipple concealers. Most are discarded after use (don’t 
worry; it doesn’t kill when you take them off!). I love Low Beams; they’re 
$10 at www.barenecessities.com.
	
✓	Specialty bras: This category includes a variety of bras such as
 
• Nursing bras: These open up to allow a nursing mother to feed her 
child without removing the bra.
 
• Longline bras: The base of these stretch down to your waist to 
hold in your tummy.
Each style of bra comes in an assortment of fabrics, colors, and designs. As 
long as the bra fits you properly (see the next section) and is flattering on 
you, feel free to play with different options.

255
 Chapter 14: It’s What’s Inside That Counts: Undergarments
	
Have a variety of designs so that you have something appropriate to wear 
underneath any top you put on. If you wear a light-colored or sheer top, for 
example, wear a nude or flesh-toned bra that won’t show through the fabric. If 
you wear a lot of black or heavier materials on top, you can play with darker-
colored bras or bras with designs or lace, because you won’t see those things 
through the shirt.
How many different types of bras you need depends on your lifestyle. If you 
have one type of bra that you like and wear every day, having a supply of 
those suffices. But if you attend events where you’re likely to wear a strap­
less gown or one with a plunging neckline, even if these events occur only 
once or twice a year, then you want to have some of those types of bras in 
your drawer. If you’re active and engage in various sports, you need some 
sports bras. Whether you ever stock up on sexy bras is a personal decision, 
but it’s a good idea, because even if you don’t dress overtly sexy, just know­
ing you’re wearing a sexy bra underneath can do wonders to your mood and 
your psyche, and give you that extra boost of confidence!
Getting fitted by a pro
Experts say that something like 8 out of 10 women aren’t wearing the right 
bra size. Let this section help you avoid being one of those unfortunate 
women.
Why is it so important for a bra to fit perfectly, you ask? Walk down the street 
and see all the women whose flesh bulges out of their bras in one place or 
another, and that’s one answer. Then ask your women friends how many find 
their bras comfortable, and that gives you another. A bra that fits properly 
leaves you looking and feeling your best. A bra that’s too tight is uncomfort­
able, and one that’s too loose doesn’t give you the necessary support. Finally, 
a well-fitting bra makes you look slimmer. Here’s why: Your rib cage is your 
thinnest point. If you’re like most women, the lower you go below your rib 
cage, toward your belly, the wider you are. So you want to show off that rib 
cage, but you can’t do that if your breasts are sagging and covering most of it 
up. If your bra fits you correctly, however, your breasts look perky and stand 
out from your rib cage, making it visible.
	
Your correct bra size is very difficult to figure out on your own. To get fitted 
properly for a bra, go to the lingerie department of a department store or to a 
lingerie shop. The staff at either of these places can provide the expertise you 
need. Fittings are free at most department stores, and you don’t generally need 
an appointment. Ask for the lead specialist (she’s had the most experience). 
And keep in mind that you can’t get a proper measurement with your bra on. 
So you’re going to have to take it off and allow the expert to measure you. Don’t 
allow modesty to prevent you from getting fitted for the perfect bra; these 
experts have seen everything and are very professional.

256
Part V: Finishing Touches 
	
Get yourself professionally fitted at least once a year, and more often if you’ve 
undergone any dramatic weight loss or gain.
Shopping for bras
Almost all department stores have a lingerie department stocked with a 
wide variety of merchandise and the salespeople necessary to help with size 
and style. You can also go to any of the many lingerie shops and boutiques. 
Victoria’s Secret is always a good choice, too, because it has many locations 
and a large variety of styles at reasonable prices. You can also find specialty 
bra stores, where the personnel not only fit you for a bra but also alter the 
bra for you right at the store. These are often more expensive, but you’re 
sure to get the perfect fit and finest quality.
Wherever you shop, follow these steps to find a bra that fits properly 
(Figure 14-9 shows the different parts of a bra):
	
1.	Put it on the loosest fitting.
	
	 A bra stretches over time, and you’ll have to tighten it eventually, so you 
want to start out with room to tighten it.
	
	Over time, the elastic in a bra stretches, and you’ll notice that the bra 
rides up your back and doesn’t support your breasts. When that hap­
pens, go to the next set of hooks. When you’ve exhausted the hooks, it’s 
time to get a new bra.
	
2.	See whether you can run one finger comfortably around the inside 
edge of the band.
	
	 If you can’t, it’s too tight. If you can fit two fingers, then it’s too loose.
	
3.	Take a look at yourself in the mirror.
	
	 Do your breasts bulge out the sides or the top? Unless it’s a push-up bra 
that you want to boost your figure, bulging breasts means it’s too tight.
	
4.	Check out the gore, or middle of the bra in the front.
	
	 It should be flat against your chest. If it’s being pushed away from you, 
either the cups are too big or the band is too big.
	
5.	Move around and see how it feels:
 
• Bend over to make sure that your breasts don’t flop out. If they do, 
that’s a sure sign that the bra is too big.
 
• Put your arms over your head. If the band slips, it’s too big, but if it 
cuts, it’s too small.
 
• Twist your torso left and right. The bra should move with you, 
staying firmly in place.

257
 Chapter 14: It’s What’s Inside That Counts: Undergarments
	
6.	Pay attention to how the straps feel and how the cups look.
	
	 Are the straps weighing down your shoulders? If they need to be that 
tight for the bra to feel supportive, then the band size is not right. If the 
bra has wrinkles in the cup, the cup is too big.
When buying a bra, consider two key aspects: look and comfort. If you find 
a bra that you like that has both qualities, then where you buy it doesn’t 
matter. But if you’re dissatisfied with most of the bras you wear, I suggest 
you go to either a quality department store or a lingerie shop and spend 
whatever it takes to get a perfect bra.
	
Each manufacturer turns out slightly different bras in the same size, and that’s 
true season to season. So if you find a bra that fits perfectly, you may want to 
buy several.

Bra care
Bras have elastic in them and can be delicate, especially those with under­
wire and padding. By taking proper care of your bras, you can extend their 
life. Some tips:

258
Part V: Finishing Touches 
	
✓	Don’t wear the same bra two days in a row. By rotating bras day to 
day, you allow the elastic to recover.
	
✓	Wash them correctly. Hand-washing your bras is best. If you must put 
them in a machine, place them in a lingerie pop-up bag. And use a deter­
gent that doesn’t contain lanolin, which breaks down elastic. Brands 
made for lingerie or that are ecologically friendly don’t contain lanolin. 
(Unfortunately, the laundry detergents you commonly find at the gro­
cery store do contain lanolin.)
Panties
Shopping for panties is a lot less complicated than shopping for bras. Most 
of your decisions have to do with personal preference. What style is most 
comfortable for you (full brief, bikini, or thong)? Which cut is going to give 
you the coverage you need for the outfit you plan to wear? Do you prefer, 
silk, nylon, or cotton? Do you have a preference about color and design? And, 
most importantly, which cut is the most flattering on your body? Following 
are the different types of panties (many of which you can see in Figure 14-10):
	
✓	Briefs: The traditional standby, briefs today come in low cut (perfect if 
you’re wearing low-cut jeans) and high cut (which give you the illusion 
of a longer leg).
	
✓	Bikini: These offer less coverage than briefs but still cover your behind. 
Low-rise bikinis are good when you wear low-rise pants. Some are called 
string bikinis because the sides are thin, like strings.
	
✓	Thongs: In the early 1990s, women began wearing thong underwear so they 
would no longer have visible panty lines (VPL). Thong underwear has only 
a thin strip of fabric connecting the front of the panty to the back. This style 
doesn’t cover your butt, and it definitely feels different from traditional 
briefs and bikinis. Women who wear thongs swear by their comfort, so 
before you definitely decide they don’t belong in your underwear drawer, 
you may want to at least try one. You may be pleasantly surprised by their 
comfort and by the way your clothes look and feel over them. (There’s 
something to be said about the way you feel psychologically when you’re 
wearing one, too!)
	
	Don’t be afraid to wear a thong, even if you don’t think it’ll be flattering 
on you. Because a thong provides so little coverage, your body actually 
looks better and you have no panty lines to worry about. Without elastic 
to dig into your skin, it gives you an overall smooth look.
	
✓	G-strings: G-strings are similar to thongs, except that the connector is 
only a string rather than a strip of fabric.
	
✓	Boy shorts: This style of panty, which offers complete rear coverage (more 
like an actual short, hence the name), also eliminates VPL by extending 

259
 Chapter 14: It’s What’s Inside That Counts: Undergarments
further down the leg. The only drawback is that it’s another layer under 
your clothing. If you’re trying to appear thinner, go with a thong or G-string 
to avoid that extra layer between you and your pants, skirt, or dress.
	
✓	Seamless panties: These use spandex in the material to hold the panty 
in place and eliminate the seam around the thigh.
As for materials, cotton panties are the easiest to care for, but silk is the most 
luxurious. And undies made from microfiber wick away moisture, making them 
good for those who exercise. Why limit yourself to one style? It makes sense to 
have a variety for different occasions. What you pick to wear each day will be a 
function of your outfit, your activities, and — mostly — your mood.
Figure 14-10: Clockwise from top left: Briefs, bikini, boy shorts, and thong.
Shapers
Body shapers are amazing inventions that help improve your appearance by 
holding you in and smoothing you out. They use compression to make you 
appear smaller. Shapers come in a variety of styles from full-body shapers 
to ones that cover your stomach and upper legs. Which type you choose 
depends on where you think you need the most help. The original shapers 
were called girdles and were designed to keep a woman’s belly in. Panty 

260
Part V: Finishing Touches 
girdles added hips and thighs. Today you can find control briefs, control 
capris, control camisoles, and control slips. You can wear a shaper under 
everything from jeans to an evening gown.
	
When I do “Ambush Makeover” on NBC’s Today show, I put everyone — 
whether a size 2 or a size 20 — in Spanx (see Figure 14-11). An alternative to 
Spanx is Assets, a less expensive line sold at Target.
Some tips on wearing and caring for shapers:
	
✓	You can wear a shaper with or without panties. Your choice.
	
✓	If you wear a shaper on your lower half, don’t forget to wear a bra that fits 
properly and enhances your upper half. You want the whole look to be 
flattering and seamless — the perfect foundation underneath your outfit.
	
✓	Make sure you follow the washing instructions for the particular garment. 
Because you’re investing in a piece like this, take care of it properly.
	
You want to be comfortable in your clothing in order to be productive and 
enjoy your day. So dress to flatter your body type, and if you get a little help 
from a shaper where you need it, you’ll be ready for anything.

I
 have this fabulous pair of gold earrings (see the back cover picture). 
Without fail, every time I wear them, somebody stops me. The earrings 
cost under a hundred dollars, and I definitely got my money’s worth. I 
wear them with jeans and a T-shirt or a simple black dress. But no 
matter what I wear them with, they’re always a showstopper. 
Everyone needs a few accessories like that — pieces that 
can take an outfit from good to great.
This chapter shows you how to use accessories to 
take your wardrobe from simple to sizzling in a 
flash.
Scarves and Shawls
Unless you’re a big celebrity or have an unlimited bank 
account, it’s unlikely that you have a big enough ward­
robe to wear a new outfit everyday (would be nice, right?). 
You can make your outfits look different every time you wear 
them, though. It’s all about one word — accessories.

262
Part V: Finishing Touches 
Here’s an item you probably have in the back of your closet: a printed scarf. 
Scarves have the power to expand your wardrobe by making each outfit 
look different, especially if you tend to wear monochromatic tops. Because 
the focus of the outfit is the scarf, no one will notice that you’re wearing the 
same white top you wore last week. Solid scarves can also make an outfit 
pop. If you wear a multi-colored top, you can add a solid-colored scarf for 
a little extra flair.
Scarves, particularly ones made of silk, take up very little room and don’t 
require much care. (Unless you get them dirty, you rarely need to dry clean 
them.) What’s also great is that they’re available in all price ranges. You can 
get a great one for $20 or splurge on a designer scarf and spend hundreds. 
With a scarf, you can get away with spending a little less because the price 
doesn’t affect how the scarf fits you.
Winter scarves
Winter scarves are those you wear when you cozy 
up in front of the fire! Even though many of us 
are all bundled up in the winter, you can still look 
chic. Use your winter scarf to make a statement 
(see Figure 15-1). Here are some tips:
	
✓	Have a couple different scarves to match 
your winter coats. Because you may 
wear your winter scarves almost every 
day in cold weather, go with solids or 
classic weaves like plaid, houndstooth, 
or herringbone.
	
✓	Feel your winter scarves before buying. 
Some wool can be scratchy. (If you’re 
buying online or through a catalogue, make 
sure to check the return policy.)
	
✓	If you can, choose natural fibers. Cashmere 
is a great option if you can afford to splurge 
on your scarf. Pashmina (a type of cashmere 
woven in Kashmir from goats that live high 
in the Himalayas) scarves are also very pop­
ular. Scarves made from man-made fibers 
generally aren’t as cozy and luxurious as 
those made from natural fibers.

and still look chic.

 Chapter 15: Accessories
Summer scarves
Ah, summertime! Now I know the last thing you want to do when it gets 
really nice out is bundle up, but you can wear scarves even when it’s warm 
to make an outfit complete. How? Use your scarf as an accessory to bring 
an outfit together. In the summer, I like to wear a white T-shirt with white 
jeans and tie a bright scarf around my neck. I also like to use my scarf as 
a belt, as in Figure 15-2. You probably didn’t realize your scarf had so 
many uses!
Figure 15-2: A new way to wear your favorite scarf.
	
Using a brooch to keep your scarf closed is another option. (I love using my 
grandmother’s old pins to make a statement.)

Tying a scarf: A quick how-to
Did you know your scarf can go from being a shirt to a purse in seconds? 
Turning a scarf into unexpected items is so much fun to do — always a show-
stopper. Figure 15-3 shows the different ways to tie a scarf.
Figure 15-3: Different ways to use a scarf.

265
 Chapter 15: Accessories
Around the neck
Tying a scarf around your neck is certainly the classic way to wear it, and it 
keeps you looking chic without making you too warm. Wearing a scarf like 
this can make an otherwise plain suit pop. If you wear one in the summer 
with a T-shirt, your outfit is more complete. Remember, when you wear a 
scarf this way, it’s part of your outfit and you’ll want to keep it on, even when 
you’re indoors.
To tie a scarf around your neck, as shown in Figure 15-3, follow these steps:
	
1.	Fold the scarf into a triangle.
	
2.	Starting with the point, fold inward until the scarf is one long line.
	
3.	Tie it around your neck in either of the following ways:
 
• If the scarf is long: Start with it in the front of the neck and wrap it 
around the back and then back to the front. Tie a knot in the front.
 
• If the scarf is short: Place it around your neck and tie a knot in the 
front.
	
	 You can wear the knot either on the side or in the middle.
Around the waist
I love this look. Instead of using a conventional belt, try looping your scarf 
and threading it through the loops of your pants. This makes any outfit more 
fun (and is especially great with jeans). To turn a scarf into a belt (refer to 
Figure 15-2), follow these steps:
	
1.	Fold the scarf into a triangle.
	
2.	Starting with the point, fold inward until the scarf is one long line.
	
3.	Put it through the loops of jeans or slacks and tie a knot in the front.
Or you can just tie it like a sarong over your jeans, as in Figure 15-3. 
Here’s how:
	
1.	Fold scarf into a triangle.
	
2.	Wrap around your waist and tie the two ends at one hip.

266
Part V: Finishing Touches 
As a halter top
To tie a scarf like a halter top (see Figure 15-3), use a large square scarf (one 
that’s at least 36 inches square) and then follow these steps:
	
1.	Place the scarf on a flat surface with the dull side facing up. 
	
2.	In the middle of the scarf, tie a tight small knot.
	
3.	Take the two points directly across from each other and tie them 
around your neck.
	
4.	Tie the remaining two corners around your waist and tie a knot 
around your back.
As a pocketbook
Yes! Another one of my favorites. Your scarf can be transformed into a 
pocketbook (refer to Figure 15-3). Use a 36-inch square scarf and follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Place your scarf on a flat surface with the dull side facing up.
	
2.	Take the two points diagonal from each other and tie a tight knot in 
the middle of the scarf.
	
3.	Take the remaining two points and tie another knot (only 4 inches 
from the top).
	
	 This becomes the handle of your new, fabulous pocketbook.
Jewelry
Your jewelry collection comprises the most personal and special pieces 
you own. You collect it over a lifetime, and you generally don’t replace 
those items every season or even every few years. Often you get jewelry 
as a gift for special occasions or you inherit pieces from your mother or 
grandmother. Whether they’re pieces you were given or bought yourself, 
real or fake, fine or costume, all can have sentimental value and make you 
feel special when you wear them. Knowing how to incorporate these pieces 
into your wardrobe is important because they can really express your 
personality and style.

267
 Chapter 15: Accessories
Fine jewelry
Knowing what to splurge on and what to save on is really important. You 
shouldn’t spend a lot on some things (like trendy tops). Other items, though, 
are worth investing in. Two pieces are a must in every jewelry chest: dia­
mond stud earrings and a pearl necklace.
	
If you don’t have the money right now to buy major jewelry pieces for your 
wardrobe, don’t feel that these pieces are a must right now. I just want you to 
know what pieces to concentrate on when and if the occasion arises when you 
can spend money on jewelry.
	
You don’t need to splurge on certain items. I wear faux jewelry all the time. 
I bought the necklace in Figure 15-4 at my favorite store, Jennifer Miller (www.
jennifermillerjewelry.com). The one on the left is real and costs thou­
sands of dollars. The one on the right (which is mine) costs under $100. Crazy, 
right? (No way can you tell the difference!) Getting the same look as expensive 
jewelry without breaking the bank is possible.

Diamond studs earrings
If you can afford to buy a set of diamond studs in platinum or white or yellow 
gold, go for it. They’ll last forever and will go with everything. I wear mine 
with everything from cocktail dresses to jeans and a T-shirt. Everyone, from 
surfer chicks to those who prefer classic attire, should have diamond studs. 
(They also come in clip-on.)
	
If you’re laughing because buying expensive jewels isn’t even an option right 
now, cubic zirconia studs are a great alternative. As long as you don’t go too 
big, it’s very hard (unless you’re a jeweler) to tell that they’re not real. Again, 
smaller studs — under 2 karats — look more believable yet significant. I wear 
faux diamonds when I’m on vacation and no one can tell.
A pearl necklace
Another staple that goes with many different outfits and takes you to many 
different occasions is a pearl necklace. Even if you prefer very casual dress, a 
strand of pearls will be useful for those times when you need to get dressed 
Birthstones
Although the idea of certain stones being asso­
ciated with certain months dates back to the 
Old Testament, it wasn’t until the 18th century in 
Poland that the concept really took hold. Twelve 
birthstones exist, one for each month, and the 
list goes like this:
January — Garnet (deep red)
February — Amethyst (purple)
March — Aquamarine (pale blue)
April — Diamond (clear)
May — Emerald (green)
June — Pearl (white)
July — Ruby (red)
August — Peridot (pale green)
September — Sapphire (deep blue)
October — Opal (muilti-color)
November — Yellow Topaz (yellow)
December — Topaz (blue)
Some people become very attached to their 
birthstone and it becomes their signature stone. 
(Mine is diamond, so I am very attached!) If 
that’s the case with you, then incorporate your 
birthstone into your style and your wardrobe 
choices. If you were born in May, for example, 
emerald earrings or a necklace can make a 
black dress or suit pop instantly.

up. I wear pearls that my mother gave me, but if you don’t have a pearl neck­
lace, you can purchase your own without emptying your wallet. Pearls come 
in many levels of quality — the more perfect they are, the more expensive. 
You don’t need perfect pearls. You can find necklaces made of pearls that 
have slight imperfections or that aren’t all exactly the same size (another 
reason for the higher price).
	
Again, as with diamond studs and cubic zirconia, you can also buy a faux 
pearl necklace that no one will know is faux when paired with your fabulous 
outfit. And, if your look is a little more bohemian than classic, you can go with 
freshwater pearls. These are less expensive and have a different, more 
unusual look.
Costume or fashion jewelry
I love costume jewelry. I have people in my life (my dear friend Sandi and 
my mother) who have so much of it that they have a system of organization. 
Both use plastic bags (so they can see each piece) and organize the pieces 
by their general look. Every woman should explore the world of costume 
jewelry; you can make it work no matter what your style. A statement neck­
lace, earrings, or ring can really make an otherwise simple outfit fabulous. 
My pearl necklace (on the front cover) is an example of how a piece of great 
jewelry can dress up jeans instantly.
Costume or fashion jewelry is made with materials that are much less expen­
sive than fine jewelry. What looks like gold may be gold-plated (a thin layer of 
gold over another metal, most often copper or silver) or gold-filled (a thicker 
layer of gold laid over another metal, often brass). The designation gold-filled 
requires that the weight of the gold equal one-twentieth the weight of the 
entire piece. Eventually, the outer layer of gold is going to wear away, but 
how long that takes depends on the manufacturing process and how careful 
you are in protecting the piece.
Costume and fashion jewelry can vary in price depending on whether or not 
the piece has a designer name attached to it or whether the materials are 
rhinestones, cubic zirconia, or the more expensive semi-precious stones. 
Because it’s more affordable, costume jewelry also enables you to buy dif­
ferent pieces to go with certain outfits. When you’re looking for the perfect 
accessory for a specific outfit, costume jewelry is a great option. You can 
build an outfit around a great piece.

Vintage jewelry
Although people don’t like the idea of wear­
ing clothes that other people have worn, many 
women have a different feeling about vintage 
jewelry. Especially with formalwear, vintage 
is very popular and can give you a beautifully 
classic look.
Vintage jewelry can be anything from a brooch 
you pick up at a flea market to an engagement 
ring you buy at an expensive antique jewelry 
shop. Because it’s really about the look you’re 
going for, hunting for inexpensive and unusual 
pieces to spruce up your wardrobe is a great 
idea (and can be a fun project). As with costume 
jewelry, or any jewelry for that matter, you want 
certain pieces to pop, so don’t overdo it when 
you wear vintage jewelry. Try wearing one 
piece at a time and make that the focal point of 
your outfit. No one will be able to tell if it’s real 
or not, and you will get a chance to show your 
personal flair.
Making your bangles 
and beads work
Playing around with different ways to wear jewelry is fun. Stacking several 
bracelets or necklaces can work, especially if you’re wearing a very simple 
outfit. Just remember: Wear only one statement piece at a time. If you opt 
for a ton of bangles on your arm, go with a more subtle necklace or earrings 
(studs always work).
Mixing real and faux jewelry is also a good idea because the real items make 
your costume jewels look that much richer.
	
Again, be careful of how much jewelry you wear at any given moment. One 
piece that pops is often the way to go. A great trick to guard against over-
accessorizing is to put on everything you think you want to wear while your 
back is to the mirror, and then quickly turn around. The first thing you see in 
the mirror is the one thing that may be putting your outfit over the top. If you 
remove that item, you’re good to go. Figure 15-5 shows how too many accesso­
ries can overwhelm an outfit, but just the right number can make a great outfit 
even better.

Hats
I have hair that needs to be blown out or I look like I stuck my head in a 
socket. Hats are often my best friends on the days I just can’t bring myself to 
blow out my hair for an hour.

Part V: Finishing Touches 
That said, before you add a bunch of hats to your wardrobe, you definitely 
have to be comfortable with wearing them. Hats worn for warmth in winter 
are definitely easier to get away with than ones that are pure fashion 
statements. Hats certainly aren’t for everyone (some people just don’t 
look good in them), but if you learn what works for you, hats are another 
way to achieve a different look, not to mention save you from a bad 
hair day!
The following is a list of the basic hat types:
	
✓	Baseball cap: Baseball caps are sporty and look 
best with workout clothes or jeans and a T-shirt. 
They are most commonly worn when outside 
watching a sporting event or concert or when 
running around doing errands on a bad hair day. 
They are not especially fashionable, but they can 
be cute on the weekend.
	
✓	Beret: The French beret is made of soft wool in 
a multitude of colors. You can personalize it by 
pushing the crown to one side or the other, wear­
ing it at many different angles, or even adding a 
brooch or pin to it. Berets are great for keeping 
warm and making a fashion statement. They’re a 
perfect addition to your fall wardrobe when the 
temperatures start dropping. Use a beret to top 
off a cute sweater, jeans, boots, and a wrap; or 
wear one with your new fall coat. Because you 
can mold them however you like and wear them 
in a number of ways, decide where it looks best 
(tilted right or left, or pushed more forward or 
back) and is most comfortable for you.
	
✓	Cowboy hat: The traditional ones are great if you 
live in the West but hard to match with anything 
other than jeans. However, straw versions of 
these are very popular in the summertime. The 
straw ones look great with a sun dress or a bath­
ing suit on the beach.
	
✓	Fedora: Fedoras were originally made of soft felt. 
Like cowboy hats, nowadays fedoras can even be 
found in straw. This is a very stylish-looking hat 
and is generally worn to add flair to an otherwise 
simple outfit (see Figure 15-6).
Figure 15-6: A hat can 
serve as the statement 
piece of an outfit.

273
 Chapter 15: Accessories
	
✓	Sun hat: These are usually made of straw or light canvas and have a 
wide brim to protect your face and neck from the harmful effects of 
the sun. Sun hats are great for the beach or just being out on a sunny 
summer day and work with almost any summertime outfit.
FFP
	
The only thing you have to be careful of when you wear hats is looking too 
gimmicky. You don’t want to appear as if you’re in a costume. Choose a hat 
that’s in style and make sure your personality is one that can carry it off 
before you incorporate that look into your wardrobe. Hats can land you in the 
hands of the fashion police when not worn correctly. If you have thoughts that 
the hat you chose may look silly, it likely does. I often ask my co-writer Dana if 
a hat looks good on me or if it’s too much. This is a time when a friend’s opin­
ion helps a great deal.
	
If you’re looking for a hat that’s hard to find, try a vintage shop. As with jew­
elry, they’re great places to find that one-of-a-kind piece.
Bags
You’d be surprised how big a fashion statement a bag can make. Just as 
hemlines go up and down according to the latest trend, bags get bigger and 
smaller accordingly.
Types of bags
A great bag can actually make an entire outfit. You could be wearing jeans 
and a plain white top, but if you carry a fabulous statement bag you can 
change your whole look. Handbags come in a variety of categories, including:
	
✓	Baguette: A long, thin bag named after the French bread. Fashionistas 
set the trend with these when Fendi came out with these “it” bags.
	
✓	Clutch: This size bag works with everything from jeans to formal wear. 
The more dressed up you are, the less you’re supposed to carry. When 
you’re at your most elegant, the only bag to carry is a small clutch (in 
most cases without a handle). These small bags force you to be very 
selective about what you take with you. However, a clutch is also 
appropriate if you don’t have much to carry and are just running to 
meet a friend for lunch or a casual dinner.

274
Part V: Finishing Touches 
	
✓	Duffle: A take-off on the bags carried by 
sailors, a duffle bag is a large, roundish bag 
with a zipper on the top that holds your 
entire life and then some. Often more useful 
and durable than fashionable, this bag is 
perfect to hold everything you may need for 
day-to-day running around with the kids!
	
✓	Evening bag: Evening bags are usually 
clutches and often small enough to fit in 
your hand or under one arm. The level of 
detailing further declares how dressy a 
bag is. Fancier evening bags have a lot 
of detailing — like beads, sequins, and 
metallic fabric — that make them stand out. 
Some evening bags have a thin strap, handy 
when you need your hands to carry a drink 
during the cocktail hour, and the strap can 
usually be tucked inside if you want it to be 
simply a clutch. Judith Leiber is known for 
her beautiful evening bags that are uniquely 
shaped to match a woman’s interests and 
personality. (I was once given an evening 
bag shaped like a bird.)
	
✓	Hobo: These soft, crescent-shaped bags 
with a long handle are meant to be worn 
over the shoulder. Hobo bags are very styl­
ish and also practical because they can hold 
a ton of stuff. They’re unstructured and go 
with clothing that is more casual or flowing.
	
✓	Kelly bag: This rectangular bag with a 
metal clasp is the epitome of luxury (see 
Figure 15-7). In addition to the traditional 
look, some are made from exotic leathers 
like alligator or ostrich. The prices can go as high as $27,000; and that 
goes for vintage bags as well as new ones.
	
	Grace Kelly made these bags famous in 1956 when she used one to hide 
her pregnancy from prying photographers.
	
✓	Messenger: Originally created to carry mail or messages, this type of 
bag is large and, when the strap is placed across the back and chest, 
leaves both hands free. Today, you see it carried by both men and 
women in most large urban areas.
Figure 15-7: The Kelly bag.

275
 Chapter 15: Accessories
	
✓	Satchel: The traditional satchel 
bag is very much like a messen­
ger bag, but the name has also 
been attached to other smaller 
bags with shorter handles that 
can be carried in your hand.
	
✓	Shoulder: Any bag that has a 
strap long enough to go over 
your shoulder is a shoulder 
bag.
	
✓	Tote: A tote bag is a large bag 
with an open top that’s good 
for carrying everything from 
groceries to a weekend’s worth 
of bikinis (see Figure 15-8).
This list should also include the 
simple handbag, because most 
bags that are sold don’t actually 
fit into a particular category. The 
simple handbag is available in a 
wide variety of shapes and sizes, 
with an amazing assortment of 
pockets and flaps on the inside 
to help you to organize your life. 
Those of you who juggle a million 
things every day are going to need 
a bag that’s functional and practical 
as well as cute!
Figure 15-8: A tote bag is perfect for a 
day at the beach.
High-end designer bags are definitely a luxury 
item. They are beautiful and well made (it can 
take up to 20 hours to make a hand-crafted bag). 
However, most of them cost upward of $1,000, 
so having even one can be a stretch for most 
people.
If you want that designer bag for a special event 
but don’t want to spend designer prices, try 
www.bagborroworsteal.com. This site 
allows you to rent luxury bags by the week or 
the month at prices that start from $50 and go 
to $200 (depending on whether or not you’re a 
member and how long you keep it).

Picking a handbag
Just as you wouldn’t choose a pair of pants or any other item of clothing 
simply by the way it looks on the shelf, you shouldn’t choose a handbag that 
way, either. Here are things to consider when buying your next handbag:
	
✓	Consider what color and style you need. Handbags get paired with so 
many different outfits, so consider carefully what color and style you 
need. My advice:
 
• Cover the basics first. Get a neutral bag that goes with everything. 
If you already have that great black bag and you want to invest in 
a new bag, go for a different color. If you tend to wear mostly neu­
trals, a bag in a fun color can be a great accent piece.
 
• If you’re buying a bag to go with a specific outfit, wear some­
thing similar to that outfit when you go shopping. This way you’ll 
know that you’re making a smart purchase that matches the outfit 
you plan to wear it with.
	
✓	Check to see that the bag balances your size. A bag shouldn’t over­
whelm you if you’re on the smaller side. Just like your clothing, you want 
your bag to look right proportionately and enhance your overall look.
	
✓	Determine whether it complements your basic body shape. If you’re 
more round-shaped, you want to offset that with a square-ish, structured 
bag. But if you’re very angular, a round-shaped bag (like a crescent-
shaped Hobo) may be better for you.
	
✓	Compare the bag color to your shoe color. It always looks polished to 
have shoes and a bag that complement each other. Having said that, 
the days when bags and shoes have to match exactly are gone. Putting 
together an outfit in which all your accessories work together without 
being too matchy-matchy lets you express your personal style and look 
current at the same time.
For Eyes: Spectacles
Of course glasses are used for their obvious purpose — to correct your 
vision — but they can also work as a great accessory. It comes as no surprise 
that many designers have come out with their very own line of frames. As 

277
 Chapter 15: Accessories
with clothing, trends come and go in the optical world. Investing in frames 
that best suit your face before splurging on ones that may be hot only this 
season is definitely the way to go.
Matching frames to face
Faces, just like bodies, come in general shapes. 
Your face can be oval, oblong, round, square, or 
triangular. Recognizing the shape of your face 
assists you in determining what type of frame 
suits you best.
	
✓	Oval: An oval face looks good in just about 
any type of frame (see Figure 15-9).
	
✓	Oblong: Oblong faces are much longer than 
they are wide. Frames that sit in the middle 
of your face break up that long line.
	
✓	Round: To deemphasize the roundness of 
your face, choose frames with more straight 
lines.
	
✓	Square: To deemphasize a square face, 
choose frames that are more rounded (see 
Figure 15-10). Glasses that are heavier on 
the top also give a lengthening effect.
	
✓	Triangular: Avoid large frames that make 
the upper portion of your face look bigger. 
Also stay away from bright colors, because 
these also draw attention to the top half of 
your face.
Figure 15-9: Aviator glasses go 
well with an oval-shaped face.

278
Part V: Finishing Touches 
Skin tone and hair color also play a role in 
deciding which frame colors are right for you. 
Your glasses are meant to flatter and enhance 
your face, not overwhelm it. If your skin is very 
pale and you wear very dark glasses, for exam­
ple, the glasses will stand out so much that 
people won’t appreciate the rest of your face.
The length of your nose is another factor to 
consider. If you have a short nose, wear lighter 
glasses that sit high on your face to maximize 
the visible length; if you have a long nose, 
glasses with a double bridge (two bars) can 
make it seem a bit shorter. Large frames can 
balance a large nose, but small frames only 
accentuate the size.

well with a square-shaped face.

High heels or ballet flats go with everything.
Liz Lange, Fashion Designer
Your obsession with shoes may have begun when you were 2 years old 
and you stepped into a pair of your mother’s high heels. 
Eventually you grew up enough to shop for your own. How 
much fun! Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City took 
shoe shopping to a whole new level. Whether you live in 
a big city, in the suburbs, or on a farm, every woman 
should strut in style!
The great thing about new shoes is that they can 
reinvent any outfit in your closet. That little black 
dress you already own, for example, will look so 
much better with a fabulous new pair of strappy 
sandals. Buying a new pair of shoes also gives you 
that extra boost of confidence and makes you feel 
sexier with every step. This chapter shows you how 
to shop for comfortable, stylish shoes without breaking 
the bank.

Part V: Finishing Touches 
Crash Course in Shoe Shopping
When you’re heading out the door to go shoe shopping (lucky you!), first 
make sure you know what you’re looking for. If warmer weather is coming 
and you don’t have any sandals to go with your dresses, for example, then 
plan to buy a great pair of strappy shoes. Or if you have a garment you’d 
love to wear but don’t have the right shoes to go with it, keep an eye out for 
just the right shoe. I once had a fabulous dress in fuchsia, but didn’t have 
the right shoes to wear with it until I found the perfect pair of gold high-heel 
­sandals.
My point? Have a goal when heading into a shoe store. Taking this approach 
makes your shopping excursion both practical and fun. Without a plan, shoe 
shopping is going to hurt your wallet, not your feet.
First steps: Getting ready
Just as with clothing, do your research and prepare before you go shoe 
­shopping: 
	
✓	Look through some fashion magazines to see what’s in style. Are 
chunkier heels or stilettos in style? Are toes pointy or more rounded? 
What height are the boots? Are flats in? With an idea of what you’re look­
ing for, you’re better prepared to hit the stores without all the choices 
overwhelming you.
	
	Some of the trendier designs probably won’t be in style for very long. If 
you decide to go with something very trendy, try to find an inexpensive 
version. That way, when the trends change in the coming season, you 
haven’t wasted a ton of money on shoes you don’t want to wear anymore.
	
✓	Make sure you have the right hose or socks when you go to try on 
shoes. If you’re looking for sneakers, you need the kinds of socks you’d 
wear with the sneakers. If you’re buying pumps or boots, you need a 
thin sock or stocking — whatever you plan to wear underneath. (Most 
shoe stores provide stocking-like disposable peds you can use when you 
try on shoes.) Because sandals are worn with bare feet, you’ll be fine 
when trying those on.
	
If you know you’ll be shopping for shoes, make sure the footwear you have on 
comes off easily, especially if you’re visiting more than one store. Who wants 
to waste time tying laces when you could be looking for more potential buys!

281
 Chapter 16: Putting Your Best Foot Forward: Shoes
Paying attention to fit 
I love the look of high heels. I think many outfits look better and sexier when 
heels are worn. With that said, I am a huge fan of flats, too. Regardless of 
whether you’re wearing heels or flats, neither will be comfortable if it doesn’t 
fit properly. That’s why in this section I begin with the basics: how to find the 
right shoe size for you.
Measuring your feet — both of them
Taking an accurate foot measurement requires more than just slipping your 
foot into one of those foot measurement devices. To get the right measure­
ment, follow these suggestions:
	
✓	Make sure to get both feet measured at a shoe store. Your feet may 
not be the same size. It’s not uncommon for one foot to be bigger than 
the other. A slight difference between one foot and the other may not 
matter, but if the difference is as much as half a size, it does. If one foot 
is bigger than the other, buy footwear that fits the bigger foot.
	
✓	Stand on the foot measurement device, rather than put your foot on it 
while sitting. Your foot gets wider when you stand.
	
✓	Get your feet measured toward the end of the day. Feet tend to swell 
as the day goes along. At the end of the day, they’re at their fullest.
	
✓	Get your feet re-measured every so often. As you age, your foot size 
may change.
Taking shoe shape into consideration
Just because you know the size of your feet doesn’t necessarily mean that 
every shoe of that size fits you comfortably. The basic shape of the shoe is 
called the last (see Figure 16-1). Variations in the last can mean that, while 
one size 8 shoe fits you like a glove, another size 8 shoe could be too big or 
too small.
When you try on shoes, pay attention to how they feel. While the level of 
comfort a shoe provides should be apparent, here are a few specific things to 
look for:
	
✓	The toe box: This is the part of the shoe where your toes go. You want 
the toe box to be big enough to accommodate all five of your toes com­
fortably. If it’s too big, your foot will slide around and you’ll end up with 
blisters. And if it’s too small (your toes will be a little cramped when you 
try them on), you’ll wish you never bought them after only a few hours 
wearing them.

282
Part V: Finishing Touches 
Figure 16-1: The parts of a shoe.
	
✓	The vamp: This part of the shoe covers the top of the foot. Depending 
on how high the arch of your foot is, a shoe vamp may or may not fit 
comfortably. Different brands cut differently, so find one that fits you 
correctly.
	
✓	Sole: One part that you’re probably very familiar with, the sole is the 
bottom of the shoe. The soles of sneakers have ridges and are made of 
rubber to provide traction, while leather soles are thinner and more 
fashionable. Dancing, anyone? The thicker the sole, the more comfort­
able walking is, because the thickness protects your feet from the hard 
ground below.
	
✓	Counter: The counter is the back part of the shoe. If there’s too much 
space between the back of your foot and the counter, your foot moves 
too much, and all that rubbing will cause a blister. As long as the shoe 
fits your foot properly in every other way, try the next shoe size down 
for a better fit — or if you’re between sizes, try a shoe pad.
	
✓	Heel: The heel supports the back of your foot, determines the height of 
the shoe, and contributes to the shoe’s style. The heel height can vary 
from half an inch to 5 inches.
	
Just as with clothing, each shoe manufacturer produces a slightly different fit, 
even if the sizes are all 8s. Some lines are narrower, some wider, and so on. 
When you find a shoe you like and that fits, check out the entire collection 
from that designer, which more than likely will fit you correctly and comfort­
ably. Knowing which lines of shoes fit comfortably and which don’t gives you 
a head start when you’re shoe shopping in person or online.

283
 Chapter 16: Putting Your Best Foot Forward: Shoes
If at all possible, try on shoes before you buy. If you purchase your shoes 
online, you may have to send the shoes back if they don’t fit. Although 
returning merchandise can be a pain, it’s a lot less painful than wearing shoes 
that don’t fit!
	
Some people are under the impression that all shoes have to be broken in — 
not true! An uncomfortable pair of shoes may become a little more comfort­
able over time, and the use of a shoe stretcher can help. Still, don’t count on 
this when buying new shoes. Your best bet is to find shoes that fit you com­
fortably in the store; more than likely, they’ll be comfortable the first time you 
wear them, too.
	
Don’t assume the shoes inside a box are new just because a salesman brings 
them from the storeroom. Take a good look at the shoes before you try them 
on. Especially look at the bottom: If the shoes have been returned, you can 
easily see signs of wear and tear on the sole. A returned shoe isn’t necessar­
ily one you shouldn’t buy; just make sure the shoes are comfortable and have 
nothing wrong with them. Sometimes you can ask for a discount if the wear is 
noticeable.
It’s a shoe-in! Shoe care tips
To maintain your shoes so they last and look great for as long as possible, 
follow these suggestions:
	
✓	Shine them. Shining shoes not only improves their appearance but 
protects them as well. It doesn’t have to be an onerous chore: Just keep 
some polish and a few rags near where you watch TV. Waxes and liquid 
polish add gloss to a shoe but don’t offer as much protection as creams 
and paste, which penetrate and moisturize the leather. So if you’re out 
in bad weather, you scuff your shoe, or you just notice that they’re look­
ing dull, break out the polish.
	
✓	Have them resoled and repaired when necessary. The soles and heels 
get more wear and tear than the uppers. Having your shoes resoled 
when they’re worn down is great way to extend the life of your shoes, 
as long as the uppers are in good shape. And even if the uppers need 
a little fixing too, a reputable shoe repair place should be able to make 
them as good as new.
	
	Have your favorite shoes (the ones you wear all the time because you 
love them) professionally cleaned and maintained at the end of the 
season, before you store them away for next year. (Don’t bother doing 
this with trendy shoes that you aren’t going to wear again next year.)

Shoe Styles
Certain styles of shoes are appropriate for certain situations. A pump, for 
example, is appropriate for the office. A flip-flop is appropriate for the beach. 
Knowing what style works where narrows your choices when shopping for 
that certain occasion.
Pumps
Pumps, a variety of which are shown in Figure 16-2, are shoes that cover the 
toe box, have anywhere from a low to high heel, and are usually slipped on 
without any fastening. They’re accepted as the traditional business shoe for 
women. Pumps can range from conservative, basic, low-heel, black leather, 
and nondescript to high heel, pointy toe, and sexy in any range of fabrics and 
colors. 
Figure 16-2: From left: Classic black pump, peep-toe pump, kitten heel pump.
Shoe psych 101
Most women have a strong attraction to shoes. 
Some of the cutest pictures my mother has of 
me show me strutting around the house in her 
high heels. Wearing high heels signifies coming 
of age. Another attraction to shoes is that, in 
any shopping expedition, you can almost always 
find a pair of shoes that fits. Many women get 
frustrated when shopping for clothing because 
finding something that looks perfect is often 
difficult. But because body type doesn’t neces­
sarily determine what type of shoe looks good 
on you, two very differently shaped women can 
buy the same pair and both feel like a million 
bucks.

285
 Chapter 16: Putting Your Best Foot Forward: Shoes
Current pump styles change with the trends. Straps across the top of the foot 
turn a simple pump into a Mary Jane pump. Another variation is the T-strap 
pump, in which a circle of leather surrounds your ankle and a strap descends 
down toward the toe box of the shoe. A peep-toe pump has the toe area cut 
out to expose the tips of your toes.
Mules
Take the back off your pumps and what have you got? A mule (see Figure 16-3). 
You can wear mules when you go shopping, when you go to work, or when 
you head out for the night. The key is the shoe. Mules come in a variety of 
styles, from pumps to sandals. (Any backless shoe is considered a mule.)
FFP
	
Don’t wear pantyhose or tights with mules. Because a mule has no ankle sup­
port, your foot will slip. Plus it looks ridiculous!
Figure 16-3: From left: A classic mule and a wedge mule.
Flats and sandals
Don’t let anyone tell you that flats aren’t sexy! They’re not only very sensible 
shoes, but they can be very stylish, too. They’re super comfortable (as long 
as the fit is right) and can take you from day to night. In fact, most women 
welcome the current trend of wearing flats (I’m in flats of some sort 75 per­
cent of the time) because comfort is key. In addition, designers are making 
both beautiful dressy and casual flats, giving women more choices when put­
ting an outfit together. Everything from ballet flats (see Figure 16-4) to dressy 
sandal flats are available.

286
Part V: Finishing Touches 
	
Because soles of flats are just that — flat — you may be more comfortable if 
you get a pair that have a cushioned insole. When shopping for flats, bring an 
insole with you if you think you may want to add it. That way, you can make 
sure the fit is correct when trying them on.
By definition, sandals replace the top of the shoe with different combinations 
of straps so that most of the foot is left bare. Here’s a look at the two types of 
sandals:
	
✓	Casual sandals: These are a great way to change up your wardrobe for 
the summer months. Casual sandals can range from flip-flops to strappy 
flats to ribbon-tie wedges. While rubber flip-flops are most appropriate 
for the beach, you can find plenty of open-toe sandals for summer that 
are suitable for the office or a casual dinner. Casual sandals look great 
with everything from jeans to sundresses.
	
✓	Dressier sandals: These are considered appropriate for formal occa­
sions. Strappy sandals with high heels can be very dressy. Some are 
made of leather and others satin, and some have embellishments. 
Metallic sandals, such as gold or silver (see Figure 16-4), are very popu­
lar with evening wear because they’re neutral but give you a little more 
flair than basic black. Don’t be afraid to dress up your jeans with high-
heel strappy sandals for a night on the town!
Figure 16-4: Ballet slippers (left) and dressier gold sandals (right).
FFP
	
I feel compelled to say this, even though I’m sure you already know it: Don’t 
wear sandals if your feet aren’t ready for them. If you don’t have time to get a 
pedicure, just take off your polish and make sure your toes look neat. Nothing 
is worse than a fab pair of sandals with a not-so-fabulous pair of feet!

287
 Chapter 16: Putting Your Best Foot Forward: Shoes
Sneakers and sport shoes
Sneakers come in a wide variety of styles (see Figure 16-5) and you’ll defi­
nitely be able to find a pair that suits your needs both in comfort and style. 
Just remember that while sneakers can be a style statement, especially if 
your style is on the sporty side, they don’t complement every outfit. There 
are definitely times when sneakers (like Converse) can make an outfit really 
adorable. But for the most part, sneakers are for the gym and days when 
you’re just lounging or running the kids around.
Figure 16-5: Different styles of sneakers.
Boots
I’m a big fan of boots. I love everything from casual UGGs (sheepskin boots) 
to high, black leather boots. I just love whipping mine out when fall comes 
around. As much as I love boots, though, I believe they have a time and a 
place. Wear boots during the cooler months and store them away during 
warmer ones. Why? First, it makes old things seem new again: If you store 
your boots for the summer, you can look forward to wearing them again in 
the fall and they’ll feel like new. Second, boots are too warm to wear during 
the summer and much of the spring. Some people do it, but I think it’s fun to 
vary up your look and give everything in your wardrobe a shot!
You can choose from a variety of boot styles, depending on your look and 
your body type. Your choices include ankle boots, knee-high boots, and 
above-the-knee boots. Boots also come in a variety of heel heights (flat to 
low-heel to high-heel) and heel styles (chunky, wedge, or stiletto). The boot 
itself can be pull up, zipper, or lace-up. And did I mention the toe shape? The 
toe can be pointy, square, or round. Figure 16-6 shows a few boot styles. As 
you can see, you have a lot of options!
Any type of boot can look sexy. My ex-boyfriend loved when I wore a fitted 
hoodie sweatshirt with leggings and UGG Boots. As long as you pair your 
favorite boots with the right outfit, you can turn your look from drab to fab 
instantly!

Because boots are more noticeable than shoes (after all, they can come half­
way up your leg), you want them to have the appearance of high quality and 
style, which means you have to spend a little more. I bought a pair of Jimmy 
Choo boots four seasons ago, and although they were very expensive, they 
are still standing strong. Classic boots are worth spending on. A great pair 
of leather knee-high boots (with a heel or flat) is a great investment. When 
searching for that great pair of boots, take into account the clothing in your 
closet, the occasions you plan to wear them, and how much you can spend 
on them.
	
Boots are great with jeans. Try these looks; either option gives you the fash­
ionable look of wearing boots and the confidence that comes with that:
	
✓	Tuck a pair of skinny jeans into knee-high boots. This is a great look if 
you want to show off your legs.
	
✓	Pair ankle boots with boot-cut or flared jeans. Wear the jeans over the 
boots.

 Chapter 16: Putting Your Best Foot Forward: Shoes
Cowboy boots are in a category 
unto themselves. They come in 
and out of style as a fashion state­
ment. If the occasion or location 
fits, or if you are a true cowgirl, 
these boots are great. Otherwise, 
better to invest in a pair of fashion 
boots that better suit the needs of 
your wardrobe.
Finally, many women have taken 
to wearing high rubber boots in 
an assortment of wild colors and 
designs (see Figure 16-7). These 
boots are perfect for a rainy or 
snowy season. They protect your 
clothing, keep your feet dry, and 
make a fashion statement at the 
same time. They come in basic 
neutral colors and in a variety 
of brights. Just make sure that 
if you decide to go for a fun pair 
in a bright color, the rest of your 
outfit is neutral. Rain boots are 
meant to be fun and brighten up 
a dreary day. If you know how to 
make them work into your ward­
robe, go for it. If not, stick with the 
neutrals.
Honing In on 
Heel Heights
Nothing says sexy like a high heel. Your legs look better when wearing high 
heels because your calf muscles are flexed, shortened, and more defined. 
High heels also elongate the appearance of your legs, making you look longer 
and leaner (see Figure 16-8).
Figure 16-7: There’s a way to make rain boots 
look ­fashionable.

290
Part V: Finishing Touches 
Figure 16-8: Nothing says sexy like a high heel.
Two things affect heel height:
	
✓	The size of the shoe: The larger the shoe, the higher the heel. If you get 
a size 6 shoe with a 1-inch heel, you get a 1-inch heel height. But order 
that same shoe in a size 11 and the heel height is 11⁄2 inches. The heel 
height has to be in proportion to the size of the shoe. Because a size 11 
shoe is obviously bigger than a size 6 shoe, the heel height is greater, 
too. Sometimes women with size 11 shoes don’t want that added height, 
so they adjust the heel height downward.
	
✓	Where the heel height is measured from: The heel height can be mea­
sured from the center of the heel or from the back. Measuring from 
the back results in a higher measurement. This consideration may be 
important when you want everyone wearing the same heel height, like in 
a bridal party. (By the way, the wedding industry measures shoes from 
the inside of the heel.) If you’re only choosing for yourself, be aware that 
different shoes with the same heel height printed on the box may have 
noticeable differences in the actual height. The likely culprit for this 
discrepancy is the location of the measurement; center, back, or front 
of the heel.

Yikes! Well, at one point or another, we’ve all been fashion 
victims — but never again! In this section, I offer tips on 
how you can avoid the all-too-common fashion mistakes. 
And because I often leave my house in the morning and

Ten Fashion Faux Pas and 
How to Avoid Them
In This Chapter
▶	Knowing what to show and what not to show
▶	Avoiding other mistakes
F
aux pas is a French expression that in English means something you’re 
not supposed to do. In this chapter, I list ten fashion mistakes you want 
to avoid at all costs.
Over-Accessorizing
You’ve heard the old saying “less is more,” right? Like many 
old sayings, it’s lasted for a reason. Wearing big statement 
pieces to express your personal style is definitely fun 
and fashionable, but you don’t want to wear too many 
statement pieces at one time. Pick one piece that you 
want people to notice. Wear a chunky necklace, chan­
delier earrings, or a cute hair accessory. Wearing 
all of them at once overwhelms your overall look, 
distracts anyone from looking at your face, and 
makes you look like you tried too hard to be matchy-
matchy. (For more information on how to acces­
sorize, see Chapter 15.)

294
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Problematic Panties
Doesn’t the title say it all? Panties should always be worn under, not out of, 
your clothing. Obviously, panties sticking out of your jeans or slacks is a 
giant no-no. Make sure (and you can even test this) that no matter what your 
pose — sitting, standing, or bending to pick up a pen — your undergarments 
don’t expose themselves (see Figure 17-1).
	
Your jeans or pants are there to cover your rear and flatter it. If your under­
wear is sticking out, chances are good that your outfit is doing nothing for 
your entire midsection and backside. Don’t draw unwanted attention there by 
letting your panties, or worse, your rear, stick out of them. Yikes!
Figure 17-1: Keep your panties covered.

295
 Chapter 17: Ten Fashion Faux Pas and How to Avoid Them
Wearing White to a Wedding
As is tradition, the bride will (most likely) be in white, so you shouldn’t be. 
In addition to white, avoid ivory, cream, ecru, eggshell, linen, or any other 
nearly white color. People often question whether black is okay to wear to a 
wedding. If it’s a nighttime affair, then yes, black is totally chic. However, if 
it’s a daytime affair, stay away from black. For more on dressing for special 
occasions, head to Chapter 11.
Baring Your Stomach 
Baring your stomach — unless you’re wearing a bathing suit — is another 
giant no (see Figure 17-2). Just as showing your rear isn’t the height of fash­
ion sophistication, neither is showing your stomach. Even if you can get 
beyond the lack of sophistication, it’s not a flattering look for most women. 
A cropped top cuts you right in the middle and draws all the attention to 
your waist. Believe me, you can look sexy in many ways; showing your 
stomach is not one of them.
Figure 17-2: Avoid showing your stomach.

296
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Wearing Hose with Open-Toe Shoes
Gasp! Seeing the seam of pantyhose across someone’s toes in an open-toe 
shoe gives me hives! If you’re wearing sandals, it’s probably warm out, 
and you don’t need hose. If you’re wearing pantyhose, it’s probably 
cold enough out to warrant closed-toe shoes. Even if you came up with 
what seemed like a logical reason to pair hose and open-toe shoes, the 
look is an absolute no. No exceptions! Head to Chapter 14 for more 
hosiery rules.
	
Part of being fashionable is dressing appropriately for the season and the 
weather. If it’s hot, wear sexy sandals and go with bare legs. If it’s cold, pair 
the hose or tights with great boots or pumps. Of course, you can also wear 
open-toe sandals (sans hose) in the winter with an evening dress, as long as 
you’re not outdoors for an extended period.
Wearing High Waters
Wearing capri pants is one thing; wearing pants that are meant to be full 
length but that fall too high on your leg is quite another (see Figure 17-3). 
Make sure your pants hit the top of your shoe (or foot, if you’re wearing a 
sandal). You don’t want to look like you’re ready for a flood.
Wearing pants that are too short not only takes away from the long, clean line 
that is supposed to make you appear taller and thinner, but it also looks like 
you bought the wrong size, got them hemmed improperly, or shrank them in 
the wash — none of which is good.
Too much
The most common fashion faux pas is to overdo 
it. That could mean wearing too much jewelry, 
too much perfume, too much makeup; show­
ing too much skin; or wearing too tight a dress 
or too high a heel. You may  think that, because 
so many of the outfits seen on the fashion 
runways are over the top, exaggeration has a 
part to play in everyday fashion, but that’s not 
so. Remember, all fashion is an accessory to the 
person wearing the clothes, you. If you overdo 
it, then you will get overwhelmed. So while you 
always want to make a style statement, you 
never want to  be a fashion victim. If you abide by 
the golden rule — less is more — you’ll always
be able to avoid becoming a fashion faux pas.

297
 Chapter 17: Ten Fashion Faux Pas and How to Avoid Them
Figure 17-3: Pants aren’t supposed to look like they shrank in the wash.
Wearing White Underwear 
under Anything Sheer
If you’re wearing a sheer top, choose flesh-toned undergarments. These come 
in a variety of shades, so you can find one that matches your skin tone. The 
flesh-toned color of your bra, camisole, or slip gives the illusion that you 
don’t have anything on underneath, while everything really remains covered 
and hidden. This way, you get the full effect of the beauty of the sheer top or 
dress without the distraction of the wrong undergarment. When you wear 
white underneath something sheer, the white is all you see (see Figure 17-4). 
This is especially true if you’re somewhere where you may be photographed — 
such as a wedding. The flash of the camera will pick up the white undergar­
ment, making it even more noticeable in the picture than it is in real life.

298
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Figure 17-4: White undergarments under sheer tops can be distracting.
Wearing All Denim
I love denim. Jeans are a great staple in most everyone’s wardrobe. A jean 
jacket is the perfect complement to white pants, khakis, or a cute dress. 
Still, don’t wear jeans and a denim jacket together as an outfit. The look 
is straight out of the 1980s and is too matchy-matchy. With so many mix 
and match options for jeans and jean jackets, pair denim with pretty much 
anything other than more denim. (For more on how to wear denim, see 
Chapter 5.)
Showing Your Bra Straps 
Your bra straps should never be showing. If you’re wearing a spaghetti strap 
dress, opt for a strapless bra. If you’re wearing a racerback tank top, go for 
a racerback bra. Letting your straps show takes away from your outfit, and 

299
 Chapter 17: Ten Fashion Faux Pas and How to Avoid Them
your bra straps are often the first thing people notice (see Figure 17-5). You 
can find convertible bras in all different sizes and with all different levels of 
support. (Head to Chapter 14 for more on undergarments.)
	
Many bra companies have begun to make fashionable bra straps that are 
meant to be shown. This look is very casual and therefore inappropriate for 
work and many other occasions. Exercise caution with fashionable straps, and 
remember, a cleaner look is always safe and stylish.
Figure 17-5: Keep your bra straps hidden.
Wearing Clothing That’s Too Tight
Clothing is unflattering when it’s too tight. I know, I know — you love that 
top and you must have it. Unfortunately, the only size you can find is a size 
smaller than you wear. What do you do? You put the garment down and walk 
away! We’ve all bought the top we had to have knowing it was too small. But 
no matter how fab the top, if you have to squeeze yourself into it, it’s a total 

300
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
no. Walking around in clothing that’s too tight is not only uncomfortable; it’s 
also unfashionable (see Figure 17-6). You don’t want to be the woman in a 
fabulous outfit that’s too small.

Ten Ways to Go From Day to Night 
in a Flash
In This Chapter
▶	Leaving the house in the morning ready for work and play
▶	Transformers aren’t just toys
▶	Turning day into night with accessories
W
hether you’re heading to a planned event or a last-minute soiree, you 
want to look your best, even when you don’t have the time you’d like 
to primp and polish. No worries. In this chapter, I give you ten ways to trans­
form your look from day to night. With these tips, you’ll look like you spent 
hours digging through your closet to find the perfect outfit!
From Simple to Sizzling
If you know you’re going out after work, slip on a 
simple black dress in the morning with whatever 
shoes are office-appropriate. Take along some jew­
elry, a clutch, and a pair of dressy sandals. When 
your work day is done, all you need to do to totally 
transform your look is put on the jewelry (the 
right amount of bling can spice up that little black 
dress), trade in your day bag for the clutch, and 
don your dressy sandals (see Figure 18-1). In no time 
flat, you have a whole new look!

302
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Figure 18-1: The little black dress takes you from day to night in a flash.
A Silky Transformation
Simply by changing the way you wear a silk scarf, you can change your whole 
look. All it takes is a little creativity, a few seconds, and the right scarf (a 
36-inch square works, or if you want more coverage, go bigger). During the 
day, tie the scarf around your neck and pair it with a suit and tank. At night, 
take the scarf off your neck, remove the tank and suit jacket, and tie the scarf 
as a halter top (see Figure 18-2). Chapter 15 explains how to turn a scarf into 
a halter. Who knew a simple scarf could take you so far?

Figure 18-2: A little creativity with a scarf gives you 
a new look almost instantly.
Cubicle to Cocktails
If you’re going out after work, there’s no need to pack an extra outfit. Simply 
wear a suit. Underneath, put on a sexy tank that barely shows when the 
jacket is closed (see Figure 18-3). When you’re ready to go meet your friends 
for cocktails, take off your jacket and you’ll be ready for that cosmo!

304
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Figure 18-3: Less can be more when dressing up 
for an evening out.
A Shirt to Take You Anywhere
A white button-down shirt is suitable for almost any occasion. During the 
day, pair it with jeans. At night, put it with a dressier skirt or slacks. Add a 
bold necklace or chandelier earrings for a little pop (see Figure 18-4). The 
look is not only sophisticated, but understated and sexy as well!

305
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Go From Day to Night in a Flash
Figure 18-4: Trade in your slacks for a dressy skirt when going out on the town!
Tote to Clutch
If you’re heading to a party after work, don’t let your bag be the sign that 
you didn’t have time to run home and change. An overflowing tote is never 
stylish. To avoid this dilemma, throw a clutch in your purse (pack some mini-
makeup in your evening bag, too). That way when you’re running out of the 
office for your fabulous plans, you’ll look chic from head to toe!
Accessorize, Accessorize!
Never underestimate the power of accessories. If you’re in a simple dress during 
the day and want to dress it up for dinner, you don’t need to change your outfit; 

306
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
you can simply change your accessories. Pick two pieces to make your outfit 
pop (shoes don’t count!). Choose a bracelet and earrings, a necklace and state­
ment ring, or a pair of earrings and a belt (as pictured in Figure 18-5). Any such 
combo will do the trick. Have fun with your choices, and don’t be afraid to mix 
metals. The only caveat? Don’t overdo it. (See Chapter 15 for details on how to 
avoid over-accessorizing.)
Figure 18-5: The right accessories can dress up any outfit.
Shoulder Bag to Clutch
Invest in a bag that has a chain or strap you can take off or tuck inside. If you’re 
shopping during the day and want to be “hands-free,” you can use the strap. At 
night, when you just want to wear a clutch, you can tuck the strap inside the 

307
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Go From Day to Night in a Flash
bag and voila! Most major department stores carry these types of bags. With 
most chain-strap bags you can tuck in the strap. Look around and find one you 
can wear with many different outfits; it’s a great staple for any wardrobe.
Day Casual to Dinner Chic
A simple sweater set is a great staple. Paired with a pair of slacks, it’s always 
classic and clean — a great look for the office. Dress it up for night by taking 
the cardigan off, tying it around your neck, and pairing it with a fun skirt, san­
dals, a clutch, and accessories (see Figure 18-6). Now you’re ready to dance 
the night away in style! 
Figure 18-6: Maybe you never thought you could use a sweater 
as an accessory, but you can.

308
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
It’s a Wrap!
You can wrap many dresses in different ways to get different looks. American 
Apparel makes a great and inexpensive one that’s very easy to figure out and 
experiment with. Don’t be afraid to come up with your own way to wrap a 
versatile dress…whatever works best on your body works! Here’s an exam­
ple: For daytime, wrap the two straps of the dress around your waist and tie 
a knot in the back (I wear this look all the time). Pair with a T-shirt and cardi­
gan and you’re ready to shop the day away! For nighttime, tie the two straps 
around your neck to make a halter dress (see Figure 18-7). Get out those 
fab new earrings you’ve wanted to wear and a pair of high heels, and you’re 
ready to dance into the night! 
Figure 18-7: Tie the garment as a skirt or a dress depending on 
where you’re heading!

Best Foot Forward
Higher heels are sexy and great for nighttime, but few women can walk 
around in them comfortably all day. You could bring another pair of 
shoes with you, but there’s another solution: Camileon Heels, shoes 
that, with a simple move, have a heel that goes from low to high in a 
flash (see Figure 18-8). And they look nice, too! To buy a pair, go to

Ten Great Fashion Web Sites
In This Chapter
▶	Tapping into fashion knowledge
▶	Finding sample sales and other great bargains
▶	Accessing world-class stylists
T
he World Wide Web is just that when it comes to fashion: a world wide 
resource that lets you explore the entire world of fashion without having 
to leave your house. Through the Web, you can learn about the hottest 
designers, buy clothes and accessories for the best prices, and find the help 
you need to become as fashionable as possible. This chapter lists ten of my 
favorite sites to check out, but remember: The Web is ever-changing, so be 
sure to explore all the possibilities it has to offer.
www.style.com
Vogue has long been the leader of the pack as far as 
what’s hot in the fashion world, and this is the maga­
zine’s Web site. It’s one of the top resources when 
you want to find out about upcoming trends and 
up-and-coming designers. Not only can you find the 
latest info from the magazine here, but you can see 
all the fashion runway shows from the American 
and European collections. If you’re curious what 
your favorite designer is showing for the upcoming 
season, or you just want to browse around to see 
what’s current, log on to www.style.com.

312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
www.usmagazine.com
If you want to check out the latest trends and see what celebrities are wear­
ing, Us Weekly has you covered. You can check out what stars are wearing 
when they’re shopping and on the red carpet. You can see how your favorite 
celeb takes the looks of her favorite designers and makes them her own. Us 
not only has pictures of all the celebs in the most current fashions, but it 
also tells you where the celebs shop so that you can check out their favorite 
stores, too. In addition to celeb photos, Us has a few fashion pages with the 
latest pieces and Web site links telling you where to find them.
www.hautelook.com
Hautelook.com has great sample sales. When designers (including high-end 
designers!) produce too much merchandise and have leftover stock at the 
end of the season, they have sample sales. These sales unload merchandise 
at a discount because they won’t be able to sell it again next season. A variety 
of sizes and styles are usually available, but it’s first-come, first-served — so 
you have to be quick when you hear about a sale.
After you register (don’t worry — registration is free), you receive e-mails 
about upcoming sales. The sales last for 24 to 48 hours and feature great 
designers for bargain prices. So for all you fashionistas who think you can’t 
afford that piece you’re coveting, keep an eye out for sample sales: You never 
know what will end up here! For more information on sample sales and how 
they work, go to Chapter 7.
www.gilt.com
Another great site for sample sales (refer to the preceding section), gilt.
com is the place to go if you want access to designer creations for less. 
Because both Web sites have access to different designers’ merchandise, 
it’s worth registering at both so you don’t miss out on anything. Again, 
­registration is free. What great bargains!

313
 Chapter 19: Ten Great Fashion Web Sites
www.priorities.com 
This Web site lets you access the hottest looks for less. I love this line 
because it specializes in winter coats and stylish jackets, which can often be 
hard to find (especially at reasonable prices). You can order and have your 
items shipped. The site offers a full refund policy, so don’t worry about sizing 
problems. You can return!
www.jennifermillerjewelry.com
I’ve mentioned this site numerous times throughout the book. It’s my go-to 
Web site when looking to make an outfit complete with accessories. You can 
find great pieces for under $100; every time I wear something from them, I’m 
the talk of the party. This site really allows you to look like a million bucks 
without spending it. The gold big hoop earrings I’m wearing on the back 
cover of the book are from jennifermillerjewelry.com, and they’re 
always my go-to party earrings.
www.michellejonas.com
Michelle Jonas Designs has everything from dresses to shorts, and each item 
is perfect for travel. Every piece goes from day to night and folds up easily to 
fit in your suitcase. All the items are very reasonably priced, and believe me, 
not only will you live in these pieces when you’re traveling, but you won’t 
want to take them off when you’re back home, either! If you prefer to try 
things on, check out the Web site for the address of a store near you.
www.25park.com
The mission of 25Park is to provide designer merchandise that consumers 
can’t find easily in stores. 25Park offers a “quick-guide,” designed to give 
customers suggestions on what to wear to special occasions. It also donates 
a portion of each sale to a different charity each month and ships items in 
recycled packaging.

www.dailycandy.com
DailyCandy is a guilty pleasure — without the guilt! This site runs the gamut 
from fashion to beauty to food and culture. Just log on to access all the site’s 
areas. Click on “Fashion” to see the newest and latest in the fashion world. 
You’ll find highlights of the newest designers, Web sites, boutiques, and 
anything else to do with fashion. You can also browse the site by city, to see 
what’s new in your area. Because almost everything listed links to its own 
Web site, you don’t have to live in one of the major U.S. cities to take advan­
tage of all dailycandy.com has to offer.
www.fordmodels.com/fordartists
If you’re looking to hire a professional stylist, this Web site is a great place 
to start. These experienced, professional stylists work on photo shoots, 
commercials, and TV. They have online portfolios you can browse, and the 
agency has offices throughout the country. So if you live near one of the 
major cities, you can hire a stylist locally. If you don’t live near a major U.S. 
city, the stylists travel as well (expect higher fees if travel is involved).
