Introduction
W
hen I open an annual financial report today, one of the first things 
I ask myself is, “Can I believe the numbers that I’m seeing?” I never 
used to think that way. I used to think that any corporate financial report 
audited by a certified public accountant truly was prepared with the public’s 
interests in mind.
The financial scandals of the late 1990s and early 2000s destroyed my confi-
dence in those numbers, as they did for millions of other U.S. investors who 
lost billions in the stock-market crash that followed those scandals. Sure, a 
stock bubble (a period of rising stock prices that stems from a buying frenzy) 
had burst, but financial reports that hid companies’ financial problems fueled 
the bubble and helped companies put on a bright, smiling face for the public. 
After these financial reporting scandals came to light, more than 500 public 
companies had to restate their earnings. Yet, in almost a repeat of the scan-
dals, the mortgage mess of 2007 showed how financial institutions were still 
using the same tricks of keeping key financial information off the books to 
hide financial troubles.
I still wonder what government regulators and public accountants were 
thinking and doing during these fiascos. How did the system break down so 
dramatically and so quickly? Although a few voices raised red flags, their 
pleas were drowned out by the euphoria of the building stock-market bubble 
of the early 1990s and the housing-market bubble of the mid-2000s.
These financial scandals occurred partly because Wall Street measures 
success based on a company’s quarterly results. Many on Wall Street are 
more concerned about whether a company meets its quarterly expectations 
than they are about a company’s long-term prospects for future growth. 
Companies that fail to meet their quarterly expectations find their stock 
quickly beaten down on the market. To avoid the fall, companies massage 
their numbers. This shortsighted race to meet the numbers each quarter is a 
big reason why these scandals happen in the first place.
Since the scandals broke, legislators have enacted new laws and regulations 
to attempt to correct the problems. In this book, I discuss these new regula-
tions and show you how to read financial reports with an ounce of skepticism 
and a set of tools that can help you determine whether the numbers make 
sense. I help you see how companies can play games with their numbers and 
show you how to analyze the numbers in a financial report so you can deter-
mine a company’s true financial health.

About This Book
This book provides detailed information on how to read a financial report’s 
key statements — the balance sheet, the income statement, and the state-
ment of cash flows — as well as how to discover and scour a report’s other 
important parts.
When you finish reading this book, you’ll understand what makes up the 
parts of financial statements and how to read between their lines, using the 
fine print to increase your understanding of a company’s financial position. 
You’ll also be familiar with the company outsiders who are responsible for 
certifying the accuracy of financial reports, and you’ll know how the rules 
have changed since the corporate scandals broke. Although I can’t prom-
ise that you’ll be able to detect every type of fraud, I can promise that your 
antennae will be up and you’ll be more aware of how to spot possible prob-
lems. And most important, you’ll get a good understanding of how to use 
these reports to make informed decisions about whether a company is a 
sound investment. If you work inside a company, you’ll have a better under-
standing of how to use the reports to manage your company or your depart-
ment for success.
Conventions Used in This Book
I use the words “corporation” and “company” almost interchangeably. Just 
so we’re on the same page, all corporations are companies, but not all com-
panies are corporations. The key difference between them is whether a com-
pany has gone through incorporation, which is the rather complicated legal 
process by which a company gets a state charter to operate as a business. To 
find out more about company structure and incorporation, see Chapter 2.
To help you practice the tools I show you in this book, I use the annual 
reports of the two largest toy companies, Mattel and Hasbro, and dissect 
their reports throughout various chapters. You can download a full copy of 
the reports by visiting the investor-relations section of the companies’ Web 
sites: www.hasbro.com and www.mattel.com.
What You’re Not to Read
Many of the topics I discuss in this book are, by nature, technical — dealing 
with finances can hardly be otherwise. But in some cases, I provide details 
that offer more than the basic stuff you need to know to understand the big

 Introduction
picture. Because these explanations may not be up your alley, I mark them 
with a Technical Stuff icon (see the upcoming section “Icons Used in This 
Book”) and invite you to skip them without even the slightest regret. Even if 
you skip them, you still get all the information you need. On the other hand, 
if you savor every financial detail or fancy yourself the bravest of all financial 
report readers, then dig in!
I’ve also added some sidebars to give you more detail about a topic or some 
financial history. You can skip those, too, and still be able to understand how 
to read financial reports.
Foolish Assumptions
To write this book, I made some basic assumptions about who you are. I 
assume that you
 
✓ Want to know more about the information in financial reports and how 
you can use it.
 
✓ Want to know the basics of financial reporting.
 
✓ Need to gather some analytical tools to more effectively use financial 
reports for your own investing or career goals.
 
✓ Need a better understanding of the financial reports you receive from 
the company you work for to analyze the results of your department or 
division.
 
✓ Want to get a better handle on what goes into financial reports, how 
they’re developed, and how to use the information to measure the finan-
cial success of your own company.
Both investors and company insiders who aren’t familiar with the ins and 
outs of financial reports can benefit from the information and tools I include 
in this book.
How This Book Is Organized
I organize this book into six parts. After introducing the basics, I carefully dis-
sect what goes into financial reports, giving you the tools you need to analyze 
those reports. I introduce you to the company outsiders who are involved in 
the financial reporting process and show you how to find red flags that may 
indicate deceptive or fraudulent reporting.

Reading Financial Reports For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Part I: Getting Down to Financial 
Reporting Basics
Part I discusses the basics of accounting and financial reporting. If you need 
an introduction to these basics or just a simple refresher course, you may 
want to begin here. In this part, you find information about the types of busi-
ness structures, the differences between public and private corporations, 
and the accounting basics necessary to understand financial reports.
Part II: Checking Out the Big 
Show: Annual Reports
This part introduces you to the key elements of an annual financial report. 
The first chapter reviews the main sections of an annual report; the chapters 
that follow focus on each of these sections individually, explaining what you 
find in a financial report and how to use that information. Another chapter 
explains in more detail what you can expect to find in the notes to the finan-
cial statements and what all that drivel means. In the last chapter of this part, 
I discuss consolidated statements and the information that goes into them.
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers
In this part, I give you the tools you need to analyze the numbers in financial 
statements. I show you how to test profitability, liquidity, and cash flow (see 
Chapters 11, 12, and 13 for details on these topics). These tools help you 
determine whether a company is a good investment.
Part IV: Understanding How Companies 
Optimize Operations
This part focuses on using financial statements to measure how efficiently 
management is using its resources. I review the basics of budgeting and how 
to use financial reports in the budgeting process. You also find tools for test-
ing how efficiently companies manage their assets and keep cash flowing.

 Introduction
Part V: The Many Ways Companies 
Answer to Others
In this part, I focus on the outsiders involved in the financial reporting pro-
cess. I review the accounting rules and the role of auditors, and I also discuss 
the key reports the government requires of all public companies. Then I 
introduce you to the push toward global financial reporting standards. Next, 
I look at the role analysts play in the world of financial reporting. I also talk 
about shareholders and what they should expect from the companies they 
invest in. And in the last chapter, I discuss how some companies massage the 
numbers when they compile their financial reports.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In the Part of Tens, I give you a quick reference list pointing out the top ten 
signs that a company is in financial trouble. I also outline some of the juicier 
financial reporting scandals of the past several years.
Finally, because much of the language of financial reporting may be new to 
you, I include a glossary at the end of the book.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the book, I use icons to flag parts of the text that you’ll want to 
notice. Here’s a list of the icons and what they mean.
 
This icon points out ideas for improving your financial report reading skills 
and directs you to some useful financial resources.
 
This icon highlights information you definitely want to remember.
 
This icon points out a critical piece of information that can help you find 
the dangers and perils in financial reports. I also use this icon to emphasize 
information you definitely don’t want to skip or skim when reading a financial 
report.

Reading Financial Reports For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
This icon highlights information that may explain the numbers in more detail 
than you care to know. Don’t worry; you can skip these points without missing 
the big picture!
 Throughout the book, I give examples from financial reports of real compa-
nies, particularly Mattel and Hasbro. I highlight these examples with the icon 
you see here.
Where to Go from Here
You can start reading anywhere in this book, but if you’re totally new to 
financial reports, you should definitely start with Part I so you can get a 
good handle on the basics before delving into the financial information. If 
you already know the basics, turn to Part II to begin dissecting the parts of 
a financial report. And to get started on the road to analyzing the numbers, 
turn to Part III. If your priority is tools for optimizing company operation, you 
may want to begin with Part IV. Those of you who want to know more about 
company outsiders involved in the financial reporting process may want to 
start at Part V.

f you’re a complete novice to the world of financial 
reports, this part gives you the background you need 
to understand this complex world, which has a language 
and rules all its own. In this part, I discuss the key types of 
financial reports, both internal and external, as well as 
what you should expect to find in those reports. I also 
explore different types of business structures and talk 
about the differences between a public and private com-
pany. Finally, I review the accounting basics you need to 
understand in order to read financial reports.

In This Chapter
▶ Reviewing the importance of financial reports
▶ Exploring the different types of financial reporting
▶ Discovering the key financial statements
F
inancial reports give a snapshot of a company’s value at the end of a 
particular period, as well as a view of the company’s operations and 
whether it made a profit. The business world couldn’t function without 
financial reports. Yes, fewer scandals would be exposed because companies 
wouldn’t be tempted to paint false but pretty financial pictures, but you’d 
still need a way to gauge a firm’s financial health.
At this point in time, nothing’s available that can possibly replace financial 
reports. Nothing can be substituted that’d give investors, financial institu-
tions, and government agencies the information they need to make decisions 
about a company. And without financial reports, the folks who work for a 
company wouldn’t know how to make it more efficient and profitable because 
they wouldn’t have a summary of its financial activities during previous busi-
ness periods. These financial summaries help companies look at their suc-
cesses and failures and help them make plans for future improvements.
This chapter introduces you to the many facets of financial reports and how 
internal and external players use them to evaluate a company’s financial 
health.
Figuring Out Financial Reporting
Financial reporting gives readers a summary of what happens in a company 
based purely on the numbers. The numbers that tell the tale include the 
following:

10
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
 
✓ Assets: The cash, marketable securities, buildings, land, tools, equip-
ment, vehicles, copyrights, patents, and any other items needed to run a 
business that a company holds.
 
✓ Liabilities: Money a company owes to outsiders, such as loans, bonds, 
and unpaid bills.
 
✓ Equity: Money invested in the company.
 
✓ Sales: Products or services that customers purchase.
 
✓ Costs and expenses: Money spent to operate a business, such as expen-
ditures for production, compensation for employees, operation of build-
ings and factories, or supplies to run the offices.
 
✓ Profit or loss: The amount of money a company earns or loses.
 
✓ Cash flow: The amount of money that flows into and out of a business 
during the time period being reported.
 
Without financial reporting, you’d have no idea where a company stands 
financially. Sure, you’d know how much money the business has in its bank 
accounts, but you wouldn’t know how much is still due to come in from cus-
tomers, how much inventory is being held in the warehouse and on the shelf, 
how much the firm owes, or even how much the firm owns. As an investor, if 
you don’t know these details, you can’t possibly make an objective decision 
about whether the company is making money and whether it’s worth investing 
in the company’s future.
Preparing the reports
A company’s accounting department is the key source of its financial reports. 
This department is responsible for monitoring the numbers and putting 
together the reports. The numbers are the products of a process called 
double-entry accounting, which requires a company to record resources and 
the assets it uses to get those resources. For example, if you buy a chair, 
you must spend another asset, such as cash. An entry in the double-entry 
accounting system shows both sides of that transaction — the cash account 
is reduced by the chair’s price, and the furniture account value is increased 
by the chair’s price.
This crucial method of accounting gives companies the ability to record and 
track business activity in a standardized way. Accounting methods are con-
stantly updated to reflect the business environment as financial transactions 
become more complex. To find out more about double-entry accounting, turn 
to Chapter 4.

 Chapter 1: Opening the Cornucopia of Reports
Why financial reporting counts 
(and who’s counting)
Many people count on the information companies present in financial 
reports. Here are some key groups of readers and why they need accurate 
information:
 
✓ Executives and managers: They need information to know how well 
the company is doing financially and to find out about problem areas so 
they can make changes to improve the company’s performance.
 
✓ Employees: They need to know how well they’re meeting or exceeding 
their goals and where they need to improve. For example, if a salesper-
son has to make $50,000 in sales during the month, he needs a financial 
report at the end of the month to gauge how well he did in meeting that 
goal. If he believes that he met his goal but the financial report doesn’t 
show that he did, he’d have to provide details to defend his production 
levels. Most salespeople are paid according to their sales production. 
Without financial reports, they’d have no idea what their compensation 
is based on.
 
 Employees also make career and retirement-investment decisions based 
on the company’s financial reports. If the reports are misleading or false, 
employees could lose most, if not all, of their 401(k) retirement savings, 
and their long-term financial futures could be at risk.
 
✓ Creditors: They need to understand a company’s financial results to 
determine whether they should risk lending more money to the com-
pany and to find out whether the firm is meeting the minimum require-
ments of any loan programs that are already in place. To find out how 
creditors gauge whether a business meets their requirements, see 
Chapters 9 and 12.
 
 If a firm’s financial reports are false or misleading, creditors may loan 
money at an interest rate that doesn’t truly reflect the risks they’re 
taking. And by trusting the misleading information, they may miss out 
on a better opportunity.
 
✓ Investors: They need information to judge whether a company is a 
good investment. If investors think that a company is on a growth path 
because of the financial information it reports but those reports turn out 
to be false, investors can pay, big time. They may buy stock at inflated 
prices and risk the loss of capital as the truth comes out, or miss out on 
better investing opportunities.
 
✓ Government agencies: These agencies need to be sure that companies 
comply with regulations set at the state and federal levels. They also 
need to be certain that companies accurately inform the public about 
their financial position.

12
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
 
✓ Analysts: They need information to develop analytical reviews for cli-
ents who are considering the company for investments or additional 
loan funds.
 
✓ Financial reporters: They need to provide accurate coverage of a 
company’s operations to the general public, which helps make inves-
tors aware of the critical financial issues facing the company and any 
changes the company makes in its operations.
 
✓ Competitors: Every company’s bigwigs read their competitors’ financial 
reports. If these reports are based on false numbers, the financial play-
ing field gets distorted. A well-run company could make a bad decision 
to keep up with the false numbers of a competitor and end up reducing 
its own profitability.
Companies don’t produce financial reports only for public consumption. 
Many financial reports are prepared for internal use only. These internal 
reports help managers
 
✓ Find out which of the business’s operations are producing a profit and 
which are operating at a loss.
 
✓ Determine which departments or divisions should receive additional 
resources to encourage growth.
 
✓ Identify unsuccessful departments or divisions and make needed 
changes to turn the troubled section around or kill the project.
 
✓ Determine staffing and inventory levels needed to respond to customer 
demand.
 
✓ Review customer accounts to identify slow-paying or nonpaying custom-
ers in order to devise collection methods and to develop guidelines for 
when a customer should be cut off from future orders.
 
✓ Prepare production schedules and review production levels.
These are just a few of the many uses companies have for their internal 
financial reports. The list is endless and is limited only by the imagination of 
the executives and managers who want to find ways to use the numbers to 
make business decisions. I talk more about using internal reports to optimize 
results in Chapters 14, 15, and 16.
Checking Out Types of Reporting
Not every company needs to prepare financial statements, but any company 
seeking to raise cash through stock sales or by borrowing funds certainly does. 
How public these statements must be depends on the business’s structure.

13
 Chapter 1: Opening the Cornucopia of Reports
Most businesses are private companies, which share these statements only 
with a small group of stakeholders: managers, investors, suppliers, vendors, 
and the financial institutions that they do business with. As long as a com-
pany doesn’t sell shares of stock to the general public, it doesn’t have to 
make its financial statements public. I talk more about the reporting rules for 
private companies in Chapter 2.
 
Public companies, which sell stock on the open market, must file a series of 
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) each year if they 
have at least 500 investors or at least $10 million in assets. Smaller compa-
nies that have incorporated and sold stock must report to the state in which 
they incorporated, but they aren’t required to file with the SEC. You can find 
more details about the SEC’s reporting requirements for public companies in 
Chapters 3 and 19.
Even if a firm doesn’t need to make its financial reports public, if it wants 
to raise cash outside a very small circle of friends, it has to prepare finan-
cial statements and have a certified public accountant (CPA) audit them, or 
certify that the financial statements meet the requirements of the generally 
accepted accounting principles (or GAAP, which you can find out more about 
in the section “How the number crunchers are kept in line,” later in this chap-
ter). Few banks consider loaning large sums of money to businesses without 
audited financial statements. Investors who aren’t involved in the daily man-
agement of a business also usually require audited financial statements.
Keeping everyone informed
One big change in a company’s operations after it decides to publicly sell 
stock is that it must report publicly on both a quarterly and annual basis to 
its stockholders. Companies send these reports directly to their stockhold-
ers, to analysts, and to the major financial institutions that help fund 
their operations through loans or bonds. The reports often include glossy 
pictures and pleasingly designed graphics at the beginning, keeping the less 
eye-pleasing financial reports that meet the SEC’s requirements in the back.
Quarterly reports
Companies must release quarterly reports within 45 days after the quarter 
ends. Companies with holdings over $75 million must file more quickly. 
In addition to the three key financial statements — the balance sheet, the 
income statement, and the statement of cash flows (check out the upcoming 
section “The meat of the matter” for details on these documents) — the com-
pany must state whether a CPA has audited (see Chapter 18) or reviewed (a 
much less intensive look at the data) the numbers. A report reviewed rather 
than audited by a CPA holds less weight.

14
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
Annual reports
Most small companies must file their annual reports within 90 days of the end 
of their fiscal year. Companies with over $75 million in assets must file their 
reports within 60 days. The annual report includes the information presented 
in the quarterly reports and much more, including a full business description, 
details about the management team and its compensation, and details about 
any filings done during the year.
 
Most major companies put a lot of money into producing glossy reports 
filled with information and pictures designed to make a good impression on 
the public. The marketing or public relations department, rather than the 
financial or accounting department, writes much of the summary informa-
tion. Too often, annual reports are puff pieces that carefully hide any negative 
information in the notes to the financial statements, which is the section that 
offers additional details about the numbers provided in those statements (see 
Chapter 9). Read between the lines — especially the tiny print at the back of 
the report — to get some critical information about the accounting methods 
used, any pending lawsuits, or other information that may negatively impact 
results in the future.
Following the rules: Government 
requirements
Reports for the government are more extensive than the glossy reports sent 
to shareholders (see the preceding section). Companies must file many types 
of forms with the SEC, but I focus on only three of them in this book:
 
✓ The 10-K: This form is the annual report that provides a comprehensive 
overview of a company’s business and financial activities.
 
 Firms must file this report within 90 days after the end of the fiscal 
year (companies with more than $75 million in assets must file within 
60 days). In addition to the information included in the glossy annual 
reports sent to shareholders (see the preceding section), investors can 
find more detailed information about company history, organizational 
structure, equity holdings, subsidiaries, employee stock-purchase 
and savings plans, incorporation, legal proceedings, controls and pro-
cedures, executive compensation, accounting fees and services, and 
changes or disagreements with accountants about financial disclosures.
 
✓ The 10-Q: This form is the quarterly report that describes key financial 
information about the prior three months. Most companies must file this 
report within 45 days of the end of the quarter (firms with more than 
$75 million in assets must file within 40 days). In addition to the informa-
tion sent directly to shareholders, this form includes details about the 
company’s market risk, controls and procedures, legal proceedings, and 
defaults on payments.

15
 Chapter 1: Opening the Cornucopia of Reports
 
✓ The 8-K: This form is a periodic report that accounts for any major 
events that may impact a company’s financial position. Examples of 
major events include the acquisition of another company, the sale of 
a company or division, bankruptcy, the resignation of directors, or a 
change in the fiscal year. When a major event occurs, the company must 
file a report with the SEC within four days of the event.
 
You can access reports filed with the SEC online at Edgar, which is run by the 
SEC. To use Edgar, go to www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml.
Going global
More and more companies operate across country borders. For years, each 
country had its own set of rules for preparing financial reports to meet gov-
ernment regulations. Global companies had to keep separate sets of books 
and report results under different sets of rules in each country in which they 
operated.
By 2008, more than 100 countries agreed to accept the International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS; see Chapter 20) developed by the London-based 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Beginning in 2002, the U.S. 
agreed to look at ways to converge the IFRS and the U.S. GAAP (see Chapter 
18). The U.S. is on track to allow companies to file required reports using 
either U.S. GAAP or IFRS by 2011.
Staying within the walls of the 
company: Internal reporting
Not all an accounting department’s financial reporting is done for public 
consumption. In fact, companies usually produce many more internal reports 
than external ones to keep management informed. Firms can design their 
internal reports in whatever way makes sense to their operations.
Each department head usually receives a report from the top managers 
showing the department’s expenses and revenue and whether it’s meeting its 
budget. If the department’s numbers vary significantly from the amount that 
was budgeted, the report indicates red flags. The department head usually 
needs to investigate the differences and report what the department is doing 
to correct any problems. Even if the difference is increased revenue (which 
can be good news), the manager still needs to know why the difference 
exists, because an error in the data input could have occurred. I talk more 
about reports and budgeting in Chapter 14.

16
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
Reports on inventory are critical, not only for managing the products on 
hand but also for knowing when to order new inventory. I talk more about 
inventory controls and financial reporting in Chapter 15.
Tracking cash is vital to the day-to-day operations of any company. The fre-
quency of a company’s cash reporting depends on the volatility of its cash 
status — the more volatile the cash, the more likely the company needs 
frequent reporting to be sure that it has cash on hand to pay its bills. Some 
large firms actually provide cash reporting to their managers daily. I talk 
more about cash reporting in Chapters 16 and 17; Chapter 16 focuses on 
incoming cash, and Chapter 17 deals with outgoing cash.
Finding the roots of financial reporting
Accounting practices can be traced back to 
the Renaissance, but financial reporting wasn’t 
recognized as a necessity until centuries later.
 ✓ 1494: Italian monk Luca Pacioli became 
known as the “father of accounting” for 
his book Everything about Arithmetic, 
Geometry and Proportions, which includes 
a section on double-entry accounting (see 
Chapter 4). Pacioli warned his readers that 
an accountant shouldn’t go to sleep at night 
until his debits equal his credits.
 ✓ 1700–1800: For-profit corporations started 
to appear in Europe as early as the 18th 
century. In 1800, only about 330 corpora-
tions operated in the U.S.
 ✓ 1800s: As public ownership of stock 
increased, regulators realized that some 
standardized distribution of information 
to investors was a priority. The New York 
Stock Exchange was the first to jump into 
the fray, and in 1853, it began requiring 
companies listed on the exchange to pro-
vide statements of shares outstanding and 
capital resources.
 ✓ 1929: Before the stock market crash, 
equity investing became a passion. People 
borrowed money to get into the market, 
paying higher and higher prices for stock. 
Sound familiar? Not too different from what 
occurred just before the 2000 crash of tech-
nology and Internet stocks.
 ✓ 1933–1934: Congress created the SEC 
and gave it authority to develop financial 
accounting and reporting standards and 
rules that would deter companies from dis-
tributing misleading information.
 ✓ 1973: The Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (FASB) was created to establish 
standards for financial accounting and 
reporting. The SEC recognized the gener-
ally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) 
as the official reporting standards for fed-
eral securities laws.
 ✓ 1984: The FASB formed the Emerging Issues 
Task Force, which keeps an eye on changes 
in business operations and sets standards 
before new practices become entrenched.
 ✓ 2002: The FASB began work with the 
International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) to converge international financial 
reporting systems.

 Chapter 1: Opening the Cornucopia of Reports
Dissecting the Annual Report 
to Shareholders
The annual report gives more details about a company’s business and finan-
cial activities than any other report. This document is primarily for share-
holders, although any member of the general public can request a copy. 
Glossy pictures and graphics fill the front of the report, highlighting what the 
company wants you to know. After that, you find the full details about the 
company’s business and financial operations; most companies include the 
full 10-K that they file with the SEC.
Breaking down the parts
The annual report is broken into the following parts (I summarize the key 
points of each of these parts in Chapter 5):
 
✓ Highlights: These are a narrative summary of the previous year’s activi-
ties and general information about the company, its history, its prod-
ucts, and its business lines.
 
✓ Letter from the president or chief executive officer (CEO): This is a 
letter directed to the shareholders that discusses the company’s key 
successes or explains any major failures.
 
✓ Auditors’ report: This is a report that tells you whether the numbers 
are accurate or whether you should have any concerns about the future 
operation of the business.
 
✓ Management’s discussion and analysis: In this part, you find a manage-
ment discussion of the financial results and other factors that impact 
the company’s operations.
 
✓ Financial statements: The key financial statements are the balance 
sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. In the financial 
statements, you find the actual financial results for the year. For details 
about this part of the report, check out the following section, “The meat 
of the matter.”
 
✓ Notes to the financial statements: In the notes, you find details about 
how the numbers were derived. I talk more about the role of the notes in 
Chapter 9.
 
✓ Other information: In this part, you find information about the compa-
ny’s key executives and managers, officers, board members, locations, 
and new facilities that have opened in the past year.

Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
The meat of the matter
No doubt, the most critical part of the annual report for those who want to 
know how well a company did financially is the financial statements section, 
which includes the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement 
of cash flows.
The balance sheet
The balance sheet gives a snapshot of the company’s financial condition. On 
a balance sheet, you find assets, liabilities, and equity. The balance sheet got 
its name because the total assets must equal the total liabilities plus the total 
equities so that the value of the company is in balance. Here’s the equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Equities
Assets are shown on the left side of a balance sheet, and liabilities and equi-
ties are on the right side. Assets are broken down into current assets (hold-
ings that the company will use in the next 12 months, such as cash and 
savings) and long-term assets (holdings that the company will use longer than 
a 12-month period, such as buildings, land, and equipment).
Liabilities are broken down into current liabilities (payments on bills or debts 
that are due in the next 12 months) and long-term liabilities (payments on 
debt that are due after the next 12 months).
The equities portion of the balance sheet can be called owner’s equity (when 
an individual or partners closely hold a company) or shareholders’ equity 
(when shares of stock have been sold to raise cash). I talk more about what 
information goes into a balance sheet in Chapter 6.
The income statement
The income statement, also known as the profit and loss statement (P&L), gets 
the most attention from investors. This statement shows a summary of the 
financial activities of one quarter or an entire year. Many companies pre-
pare P&Ls on a monthly basis for internal use. Investors always focus on the 
exciting parts of the statement: revenue, net income, and earnings per share 
of stock.
In the income statement, you also find out how much the company is spend-
ing to produce or purchase the products or services it sells, how much the 
company costs to operate, how much it pays in interest, and how much it 
pays in income tax. To find out more about the information you can find on 
an income statement, go to Chapter 7.

19
 Chapter 1: Opening the Cornucopia of Reports
The statement of cash flows
The statement of cash flows is relatively new to the financial reporting game. 
The SEC didn’t require companies to file it with the other financial reports 
until 1988. Basically, the statement of cash flows is similar to the income 
statement in that it reports a company’s performance over time. But instead 
of focusing on profit or loss, it focuses on how cash flows through the busi-
ness. This statement has three sections: cash from operations, cash from 
investing, and cash from financing. I talk more about the statement of cash 
flows in Chapter 8.
How the number crunchers are kept in line
Every public company’s internal accounting team and external audit team 
must answer to government entities. The primary government entity respon-
sible for overseeing corporate reporting is the SEC. Reports filed with the SEC 
are reviewed by its staff. If SEC employees have any questions or want addi-
tional information, they notify the company after the reports are reviewed.
 
Financial statements filed with the SEC and for public consumption must 
adhere to the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). To meet the 
demands of these rules, financial reporting must be relevant, reliable, con-
sistent, and presented in a way that allows the report reader to compare the 
results to prior years, as well as to other companies’ financial results. To find 
out more about GAAP, turn to Chapter 18.
With GAAP in place, you may wonder why so many accounting scandals 
have hit the front pages of newspapers around the country for the past few 
years. Filing statements according to GAAP has become a game for many 
companies. Unfortunately, investors and regulators find that companies don’t 
always engage in transactions for the economic benefit of the sharehold-
ers but sometimes do so to make their reports look better and to meet the 
quarterly expectations of Wall Street. Many times, companies look financially 
stronger than they actually are. For example, as scandals have come to light, 
companies have been found to overstate income, equity, and cash flows 
while understating debt. I talk more about reporting problems in Chapter 23.

Chapter 2
Recognizing Business Types 
and Their Tax Rules
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring sole proprietorships
▶ Taking a look at partnerships
▶ Checking out limited liability companies
▶ Comparing different types of corporations
A
ll businesses need to prepare key financial statements, but some busi-
nesses can make less formal statements than others. The way a busi-
ness is legally organized greatly impacts the way it must report to the public 
and the depth of that reporting. For a small business, financial reporting 
is needed only to monitor the success or failure of operations. But as the 
business grows, and as more and more outsiders — such as investors and 
creditors — become involved, financial reporting becomes more formalized 
until the company reaches the point where audited financial statements are 
required.
Each business structure also follows a different set of rules about what finan-
cial information the business must file with state, local, and federal agencies. 
In this chapter, I review the basics about how each type of business structure 
is organized, how taxation differs, which forms must be filed, and what types 
of financial reports are required.
Flying Solo: Sole Proprietorships
The simplest business structure is the sole proprietorship — the IRS’s auto-
matic classification for any business started by an individual. Most new busi-
nesses with only one owner start out as sole proprietorships. Some never 
grow into anything larger. Others start adding partners and staff and may 

22
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics  
realize that incorporating is a wise decision for legal purposes. (Check out 
“Seeking Protection with Limited Liability Companies” and “Shielding Your 
Assets: S and C Corporations,” later in the chapter, to find out more about 
incorporating.)
To start a business as a sole proprietor, you don’t have to do anything offi-
cial like file government papers or register with the IRS. In fact, unless you 
formally incorporate — follow a process that makes the business a separate 
legal entity — the IRS considers the business a sole proprietorship. (I talk 
more about incorporation and the process of forming corporations in the 
upcoming section, “Shielding Your Assets: S and C Corporations.”)
 
The fact that the business isn’t a separate legal entity is the biggest risk of a 
sole proprietorship. All debts or claims against the business are filed against 
the sole proprietor’s personal property. If a sole proprietor is sued, insurance 
is his only form of protection against losing everything he owns.
Keeping taxes personal
Sole proprietorships aren’t taxable entities, and sole proprietors don’t have 
to fill out separate tax forms for their businesses. The only financial report-
ing sole proprietors must do is add a few forms about their business entity to 
their personal tax returns.
Most sole proprietors add Schedule C — a “Profit or Loss from Business” 
form — to their personal tax returns, but some choose an even simpler form 
called Schedule C-EZ, “Net Profit from Business.” In addition, a sole propri-
etor must pay both the employer and employee side of Social Security and 
Medicare taxes using Schedule SE, “Self-Employment Tax.” These taxes total 
15.3 percent of net business income, or the business income after all business 
expenses have been subtracted.
 
Sole proprietors in specialized businesses may have different IRS forms to fill 
out. Farmers use Schedule F, “Profit or Loss from Farming.” People who own 
rental real estate but don’t operate a real estate business use Schedule E, 
“Supplemental Income and Loss.”
Reviewing requirements for reporting
Financial reporting requirements don’t exist for a sole proprietor unless he 
seeks funding from outside sources, such as a bank loan or a loan from the 
U.S. Small Business Administration. When a business seeks outside funding, 
the funding source likely provides guidelines for how the business should 
present financial information.

23
 Chapter 2: Recognizing Business Types and Their Tax Rules
When sole proprietors apply for a business loan, they fill out a form that 
shows their assets and liabilities. In addition, they’re usually required to pro-
vide a basic profit and loss statement. Depending on the size of the loan, they 
may even have to submit a formal business plan stating their goals, objec-
tives, and implementation plans.
 
Even though financial reports aren’t required for a sole proprietorship that 
isn’t seeking outside funding, it makes good business sense to complete peri-
odic profit and loss statements to keep tabs on how well the business is doing 
and to find any problems before they become too huge to fix. These reports 
don’t have to adhere to formal generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP; see Chapter 18), but honesty is the best policy. You’re only fooling 
yourself if you decide to make your financial condition look better on paper 
than it really is.
Joining Forces: Partnerships
The IRS automatically considers any business started by more than one 
person a partnership. Each person in the partnership is equally liable for the 
activities of the business, but because more than one person is involved, a 
partnership is a slightly more complicated company type than a sole propri-
etorship. Partners have to sort out the following legal issues:
 
✓ How they divide profits
 
✓ How they can sell the business
 
✓ What happens if one of the partners becomes sick or dies
 
✓ How they dissolve the partnership if one of the partners wants out
Because of the number of options, a partnership is the most flexible business 
structure for a business that involves more than one person. But to avoid 
future problems that can destroy an otherwise successful business, partners 
should decide on all these issues before opening their business’s doors.
Partnering up on taxes
Partnerships aren’t taxable entities, but partners do have to file a “U.S. 
Return of Partnership Income” using IRS Form 1065. This form, which shows 
income, deductions, and other tax-related business data, is for informa-
tion purposes only. It lists each partner’s share of taxable income, called a 
Schedule K-1, “Partner’s Share of Income, Credits, Deductions, etc.” Each indi-
vidual partner must report that income on his personal tax return.

24
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics  
Meeting reporting requirements
Unless a partnership seeks outside funding, its financial reports don’t have 
to be presented in any special way because the reports don’t have to satisfy 
anyone but the partners. Partnerships do need reports to monitor the suc-
cess or failure of business operations, but they don’t have to be completed to 
meet GAAP standards (see Chapter 18). Usually, when more than one person 
is involved, the partners decide among themselves what type of financial 
reporting is required and who’s responsible for preparing those reports.
Seeking Protection with Limited 
Liability Companies
A partnership or sole proprietorship can limit its liability by using an entity 
called a limited liability company, or LLC. First established in the U.S. about 20 
years ago, LLCs didn’t become popular until the mid-1990s, when most states 
approved them.
This business form actually falls somewhere between a corporation and a 
partnership or sole proprietorship in terms of protection by the law. Because 
LLCs are actually state entities, any legal protections offered to the owners of 
an LLC are dependent on the laws of the state where it’s established. In most 
states, LLC owners get the same legal protection from lawsuits as the federal 
law provides to corporations, but unlike the federal laws, these protections 
haven’t been tested fully in the state courts.
Reporting requirements for LLCs aren’t as strict as they are for a corporation, 
but many partnerships do decide to have their books audited to satisfy all 
the partners that the financial information is being kept accurately and within 
internal control procedures determined by the partners.
Taking stock of taxes
LLCs let sole proprietorships and partnerships have their cake and eat it, 
too: They get the same legal protection from liability as a corporation but 
don’t have to pay corporate taxes or file all the forms required of a corpo-
ration. In fact, the IRS treats LLCs as partnerships or sole proprietorships 
unless they ask to be taxed as corporations by using Form 8832, “Entity 
Classification Election.”

25
 Chapter 2: Recognizing Business Types and Their Tax Rules
Reviewing reporting requirements
The issues of business formation and business reporting are essentially 
the same for a partnership and a sole proprietorship, whether the entity 
files as an LLC or not. To shield themselves from liability, many large legal 
and accounting firms file as LLCs rather than take the more formal route of 
incorporating. When LLCs seek outside funding, either by selling shares of 
ownership or seeking loans, the IRS requires their financial reporting to be 
more formal.
Shielding Your Assets: 
S and C Corporations
Company owners seeking the greatest level of protection may choose to 
incorporate their businesses. The courts have clearly determined that cor-
porations are separate legal entities, and their owners are protected from 
claims filed against the corporation’s activities. An owner (shareholder) in a 
corporation can’t get sued or face collections because of actions taken by the 
corporation.
The veil of protection makes a powerful case in favor of incorporating. 
However, the obligations that come with incorporating are tremendous, and 
a corporation needs significant resources to pay for the required legal and 
accounting services. Many businesses don’t incorporate and choose instead 
to stay unincorporated or to organize as an LLC to avoid these additional 
costs.
 
Before incorporating, the first thing a business must do is form a board of 
directors, even if that means including spouses and children on the board. 
(Imagine what those family board meetings are like!)
Boards can be made up of both corporation owners and non-owners. Any 
board member who isn’t an owner can be paid for his service on the board.
Before incorporating, a company must also divvy up ownership in the form 
of stock. Most small businesses don’t trade their stock on an open exchange. 
Instead, they sell it privately among friends and investors.
Corporations are separate tax entities, so they must file tax returns and pay 
taxes or find ways to avoid them by using deductions. Two types of corpo-
rate structures exist:

26
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics  
 
✓ S corporations: These have fewer than 100 shareholders and function 
like partnerships but give owners additional legal protection.
 
✓ C corporations: These are separate legal entities formed for the purpose 
of operating a business. They’re actually treated in the courts as individ-
ual entities, just like people. Incorporation allows owners to limit their 
liability from the corporation’s actions. Owners must split their owner-
ship by using shares of stock, which is a requirement specified as part of 
corporate law. As an investor, you’re most likely to be a shareholder in a 
C corporation.
Paying taxes the corporate way
If a company organizes as an S corporation, it can actually avoid corporate 
taxation but still keep its legal protection. S corporations are essentially 
treated as partnerships for tax purposes, with profits and losses passed 
through to the shareholders, who then report the income or loss on their 
personal tax returns.
The biggest disadvantage of the S corporation is the way profits and losses 
are distributed. Although a partnership has a lot of flexibility in divvying 
up profits and losses among the partners, S corporations must divide them 
based on the amount of stock each shareholder owns. This structure can be 
a big problem if one of the owners has primarily given cash and bought stock 
while another owner is primarily responsible for day-to-day business opera-
tions. Because the owner responsible for operations didn’t purchase stock, 
he isn’t eligible for the profits unless he receives stock ownership as part of 
his contract with the company.
 
Only relatively small businesses can avoid taxation as a corporation. 
After a corporation has more than 100 shareholders, it loses its status as 
an S corporation. In addition, only U.S. residents can hold S corporation 
stock. Nonresident aliens (that is, citizens of another country) and nonhu-
man entities (such as other corporations or partnerships) don’t qualify 
as owners. Some tax-exempt organizations, however — including pension 
plans, profit-sharing plans, and stock bonus plans — can be shareholders in 
an S corporation.
One big disadvantage of the C corporation is that its profits are taxed twice — 
once through the corporate entity and once as dividends paid to its owners. A 
C corporation owner can get his profits only through dividends, but owners 
of C corporations can pay themselves a salary.
 
Unlike S corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships, which pass any 
profits and losses to their owners, who then report them on their personal 
income tax forms, C corporations must file their own tax forms and pay taxes 
on any profits.

27
 Chapter 2: Recognizing Business Types and Their Tax Rules
Getting familiar with reporting 
requirements
A company must meet several requirements to keep its corporate veil of pro-
tection in place. For example, corporations must hold board meetings, and 
the minutes from those meetings detail the actions the company must take to 
prove it’s operating as a corporation. The actions that must be shown in the 
minutes include:
 
✓ Establishment of banking associations and any changes to those 
arrangements
 
✓ Loans from either shareholders or third parties
 
✓ The sale or redemption of stock shares
 
✓ The payment of dividends
 
✓ Authorization of salaries or bonuses for officers and key executives 
(Yep, those multimillion-dollar bonuses you’ve been hearing about as 
major corporate scandals must be voted on in board meetings. The 
actual list of salaries doesn’t have to be in the minutes but can be 
included as an attachment)
Paying the high price of incorporation
The tax rates that C corporations must pay are as follows:
 
Taxable Income 
C Corporation Tax Rate
 
$0-50,000 
15%
 
$50,001-75,000 
25%
 
$75,001-100,000 
34%
 
$100,001-335,000 
39%
 
$335,001-10,000,000 
34%
 
$10,000,001-15,000,000 
35%
 
$15,000,001-18,333,333 
38%
 
Over $18,333,333 
35%
Although you may think that C corporation tax rates look higher than individual tax rates, in reality, 
many corporations avoid taxes completely by taking advantage of loopholes and deductions in the 
tax code. Most major corporations have an entire tax department whose sole responsibility is to 
find ways to avoid taxation.

28
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics  
 
✓ Any purchases, sales, or leases of corporate assets
 
✓ The purchase of another company
 
✓ Any merger with another company
 
✓ Changes to the Articles of Incorporation or bylaws
 
✓ Election of corporate officers and directors
 
These corporate minutes are official records of the company, and the IRS, 
state taxing authorities, and courts can review them. If a company and its 
owners are sued and the company wants to invoke the veil of corporate pro-
tection, it must have these board minutes in place to prove that it operated as 
a corporation.
If a C corporation’s ownership is kept among family and friends, it can be flex-
ible about its reporting requirements. However, many C corporations have 
outside investors and creditors who require formal financial reporting that 
meets GAAP standards (for more on this topic, see Chapter 18). Also, most C 
corporations must have their financial reports audited. I talk more about the 
auditing process in Chapter 18.

Chapter 3
Public or Private: How Company 
Structure Affects the Books
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the private side of business
▶ Checking out the public world of corporations
▶ Seeing what happens when a company decides to go public
N
ot every company wants to be under public scrutiny. Although some 
firms operate in the public arena by selling shares to the general public 
on the open market, others prefer to keep ownership within a closed circle 
of friends or investors. When company owners contemplate whether to keep 
their business private or to take it public, they’re making a decision that can 
permanently change the company’s direction.
In this chapter, I explain the differences between public and private compa-
nies, the advantages and disadvantages of each, and how the decision about 
whether to go public or stay private impacts a company’s financial reporting 
requirements. I also describe the process involved when company owners 
decide to take their business public.
Investigating Private Companies
Private companies don’t sell stock to the general public, so they don’t have 
to report to the government (except for filing their tax returns, of course) or 
answer to the public. No matter how big or small these companies are, they 
can operate behind closed doors.
A private company gives owners the freedom to make choices for the firm 
without having to worry about outside investors’ opinions. Of course, to 
maintain that freedom, the company must be able to raise the funds neces-
sary for the business to grow — either through profits, debt funding, or 
investments from family and friends.

30
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
Checking out the benefits
Private companies maintain absolute control over business operations. With 
absolute control, owners don’t have to worry about what the public thinks 
of its operations, nor do they have to worry about the quarterly race to meet 
the numbers to satisfy Wall Street’s profit watch. The company’s owners are 
the only ones who worry about profit levels and whether the company is 
meeting its goals, which they can do in the privacy of a boardroom. Further 
advantages of private ownership include
 
✓ Confidentiality: Private companies can keep their records under wraps, 
unlike public companies, which must file quarterly financial statements 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and various state 
agencies. Competitors can take advantage of the information that public 
companies disclose, whereas private companies can leave their com-
petitors guessing and even hide a short-term problem.
Keeping it in the family
Mars, one of the world’s largest private compa-
nies, makes some of your favorite candies — 3 
Musketeers, M&M’s, and Snickers. Mars has 
never gone public, which means it has never 
sold its shares of stock to the general public. 
The company is still owned and operated by the 
family that founded it.
Frank and Ethel Mars, who made candy in the 
kitchen of their Tacoma, Washington, home, 
started Mars in 1911. Their first worldwide suc-
cess was the Milky Way bar, which became 
known as the Mars bar in Europe in the 1920s.
Today, Mars is a $25 billion business with oper-
ations in more than 56 countries and sales of its 
products in over 100 countries. Mars isn’t just 
making candy anymore, either. It also manu-
factures Whiskas and Pedigree pet food, Uncle 
Ben’s rice products, vending systems, elec-
tronics for automated payment systems, and 
information technology related to its manufac-
turing operations. The family is still in control of 
all these businesses and makes the decisions 
about which businesses to add to its portfolio.
One of Mars’s five key principles that shape 
its business is “Freedom.” The company’s 
statement about the importance of freedom 
clearly describes why the family decided to 
stay private:
 
 Mars is one of the world’s largest privately 
owned corporations. This private owner-
ship is a deliberate choice. Many other 
companies began as Mars did, but as they 
grew larger and required new sources of 
funds, they sold stocks or incurred restric-
tive debt to fuel their business. To extend 
their growth, they exchanged a portion of 
their freedom. We believe growth and pros-
perity can be achieved another way.

31
 Chapter 3: Public or Private: How Company Structure Affects the Books
 
 Owners of private companies also like the secrecy they can keep about 
their personal net worth. Although public companies must disclose 
the number of shares their officers, directors, and major shareholders 
hold, private companies have no obligation to release these ownership 
details.
 
✓ Flexibility: In private companies, family members can easily decide how 
much to pay one another, whether to allow private loans to one another, 
and whether to award lucrative fringe benefits or other financial incen-
tives, all without having to worry about shareholder scrutiny. Public 
companies must answer to their shareholders for any bonuses or other 
incentives they give to top executives. A private-company owner can 
take out whatever money he wants without worrying about the best 
interests of outside investors, such as shareholders. Any disagreements 
the owners have about how they disburse their assets remain behind 
closed doors.
 
✓ Greater financial freedom: Private companies can carefully select 
how to raise money for the business and with whom to make financial 
arrangements. After public companies offer their stock in the public 
markets, they have no control over who buys their shares and becomes 
a future owner.
 
 If a private company receives funding from experienced investors, it 
doesn’t face the same scrutiny that a public company does. Publicly 
disclosed financial statements are required only when stock is sold to 
the general public, not when shares are traded privately among a small 
group of investors.
Defining disadvantages
The biggest disadvantage a private company faces is its limited ability to 
raise large sums of cash. Because a private company doesn’t sell stock or 
offer bonds to the general public, it spends a lot more time than a public 
company does finding investors or creditors who are willing to risk their 
funds. And many investors don’t want to invest in a company that’s con-
trolled by a small group of people and that lacks the oversight of public 
scrutiny.
If a private company needs cash, it must perform one or more of the following 
tasks:
 
✓ Arrange for a loan with a financial institution
 
✓ Sell additional shares of stock to existing owners

32
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
 
✓ Ask for help from an angel, a private investor willing to help a small busi-
ness get started with some upfront cash
 
✓ Get funds from a venture capitalist, someone who invests in start-up busi-
nesses, providing the necessary cash in exchange for some portion of 
ownership
These options for raising money may present a problem for a private com-
pany because
 
✓ A company’s borrowing capability is limited and based on how much 
capital the owners have invested in the company. A financial institution 
requires that a certain portion of the capital needed to operate the busi-
ness — sometimes as much as 50 percent — comes from the owners. 
Just like when you want to borrow money to buy a home, the bank 
requires you to put up some cash before it loans you the rest. The same 
is true for companies that want a business loan. I talk more about this 
topic and how to calculate debt to equity ratios in Chapter 12.
 
✓ Persuading outside investors to put up a significant amount of cash if 
the owners want to maintain control of the business is no easy feat. 
Often, major outside investors seek a greater role in company opera-
tions by acquiring a significant share of the ownership and asking for 
several seats on the board of directors.
 
✓ Finding the right investment partner can be difficult. When private-
company owners seek outside investors, they must be careful that the 
potential investors have the same vision and goals for the business that 
they do.
 
Another major disadvantage that a private company faces is that the owners’ 
net worth is likely tied almost completely to the value of the company. If a 
business fails, the owners may lose everything and may possibly even be left 
with a huge debt. If owners take their company public, however, they can sell 
some of their stock and diversify their portfolios, thereby reducing their port-
folios’ risk.
Figuring out reporting
Reporting requirements for a private company vary based on its agreements 
with stakeholders. Outside investors in a private company usually estab-
lish reporting requirements as part of the agreement to invest funds in the 
business. A private company circulates its reports among its closed group 
of stakeholders — executives, managers, creditors, and investors — and 
doesn’t have to share them with the public.

33
 Chapter 3: Public or Private: How Company Structure Affects the Books
A private company must file financial reports with the SEC when it has more 
than 500 common shareholders and $10 million in assets, as set by the 
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Congress passed this act so that private 
companies that reach the size of public companies and acquire a certain 
mass of outside ownership have the same reporting obligations as public 
companies. (See the nearby sidebar “Private or Publix?” for an example of 
this type of company.)
 
When a private company’s stock ownership and assets exceed the limits set 
by the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the company must file a Form 
10, which includes a description of the business and its officers, similar to an 
initial public offering (also known as an IPO, which is the first public sale of a 
company’s stock). After the company files Form 10, the SEC requires it to file 
quarterly and annual reports.
In some cases, private companies buy back stock from their current share-
holders to keep the number of individuals who own stock under the 500 
limit. But generally, when a company deals with the financial expenses of 
publicly reporting its earnings and can no longer keep its veil of secrecy, the 
pressure builds to go public and gain greater access to the funds needed to 
grow even larger.
Understanding Public Companies
A company that offers shares of stock on the open market is a public com-
pany. Public company owners don’t make decisions based solely on their 
preferences — they must always consider the opinions of the business’s out-
side investors.
Private or Publix?
Publix Super Markets is a private company 
owned by more than 87,000 shareholders. 
You can think of it as a semi-public company. 
However, until Publix actually decides to sell 
stock on a public exchange — if it ever does — 
it’s classified as a private company. Publix 
makes its stock available during designated 
public offerings that are open only to its employ-
ees and non-employee members of its board of 
directors. It also offers employees a stock own-
ership plan, which has more than 92,000 partici-
pants. So even though Publix stock isn’t sold on 
a stock exchange, Publix must file public finan-
cial reports with the SEC.

Before a company goes public, it must meet certain criteria. Generally, invest-
ment bankers (who are actually responsible for selling the stock) require that 
a private company generate at least $10 million to $20 million in annual sales, 
with profits of about $1 million. (Exceptions to this rule exist, however, and 
some smaller companies do go public.) Before going public, company owners 
must ask themselves the following questions:
 
✓ Can my firm maintain a high growth rate to attract investors?
 
✓ Does enough public awareness of my company and its products or 
services exist to make a successful public offering?
 
✓ Is my business operating in a hot industry that will help attract investors?
 
✓ Can my company perform as well as, and preferably better than, its 
competition?
 
✓ Can my firm afford the ongoing cost of financial auditing requirements 
(which can be as high as $2 million a year for a small company)?
If company owners are confident in their answers to these questions, they 
may want to take their business public. But they need to keep in mind the 
advantages and disadvantages of going public, which is a long, expensive 
process that takes months and sometimes even years.
 
Companies don’t take themselves public alone — they hire investment 
bankers to steer the process to completion. Investment bankers usually get 
multimillion-dollar fees or commissions for taking a company public. I talk 
more about the process in the upcoming section “A Whole New World: How a 
Company Goes from Private to Public.”
Going public, losing jobs
Public company founders who don’t keep their 
investors happy can find themselves out on the 
street and no longer involved in the company 
they started. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, 
who started Apple Computer, found out the 
hard way that selling stock on the public market 
can ultimately take the company away from the 
founders.
Jobs and Wozniak became multimillionaires 
after Apple Computer went public, but share-
holders ousted them from their leadership roles 
in a management shake-up in 1984. Wozniak 
decided to leave Apple soon after the shake-up. 
Apple’s new CEO announced that he couldn’t 
find a role for Jobs in the company’s operations 
in 1985.
Interestingly, Jobs ended up as the head of 
Apple again in 1998, when the shareholders 
turned to him to try to rescue the company from 
failure. He has since engineered a comeback 
for Apple.

Examining the perks
If a company goes public, the primary benefit is that it gains access to addi-
tional capital (more cash), which can be critical if it’s a high-growth business 
that needs money to take advantage of its growth potential. A secondary 
benefit is that company owners can become millionaires, or even billionaires, 
overnight if the initial public offering (IPO) is successful.
Being a public company has a number of other benefits:
 
✓ New corporate cash: At some point, a growing company usually maxes 
out its ability to borrow funds, and it must find people willing to invest 
in the business. Selling stock to the general public can be a great way for 
a company to raise cash without being obligated to pay interest on the 
money.
 
✓ Owner diversification: People who start a new business typically put 
a good chunk of their assets into starting the business and then rein-
vest most of the profits in the business in order to grow the company. 
Frequently, founders have a large share of their assets tied up in the 
company. Selling shares publicly allows owners to take out some of their 
investment and diversify their holdings in other investments, which 
reduces the risks to their personal portfolios.
 
✓ Increased liquidity: Liquidity is a company’s ability to quickly turn an 
asset into cash (if it isn’t already cash). People who own shares in a 
closely held private company may have a lot of assets but little chance 
to actually turn those assets into cash. Selling privately owned shares 
of stock is very difficult. Going public gives the stock a set market value 
and creates more potential buyers for the stock.
 
✓ Company value: Company owners benefit by knowing their firm’s worth 
for a number of reasons. If one of the key owners dies, state and federal 
inheritance tax appraisers must set the company’s value for estate tax 
purposes. Many times, these values are set too high for private compa-
nies, which can cause all kinds of problems for other owners and family 
members. Going public sets an absolute value for the shares held by 
all company shareholders and prevents problems with valuation. Also, 
businesses that want to offer shares of stock to their employees as 
incentives find that recruiting with this incentive is much easier when 
the stock is sold on the open market.
Looking at the negative side
Regardless of the many advantages of being a public company, a great many 
disadvantages also exist:

36
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
 
✓ Costs: Paying the costs of providing audited financial statements that 
meet the requirements of the SEC or state agencies can be very expen-
sive — sometimes as high as $2 million annually. (I discuss the audit 
process in greater detail in Chapter 18.) Investor relations can also add 
significant costs in employee time, printing, and mailing expenses.
 
✓ Control: As stock sells on the open market, more and more sharehold-
ers enter the picture, giving each one the right to vote on key company 
decisions. The original owners and closed circle of investors no longer 
have absolute control of the company.
 
✓ Disclosure: Although a private company can hide difficulties it may 
be having, a public company must report its problems, exposing any 
weaknesses to competitors, who can access detailed information about 
the company’s operations by getting copies of the required financial 
reports. In addition, the net worth of a public company’s owners is 
widely known because their stock holdings must be disclosed as part of 
these reports.
 
✓ Cash control: In a private company, an owner can decide her own salary 
and benefits as well as the salary and benefits of any family member or 
friend involved in running the business. In a public company, the board 
of directors has to approve and report any major cash withdrawals, 
whether for salary or loans, to shareholders.
 
✓ Lack of liquidity: When a company goes public, a constant flow of 
buyers for the stock isn’t guaranteed. In order for a stock to be liquid, 
a shareholder must be able to convert that stock to cash. Small compa-
nies that don’t have wide distribution of their stock can be hard to sell 
on the open market. The market price may even be lower than the actual 
value of the firm’s assets because of a lack of competition for shares of 
the stock. When not enough competition exists, shareholders have a 
hard time selling the stock and converting it to cash, making the invest-
ment nonliquid.
 
A failed IPO or a failure to live up to shareholders’ expectations can change 
what may have been a good business for the founders into a bankrupt entity. 
Although founders may be willing to ride out the losses for a while, sharehold-
ers rarely are. Many IPOs that raised millions before the Internet stock crash 
in 2000 are now defunct companies.
Filing and more filing: Government 
and shareholder reports
Public companies have an unending stream of reports they must file with the 
SEC. They must file financial reports quarterly as well as annually. They also 
must file reports after specific events, such as bankruptcy or the sale of a 
company division.

37
 Chapter 3: Public or Private: How Company Structure Affects the Books
Quarterly reports
Each quarter, public companies must file audited financial statements on 
Form 10Q in addition to information about the company’s market risk, con-
trols and procedures, legal proceedings, and defaults on payments.
Yearly report
Each year, public companies must file an annual report with audited financial 
statements and information about
 
✓ Company history: How the company was started, who started it, and 
how it grew to its current level of operations
 
✓ Organizational structure: How the company is organized, who the key 
executives are, and who reports to whom
 
✓ Equity holdings: A list of the major shareholders and a summary of all 
outstanding stock
 
✓ Subsidiaries: Other businesses that are wholly or partially owned by the 
company
 
✓ Employee stock purchase and savings plans: Plans that allow employ-
ees to own stock by purchasing it or participating in a savings plan
 
✓ Incorporation: Information about where the company is incorporated
 
✓ Legal proceedings: Information about any ongoing legal matters that 
may be material to the company
 
✓ Changes or disagreements with accountants: Information about finan-
cial disclosures, controls and procedures, executive compensation, and 
accounting fees and services
 
In addition to the regular reports, public companies must file an 8-K, a form 
for reporting any major events that could impact the company’s financial posi-
tion. A major event may be the acquisition of another company, the sale of a 
company or division, bankruptcy, the resignation of directors, or a change in 
the fiscal year. A public company must report any event that falls under this 
requirement on the 8-K to the SEC within four days of the event’s occurrence. I 
discuss the rules for SEC Form 8-K in greater detail in Chapter 19.
Adhering to the rules of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
All the scandals about public companies that emerged in the early 2000s 
have made this entire reporting process riskier and more costly for company 
owners. In 2002, Congress passed a bill called the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to try 
to correct some of the problems in financial reporting. This bill passed as 
details emerged about how corporate officials from companies like Enron, 
MCI, and Tyco hid information from the SEC.

38
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
New SEC rules issued after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act passed require CEOs and 
CFOs to certify financial and other information contained in their quarterly 
and annual reports. They must certify that
 
✓ They’ve established, maintained, and regularly evaluated effective dis-
closure controls and procedures.
 
✓ They’ve made disclosures to the auditors and audit committee of the 
board of directors about internal controls.
 
✓ They’ve included information in the quarterly and annual reports about 
their evaluation of the controls in place, as well as about any significant 
changes in their internal controls or any other factors that could signifi-
cantly affect controls after the initial evaluation.
 
If a CEO or CFO certifies this information, and the information later proves 
to be false, he can end up facing criminal charges. Since the passage of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, companies have delayed releasing financial reports if 
the CEO or CFO has any questions rather than risking charges. You’ll prob-
ably hear more about delays in reporting as CEOs and CFOs become more 
reluctant to sign off on financial reports that may have questionable infor-
mation. Shareholders often panic when they hear about a delay, and stock 
prices drop.
Bearing the burden and expense 
of Sarbanes-Oxley
Many major corporations already have the inter-
nal controls in place and the documentation 
that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires. Smaller 
companies are going to be harder hit with these 
new requirements. The SEC’s only concession 
for smaller companies is an extension on when 
they must be in compliance with the new rules 
on internal controls. All small businesses had to 
be in compliance by November 2004.
The rules imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley were such 
a significant burden on small companies that 
some of them decided to buy out shareholders 
and make the companies private again, or merge 
with larger companies, or even liquidate.
When a private company thinks about going 
public, it must consider whether the process is 
worth the costs. With the new Sarbanes-Oxley 
rules in place, a small company pays close to 
$3 million in legal, accounting, and other costs 
of being public. Prior to Sarbanes-Oxley, these 
costs totaled closer to $2 million. Large corpo-
rations budget over $7 million to cover the costs 
of being a public company nowadays.

39
 Chapter 3: Public or Private: How Company Structure Affects the Books
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act has added significant costs to the entire process of 
completing financial reports, affecting the following components:
 
✓ Documentation: Companies must document and develop policies and 
procedures relating to their internal controls over financial reporting. 
Although an outside accounting firm can assist with the documenta-
tion process, management must be actively involved in the process of 
assessing internal controls — they can’t delegate this responsibility to 
an external firm.
 
✓ Audit fees: Independent audit firms now look a lot more closely at finan-
cial statements and internal controls in place over financial reporting, 
and the SEC’s Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) 
now regulates the accounting profession. The PCAOB inspects account-
ing firms to be sure they’re in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
and SEC rules.
 
✓ Legal fees: Because companies need lawyers to help them comply with 
the new provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, their legal expenses are 
increasing.
 
✓ Information technology: Complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
requires both hardware and software upgrades to meet the internal con-
trol requirements and the speedier reporting requirements.
 
✓ Boards of directors: Most companies must restructure their board 
of directors and audit committees to meet the Sarbanes-Oxley Act’s 
requirements, ensuring that independent board members control key 
audit decisions. The structure and operation of nominating and compen-
sation committees must eliminate even the appearance of conflicts of 
interest. Companies must make provisions to give shareholders direct 
input in corporate governance decisions. Businesses also must provide 
additional education to board members to be sure they understand their 
responsibilities to shareholders.
A Whole New World: How a Company 
Goes from Private to Public
So the owners of a company have finally decided to sell the company’s 
stock publicly. Now what? In this section, I describe the role of an invest-
ment banker in helping a company sell its stock. I also explain the process of 
making a public offering.

40
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
Teaming up with an investment banker
The first step after a company decides to go public is to choose who will 
handle the sales and which market to sell the stock on. Few firms have the 
capacity to approach the public stock markets on their own. Instead, they 
hire an investment banker to help them through the complicated process of 
going public. A well-known investment banker can help lend credibility to a 
little-known small company, which makes selling the stock easier.
Investment bankers help a company in the following ways:
 
✓ They prepare the required SEC documents and register the new stock 
offering with the SEC. These documents must include information 
about the company (its products, services, and markets) and its officers 
and directors. Additionally, they must include information about the 
risks the firm faces; how the business plans to use the money raised; 
any outstanding legal problems; holdings of company insiders; and, of 
course, audited financial statements.
 
✓ They price the stock so it’s attractive to potential investors. If the stock 
is priced too high, the offering could fall flat on its face, with few shares 
sold. If the stock is priced too low, the company could miss out on 
potential cash that investors, who buy IPO shares, can get as a windfall 
from quickly turning around and selling the stock at a profit.
 
✓ They negotiate the price at which the stock is offered to the general 
public and the guarantees they give to the company owners for sell-
ing the stock. An investment banker can give an underwriting guarantee, 
which guarantees the amount of money that will be raised. In this sce-
nario, the banker buys the stock from the company and then resells it to 
the public. Usually, an investment banker puts together a syndicate of 
investment bankers who help find buyers for the stock.
 
 Another method that’s sometimes used is called a best efforts agreement. 
In this scenario, the investment banker tries to sell the stock but doesn’t 
guarantee the number of shares that will sell.
 
✓ They decide which stock exchange to list the stock on. The New York 
Stock Exchange (NYSE) has the highest level of requirements. If a com-
pany wants to list on this exchange, it must have a pretax income of at 
least $10 million over the last three years and 2,200 or more sharehold-
ers. The NASDAQ and American Stock Exchange have lower require-
ments. Companies can also sell stock over-the-counter, which means the 
stock isn’t listed on any exchange, so selling the stock both as an IPO 
and after the IPO is much harder.

41
 Chapter 3: Public or Private: How Company Structure Affects the Books
Making a public offering
After the company and the investment banker agree to work together and set 
the terms for the public offering, as well as the commission structure (how 
the investment banker gets paid), the banker prepares the registration state-
ment to be filed with the SEC.
After the registration is filed, the SEC imposes a “cooling-off period” to give 
itself time to investigate the offering and to make sure all necessary infor-
mation is disclosed in the documents. The length of the cooling-off period 
depends on how complete the documents are and whether the SEC asks for 
additional information. During the cooling-off period, the underwriter pro-
duces the red herring, which is an initial prospectus that includes the infor-
mation in the SEC registration without the stock price or effective date.
After the underwriter completes the red herring, the company and the invest-
ment bankers do road shows — presentations held around the country to 
introduce the business to major institutional investors and start building 
interest in the pending IPO. A company can’t transact sales until the SEC 
approves the registration information, but it can start generating excitement 
and getting feedback about the IPO at these meetings.
When the SEC finishes its investigation and approves the offering, an effective 
date, or the date of the stock offering, can be set. The company and invest-
ment bankers then sit down and establish a final stock price. Although they 
discuss the stock price in initial conversations, the final price can’t be set 
until the actual effective date is known. Market conditions can change sig-
nificantly from the time the company first talks with investment bankers and 
the date when the stock is finally offered publicly. Sometimes, the company 
and investment banker decide to withdraw or delay an IPO if a market crisis 
creates a bad climate for introducing a new stock, or if the road shows don’t 
identify enough interested major investors.
After the stock price is set, the stock is sold to the public. The company gets 
the proceeds minus any commissions paid to the investment bankers.

▶ Understanding the two main accounting methods
▶ Deciphering debits and credits
▶ Examining the Chart of Accounts
▶ Looking at the different types of profit
A
h, the language of financial accounting — debits, credits, double-entry 
accounting! Just reading the words makes your heart beat faster, 
doesn’t it? The language and practices of accountants can get the best of 
anyone, but there’s a method to the madness, and figuring out that method is 
a crucial first step to understanding financial reports. In this chapter, I help 
you understand the logic behind the baffling and unique world of financial 
accounting. And you won’t even need a pocket protector!
Making Sense of Accounting Methods
Officially, two types of accounting methods dictate how a company’s transac-
tions are recorded in its financial books: cash-basis accounting and accrual 
accounting. The key difference between the two types is how the company 
records cash coming into and going out of the business. Within that simple 
difference lies a lot of room for error — or manipulation. In fact, many of 
the major corporations involved in financial scandals have gotten in trouble 
because they played games with the nuts and bolts of their accounting 
method. I talk more about those games in Chapter 23.
Cash-basis accounting
In cash-basis accounting, companies record expenses in financial accounts 
when the cash is actually laid out, and they book revenue when they actually 
hold the cash in their hot little hands or, more likely, in a bank account. For 

44
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
example, if a painter completes a project on December 30, 2008, but doesn’t 
get paid for it until the owner inspects it on January 10, 2009, the painter 
reports those cash earnings on his 2009 tax report. In cash-basis accounting, 
cash earnings include checks, credit-card receipts, or any other form of rev-
enue from customers.
 
Smaller companies that haven’t formally incorporated, and most sole propri-
etors, use cash-basis accounting because the system is easier for them to use 
on their own, meaning they don’t have to hire a large accounting staff.
Accrual accounting
If a company uses accrual accounting, it records revenue when the actual 
transaction is completed (such as the completion of work specified in a 
contract agreement between the company and its customer), not when it 
receives the cash. That is, the company records revenue when it earns it, 
even if the customer hasn’t paid yet. For example, a carpentry contractor 
who uses accrual accounting records the revenue he earns when he com-
pletes the job, even if the customer hasn’t paid the final bill yet.
Expenses are handled in the same way. The company records any expenses 
when they’re incurred, even if it hasn’t paid for the supplies yet. For example, 
when a carpenter buys lumber for a job, he may very likely do so on account 
and not actually lay out the cash for the lumber until a month or so later 
when he gets the bill.
 
All incorporated companies must use accrual accounting according to the gen-
erally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) because revenues are matched 
to expenses in the same month they occur. If you’re reading a corporation’s 
financial reports, what you see is based on accrual accounting.
Why method matters
The accounting method a business uses can have a major impact on the total 
revenue it reports, as well as on the expenses it subtracts from the revenue 
to get the bottom line. Here’s how:
 
✓ Cash-basis accounting: Expenses and revenues aren’t carefully matched 
on a month-to-month basis. Expenses aren’t recognized until the money 
is actually paid out, even if the expenses are incurred in previous 
months, and revenues earned in previous months aren’t recognized until 
the cash is actually received. However, cash-basis accounting excels in 
tracking the actual cash available.

45
 Chapter 4: Digging into Accounting Basics
 
✓ Accrual accounting: Expenses and revenue are matched, providing a 
company with a better idea of how much it’s spending to operate each 
month and how much profit it’s making. Expenses are recorded (or 
accrued) in the month incurred, even if the cash isn’t paid out until 
the next month. Revenues are recorded in the month the project is 
completed or the product is shipped, even if the company hasn’t yet 
received the cash from the customer.
The way a company records payment of payroll taxes, for example, differs 
with these two methods. In accrual accounting, each month the company 
sets aside the amount it expects to pay toward its quarterly tax bills for 
employee taxes using an accrual (paper transaction in which no money 
changes hands). The entry goes into a tax liability account (an account for 
tracking tax payments that have been made or must still be made). If the 
company incurs $1,000 of tax liabilities in March, that amount is entered in 
the tax liability account even if the firm hasn’t yet paid out the cash. That 
way, the expense is matched to the month in which it’s incurred.
In cash accounting, the company doesn’t record the liability until it actually 
pays the government the cash. Although it incurs tax expenses each month, 
the company using cash accounting shows a higher profit during two months 
every quarter and possibly even shows a loss in the third month when the 
taxes are paid.
To see how these two methods can result in totally different financial state-
ments, imagine that a carpenter contracts a job with a total cost to the cus-
tomer of $2,000. The carpenter’s expected expenses for the supplies, labor, 
and other necessities are $1,200, so his expected profit is $800. He contracts 
the work on December 23, 2008, and completes the job on December 31, 2008, 
but he isn’t paid until January 3, 2009. The contractor takes no cash upfront 
and instead agrees to be paid in full at completion.
If he uses the cash-basis accounting method, because no cash changes 
hands, he doesn’t have to report any revenues from this transaction in 2008. 
But say he lays out the cash for his expenses in 2008. In this case, his bottom 
line is $1,200 less with no revenue to offset it, and his net profit (the amount 
of money his company earns, minus expenses) for the business in 2008 is 
lower. This scenario may not necessarily be a bad thing if he’s trying to 
reduce his tax hit for 2008.
 
If you’re a small-business owner looking to manage your tax bill and you use 
cash-basis accounting, you can ask vendors to hold off payments until the 
beginning of the next year to reduce your net income, thereby lowering your 
tax payments for the year.

46
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
If the same carpenter uses accrual accounting, his bottom line is differ-
ent. In this case, he books his expenses when they’re actually incurred. He 
also records the income when he completes the job on December 31, 2008, 
even though he doesn’t get the cash payment until 2009. His net income is 
increased by this job, and so is his tax hit. Chapter 7 covers the ins and outs 
of reporting income on the income statement.
Understanding Debits and Credits
You probably think of the word debit as a reduction in your cash. Most non-
accountants see debits only when they’re taken out of their banking account. 
Credits likely have a more positive connotation in your mind. You see them 
most frequently when you’ve returned an item and your account is credited.
 
Forget everything you think you know about debits and credits! You’re going 
to have to erase these assumptions from your mind in order to understand 
double-entry accounting, which is the basis of most accounting done in the 
business world.
Both cash-basis and accrual accounting use this method, in which a credit 
may be added to or subtracted from an account, depending on the type of 
account. The same is true with debits; sometimes they add to an account, 
and sometimes they subtract from an account.
Incentives and the bottom line
To improve the bottom line, many companies 
offer their salespeople different kinds of incen-
tives at the end of a month, quarter, or year. The 
more the salespeople sell, the more income the 
company records, allowing it to report stronger 
earnings for that period.
You’ve probably seen this concept put into 
action if you’ve ever made a major pur-
chase, such as a car, at the end of the month. 
You probably found that you could be much 
more aggressive with your negotiations if the 
salesperson hadn’t met quota or was compet-
ing to win a sales contest.
If a company gets really aggressive with its 
end-of-period revenue-booking practices, it can 
inflate its actual earnings, especially if sales-
people allow customers to sign orders with the 
promise that they can cancel their orders early 
in the next month or accounting period. Some 
companies have gotten into trouble by record-
ing sales on products that weren’t yet shipped 
in order to make a quarterly or monthly goal.

47
 Chapter 4: Digging into Accounting Basics
Double-entry accounting
When you buy something, you do two things: You get something new (say, a 
chair), and you have to give up something to get it (most likely, cash or your 
credit line). Companies that use double-entry accounting show both sides of 
every transaction in their books, and those sides must be equal.
 
Probably at least 95 percent of businesses in the U.S. use double-entry 
accounting, whether they use the cash-basis or accrual accounting method. 
It’s the only way a business can be certain that it has considered both sides of 
every transaction.
For example, if a company buys office supplies with cash, the value of 
the office supplies account increases, while the value of the cash account 
decreases. If the company purchases $100 in office supplies, here’s how it 
records the transaction on its books:
Account
Debit
Credit
Office supplies
$100
Cash
$100
In this case, the debit increases the value of the office supplies account and 
decreases the value of the cash account. Both accounts are asset accounts, 
which means both accounts represent things the company owns that are 
shown on the balance sheet. (The balance sheet is the financial statement 
that gives you a snapshot of the assets, liabilities, and shareholders’ equity 
as of a particular date. I cover balance sheets in greater detail in Chapter 6.)
The assets are balanced or offset by the liabilities (claims made against the 
company’s assets by creditors, such as loans) and the equity (claims made 
against the company’s assets, such as shares of stock held by shareholders). 
Double-entry accounting seeks to balance these assets and claims against 
these assets. In fact, the balance sheet of a company is developed using this 
formula:
Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s equity
Profit and loss statements
In addition to establishing accounts to develop the balance sheet and make 
entries in the double-entry accounting system, companies must also set up 
accounts that they use to develop the income statement (also known as the 
profit and loss statement, or P&L), which shows a company’s revenue and 

48
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
expenses over a set period of time. (See Chapter 7 for more on revenue and 
expenses.) The double-entry accounting method impacts not only the way 
assets and liabilities are entered but also the way revenue and expenses are 
entered.
The effect of debits and credits on sales
If you’re a sales manager tracking how your department is doing for the year, 
you want to be able to decipher debits and credits. If you think an error 
may exist, your ability to read reports and understand the impact of debits 
and credits is critical. For example, anytime you think the income statement 
doesn’t accurately reflect your department’s success, you have to dig into 
the debits and credits to be sure your sales are being booked correctly. 
You also need to be aware of the other accounts — especially revenue and 
expense accounts — that are used to book transactions that impact your 
department.
A common entry that impacts both the balance sheet and the income state-
ment is one that keeps track of the amount of cash customers pay to buy the 
company’s product. If the customers pay $100, here’s how the entry looks:
Account
Debit
Credit
Cash
$100
Sales revenue
$100
In this case, both the cash account and the sales revenue account increase. 
One increases using a debit, and the other increases using a credit. Yikes — I 
know this can be so confusing! Whether an account increases or decreases 
from a debit or a credit depends on the type of account it is. See Table 4-1 to 
find out when debits and credits increase or decrease an account.

accounts until you become familiar with the differences.

 Chapter 4: Digging into Accounting Basics
Digging into depreciation 
and amortization
 
Depreciation and amortization are accounting methods used to track the use 
of an asset and record its value as it ages. Tangible assets (those you can 
touch or hold in your hand, like cars or inventory) are depreciated (reduced 
in value by a certain percentage each year to show that the tangible asset is 
being used up). Intangible assets (things like intellectual property or patents) 
are amortized (reduced in value by a certain percentage each year to show 
that the intangible asset is being used up).
For example, each vehicle a company owns loses value throughout the 
normal course of business every year. Cars or trucks are usually estimated to 
have five years of useful life. Suppose a company pays $30,000 for a car. To 
calculate its depreciation on a five-year schedule, divide $30,000 by 5 to get 
$6,000 in depreciation. Each of the five years this car is in service, the com-
pany records a depreciation expense of $6,000.
When the company makes the initial purchase of the vehicle using a loan, it 
records the purchase this way:
Account
Debit
Credit
2008 ABC company car
$30,000
Loans payable — Vehicles
$30,000
In this transaction, both the debit and credit increase the accounts affected. 
The debit recording the car purchase increases the total of the assets in the 
vehicle account, and the credit recording the new loan also increases the 
total of the loans payable for cars.
The company records its depreciation expenses for the car at the end of each 
year this way:
Account 
Debit
Credit
Depreciation expense
$6,000
Accumulated depreciation — 
Vehicles
$6,000
The debit in this case increases the expense for depreciation. The 
credit increases the amount accumulated for depreciation. The line item 
Accumulated depreciation — Vehicles is listed directly below the asset 
Vehicles on the balance sheet and is shown as a negative number to be 
subtracted from the value of the Vehicles assets. This way of presenting the 
information on the balance sheet helps the financial report reader quickly 
see how old an asset is and how much value and useful life it has.

50
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
A similar process, amortization, is used for intangible assets, such as pat-
ents. Just like with depreciation, a company must write down the value of a 
patent as it nears expiration. Amortization expenses appear on the income 
statement, and the value of the asset is shown on the balance sheet. The line 
item Patent is shown first on the balance sheet with another line item called 
Accumulated amortization below it. The Accumulated amortization line shows 
how much has been written down against the asset in the current year and 
any past years. This gives the financial report reader a way to quickly calcu-
late how much value is left in a company’s patents.
Checking Out the Chart of Accounts
A company groups the accounts it uses to develop the financial statements in 
the Chart of Accounts, which is a listing of all open accounts that the account-
ing department can use to record transactions, according to the role of the 
accounts in the statements. All businesses have a Chart of Accounts, even 
if it’s so small that they don’t even realize they do and have never formally 
gone about designing it.
The Chart of Accounts for a business sort of builds itself as the company 
buys and sells assets for its use and records revenue earned and expenses 
incurred in its day-to-day operations.
If you work for a company and have responsibility for its transactions, you’ll 
have a copy of the Chart of Accounts, so you know which account you want 
to use for each transaction. If you’re a financial report reader with no internal 
company responsibilities, you won’t get to see this Chart of Accounts, but 
you do need to understand what goes into these different accounts to under-
stand what you’re seeing in the financial statements.
The granddaddy of bookkeeping
Every transaction a company makes during 
the year eventually finds its way into the gen-
eral ledger. Although companies often use 
the general ledger just for a summary of what 
happens in each of their accounts, some com-
panies include details about specific transac-
tions in their subledgers. For example, accounts 
receivable is likely summarized in the general 
ledger by just putting the end-of-month totals 
for outstanding customer accounts. The actual 
detail of the transactions that take place during 
the month involving accounts receivable are 
in an accounts receivable subledger. In addi-
tion, accounting records show details for each 
customer, including what they bought and how 
much they still owe.

51
 Chapter 4: Digging into Accounting Basics
Each account in a Chart of Accounts is given a number. This clearly defined 
structure helps accountants move from job to job and still quickly get a 
handle on the Chart of Accounts. Also, because most companies use com-
puterized accounting, the software is developed with these numerical defi-
nitions. Some companies make up an alphabetical listing of their Chart of 
Accounts with numbers in parentheses to make finding accounts easier for 
managers who are unfamiliar with the structure.
The accounts in the Chart of Accounts appear in the following order:
 
✓ Balance sheet asset accounts (usually in the number range of 
1000–1999)
 
✓ Liability accounts (with numbers ranging from 2000–2999)
 
✓ Equity accounts (3000–3999)
 
✓ Income statement accounts/Revenue accounts (4000–4999)
 
✓ Expense accounts (5000–6999)
In the old days, these accounts were recorded on paper, and finding a spe-
cific transaction on the dozens or even hundreds of pages was a nightmare. 
Today, because most companies use computerized accounting, you can 
easily design a report to find most types of transactions electronically by 
grouping them by account type, customer, salesperson, product, or almost 
any other configuration that helps you decipher the entries.
To help you become familiar with the types of accounts in the Chart of 
Accounts and the types of transactions in those accounts, I review the most 
common accounts in this section in the order in which you’ll most likely read 
them in a financial report. I assign the accounts numbers that are most com-
monly generated by computer programs, but you may find that your com-
pany uses a different numbering system.
Asset accounts
Asset accounts come first in the Chart of Accounts, with the most current 
accounts (those that the company will use in less than 12 months) listed 
before the long-term accounts (those that the company will use in more than 
12 months).
Tangible assets
Assets you can hold in your hand are tangible assets, and they include cur-
rent assets and long-term assets. Current assets are assets that will be used up 
in the next 12 months. The following are examples of current-asset accounts:

52
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
 
✓ Cash in checking: This account is always the first one listed. Businesses 
use this account most often, depositing their cash received as revenue 
and their cash paid out to cover bills and debt here.
 
✓ Cash in savings: This account is where firms keep cash that isn’t needed 
for daily operations. It usually earns interest until the company decides 
how it wants to use this surplus cash.
 
✓ Cash on hand: This account tracks the actual cash the company keeps 
at its business locations. Cash on hand includes money in the cash reg-
isters as well as petty cash. Most companies have several different cash-
on-hand accounts. For example, a store may have its own account for 
tracking cash in the registers, and each department may have its own 
petty-cash account. How these accounts are structured depends on the 
company and the security controls it has in place to manage the cash 
on hand. Companies always leave plenty of room for additions in this 
account category.
 
✓ Accounts receivable: In this account, businesses record transactions 
in which customers bought products on store or company credit. Only 
companies that use the accrual method of accounting need this account.
 
✓ Inventory: This account tracks the cost of products the company has 
available for sale, whether it purchases the products from other compa-
nies or produces them in-house. Businesses adjust this account periodi-
cally throughout the year to reflect the changes in inventory affected 
by sales or other factors, such as breakage or theft. Although some 
firms use a computerized inventory system that adjusts the account 
almost instantaneously, others adjust the account only at the end of an 
accounting period.
Long-term assets are assets that will be held for more than 12 months. The fol-
lowing are common long-term asset accounts:
 
✓ Land: This account is used to record any purchases of land as a com-
pany asset. Companies list land separately because it doesn’t depreciate 
in value like the building or buildings sitting on it do.
 
✓ Buildings: This account lists the value of any buildings the company 
owns. This value is always a positive number.
 
✓ Accumulated depreciation: This account tracks the depreciation of 
company-owned buildings. Each year, the firm deducts a portion of the 
building’s value based on the building’s costs and the number of years 
the building will have a productive life.
 
✓ Leasehold Improvements: This account tracks improvements to build-
ings that the company leases rather than buys. In most cases, when 
a company leases retail or warehouse space, it must pay the costs of 
improving the property for its unique business use. These improvements 
are also depreciated, so the company uses a companion depreciation 
account called Accumulated depreciation — Leasehold improvements.

53
 Chapter 4: Digging into Accounting Basics
 
✓ Vehicles: This account tracks the cars, trucks, and other vehicles that a 
business owns. The initial value added to this account is the value of the 
vehicles when put into service. Vehicles are also depreciated, and the 
depreciation account is Accumulated depreciation — Vehicles.
 
✓ Furniture and Fixtures: This account tracks all the desks, chairs, and 
other fixtures a company buys for its offices, warehouses, and retail 
stores. Yes, these items, too, are depreciated, and the depreciation 
account is named Accumulated depreciation — Furniture and fixtures.
 
✓ Equipment: This account tracks any equipment a company purchases 
that’s expected to have a useful life of more than one year. This equipment 
includes computers, copiers, cash registers, and any other equipment 
needs. The depreciation account is Accumulated depreciation — 
Equipment.
Intangible assets
Companies also hold intangible assets, which have value but are often dif-
ficult to measure. The following are the most common intangible assets in the 
Chart of Accounts:
 
✓ Goodwill: A company needs this account only when it has bought 
another company. Frequently, a business that purchases another busi-
ness pays more than the actual value of its assets minus its liabilities. 
The premium paid, which may account for things such as customer loy-
alty, exceptional workforce, and great location, is listed on the books as 
goodwill.
 
✓ Intellectual property: This category includes copyrights, patents, and 
written work or products for which the company has been granted 
exclusive rights. For example, the government grants patents to a 
company or individual that invents a new product or process. These 
assets are amortized, which is similar to depreciation, because intel-
lectual property has a limited lifespan. The amortization account is 
Accumulated amortization — Intellectual Property.
 
 Having exclusive rights to a product allows a company to hold off com-
petition, which can mean a lot of extra profits. Patented products can 
often command a much higher price than products that aren’t patented.
Liability accounts
Money a company owes to creditors, vendors, suppliers, contractors, 
employees, government entities, and anyone else who provides products or 
services to the company is called a liability.

54
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
Current liabilities
Current liabilities include money owed in the next 12 months. The following 
accounts are used to record current liability transactions:
 
✓ Accounts payable: This account includes all the payments to suppliers, 
vendors, contractors, and consultants that are due in less than one year. 
Most of the payments made on these accounts are for invoices due in 
less than two months.
 
✓ Sales tax collected: This account tracks taxes collected for the state, 
local, or federal government on merchandise sold by the company. 
Firms record daily transactions in this account as they collect cash and 
make payments (usually monthly) to government agencies.
 
✓ Accrued payroll taxes: This account includes any taxes that must be paid 
to the state or federal government based on taxes withheld from employ-
ees’ checks. These payments are usually made monthly or quarterly.
 
✓ Credit card payable: This account tracks the payments to corporate 
credit cards. Some companies use these accounts as management tools 
for tracking employee activities and set them up by employee name, 
department name, or whatever method the company finds useful for 
monitoring credit card use.
Long-term liabilities
Long-term liabilities include money due beyond the next 12 months. The follow-
ing are accounts that companies use to record long-term liability transactions:
 
✓ Loans payable: This account tracks debts, such as mortgages or loans 
on vehicles, that are incurred for longer than one year.
 
✓ Bonds payable: This account tracks corporate bonds that have been 
issued for a term longer than one year. Bonds are a type of debt sold on 
the market that must be repaid in full with interest.
Equity accounts
Equity accounts reflect the portion of the assets that isn’t subject to liabilities 
and is therefore owned by a company’s shareholders. If the company isn’t 
incorporated, the ownership of the partners or sole proprietors is repre-
sented in this part of the balance sheet in an account called Owner’s equity 
or Shareholders’ equity. The following is a list of the most common equity 
accounts:

55
 Chapter 4: Digging into Accounting Basics
 
✓ Common Stock: This account reflects the value of the outstanding 
shares of common stock. Each share of common stock represents a 
portion of ownership, and this portion is calculated by multiplying the 
number of outstanding shares times the value of each share. Even com-
panies that haven’t sold stock in the public marketplace but have incor-
porated list shareholders on the incorporation documents and list the 
value of their shares on the balance sheet. Each common stock share-
holder has a vote in the company’s operations.
 
✓ Preferred stock: This account reflects the value of outstanding shares 
of preferred stock, which falls somewhere between bonds and shares 
of stock. Although a company has no obligation to repay the preferred 
shareholder for his investment, it does promise him dividends. If, for 
some reason, the dividends can’t be paid, they’re accrued for payment 
in later years. Any unpaid preferred stock dividends must be paid before 
a company pays dividends to common stock shareholders. Preferred 
shareholders don’t vote in the firm’s operations. If the business is liqui-
dated, preferred shareholders receive their share of the assets before 
common shareholders.
 
✓ Retained Earnings: This account tracks the profits or losses for a com-
pany each year. These numbers reflect earnings retained rather than 
paid out as dividends to shareholders and show a company’s long-term 
success or failure.
Revenue accounts
At the top of every income statement is the revenue brought in by the com-
pany. This revenue is offset by any costs directly related to it. The top sec-
tion of the income statement includes sales, cost of goods sold, and gross 
margin. Below this section and before the profit and loss section, it shows 
the expenses. In this section, I review the key accounts in the Chart of 
Accounts that make up the income statement (see Chapter 7).
Revenue
A company records all sales of products or services in revenue accounts. The 
following are the accounts used to record revenue transactions:
 
✓ Sales of goods or services: This account tracks the company’s revenues 
for the sale of its products or services.
 
✓ Sales discounts: This account tracks any discounts the company offers 
to increase its sales. If a company is heavily discounting its products, it 
may be competing intensely, or interest in the product may be falling. 

56
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
A company outsider probably doesn’t see these numbers, but if you’re 
reading the reports prepared for internal management purposes, this 
account gives you a view of how discounting is used.
 
✓ Sales returns and allowances: This account tracks problem sales from 
unhappy customers. A large number here may reflect customer dis-
satisfaction, which could be the result of a quality-control problem. 
A company outsider probably doesn’t see these numbers, but inter-
nal management financial reports show this information. A dramatic 
increase in this number is usually a red flag for company management.
Cost of goods sold
A company tracks the costs directly related to the sale of goods or services 
in cost of goods sold accounts. The details are usually found only on inter-
nally distributed income statements and aren’t distributed to company 
outsiders. Cost of goods sold is usually shown as a single line item, but it 
includes the transactions from all these accounts:
 
✓ Purchases: This account tracks the cost of merchandise a company 
buys. A manufacturing company has a very extensive tracking system 
for its cost of goods that includes accounts for items like raw materials, 
components, and labor that are used to produce the final product.
 
✓ Purchase discounts: This account tracks any cost savings a company 
is able to negotiate because of accelerated payment plans or volume 
buying. For example, if a vendor offers a 2 percent discount when a cus-
tomer pays an invoice within 10 days rather than the normal 30 days, 
the vendor tracks this cost saving in purchase discounts.
 
✓ Purchase returns and allowances: This account tracks any transactions 
involving the return of any damaged or defective products to the manu-
facturer or vendor.
 
✓ Freight charges: This account tracks the costs of shipping the goods sold.
Expense accounts
Any costs not directly related to generating revenue are considered expenses. 
Expenses fall into four categories: operating, interest, depreciation or amorti-
zation, and taxes. A large company can have hundreds of expense accounts, 
so I don’t name each one but give you a broad overview of the types of 
expense accounts that fall into each of these categories:
 
✓ Operating expenses: The largest share of expense accounts falls under 
the umbrella of operating expenses, which include advertising, dues 
and subscriptions, equipment rental, store rental, insurance, legal and 

57
 Chapter 4: Digging into Accounting Basics
accounting fees, meals, entertainment, salaries, office expenses, postage, 
repairs and maintenance, supplies, travel, telephone, utilities, vehicle 
expenses, and just about anything else that goes into the cost of operat-
ing a business and isn’t directly related to selling a company’s products.
 
✓ Interest expenses: Interest paid on a company’s debt is reflected in the 
accounts for interest expenses — from credit cards, loans, bonds, or any 
other type of debt the company may carry.
 
✓ Depreciation and amortization expenses: I discuss how depreciation is 
calculated in “Digging into depreciation and amortization,” earlier in this 
chapter. The process for amortization is similar. The amount written off 
each year for any type of asset is tracked in the depreciation and amorti-
zation accounts, and the expenses related to depreciation and amortiza-
tion in each individual year are shown on the income statement.
 
✓ Taxes: A company pays numerous types of taxes. Sales taxes aren’t 
listed in the expense area because they’re paid by customers and 
accrued as a liability until paid. Taxes withheld from employee pay-
checks are also accrued as a liability and aren’t listed as an expense.
 
 The types of taxes that are expenses for a company include the employ-
er’s half of Social Security and Medicare taxes; unemployment taxes and 
other related payroll taxes that vary depending on state; and corporate 
taxes, if the company has incorporated. Businesses that aren’t incorpo-
rated don’t have to pay taxes on income. Instead, the owners report that 
income on their personal tax returns. I talk more about taxes and com-
pany structure in Chapter 3.
Differentiating Profit Types
A company doesn’t actually make different kinds of profits, but it has dif-
ferent ways to track a profit and compare its results with those of similar 
companies. The three key profit types are gross profit, operating profit, and 
net profit. In Chapter 11, I discuss how these profit types are used to test a 
company’s viability.
Gross profit
The gross profit reflects the revenue earned minus any direct costs of gener-
ating that revenue, such as costs related to the purchases or production of 
goods before any expenses, including operating, taxes, interest, deprecia-
tion, and amortization. The gross profit isn’t actually part of the Chart of 
Accounts. You calculate the number for the income statement to show the 
profit made by a company before expenses.

58
Part I: Getting Down to Financial Reporting Basics 
Operating profit
The operating profit is the next profit figure you see on the income statement. 
This number measures a company’s earning power from its ongoing opera-
tions. The operating profit is calculated by subtracting operating expenses 
from gross profit. Some companies include depreciation and amortization 
expenses in this calculation, calling this line item EBIT, or earnings before 
interest and taxes.
 
Others add an additional line called EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, 
depreciation, and amortization. Accountants started using EBITDA in the 1980s 
because it provided analysts a number they could use to compare profitability 
among companies and it eliminated the effects of financing and accounting.
Interest is a financial decision. A company has the choice to finance new 
product development or other major projects by selling bonds, taking loans, 
or issuing stock. If the company chooses to raise money using bonds or 
loans, it has to pay interest. Money raised by issuing stock doesn’t have inter-
est costs. I talk more about this difference and the impact on a company’s 
profits in Chapter 11.
Taxes, believe it or not, are also an accounting game. Most corporations 
report different tax numbers on their financial statements than they actually 
pay to the government because of various tax write-offs they’re able to use to 
reduce their tax bill.
 
Companies don’t actually pay out cash for depreciation and amortization 
expenses. Instead, depreciation and amortization are an accounting require-
ment that comes into play when determining the value of assets.
Net profit
Net profit is the bottom line after all costs, expenses, interest, taxes, depre-
ciation, and amortization have been deducted. Net profit reflects how much 
money a company makes. If the company isn’t incorporated, it can pay out 
the profit to shareholders or company owners, or it can reinvest the money 
in growing itself. Firms add reinvested money to the retained earnings 
account on the balance sheet.

Annual Reports

In this part . . .
Y
ou can’t analyze a financial report until you under-
stand all its pieces. In this part, I help you put 
together the puzzle of financial reporting. I delve into the 
key financial statements — the balance sheet, income 
statement, and statement of cash flows. I also explore the 
other parts of an annual report, particularly how to read 
the fine print in the notes to the financial statements. In 
addition, I discuss what makes up consolidated financial 
statements.

Chapter 5
Exploring the Anatomy 
of an Annual Report
In This Chapter
▶ Getting acquainted with the parts of the annual report
▶ Looking at the three most important documents
▶ Summing up the financial information
N
o doubt the financial statements are the meat of any annual report, but 
lots of trimmings make up an annual report, and you need to be able 
to read and understand them. Although companies must follow set rules for 
how they format the key financial statements, how they present the rest of 
the report is left to their creativity.
Some companies spend millions of dollars putting on a glossy show with 
color pictures throughout the report. Others just put out a plain-vanilla, 
black-and-white version without pictures. But the major components of an 
annual report are standard, though the order in which companies present 
them may vary.
 
When you see a fat, glossy annual report from a company, you can be cer-
tain that you’ll find a lot of fluff in it and probably a lot of spin about all the 
good things that the company accomplished. No matter how fancy or plain 
the annual report is, as a careful reader, you need to focus on four key parts, 
listed in order:
 
✓ Auditors’ report: A statement by the auditors regarding the findings of 
their audit of the company’s books.
 
✓ Financial statements: These include the balance sheet, income state-
ment, and the statement of cash flows.

62
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
 
✓ Notes to the financial statements: The notes give additional information 
about the data in the financial statements.
 
✓ Management’s discussion and analysis: Management gives its perspec-
tive regarding the company’s results.
In this chapter, I explain why these four parts of an annual report are so criti-
cal. I also define the other parts of an annual report and their purposes.
Everything but the Numbers
Most people think of numbers when they hear the words “annual report,” 
but any savvy investor can find a lot more useful information in the report 
than just numbers. Some parts of the report are fluff pieces written for public 
consumption, but others can give you great insight into the company’s pros-
pects, as well as some areas of management concern. You just need to be a 
detective: Read between the lines, and read the fine print.
Debunking the letter to shareholders
What would an annual report be if not an opportunity for the head honchos 
to tout their company’s fabulousness? Near the front of most annual reports, 
you find a letter to the shareholders from the chief executive officer (CEO) 
and the chairman of the board; other key executives may have signed their 
names, too.
Don’t put too much stock in this letter, no matter how appealing it looks and 
how exciting its message is. Very few CEOs actually write the letter to share-
holders; the company’s public relations department usually carefully designs 
the letter to highlight the positive aspects of the company’s year. Negative 
results, when mentioned at all, are typically hidden in the middle of a para-
graph somewhere in the middle of the letter.
In these letters, you usually find information about the key business activities 
for the year, such as a general statement about the company’s financial con-
dition, performance summaries of key divisions or subsidiaries that were the 
shining stars, and what the company’s major prospects are.
 
Don’t let these letters fool you. They will focus on the positive news and try 
to minimize the bad news. Do read the company’s optimistic view, but don’t 
depend on this letter to make a decision about whether you should invest in 
the company. You can find more definitive information in other parts of the 
report that can help you make investment decisions.

63
 Chapter 5: Exploring the Anatomy of an Annual Report
Making sense of the corporate message
After the letter to shareholders but before the juicy information, you usually 
find more rah-rah text in the form of a summary about the company’s key 
achievements throughout the year. Like the president’s letter, these pages 
present more of the type of message the corporation wants to portray, which 
may or may not give you the true picture. Few companies include much 
information about negative results in this section. Often chock-full of glossy, 
colorful images, this section is pure public relations fluff that focuses on the 
year’s top performance highlights.
 
Although you may enjoy the pictures, don’t count on the info printed around 
them to help you make any decisions about the company. Even if a company 
doesn’t use pretty color pictures, this section usually includes bold graphics 
and lots of headlines that focus on the successes. Don’t expect to find any 
warning signs in this image-setting section.
Although this section is basically advertising, it may give you a good over-
view of what the company does and the key parts of its operations. The firm 
will present its key divisions or units, what the top products are within these 
Translating the language of letters to shareholders
Maintaining a long and proud tradition, let-
ters to shareholders present companies in 
the best possible light using a positive spin to 
hide whatever trouble may lie under the sur-
face. A careless reader may feel reassured 
by the everything’s-hunky-dory tone, but a few 
often-used niceties may indicate that things 
aren’t what they seem and can tip off careful 
readers.
 ✓ “Challenging” is frequently used when a 
company is facing significant difficulties 
selling its product or service.
 ✓ “Restructuring” means something isn’t 
working. Be sure to find out what that 
something is and how much the company 
is spending to fix the problem.
 ✓ Sometimes, letters to shareholders gloss 
over mistakes by using a phrase like “cor-
rective actions are being taken.” Look for 
details about the cause and plan for cor-
rective actions in the notes to the financial 
statements or management’s discussion 
and analysis sections.
 ✓ If you come across the term “difficulties,” 
look for details about the difficulties high-
lighted in the management’s discussion 
and analysis or notes to the financial state-
ments.
The best place to find full details on these 
issues is in the notes to the financial statements 
or the management’s discussion and analysis. 
For more on these sections, go to “Getting the 
skinny from management” and “Reading the 
notes,” later in this chapter.

divisions, and a brief summary of the financial results of the top divisions. In 
addition, you usually find some discussion of market share and position in 
the market of the company’s key products or services.
Meeting the people in charge
Want to find out who’s running the place? After the corporate message, one 
or two pages list the members of the board of directors and, sometimes, a 
brief bio of each member. You also find a listing of top executives or manag-
ers and their responsibilities. If you want to complain to someone at the top, 
this is the place where you can find out where to send your letters!
But seriously, reviewing the backgrounds of the company’s leaders can help 
you get an idea of the experience these leaders bring to the company. If they 
don’t impress you, that may be a good sign that you should walk away from 
the investment.
Finding basic shareholder information
At the end of the key financial statements, you usually find a statement of 
shareholders’ equity, which is a summary of changes to shareholders’ equity 
over the past three years. The key parts of this statement for current-year 
results are in the equity section of the balance sheet (one of the key financial 
statements that I talk about in greater detail in Chapter 6). This information 
is good to know because you can get an overview of changes to sharehold-
ers’ equity over the past three years, but you don’t need this information for 
analyzing a company’s prospects. When I show you how to analyze results 
by using information about shareholders’ equity, I use numbers that you can 
find on the balance sheet.
Getting the skinny from management
The management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) is one of the most impor-
tant sections of an annual report. The MD&A may not be the most fun section 
to look at, but in it you find the key discussions about what went smoothly 
over the year as well as what went wrong.
 
Read the MD&A section carefully. It has a lot of the meat-and-potatoes infor-
mation that gives you details about how the company’s doing.

65
 Chapter 5: Exploring the Anatomy of an Annual Report
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) monitors the MD&A section 
closely to make sure that companies present all critical information about 
current operations, capital, and liquidity. Management must also include for-
ward-looking statements about known market and economic trends that may 
impact the company’s liquidity and material events, as well as uncertainties 
that may cause reported information to not necessarily reflect future operat-
ing results or future financial conditions. For example, if a company manufac-
tures its products in a country that’s facing political upheaval or labor strife, 
those conditions may impact the company’s ability to continue manufactur-
ing its products at the same low cost. The company must report this informa-
tion, indicating how this situation may impact its future earning potential.
The SEC pays special attention to a number of key factors that the MD&A is 
supposed to cover, including
 
✓ Revenue recognition: In a retail store, recognizing revenue can be a 
relatively straightforward process: A customer buys a product off the 
shelves, and the revenue is recognized — that is, recorded in the com-
pany’s books. But things aren’t that cut-and-dried in many complex 
corporate deals. For example, in the computer and hardware industry, 
revenue recognition can be complex because purchase contracts fre-
quently include multiple parts such as software, hardware, services, and 
training. When the revenue is actually recognized for each of these parts 
can vary, depending on the terms of a contract.
 
 When reading financial reports for a particular industry, reviewing how 
management describes its revenue recognition process compared to 
similar companies in the same industry is important.
 
✓ Restructuring charges: When a company restructures a portion of 
itself — which can include shutting down factories, disbanding a major 
division, or enacting other major changes related to how the company 
operates — management discusses the impact this had on the company 
(or may have in the future). Costs for employee severance, facility shut-
downs, and other expenses related to restructuring are explained in this 
portion of the report.
 
✓ Impairments to assets: The SEC expects companies to report any losses 
to assets in a timely manner. If an asset is damaged, destroyed, or for 
any reason loses value, companies must report that loss to sharehold-
ers. Look for information about the loss of value to assets in the MD&A. 
Also look for information about the depreciation or amortization of these 
assets (see Chapter 4 for more details on depreciation and amortization).
 
✓ Pension plans: Accounting for pension plans includes many assump-
tions, such as the amount of interest or other gains the company 
expects to make on the assets held in its pension plans and the expenses 

66
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
the company anticipates paying out when employees retire. If the com-
pany has a pension plan for its employees, you should find discussion 
about how the company finances this plan and whether it expects to 
have difficulty meeting its plan’s requirements.
 
✓ Environmental and product liabilities: All companies face some liabil-
ity for products that fail to operate as expected or products that could 
cause damage to an individual or property. In some industries — such 
as oil, gas, and chemicals — an error can cause considerable environ-
mental damage. You’ve probably heard stories about a chemical spill 
destroying a local stream or drinking water supply, or an oil spill wiping 
out an area’s entire ecological system. In the MD&A section, the com-
pany must acknowledge the liabilities it faces and the way it prepares 
financially for the possibility of taking a loss after the liability is paid. 
The company must estimate its potential losses and disclose the amount 
of money it has set aside or the insurance it has to protect against such 
losses.
 
✓ Stock-based compensation: In order to attract and keep top execu-
tives, many companies offer stock incentives (such as shares of stock as 
bonuses) as part of an employee compensation package. This part of 
the annual report must mention details of any stock-based compensa-
tion. Many recent scandals have included disclosures of unusually lavish 
stock-based compensation programs for top executives. Keep a watchful 
eye (or ear) out for discussion of bonuses or other employee compensa-
tion that involves giving employees shares of stock or selling employees’ 
shares of stock below the market value.
 
✓ Allowance for doubtful accounts: Any company that offers credit to 
customers will encounter some nonpayers in the group. Management 
must discuss what it allows for loss on accounts that aren’t paid and 
whether this allowance increased or decreased from the previous year. 
An increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts may indicate a prob-
lem with collections or be a sign of significant problems in the industry 
as a whole.
 
The discussion in this section of the annual report can get very technical. If 
you find things you don’t understand, you can always make a call to the inves-
tor relations department to ask for clarification. Whenever you’re considering 
a major investment in a company’s stock, be certain that you understand the 
key points being discussed in the MD&A. Anytime you find the information 
beyond your comprehension, don’t hesitate to research further and ask a lot 
of questions before investing in the stock.
In the MD&A, managers focus on three key areas: company operations, capi-
tal resources, and liquidity.

67
 Chapter 5: Exploring the Anatomy of an Annual Report
Company operations
Management commentary on this topic focuses on the income generated by, 
and expenses related to, the company’s operations. To get some idea of how 
well the company may perform in the future, look for
 
✓ Discussion about whether sales increased or decreased
 
✓ Details about how well the company’s various product lines performed
 
✓ Explanations of economic or market conditions that may have impacted 
the company’s performance
The MD&A section also discusses
 
✓ Distribution systems: How products are distributed.
 
✓ Product improvements: Changes to products that improve their perfor-
mance or appearance.
 
✓ Manufacturing capacity: The number of manufacturing plants and their 
production capability. The MD&A also mentions the percentage of the 
company’s manufacturing capacity that it’s using. For example, if the 
firm uses only 50 percent of its manufacturing capacity, that may be an 
indication that it has lots of extra resources that are idle. If the company 
is using 100 percent of its manufacturing capacity, that may indicate that 
it has maxed out its resources and may need to expand.
 
✓ Research and development projects: The research or development the 
business is doing to develop new products or improve current products.
The manager also comments on key profit results and how they may differ 
from the previous year’s projections. You should also look for cost informa-
tion related to product manufacturing or purchase. Cost-control problems 
can mean that future results may not be as good as the current year’s, espe-
cially if management mentions that the cost of raw materials isn’t stable. 
Look for statements about interest expenses, major competition, inflation, or 
other factors that may impact the success of future operations.
Capital resources
A company’s capital resources are its assets and its ability to fund its opera-
tions for the long term. In addition to a statement that the company is in a 
strong financial position, you find discussions about
 
✓ Acquisitions or major expansion plans
 
✓ Any major capital expenses carried out over the past year or planned in 
future years

68
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
 
✓ Company debt
 
✓ Plans the company may have for taking on new debt
 
✓ Other key points about the company’s cash flow
Liquidity
A company’s liquidity is its cash position and its ability to pay its bills on a 
short-term or day-to-day basis. I cover how to analyze liquidity in Chapters 
12, 15, and 16.
Bringing the auditors’ answers to light
Any publicly traded company must provide financial reports that have been 
audited by outside auditors. (I talk more about the audit process in Chapter 
18.) You usually find the auditors’ report (a letter from the auditors to the 
company’s board of directors and shareholders) before the financial informa-
tion or immediately following it.
 
Before you read the financial statements or the notes to the financial state-
ments, be sure that you’ve read the auditors’ report. You read the auditors’ 
report first to find out whether the auditor raised any red flags about the 
company’s financial results and what those questions are. But you won’t find 
answers to these questions in the auditors’ report. To find the details, you 
need to read the MD&A, financial statements, and the notes to the financial 
statements. But if you haven’t read the auditors’ report first, you could over-
look some critical details.
To lend credibility to management’s assurances, companies call in inde-
pendent auditors from an outside accounting firm to audit their internal 
controls and financial statements. Auditors don’t check every transaction, 
so their reports don’t provide you 100 percent assurance that the financial 
statements don’t include misstatements about the company’s assets and 
liabilities. Auditors don’t endorse the company’s financial position or give 
indications about whether the company is a good investment.
Most standard auditors’ reports include these three paragraphs:
 
✓ Introductory paragraph: Here you find information about the time 
period that the audit covers and who’s responsible for the financial 
statements. In most cases, this paragraph states that management is 
responsible for the financial statements and that the auditors only 
express an opinion about the financial statements based on their audit. 
Essentially, this is a “protect-your-fanny” paragraph where the auditors 
attempt to limit their responsibility for possible inaccuracies.

69
 Chapter 5: Exploring the Anatomy of an Annual Report
 
✓ Scope paragraph: In this paragraph, the auditors describe how they 
carried out the audit, including a statement that they used the generally 
accepted audit standards. These standards require that auditors plan 
and prepare their audit to be reasonably sure that the financial state-
ments are free of material misstatements. A material misstatement is an 
error that significantly impacts the company’s financial position, such as 
reporting revenue before it’s actually earned.
 
✓ Opinion paragraph: Here the auditors state their opinion of the financial 
statements. If the auditors don’t find any problems with the statements, 
they simply say that these statements are prepared “in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles” (or GAAP). For more on 
GAAP, see Chapter 2.
When an auditors’ report follows the outline I describe here, it’s called a stan-
dard auditors’ report. And because no qualifiers (or red flags) limit the audi-
tors’ opinions, it’s also an unqualified audit report.
If the auditors find a problem, the report is a nonstandard auditors’ report. In a 
nonstandard report, auditors must explain their opinions in a qualified audit 
report — in other words, they qualify their opinions and note problem areas. 
(I discuss possible problems auditors may encounter later in this section.) A 
nonstandard auditors’ report and a standard auditors’ report have the same 
structure; the only difference is that the nonstandard report includes infor-
mation about the problems the auditors found.
 
When you see a nonstandard auditors’ report, be sure that you find a discus-
sion of the problems in the MD&A and in the notes to the financial statements. 
Also, when reading the MD&A, be certain that you understand how manage-
ment is handling the problems noted by the auditors and how these problems 
may impact the company’s long-term financial prospects before you invest 
your hard-earned dollars. (Call the investor relations department to ask for 
clarification, if you need to.) If you’ve already invested, look carefully at the 
issues to be sure you want to continue holding your stock in the company.
A nonstandard auditors’ report may include paragraphs that discuss prob-
lems that the auditors found, such as the following:
 
✓ Work performed by a different auditor: In many cases, this isn’t a 
major problem. Maybe a different auditor handled the audit in previous 
years or audited a subsidiary of a newly acquired company. But when-
ever a company changes auditors, you need to know why it made the 
change, and you should research the issue. You probably won’t find the 
reason for the change in the annual report, so you may have to research 
the change in news reports or analysts’ reports. Because changing audi-
tors can negatively impact a firm’s stock price, companies are usually 

70
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
very careful about changing auditors. Wall Street typically gets con-
cerned whenever a change of auditors occurs because it can be a sign of 
a major accounting problem that hasn’t surfaced yet.
 
✓ Accounting policy changes: If a company decides to change its account-
ing policies or how it applies an accounting method, the auditors must 
note the change in a nonstandard auditors’ report. These changes may 
not indicate a problem, and if the auditors agree that the company had 
a good reason for making the change, you most likely have no reason for 
concern. For example, if the company changed how it reported an asset 
because that change is required by the SEC, that’s a good reason for 
making the change.
 
 If the auditors disagree with the company’s decision to change account-
ing methods, they question the change and provide a qualified opinion 
(which I discuss later in this section) in the nonstandard auditors’ 
report. If their report indicates a change in accounting policy, be sure to 
look in the notes portion of the annual report for the full explanation of 
the change and how it could impact the financial statements. When com-
panies change an accounting policy or method, the change impacts your 
ability to compare the previous year’s results to the current year’s.
 
✓ Material uncertainties: If the auditors find an area of uncertainty, it’s 
impossible for management or the auditors to determine the potential 
financial consequences of an event. Uncertainties may include debt-
agreement violations, damages the company must pay if it loses a 
pending lawsuit, or the loss of a major customer or market share. If the 
auditors believe that these material uncertainties could impact future 
earnings, they’ll include a paragraph about the uncertainty and give a 
qualified opinion.
 
 If a loss is probable and the auditors can estimate it, the financial state-
ments usually reflect this loss, and the auditors give an unqualified opin-
ion. So in reality, the impact of a known loss can be a greater problem 
than a possible loss where the consequences are unknown. The com-
pany and the auditors have a responsibility to make you aware of the 
uncertainty so you can factor that into any decisions you make about 
your potential dealings with, or investment in, the company.
 
✓ Going-concern problems: If the auditors have substantial doubt that 
the company has the ability to stay in business, they’ll indicate that the 
company has a going-concern problem. Problems that can lead to this 
type of paragraph in the auditors’ report include ongoing losses, capital 
deficiencies, or a significant contract dispute. If you see a statement by 
the auditors that the company has a going-concern problem, it’s a major 
red flag and a good indication that you shouldn’t invest in this company.
 
✓ Specific disclosures: Sometimes auditors indicate concerns about a 
specific financial matter but still give the company a nonqualified opin-
ion. Many times the auditor believes that these are matters the public 

71
 Chapter 5: Exploring the Anatomy of an Annual Report
should know about but aren’t signs of a serious problem. For example, if 
the company is doing business with another company that has officers 
involved in both firms, the auditor may note this issue in a special para-
graph. The notes to the financial statements explain any specific disclo-
sure in greater detail.
 
✓ Qualified opinions: Any time the auditors issue a nonstandard report, 
they also issue a qualified opinion in the final paragraph of the report. A 
qualified opinion doesn’t always mean that you should be alarmed, but 
it does mean that you should do additional research to make sure you 
understand the qualification. Sometimes a qualified opinion may simply 
indicate that the auditors didn’t have sufficient information available 
at the time of the audit to determine whether the issue raised will have 
a significant financial impact on the company. You should look in the 
notes to the financial statements or the MD&A for any explanation of the 
matter that caused the auditors to issue a qualified opinion.
Presenting the Financial Picture
The main course of any annual report is the financial statements. In this part, 
you find out what the company owns, what the company owes, how much 
revenue it took in, what expenses it paid out, and how much profit it made 
or how much it lost. I cover each of the following statements in great detail 
throughout the book, so I mention them briefly here and indicate in which 
chapters you can find additional information.
 
When looking at a company’s financial results, make sure that you’re compar-
ing periods of similar length or a similar collection of months. For example, 
a retail store usually has much better results in the last quarter of the year 
(from October to December) because of the holiday season than it does in the 
first quarter (from January to March). Comparing these two quarters doesn’t 
make sense when you’re trying to determine how well a business is doing. To 
judge a retail company’s growth prospects, compare the fourth quarter of one 
year with the fourth quarter of another year. I talk more about income state-
ments in Chapter 7 and tell you how to analyze these statements in Part III.
 
✓ Balance sheet: Also known as the statement of financial position, this 
document gives a snapshot of a company’s assets and liabilities at 
a specific point in time. I discuss all the parts of the balance sheet in 
Chapter 6, and I talk about analyzing the financial reports in Part III.
 
✓ Income statement: Also known as the profit and loss statement or P&L 
statement, this document reviews a company’s operations over a specific 
amount of time. This period can last for one month, one quarter, six 
months, one year, or any other period indicated at the top of the state-
ment. I discuss the income statement in Chapter 7 and how to analyze 
the statement in Part III.

72
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
 
✓ Statement of cash flows: This document discusses the actual flow of cash 
into and out of the company. The statement has three sections focus-
ing on changes to cash status from operations, from investing, and from 
financing. Like the income statement, the statement of cash flows reflects 
results over a specific period of time. I discuss this statement in greater 
detail in Chapter 8, and I talk about cash-flow analysis in Chapter 13.
Summarizing the Financial Data
Knowing that most people won’t spend the time reading all the way through 
the annual report, many companies summarize their numbers in various 
ways. The two most common ways to summarize are to highlight the finan-
cial data presented in the financial statements and to summarize some key 
information in the notes to the financial statements. But beware: Most sum-
maries highlight the good news and skip over the bad.
Finding the highlights
The highlights to the financial data summarize the financial results for the 
year being reported. Typically, this summary is called the financial highlights, 
but companies can be creative because this section isn’t a required part of 
the report. And because the highlights aren’t required, they’re not always 
presented according to GAAP rules, so don’t count on their accuracy. You 
usually find the financial highlights at the front of the annual report, after 
the letter from the CEO and chairman of the board. Some companies include 
them inside the annual report’s back cover.
 
You frequently find financial highlights at the front of the annual report, 
designed in a graphically pleasing way. Most companies show either a 10-year 
or 11-year summary that doesn’t include much detail but allows you to see the 
firm’s growth trends. Although this type of summary can be a good historical 
overview, don’t count on it. Instead, do your own research of the company’s 
financial history to be sure that you’re aware of both the good and bad news. 
Remember that even outstanding companies have some bad years that they 
want to gloss over.

73
 Chapter 5: Exploring the Anatomy of an Annual Report
Reading the notes
The notes to the financial statements is the section where you find any warts 
on a company’s financial record. The notes are a required part of the annual 
report, and they give you the details behind the numbers presented in the 
financial statements. Companies like to hide their problems in the notes; in 
fact, most companies even print this part of the annual report in smaller type.
Most of the details in the notes discuss the impact that the following busi-
ness aspects may have on the company’s future financial health:
 
✓ Accounting methods used
 
✓ Changes to accounting methods
 
✓ Key financial commitments that can impact current and future 
operations
 
✓ Lease obligations
 
✓ Pension and retirement benefits
If any red flags pop up in a company’s annual report, this part is where you 
can find the financial details and explanations. The auditors’ report probably 
highlights any potential problems and red flags that you should search for 
in the notes. You may also find problems mentioned in the MD&A section, 
but the full explanations for these problems are probably covered in greater 
detail in the notes section.
 
Don’t get turned off by the visually unpleasing presentation. The notes to the 
financial statements is one of the most critical parts of the annual report. I 
cover the importance of the notes in more detail in Chapter 9.

Chapter 6
Balancing Assets against 
Liabilities and Equity
In This Chapter
▶ Defining assets, liabilities, and equity
▶ Exploring the basics of balance sheets
▶ Reviewing assets
▶ Understanding liabilities
▶ Examining equity
P
icture a tightrope walker carefully making her way across a tightrope. 
As if that isn’t challenging enough, imagine that she’s carrying plates 
of equal weight on both sides of a wobbling rod. What would happen if one 
of those plates were heavier than the other? You don’t have to understand 
squat about physics to know that it isn’t gonna be a pretty sight.
Just as the tightrope walker must be in balance, so must a company’s finan-
cial position. If the assets aren’t equal to the claims against those assets, then 
that company’s financial position isn’t in balance, and everything topples 
over. In this chapter, I introduce you to the balance sheet, which gives the 
financial report reader a snapshot of a company’s financial position.
Understanding the Balance Equation
A company keeps track of its financial balance on a balance sheet, which is a 
summary of the company’s financial standing at a particular point in time. To 
understand balance sheets, you first have to understand the following terms, 
which typically appear on a balance sheet:

76
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
 
✓ Assets: Anything the company owns, from cash to inventory to the 
paper it prints the reports on
 
✓ Liabilities: Debts the company owes
 
✓ Equity: Claims made by the company’s owners, such as shares of stock
The assets a company owns are equal to the claims against that company, 
either by debtors (liability) or owners (equity). The claims side must equal 
the assets side for the balance sheet to stay in balance. The parts always bal-
ance according to this formula:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
As a company and its assets grow, its liabilities and equities grow in similar 
proportion. For example, whenever a company buys a major asset, such as 
a building, it has to either use another asset to pay for the building or use a 
combination of assets and liabilities (such as bonds or a mortgage) or equity 
(owner’s money or outstanding shares of stock).
Introducing the Balance Sheet
Trying to read a balance sheet without having a grasp of its parts is a little 
like trying to translate a language you’ve never spoken — you may recognize 
the letters, but the words don’t mean much. Unlike a foreign language, how-
ever, a balance sheet is pretty easy to get a fix on as soon as you figure out a 
few basics.
Digging into dates
The first things you should notice when looking at the financial statements 
are the dates indicated at the top of the statements. You need to know what 
date or what period of time the financial statements cover. This information 
is particularly critical when you start comparing results among companies. 
You don’t want to compare the 2008 results of one firm with the 2007 results 
of another. Economic conditions certainly vary, and the comparison doesn’t 
give you an accurate view of how well the companies competed in similar 
economic conditions.
On a balance sheet, the date at the top is written after “As of,” meaning that 
the balance sheet reports a company’s financial status on that particular day. 
A balance sheet differs from other kinds of financial statements, such as the 
income statement or statement of cash flows, which show information for a 
period of time such as a year, a quarter, or a month. I discuss income state-
ments in Chapter 7 and statements of cash flows in Chapter 8.

77
 Chapter 6: Balancing Assets against Liabilities and Equity
If a company’s balance sheet states “As of December 31, 2008,” the company 
is most likely operating on the calendar year. Not all firms end their business 
year at the end of the calendar year, however. Many companies operate on a 
fiscal year instead, which means they pick a 12-month period that more accu-
rately reflects their business cycles. For example, most retail companies end 
their fiscal year on January 31. The best time of year for major retail sales is 
during the holiday season and post-holiday season, so stores close the books 
after those periods end.
To show you how economic conditions can make it very difficult to compare 
the balance sheets of two companies during two different fiscal years, I’ll 
use as an example the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. If one com-
pany’s fiscal year runs from September 1 to August 31 and another’s runs 
from January 1 to December 31, the results could be very different. The 
company that reports from September 1, 2000, to August 31, 2001, wouldn’t 
be impacted by that devastating event on its 2000/2001 financial reports. 
Its holiday-season sales from October 2000 to December 2000 would likely 
be much different from those of the company that reports from January 1, 
2001, to December 31, 2001, because those results would include sales after 
September 11, when the economy slowed considerably. However, the first 
company’s balance sheet for September 1, 2001, to August 31, 2002, would 
show the full impact of the attacks on its financial position.
When a year is more than a year
Things can get confusing if a company picks a 
certain point in time rather than an actual date 
for its fiscal year. For example, a company can 
decide to end its fiscal year on the last Friday 
of a particular month, which means its fiscal 
year will sometimes be 52 weeks and some-
times be 53 weeks. If a firm chooses a point in 
time rather than a year-end or month-end date, 
you usually find an explanation in the notes to 
the financial statements about how it handles 
its 52- and 53-week years, which can get very 
convoluted.
For example, Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon 
explained its 52- and 53-week years when it 
released its unaudited fiscal-year 2002 earnings 
and fourth-quarter results like this:
 
 “Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon, Inc. . . . 
announced preliminary unaudited operat-
ing results for the 17-week fourth quarter 
and 53-week fiscal year ended December 
31, 2002. The company operates on a 52- or 
53-week fiscal year ending the last Tuesday 
in December, and fiscal 2002 included 53 
weeks, and the fourth quarter, 17 weeks, as 
compared to 52 and 16 weeks, respectively, 
for fiscal 2001.”
Looking at this convoluted paragraph, you can 
see the complications of a fiscal year ending on 
a set period in time rather than on the last day 
of a month. Comparing a 16-week quarter with a 
17-week quarter can be misleading, as an extra 
week of sales is certainly going to look better.

78
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
Nailing down the numbers
As you start reading the financial reports of large corporations, you see that 
they don’t use large numbers to show billion-dollar results (1,000,000,000) 
or carry off an amount to the last possible cent, such as 1,123,456,789.99. 
Imagine how difficult it would be to read such detailed financial statements!
At the top of a balance sheet or any other financial report, you see a statement 
indicating that the numbers are in millions, thousands, or however the com-
pany decides to round the numbers. For example, if a billion-dollar company 
indicates that numbers are in millions, you see 1 billion represented as 1,000 
and 35 million as 35. The 1,123,456,789.99 figure would be shown as 1,123.
 
Rounding off numbers makes a report easier on the eye, but be sure you know 
how companies are rounding their numbers before you start comparing finan-
cial statements among them. This is particularly crucial when you compare a 
large company with a smaller one. The large company may round to millions, 
whereas the smaller company rounds to thousands.
Figuring out format
Balance sheets come in three different styles: the account format, the report 
format, and the financial position format. I show you a sample of each format 
in the following figures, using very simple numbers to give you an idea of 
what you can expect to see. Of course, real balance sheets have much larger 
and more complex numbers.
Account format
The account format is a horizontal presentation of the numbers, as Figure 6-1 
shows.

Financial position format
The financial position format, which is rarely used in the U.S., is commonly 
used internationally, especially in Europe. The key difference between this 
format and the other two is that it has two lines that don’t appear on the 
account and report formats:
 
✓ Working capital: This line is the current assets the company has avail-
able to pay bills. You find the working capital by subtracting the current 
assets from the current liabilities.
 
✓ Net assets: This line shows what’s left for the company’s owners after all 
liabilities have been subtracted from total assets.
Figure 6-3 shows you what the financial position format looks like. (Keep in 
mind that noncurrent assets are long-term assets as well as assets that aren’t cur-
rent but also aren’t long term, such as stock ownership in another company.)
 
As investing becomes more globalized, you may start comparing U.S. com-
panies with foreign companies. Or perhaps you may consider buying stock 
directly in European or other foreign companies. You need to become more 
familiar with the financial position format if you want to read reports from for-
eign companies. I take a closer look at regulations for foreign company report-
ing in Chapter 20.

Ogling Assets
Anything a company owns is considered an asset. This can include some-
thing as basic as cash or as massive as a factory. A company must have 
assets in order to operate the business. The asset side of a balance sheet 
gives you a summary of what the company owns.
Current assets
Anything a company owns that it can convert to cash in less than a year is a 
current asset. Without these funds, the company wouldn’t be able to pay its 
bills and would have to close its doors. Cash, of course, is an important com-
ponent of this part of the balance sheet, but other assets are used during the 
year to pay the bills.
Cash
For companies, cash is basically the same thing you carry around in your 
pocket or keep in your checking and savings accounts. Keeping track of the 
money is a lot more complex for companies, however, because they usually 
keep it in many different locations. Every multimillion-dollar corporation has 
numerous locations, and every location needs cash.
Even in a centralized accounting system, in which all bills are paid in the same 
place and all money is collected and put in the bank at the same time, a com-
pany keeps cash in more than one location. Keeping most of the money in the 
bank and having a little cash on hand for incidental expenses doesn’t work 
for most companies.
For example, retail outlets or banks need to keep cash in every cash register 
or under the control of every teller to be able to transact business with their 
customers. Yet a company must have a way of tracking its cash and know-
ing exactly how much it has at the end of every day (and sometimes several 

81
 Chapter 6: Balancing Assets against Liabilities and Equity
times a day for high-volume businesses). The cash drawer must be counted 
out, and the person counting out the draw must show that the amount of 
cash matches up with the total that the day’s transactions indicate should 
be there.
If a company has a number of locations, each location likely needs a bank to 
deposit receipts and get cash as needed. So a large corporation is going to 
have a maze of bank accounts, cash registers, petty cash, and other places 
where cash is kept daily. At the end of every day, each company location cal-
culates the cash total and reports it to the centralized accounting area.
 
The amount of cash that you see on the balance sheet is the amount of cash 
found at all company locations on the particular day for which the balance 
sheet was created.
Managing cash is one of the hardest jobs because cash can so easily disap-
pear if proper internal controls aren’t in place. Internal controls for moni-
toring cash are usually among the strictest in any company. If this subject 
interests you, you can find out more about it in any basic accounting book, 
such as Accounting For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by John A. Tracy (published 
by Wiley).
Accounts receivable
Any company that allows its customers to buy on credit has an accounts 
receivable line on its balance sheet. Accounts receivable is a collection of indi-
vidual customer accounts listing money that customers owe the company for 
products or services they’ve already received.
A company must carefully monitor not only whether a customer pays but 
also how quickly she pays. If a customer makes her payments later and later, 
the company must determine whether to allow her to get additional credit 
or to block further purchases. Although the sales may look good, a nonpay-
ing customer hurts a company because he’s taking out — and failing to pay 
for — inventory that another customer could’ve bought. Too many nonpaying 
or late-paying customers can severely hurt a company’s cash-flow position, 
which means the firm may not have the cash it needs to pay the bills.
 
Comparing a company’s accounts receivable line over a number of years 
gives you a very good idea of how well the company is doing on collecting 
late-paying customers’ accounts. Although you may see a company report 
very positive sales numbers and a major increase in sales, if the accounts-
receivable number is also rising rapidly, the business may be having trouble 
collecting the money on those accounts. I show you how to analyze accounts 
receivable in Chapter 16.

Marketable securities
Marketable securities are a type of liquid asset, meaning they can easily be 
converted to cash. They include holdings such as stocks, bonds, and other 
securities that are bought and sold daily.
Securities that are bought by a company primarily as a place to hold onto 
assets until the company decides how to use the money for its operations or 
growth are considered trading securities. Marketable securities held as cur-
rent assets fit in this category. A company must report these assets at their 
fair value based on the market value of the stock or bond on the day the com-
pany prepares its financial report.
A firm must report any unrealized losses or gains — changes in the value of 
a holding that hasn’t been sold — on marketable securities on its balance 
sheet to show the impact of those losses or gains on the company’s earn-
ings. The amount you find on the balance sheet is the net marketable value, 
the book value of the securities adjusted for any gains or losses that haven’t 
been realized.
 
The balance sheet is the show for general consumption, but the notes to the 
financial statements are where you find the small print that most people don’t 
read. You find lots of juicy details in the notes that you shouldn’t miss. I talk 
more about the notes and their importance in Chapter 9.
Inventory
Any products held by a company ready for sale are considered inventory. 
The inventory on the balance sheet is valued at the cost to the company, not 
at the price the company hopes to sell the product for. Companies can pick 
from among five different methods to track inventory, and the method they 
choose can significantly impact the bottom line. Following are the different 
inventory tracking systems:
 
✓ First in, first out (FIFO): This system assumes that the oldest goods are 
sold first, and it’s used when a company is concerned about spoilage 
or obsolescence. Food stores use FIFO because items that sit on the 
shelves too long spoil. Computer firms use it because their products 
quickly become outdated, and they need to sell the older products first. 
Assuming that older goods cost less than newer goods, FIFO makes the 
bottom line look better because the lowest cost is assigned to the goods 
sold, increasing the net profit from sales.
 
✓ Last in, first out (LIFO): This system assumes that the newest inventory 
is sold first. Companies with products that don’t spoil or become obso-
lete can use this system. The bottom line can be significantly affected 
if the cost of goods to be sold is continually rising. The most expensive 
goods that come in last are assumed to be the first sold. LIFO increases 
the cost of goods figured, which in turn lowers the net income from 

83
 Chapter 6: Balancing Assets against Liabilities and Equity
sales and decreases a company’s tax liability because its profits are 
lower after the higher costs are subtracted. Hardware stores that sell 
hammers, nails, screws, and other items that have been the same for 
years and won’t spoil are good candidates for LIFO.
 
✓ Average costing: This system reflects the cost of inventory most accu-
rately and gives a company a good view of its inventory’s cost trends. 
As the company receives each new shipment of inventory, it calculates 
an average cost for each product by adding in the new inventory. If the 
firm is frequently faced with inventory prices that go up and down, aver-
age costing can help level out the peaks and valleys of inventory costs 
throughout the year. Because the price of gasoline rises and falls almost 
every day, gas stations usually use this type of system.
 
✓ Specific identification: This system tracks the actual cost of each indi-
vidual piece of inventory. Companies that sell big-ticket items or items 
with differing accessories or upgrades (such as cars) commonly use this 
system. For example, each car that comes onto the lot has a different set 
of features, so the price of each car differs.
 
✓ Lower of cost or market (LCM): This system sets the value of inventory 
based on which is lower — the actual cost of the products on hand or 
the current market value. Companies that sell products with market 
values that fluctuate significantly use this system. For instance, a broker-
age house that sells marketable securities may use this system.
 
You usually find some information about the type of inventory system a com-
pany uses in the notes to the financial statements. Any significant detail about 
inventory costs is discussed in the notes section or in the management’s dis-
cussion and analysis section.
 
After a company chooses a type of inventory system, it must use that system 
for the rest of its corporate life unless it files special explanations with its tax 
returns to explain the reasons for changing systems. Because the way compa-
nies track inventory costs can have a significant impact on the net income and 
the amount of taxes due, the IRS closely monitors any changes in inventory-
tracking methods.
Long-term assets
Assets that a company plans to hold for more than one year are placed in the 
long-term assets section of the balance sheet. Long-term assets include land 
and buildings; capitalized leases; leasehold improvements; machinery and 
equipment; furniture and fixtures; tools, dies, and molds; intangible assets; 
and others. This section of the balance sheet shows you the assets that a 
company has to build its products and sell its goods.

84
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
Land and buildings
Companies list any buildings they own on the balance sheet’s land and build-
ings line. Companies must depreciate (show that the asset is gradually being 
used up by deducting a portion of its value) the value of their buildings each 
year, but the land portion of ownership isn’t depreciated.
Many people believe that depreciating the value of a building actually results 
in undervaluing a company’s assets. The IRS allows 39 years for depreciation 
of a building, and after that time, the building is considered valueless. That 
may be true in many cases, such as factories that need to be updated to cur-
rent-day production methods, but a well-maintained office building usually 
lasts longer. A company that has owned a building for 20 or more years may, 
in fact, show the value of that building depreciated below its market value.
Real estate over the past 20 years has appreciated (gone up in value) greatly 
in most areas of the country. So instead of a building’s value going down 
because of depreciation, it may actually increase in value because of market 
appreciation. You can’t figure out this appreciation by looking at the financial 
reports, though. You have to find research reports written by analysts or the 
financial press to determine the true value of these assets.
Sometimes you see an indication that a company holds hidden assets — 
they’re hidden from your view when you read the financial reports because 
you have no idea what the true marketable value of the buildings and land 
may be. For example, an office building that was purchased for $390,000 and 
held for 20 years may have a marketable value of $1 million if it were sold 
today but has been depreciated to $190,000 over the past 20 years.
Capitalized leases
Whenever a company takes possession of or constructs a building by using 
a lease agreement that contains an option to purchase that property at some 
point in the future, you see a line item on the balance sheet called capitalized 
leases. This means that at some point in the future, the company could likely 
own the property and would then add the property’s value to its total assets 
owned. You can usually find a full explanation of the lease agreement in the 
notes to the financial statements.
Leasehold improvements
Companies track improvements to property that’s leased and not owned in 
the leasehold improvements account on the balance sheet. These items are 
depreciated because the improvements likely lose value as they age.

85
 Chapter 6: Balancing Assets against Liabilities and Equity
Machinery and equipment
Companies track and summarize all machinery and equipment used in their 
facilities or by their employees in the machinery and equipment accounts on 
the balance sheet. These assets depreciate just like buildings but for shorter 
periods of time, depending on the company’s estimate of their useful life.
Furniture and fixtures
Some companies have a line item for furniture and fixtures, whereas others 
group these items in machinery and equipment or other assets. You’re more 
likely to find furniture and fixture line items on the balance sheet of major 
retail chains that hold significant furniture and fixture assets in their retail 
outlets than on the balance sheet for manufacturing companies that don’t 
have retail outlets.
Tools, dies, and molds
You find tools, dies, and molds on the balance sheet of manufacturing compa-
nies but not on the balance sheet of businesses that don’t manufacture their 
own products. Tools, dies, and molds that are unique and are developed spe-
cifically by or for a company can have significant value. This value is amor-
tized, which is similar to the depreciation of other tangible assets. I discuss 
depreciation and amortization in Chapter 4.
Intangible assets
Any assets that aren’t physical — such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, 
and goodwill — are considered intangible assets. Patents, copyrights, and 
trademarks are actually registered with the government, and a company 
holds exclusive rights to these items. If another company wants to use some-
thing that’s patented, copyrighted, or trademarked, it must pay a fee to use 
that asset.
Patents give companies the right to dominate the market for a particular 
product. For example, pharmaceutical companies can be the sole source 
for a drug that’s still under patent. Copyrights also give companies exclu-
sive rights for sale. Copyrighted books can be printed only by the publisher 
or individual who owns that copyright or by someone who has bought the 
rights from the copyright owner.
Goodwill is a different type of asset, reflecting things like the value of a com-
pany’s locations, customer base, or consumer loyalty. Firms essentially pur-
chase goodwill when they buy another company for a price that’s higher than 
the value of the company’s tangible assets or market value. The premium 
that’s paid for the company is kept in an account called “Goodwill” that’s 
shown on the balance sheet.

86
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
Other assets
Other assets is a catchall line item for items that don’t fit into one of the bal-
ance sheet’s other asset categories. The items shown in this category vary 
by company; some firms group both tangible and intangible assets in this 
category.
Other companies may put unconsolidated subsidiaries or affiliates in this 
category. Whenever a company owns less than a controlling share of another 
company (less than 50 percent) but more than 20 percent, it must list the 
ownership as an unconsolidated subsidiary (a subsidiary that’s partially but 
not fully owned) or an affiliate (a company that’s associated with the corpo-
ration but not fully owned). I talk more about consolidation and affiliation in 
Chapter 10.
Ownership of less than 20 percent of another company’s stock is tracked 
as a marketable security (see the section “Marketable securities,” earlier in 
this chapter). Long before a firm reaches even the 20 percent mark, you usu-
ally find discussion of its buying habits in the financial press or in analysts’ 
reports. Talk of a possible merger or acquisition often begins when a com-
pany reaches the 20 percent mark.
You usually don’t find more than a line item that totals all unconsolidated 
subsidiaries or affiliates. Sometimes, more detail is mentioned in the notes to 
the financial statements or in the management’s discussion and analysis sec-
tion, but you often can’t tell by reading the financial reports and looking at 
this category what other businesses the company owns. You have to read the 
financial press or analyst reports to find out the details.
Accumulated depreciation
On a balance sheet, you may see numerous line items that start with accu-
mulated depreciation. These line items appear under the type of asset whose 
value is being depreciated or shown as a total at the bottom of long-term 
assets. Accumulated depreciation is the total amount depreciated against 
tangible assets over the life span of the assets shown on the balance sheet. I 
explain depreciation in greater detail in Chapter 4.
Although some companies show accumulated depreciation under each of the 
long-term assets, it’s becoming common for companies to total accumulated 
depreciation at the bottom of the balance sheet’s long-term assets section. 
This method of reporting makes it harder for you to determine the actual age 
of the assets because depreciation isn’t indicated by each type of asset, so 
you have no idea which assets have depreciated the most — in other words, 
which ones are the oldest.

87
 Chapter 6: Balancing Assets against Liabilities and Equity
 
The age of machinery and factories can be a significant factor in trying to 
determine a company’s future cost and growth prospects. A firm with mostly 
aging plants needs to spend more money on repair or replacement than a 
company that has mostly new facilities. Look for discussion of this in the man-
agement’s discussion and analysis or the notes to the financial statements. If 
you don’t find this information there, you have to dig deeper by reading ana-
lyst reports or reports in the financial press. For example, the toy companies 
Mattel and Hasbro both show their property, plant, and equipment on one line 
in the balance sheet, but you find a complete breakdown in the notes to the 
financial statements.
Looking at Liabilities
Companies must spend money to conduct their day-to-day operations. 
Whenever a company makes a commitment to spend money on credit, be it 
short-term using a credit card or long-term using a mortgage, that commit-
ment becomes a debt or liability.
Current liabilities
Current liabilities are any obligations that a company must pay during the 
next 12 months. These include short-term borrowings, the current portion of 
long-term debt, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. If a company can’t 
pay these bills, it could go into bankruptcy or out of business.
Short-term borrowings
Short-term borrowings are usually lines of credit a company takes to manage 
cash flow. A company borrowing this way isn’t much different from when 
you use a credit card or personal loan to pay bills until your next paycheck. 
As you know, these types of loans usually carry the highest interest-rate 
charges, so if a firm can’t repay them quickly, it converts the debt to some-
thing longer-term with lower interest rates.
 
This type of liability should be a relatively low number on the balance sheet 
compared with other liabilities. A number that isn’t low could be a sign of 
trouble, indicating that the company is having difficulty securing long-term 
debt or meeting its cash obligations.
Current portion of long-term debt
Payments due on long-term debt during the current fiscal year are shown 
on this line item of the balance sheet. Any portion of the debt that’s owed 
beyond the current 12 months is reflected in the long-term liabilities section.

88
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
Accounts payable
Companies list money they owe to others for products, services, supplies, 
and other short-term needs (invoices due in less than 12 months) in accounts 
payable. They record payments due to vendors, suppliers, contractors, and 
other companies they do business with.
Accrued liabilities
Liabilities that are accrued but aren’t yet paid at the time a company pre-
pares the balance sheet are totaled in accrued liabilities. For example, 
companies include income taxes, royalties, advertising, payroll, manage-
ment incentives, and employee taxes that aren’t yet paid in this line item. 
Sometimes a firm breaks out items individually, like income taxes payable, 
without using a catchall line item called accrued liabilities. When you look 
in the notes, you see more details about the types of financial obligations 
included and the total of each type of liability.
Long-term liabilities
Any money a business must pay out for more than 12 months in the future is 
considered a long-term liability. Long-term liabilities don’t throw a company 
into bankruptcy, but if they become too large, the company could have trou-
ble paying its bills in the future.
Many companies keep the long-term liabilities section short and sweet and 
group almost everything under one lump sum, such as long-term debt. Long-
term debt includes mortgages on buildings, loans on machinery or equipment, 
or bonds that need to be repaid at some point in the future. Other companies 
break out the type of debt, showing mortgages payable, loans payable, and 
bonds payable.
For example, both Hasbro and Mattel take the short-and-sweet route, giving 
the financial report reader little detail on the balance sheet. Instead, a reader 
must dig through the notes and management’s discussion and analysis to 
find more details about the liabilities.
 
You can find more details about what a company actually groups in the other 
liability category in the notes to the financial statements. (Guess you’re get-
ting used to that phrase!)

89
 Chapter 6: Balancing Assets against Liabilities and Equity
Navigating the Equity Maze
The final piece of the balancing equation is equity. All companies are owned 
by somebody, and the claims that owners have against the assets owned by 
the company are called equity. In a small company, the equity owners are 
individuals or partners. In a corporation, the equity owners are shareholders.
Stock
Stock represents a portion of ownership in a company. Each share of stock 
has a certain value based on the price placed on the stock when it’s originally 
sold to investors. This price isn’t affected by the current market value of the 
stock; any increase in the stock’s value after its initial offering to the public 
isn’t reflected here. The market gains or losses are actually taken by the 
shareholders and not the company when the stock is bought and sold on the 
market.
Some companies issue two types of stock:
 
✓ Common shareholders: These shareholders own a portion of the com-
pany and have a vote on issues. If the board decides to pay dividends (a 
certain portion per share paid to common shareholders from profits), 
common shareholders get their portion of those dividends as long as 
the preferred shareholders have been paid in full.
 
✓ Preferred shareholders: These shareholders own stock that’s actually 
somewhere in between common stock and a bond (a long-term liability 
to be paid back over a number of years). Although they don’t get back 
the principal they pay for the stock, as a bondholder does, they do have 
first dibs on any dividends.
 
 Preferred shareholders are guaranteed a certain dividend each year. 
If for some reason a company doesn’t pay dividends, these dividends 
are accrued for future years and paid when the company has enough 
money. Accrued dividends for preferred shareholders must be paid 
before common shareholders get any money. The disadvantage for pre-
ferred shareholders is that they have no voting rights in the company.
If a firm goes bankrupt, the bondholders hold first claim on any money 
remaining after the employees and secured debtors (debtors who’ve loaned 
money based on specific assets, such as a mortgage on a building) are paid. 
The preferred shareholders are next in line, and the common shareholders 
are at the bottom of the heap and are frequently left with valueless stock.

Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
Retained earnings
Each year, companies make a choice to either pay out their net profit to their 
shareholders or retain all or some of the profit for reinvesting in the com-
pany. Any profit not paid to shareholders over the years is accumulated in an 
account called retained earnings.
Capital
You don’t find this line item on a corporation’s financial statement, but you’ll 
likely find it on the balance sheet of a small company that isn’t publicly 
owned. Capital is the money that was initially invested by the company’s 
founders.
If you don’t see this line item on the balance sheet of a small, privately 
owned company, the owners likely didn’t invest their own capital to get 
started, or they already took out their initial capital when the company 
began to earn money.
Drawing
Drawing is another line item you don’t see on a corporation’s financial state-
ment. Only unincorporated businesses have a drawing account. This line 
item tracks money that the owners take out from the yearly profits of a busi-
ness. After a company is incorporated, owners can take money as salary or 
dividends, but not on a drawing account.

E
very businessperson needs to know how well his business has done 
over the past month, quarter, or year. Without that information, he has 
no idea where his business has come from and where it may go next. Even 
a small business that has no obligation to report to the public is sure to do 
income statements on at least a quarterly or (more likely) monthly basis to 
find out whether the business made a profit or took a loss.
 
The income statement you see in public financial statements is likely very dif-
ferent from the one you see if you work for the company. The primary differ-
ence is the detail in certain line items. In this chapter, I review the detail that 
goes into an income statement, but don’t be surprised if some of the detail 
never shows up in the financial reports you get as a company outsider. Much 
of the detail is considered confidential and isn’t given out to people outside 
the company. I include this detailed information in this chapter so you know 
what’s behind the numbers that you do see. If you’re a company insider, this 
additional information will help you understand the internal reports you 
receive.

92
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
Introducing the Income Statement
The income statement is where you find out whether a company made a profit 
or took a loss. You also find information about the company’s revenues, sales 
levels, the costs it incurred to make those sales, and the expenses it paid to 
operate the business. The key parts of the statement are
 
✓ Sales or revenues: How much money the business took in from its sales 
to customers.
 
✓ Cost of goods sold: What it cost the company to produce or purchase 
the goods it sold.
 
✓ Expenses: How much the company spent on advertising, administration, 
rent, salaries, and everything else that’s involved in operating a business 
to support the sales process.
 
✓ Net income or loss: The bottom line that tells you whether the company 
made a profit or operated at a loss.
 
The income statement is one of the three reports required by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (FASB); I describe their roles in the preparation of financial statements 
in Chapters 18 and 19. In fact, the FASB specifies that the income statement 
provide a report of comprehensive income, which means the report should 
reflect any changes to a company’s equity during a given period of time that 
are caused by transactions, events, or other circumstances involving transac-
tions with nonowner sources. In simpler terms, any changes in equity that 
aren’t raised by investments from owners or distributed to owners must be 
reflected on this statement.
When looking at an income statement, you can expect to find a report of 
either
 
✓ Excess of revenues over expenses: This report means the company 
earned a profit.
 
✓ Excess of expenses over revenues: This report means the company 
faced a loss.
Because the income statement shows profits and losses, some people like to 
call it the profit and loss statement (or P&L), but that isn’t actually one of its 
official names. In addition to “statement of income,” the income statement 
has a number of official names that you may find in a financial report. These 
include
 
✓ Statement of operations
 
✓ Statement of earnings
 
✓ Statement of operating results

93
 Chapter 7: Using the Income Statement
Digging into dates
Income statements reflect an operating period, which means that they show 
results for a specific length of time. At the top of an income statement, you 
see the phrase “Years Ended” or “Fiscal Years Ended” and the month the 
period ended for an annual financial statement. You may also see “Quarters 
Ended” or “Months Ended” for reports based on shorter periods of time. 
Companies are required to show at least three periods of data on their 
income statements, so if you’re looking at a statement for 2008, you also find 
columns for 2007 and 2006.
 
Many people believe you should analyze at least five years’ worth of data if 
you’re thinking about investing in a company. You can easily get hold of this 
data by ordering a two-year-old annual report along with the current one. You 
can also find most annual and quarterly reports online at a company’s Web 
site or by visiting the SEC’s Edgar Web site (www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml), 
which posts all financial reports filed with the SEC. Because each report must 
have three years’ worth of data, a 2008 report will show data for 2007 and 
2006, too. And a 2005 report will show 2004 and 2003 data also. So you’ll actu-
ally have six years’ worth of data: 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004, and 2003.
Figuring out format
Not all income statements look alike. Basically, companies can choose to use 
one of two formats for the income statement: the single-step or the multistep.
Both formats give you the same bottom-line information. The key difference 
between them is whether they summarize that information to make analyzing 
it easier. The single-step format is easier to produce, but the multistep format 
gives you a number of subtotals throughout the statement that make analyz-
ing a company’s results easier. Most public corporations use the multistep 
format, but many smaller companies that don’t have to report to the general 
public use the single-step format.
Single-step format
The single-step format groups all data into two categories: revenue and 
expenses. Revenue includes income from sales, interest income, and gains 
from sales of equipment. It also includes income that a company raises from 
its regular operations or from one-time transactions, such as from the sale of 
a building. Expenses include all the costs that are involved in bringing in the 
revenue.
The single-step format (see Figure 7-1) gets its name because you perform 
only one step to figure out a company’s net income — you subtract the 
expenses from the revenue.

Multistep format
The multistep format divides the income statement into several sections and 
gives the reader some critical subtotals that make analyzing the data much 
easier and quicker. Even though the single-step and multistep income state-
ments include the same revenue and expense information, they group the 
information differently. The key difference is that the multistep format has 
the following four profit lines:
 
✓ Gross profit: This reflects the profit generated from sales minus the cost 
of the goods sold.
 
✓ Income from operations: This reflects the operating income earned by 
the company after all its operating expenses have been subtracted.
 
✓ Income before taxes: This reflects all income earned — which can 
include gains on equipment sales, interest revenue, and other revenue 
not generated by sales — before taxes or interest expenses are sub-
tracted.
 
✓ Net income (or Net loss): This reflects the bottom line — whether or not 
the company made a profit.

 Chapter 7: Using the Income Statement
Many companies add even more profit lines, like earnings before interest, 
taxes, depreciation, and amortization, known as EBITDA for short (see the 
section “EBITDA” later in this chapter).
Some companies that have discontinued operations include those in the line 
item for continuing operations. But it’s better for the financial report reader if 
that information is on a separate line; otherwise, the reader won’t know what 
the actual profit or loss is from continuing operations. I delve a bit deeper 
into these various profit lines in “Sorting Out the Profit and Loss Types,” later 
in this chapter.

step format example (refer to Figure 7-1).

Delving into the Tricky 
Business of Revenues
You may think that figuring out when to count something as revenue is a 
relatively simple procedure. Well, forget that. Revenue acknowledgement is 
one of the most complex issues on the income statement. In fact, you may 
have noticed that with the recent corporation scandals, the most common 
reason companies have gotten into trouble has to do with the issue of mis-
stated revenues.
In this section, I define revenue and explain the three line items that make up 
the revenue portion of the income statement: sales, cost of goods sold, and 
gross profit.
Defining revenue
When a company recognizes something as revenue, it doesn’t always mean 
that cash changed hands, nor does it always mean that a product was even 
delivered. Accrual accounting leaves room for deciding when revenue is 
actually recorded. A company recognizes revenue when it earns it and recog-
nizes expenses when it incurs them, without regard to whether cash changes 
hands. You can find out more about accounting basics in Chapter 4.
 
Because accrual accounting doesn’t require that a company actually have the 
cash in hand to count something as revenue, senior managers can play games 
to make the bottom line look the way they want it to look by either counting 
or not counting income. Sometimes they acknowledge more income than they 
should to improve the financial reports; other times they reduce income to 
reduce the tax bite. I talk more about these shenanigans in Chapter 23.
When a company wants to count something as revenue, several factors can 
make that decision rather muddy, leaving questions about whether a particu-
lar sale should be counted:
 
✓ If the seller and buyer haven’t agreed on the final price for the mer-
chandise and service, the seller can’t count the revenue collected.
 
 For example, when a company is in the middle of negotiating a contract 
for a sale of a major item such as a car or appliance, it can’t include that 
sale as revenue until the final price has been set and a contract obligat-
ing the buyer is in place.

97
 Chapter 7: Using the Income Statement
 
✓ If the buyer doesn’t pay for the merchandise until the company resells 
it to a retail outlet (which may be the case for a company that works 
with a distributor) or to the customer, the company can’t count the 
revenue until the sale to the customer is final.
 
 For example, publishers frequently allow bookstores to return unsold 
books within a certain amount of time. If there’s a good chance that 
some portion of the product may be returned unsold, companies must 
take this into account when reporting revenues. For instance, a pub-
lisher uses historical data to estimate what percentage of books will be 
returned and adjusts sales downward to reflect those likely returns.
 
✓ If the buyer and seller are related, revenue isn’t acknowledged in the 
same way.
 
 No, I’m not talking about kissing cousins here. I’m talking about when 
the buyer is the parent company or subsidiary of the seller. In that case, 
companies must handle the transaction as an internal transfer of assets.
 
✓ If the buyer isn’t obligated to pay for the merchandise because it’s 
stolen or physically destroyed before it’s delivered or sold, the 
company can’t acknowledge the revenue until the merchandise is 
actually sold.
 
 For example, a toy company works with a distributor or other middle-
man to get its toys into retail stores. If the middleman doesn’t have to 
pay for those toys until they’re delivered or sold to retailers, the manu-
facturer can’t count the toys it shipped to the middleman as revenue 
until the middleman completes the sale.
 
✓ If the seller is obligated to provide significant services to the buyer 
or aid in reselling the product, the seller can’t count the sale of that 
product as revenue until the sale is actually completed with the final 
customer.
 
 For example, many manufacturers of technical products offer instal-
lation or follow-up services for a new product as part of the sales 
promotion. If those services are a significant part of the final sale, the 
manufacturer can’t count that sale as revenue until the installation or 
service has been completed with the customer. Items shipped for sale 
to local retailers under these conditions wouldn’t be considered sold, so 
they can’t be counted as revenue.
Adjusting sales
Not all products sell for their list price. Companies frequently use dis-
counts, returns, or allowances to reduce the prices of products or services. 
Whenever a firm sells a product at a discount, it should keep track of those 

98
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
discounts, as well as its returns and allowances. That’s the only way the com-
pany can truly analyze how much money it’s making on the sale of its prod-
ucts and how accurately it’s pricing the products to sell in the marketplace.
 
If a company must offer too many discounts, that’s usually a sign of a weak or 
very competitive market. If a company has a lot of returns, that may be a sign 
of a quality-control problem or a sign that the product isn’t living up to cus-
tomers’ expectations. The sales adjustments I talk about here help a company 
track and analyze its sales and recognize any negative trends.
As a financial report reader, you won’t see the specifics about discounts 
in the income statement, but you may find some mention of significant dis-
counting in the notes to the financial statements. The most common types of 
adjustments companies make to their sales are
 
✓ Volume discounts: To get more items in the marketplace, manufactur-
ers offer major retailers volume discounts, which means these retailers 
agree to buy a large number of a manufacturer’s product in order to 
save a certain percentage of money off the price. One of the reasons 
you get such good prices at discount sellers like Wal-Mart and Target is 
because they buy products from the manufacturer at greatly discounted 
prices. Because they purchase for thousands of stores, they can buy a 
very large number of goods at one time. Volume discounts reduce the 
revenue of the company that gives them.
 
✓ Returns: Returns are arrangements between the buyer and seller that 
allow the buyer to return goods for a number of reasons. I’m sure you’ve 
returned goods that you didn’t like, that didn’t fit, or that possibly didn’t 
even work. Returns are subtracted from a company’s revenue.
 
✓ Allowances: Gift cards and other accounts that a customer pays for 
upfront without taking merchandise are types of allowances. Allowances 
are actually liabilities for a store because the customer hasn’t yet 
selected the merchandise and the sale isn’t complete. Revenues are 
collected upfront, but at some point in the future, merchandise will be 
taken off the shelves and additional cash won’t be received.
 
Most companies don’t show you the details of their discounts, returns, and 
allowances, but they do track them and adjust their revenue accordingly. 
When you see a net sales or net revenue figure (the sales made by the com-
pany minus any adjustments) at the top of an income statement, the company 
has already adjusted the figure for these items.
Internally, managers see the details of these adjustments in the sales area 
of the income statement, so they can track trends for discounts, returns, 
and allowances. Tracking such trends is a very important aspect of the 

99
 Chapter 7: Using the Income Statement
managerial process. If a manager notices that any of these line items show 
a dramatic increase, she should investigate the reason for the increase. For 
example, an increase in discounts could mean that the company has to 
consistently offer its products for less money, which could mean the market 
is softening and fewer customers are buying fewer products. A dramatic 
increase in returns could mean that the products the business is selling may 
have a defect that needs to be corrected.
Considering cost of goods sold
Like the sales line item, the cost of goods sold (what it costs to manufacture 
or purchase the goods being sold) line item also has many different pieces 
that make up its calculation on the income sheet. You don’t see the details 
for this line item unless you’re a company manager. Few firms report the 
details of their cost of goods sold to the general public.
Items that make up the cost of goods sold vary depending on whether a com-
pany manufactures the goods in-house or purchases them. If the company 
manufactures them in-house, you track the costs all the way from the point 
of raw materials and include the labor involved in building the product. If the 
company purchases its goods, it tracks the purchases of the goods as they’re 
made.
In fact, a manufacturing firm tracks several levels of inventory, including
 
✓ Raw materials: The materials used for manufacturing
 
✓ Work-in-process inventory: Products in the process of being con-
structed
 
✓ Finished-goods inventory: Products ready for sale
Sometimes tracking begins from the time the raw materials are purchased, 
with adjustments based on discounts, returns, or allowances given. Companies 
also add freight charges and any other costs involved directly in acquiring 
goods to be sold to the income statement’s cost of goods sold section.
When a company finally sells the product, it becomes a cost of goods sold 
line item. Managing costs during the production phase is critical for all 
manufacturing companies. Managers in this type of business receive regular 
reports that include the cost details. Trends that show dramatically increas-
ing costs certainly must be investigated as quickly as possible because the 
company must consider a price change to maintain its profit margin.

100
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
 
Even if a company is only a service company, it likely has costs for the ser-
vices it provides. In this case, the line item may be called “cost of services 
sold” rather than “cost of goods sold.” You may even see a line item called 
“cost of goods or services sold” if a company gets revenue from the sale of 
both goods and services.
Gauging gross profit
The gross profit line item in the income statement’s revenue section is 
simply a calculation of net revenue or net sales minus the cost of goods sold. 
Basically, this number shows the difference between what a company pays 
for its inventory and the price at which it sells this inventory. This summary 
number tells you how much profit the company makes selling its products 
before deducting the expenses of its operation. If there’s no profit or not 
enough profit here, it’s not worth being in business.
Managers, investors, and other interested parties closely watch the trend of 
a company’s gross profit because it indicates the effectiveness of the com-
pany’s purchasing and pricing policies. Analysts frequently use this number 
not only to gauge how well a company manages its product costs internally 
but also to gauge how well the firm manages its product costs compared with 
other companies in the same business.
If profit is too low, a company can do one of two things: find a way to increase 
sales revenue or find a way to reduce the cost of the goods it’s selling.
To increase sales revenue, the company can raise or lower prices in order to 
increase the amount of money it’s bringing in. Raising the prices of its prod-
uct brings in more revenue if the same number of items is sold, but it could 
bring in less revenue if the price hike turns away customers and fewer items 
are sold.
Lowering prices to bring in more revenue may sound strange to you, but if a 
company determines that a price is too high and is discouraging buyers, doing 
so may increase its volume of sales and, therefore, its gross margin. This sce-
nario is especially true if the company has a lot of fixed costs (such as manufac-
turing facilities, equipment, and labor) that aren’t being used to full capacity. 
The firm can use its manufacturing facilities more effectively and efficiently if 
it has the capability to produce more product without a significant increase in 
the variable costs (such as raw materials or other factors, like overtime).
A company can also consider using cost-control possibilities for manufactur-
ing or purchasing if its gross profit is too low. The company may find a more 
efficient way to make the product, or it may negotiate a better contract for 
raw materials to reduce those costs. If the company purchases finished prod-
ucts for sale, it may be able to negotiate better contract terms to reduce its 
purchasing costs.

101
 Chapter 7: Using the Income Statement
Acknowledging Expenses
Expenses include the items a company must pay for to operate the business 
that aren’t directly related to the sale and production of specific products. 
Expenses differ from the cost of goods sold, which can be directly traced to 
the actual sale of a product. Even when a company is making a sizable gross 
profit, if management doesn’t carefully watch the expenses, the gross profit 
can quickly turn into a net loss.
 
Expenses make up the second of the two main parts of the income statement; 
revenues make up the first part.
Advertising and promotion, administration, and research and development 
are all examples of expenses. Although many of these expenses impact the 
ability of a company to sell its products, they aren’t direct costs of the sales 
process for individual items. The following are details about the key items 
that fit into the expenses part of the income statement:
 
✓ Advertising and promotion: For many companies, one of the largest 
expenses is advertising and promotion. Advertising includes TV and 
radio ads, print ads, and billboard ads. Promotions include product give-
aways (hats, T-shirts, pens with the company logo on it, and so on) or 
name identification on a sports stadium. If a company helps promote a 
charitable event and has its name on T-shirts or billboards as part of the 
event, these expenses must be included in the advertising and promo-
tion expense line item.
 
✓ Other selling administration expenses: This category is a catchall for 
any selling expenses, including salespeople’s and sales managers’ sala-
ries, commissions, bonuses, and other compensation expenses. The 
costs of sales offices and any expenses related to those offices also fall 
into this category.
 
✓ Other operating expenses: If a company includes line-item detail in its 
financial reports, you usually find that detail in the notes to the financial 
statements. All operating expenses that aren’t directly connected to 
the sale of products fall into the category of other operating expenses, 
including
 
• General office needs: Administrative salaries, expenses for admin-
istrative offices, supplies, machinery, and anything else needed 
to run the general operations of a company are reported in gen-
eral office needs. Expenses for human resources, management, 
accounting, and security also fall into this category.
 
• Royalties: Any royalties (payments made for the use of property) 
paid to individuals or other companies fall under this umbrella. 
Companies most commonly pay royalties for the use of patents or 

102
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
copyrights owned by another company or individual. Companies 
also pay royalties when they buy the rights to extract natural 
resources from another person’s property.
 
• Research and product development: Any costs for developing 
new products are listed in this line item. Most likely, you’ll find 
details about research and product development in the notes 
to the financial statements or in the managers’ discussion and 
analysis. Any company that makes new products has research 
and development costs because if it isn’t always looking for ways 
to improve its product or introduce new products, it’s at risk of 
losing out to a competitor.
 
✓ Interest expenses: Expenses paid for interest on long- or short-term 
debt are shown in this line item. You usually find some explanation for 
the interest expenses in the notes to the financial statements.
 
✓ Interest income: If a company receives interest income for any of its 
holdings, you’ll see it in this line item. This category includes notes or 
bonds held by the company, such as marketable securities, or interest 
paid by another company to which it loaned short-term cash.
 
✓ Depreciation and amortization expenses: Depreciation on buildings, 
machinery, or other items, as well as amortization on intangible items, 
are shown in this line item. You have to look in the notes to the financial 
statements to discover more details about depreciation and amortiza-
tion. To find out how these expenses are calculated, see Chapter 4.
 
✓ Insurance expenses: In addition to insurance expenses for items such 
as theft, fire, and other losses, companies usually carry life insurance 
on their top executives and errors and omissions insurance for their 
top executives and board members. Errors and omissions insurance pro-
tects executives and board members from being sued personally for any 
errors or omissions related to their work for the company or as part of 
their responsibility on the company’s board.
 
✓ Taxes: All corporations have to pay income taxes. In the taxes category, 
you find the amount the company actually paid in taxes. Many compa-
nies and their investors complain that corporate income is taxed 
twice — once directly as a corporation and a second time on the divi-
dends that the shareholders receive. In reality, many corporations can 
use so many tax write-offs that their tax bill is zero or near zero.
 
✓ Other expenses: Any expenses that don’t fit into one of the earlier line 
items in this list fall into this category. What goes into this category 
varies among companies, depending on what each company chooses to 
show on an individual line item and what it groups in other expenses. 
However, a firm doesn’t include expenses relating to operating activities 
in this category; those expenses go on the line item for other operating 
expenses. Companies separate operating expenses from nonoperating 
expenses.

103
 Chapter 7: Using the Income Statement
Sorting Out the Profit and Loss Types
When you hear earnings or profits reports on the news, most of the time, the 
reporters are discussing the net profit, net income, or net loss. For readers 
of financial statements, that bottom-line number doesn’t tell the entire story 
of how a company is doing. Relying solely on the bottom-line number is like 
reading the last few pages of a novel and thinking that you understand the 
entire story. All you really know is the end, not how the characters got to 
that ending.
Because companies have so many different charges or expenses unique to 
their operations, different profit lines are used for different types of analysis. 
I cover the types of analysis in Part III, but in this section, I review what each 
of these profit types includes or doesn’t include. For example, gross profit is 
the best number to use to analyze how well a company is managing its sales 
and the costs of producing those sales, but gross profit gives you no idea 
how well the company is managing the rest of its expenses. Using operating 
profits, which show you how much money was made after considering all 
costs and expenses for operating the company, you can analyze how effi-
ciently the company is managing its operating activities, but you don’t get 
enough detail to analyze product costs.
EBITDA
A commonly used measure to compare companies is earnings before inter-
est, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, also known as EBITDA. With this 
number, analysts and investors can compare profitability among companies 
or industries because it eliminates the effects of the companies’ activities 
to raise cash outside their operating activities, such as by selling stock or 
bonds. EBITDA also eliminates any accounting decisions that could impact 
the bottom line, such as the companies’ policies relating to depreciation 
methods.
 
Investors reading the financial report can use this line item to focus on the 
profitability of each company’s operations. If a company does include this line 
item, it will appear at the bottom of the expenses section but before line items 
listing interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.
How a firm chooses to raise money can greatly impact its bottom line. Selling 
equity has no annual costs if dividends aren’t paid. Borrowing money means 
interest costs must be paid every year, so a company will have ongoing 
required expenses.

104
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
EBITDA gives financial report readers a quick view of how well a company 
is doing without considering its financial and accounting decisions. This 
number became very popular in the 1980s, when leveraged buyouts were 
common. A leveraged buyout takes place when an individual or company buys 
a controlling interest (which means more than 50 percent) in a company, pri-
marily using debt (up to 70 percent or more of the purchase price). This fad 
left many businesses in danger of not earning enough from operations to pay 
their huge debt load.
Today, EBITDA is frequently touted by technology companies or other high-
growth companies with large expenses for machinery and other equipment. 
In these situations, the companies like to discuss their earnings before the 
huge write-offs for depreciation, which can make the bottom line look pretty 
small. EBITDA can actually be used as an accounting gimmick to make a com-
pany’s earnings sound better to the general public or to investors who don’t 
take the time to read the fine print in the annual report.
 
Firms can get pretty creative when it comes to their income statement group-
ings. If you don’t understand a line item, be sure to look for explanations in the 
notes to the financial statements. If you can’t find an explanation there, call 
investor relations and ask questions.
Nonoperating income or expense
If a company earns income from a source that isn’t part of its normal reve-
nue-generating activities, it usually lists this income on the income statement 
as nonoperating income. Items commonly listed here include the sale of a 
building, manufacturing facility, or company division. Other types of nonop-
erating income include interest from notes receivable and marketable securi-
ties, dividends from investments in other companies’ stock, and rent revenue 
(if the business subleases some of its facilities).
Companies also group one-time expenses in the nonoperating section of the 
income statement. For example, the severance and other costs of closing a 
division or factory are shown in this area, or, in some cases, a separate sec-
tion on discontinuing operations is shown on the statement. Other types 
of expenses include casualty losses from theft, vandalism, or fire; loss from 
the sale or abandonment of property, plant, or equipment; and loss from 
employee or supplier strikes.
You usually find explanations for income or expenses from nonoperating 
activities in the notes to the financial statements. Companies need to sepa-
rate these nonoperating activities; otherwise, investors, analysts, and other 
interested parties can’t gauge how well a company is doing with its core 

105
 Chapter 7: Using the Income Statement
operating activities. The core operating activities line item is where you find 
a company’s continuing income. If those core activities aren’t raising enough 
income, the firm may be on the road to significant financial difficulties.
A major gain may make the bottom line look great, but it could send the 
wrong signal to outsiders, who may then expect similar earnings results the 
next year. If the company doesn’t repeat the results the following year, Wall 
Street will surely hammer its stock. A major one-time loss also needs special 
explanation so that Wall Street doesn’t downgrade the stock unnecessarily if 
the one-time nonoperating loss won’t be repeated in future years.
 
Whether a gain or a loss, separating nonoperating income from operating 
income and expenses helps prevent sending the wrong signal to analysts and 
investors about a company’s future earnings and growth potential.
Net profit or loss
 
The bottom line of any income statement is net profit or loss. This number 
means very little if you don’t understand the other line items that make up the 
income statement. Few investors and analysts look solely at net profit or loss 
to make a major decision about whether a company is a good investment.
Calculating Earnings per Share
In addition to net income, the other number you hear almost as often about 
a company’s earnings results is earnings per share. Earnings per share is the 
amount of net income the company makes per share of stock available on the 
market. For example, if you own 100 shares of stock in ABC Company and it 
earns $1 per share, $100 of those earnings would be yours unless the com-
pany decides to reinvest the earnings for future growth. In reality, a company 
rarely pays out 100 percent of its earnings; it usually pays out a very small 
fraction of those earnings.
 
You find the calculation for earnings per share on the income statement after 
net income, or in a separate statement called the statement of shareholders’ 
equity. The calculation for earnings per share is relatively simple: You take 
the number of outstanding shares (which you can find on the balance sheet) 
and divide it by the net earnings or net income (which you find on the income 
statement).

106
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
Basically, earnings per share shows you how much money each shareholder 
made for each of her shares. In reality, this money doesn’t get paid back to 
the shareholder. Instead, most is reinvested in future operations of the com-
pany. The net income or loss is added to the retained earnings number on 
the balance sheet.
Any dividends declared per share are shown on the income statement under 
the earnings per share information. You find the amount of dividends paid on 
the statement of cash flows, which I talk about in Chapter 8. The company’s 
board of directors declares dividends either quarterly or annually.
At the bottom of an income statement, you see two numbers:
 
✓ The basic earnings per share is a calculation based on the number of 
shares outstanding at the time the income statement is developed.
 
✓ The diluted earnings per share includes other potential shares that could 
eventually be outstanding. This category includes shares designated 
for things like stock options (options given to employees to buy shares 
of stock at a set price, usually lower than the market price), warrants 
(shares of stock promised to bondholders or preferred shareholders 
for additional shares of stock at a set price, usually below the stock’s 
market value), and convertibles (shares of stock promised to a lender 
who owns bonds that are convertible to stock).
These numbers give you an idea of how much a company earns per share. 
You can use them to analyze the company’s profitability, which I show you 
how to do in Chapter 11.

The Statement of Cash Flows
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring the statement of cash flows
▶ Understanding operating activities
▶ Getting a grip on investments
▶ Figuring out the financing section
▶ Looking at other line items
▶ Finding net cash from all company activities
C
ash is a company’s lifeblood. If a company expects to manage its assets 
and liabilities and to pay its obligations, it has to know the amount of 
cash flowing into and out of the business, which isn’t always easy to figure 
out when using accrual accounting. (You can find out more about accrual 
accounting in Chapter 4.)
The reason accrual accounting makes it hard to figure out how much cash 
a company actually holds is that cash doesn’t have to change hands for the 
company to record a transaction. The statement of cash flows is the financial 
statement that helps the financial report reader understand a company’s 
cash position by adjusting for differences between cash and accruals. (See 
Chapter 4 for more information on cash and accruals.) This statement tracks 
the cash that flows into and out of a business during a specified period of 
time and lays out the sources of that cash. In this chapter, I explore the basic 
parts of the statement of cash flows.
Digging into the Statement 
of Cash Flows
Basically, a statement of cash flows gives the financial report reader a 
map of the cash receipts, cash payments, and changes in cash that a com-
pany holds, minus the expenses that arise from operating the company. In 
addition, the statement looks at money that flows into or out of the firm 

108
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
through investing and financing activities. As with the income statement 
(see Chapter 7), companies provide three years’ worth of information on the 
statement of cash flows.
 
When reading the statement of cash flows, you should be looking for answers 
to these three questions:
 
✓ Where did the company get the cash needed for operations during the 
period shown on the statement — from revenue generated, funds bor-
rowed, or stock sold?
 
✓ What cash did the company actually spend during the period shown on 
the statement?
 
✓ What was the change in the cash balance during each of the years 
shown on the statement?
Knowing the answers to these questions helps you determine whether the 
company is thriving and has the cash needed to continue to grow its opera-
tions or the company appears to have a cash-flow problem and could be 
nearing a point of fiscal disaster. In this section, I show you how to use the 
statement of cash flows to find the answers to these questions.
The parts
Transactions shown on the statement of cash flows are grouped in three 
parts:
 
✓ Operating activities: This part includes revenue the company takes in 
through sales of its products or services and expenses the company 
pays out to carry out its operations.
 
✓ Investing activities: This part includes the purchase or sale of the com-
pany’s investments and can include the purchase or sale of long-term 
assets, such as a building or a company division. Spending on capital 
improvements (upgrades to assets held by the company, such as the 
renovation of a building) also fits into this category, as does any buying 
or selling of short-term invested funds.
 
✓ Financing activities: This part involves raising cash through long-term 
debt or by issuing new stock. It also includes using cash to pay down 
debt or buy back stock. Companies also include any dividends paid in 
this section.
 
Operating activities is the most important section of the statement of cash 
flows. In reading this section, you can determine whether the company’s oper-
ations are generating enough cash to keep the business viable. I discuss how 
to analyze this statement and make these determinations in Chapter 12.

 Chapter 8: The Statement of Cash Flows 
The formats
Companies can choose between two different formats when preparing their 
statement of cash flows, both of which arrive at the same total but provide 
different information to get there:
 
✓ Direct method: The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB; see 
Chapter 18) prefers the direct method, which groups major classes of 
cash receipts and cash payments. For example, cash collected from 
customers is grouped separately from cash received on interest-earning 
savings accounts or from dividends paid on stock owned by the com-
pany. Major groups of cash payments include cash paid to buy inven-
tory, cash disbursed to pay salaries, cash paid for taxes, and cash paid 
to cover interest on loans. Figure 8-1 shows you the direct method.
 
✓ Indirect method: Most companies (90 percent) use the indirect method, 
which focuses on the differences between net income and net cash flow 
from operations and allows firms to reveal less than the direct method, 
leaving their competitors guessing. The indirect method is easier to pre-
pare. Figure 8-2 shows you the indirect method.
 
The direct and indirect methods differ only in the operating-activities sec-
tion of the report. The investing-activities and financing-activities sections 
are the same.

Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
Using the indirect method, you just need the information from two years’ 
worth of balance sheets and income statements to make calculations. For 
example, you can calculate changes in accounts receivable, inventories, pre-
paid expenses, current assets, accounts payable, and current liabilities by 
comparing the totals shown on the balance sheet for the current year and the 
previous year. If a company shows $1.5 million in inventory in 2007 and $1 
million in 2008, the change in inventory using the indirect method is shown 
easily: “Decrease in Inventory — $500,000.” The statement of cash flows for 
the indirect method summarizes information already given in a different way, 
but it doesn’t reveal any new information.
With the direct method, the company has to reveal the actual cash it receives 
from customers, the cash it pays to suppliers and employees, and the income 
tax refund it receives. Someone reading the balance sheet and income state-
ment won’t find these numbers in other parts of the financial report.
In addition to having to reveal details about the actual cash received or paid 
to customers, suppliers, employees, and the government, companies that use 
the direct method must prepare a schedule similar to one used in the indi-
rect method for operating activities to meet FASB requirements. Essentially, 
companies save no time, must reveal more detail, and must still present the 
indirect method. Why bother? That’s why you’ll most likely see the indirect 
method used in the vast majority of financial reports you read.
The investing-activities and financing-activities sections for both the direct 
and indirect methods look something like Figure 8-3 and Figure 8-4, both 
of which show the basic line items. Read on to find out what’s included in 
each of these line items. If you’re interested in finding out about line items 
that make their way onto the statement only in special circumstances, see 
“Recognizing the Special Line Items,” later in the chapter.

 Chapter 8: The Statement of Cash Flows 
Checking Out Operating Activities
The operating-activities section is where you find a summary of how much 
cash flowed into and out of the company during the day-to-day operations of 
the business.
 
Operating activities is the most important section of the statement of cash 
flows. If a company isn’t generating enough cash from its operations, it isn’t 
going to be in business long. Although new companies often don’t generate 
a lot of cash in their early years, they can’t survive that way for long before 
going bust.
The primary purpose of the operating-activities section is to adjust the net 
income by adding or subtracting entries that were made in order to abide by 
the rules of accrual accounting that don’t actually require the use of cash. 
In this section, I describe several of the accounts in the operating-activities 
section of the statement and explain how they’re impacted by the changes 
required to revert accrual accounting entries to actual cash flow.
Depreciation
A company that buys a lot of new equipment or builds new facilities has high 
depreciation expenses that lower its net income. This is particularly true for 
many high-tech businesses that must always upgrade their equipment and 
facilities to keep up with their competitors.
Finding out the importance of cash the hard way
Dot.com babies certainly discovered the impor-
tance of cash on hand the hard way. Many 
newly minted dot.com companies raised mil-
lions of dollars in cash in the late 1990s and 
were able to stay in business for two or three 
years. But after these companies could no 
longer raise money from investors or borrow 
funds, the dot.com babies went bankrupt. Most 
dot.com companies died when the investor 
cash dried up in 2000 because they didn’t gen-
erate enough money from their operations. In 
fact, more than 850 dot.com companies bit the 
dust between January 2000 and January 2002. 
If you want to find out more about the dot.com 
business fiascos, you can read the business 
plans of many of the failed companies at www.
businessplanarchive.org.

112
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
The bottom line may not look good, but all those depreciation expenses don’t 
represent the use of cash. In reality, no cash changes hands to pay deprecia-
tion expenses. These expenses are actually added back into the equation 
when you look at whether the company is generating enough cash from its 
operations because the company didn’t actually lay out cash to pay for these 
expenses.
For example, if the company’s net income is $200,000 for the year and its 
depreciation expenses are $50,000, the $50,000 is added back in to find the 
net cash from operations, which totals $250,000. Essentially, the firm is in 
better shape than it looked to be before the depreciation expenses because 
of this noncash transaction.
Inventory
Another adjustment shown on the statement of cash flows that usually adds 
cash to the mix is a decrease in inventory. If a company’s inventory on hand 
is less in the current year than in the previous year, some of the inventory 
sold was actually bought with cash in the previous year.
On the other hand, if the company’s inventory increases from the previous 
year, it spent more money on inventory in the current year and it subtracts 
the difference from the net income to find its current cash holdings. For 
example, if inventory decreases by $10,000, the company adds that amount 
to net income on the statement of cash flows.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable is the summary of accounts of customers who buy their 
goods or services on credit provided directly by the company. Customers 
who buy their goods by using credit cards from banks or other financial 
institutions aren’t included in accounts receivable. Payments by outside 
credit sources are instead counted as cash because the company receives 
cash from the bank or financial institution. The bank or financial institution 
collects from those customers, so the company that sells the good or service 
doesn’t have to worry about collecting the cash.
When accounts receivable increase during the year, the company sells more 
products or services on credit than it collects in actual cash from custom-
ers. In this case, an increase in accounts receivable means a decrease in 
cash available.

113
 Chapter 8: The Statement of Cash Flows 
The opposite is true if accounts receivable are lower during the current 
year than the previous year. In this case, the company collects more 
cash than it adds credit to customers’ credit accounts. In this situation, a 
decrease in accounts receivable results in more cash received, which adds 
to the net income.
Accounts payable
Accounts payable is the summary of accounts of bills due that haven’t yet 
been paid, which means cash must still be laid out in a future accounting 
period to pay those bills.
When accounts payable increase, a company uses less cash to pay bills in the 
current year than it did in the previous one, so more cash is on hand. This 
has a positive effect on the cash situation. Expenses incurred are shown on 
the income statement, which means net income is lower. But in reality, the 
cash hasn’t yet been laid out to pay those expenses, so an increase is added 
to net income to find out how much cash is actually on hand.
Conversely, if accounts payable decrease, the company pays out more cash 
for this liability. A decrease in accounts payable means the company has less 
cash on hand, and it subtracts this number from net income.
Summing up the cash-flow-
from-activities section
To give you a taste of what all these line items look like in the statement of 
cash flows, see Table 8-1, where I roll together the information from the pre-
vious sections to show you how it all comes together.

Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
In Table 8-1, the company has $30,000 more in cash from operations than it 
reported on the income statement, so the company actually generated more 
cash than you may have thought if you just looked at net income.
 If you compare the statements for the toy companies Mattel and Hasbro in 
2007 (you can download them at www.mattel.com and www.hasbro.com), 
you can see that Mattel’s net cash flow totaled $560.5 million after adjust-
ments on $600 million net income, whereas Hasbro’s net cash was $601.8 
million on $333 million of net income. For Hasbro, depreciation and amortiza-
tion adjustments added $156.5 million to the company’s net cash position. 
Mattel added $171.9 million to its net cash with depreciation and amortization. 
Mattel used a large chunk of its cash to decrease accounts payable, accrued 
liabilities, and income taxes by $311.9 million. Hasbro increased its cash with 
increases in deferred income taxes, prepaid taxes, and accounts payable.
Investigating Investing Activities
The investment-activities section of the statement of cash flows, which looks 
at the purchase or sale of major new assets, is usually a drainer of cash. 
Consider what’s typically listed in this section:
 
✓ Purchases of new buildings, land, and major equipment
 
✓ Mergers or acquisitions
 
✓ Major improvements to existing buildings
 
✓ Major upgrades to existing factories and equipment
 
✓ Purchases of new marketable securities, such as bonds or stock
The sale of buildings, land, major equipment, and marketable securities is also 
shown in the investment-activities section. When any of these major assets 
are sold, they’re shown as cash generators rather than as cash drainers.
 
The primary reason to check out the investments section is to see how 
the company is managing its capital expenditures (money spent to buy or 
upgrade assets) and how much cash it’s using for these expenditures. If the 
company shows large investments in this area, be sure to look for explana-
tions in the management’s discussion and analysis and the notes to the finan-
cial statements (see Chapter 9) to get more details about the reasons for the 
expenditures.
If you believe that the firm is making the right choices to grow the business 
and improve profits, investing in its stock may be worthwhile. If the com-
pany is making most of its capital expenditures to keep old factories operat-
ing as long as possible, that may be a sign that it isn’t keeping up with new 
technology.

115
 Chapter 8: The Statement of Cash Flows 
 
Compare companies in the same industry to see what type of expenditures 
each lists in investment activities and the explanations for those expenditures 
in the notes to the financial statements. Comparing a company with one of 
its peers helps you determine whether the company is budgeting its capital 
expenditures wisely.
 In comparing the statements of Hasbro and Mattel, you can see that Mattel 
spent more on purchases of tools, dies, molds, property, plant, and equip-
ment. Mattel’s spending totaled more than $146.6 million, whereas Hasbro 
spent about $91.5 million.
Understanding Financing Activities
Companies can’t always raise all the cash they need from their day-to-day 
operations. Financing activities are another means of generating cash. Any 
cash raised through activities that don’t include day-to-day operations can be 
found in the financing section of the statement of cash flows.
Issuing stock
When a company first sells its shares of stock, it shows the money it raises in 
the financing section of the statement of cash flows. The first time a company 
sells shares of stock to the general public, this sale is called an initial public 
offering (IPO; see Chapter 3 for more information). Whenever a company 
decides to sell additional shares to raise capital, all additional sales of stock 
are called secondary public offerings.
Usually, when companies decide to do a secondary public offering, they do 
so to raise cash for a specific project or group of projects that they can’t fund 
by ongoing operations. The financial department must determine whether it 
wants to raise funds for these new projects by borrowing money (new debt) or 
by issuing stock (new equity). If the company already has a great deal of debt 
and finds that borrowing more is difficult, it may try to sell additional shares to 
cover the shortfall. I talk more about debt versus equity in Chapter 12.
Buying back stock
Sometimes you see a line item in the financing section indicating that a com-
pany has bought back its stock. Most often, companies that announce a stock 
buyback are trying to accomplish one of two things:

116
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
 
✓ Increase the market price of their stock. (If companies buy back their 
stock, fewer shares remain on the market, thus raising the value of 
shares still available for purchase.)
 
✓ Meet internal obligations regarding employee stock options, which guar-
antee employees the opportunity to buy shares of stock at a price that’s 
usually below the price outsiders must pay for the stock.
Sometimes a company buys back stock with the intention of going private 
(see Chapter 3). In this case, company executives and the board of directors 
decide that they no longer want to operate under the watchful eyes of inves-
tors and the government. Instead, they prefer to operate under a veil of pri-
vacy and not to have to worry about satisfying so many company outsiders. I 
discuss the advantages and disadvantages of staying private in Chapter 3.
For many firms, an announcement that they’re buying back stock is an indica-
tion that they’re doing well financially and that the executives believe in their 
company’s growth prospects for the future. Because buybacks reduce the 
number of outstanding shares, a company can make its per-share numbers 
look better even though a fundamental change hasn’t occurred in the busi-
ness’s operations.
 
If you see a big jump in earnings per share, look for an indication of stock buy-
back in the financing-activities section of the statement of cash flows.
Paying dividends
Whenever a company pays dividends, it shows the amount paid to share-
holders in the financing-activities section. Companies aren’t required to pay 
dividends each year, but they rarely stop paying dividends after the share-
holders have gotten used to their dividend checks.
 
If a company retrenches on its decision to pay dividends, the market price of 
the stock is sure to tumble. The company’s decision not to pay dividends after 
paying them in the previous quarter or previous year usually indicates that 
it’s having problems, and it raises a huge red flag on Wall Street.
Incurring new debt
When a company borrows money for the long term, this new debt is also 
shown in the financing-activities section. This type of new debt includes the 
issuance of bonds, notes, or other forms of long-term financing, such as a 
mortgage on a building.

117
 Chapter 8: The Statement of Cash Flows 
 
When you read the statement of cash flows and see that the company has 
taken on new debt, be sure to look for explanations in the management’s dis-
cussion and analysis and the notes to the financial statements about how the 
company is using this debt (see Chapter 9).
Paying off debt
Debt payoff is usually a good sign, often indicating that the company is doing 
well. However, it may also be an indication that the company is simply rolling 
over existing debt into another type of debt instrument.
 
If you see that the company paid off one debt and took on another debt that 
costs about the same amount of money, this likely indicates that the firm 
simply refinanced the original debt. Ideally, that refinancing involves lowering 
the company’s interest expenses. Look for a full explanation of the debt payoff 
in the notes to the financial statements.
 If you compare the financing activities of Mattel and Hasbro, you see that 
Mattel paid off long-term debt, bought back stock, and paid dividends to 
deplete its cash holdings. Hasbro also paid dividends and purchased common 
stock. Mattel used $587.8 million of its cash for its financing activities, while 
Hasbro used $433.9 million.
When you look at the financing activities on a statement of cash flows for 
younger companies, you usually see financing activities that raise capital. 
Their statements include funds borrowed or stock issued to raise cash. 
Older, more established companies begin paying off their debt and buying 
back stock when they’ve generated enough cash from operations.
Recognizing the Special Line Items
Sometimes you see line items on the statement of cash flows that appear 
unique to a specific company. Businesses use these line items in special 
circumstances, such as the discontinuation of operations. Companies that 
have international operations use a line item that relates to exchanging cash 
among different countries, which is called foreign exchange.
Discontinued operations
If a company discontinues operations (stops the activities of a part of its busi-
ness), you usually see a special line item on the statement of cash flows that 
shows whether the discontinued operations have increased or decreased the 

118
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
amount of cash the company takes in or distributes. Sometimes, discontin-
ued operations increase cash because the firm no longer has to pay the sala-
ries and other costs related to that operation.
Other times, discontinued operations can be a one-time hit to profits because 
the company has to make significant severance payments to laid-off employ-
ees and has to continue paying manufacturing and other fixed costs related to 
those operations. For example, if a company leases space for the discontinued 
operations, it’s contractually obligated to continue paying for that space until 
the contract is up or the company finds someone to sublease the space.
Foreign currency exchange
Whenever a company has global operations, it’s certain to have some costs 
related to moving currency from one country to another. The U.S. dollar, as 
well as currencies from other countries, experiences changes in currency 
exchange rates — sometimes 100 times a day or more.
 Each time the dollar exchange rate between two countries changes, moving 
currency between those countries can result in a loss or a gain. Any losses 
or gains related to foreign currency exchanges are shown on a special line 
item on the statement of cash flows called “Effect of currency exchange rate 
changes on cash.” Both Mattel and Hasbro show the effects of currency 
exchange on their statements in 2007 — Hasbro’s net cash increased by $3.6 
million and Mattel’s increased by $8.1 million.
Adding It All Up
This is the big one, the highlight, the bottom line: “Cash and short-term 
investments at end of year.” This number actually shows you how much cash 
or cash equivalents a company has on hand for continuing operations the 
next year.
Cash equivalents are any holdings that the company can easily change to cash, 
such as cash, cash in checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit 
that are redeemable in less than 90 days, money-market funds, and stocks that 
are sold on the major exchanges that can be easily converted to cash.
The top line of the statement starts with net income. Adjustments are made 
to show the impact on cash from operations, investing activities, and financ-
ing. These adjustments convert that net income figure to actual cash avail-
able for continuing operations. Remember that this is the cash on hand that 
the company can use to continue its activities the next year.

119
 Chapter 8: The Statement of Cash Flows 
 If you look at the statement of cash flows for Mattel and Hasbro, you can see 
that Mattel had about $901.2 million on hand at the end of December 2007 on 
net earnings of $600 million. Hasbro had about $774.5 million in cash and cash 
equivalents at the end of December 2007 on net earnings of $333 million. Even 
though Mattel had higher net income, its net cash actually decreased during 
the year, whereas Hasbro’s net cash actually increased.
In Part III, I delve more deeply into how the cash results of these two com-
panies differ. I also show you how you can use the figures on the statement 
of cash flows and other statements in the financial reports to analyze the 
results and make judgments about a company’s financial position.

W
ould you ever sign an important contract without reading the fine 
print first? I didn’t think so. Remember this philosophy when you 
read financial statements because the corporate world certainly doesn’t 
escape the cliché about sweeping ashes under the rug. Hiding problems in 
the notes to the financial statements is a common practice for companies in 
trouble.
In this chapter, I explain the role of the notes as part of the financial state-
ments, I discuss the most common issues addressed in the notes, and I point 
out some key warning signs that should raise a red flag if you see them men-
tioned in the notes. And to help you become a note-reading expert, I refer to 
the financial reports of Hasbro and Mattel (both toy companies) throughout 
the chapter. (You can view their complete annual reports at www.hasbro.
com and www.mattel.com.)
 
When searching for a company’s financial reports on its Web site, first find 
the corporation information section. Within that section you find the investor-
relations section, which should contain links to the company’s annual and 
quarterly reports.

122
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
Deciphering the Small Print
Figuring out how to read and understand the small print of the notes to the 
financial statements can be a daunting task. Most times, companies present 
these notes in the least visually appealing way and deliberately fill them with 
accounting jargon so they’re hard for the general public to understand. By 
making these notes so difficult to decipher, companies fulfill their obliga-
tions to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to give the required 
financial report to the reader, but at the same time, they make it hard for the 
reader to actually understand the information presented.
But don’t give up. These notes contain lots of important information that you 
need to know, including accounting methods used, red flags about a compa-
ny’s finances, and any legal entanglements that may threaten the company’s 
future. I point out the key sections of the notes to the financial statements 
and what types of information to pluck out of these sections.
The first indication of the notes to the financial statements appears at the 
bottom of the financial statements. You see an indication that the accompa-
nying notes are an integral part of the statement. In the same small print, you 
find the actual notes on numerous pages after the financial statements.
 
The information on the financial statement is just a listing of numbers. To 
really analyze how well a company is doing financially, you need to under-
stand what the numbers mean and what decisions the company made to get 
the numbers. Sometimes a line item refers you to a specific note, but most 
times, you see only a general reference to the notes at the bottom of the 
statement.
The notes have no specific format, but you’re likely to find at least one note 
regarding several key issues in every company’s financial report. Read on to 
find out what these key issues are.
Accounting Policies Note: Laying 
Out the Rules of the Road
The first note in almost every company’s financial report gives you the 
ammunition you need to understand the accounting policies used to develop 
the financial statements. This note explains the accounting rules the com-
pany used to develop its numbers. The note is usually called the “Summary 
of significant accounting policies.” Issues discussed in this note include:

123
 Chapter 9: Scouring the Notes to the Financial Statements
 
✓ Asset types: This describes the types of things owned by the company. 
(See Chapters 4 and 6 for more information on assets.)
 
✓ Method of valuation: This explains how the company values its assets. 
(See Chapters 4 and 6 for more information on valuation.)
 
✓ Methods of depreciation and amortization: This details the methods 
the firm uses to show the use of its assets. (See Chapters 4 and 6 for 
more information on depreciation and amortization.)
 
✓ How revenue and expenses are recognized: This explains how the 
company records the money it takes in from sales and the money it pays 
out to cover its expenses. (See Chapters 4 and 7 for more information on 
revenue and expenses.)
 
✓ Pensions: This lists the obligations the business has to its current and 
future retirees.
 
✓ Risk management: This discusses what the company does to minimize 
its risk.
 
✓ Stock-based compensation: This describes employee incentive plans 
involving stock ownership.
 
✓ Income taxes: This explains the company’s income tax obligations and 
the amount the company paid in taxes.
 
Read the summary of significant accounting policies carefully. If you don’t 
understand a policy, research it further so you can make a judgment about 
how this policy may impact the company’s financial position. You can either 
research the issue yourself on the Internet or call the company’s investor 
relations office to ask questions. Also, compare policies among the compa-
nies you’re analyzing. You want to see whether the differences in the ways 
companies handle the valuation of assets or the recognition of revenues and 
expenses make it more difficult for you to analyze and compare the results.
For example, if companies use different methods to value their inventory, 
this can have a major impact on net income. I explain the impact of inventory 
valuation on net income in Chapter 15. Many times, you won’t actually have 
enough details to make apples-to-apples comparisons of two firms that use 
different accounting policies, but you need to be aware that the policies differ 
as you analyze the companies’ financial results and be alert to the fact that 
you may be comparing apples to oranges.
Depreciation
One significant difference in accounting policies that can affect the bottom 
line is the amount of time a company allows for the depreciation of assets. 
Although one company may use a 15- to 25-year time frame, another may use 

124
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
a 10- to 40-year span. The time frame used for depreciation directly impacts 
the value of the assets, which is recorded on the line item of the balance 
sheet called “Cost less accumulated depreciation.” A faster depreciation 
method reduces the value of these assets more quickly.
Depreciation expenses are also deducted from general revenue. A company 
that writes off its buildings quickly — say in 25 years rather than up to 40 
years — has higher depreciation expenses and lower net income than a com-
pany that takes longer to write off its buildings. I discuss how depreciation 
works in greater detail in Chapter 4.
Revenue
You can find some noteworthy differences between companies by reading 
the revenue recognition section of the summary of significant accounting pol-
icies. Differences regarding the timing of revenue recognition can impact the 
total revenues reported. For example, one company may recognize revenue 
when a product is shipped to the customer. Another company may recognize 
revenue when the customer receives the product. If products are shipped at 
the end of the month, a company that includes shipped products will include 
the revenue in that month, but a company that only recognizes revenue when 
products are received may not include the revenue until the next month.
Other revenue recognition differences you should pay attention to include
 
✓ Sales price: Some companies sell products with a fixed sales price, while 
others indicate that prices aren’t fixed and are determined between the 
company and the customer.
 
✓ Collectibility: Some companies may indicate that whether they report 
income depends on whether all the revenue is likely to be collected. 
Successful collection can depend on the business environment, a cus-
tomer’s financial condition, historical collection experience, accounts 
receivable aging, and customer disputes. If collectibility is uncertain, the 
revenue isn’t reported. I talk more about accounts receivable collections 
and how to analyze them in Chapter 16.
Expenses
Expenses differ widely among companies. As you read this part of the 
accounting policies note, be sure to notice the types of expenses the com-
pany chooses to highlight. Sometimes the differences between companies 
can actually give you insight into how the companies operate. Here are 
two key areas where you may see differences in how a company reports 
expenses:

125
 Chapter 9: Scouring the Notes to the Financial Statements
 
✓ Product development: Some companies develop all their products in-
house, whereas others pay royalties to inventors, designers, and others 
to develop and market new products. In-house product development is 
reported as research and development expenses. If the company devel-
ops new products primarily by using outside sources, these expenses 
are in a line item for royalty expenses.
 
✓ Advertising: Some companies indicate that all advertising is expensed at 
the time the advertising is printed or aired. Others may write off adver-
tising over a longer period of time. Companies that depend on catalog 
sales are likely to spread out their ad expenses over several months or 
even a year if they can prove that sales continued to come in during that 
longer period of time.
 
As you compare two firms’ financial reports, look for both the similarities and 
differences in their accounting policies. You may need to make some assump-
tions regarding the financial statements in order to compare apples to apples 
when trying to decide which company is the better investment. For example, 
if the companies depreciate assets differently, you must remember that their 
asset valuations aren’t the same, nor are their depreciation expenses (based 
on the same assumptions).
 Sometimes you find a special note when a significant event impacts company 
operations. Such an event did occur for Mattel, and it’s reflected in a special 
note entitled “Note 4 — Product Recalls and Withdrawals.” During 2007, Mattel 
had several major recalls because of defective products manufactured in 
China. In response to these recalls, Mattel wrote:
As a result of third quarter 2007 recalls, Mattel intentionally slowed down 
its shipments out of Asia while it conducted extensive product testing in the 
third quarter 2007. Also, export licenses at several manufacturing facilities 
in China were temporarily suspended in September 2007 while safety proce-
dures were reviewed, but all licenses were in place on December 31, 2007. 
Mattel’s ability to import products into certain countries was also temporar-
ily impacted by product recalls as certain countries and regulatory authori-
ties reviewed Mattel’s safety procedures; however, these import and export 
issues were largely resolved early in the fourth quarter of 2007 and did not 
have a significant financial impact on Mattel’s 2007 results.
Although Mattel states the recalls didn’t have a significant impact on its 
bottom line, costs to straighten out this mess legally and administratively 
totaled $42 million, according to Note 4. Product recalls cost the company 
another $68.4 million. Luckily for Mattel, the company was able to put a 
fix in place before its key fourth quarter sales period during the holiday 
season. Otherwise, some popular Mattel toys may not have been available 
for Christmas and Chanukah shoppers. But that $110.4 ($42 + $68.4) million 
equaled about 18 percent of Mattel’s net income of about $600 million, which 
to me seems like a significant impact.

Figuring Out Financial Borrowings 
and Other Commitments
How a company manages its debt is critical to its short- and long-term profit-
ability. You can find out a lot about a company’s financial management by 
reading the notes related to financial commitments.
You always find at least one note about the financial borrowings and other 
commitments that impact the short- and long-term financial health of the 
company.
 Mattel has one note that summarizes everything under one umbrella called 
“Seasonal financing and long-term debt.” Hasbro splits this note into two. One 
is called “Financing arrangements,” for the short-term borrowings and other 
special arrangements, and the second is called “Long-term debt.”
 
No matter how a company structures its notes related to financial borrowings 
and other commitments, as you read the notes, break the information down 
into two piles: long-term borrowings and short-term borrowings. The long-term 
borrowings involve financial obligations of more than one year, and the short-
term borrowings involve obligations due within the 12-month period being dis-
cussed in the financial report.
Long-term obligations
For accounting purposes on the financial statements, only two types of debt 
are recognized: current debt and long-term debt. Current debt is due over the 
next 12 months, and long-term debt includes debt that a company must pay 
during any period beyond the next 12 months. Both medium- and long-term 
notes or bonds fall into the long-term debt category. Medium-term notes or 
bonds are debt that a company borrows for two to ten years. Long-term notes 
or bonds include all debt borrowed for over ten years.
In the discussion of long-term financial debts, you find two key charts. One 
chart shows the terms of the borrowings, and the other shows the amount 
of cash that the company must pay toward this debt for each of the next five 
years and beyond.
 Table 9-1 shows Mattel’s long-term debt.

If a company is managing its debt well, it will frequently be looking for 
opportunities to lower its interest expenses. Because interest rates have 
dropped considerably, when you see interest rates on these charts that are 
significantly higher than interest rates available in the current market envi-
ronment, you should wonder whether the company is doing a good job of 
managing its debt.

In 2003, Hasbro retired long-term debt with an interest rate of 8.5 percent by 
selling $250,000 of senior convertible debentures (a type of debt that can be 
converted to stock) with an interest rate of only 2.75 percent. Hasbro is still 
benefiting from this decision, and a large share of its long-term debt is still 
at this low rate. This interest rate can be adjusted upward, depending on the 
value of the company’s stock. These debentures are convertible to stock, but 
Hasbro indicates that it will buy back the debentures in cash rather than in 
shares of the company if a debenture holder indicates that she wants to con-
vert the debenture.
 You can compare the two companies’ debt obligations by looking at the 
installments due for the next five years and beyond. Table 9-3 compares the 
long-term debt payments for Hasbro and Mattel; this information is found in 
the note about financial borrowings and other commitments.

 Chapter 9: Scouring the Notes to the Financial Statements
Looking at Table 9-3, you can see that Hasbro has only one payment on long-
term debt of $135,092,000, with no payments due from 2009 to 2012 thanks to 
the debentures due in 2021. You can find out this information only by looking 
at the details in the notes. But Hasbro will still owe $709.7 million after 2012, 
and Mattel’s long-term debt will be paid off with one payment of $50 million 
in 2013.
I take a closer look at this issue and how it impacts the companies’ liquidity 
in Chapter 12. I also show you how potential lenders analyze a company’s 
borrowing habits.
Short-term debt
Short-term debt can have a greater impact than long-term debt on a compa-
ny’s earnings each year, as well as on the amount of cash available for opera-
tions. The reason is that companies must pay short-term debt over the next 
12 months, whereas for long-term debt, they must pay only interest and some 
of the principal in the next 12 months.
The type of short-term debt you see on a firm’s balance sheet varies greatly, 
depending on the type of business. Companies whose sales are seasonal 
may carry a lot more short-term debt to get themselves through the slow 
times than companies that have a consistent cash flow from sales through-
out the year.
Seasonal companies carry large lines of credit to help them buy or produce 
their products during the off-season times so they can have enough product 
to sell during the high season. For example, a company that sells toys sells 
most of its product during the Christmas or other peak toy-selling seasons; 
during the other times of the year, it has very low sales. So Mattel and 
Hasbro — both toy companies with significant seasonal financing needs — 
maintain large lines of credit to be ready for Christmas and peak toy-selling 
seasons.
Another way that firms raise cash if they don’t have enough on hand is to 
sell their accounts receivable (credit extended to customers). A company 
can sell the receivables to a bank or other financial institution and quickly 
get cash for immediate needs rather than wait for the customers to pay. I talk 
more about accounts receivable management in Chapter 16.
 
Be sure to look for a statement in the financial obligations notes that indicates 
how the company is meeting its cash needs and whether it’s having any dif-
ficulty meeting those needs. Some companies use “financial obligations” in the 
title of the note; others may have one note on short-term debt obligations and 
another on long-term debt obligations.

130
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
Lease obligations
Rather than purchase plants, equipment, and facilities, many companies 
choose to lease them. You usually find at least one note to the financial state-
ments that spells out a company’s lease obligations. Many analysts consider 
lease obligations to be just another type of debt financing that doesn’t have 
to be shown on the balance sheet. Whether the lease is shown on the balance 
sheet or in the notes depends on the type of lease:
 
✓ Capital leases: These leases provide ownership at no cost or at a greatly 
reduced cost at the end of the lease. This type of lease is shown as a 
long-term debt obligation on the balance sheet.
 
✓ Operating leases: These leases offer no ownership provisions or provi-
sions that require a considerable amount of cash to purchase the leased 
item. This type of lease is mentioned in the notes to the financial state-
ments but isn’t shown on the balance sheet as debt.
Companies that must constantly update certain types of equipment to avoid 
obsolescence use operating leases rather than capital leases. At the end of 
the lease period, the companies return the equipment and replace it by leas-
ing new, updated equipment. Operating leases have the lowest monthly 
payments.
 
When reading the notes, be sure to look for an explanation of the types of 
leases the company has and what percentage of its fixed assets are under 
operating leases. Some high-tech companies have larger obligations in oper-
ating-lease payments than they do in long-term liabilities. When calculating 
debt ratios (ratios that show the proportion of debt versus the type of asset or 
equity being considered; I show you how to calculate debt ratios in Chapter 
12), many analysts use at least two-thirds, and sometimes the entire amount, 
of these hidden operating-lease costs in their debt-measurement calculations 
to judge a company’s liquidity.
 
When you see operating leases that total close to 50 percent of a firm’s net 
fixed assets or that exceed the total of its long-term liabilities, be sure to use 
at least two-thirds of the obligations, if not all the payments, in your debt-
measurement calculations. The fact that these obligations are only mentioned 
in the notes to the financial statements doesn’t negate their potential role in 
creating future cash problems for the company.

131
 Chapter 9: Scouring the Notes to the Financial Statements
Mergers and Acquisitions: 
Noteworthy Information
Sometimes one company decides to buy another. Other times, two compa-
nies decide to merge into one.
If a company acquires another company or merges during the year covered 
by the annual report, a note to the financial statements is dedicated to the 
financial implications of that transaction. In this note, you see information 
about
 
✓ The market value of the company purchased
 
✓ The amount paid for the company
 
✓ Any exchange of stock involved in the transaction
 
✓ The transaction’s impact on the bottom line
When a company acquires another company, it frequently pays more for that 
acquisition than for the total value of the purchased company’s assets. The 
additional money spent to buy the firm falls into the line item called goodwill. 
Goodwill includes added value for customer base, locations, customer loy-
alty, and intangible factors that increase a business’s value. If a company has 
goodwill built over the years from previous mergers or acquisitions, you see 
that indicated on the balance sheet as an asset. I discuss goodwill in greater 
detail in Chapter 4.
 
In an acquisition, the acquired company’s net income is added to the parent 
company’s bottom line. This addition occurs even if the closing of the sale 
takes place at the end of the year. Many times, this addition can inflate the 
bottom line and make the net income look better than it actually will be when 
the companies are fully merged. Be sure to look closely at the impact any 
mergers, acquisitions, or even sales of parts of an acquired company have on 
net income.
 
A merger or acquisition may positively impact the bottom line for a year or 
two, and then the company’s performance drops dramatically as it sorts out 
various issues regarding overlapping operations and staff. Many times, the 
announcement of a merger or acquisition generates excitement, causing stock 
prices to skyrocket temporarily before dropping back to a more realistic 
value. Don’t get caught up in the short-term euphoria of a merger or acquisi-
tion when you’re considering the purchase of stocks. Read the details in the 
notes to the financial statements to find out more about the true impacts of 
the merger or acquisition transaction.

Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
Pondering Pension and 
Retirement Benefits
You may not think of pension and other retirement benefits as types of debt, 
but they are. In fact, for most companies that offer pension benefits, the 
amount of money they owe their employees is higher than the amount they 
owe to bondholders and banks. Some companies offer both pensions (which 
are an obligation to pay retirees a certain amount for the rest of their lives after 
they leave the company) and other retirement benefits (which include contri-
butions to retirement savings plans such as 401(k)s or profit-sharing plans).
When looking at the note about pension and other retirement benefits, find 
out which type of plan the company offers:
 
✓ Defined benefit plan: The company promises a retirement benefit to 
each of its employees and is obligated to pay that benefit. This type of 
plan includes traditional retirement plans, in which employees get a set 
monthly or annual benefit from the company after retirement.
 
 Defined benefit plans carry obligations for the firm for as long as an 
employee lives and, sometimes, for as long as both the employee and 
his spouse live. Determining how much that benefit will cost in the 
future is based on assumptions regarding how much return the com-
pany expects from its retirement portfolios and how long its employees 
and their spouses will live after retirement. As people live longer, pen-
sion obligations become much greater for those companies that offer 
defined benefit plans.
 
✓ Defined contribution plan: The employer and employee both make 
contributions to a retirement plan. A 401(k) is an example of a defined 
contribution plan. The company isn’t required to pay any additional 
money to the employee after the employee retires and pulls her retire-
ment funds from the company’s plan, rolling the funds into individual 
retirement savings or an annuity option. An annuity is a type of insur-
ance policy that guarantees a set payment based on terms set up at the 
time the annuity is purchased.
 
In the notes to the financial statements, you find a calculation of the expected 
pension expense, the funding position of the plan, and the expectations for the 
future obligations of that plan based on complicated assumptions figured by 
an actuary (a statistician who looks at life span and other risk factors to make 
assumptions about the company’s long-term pension obligations). Insurance 
companies commonly use actuaries to determine costs for life, health, and 
other insurance products.

133
 Chapter 9: Scouring the Notes to the Financial Statements
 
In the pension and retirement benefits note, you find a chart that shows the 
annual payments currently being made to retirees. If you see these payments 
increasing more rapidly each year, it may be a sign of a long-term problem for 
the business. Companies should provide a table that shows the current plan 
assets at fair value and projects their ability to meet pension obligations in 
the future.
 
You need to compare a number of figures that companies use in calculating 
their estimates for pension obligations. You should see similar assumptions 
used by companies in similar industries. Numbers to watch include the
 
✓ Discount rate: The interest rate used to determine the present value of 
the projected benefit obligations.
 
✓ Rate of return on assets: The long-term return the company expects to 
earn on the assets in the retirement investment portfolio.
 
✓ Rate of compensation increases: The estimate the company makes 
related to salary increases and the impact those increases have on 
future pension obligations.
Each of these rates requires that assumptions be made about unknown 
future events involving the state of the economy, interest rates, investment 
returns, and employee life spans. A company can do no more than make an 
educated guess. To be sure that the company’s guesses are reasonable, all 
you can do is check that it makes guesses that are similar to those of other 
companies in the same industry. You also should look for information in the 
notes about whether the company’s retirement savings portfolio is sufficient 
to meet its expected current and future pension obligations. This information 
is usually shown in a chart as part of the note. If the company’s retirement 
savings portfolio falls short, it could be a red flag that future cash-flow prob-
lems are possible.
Breaking Down Business Breakdowns
Can you imagine what it takes to manage a multibillion-dollar company? Just 
reading the numbers can be a daunting task. Think about how many products 
are sent out to make that many sales and how many people are needed to 
keep the business afloat.
Most major firms deal with their massive size by splitting up the company 
into manageable segments. This division makes managing all aspects of the 
business — from product development to product distribution to customer 
satisfaction — easier.

134
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
These segments help the company track the performance of each of its 
product lines more easily. In the notes to the financial statements, you find 
at least one note related to these segment breakdowns. This note gives you 
details about how each of the company’s segments is doing, as well as about 
the product lines that fall under each segment.
You may also find some details about
 
✓ Target markets: These are the key market segments that the company 
targets, such as age group (teens, tots, adults), locations (north, south, 
east, west), or interest groups (sportsmen, hobbyists, and so on). Target 
markets are limited only by the creativity of the marketing team, which 
develops the groups of customers that it wants to win over.
 
✓ The largest customers: The company usually names the top customers 
that buy its products. For example, a manufacturer that sells a large por-
tion of its products to major retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target will 
usually give some details about these relationships.
 
✓ Manufacturing and other operational details: The company gives you 
information about how it groups its product manufacturing and where 
its products are manufactured. If the firm manufactures its products 
internationally, look for indications about problems that may have 
occurred during the year related to those operations. Sometimes labor 
or political strife can have a great impact on a company’s manufacturing 
operations. Also, weather conditions can greatly impact manufacturing 
conditions. For example, if the company’s manufacturing for a certain 
product line is in Singapore and Singapore experienced numerous dam-
aging storms, the company may indicate that the problem occurred and 
that it had difficulty producing enough product for market.
 
✓ Trade sanctions: All companies that operate internationally must deal 
with trade laws, which differ in every country. Some countries impose 
high tariffs on products coming from outside their borders to discour-
age importing. Sometimes countries impose sanctions on other coun-
tries for actions taken by politicians they disagree with. For example, the 
U.S. doesn’t allow trade with Cuba for political reasons, so a business 
that buys products from Cuba can’t import into the U.S. The U.S. and 
Europe are considering imposing sanctions on China because they don’t 
agree with some of China’s human rights policies and other policies. If 
the U.S. and Europe do so, importing products from China will be much 
more expensive for companies.
 
If a company faces specific marketing or manufacturing problems, you also 
find details about these problems in the note about segment breakdowns. 
Don’t skip over this note!

135
 Chapter 9: Scouring the Notes to the Financial Statements
How a company breaks down its management segments varies depending 
on the industry and management preferences. Some companies divide into 
regions based on geography; others designate segments based on product 
lines or customer target groups.
If a company operates internationally, you usually see the U.S. market seg-
ments separated from the non-U.S. segments, and sometimes you find the 
international portion broken into regions, such as Europe, Asia, or the 
Middle East.
You won’t find any hard-and-fast rules about how to segment a business. How 
a company segments itself depends on how the company has operated his-
torically or what the management style is of the company’s executives.
Reviewing Significant Events
Each year, every company faces significant challenges. One year, a firm may 
find out that its customers are suing it for a defective product. Another year, 
a business may get notice from a state or local government that one of its 
manufacturing facilities is polluting the environment.
You may also find in the notes mention of significant events that aren’t 
related to external forces, such as the decision to close a factory or combine 
two divisions into one.
You can look in a number of places in the notes for information on significant 
events. Sometimes an event has its own note, such as a note about the dis-
continuation of operations. Other times the event is just part of a note called 
“Commitments and Contingencies.” Scan the notes to find significant events 
that impact the company’s financial position. You’re most likely to find sig-
nificant events regarding topics such as
 
✓ Lawsuits: The company should explain any pending lawsuits (usually 
in the “Commitments and Contingencies” note), which can sometimes 
have a huge impact on the company’s future. For example, Dow Corning, 
which is owned by Dow Chemical Corporation, is still suffering finan-
cially from lawsuits by women who face significant health problems 
from breast implants made by the company. The breast implants first hit 
the market in 1962. Suits were filed against the company beginning in the 
1990s, when the breast implants ruptured and caused health problems. 
Dow Corning ended up in bankruptcy trying to settle these lawsuits.

136
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
 
✓ Environmental concerns: These concerns can become a significant 
event if the company is involved in a major environmental cleanup 
because of discharges from one of its plants. Cleanup can cost millions 
of dollars. For example, Exxon has paid more than $7 billion in repara-
tions and fines for damages related to the Valdez oil spill in Alaska’s 
Prince William Sound in 1989.
 
✓ Restructuring: Any time a company decides to regroup its products, 
close down a plant, or make some other major change to the way it does 
business, this action is called restructuring. You usually find an individual 
note explaining the restructuring and how it will impact the company’s 
income in the current year and future years.
 
✓ Discontinued operations: Sometimes a company decides not to restruc-
ture but to close down an operation entirely. When this happens, you’re 
likely to find a separate note on the financial impact of the discontinued 
operations, which likely includes the costs of closing down facilities and 
laying off or relocating employees.
Many times the information included in these notes discusses not only the 
financial impact of an event in the current year but also any impact expected 
on financial performance in future years.
When a company discusses lawsuits and potential environmental liability 
cases in the notes, it commonly indicates that in the opinion of management, 
the matter in question won’t result in a material loss. Use your own judgment 
after reading the details that management provides. If you think the company 
may be facing bigger problems than it mentions, do your own research on 
the matter before investing in that company.
 
A company facing a lawsuit isn’t necessarily a matter of great concern. Given 
the litigious nature of society, most major corporations face lawsuits annually. 
But sometimes these suits do raise red flags.
Finding the Red Flags
As you probably know by now, companies love hiding their dirty laundry in 
the small print of the notes to the financial statements. As you read through 
the notes, keep an eye out for possible red flags.
 
Whenever you see notes titled “Restructuring,” “Discontinued operations,” 
and “Accounting changes,” look for red flags that could mean continuing 
expenses for a number of years. The company will detail the costs of any of 
these changes. Be sure to consider long-term financial impacts that could be 
a drain on the company’s future earnings — which may mean stock prices 
will suffer.

137
 Chapter 9: Scouring the Notes to the Financial Statements
 
Also be on the lookout for potential lawsuits that could result in huge settle-
ments. If you see that a lawsuit has been filed against the company, search 
for stories in the financial press that discuss the lawsuit in greater detail than 
what’s included in the notes.
Significant events aren’t the only things that can raise red flags. You may also 
see signs of trouble in the way that the company values assets or in decisions 
it makes to change accounting policies. The notes involving the long-term 
obligations the company has to its retirees may also be a good spot to find 
some potential red flags.
 
The financial press often mentions red flags that analysts spot in companies’ 
financial reports. Read the financial press to pick up the potential problem 
spots and look for the details in the financial statements and the notes to 
those statements.
Finding out about valuing 
assets and liabilities
Valuing assets and liabilities leaves room for accounting creativity. If assets 
are overvalued, you may be led to believe that the company owns more than 
it actually does. If liabilities are undervalued, you may think the company 
owes less than it actually does. Either way, you get a false impression about 
the company’s financial position.
 
When you don’t understand something, ask questions of the firm’s investor 
relations staff until they present the information in a manner that you under-
stand. If you’re confused about the presentation of asset or liability valuation, 
I guarantee that other financial readers are confused as well. I often find that 
the more convoluted a company’s explanation is, the more likely you are to 
find out that the company is hiding something.
Considering changes in 
accounting policies
How a company puts together its numbers is just as critical as the numbers 
themselves. The accounting policies adopted by the company drive these 
numbers. Whenever a firm indicates in the notes to the financial statements 
that it’s changing accounting policies, your red flag should go up. I discuss 
the key accounting policies and how they can impact income in the section 
“Accounting Policies Note: Laying Out the Rules of the Road,” earlier in this 
chapter. You can find more details about accounting policies in Chapter 4.

138
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
Changes in accounting policies aren’t always a sign of a problem. In fact, 
many times the change is related to requirements specified by the Financial 
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or the SEC. No matter what the reason 
for the change, be sure you understand how that change impacts your ability 
to compare year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter results.
 
If you see a change in accounting methods but you don’t see an indication that 
the FASB or SEC required it, dig deeper into the reasons for the change and 
find out how the change impacts the valuation of assets and liabilities or the 
company’s net income. You can find some explanation in the accounting poli-
cies note, but if you don’t understand the explanation there, call the investor 
relations department and ask questions.
Decoding obligations to retirees 
and future retirees
As noted in the “Pondering Pension and Retirement Benefits” section earlier 
in this chapter, obligations to retirees and future retirees can be a bigger 
drain on a company’s resources than debt obligations. The note to the finan-
cial statements related to pension benefits is probably one of the most dif-
ficult to understand. Look specifically at the charts that show the company’s 
long-term payment obligations to retirees and the cash available to pay 
those obligations. If you find any indication that the company may have dif-
ficulty meeting the obligations mentioned in either the text of this note or the 
charts, this could be a sign of a major cash-flow problem in the future. Don’t 
hesitate to call and ask questions if you don’t understand the presentation.

Chapter 10
Considering Consolidated 
Financial Statements
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding consolidation
▶ Seeing how companies buy companies
▶ Exploring consolidated financial statements
▶ Turning to the notes for details
L
ike couples who marry and work to combine two incomes, two sets 
of financial obligations, and two ways of managing money, things get 
complicated when companies decide to join forces or buy other companies 
and their financial statements become one. This new arrangement can make 
it much harder for you to find out how each of the pieces of this new entity 
performs financially. In this chapter, I discuss how to read the more complex 
financial reports that arise when companies consolidate.
Getting a Grip on Consolidation
One of the ways businesses grow is by buying or merging with other compa-
nies. When a company is bought by another, it gets gobbled up in the new 
company and loses its identity. But when firms decide to merge, they usually 
decide jointly how the new company will operate and how the financial state-
ments will be presented.
Major corporations that own more than 50 percent of a company create 
financial reports for each division. These entities include subsidiaries, joint 
ventures, and associates. Here’s how they stack up:
 
✓ Subsidiaries are entities controlled by a larger entity, usually a corpora-
tion. The corporation controlling the subsidiary is called the parent com-
pany. I discuss the various ways a company can become a subsidiary in 
the next section, “Looking at Methods of Buying Up Companies.”

140
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
 
✓ Joint ventures are entities in which venturers (usually two or more 
corporations) share joint control over the economic activity.
 
✓ Associates are entities over which the parent company has significant 
influence but not the level of control it has over a subsidiary.
 
If a company’s financial report mentions these entities in any detail at all, you 
find it in the notes to the financial statements. Most times, you know only that 
a company has subsidiaries or associates, or participates in joint ventures, if 
you see “Consolidated” noted at the top of the page on the balance sheet (see 
Chapter 6) or income statement (see Chapter 7).
If you look at Mattel’s or Hasbro’s statements online (www.mattel.com; 
www.hasbro.com), you see that each statement indicates that it repre-
sents the financial results of the parent company and its subsidiaries. 
However, you don’t see any listing of what those subsidiaries are on the 
balance sheet or income statement. In fact, unless a company discusses a 
merger, acquisition, or sale of a subsidiary, associate, or joint venture in 
the notes to the financial statements, you probably won’t see them men-
tioned individually in the current year’s financial report. If no financial 
transactions occur in the year being reported, the company may only high-
light some of its subsidiaries’ successes in the narrative pages in the front 
of the financial report.
 General Electric is one of the few companies that handles one of its 
subsidiaries — General Electric Capital Services (GECS) — differently. 
Because this subsidiary’s financial activities and reporting are significantly 
different from its other business activities, as well as from its other sub-
sidiaries, associates, and joint ventures (which it groups under the title 
“Affiliates”), GECS gets its own column on the balance sheet (Financial 
Position) and income statement (Earnings), as Figures 10-1 and 10-2 show. 
Although most of GE’s activities are in the manufacturing realm, GECS is a 
financial services subsidiary that has very different financial operations.
I chose GE as an example for this chapter because the Association for 
Investment Management and Research (AIMR) has cited it as having one of the 
best practices for presenting financial information. In addition to separating 
GECS from the rest of the GE fold, GE makes reading the financial report easier 
by carefully indicating which note to the financial statements is relevant to a 
particular line item on the balance sheet or income statement.
 
You can see GE’s complete annual report online at www.ge.com/ar2007/
index.jsp. You even find active links to the relevant notes as you read 
through the financial statements online.

In the consolidating data on this page, “GE” means the basis of consolidation as described in 
note 1 to the consolidated financial statements; “GECS” means General Electric Capital Services, 
Inc. and all of its affiliates and associated companies. Transactions between GE and GECS have 
been eliminated from the “General Electric Company and consolidated affiliates” columns.
Most companies play a game of cat-and-mouse, hiding relevant data in the 
notes to the financial statements, hoping that you won’t take the time to find 
it in the small print. Look at the statements for Hasbro and Mattel on their 
Web sites. Neither statement mentions which notes are relevant to the line 
items on their balance sheets or income statements. Hasbro does highlight 
key notes on Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Other than that, you 
have to scour the notes to find out which material is relevant to which parts 
of each of their financial statements.
Looking at Methods of Buying 
Up Companies
One of the most common ways companies grow is by buying up smaller com-
panies. These smaller companies get completely gobbled up with no outward 
sign that they ever existed, or they become subsidiaries operating under the 
umbrella of the firm that bought them.

145
 Chapter 10: Considering Consolidated Financial Statements
A company can take control over another company by using any of three dif-
ferent methods: statutory merger, statutory consolidation, and stock acquisi-
tion. Only when a company buys another using the stock-acquisition method 
does it become a subsidiary. Here’s a brief overview of the ways one com-
pany can buy another:
 
✓ Statutory merger: This merger occurs when one company acquires all 
the assets of another and accepts the responsibilities of all its liabilities. 
The company that’s taken over goes out of business and is no longer a 
separate legal entity. The financial results of the business that disap-
peared become part of the consolidated financial results of the company 
that remains.
 
✓ Statutory consolidation: In this situation, two companies agree to 
combine to form one new entity; one company does not take over the 
other. When the transaction is complete, only one legal entity survives, 
either under one of the original names of the two companies or under a 
completely new name. Their financial results are combined in a consoli-
dated financial statement.
 
✓ Stock acquisition: In this case, two companies combine, but both 
remain separate legal entities after the transaction. The company that 
buys the stock emerges as the parent firm, and the other company 
becomes the subsidiary. The parent company takes on all the subsid-
iary’s responsibilities and liabilities, and the financial statements of the 
two are consolidated into the parent company’s financial statements.
 
 Two types of stock acquisition exist:
 
• Majority interest: When a company buys more than 50 percent 
of another company’s stock, this represents a majority interest. 
When a company buys 100 percent of another company’s stock but 
the two businesses don’t merge, the subsidiary is called a wholly 
owned subsidiary.
 
• Minority interest: When a company or individual owns less than 50 
percent of a corporation’s voting stock, that’s a minority interest. A 
consolidated balance sheet that indicates minority interest shows 
the interests of minority shareholders as a liability, an equity, or 
between the liabilities and equities sections.
Subsidiaries are the entities left in place after a company is acquired by 
another company using the stock-acquisition method. If you were a share-
holder in the subsidiary before it was bought out, you won’t find tracking the 
company that you originally owned easy. Instead, you’ll find that most of the 
financial detail is now just part of the consolidated financial statements of the 
larger firm.
 
Stock acquisition is the most common method for taking control of another 
company because it’s cheaper than paying for all the company’s assets. To 
control another company, a parent company needs to buy more than 50 

146
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
percent of its stock. This type of acquisition doesn’t require the difficult and 
more time-consuming negotiations that are necessary to take control of 100 
percent of a company. Sometimes, after a parent company takes control of 
another business, it continues buying stock over the next few years until it 
owns 100 percent of the stock.
Acquiring a company through stock acquisition is also easier than using the 
other takeover methods because the company’s shares are sold on the open 
market. One company can take over another simply by buying up those 
open-market shares.
Reading Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Most major corporations are made up of numerous companies bought along 
the way to create their empires. The financial statement for such a corpora-
tion reflects the financial results for all these entities it bought, as well as the 
original assets of the company.
After a stock acquisition by the parent company, the subsidiary continues 
to maintain separate accounting records. But in reality, the parent company 
controls the subsidiary, so it no longer operates completely independently. 
By accounting rules, the parent company must present its subsidiary’s and 
its own financial operations in a consolidated manner (even though the two 
companies may be separate legal entities). The parent company does so by 
publishing consolidated financial statements, which combine the assets, liabili-
ties, revenue, and expenses of the parent company with those of its affiliates 
(that is, its subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures).
 
If you hold a minority interest (see the previous section for more information 
on minority interest) in the subsidiary of a parent company, the consolidated 
financial statements won’t give you the information you need to make deci-
sions about your holdings. But in addition to having its report included in the 
consolidated financial statements, a subsidiary with minority shareholders 
must also report its financial results separately from its parent company.
When a company owns all the common stock of its subsidiaries, it doesn’t 
need to publish reports about the subsidiaries’ individual results for the gen-
eral public to peruse. Shareholders don’t even need to know the results of 
these subsidiaries.
In preparing consolidated financial statements, the parent company must 
eliminate numerous transactions between itself and its affiliates before pre-
senting the statements to the public. For example, the parent company must 
eliminate such transactions for accounts receivable and accounts payable 

147
 Chapter 10: Considering Consolidated Financial Statements
to avoid counting revenue twice and giving the financial report reader the 
impression that the consolidated entity has more profits or owes more money 
than it actually does. Other key transactions that a parent company must 
eliminate when preparing consolidated financial statements are
 
✓ Investments in the subsidiary: The parent company’s books show its 
investments in a subsidiary as an asset account. The subsidiary’s books 
show the stock that the parent company holds as shareholders’ equity. 
Rather than double-counting this type of transaction, the parent com-
pany eliminates it on the consolidated statements by writing off one 
transaction.
 
✓ Advances to the subsidiary: If a parent company advances money to a 
subsidiary or a subsidiary advances money to its parent company, both 
entities carry the opposite side of this transaction on their books (that 
is, one entity gains money while the other one loses it, or vice versa). 
Again, companies avoid the double transaction on the consolidated 
statements by getting rid of one transaction.
 
✓ Interest revenue and expenses: Sometimes a parent company loans 
money to a subsidiary or a subsidiary loans money to a parent company; 
in these business transactions, one company may charge the other one 
interest on the loan. On the consolidated statements, any interest rev-
enue or expenses that these loans generate must be eliminated.
 
✓ Dividend revenue and expenses: If a subsidiary declares a dividend, the 
parent company receives some of these dividends as revenue from the 
subsidiary. Anytime a parent company records revenue from its 
subsidiaries on its books, the parent company must eliminate any divi-
dend expenses that the subsidiary recorded on its books.
 
✓ Management fees: Sometimes a subsidiary pays its parent company 
a management fee for the administrative services it provides. These 
fees are recorded as revenue on the parent company’s books and as 
expenses on the subsidiary’s books.
 
✓ Sales and purchases: Parent companies frequently buy products or 
materials from their subsidiaries, and their subsidiaries buy products 
or materials from them. In fact, most companies that buy other compa-
nies do so within the same industry as a means of getting control of a 
product line, a customer base, or some other aspect of that company’s 
operations.
 
 However, the consolidated income statements shouldn’t show these 
sales as revenue and shouldn’t show the purchases as expenses. 
Otherwise, the company would be double-counting the transaction. 
Accounting rules require that parent companies eliminate these types of 
transactions.
As you can see, these major transactions are all critical for determining 
whether a company made a profit or loss from its activities. Eliminating 
assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses from public view makes 

148
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
determining a subsidiary’s financial results nearly impossible for sharehold-
ers or creditors. But if these transactions were included, the value of the 
parent company’s stock would be distorted because the transactions would 
be counted twice. The shareholders of the parent company wouldn’t know 
the true value of the company’s assets and liabilities; the income statement 
wouldn’t reflect the company’s true revenues and expenses.
 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB) tried to address the problem that shareholders and 
creditors of a subsidiary face by requiring parent companies to provide seg-
ment reporting (reporting about subsidiaries, business units, and divisions of 
the company), which you also find in the notes to the financial statements.
Looking to the Notes
The eliminations to adjust for reporting subsidiary results mentioned in the 
previous section don’t show up in the parent company’s financial reports 
unless some portion of the stock acquisition takes place in the year that’s 
being reported. When the acquisition or some financial impact of that acqui-
sition does take place in the year that’s being reported, you need to look 
to the notes to the financial statements to get details about any financial 
impacts.
In the first note to the consolidated financial statement, the company indi-
cates that the financial statements represent the results of the parent com-
pany, not its affiliates. The company also includes some statement about the 
eliminated transactions. Just to give you an example of how this is worded, 
here’s the information from GE’s notes:
“Financial data and related measurements are presented in the following 
categories:
“*GE: This represents the adding together of all affiliates other than General 
Electric Capital Services, Inc. (GECS), whose operations are presented on a 
one-line basis.”
Note that you don’t find out what subsidiaries fall under GE in this explana-
tion. You don’t find that detail in Mattel’s or Hasbro’s notes, either, as I dis-
cuss in Chapter 9. Few companies provide that detail. What GE does do that’s 
unique is show the results of GECS and indicate which subsidiaries fall under 
that subsidiary. Sound like a confusing house of cards? Yep, it sure is, which 
is what makes reading consolidated financial statements so difficult! Here’s 
what GE says about GECS:
“This affiliate owns all of the common stock of General Electric Capital 
Corporation (GE Capital). GE Capital and its respective affiliates are 
consolidated in the accompanying GECS columns and constitute the majority 
of its business.”

149
 Chapter 10: Considering Consolidated Financial Statements
After reading that statement, you can see that the financial statements are as 
clear as mud if you want to determine how GE Capital or any of its subsidiar-
ies are doing.
Mergers and acquisitions
If a company completes a merger or acquisition in the year that’s reported on 
the consolidated financial statement, you find a special note in the notes to 
the financial statements. Otherwise, if you want to find out any details about 
how the mergers and acquisitions may still be impacting the company finan-
cially, you have to start digging.
 
For example, if a company issues additional shares of stock to buy a subsid-
iary, the value of the stock held by shareholders before the acquisition is 
diluted, which means that the same earnings or assets must be divided among 
a greater number of pieces. To see how this works, imagine an example involv-
ing 100 shares of stock and a company profit of $100. In this scenario, each 
share of stock claims $1 of earnings. If, after the acquisition, 150 shares of 
stock are outstanding, each share of stock can claim only 67 cents of the $100 
of earnings. This diluted ownership impacts the amount of dividends or the 
portion of ownership you have in the company for the rest of the time you 
own that stock.
You can see how you need to play a game of cat-and-mouse to find all the 
little pieces of cheese laid out in the financial statements. Companies don’t 
make information easily accessible, and they often hide the financial impact 
of an acquisition or merger on the value of your shares by writing the notes 
to the financial statements in such a convoluted way that you have to be a 
detective to sort out the relevant details.
Goodwill
Another important note you can check out to find the impact of merg-
ers and acquisitions on the consolidated financial statements is the note 
that explains goodwill. Goodwill is the amount of money a company pays 
in excess of the value of the assets when it buys another company (see 
Chapters 4 and 6 for more details). For example, suppose a company has 
$100 million in assets, and another company offers to buy it for $150 million. 
That extra $50 million doesn’t represent tangible assets like inventory or 
property; it represents extra value because of customer loyalty, store loca-
tions, or other factors that add value. Goodwill is a factor only in the case of 
a merger or acquisition that involves acquiring 100 percent of the subsidiary 
or other affiliate.

150
Part II: Checking Out the Big Show: Annual Reports 
Liquidations or discontinued operations
Whenever a company sells a subsidiary or other affiliate or discontinues 
its operations, a note to the financial statements regarding this transac-
tion appears in the year in which the transaction first occurred. After the 
first year, any impact that a sale or a discontinuance of operations has on a 
company’s operating results is usually buried in other notes. Just like with 
mergers and acquisitions, you have to play detective to find out any ongoing 
impact that these changes have had on the company.
The company will include information in the notes about any profits or losses 
related to the liquidation of an asset or discontinued operations. Because 
these transactions can impact financial statements over a number of years, 
the fine print will include financial impacts for the years prior to the year 
being reported as well as anticipated future impacts.
 
When reading the consolidated financial statements and their related notes, 
be sure you look for any mention of the impact of previous mergers or acquisi-
tions of affiliates and how those transactions may still be impacting the finan-
cial statements. You may find notes related to impacts on the balance sheet, 
income statement, shareholders’ equity, or cash flows. Transactions involving 
affiliates can impact any of these statements.

Analyzing the 
Numbers

In this part . . .
I
 show you how to crack the numbers so you can find 
out whether the company whose report you’re reading 
is truly in a healthy financial position. I explain how to 
analyze the financial statements to test whether the com-
pany is profitable and liquid enough to continue operat-
ing. I also give you tips on how to test the company’s 
cash-flow situation.

W
ell, did the company make any money? That’s the question every-
one, and I mean everyone with a financial stake in the company — 
executives, investors, debtors, employees — wants the answer to. Investors 
especially want to know whether the company’s stock is worth the price 
they have to pay.
You may think the answer is a simple “yes” or “no,” but the answer always 
depends on many factors. How well did the business make use of its 
resources in order to make a profit? Was that profit high enough based on 
the resources the firm had on hand and compared with that of similar com-
panies? Did the company pay out a fair share of its earnings to its investors? 
Did it reinvest the right amount of money in its coffers for future growth?
In this chapter, I show you how to answer these key questions with calcula-
tions that help you test a company’s profitability and market value: price/
earnings ratio (P/E), dividend payout ratio, return on sales (ROS), return on 
assets (ROA), and return on equity (ROE). I also review how to calculate the 
profit margins — both the operating margin and the net margin.

154
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
To help you understand the validity of these profitability tests, I compare the 
results of the two leading toy companies, Mattel and Hasbro, and I compare 
their results with those of the toy industry in general. If you want to follow 
along, you need the financial statements of Mattel (www.mattel.com) and 
Hasbro (www.hasbro.com). You can download those at each of the com-
pany’s Web sites or you can order an annual report by calling the company’s 
investor relations office.
The Price/Earnings Ratio
The profit number you hear discussed most often in the financial news is the 
price/earnings ratio, or the P/E ratio. Basically, the P/E ratio looks at the price 
of the stock versus its earnings. For example, a P/E ratio of 10 means that for 
every $1 in company earnings per share, people are willing to pay $10 per 
share to buy the stock. If the P/E is 20, that means people are willing to pay 
$20 per share for each $1 of company earnings.
Why are people willing to pay more per dollar of earnings on some stock? 
Because the people who buy the more expensive stock believe the stock has 
greater potential for growth. This ratio is used when valuing stocks and is 
one of the oldest measurements in the world of stock exchanges.
 
On its own, the P/E ratio means very little, but as part of an overall evaluation 
of a company, the P/E ratio helps you interpret earnings results. Never make 
a decision about whether to buy or sell a stock based solely on the P/E ratio. 
Nonetheless, a negative P/E or a P/E of zero is a major trouble sign, indicating 
that a company isn’t profitable.
Figuring out earnings per share
Earnings per share represents the amount of income a company earns per 
share of stock on the stock market. The firm calculates the earnings per share 
(EPS) by dividing the total earnings by the number of shares outstanding. 
Companies often use a weighted average of the number of shares outstanding 
during the reporting period because the number of shares outstanding can 
change as the company sells new shares to outside investors or company 
employees. In addition, companies sometimes buy back shares from existing 
shareholders, reducing the number of shares available to the general public.
A weighted average is calculated by totaling the number of shares available 
during a certain period of time and dividing that number by the number of 
periods included. For example, if the weighted average is based on a monthly 

155
 Chapter 11: Testing the Profits and Market Value
average, the number of shares outstanding on the stock market at the end of 
each month is totaled and divided by 12 to find the weighted average. This 
can also be done with a weekly or daily figure. If weekly stock totals are used, 
the total of these periods would be divided by 52. If daily numbers are used, 
the total would be divided by 365.
Calculating the P/E ratio
To get the P/E ratio, divide the market value per share of stock by earnings 
per share of stock:
Market value per share of stock ÷ Earnings per share of stock = P/E ratio
 
You can find the market value per share of stock on many Web sites. Yahoo! 
Finance (finance.yahoo.com) is one of my favorites for easily finding his-
torical stock data.
The P/E formula comes in three flavors, which vary according to how earn-
ings per share is calculated: trailing, current, and forward earnings.
 
✓ Trailing P/E: You calculate a trailing P/E by using earnings per share 
from the last four quarters, or 12 months of earnings. This number 
gives you a view of a company’s earnings ratios based on accurate his-
torical data.
 
✓ Leading or projected P/Es: The other two types of P/E ratios are calcu-
lated using analysts’ expectations, so they’re sometimes called “leading” 
or “projected” P/Es.
 
• The current P/E ratio is calculated using earnings expected by ana-
lysts during the current year.
 
• A forward P/E ratio is based on analysts’ projections for the next 
year.
 
 Any P/E ratio that uses future projected results is only as good as the 
analyst making those projections. So be careful when you see the terms 
leading, projected, current, or forward P/E.
 
Any type of P/E ratio is just one of many profitability ratios you should con-
sider. This ratio gives you a good idea of what the public is willing to pay per 
share of stock based on the company’s historical earnings (trailing P/E) or 
what the analysts project you can consider paying per share of stock based on 
future earnings (current P/E or forward P/E). It gives you no guarantees about 
what the company will earn or what the stock price will be in the future.

156
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
Practicing the P/E ratio calculation
Now that you understand the basics behind the P/E ratio, I show you how to 
calculate it using real-world numbers from Hasbro and Mattel. As I mention 
earlier in this chapter, the company calculates earnings per share, which 
represents the total earnings divided by the number of shares outstanding. 
Remember that the number of shares outstanding can change as the com-
pany sells new shares to investors or buys them back from existing share-
holders.
When a company reports its earnings per share, it usually shows two num-
bers: basic and diluted. The firm calculates the basic EPS using a weighted 
average of all shares currently on the market. The diluted EPS takes into con-
sideration all future obligations to sell stock. For example, this number takes 
into account employees who have stock options to buy stock in the future, or 
bondholders who hold bonds that are convertible to stock.
 To practice using the formula to calculate P/E ratios, I use numbers from 
Mattel’s and Hasbro’s income statements. Table 11-1 shows Mattel’s basic and 
diluted EPS for 2007, 2006, and 2005. Table 11-2 shows the same information 
for Hasbro.

In the following examples, to calculate how the public valued the results 
for Mattel and Hasbro at the end of May 2008 using the 2007 annual report, 
I use the stock price at the time the market closed on May 30, 2008. I also 
use the diluted earnings per share, which more accurately represents the 

157
 Chapter 11: Testing the Profits and Market Value
company’s outstanding shareholder obligations. Mattel closed at $20.14, and 
Hasbro closed at $36.24. Even though Mattel’s diluted earnings per share 
were just 43 cents per share lower than Hasbro, Hasbro’s stock sold for 
$16.10 more per share.
Here’s Mattel’s P/E ratio:
$20.14 (Market value) ÷ $1.54 (2007 Diluted EPS) = 13.08 (P/E ratio)
Note that the P/E ratio is shown without a dollar sign. P/E is not a dollar 
value but instead shows the number of times the price outweighs the earn-
ings of the company.
So Mattel investors are willing to pay $13.08 for every $1 of earnings by 
Mattel in 2007. Following is Hasbro’s P/E ratio:
$36.24 (Market value) ÷ $ 1.97 (2007 Diluted EPS) = 18.4 (P/E ratio)
Hasbro investors are willing to pay $18.40 for every $1 of earnings by Hasbro 
in 2007.
As you can see, Mattel’s stock was beaten down by the recalls of toys from 
China in 2007 and has not fully recovered. Even though its earnings per share 
were just 57 cents less per share, the amount investors are willing to pay for 
its stock is $5.32 less per dollar of earnings.
Using the P/E ratio to judge company 
market value (stock price)
In comparing Mattel’s and Hasbro’s P/E ratios, you can conclude that on 
May 30, 2008, investors believed that Hasbro had better chances of improv-
ing its earnings performance than Mattel and, therefore, were willing to 
pay a higher price for each share of Hasbro’s stock. You must dig deeper 
into the numbers, the quarterly reports for the first half of 2008, and gen-
eral financial press coverage to determine why investors are more bullish 
on Hasbro than Mattel. But this one quick calculation lets you know which 
stock investors favor.
How do you know what a reasonable P/E ratio is for a company? Historically, 
the average P/E ratio for stock falls between 15 and 25. This ratio depends on 
economic conditions and the industry the company’s in. Some industries, such 
as technology, regularly maintain higher P/E ratios in the range of 30 to 40.

158
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
In addition to comparing two companies, you should compare the P/E cal-
culation to the industry in which the companies fall. Doing so allows you to 
gauge stock price or market value not only for the companies whose annual 
reports you’re analyzing but also for other companies in the same business.
 
One way you can find out the average industry P/E is to look up a company on 
Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com). On its home page, you see a link for 
industry information. Toy companies fall in the Toys & Games industry cat-
egory. The average P/E for the Toys and Games industry was 19.7 in June 2008, 
so both Hasbro and Mattel had P/Es below the industry average.
The P/E is a good quick ratio for picking potential investment candidates, but 
you shouldn’t use this ratio alone to make a buying or selling decision. After 
you pick your targets, read and analyze the annual reports and other infor-
mation about the company before making a decision to invest.
 
If you want to start your research on potential investment opportunities based 
on leaders or laggards in an industry, you can find a summary for all industry 
statistics at biz.yahoo.com/ic/index.html. You may wonder why some-
one would even consider laggards as investment opportunities. Well, that’s 
where you can sometimes find a company that many investors think is a dog 
but in reality is terribly undervalued and doing the right things to recover 
from its current slump. This style of investing is called value investing.
When investors are bullish, they tend to bid up the price of stock and end up 
paying higher prices for the stock than it may actually be worth. This price-
bidding war also drives up the P/E ratio.
 
Stock prices are set by the market based solely on the price at which some-
one is willing to sell a stock and the price at which someone is willing to buy 
a stock.
 During the Internet and technology stock bubble of the late 1990s and early 
2000s, P/E ratios hit highs in the hundreds and tumbled dramatically after 
the bubble burst. Even big names, such as Microsoft, had P/E ratios over 
100 that dropped back to realistic levels when the bubble burst. In July 2004, 
Microsoft’s P/E was 41.37, so you can see that even a top company can be seri-
ously overbid by investors. By June 2008, Microsoft’s P/E dropped dramati-
cally to 16.14. Microsoft is no longer flying as high. Its new operating system, 
Vista, didn’t do as well as expected, and the losses in the European courts 
hurt the company’s future earnings potential. Investors are no longer willing 
to overpay for its stock.
 
Be careful when you see P/Es creeping above their historical averages. Usually 
you’re encountering a sign that a correction is looming on the horizon, which 
will bring stock prices back down to realistic levels.

 Chapter 11: Testing the Profits and Market Value
Understanding variation among ratios
You’ll probably find varying P/E ratios for the same company because the 
number used for EPS can vary depending on which method for calculating 
EPS the company chooses. The diluted EPS is the one you should generally 
use. This figure is based on the current number of shares on the market, as 
well as those promised to employees for purchase in the future and those 
promised to creditors that may decide to convert a debt into a stockholding 
(if that’s part of the debt agreement). So diluted earnings gives you the most 
accurate picture of the actual earnings per share of stock now available on 
the market or committed for sale in the future.
But when companies put out a press release, they tend to use whatever EPS 
looks most favorable for them. Companies can choose among four basic ways 
to calculate EPS:
 
✓ Reported EPS: Companies calculate this EPS number by using general 
accounting principles and report it on the financial statements. They 
show it in two formats: basic and diluted. Most times, the diluted EPS 
number is the best one to use, but sometimes it can be distorted by 
one-time events, such as the sale of a division or a one-time charge for 
discontinued operations. So you need to read the notes to the financial 
statements to determine whether the EPS figure needs to be adjusted 
for unusual events. Chapter 9 discusses the notes to the financial state-
ments in great detail.
 
✓ Pro forma EPS: You almost always find this EPS in a company’s press 
release because it makes the company look the best. In most cases, this 
figure excludes some of the expenses or income the firm uses in the 
official financial reports. The company adjusts these official numbers to 
take out income that won’t recur, such as a one-time gain on the sale of 
marketable securities, or expenses that won’t recur, such as the closing 
of a large division.
 
 When a company mentions Pro forma EPS or statements in its press 
release, be sure that you compare these numbers with what the com-
pany develops using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) 
and reports in the financial statements filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC).
 
✓ Headline EPS: This EPS is the one you hear about on TV and read about 
in the newspapers. The earnings per share numbers used may be basic 
EPS, diluted EPS, Pro forma EPS, or some other EPS calculated based on 
analysts’ projections, so you have absolutely no idea what’s behind the 
numbers or the P/E ratio calculated using it. It’s likely the most unreli-
able EPS, and you shouldn’t use it for your evaluation.

160
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
 
✓ Cash EPS: Companies calculate this EPS by using operating cash flow 
(cash generated by business operations to produce and sell its prod-
ucts). Operating cash can’t be manipulated by accounting rules as easily 
as net income, so some analysts believe this EPS is the purest. When 
you see this number, be sure it’s based on operating cash and isn’t just 
a fancy way of saying EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, deprecia-
tion, and amortization). You can judge this by calculating the Cash EPS 
using the EBITDA reported on the financial statements and the net cash 
from operations reported on the statement of cash flows. Only the net 
cash figure gives you a true picture of cash flow.
 
The P/E ratio is an ever-changing number based on the day’s market price. 
It’s also a number that’s hard to depend on unless you know the calculations 
behind it. Companies can calculate the earnings per share in many different 
ways — using basic EPS, diluted EPS, Pro forma EPS, cash EPS, headline EPS, 
and projected or leading EPS. Reading the financial reports and checking the 
calculation for yourself is the only way that you can truly determine a com-
pany’s P/E and what’s included in its calculation.
The Dividend Payout Ratio
The dividend payout ratio looks at the amount of a firm’s earnings that it 
pays out to investors. Using this ratio, you can determine the actual cash 
return you’ll get by buying and holding a share of stock.
Some companies pay a portion of their earnings directly to their shareholders 
using dividends. Growth companies, which reinvest all their profits, rarely pay 
out dividends, but older, mature companies usually do. Older companies that 
no longer need to reinvest large sums in growing their businesses pay out the 
highest dividends.
To determine how well investors did with their stock holding, you can calcu-
late the dividend payout ratio.
Determining dividend payout
To find the dividend payout ratio, divide yearly dividend per share (the total 
amount per share paid out to investors during the year in dividends) by earn-
ings per share:
Yearly dividend per share ÷ Earnings per share = Dividend payout ratio

161
 Chapter 11: Testing the Profits and Market Value
 
You can use numbers from Mattel’s 2007 income statement to practice calcu-
lating the dividend payout ratio:
$0.75 (Dividends per share) ÷ $1.54 (Diluted EPS) = 48.7% (Dividend 
payout ratio)
Mattel paid out 48.7 percent of its diluted earnings per share to investors 
in 2007. If you subtract this percentage from 100 percent, you can find how 
much the company plowed back into its operations toward future growth. In 
Mattel’s case, 51.3 percent of its earnings were reinvested in the growth of 
the company. You can find the earnings reinvested in the company over the 
years in the retained earnings line in the shareholders’ equity section of the 
balance sheet. (See Chapter 6 for a more detailed discussion of shareholders’ 
equity.) Each year, any additional retained earnings are added to this line 
item. Mattel’s retained earnings were over $1.977 billion during its lifespan, 
according to the 2007 balance sheet (see Appendix A).
Following are numbers from Hasbro’s 2007 income statement. You can use 
them to calculate the dividend payout ratio.
$0.64 (Dividends per share) ÷ $1.97 (Diluted EPS) = 32.5% (Dividend 
payout ratio)
Hasbro paid out 32.5 percent of its diluted earnings per share to investors 
and plowed 67.5 percent (subtract 32.5 from 100) back into the company to 
use for future growth. Hasbro’s retained earnings on its 2007 balance sheet 
were more than $2.26 billion.
Digging into companies’ 
profits with dividends
Should the dividend payout ratio make a difference to you? In the past, inves-
tors expected dividend payouts. In fact, dividends made up as much as 40 
percent of most investors’ portfolio returns about 20 years ago. But inves-
tors’ priorities have changed in the past 20 years. Today, investors look 
toward capital gains, which are the profits investors make when selling a 
share of stock for more than they paid for that stock, for portfolio growth.
The big question is what better serves the investor and the company: imme-
diate cash payouts of dividends or long-term growth resulting from reinvest-
ing profits each year. The answer to this question isn’t an easy one. Younger 
companies rarely pay dividends because they need the money for growth, 
but as companies mature, the correct answer is more difficult to determine. 

162
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
For example, Microsoft held billions in cash and refused to pay dividends 
for years, claiming that it may need the cash for growth. Not until investors 
screamed long and loud did Microsoft finally pay its first dividend in 2003: 
only 8¢ per share, or a total of about $857 million!
 
You should definitely check how the dividend payout ratio compares with 
that of similar companies. If the dividend payout ratio is considerably smaller 
than that of other similar companies, be sure you understand what the com-
pany does with the money and whether it’s making good use of the funds it’s 
reinvesting. If the company pays out a significantly larger portion of earnings 
to investors than most other companies in the industry, it may not have any 
good ideas for growth and is therefore just milking the cash cow, which may 
eventually run dry.
 
High dividend payout ratios could be a sign that a decrease in profits may 
soon be on the way. If a company continually increases its dividend payout 
ratio even as profits fall, you’ve encountered a warning sign that future trou-
ble is brewing.
Who has the highest dividend payout ratios?
Investors who purchase stock primarily for cur-
rent income look to industries that traditionally 
have high dividend payout ratios. Utility compa-
nies traditionally have some of the highest divi-
dend payout ratios, but you find good dividend 
payers in many mature, older industries. If you 
want to look for a good stock to buy based on 
dividend payout, here are two key factors to 
consider:
 ✓ Cash stash: When you read the annual 
report, pay close attention to how much 
cash the company reports on its books. 
Remember that the dividend comes from 
extra cash flow. Most companies need to 
hold onto some of their cash so they have 
money for acquisitions, research and devel-
opment, and other capital needs to keep 
them competitive, even if they’re not in a 
high-growth industry. Use your calculation 
of the dividend payout ratio to determine 
how much cash the company is using to 
cover its dividends and how much cash it’s 
saving for future needs. If the firm is paying 
out most of its cash and saving very little, 
that may be a sign that the cash could run 
out at some point because the business 
is no longer reinvesting anything in main-
taining its market or updating its products. 
Eventually, the company will lose out to 
competition and earn less, bringing in less 
cash.
 ✓ Dividend consistency: As you read the 
annual report, also look for information 
about dividends paid out over the past few 
years. You can find that information for the 
past three years at the bottom of the income 
statement. You can get information for more 
than three years by looking up the company 
at Yahoo! Finance and other financial Web 
sites. You want to find companies that pay 
dividends at a consistent level or, even 
better, that are able to increase their divi-
dend payouts regularly.

163
 Chapter 11: Testing the Profits and Market Value
 
If the dividend payout ratio looks extremely high or extremely low, look at the 
financial statements before you get too concerned. Did some extraordinary 
event dramatically impact net income, such as a significant loss from a plant 
closing or the sale or purchase of a subsidiary? A one-time event that impacts 
net income can explain an unusually high or low dividend payout ratio and 
needn’t raise a red flag for investors.
Return on Sales
You can test how efficiently a company runs its operations (that is, the 
making and selling of its products) by calculating its return on sales (ROS). 
This ratio measures how much profit the company is producing per dollar of 
sales. By analyzing the numbers in the income statement using ROS, you can 
get a picture of the company’s profit per dollar of sales and gauge how much 
extra cash the company is bringing in per sale.
Remember that the firm needs that cash to cover its expenses, develop new 
products, and keep itself competitive. Investors also hope that at some point 
in the future they may even be paid some dividends. At the very least, inves-
tors want to be sure the company is generating enough cash from sales to 
keep itself competitive in the market through advertising, new product devel-
opment, and new market development.
Figuring out ROS
 
To calculate ROS, divide the net income before taxes by sales. You can find 
both numbers on the income statement. Net sales (sometimes called net rev-
enue) is the top number on the income statement. Net income before taxes is 
in the expense section of the income statement, just before tax expenses are 
reported.
Net income before taxes ÷ Sales = Return on sales
 You can calculate Mattel’s ROS based on information in its income statement 
for 2007:
$703,398,000 (Net income before taxes) ÷ $5,970,090,000 (Sales) = 
11.8% (ROS)
Mattel made 11.8 percent on each dollar of sales. Compare that number with 
Hasbro’s ROS using numbers on its income statement for 2007:
$462,382,000 (Net income before taxes) ÷ $3,837,557,000 (Sales) = 
12% (ROS)

164
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
Hasbro made 12 percent on each dollar of sales.
Investors can use the ROS ratio to determine how much profit is being made 
on a dollar of sales. In comparing Mattel and Hasbro, you can see that Mattel 
and Hasbro had similar ROS ratios.
Reaching the truth about profits with ROS
In reading analysts’ reports on Mattel and Hasbro, I found that Hasbro’s 
historical ROS has been about 7 percent, so the results for Hasbro in the 
preceding section show improvement. Mattel is stagnating with its efforts to 
improve operating income. Its ROS in 2001 was 12.5 percent, and it dropped 
to 11.8 percent in 2007. Mattel wants to get back to its previous historical 
average of about 15 to 16 percent. The ROS for Mattel was impacted by the 
$42 million it had to pay for costs related to the recalls of toys made in China 
in 2007. Lost sales because of these recalls also probably impacted Mattel’s 
numbers. You can find out more details about the full impact of the China 
recalls in the notes to the financial statements (see chapter 9) and in the 
management’s discussion and analysis (see Chapter 5).
 
ROS is just one part of the puzzle. You need to fully analyze the information 
you see in the annual reports to find all the pieces and make a determination 
about whether to invest in a company. This chapter focuses on profitability. 
You also need to analyze a company’s liquidity, which I discuss in Chapter 12, 
and its cash flow, which I discuss in Chapter 13.
Return on Assets
You can judge how well a company uses its assets by calculating the return 
on assets (ROA). If the ROA is a high percentage, the company is likely manag-
ing its assets well. As an investor, that’s important because your shares of 
stock represent a claim on those assets. You want to be sure that your claim 
is being used wisely. If you haven’t invested yet, be sure your investment will 
go toward stock in a company that invests its assets well. As with all ratios, 
you need to compare results with those of similar companies in an industry 
in order for the numbers to mean anything.
 
To calculate ROA, divide net income by total assets. You can find net income 
at the bottom of the income statement, and you can find total assets at the 
bottom of the assets section of the balance sheet.
Net income ÷ Total assets = Return on assets

165
 Chapter 11: Testing the Profits and Market Value
Doing some dividing to get ROA
 Using the numbers from Mattel’s income statement and balance sheet, you 
can determine its ROA:
$599,993,000 (Net income) ÷ $4,805,455,000 (Total assets) = 12.5% (ROA)
So Mattel made 12.5 percent on each dollar of assets. Compare this number 
with Hasbro’s ROA:
$333,003,000 (Net income) ÷ $ 3,237,063,000 (Total assets) = 10.3% (ROA)
Hasbro made 10.3 percent on each dollar of assets. Mattel earned about 2 
percent more than Hasbro on each dollar of assets.
Ranking companies with the help of ROA
The ROA ratio shows you how much a company earns from its assets or 
capital invested. This ratio gives investors and debtors a clear view of how 
well a company’s management uses its assets to generate a profit. Both 
shareholders’ equity (claims on assets by shareholders) and debt funding 
(claims on assets by creditors) factor into this calculation, meaning that the 
ratio looks at the income generated using money raised by borrowing funds 
from creditors and selling stock to shareholders.
ROA can vary significantly depending on the type of industry. Companies that 
must use their capital to maintain manufacturing operations with factories 
and expensive machinery have a much lower ROA than companies that don’t 
require heavy manufacturing, like service companies. Businesses with low 
asset requirements average an ROA of 20 percent or higher, whereas compa-
nies that require a large investment in assets can have ROAs below 5 percent.
Return on Equity
Return on equity (ROE) measures how well a company does earning money 
for its investors. In fact, you’ll probably find it easier to determine an ROE for 
a company than an ROA. Although the ROE is an excellent measure of how 
profitable the company is in comparison with other companies in the indus-
try, you should look at the ROA as well, because that ratio looks at returns 
for both investors and creditors.

166
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
Calculating ROE
 
You calculate ROE by dividing net income earned by the company (which you 
find at the bottom of the income statement) by the total shareholders’ equity 
(which you find at the bottom of the equity section of the balance sheet):
Net income ÷ Shareholders’ equity = Return on equity
 You can figure out Mattel’s ROE based on its 2007 income statements and bal-
ance sheets:
$599,993,000 (Net income) ÷ $2,306,742,000 (Shareholders’ equity) = 26% 
(ROE)
Mattel made 26 percent on each dollar of shareholders’ equity. Following is 
Hasbro’s ROE, also based on 2007 income statements and balance sheets:
$333,003,000 (Net income) ÷ $1,385,092,000 (Shareholders’ equity) = 24% 
(ROE)
Hasbro made 24 percent on each dollar of assets. Comparing Mattel and 
Hasbro, you can see that Mattel generated slightly more than Hasbro on its 
shareholders’ equity.
Reacting to companies with 
ROEs assistance
 
Investors most often cite the ROE ratio when they want to see how well a com-
pany is doing for them. This can be a huge mistake because ROE ignores the 
impact of debt on profitability, so it doesn’t give investors the full picture of a 
company’s financial position. ROE doesn’t consider the impact of a company’s 
debt position on its future earnings potential.
 Comparing ROE to ROA for Mattel and Hasbro, you can see that both compa-
nies’ ROEs look better than their ROAs:
ROA
ROE
Mattel
12.5%
26%
Hasbro
10.3%
24%

167
 Chapter 11: Testing the Profits and Market Value
 
The primary reason that ROE often looks better than ROA is that debt isn’t 
included in ROE. When you see comparisons of company statistics, you fre-
quently find an ROE but no mention of an ROA because many companies 
believe ROA is primarily a statistic to be used by management and the com-
pany’s debtors. Take the extra time to determine the company’s ROA, and 
compare it with that of other firms in the industry. You’ll have a much better 
idea of how well the company generates its profit when you take both debt 
and equity into consideration.
The Big Three: Margins
You need to investigate three types of margins when you evaluate a company 
based on its financial reports. Margins show you how much financial safety 
the company has after its costs and expenses. Each of the three margins I dis-
cuss — gross margin, operating margin, and net profit margin — shows what 
the company has left to work with at various stages of the profit calculation.
Dissecting gross margin
Gross margin looks at the profit margin based solely on sales and the cost 
of producing those sales. It gives you a picture of how much revenue is left 
after all the direct costs of producing and selling the product have been 
subtracted. These costs can include discounts offered, returns, allowances, 
production costs, and purchases. I talk about these costs in greater detail in 
Chapter 7.
To calculate gross margin, divide gross profit by net sales or revenues:
Gross profit ÷ Net sales or revenues = Gross margin
 
You can find gross profit at the bottom of the sales or revenue section of the 
income statement. Net sales are at the top of the same section.
 Using numbers from Mattel’s income statement, you can calculate its gross 
margin:
$2,777,300,000 (Gross profit) ÷ $5,970,090 (Net sales) = 46.52% (Gross 
margin)

168
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
Mattel made a gross profit of 46.5 percent on each dollar of sales. Compare 
this number with Hasbro’s gross margin (using numbers from its income 
statement):
$2,260,936,000 (Gross profit) ÷ $3,837,557,000 (Net sales) = 58.92% (Gross 
margin)
Hasbro has about 12 percent more revenue left after it subtracts its direct 
costs than Mattel has, which shows that Hasbro has better cost controls on 
the purchase or production of the toys it’s selling.
Investigating operating margin
The operating margin takes the financial report reader one step further in 
the process of finding what’s left over for future use and looks at how well a 
company controls costs, factoring in any expenses not directly related to the 
production and sales of a particular product. These costs include advertis-
ing, selling (sales staff, sales offices, sales materials, and other items directly 
related to the selling process), distribution, administration, research and 
development, royalties, and other expenses.
Selling and advertising expenses aren’t factored into the cost of goods sold, 
which were subtracted out before calculating gross margin, because these 
expenses usually involve the sale of a number of products or even product 
lines. These expenses can rarely be matched to a specific sale of a specific 
product in the same way that the cost of actually manufacturing or purchas-
ing that product can be matched.
Divide operating profit by net sales or revenues to calculate the operating 
margin:
Operating profit ÷ Net sales or revenues = Operating margin
 
You can find net sales or revenues at the top of the income statement and the 
operating profit at the bottom of the expenses-from-operations section on the 
income statement.
 Using numbers from Mattel’s income statement, you can calculate the operat-
ing margin:
$730,078,000 (Operating profit) ÷ $5,970,090,000 (Net sales) = 12.23% 
(Operating margin)
Mattel made an operating margin of 12.23 percent on each dollar of sales. 
Compare this number with Hasbro’s operating margin (using numbers from 
its income statement):

169
 Chapter 11: Testing the Profits and Market Value
$519,350,000 (Operating profit) ÷ $3,837,557,000 (Net sales) = 13.53% 
(Operating margin)
Hasbro made an operating profit of 13.53 percent on each dollar of sales.
You can see the tables have turned. Now that all indirect expenses are fac-
tored into the equation, you can see that Hasbro doesn’t have as big an 
advantage over Mattel on costs. Hasbro’s operating profit is just 1.3 percent 
higher than Mattel’s.
One key expense factor that hurts Hasbro is that its royalty expenses (more 
than $316.8 million) are much higher than Mattel’s. Hasbro buys the rights to 
toys instead of developing them in-house, so it must pay royalties on its toys.
Mattel traditionally develops more of its toys in-house and has much lower 
royalty payments. In fact, when you look at Mattel’s income statement, you 
don’t even see royalties separated out from other selling and administrative 
expenses.
 
Companies with an operating margin that’s higher than the industry aver-
age are usually better at holding down their cost of goods sold and operating 
expenses. Maintaining a higher operating margin means the company has 
more price flexibility during hard times. If a company with a higher operating 
margin must lower prices to stay competitive, more room is available to con-
tinue earning profits even when products must be sold for less.
Catching the leftover money: 
Net profit margin
The net profit margin looks at a company’s bottom line. This calculation 
shows you how much money the company has left after it has deducted all 
expenses — whether from operations related to the production and selling 
of the company’s products or from nonoperating expenses or revenue not 
related to the company’s sales of products or services.
For example, a nonoperating revenue would be interest earned on a com-
pany’s bond holdings. That money isn’t generated by operations but is still 
considered earnings for the company. After the operating-income line on the 
income statement, you most likely see a line for interest expense. This line 
represents the interest the company paid out on corporate debt. You also 
see income taxes expense, which indicates the amount the company paid in 
taxes. These are two of the biggest charges left to subtract from operating 
income. The only exception to this rule is if a large extraordinary charge from 
a special event, such as discontinued operations or the purchase or sale of 
a division, appears on the income statement. Any extraordinary charges will 
also appear on the income statement after the operating income line.

170
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
To find net profit margin, divide net profit by net sales or revenues:
Net profit ÷ Net sales or revenues = Net profit margin
 
You find the net profit at the bottom line of the income statement; it may also 
be called “net income” or “net loss.” Net sales or revenue is on the top line of 
the income statement.
 You can calculate the net profit margin using numbers from Mattel’s income 
statement:
$599,993,000 (Net profit) ÷ $5,970,090,000 (Net sales) = 10.05% (Net profit 
margin)
Mattel made a net profit of 10.05 percent on each dollar of sales. Now calcu-
late Hasbro’s net profit margin using numbers from its income statement:
$333,003,000 (Net profit) ÷ $3,837,557,000 (Net sales) = 8.68% (Net profit 
margin)
Hasbro made a net profit of 8.68 percent on each dollar of sales. Comparing 
Mattel’s and Hasbro’s net profit margins, Mattel appears to be more success-
ful than Hasbro at generating a net profit per dollar of sales. The key question 
investors must then ask is whether Mattel will perform as well in the future.
Looking to the future
When you decide to invest in a company, you 
want to consider one that has a good history of 
managing its assets well and making a profit. 
Even more important, you need to know what 
the company’s growth prospects are.
As a new investor, you’re most interested in 
future growth because that’s how you make 
your money. If the company stagnates and the 
stock price doesn’t go up, your investment sees 
little profit. If the company grows at a rate of 
10 to 15 percent per year or more, you’ll likely 
see an ever-increasing value of your stock pur-
chase. If you’re looking at a mature company 
that has a solid market base but isn’t expected 
to grow, you should be more concerned about 
what that company pays out to its investors in 
dividends than about its growth prospects.

Chapter 12
Looking at Liquidity
In This Chapter
▶ Calculating various debt and income ratios
▶ Looking at debt in relation to equity and capital
M
aking money is great, but if a business ties up too much of its money 
in nonliquid assets (such as factories it can’t easily sell) or carries too 
much debt, it won’t be around long to make more money. A company abso-
lutely must have the cash it needs to carry out day-to-day operations and pay 
its debt obligations if its owners want to stay in business.
Lenders who have money wrapped up in a company follow debt levels 
closely. They definitely want to be sure they’re going to get their money back, 
plus interest. As an investor, you need to take a close look at a company’s 
debt, too, because your investment can get wiped out if the company goes 
bankrupt. So if you’re investing in a company, you want to be certain that the 
company is liquid and isn’t on the road to debt troubles.
So how do you make sure that the firm you invest in isn’t about to spiral 
down the toilet, taking all your money with it? Well, you need to check out 
the company’s ability to pay its bills and pay back its creditors. But looking 
at one company doesn’t give you much information. Instead, compare the 
company with similar companies, as well as with the industry average. Doing 
so gives you a better idea of where the company stands.
In this chapter, I show you how to calculate a company’s ability to pay the 
bills by looking at debt ratios, comparing its debt to its equity, and compar-
ing its debt to its total capital. (If you’re starting to sweat and/or your brain 
is shutting down because of the impending mathlete workout, don’t worry — 
things aren’t as difficult as they sound!)

Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
Finding the Current Ratio
One of the most commonly used debt measurement tools is the current ratio, 
which measures the assets a company plans to use over the next 12 months 
with the debts it must pay during that same period. This ratio lets you know 
whether the company will be able to pay any bills due over the next 12 
months with assets it has on hand. You find the current ratio by using two 
key numbers:
 
✓ Current assets: These are cash or other assets (such as accounts receiv-
able, inventory, and marketable securities) the company will likely con-
vert to cash during the next 12-month period.
 
✓ Current liabilities: These are debts that the company must pay in the 
next 12-month period, including accounts payable, short-term notes, 
accrued taxes, and other payments.
I talk more about current assets and current liabilities in Chapter 6.
Calculating the current ratio
The formula for calculating the current ratio is:
Current assets ÷ Current liabilities = Current ratio
 Using information from the balance sheets for Mattel and Hasbro, here are 
their current ratios for the year ending December 2007:
Mattel
$2,592,936,000 (Current assets) ÷ $1,570,429,000 (Current liabilities) = 1.65 
(Current ratio)
So Mattel has $1.65 of current assets for every $1 of current liabilities.
Hasbro
$1,888,240,000 (Current assets) ÷ $887,671,000 (Current liabilities) = 2.13 
(Current ratio)
So Hasbro has $2.13 of current assets for every $1 of current liabilities.

 Chapter 12: Looking at Liquidity
What do the numbers mean?
 
The key question to ask is whether a company’s current ratio shows that it’s 
able to cover short-term obligations. Generally, the rule of thumb is that any 
current ratio between 1.2 and 2.0 is sufficient for a business to operate. Keep 
in mind that the ratio varies among industries.
 
A current ratio below 1 is a strong danger sign that the company is headed for 
trouble. A ratio below 1 means the company is operating with negative work-
ing capital; in other words, its current debt obligations exceed the amount of 
money it has available to pay those debts.
A company also can have a current ratio that’s too high. Any ratio over 2 
means the firm isn’t investing its assets well. The company can probably put 
some of those short-term assets to better use by investing them in growth 
opportunities.
However, many lenders and analysts believe that the current ratio isn’t a 
good enough test of a company’s debt-paying ability because it includes 
some assets that aren’t easy to turn into cash, such as inventory. A company 
must sell the inventory and collect the money before it has cash to work 
with, and doing so can take a lot more time than using cash that’s already on 
hand, or just collecting money due for accounts receivable, which represent 
customer accounts for items already purchased.
Determining the Quick Ratio
Stricter than the current ratio is a test called the quick ratio or acid test ratio, 
which measures a company’s ability to pay its bills without taking inven-
tory into consideration. The calculation includes only cash on hand or cash 
already due from accounts receivable. Unlike the current ratio, the quick 
ratio doesn’t include money anticipated from the sale of inventory and the 
collection of money from those sales. To calculate this ratio, you use a two-
step process: First, find the assets that a company can quickly turn into cash; 
then divide those quick assets by the current liabilities.
Calculating the quick ratio
Here’s the two-step process you use to find the quick ratio:

174
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
 
1. Determine the quick assets.
 
 Quick assets = Cash + Accounts receivable + Short-term investments
 
2. Calculate the quick ratio.
 
 Quick assets ÷ Current liabilities = Quick ratio or acid test ratio
 Using information from Mattel’s and Hasbro’s balance sheets, I take you 
through the two-step process. Note: I added only two figures to find the quick 
assets for Mattel and Hasbro because both companies combine cash and 
short-term investments or marketable securities on their balance sheets.
Mattel
Quick assets = $901,148,000 + $991,196,000 = $1,892,344,000
$1,892,344,000 (Quick assets) ÷ $1,570,429,000 (Current liabilities) = 1.2 
(Quick ratio)
So Mattel has $1.20 of quick assets for every $1 of current liabilities.
Hasbro
Quick assets = $774,458,000 + $654,789,000 = $1,429,247,000
$1,429,247,000 (Quick assets) ÷ $887,671,000 (Current liabilities) = 1.61 
(Quick ratio)
So Hasbro has $1.61 of quick assets for every $1 of current liabilities.
Hasbro is in a better position than Mattel based on the quick ratio, but both 
companies have a quick ratio over 1, so they should have no problem paying 
their bills.
What do the numbers mean?
 
A company is usually considered to be in a good position as long as its quick 
ratio is over 1. A quick ratio below 1 is a sign that the company will likely have 
to sell some short-term investments to pay bills or take on additional debt 
until it sells more of its inventory.
If you’re looking at statements from companies in the retail sector, you’re 
more likely to see a quick ratio under 1. Retail stores often have a lot more 
money tied up in inventory than other types of businesses. As long as the 
company you’re evaluating is operating at or near the quick ratio of similar 
companies in the industry, you’re probably not looking at a problem situa-
tion, even if the quick ratio is under 1.

175
 Chapter 12: Looking at Liquidity
 
Remember that a quick ratio of less than 1 can be a sign of trouble ahead if the 
company isn’t able to sell its inventory quickly. Other issues that can cause 
problems include slow-paying customers and accounts receivable that aren’t 
collected when billed. In Chapters 15 and 16, I take a closer look at how you 
can assess inventory and accounts-receivable turnover.
Investigating the Interest Coverage Ratio
Although the current and quick ratios look at a company’s ability to pay back 
creditors by comparing items on the balance sheet, the interest coverage ratio 
looks at income to determine whether the company is generating enough 
profits to pay its interest obligations. If the company doesn’t make its inter-
est payments on time to creditors, its ability to get additional credit will be 
hurt, and eventually, if nonpayment goes on for a long time, the company 
could end up in bankruptcy.
The interest coverage ratio uses two figures that you can find on the com-
pany’s income statement: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and 
amortization (also known as EBITDA; check out Chapter 7 for more informa-
tion); and interest expense (also in Chapter 7).
Calculating the interest coverage ratio
Here’s the formula for finding the interest coverage ratio:
EBITDA ÷ Interest expense = Interest coverage ratio
Calculating this ratio may or may not be a two-step process. Many companies 
include an EBITDA line item on their income statements. If a company hasn’t 
included this line item, you have to calculate EBITDA yourself.
 Mattel and Hasbro don’t have an EBITDA line item, so I show you how to figure 
that out before you try to calculate the ratio.
Mattel
Mattel reports operating income before it lists its interest and tax expenses. 
Mattel doesn’t have a line item for amortization or depreciation, so you 
need to look at the cash flow statement to find that amortization totaled 
$11,290,000 and depreciation totaled $160,790,000. Therefore, in Mattel’s 
case, EBITDA was $730,078,000 + $160,790,000 + $11,290,000 = $902,158,000. 
Then, to get the interest coverage ratio:

176
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
$902,158,000 (EBITDA) ÷ $70,974,000 (Interest expense) = 12.71 (Interest 
coverage ratio)
Thus, Mattel generates $12.71 income for every $1 it pays out in interest.
Hasbro
Hasbro reports amortization expenses of $67,716,000 on the income state-
ment (I talk more about amortization in Chapters 4 and 6). It also reports 
$88,804,000 for depreciation and amortization of plant and equipment on the 
statement of cash flows, so you need to add those expenses back in to find 
the EBITDA:
$519,350,000 (Operating income) + $67,716,000 (Amortization on income 
statement) + $88,804,000 (Depreciation and amortization of plant and 
equipment) = $675,870,000 (EBITDA)
And then:
$675,870,000 (EBITDA) ÷ $34,618,000 (Interest expense) = 19.52 (Interest 
coverage ratio)
Hasbro generates $19.52 for every $1 it pays out in interest.
What do the numbers mean?
Both companies clearly generate more than enough income to make their 
interest payments. A ratio of less than 1 means a company is generating less 
cash from operations than needed to pay all its interest.
 
Lenders believe that the higher the interest coverage ratio is the better. You 
should be concerned about a company’s fiscal health anytime you see an 
interest coverage ratio of less than 1.5. This means the company generates 
only about $1.50 for each $1 it pays out in interest. That’s operating on a tight 
budget. Any type of emergency or drop in sales could make it difficult for the 
company to make its interest payments.
Comparing Debt to Shareholders’ Equity
How a company finances its operations involves many crucial decisions. 
When a firm uses debt to pay for new activities, it has to pay interest on that 
debt, plus pay back the principal amount at some point in the future. If a 
company uses shareholders’ equity (stock sold to investors) to finance new 
activities, it doesn’t need to make interest payments or pay back investors.

177
 Chapter 12: Looking at Liquidity
Finding the right mix of debt and equity financing can have a major impact 
on a company’s cost of capital. Too much debt can be both risky and costly. 
However, if a company has too high a level of equity, investors may believe 
that it isn’t properly leveraging its money. Leverage is the degree to which 
a business uses borrowed money. For example, a company typically buys a 
new building by using a combination of a mortgage (debt) and cash (from a 
new stock issue or retained earnings, which is the equity side of the equa-
tion). When a company uses leverage, its cash can go a lot further.
Suppose that you have $50,000 to pay for a home. This amount isn’t enough 
to buy the home you want, so you use that money as a deposit on the home 
and get a mortgage for the rest of the money due. If the house price is 
$250,000 and you put down $50,000, you can use the mortgage to leverage 
that cash so you can afford the home. In this scenario, the mortgage covers 
80 percent of the purchase price. Any cash you earn beyond your monthly 
mortgage payment can be used to pay your other bills and buy food and 
other things you need or want.
 
As an investor, you want to know how a company allocates its debt versus its 
equity. To determine this, use the debt to shareholders’ equity (see the follow-
ing section). You also want to check the company’s debt-to-capital ratio (see 
the upcoming section “Determining Debt-to-Capital Ratio”), which lenders use 
to determine how much they’ll lend and to monitor a company’s debt level.
Calculating debt to shareholders’ equity
To calculate debt to shareholders’ equity, divide the total liabilities by the 
shareholders’ equity. This ratio shows you what portion of a company’s capi-
tal assets is paid by debt and what portion is financed by equity.
Here’s the formula you use to calculate debt to shareholders’ equity:
Total liabilities ÷ Shareholders’ equity = Debt to shareholders’ equity
 I use the numbers from Mattel’s and Hasbro’s 2007 balance sheets to show 
you how to calculate the debt to shareholders’ equity ratio.
Mattel
$2,498,713,000 (Total liabilities) ÷ $2,306,742,000 (Shareholders’ equity) = 
1.08 (Debt to shareholders’ equity)
Mattel used $1.08 from creditors for every $1 it had from investors. 
Therefore, Mattel depends a bit more on money raised by borrowing than on 
money raised by selling stock to investors.

178
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
Hasbro
$1,851,971,000 (Total liabilities) ÷ $1,385,092,000 (Shareholders’ equity) = 
1.34 (Debt to shareholders’ equity)
Hasbro used $1.34 from creditors for every $1 it had from investors. 
Therefore, Hasbro used a greater proportion of borrowed money from credi-
tors to operate its company than Mattel did.
What do the numbers mean?
A debt to shareholders’ equity ratio that’s greater than 1 means that the com-
pany finances a majority of its activities with debt. A ratio under 1 means that 
the company depends more on using equity than debt to finance its activities.
In most industries, a 1:1 ratio is best, but it varies by industry. You can best 
judge how a company is doing by comparing it with similar companies and 
the industry averages.
 
As the ratio creeps higher and higher above 1, a firm’s finances get more risky, 
especially if interest rates are expected to rise. Alarm bells should sound 
when you see a company near or above 2. Lenders consider a business that 
carries a debt load this large a credit risk — which means the company will 
have to pay much higher interest rates to finance its capital activities.
Determining Debt-to-Capital Ratio
Lenders take another look at debt using the debt-to-capital ratio, which mea-
sures a company’s leverage by looking at what portion of its capital comes 
from debt financing.
Calculating the debt-to-capital ratio
You use a three-step process to calculate the debt-to-capital ratio:
 
1. Find the total debt.
 
 Total debt = Short-term borrowing + Long-term debt + Current portion of 
long-term debt + Notes payable
 
2. Find the capital.
 
 Capital = Total debt + Equity
 
3. Calculate the debt-to-capital ratio.

179
 Chapter 12: Looking at Liquidity
 
 Total debt ÷ Capital = Debt-to-capital ratio
 To show you how to calculate the debt-to-capital ratio, I use the information 
from Mattel’s and Hasbro’s 2007 balance sheets.
Mattel
First, to find out Mattel’s total debt, add up Mattel’s short-term and long-term 
debt obligations:
Short-term borrowings  
$349,003,000 
Current portion of long-term debt 
$50,000 
Long-term debt 
$550,000,000
Total debt 
$949,003,000
Next, add the total debt to total equity to figure the number for capital:
$2,306,742,000 (Equity) + $949,003,000 (Debt) = $3,255,745,000 (Capital)
Finally, calculate the debt-to-capital ratio:
$949,003,000 (Total debt) ÷ $3,255,745,000 (Capital) = 0.29 (Debt-to-capital 
ratio)
So Mattel’s debt-to-capital ratio was 0.29 to 1 in 2007.
Hasbro
First, to find out Hasbro’s total debt, add up Hasbro’s short-term and long-
term debt obligations:
Short-term borrowings  
$10,201,000 
Current portion of long-term debt 
$135,348,000 
Long-term debt 
$709,723,000
Total debt 
$855,272,000
Then add the total debt to total equity to find out the number for capital:
$1,385,092,000 (Equity) + $855,272,000 (Debt) = $2,240,364,000 (Capital)
Finally, calculate the debt-to-capital ratio:
$855,272,000 (Total debt) ÷ $2,240,364,000 (Capital) = 0.38 (Debt-to-
capital ratio)
So Hasbro’s debt-to-capital ratio was higher than Mattel’s at 0.38 to 1.

180
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
What do the numbers mean?
Lenders often place debt-to-capital ratio requirements in the terms of a credit 
agreement for a company to maintain its credit status. If a company’s debt 
creeps above what its lenders allow for the debt-to-capital ratio, the lender 
can call the loan, which means the business has to raise cash to pay off the 
loan. Companies usually take care of a call by finding another lender. The 
new lender will likely charge higher interest rates because the company’s 
higher debt-to-capital ratio makes the company appear as though it’s a 
greater credit risk.
 
Generally, companies are considered to be in good financial shape with a debt-
to-capital ratio of 0.35 to 1 or less. If a company’s debt-to-capital ratio creeps 
above 0.50 to 1, lenders usually consider the company a much higher credit 
risk, which means it has to pay higher interest rates to get loans.
Take note of the ratio and how it compares with the ratios of similar compa-
nies in its industry. If the company has a higher debt-to-capital ratio than most 
of its competitors, lenders will probably see it as a much higher credit risk.
 
A company with a higher than normal debt-to-capital ratio faces an increasing 
cost of operating as it tries to meet the obligations of paying higher interest 
rates. These higher interest payments can spiral into more significant prob-
lems as the cash crunch intensifies. In a worst-case scenario, the company 
can seek bankruptcy protection from its creditors to continue operating and 
to restructure its debt. Many times its stock value plummets and may have no 
value left at all if the company emerges from bankruptcy.

Chapter 13
Making Sure the Company 
Has Cash to Carry On
In This Chapter
▶ Determining a company’s solvency
▶ Gauging financial strength by looking at debt
▶ Checking cash sufficiency
N
o business can operate without cash. Unfortunately, the balance sheet 
(see Chapter 6) and income statement (see Chapter 7) don’t tell you 
how well a company manages its cash flow, which is critical for measuring a 
company’s ability to stay in business. To find this important information, you 
need to turn to the statement of cash flows, also known as the cash flow state-
ment, which looks at how cash flows into and out of a business through its 
operations, investments, and financing activities.
In this chapter, I show you some basic calculations that help you determine 
the cash flow from sales and help you find out whether the cash flow is suf-
ficient to meet the company’s cash needs. Throughout the chapter, I use 
Mattel and Hasbro (two leading toy companies) as examples to show you 
how to use these tools to evaluate a company’s financial health. You can find 
Hasbro’s financial statements, as well as its complete annual report, at www.
hasbro.com and Mattel’s at www.mattel.com.
Measuring Income Success
Looking at whether a company is generating enough cash income can help 
you determine the company’s solvency — its capability to meet its financial 
obligations (in other words, its ability to pay all its outstanding bills). If a firm 
can’t pay its bills, its creditors won’t be happy, and it could be forced to file 
bankruptcy or discontinue operations. In this section, I show you two ratios 
that can help you determine a company’s solvency based on its sales success.

182
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
Calculating free cash flow
The first step in determining a company’s solvency is to find out how much 
money the company earns from its operations that can actually be put into a 
savings account for future use — in other words, a company’s discretionary 
cash. This is also called the free cash flow.
A business with significant cash flow has a lot of flexibility to decide whether 
it wants to use its discretionary cash to purchase additional investments, pay 
down more debt, or add to its liquidity, which means to deposit additional 
funds in cash and cash equivalent accounts (including checking accounts, sav-
ings accounts, and other holdings that can easily be converted to cash). The 
formula for calculating the free cash flow is a simple one:
Cash provided by operating activities – Capital expenditures – Cash divi-
dends = Free cash flow
 
Cash flows from operating activities can be found at the bottom of the operat-
ing activities section of the statement of cash flows. Capital expenditures can 
be found in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement. Cash 
dividends paid can be found in the financing activities section of the statement 
of cash flows.
Mattel
 Using Mattel’s 2007 and 2006 cash flow statements, I show you how to calcu-
late the free cash flow:
2007
2006
Cash provided by operating 
activities
$560,532,000
$875,946,000
Minus capital expenditures
 
Purchases of tools, dies, 
 
and molds
(68,275,000)
(69,335,000)
 
Purchases of other property, 
 
plant, and equipment
(78,358,000)
(64,106,000)
Minus cash dividends
(272,343,000)
(249,542,000)
Free cash flow
$141,556,000
$492,963,000
As you can see, Mattel’s free cash flow dropped significantly from 2006 to 
2007, by a total of about $351 million. The $23 million increase in dividends 
explains part of that drop, but more noteworthy is that Mattel’s cash pro-
vided by operating activities dropped by about $315 million. Taking a closer 
look at the cash flow from operating activities section, you can see a signifi-
cant reduction in cash flow related to Mattel’s inventory line item (I show 

183
 Chapter 13: Making Sure the Company Has Cash to Carry On
you how to investigate this number in Chapter 15). You also see a decrease in 
cash because $311.9 million was paid out in accounts payable, accrued liabili-
ties, and income taxes payable. I show you how to analyze accounts payable 
in Chapter 16.
Clearly, Mattel is having trouble maintaining its previous cash levels. That 
could mean that the company decided to maintain lower cash levels and 
invest in new opportunities, or it could mean that it’s having difficulty gener-
ating new cash. But you can’t determine that with this calculation — it tells 
you that the company may have a problem, but it doesn’t give you a specific 
answer as to what the problem may be. What you do find out from this for-
mula is that you must seek additional information by continuing the financial 
analysis of other line items (such as accounts receivable and inventory) and 
by reading the notes to the financial statements (see Chapter 9) or manage-
ment’s discussion and analysis (see Chapter 5).
Hasbro
Now I show you how to calculate the free cash flow by using Hasbro’s 2007 
and 2006 cash flow statements.
2007
2006
Cash provided by operating 
activities
$601,794,000
$320,647,000
Minus capital expenditures
 
Purchases of property, plant, 
 
and equipment
(91,532,000)
(82,103,000)
Minus cash dividends
(94,097,000)
(75,282,000)
Free cash flow
$416,165,000
$163,262,000
Hasbro’s free cash flow is much stronger than Mattel’s for 2007. Also, Hasbro’s 
free cash flow increased from 2006 to 2007. This means that Hasbro has no 
trouble maintaining its cash-flow levels and actually improving its cash flow.
What do the numbers mean?
No question, the more free cash flow a company has, the better it’s doing 
financially. A company with significant free cash flow is in a strong posi-
tion to weather a financial storm, be it a recession, a slowdown in sales, or 
another type of financial emergency.
 
If a company’s free-cash-flow number is negative, it must seek external financ-
ing to fund its growth. Negative or very low free-cash-flow numbers for young 
growth companies that need to make significant investments in new property, 
plant, or equipment are most likely not an indication of a big problem. But you 

184
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
should still look deeper into the financial reports, and especially the notes to 
the financial statements (see Chapter 9), to find out why the cash flow is so 
low and how the managers plan to raise additional capital. This is especially 
true if you see a negative free cash flow for an older company, which should 
immediately raise a red flag.
Figuring out cash return on sales ratio
You can test how well a company’s sales are generating cash using the cash 
return on sales ratio. This ratio looks at profitability from cash rather than 
from the accrual-based income perspective. Remember, the accrual-based 
income perspective means that income and expenses are recognized when 
the transaction is complete, so there’s no guarantee that cash has been 
received. I talk more about this in Chapter 4.
Making sure a business is properly managing its cash flow is critical when 
assessing the company’s ability to stay in business and pay its bills. Sales are 
the primary way a company generates its cash.
Here’s the formula for calculating the cash return on sales ratio, which spe-
cifically measures cash generated by sales:
Net cash provided by operating activities ÷ Net sales = Cash return 
on sales
 
You can find the line item “Net cash provided by operating activities” on the 
cash flow statement in the operating activities section, and you find “Net 
sales” or “Net revenue” at the top of the income statement.
Mattel
 I use Mattel’s cash flow and income statements to show you how to calculate 
the cash return on sales ratio:
$560,532,000 (Net cash provided by operating activities) ÷ $5,970,090,000 
(Net sales) = 9.4% (Cash return on sales)
From looking at this equation, you can see that 9.4 percent of the dollars 
that Mattel generates from its sales provide cash for the company. Mattel’s 
net profit margin (the bottom line, or how much the company makes after all 
costs and expenses are subtracted), which I show you how to calculate in 
Chapter 11, is 10.05 percent. Mattel’s cash return on sales is slightly lower 
than its net profit margin. Although the difference isn’t significant, you do 
need to investigate the numbers more closely. As indicated above, Mattel’s 
inventory generated less cash in 2007 than in 2006. Also, significantly more 
was paid out in accounts payable, so that may be why the warning signs are 
here. You’ll know more after looking at the numbers in Chapters 15 and 16.

185
 Chapter 13: Making Sure the Company Has Cash to Carry On
Hasbro
Using Hasbro’s cash flow and income statements, I show you how to calcu-
late the cash return on sales ratio:
$601,794,000 (Net cash provided by operating activities) ÷ $3,837,557,000 
(Net sales) = 15.7% (Cash return on sales)
You can see that 15.7 percent of the dollars that Hasbro generates from its 
sales provide cash for the company. Hasbro’s net profit margin is 8.68 per-
cent (see Chapter 11), which is a strong sign that Hasbro is efficiently con-
verting its sales to cash.
What do the numbers mean?
The cash return on sales looks at the efficiency with which a company turns 
its sales into cash. Hasbro’s results show that it’s more efficient than Mattel 
at turning its sales dollars into cash. Add the fact that Mattel’s cash flow was 
negatively impacted by decreases in cash from inventory (see “Calculating 
free cash flow,” earlier in the chapter) and you get a clearer picture that 
Mattel may have a problem converting its sales to cash. In Chapter 16, I 
discuss how to evaluate a company’s accounts receivable turnover, which 
explains some of these cash problems.
 
Mattel’s cash return on sales is slightly lower than its profit margin, so the 
company may be showing the early signs of a problem or the strains of the toy 
recall in 2007, when problems in China may have cut significantly into profits. 
Just bear in mind that a cash return on sales ratio that’s lower than the profit 
margin ratio can be a major red flag. The company may be using aggressive 
accrual accounting practices that enable it to report higher net profit. I dis-
cuss these types of practices in Chapter 23.
Checking Out Debt
In addition to noting how much cash a company generates from sales, you 
need to look at the cash flow going out of the company to pay its debts. 
Whenever a business can’t pay its bills or the interest on its debt, it runs the 
risk of supply cutoffs and possible insolvency. Few vendors will continue 
sending products to a company that doesn’t pay its bills, and most creditors 
will seek ways to collect a debt if they don’t receive the interest and principal 
due on that debt.
You can check out a company’s ability to pay its debt by looking at its debt 
levels and the cash available to pay that debt. You do this by collecting num-
bers related to debt levels from the balance sheet and comparing them with 
cash-outflow numbers from the statement of cash flows.

186
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
Determining current cash 
debt coverage ratio
You can determine whether a company has enough cash to meet its short-
term needs by calculating the current cash debt coverage ratio. You calculate 
this number by dividing the cash provided by operating activities by the 
average current liabilities.
Here’s the two-step formula for calculating the current cash debt coverage 
ratio:
 
1. Find the average current liabilities.
 
 Current liabilities for current year + Current liabilities for previous year 
÷ 2 = Average current liabilities
 
2. Find the current cash debt coverage ratio.
 
 Cash provided by operating activities ÷ Average current liabilities = 
Current cash debt coverage ratio
 
You can find current liabilities for the current year and the previous year on 
the balance sheet. You can find cash provided by operating activities on the 
statement of cash flows.
Mattel
 Using the cash provided by operating activities from Mattel’s 2007 cash flow 
statement and the average of its current liabilities from its 2007 and 2006 bal-
ance sheets, I show you how to calculate the current cash debt coverage ratio. 
Using the two-step process, I first calculate the average current liabilities, and 
then I use that number to calculate the ratio:
 
1. Calculate average current liabilities.
 
 $1,570,429,000 (2007 current liabilities) + $1,582,520,000 (2006 current 
liabilities) ÷ 2 = $1,576,474,500 (Average current liabilities)
 
2. Calculate the ratio for the current reporting year.
 
 $560,532,000 (Cash provided by operating activities, 2007) ÷ 
$1,576,474,500 (Average current liabilities) = 0.36 (Current cash debt 
coverage ratio)
 
To determine whether a company’s cash provided by activities is improving, 
you should also calculate the ratio for the previous reporting year. In this case:
$875,946,000 (Cash provided by operating activities, 2006) ÷ 
$1,576,474,500 (Average current liabilities) = 0.56 (Current cash debt cov-
erage ratio)

187
 Chapter 13: Making Sure the Company Has Cash to Carry On
This comparison shows you that Mattel’s cash position worsened from the 
end of 2006 to the end of 2007. A ratio of 0.36 in 2007 shows that only slightly 
more than a third of its current liabilities were paid by cash taken in from 
sales, while in 2006, the ratio of 0.56 shows that close to 56 percent of its cur-
rent liabilities were paid by cash taken in from sales. Taking a closer look at 
the cash flow statement, you can see the primary reason for the decline is 
related to decreases in cash from inventories. Also, more money was paid out 
in accounts payable. I show you how to take a closer look at these accounts 
in Chapters 15 and 16.
Hasbro
Now I use the cash provided by operating activities from Hasbro’s 2007 
cash flow statement and the average of its current liabilities from its 2007 
and 2006 balance sheets to show you how to calculate the current cash 
debt coverage ratio:
 
1. Calculate average current liabilities.
 
 $887,671,000 (2007 current liabilities) + $905,893,000 (2006 current liabili-
ties) ÷ 2 = $896,782,000 (Average current liabilities)
 
2. Calculate the ratio for the current reporting year.
 
 $601,794,000 (Cash provided by operating activities, 2007) ÷ $896,782,000 
(Average current liabilities) = 0.67 (Current cash debt coverage ratio)
For comparison’s sake, calculate the ratio for the previous reporting year 
as well:
$320,647,000 (Cash provided by operating activities, 2006) ÷ $896,782,000 
(Average current liabilities) = 0.36 (Current cash debt coverage ratio)
Hasbro ended 2007 in a stronger cash position than Mattel. Its current cash 
debt coverage improved from .36 in 2006 to .67 in 2007.
What do the numbers mean?
The current cash debt coverage ratio looks at a company’s ability to pay its 
short-term obligations. The higher the ratio, the better.
A negative “cash provided by operating activities” number is a possible 
danger sign that the company isn’t generating enough cash from operations. 
You need to investigate why its cash from operations is insufficient. You 
should look for explanations in the notes to the financial statements or in the 
management’s discussion and analysis. If you don’t find the answers there, 
call the company’s investor relations department. Also look at analysis writ-
ten by the financial press or independent analysts.

188
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
 
It’s not unusual for growth companies to report negative cash from operations 
because they’re spending money to grow the company. However, a negative 
cash flow can’t be sustained for long, so be sure you understand the compa-
ny’s long-term plans to improve its cash position.
Computing cash debt coverage ratio
You also want to look at a company’s ability to pay debt that’s due over the 
long term. Current liabilities only include debt that a company must pay in 
the next 12 months. Long-term liabilities are debts that a company must pay 
beyond that 12-month period. If you see signs that a firm may have difficul-
ties meeting long-term debt, that, too, is a major cause for concern. Although 
you may find that a company generates enough cash to meet its current lia-
bilities, if long-term debt levels are too high, the company will eventually run 
into trouble paying off its debt and meeting its interest obligations. You can 
measure a company’s cash position to meet long-term debt needs by using 
the cash debt coverage ratio.
The formula for the cash debt coverage ratio is a two-step process:
 
1. Find the average total liabilities.
 
 (Current year total liabilities + Previous year total liabilities) ÷ 2 = 
Average total liabilities
 
2. Find the cash debt coverage ratio.
 
 Cash provided by operating activities ÷ Average total liabilities = Cash 
debt coverage ratio
 
You can find the current- and previous-year total liabilities on the balance 
sheet. You can find cash provided by operating activities on the statement of 
cash flows.
Mattel
 Using the cash provided by operating activities from Mattel’s 2007 cash flow 
statement and the average of its total liabilities from its 2007 and 2006 balance 
sheets, I show you how to calculate the cash debt coverage ratio. Using the 
two-step process, I first calculate the average total liabilities, and then I use 
that number to calculate the ratio:
 
1. Calculate average total liabilities.
 
 $2,498,713,000 (2007 total liabilities) + $2,522,910,000 (2006 total liabili-
ties) ÷ 2 = $2,510,811,500 (Average total liabilities)

189
 Chapter 13: Making Sure the Company Has Cash to Carry On
 
2. Find the cash debt coverage ratio.
 
 $560,532,000 (2007 cash provided by operating activities) ÷ 
$2,510,811,500 (Average total liabilities) = 0.22 (Cash debt coverage ratio)
To judge whether a company’s cash provided by activities is improving, 
you calculate the ratio for both the current reporting year and the previous 
reporting year:
$875,946,000 (2006 cash provided by operating activities) ÷ $2,510,811,500 
(Average total liabilities) = 0.35 (Cash debt coverage ratio)
This ratio serves as evidence that Mattel’s cash position worsened from the 
end of 2006 to the end of 2007. Its cash position worsened because less cash 
came into the company from inventories and more went out in accounts pay-
able. Mattel’s long-term debt decreased between 2006 and 2007 by about $86 
million according to its balance sheet, but short-term borrowings increased 
by $349 million.
Hasbro
To show you how to calculate the cash debt coverage ratio, I use the cash 
provided by operating activities from Hasbro’s 2007 cash flow statement and 
the average of its total liabilities from its 2007 and 2006 balance sheets:
 
1. Calculate average total liabilities.
 
 $1,851,971,000 (2007 total liabilities) + $1,559,015,000 (2006 total liabili-
ties) ÷ 2 = $1,705,493,000 (Average total liabilities)
 
2. Calculate the cash debt coverage ratio for the current reporting year.
 
 $601,794,000 (2007 cash provided by operating activities) ÷ 
$1,705,493,000 (Average total liabilities) = 0.35 (Cash debt coverage ratio)
Calculate the ratio for the previous year as well:
$320,647,000 (2006 cash provided by operating activities) ÷ $1,705,493,000 
(Average total liabilities) = 0.18 (Cash debt coverage ratio)
Taking total liabilities into consideration, Hasbro ended 2007 in about the 
same cash position as Mattel. Hasbro carried a larger portion of its debt as 
long-term debt. You can see this by comparing the balance sheet line items 
for long-term debt for Mattel and Hasbro.
What do the numbers mean?
The cash debt coverage ratio looks at a company’s ability to pay its long-
term debt obligations. As you can see, when long-term debt is taken into 
consideration, Hasbro’s position equalized with Mattel’s. Although Mattel 

190
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
carries a larger share of its debt as short-term debt, Hasbro’s debt structure 
is more heavily dependent on long-term debt. So calculating only one ratio or 
the other — current cash debt coverage ratio or cash debt coverage ratio — 
won’t give you the full picture of a company’s financial health. You need to 
look at both ratios to be certain that the company is generating enough cash 
to cover both its short-term and long-term debt. In Chapter 9, I talk more 
about this debt-structure difference when looking at the explanations given in 
the notes to the financial statements.
 
As with the current cash debt coverage ratio, if you find a negative cash from 
operations number, be sure to look for an explanation in the notes to the finan-
cial statements or in the management’s discussion and analysis to find out 
why the cash flow from operations is negative. If you don’t find it there, call 
the company’s investor relations office to get the answers to your questions.
Calculating Cash Flow Coverage
Debt and the interest paid on that debt are not a company’s only cash 
requirements. Businesses also need cash for capital expansion to grow the 
company (including new plants, tools, and equipment) and pay dividends to 
investors.
As a shareholder, the only way you make money is when the company’s 
stock goes up in price. The stock market rewards a company with good 
growth potential by bidding up the price of its stock. Firms that show low 
growth prospects usually have few buyers and end up with lower stock 
prices. So you want to invest in companies that not only generate enough 
cash to pay their bills, interest, and the principals on their long-term debts, 
but also have money left over to pay dividends to their shareholders and 
grow their company. Remember that many growth companies don’t pay divi-
dends at all but instead reinvest all profits toward future growth.
 
You can test whether a company is generating enough cash to cover its capital 
expenditures, pay its dividends, and pay its debt obligations by calculating the 
cash flow coverage ratio.
Finding out the cash flow coverage ratio
You use a two-step process to calculate the cash flow coverage ratio:
 
1. Calculate the company’s cash requirements.
 
 Add the following:
 
 Capital expenditures (listed in the investing activities section of the cash 
flow statement)

191
 Chapter 13: Making Sure the Company Has Cash to Carry On
 
 Cash dividends paid (listed in the financing activities section of the cash 
flow statement)
 
 Interest expenses (listed on the income statement)
 
 Current portion of long-term debt (listed in the financing activities sec-
tion of the cash flow statement)
 
2. Calculate the cash flow coverage ratio.
 
 Cash provided by operating activities ÷ Cash requirements = Cash flow 
coverage ratio
 
You can find cash provided by operating activities on the statement of cash 
flows.
Mattel
 I use Mattel’s financial statements to show you how to calculate its cash flow 
coverage ratio:
 
1. Find Mattel’s cash requirements.
 
 Capital expenditures 
$146,633,000
 
 Plus cash dividends paid 
$272,343,000
 
 Plus interest paid 
$70,974,000
 
 Plus current portion of long-term debt 
$100,000,000
 
 Cash requirements 
$589,950,000
 
 For capital expenditures, I used two line items on the cash flow state-
ment: purchases of tools, dies, and molds; and purchases of other prop-
erty, plant, and equipment. For current portion of long-term debt, I used 
the payments of long-term debt line item on the cash flow statement.
 
2. Calculate the cash flow coverage ratio.
 
 $560,532,000 (2007 cash provided by operating activities) ÷ $589,950,000 
(Cash requirements) = 0.95 (Cash flow coverage ratio)
Mattel didn’t generate enough cash from its operations to pay all its cash 
requirements for 2007. The .95 cash flow coverage ratio means that Mattel 
generated only enough cash to cover 95 percent of its cash requirements. 
To cover the rest of its cash needs, a company has to either borrow money 
or draw down cash on hand from activities in previous years. Any firm that 
must draw down savings to maintain its operating activities is likely show-
ing signs of trouble. Because Mattel has a large cash stash, it has enough 
to cover, but how long can it do that before the cash runs out and it gets in 
trouble? Anytime a company can’t meet its cash requirements, you should 
seriously reconsider investing in it.

192
Part III: Analyzing the Numbers 
Hasbro
Now I use Hasbro’s financial statements to show you how to calculate its 
cash flow coverage ratio:
 
1. Find Hasbro’s cash requirements.
 
 Capital expenditures 
$91,532,000
 
 Plus cash dividends paid 
$94,097,000
 
 Plus interest paid 
$34,618,000
 
 Cash requirements 
$220,247,000
 
 For capital expenditures, I used the additions to property, plant, and 
equipment line item on the cash flow statement. Hasbro had no long-
term debt payments in 2007.
 
2. Calculate the cash flow coverage ratio.
 
 $601,794,000 (2007 cash provided by operating activities) ÷ $220,247,000 
(Cash requirements) = 2.7 (Cash flow coverage ratio)
Hasbro generated more than enough cash from its operations to pay all its 
cash requirements in 2007. This ratio shows that Hasbro generated enough 
cash to cover more than 200 percent of its cash requirements.
What do the numbers mean?
Mattel had to find sources other than operations to meet the shortfall in its 
cash requirements. Mattel used cash on hand at the beginning of the year 
to make up the cash shortfall, which you can see when you look at the cash 
and short-term investments on hand (at the bottom of the statement of cash 
flows) at the beginning of the year versus the end of the year.
Long term, Mattel seems a bit shaky on meeting its cash needs from opera-
tions, but neither company has a problem with insolvency (not being able 
to pay bills and debt obligations). At the bottom of Mattel’s cash flow state-
ment, you can see that Mattel still held $901,148,000 in cash and short-term 
investments at the end of 2007, while Hasbro had $774,458,000 in cash and 
short-term investments at the end of 2007.
 
Companies that generate more than enough cash have a cash flow coverage 
ratio of more than 100 percent. The higher the ratio, the better. If you see a 
company that isn’t able to cover its cash requirements and has little left in 
cash and short-term investments, you should raise the red flag.

Companies Optimize 
Operations

In this part . . .
I
 show you how to analyze a company’s operations to 
find out whether the management team is effectively 
using its resources. After discussing the role that financial 
reporting plays in the basic budgeting process, I show you 
how to assess management’s effectiveness. I also give you 
the tools for measuring asset- and cash-management 
efficiency.

Basic Budgeting

▶ Putting internal budget reports to work
N
o matter how good the numbers look, you don’t know how well a com-
pany is really doing until you compare the actual numbers with the 
company’s expectations. Expectations (the budget targets a company hopes 
to meet) are spelled out during the budgeting process, in which the company 
projects its financial needs for the next year. At different times throughout 
the year, these budgets are used, along with periodic financial reports, by 
managers looking to determine how close the company is to meeting its 
budget targets.
As an outsider, you don’t have access to the company’s budgets or the 
reports related to them. But for those of you seeking to find out more about 
internal financial reports and how to use them effectively, understanding the 
budgeting process is critical.
This chapter discusses the budgeting process and how it complements 
financial reporting. A well-planned budgeting process not only helps a com-
pany plan for the next year but also provides managers with key information 
throughout the year to be sure the company is meeting its goals and raising 
red flags when it doesn’t reach its goals. The sooner managers recognize a 
problem, the greater their ability is to fix it before the end of the year.

196
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
Peering into the Budgeting Process
The budget that a company sets for itself relies on a lot of careful calcula-
tions and some guesswork about the amount of revenue it expects from the 
sale of products and services, as well as the expenses it will incur to manu-
facture or purchase the products it sells and to cover the other operating 
expenses during the next year. Creating a budget is a lot more complicated 
than just making a list of expected revenues and expenses. I talk more about 
the basics of revenue and expenses in Chapters 4 and 7.
Companies use one of two approaches to budgeting:
 
✓ Top down approach: Key executives set budgets and give them to 
department heads to meet. Most employees aren’t involved in the bud-
geting process; instead, those at the top impose the numbers on the 
employees, who are expected to meet them. The big problem with this 
type of budget process is that the employees don’t feel any ownership 
of the budget and frequently complain that the budget handed down to 
them is unrealistic, which is why they can’t meet expectations.
 
 Few large corporations use the top down approach today. You’re more 
likely to find this approach in small businesses run by one person or a 
small group of partners.
 
✓ Bottom up approach: Budgets are created at the department level based 
on overall companywide goals and guidelines that the board of directors 
and top executives set. This approach encourages employee participa-
tion in the budgeting process, so the employees have more of a sense 
of budget ownership. Because they help develop the budget, they can’t 
later claim that the budget is unrealistic if it turns out that they don’t 
meet expectations.
 
Most management studies show that the bottom up approach works better 
because managers and staff members are more likely to take a budget seri-
ously and follow it if they have some involvement in developing it. In this 
chapter, I focus on the process for bottom up budget development, which is 
the most commonly used budgeting process in large corporations today.
Who does what
Everyone has a role to play in bottom up budgeting. Top executives who are 
part of a budget committee set companywide goals and objectives. Then, 
starting at the lowest staff levels, each department determines its budget 
needs. These budgets work their way through the management tree to the 
top, where numbers from each department are pulled together to develop a 
companywide budget.

197
 Chapter 14: How Reports Help with Basic Budgeting
The budget committee manages the entire process and is responsible for 
determining budget policies and coordinating budget preparation among 
departments. Most often, this committee includes the president; chief finan-
cial officer (CFO); controller; and vice presidents of various functions, such 
as marketing, sales, production, and purchasing.
Even before the departments start to develop their budgets, the budget com-
mittee develops rules that all departments must follow. These rules likely 
include a request to hold all budgets to a certain percentage increase in 
costs, and possibly even a reduction in costs. These guidelines help depart-
ments develop budgets that meet company needs while proposing something 
the departments can live with through the year.
The budget committee doesn’t mandate what the department’s actual budget 
should be or how the department should find a way to keep its costs down; 
those decisions are left to each individual department. One department may 
decide it can cut costs by reducing staff; another may determine to cut costs 
by getting better control of the use of supplies; another may decide that 
cutting back on the use of rental equipment or temporary help can meet its 
cost-cutting goals. By leaving these choices to the departments rather than 
mandating the numbers from the top, companies give employees a stake in 
meeting their budget goals.
After the budgets are developed at the section and department levels, the 
budget committee gives final approval for all budgets. The committee also 
resolves any disputes that may arise in the budget process. Budget dis-
putes can occur when different departments have conflicting goals to meet. 
For example, say the manufacturing department is mandated to cut costs, 
while the sales department must increase sales to meet its goals. The manu-
facturing manager may make a decision to cut costs in a way that lowers 
product-quality standards. However, the sales manager may believe that this 
cost-cutting method will create problems in maintaining customer satisfac-
tion and ultimately hurt sales. The budget committee acts as the mediator for 
this kind of decision-making process.
Setting goals
To develop companywide budget guidelines, the budget committee must first 
determine the goals for the company. Before they can set those goals, they 
gather information about where the company stands financially, how the 
company fits into the bigger economic picture, and how it stacks up against 
its competitors. This information forms the basis for what the committee 
determines it needs to accomplish during the next year, such as increasing 
market share, increasing profit, or entering a new market area completely. 
Sections and departments can then estimate the resources they need to meet 
those goals.

198
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
The first critical step for goal setting is to develop a sales forecast (a projec-
tion of the number of sales the company will make during the year), usually 
involving the staff of several departments, including marketing, sales, and 
finance. Much of the data collected by this staff is from industry research 
reports as well as from actual company numbers from the accounting, 
finance, and marketing departments.
 
Factors that must be considered to develop an accurate sales forecast include
 
✓ Past sales success: By looking at a breakdown of sales by product for the 
past three to five years, a company can look for trends and make a best 
guess about future sales growth potential.
 
✓ Potential pricing policy: By looking at past sales, a company can deter-
mine if the current pricing policy is viable or if changes are needed. 
Products that are moving quickly off the shelves may be able to sustain 
a price increase, while those that aren’t moving may need a price cut 
to stimulate sales. Pricing isn’t set solely by sales success or failure, of 
course; costs for producing the product are a key factor as well.
 
✓ Data about unfilled orders and backlogs: This data helps a com-
pany determine which product lines may need to be modified to meet 
demand.
 
✓ Market research: This research includes potential sales and competi-
tive data for the entire industry, as well as forecasts for the individual 
company. This information lets the committee know where the com-
pany fits in the industry and what potential the industry may have in 
the next year.
 
✓ Information about general economic conditions: This research gives 
the budget committee an overview of expected economic conditions 
for the next year so they know whether there’s potential for growth or 
a possible reduction in sales. For example, if the economy has seen a 
slowdown during the past three years but economists are now predict-
ing a market recovery, the company may need to increase manufactur-
ing goals to meet anticipated increasing demand.
 
✓ Industry economic conditions: A company monitors these conditions to 
determine whether the industry in which it operates is set for a growth 
spurt, a downturn, or is expected to perform at the same level in the 
next year.
 
✓ Industry competition data: Reviews of competitors’ marketing strate-
gies, advertising, and other competitive factors must also be considered 
when developing future goals in order to stay competitive within the 
industry. This information must be reviewed to determine where the 
company sits in relation to its competitors and whether new competi-
tors are on the horizon that could challenge the company’s products.

199
 Chapter 14: How Reports Help with Basic Budgeting
 
✓ Market share data: A company collects this data, which is the percent-
age of the market held by the company’s products, to help set goals — 
whether to increase market share or maintain current levels. Growth 
potential depends on increasing market share, but if the company 
already holds nearly 100 percent of the market, like Microsoft does in 
the operating systems market for personal computers, room for growth 
may not exist. In that case, marketing strategists focus on tactics for 
maintaining that market share.
In addition to the hard numbers, a company collects information from staff 
members at all levels to get a firsthand view of what’s actually happening in 
the field. This information includes reports about exchanges with customers, 
vendors, and contractors. Real-world data that a company collects from sales 
staff, customer service staff, purchasers, and other employees gives the com-
pany additional information and allows it to test the numbers.
Building Budgets
After the budget committee finishes data collection (see the preceding sec-
tion), it can determine sales goals for the company. After the committee estab-
lishes goals, it uses them to develop strategies — the actual methods used 
to reach the goals — and build budgets that reflect the resources needed to 
carry out the strategies. Although the budget committee sets companywide 
goals and global strategies, each section and department translates those 
broad goals and strategies into specific goals and strategies for its own staff.
 
Armed with its goals and strategies, each department develops its specific 
budget. Not all departments develop their budgets at exactly the same time, 
because some departments depend on others to make budget decisions. For 
example, sales revenue must be projected before the company can make 
decisions about production levels and just about every other aspect of its 
operations.
Common budget categories include the following, which I organize according 
to the order in which they’re produced:
 
✓ Sales budget: Sales managers start their budget planning by forecast-
ing sales levels and the gross revenue they anticipate those levels will 
generate. Most other budgets depend on the goals set by sales, so this 
budget is usually the first to be developed. Without a sales budget, pro-
duction managers don’t know how many products to produce, and pur-
chasing managers don’t know how many items to buy.

200
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
 
✓ Production budget: If the company manufactures its own product, 
then this is the next budget to be developed. The production depart-
ment looks at the beginning inventory left from the previous planning 
period and plans what additional inventory is needed, based in part on 
the forecasts in the sales budget. Production planning can be a difficult 
development task. Making sure they have a just-right level of inventory 
means that production managers must be sure they plan for the right 
amount of raw materials, the efficient use of production facilities, and an 
appropriate number of staff members to produce the products to meet 
customer needs on time.
 
✓ Inventory purchases budget: For companies that don’t manufacture 
their own products, the budgeting process focuses on purchasing 
needed inventory and being sure it’s delivered on time to meet customer 
needs. Similar issues drive purchasing concerns because a company 
wants to be sure it has enough product on hand to meet customer 
demand. But at the same time, it doesn’t want too many products left 
over, because that means resources were wasted on inventory and 
could have been better used to meet other company needs.
 
✓ Direct materials budget: This budget controls the raw materials needed 
to meet the production schedule. The last problem any company wants 
to face is not having enough materials on hand to keep the product line 
moving, thus risking a factory shutdown. But the company also wants to 
avoid keeping too many materials on hand, because doing so increases 
warehousing expenses. Also, holding raw materials too long can result in 
material spoilage.
 
✓ Direct labor budget: This budget is unique to manufacturing companies 
and is dependent on the production budget. Companies work hard to 
determine how much staff they need to meet production needs. If they 
hire too few people, they have to deal with overtime charges, or in the 
worst cases, they face production shortfalls. If companies hire too many 
people, they may end up spending more than necessary on salaries or 
have to lay off employees — which is a huge blow to morale.
 
✓ Selling and administrative expense budgets: Many smaller depart-
ments are involved in getting a product to market and supporting those 
sales. These departments include accounting, finance, marketing, human 
resources, mailroom, and materials management. After sales revenue 
is known and the cost of selling those goods has been determined, the 
remaining resources are divided up between the company’s selling and 
administrative needs.
 
✓ Master budget: After everyone signs off on each of the department and 
section budgets, the accounting department prepares a master budget 
which the company uses as a road map to test how well each depart-
ment is doing in meeting its budget expectations.

201
 Chapter 14: How Reports Help with Basic Budgeting
 
✓ Cash budget: After all the budgets are completed and combined into a 
master budget, the accounting department develops a cash budget that 
estimates the monthly cash needs for each department. Based on this 
budget, the finance department determines whether enough cash will 
be generated by operations to meet the cash needs or whether other 
financing is needed to maintain the company’s cash flow.
When all the budget planning is complete, the accounting department devel-
ops a budgeted income statement (see Chapter 7 for more information on 
income statements) to test whether the budgeting process has created a 
budget that truly meets profit-planning goals. If the answer is no, the budget 
committee then has to decide where budget changes are needed to meet 
company goals. A lot of negotiating is often necessary between the budget 
committee and the company’s top managers to determine budget changes.
 
If the budget committee imposes unrealistic changes on the budget for 
a department, little budget compliance from that department is likely to 
happen, and financial difficulties could develop throughout the year. Budgets 
that department and section managers can live with have a better chance of 
producing expected results and meeting goals.
Providing Monthly Budget Reports
No matter how thoroughly prepared, a budget is useless if it’s not matched to 
actual revenue and expenses. So throughout the budget period, the account-
ing department prepares monthly internal financial reports (reports that sum-
marize financial results) for the managers, who use these reports to identify 
where the budget is going right or wrong. Many of these internal financial 
reports have a system of red flags that identify areas where the actual results 
aren’t meeting budget expectations.
Each company has its own style for internal reports, but most reports include 
similar types of information. The report is usually broken into five columns:
 
✓ Red flag: A symbol, such as an asterisk, is usually used in the first or last 
column to identify problem line items in a budget. Instead of a symbol, 
some companies add a column with an explanation of the variances 
between actual and budgeted numbers.
 
✓ Line item: This column lists the budget categories as they appear on the 
section or department budget.
 
✓ Budget amount: This column states the dollar amount allocated for the 
period of the internal financial report.

202
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
 
✓ Actual amount: This column states how much the company spent 
during the period of the internal financial report.
 
✓ Difference: This column shows how close (or far apart) the actual and 
budgeted numbers are.
Many companies also include a year-to-date section on the internal financial 
reports that shows the same information on a year-to-date basis in addition 
to the information specific to the month or quarter.
Figure 14-1 shows an internal report for March 2008 for a fictitious company 
called ABC Company. In this example, a flag appears automatically on the 
report if the difference is greater than $100,000, but each company deter-
mines its own designated levels for red flags. A small company may flag items 
for a difference of just $5,000, and a large corporation may flag items for dif-
ferences at much higher levels.

Although Figure 14-1 uses an income statement format, internal reports 
have no required format, and each company develops its own report format 
depending on what works best for the company.
In Figure 14-1, you can see that flags have been marked next to Sales, Gross 
Margin, and Net Income. Flags were thrown because those line items show 
differences of more than $100,000, and therefore, management needs to 
investigate them.
A glance at Figure 14-1 shows that the key problem is lower-than-expected 
sales revenue. Sales were budgeted for $1.4 million, and the actual sales 
were $200,000 less, at $1.2 million. That difference is shown on the report’s 
first line. Management first needs to determine why sales are lower than 

203
 Chapter 14: How Reports Help with Basic Budgeting
forecasted and then develop strategies for correcting the problem. The fact 
that cost of goods sold and administrative expenses are lower than budgeted 
could be a sign that management recognized the problem after a previous 
month’s report and already initiated cost-cutting programs.
After looking at the report in Figure 14-1, executives have to determine what 
the problem is and what other changes may be needed to get the budget 
back in line. If external factors such as economic conditions are to blame, the 
best the company can do is revise the budget to meet current economic con-
ditions so that further slippage in net income can be avoided.
 
Internal financial reports aren’t important just to find out about the bad news; 
good news can also require critical actions. For example, if sales are much 
higher than expected, a company may need to put plans in place to be sure 
it can meet the unexpected demand without losing sales. After all, customers 
don’t want to wait weeks or months to get their products, and they may seek 
out a competitor to fulfill their needs if products aren’t available when they’re 
ready to buy.
If conditions change from expectations, a company can more easily make a 
midyear correction if budgets have been accurately prepared. The company 
knows what was expected, and it can tweak its revenues or expenses to cor-
rect a problem long before the shortfall becomes disastrous.
In Chapter 17, I talk about strategies companies use to keep cash flowing 
when internal financial reports don’t meet expectations.
Using Internal Reports
Inside your company, you probably see much more detailed reports than 
the sample in Figure 14-1. A department head sees only the budget line items 
related to his or her department, and only the budget committee and depart-
ments responsible for developing budget reports have access to company-
wide internal reports.
The internal financial report you receive as a manager is usually based on 
the budget you develop. The line items listed are those directly related to 
your department functions. Any line item whose difference exceeds the dif-
ference allowed by the company is flagged, and you’ll need to find out why. 
Sometimes, the answer is clear. For example, if you know sales were higher 
or lower than expected, you simply need to report why, and what you’re 
doing to correct any problems. Other times, the answer will require some 
digging on your part.

204
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
After a report arrives at your office door, you don’t have much time to figure 
out what the differences are and what they mean for your department. If the 
differences are big, you can probably expect a call from your manager as 
soon as he sees his copy. When I was managing the finances for five depart-
ments, I knew I could expect a call from my manager even before I got my 
copy of the report. An entire day’s activities could be changed if a major dif-
ference showed up on an internal financial report, and I had to find out why.
 
Your best bet is to keep a good working relationship with someone in the 
accounting department who can help you sort through the details. Hopefully, 
you’ll find that the difference was based solely on a coding error, and the 
revenue or expense was just put in the wrong place. When that’s not the case, 
you’ll likely have to come up with some solution to correct the problem rather 
quickly.

T
esting how well a company manages its assets is a critical step in mea-
suring how effectively it uses its resources. Inventory is the most impor-
tant asset for generating cash for any company that sells a product.
Many factors directly impact the cost of selling a product, including pro-
ducing the product, purchasing the products or materials not produced 
in-house, storing the product until it’s sold, and shipping the product to the 
customer or store where it’s sold. And if a company doesn’t sell its product 
fast enough, the product may become obsolete or damaged before it’s sold.
In this chapter, I review the measures you can use to gauge how well a com-
pany manages its assets, especially its inventory, and how quickly the com-
pany sells the inventory.

206
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
Exploring Inventory Valuation Methods
A company must know the value of its inventory in order to complete its bal-
ance sheet. In addition, the company must set a value for the items it sells 
in order to include a cost-of-goods-sold number on its income statement (see 
Chapter 7). How that value is calculated depends on the accounting method 
the company uses. Five different methods are acceptable for determining the 
value of inventory, and each one can result in a different net income. These 
methods include
 
✓ Last In, First Out (LIFO) inventory system: This system assumes that 
the last item put onto the shelf is the first item sold. Each time a prod-
uct is purchased or manufactured to be put on the shelves, it costs a 
different amount. Most times, the cost goes up, so the last item put on 
the shelf likely costs more than the first item. Therefore, the goods sold 
first in the LIFO system are the highest-priced goods, which raises the 
cost-of-goods-sold number and lowers the net income. Stocking a shelf 
by leaving the older items in place and just adding the newly received 
products in front of them is a lot quicker. For example, hardware stores 
often use this method when restocking products that rarely change, like 
hammers and wrenches. Be aware that a company must use the same 
method for all its inventory.
Tracking inventory
Inventory tracking methods for large corpo-
rations can be a highly honed science that 
involves extensive computer programming and 
management, or they can be as simple as taking 
a count of what’s in stock. Companies use one 
of the following two systems to keep track of 
their goods on hand:
 ✓ Periodic inventory tracking: A company 
periodically counts inventory on hand to 
verify how many of the products are left 
on the shelves (if the company has retail 
outlets) and how many are left to be sold in 
the warehouse (or in cartons in the back of 
a store, if the company has retail outlets). 
Most companies that use periodic inven-
tory tracking do a physical count at least 
monthly, and possibly as often as daily, 
depending on the company’s sales volume.
 ✓ Perpetual inventory system: Using this 
system, a company gets an updated inven-
tory count after each sale. If you get a 
receipt that lists a long string of numbers 
next to each product’s name, the company 
most likely uses a perpetual inventory 
system. The long string of numbers is the 
tracking number assigned to the inventory 
in the computer system.
You’ve probably been the victim of a company’s 
perpetual inventory system if you’ve tried to buy 
something at a store when the cash register is 
down. I’ve actually been in stores that couldn’t 
make a sale because the cash register was 
down, and the store had no way to manually 
handle the sale.

207
 Chapter 15: Turning Up Clues in Turnover and Assets
 
✓ First In, First Out (FIFO) inventory system: This system assumes that 
the first item put on the shelf is the first item sold. Just as for LIFO, the 
cost of goods purchased or manufactured differs each time they’re 
bought or made. Usually, prices increase, so in the case of FIFO, the first 
item put on the shelf likely has a lower cost than the last item. Because 
the first item is the one sold first, the cost of goods sold will likely be 
lower than in a company that uses the LIFO method. Therefore, the cost-
of-goods-sold number will be lower, and the net income will be higher. 
For example, grocery stores must worry about spoilage, so they put the 
newly received products behind the older ones to be sure that the older 
products sell first before they spoil.
 
✓ Average-costing inventory system: This system doesn’t try to specify 
which items sell first or last but instead calculates the average cost 
of each unit sold. This method gives a company the best picture of its 
inventory cost trends because the ups and downs of prices don’t impact 
the company’s inventory. Instead, the inventory value levels out through 
the year. The net income will actually fall somewhere between the net 
income figures based on LIFO and FIFO.
 
✓ Specific-identification inventory system: This system actually tracks 
the value of each individual product in a company’s inventory. For 
example, car dealers track the value of each car in their stock by using 
this method. The net income is calculated by subtracting the cost of 
goods sold that have been specifically identified from the price at which 
the items are sold.
 
✓ Lower-of-cost or market inventory system: This system sets an inven-
tory value based on whichever cost is lower: the actual cost of inven-
tory or its current market value. Companies whose inventory values 
can change numerous times, even throughout a day, most often use this 
valuation method. For example, dealers in precious metals, commodi-
ties, and publicly traded securities commonly use this system.
In most cases, companies use the LIFO, FIFO, or average-costing inventory 
system. Specific-identification inventory is used only by companies that sell 
major items in which each item has a unique set of add-ons, such as cars or 
high-end computers. Therefore, each product has a different cost-of-goods-
sold value. The lower-of-cost or market inventory system is used primarily by 
companies that sell marketable securities and precious metals.
 
The way a company values its inventory has a major impact on its bottom line. 
The reason is that the figure a company uses on its income statement for cost 
of goods sold depends on the costs it assigns to the inventory it sold during 
the period covered by that income statement. The inventory’s value shown 
on the balance sheet is what’s left over and still held by the company, so the 
ending inventory’s value is the value of the goods still held by the company. 
This is listed as a current asset on the balance sheet.

208
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
If you’re a company outsider, you won’t be able to get the details needed to 
calculate the value of the products left in inventory. In fact, many times, only 
the company insiders directly involved in inventory decision-making have 
access to cost details. Many companies consider actual inventory costs to 
be a trade secret, and they don’t want their competitors to know the details. 
Nonetheless, understanding what’s behind those numbers and how different 
inventory methods can impact the bottom line is important for understand-
ing financial reports.
 
If you’re comparing two companies that use two different methods, you need 
to take that factor into consideration when doing the comparisons. You can 
find out in the notes to the financial statements which method a company uses.
To calculate a company’s cost of goods sold, you must know the value 
assigned to the beginning inventory (which is the same as the ending inven-
tory for the previous period and is also the same as the inventory number 
you find on the balance sheet). The beginning inventory is the number that’s 
used at the beginning of the next accounting period, so any purchases made 
during this period are added onto the beginning inventory. Finally, you need 
to number how much inventory is left at the end of the accounting period, 
which is called the ending inventory. Using those figures, here’s the formula 
for calculating the cost of goods sold:
 
1. Find the value of the goods available for sale.
 
 Beginning inventory + Purchases = Goods available for sale
 
2. Calculate the value of items sold.
 
 Goods available for sale – Ending inventory = Value of items sold
Applying Three Inventory 
Valuation Methods
To give you an idea of how inventory can impact the bottom line, the follow-
ing sections use an inventory scenario to take you through the calculations 
for cost-of-goods value by using the three key methods: average costing, 
FIFO, and LIFO.
In all three cases, I use the same beginning inventory, purchases, and ending 
inventory for a one-month accounting period in March.
 
1. 100 (Beginning inventory) + 500 (Purchases) = 600 (Goods available 
for sale)

209
 Chapter 15: Turning Up Clues in Turnover and Assets
 
2. 600 (Goods available for sale) – 100 (Ending inventory) = 500 (Items 
sold)
Three inventory purchases were made during the month:
March 1 
100 at $10
March 15 
200 at $11
March 25 
200 at $12
The beginning inventory value was 100 items at $9 each.
Average costing
Before you can use the average-costing inventory system, you need to calcu-
late the average cost per unit.
100 at $9  
 
= 
    $900 (Beginning inventory)
Plus purchases:
100 at $10 
 
= 
 $1,000 (March 1 purchase)
200 at $11 
 
= 
 $2,200 (March 15 purchase)
200 at $12 
 
= 
 $2,400 (March 25 purchase)
Cost of goods available for sale = $6,500
Average cost per unit:
$6,500 (Cost of goods available for sale) ÷ 600 (Number of units) = $10.83 
(Average cost per unit)
After you know the average cost per unit, you can calculate the cost of goods 
sold and the ending inventory value pretty easily by using the average-cost-
ing inventory system:
Cost of goods sold 
500 at $10.83 each 
= 
$5,415
Ending inventory 
100 at $10.83 each 
= 
$1,083
So the value of cost of goods sold using the average-costing method is 
$5,415. This is the figure you’d see as the cost-of-goods-sold line item on the 
income statement. The value of the inventory left on hand, or the ending 
inventory, is $1,083. This is the number you’d see as the inventory item on 
the balance sheet.

210
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
FIFO
To calculate FIFO, you don’t average costs. Instead, you look at the costs of 
the first units the company sold. With FIFO, the first units sold are the first 
units put on the shelves. Therefore, beginning inventory is sold first, then the 
first set of purchases, followed by the next set of purchases, and so on.
To find the cost of goods sold, add the beginning inventory to the purchases 
made during the reporting period. The remaining 100 units at $12 are the 
value of ending inventory. Here’s the calculation:
Beginning inventory: 100 at $9  
= 
   $900
March 1 purchase: 100 at $10 
 
= 
$1,000
March 15 purchase: 200 at $11  
= 
$2,200
March 25 purchase: 100 at $12  
= 
$1,200
Cost of goods sold 
 
 
= 
$5,300
Ending inventory:
From March 25: 100 at $12 
 
= 
$1,200
In this example, the cost of goods sold includes the value of the beginning 
inventory plus the purchases on March 1 and 15 and part of the purchase on 
March 25. Those units remaining on the shelf are from the last purchase on 
March 25. The cost of goods sold is $5,300, and the value of the inventory on 
hand, or the ending inventory, is $1,200.
LIFO
To calculate LIFO, start with the last units purchased and work backward 
to compute the cost of goods sold. The first 100 units at $9 in the beginning 
inventory end up being the same 100 at $9 for the ending inventory. Here’s 
the calculation:
March 25 purchase: 200 at $12  
= 
$2,400
March 15 purchase: 200 at $11  
= 
$2,200
March 1 purchase: 100 at $10 
 
= 
$1,000
Cost of goods sold 
 
 
= 
$5,600
Ending inventory:
From beginning inventory: 100 at $9 
= 
   $900
So the cost-of-goods-sold line item that you find on the income statement is 
$5,600, and the value of the inventory line item on the balance sheet is $900.

211
 Chapter 15: Turning Up Clues in Turnover and Assets
Comparing inventory methods 
and financial statements
Looking at the results of each method side by side shows you the impact that 
the inventory valuation system has on the net-income statement:
Income Statement 
Line Item
Averaging
FIFO
LIFO
Sales
$10,000
$10,000
$10,000
Cost of goods sold
$5,415
$5,300
$5,600
Income
$4,585
$4,700
$4,400
LIFO gives the lowest net-income figure and the highest cost of goods sold. 
Companies that use the LIFO system have higher costs to write off on their 
taxes, so they pay less in income taxes. FIFO gives companies the lowest cost 
of goods sold and the highest net income, so companies that use this method 
know that their bottom line looks better to investors.
Results for the inventory number on the balance sheet also differ using these 
different methods:
Averaging
FIFO
LIFO
Ending inventory
$1,083
$1,200
$900
 
LIFO users are likely to show the lowest inventory balance because their num-
bers are based on the oldest purchases, which, in many industries, cost the 
least. This situation is exactly opposite if you look at an industry in which the 
cost of goods is dropping in price — then the oldest goods can be the most 
expensive. For example, computer companies carrying older, outdated equip-
ment can have more expensive units sitting on the shelves if they try to use 
the Last In, First Out method, even though the units may not be worth any-
where near what the company paid for them.
Determining Inventory Turnover
The big question you should have for any company is how quickly it sells its 
inventory and turns a profit. As long as a company turns over its inventory 
quickly, you probably won’t find outdated products sitting on the shelves. 
But if the company’s inventory moves slowly, you’re more likely to find a 
problem in the valuation of its inventory.
You use a three-step process to find out how quickly product is moving out 
the door.

212
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
Calculating inventory turnover
Here’s the three-step formula for calculating a company’s inventory turnover:
 
1. Calculate the average inventory (the average number of units held in 
inventory).
 
 Beginning inventory + Ending inventory ÷ 2 = Average inventory
 
2. Calculate the inventory turnover (the number of times inventory is 
completely sold out during the accounting period).
 
 Cost of goods sold ÷ Average inventory = Inventory turnover
 
3. Calculate the number of days it takes for products to go through the 
inventory system, according to the accounting policies in the notes to 
the financial statements.
 
 365 ÷ Inventory turnover = Number of days to sell all inventory
In this calculation, you find out the number of days it takes the company to 
sell its entire inventory.
 I use Mattel’s and Hasbro’s 2007 income statements and balance sheets to 
show you how to calculate inventory turnover and the number of days it takes 
to sell that inventory. Both companies use the FIFO inventory system to value 
their inventory, according to the accounting policy in their notes to the finan-
cial statements.
Mattel
 
1. Find the average inventory.
 
 Use the inventory on hand December 31, 2006, as the beginning inven-
tory, and use the inventory remaining on December 21, 2007, as the 
ending inventory.
 
 $383,149,000 (Beginning inventory) + $428,710,000 (Ending inventory) ÷ 2 
= $405,929,500 (Average inventory)
 
2. Calculate the inventory turnover.
 
 You need the cost-of-goods-sold figure on the 2007 income statement to 
calculate the inventory turnover.
 
 $3,192,790,000 (Cost of goods sold) ÷ $405,929,500 (Average inventory) = 
7.87 (Inventory turnover)
 
 This figure means that Mattel completely sold out its inventory 7.87 
times during 2007.
 
3. Find the number of days it took for Mattel to sell out all its inventory.
 
 365 (Days) ÷ 7.87 (Inventory turnover) = 46.4

213
 Chapter 15: Turning Up Clues in Turnover and Assets
As an investor reading this report, you can assume that on average, Mattel 
sells all inventory on hand every 46.4 days. Remember, though, that isn’t true 
for every toy that Mattel makes. Popular toys may sell out and new stock may 
be needed every month, whereas less popular toys may sit on the shelf for 
several months or more. This calculation gives you an average for all types of 
toys sold.
Hasbro
 
1. Calculate the average inventory.
 
 Use the inventory on hand December 31, 2006, as the beginning inven-
tory, and use the inventory remaining on December 21, 2007, as the 
ending inventory.
 
 $203,337,000 (Beginning inventory) + $259,081,000 (Ending inventory) ÷ 2 
= $231,209,000 (Average inventory)
 
2. Calculate the inventory turnover.
 
 To do so, use the cost-of-goods-sold number on the 2007 income state-
ment.
 
 $1,576,621,000 (Cost of goods sold) ÷ $231,209,000 (Average inventory) = 
6.82 (Inventory turnover)
 
3. Find the number of days it took for Hasbro to sell off its inventory.
 
 365 (Days) ÷ 6.82 (Inventory turnover) = 53.5
So Hasbro sells its entire inventory every 53.5 days. Mattel is selling its 
toys faster.
What do the numbers mean?
Hasbro takes more than 50 days to sell all its inventory, and Mattel sells out 
every 46.4 days. Mattel turns over its inventory about 8 times a year, while 
Hasbro turns it over around 7 times per year. To judge how well both com-
panies are doing, check the averages for the industry — you can do so online 
at Bizstats (http://bizstats.com/inventory.htm). Using the stats for 
Miscellaneous Manufacturing, I find that 8.15 is the average inventory turn-
over ratio in the industry. So Mattel is slightly below average at 7.87, and 
Hasbro, at only 6.82, has some room for improvement.
 
If the company you’re evaluating has a slower than average inventory turn-
over, look for explanations in the management’s discussion and analysis and 
the notes to the financial statements to find out why the company is perform-
ing worse than its competitors. If the rate is higher, look for explanations for 
that as well; don’t get too excited until you know the reason why. The better 
numbers may be because of a one-time inventory change.

214
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
Investigating Fixed Assets Turnover
Next, you want to test how efficiently a company uses its fixed assets to gen-
erate sales, a ratio known as the fixed assets turnover. Fixed assets are assets 
that a company holds for business use for more than one year and that aren’t 
likely to be converted to cash any time soon. Fixed assets include items such 
as buildings, land, manufacturing plants, equipment, and furnishings. Using 
the fixed assets turnover ratio, you can determine how much per dollar of 
sales is tied up in buying and maintaining these long-term assets versus how 
much is tied up in assets that are more quickly used up.
 
If the economy goes sour and sales drop, reducing variable costs is much 
easier than reducing costs for maintaining fixed assets. The higher the fixed 
assets turnover ratio, the more nimble a company can be when responding to 
economic slowdowns.
Calculating fixed assets turnover
The fixed assets turnover ratio formula is
Net sales ÷ Net fixed assets = Fixed assets turnover ratio
 I show you how to calculate this ratio by using the net sales figures from 
Mattel’s and Hasbro’s income statements and the fixed assets figures from 
their balance sheets. For both companies, use the line item “Property, plant, 
and equipment, net.” (If a company doesn’t calculate its fixed assets for you, 
you have to add several line items together, such as buildings, tools, and 
equipment.)
Mattel
$5,970,090,000 (Net sales) ÷ $518,616,000 (Net fixed assets) = 11.51 (Fixed 
assets turnover ratio)
Hasbro
$3,837,557,000 (Net sales) ÷ $187,960,000 (Net fixed assets) = 20.42 (Fixed 
assets turnover ratio)

215
 Chapter 15: Turning Up Clues in Turnover and Assets
What do the numbers mean?
A higher fixed assets turnover ratio usually means that a company has 
less money tied up in fixed assets for each dollar of sales revenue that it 
generates. If the ratio is declining, that can mean that the company is over-
invested in fixed assets, such as plants and equipment. To improve the ratio, 
the company may need to close some of its plants and/or sell equipment it 
no longer needs.
 
You can tell whether a company’s fixed asset turnover ratio is increasing 
or decreasing by calculating the ratio for several years and comparing the 
results. The balance sheet includes two years’ worth of data, so in this exam-
ple, you may be able to find the financial statements for 2005 online, or if not, 
you can request them. Then you’d have the data for 2007 and 2006 on the 
2007 balance sheet, and you’d have the data for 2005 and 2004 on the 2005 
balance sheet.
Tracking Total Asset Turnover
Finally, you can look at how well a company manages its assets overall by 
calculating its total asset turnover. Rather than just looking at inventories or 
fixed assets, the total asset turnover measures how efficiently a company uses 
all its assets.
Calculating total asset turnover
The formula for calculating total asset turnover is
Net sales ÷ Total assets = Total asset turnover
 I use information from Mattel’s and Hasbro’s income statements and balance 
sheets to show you how to calculate total asset turnover. You can find the net 
sales at the top of the income statement and the total assets at the bottom of 
the assets section on the balance sheet. Here are the calculations:
Mattel
$5,970,090,000 (Net sales) ÷ $4,805,455,000 (Total assets) = 1.24 (Total 
asset turnover)

$3,837,557,000 (Net sales) ÷ $3,237,063,000 (Total assets) = 1.18 (Total 
asset turnover)
What do the numbers mean?
Mattel and Hasbro have similar asset ratios, so their efficiency in using their 
total assets to generate revenue is about equal. Both companies hold more 
than half their assets in current assets, which means that they’re relatively 
liquid and can respond quickly to industry changes.
 
A higher asset turnover ratio means that a company is likely to have a higher 
return on its assets, which some investors believe can compensate if the 
company has a low profit ratio. By compensate, I mean that the higher return 
on assets could mean increased valuation for the company and, therefore, a 
higher stock price.
In addition to looking at this ratio, when determining stock value, you need to 
calculate the profit ratios and return on assets (I show you how to calculate 
these in Chapter 11). Aside from inventory turnover, another key asset to 
consider is accounts receivable turnover, which I discuss in Chapter 16.

s the money flowing? That’s the million-dollar, and sometimes multi-
million-dollar, question. Measuring how well a company manages its 
inflow and outflow of cash is crucial to being able to stay in business. Cash 
is king in business — without it, you can’t pay the bills.
In this chapter, I review the key ratios for gauging cash flow and I show you 
how to calculate them. In addition, I explore how companies use their internal 
financial reporting to monitor slow-paying customers, and I discuss whether 
paying bills early or on time is better and how you can test that issue.
Assessing Accounts Receivable Turnover
Sales are great, but if customers don’t pay on time, the sales aren’t worth 
much to a business. In fact, someone who doesn’t pay for the products he 
takes is no better for business than a thief. When you’re assessing a com-
pany’s future prospects, one of the best ways to judge how well it’s managing 
its cash flow is to calculate the accounts receivable turnover ratio.
A balance sheet lists customer credit accounts under the line item “accounts 
receivable.” Any company that sells its goods on credit to customers must 
keep track of whom it extends credit to and whether those customers pay 
their bills.

218
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
 
Financial transactions involving credit card sales aren’t figured into accounts 
receivable but are handled like cash. The type of credit I’m referring to here 
is in-store credit, which is when the bill the customer receives comes directly 
from the store or company where the customer purchased the item.
When a store makes a sale on credit, it enters the purchase on the custom-
er’s credit account. At the end of each billing period, the store or company 
sends the customer a bill for the purchases she made on credit. The cus-
tomer usually has between 10 and 30 days from the billing date to pay the 
bill. When you calculate the accounts receivable turnover ratio, you’re seeing 
how fast the customers are actually paying those bills.
Calculating accounts receivable turnover
Here’s the three-step formula for testing accounts receivable turnover:
 
 1. Calculate the average accounts receivable:
 
 Add the current year’s accounts receivable and the previous year’s  
 
accounts receivable and divide by 2.
 
 2. Find the accounts receivable turnover ratio:
 
 Net sales ÷ Average accounts receivable = Accounts receivable turnover 
ratio
 
 3. Find the average sales credit period (the time it takes customers to 
pay their bills):
 
 52 weeks ÷ Accounts receivable turnover ratio = Average sales credit 
period
 
If you work inside the company, an even better test is to use annual credit 
sales rather than net sales because net sales include both cash and credit 
sales. But if you’re an outsider reading the financial statements, you can’t find 
out the credit sales number.
 I show you how to test accounts receivable turnover by using Mattel’s and 
Hasbro’s 2007 income statements and balance sheets.
Mattel
 
 1. Calculate the average accounts receivable:
 
 ($991,196,000 + $943,813,000)/2 = $967,504,500
 
 2. Find Mattel’s accounts receivable turnover ratio for 2007:
 
 $5,970,090,000 (Net sales) ÷ $967,504,500 (Average accounts receivable) 
= 6.17 times

219
 Chapter 16: Examining Cash Inflow and Outflow
 
 3. Find the average credit collection period:
 
 52 weeks ÷ 6.17 (Accounts receivable turnover ratio) = 8.4 weeks
Mattel’s customers averaged about 8.4 weeks to pay their bills.
Comparing this data with the previous year’s is a good way to see whether 
the situation is getting better or worse. If you use the same process to calcu-
late Mattel’s 2006 average credit collection period, you find the answer is 8.69 
weeks, meaning that the company took slightly longer in 2006 to collect than 
it did in 2007. To understand the significance of this, look at what’s happen-
ing with similar companies as well as what’s happening within the industry 
as a whole. It may be an internal company problem or it may be an industry-
wide problem related to changes in the economic situation.
Hasbro
 
 1. Calculate Hasbro’s average accounts receivable:
 
 ($654,789,000 + $556,287,000)/2 = $605,538,000
 
 2. Calculate Hasbro’s accounts receivable turnover ratio for 2007:
 
 $3,837,557,000 (Net sales) ÷ $605,538,000 (Average accounts receivable) 
= 6.34 times
 
 3. Calculate the average sales credit period:
 
 52 weeks ÷ 6.34 (Accounts receivable turnover ratio) = 8.21 weeks
Hasbro’s accounts receivable turned over at a rate slightly faster than 
Mattel’s.
Is that an improvement or a step backward for Hasbro? Using the 2006 
numbers, you find that Hasbro took 8.91 weeks to collect from its customers. 
That means that the company experienced an improvement in its accounts 
receivable collection.
What do the numbers mean?
The higher an accounts receivable turnover ratio is, the faster a company’s 
customers are paying their bills. Most times, the accounts receivable collec-
tion is directly related to the credit policies that the company sets. For exam-
ple, a high turnover ratio may look very good, but that ratio may also mean 
that the company’s credit policies are too strict and that it’s losing sales 
because few customers qualify for credit. A low accounts receivable turnover 
ratio usually means that a company’s credit policies are too loose, and the 
company may not be doing a good job of collecting on its accounts.

220
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
According to its balance sheets, Mattel wrote off $21.5 million in bad debt 
in 2007 and $19.4 million in 2006. Hasbro wrote off a lot more: $30.6 million in 
2007 and $27.7 million in 2006. Hasbro not only has slower-paying customers 
but also writes off more to bad debt.
Hasbro’s customers took an average of 8.21 weeks to pay their bills in 2007. 
Mattel’s customers took a bit longer at 8.4 weeks. Both companies wait about 
two months to get paid. The amount sitting in accounts receivable for Mattel 
increased by about $50 million between 2006 and 2007. Hasbro experienced 
an increase in accounts receivable of almost $100 million.
 
As an investor, you may want to call Hasbro’s investor-relations department 
to find out about its longer accounts receivable collections period and its 
bad-debt write-offs, as well as what the company is doing to improve these 
numbers.
Taking a Close Look at 
Customer Accounts
If you work inside a company and have responsibility for customer accounts, 
you get an internal financial report called the accounts receivable aging sched-
ule. This schedule summarizes the customers with outstanding accounts, the 
amounts they have outstanding, and the number of days that their bills are 
outstanding. Each company designs its own report, so they don’t all look the 
same. Check out Table 16-1 to see an example of an accounts receivable aging 
schedule.
Finding the right credit policy
Setting the right accounts receivable policy can 
have a major impact on sales. For example, a 
company could require customers to pay within 
ten days of billing or close the accounts. That 
may be too strict, and customers could end up 
having to walk out of the store because they 
can’t charge to the account. Another common 
credit policy that may be too strict is one that 
requires too high a salary level to qualify, forc-
ing too many customers to go elsewhere to buy 
the products they need.
Looking at the other side of the coin, a credit 
policy that’s too loose may allow customers 60 
days to pay their accounts. By the time the com-
pany realizes that it has a nonpaying customer, 
the customer may have already charged a large 
sum to the account. If the customer never pays 
the amount due, the company has to write it off 
as a bad debt.

Looking at the aging schedule, you can quickly see which companies are sig-
nificantly past due in their payments. Many firms begin cutting off customers 
whose accounts are more than 60 or 90 days past due. Other firms cut off 
customers when they’re more than 120 days past due. No set accounting rule 
dictates when to cut off customers who haven’t paid their bills; this decision 
depends on the accounting policies the company sets.
In the aging schedule example for ABC Company, the JK Company looks 
like its account needs some investigating. Although a company can carry 
past-due payments because of a dispute about a bill, after that dispute goes 
beyond 90 days, the company awaiting payment may put restrictions on 
the other company’s future purchases until its account gets cleaned up. HI 
Company seems to be another slow-paying company that may need a call 
from the accounts receivable manager or collections department.
Many times, a company salesperson makes the first contact with the cus-
tomer. If the salesperson is unsuccessful, the business initiates more severe 
collection methods, with the highest level being an outside collection agency. 
Companies with strong collection practices place a gentle reminder call when 
an account is more than 30 days late and push harder as the account is more 
and more past due.
When a business decides that it probably will never collect on an account, it 
writes off the account as a bad debt in the Allowance for Bad Debt Account. 
Each company sets its own policies about how quickly it writes off a bad 
debt. A company usually reviews its accounts for possible write-offs at the 
end of each accounting period. I talk more about accounts receivable and 
their impact on cash flow in Chapter 17.

Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
Finding the Accounts Payable Ratio
A company’s reputation for paying its bills is just as important as collect-
ing from its own customers. If a company develops the reputation of being 
a slow payer, it can have a hard time buying on credit. The situation can 
get even more serious if a company is late paying on its loans. In that case, 
the business can end up with increased interest rates while its credit rating 
drops lower and lower. I discuss the importance of a good credit rating in 
Chapter 21.
You can test a company’s bill-paying record with the accounts payable turn-
over ratio. In addition, you can check how many days a company takes to pay 
its bills by using the days in accounts payable ratio. Keep reading to find out 
how to calculate these ratios.
Calculating the ratio
The accounts payable turnover ratio measures how quickly a company pays 
its bills. You calculate this ratio by dividing the cost of goods sold (you find 
this figure on the income statement) by the average accounts payable (you 
find the accounts payable figures on the balance sheet).
Here’s the formula for the accounts payable turnover ratio:
Cost of goods sold ÷ Average accounts payable = Accounts payable turn-
over ratio
 I use Mattel’s and Hasbro’s income statements and balance sheets for 2007 to 
compare their accounts payable turnover ratios.
Mattel
 
 1. Find the average accounts payable:
 
 $375,882,000 (2006 accounts payable) + $441,145,000 (2007 accounts 
payable) ÷ 2 = $408,513,500 (Average accounts payable)
 
 2. Use that number to calculate Mattel’s accounts payable turnover 
ratio:
 
 $3,192,790,000 (Cost of goods sold) ÷ $408,513,500 (Average accounts 
payable) = 7.8 times
Mattel turns over its accounts payable 7.8 times per year.

223
 Chapter 16: Examining Cash Inflow and Outflow
Hasbro
 
1. Find the average accounts payable:
 
 $160,015,000 (2006 accounts payable) + $186,202,000 (2007 accounts 
payable) ÷ 2 = $173,108,500 (Average accounts payable)
 
2. Calculate Hasbro’s accounts payable turnover ratio:
 
 $1,576,621,000 (Cost of goods sold) ÷ $173,108,500 (Average accounts 
payable) = 9.1 times
Hasbro turns over its accounts payable 9.1 times per year, which is faster 
than Mattel.
What do the numbers mean?
The higher the accounts payable turnover ratio, the shorter the time between 
purchase and payment. A low turnover ratio may indicate that a company 
has a cash-flow problem.
 
Each industry has its own set of ratios. The only way to accurately judge how 
a company is doing paying its bills is to compare it with similar companies 
and the industry.
Determining the Number of Days 
in Accounts Payable
The number of days in accounts payable ratio lets you see the average length 
of time a company takes to pay its bills. If a company is taking longer to pay 
its bills each year, or if it pays its bills over a longer time period than other 
companies in its industry, it may be having a cash-flow problem. Also, if a 
company pays its bills slower than other companies in the same industry, 
that could be a problem, too.
Calculating the ratio
Use the following formula to calculate the number of days in accounts payable:
Average accounts payable ÷ Cost of goods sold × 360 days = Days in 
accounts payable

224
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
Note: The industry uses 360 days rather than a full year’s 365 to make this 
calculation based on an average 30-day month (30 × 12 = 360).
 I use Mattel’s and Hasbro’s balance sheets and income statements to find the 
number of days in accounts payable ratio. I don’t have to calculate average 
accounts payable because I already did so when I calculated the accounts 
payable turnover ratio (see the section “Finding the Accounts Payable Ratio,” 
earlier in this chapter).
Mattel
$408,513,500 (Average accounts payable) ÷ $3,192,790,000 (Cost of goods 
sold) × 360 = 46.1 days
Mattel takes about 46.1 days to pay its bills, or about 6.65 weeks, which is 
about 2 weeks less than it takes Mattel to collect from its customers — 8.4 
weeks, as the accounts receivable turnover ratio shows. Therefore, Mattel is 
receiving cash from its customers at a slower rate than it’s paying out in cash 
to its vendors and suppliers. This could be a factor in the need for short-term 
borrowings of $349 million, as shown on the balance sheet.
Hasbro
$173,108,500 (Average accounts payable) ÷ $1,576,621,000 (Cost of goods 
sold) × 360 = 39.5 days
Hasbro takes about 39.5 days, or 5.71 weeks, to pay its bills. Hasbro’s 
accounts receivable turnover ratio shows that its customers take slightly 
more than 8.21 weeks to pay their bills. Therefore, Hasbro must pay its bills 
more quickly than its customers pay theirs, which could cause a cash-flow 
problem.
What do the numbers mean?
 
If the number of days a company takes to pay its bills increases from year to 
year, this may be a red flag indicating a possible cash-flow problem. To know 
for certain what’s happening, compare the company with similar companies 
and the industry averages.
Just as accounts receivable prepares an aging schedule for customer 
accounts, companies also prepare internal financial reports for accounts pay-
able that show which companies they owe money, the amount they owe, and 
the number of days for which they’ve owed that amount.

225
 Chapter 16: Examining Cash Inflow and Outflow
Deciding Whether Discount Offers 
Make Good Financial Sense
One common way that companies encourage their customers to pay early is 
to offer them a discount. When a discount is offered, a customer (in this case, 
the company that must pay the bill) may see a term such as “2/10 net 30” or 
“3/10 net 60” at the top of its bill. “2/10 net 30” means that the customer can 
take a 2 percent discount if it pays the bill within 10 days; otherwise, it must 
pay the bill in full within 30 days. “3/10 net 60” means that if the customer 
pays the bill within 10 days, it can take a 3 percent discount; otherwise, it 
must pay the bill in full within 60 days.
 
Taking advantage of this discount saves customers money, but if a customer 
doesn’t have enough cash to take advantage of the discount, it needs to 
decide whether to use its credit line to do so. Comparing the interest saved by 
taking the discount with the interest a company must pay to borrow money 
to pay the bills early can help the company decide whether using credit to get 
the discount is a wise decision.
Calculating the annual interest rate
The formula for calculating the annual interest rate is:
[(% discount) ÷ (100 – % discount)] × (360 ÷ Number of days paid early) = 
Annual interest rate
I calculate the interest rate based on the early-payment terms I stated earlier.
For terms of 2/10 net 30
You first must calculate the number of days that the company would be 
paying the bill early. In this case, it’s paying the bill in 10 days instead of 30, 
which means it’s paying the bill 20 days earlier than the terms require. Now 
calculate the interest rate, using the annual interest rate formula:
[2 (% discount) ÷ 98 (100 – 2)] × [360 ÷ 20 (Number of days paid early)] = 
36.73%
That percentage is much higher than the interest rate the company may 
have to pay if it needs to use a credit line to meet cash-flow requirements, 
so taking advantage of the discount makes sense. For example, if a company 
has a bill for $100,000 and takes advantage of a 2 percent discount, it has to 

226
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
pay only $98,000, and it saves $2,000. Even if it must borrow the $98,000 at 
an annual rate of 10 percent, which would cost about $544 for 20 days, it still 
saves money.
For terms of 3/10 net 60
First, find the number of days the company would be paying the bill early. In 
this case, it’s paying the bill within 10 days, which means it’s paying 50 days 
earlier than the terms require. Next, calculate the interest rate, using this 
formula:
[3 (% discount) ÷ 97 (100 – 3)] × [360 ÷ 50 (Number of days paid early)] = 
22.27%
Paying 50 days earlier gives the company an annual interest rate of 22.27 per-
cent, which is likely higher than the interest rate it’d have to pay if it needed 
to use a credit line to meet cash-flow requirements. But the interest rate isn’t 
nearly as good as the terms of 2/10 net 30. A company with 3/10 net 60 terms 
will probably still choose to take the discount, as long as the cost of its credit 
lines carries an interest rate that’s lower than that available with these terms.
What do the numbers mean?
For most companies, taking advantage of these discounts makes sense 
as long as the annual interest rate calculated using this formula is higher 
than the one they must pay if they borrow money to pay the bill early. This 
becomes a big issue for companies because unless their inventory turns over 
very rapidly, 10 days probably isn’t enough time to sell all the inventory pur-
chased before they must pay the bill early. Their cash wouldn’t come from 
sales but, more likely, from borrowing.
If cash flow is tight, a company has to borrow funds using its credit line to 
take advantage of the discount. For example, if the company buys $100,000 
in goods to be sold at terms of 2/10 net 30, it can save $2,000 by paying 
within 10 days. If the company hasn’t sold all the goods, it has to borrow 
the $100,000 for 20 days, which wouldn’t be necessary if it didn’t try to take 
advantage of the discount. I assume that the annual interest on the compa-
ny’s credit line is 9 percent. Does it make sense to borrow the money?
The company would need to pay the additional interest on the amount bor-
rowed only for 20 additional days (because that’s the number of days the 
company must pay the bill early). Calculating the annual interest of 9 percent 
of $100,000 equals $9,000, or $25 per day. Borrowing that money would cost 
an additional $500 ($25 times 20 days). So even though the company must 
borrow the money to pay the bill early, the $2,000 discount would still save it 
$1,500 more than the $500 interest cost involved in borrowing the money.

M
anagers sometimes face a shortage of cash to pay the bills, and they 
need to find ways to fix the problem. They can use different strategies 
to get their hands on cash quickly when running a business.
In this chapter, I review the pros and cons of the possible fixes available 
when a manager finds a red flag about a company’s cash flow.
Slowing Down Bill Payments
Short on cash? Well, maybe you can just let your bills slide. It may not be 
the most responsible policy, but sometimes doing so can get a company 
through a fiscal rough patch — as long as its suppliers are relatively patient. 
When businesses buy on credit and don’t have to pay cash upon receipt of 
the goods, this is called trade financing. Often, businesses must pay for those 
goods within 30, 60, or 90 days. When cash gets tight, one of the first strate-
gies many small-business owners (and even some large corporations) use is 
to pay their bills more slowly, and sometimes even pay them late, to make it 
through a cash crunch.

228
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
This practice is known as stretching accounts payable or riding the trade. Some 
companies use this strategy as long as their suppliers and vendors toler-
ate the late payments — in other words, until they threaten nondelivery of 
goods. The primary advantage of this plan is that the manager or business 
owner doesn’t need to look for a way to borrow additional money to pay 
operating expenses. The big disadvantage is that companies can build bad 
reputations among their suppliers and vendors and are less likely to get 
trade financing in the future.
Paying bills early can be an even bigger advantage for companies than delay-
ing payments for as long as possible. In Chapter 16, I talk about how much 
money companies can save by taking advantage of trade discounts rather 
than paying bills on time. Although slowing bill payment may be the easiest 
way to deal with a cash-flow problem, it’s the option with the least advan-
tages and the greatest potential for hurting business operations in the long 
term, especially when vendors and suppliers finally decide to stop providing 
the necessary goods.
 
When reading a financial report, you can test to see whether a company may 
be choosing a bill-paying-delay strategy by calculating its accounts payable 
turnover ratio (see Chapter 16). If the turnover of accounts payable is slowing 
down from one year to the next, that may be a sign that the company has a 
cash-flow problem.
Speeding Up Collecting 
Accounts Receivables
If a company owes more money than it has, clearly, it needs to bring in more 
money. A business whose cash is tight often brings in more money by speed-
ing up the collection of its accounts receivables — money that customers who 
bought on credit or people who borrowed from the company owe. To collect 
the money, the company must make changes to its credit policies, focusing 
on one or more of these five basic variables:
 
✓ Credit period: Companies can change the length of time they give their 
customers to pay for their purchases. A liberal credit period can give 
customers 60 or 90 days to pay, whereas a conservative credit period 
can allow as few as 10 days.
 
✓ Credit standards: In times of trouble, the company can loosen the poli-
cies it uses to determine a customer’s credit eligibility. For example, a 
company that requires customers to have an income level of at least 
$50,000 to get a $1,000 credit line may decide to allow customers to get 

229
 Chapter 17: How Companies Keep the Cash Flowing
the $1,000 credit line with an income of only $30,000. This policy change 
increases the credit-customer base and allows more people to buy on 
credit; however, the change can also lead to more customers who have 
difficulty paying their bills.
 
✓ Collection period: Companies with strict collection policies can begin 
contacting slow payers or prohibiting them from making further 
purchases, even if their account is just a few days late. Other com-
panies wait 60 days or longer before they follow up on late accounts. 
Shortening the credit period can get more cash in the door quickly, but 
this policy can also cause customers to buy fewer products or to move 
their business to another store.
 
✓ Discounts: Companies can encourage their customers to pay their bills 
earlier by using a discount program. I discuss using discount programs 
in greater detail in Chapter 16. For example, a company can offer cus-
tomers a 2 percent discount for paying their bills within 10 days of 
receiving the bill, but if the customers wait 30 days to pay their bills, the 
company expects the payment in full. Deciding to add or change a dis-
count program may speed up cash collections, but it lowers the profit 
margin on sales because these discounts bring in less revenues.
 
✓ Fees and late payments: Companies must decide whether they want 
to charge late fees or interest to customers who don’t pay on time. 
Companies with a strict collection process charge a late fee one day 
after a bill’s due date and start adding interest for each day that the pay-
ment is late. Companies with a liberal collection policy don’t charge late 
fees or add interest charges to late payers. To encourage on-time pay-
ment, a company could charge a $25 late fee when a bill is paid ten days 
after it’s due. This strategy encourages slow payers to pay more quickly, 
but it can also chase customers away if one of the company’s competi-
tors doesn’t impose late fees or interest charges.
Before a company that’s trying to speed up its incoming cash flow makes any 
changes to its credit policy, it must look at a number of financial variables to 
determine the long-term impact the change may have on its sales and profit 
margin. Stricter accounts receivable policies are likely to honk off customers 
and increase staff workload, whereas looser policies may encourage more 
sales but result in more bad debt that a company has to write off.
To fully assess the possible ramifications of the change, top executives 
must discuss with managers in the sales, marketing, accounting, and finance 
departments the potential impact the changes in credit policy may have. For 
instance, any change in credit policy increases the staff’s workload. When a 
company eases its credit standards and increases the number of customers 
who can buy on credit, it needs more staff to manage its accounts receivable 
and keep track of all the new customer accounts. If the company decides to 

230
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
make its credit standards stricter and require a more time-consuming credit 
check before establishing new customer accounts, it has to hire more staff 
or an outside vendor to do those credit checks. Either way, a stricter policy 
costs more money and may drive customers away.
 
So before they change their credit policies, companies must carefully assess 
the potential cash-inflow change and potential staff costs, as well as the 
impact a policy change may have on customers. Though at first glance the 
change may look like a good idea for improving cash flow, its long-term impact 
may actually reduce sales or profits.
 
You can test whether a company is having problems collecting from its cus-
tomers by calculating its accounts receivable turnover ratio. To find out how 
to calculate this ratio, turn to Chapter 16.
Borrowing on Receivables
Rather than delving into the complicated realm of credit-policy changes, 
many companies use a receivables securitization program. In this case, I’m 
talking about accounts receivable, which include all accounts of customers 
who buy on credit. In this type of program, a company sells its receivables 
to an outside party — usually a bank or other financial institution — to get 
immediate cash, and as the receivables come in from customers, the com-
pany repays the financial institution. Most companies retain the servicing 
rights of the receivables, which means that they continue to collect from cus-
tomers and receive servicing fees for administering that collection.
Two standard options for selling receivables are
 
✓ Selling the receivable for less than it’s worth: For example, a pro-
gram’s terms may dictate that the company gets 92 cents for each 
dollar of receivables, which, in essence, is equivalent to an 8 percent 
interest rate.
 
✓ Paying interest as if the company had taken out a loan secured by a 
physical asset, such as a building: For example, the company’s credit 
terms for the securitization program may set up an annual interest rate 
of 8 percent. But for customers who pay their bills within 30 days, the 
amount of interest the company actually pays on the accounts receiv-
able loan is only 1/12 of 8 percent for the one month they borrowed the 
money while waiting for a customer to pay.
In addition, companies usually have to pay upfront charges of 2 to 5 percent 
to set up the program.

231
 Chapter 17: How Companies Keep the Cash Flowing
 
The biggest advantage of using a receivables securitization program is that 
the company has immediate access to cash. The biggest disadvantage is that 
the company ends up with less than the full value of the receivables when it 
collects from its customers because of discounts or any interest paid on those 
receivables.
 
You can find out whether a company uses a securitization program by read-
ing the notes to the financial statements. If a company does use this type of 
financing, it will include in the notes information about money it has borrowed 
on a short-term basis, which is called short-term financing.
Reducing Inventory
Companies in a cash-flow crunch sometimes decide to reduce their on-hand 
inventory. Doing so certainly reduces the amount of cash that must be laid 
out to pay for that inventory, but it also can result in lost sales if customers 
come in to buy a product and don’t find it on the shelves. Customers may 
then be more likely to go to a competitor than wait for the product to arrive.
Many companies use a just-in-time inventory system, which means the product 
shows up at a company’s door just before it’s needed. To set up this type 
of system, a company must know how many sales it normally makes over a 
period of time and how long it takes to get new products. Then the company 
calculates when it must order new products so it receives them just before 
the shelves become empty. This system reduces the inventory a company 
has to store in its warehouses and the cash payments it must make to sup-
pliers and vendors for the products it purchases. When done correctly for 
a product that moves quickly off the shelves, the system works well — the 
company may even sell the product and collect cash before it needs to pay 
the bills. This strategy certainly helps a company manage its cash flow and 
reduce the amount of cash it must borrow to pay for inventory.
The big disadvantage of using a just-in-time inventory system is that esti-
mates are sometimes wrong. For example, a company decides when and 
how much it needs to reorder based on historical sales data. If a product’s 
popularity increases dramatically before the company can adjust its 
inventory-purchasing process, store shelves may be empty for days before 
new products arrive — just when the public is rushing to get the product. As 
a result, the company loses sales to a competitor who still has the product 
on its shelves. Any cash that customers would have paid for those goods that 
weren’t available is cash that’s permanently lost to the company.
Other times, a just-in-time inventory system breaks down because a problem 
occurs in the supply chain. For example, if a customer orders a product from 
a company in Singapore and a major storm shuts down the manufacturing 

232
Part IV: Understanding How Companies Optimize Operations 
plant for a week or more, product deliveries will be delayed. The company 
selling the product may be left with empty shelves because the inventory on 
hand ran out and the new inventory won’t show up for a few weeks, until the 
manufacturing plant can restore its operations and begin shipping products 
again. This could result in a lot of lost cash to the company because custom-
ers would be forced to buy the goods elsewhere.
 
Using financial reports, you can test how quickly a company’s inventory turns 
over by calculating the inventory turnover ratio, which I discuss in Chapter 
15. However, you won’t be able to tell whether the company regularly runs out 
of products on its shelves by reading the financial reports. You can determine 
that issue only by periodically stopping by stores to find out.
 
Although reducing inventory does save the company cash upfront that it 
would normally pay to buy that inventory, inventory reduction can actually 
result in a loss of sales and less cash in the long run if customers have to go 
elsewhere to find the products they want. Inventory reduction makes sense 
only when the company believes the product is sitting too long on the shelves 
and customer interest in buying the product is low.
Getting Cash More Quickly
The most flexible way for a company to keep its cash moving is to have 
numerous options in place so it can borrow cash when needed or speed up 
cash receipts. Companies can choose from among the following options to 
keep their cash flowing:
 
✓ Credit cards: Credit cards can be a great way for a company to conserve 
cash and pay bills. Banks offer a range of credit cards, debit cards, and 
other short-term cash options to help companies maintain cash flow. 
Banks can put controls on these cards to ensure that a company’s 
employees don’t abuse them.
 
✓ Lines of credit: Lines of credit allow companies to access cash as 
needed. The bank or financial institution sets a maximum amount of 
credit that the company can borrow and gives the company checks or 
allows it to transfer cash into a checking account.
 
• An unsecured line of credit: This type of credit isn’t backed by the 
company’s assets, which means that if the company can’t pay back 
the loan, the financial institution can’t seize the company’s assets.
 
• A secured line of credit: This type of credit is backed by the com-
pany’s assets, so the bank can foreclose and take possession of the 
asset that backs the line of credit if the company fails to pay back 
the loan.

233
 Chapter 17: How Companies Keep the Cash Flowing
 
✓ Lockbox services: Companies can set up these services with a bank so 
that they pay their bills directly to the bank, using a lockbox; then the 
bank deposits the money directly into the company’s account. This 
method can speed up cash flow because the bank deposits the funds 
upon receipt, eliminating the day or longer it normally takes for checks 
accepted by the company to be processed in-house and then deposited 
in the bank. However, electronic banking and bill paying has eliminated 
the need for many lockbox services.
 
✓ Electronic bill payment: Many businesses allow customers to pay their 
bills online and send in bills by e-mail to speed up the cash-collection 
process. When they get money from customers more quickly, companies 
speed up their incoming cash flow.
 
✓ Merchant services: A firm can get access to money much more quickly 
by using electronic payment systems when accepting credit and debit 
cards. Most stores now use electronic payment systems rather than 
paper copies when accepting credit cards. Instead of waiting for paper 
transactions to yield cash — which sometimes occurs days later — 
companies can use electronic payment systems to access cash within 
minutes.
 
✓ Small Business Administration loans: Small businesses can get low-
interest loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration 
(SBA) to assist with cash-flow problems, which helps a small-business 
owner get approval for the needed funds.

o public company operates in a vacuum. Instead, 
every public company must answer to its share-
holders and lenders as well as to government overseers 
and financial analysts. On top of all that, auditors must 
certify that what a company reports is correct. All these 
parties play some role in why annual reports are pre-
sented the way they are today. In this part, I discuss some 
of the key outside entities a company must answer to. I 
also take a look at the ways some companies play games 
with the numbers they report.

M
ost readers of financial reports don’t work for the company whose 
reports they’re reading, and therefore, they must depend on the 
truthfulness of the company’s management in reporting its financial state-
ments. Can you depend on the numbers you see?
The question is valid, especially considering the corporate scandals that 
have rocked Wall Street since the collapse of Enron in December 2001. (To 
find out more about why the world’s largest electricity and natural gas trader 
filed for bankruptcy, see Chapter 24.) The Enron scandal — followed by finan-
cial reporting scandals at other major corporations such as MCI WorldCom, 
Adelphia, and many others — led investors to be wary about the numbers 
companies put in their financial reports.
In this chapter, I explore how third parties get involved to keep company 
records on the up and up.
Inspecting Audits and Auditors
Company outsiders can’t be sure the information they see is an accurate 
reflection of the company’s financial situation unless a disinterested third 
party reviews the company’s operations and financial statements and deter-
mines that the reports are free of fraud and misrepresentation. Called an 
audit, this process is crucial for verifying the accuracy of a firm’s financial 
reports.

238
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
Every public company that sells stock on one of the public markets must hire 
an independent certified public accountant (CPA) to audit its financial state-
ments. Investors, financial institutions, vendors, suppliers, and anyone else 
who depends on knowledge about a company’s financial well-being expect 
these audited statements to be truthful. I talk about the process of auditing 
a company’s books in the following sections, and I discuss the process of 
taking a company public in Chapter 3.
Looking for mistakes
Even when a company has no desire to mislead investors and others, 
honest mistakes can happen. Sometimes, errors occur because a company’s 
accounting system is flawed or isn’t capable of handling changing company 
conditions, especially when a business is growing rapidly. Other times, a 
company’s accountants present wrong numbers because they don’t have a 
good understanding of the latest accounting principles related to the presen-
tation of some of the numbers.
 
Fraudulent financial reporting results when management decides to deliber-
ately distort the numbers to make the company’s financial results look better 
than they actually are. Sometimes companies withhold negative information 
to avoid an investor backlash and a drop in stock value. Companies often 
deceive without the knowledge of the auditors, but sometimes the auditors 
permit deception by bending the rules. Turn to Chapter 23 to get the dirt on 
fraudulent financial reporting.
Meeting Mr. or Ms. Auditor
To become a licensed CPA, candidates must complete extensive training 
that includes having at least a bachelor’s degree with a major emphasis in 
accounting, passing a national CPA exam, and showing that they know how 
to work with the information in the real world by satisfying work-experience 
requirements that vary by state.
To keep a current license, CPAs must take continuing education courses each 
year. The amount of time devoted to continuing education varies by state.
 
Each state has a board of accountancy that monitors the activities of its CPAs. 
The state boards have the right to revoke or suspend a CPA’s license if he 
violates the laws, regulations, or ethics governing CPAs. If a CPA’s license is 
revoked or suspended, she can no longer serve her clients as an independent 
CPA unless she gets her license reinstated.

239
 Chapter 18: Finding Out How Companies Find Errors: The Auditing Process
CPAs don’t just audit financial reports. They also provide tax planning 
services and consulting to help a company set up its accounting system, 
develop the needed information systems to manage its accounting functions, 
evaluate its business, and even assist with personal financial planning. Some 
CPAs develop other specialties, such as production control and efficiency, to 
provide additional services to clients.
 
In order to audit a company’s financial statements, a CPA must be in public 
practice and must not be an employee of any organization other than a CPA 
firm. A CPA’s independence from the companies he serves is critical to assure 
an independent report.
Examining Records: The 
Role of the Auditor
Most major corporations are required by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) to have their financial reports checked by a third party, 
called an auditor, to be sure the reports truthfully portray the company’s 
financial health.
Some partnerships that aren’t corporations choose to pay for an audit, but 
they aren’t required to do so. They do it primarily because the banks or 
financial institutions that loan them money request it. They may also choose 
to pay for an audit if several partners are involved in the company but only 
one of the partners runs its day-to-day operations. The partners who aren’t 
involved in the day-to-day activities may want to have the books audited by 
a CPA to be sure the active partner is accurately reporting the company’s 
financial activities to them.
If you’ve worked in a business, you know how nervous some managers 
become when auditors show up at their door. An audit isn’t a complete sur-
prise to a business, however. Auditors sit down with top management and 
an internal audit committee to discuss the audit process and to schedule the 
audit for a time that’s least disruptive to the business. For example, a retail 
company certainly doesn’t want auditors checking out its stores during the 
end-of-year holiday rush.
Auditors do more than just review financial statements, as you can see in the 
next three sections, which describe other elements of the auditing process.

240
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
Preliminary review
Before auditors show up at a business’s door, they meet with key executives 
and board members from the audit committee to discuss the audit’s scope 
and objectives. For example, an audit may include a complete review of the 
company’s operations or it may focus on just one aspect of the operation, 
such as collections from customers. The objectives of a full audit usually are 
to validate the company’s financial statements. The objectives of an audit for 
one particular part of an operation usually involve reviewing the operation’s 
efficiency or finding possible internal control problems that can lead to theft 
or fraud.
After the scope of the audit is determined, the auditors meet with key manag-
ers to gather information about internal accounting processes, to evaluate 
existing controls, and to plan how the audit will be conducted inside the 
company.
The internal accounting manager responsible for the audit then sends a letter 
to the staff members involved, announcing the audit and who’s been assigned 
to do the audit. In the first meeting with accounting staff, the auditors review 
the available resources — including personnel, facilities, and funds — that 
are allocated to the audit. During these initial meetings, those involved iden-
tify areas of special concern.
Auditors then meet with the departments being audited, which may include 
all departments in a company or just a few that are directly involved in the 
issues being investigated. The auditors survey key personnel and review 
financial reports, files, and other information deemed important to the audit. 
The auditors also review each department’s internal control structure. This 
review helps the auditors determine where holes are in internal control pro-
cesses and helps them identify the key areas that need to be tested in the 
field when auditing specific stores or other locations that the company owns.
After all the facts are determined in the preliminary review, the auditors 
design the audit process that’s used in the field to collect needed information 
and to meet the objectives set out in the initial meetings with top executives 
and the board of directors.
Fieldwork
Auditors perform fieldwork when they visit a company’s individual offices 
and locations to determine whether the internal controls discussed at the 
company’s top levels are actually being implemented properly. For example, 

241
 Chapter 18: Finding Out How Companies Find Errors: The Auditing Process
if a business requires a certain type of coding when an order is charged to a 
customer’s account and that coding is not being used consistently, some cus-
tomers may be getting merchandise without getting billed.
In the field, auditors watch a company’s employees carry out certain tasks 
to be sure that they’re performing them correctly. Additionally, auditors 
review files to be sure all the paperwork is in order to back up reports sent 
to the central corporate offices. For example, if the company requires a man-
ager’s signature before a customer is given a refund, the auditor randomly 
reviews company refund records to be sure that the signature process is 
being followed.
Although the top manager at a location likely knows when the auditors will 
arrive, the rest of the staff is usually surprised by their arrival. Any findings 
during the fieldwork become part of the draft audit report.
After the auditors complete a preliminary review of the specific location with 
the top managers, they randomly review various records to be sure that 
employees are following internal control procedures. For example, if an audi-
tor is auditing a bank’s operations, she wants to know whether employees 
are following the bank’s procedures for approving a loan. She likely checks 
random files for loans to be sure all needed approvals are in place.
 
The type of fieldwork that may be required depends on the business type 
and the audit’s scope. Auditors for a bank will visit offices in the corporate 
headquarters, as well as bank branches, to complete their fieldwork. Auditors 
for a corporation with retail stores will do their fieldwork in the corporate 
headquarters, regional headquarters, and individual stores. If the scope of the 
audit is just to review the customer order and bill-paying process, the field-
work may take place only in the corporate accounts receivable section.
As the auditors work in the field, they discuss any significant discrepancies 
with top management at the field locations. Auditors often work with manage-
ment to determine how best to resolve any problems before they complete 
the final audit report. If a problem can be easily resolved, they can do so 
orally. If the problems are more serious or complex, auditors compile written 
reports and circulate them to managers in the field, corporate executives, 
and board members. These reports summarize the auditors’ field findings, 
identifying problems and making recommendations, before the auditors turn 
in their final report.
 
Most companies work to fix problems internally to avoid being reported to 
their outside stakeholders: investors, creditors, employees, vendors, and sup-
pliers. If you’re a member of top management or the audit committee of the 
board of directors, you usually find out about problems long before they’re 
detailed in the business press or on the front page of the newspaper, as some 

242
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
company scandals are. Audit reports from fieldwork aren’t released publicly, 
so when scandals do make it to the front pages, it’s usually after a whistle-
blower comes forward or the SEC announces an investigation.
Audit report
After auditors complete their fieldwork, they start working on their audit 
report, which presents the audit findings and discusses recommendations for 
improvement. Auditors review their findings with top management and dis-
cuss any disagreement that managers in the field may have with the findings. 
Managers can then comment on the findings before auditors submit a final 
report to the operating managers, top executives, and board of directors. 
Managers are usually given an opportunity to submit their own comments in 
areas of discrepancy.
If the auditor concludes that changes need to be made within the corpora-
tion, managers submit their plans to improve processes based on the audi-
tor’s recommendations. If, for some reason, managers disagree with the 
auditor, they have to explain in the final report why they disagree and what 
they plan to do to fix the problem.
Filling the GAAP
Although a CPA’s primary role as an auditor is to make sure that a company’s 
financial statements are presented fairly and accurately, he must also ensure 
that the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are followed.
GAAP help a company determine the amount of financial information it must 
disclose and help it measure its assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and 
equity. That information makes up the financial statements, including the bal-
ance sheet (see Chapter 6), the income statement (see Chapter 7), and the 
statement of cash flows (see Chapter 8). The GAAP, which fill bookshelves in 
an accountant’s office, are highly technical explanations of how a company 
must report the financial information on each line item of these financial 
statements, such as how to calculate the value of each asset, liability, or 
equity on the balance sheet, or how to report revenue and expenses on the 
income statement.

243
 Chapter 18: Finding Out How Companies Find Errors: The Auditing Process
Accounting standards: Four 
important qualities
The primary accounting-standard-setting body in the U.S. is the Financial 
Accounting Standards Board, or FASB (check out the sidebar “Exploring the 
FASB”). It’s responsible for developing the GAAP, as well as updating the 
already developed GAAP to reflect changes in the ways companies operate. 
These changes occur as new ways of doing business become commonplace 
in the business world.
 
The FASB specifies four characteristics of useful accounting information that 
companies need to strive for in their financial reports. These four characteris-
tics form the basis for designing the technical GAAP requirements:
 
✓ Relevance: Relevant information includes information needed to fore-
cast a company’s future earnings or confirm or correct prior expecta-
tions. The information must also be timely, which means it must be 
available to business decision-makers before it loses the power to influ-
ence decisions. For example, if companies had to report their earnings 
only every five years, the information wouldn’t be relevant to most com-
pany outsiders, who need to make decisions about the company more 
frequently than that.
 
✓ Reliability: In order for accounting information to be considered reli-
able, it must be verifiable, factual, and accurate. The information must 
also be neutral. In other words, a company can’t cherry-pick the infor-
mation it wants outsiders to see and hide any bad news that it doesn’t 
want to report.
 
✓ Comparability: Not all companies must collect and present the informa-
tion in exactly the same way. Some variation is allowed in accounting 
methods, but a company must disclose what accounting methods it 
uses. For example, as I discuss in Chapter 15, numerous methods are 
available for tracking inventory, so companies must state which method 
they use. This requirement makes comparing results from company to 
company easier.
 
✓ Consistency: The company must use the same accounting principles 
and methods from year to year so that financial report readers can 
compare results with those of previous years. If a company changes 
the accounting principles or methods its financial reports are based on, 
it must tell the financial report readers about the change and provide 
information regarding how that change impacts previously reported 
financial results.

244
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
Changing principles: More work 
for the FASB
GAAP aren’t set in stone. As business needs and the way companies do busi-
ness change, so must the principles. The auditing industry is the most sensi-
tive to emerging trends in day-to-day reporting practices, so it tends to be 
the profession that most frequently alerts the FASB to the need for new prin-
ciples or changes in old principles. In addition to changes noticed in the field, 
new legislation or regulatory decisions can be the sources of needed changes 
in the GAAP.
After hearing from all sources about emerging issues, the FASB decides what 
technical issues it will add to its agenda to change the GAAP. The board 
looks at a number of factors when deciding whether an issue is worth being 
changed:
Exploring the FASB
The FASB was first designated as the organiza-
tion responsible for establishing standards of 
financial accounting and reporting in 1973. Both 
the SEC and the American Institute of Certified 
Public Accounts (AICPA) recognize the FASB 
as the authority for setting the standards for 
financial reports.
The FASB board is made up of seven members 
who serve full time for five-year terms and are 
eligible for one additional five-year term. To 
serve on the FASB, board members must sever 
all connections with firms or institutions they’ve 
been involved with before the appointment.
The FASB’s mission is to establish and improve 
standards of financial accounting and reporting. 
The board is responsible for the guidance and 
education of the public, which includes issuers, 
auditors, and users of financial information. The 
FASB carries out its mission by
 ✓ Seeking to improve the usefulness of financial 
reporting by focusing on four characteristics: 
relevance, reliability, comparability, and 
consistency.
 ✓ Maintaining current standards that reflect 
changes in the methods of doing business 
and in the economic environment.
 ✓ Reviewing promptly any significant areas 
where financial reporting may be defi-
cient and improving the reporting situation 
through its standard-setting process.
 ✓ Promoting the international convergence of 
accounting standards to improve financial 
reporting.
 ✓ Improving the common understanding of 
the nature and purpose of financial report 
information.
You can access information about FASB work-
ing projects and accounting standards online at 
www.fasb.org.

245
 Chapter 18: Finding Out How Companies Find Errors: The Auditing Process
 
✓ Pervasiveness of issue: The board determines how troublesome the 
issue is to users, preparers, auditors, and others. It also considers 
whether the practice being questioned impacts many different kinds of 
companies and whether the issue is likely to be transitory or to persist 
for a long time. Only those issues that are likely to persist over time are 
considered for further action.
 
✓ Alternative solutions: The board considers which of the one or more 
alternative solutions will improve financial reporting in terms of the key 
characteristics of relevance, reliability, consistency, and comparability.
 
✓ Technical feasibility: The board determines whether a technically 
sound solution can be developed or whether the project under consid-
eration must wait for another issue to be decided as part of a different 
project also underway. If another issue must be decided first, the board 
holds off working on the issue.
 
✓ Practical consequences: The board weighs whether the improved 
accounting solution is likely to be generally accepted and to what extent 
addressing a particular issue may cause others, such as the SEC or 
Congress, to act.
 
✓ Convergence possibilities: The board determines whether its action on 
the issue will lead to the elimination of significant differences in stan-
dards or practices between the U.S. and other countries, with resulting 
improvement in the quality of U.S. standards.
 
✓ Cooperative opportunities: The board considers whether there’s inter-
national support by one or more other standard-setters for undertaking 
the project jointly or through other cooperative means with the FASB.
 
✓ Resources: The board must determine whether adequate resources and 
expertise are available within the FASB or whether the FASB can lever-
age off the work of other standard-setters.
If the FASB decides it wants to work on an issue, it begins a long process 
that can take years before the issue is added to the GAAP. This process 
includes board meetings that are open to the public, exposure drafts cir-
culated for public comment, and additional board meetings and comment 
periods, if necessary.

Y
ou’ve probably heard all kinds of complaints about the government 
bureaucracy involved in, and the paperwork required for, corporate 
reporting. Most corporate executives and managers responsible for answer-
ing to the government don’t find pleasure in reading through government 
reporting requirements. This stuff doesn’t make great bedtime reading, 
although some people do find these requirements good to read when they’re 
having a hard time falling asleep — boring!
No matter how boring and frustrating corporate staff may find these govern-
ment requirements, corporations have no way to bypass the rules. Actually, 
as a company outsider who needs to know what’s happening behind closed 
doors, you should be glad such stringent regulations exist. Without them, 
you’d have no idea whether you’re getting accurate reports about what the 
company does and what its growth prospects are.
 
If you’re researching a company because you’re considering investing in it or 
have already invested, you shouldn’t depend solely on the information the 
company gives you in its annual and quarterly reports. Visit the Securities 
and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Edgar Web site (www.sec.gov/edgar.
shtml) and read the details in the company’s public reports filed with the 
government.

248
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
 
I find that one of the best ways to track news about particular companies and 
new SEC filings is by listing a mock portfolio on one of the financial news Web 
sites, such as Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com). Any news or SEC filing 
is linked to the opening page of each stock. An asterisk designates when some-
thing new is reported about a stock in your mock portfolio, so you know when 
new information about the company has been posted.
Checking Out the 10-Q
Every quarter, corporations must report their financial results to the SEC 
(which has primary responsibility for the U.S. government’s oversight of 
public corporations) on Form 10-Q. The 10-Q isn’t a blank form that needs to 
be filled in. Instead, the SEC provides general instructions for the information 
that must be included and the format in which it must be presented. The 10-Q 
includes two parts.
Financial information
The financial information required for Part I of Form 10-Q isn’t much different 
from that required for the annual reports. Four items are required:
 
✓ Item 1 — Financial statements: Included in this section are the balance 
sheet (see Chapter 6), income statement (turn to Chapter 7), and state-
ment of cash flows (discussed in detail in Chapter 8).
 
✓ Item 2 — Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition 
and results of operations: This section includes a discussion and analy-
sis by management of the company’s liquidity, resources, and opera-
tions, its financial condition, and any changes that occurred during the 
quarter. I discuss the requirements for this section in greater detail in 
Chapter 5.
 
✓ Item 3 — Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk: 
This section includes discussion about external conditions that impact 
the company’s market, including the impact of inflation, economic 
conditions that could impact revenue, and competitive forces that may 
impact the company’s future results.
 
✓ Item 4 — Controls and procedures: This section requires management 
to disclose the controls and procedures the company has in place to 
protect its assets and the accuracy of its financial reports. I discuss 
this requirement in greater detail in the section “Investigating Internal 
Controls.”

Other critical matters
Companies report other important corporation matters that don’t fall under 
the topic of financial results in Part II of the 10-Q. This section contains sev-
eral possible items, but companies need to include only the items relevant to 
the particular quarter being reported. Following are the items in Part II:
 
✓ Item 1 — Legal proceedings: Events involving legal proceedings must 
be reported only during the quarter in which they first became material 
and in any future quarters when information related to material develop-
ments is available. Material developments are proceedings that may have 
a significant impact on a company’s finances.
 
✓ Item 1A – Risk factors: This section reviews the risks disclosed related 
to a company’s business, financial condition, and cash flows, as well as 
results of operations that may be materially adversely affected by any 
of these risks. The trading price of the company’s common stock may 
decline due to these risks.
 
✓ Item 2 — Changes in securities and use of proceeds: Anytime a corpo-
ration makes changes to the rights of holders of its registered securities 
(stocks and bonds sold on the public markets), the changes must be 
reported. These changes include changes to working capital and restric-
tions and limitations on the payment of dividends.
 
✓ Item 3 — Defaults upon senior securities: If a company defaults on its 
payment of principal or interest on company debt and the default isn’t 
cured within 30 days, the company must report it. The only type of 
default that doesn’t need to be reported is one between a parent com-
pany and one of its subsidiaries.
 
✓ Item 4 — Submissions of matters to a vote of security holders: Anytime 
a company takes a vote of the shareholders during the quarter being 
reported, it must report the date and place of the meeting, as well as 
whether the meeting was annual or special. The company must give a 
brief description of all matters voted on at the meeting and also detail 
the votes cast for or against and report the number of abstentions and 
nonvoters. If the company elects directors at the meeting, it must list 
those elected, as well as those who remain on the board and their terms 
of office.
 
✓ Item 5 — Other information: This item is a catchall for any issue 
that hasn’t been previously reported on Form 8-K but needs to be 
reported. I discuss the requirements of Form 8-K in a later section called 
“Uncovering the Ways Companies Keep in Compliance.” A company 
doesn’t have to file an 8-K for an issue reported on a 10-Q.

250
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
 
✓ Item 6 — Exhibits and reports on Form 8-K: Any compliance reports 
filed during the quarter must be attached as an exhibit (additional pages 
that provide this information) on the 10-Q.
Introducing the 10-K
Form 10-K is the official annual report form required by the SEC, and it’s the 
report you’re most likely to see as part of the glossy annual report that com-
panies send out to investors. The 10-K includes four parts, which I discuss in 
this section.
Business operations
In Part I of the 10-K, you find the following details about business operations:
 
✓ Item 1 — Business: This section describes the company’s operations 
with discussions about product lines, major classes of customers, indus-
tries in which the company operates, and details about domestic and 
foreign operations. “Risk factors” (Item 1A) and “Unresolved staff com-
ments” (Item 1B) are also discussed in this section.
 
✓ Item 2 — Properties: This section describes the property the company 
owns.
 
✓ Item 3 — Legal proceedings: This section discusses any legal proceed-
ings the company is involved in and the material impact the lawsuits 
may have on the company.
 
✓ Item 4 — Submission of matters to a vote of security holders: Any mat-
ters voted on by the shareholders are detailed in this section.
Financial data
Part II of the 10-K includes information related to any matters that impact the 
company’s financial health. In this part, you find the following items:
 
✓ Item 5 — Market for registrant’s common equity, related shareholder 
matters, and issuer purchases of equity securities: In this section, you 
find information about the market for the company’s stock, which stock 
exchange the company is traded on, the quarterly low and high stock 

251
 Chapter 19: Digging into Government Regulations
prices for the past two years, the approximate number of shareholders, 
the amount paid in cash dividends for the past two years, and discus-
sion of any restrictions on the company’s ability to pay future dividends.
 
✓ Item 6 — Selected financial data: In this section, you find a five-year 
summary of selected financial data, including net sales, income or loss 
from continuing operations (company activities that go on each year to 
make and sell products or services) on a per-share basis, total assets, 
long-term debt, cash dividends per share of common stock, and informa-
tion about any redeemable preferred stock (stock that can be converted 
to debt).
 
✓ Item 7 — Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condi-
tion and results of operations: In this section, management discusses 
the company’s financial condition and any changes to its condition 
that have occurred in the past year. Management also discusses the 
results of operations and analyzes the company’s liquidity, resources, 
and operations. If any major changes in the financial statements took 
place during the year being reported, the company also discusses those 
changes in this section.
 
✓ Item 7A — Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk: 
This section is where you find management’s discussion of external 
economic factors that impacted the company’s operations, such as the 
effects of inflation. You also find discussion about the company’s com-
petition and any major risks to the industry as a whole.
 
✓ Item 8 — Financial statements and supplementary data: Here’s where 
you find the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash 
flows, as well as all supplementary information for these documents, 
such as the notes to the financial statements (see Chapter 9) and the 
auditors’ report (see Chapter 5).
 
✓ Item 9 — Changes in and disagreements with accountants on account-
ing and financial disclosure: If the company has any disagreements 
with the auditors about what information must be presented on the 
financial statements and how to present it, this section is where you find 
discussion of the differences.
 
✓ Item 9A — Controls and procedures: This section is where you find 
information about the company’s internal controls and procedures to 
avoid fraud and ensure accuracy in the financial statements. I discuss 
these requirements in greater detail in the section “Investigating Internal 
Controls.”
 
✓ Item 9B — Other Information: This includes any items that aren’t 
reported on an 8-K during the year, as well as items that are reported on 
an 8-K but aren’t reported elsewhere in the 10-K.

252
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
Information about directors and executives
Part III of the 10-K takes you behind the scenes of company operations and 
gives you information about the directors and top executives, including any 
special compensation packages they receive. Following are the items you can 
expect to find:
 
✓ Item 10 — Directors and executive officers of the registrant: Here’s 
where you find out who sits on the company’s board of directors, as 
well as who serves as the company’s top executive officers.
 
✓ Item 11 — Executive compensation: The company must report the com-
pensation packages for all its top executives in this section.
 
✓ Item 12 — Security ownership of certain beneficial owners and man-
agement and related stockholder matters: Here you find details about 
the stock owned by top executives, board members, senior managers, 
and any other major shareholders of the company.
 
✓ Item 13 — Certain relationships and related transactions and director 
independence: This section is where you find out about large related-
party transactions, such as any transactions between the company and 
its top management team. Information about significant transactions 
between the company and its subsidiaries or major shareholders must 
also be listed in this section.
 
✓ Item 14 — Principal accounting fees and services: Here’s where you 
find details about the relationship between the company and its accoun-
tants. The company must report the fees billed for each of the past two 
fiscal years for professional services by the principal accountant for the 
audit of the company’s financial statements, as well as for any services 
related to the audit. The company must also disclose fees for tax ser-
vices by professional accountants for tax compliance, tax advice, and 
tax planning, as well as fees for any additional services that the principal 
accountant provides. In addition, the company must disclose the audit 
committee’s pre-approved policies and procedures related to the work 
of the principal accountant.
The extras
Part IV of the 10-K is the catchall for additional exhibits, including any finan-
cial statement schedules and any reports the company filed throughout the 
year and reported on Form 8-K.

253
 Chapter 19: Digging into Government Regulations
Investigating Internal Controls
 
When filing Form 10-K with the SEC, companies must also include the manage-
ment’s report on internal controls (which includes rules for how company 
staff should do their work to avoid theft and fraud). This requirement was 
added as part of the sweeping changes mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
of 2002, which I discuss in greater detail in Chapter 3.
The management’s report on internal controls requires that companies pro-
vide the following:
 
✓ Statement of management’s responsibility for designing, establishing, 
and maintaining an adequate internal control structure over financial 
reporting for the company
 
✓ Statement identifying the framework used by management to evaluate 
the effectiveness of its internal controls
 
✓ Management’s assessment, as of the end of the fiscal year being 
reported, of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control struc-
ture and procedures for financial reporting
 
✓ Attestation report from the company’s auditor regarding management’s 
assessment of the internal controls’ effectiveness, which assures the 10-K 
reader that the auditor reviewed the assessment and found it effective
Management must report any weaknesses it finds in its internal controls over 
financial reporting. If management finds one or more material weaknesses 
within the company’s internal control system, the company can’t conclude 
that its internal controls are effective. The following are some of the key 
points management must guarantee for its internal control process:
 
✓ Maintenance of records that accurately detail and fairly reflect the trans-
actions and dispositions of the company’s assets
 
✓ Assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the 
company to prepare financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles
 
✓ Assurance that receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance 
with authorizations from management and company directors
 
✓ Assurance that management has controls in place to detect and prevent 
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements

254
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
You may be thinking, “Shouldn’t a company have all these controls in place 
and not need the government to tell it to put them there?” Well, investors 
who lost billions because of the financial shenanigans at companies like 
Enron, MCI, and others during the early 2000s sure wish these internal con-
trols were more strongly enforced by the SEC before they took their losses.
Uncovering the Ways Companies 
Keep in Compliance
Sometimes, significant changes in a company’s financial position occur 
between the times the company files its financial reports. When that hap-
pens, the company must file a special report called an 8-K, which reports any 
material changes (changes that could have a significant financial impact on 
the company’s earnings) that happen between the times of the quarterly or 
annual reports.
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (see Chapter 3) mandates that the SEC review 
all its compliance requirements regarding financial reporting. In response to 
the legislation, the SEC issued new rules for Form 8-K, requiring companies to 
report any material changes within four days of the event. Critical events to be 
reported on Form 8-K include
 
✓ Business combination: Any agreement related to a business combination 
(such as a merger combining two companies or consolidating two major 
divisions into one) or other extraordinary corporate transaction that 
could be material to the company’s financial position. This report must 
include
 
• Date of execution
 
• Parties involved
 
• Material relationship between the company or its affiliates and any 
other party involved in the agreement
 
• Brief description of the terms and conditions of this agreement
 
 Companies don’t need to disclose any nonbinding agreements or letters 
of intent, provided that they aren’t material to the company.
 
✓ Agreement termination: Any termination of an agreement that was pre-
viously reported, such as the cancellation of a signed contract to pro-
vide a significant amount of the company’s product to another company 
if this cancellation means a loss of significant future earnings.
 
✓ Bankruptcy or receivership: Any plans to declare bankruptcy or enter 
into receivership, a type of bankruptcy in which the company can avoid 
liquidating itself and instead work with a court-appointed trustee to 
restructure its debt with the intention of emerging from bankruptcy.

255
 Chapter 19: Digging into Government Regulations
 
✓ Acquisition or disposition: Any acquisition or sale of major assets 
outside the course of ordinary business operations. For example, the 
acquisition of a new company fits the reporting requirement, but the 
acquisition of new equipment for continuing operations doesn’t need a 
special report on Form 8-K.
 
✓ Financial results: Any earnings results related to earnings, company 
operations, or financial conditions that occurred between the quarterly 
or annual reports and were distributed by press releases or other public 
means.
 
✓ Financial obligations: Any direct financial obligations that are material 
to the company, such as the signing of a long-term debt or lease obliga-
tion. The company must include a brief description of the transaction 
and agreement.
 
✓ Disposal of assets: Any costs related to the disposal of long-held assets 
when the company enters into an agreement (usually called an exit 
agreement) to get rid of those assets. Termination of employees under 
an exit plan must also be disclosed.
 
✓ Impairment of asset value: Any conclusion by the board or an authorized 
company officer that the value of an asset is significantly impaired — for 
example, when the value of goodwill is determined to be significantly less 
than what’s reported on the balance sheet.
 
✓ Changes in stock exchange listing: Any time the company gets notifica-
tion that it may be delisted (removed) from a stock exchange, or if the 
company fails to meet the rules or standards set by the stock exchange 
it’s listed on. Any plans to change to a new stock exchange must also be 
reported.
 
✓ Accountant change: Any change in the company’s certifying accountant.
 
✓ Unreliable financial reports: Any conclusion by the company’s board 
of directors, a committee of the board, or an authorized officer that a 
previously issued financial report can’t be relied on for information. 
You’ve probably heard press reports indicating that a company plans to 
restate its financial reports because of an error. Many times, those press 
reports are based on a press release and the Form 8-K.
 
✓ Changes in control of company: Any departures of directors or princi-
pal officers, election of new directors, or appointment of new principal 
officers.
 
✓ Changes in charter or bylaws: Any proposed change in the charter or 
bylaws and its impact on the company’s operations.
 
✓ Changes in fiscal year: Any plans to change a company’s fiscal year if 
the decision is made outside the vote of the shareholders or by amend-
ment to its bylaws. The company must include the date of determina-
tion, the date of the new fiscal year, and the form on which the report 
covering the transition period will be filed.

256
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
 
✓ Temporary suspension of trading in company’s employee benefit 
plans: Any suspensions of employee benefit plans for a period of time. 
Most often, such suspensions happen when the company changes from 
one benefit provider to another. However, this change can be a sign 
of a major decision impacting the company’s stock, such as a pending 
announcement about company earnings, a stock split, a buyback of 
stock, or an issuance of new stock.
 
✓ Amendments to the company’s code of ethics: Any significant changes 
to the company’s code of ethics.
As you can see from this list, you’d never hear about most of these events if 
companies weren’t required to report them. But this information could be 
critical to any decision you make about the stock you currently hold or may 
want to buy.
Digging into Board Operations
Since the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (see Chapter 3), the SEC 
more closely scrutinizes a company’s board operations and the interaction 
between its board and shareholders. SEC staff continue to study the act’s 
requirements and to issue new disclosure requirements as they identify 
problems. Two major changes adopted since initial passage involve:
 
✓ Disclosure to investors about the board’s nominating committee and the 
nominating process for new board members
 
✓ Disclosure about the means by which the holders of a company’s securi-
ties can communicate with the board of directors
In most cases, this information appears on the company’s Web site or with 
its annual reports.
 
Note that I refer to “security holders” in some cases and “shareholders” in 
other cases. Not all security holders are shareholders. Only shareholders have 
voting rights within the company. Bonds are a type of security, so although 
bondholders don’t have voting rights like shareholders, they do have an inter-
est in who serves on the board.
The nominating process
The newly adopted rules imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley regarding a public com-
pany’s nomination process demand that the board specify the following in 
writing to its shareholders:

257
 Chapter 19: Digging into Government Regulations
 
✓ Whether the nominating committee has a written charter and, if it 
does, whether it’s available on the company’s Web site. If the charter 
isn’t available on the Web site, the company must print it as part of its 
proxy information once every three years.
 
✓ Whether the members of the nominating committee are independent 
(not directly involved in company operations).
 
✓ Whether the nominating committee accepts nominations from security 
holders. If the company allows nominations, it must include information 
about how security holders can nominate someone to be on the board. If 
the company doesn’t have a policy to accept nominations from security 
holders, it must explain why the board has decided not to accept these 
nominations.
 
✓ Minimum qualifications that the nominating committee believes must 
be met by a person who’s recommended for a position on the compa-
ny’s board of directors. In addition, the company must list any specific 
qualities or skills that the nominating committee believes are needed for 
one or more of the open director’s positions.
 
✓ How the company evaluates director nominees, including those rec-
ommended by security holders. If evaluation is different for committee 
nominees than it is for security holder nominees, the differences must 
be specified in the documentation as well.
After the nominations are set, the company needs to disclose to its share-
holders whether the nominee was recommended by a security holder, a 
nonmanagement director, the chief executive officer, a third-party search 
firm, or by some other means. The board doesn’t have to disclose this infor-
mation about nominees who are executive officers or directors standing for 
reelection.
The SEC reviews all proxies (paper ballots sent to shareholders) to see how 
the company presents the information concerning its nominating process. 
If the SEC determines that the company doesn’t provide sufficient details, it 
can ask that the company expand its information.
Contacting board members
A company must put a process in place that permits security holders to send 
communications to the board of directors or supply a statement from the 
board explaining why it believes that not doing so is appropriate.
The board must make a public disclosure about its security-holder communi-
cations process that includes a description of how security holders can com-
municate with the board and, if applicable, a list of specific board members 
who deal with specific topics. If the board decides that not all security-holder 

258
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
communications are to be sent directly to board members, it must specify 
how it selects which communications it sends to board members. This dis-
closure can be made on the company’s Web site or in annual reports.
Finding Out about Insider Ownership
 
As an investor, tracking the ownership of stock by insiders can give you a 
good idea of how they feel about owning the company’s stock. If most of the 
insiders buy the stock, that’s usually a good sign — the insiders believe in the 
long-term performance of the company. But if you find that insiders primarily 
sell their holdings, trouble could be brewing.
Forms 3, 4, and 5 are used to file information about holdings by individuals or 
entities who are directors, officers, or major shareholders (holders of more 
than 10 percent of the stock). Keep your eye on these three important forms 
to find out what insiders think of the stock:
 
✓ Form 3: Filed when an individual or entity first takes ownership of stock
 
✓ Form 4: Filed when an individual or entity changes ownership of stock
 
✓ Form 5: Filed as an annual statement summarizing changes in stock 
ownership of directors, officers, or major shareholders
 
You can find forms filed with the SEC at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml, but 
it’s easier to use certain financial Web sites to track stock transactions made 
by company insiders. On Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com/), 
after you get to the main page for a particular company, you find a link in the 
left column for insider transactions. You can also get a list of major stockhold-
ers by using the link in the right column for major holdings.

Chapter 20
Creating a Global Financial 
Reporting Standard
In This Chapter
▶ Developing uniform global financial-reporting standards
▶ Seeing who benefits from standardization
▶ Examining the differences between reporting systems
A
s more and more companies operate globally, the need grows for 
common financial reporting rules. Today, many global companies 
must prepare financial statements in every country in which they operate to 
meet each country’s reporting requirements. They also must keep the books 
according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) rules (see 
Chapter 18), if the company is a U.S. company, and must meet the standards 
of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), or possibly other 
standards set by government officials in the country in which they’re based.
Financial regulatory institutions plan to meld the standards at some point in 
the future. Today, over 100 countries use IFRS as the public reporting stan-
dard. By 2011, the IFRS may be used in almost every country, including the 
U.S. In this chapter, I explore why a move to develop a global public reporting 
standard is underway, and I introduce you to the key players who are creat-
ing this standard. I also discuss the primary benefits of a worldwide standard 
and talk about some key differences between the U.S. GAAP and the IFRS.
Why Develop a Worldwide 
Financial Standard?
Have you ever tried to compare a U.S. company to a company in another 
country and been frustrated with how difficult it is to be looking at apples to 
oranges? Financial reporting rules differ from country to country, so you can 

260
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
never be certain you’re comparing the same information about assets, liabili-
ties, equity, revenue, or expenses. These differences in reporting can make 
trying to decide which company’s stock to buy very difficult.
Companies that operate in more than one country have bigger problems 
than those that operate in only one country because they must report 
results to each country in which they operate, as well as to the country in 
which they’re based. This can result in numerous different accounting sys-
tems that must constantly be translated to match the rules for each set of 
financial reports.
For example, a global U.S. company operating in Canada must report results 
in Canada according to the Canadian GAAP. If the firm is listed on the London 
exchange, it must also prepare statements to meet the IFRS, and it would 
need to prepare another set of statements under the rules of the U.S. GAAP. 
Imagine doing that for every country in which the business operates. U.S. 
companies that operate in 100 countries or more face a nightmare trying to 
get the financial statements to meet all these varying requirements. Anything 
that can simplify this process benefits both the companies that must prepare 
the statements and the investors trying to interpret the differences.
Key Moves to Reshape Global 
Financial Reporting
So how did the process get started to reshape the global financial road map, 
and who are the key players?
In 2002, the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (or FASB, which 
issues GAAP rules) and the London-based International Accounting 
Standards Board (or IASB, which issues the IFRS) entered into the Norwalk 
Agreement, which lays out a plan to undertake efforts to converge the U.S. 
GAAP and the IFRS. The primary difference between the two is that the IFRS 
are more focused on objectives and principles and less reliant on detailed 
rules than the GAAP.
After much discussion and negotiation, the European Commission began its 
project on the equivalence of national GAAP and the IFRS and issued a draft 
report in 2005. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) followed 
with its development of the “IFRS Road Map” in 2005.
In 2006, the FASB and IASB reaffirmed their commitment to converge the two 
reporting systems and updated the Norwalk Agreement based on findings 
in the 2005 reports. In 2007, the SEC eliminated the requirement for foreign 
companies that use IFRS to reconcile to the GAAP. The first major step in 
accepting IFRS in financial reports circulated to U.S. investors.

261
 Chapter 20: Creating a Global Financial Reporting Standard
In 2007, in another major step to accept IFRS reporting requirements by 
U.S. companies, the SEC issued a “concept release” on the topic of allowing 
U.S. companies a choice between filing their reports based on IFRS or GAAP 
requirements. A concept release opens up the question and seeks com-
ments. The SEC has not yet permitted U.S. companies to use IFRS reporting 
requirements for SEC reports, but it did move a step closer in May 2008 when 
it released a “proposing release” on the matter. The proposing release pro-
poses the change and asks for comments.
SEC Chairman Christopher Cox is leading the effort to permit the use of 
IFRS and spoke favorably about this option in a speech to the International 
Organization of Securities Commissions in Paris in May 2008. If the organiza-
tion adopts the proposing release, U.S. companies will be able to use IFRS for 
SEC reporting purposes by 2011.
The U.S. will be one of the last countries to jump on this bandwagon. Israel 
adopted IFRS in 2008. Chile and Korea plan to adopt IFRS in 2009. Brazil is 
set to adopt IFRS in 2010 and Canada in 2011. So if the U.S. does jump on the 
bandwagon in 2011, global corporations will be able to adopt IFRS for almost 
all their reporting.
Who Benefits from a Global 
Standard and How?
Companies that must prepare the reports, and investors, government agen-
cies, and vendors that must use the reports, will all benefit from a global 
standard. It’s very hard to make an informed decision when companies use 
varying regulations for reporting their finances.
Investors
Every day, investors seek ways to get high-quality financial information that 
accurately reflects a company’s true financial results. Any investor burned by 
the mortgage mess in 2007, when key financial institutions kept major hold-
ings off the books, knows how critical accurate financial reporting can be to 
their decision making.
 
Though IFRS wouldn’t fix all the problems seen in 2007 and 2008 as financial 
institutions fessed up to their reporting shenanigans, a global standard would 
make it harder to hide problems across country borders. As U.S. investors 
become aware that they no longer have to massage the numbers to compare 
the results of U.S. companies to companies based outside the U.S., they’ll push 
for IFRS so they can compare apples to apples.

262
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
Companies that use IFRS tend to have longer annual reports than companies 
that use GAAP, and the reports are more transparent. While a U.S. report 
based on GAAP may be 60 to 70 pages, a report using IFRS may be closer to 
110 pages. That may seem even more overwhelming to you, but you’ll have 
more information with which to make your decisions.
Capital markets
Capital markets would benefit from IFRS, because if all companies operate 
under one set of accounting standards, investors can more easily access 
multiple foreign markets as they build their investment portfolios. This will 
stimulate investment and enable capital flows across borders.
Companies
Companies stand to gain the most from this rule change because it will sim-
plify the financial reporting requirements if they operate in more than one 
country. Allowing U.S. companies who operate globally to use IFRS will:
 
✓ Standardize and improve accounting and financial policies. 
Companies will no longer have to maintain two or more sets of books to 
prepare financial statements based on varying rules.
 
✓ Lead to more efficient use of resources. Companies will be able to more 
easily centralize their accounting processes and simplify the training 
required for their employees if only one set of standards for reporting is 
required to meet governmental regulations.
 
✓ Improve controls. IFRS give companies more control over statutory 
reporting, which reduces the risks related to penalties and compliance 
problems to meet the regulations of each country in which the company 
operates.
 
✓ Facilitate better cash management. By having more consistent rules across 
borders, companies will be able to manage their cash more efficiently.
Exploring Key Differences 
between GAAP and IFRS
Major reports have been written about the key differences between the GAAP 
and the IFRS. I don’t have the space to do a comprehensive breakdown of the 
differences, but I do give you a quick peek at some of the key differences in 
this section.

263
 Chapter 20: Creating a Global Financial Reporting Standard
 
If you want a full comparison, you can download an excellent report from 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (a major global accounting firm) at www.pwc.com/
us/ifrs/ifrs_us_gaap_comparison.html.
Accounting framework
A significant difference between IFRS and GAAP is that IFRS permit the revalu-
ation of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investment 
property. GAAP prohibit revaluations except for certain categories of finan-
cial instruments that are carried at fair value.
Many analysts believe that assets are undervalued on the balance sheets of 
major U.S. corporations that compile their reports based on GAAP, especially 
when it comes to the value of property and plants. Corporate headquarters 
and factories that were built 20 to 30 years ago are valued on the balance 
sheets at cost. These assets likely have appreciated greatly even though the 
buildings have been depreciated to near zero on the balance sheets.
 
If U.S. corporations do decide to switch to IFRS, you may see a dramatic 
increase in the value of assets held by some companies as they revalue their 
property and plants.
Financial statements
The key financial statements required by both IFRS and GAAP are similar, but 
the ways in which the numbers are calculated sometimes differ. Also, IFRS 
only require two years of data for the income statements, changes in equity, 
and cash flow statements, while GAAP require three years of data for SEC 
registrants.
I discuss some key differences in the following sections, but if your company 
is considering a switch to IFRS, or if you’re an investor who really wants to 
understand how the differences may impact the compilation of the numbers 
for the financial statements, I highly recommend that you download the 
report from PricewaterhouseCoopers mentioned earlier in the chapter.
Balance sheet
GAAP require assets, liabilities, and equity to be presented in decreasing 
order of liquidity. The balance sheet is generally presented with total assets 
equaling total liabilities and shareholders’ equity. For more details on how 
the balance sheet is presented, review Chapter 6.

264
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
IFRS don’t require any specific format, but entities are expected to present 
current and noncurrent assets and current and noncurrent liabilities as sepa-
rate classifications on their balance sheets, except when liquidity presenta-
tion provides more relevant and reliable information.
I did review several balance sheets of European companies and didn’t find 
any significant differences in the way the balance sheet was presented. The 
basic format of the GAAP balance sheet seems to be pretty well accepted 
globally. In Chapter 6, I include a financial position format, which is some-
times used by companies not based in the U.S.
Income statement
IFRS don’t prescribe a standard format, but GAAP do require the use of a 
single-step or multi-step format, as shown in Chapter 7. IFRS prohibit the use 
of the category “extraordinary items,” but GAAP allow an extraordinary line 
item on the income statement.
Extraordinary items are defined as being both infrequent and unusual. For 
example, when goodwill is shown as a negative item, it’s listed as an extraor-
dinary item on the income statement. In 2007 and 2008, as financial institu-
tions put goodwill in this category from acquisitions gone bad because of the 
mortgage mess, they usually put it down as an extraordinary item. By sepa-
rating these items from operating income results, a company can make its net 
income look better.
 
Writing down goodwill doesn’t involve the use of cash. Cash is used when a 
company buys another company for more than the value of its assets. If this 
happened many years ago, it doesn’t impact the current year’s operating 
results.
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense (SoRIE)
The SoRIE is unique to IFRS, but the information is commonly shown at the 
bottom of the income statement by companies filing reports under the rules 
of GAAP, or it’s presented on a separate document called the statement of 
changes in shareholder’s equity. In either case, the information presents the 
total income and accumulated income over time.
Note: Notice that recognised is spelled with an “s” instead of a “z.” I use the 
common British spelling because this statement isn’t used by U.S. corpora-
tions but instead is used primarily by companies in Europe that use a British 
spelling.
Statement of changes in shareholders’ equity
This statement is similar in both the IFRS and the GAAP, unless a non-U.S. com-
pany files a SoRIE. This statement isn’t required as a separate document under 
GAAP rules. A company can choose to present the information about changes 
in shareholders’ equity as part of the notes to the financial statements.

265
 Chapter 20: Creating a Global Financial Reporting Standard
Cash flow statement
In both the IFRS and the GAAP, this statement is presented with similar head-
ings. IFRS give limited guidance on what information must be included on the 
statement.
GAAP give more specific guidance for which categories must be included in 
each section of the statement. Statements can be prepared using the direct 
or indirect method under either IFRS or GAAP. I discuss the differences 
between the direct and indirect methods in Chapter 8.
Revenue recognition
Both IFRS and GAAP require the recognition of revenue when an item’s own-
ership is transferred to the buyer of the goods, but GAAP give much more 
detailed guidance for specific types of transactions. In Chapter 23, I detail the 
games that some companies play with revenue recognition, even under the 
more detailed GAAP rules. I certainly hope that as the international financial 
regulators converge the requirements of the two systems, they improve the 
rules related to the recognition of revenue.
Assets
 
One key difference between IFRS and GAAP is that assets can be revalued 
under IFRS, as discussed earlier in the “Accounting framework” section. 
Another key difference is that only research is expensed as a cost of doing 
business under IFRS, but both research and development are expensed under 
the GAAP rules. Under IFRS, development costs are capitalized and amortized 
(or written off) over several years.
This policy can have a major impact on a company’s bottom line. For example, 
suppose a company determines that of the $5 million it spent on bringing a 
new product to market, $1 million was for research and $4 million was for 
development of the product after research was concluded. Under the GAAP 
rules, the $5 million would be expensed in each year of the development based 
on when the expenses are recognized (I talk about expense recognition in 
Chapters 7 and 16). Those expenses would decrease net income significantly.
A company operating under the requirements of the IFRS would report this 
same scenario differently. It would only need to expense the $1 million spent 
on research as it was spent, but it could capitalize the $4 million and write 
it off more slowly as an amortization. Depending on the life span given the 
value of the development, it could be written off over 10 to 15 years or more 
and reduce the impact of development on the bottom line.

266
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
 
If you’re trying to determine which company makes the better investment, you 
must look carefully at this key difference in research and development. After 
all global firms use IFRS to file their financial statements, this difference will no 
longer be a factor when comparing U.S. companies to companies based out-
side the U.S.
Inventory
Another key difference between IFRS and GAAP is the way inventory is 
valued. All companies that file reports under IFRS must use FIFO or weighted-
average inventory valuation methods (I discuss inventory valuation methods 
in Chapter 15). Those filing under GAAP rules can also use LIFO.
FIFO stands for “first in, first out.” This type of inventory valuation assumes 
that the first item in the door is the first item sold. Because prices of goods 
are usually increasing, the item with the lowest cost likely sells first. LIFO 
stands for “last in, first out.” When this inventory valuation method is used, 
the last item bought will be the first item sold. In this case, the most expen-
sive item is likely sold, while the older, cheaper items remain on the shelf.
 
LIFO can increase the cost of goods sold and decrease net income, making it 
look like a company made less money and therefore reducing the company’s 
taxes. FIFO results in a lower cost of goods sold and higher net income.
When comparing companies using two different inventory valuation meth-
ods, determining the actual costs of doing business can be difficult. If all com-
panies were required to use either FIFO or the weighted-average inventory 
valuation methods, comparing apples to apples would be easier. When the 
two systems are merged in the future, the IFRS requirements on inventory 
valuation will hopefully be adopted. In fact, the LIFO option may be discontin-
ued under GAAP rules.
Related-party transactions-disclosures
In related-party transactions — transactions between, say, a corporation and 
one of its affiliates — companies filing under IFRS regulations must disclose 
the compensation of key management personnel in the financial statements. 
GAAP don’t require such disclosure.
Hopefully, the IFRS rules will be adopted when the systems converge. 
Shareholders need to know the compensation of management personnel, and 
this information should be made very visible in the financial statements. U.S. 
investors will definitely benefit from fuller disclosure in this area.

267
 Chapter 20: Creating a Global Financial Reporting Standard
Discontinued operations
Under IFRS, if operations are discontinued, the operations and cash flows 
must be clearly distinguished for financial reporting and must represent a 
separate line of business or geographical area of operations, including if a 
subsidiary is acquired exclusively for the purpose of being sold. That hap-
pens often when a company buys another for a specific purpose and isn’t 
interested in continuing every area of the bought company’s operations.
Under GAAP, the lines are more blurred for discontinued operations. A seg-
ment, operating segment, reporting unit, subsidiary, or asset group can be 
shown as separate losses for discontinued operations.
 
Some analysts believe that companies filing under GAAP use this loophole 
to hide significant problems. I talk more about how discontinued operations 
are used to clear out deadwood on a balance sheet in Chapter 23. U.S. inves-
tors will benefit if the clear IFRS lines are drawn for U.S. companies, and fewer 
problems will be swept under the rug.
Impairment charges
Sometimes an asset loses value. For example, a computer manufacturer 
may have inventory of older models that can no longer be sold at full price 
because newer, more advanced models are now available. Their values 
become impaired and must be written down.
Under GAAP, when an impairment charge is recorded in inventory, the com-
pany can’t reverse the impairment charge if assets subsequently increase in 
value. Under IFRS, however, the company is allowed to reverse the impair-
ment charge if assets subsequently go back up in value.
 
This can impact both the income statement and the balance sheet, as assets 
whose values have been impaired are adjusted in later years. Investors need 
to watch the ups and downs of assets, which can impact the profit or loss of a 
company without a change in operations.

Connection
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the various kinds of analysts
▶ Exploring the bond-rating agencies
▶ Understanding stock ratings
▶ Getting key information from analysts
F
inancial analysts regularly get into the act not by talking companies 
through their mother issues but by developing rankings that reflect a 
company’s value. The way analysts view a company can make or break the 
value of its stock. If a well-respected analyst writes a negative report after 
seeing a firm’s financial reports, its stock price is guaranteed to drop at least 
temporarily. Red flags raised by analysts help you find crucial details you 
should look for when reading a company’s financial reports.
This chapter reviews the types of analysts and the ways a company feeds 
financial information to them.
Typecasting the Analysts
Analysts, many of whom have completed a grueling testing process that takes 
at least three years to get the designation Chartered Financial Analyst, serve 
different roles for different people:

270
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
 
✓ For large investment groups (such as mutual or pension funds): They 
determine whether a company’s stock price accurately reflects the 
firm’s worth and whether the stock fills a particular niche that the group 
wants to fill in its overall portfolio-management objectives.
 
✓ For financial institutions: They analyze a company’s debt structure and 
determine whether the company is bringing in enough money to pay its 
bills, which helps the institution decide whether to loan the firm money 
and at what interest rate.
 
✓ For brokerage houses: They provide individual investors analysis about 
the companies they’re considering for their portfolio. Their reports are 
available to anyone who uses the brokerage house for stock transac-
tions. Unless you have a very large portfolio and can pay an analyst, the 
analyst won’t work specifically for you. That’s why you need to read and 
analyze financial reports yourself.
 
✓ For bond-rating firms: They review a company’s debt structure, finan-
cial health, and bill-paying ability in order to rate the bonds issued by 
the company.
 
 Reports from bond-rating companies are especially helpful because 
they focus on any debt problems the company may be facing. You can 
then check out the financial reports yourself and find the red flags 
more easily.
You may not realize that several different types of analysts master various 
domains of financial analysis. Regardless of what type of analyst you’re deal-
ing with, the one thing you can be sure of as an individual investor is that 
analysts won’t work for you unless you’re the one paying them for developing 
the information. They primarily gear their reports to the needs of those who 
do pay them.
This section looks at the various types of analysts and who they primarily 
serve.
Buy-side analysts
Buy-side analysts work primarily for large institutions and investment firms 
that manage mutual funds, pension funds, or other types of multimillion-
dollar private accounts. Buy-side analysts are responsible for analyzing 
stocks that portfolio managers are considering for possible purchase and 
placement in various portfolios managed by their firms. In other words, buy-
side analysts’ bosses are major institutional buyers of stock. Some buy-side 
analysts work for mutual funds or pension funds directly; others work for 
independent analyst firms hired by the mutual funds or pension funds.

271
 Chapter 21: Checking Out the Analyst-Corporation Connection
Buy-side analysts write reports that help portfolio managers determine 
whether a stock fits the firm’s portfolio-management strategy, but it may 
not fit your portfolio’s strategy, so you can’t necessarily follow their recom-
mendations. Managers of mutual funds that focus on growth stocks look for 
stocks that fill that niche. Managers of mutual funds that focus on foreign 
stocks look for stocks that fit that objective. Sometimes, a stock that most 
analysts would pan may get a positive report inside a buy-side analytical 
shop. For example, if portfolio managers are looking for candidates for a 
value portfolio made up of stocks currently beaten down by the market but 
with good potential to rebound, buy-side analysts may recommend buying a 
stock that has just lost half its value.
 
You rarely see this type of analyst’s research available on the public market, 
but much of the information does trickle out in the financial press through 
statements made by mutual fund managers. Morningstar, which is one of 
the leading groups that rate mutual funds for individual investors, is a good 
place to get ideas for possible additions to your stock portfolio. On its Web 
site (www.morningstar.com), you can frequently find stories about which 
stocks mutual fund managers are buying and why they’re buying them. Of 
course, you can’t just buy stock based on these stories. You need to read the 
financial reports and do your own analysis of these reports.
Sell-side analysts
As an individual investor, you most likely see reports from sell-side analysts. 
These analysts work for brokerage houses or other financial institutions that 
sell stocks to individual investors. You get reports written by these analysts 
when you ask your broker for research on a particular stock.
You can’t take everything you get from sell-side analysts as gospel. Their pri-
mary purpose is to help a company’s salespeople make sales. As long as your 
interests match the interests of the broker and brokerage house, the sell-
side analytical reports can be helpful. But as scandals after the Internet and 
technology stock crash of 2000 have shown (see the sidebar “Analyzing the 
analysts”), conflicts of interest can exist between a brokerage house’s need 
to make money by selling stock and an individual investor’s need to make 
money by owning stock that goes up in value.
Many investors lost 50 percent or more of the money they invested in stock 
during the 1990s and early 2000s before the stock market crashed. Many bro-
kerage houses were more concerned with making money by selling stocks 
than they were with helping investors put together stock portfolios that met 
their goals and took into consideration their tolerance for risk. And investors 
weren’t well served by the analysts, who should have been accurately report-
ing the risks of investing in many of the companies whose financial reports 
they analyzed for investors.

272
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
 
You must take the responsibility yourself to read and analyze reports. You 
can’t depend on an analyst unless you pay that analyst out of your own pocket 
to do the analysis.
Brokerage companies used to avoid scandals and conflicts of interest by 
protecting themselves with what’s called a Chinese Wall. Analysts kept 
their work separate from the investment banking division (which sells new 
public offerings of stocks or bonds and arranges mergers and acquisitions), 
and their compensation wasn’t dependent on what business they helped to 
bring in. At some point in the past 20 years, this wall broke down, and sell-
side analysts became partners with the investment banking side to help the 
firm make money. If a company won new investment banking business, it 
rewarded analysts with fees or commissions.
 
Sell-side analysts’ Chinese Wall was reconstructed to a certain extent after 
the tech stock scandals (see the sidebar “Analyzing the analysts”). The 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally got involved in April 2002 
and ended up endorsing rulemaking changes developed by the New York 
Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers. These 
new rules do the following:
Analyzing the analysts
During the scandal-ridden technology crash 
of 2000, sell-side analysts working for broker-
age houses were caught between the needs of 
their firms’ investment banking division to help 
sell new offerings and the needs of their firms’ 
individual investors, who were clients of the 
salespeople. The investment banking side won, 
and individual investors got hosed.
By writing glowing reports about the stocks or 
bonds involved in investment banking deals, 
sell-side analysts helped pull in new investment 
banking clients and kept existing clients happy. 
While the brokerage houses made millions on 
investment banking deals, individual inves-
tors lost big chunks of their portfolios buying 
analyst-recommended stocks, many of which 
dropped dramatically in value after the market 
crash of 2000, leaving investors with ruined 
portfolios filled with worthless stocks. Overall, 
investors lost billions.
Then-New York State Attorney General Eliot 
Spitzer helped expose this entire mess by 
unearthing e-mails from superstar analysts 
like Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch, who wrote 
positive reports about stocks being sold by his 
investment banking divisions while privately 
calling these stocks “dogs,” “junk,” and “toast.” 
Spitzer charged that Blodget’s recommenda-
tions helped bring in $115 million in investment 
banking fees for Merrill Lynch. Blodget got rich, 
too — he took home about $12 million in com-
pensation, according to Spitzer’s findings.
Merrill Lynch wasn’t the only company that 
Spitzer’s investigation exposed. Other firms 
caught in Spitzer’s net include Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter & Co. and Credit Suisse First 
Boston. In fact, most brokerage houses that 
have an investment banking division got caught 
up in the scandal.

273
 Chapter 21: Checking Out the Analyst-Corporation Connection
 
✓ Prohibit investment banking divisions from supervising analysts or 
approving their research reports.
 
✓ Ban the practice of tying analysts’ compensation to specific investment 
banking transactions.
 
✓ Prohibit analysts from offering favorable research to bring in investment 
banking business for a firm.
 
✓ Disclose conflicts of interest in research reports and public appear-
ances. Brokerage houses must include information about business 
relationships with, or ownership interests in, any company that’s the 
subject of an analyst’s report.
 
✓ Restrict personal trading by analysts in securities of companies they 
analyze or report on.
 
✓ Dictate that a firm discloses data about its historical ratings and a price 
chart that compares its ratings with closing prices.
As an investor, you can quickly determine whether a conflict exists between 
your interests and the financial interests of a brokerage house or analyst 
when you see the new disclosures required. You can also look at the broker-
age house’s historical ratings for a company’s stock and see how successful 
it has been in accurately reporting the stock’s value in the past.
 
When you read a sell-side analyst’s report and see that the brokerage firm gets 
fees for investment banking services from the company that’s the subject of 
the report, realize that the brokerage firm makes more money from its invest-
ment banking business than it does from you. Take what you find useful from 
the report, but be sure to do your own additional research.
Independent analysts
You may wonder whether you can depend on any analysts out there. Well, 
the answer is yes and no. Certainly, some independent analyst groups — 
those that aren’t paid by a brokerage house or other financial institution 
but provide reports for a fee paid by people who want them — report on 
companies as well. The problem is that independent analyst groups work for 
people who can afford to pay them, meaning that you must have a portfolio 
of at least $1 million or be able to pay about $25,000 per year. Few individual 
investors meet these criteria.
 
Many independent analysts do sell the reports through financial Web sites for 
a per-report fee to individuals who are researching a specific company. Your 
rule of thumb about independent analysts’ reports should be to take what 
information you find useful but be sure to do additional research on your own. 
The report you buy from the independent analyst on a particular company 
was developed for one of the analyst’s clients and not specifically for you.

274
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
 
After reading about analysts, you may think you don’t have a chance to get 
good information from them. Your best place to find research that isn’t tainted 
by the investment banking business of your brokerage firm is to visit the 
Web sites of major investment research firms like Morningstar (www.morning
star.com) and Standard & Poor’s (www.standardandpoors.com). You 
have to pay fees to access their confidential services, but they’re much more 
reasonable than those of an independent analyst and can be as low as $100 
per year, depending on what information you need.
Bond analysts
Bond analysts are most concerned about a company’s liquidity and the com-
pany’s ability to make its interest payments, repay its debt principal, and pay 
its bills. They used to have a reputation of doing things with a more cautious 
eye, but their close relationship to the investment banking side of the house 
was exposed during the mortgage crisis beginning in 2007. Many of the mort-
gage debt instruments they rated proved to be rated incorrectly, leading to 
huge losses for banks, mutual funds, and pension funds.
Bond analysts, prior to this fiasco, were thought to evaluate financial reports, 
management quality, the competitive environment, and overall economic 
conditions more carefully. They tended to err on the side of caution, but now 
this reputation has been shattered. When it comes to rating corporate bonds, 
it’s worth looking at their view, but always do your own research.
 
When you’re looking to buy stock, pay attention to the warnings of bond 
analysts. You certainly don’t want to invest in a company that can’t meet its 
financial obligations and may go bankrupt. Use bond analysts’ red flags to help 
you find the critical information when you read and analyze financial reports 
yourself.
Regarding Bond Rating Agencies
Bond ratings have a great impact on a company’s operations and the cost of 
funding its operations. The quality rating of a company’s bonds determines 
how much interest the firm has to offer to pay in order to sell the bonds on 
the public bond market. Bonds that are rated with a higher quality rating are 
considered less risky, so the interest rates that must be paid to attract indi-
viduals or companies to buy those bonds can be lower. Companies that issue 
bonds with the lowest ratings, which are also known as junk bonds, pay much 
higher interest rates to attract individuals or companies to buy those bonds.

275
 Chapter 21: Checking Out the Analyst-Corporation Connection
 
Bonds are a type of debt for a company. The individual or company that buys 
a bond is loaning money to the company that it expects to get back. The firm 
must pay interest on the money that it’s borrowing from these bondholders.
You should be familiar with the three key rating agencies, where you can find 
out what bond analysts think:
 
✓ Standard & Poor’s: Although S&P is well-known for the S&P 500, which 
is a collection of 500 stocks that form the basis for a stock market index 
(a portfolio of stocks for which a change in price is carefully watched), 
the company is also one of the primary bond raters. You can find more 
information at www.standardandpoors.com.
 
✓ Moody’s Investor Service: Moody’s specializes in credit ratings, 
research, and risk analysis, tracking trillions of dollars in debt issued 
in the U.S. and international markets. In addition to its credit-rating ser-
vices, Moody’s publishes investor-oriented credit research, which you 
can access at www.moodys.com.
 
✓ Fitch Ratings: The youngest of the three major bond-rating services is 
Fitch Ratings (www.fitchratings.com). John Knowles Fitch founded 
Fitch Publishing Company in 1913, and the business started as a pub-
lisher of financial statistics. In 1924, Fitch introduced the credit-rating 
scales that are very familiar today: “AAA” to “D.” Fitch is best known for 
its research in the area of complex credit deals and is thought to provide 
more rigorous surveillance than other rating agencies on such deals.
Each bond-rating company has its own alphabetical coding for rating bonds 
and other types of credit issues, such as commercial paper (which are 
shorter-term debt issues than bonds).
Building bond rating’s big guns
Standard & Poor’s is one of the premiere bond-
rating firms. The company’s founder, Henry 
Varnum Poor, built his financial information 
company on the “investor’s right to know.” 
His first attempt at providing this type of finan-
cial information can be found in his 1860 book, 
History of Railroads and Canals of the United 
States, where he included financial information 
about the railroad industry. Today, Standard & 
Poor’s is a leader in independent credit ratings, 
risk evaluation, and investment research.
John Moody started his rating service in 1909 
and was the first to rate public market securi-
ties. He adopted a letter-rating system from the 
mercantile exchange and credit-rating system 
that had been used since the late 1800s. By 1924, 
Moody’s ratings covered nearly 100 percent 
of the U.S. bond market. To this day, Moody’s 
prides itself on ratings based on public informa-
tion and is written by independent analysts who 
don’t answer to the requests of bond issuers.

Any company bonds rated in the “speculative” category or lower are con-
sidered to be junk bonds. Companies in the “best quality” category have the 
lowest interest rates, and interest rates go up as companies’ ratings drop. A 
key job of any firm’s executive team is to feed bond analysts critical financial 
data to keep the firm’s ratings high. Financial reports are one major compo-
nent of that information.
 
Standard & Poor’s (S&P) makes its bond ratings publicly available with links 
on its Web site home page. You can search for information about any com-
pany’s debt ratings.
 
Whenever a change occurs in the ratings, the rating services issue a press 
release with an extensive explanation about why the rating has changed. 
These press releases can be an excellent source of information if you’re look-
ing for opinions on the numbers you see in the financial reports. You can find 
these press releases on the bond-rating companies’ Web sites, as well as in 
news links on financial Web sites.
Delving into Stock Rating
Stock ratings for general public consumption are primarily done by sell-side 
analysts, who seem to err on the side of optimism. You rarely find a stock 
with a sell rating (a recommendation to sell the stock). In fact, when analysts 
testified in Congress after the analyst scandals in the early 2000s (see the 
sidebar “Analyzing the analysts,” earlier in the chapter), one analyst was 

277
 Chapter 21: Checking Out the Analyst-Corporation Connection
heard saying that everybody on Wall Street knows that a hold rating (which 
is intended to mean you should hold the stock, but probably not buy more) 
really means to sell. Some firms use an accumulate rating, which you may 
think means to hold onto the stock or maybe even add more shares, but 
really means to sell in behind-the-scenes circles on Wall Street.
 
Just like with bond ratings, each firm has its own vocabulary when rating 
stocks. A strong buy from one firm may be called a buy in another firm and 
may be on the recommended list in a third firm. You can never know which 
company is right, but after following a firm’s stock ratings for a while, you can 
understand how its systems work and how accurate it is compared with what 
actually happens to the price on the stock market.
Because various companies’ rankings may differ dramatically, you need to 
check out ratings from several different firms and research what each firm 
means by its ratings. A stock that’s rated as a “market outperformer” may 
sound pretty good, but in reality, it’s probably not a good investment, which 
may become clear when you compare rankings of other firms and find that 
they consider the stock a “neutral” or “hold” stock.
 
I don’t put much faith in the stock analyst rating system, and you shouldn’t, 
either. As you start doing independent research on a company after reading 
its financial reports, take everything you read with a grain of salt. Collect all 
the information you can and then do your own analysis. In Part III of this book, 
I show you how to analyze the numbers in financial reports.
Taking a Look at How Companies 
Talk to Analysts
Companies not only send out financial reports to analysts but also talk with 
analysts regularly about the reports. Sometimes you can get access to what’s 
said by listening in to analyst calls or reading press releases. You can also get 
information from road shows, which I briefly describe later in this chapter, 
but you usually don’t have access to them unless you’re a major investor.
Analyst calls
Each time a company releases a new financial report, it usually schedules a 
call with analysts to discuss the results. Usually, these calls include the chief 
executive officer (CEO), president (if not the same as the CEO), and chief 
financial officer (CFO), as well as other top managers.

278
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
Individual investors can listen in on many of these calls between companies 
and analysts. The calls typically start with a statement from one or more of 
the company representatives and then are opened up to listener questions. 
However, as an individual investor, you may not be able to ask any ques-
tions. In most cases, only the analysts, and sometimes the financial press, are 
allowed to ask questions. But even if you can’t ask questions, you can learn a 
lot just by listening.
The biggest advantage of listening to these calls is that analysts ask ques-
tions of the executives that help you focus on the areas of concern in the 
financial reports. Turn to Chapter 22 to find out more about analyst calls.
 
You can find out about upcoming calls or listen to calls already completed at 
two Web sites: VCall (www.vcall.com) and BestCalls (www.bestcalls.com).
In the past, calls between analysts and companies were a way for analysts to 
get insider information about a firm before the news was broadcast to indi-
vidual investors. The SEC stopped that practice in 2000 with a new rule called 
Fair Disclosure (Regulation FD). This rule makes it mandatory for companies 
to inform everyone at the same time about major financial announcements. 
Sometimes analysts find out information in a conversation with officers or 
employees of a corporation during a private interview. If analysts receive 
information that others aren’t aware of, the company must release a press 
release about the information within 24 hours after any company outsider 
gets the information. Regulation FD has certainly leveled the playing field for 
individual investors.
Press releases
Companies often feed information to analysts through press releases. 
Luckily, individual investors can easily access these press releases on finan-
cial Web sites. But remember that press releases are always going to contain 
exactly what the company wants you to know. You need to read between the 
lines and ask questions of the company’s investor relations department if 
something concerns you.
Press reports, which are written after a press release is issued, are probably 
a more important source of information. Companies put out a lot of press 
releases, and not every one makes it into the newspaper as a story. In fact, 
most press releases end up in the garbage because a financial reporter deter-
mines the information isn’t worth a story.

 Chapter 21: Checking Out the Analyst-Corporation Connection
 
You can easily track press releases online. One of my favorite spots for follow-
ing not only a company’s press releases but also any stories mentioning the 
company is Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com). You can find out about 
any recent press coverage for a company by searching the Web site using the 
company’s stock ticker, which is a multi-letter abbreviation for the company’s 
stock. Links to recent press coverage and press releases are shown in a sec-
tion called “Headlines.” If you want to go further back in history, most compa-
nies post at least three years’ worth of press releases in the press section of 
their Web sites.
Road shows
Companies use road shows (which I discuss in greater detail in Chapter 3) to 
introduce new securities issues, such as initial stock or bond offerings. Road 
shows are presentations by the company and its investment bankers to the 
analyst community and other major investors in the hope of building inter-
est in the new public offering. As an individual investor, you’re unlikely to be 
able to attend these shows; invitations are usually reserved only for those 
who can put up significant funding.

How Companies Communicate 
with Shareholders
In This Chapter

▶ Looking at the responsibilities of the board of directors
▶ Keeping abreast of corporate special events
▶ Listening perceptively to analyst calls
▶ Getting information from company Web sites
▶ Investing through company incentive programs
H
appy shareholders don’t necessarily make for a happy company, but 
they’re a good start. Although a company collects most of the money 
generated from stock transactions when the stock is first sold to the public 
during an initial or secondary public offering, shareholders still hold a bit of 
power over management. Angry shareholders showed what their wrath could 
do when their lack of support for Disney CEO Michael Eisner helped oust him 
from the chairmanship of the board in 2004.
Sending out quarterly and annual reports aren’t the only strategies compa-
nies use to keep their shareholders informed and happy. Other activities 
include analyst calls, special meetings, Web site services, e-mails, stock-
investment plans, and individual investor contact. In this chapter, I review 
the steps that companies take to inform their investors of operations and to 
respond to any investor concerns.

Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
Making the Most of Meetings
A company must, at the very least, hold an annual meeting for its share-
holders. These events are often gala affairs that are more like a carefully 
orchestrated pep rally than a place where you can get solid information. The 
company’s top officers make presentations highlighting what they want you 
to know and put on a show that closely resembles what you find in the glossy 
portion of an annual report.
 
The big advantage of being at the company’s annual meeting is that you can 
ask questions, which you can’t do if you just read the financial reports at 
home. Prepare yourself before the meeting by reading the recent financial 
reports, as well as annual reports from the past couple of years, so you’re fully 
armed with details about what has gone on in the past. Make a list of ques-
tions that you want answered by the company’s executives so you’re ready to 
ask them when the opportunity arises. Note that if shareholders are unhappy 
with the corporation’s board or its executives, annual meetings can turn into 
major shouting matches when the floor is opened to questions and comments.
If you’re a shareholder, the company notifies you about the date and loca-
tion of the meeting. In addition to asking questions, shareholders vote on 
any open issues. Almost every annual meeting includes the election of at 
least some members of the board of directors. Most companies stagger the 
election of board members over a number of years so that the entire board 
doesn’t change in one year. Other issues that involve major changes to the 
way the company does business are also voted on, such as a change in exec-
utive compensation.
Sometimes shareholders add their own issues to the agenda. For example, 
environmentalists who own stock in a company may seek a shareholder vote 
on how the company gets rid of its waste (to ensure that controls to protect 
the environment are in place) or how it develops land it owns near a wildlife 
preserve (to be sure wildlife is protected during and after construction).
Sometimes a corporation calls a special meeting if the shareholders must 
vote on a significant issue before the next annual meeting. A possible merger 
is one of the most common events that spur such a special meeting.
 
Innovative companies see annual meetings as a way to communicate effec-
tively with their investor base. The problem for many firms is that most 
shareholders don’t show up. But the Internet can help reach them — some 
companies place all their meeting materials on a Web site, and some compa-
nies also Webcast the meeting itself and archive it for shareholders to watch 
at their leisure.

 Chapter 22: How Companies Communicate with Shareholders
Checking Out How the Board 
Runs the Company
Corporate governance is the way a board of directors conducts its own busi-
ness and oversees a corporation’s operations. Ultimately, the board of direc-
tors is liable for every decision the company makes, but in reality, only major 
shifts in the way the company operates make it to the board for decision. For 
example, if executives recommend that the company take on a new product 
line that would involve a large investment of cash, the board would be con-
sulted for this decision. However, most day-to-day decisions are left to the 
company’s executives and managers.
Watching the directors
The shareholder landscape changed dramatically after the corporate scan-
dals of the 2000s exposed severe corporate governance problems, beginning 
with the collapse of Enron. Today, shareholder groups — many led by insti-
tutional investors such as pension plans and mutual funds that own large 
blocks of shares in various companies — closely watch the following four 
major issues in the companies in which they own shares of stock.
Composition of the board of directors
Shareholder groups monitor the makeup of the board, how board members 
are chosen, and how many members serving on the board are truly indepen-
dent — meaning that they’re not directly involved in the day-to-day opera-
tions of the company. Outsiders prefer that a majority of the board members 
be independent because independent board members can be more objective 
(they aren’t protecting their own jobs and their own income).
CEOs get better raises
Most working Americans would be delighted 
if they received pay raises anywhere near 
the ones that CEOs got in 2007. According to 
Executive Pay Watch, the average total com-
pensation for a Fortune 500 CEO was $14.2 mil-
lion. That’s up from $10.8 million in 2006. You 
can check out how much the CEOs of com-
panies you’re interested in tracking are paid 
at the Executive Pay Watch database, run by 
the AFL-CIO online (www.aflcio.org/
corporatewatch/paywatch/pay/
index.cfm).

284
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
Compensation packages for board members and CEOs
These details are on public record now. In addition, shareholders must 
approve of or be notified of any major benefits or compensation offered to 
the company’s executives, such as stock-option plans (offers to buy company 
stock at prices below market value). Shareholders complain bitterly if they 
believe executives are receiving excessive compensation.
Takeover defenses and protections
In some cases, board members place defenses against the possibility of 
a company takeover. For example, Comcast unsuccessfully attempted a 
hostile takeover of Disney during the battle between shareholders, led by 
Roy Disney, who was attempting to oust Michael Eisner. Sometimes these 
defenses help protect shareholders from a corporate raider who wants to 
buy the company and sell off the pieces, which can leave shareholders with 
stock that’s worth very little. Other times these defenses prevent a takeover 
by some other company that may benefit the shareholders but not the cur-
rent management team and board of directors (especially if the leadership 
ranks would change under the new owners, and they could lose their jobs). 
Shareholder groups watch whatever takeover defenses or protections the 
board puts into place to be sure their best interests are protected, not just 
the best interests of the directors and the management team.
Audits
The primary responsibility of the board of directors is to review the audits 
of the company’s books to be certain that they’re being done accurately 
by both the internal accounting team and the external auditors. Today, 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that independent 
board members make up the audit committees. Prior to the Enron scan-
dal, many audit committees weren’t as independently run, which allowed 
company insiders to control not only how money was spent but also how 
it was recorded in the company’s books and how the financial results were 
reported to outsiders. This insidious practice allowed top executives to more 
easily hide any misdeeds or misuse of funds.
Speaking out at meetings
Shareholders can voice their opinions during annual meetings and during any 
special corporate meetings called by the board of directors to address a spe-
cific issue. At these meetings, shareholders cast weighted votes, called proxy 
votes, based on the number of shares they hold. If board members aren’t 
responsive to shareholder concerns on any of the issues in the preceding list, 
they may find themselves defending a major challenge at the annual meeting.

285
 Chapter 22: How Companies Communicate with Shareholders
Prior to the Enron scandal, a shareholder rarely brought forth an issue for 
the rest of the shareholders to vote on; most often, the corporation’s board 
of directors controlled what the shareholders voted on. If a shareholder 
issue even made it to the point of being voted on by the other shareholders, 
it rarely had a chance of passing. Today, shareholders are more successful at 
getting issues on the agenda to be voted on at an annual meeting; sometimes 
they win the proxy vote, and sometimes they lose.
A proxy fight can cost a corporation millions of dollars no matter who wins, 
as illustrated by Hewlett-Packard’s pricey battle in 2001 and 2002 (see the 
sidebar “Hewlett-Packard’s costly clash”).
Moving away from duking it out
Since the success of the shareholder fight to oust Michel Eisner from the 
chairmanship of Disney’s board of directors in 2004, corporations have been 
finding ways to negotiate with unhappy shareholders rather than fight it out 
in a proxy vote.
To avoid a costly proxy fight, boards of directors negotiate with unhappy 
shareholders by meeting with them quietly behind closed doors and dis-
cussing the issues on which they disagree, with the hope that they can find a 
Hewlett-Packard’s costly clash
Walter Hewlett, son of one of the co-founders 
of Hewlett-Packard, led one of the most costly 
battles against a CEO and a board of directors 
when he tried to stop a merger with Compaq. 
Hewlett lost the fight when the final vote of the 
shareholders ended in approving the merger.
Hewlett reported that he spent $32 million on 
his attempt to stop the merger. Financial ana-
lysts speculate that Hewlett-Packard’s board 
of directors, led by CEO Carly Fiorina, spent 
at least twice that much on advertising in the 
major media markets where most of Hewlett-
Packard’s shareholders live, plus on other 
actions, to defend its merger decision.
In addition to the costly advertising, Hewlett-
Packard’s board racked up about $70 million in 
expenses to defend its merger decision, includ-
ing an estimated $3 million to individually call 
its shareholders and another $25 million in mail-
ings to its shareholders. Hewlett-Packard also 
paid $33.5 million to investment banker Goldman 
Sachs, which handled the merger deal. Analysts 
guesstimate that Hewlett-Packard’s total cost 
for this fiasco was $100 million to $125 million, 
and a good portion of that money was neces-
sary only because of the shareholder battle.

286
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
solution that both sides can accept. If the shareholders and the board fail to 
find common ground, a proxy fight is likely. Knowing that a proxy fight can 
cost millions, more corporations are wising up to the fact that they should 
listen to their shareholders.
One of the major leaders of proxy fights are large institutional shareholders, 
along with the help of other state retirement systems and some mutual funds. 
These large institutional investors hold large blocks of stock in their pension 
or mutual-fund portfolios, so they have a lot to lose if a company doesn’t do 
what they believe it should do.
Many times, the issues include how the board of directors operates and how 
many independent directors serve on the board and its various committees, 
particularly the audit committee. New rules about independent directors 
were adopted after the Enron scandal. Under revised SEC Rule 10A-3, a public 
company must appoint independent directors to the audit committee, and 
the committee must establish procedures for complaints regarding account-
ing, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, including procedures 
for employees to confidentially and anonymously submit concerns regarding 
questionable accounting or auditing issues.
Sorting through Reports
Mailing out reports on an annual and quarterly basis is the primary way a cor-
poration informs its shareholders about its performance. Usually, the corpora-
tion mails the annual report before the annual meeting, along with information 
on the proxy votes that will take place at the meeting. Proxy information is a 
critical part of the annual report package, as voting by proxy is the primary 
way shareholders get to voice their position on board decisions.
The mailing also includes information about the board’s position on any 
issues that will be presented at the annual meeting. If the board brings an 
issue to the shareholders for a vote, the board explains the issue and its posi-
tion. If a group other than the board brings the issue to the shareholders, the 
board states the issue and discusses why it’s in favor of or opposed to the 
issue. In most cases, the board opposes issues brought by outside sources.
An outside group raising or opposing an issue is also likely to mail its posi-
tion to the shareholders. In fact, Walter Hewlett spent about $15 million 
mailing information to Hewlett-Packard shareholders in an attempt to stop 
the merger with Compaq, which I discuss in the earlier sidebar “Hewlett-
Packard’s costly clash.”

287
 Chapter 22: How Companies Communicate with Shareholders
Catching Up on Corporate Actions
Corporations must report special events to their shareholders as soon as the 
event can materially impact the company’s results (affect the profits or losses 
of the company). The most common special events include:
 
✓ Acquisitions: Before a company can finalize plans to acquire another 
company, it must report those plans to its shareholders.
 
✓ Class-action lawsuits: If a company is the defendant in a class-action 
lawsuit that can have a material impact on its results in the future, the 
company must report the lawsuit and discuss its potential impact with 
shareholders.
 
✓ Mergers: If two firms plan on merging, the firms’ management must 
inform their shareholders and also ask them to vote on the merger. If 
shareholders in either company vote against the merger, the deal will 
probably be cancelled. Sometimes, companies may revise the deal and 
attempt a second shareholder vote.
 
✓ Dividends: Whenever the board decides to pay dividends, it has to 
report that information to the shareholders. Of course, dividends are 
one of the few things that boards enjoy reporting, so they usually 
make a very public announcement to shareholders about the dividend 
payments.
 
✓ SEC investigation: If a company discovers that the SEC is investigat-
ing it, the company must report this knowledge to its shareholders in a 
timely manner.
 
✓ Stock splits: A stock split is when the board decides to make one share of 
stock worth more than one share. For example, a stock split may be two 
shares for one, which means that each shareholder gets two shares of 
stock for each share that he holds. Most times, a company announces a 
stock split when it believes the price of its stock has gotten too high for 
the market. So a stock that sells for $100 before a two-for-one stock split 
will sell for $50 a share after the split.
 
In short, a company must give its shareholders the lowdown on anything that 
materially impacts the business’s value. In fact, companies must report to 
the public and to financial analysts within 24 hours of telling any company 
outsider about a major event, such as the ones I list in this section, that could 
impact a company’s net income materially.

Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
Culling Information from Analyst Calls
Today, investors get information not only by reading press releases or news-
papers but also by attending company calls for analysts, which used to be 
open only to financial analysts and institutional investors. Companies usu-
ally sponsor these calls when they release their annual or quarterly earnings 
reports. But special events — such as a change in company leadership or 
the purchase of another business — can also prompt companies to set up 
analyst calls. By listening in on these calls, you usually get more details about 
whatever issues are being discussed.
The company CEO, president, and chief financial officer (CFO) typically par-
ticipate in these calls. They usually start the call by discussing the recently 
released financial reports or by explaining the impact that the special event 
has on the company; then they usually open the call to questions.
The question-and-answer part of the call is often the most revealing, as you 
can judge how confident senior managers are about the financial information 
they’re reporting. Questions from the audience usually elicit information that 
press releases or the annual or quarterly reports haven’t revealed. Most times, 
analysts and institutional investors ask the questions; in many situations, 
Introducing fair disclosure
Today, the SEC requires that a company release 
all information that can significantly impact its 
financial position to shareholders and analysts 
at the same time or within a reasonable period 
(usually 24 hours) after the first company out-
sider gets the information. This practice began 
in 2000 after the adoption of the Fair Disclosure 
Rule (Regulation FD), which mandates open 
disclosure to everyone as soon as possible 
after one person outside the company gets the 
information. The information can be something 
as simple as the expected net income for the 
quarter or something as dramatic as the deci-
sion to buy another company.
Prior to the SEC rule calling for fair disclosure, 
companies often told financial analysts several 
days before the general public about upcom-
ing key events or other financial data. When 
this occurred, the analysts could tell key inves-
tors who depended on their analysis (and, by 
the way, paid them big bucks for their services) 
to buy or sell stocks before the general public 
even knew anything about what was happen-
ing. Individual investors could lose a major part 
of their stake in the company before they even 
knew what was driving the stock price down. 
Regulation FD killed that practice and leveled 
the playing field for individual investors. Today, 
individual investors must get information at the 
same time that analysts and portfolio manag-
ers for large institutions (such as pension and 
mutual funds) do.

289
 Chapter 22: How Companies Communicate with Shareholders
individual investors don’t have an opportunity to ask questions at all, but you 
can still learn a lot by listening to these conversations. And don’t hesitate to 
write or call the company’s investor relations department to get an answer to a 
specific question you may have about the financial report or the special event 
discussed during an analyst call.
 
The language participants use in an analyst call is different from the language 
you use every day. Familiarize yourself with the most commonly used terms 
before listening to your first call. I list most of the key terms and abbrevia-
tions used during analyst calls in Part III of this book, where I discuss analyz-
ing the numbers. Get comfortable with terms like earnings per share (EPS), 
EPS growth, net income, cash, and cash equivalents. Check out the sidebar 
“Decoding analyst-call-speak” for more on analyst-call lingo.
 
If you hear a term you don’t understand, write it down and research it after 
the call. Then the next time you listen in on one of these calls, you’ll have a 
better understanding of what’s being discussed.
Listening between the lines
Pay attention to how the executives handle the call and to the words they 
use. When management is pleased with the results, you usually hear very 
upbeat terms, and they talk about how positive things look for the company’s 
future. When management is disappointed with the numbers, they’re more 
apologetic, and the mood of the call is more low-key. Rather than talk about 
a rosy future, they’ll probably explain ways in which they can improve the 
disappointing results.
 
You most likely need to listen to more than one call hosted by a particular 
company before you start picking up the nuances and moods of the execu-
tives. Try attending as many of these calls as you can or listening to a record-
ing of a call after it occurs. Many companies actually post recordings of their 
analyst calls on their Web sites, just like they post press releases.
Take the time to read the financial reports before the call so you’re at least 
familiar with the key points that management discusses during the call. After 
you listen to a few calls for the same company, you’ll find that the informa-
tion that management discusses will become much clearer.
Earnings expectations
All calls about a company’s financial results include information about 
whether the firm has met its own earnings projections or the projections 
of financial analysts. If a company misses its own earnings projections, the 
mood of the call will be downbeat, and the stock price is likely to drop dra-
matically after the call.

290
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
 
That doesn’t mean you must sell the shares you own, if you happen to be a 
shareholder. In fact, if you’re listening to the call because you think you’d like 
to buy the stock, you may want to do so after the stock price is driven down 
by the bad news. The key for you as a shareholder or potential shareholder is 
to analyze what’s being said and whether you think the company has a good 
chance of turning around the bad news. Good news, on the other hand, can 
drive the stock price higher. Be careful not to jump on the bandwagon right 
after major good news is announced. Usually, the stock price falls back down 
to a more realistic price after the initial rush to buy is completed.
Revenue growth
Listen for information about the company’s revenue growth and whether it 
has kept pace with its earnings growth. Growth in revenue is the key to con-
tinued earnings growth in the future. During an economic slowdown, watch-
ing revenue growth becomes very important because a company can play 
with revenue numbers to make them look better. In fact, some companies 
practice what’s called window dressing (using accounting tricks to make a 
company’s financial statements look better) to make sure their earnings meet 
Decoding analyst-call-speak
In addition to the financial terms I use through-
out this book, you’re likely to hear a few color-
ful descriptions when listening in on an analyst 
call, such as the following:
 ✓ Hockey stick: Management may say that 
company revenue came in like a hockey 
stick, meaning that most of the revenue 
occurred in the final days of the quarter. In 
this situation, the revenue charts actually 
look like a hockey stick because they’re flat 
most of the month and then shoot up in the 
last few days. Listen for explanations about 
why sales jump up at the end of a month 
or quarter. It may be normal for the type 
of business or it may be related to some 
outside factor, such as a storm that closed 
stores for part of the month.
 ✓ Lumpy: Senior management refers to 
uneven sales in a given quarter as being 
lumpy. During some weeks, the order rates 
were low, and during other weeks, the 
order rates were high; these results make 
the revenue charts look lumpy. If you hear 
this term, listen for explanations about why 
sales were lumpy and whether this result is 
normal for the company.
 ✓ Run-rate: Senior management uses the 
term run-rate when talking about how to 
project a company’s current performance 
over a period of time. For example, if the 
current quarter’s revenue shows a $1 mil-
lion monthly run-rate, you can expect the 
annual revenue to total $12 million. This type 
of projection may work for firms with steady 
earnings, but it doesn’t work for businesses 
that have primarily seasonal products. For 
example, if a retail company reports a run-
rate for the fourth quarter that includes hol-
iday sales of $1 million per month, you can’t 
expect that performance to carry over for 
the entire year. So you must be certain that 
you understand a company’s revenue pic-
ture before counting on run-rate numbers.

291
 Chapter 22: How Companies Communicate with Shareholders
expectations. Earnings growth is easier to manipulate than revenue, so earn-
ings usually become part of that window dressing. I talk more in Chapter 23 
about how a company can manipulate its results.
 
If you hear numerous questions from the analysts about revenue-growth fig-
ures, it may be a sign that they suspect a problem with the numbers or are 
very disappointed with the results. When you hear analysts’ questions about 
revenue or any other issues over and over again, take a closer look at these 
numbers yourself. Do further analysis and research before you decide to buy 
or sell the company’s stock.
Analysts’ moods
Listen carefully to the analysts’ tone as they ask their questions. Take time 
to assess their moods. Do they seem downbeat? Are they asking very prob-
ing questions, or are they upbeat and congratulating the executives on their 
performance? When analysts are disappointed with a company’s results, they 
dig for more information and ask for more details about the areas where they 
see a problem. The call’s discussion focuses on past results and how manage-
ment can improve future results. When analysts are happy with the results, 
they encourage further discussion about future results and plans.
You may find it difficult to judge the mood of the analysts or company execu-
tives when you listen to your first call, but as you listen to more and more 
calls for the same company, you’ll be able to judge more easily how the mood 
differs from that of previous calls.
Getting the facts right
You can judge whether the executives are confident in their reporting by 
how quickly they answer the questions. When executives are comfortable 
and confident in the numbers, they answer questions quickly, without rus-
tling through papers. If they’re very cautious with their answers and are 
constantly taking time to look through their papers, you can be sure they’re 
not comfortable with the report and must carefully check themselves before 
answering the questions.
 
If company executives seem unsure or respond slowly, take this as a red flag 
that you need to do a lot more homework before making any decisions about 
buying or selling that company’s stock.
Looking toward the future
Listen to the vision that the company’s executives portray for the future. Does 
the vision they present inspire you, or are they unclear about their vision for 
the company’s future and how they plan to get there? If you find the execu-
tives uninspiring, they may not be doing a good job of inspiring their employ-
ees, either. If you see a downward trend in the company, this may be one of 
the reasons for that trend. When executives lack inspiration for the company’s 
future, you have a good reason to stay away from investing in that firm.

292
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
Employee satisfaction
Keeping employees happy is important for the future of any company. During 
the call, you can judge whether employees are satisfied by listening for infor-
mation about the success or failure the company’s having attracting new 
employees or retaining existing ones. If the business reports a problem with 
either of these two things, trouble may be on the horizon. High employee 
turnover is bad for the growth of any company, and a firm that has trouble 
finding and recruiting qualified employees may also face a difficult future.
 
Don’t ever plan to buy or sell stock based only on what you hear during ana-
lyst calls. Use the calls as one more way to gather information about a stock 
that you’re thinking of buying or for tracking stocks that you already own.
Knowing when to expect analyst calls
To find out when a company plans to host an analyst call, check out the 
investor relations section of its Web site. Some companies may just post a 
recording of the call on their Web site. A few companies don’t even mention 
the calls at all; in this case, you can call the investor relations department 
and ask them if you can attend their analyst calls. Some firms do ban inves-
tors from analyst calls.
 
Some companies offer investors a service that alerts them to upcoming 
events. If the companies you plan to follow don’t offer these services, your 
best way of tracking upcoming analyst calls is through one of two Web sites: 
Best Calls (www.bestcalls.com) and VCall (www.vcall.com).
Staying Up to Date Using 
Company Web Sites
The Internet provides an excellent way for companies to stay in touch with 
their investors. Companies can include an unlimited number of pages on Web 
sites that investors can access whenever it’s convenient for them. Because 
investors can print multiple copies of the information provided online for 
free, businesses can save the expense of providing thousands of pages of 
information to their investors.

293
 Chapter 22: How Companies Communicate with Shareholders
 
In addition to basic information — such as company headquarters, mailing 
address, phone numbers, and key executives — many companies post their 
firm’s history, market share, vision and mission statements, credit ratings, and 
stock dividend history. Many companies also post all the information from 
their annual meetings, financial reports, press releases, and key executives’ 
speeches, as well as allowing investors to order paper copies of previous 
annual and quarterly reports up to five years old. So the Internet is a handy 
tool that gives investors greater access to company activities and helps the 
firm keep its investors better informed — which improves the company’s long-
term relations with its investors.
Regarding Reinvestment Plans
Another way a company can build better relations with its investors is to 
offer them stock directly so they can avoid broker costs on every share 
they buy. Some companies offer their investors dividend-reinvestment 
plans and direct-stock-purchase plans. Both plans provide companies effec-
tive ways to maintain direct contact with their shareholders instead of 
going through a broker.
Dividend-reinvestment plans
Dividend-reinvestment plans give current investors a way to automatically 
reinvest any dividends toward the purchase of new shares of stock. In order 
to take advantage of this plan, a shareholder must register her stock directly 
with the company rather than open an account with a broker.
Shareholders can reinvest all or just part of their dividends through the 
reinvestment plans. Many times, these plans offer investors the opportunity 
to buy additional shares by using cash, check, or a debit that’s automati-
cally taken from the investor’s bank account. This option gives small inves-
tors a way to steadily increase their ownership in the company. Many firms 
also allow investors to access their dividend-reinvestment plan on the com-
pany Web site, making maintaining accounts and managing transactions 
even easier.

Direct-stock-purchase plans
Through direct-stock-purchase plans, companies can offer stock directly to 
the public so that investors don’t have to contact a broker to purchase 
even the first share of stock. Prior to these programs, investors had to 
buy stock through a broker before they could participate in a dividend-
reinvestment plan.
Today, shareholders can buy all their stock directly from a company, if it 
offers the service, and avoid paying any broker fees. Direct-stock-purchase 
plans also provide the same features as dividend-reinvestment plans, such 
as the ability to reinvest dividends.
 
Depending on how a company sets up its program, the shareholder or the 
company may pay the direct-stock-purchase plan’s fees. Some companies 
offer this service for free; others charge a fee for every transaction, which 
can amount to more than what a broker would charge. Be sure you under-
stand the fees involved if you buy directly from a company, and compare 
those fees with the cost of buying through your broker to make sure that 
you’re getting a good deal.

ompanies cooking the books — and I don’t mean throwing them in a 
raging fire in disgust — fuel an ongoing game of hide-and-seek among 
company outsiders that results in millions, and sometimes billions, of dol-
lars of losses for investors every year. In some cases, company insiders use 
numerous tactics to deceive their shareholders and pad their own pockets. 
The mortgage mess in 2007, where mortgage-related securities were held off 
the books, destroyed the stock value of many major financial institutions, 
such as Citigroup and Merrill Lynch.
Throughout most of this book, I concentrate on reading financial reports that 
accurately portray the financial status of a company, but unfortunately, that 
isn’t always the case. The pressure companies face to meet the quarterly 
expectations of Wall Street drive many firms to play with their numbers. 
When expectations aren’t met, the company’s stock price is beaten down, 
which lowers the company’s market value. Sometimes, this game to meet 
expectations goes beyond legal methods to fraud and deception.
In this chapter, I review the primary tools that companies use to hide their 
financial problems and to deceive the public and the government.

Getting to the Bottom of 
Creative Accounting
Enron, once the world’s largest energy trader, now lives in infamy as the 
host of one of the world’s largest accounting scandals. After the company 
declared bankruptcy in 2001, Congress enacted legislation to correct the 
flaws in the U.S. financial reporting system and protect investors and con-
sumers from misleading accounting practices. But corporate lobbyists are 
powerful, and Congress continues to get pressure to weaken the legislation 
passed after the Enron scandal because the companies think the new laws 
are too burdensome.
In the meantime, the public’s faith in corporate financial accounting has 
taken a nose dive, in large part because of the glut of creative accounting 
that came to light during the late 1990s and continued to rear its ugly head 
in 2007 during the latest scandals related to the mortgage mess. Companies 
that practice creative accounting deviate from generally accepted account-
ing principles (GAAP). The financial reports they issue use loopholes in 
financial laws in ways that are, at the very least, misleading, and in some 
cases illegal, to gain an advantage for the company over the users of those 
financial reports.
Defining the scope of the problem
In the hundreds of cases where companies restated their earnings (that is, 
when companies changed the numbers they originally reported to the gen-
eral public to correct “accounting errors”), company insiders used creative 
accounting techniques to cook the books. And when trying to unearth the 
accounting problem, you have to be creative yourself.
In these scandals, some company insiders used corporate accounts for 
personal purposes, such as buying expensive cars or numerous houses and 
taking luxury trips — all at the expense of shareholders. Rather than using 
profits to grow the company and increase the stock’s value for the stockhold-
ers, these insiders lined their own pockets. How’d they get away with that? 
Well, most board members were closely tied to the corporate chiefs, which 
means that no one was really watching the cookie jar — or the hands going 
into it. In some cases, these close ties were members of the same family who 
wouldn’t question their father or brother. In other cases, the board members 
were close friends and didn’t want to question a buddy. You can find more 
details about these scandals in Chapter 24.

297
 Chapter 23: Keeping Score When Companies Play Games with Numbers
 
Company insiders use different techniques to cook the books. In some cases, 
earnings are managed, meaning that companies use legitimate accounting 
methods in aggressive ways to get the bottom-line results they need. Other 
companies present revenues that are pure fiction. Still others toy with how 
they handle their capital financing, or overvalue their assets, or undervalue 
their liabilities. Those who want to deceive company outsiders can use a vari-
ety of these tactics.
Recipes for cooked books
Former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Arthur Levitt 
groups these creative techniques — which he calls “accounting hocus-
pocus” — into the following five categories.
 
I discuss how company insiders use these various techniques, but too often, 
you don’t find out about the deception until someone inside the company 
decides to blow the whistle or the company seeks bankruptcy protection.
Big-bath charges
Company insiders use this technique to clean up their balance sheet by 
giving it a “big bath,” meaning they wash away past financial problems. 
When earnings take a big hit, some executives hope that Wall Street will look 
beyond a one-time loss and focus on future earnings.
A good time to use this practice is when the company decides to restructure 
some parts of its business — for example, when two divisions of a company 
merge or a single division is split into two. During the restructuring process, 
executives can clean up any problems in previous reporting. This cleaning 
process may include hiding past financial reporting problems. The account-
ing problems washed off the books can be deliberate or nondeliberate 
accounting errors made during previous reporting periods.
Creative acquisition accounting
Levitt also calls this category “merger magic” because it includes the tech-
nique in which companies use acquisitions to hide their problems. It’s par-
ticularly useful when the acquisition is merely a stock exchange rather than a 
cash exchange. By setting a stock price for an acquisition that enables a com-
pany to hide previous problems, a lot of past accounting problems can disap-
pear like magic because the higher stock price can cover up the problems, 
such as previous losses that were not accurately reported. Most times, com-
pany insiders can erase the problems in a popular write-off called in-process 
research and development, which is a one-time charge mentioned in the notes 
to the financial statements detailing an acquisition. Getting rid of problems 
with this charge removes any future earnings drag, and future earnings state-
ments look better.

298
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
Miscellaneous cookie-jar reserves
Companies that use liabilities rather than revenue to hide problems do so 
by using what Levitt calls “cookie jars.” When using this technique, company 
insiders make unrealistic assumptions about company liabilities. In a good 
year, a firm assumes that its sales returns will be much higher than they have 
been historically. These higher assumptions are “banked” as a liability, which 
means they’re added to an accrual account that can be adjusted in a later 
year. When a business has a bad year and needs to manage its earnings, it 
can massage those earnings by reducing the actual sales returns, using some 
of the banked sales returns from the cookie jar.
Materiality
In accounting, the generally accepted principle is to report only financial 
matters that can have a material effect on a company’s earnings. Whether an 
item has a material effect on the company’s bottom line is purely a judgment 
call made by company executives and the auditors. For example, a $1 million 
loss in inventory may have a material effect on a company’s bottom line if the 
company’s total profits are $10 million. But that same million-dollar loss for 
a company that reports multibillion-dollar earnings may not be considered 
material because that loss has less impact on the company’s bottom line.
Firms that play the materiality game set a percentage ceiling under which 
errors don’t matter because they’re not material. For example, the multibil-
lion-dollar company may decide that as long as errors reflect less than 5 per-
cent of any department’s revenues, the error isn’t material to the company’s 
results. But those little errors can add up when spread carefully across a 
firm’s financial reports. Sometimes small errors can help a business make up 
for the one or two cent loss per share that may miss Wall Street expectations 
and cause the stock price to drop. Any time a company misses Wall Street 
expectations — even by pennies — the stock price takes a drop, and the 
company’s overall value on the market may also fall by millions of dollars.
Revenue recognition
Companies using this technique boost their earnings by manipulating the 
way they count sales. For example, these companies recognize a sale before 
it’s complete or count something as sold even though the customer still has 
options to terminate, void, or delay the sale.
Unearthing the Games 
Played with Earnings
All companies manage earnings to a certain extent because they want their 
bottom lines to look as good as possible, and they use whatever accounting 
method gets them there. For example, a company can improve its earnings by 

299
 Chapter 23: Keeping Score When Companies Play Games with Numbers
using different methods for valuing assets and costs. As I discuss in Chapter 
9, the accounting policies and methods that a company uses can have a great 
impact on its bottom line.
 
In accrual accounting, revenue is recognized when it’s earned (when the sale 
of the product or service is complete and payment for the product or ser-
vice is due), and expenses are recognized when they’re incurred (when the 
purchase is complete, even if cash has not yet been paid). See Chapter 4 for 
more details. Cash doesn’t have to change hands for revenue to be earned or 
expenses incurred. The key is whether the revenue is actually earned and the 
expenses are actually incurred or if a company is reporting them prematurely 
or fictitiously.
The generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP; see Chapter 18) that 
govern reporting practices are pretty flexible. Managing earnings becomes 
abusive when it involves using tricks that actually distort a company’s true 
financial picture to present the desired view to outsiders. And the games 
that companies play along those lines are numerous. The only limit to these 
games is the creativity of those who manage the company’s finances.
Companies usually play with numbers that impact revenue recognition or 
expense recognition. That’s really the bottom line for any company: the 
amount of revenue that a company takes in or the amount of expenses that it 
pays out in order to generate that revenue. All the other numbers that a com-
pany reports are based on either its revenue or its expenses.
Reading between the revenue lines
In this section, I cover the gamut of revenue recognition games, from slight 
misrepresentations to gross exaggerations. Unfortunately, many of these 
problems are difficult for readers who are company outsiders to find. Still, 
if you’re an investor, you need to be familiar with the terms I discuss in this 
section so you can understand news reports about problems that may exist 
inside a company.
Goods ordered but not shipped
In some cases, a company considers goods that have been ordered but not 
yet shipped to be part of its revenue earned. In the long term, this system 
can create not only an accounting nightmare but also a nightmare for manag-
ers throughout the company. Orders can get severely backlogged, and ulti-
mately, the company may have a lot of problems satisfying its customers.
Additionally, this practice can have a big impact on a company’s bottom 
line. Accrual accounting is specifically designed to match revenue with 
expenses each accounting period. As more and more goods build up that 
are ordered but not shipped, financial reports overstate the firm’s revenue 

300
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
and understate expenses until the deception is exposed. Eventually, the firm 
will have to admit its game-playing and restate its net income, which will 
likely result in a profit reduction or possibly even a loss.
Executives and managers just delay the inevitable when they practice this 
game. Some do it to maintain their bonuses as long as possible. Others do it 
because they don’t want to face the reality of the company’s financial posi-
tion. And I’m sure that companies make many more excuses when the game 
is finally exposed.
Goods shipped but not ordered
Some companies get even more aggressive with their deception, count-
ing goods that they’ve shipped but that customers haven’t ordered yet. 
Companies that use this technique commonly ship items for inspection or 
demonstration purposes in the hope that customers will buy the product. 
This tactic can help a company meet its revenue for the upcoming reporting 
period because it counts these unordered goods as sales, even though the 
products haven’t really been sold. However, if some customers receive the 
goods, decide not to purchase them, and return the merchandise, the com-
pany must subtract these sales from its revenue during the next period.
As the problem snowballs, the company has to ship more and more orders 
without actually having the sales to meet its revenue expectations. Each 
month it has to reverse a greater percentage of its revenue, and as a result, 
it has to make up the shortfall by shipping an even greater number of units 
without actual orders. Eventually, the company won’t be able to keep up the 
deceptive practices and will have to correct its financial statements, lower-
ing the amount it reported as revenue and reducing its net income. That will 
likely send shockwaves through the stock market, and the stock price will 
drop dramatically.
Extended reporting period
Some companies try to meet Wall Street’s revenue expectations by keep-
ing their books open for a few days — or even a few weeks — into the next 
reporting period in order to generate last-minutes sales. This tactic eventu-
ally creates major financial reporting problems for the company because 
it takes the sales from what should have been reported as income during 
the next reporting period. Eventually, the company has to reveal its decep-
tive practices because it has to leave its books open longer and longer each 
period to meet the next period’s expectations.
Pure fiction
The most outrageous acts are the ones that involve reporting purely fictional 
sales. How do companies do this? Well, they recognize revenue for sales 
that were never ordered and never shipped. Company insiders fill financial 

301
 Chapter 23: Keeping Score When Companies Play Games with Numbers
records with false order, billing, and shipping information. Eventually, the 
lack of actual cash forces the company to reveal its games, and the business 
will probably go bankrupt.
Channel stuffing
Channel stuffing is a way for companies to get more products out of their 
manufacturing warehouses and onto distributors’ and retailers’ shelves. The 
most common method is to offer distributors large discounts so that they 
stock up on products. Distributors buy more product than they expect to sell 
because they can get it so much cheaper. Then distributors sell the product 
to their customers; however, several months or even a year may pass before 
they sell all the products. If the products don’t sell, in some cases companies 
are given the right to return the product.
Although this strategy is a legitimate type of revenue, it will come back to 
haunt the company in later accounting periods, when distributors have so 
much product on their shelves that they don’t need to order more. At some 
point in the future, new orders drop, which means fewer sales and a drop in 
revenue reported on the income statement. Less revenue translates to lower 
net income, which will be seen as a bad sign by Wall Street, and the stock 
price will take a dive.
Side letters
Sometimes companies make agreements with their regular customers outside 
the actual documentation used for the corporate reporting of revenue. This 
agreement is called a side letter. The side letter involves the company and 
customer changing terms behind the scenes, such as allowing more liberal 
rights of return or rights to cancel orders at any time that can, essentially, 
kill the sale. Sometimes these agreements go as far as excusing the customer 
from paying for the goods.
In all cases, the side letter terms eventually result in turning revenue that 
was recognized on a previous income statement into a nonsale, either by 
the return of goods or the extension of credit beyond a 12-month payment 
period. This practice makes revenue from these sales look better initially, but 
the revenue is later subtracted when the goods are returned.
Rights of return
Giving customers liberal return rights is another way of getting them to order 
goods, even when they’re not sure if they’ll be able to resell them. By offer-
ing distributors or retailers terms that allow them to order goods for resale 
that they can return as much as 12 months later if they don’t sell, the sales, in 
essence, aren’t really sales and shouldn’t be recognized as revenue on a com-
pany’s financial report. Rights of return are offered to most customers, but 
when payment for goods depends on the need for the distributor or retailer 
to first resell the goods, the recognition of that revenue is questionable.

302
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
Related-party revenue
Related-party revenue comes from a company selling goods to another entity 
in which the seller controls the management of operating policies. For exam-
ple, if the parent company of a tissue manufacturer sells the raw materials 
needed for manufacturing that tissue to its subsidiary, the parent company 
can’t count that sale of raw materials as revenue. Whenever one party to the 
transaction can control or significantly influence the decision of the entity 
that wants to buy the goods, a company can’t recognize the sale as revenue.
 
These related-party sales don’t meet the SEC’s requirement for an arm’s-length 
transaction, which is a transaction that involves a buyer and a seller who can 
act independently of each other and have no relationship to each other. The 
SEC does require that companies recognize only sales with third parties that 
are at arm’s length and that can’t be controlled by the party planning to recog-
nize the sale as revenue. Companies aren’t permitted to record sales to their 
affiliates or other related entities as part of their recognized revenues.
Bill-and-hold transactions
Sometimes a buyer places an order but asks the company to hold onto the 
goods until it has room in its store or warehouse. So the company has sold 
the goods but hasn’t shipped them yet. This sale is called a bill-and-hold 
transaction.
 
The SEC has a set of criteria that a company must meet in order for it to recog-
nize revenue for items it hasn’t shipped yet. These include:
 
✓ That the seller passes the risks of ownership to the buyer: This cri-
terion means that if anything happens to the goods while the seller is 
holding them, the loss is the buyer’s responsibility, not the seller’s.
 
✓ That the customer makes a fiscal commitment to purchase the goods: 
This commitment should preferably occur in writing.
 
✓ That the buyer, not the seller, requests the bill-and-hold transaction: 
The buyer must have a business purpose, such as planning a future 
sales event and not wanting to receive the goods until just before the 
event, to justify ordering the goods on a buy-and-hold basis.
 
✓ That the buyer and seller set up a fixed schedule for the delivery of 
the goods: Determining dates for delivery indicates that the sale is real 
rather than a scam.
 
✓ That the seller separate the ordered goods from its inventory so it 
won’t use the goods to fill other orders: If it doesn’t clearly separate 
these goods and hold them, the company can’t prove that the goods 
were actually bought, so the sale can’t be counted.
 
✓ That the seller has the goods complete and ready for shipment: Only 
goods being held and ready for shipment can be counted as a sale.

303
 Chapter 23: Keeping Score When Companies Play Games with Numbers
Upfront service fees
Companies that collect upfront service fees for services that they provide 
over a long period of time, such as 12, 24, 36, or 60 months, must be care-
ful about how they recognize this revenue. If the company collects fees to 
service equipment upfront, these fees can’t be counted as revenue when the 
money is collected. The SEC requires that such companies recognize their 
revenue over time as the fees are earned. Companies that recognize this type 
of revenue all at once are prematurely recognizing revenue.
Detecting creative revenue accounting
With so many tricks up so many corporate sleeves, you may feel that you’re 
at the mercy of the tricksters. You can get to the bottom of many of the 
common creative accounting tactics by carefully reading and analyzing the 
financial reports, but you’ll have to play detective and crunch some numbers.
Reviewing revenue recognition policies
The financial report section called the notes to the financial statements is a 
good source for finding out at what point a company actually recognizes 
a sale as revenue. Some companies recognize revenue before they deliver 
the product or before they perform the service. If you come across this sce-
nario, try to find details in the notes to the financial statements that indicate 
how the company really earned its revenue. If you can’t, call the company’s 
investor relations department to clarify its revenue-recognition policies, and 
be sure that you understand why it may be justified in recognizing revenue 
before delivery or performance has been completed.
When a firm indicates in the notes to the financial statements that it recog-
nizes revenue at the time of delivery or performance, that timing may seem 
perfect to you, but you must look further to find other policies that may 
negate a sale. Dig deeper into the revenue-recognition section of the notes to 
find out what the company’s rights-of-return policy is and how it determines 
pricing. Some companies may allow a price adjustment or have a liberal 
return policy that may cancel out the sale.
 
Take note if you find that the company recently changed its revenue-
recognition policies. Just the fact that the company is changing those policies 
can be a red flag. Many times this change comes about because the firm 
is having difficulty meeting its Wall Street expectations. It may decide to 
recognize revenue earlier in the sales process, which could mean that more 
of this revenue reported on the income statement may have to be subtracted 
in later reporting periods. Scour the revenue-recognition section of the finan-
cial report until you understand how the change impacts the company’s 
revenue recognition. You may want to review the annual reports from the past 
few years to compare the old revenue policies with the new ones.

304
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
Evaluating revenue results
Reported revenue results for the current period don’t tell the whole finan-
cial story. You need to review the revenue results for the past five quarters 
(at least) or past three years to see whether any inexplicable swings in sea-
sonal activity exist. For example, extremely high numbers for retail outlets 
in the last quarter of the year (October to December) aren’t unusual. Many 
retailers make about 40 percent of their profits during that quarter due to 
holiday sales.
 
Be sure you understand the fluctuations in revenue for the company you’re 
investigating and how its results compare with those of similar companies 
and the industry as a whole. If you see major shifts in revenue results that 
normal seasonal differences can’t explain, an alarm should go off in your head. 
Take the time to further investigate the reason for these differences by read-
ing reports by analysts who cover the company and by calling the company’s 
investor relations office.
Monitoring accounts receivable
Accounts receivable tracks customers who buy on credit. You want to be 
sure that customers are promptly paying for their purchases, so closely 
watch the trend in accounts receivable. In Chapter 16, I show you how to 
calculate accounts receivable turnover. Compare the turnover ratio, which 
measures how quickly customers pay their bills, for at least the past five 
quarters to see whether a major change or trend has occurred. If you notice 
that customers are taking longer to pay their bills, it can be a sign that the 
company is having trouble collecting money, but it can also indicate revenue 
management. Either way, this should raise a red flag for you as a financial 
report reader.
While you’re investigating, check the percentage rate of change for accounts 
receivable versus the percentage rate of change for net revenue over the 
same period. For example, if the balance in accounts receivable increases 
by 10 percent and net revenues increase by 25 percent, that may be a sign of 
game-playing. Normally, these two accounts increase and decrease by similar 
percentages year to year unless the company offers its customers a signifi-
cant change in credit policies. If you see significant differences between these 
two accounts, it may be another sign of revenue management.
 
Check to see if the changes you’re seeing match trends for similar companies 
or the industry as a whole. If not, ask investor relations people to explain 
what’s behind the differences. If you don’t like the answers or can’t get 
answers that make sense to you, don’t buy the stock, or consider selling the 
stock you already have.

305
 Chapter 23: Keeping Score When Companies Play Games with Numbers
Assessing physical capacity
Evaluating physical capacity, the number of facilities the company has and 
the amount of product the company can manufacture, is another way to 
judge whether or not the company is accurately reporting revenue. You need 
to find out if the firm truly has the physical capacity to generate the revenue 
that it’s reporting. You do so by comparing the following ratios:
 
✓ Revenue per employee (Revenue ÷ Number of employees): If the 
annual report doesn’t mention the number of employees, you can call 
investor relations or find it in a company profile on one of the financial 
Web sites, such as Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com).
 
✓ Revenue per dollar value of property, plant, and equipment (Revenue 
÷ Dollar value of property, plant, and equipment): You can find the 
dollar value of property, plant, and equipment on the financial report’s 
balance sheet.
 
✓ Revenue per dollar value of total assets (Revenue ÷ Dollar value of 
total assets): You can find the number for total assets on the financial 
report’s balance sheet.
 
✓ Revenue per square foot of retail or rental space, if appropriate 
(Revenue ÷ Square foot of retail space): You can find details about 
retail or rental space in the managers’ discussion and analysis or the 
notes to the financial statements, or in the company’s profile on a finan-
cial Web site.
 
Compare these ratios for the past five quarters, and also compare the ratios 
to ones of similar companies and ones for the industry as a whole. If you see 
major differences from accounting period to accounting period or between 
similar companies, it may be a sign of a problem. For example, if revenue per 
employee is much higher, or if revenue per dollar value of property, plant, or 
equipment far exceeds that of similar companies or that of previous periods, 
this may be a sign of abusive revenue management.
Exploring Exploitations of Expenses
If a company is playing games with its expenses, the most likely place you’ll 
find evidence is in its capitalization or its amortization policies. You can find 
details about these policies in the notes to the financial statements. For fur-
ther explanation of amortization, see Chapter 4.

306
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
Companies that want their bottom lines to look better may shift the way that 
they report depreciation and amortization, which are the tools they use to 
account for an asset’s use and to show the decreasing value of that asset. 
To make their net incomes look better, companies can play games with the 
amounts they write off. They do so by writing off less than they should and 
lowering expenses.
In addition to depreciation and amortization schedules, companies can play 
games with expenses when reporting some types of advertising, research 
and development costs, patents and licenses, asset impairments, and 
restructuring charges. In some cases, companies can capitalize (spread 
out) their expenses over a number of months, quarters, or years. Spreading 
out expenses can certainly improve a company’s bottom line because the 
expenses will be lower in the first year they’re incurred, and lower expenses 
mean more net income.
 
So the key question is whether a company is spreading its expenses out 
properly or improperly managing its bottom line. You can find details in the 
accounting-policies section in the annual report. I point out the key policies 
to review, but if the company is playing games, detecting anything out of the 
ordinary is difficult to do by using the annual reports. You have to depend on 
reports in the financial press or from the SEC to see if problems are detected 
or exposed by a whistle-blower.
Advertising expenses
Companies report most advertising expenses in the accounting period when 
they’re incurred; however, for some types of advertising, such as direct-
response advertising, companies can spread the expense out over a number 
of quarters. Direct-response advertising is mailed directly to the consumer. 
For example, when a business sends out an annual catalog, it can legitimately 
spread out the costs for that direct-mail piece over the year, as long as it can 
show that it receives orders from that catalog throughout the year. To find 
out a firm’s policy on advertising expenses, look in the notes to the financial 
statements.
Research and development costs
Companies are supposed to report research and development (R&D) costs 
in the current period being reported on the financial statements, but some 
companies try to stretch out those expenses over a number of quarters so 
the reduction in net income won’t be necessary all in the same year. If fewer 
expenses are subtracted from revenues, net income will be higher, which 
will make the company look more profitable. However, the SEC has ruled 

307
 Chapter 23: Keeping Score When Companies Play Games with Numbers
that because these expenditures are so high-risk and a company isn’t certain 
when the R&D activities may benefit its revenue, the company must imme-
diately report R&D expenses rather than spread them out over months or 
years. One notable exception is when a company is developing new software, 
in which case it can spread its expenses over a number of periods until the 
software development is technically feasible.
 
To see how the company expenses its R&D, read the notes to the financial 
statements. If you’re uncertain about the accounting policies that the notes 
present, don’t hesitate to call investor relations and ask questions until you 
understand what you’re reading.
Patents and licenses
Understanding the accounting for patents and licenses can be difficult. Most 
times, the expenses a company incurs during the research and development 
phase — before it receives a patent or license — must be written off in the 
year when they occurred, and they can’t be capitalized (written off over 
a number of years). But the company can capitalize some expenses — for 
instance, those it incurs to register or defend a patent. The company can also 
list a patent or license it purchases as an asset at the purchase price and cap-
italize it. Companies like to capitalize a patent or license because such a large 
purchase can significantly reduce their net income, so most prefer to write it 
off over several years, if they can, to reduce the hit.
All patents and licenses that a company purchases are listed as assets on the 
balance sheet. In addition, the balance sheet lists the costs of registering pat-
ents or licenses for products developed in-house. The value of these patents 
and licenses is amortized over the time period for which they’re economically 
viable (meaning for as long as the company benefits from owning that patent 
or license).
Companies can play games with the value of patents and licenses, as well as 
with the time periods for which they’ll be considered economically viable. To 
see what a company says about its patent and license accounting policies, 
read the notes to the financial statements. Compare its policies with those of 
similar companies to see whether they appear reasonable or if the company 
may be overstating its value or capitalizing its expenses in a way that differs 
from its competitors. For example, if Company A makes widgets and says the 
patent for its type of widget is good for 10 years, and Company B makes a dif-
ferent kind of widget and says its patent is economically viable for 20 years, 
you probably want to call investor relations and find out why Company B 
believes it has an economically viable widget for so much longer than its 
competitor.

Asset impairment
Tangible assets depreciate based on set schedules, but not all intangible 
assets face a rigid amortization schedule. For example, goodwill is an intangi-
ble asset that’s no longer amortized each year. This line item on the balance 
sheet has long had potential for creative accounting practitioners. Today, 
most companies have goodwill on their balance sheets because many large 
public companies are formed by buying smaller companies.
Any company that acquires another company can list goodwill on its balance 
sheet. A firm’s value of goodwill is based on the amount of money or stock 
that it pays for the acquisition, over and above what the net tangible assets 
were worth.
In the past, companies amortized goodwill and wrote off its expenses each 
year. Today, a company must prove that the value of its goodwill has been 
impaired (worth less than it was in a previous year) before it can write it off. 
The SEC requires that companies test goodwill before they write off any value 
to see if any impairment to its value has occurred.
The value of goodwill is tested based on a number of factors, including
 
✓ Competition and the ability of competitors to negatively affect the profit-
ability of the business that a company acquires
 
✓ The current or expected future levels of industry consolidation
 
✓ The impact that potential or expected changes in technology may have 
on profitability
 
✓ Legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory 
environment
 
✓ Loss of future revenue if certain key employees of the acquisition com-
pany aren’t retained
 
✓ The rate of customer turnover, or how fast old customers leave and new 
customers arrive
 
✓ The mobility of customers and employees
 
If you see that a company has written off goodwill or any other asset under 
the rules of impairment, look for an explanation about how it calculated that 
impairment in the notes to the financial statements. If you don’t understand 
the explanation, ask the investor relations office questions.

 Chapter 23: Keeping Score When Companies Play Games with Numbers
Restructuring charges
Restructuring charges is one of the primary ways that companies can hide 
all sorts of accounting games. A company can restructure itself by combining 
divisions, having one division split off into two or more, or dismantling an 
entire division. Any major change in the way that a company manufactures or 
sells its products usually entails restructuring.
Whenever a company indicates restructuring charges on its financial state-
ments, carefully scour the notes to the financial statements for reasons 
behind those charges and how the company determines how much it will 
write off. Find out what costs the firm allocated to the restructure, and care-
fully read the details for those costs. The restructuring method is a great 
way for a company to get rid of losses in one-time charges and clean out the 
books. Luckily, this is a red flag that the SEC closely watches for, and SEC 
staff question company reports if they believe a company’s charges and its 
explanations seem fishy.
In the notes to the financial statements, you usually find a note specifically 
detailing the restructuring and its impact on the financial statements. You 
may also find mentions of restructuring charges or plans in the manage-
ment’s discussion and analysis section of the financial report. Many times 
when a company restructures, it incurs costs for asset impairment, lease 
termination, plant and other closures, severance pay, benefits, relocation, 
and retraining, giving creative accountants a lot of room to fiddle with the 
numbers.
The company must specify costs not only for the current period but also 
costs for all future years in which the company anticipates additional costs 
and any related write-offs in periods prior to the one being reported. The SEC 
watches these charges very closely, too, and tries to close any loopholes that 
allow companies to charge recurring operating expenses to their restructur-
ing, which companies do to improve the appearance to outsiders of the earn-
ings results from business operations.
Finding Funny Business in 
Assets and Liabilities
Overvaluing assets or undervaluing liabilities can give a distorted view of a 
company’s earning power and financial position. These practices can have a 
devastating impact when the company must finally admit to its game-playing.

310
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
Recognizing overstated assets
Overstated assets make a company look financially healthier to annual report 
readers than it truly is. The company may report that it has more cash 
due than it really does, or that it holds more inventory than is actually on 
its shelves. The company may also report that the value of its inventory is 
greater than it really is.
Accounts receivable
The accounts receivable section of the financial report is the place where you 
may find an indication of premature or fictitious revenue recognition. One 
way a company can overstate its accounts receivable is to post sales to cus-
tomers who will return the items early the following month without paying 
for them. The dollar value of those goods reduces the accounts receivable 
during the next accounting period, but the deception makes the current 
period look like more revenues were received than should actually have been 
counted because the sales are premature or fictitious.
That’s not the only way that a company can overvalue its accounts receiv-
able. Another account attached to accounts receivable is the allowance 
for doubtful accounts. At the end of each accounting period, the company 
identifies past-due accounts that probably won’t get paid and adds the value 
of these past-due accounts to the allowance for doubtful accounts, which 
reduces the value of accounts receivable.
A company that wants to play with its numbers and indicate that its financial 
position is actually better than it appears reduces the amount it sets aside 
for doubtful accounts. Gradually, the number of days the company takes to 
collect on its accounts receivable goes up as more and more late- or nonpay-
ers are left in accounts receivable. Eventually, the number of days it takes for 
the company to collect on its accounts receivable goes up, and the amount of 
cash it takes in from customers who are paying off their purchase bought on 
credit slows down.
 
You can test the trend for accounts receivable by using formulas I explain in 
Chapter 16. Test the trend by calculating days in accounts receivable for the 
past three to five quarters. If you see the number of days in accounts receiv-
able gradually rise, that’s a sign of a problem, and it may represent an attempt 
to recognize revenue prematurely or fictitiously. But it may also represent a 
problem of credit policies that are too liberal. I discuss that issue in greater 
detail in Chapter 16.
Inventory
As I discuss in Chapter 15, companies can use one of five different inventory 
valuation methods, and each one yields a different net income for the com-
pany. Inventory policy isn’t the only way a company can shift the value of its 
inventory on the balance sheet. Other common methods used include

311
 Chapter 23: Keeping Score When Companies Play Games with Numbers
 
✓ Overstating physical count: Although this is absolute fraud, compa-
nies take this route to improve the appearance of their balance sheets. 
Sometimes they alter the actual count of their inventory; other times 
they don’t subtract the decrease in inventory from the physical count. 
Companies may also leave damaged goods in the inventory count even 
though they have no value.
 
✓ Increasing reported valuation: Some businesses don’t even bother 
messing with their inventory counts. A simple journal entry increas-
ing a firm’s inventory valuation and decreasing its costs of goods sold 
can improve appearances on both the balance sheet and the income 
statement. The assets side of the balance sheet looks better and the net 
income figure improves, too — which ultimately raises retained earnings 
to hide the existence of the journal entry and keep the balance sheet in 
balance.
 
✓ Delaying an inventory write-down: Company management periodi-
cally writes down the value of their inventory when they determine 
that the products are obsolete or slow-moving. Because the decision to 
write down inventory is purely up to management, during a rough year, 
the company may delay writing down inventory to make its numbers 
look better.
 
Any time you suspect that inventory may be the object of financial game-
playing, you can test your theory by calculating the number of days inven-
tory sits around the company (I show you how to test the number of days 
inventory sits around in Chapter 15). Look for trends by running the numbers 
for the past three years. If you see that the number of days that inventory 
sits around gradually increases, definitely suspect a problem. The problem 
may not be creative accounting; it may be a sign of other problems, such as 
reduced consumer interest in the product or a bad economic market. The 
only way you’ll find out is to ask your questions to the company’s investor 
relations department.
Undeveloped land
Land never depreciates. But shareholders don’t have any details about where 
the land that a company owns is located, so they can never truly assess the 
value of undeveloped land on a balance sheet. This fact allows a lot of room 
for creative accounting and leaves the financial reader in the dark when it 
comes to finding this problem. Unfortunately, in a sketchy situation like this 
one, all you can do is wait for a whistle-blower to expose it.
Artwork
As is the case with undeveloped land, financial reports don’t detail the value 
of artwork that a company holds, so a lot of room exists for doctoring the 
numbers. Unless you’re looking at the financial statements for a company 
that regularly sells artwork, be wary when you see a large portion of its assets 
listed on the balance sheet in a line item called “artwork.” This line item 
shouldn’t be a major one for most companies that aren’t in the art business.

312
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
 
If you see a non-art business with a significant level of assets tied up in art-
work, ask investor relations why the company is spending so much money on 
art. Frankly, a firm that ties up its money in art rather than using it to grow the 
business is not one I’d want to own stock in.
Looking for undervalued liabilities
Undervaluing liabilities can certainly make a company look healthier to finan-
cial report readers, but this deception is likely to lead the company down the 
path to bankruptcy. Games played by misstating liabilities frequently involve 
large numbers and hide significant money problems.
Accounts payable
Most times, an increase in accounts payable is directly related to the fact 
that the company is delaying payments for inventory. To test for a problem, 
you need to calculate the accounts payable ratio, which I show you how to 
do in Chapter 16. If you find a trend indicating that the number of days the 
company takes to pay its accounts payable is steadily increasing, test the 
number of days in inventory, as I show you in Chapter 15.
If the company fails both tests, investigate further. Even though the company 
may not be playing games with its numbers, take these signs as an indica-
tion of a worsening problem. With the trends you’re noticing, definitely call 
investor relations and ask for explanations about why the company has been 
paying its bills more slowly or why the inventory has been sitting on the 
shelves for longer periods of time.
 
If investor relations doesn’t answer the questions to your satisfaction, don’t 
buy the stock. If you already do own the stock, you may want to consider sell-
ing it if you believe the company is hiding the truth.
Accrued expenses payable
Any expenses that a company hasn’t paid by the end of an accounting period 
are accrued (posted to the accounts before cash is paid out) in the current 
period, so these expenses can be matched to current period earnings. This 
amount is added to the liability side of the balance sheet.
Unpaid expenses can include just about any expense for which the company 
gets a bill and has a number of days to pay, such as
 
✓ Administrative expenses
 
✓ Benefits
 
✓ Insurance

313
 Chapter 23: Keeping Score When Companies Play Games with Numbers
 
✓ Salaries
 
✓ Selling costs
 
✓ Utilities
If the bill arrives during the last week before a company closes its books, 
the company most likely will accrue it rather than pay it. Most firms cut off 
paying bills several days before they close their books so the staff can con-
centrate on closing the books for the period.
If a firm needs to improve its net income, it can manage its numbers by 
not accruing bills and instead paying them in the next accounting period. 
The problem with this strategy is that the next accounting period has 
more expenses charged to it than the company actually incurred during 
that accounting period. The expenses will be higher, and therefore, the net 
income will be lower in the next reporting period.
 
You can test for this particular game by watching the trend for accrued 
expenses payable. Check to see whether accrued expenses payable is going 
up or down from accounting period to accounting period. Usually, accrued 
expenses payable stay pretty level from year to year. If you see a steady 
decline, the company may be doing some creative accounting, or maybe the 
company’s decrease in expenses is simply due to discontinued operations 
or other changes. If you see a declining trend, look deeper into the numbers 
to see whether you can find an explanation. If not, call investor relations to 
find out why the trend for accrued payables shifts from accounting period to 
accounting period.
Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are liabilities that a company should accrue when it 
determines that an event is likely to happen. For example, if the company is 
party to a lawsuit that it lost and the winner was awarded damages, the com-
pany should accrue the liability as a contingent liability.
A company must determine two factors before it can list a contingent liability 
on its balance sheet. Factor one: The company deems it’s probable that it will 
be held liable. Factor two: The company can reasonably estimate the costs 
that will be incurred.
If the company hasn’t determined these two issues, you probably find a note 
about the contingency in the notes to the financial statements. Read the 
notes about contingencies and research further any items you think the com-
pany may not be fully disclosing. You do so by reading analysts’ reports on 
the company or by calling the investor relations department to ask questions 
about any issues mentioned in the notes to the financial statements.

314
Part V: The Many Ways Companies Answer to Others 
Pay down liabilities
Another way that the firms involved in the scandals of the past three years 
played with their numbers was by indicating that they paid down their 
liabilities when they actually didn’t. To make its balance sheet look better, 
a company may transfer debt to another entity owned by the company, its 
directors, or its executives to hide its true financial status.
You probably won’t have any way of knowing if this is happening until a com-
pany insider decides to expose the practice or the SEC catches the company.
Playing Detective with Cash Flow
The statement of cash flows (which I discuss in detail in Chapter 8) is derived 
primarily from information found on a company’s income statement and 
balance sheet. You usually don’t find massaged numbers on this statement 
because it’s based primarily on the numbers that have already been shown 
on these other documents. But you may find that the presentation of the 
numbers hides cash-flow problems.
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations occur when a company shuts down some of its 
activities, such as closing a manufacturing plant or putting an end to a prod-
uct line. Many companies that discontinue operations show the impact it has 
on their cash in a separate line item of the financial report. Companies having 
cash-flow problems with continuing operations may not separate these 
results on their cash flow statements. Because the accounting rules don’t 
require a separate line item, this strategy is a convenient way to hide the 
problem from investors — most of whom don’t do a good job of reading the 
small print in the notes to the financial statements anyway.
If discontinued operations have an impact on a company’s income state-
ment, you see a line item there listing either additional revenue or additional 
expenses related to the shutdown. You can find greater detail about those 
discontinued operations in the notes to the financial statements. Anytime 
you see mention of discontinued operations on the income statement or in 
the notes to the financial statements, be sure that you also see a separate 
line item in the statement of cash flows. If you don’t, use the information you 
glean from the income statement and the notes to calculate the cash flow 
from operations.

315
 Chapter 23: Keeping Score When Companies Play Games with Numbers
To calculate the cash flow from operations (cash received from the day-to-day 
operations of the business, usually from sales), subtract any cash generated 
from discontinued operations (which you find noted on the income state-
ment) from the net income reported on the statement of cash flows. When 
looking at a company’s profitability from the cash perspective, you want to 
consider only cash generated by ongoing operations.
When you take on the role of detective, you may uncover a cash-flow prob-
lem that the financial wizards carefully concealed because the rules allow 
such a misleading presentation. In Chapter 17, I show you numerous calcula-
tions for testing a company’s cash flow.
Income taxes paid
Just like with discontinued operations, the amount of income taxes that a 
company pays can distort its operating cash flow. The reason is that in some 
situations, companies pay income taxes as a one-time occurrence, such as 
taxes on the net gain or loss from the sale of a major asset. The income taxes 
a company pays for these one-time occurrences shouldn’t be included in 
your calculations related to operating cash flow.
By reviewing the sections on investing or financing activities in the statement 
of cash flows, you can find any adjustments you may need to calculate the 
operating cash flow. Here are two key adjustments you need to make to find 
the actual net cash from operations (the amount of cash generated from the 
company’s day-to-day operations):
 
✓ Gains from sales of investments or fixed assets: If a company gains 
from the sale of investments or fixed assets (for example, buildings, fac-
tories, vehicles, or anything else the company owns that can’t be quickly 
converted to cash) that weren’t part of operations, add back in the taxes 
paid on a gain from the sale of an investment or fixed asset. Taxes paid 
on one-time gains distort the true cash flow from operations.
 
✓ Losses from sales of investments or fixed assets: If a company loses 
from the sale of investments or fixed assets, the tax savings the com-
pany gets from the loss increases its cash flow. You need to subtract 
these tax savings from the net cash so your operating cash flow accu-
rately reflects the cash available from operations.

Seeking information on questionable reporting
If you want to find more information about com-
panies that may be playing games with their 
numbers, a good place to turn is Accounting 
and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAERs), 
posted on the SEC Web site. You can use the 
search features to find any releases that the 
SEC may have issued.
AAERs detail criminal actions, civil actions, or 
cease-and-desist proceedings and how the 
company or individual must correct their cur-
rent reporting practices. The AAERs also detail 
any penalties the SEC imposes. To find the list of 
current and past releases filed by the SEC, go to 
www.sec.gov and search for “AAERs.”

Part VI
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
H
ere you find quick information about some juicy 
topics. I tell you about financial reporting scandals 
that shook the world, and I give you ten indications that a 
company may be falling on hard times.

Chapter 24
Ten Financial Scandals 
That Rocked the World
In This Chapter
▶ Checking in with cheats
▶ Taking a look at foul play
▶ Finding fallout from faulty bookkeeping
I
’m sorry to have to say this, but the hard part of writing this chapter was 
narrowing the list down to ten. Too many candidates were competing for 
a spot on this list. Since 2000, more than 500 companies had to restate earn-
ings after company executives, the board of directors, or the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) found problems with their financial statements. 
Because of these misstated earnings, stock prices dropped and investors lost 
billions of dollars on the stocks they held in their portfolios; some even had 
their entire retirement savings wiped out. Clearly, our entire financial report-
ing system needs a major overhaul.
Although the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (you can find details about the 
changes that bill requires in Chapter 3) improved things a little, the mortgage 
mess of 2007 showed how much more needs to be done as financial institu-
tions around the world shocked their shareholders when they lost billions 
due to mortgage-backed securities. Some of these securities were held on the 
books, but others were held off the books, Enron-style. Corporate lobbyists 
are still trying to get Congress to weaken Sarbanes-Oxley, but the 2007 bank-
ing scandals will probably make their job more difficult.
Drumroll, please! And the winners are . . .

320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Enron
Was there ever a doubt that Enron wouldn’t make this list? Enron (once the 
world’s largest energy trader) has practically become synonymous with “cor-
porate scandal.” Sure, some major scandals occurred before Enron, but the 
downfall of this company in 2001 rattled the markets with the massive scope 
of the misdealings that came to light. The final word on how much Enron mis-
stated its earnings is still to come, but Enron definitely overstated its profits 
and improperly used off-the-books (not shown on its financial statements) 
partnerships to hide more than $1 billion in debt and give investors a false 
impression about its financial position. You can follow the ongoing cases at 
The Enron Fraud (www.enronfraud.com).
Enron’s misdeeds didn’t stop with only misleading investors; company insid-
ers also manipulated the Texas power market and the California energy 
market and bribed foreign governments to win contracts abroad. Enron’s 
lead in the energy-trading scandals exposed the manipulation of the energy 
market by other key energy companies, including CMS Energy, Duke Energy, 
Dynegy, and Reliant Energy.
The Enron scandal also took down one of the big five accounting firms, 
Arthur Andersen, which was convicted of fraud for its role in the scandal. I 
talk more about Arthur Andersen later in this chapter.
Enron declared bankruptcy at the end of 2001. Now the bankrupt company 
is facing about $100 billion in claims and liabilities from shareholders, bond-
holders, and other creditors.
Some executives pleaded guilty to felony charges. A federal jury in Houston 
indicted two of Enron’s former chief executives, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey 
Skilling, on charges of fraud and insider trading in 2004. Former Enron 
finance chief Andrew S. Fastow, who allegedly pocketed $60 million in com-
pany money without the board’s knowledge, pleaded guilty and cooper-
ated with the investigation. He was sentenced to ten years in prison on one 
count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to 
commit securities fraud. Lay died before the criminal case was completed, 
but Skilling was sentenced to 24 years and is serving his time in the Waseca, 
Minn., Federal Correctional Institution.
Today, the company is much smaller and is operating under the supervi-
sion of a bankruptcy court. Its new name is the Enron Creditors Recovery 
Corporation. It’s liquidating its remaining assets to reorganize and pay off 
creditors. After the creditors are paid from the asset sales, the corporation 
will cease to exist.

321
 Chapter 24: Ten Financial Scandals That Rocked the World
Citigroup
Financial institutions certainly didn’t learn anything from the Enron scandal, 
and Citigroup made the biggest mistakes of all. Citigroup hid its problems 
from shareholders by keeping a large portion of its questionable mortgage-
backed securities holdings off the books.
In December 2007, Citigroup brought $49 billion in these mortgage assets 
back onto the books, and as of July 2008, it was still trying to recover from 
the mess it created, and it probably will be for years to come. Shareholders 
had no idea that Citigroup was so deeply invested in subprime mortgages 
until after the damage was already done.
Citigroup’s board finally pushed its Chairman and CEO, Charles Prince, out 
the door in November 2007. In May 2007, Citigroup’s stock was selling for 
$51.01 a share. By December 2007, when Citigroup finally fessed up and took 
the bad debt back onto its books, shares were selling for $28.24. As more 
information came to light, Citigroup’s stock continued to drop like a stone 
and was at $18.69 in July 2008.
While shareholders lost billions, Prince walked out with a $40 million sever-
ance package and still has an office and an assistant in Citigroup’s headquar-
ters. He also has a car and driver.
Adelphia
Adelphia (a broadcasting and cable TV company) makes the top-ten list 
because of its greedy top executives: John Rigas, founder of the company, 
and his son, Timothy Rigas. The Rigases used the corporation as their per-
sonal piggy bank, stealing $100 million from the company and using it for 
luxurious personal residences, trips, and other items so they could live a life 
of luxury.
In 2004, John and Timothy were found guilty of concealing $2.3 billion in 
loans, which were hidden in small companies left off Adelphia’s books. 
The SEC charged that in addition to hiding debt, Adelphia inflated earnings 
to meet Wall Street expectations between at least 1998 and March 2002. 
Adelphia also falsified statistics about the company’s operations and con-
cealed blatant self-dealing by the Rigas family, which founded and controlled 
Adelphia.

322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Two other executives from Adelphia were arrested in 2002 after the scandal 
broke. Michael Rigas, another son of John Rigas, and Michael Mulcahey, the 
company’s former director of internal reporting, were both found not guilty.
Adelphia went bankrupt and is currently liquidating real estate assets and 
handling bankruptcy and litigation issues.
WorldCom/MCI
WorldCom (a telephone company) overstated its cash flow by improperly 
booking $11.1 billion in company assets, but the total turned out to be a 
lot higher when all the pieces were put together. Some put the total loss to 
investors at $79.5 billion.
In addition to sloppy and fraudulent bookkeeping, the post-bankruptcy audit 
found two important new pieces — WorldCom had overvalued several acqui-
sitions and lost $48.9 billion, including a $47 billion write-down of impaired 
assets. So instead of a $10 billion profit in 2000 and 2001, WorldCom had a 
combined loss for the years 2000 through 2002 (the year it declared bank-
ruptcy) of $73.7 billion. When you add $5.8 billion of overvalued assets, the 
total fraud at WorldCom amounted to $79.5 billion.
Bernard Ebbers, WorldCom’s founder, was given $400 million in off-the-books 
loans by the company. Criminal fraud charges were filed against Ebbers and 
former chief financial officer (CFO) Scott Sullivan. Sullivan pleaded guilty to 
three criminal charges related to the fraud as part of a deal to cooperate with 
prosecutors in their case against Ebbers. Ebbers was sentenced to 25 years 
in prison and is serving his time at Oakdale, Louisiana, Federal Corrections 
Institute.
Investor groups filed a class-action case against WorldCom’s former direc-
tors and executives, 18 banks, and former outside auditor Arthur Andersen. 
A few of these plaintiffs settled out of court in 2004; the settlement included a 
$50 million payment by some former WorldCom directors and a $2.65 billion 
settlement by Citigroup, the bank that had promoted WorldCom’s stocks and 
bonds as good investments, even though it had concerns about WorldCom’s 
rocky financial position.
WorldCom filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002. The company emerged 
from bankruptcy as MCI in 2004, which is the name of a company it bought 
along the way to building its kingdom. As part of the bankruptcy settlement 
among the company, the courts, and the creditors, the company’s debt was 
reduced by 85 percent to $5.8 billion, still leaving many creditors with little 
or nothing. Shareholders also were left with nothing, and their shares were 
worthless after the company emerged from bankruptcy. In December 2005, 
Verizon bought MCI/WorldCom.

323
 Chapter 24: Ten Financial Scandals That Rocked the World
Sunbeam
Sunbeam (once a household name for electric appliances and camping equip-
ment) was one of the first companies exposed for its questionable accounting 
gimmicks and fraud, which involved overstating earnings and jacking up the 
stock price.
In the 1990s, Sunbeam CEO Albert Dunlap ordered the company’s managers 
to get the stock price up. They did so by overstating sales. The company’s 
board of directors caught them after the firm reported robust sales of elec-
tric blankets during the summer months — how many people buy electric 
blankets in the summer? Another clue was the increasing barbecue grill 
sales in late autumn, just in time for winter cookouts — yeah, right! What the 
managers were really doing is channel stuffing — selling these goods at sig-
nificant discounts to distributors and middlemen so company sales would 
look better than they really were. (I discuss channel stuffing in greater detail 
in Chapter 23.)
Sunbeam’s board of directors finally caught on to these deceptive practices 
in 1998 and ousted Dunlap. The board also replaced the company’s auditor, 
Arthur Andersen. In May 2001, the SEC filed a complaint alleging that Dunlap 
and former finance chief Russell Kersh perpetrated a fraudulent scheme to 
create an illusion that they successfully restructured the company to sell 
Sunbeam at an inflated price. The SEC also alleged that Sunbeam’s scheme 
resulted in overstating its earnings by $60 million.
Sunbeam declared bankruptcy in 2001, and the stock is no longer trading. 
Arthur Andersen paid $110 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit against the 
firm for its role in the deception. In 2002, the SEC started an investigation of 
Dunlap and his cohorts, but no indictment was ever filed.
Tyco
Tyco (a diversified manufacturing and service company) was used as a per-
sonal piggy bank by some of its executives, according to charges filed by 
the SEC. In 2002, former chairman and CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski, former CFO 
Mark Swartz, and former chief counsel Mark Belnick allegedly stole more 
than $600 million from Tyco, which they deny.
The SEC says that they took out hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and 
paid excessive compensation to key executives, which they never disclosed 
to shareholders. In addition to the SEC charges, Tyco sued Kozlowski, seek-
ing backpay and benefits since 1997 totaling $244 million, as well as forfeiture

of all his severance pay. A 2004 trial based on the SEC charges ended in a 
mistrial after a juror received a threatening letter from an unknown source. 
In 2005 they were found guilty. Kozlowski was convicted on charges of grand 
larceny and sentenced to up to 25 years. He’s serving his time in Mid-State 
Correctional Facility in Marcy, N.Y.
Fortunately, Tyco has gotten past this scandal and is on the road to recovery 
with a new management team that’s getting high marks from analysts for 
reviving cash flow and implementing new corporate rules to prevent similar 
mismanagement in the future. On June 29, 2007, Tyco shareholders received 
shares in two new companies: Covidien (Tyco’s healthcare unit) and Tyco 
Electronics.
Waste Management
Waste Management (a waste services company) restated its earnings by $1.7 
billion in 1998 after an SEC investigation found that the firm’s former top 
executives had inflated earnings, which allowed them to take home millions 
in personal profits and other benefits while duping the company’s sharehold-
ers by giving them the impression that the company’s earnings were higher 
than they actually were.
Their scheme unraveled in 1997 when a new CEO ordered a review of the 
company’s accounting practices. In 1998, the company restated its earnings 
based on financial statements that inflated earnings from 1992 to 1997. In this 
case, the company prepared a corrected financial statement that showed the 
differences for each of the years in question. The impact these differences 
had on the firm’s earnings was reflected in the restatement of earnings filed 
with the 1998 financial reports.
Arthur Andersen and three of its partners, which were the auditors for Waste 
Management during the period, were fined $7 million in 2001 for their roles in 
the scandal. In 1999, Arthur Andersen settled a $220 million lawsuit filed by 
shareholders who bought Waste Management stock between 1994 and 1998. 
In 2001, Waste Management settled a shareholder lawsuit by paying share-
holders $457 million.
In 2002, the SEC filed fraud charges against former Waste Management execu-
tives, including founder and former CEO Dean Buntrock, former president 
and chief operating officer Phillip Rooney, former CFO James Koenig, former 
controller Thomas Hau, former general counsel Herbert Getz, and former 
vice president of finance Bruce Tobecksen. These charges were settled out of 
court in 2005 with no admission of wrongdoing.

Bristol-Meyers Squibb
Bristol-Meyers Squibb (a pharmaceutical company) stuffed its channels with 
drugs and improperly booked about $1.5 billion in revenue from the first 
quarter of 2000 through the last quarter of 2001, according to the SEC. The 
SEC filed a civil fraud action against the company in 2003. To meet Wall Street 
expectations, Bristol-Meyers Squibb shipped a lot of inventory to its distribu-
tors in consignment-like sales near the end of each quarter so its numbers 
would look better. This channel-stuffing practice built up inventory at dis-
tributor levels and risked the company’s ability to sell additional drugs in the 
future, which ultimately would lower its earnings.
Without admitting or denying the allegations, Bristol-Meyers Squibb settled 
the civil fraud action with the SEC in August 2004 by agreeing to pay a civil 
penalty of $100 million plus $50 million for a shareholder fund. On Aug. 20, 
2008, a judge ruled in favor of shareholders and decided that the company 
had made false or misleading statements about pending litigation regarding 
Canadian generic drug maker Apotex. The judge refused to dismiss the class 
action suit, which is still pending.
In addition to the fines Bristol-Meyers Squibb paid to the SEC, the company 
consented to a permanent injunction against future violations of certain 
antifraud and booking rules and agreed to appoint an independent adviser to 
review its accounting practices and internal control systems.
Halliburton
Between 1998 and 2000, Halliburton (an oil-field services company) changed 
its accounting policies for booking revenues from its contracts, boosting its 
paper profits by about $300 million and giving investors a misleading view of 
the company’s true earnings.
This change in accounting policies, which the company didn’t report to its 
investors, related to when and how Halliburton would include on its income 
statement revenue it expected to earn from cost overruns (costs that exceed 
the contract price) on contracts. The company usually gets part of those over-
runs reimbursed and can include that part as additional revenue on its income 
statement after it receives the reimbursement. The contracts in question were 
cost-plus contracts, which means the company could negotiate for additional 
revenue based on cost overruns. Before 1998, Halliburton didn’t book any of 
these cost overruns as revenue until it settled with the purchaser of its services 
and knew exactly how much the purchaser would pay toward the overruns.

326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
After the change in accounting policy, Halliburton booked revenue from the 
cost overruns immediately upon completing the job to improve its earnings 
reports to investors. But Halliburton had no guarantee that the purchaser 
would pay the full amount in overruns that it was asking for. In fact, the 
purchaser often reduced these amounts in negotiations, and Halliburton 
would have to adjust its revenues downward after it had reported the higher 
earnings to investors. Halliburton’s auditor during this period was Arthur 
Andersen. (I know. It’s shocking, isn’t it?)
Counting revenue before final settlement is an aggressive accounting method, 
and the company should have reported the change to its investors immedi-
ately. The SEC filed a civil action against Halliburton charging that because 
the company didn’t disclose the accounting changes, it deprived investors of 
the information they needed to assess the firm’s earnings and compare them 
with earnings of prior years, before the accounting change was made. The 
change allowed the company to report higher earnings and hide losses. In 
September 2004, Halliburton agreed to a $7.5 million settlement with the SEC.
Halliburton’s accounting system faces regular federal scrutiny from the 
Pentagon. The Pentagon has charged Halliburton with overbilling millions of 
dollars for services in Iraq that it never provided. These disputes will prob-
ably continue throughout the course of the Iraq war.
Arthur Andersen
One name that has shown up all over this list is Arthur Andersen. Once one 
of the top five accounting firms, this company is now defunct because of its 
role in assisting Enron with its deceptive practices. In March 2002, a grand 
jury indicted Arthur Andersen on charges of obstruction of justice, including 
charges of withholding documents from official proceedings and destroying, 
mutilating, and concealing documents.
Arthur Andersen was convicted on these charges in June 2002 and could no 
longer audit financial statements or provide CPA guidance, which essentially 
ended the firm’s ability to earn money from its accounting activities. The 
Supreme Court overturned its conviction on May 31, 2005, because of prob-
lems with the instructions to the jury. Yet this was a hollow victory, because 
the company was no longer a viable business.

327
 Chapter 24: Ten Financial Scandals That Rocked the World
The staff of Arthur Andersen fell from a high of 28,000 people before the con-
viction to just 200 in 2008. The remaining staff is responsible for dealing with 
the legal issues still pending in 2008 and working on an orderly dissolution of 
the company.
Over 100 civil lawsuits are still making their way through the courts against 
Arthur Andersen and its accounting practices related to Enron and other 
companies. In June 2008 Arthur Andersen was socked with $23 million in 
damages in one of those pending lawsuits in Oregon.

Ten Signs That a Company’s 
in Trouble
In This Chapter
▶ Keeping an eye on a company’s financial numbers
▶ Examining a company’s methods and procedures
I
f you don’t recognize traffic signs, driving is going to be pretty hairy. By the 
same token, if you don’t recognize a company’s danger signs by reading 
the financial reports, your investment decisions may not be the best ones.
Many companies put out glossy financial reports more than 100 pages long 
with the most graphically pleasing sections providing only the news about 
the company that its managers want you to read. Don’t be fooled. Take the 
time to read the pages in smaller print and the ones without the fancy graph-
ics, because these pages are where you find the most important financial 
news about the company. The following are key signs of trouble that you may 
find within these pages.
Lower Liquidity
Liquidity is the ability of a company to quickly convert assets to cash so that 
it can pay its bills and meet other debt obligations, such as a mortgage pay-
ment or a payment due to bond investors. The most liquid asset a company 
holds is cash in a checking or savings account. Other good liquid sources 
are holdings that a company can quickly convert to cash, such as marketable 
securities and certificates of deposits.
Other assets take longer to turn into cash, but they can be more liquid 
than long-term assets, such as a building or equipment. Take, for instance, 
accounts receivable. Accounts receivable can often be liquid holdings, 

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
provided that the company’s customers are paying their bills on time. If 
customers are paying their bills late, the company’s accounts receivable 
are less liquid, meaning that it takes longer for the company to collect that 
cash. I show you how to test a company’s accounts receivable management 
in Chapter 16.
Another sign of trouble may be inventory. If a company’s inventory continues 
to build, it may have less and less cash on hand as it ties up more money in 
the products it’s trying to sell. I show you how to test a company’s inventory 
management in Chapter 15, and I show you how to measure a company’s 
overall liquidity in Chapter 12.
Low Cash Flow
If you don’t have cash, you can’t pay your bills. The same is true for compa-
nies. You need to know how well a company manages its cash, and you can’t 
do that just by looking at the balance sheet and income statement, because 
neither of these statements reports what’s actually happening with cash.
 
The only way you can check out a company’s cash situation is by using the 
cash-flow statement. I show you numerous ways to test a company’s cash 
flow in Chapter 13. After doing the calculations in Chapter 13, if you find that a 
company can’t meet its cash obligations or is close to reaching that point, this 
situation is a clear sign of trouble.
Disappearing Profit Margins
Everyone wants to know how much money a company makes — in other 
words, its profits. A company’s profit dropping year to year is another clear 
sign of trouble.
Companies must report their profit results for the current year and the two 
previous years on their income statements, one of the three key financial 
statements that are part of the financial reports. (See Chapter 7 for more 
information about income statements.) When investigating a company’s 
viability, looking at the past five years or more — if you can get the data — 
is a good idea.

331
 Chapter 25: Ten Signs That a Company’s in Trouble 
 
Luckily, finding a company’s historical profit data isn’t hard. In the investor 
relations section on their Web site, most companies post financial reports for 
the current year and two or more previous years. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) also keeps previous years’ reports online at Edgar (www.
sec.gov/edgar.shtml).
 
Any time you notice that a company’s profit margins have fallen from year to 
year, take it as a clear sign that the company is in trouble. Research further to 
find out why, but definitely don’t invest in a company with falling profit mar-
gins unless you get good, solid information about an expected turnaround and 
how the company plans to pull that off. To find out more about how to test 
whether a company is making a profit, turn to Chapter 11.
Revenue Game-Playing
A day rarely goes by when you don’t see a story about company bigwigs 
who’ve played with their firm’s revenue results. Although the number of 
companies being exposed for revenue problems has certainly fallen since 
the height of scandals set off by the fall of Enron in 2001, a steady stream of 
reporting about the games that companies play with their revenue continues.
Problems can include managing earnings so results look better than they 
really are and actually creating a fictional story about earnings. I talk more 
about how companies play games with their revenue numbers in Chapter 23.
Unfortunately, the only way that a member of the general public can find 
out about these shenanigans is from the financial press. If the SEC or one 
of the country’s state attorneys general begins an investigation, you likely 
won’t know about it until the financial press decides to report on it. The 
SEC does post details about its investigations at http://www.sec.gov/
litigation.shtml. Usually, by the time that info is posted, the financial 
press has already done a story.
The initial stages of an investigation usually involve private inquiries between 
the SEC and the company regarding financial information filed on one of the 
SEC’s required forms. (For more information about those forms, see Chapter 
19.) These initial inquiries aren’t discussed publicly. Only after the SEC 
decides a company isn’t cooperating does it decide to start a formal inves-
tigation. When the SEC does start a formal investigation, the company must 
put out a press release to inform the general public (as well as its investors, 
creditors, and others interested in the company) that the SEC has some ques-
tions about the company’s financial reports.

332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Too Much Debt
 
Borrowing too much money to continue operations or to finance new activi-
ties can be a major red flag that indicates future problems for a company, 
especially if interest rates start rising. Debt can overburden a company and 
make it hard for the business to meet its obligations, eventually landing it in 
bankruptcy.
 
You can test a company’s debt situation by using the ratios I show you in 
Chapter 12. These ratios are calculated using numbers from the balance sheet 
and income statement. Compare a company’s debt ratios with those of others 
in the same industry to judge whether the company is in worse shape than its 
competitors.
Unrealistic Values for 
Assets and Liabilities
Some firms can make themselves look financially healthier by either over-
valuing their assets or undervaluing their liabilities. Overvalued assets can 
make a company appear as if its holdings are worth more than they are. For 
instance, if customers aren’t paying their bills but the accounts-receivable 
line item isn’t properly adjusted to show the likely bad debt, accounts receiv-
able will be higher than they should be. Undervalued liabilities can make a 
company look as though it owes less than it actually does. An example of this 
is when debts are moved off the balance sheet to another subsidiary to hide 
the debt. That’s just one of the things Enron and other scandal-ridden com-
panies did to hide their problems. If a firm hides its problems well to offset 
the overvaluing of assets or the undervaluing of liabilities, equity is probably 
overstated as well.
 
If you suspect a company of either possibility, it’s a clear sign of trouble 
ahead. You should certainly begin to suspect a problem if you see stories in 
the newspapers about the SEC or state authorities raising questions regarding 
the company’s financial statements. You may be able to spot problems sooner 
by using the techniques I discuss in Chapter 23.
A Change in Accounting Methods
Accounting rules are clearly set in the generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples (GAAP) developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). 
You can find details about the GAAP at the FASB’s Web site (www.fasb.org). 
Sometimes a company can file a report that’s perfectly acceptable by GAAP 

333
 Chapter 25: Ten Signs That a Company’s in Trouble 
standards, but it may hide a potential problem by changing its accounting 
methods. For example, all firms must account for their inventory by using one 
of five methods. Changing from one method to another can have a great impact 
on the bottom line. To find out whether this kind of change has occurred, read 
the fine print in the financial notes. I talk more about accounting methods in 
Chapter 4 and delve deeper into inventory-control methods in Chapter 15.
Questionable Mergers and Acquisitions
Mergers and acquisitions can be both good news and bad news. Most times, 
you won’t know whether a merger or acquisition will actually be good for a 
company’s bottom line until years later, so be careful buying into the fray 
when you see stories about the possibility of a merger or acquisition.
If you don’t already own the stock, stay away until the dust settles and you 
get a clear view of how the merger or acquisition will impact the companies 
involved. If you do own shares of stock, you’ll be able to vote for or against 
the merger or acquisition if it involves the exchange of stock. You can get to 
know the issues by reading what the company sends out when it seeks your 
vote. Follow the stories in the financial press, and read reports from analysts 
about the merger or acquisition.
You don’t see much about mergers and acquisitions in the three key financial 
statements (income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows); 
they rarely take up more than a line item. The key place to find out about the 
impact of mergers and acquisitions is in the notes to the financial statements, 
which I talk more about in Chapter 9.
Some mergers destroy stockholders’ 
and employees’ portfolios
Just ask Time Warner stockholders or employ-
ees what they think about their company’s 
merger with AOL — I’m sure you’ll hear many 
words of disgust, most not printable. Many of 
these employees held large chunks of stock in 
their retirement portfolios, which have lost most 
of their value. The AOL–Time Warner merger 
proved to be so bad for Time Warner sharehold-
ers that AOL was even dropped from the com-
pany name. The company also reverted to using 
its old stock symbol, TWX, rather than AOL.
Time Warner stock dropped from a market value 
of $52.56 per share in January 2001, when the 
merger was approved by the U.S. government, 
to $15.11 per share in September 2003, when 
the Time Warner board decided to drop AOL 
from its name, acknowledging the failure of the 
merger that was valued at $112 billion when it 
happened in 2000. In July 2008, the market value 
of the company was $49.3 billion, and stock sold 
for $13.78 at the close of the stock market on 
July 11, 2008.

334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
I can’t tell you how to read the tea leaves and figure out whether a merger or 
acquisition is ultimately a good idea, but I can warn you to stay away if you 
don’t already own the stock. If you’re a shareholder who will eventually have 
to vote on the merger or acquisition before it can be approved, I urge you to 
read everything you can get your hands on that discusses the financial impact 
the merger or acquisition may have on the company.
Slow Inventory Turnover
One way to see whether a company is slowing down is to look at its inventory 
turnover (how quickly the inventory the company holds is sold). As a prod-
uct’s life span nears its end, moving that product off the shelf tends to be 
harder and harder.
 
When you see a company’s inventory turnover slowing down, it may indicate a 
long-term or short-term problem. Economic conditions, such as a recession — 
which isn’t company-specific — may be the cause of a short-term problem. A 
long-term problem may be a product line that isn’t kept up to date, causing cus-
tomers to look to other companies or products to meet their needs. I show you 
how to pick up on inventory-turnover problems in Chapter 15 by using numbers 
from the income statement and balance sheet.
Slow-Paying Customers
Companies report their sales when the initial transaction occurs, even if the 
customer hasn’t yet paid cash for the product. When a customer pays with 
a credit card issued by a bank or other financial institution, the company 
considers it cash. But credit issued to the customer directly by the company 
selling the product is not reported as cash received. The reason is that the 
customer doesn’t have to pay cash until the company that issues the credit 
bills him. For example, if you have an account at Office Depot that you charge 
your office supplies to, Office Depot won’t get cash for those supplies until 
you pay your monthly statement. If, instead, you buy those same supplies 
using a Visa or MasterCard, the credit card company deposits cash into 
Office Depot’s account and then works to collect the cash from you.
Businesses track noncash sales to customers who buy on credit in an 
account called accounts receivable. Customers are billed for payments, but 
not all customers pay their bills on time. If you see a company’s accounts 
receivable numbers continuing to rise, it may be a sign that customers are 
slowing down their payments, and eventually, the company may face a cash-
flow problem. See Chapter 16 to find out how to detect accounts receivable 
problems.
