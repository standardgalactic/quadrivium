Arrays in Go
●
An array is a composite, indexable type that stores a collection of elements of same type. 
●
An array has a ﬁxed length.
●
Every element in an array (or slice) must be of same type.
●
Go stores the elements of the array in contiguous memory locations and this way it’s very 
eﬃcient.
●
The length and the elements type determine the type of an array. The length belongs to 
array type and it’s determined at compile time .
accounts := [3]int{50, 60, 70 }
The array called accounts that consists of 3 integers has it’s type [3]int.
