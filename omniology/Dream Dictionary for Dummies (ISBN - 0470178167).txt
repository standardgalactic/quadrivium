Dedication
To my sister, Paula, who has been my friend and sound-
ing board all my life. Though she doesn’t remember her
dreams as much as I do, she generously makes time to
listen to me rattle on about mine.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I’ve been blessed with family, friends, and clients
who are good at both giving and receiving. It’s so
empowering to have flow, stimulating conversation,
and honest feedback. I’ve been tremendously enter-
tained and educated by the dreams these people have
shared with me over the years. Plus, working and just
talking with them has taught me a tremendous amount
about perception. 
I’ve written two For Dummies books now, and have
enjoyed both experiences. My editors, Lindsay Lefevere
and Jennifer Connolly, are very good at what they do,
highly professional, and thankfully, patient and kind, as
well! They kept me going as I was writing the dictionary
section of this book, during times I was having to prac-
tice mindfulness and cheerfulness as a way to maintain
my intuitive edge as I delved into yet another word and
what was contained in its depths.
Finally, I’d like to thank Rod McDaniel for his unflagging
support, inspiring suggestions, and enthusiastic belief
in my potential.

Introduction
W
elcome to a fascinating journey into your inner
worlds. Whether you’re already a prolific
dreamer or are just peeking into the unknown, you’re
sure to get results from the insights, techniques, and
tips provided in Dream Dictionary For Dummies. Not
only does this book outline important dream skills,
this book also provides a totally unique dictionary —
a fascinating read in itself — that lists the meanings of
hundreds of dream symbols. 
Before you delve into the nuts and bolts of how this
book is organized, it will help to understand some
important points about dreams so you can use your
dream life to discover more about your inner self: 
 The dream world is not separate from the waking
world; they are extensions of each other and are
mutually supportive and cocreative. 
 Everything you do in dreams is real; it’s just hap-
pening in other dimensions of your awareness. 
 It’s normal for your awareness to constantly shift
through all the dimensions; you change focus 
continually, day and night. 
 Dreamwork is a way to discover what your whole
self, the you beyond your logical mind, is doing.

About This Book
In this book, you find out how to make sense of your
dreams and harness them to increase creativity, solve
problems, find life purpose, and obtain accurate per-
sonal guidance. Even if you just read the dictionary
definitions, you can begin to understand symbology in
a much deeper way. Dreams teach us so much about
what’s possible in life. I want your inner dream life to
help expand your idea of how big you are, how much
knowledge you have to draw from, how much you can
accomplish, and how interconnected you are with
everything and everyone. This book is designed to
help you synchronize your body, emotions, mind, and
soul so that you can experience the divine sanity that
underlies your life’s unfolding. 
In the dictionary portion of this book, you can find
a unique form of symbol definition. Each word has
been defined on three levels (physical, emotional,
and mental-spiritual) so that you can be precise and
holistic when interpreting your dreams. Sometimes
symbols pertain to all the levels at once. The mean-
ings listed in this book are accurate, useful, and
modern.
Throughout this book, you encounter dream diary
writing exercises that can prompt dream insights. The
key to improving your intuition and success with
dreams is to make your normally intangible, uncon-
scious inner world more conscious and real. Writing
about your dreams and dream process in a diary is an
excellent way to do this. I strongly encourage you to
record your dreams every morning. In the evening
before sleep, write about your dream intentions. Your
Dream Dictionary For Dummies 
2

dream diary can be a record of your inner growth
process. I explain tips for doing these things in
Chapter 2.
Just as in any For Dummies book, you can jump in
anywhere, move backward or forward through
the material, and find enormous value. If you want
a concise mini-course on dreamwork and dream
interpretation, read all the chapters in order — I’ve
designed the flow of the material as a developmental
process. If you’re in a hurry and want to jump right in
and see what last night’s dream means, go straight to
the dictionary.
Conventions Used in This Book
So you can navigate through this book more easily, I
use the following conventions:
 Italic is used for emphasis and to highlight terms.
 Bold is used to indicate key ideas and dictionary
words that are defined.
 Sidebars, in gray boxes, give interesting informa-
tion that isn’t critical to understanding the topic
at hand.
Foolish Assumptions
I made some assumptions about you as I was writing,
and if true, this book will be especially useful in your
quest for deeper meaning:
Introduction
3

 You may be disillusioned by most dream diction-
aries because they seem antiquated and not perti-
nent to today’s levels of sophistication about
psychological and spiritual growth.
 You may be interested in dreams casually, but not
quite understand the real power they hold.
 You may be so busy and rushed that you don’t
think you have time to work with your dreams,
even though they fascinate you.
 You may remember your dreams but not have a
variety of useful tools and frameworks to use in
decoding them.
How This Book Is Organized 
Dream Dictionary For Dummies is divided into three
parts and seven chapters. The material flows like this:
Part I: Decode Your Dreams
Part I gives you the basics for establishing a solid,
reliable dream habit and finding the hidden meanings
in your dreams. Chapter 1 gets you started. It gives
good reasons to dream, helps you understand the
basic dream process, and gives tips for enhancing
your ability to dream. Chapter 2 helps you activate
the key components of the dream process, prepare
for sleep and wake up consciously, and keep a dream
diary to track your personal dream process. Chapter 3
helps you know your dream territory and recognize
and work with physical dreams, emotional dreams,
Dream Dictionary For Dummies 
4

and mental-spiritual dreams. In Chapter 4, you’ll dive
into decoding symbols and understanding the multiple
levels of dream meaning. Chapter 5 takes you into
deeper work with decoding your dreams, helping
you make sense of all types of dream experience and
giving you a variety of methods for uncovering hidden
messages.
Part II: Dictionary of Symbols
Part II gives guidelines on how to use a dream diction-
ary, and presents a unique way to understand dream
symbols. You’ll find each word interpreted on three
levels, as it might pertain to the physical world, the
emotional world, and the mental-spiritual worlds.
Part III: The Part of Tens
Part III provides a little “dream dessert.” Here you’ll
find ten useful techniques for exploring dream mes-
sages and ten of the most common dreams and their
meanings.
Icons Used in This Book
There are certain nuances of dreamwork that can
increase your effectiveness. This icon alerts you to
these time- and trouble-saving ideas.

bits of information. Watch for this icon to find some

Part I
Decode Your Dreams

In this part . . .
P
art I gives you the basics for establishing a
solid, reliable dream habit and finding the
hidden meanings in your dreams. In Chapter 1,
you find good reasons to dream and understand
the basic dream process. You can even discover
tips for enhancing your ability to dream.
Chapter 2 helps you activate the key compo-
nents of the dream process, prepare for sleep
and wake up consciously, and keep a dream
diary to track your personal dream process.
Chapter 3 helps you know your dream territory
and recognize and work with physical dreams,
emotional dreams, and mental-spiritual dreams.
In Chapter 4, you dive into decoding symbols
and understanding the multiple levels of dream
meaning. But you can go deeper into dreamwork
in Chapter 5, decoding your dreams, helping you
make sense of all types of dream experience,
and finding a variety of methods for uncovering
hidden messages.

Chapter 1
Opening Your Dream Door
D
reams really are, in the truest sense, a doorway:
to greater self-awareness, knowledge, success,
and the possibility of a rich, full life. Sounds great,
but how do you open and walk through that door?
This chapter is a great place to begin. You’ll see that
there is an actual pathway, with clearly delineated
steps, that can take you from wishful thinking about
dreams to a reliable dream habit. You’ll find your
previously mysterious, invisible inner life can be
revealed on a regular basis to assist you in many
useful ways. 
In this chapter, you’ll discover some specific bene-
fits of an active dream life, familiarize yourself with
the steps in the dream process, and fine tune your
understanding of sleep and dream dynamics. This
way, you can build motivation and enthusiasm, be
aligned with the natural flow of dreams, and get out
of your own way by becoming aware of what inhibits
dreaming.

Dreaming Fully
You can engage with the dream process better after you
have some ideas about what dreaming does. Scientists
write dreams off as the haphazard firing of neurons in
the brain, but when you work deeply with dreams over
time, you begin to understand them quite differently,
seeing their spiritual roots. The following sections will
help stretch your context for dreaming and inspire you
about their vital importance in maintaining a healthy
and happy life. 
The function of dreams
The best way to begin understanding more about your
dream life is to first understand how dreams function:
 Dreams are restorative. When you have uninter-
rupted sleep and go through a series of deepen-
ing dream cycles during the night, you touch into
and revisit your spiritual core and life purpose.
Dreaming helps you stay on track, remember
who you really are, how you fit into the whole,
and renew yourself with fresh life energy and
motivation. 
 Dreams are about creation; the ultimate
Dreamer is your soul. Most cultures where
mystical spiritual experience is valued believe
that the soul projects (think “movie projector”)
or “dreams” the personality and entire physical
life into being. “Life is but a dream,” we so often
hear. When you remember that you are the soul,
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
10

or the Dreamer, and not the dream itself, you have
more power to change the “dream” and create
a life where your destiny can unfold instead of
suffering and pain. You’re not stuck! Dreams
show you what’s possible. All you have to do
is dream something different! You are only as
limited as your imagination.
 Dreams are about learning to be
superconscious — and you’re learning
24 hours a day. You are dreaming not only at
night but during your daytime waking reality,
too. Your nighttime dream world is as real to
your soul as your daytime world. They feed
into each other, inform each other, teach each
other. You, the soul, are never unconscious! You
are always focusing on themes and issues that
further your growth, flowing through different
realms of your awareness. By interpreting day
and night dreams, you can discover what’s
going on in your innermost life.
What’s in it for you?
A productive dream life begins with being fired up and
motivated. You won’t get started or stick with it unless
you understand the benefits that dreaming provides.
So I’ve listed some important ways you can improve
your life by working with dreams:
 Entertain yourself and grow your imagination.
Dreams give you many interesting, fun things to
talk about with your spouse, friends, and family.
Chapter 1: Opening Your Dream Door 11

If you do nothing more than fly without an air-
plane or interact with dragons in your dreams,
you’ll be far richer than if you’d lived by logic
alone. Dreams keep you childlike and open, and
help promote a free, joyful spirit. Since anything
goes in dreams, it’s not much of a stretch to
extend the same dynamic imagination to your
waking reality. Imagination may be one of the
most undervalued skills you have. It determines
the quality of your life, since what you can imag-
ine is truly as far as you’ll let yourself go. Dreams
show you it’s not so hard to move beyond your
comfort zone.
 Discover what’s what in your psyche. Dreams
provide firsthand contact with the fascinating
mystery: “Who am I?” They teach you about your
psychological process and the subconscious
beliefs and fears that interfere with growth and
happiness. Your dreams can show you how to be
more flexible, tolerant, loving, and lovable. 
 Tap your inner wisdom. Dreams relay accurate,
inspired advice from your higher mind, or soul,
the part of you that always knows the truth. They
may even warn of problems that are brewing, or
help you prepare for an upcoming event. Dreams
reveal your unlimited creativity and notify you
when you’re off center and need to realign with
your life purpose. 
 Be all that you can be. Dreams expand your
sense of personal identity because you realize
you’re composed of energy, emotions, thoughts,
and higher patterns of awareness. You’ll start
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
12

thinking of yourself as more than a physical
body and will have access to new realms of
experience that empower you to be more, know
more, and do more. 
 Develop intuition and innovation. Recalling
dreams, interpreting them, and intending them
are all acts that require intuition and imagination.
The more you work with dreams, the more you’ll
learn to trust yourself, and you’ll realize how nat-
urally intuitive and creative you are. 
 Increase real life success. Dreams help you in
real ways — with problem solving, decision
making, improving communication, healing your-
self and others, even manifesting the help and
resources you need. The dream state is a fertile
field awaiting the seeds you sow.
 Melt barriers of time and space. Dreams expand
your capacity to know things that are in the past,
the future, in other locations, and other dimen-
sions of reality. Dreams that come true, or give
you information you couldn’t obtain by normal
means, can open you to know, not just theorize,
that we are all much more vast than we realize. 
Understanding the Steps 
in the Dream Process
To develop a conscious, intentional dream practice
and receive the full benefit from your dreams (for
more on the benefits of dreaming, see the section
Chapter 1: Opening Your Dream Door 13

“What’s in it for you?” earlier in this chapter), it
helps to know the steps in the dream process. Each
step is important and each feeds energy to the others.
Drop one step out and the whole process falls apart.
The following stages are expanded in more detail
in subsequent chapters. The more times you repeat
the full sequence of the following steps, the stronger
and more second nature your dream habit will
become:
1. Intend to remember a dream. The best way to
launch your dream process is to have a strong
resolution to know your own mysteries. Then
be more specific. You can prepare your aware-
ness to be fertile and receptive, but if you want
to dream, you must have a need or curiosity
that serves as an energetic magnet. Decide
what kind of dream, experiences you want to
have. Do you want to visit an exotic place or
connect with a relative who’s died? Do you
want to heal psychological or physical
wounds? Perhaps you’d like to go to school or
to the inventor’s library and learn about future
technologies. Maybe you need help solving a
problem. Pick something specific or ask for
general guidance; then program your subcon-
scious mind before sleep. For example: “I will
remember my most important dream in the
morning.” Or, “Bring me an insight concerning
which job offer to accept.”
2. Sleep well; wake up well. If you’re too
stressed or wake often during the night, your
dream cycles will be disturbed. If you try a few
pointers from the lists of dream inhibitors and
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
14

dream enhancers later in this chapter, you can
learn to get a better night’s sleep. When you
wake in the morning, take a few moments to
gently rise from the depths of sleep, to come
back to daily reality slowly, so you can main-
tain a connection with your dreams. Maintain
the subtle feelings and sensations in your body
before your mind kicks into gear.
3. Recognize dream activity. It’s important to
develop a habit of turning your attention imme-
diately to your dreams as you awake. Let your
first thought of the day be: What have I just
been doing? Dreams come in various forms: a
cinematic saga, a fragment, a single symbol or
word, or even a highlighted experience later in
the day after you awake. Speak in present tense
about dreams: I’m swinging on a rope, jumping
from tree to tree. I sense I might fall. Speaking
to yourself in the past tense can distance you
from the dream.
4. Record your dream. Once you’ve learned to
preserve your live connection with your
dreams, you must do something to make the
dreams real and physical to your body. This
way your body, which is intimately connected
with your subconscious mind, knows you
meant what you said the night before when you
asked to remember your experiences in other
dimensions, and it will cooperate. If you do
nothing, your body will think you’re crying
“Wolf!” So tell someone right away, describe the
dream into a recorder, or write it in your dream
diary! 
Chapter 1: Opening Your Dream Door 15

5. Decode the message. Making sense of your
dream is perhaps the most daunting step, but
also the most fun. There are many techniques
for discovering the hidden messages in
dreams, and you will find lots of ideas in this
book. This is where you will determine what
dream zone you’ve been visiting, where you’ll
use the dream dictionary and penetrate into
your dream symbols. This is where you’ll ask
yourself: How is this dream image, dream
choice, dream action, dream emotion, part
of a process I’m going through right now in
my waking life? How are the dream elements
part of a life lesson I’m learning so I can
become more of my true self? Bringing the
subliminal into conscious awareness validates
the process.
Remember, you are always the best interpreter
of your dreams, though asking for insight from
others can often be helpful.
6. Follow through. If your dream contains guid-
ance, insight, a warning, an answer to a prob-
lem, an inspiring image, or an intriguing
thought, use the information. Follow through
on what you receive, because this is why you
dreamed the dream in the first place — so you
could discover more about yourself. Using
dreamtime insights in daily life reinforces your
intention to connect the two halves of your
experience, completes the dream cycle, and
frees you to move into a new phase of explo-
ration and creativity.
Part I: Decode Your Dreams

7. Do it all again. When establishing a reliable
dream habit, your subconscious mind will
engage fully and bring you dreams consistently
after you repeat this process at least three
times. Some people say seven times, just to be
sure.
Tuning In to Your Dreamtime
Dynamics
Science tells us that everyone dreams for a total of
approximately two or three hours per night. Robbed of
vital dream activity through sleep deprivation or stress, 
we become irritable and disoriented, and will balance
ourselves by dreaming excessively the first chance we
get. 
The dreams of children are shorter than those of adults
and often contain animals and monsters. Nearly 40 per-
cent of children’s dreams are nightmares, which may be
part of the normal developmental process of learning to
cope.
In the following sections, you explore the stages of the
natural sleep/dream cycle you progress through sev-
eral times each night, and I give you various ways you
can improve your sleep/dream cycle. 
Know your dream cycles 
Every night you rotate through four basic phases of
sleep that repeat approximately every 90 minutes.
During these cycles, you oscillate between awareness
Chapter 1: Opening Your Dream Door 17

that is close to waking reality and awareness that pen-
etrates deep into the collective, spiritual realms.
What’s important to understand here is that if your
deep sleep cycles are disturbed, you may not be able
to renew your vitality and sense of purposefulness
easily.
 Phase one: Brainwaves slow from their waking fre-
quency, called beta, to the more relaxed alpha
state, where you may feel you are floating, and pic-
tures may drift through your mind. Your muscles
relax, and your pulse, blood pressure, and temper-
ature drop slightly. 
 Phase two: Your brainwaves slow more until they
reach the level known as theta. You are now in a
light sleep state characterized by many bursts of
brain activity. Most dreams occur at this level,
during which the eyes move back and forth rap-
idly beneath the eyelids. This is known as Rapid
Eye Movement, or REM sleep, and it lasts from
several minutes to an hour.
During REM sleep, your extremities may twitch,
but most of your body is paralyzed. Your heart
may beat erratically, and breathing can become
irregular and shallow. When awakened, you easily
remember your dreams. A newborn infant experi-
ences eight to ten hours of REM sleep per day. By
age five, a child’s sleep pattern has become
almost the same as an adult’s.
 Phases three and four: In the third and fourth
phases, about 20 to 45 minutes after you fall
asleep, your brainwaves finally reach the ultra-
slow, regular delta frequency, which produces a
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
18

deep, “dead sleep.” You progress from 20 percent
delta waves in phase three to over 50 percent in
phase four. If awakened during either of these
stages, you feel fuzzy and lost; so resist waking
fully, and drop back to sleep immediately.
Chapter 1: Opening Your Dream Door 19
Dream breakthroughs 
Many people have made discoveries while dreaming. Here are some
examples of extraordinary breakthroughs that can inspire you to pay
close attention to the deeper meanings of your dreams:
 Friedrich August von Kekule: A professor of chemistry in Ghent,
von Kekule had been searching for the molecular structure of
benzene. In 1865, while dozing before his fire, he dreamed of a
snake seizing its own tail. He awoke suddenly with the revolu-
tionary idea that certain organic compounds are not open struc-
tures, but form closed chains or rings.
 Melvin Calvin: A 1961 Nobel Laureate in chemistry for his work
with photosynthesis, Calvin, while daydreaming in his parked car,
recognized the structure of phosphoglyceric acid in a matter of
seconds.
 William Blake: The English artist and poet William Blake, while
searching for a less expensive method of engraving his illus-
trated songs, dreamed his dead younger brother, Robert,
appeared to him and revealed a process of copper engraving,
which Blake immediately tested, verified, and began using. 
 Elias Howe: Howe, who invented the sewing machine, couldn’t
figure out how the needle would work. He dreamed he was taken
prisoner by natives who danced around him with spears that had
holes near their tips. He changed his design to incorporate the
dream’s idea and it worked!

Enhance your dream ability 
Like so many people today, you may be working too
many hours, or splitting your time between too many
people and activities. You may be living on the surface
of yourself, feeling frustrated, disgruntled, and frag-
mented. By the time bedtime comes, you’re probably
too keyed up to sleep well. In the morning you may
still be too tired to think seriously about the “luxury”
of interpreting your dreams. Put some attention on the
need to harmonize the flow of your sleep cycle and
dream process by eliminating dream inhibitors and
focusing on dream enhancers. By doing so, you can
nurture yourself and maximize your success in all
areas of your life. Familiarize yourself with the follow-
ing things that either detract from or add to dreaming
proficiency:
 Dream inhibitors: Drugs such as marijuana,
cocaine, barbiturates, sleeping pills, tranquiliz-
ers, muscle relaxants, many mood-stabilizing
drugs, as well as alcohol, tobacco, and stimulants
like caffeine and amphetamines — can delay
sleep, reduce your amount of REM sleep, and
your ability for dream recall. Dream activity also
can decrease when you are socially overactive
and too stressed. Too much aerobic exercise
close to bedtime tends to release adrenaline,
which can prevent sleep. 
 Dream enhancers: Dream activity occurs more
frequently when you’ve been engaged in quiet,
private activities like meditating, reading,
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
20

studying, or after a period of new learning. Eating
foods like turkey, milk, bananas, or cheese, that
contain the amino acid tryptophan, before bed
can have a sedating effect. Vitamin B complex,
especially B6, has been shown to produce more
vivid dreams, as has the herb St. John’s Wort. The
hormone melatonin seems to help regulate your
body clock, and even a small amount has been
shown to help induce drowsiness. Ask your
physician before you take any kind of supple-
ments, however, and be sure not to exceed the
recommended doses. A warm bath before bed
can also lead to dreaming, since as you cool
down afterward, you tend to get sleepy.

Chapter 2
Increasing Dream Recall
B
ringing dreams back from the dream world is
both a science and an art. If you follow some
proven principles and pay attention to your attitude
and intuition, you can easily recall your dreams. The
key is: The more you remember your dreams, the
more you’ll remember your dreams! In this chapter,
I show you how to prepare to dream and how to
develop a reliable dream habit.
Starting the Flow with a Positive
Attitude and Open Intuition
In Chapter 1, I outline the steps in the dream process.
You can maximize the results from that process by
following these tips to keep your attitude positive and
your intuition open:
 Keep your attitude positive by being enthusias-
tic about the power of dreams. Start with a posi-
tive, expectant attitude. Talk to yourself about
what exists: what you do enjoy, what you are

doing, what you have now. Prime yourself with
curiosity and let it percolate. A soft, receptive,
nonjudgmental attitude helps the perfect dream
occur. Record your dreams happily and grate-
fully; this tells your subconscious mind that it
did a good job.
 Keep your intuition open by trusting yourself
and the process. Whatever you receive is just
right because your soul is running the show!
Stay neutral, centered in your body, and in the
moment when doing dreamwork. Be true to your
own sense of things, find similarities between
ideas and themes, and be honest about what’s
real. Trust first impressions but penetrate into
the core with sustained attention. 
Dream recall decreases when you’re stressed
and anxious, yet increases with enthusiasm.
Also, dreamwork decreases with depression
and increases when you’re calm and centered.
Creating a Dream Motive
To facilitate your dream recall, it helps to keep your
motivation strong by first clearing any blocks in your
subconscious mind. These fear-based ideas can inter-
fere with your receiving the dream insights you need
to further your personal growth. First, let’s get an idea
of some sample blocks; then you can pinpoint your
own sabotaging ideas and dissolve them. After that,
I’ll show you how to build your dream motive through
heightened curiosity and the habit of noticing sym-
bolic images.
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
24

Clear subconscious blocks
You won’t let yourself remember dreams if doing so
makes you scared or unhappy. True, it’s uncomfortable
to face your “dark side,” but clearing subconscious fear
brings relief, gives you permission to get more out of
life, and produces an immediate increase in dream
range and recall. Your subconscious might block
dreams for a variety of reasons; for example, if you
remember your dreams:
 You might have to admit you know more than you
let on to others and yourself.
 You might have to experience your anger con-
cerning your father. 
 You might discover how preoccupied you are
with sex and won’t be able to be the “good girl”
anymore. 
 You might dream that someone you love is going
to die, and you don’t want to know “bad” things. 
 You might have to admit your girlfriend isn’t the
best partner for you.
To discover and clear your dream blocks, try the fol-
lowing writing exercise:
1. Quiet your mind. Make a list of responses to
the following statements: 
I do not want dreams to bring me infor-
mation about ________________________.
I do not want dreams to make me have to
feel _________________________________.
Chapter 2: Increasing Dream Recall 25

I do not want dreams to change my life 
by ________________________________.
I do not want dreams to overwhelm me 
by ________________________________.
2. Look at the answers and ask yourself: Why
not? Why not have information about mon-
sters? Why not feel what it’s like to fall? Why
not change my life by quitting a job that bores
me? Write about how, if you allowed each
thing, your life might improve.
List some trigger questions
Curiosity is a great motivator! By periodically making
a list of intriguing questions — things you want to
know about — you will prime your subconscious
to use dreams as vehicles for answers. Later we’ll
work with incubating a specific dream, but for now
let’s just free up your imagination! I’ve given some
examples in the following list; you can add others
that address your important needs and greatest
curiosities:
 What do I need to know about my body to
improve my health?
 What beliefs are interfering with my seeing my
current life situation clearly?
 What is the next growth phase of my career?
 How can I connect with my grandparents who
died?
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
26

 How can I improve my relationship with my
spouse?
 What is causing my child’s anxiety and irritability,
and what can I do about it?
 How can I move through my writer’s block and
jumpstart my creativity? 
Notice symbolic images
Another good way to prompt the dream flow is
to notice things that seem dreamlike or symbolic
during the day. Perhaps you see a vibrant flower
with a dragonfly on it, a person fixing a flat tire,
or a child holding a large dog in her arms. Any of
these could be in an actual dream scene because
they contain meaning-loaded symbols. Keep a
notebook and jot down images or events that seem
intriguing. By building the habit of noticing symbols,
you’ll increase the tendency to recall your nighttime
dream symbols. When you start working more deeply
with symbol interpretation in Chapters 4 and 5,
you’ll be speaking the language of symbols much
more fluently. Here are some examples of dreamlike
images from daily life:
 Your car won’t start.
 There is thick fog in the morning.
 A crow sits on the fence and caws at you.
 You break a tooth.
 You find a twenty-dollar bill.
Chapter 2: Increasing Dream Recall 27

Preparing for Sleep
To grease the wheels of the dream cycle, remember
that your daytime reality connects to your night-
time reality, and the night to the day, in an ongoing
continuum. By making an intentional connection
between day and night, then night and day, you’ll
see the current themes in your life more clearly,
and more cohesive information will come
through your sleep dreams, daydreams, and
waking dreams. 
For example, you may be unconsciously involved
in a debilitating codependent relationship by day,
dream at night that your partner is secretly poisoning
you, daydream about a past romantic partner who
embodied healthy characteristics, see an animal
being inordinately affectionate, and start to sob
without realizing why you’re so moved. All of this is
your soul speaking to you in dream language about
loving yourself more.
To be more aware 24 hours a day, I show you how to 
prepare for sleep in an intentional way, and then how
to wake up more consciously.
Review and complete the day
Before you drop into your dream world, take stock of
what you accomplished during the day and what you
wanted to do when you set out in the morning. This
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
28

frees your mind to pay attention to what you do in
your dreams and helps you dream more intentionally.
Some questions to ask:
 Did I do what I wanted to do today? 
 Am I proud of the way I behaved? Did I treat
anyone badly that I’d like to make amends for
tomorrow?
 Was I wasteful? disciplined? playful? 
 What am I grateful for that happened today? 
Set your intention to dream
Next, take some quiet time to review your trigger
questions, pressing needs, or childlike curiosities.
What experiences do you want to have in your
dreams? Do you want to visit an old friend, fly
without a plane, learn more about plants, solve
a career problem, talk to spiritual guides, or
help others? Once you have a goal, try the follow-
ing technique to align your body and mind for
dreaming:
1. Think enthusiastic, imaginative thoughts.
Dreams are so wonderful! It’s going to be fun
to dream tonight. I’m going to pay special
attention to (flying)! 
2. As you prepare for sleep, sit on the side
of your bed, close your eyes, and talk to 
yourself about your intentions. Tell yourself:
Chapter 2: Increasing Dream Recall 29

I am relaxed and ready. My body knows
exactly how to have the perfect dream. My
intuition is functioning perfectly to deliver
my dream accurately to my mind. My mind
knows how to recognize my most important
dreams and describe them in detail. My
soul knows what I really need to know. I
trust all my parts. 
Once you’ve aligned yourself, try this exercise to
incubate a specific dream:
1. Put attention at the back of your neck
where your head and neck join. Nod your
head up and down so you can feel the spot
exactly.
2. Imagine a small ball of golden light floating
in front of you.
3. Think about what you want to achieve in
your dreams and formulate a concise sen-
tence describing your goal. Make it simple
and specific. In the morning when I wake
up, I will remember my most important
dreams. Or, I will fly in my dreams tonight
and remember my flying dreams. Or, I will
wake with an insight about how I can heal
my back pain.
4. Repeat the sentence several times, and then
visualize it. Put it inside the ball of golden
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
30

light. Let the light illuminate and activate the
sentence.
5. Place the ball of golden light, with its
dream seed, inside the back of your neck
at that magic spot. Let the soft warm light
gently penetrate and dissolve into your
reptile brain and carry your message to
the place where it can be acted upon. Relax
and trust that this will occur as you sleep,
and in the morning, you’ll wake refreshed
with the response you’ve requested. When
you feel at ease, happy, and confident, lie
down and go to sleep, smiling.
Dedicate your bedroom to dreaming. Instead of
using your bed as an office, think of your bedroom
as a personal sleep sanctuary. To quiet your bed-
room, remove noisemakers like television, radio,
and telephone. Move the bookcases to another room.
Meditate in bed, sitting up, before sleep, or use the
time to write in your dream diary.
Waking Up Consciously
The next part of working with the continuous circuit
of day and night is to complete your nighttime expe-
rience by recalling and recording your dreams, then
setting clear intentions for the day, which you will
review the next night before sleep. To do that, you
Chapter 2: Increasing Dream Recall 31

must wake up with the least amount of disturbance.
If you’re jangled awake by a loud alarm or barking
dogs, your connection to your dreams can easily be
broken. Consider having an alarm go off in another
room, waking to soft music, or having a light turn on
automatically.
If you sleep like a log and wake too groggy to remember
a dream, try a sequence of waking mechanisms that
builds in intensity: A light goes on, music in another
room sounds, and finally an alarm next to your bed
rings. Before sleep, suggest to yourself that you’ll
notice each of the signals and wake progressively
with each.
Maintain soft awareness
Leaving extra time for dreamwork in the morning
pays off. Float a moment or two before your “to do”
mind kicks in. That soft, still mental state helps
you stay connected to the frequency of the dream
world, and your dreams often pop up magically.
Here are some recall tips to practice first thing
after waking:
 Say to yourself: What have I just been doing?
Where have I been? 
 Keep the subtle sensations in your body. 
 Scan internally for the most predominant images
floating in your soft awareness.
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
32

 Describe the images, subtle feelings or emotions,
and actions you’ve taken in the dream in present
tense. 
 Make your dreams conscious and real. Tell some-
one, describe the dream into a recorder, or write
it in your diary. You don’t have to interpret the
dream right now.
Create your day intentionally
After recording your dreams, turn your attention to
the day. Collect yourself; be centered and calm.
What’s left from yesterday that you want to complete
today? You’re creating your day the same way you
created your dreams. Tonight, before sleep, you’ll
review and complete your daytime goals. Make a list
of your intentions:
 What impact do I want to have on other people,
and on the world, today? 
 What kind of experience and attitude do I want to
have today? 
 What do I want to give and receive today? 
Recalling Your Dreams by
Keeping a Dream Diary
Writing about your dreams helps make them more
real to your body, which reinforces the dream habit.
Chapter 2: Increasing Dream Recall 33

A diary is a great way to monitor your dreams, see
what themes you’ve been focusing on, and how
your dreams have come true or been insightful.
Here I show you how to make the most of your
dream diary.
Personalize your diary
To help build the “fun” factor, so important to motivat-
ing yourself to have a rich dream life, make your diary
a favorite object. Fill it with stimulating sensory ele-
ments, interesting things to pay attention to, and
useful organization and design ideas: 
 Are you neat and tidy? A small, bound journal
with a tasteful design on the cover, smooth paper,
and narrow lines might suit you. 
 Are you colorful, impulsive, and dramatic? You
might like a large sketchbook with pages that fall
open easily with no restricting lines. Or maybe
you’d prefer a cheap spiral-bound notebook from
the drugstore.
 Type your dreams in a computer cyber-diary.
Using a cyber-diary is a speedy way for you to
edit and add on, but it isn’t quite as tactile and
sensory as a paper journal, and doesn’t stimulate
the dream centers as well. 
 Divide each page in half vertically or horizon-
tally. Use half to record your dreams, and half to
divine the meaning. Or use two-thirds of the page
for dreams and a third as a margin for notes. 
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
34

You can capture your dream in the middle of the night
by having your diary or a piece of paper handy along
with a pen light. 
Use your diary effectively
Think of your dream diary as a record of what’s going
on in the hidden dimensions of your life. You’re a pri-
vate eye on a stakeout, conducting surveillance.
Besides recording your dreams, you can use your
diary for other things as well. Try any of these ideas:
 Write about your dream goals and your dream-
sabotaging ideas.
 Examine your sleep pattern and cycles.
 Collect images from magazines, books, flyers, and
so on, that trigger dreams and make collages, dia-
grams, and illustrations with those images. 
 Write or copy inspirational quotes, poetry, and
prayers. 
 Write about waking dreams, dream fragments,
and single symbols.
 Write the date of each dream and put a star next
to important dreams.
 Write in the present tense, recording as many
details as you can.
 Document your dream incubation statements. 
 Write about dream images that have carried over
from the previous day and what happens in the
days after an important dream.
Chapter 2: Increasing Dream Recall 35

Use the back of your diary
Create a section in the back of your diary where you
keep ongoing lists. It stimulates your imagination to
see so many ideas clustered together, and you may
notice repeating themes that will factor into your
interpretations. Here are some possible lists:
 My many faces: What myriad roles do you play in
your dreams?
 My dreamscapes: Where do you travel and what
places do you frequent in your dreams?
 My dream teams: Who do you dream about?
 My dream symbols: What images repeat in your
dreams? What images surprise you and why?
 My dream themes: What issues concern or
bother you in your dreams? What activities are
you repeatedly focusing on in your dreams?
Write even if no dreams come
You’ll remember dreams more consistently if
you commit to writing something — a dream or
pseudo-dream — in your diary every day. Here
are some ideas that can make writing in your diary
more rewarding:
 Write about your emotional state. If you can’t
recall a dream after you programmed one, write
about the emotional state you woke up in, how
your body feels, your first thoughts, or the first
person who comes to mind. It’s important to give
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
36

your body the message that you meant what you
said the night before. So, make up a dream; your
body won’t know the difference, and your dream
habit will grow stronger.
 Invent a dream character, dream locale, and a
dream theme. Start your story with Once upon a
time . . . . Describe the physical landscape. Ask:
What does this character need? Let your charac-
ter ask a question. Exaggerate whenever you can.
Describe things using lots of sense-oriented
adjectives and adverbs. Who’s innocent, who’s
the bad guy, and who’s the good guy? Have the
characters learn something. Create a title a five
year old would like.
Take your dream diary with you when you travel. Most
people report that dreams are more active when they
are away from their routine and sleep in new places.

Chapter 3
Identifying Dream 
Activity
A
s you prepare to find the meaning of your
dreams, you’ll want to know what kinds of
dreams are possible. Identifying the categories
and focus of your dreams is one of the first steps
in dream interpretation. Dreams appear both at
night and during the day, and they occur within
several distinct realms or zones of awareness,
fulfilling various functions. In this chapter, I show
you the differences between, and how to work
constructively with, the physical, emotional, and
mental-spiritual dream zones.
Knowing Your Dream Territory
Dreams cover a lot of territory, bringing you insight
about mundane things like solving problems at work
and preventing illness, or loftier things like helping
you stay on purpose spiritually. Dreams also reveal
ways your energy and awareness can be stuck,

through repressed, blocked emotions, or locked-in
beliefs you’ve never examined. During the night and
day, your dreams speak to you on one or all of the
following levels:
 Your subconscious mind (suppressed fears and
ideas that block soul expression) and your super-
conscious mind (wisdom and love that free soul
expression).
 Your body and physical life, your emotional
life, your fixed beliefs and important new ideas,
and your spiritual destiny and life purpose.
 Your individual growth process, other people 
and their growth processes, the evolution of your
relationships, and society’s collective process of
evolution.
 Or they may speak to you on many levels of your-
self simultaneously.
Notice waking dreams 
and daydreams
Your soul dreams your entire waking world into
existence, and no Hollywood director can rival its
mastery over plot, dialogue, timing, and special
effects. When you need a wake-up call or a clue to
a new direction, your soul can create an experience —
a waking dream — that gets your attention through
shock, drama, humor, or amazing coincidence and
synchronicity.
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
40

A waking dream is a real-time standout symbol or
experience that seems like a “sign,” or a short series
of images tied together in an attention-getting way.
These experiences have an emphasis that makes you
want to pay closer attention. In Chapter 2, I ask you
to notice dreamlike images during the day to prime
your mind to focus on symbols so you can bring
more symbols back from your nighttime dreams,
but also so you can begin to interpret waking dreams
and daydreams.
There are hidden messages in waking dreams, and
they can be interpreted just like nighttime dreams.
Here are some examples of what waking dreams might
mean: 
 Waking dream: You’re not sure you should go
out with your old lover, and the day before your
date, your car’s clutch breaks and you can’t
drive. 
Possible meaning: You’re telling yourself that 
being with this person again could handicap your
full self-expression.
 Waking dream: On a driving trip you see three
dead owls on the roadside in an hour. 
Possible meaning: You are drawing your atten-
tion to the need to pay more attention to the
wisdom of your body, mind, and spirit.
 Waking dream: You’ve been criticized for be-
ing insensitive. In the early morning as you’re
Chapter 3: Identifying Dream Activity 41

jogging, two spotted fawns cross your path and
aren’t afraid of you. 
Possible meaning: You need to feel more inno-
cent and share your heart energy with others
more.
 Waking dream: Your sink, dishwasher, and toilet
back up and overflow. 
Possible meaning: You need to clear an emo-
tional block that is clogging your creative flow
and life force.
Daydreams may be a little harder to recognize at
first, because you tend to be absent-minded or
“spaced out” while they’re occurring. See if you
can catch some of your flights of fancy, subliminal
conversations with imaginary characters, or uncon-
scious visions and wishes, and then write about your
underlying concerns, desires, and growth themes in
your dream diary.
If it takes less than five minutes to fall asleep, you’re 
probably sleep-deprived. The ideal drop-off time is
10-15 minutes, meaning you’re tired enough to sleep
deeply, but haven’t been exhausted all day. Sleep apnea
or deprivation can sometimes cause overactive hypno-
gomic visions as you’re falling asleep, or hypnopompic
hallucinations as you’re waking up. For example, you
may hear a dream’s soundtrack, feel things that aren’t
there, or glimpse vivid dream fragments while you’re
half awake.
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
42

Notice the dream zones
All dream experiences are real at some level. Dreams
are always about a process of growth, and they occur
in one of the dream zones or dimensions of awareness: 
 Physical
 Emotional
 Mental-spiritual
When interpreting your dreams, you’ll start by identify-
ing what part of your growth process you’re working
on. Is your dream about a problem in your physical
world, like needing to sell your house? Are you focus-
ing on your emotional world and a fear of displeasing
someone, or how angry you are about a betrayal? Are
you focusing on your mental-spiritual realm, wanting to
receive new information and inspired guidance? By
knowing the dream zone, you can more easily pinpoint
the source of the issues you’re trying to understand,
dissolve, or create.
Notice movement between zones:
Flying, falling, diving, climbing
During both day and night, you move constantly
through the dream zones, shifting your awareness
up or down in frequency. When you “space out”
during the day, for example, you’re actually ascending
into higher zones, and when you shudder suddenly,
Chapter 3: Identifying Dream Activity 43

you’re descending to the physical world in a rush of
consciousness. At night, the movement between
dream zones might be symbolized by flying, falling,
climbing, or diving. Ascending with or without a
vehicle is a representation of the mind expanding
to a higher zone or dimension. Descending, via an
elevator or staircase or by free falling, is a symbol of
your mind returning to the “lower, slower” physical
reality. 
The most important part of dream interpretation is
being able to track what your inner awareness is
actually doing. The basic movement of your con-
sciousness between zones accounts for many of the
symbols you will encounter.
Recognizing and Working 
with a Physical Dream
Many dreams deal with the functioning of the physical
world. Some of the topics of physical zone dreams are:
 Daily residue: You watch a scary movie before
bed, argue with your mate, or bring a problem
home from work, then continue to process it in a
dream.
 Health and healing: You receive information
about a disturbance in your energy flow, or body,
so you can avoid a budding health problem.
Martha dreamed she entered a rehab center,
and the counselor gently took a glass of wine out
of her hand. She hadn’t realized she was drinking
too much.
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
44

 Problem solving and decision making: You
receive guidance so you can proceed in your 
life. An interior designer needed an innovative
focal point for a large wall and dreamed of using
ladders in an odd, interesting arrangement.
 Skill development: You accelerate your learn-
ing by practicing in your dreams a new ability
you’re trying to learn in waking life. Jenn, a
new professor, worried about being good
enough in front of her large classes and dreamed
repeatedly of public speaking until she was
totally comfortable.
Recognize physical symbols
As you learn to work with symbols in the next chapters,
it will help to recognize images that pertain to physical
processes. Here are some examples of physical zone
symbols:
 State of your body: Jar, earthenware pot, bowl,
cup, glass, cave, basement, house, room, closet,
train, bus, car, trailer, motorcycle, bicycle, tree,
actual organs, tumors, body parts, aura
 Body processes: Eating, drinking, chewing,
urinating, defecating, vomiting, washing,
shaving, swelling, growing, flowing, breathing,
stoppages
 Health issues: Hospital, clinic, doctors, nurses, 
surgery, massage or bodywork, energy healing,
acupuncture, bandages, casts, X-rays, injec-
tions, construction, digging, sculpting, jogging,
exercising
Chapter 3: Identifying Dream Activity 45

Make a physical dream 
work for you
Try the following writing exercise to track your “daily
residue” dreams:
1. Look through your dream diary for dreams
that might have been triggered by something
that happened in daily life. Did the dream pro-
vide further insights that you applied? What
happened right after you had the dream? Write
about these things in your diary.
2. When you find a connection between a per-
ception in waking reality and a similar
dream, write about the underlying theme.
What was it about the original trigger experi-
ence that made you focus on it so much that
you needed to dream about it? What is your
soul telling you?
Recognizing and Working 
with an Emotional Dream
Every time you express or deny intensity of feeling,
you can be sure there is fodder for a powerful emo-
tional dream. Though dreams from the emotional zone
can be disturbing, they provide guidance about clear-
ing blocks to superconscious experience. Some topics
of emotional zone dreams are:
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
46

 Psychological processing: You root out fears, pain,
vulnerabilities, blind spots, and subconscious
blockages so you can become conscious of
what holds you back, clear it, and be courageous
and free. You may dream about fears of being
powerless, in pain, unworthy, unsuccessful, out
of control, overwhelmed, victimized, rejected,
losing loved ones, changing, dying, or facing
the void.
 Taboos: You explore forbidden territory, inhibi-
tions, and suppressed desires, often about sex,
crime, or antisocial behavior, as a way to free self-
expression. Cheryl, a sensible accountant by day,
dreamed of wild sexual trysts with rock stars by
night. Joe acted out his secret vengeance
thoughts about his self-centered brother.
 Relationship dynamics: You receive insights
about how you relate to others and how you give
and receive so you can improve your ability to
love. This includes learning to balance your inter-
nal yin and yang energy. One woman dreamed she
was a helpless passenger in a car driven by
another, aggressive woman. Another dreamed she
took her obnoxious neighbor a cake instead of
reporting him to the police.
 Past life memory: You travel in time to revisit
memories of other lives, or to clear blocked
energy where emotion is stuck. You re-experience,
in a dream, a previous death, trauma, remorse,
deep grief, terror, or a situation where you had
too much ego.
Chapter 3: Identifying Dream Activity 47

 Precognitive warnings: You receive forewarning
of sudden change or upheaval: A loved one is
about to die, you are soon to lose your job or part-
ner, or the world is about to experience a shocking
event like Pearl Harbor, Kennedy’s assassination,
or September 11. Or, you are shown an omen to
watch for that is a clue to success in a new
endeavor.
 Out of body travel: You collapse time and space
and visit a distant sick friend you’re worried
about, have a visitation from a dead relative with
a message for you, or travel with a friend who’s
actually in India. 
Recognize emotional symbols
With a little practice, you can figure out how to imme-
diately sense the “charge” that’s often present with
emotional zone symbols. Here are some examples of
images that pertain to emotional processes:
 State of your emotions: Water, lake, ocean,
river, pool, swamp, flood, tidal wave, swimming,
diving, fishing, drowning, boats, rafts, water
vehicles, fire, house burning, forest or brush fire,
campfire, fire in a fireplace, smoke, explosion,
storm, tornado, hurricane, earthquake, volcano,
mudslide
 Emotional processes and issues: Babies, children,
fish, snakes, lions, tigers, bears, sharks, dolphins,
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
48

puppies, hummingbirds, otters, horses, elephants,
sex, relationships, celebrities, battle, betrayal,
hiding, hoarding, being drained, being chased,
exposure, nudity, poison, suffocation, paralysis,
prison, weapon, trap, losing or finding important
items or money
Make an emotional dream 
work for you
Use your diary to press into emotional issues and
explore deeper feelings with the following exercise:
1. Write about a relationship dream, a night-
mare, and a sex dream, asking yourself about
each: If I accept what’s happening in the dream
and extend the action further, what happens?
If I let the dream take an odd turn, what might
happen that I never expected? 
2. Write out three of your wildest fantasies
about sex, taboos, the dark side, or death.
It’s okay to be politically incorrect! Write about
what you learn. 
Teenagers and small children need about ten hours
of sleep, while those over 65 need about six. For the
average adult, eight hours is optimal. Some studies
suggest women need up to an hour’s extra sleep a
night compared to men, and not getting it may be one
reason women are more susceptible to depression.
Chapter 3: Identifying Dream Activity 49

Recognizing and Working with 
a Mental-Spiritual Dream
Many dreams deal with patterns and processes in
your mental and spiritual realms. Some of the topics
of mental-spiritual zone dreams are:
 Mental clutter: You become aware of fixed mental
beliefs, worries, and rigid ideas, as well as infor-
mation that doesn’t belong to you, so you can dis-
solve it and expand into greater self-expression.
Donna dreamed she was to inherit the posses-
sions of the women in her mother’s lineage.
Instead of great treasures, she received tiny
restrictive shoes, primitive sewing implements,
and raggedy clothes. She realized she needed to
clear a belief system based on limitation that she
inherited from her mother.
 Guidance: You receive instructions or guidance,
often from historical figures, spiritual guides,
dead relatives, or animals, to know how to pro-
ceed or that you are supported. Susan dreamed
she was putting on mascara, but had the mascara
with the wand she didn’t like. There is another
kind she just bought that has a perfect wand.
Where is it? From this fragment, she realized she
wanted her new business to be the way she
wanted it to be, not the way others were telling
her it should be.
 Teaching others: You teach others so you can see
how wise you really are. Steven, a car mechanic,
dreamed he was teaching a large class, gesturing
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
50

with a piece of chalk. On the blackboard were
scrawled complex mathematical formulas. He
realized he must know about math and have
teaching ability that he’d never tried to develop.
 Creativity: You experience creative genius to
remind you of your potential and how much you
love innovation and artistic expression. Dennis
dreamed he was painting the air, and a scene
from reality revealed itself with each brush-
stroke. He realized the paintbrush was his own
perception, and that he could create his reality
as effortlessly as he painted the air.
 Interdimensional communication: You connect
with loved ones who’ve died, historical figures,
extraterrestrials, or your soulgroup (people who
feel like spiritual family) as a way to remember
your multidimensional nature. Mary dreamed her
dead father brought her a birthday present.
Inside the box were numbers she somehow knew
were the vibrations of her true self.
 Parallel realities: You explore other worlds and
parallel realities that reveal new aspects of your-
self. A housewife had regular dreams about being
part of a mission impossible-style team in which
she was a courageous, undercover operative. She
realized she was smarter and had more power
than she thought. 
 Extrasensory perception: You develop expanded
perception, like clairvoyance, telepathy, time
travel, materialization, teleportation, spiritual
healing, and enlightenment to find a higher view-
point. Paula dreamed she went inside a sick boy’s
Chapter 3: Identifying Dream Activity 51

body and made him vomit up a stomach full of
poppy seeds; the boy, who she didn’t know, was a
drug addict.
 Spiritual awakening: You learn to regulate your
awareness to open to more enlightenment. Jack
dreamed he had to fly through a shallow band of
energy with lots of little explosions in it. Jack
stretched out flat and held steady so he wouldn’t
hit the sparks. He passed through easily. He real-
ized he was learning to tune out negative
thoughts so he could reach spiritual truth.
 Global-collective visions: You see trends and
events that pertain to the earth and people as a
whole over long periods of history and into the
future. Rob dreamed he saw an ancient time when
the Egyptian pyramids were surrounded by water,
and was surprised later to find reports that it
may have been true.
Recognize mental-spiritual symbols
Let’s look at the symbols that represent mental
processes and spiritual growth. Here are some
examples:
 State of your mind: Air, wind, storms; things
that fall from the sky like hailstones or satellites;
caged birds, low-flying birds like owls, crows,
jays, or sparrows; ruler, tape measure, closed
box, hourglass, numbers, calendar, spider web,
spider; library, university, books, dictionary,
elementary school, exams; attic, hat, headband,
scarf on head
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
52

 Mental processes: Flying close to earth, airplane,
hang glider, sailplane, balloon, jet, elevator, tall
buildings, skyscraper, high tension line, ladder,
tower, futuristic technologies, geometric pat-
terns, spoken words, written language; crystal,
diamond, jewels
 Spiritual growth processes: Rocket, spaceship, 
UFO, flying high above earth, white birds, feathers,
hummingbird, eagle, hawk, dragonfly; climbing tall
ladders, staircases, or mountains; lotus flower,
standing snake, spiritual teachers and guides, reli-
gious figures, angels, spiral, city, colony, confer-
ence; grids of light, sun, planets, galaxies, northern
lights, stars, outer space, the void
Make a mental-spiritual dream
work for you
Use this dream diary exercise to find insight about
your mind’s dynamics and discover messages from
spirit:
1. Pick five recent dreams and write about
them: If this dream were talking to me about
my mental clutter, what beliefs or worries
might I eliminate? If this dream were talking to
me about the fixed ideas that are holding me
back, what might they be?
2. List your three most pressing questions:
Imagine that a wise guide, teacher, animal, or
historical figure comes and gives you advice.
Write out your dialogue as though it is a dream
sequence.

Fun dream facts
You may be intrigued by a few of these interesting facts about 
dreaming:
 To fall asleep we must cool off; body temperature and the brain’s
sleep-wake cycle are closely linked. The blood flow mechanism
that transfers core body heat to the skin works best between 64
and 86 degrees. Later in life, the comfort zone shrinks to between
73 and 77 degrees — one reason older people have more sleep
problems.
 The luminous rays from a digital alarm clock can be enough to
interfere with the sleep cycle. The light turns off a neural switch
in the brain, causing levels of a key sleep chemical to decline
within minutes. Scientists have not been able to explain a study
showing that a bright light shone on the backs of our knees can
reset the brain’s sleep-wake clock.
 Men tend to dream more about other men, while women dream
equally about men and women. Over two thirds of dreamers report
experiencing déjà vu in their dreams, though it’s more common in
women. All mammals dream, and other animals may also dream.
Elephants sleep standing up during non-REM sleep, but lie down
for REM sleep.
 You cannot snore and dream simultaneously! Sleep apnea, or
strangulated breathing, occurs often as muscles relax deeply in
REM sleep and the body then tends to wake suddenly from an
adrenalin-fueled need to reopen the airways. This interferes with
dreaming.
 Flying dreams are found worldwide and have existed since
ancient times, long before the invention of the airplane. Dreams
are penetrable; it has been found experimentally that you can
communicate with a person who is dreaming.

Chapter 4
Unlocking the Secrets 
in Symbols
S
ymbols are the language of dreams, an intuitive
shortcut your soul uses to talk to you. They
convey a vast amount of encoded information that
always pertains to your own process of living and
evolving. Every symbol is somehow about you. In a
typical dream scene composed of a group of symbols
you can find clues to how you’re developing, what
you want to create, how you need to heal, or how
to make correct choices. In this chapter, I show
you different types of symbols and how to interpret
them.
Discovering How Symbols 
Can Come Alive
Everything is a symbol, really, and conveys under-
lying meaning. What do your clothes, car, furnishings,
cologne, business card, phone message, hairstyle,

and body say about who you are? The symbols that
appear in your dreams are just as indicative of you as
those in daily life. Do you dream of outer space or
eating French pastries? Are your dreams populated
with cats, babies, mobsters, angels, or large insects
with shiny eyes? Dreaming about a hummingbird
instead of a bald eagle reveals as much about
your inner self as your real-life choice of a pickup
truck over a sports car. There’s a good reason 
those symbols appear in your daytime and night-
time reality when they do; they represent character-
istics or aspects of spirit you want to activate in
yourself. 
To truly understand what a symbol represents, you
must feel into or merge into the symbol, pretend to
be the thing, and speak from its point of view about
what it knows. This way, you enter the direct experi-
ence of what it is to be a daisy, a polar bear, a set of
lost keys, or a school bus. And the symbol comes
alive. Once you become the symbol, it’s easier to
see how the image is a part of you and your life
process.
Try the following writing exercise to practice merging
with, becoming, and speaking as a symbol:
1. Pick an object from your house: Choose any-
thing, such as a vase, an easy chair, the sheets
on your bed, a broom, the welcome mat, a
candle, a statue. 
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
56

2. In your imagination, step into the object:
Line your energy up with it, feel its life, what
it knows, and where it comes from; tell its
story, and why it’s in your life right now; write
directly from your intuition in first person/
present tense, allowing anything to come.
Familiarizing Yourself with
Kinds of Meanings
Every symbol has an archetypal definition, a meaning
that describes universal themes common to all people
in all cultures. Additionally, it can have a personal
definition, and mean something unique to you alone.
Kayaking in a fast river might mean a fluid emotional
process archetypically, but because you flipped
over in a boat and almost drowned, to you it means,
“Danger!”
Notice archetypal meanings
Archetypal meanings of symbols often have sweeping
themes that describe spiritual truths and processes,
like the hero’s journey into the underworld to face
and conquer fear; the nurturing relationship between
divine mother and divine child; or death, rebirth,
and transformation into a brilliant new spiritual form.
You can find great archetypal insights about symbols
by exploring the classic myths and legends of the
world.
Chapter 4: Unlocking the Secrets in Symbols 57

The following exercise will help you identify arche-
typal meanings:
1. Make a list of ten dream images, either single
items or a snapshot of a scene.
For example: Going to the doctor, a bruised
apple, swimming across a lake, a black-and-
white dog.
2. For each one, imagine a spiritual teacher or
guide is giving you insight about what it
means as a soul lesson or spiritual process. 
For example: Going to the doctor – you’re
working with spiritual guides to change the
way you run energy through your system;
bruised apple – you’re healing an emotional
wound that caused you to not develop or
offer your talents to the world; swimming
across a lake – you’re beginning a sustained
spiritual quest; black-and-white dog –
you’re examining ideas about good and evil,
right and wrong, especially as connected to
friendship.
Notice personal meanings
The following exercises give you a variety of ways to
become more familiar with personal symbols.
Here are several methods for imagining personal
symbols:
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
58

 Make a list of your positive character traits, the
things you like about yourself. Next to the words,
list images that represent those characteristics. 
 For example, for free you might list horse, eagle,
wind; for industrious you might list ant, bee,
beaver, hammer.
 Pick the traits about yourself you’d like to repre-
sent to the world. What do you want others to
notice about you? Imagine, describe, or draw a
logo for yourself.
 Imagine, describe, or draw a meditation symbol
that represents your essence.
Symbolizing someone else can help you discover per-
sonal meanings as well. Try these methods:
 Make a list of ten people you’ve seen in the
media. Write their first and last names in your
diary. Then ask your imagination: If these people
had different names that conveyed their essences
or important qualities of their personalities, what
would they be? Don’t be logical. Take the first
impressions you get. List the pseudonyms next
to their present names.
 Pick three people you know. For each one, ask: If
this person were a tree or an animal, what would
he or she be? What kind of music would he be?
What kind of car would she be? What is this
person’s secret fantasy? What does his bedroom
look like? If this person were a geometric symbol
what would she be?
Chapter 4: Unlocking the Secrets in Symbols 59

Experiment with titling your dreams as a way to
develop personal meanings from symbols:
1. Make a list of ten past dreams, or recent
situations in your waking life that seem like
dreams.
2. Use your imagination. Let the most colorful
images and whimsical actions in each dream
connect and form a poetic title that captures
the spirit of the dream and makes it instantly
meaningful to you. 
For example: Sauna jailbreak, colorful lost
dogs, vegetable windfall, gummy and tooth-
less, healer mom. 
Cracking Symbols Open
There are several ways to unlock the meanings in 
symbols. In the sections that follow, I describe a few
methods and give you a chance to practice them.
Find archetypal meanings vertically
Symbols exist between the reality of the body and
the reality of spirit. They represent messages from
the soul to your mind and personality, and messages
from your body and emotions to the mind and soul.
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
60

The meaning behind every symbol eventually helps
you determine the actions that are most purposeful
for you. 
You can find the archetypal meanings of a symbol by
moving your awareness vertically — “up” into the
symbol’s highest essence, or “down” into the symbol’s
deepest core. You can distill a universal meaning by
asking questions like, What’s underneath this mean-
ing? What came before that idea? or What is the high-
est spiritual experience this symbol provides? Try the
following exercise to interpret a symbol vertically:
1. Pick a dream fragment or a piece of a longer
dream. Focus on the symbol that seems most
important and describe it in a short phrase.
For example: (Blue Pegasus) is a symbol for
the image I see of (a flying blue horse).
2. Ask yourself: If I could feel what it’s like to
be blue, without fear or reservation, what
sensations and emotions would I experience?
If I could feel what it’s like to be a flying
horse, what sensations and emotions would I
experience? Write about the experiences, in
first person/present tense, using as many sen-
sory and emotional words as possible. Try to
include vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell.
3. Ask yourself: If I were a flying blue horse,
aware of all its sensations and emotions,
what would I naturally know about myself,
the world, and life? What insights would I
have? Write about your answers.
Chapter 4: Unlocking the Secrets in Symbols 61

4. Next, ask: If I had all the sensations, emo-
tions, and knowing of a flying blue horse,
what lesson would I be teaching myself?
What purpose would I be fulfilling? Write about
your answers.
Find personal meanings horizontally
You can find the personal meanings of a symbol by
expanding your awareness horizontally or sideways
across the world. You can uncover associated ideas
that are similar to the symbol, that have a meaning
specific to you, by asking questions like, What does
this symbol remind me of? What memories do I con-
nect with this image? Traveling the horizontal path
to a symbol’s meaning is a totally subjective journey;
symbols hold different meanings depending on how
much love and fear are connected with the viewpoint.
To discover the personal meanings you have with a
symbol, you must trust your subconscious mind. 
The method of free association can help flush up a
symbol’s related meanings from your subconscious.
With this horizontal method, you describe the
thoughts, impressions, and feelings you receive
when you think of the symbol, no matter how silly. 
When looking for associations, look also to your opin-
ions and judgments. Your most forthright, candid, and
judgmental ideas are often most revealing. Logical
assumptions about what symbols stand for are often
boring, and only skim the surface. Look for emotional
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
62

reality, or that special intuitive “hit” that makes you
pause a moment. Omit the enticing details that wander
tangentially away from the point or you’ll get bogged
down. The association you find may be an episode from
your life. Summarize the story in your diary, then look
for a key word that stands out. This word is often tied
to the meaning of the original symbol.
The flower petal technique helps you find connections
and personal meanings without going off on a tangent
of increasingly irrelevant associations:
1. Close your eyes and imagine a large open
flower with many petals. In the center of the
flower, place a symbol you’d like to decode;
let’s use a snake. Focus on the image and be
willing to receive any ideas. 
2 Move your awareness out to the first petal.
Imagine another image, idea, personal
memory, or word on that petal, something
that’s related to snake. The first thing might
be poisonous. Note the idea in your dream
diary.
3. Return to the center and connect with the
snake symbol again. Go to the second petal
and see what idea or image is there. Maybe
this time it’s sexuality. Note the idea in your
dream diary.
4. Return to the center and feel the symbol. Go
to the third petal. This time you get ancient
wisdom. Continue going back to the center,
Chapter 4: Unlocking the Secrets in Symbols 63

then out to a petal, until you’ve exhausted the
meaningful associations. Don’t jump from petal
to petal or you might start associating the
associations with each other. Soon you should
have an intriguing list: poisonous, sexuality,
ancient wisdom, dangerous, slippery, sensual,
“snake in the grass,” dragon, cold-blooded,
sacred, teeth, sheds skin, constrictor, transfor-
mation, kundalini.
5. Review your collection of words, feelings,
memories, and concepts. As you write, ask
yourself: How are these ideas like me or my
life right now? How do these ideas relate to
each other and fit together to describe a situa-
tion in my life?
Often a symbol’s personal meaning pertains to a trau-
matic or confusing event in your past. You can find
associations to memories and thematically interre-
lated experiences by following these steps:
1. Pick an image from a recent dream and let it
appear in your imagination.
2. Ask: What does this image remind me of
that is present in my life now? Let yourself
receive one or more associations. Write them
in your diary.
3. Ask: What earlier similar experience is tied
to these present ones through an association
in my subconscious mind? Let yourself
receive one or more associations. Write them
in your diary.
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
64

4. Ask: What earlier similar experience is tied 
to this one through an association in my sub-
conscious mind? Keep asking until no more
come.
5. Examine the string of connected experi-
ences to find common themes leading into
the present. What core emotions are at the
heart of the experiences? 
Chapter 4: Unlocking the Secrets in Symbols 65
Dream dictionaries of the past
Dream interpretation dictionaries figure prominently in the literature
of history. Ancient Egyptians, Mesopotamians, and Greeks used
them, as well as Muhammadan scholars. The Beatty papyrus, writ-
ten around 1350 BC and discovered at Thebes, is the oldest dream
dictionary existing today. It lists the interpretations of many dream
images, as well as incantations and rituals to prevent nightmares.
Special dream-interpreting priests were called “Masters of the
Secret Things” or “Learned Ones of the Magic Library.” 
After the printing press made books more widely available to the
public in the mid-1600s, a dream dictionary called Oneirocritica (The
Interpretation of Dreams) by Artemidorus became one of the first best-
sellers, comparable only to the Bible in popularity. On the other hand,
Sigmund Freud’s best work, The Interpretation of Dreams, now read
by many as a foundation for dreamwork, when published in 1900 sold
only 451 copies in two years. 
Older dream dictionaries are notorious for listing obscure meanings
of symbols that may have made great sense in the more distant past,
but don’t quite compute today.

Unlock a group of symbols 
and find the message 
Sometimes it helps to pretend you’re describing the
symbols to a friendly ET-type extraterrestrial who’s
trying to understand what he’s observing on earth.
For example, a woman dreamed: I’m in Europe and
have made a huge amount of money, in cash, that I
want to bring back into the United States, but I don’t
want to declare it at customs. I don’t want it to show
up on the X-ray machine. I’m paranoid and frustrated
that I have so much money but may not be able to 
use it. 
This woman identified three key symbols: a large
amount of cash, a foreign country that is the origin of
the money, and customs and its X-ray machine. The
following list shows you how to unload these symbols
to their basest meanings.
 What is a large amount of money? Money is a
reward. Money brings opportunity, security, and
power. Money is strength and energy. A large
amount of money means I can have and do a lot.
A large amount of money means I have done
something well or been very good.
 What is a foreign country? A foreign country is a
place I don’t normally live. It’s a place where I’m
not limited by what everyone thinks of me. A for-
eign country is exciting and offers unusual oppor-
tunities and adventure.
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
66

 What is customs? What is an X-ray machine?
Customs is a guard dog. Customs is the suspi-
cious consciousness at the outside edge of the
place I live in. Customs will take things away
from me if I have too much. An X-ray machine
sees through the outside covering of things to
reveal what’s underneath.
After this woman could sense the underlying mean-
ings of the individual symbols, she tried merging into
them to find out how they might be a part of her cur-
rent life process. We’ll delve into interpreting dreams
in more depth in Chapters 5 and 6, but for now, see if
you can feel how this woman put the individual sym-
bols together to reveal an issue in her innermost self
that she hadn’t been aware of previously.
This woman sensed that the foreign country was a
new kind of self-expression that was unfamiliar but
exciting, a way of having permission to be more of her-
self and be more successful. The large amount of
money felt like a validation of her natural talent and
the rewards that could soon be coming to her. Her
paranoia about customs felt like an old fear she’d had
that everything good would be taken away from her or
she’d be criticized if she showed herself fully to the
world. So when this woman put all the symbols
together, she realized her soul was sending her a mes-
sage: Move past old limitations, show up for who you
really are, be creative in a totally new way, and let
your wealth of talent be known.

Chapter 5
Finding Dream Meanings
T
his chapter gives you basic principles and tech-
niques for drilling down to find your dreams’ core
insights. Be sure to check Chapters 4 and 6 for more
techniques for exploring dream messages.
Dream Formats
Dreams come in many shapes and sizes, some vague,
some detailed, some frightening, some inspiring. They
all contain encoded messages aimed at improving
your life. Here are some tips for working with dream
formats you might encounter:
 Vague impression: Try meditating and receiving
any subtle feelings about the impression. Note
related thoughts, moods, and sensations in your
body. Follow a sensation to a feeling, to a
memory or association, to an insight.
 Single symbol or dream fragment: Try merging
into the single image and speak as the symbol, or
dialogue with it.
 Story: Try breaking the story into scenes, and
look for the main lesson or message in each piece
by asking trigger questions about the elements

and analyzing the symbols. Then put it all back
together and see how the whole thing is about
your current growth process. Look for insights
about where the process wants to go.
 Recurring, incomplete: With recurring dreams,
especially scary ones, there is a subconscious
block that needs to be faced. When a dream is
interrupted or feels incomplete, try redreaming it
in a meditation and take it to a new conclusion.
 Sequential: When a dream is part of a series
where information is revealed over time, treat
the separate dreams as scenes in a longer story
dream.
 Stream of consciousness: When the dream con-
tains a long string of images, look for the relation-
ships between the symbols to find a process that
relates to your personal growth.
Getting Started: Some
Things to Look For 
In interpreting a dream, remember that you are first
looking for insight about an issue or theme the inner-
most you is concerned about, working on improving,
learning, or creating. You’re looking for this wisdom so
you can grow and become more of your truest, highest
self. In finding that key message, you are likely to
receive modifying details that will help you make the
necessary changes and fine tune your understanding
of the lessons at hand. In addition, you may find
insights about other people or society at large, and
these will always pertain to your own life, too.

Remember that in dreams, time is malleable, so you
may receive information about the past and future as
though it is in the present. 
In the following sections, I give you a loose framework
for looking at key components of dreams that can help
you see through the surface to what’s happening
underneath. Use any or all of them — they are tools
for exploration.
Look for fear and love
Dreams deliver messages from your subconscious and
your superconscious mind. Looking for fear or love in
the dream can give you a clue about your process: Are
you trying to clear a blockage or move forward from
your soul’s clarity?
 Subconscious dream content, related to the past
and fear, arises so you can clear the way for
more soul expression. Personal symbology is
often connected to these dreams. By looking at
contracted fear responses, both in the dream and
after, you can discover your subconscious blocks.
One woman’s dream, which forewarns of the
emergence of breast cancer, shows subconscious
content: A snake has gotten inside my body and
now it’s in my chest and is laying eggs all over.
I can’t get it out!
 Superconscious dream content brings guidance
from your soul, access to love and wisdom, or
understanding of a process shared by all
people. Typically, negative emotion is not pres-
ent. These dreams feel expansive, loving, open,
neutral, and informational. Archetypal symbology
Chapter 5: Finding Dream Meanings 71

is usually related to these dreams. In one man’s
dream, his soul self is reassuring him that he’s
entitled to abundance and nourishment: I’m
riding in a car. As I round a curve, a passing truck
swerves and vegetables fall onto the road. I stop
and pick them up. I’m excitedly stuffing them into
my pack — lettuce, carrots, celery, and tomatoes.
Dreams deliver messages from your subconscious and
your superconscious mind. Looking for fear or love in
the dream can give you a clue about your process: Are
you trying to clear a blockage or move forward from
your soul’s clarity?
One woman dreamed: I’m looking over a pilot’s shoul-
der as he guides a commercial jet in for a landing. I’m
frightened yet exhilarated when he flies between sky-
scrapers in a big city, then finally lands safely in a lake.
She determined that she was descending from the
mental-spiritual zone into the emotional zone. And
when she looked at how the dream fit all the cate-
gories, she realized:
 As a physical zone dream: She needs to develop
new skills for navigating more masterfully in her
life. 
 As an emotional zone dream: She needs to take
risks to move forward in life, and she’s anxious
about crashing emotionally if she doesn’t stay
centered.
 As a mental-spiritual zone dream: She is bring-
ing higher knowledge carefully down past various
fixed mental constructs, so it can be applied in
her emotional life. She feels she has help from
guides and teachers.
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
72

In the end, the woman decided her dream was prima-
rily based in the mental-spiritual zone. She had been
depressed and needed to refine the quality of her emo-
tions by opening to greater spiritual understanding.
Dreams can deliver messages or instructions verbally
or in written form, via a disembodied voice or a few
printed words. Mental-spiritual zone dreams originate
in realms that are abstract, pattern-oriented, and often
devoid of symbols or scenes from daily life.
Look into the symbols
List the main symbols in your dream; then look for the
archetypal and personal meanings, as I explained in
Chapter 4. Remember, archetypal meanings of sym-
bols take you straight to the core and give insight
about universal themes, while personal meanings add
insight that has particular relevance to you. Once you
understand how each symbol is about a part of you,
you can put them together to discover something
about your personal growth process.
Look for new information
Dreams routinely bring information that can help you
in daily life. One woman dreamed that a friend insisted
she drink hibiscus tea, so she actually bought and
brewed some and found she liked it. Another woman
dreamed of a ray of light shining through the window
onto the left side of her abdomen; within weeks, she
discovered she had a cyst on her left ovary. 
Chapter 5: Finding Dream Meanings 73

Look at the change points
You can find interesting insights when you examine
how your dreams start, shift, and stop. The change
points carry clues about your inner dynamics. Ask
yourself: 
 At what point do I enter the dream action? This
can tell you something about your main concerns.
 What choices do I make in the dream? This can
show where you are passive or aggressive, what
you’re afraid might happen, or how you uncon-
sciously react to situations.
 What causes one scene to shift to another? You
may discover the power you’ve given to others to
control your life, or the unconscious links between
beliefs you hold.
 What is happening when the dream ends? This
can point out where you typically withdraw from
situations or become unconscious, or how you want
a situation to turn out.
Asking Questions That 
Trigger Insights
Sometimes, you just need to be conscious of details
you’d normally gloss over, for meanings to become
evident. Start by asking questions about the following
main elements:
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
74

 What are the key elements?
• How would you describe the dream struc-
ture? Did the dream have a beginning,
middle, and end? Was it just a fragment?
Was it a stream of consciousness, a string
of images or episodes that are related to
each other in some odd way? This gives
you hints about what decoding techniques
to use.
• What were the main scenes and settings in
the dream? Were you inside or outside?
Was it urban, rural, or unearthly? How many
scenes were there? To notice details, ask
yourself how this setting is different from
others like it you’ve seen before. This helps
you understand your process — internal,
external, worldly, spiritual, stages of growth.
• Was there a sense of time or direction?
Was it day or night? Were you in the past or
the future? Were you facing one of the four
directions? This gives insight about informa-
tion being unconscious, conscious, frozen,
or projected, and shows attitudes you’re
coming from and needing to develop.
• How was the dream lit? Were the scenes
full of sunlight, in color, or lit by a spotlight?
Was it foggy or dark, in sepia, or black-and-
white? Were you aware of specific colors?
This indicates what you’re paying attention
to, what’s real to you, and the overtones
you associate with things.
Chapter 5: Finding Dream Meanings 75

• What was your viewpoint? Were you a par-
ticipant or playing the role of another
person? Were you an observer or commen-
tator? Were you above the action, at eye
level, or below? This gives insight about
how engaged you are in life and how you
use authority.
• What characters were present? Were you
alone or with other people, animals, or spir-
itual beings? Were there peripheral charac-
ters who never showed up but had an
impact on the dream? This tells what
aspects of yourself you’re developing;
shows how you cooperate, give, and
receive; and what sort of help you need.
• What were the primary images, objects,
symbols, or patterns? Was the dream filled
with the objects and imagery of normal life?
Or was it more otherworldly, abstract, or
geometric? Here you can dive directly into
symbol decoding.
• Did numbers occur in the dream? Did you
see three wasps, seven puppies, numerals
on a house, or lottery ticket numbers? Did
someone tell you his or her phone number
or the date or time? More symbol decoding.
 What are the motivations?
• What actions were taken, and by whom?
As each action was taken, what goal was
pursued? This shows what you’re doing in
your life and the mistakes you’re making or
avoiding.
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
76

• What choices or decisions were made, and
by whom? Action proceeds from choices
and intentions. What motivated each action
in the dream? This shows your soul desires,
subconscious fears, and interfering mental
structures.
• What outcomes were reached? Did actions
lead to results? Were you satisfied with the
outcomes? Did you resist them or not notice
them? This shows what you want to accom-
plish or think you should accomplish.
• At what speed was the action occurring?
High speed is a different kind of awareness
than slow motion. This shows how you’re
processing your experience. Slow motion
indicates deep understanding physically and
emotionally, while lightspeed pertains to
direct higher mental-spiritual knowing.
• What statements were made? Orders
given? Questions asked? By whom? Pay
attention to standout declarative state-
ments and questions. Watch for words or
phrases you see in print. This indicates
key ideas or messages to explore, accept,
or dissolve.
• What was left incomplete? Were certain
actions ineffectual or interrupted? What
interrupted the flow? At what point did the
action stop? This reveals places you avoid
experiencing something.
• What impressions did you have about the
dream while dreaming? It’s common to
comment about a dream to yourself while
Chapter 5: Finding Dream Meanings 77

you’re dreaming. For instance, “This is a
continuation of that other dream I had six
months ago.” You may have forgotten the
previous dream in waking life, but your
dream self keeps track. These impressions
reveal ongoing deep processes your soul is
facilitating.
 What are the feelings?
• What feelings did you or other characters
have? Was there an underlying mood run-
ning through the dream? Did you experi-
ence mild or intense emotion? When
exactly? You may want to amplify and exag-
gerate a mild feeling so you can see what
it’s really about. This helps you see where
your fear and pain lie and how you react or
protect yourself.
• What senses were you using to perceive?
Were you primarily aware through vision?
Or did you feel someone touching you,
taste food, hear music, or smell flowers?
This shows preferred modes of knowing and
how deep in your body you’re processing
something.
 How is each part about you?
• What do you have in common with each
symbol and character? Assume there is an
aspect of your own emotional makeup,
belief system, and behavior that the symbol
or character embodies. 
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
78

• How do the emotions, decisions, and
actions parallel something in your own life?
There are always parallels between the
dream and your waking life, perhaps in a
different area, about a different subject, or
involving different people.
Putting It Together: A Sample
Interpretation
While writing one of my books, I dreamed: I’m walking
at night on a city street, slick with rain, in a bad area.
I’m following sheets of paper being spit out one by one
from a copy machine that act like stepping stones or a
bread crumb trail. They keep appearing and I have to
pick them up. They’re leading me into a dangerous area
with many derelicts. Because I’m concentrating on the
“paper trail,” the derelicts aren’t bothering me, but I
must not lose focus or look directly at them. Ahead is a
hole in a wall at the end of an alley lined with bums;
through it is a muddy swampy hellhole area where the
bad men come from. I decide I’m not going farther, and
I wake up.
Here’s what I made of it, picking the previously listed
interpretation tips that stood out to me the most: 
 Subconcious or superconscious: I’m looking at a
subconscious process because there is darkness
and anxiety throughout the dream. 
 Dream zones: The dream fits all the zones. As a
physical zone dream, it relates to my writing, and
how I must keep on, one page at a time, and not
Chapter 5: Finding Dream Meanings 79

get ahead of myself. As an emotional zone dream,
I see my writing is taking me into deep emotions,
fears, and primal experiences that I hadn’t
expected. As a mental-spiritual dream, it’s show-
ing me that the book’s content (and my life itself)
will flow and I’ll receive the next piece (experi-
ence) just as I need it, and that by staying
focused in the moment and on the creative
process, I remain stable and safe from distortions
or biases caused by fear. 
 Dream categories: Skill development, psychologi-
cal processing, creativity.
 Dream symbols: Several images stand out strongly:
A city at night, bad part of town: What is a
city at night? It’s the dark side of a collec-
tive consciousness, a part of the mind filled
with desperation. Archetypally, the symbol
focuses on collective subconscious fears of
being attacked, or perhaps fear of the
unknown. As a personal symbol, I may be
dredging up memories and associations I
have from living in New York City as a young
woman in a period of my life fraught with
difficulty and rejection. 
Rain and a muddy-swampy hole: What is
rain, mud, a hole into a swamp? It’s a flood
of emotion that I can get stuck in and con-
fused by. Archetypally, the symbols focus
on emotional paralysis and overwhelm,
going into the deepest part of our fear. As
personal symbols, they remind me of a
vague fear I have of losing direction and
freedom through emotional negativity or
victimization.
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
80

Derelicts: What is a derelict? It’s a person
who’s out of touch with the soul, who feels
victimized by life. Archetypally, the hope-
less, downtrodden, needy, possibly violent
men relate to a negative, suppressed side
of our masculine, manifesting energy.
Personally, the symbol reminds me of an
anxiety I have about poverty swallowing me
up. How are the derelicts me? They are the
starved parts of my own creative-productive
self that are overworked, cut off, unappreci-
ated, and unrecognized. They might turn on
me, suck me dry, and destroy me and my
book if I don’t replenish them with play,
respect, and warmth. 
Copy machine: What is a copy machine? It’s
a part of my awareness that translates mate-
rial from other dimensions to my mind and
onto the page. Archetypally, it represents the
production process. Personally, the symbol
reassures me that I have help in my creative
endeavor.
Manuscript pages: What are pages? They
are formed ideas and manifested communi-
cation. Archetypally, the symbol focuses on
the finished product of a writing process.
Personally, the pages feel like precious
jewels and a core part of me.
 The actions, choices, and lessons: I follow the
pages, pay attention, listen to my intuition to stay
focused and steady. I learn that if I even look at
the derelicts, I’ll draw their attention and be in
danger: a basic principle of how to use the mind?
Don’t lower my personal vibration? I see I don’t
Chapter 5: Finding Dream Meanings 81

need to force the creative process; I am receiving
material at a speed I can handle, and I only need
to pick up the pages one by one. I learn I’m being
guided into deep territory, and the process will
keep me safe no matter where I go. Why do I
decide NOT to go through the hole into the
swamp? Honest response: I don’t need to. It might
shift me so much it would stop the flow of my cre-
ative process; it’s not what I’m doing in my life
right now.
 Conclusions: To write the best book, I need to
trust the natural flow of creativity and stay in the
moment. As my growth process leads me deeper
into my core, I will face fears, but I don’t need to
resist them or they’ll get stronger. I must work
more with feminine energy and nurture my worker
bee self. I can explore beyond my known rational
world into the swampy origin place when the pos-
sible repercussions won’t interfere with a worldly
commitment.
Trying Your Hand
Here are a collection of exercises and techniques you
can use to work with various types of dreams.
Delve into body, emotion, 
mind, and soul
Use the following three exercises to listen to your
body, emotions, mind, and soul.
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
82

Find body messages by following these steps:
1. Pick a few dreams and write about them as
though they are messages to you from your
body. 
2. Ask how the dream might relate to your
body’s energy level circulation, assimilation,
or elimination systems. Is there a message
about your health? Is there an action you
should take?
You can sleuth for subconscious emotional blocks by
doing the following:
1. Pick a few dreams and see if there are any
images that might have been triggered by
fears or blocks in your subconscious mind.
2. Make a list of the images, emotions, and
actions you took in the dreams. Write about
what the underlying themes are and how these
emotions are connected to events in your daily
life. Also write about how the themes you dis-
cover might be connected with each other.
Find hidden spiritual guidance with these two simple
methods:
1. Pick a few dreams and look for teachings
about improving the way you use your mind
and heart. Could a spiritual guide or angel have
been working with you to help you become
aware of a new principle of consciousness? 
2. Write about what your dreams might mean.
Did they originate from the collective con-
sciousness and were they pertinent socially?
Chapter 5: Finding Dream Meanings 83

Work with dream fragments
The following two exercises can help you interpret
dream fragments.
Find insights by conversing with a dream fragment
using the following procedure:
 Pick a dream fragment and focus on the image or
experience. Be your conscious mind asking ques-
tions, then be the image/fragment and respond.
Record the questions and answers in your diary. 
 Ask the fragment: Who/what are you? What’s
your special gift? What do you do? What’s your
function or role in my life?
 Ask the fragment: Why are you appearing in my
dream? What emotions do you want to trigger in
me? What message do you have for me? What do
you need, or want, me to do?
 Ask the fragment: Are you the representation of
something else, like a kind of energy or belief
system? If I integrate the quality you represent,
how might I change? 
By tracking your feelings about a dream fragment to a
best or worst possible scenario, you can find interest-
ing and helpful insights:
1. Ask yourself: What feelings or sensations do I
have concerning this image? What else comes
to mind as I experience the image?
2. If you reach a fear-based idea, ask: What
would happen if the situation I’m trying to
Part I: Decode Your Dreams 
84

avoid occurred? If you reach a positive insight,
ask: What would happen if the good situation
occurred? When you get the answer, ask: And
then what would happen? Continue to ask:
And then what?, until you arrive at a final out-
come. Ask: If this worst or best possible sce-
nario happened, what might I learn?
Make sense of recurring
and sequential dreams
Recurring dreams and nightmares typically end mid-
stream without a satisfactory resolution. Sequential
dreams seem to be connected in a progression over
time. Stream-of-consciousness dreams contain strings
of images that form a process. The following exercises
will help you work more effectively with these dream
categories.
Complete an incomplete or recurring dream by follow-
ing these simple steps:
1. Pick a recurring or incomplete dream.
Review it in your imagination from the begin-
ning to the point where it abruptly ends. Write
about what emotion, feeling, or quandary
you’re stuck with.
2. In a meditation, continue the dream as
though it is a movie you haven’t finished
watching. Don’t will it in a certain direction,
but let it evolve naturally in your mind, and
keep going until you feel the Aha! Then write
about what lesson you’re learning.
Chapter 5: Finding Dream Meanings 85

Try this exercise to find wisdom in a dream sequence
or stream-of-consciousness flow:
1. Look for a series of dreams where one picks
up where another leaves off (sequential), or
dreams that contain a long string of oddly
connected images. Make a list of these dreams
or symbol-strings.
2. For a series of sequential dreams write about
the gist of each dream. Can you sense a pro-
gression from one to the next? Is your soul
revealing different aspects of an issue to you?
Are you showing yourself the next appropriate
action in your process? For a stream-of-
consciousness dream, look for and write about
how the symbols’ meanings connect logically
to one another in a progression. What process
is being described?
3. Write about how the dreams parallel your
waking reality and the themes or life lessons
you’ve been working on.
Abraham Lincoln, a few days before his assassination,
dreamed he heard sobbing and saw his own dead
body lying in state in the White House. Just months
before the start of World War I, Carl Jung dreamed
Europe was engulfed in a great flood in which thou-
sands drowned, and the water turned to blood.

Part II
Dictionary
of Symbols

In this part . . .
P
art II gives guidelines on how to use a dream
dictionary, and presents a unique way to
understand dream symbols. You’ll find each word
interpreted on three levels, as it might pertain to
the physical world, the emotional world, and the
mental-spiritual worlds.

Dictionary
A
above/ascend: Physical: If an object or person is above
you, you are giving your power or energy away. If you
are above, you feel you have greater influence and
power. Emotional: You admire or resent someone
above you, or feel in control or superior when you are
above them. Mental-Spiritual: If something is above
you, you need more perspective and und erstanding
concerning that idea. It might be an important missing
piece of your life purpose. If you are above, you have
keen insights about the issue below. Ascending signi-
fies a desire for the big picture, that your attention is
on future goals, or your awareness is moving into
higher states of consciousness.
accident: Accident dreams aren’t necessarily some-
thing you can sense before they happen. Physical: If
the dream has intuitive “weight” (totally subjective to
you), it could indicate a potential problem. You are
probably sensing a mistake in the works: an energy
flow or process needing revision before you go too far
and get in trouble. Slow down and evaluate things.
Emotional: You are too emotional, or attached, or a sit-
uation is about to go out of control, and you’re feeling
anxious about what could happen. Mental-Spiritual:
You need to pay closer attention to something. You
lack key knowledge, or are out of alignment with your
purpose. Consider your deepest motives and wisdom.

acorn: Physical: You are looking at your potential,
what you can accomplish, how much talent and
endurance you have, and how ready you are to act.
You are looking at the idea of how much value can be
concentrated in a small act, or how the first step of a
process influences the outcome. Emotional: You are
feeling motives and inner strength, reassuring yourself
that you can do what you intend. If there is a stash of
acorns, you are hoarding what you consider valuable,
or need to conserve resources. Mental-Spiritual: You
are touching into your core self, into your life’s destiny
or blueprint, sensing your purpose and what you are
built to do. 
actor/actress/acting: Physical: You are looking at your
personality, how you live your life, and present your-
self to the public. If you are acting, you’re examining
the roles and qualities you portray to your “audience”
in daily life. Look for tips about improving your per-
formance. Emotional: If you’re uncomfortable acting,
you may feel superficial or forced to please others.
If you’ve forgotten your lines, you may feel anxiety
about a real-life situation. A phenomenal performance
means you are showing yourself how to be uninhibited
and unselfconscious. Mental-Spiritual: You’re ready to
expand your self-expression, experience more joy, and
allow the energy of others, your audience, to help you
be your most dynamic self. You are exploring the idea
that you can understand anyone by walking in their
shoes. 
adversary/enemy: Physical: You are facing an aspect
of your life or body that you physically fear, a situation
you can’t control, an illness, or a bad habit like an
addiction. Emotional: You’re dealing with a repressed
part of yourself or may feel threatened by someone or
acorn — adversary/enemy 
90

a situation. Whether you fight or flee, and how you feel
about the action you take, tells you what you need to
do. Mental-Spiritual: You’re integrating an important
part of yourself that needs to be loved and understood.
What seems negative holds a hidden gift or talent.
air: Physical: You need to improve your vitality with
more oxygen, by breathing deeply, or improving your
circulation. Emotional: Floating on air indicates a need
for contentment, while not having enough air means
you feel lack of support for your self-expression.
Mental-Spiritual: Traveling through the air denotes
movement through streams of thought and bodies
of knowledge, from the lower realm of individual
thought, to the higher, shared collective conscious-
ness where there is freedom from limiting beliefs.
Encountering anything in the air represents fixed
beliefs based on fear, interferences to clear thought,
or specific ideas you should pay attention to.
airplane/airport: Airplanes represent your focus
within the mental and spiritual realms. An airport rep-
resents a departure point for a transition in your life.
Physical: A small plane means you’re focusing on a
localized reality. Taking off shows a new venture is
ready to occur. If a plane can’t get off the ground, the
venture may be stuck or held back. Landing signifies
bringing inspiration, ideas, or energies back to incor-
porate into your life or body. Missing a plane means
you’re missing an opportunity. Emotional: A hang
glider represents an experience of personal joy and
inspiration. The way you feel while riding in or piloting
an aircraft shows how you deal with the unknown.
Having to fly a plane when you don’t know how
indicates you’re reaching for heights you haven’t
attained before and are anxious. Mental-Spiritual:
adversary/enemy — airplane/airport 91

You’re focusing on your freedom and power to rise
above challenges and obtain higher perspective. A
plane crash signals the end of your involvement with
a series of beliefs. A jet represents concepts you hold
in common with many other people. A rocket indicates
you’re moving rapidly toward spiritual knowledge. A
UFO symbolizes a collective consciousness catalyzed
by many souls of similar developmental awareness.
alarm/bell: Physical: If you hear an alarm you are
warning yourself to pay attention to your health,
habits, inner tensions and pain, or how you act in the
world. Emotional: You are bringing an alarming situa-
tion to light. Someone is not who they seem to be or
something that seems safe might not be. Mental-
Spiritual: You are telling yourself to wake up, be aware
of inner truth, a message of guidance, and to be more
alert to a new period of heightened creativity.
aliens: Physical: You are focusing on how your body
could function more elegantly, or on part of your
anatomy as represented in the exaggerated features of
the alien. Big eyes might mean you’re trying to see
something more thoroughly and deeply. Emotional:
You’re focusing on your experience of being an alien,
feeling like a stranger in your social setting; there are
aspects of yourself you’ve defined as foreign that need
to be familiarized. You need to experience a situation
freshly, as if you’re from another planet. Mental-
Spiritual: You are focused on your own higher aware-
ness, possibly with a technological orientation or
multidimensional wisdom. Listen for the message or
teachings.
alley: Physical: You are transitioning to a new phase of
life, taking a nontraditional route, changing plans as
airplane/airport — alley 
92

you go, possibly hiding from public view. An alley is a
shortcut or escape route on your path through life.
Emotional: Alleys — behind houses, narrow, and often
containing refuse — represent the subconscious mind
and experiences that are slightly negative or danger-
ous. You feel anxiety about being attacked or heading
into a dead-end. Mental-Spiritual: Something is “right
up your alley,” or perfect for you. You are looking
behind the scenes of the normal view, seeing what’s
revealed in the inner lives of others.
alligator: (see crocodile)
ambulance/paramedics: Physical: You are on the
verge of a physical problem, or in a situation that
needs expert helpers. Emotional: You are having an
emotional crisis and urgently need help or want to
help someone else. If an ambulance is taking you to
the hospital because of a heart attack, for example,

may feel trapped by circumstances, as though you are
a victim with no choices. You may feel you’re being
punished. Don’t give your power away to others.
Mental-Spiritual: You’ve forgotten about free will, that
it is okay to say “no.” You are remembering that your
soul will restrict you when you need to face important
issues.
car: Physical: You’re focusing on your daily life and life
direction or on your body and personality. Mechanical
problems indicate blocks in your body or forward
movement. Being stuck or backing up means you feel
this way about your progress. The condition of the
vehicle gives an idea of your health condition.
Emotional: Driving indicates you’re in control. Riding
in the passenger seat or back seat means you are
deferring to another’s influence or are feeling out of
control. Mental-Spiritual: How you drive shows your
ability to navigate through life, your ambition, confi-
dence, and ability to make decisions. Your car gives
clues to your identity. A stolen car is a loss of identity.
Being hit by a car means you are in conflict with
another person or way of doing things.
cards: Physical: Playing cards indicates you are using,
or need to use, luck and the skills of strategy and
timing in a current project or phase of your life. The
number and suit of the cards provide clues to the
meaning. Emotional: You feel you are gambling in
some way, or that success is a matter of luck. Mental-
Spiritual: Clubs mean taking action and getting down
to business. Spades mean sadness, disappointment, or
the presence of an obstacle. Hearts symbolize love,
positive emotion, and relationships. Diamonds relate
to your concepts of material and inner abundance and
resources.
captivity — cards 113

castle: Physical: You are hoping for great success, or
preparing to fortify yourself for an endeavor you see
as difficult but rewarding. Emotional: You need to pro-
tect yourself from attacks, even from your own inter-
nal critic. Castles represent a warring, defensive
nature. If the drawbridge is down, you’re receptive,
ready to face the forces of the outside world. There is
also a connotation of fairy tale rescues where you are
either the hero or damsel in distress. Mental-Spiritual:
You need to examine the idea that the world is hostile,
that you need power over others, or isolation by being
above it all.
cat: Physical: You are focusing on qualities of inde-
pendence, power, self-sufficiency, mystery, magic,
feminine energy or the anima, sexuality, grace, and
cunning. When beautiful, a cat means you will meet a
charming new person. Emotional: You feel others are
fickle and uncaring, seductive, ominous, “catty,” or
aggressive. A black cat means you’re hesitant; you use
your intuition. Kittens symbolize unchanged, bother-
some, astral plane beings. Mental-Spiritual: A cat’s
nine lives symbolize good luck and longevity. 
cataclysm/catastrophe: Physical: Natural disasters
and upheavals symbolize sudden shifts or releases of
energy in your body or in the world. Emotional: There
is emotional instability, and you’re facing an upsetting
experience that could change your reality. You are
worried about basic survival issues. Mental-Spiritual:
You are about to have a breakthrough into a more
enlightened state as you let go and have faith. 
caterpillar: (see butterfly)
cattle: Physical: You’re focusing on good luck, the god-
dess, maternal nurturing, and fertility. Cattle feeding in
castle — cattle 
114

a pasture signify an easy flow of income. Herding
cattle means you are working harder to maintain your
income. Emotional: You are focusing on your individu-
ality, and going along with others too much or too
little. You feel you are too passive, docile, or con-
tented with your life. Mental-Spiritual: You are focus-
ing on your intrinsic value and what you are capable
of producing.
cave: Physical: A cave symbolizes the womb, child-
bearing, new life, creativity, or an empty place in you
that needs more energy and attentiveness. Emotional:
Crawling into a cave is being overwhelmed by a pres-
ent situation. Living in a cave means you feel deprived,
isolated, or need sustained privacy to regroup and
renew. Mental-Spiritual: You are focusing on your deep
inner self, the place of ancient wisdom, contemplation,
rites of passage, initiation, the earth, and your femi-
nine side. Coming out of a cave is the emergence of a
new self and desire to be involved. 
ceiling: Physical: You’re looking at the limits you or
others place on your progress. A ceiling means protec-
tion, if it’s also a roof. Emotional: You are focusing on
safety and self-expression. A leaky ceiling means an
intrusion of unwanted emotions or other people’s
values that affect you negatively. High ceilings give you
room to expand, while low ones make you feel stooped
and stunted. Mental-Spiritual: You’re looking at how
you use your thoughts, how open you are to change,
how imaginative and resourceful you can be, or how
far you have to go to the next floor. A glass ceiling
means you can see farther than you can actually go
physically right now. Something unknown holds you
back. Being on the ceiling looking down gives you the
soul’s perspective on a situation.
cattle — ceiling 115

celebrity: (see fame)
cellular phone/telephone: Physical: You are focusing
on establishing and maintaining connections and on
developing telepathy and clairaudience. Emotional:
Losing your phone means you’ve lost touch with your
true feelings or inner self, and to the degree you are
dependent on it, how capable you are of being alone. If
it’s ringing constantly, you need more quiet, gestation-
meditation time. You are looking at the balance
between extraversion and introversion in yourself.
Mental-Spiritual: You are working with a soul group or
collective consciousness. You’re receiving new infor-
mation, setting up events in the near future.
chase: Physical: If you are being chased, you are
avoiding a situation that is potentially dangerous or
unwanted. You have an answer someone needs. If you
are the pursuer, you are chasing after a goal, trying to
right a wrong that’s been committed against you, or
gain attention from someone who’s rejected you.
Emotional: Being chased means you feel indebted to
someone, or that you’re being driven away from
involvement with others. It means a rejected part of
you needs to be acknowledged and reintegrated into
your personality. Mental-Spiritual: You feel pursued by
disturbing, fearful ideas that you don’t want to experi-
ence. The pursuer may have a message for you. The
pursuer may be you!
cheat/steal: Physical: You are picking up hints that
someone is not being truthful or committed, or you
are trying to take the easy way to greater comfort. You
have compromised your beliefs or integrity and are
wasting time on fruitless endeavors. Emotional: You
celebrity — cheat/steal 
116

feel you aren’t meeting the expectations of others, and
are experiencing insecurity, and lack of trust and self-
esteem. You feel envious of someone else’s talent or
fortunate circumstances. Mental-Spiritual: If you’re
cheating at a game, you probably aren’t being honest
with yourself. Cheating on tests, or stealing, indicates
you think you lack knowledge, creativity, or a natural
talent, that no one will help you so you have to take
what you want.
chess: Physical: You have found a worthy opponent or
a perfect match in love or in your professional life. You
are looking at how you use your resources to accom-
plish goals. Emotional: You are showing yourself how
to be more deliberate and less impulsive concerning
your interactions with others. Mental-Spiritual: You
need to think through a situation or problem more
carefully before making a decision or taking action.
You are looking at the greater plan for your life. (see
games)
chest: (see heart)
chicken: Physical: You’re focusing on idle chatter and
gossip, what people are saying about you, or what
you’re saying about others. Emotional: You are looking
at qualities of cowardliness, erratic, helter-skelter
emotion, or lack of willpower. You are acting like a
“mother hen,” being too concerned about others.
Roosters represent cocky, show-off behavior with little
regard for others. Mental-Spiritual: Since chickens
aren’t known for intelligence, you’re telling yourself to
be more serious and focused. Hens with eggs repre-
sent new life and possibilities. Hearing a rooster crow
is a wake-up call.
cheat/steal — chicken 117

child: Physical: You are activating a new beginning,
fresh perspective, latent talent, spontaneity, or trust in
yourself. You are eager to learn, need simplicity, or
purity. Young people symbolize lost vitality, so you
may need rejuvenation. Emotional: You want to return
to a life where you had little responsibility and fewer
worries. You are pointing to your own immaturity or
the need to receive unconditionally. A childhood anxi-
ety or long-buried issue needs to be resolved. You’re
nurturing your vulnerable self. Mental-Spiritual:
Innocent loving children represent the true self or
child within. You are recalling old memories, or getting
in touch with your playful creativity. Saving a child
signifies saving a part of yourself that is in danger of
being lost.
chin: Physical: You are “leading with your chin” and
not listening to others enough. Emotional: You may
need to be more or less assertive or stubborn. Mental-
Spiritual: A strong or weak chin signifies how you cut
through to the heart of situations, your determination
and resolve. 
church: Physical: You are looking at your mistakes and
how to rectify things in your life. You need to treat
your body as a temple. Emotional: You’re looking for
guidance, to be uplifted and nurtured, to forgive or be
forgiven. You need to be appreciated by those you
love. Mental-Spiritual: You’re focusing on a spiritual
context or space, your value system and the things
you hold sacred, religious beliefs, or attitudes toward
organized religion. You need to pray for yourself or
others, or receive grace, spiritual nourishment, or
atonement. 
circle: (see ball)
child — circle 
118

city: Physical: You need more privacy or more social
involvement. You are dealing with community issues
involving cooperation and interdependence.
Emotional: To be alone in a city means you feel
rejected or overwhelmed by others. A city in ruins
means you’re neglecting social relationships. Mental-
Spiritual: A city with tall skyscrapers indicates you’re
dealing with collective thought and belief structures
and world views. 
cliff: Physical: You’ve reached a jumping off point
where you are faced with a major life change.
Emotional: You are facing your fears, overcoming the
need to retreat. Mental-Spiritual: You are at the edge of
consciousness and the unknown, a point of height-
ened understanding and awareness, where you need
to surrender and have faith to proceed farther. You
have an expanded view.
climb: Physical: You are making steady progress
toward a goal, requiring persistence and strength to
overcome obstacles. You experience an increase in
social, economic, or artistic pursuits. Emotional: How
and what you climb shows your courage, fear, and
enthusiasm for growth and the expansion of your
world view. Mental-Spiritual: You are focusing on the
specifics of your intellectual and spiritual growth,
your strategy on your path forward in life.
clock/watch: Physical: You are aware that your biolog-
ical clock is ticking, or that time is passing, and pro-
crastination about achieving life goals needs to be
overcome. You need to speed up or slow down.
Emotional: You are anxious about being on time, meet-
ing a deadline, or falling behind. Mental-Spiritual:
As with any circle, a clock represents wholeness, but
city — clock/watch 119

also the present moment, all time, and immortality.
Note the hour and minute and look for meaning in the
numbers.
clothes/costumes: Physical: You’re focusing on the
façade, or layers you put between yourself and others,
how you portray yourself, your role in life, and how
you like to feel personally. Changing clothes or cos-
tumes suggests a need for change, or adaptation to a
new way of being in the world. New clothes mean
social or economic improvement. Emotional: Being
undressed to various degrees indicates feelings of vul-
nerability or not fitting in socially. Underwear con-
notes hidden sexual issues. Too many clothes show
layers of protective identities. Mental-Spiritual: You
are examining beliefs about how to express yourself,
what you need to do to receive approval, and how vul-
nerable you can be. 
clutter: Physical: You need to let go of or discard
something. Emotional: You need more clear space so
you can calm down and not be worried about so many
things. You are afraid of being alone. Mental-Spiritual:
You need to sort through your beliefs and see how
many thoughts actually belong to other people, and
get rid of them. There may be parts of the self you’ve
rejected that need to be reclaimed. 
cobwebs: Physical: Old spider webs and dusty condi-
tions indicate that an area of your life has been neg-
lected, that you’ve been ignoring an issue for too long.
You need more exercise, better circulation, and detoxi-
fication. Emotional: You’re apathetic, depressed, or
afraid to experience emotions from the past. You need
to clear emotional blockages. Mental-Spiritual: You are
telling yourself to dust off some aspect of yourself,
clock/watch — cobwebs 
120

reexamine old beliefs, and clean house so you can see
yourself clearly again.
colors: Physical: A pale tint of a color indicates an
early stage of development or weak energy, while a
dark shade conveys strength, density, toxicity, or
blocked energy flow. Emotional: Muddy, clear, intense,
light, or dark color tells you about the qualities of
your current emotions. Mental-Spiritual: Bright, clear
color indicates a heightened sense of reality, even a
precognitive or visionary dream. If an object in your
dream has an unusual color, you’re seeing an extra
overlay of meaning. Complex colors, like olive green
(green and brown) or turquoise (green, yellow, and
blue) contain qualities of each color.
competition: Physical: You are anticipating a competi-
tive event or are involved in improving your perform-
ance under pressure. You need to grow and expand, or
rest from an intense competition that’s over.
Emotional: You’re focusing on being more assertive,
persevering, and ambitious. Watching a competition
from the sidelines means you feel others are passing
you by. Mental-Spiritual: If you win a competition, you
have the necessary skills to accomplish a goal or solve
problems. You are examining the need to win and what
winning and losing means.
computer/laptop: Physical: You need to get out more,
vary your routine, and be more sensual. If the periph-
eral components malfunction, you are frustrated
that you aren’t supported or producing effectively.
Emotional: If you lose your laptop, examine how
dependent you are on external systems to give life
meaning, and how you can develop more emotional
richness within as well as real-time relationships with
cobwebs — computer/laptop 121

others. If you have a virus or someone is hacking into
your computer, your privacy is being invaded or you
feel you’re at the mercy of another. Mental-Spiritual:
You’re looking at how you structure your awareness,
how your mind works. You are connecting to global
knowledge and examining your life record and identity.
If the computer crashes, you are overloaded and need
to take a break from being so mental. If you expand the
memory or speed, or get a bigger monitor, you are
jumping into new capacities and self-expression. 
counselor: Physical: You need to listen to your body. If
the person being counseled is not you, you may iden-
tify with that person’s issues, or be concerned about
his or her psychological health in waking life.
Emotional: You are seeking support and direction. Pay
attention to what the counselor is saying and doing.
You need to look within to explore feelings, gain
insight about a particular issue, or understand your
motives. Mental-Spiritual: You are receiving guidance
from your soul or a higher collective consciousness.
countryside: Physical: If your dream has a country
setting, you need to focus on physical activity and
more wholesome, natural values and goals. You need
more space to find clarity, or a slower pace. Emotional:
You are telling yourself to return to the basics and sim-
plify your life. You need to feel more generous and
patient. Mental-Spiritual: You are experiencing an
expansion of thought beyond separate structures into
communion and oneness.
crab: Physical: You are looking at your inability to
effectively move forward, how you sidestep or avoid
difficulties and unpleasantness. Emotional: You are
pretending to be tough or looking at your “crabby”
computer/laptop — crab 
122

personality. Claws indicate a desire to cause pain to
others, or fear of being hurt, as well as a tendency to
grasp and cling. Mental-Spiritual: As with all water
dwelling animals, the crab represents issues in the
unconscious.
crash: Physical: Being in a vehicle that crashes or is
about to crash indicates that a situation in your life is
out of control. It also means you simply arrive sud-
denly and dramatically at a new level of achievement.
Crashing into the ground from the air means you are
descending rapidly from the mental and emotional
realms, coming back to your body, or you need to be
more grounded. Emotional: Crashing into a similar
vehicle means a confrontation with someone else’s
physical presence (car, motorcycle), emotional values
(boats), or belief structures and opinions (planes).
Mental-Spiritual: You’re going too fast, being impulsive
and inflexible, listening to incorrect advice, and need
to pay attention, and regulate your mind. You’re expe-
riencing a spiritual chiropractic adjustment or open-
ing that will catalyze a new phase of your life.
criminal/outlaw: Physical: You’re exploring your ani-
malistic side. Emotional: You feel the rules don’t apply
to you, that you’re above others. You take what you
want because you feel no one will help you, that
others have more than you. You are experiencing guilt
over something you’ve done, and are anxious over
being found out. Mental-Spiritual: If you or someone
else is breaking the law, you feel too boxed in by cus-
toms, expectations, and authority and want to break
through limitations. 
crocodile/alligator: Physical: You are focusing on
hidden danger, deceit, or evil-minded people. The
crab — crocodile/alligator 123

crocodile represents your own aggressive behavior, or
negative, snapping attitudes. Emotional: You feel you
could be swallowed up by chaos, greed, gluttony,
hidden violence, or dark, stifling emotions. Perhaps
you’ve displayed false emotion and shed ingenuous
“crocodile tears.” Mental-Spiritual: You are focusing on
your deepest subconscious, primal mind, your beliefs
in evil and lack of safety in the world, and your sur-
vival instincts. You need to look for ways to be more
sincere.
crossroads/fork in the road: Physical: You are break-
ing physical habits and seeking new direction in life.
Emotional: You are dealing with anxiety about making
the right decision, facing the unknown, or separating
from loved ones. Mental-Spiritual: You have a choice
to make, and it often involves an intuitive component.
You are at a powerful point of integration of diverse
ideas. 
crowd: Physical: You are looking at your own author-
ity, leadership ability, or questioning your role in
society. Emotional: You feel you’re being swallowed
up by other people’s ideas and emotions. Or, you need
greater anonymity and privacy. Mental-Spiritual: A
crowd indicates that you are participating in a group
mind or collective consciousness.
crown: Physical: You have received recognition, or
want to, for a job well done, or for your innate abili-
ties. You are acknowledging your own competence
and power. You are about to receive greater responsi-
bility. Emotional: You are dealing with your relation-
ship to authority figures. There can be issues of vanity,
envy, resentment, and need for attention. Mental-
Spiritual: A crown symbolizes spiritual authority, often
crocodile/alligator — crown 
124

indicating an initiation. It is a transmitter of knowledge
from the collective consciousness to your conscious
mind. 
crystals/crystal ball: Physical: You need to cleanse
your body or listen to the messages your body is
bringing you. Seeing a crystal in the body means that
area may be blocked and needs to receive and trans-
mit energy more fully. Emotional: You are telling your-
self you need greater inner peace and transparency
(honesty and vulnerability). Mental-Spiritual: You are
accessing higher wisdom and opening your intuition,
developing clarity of perception and removing illu-
sions. Look for the visions, take note of the messages.
cut: Physical: If your body is cut, or you cut someone
else, you are showing yourself an area that needs to
release pent-up energy, pain, and contractedness.
Cutting yourself indicates a need to release feelings of
turmoil by experiencing physical pain. Emotional: You
are focusing on severed relationships, cutting off from
feelings or other people, sarcastic remarks, or anger
and rage. Mental-Spiritual: You need to cut through to
the heart of an issue, be honest, and see clearly with
spiritually based insight. Having your hair cut means a
loss of vital power or a focusing of your consciousness
to be aligned with your personal expression.
D
dam: Physical: The energy or circulation in your body
is blocked. You are hoarding something. Emotional:
You are focused on repressed emotions, holding
back a flood of tears, panic, or anger. A dam breaking
means you’re releasing past fears and emotions.
crown — dam 125

Mental-Spiritual: The dam itself represents the reason
you hold back your self-expression, whether that be
family or cultural beliefs, an unexamined habit, or
stubborn resistance to change caused by fear.
dance: Physical: You need more exuberant, sponta-
neous movement and exercise. You are focusing on
romance, sexual exchange, freedom from constraints,
participation in life, pleasure, frivolity, and graceful-
ness. Emotional: If dancing with others, you are look-
ing at partnership dynamics, fluid cooperation with
others, and how well you fit in and interact in your
social setting. A dance performance shows how confi-
dent, talented, joyful, and comfortable you feel
expressing yourself in the world. Mental-Spiritual: You
are focusing on psychological and spiritual release
and sacred communion with the rhythms of life, espe-
cially if you’re dancing alone. You are integrating the
masculine and feminine sides of your nature.
danger: Physical: You are warning yourself about
something you’ve been overlooking. To escape danger
portends success. Emotional: You are anxious about a
situation in your waking life and need to use intuition
to feel what’s really happening below the surface.
Mental-Spiritual: Confronting danger means you are
overcoming fear and learning from the situation. What
is dangerous in the dream is something you haven’t
integrated into your totality.
datebook: (see calendar)
daytime: Physical: When a dream setting is during the
day, you are experiencing things clearly. What you
need to do is obvious. You know where you’re going in
life. Emotional: The sunnier the scene, the more the
dam — daytime 
126

activity represents something beneficial, or something
you need to see as a good part of yourself. Mental-
Spiritual: You’re dealing with material that has already
become conscious or you are shedding light on an
important fact. 
deafness: Physical: You are closing yourself off from
new experiences. You don’t want to hear something
you need to acknowledge. Emotional: You feel
secluded or excluded from the world. You are too
stubborn, resisting change or other people’s realities.
You aren’t sharing your emotional reality with others.
Mental-Spiritual: You need to withdraw from the chaos
of the world into a quiet inner sanctum to find your
own still, small voice of guidance and truth. You need
to develop greater flexibility and openness concerning
ideas.
death/dead people: Physical: Dreaming of death is not
necessarily a literal omen, and it’s untrue that if you
die in your dream, your body will also die. You’re
focusing on the end of a phase in your life or a part of
your identity, getting ready for rebirth, renewal, and
growth. Dying slowly or seeing a corpse represents a
devitalized condition or lifeless routine. Emotional:
You are experiencing anxiety about endings. Dreaming
of another person’s death means you’re letting go of
the quality or emotion that person represents, or you
feel the possible loss of that aspect and want to acti-
vate it more in yourself. Mental-Spiritual: Talking to a
person who has died is resolving incomplete commu-
nications, and it helps activate the qualities the
person represents to you. You are active in the higher,
more telepathic realms of your awareness, receiving
guidance from your soul. Seeing yourself after death
reassures you that you are eternal.
daytime — death/dead people 127

deer: Physical: You are focusing on your ability to be
agile, graceful, and alert. You need to be more respon-
sive to a situation, notice subtle cues, and be quieter.
Deer often represent friends, and what kind of friend
you are to others. Emotional: You need to experience
gentleness, kindness, compassion, innocence, purity,
and willingness to surrender. To see a dead or dying
deer, or to kill a deer, warns of a betrayal by a friend,
or that you have acted without heart. Mental-Spiritual:
Deer are considered divine messengers that help open
the heart. Pay attention to where they lead you, and
what they say or convey with their eyes.
descend: (see below)
desert: Physical: You are dehydrated or lacking in
important nutrients. You need alone time away from
the overstimulation of society to renew yourself.
Emotional: You are feeling isolated, lonely, creatively
dry or barren, or poor. Storms in the desert indicate
emotional issues surfacing that are connected with
feeling unloved and neglected. Mental-Spiritual: You
are deepening into your spiritual nature, retreating to
a place of simplicity, silence, openness, and freedom
where you can find clarity. Wandering through a
desert indicates a period where you must reexamine
what’s truly important and possibly give up things you
don’t need. Finding an oasis means you’re connecting
with your divine nature, when and where you least
expect it.
desk: Physical: Sitting at a desk represents self-
exploration and discovery. You are focusing on your
work and the technical issues of your life, taking care
of business. Emotional: You are protecting your
secrets and personal information. How neat the desk
is indicates how overwhelmed you feel by details and
deer — desk 
128

mundane tasks. If you’re at someone else’s desk, you
lack confidence in your own abilities or are copying
someone else’s qualities. Mental-Spiritual: You are acti-
vating new knowledge and ideas, evaluating problems
and opportunities. The kind of desk hints at your
sense of personal authority. Desks also represent a
place or focus for bringing your creativity to life. 
diamond: Physical: You are focusing on being the best
you can be, cleaning up your act, and being totally
healthy. Owning and wearing diamonds means you
attain honor and recognition. Receiving a diamond
from someone means you’re forming a committed rela-
tionship. Emotional: Finding diamonds means you’re
about to have good luck, while stealing them means
you aspire to a higher station in life than you feel
worthy of or qualified to have. Losing a diamond
means you aren’t valuing part of yourself enough. A
fake diamond means you or others are pretending to
be something you’re not, or you feel undervalued.
Mental-Spiritual: You’re finding clarity in matters that
have been clouding you. You are focusing on your own
highest, clearest soul consciousness, or clear light.
You’re looking at core truth, unending love, and what
is permanent and enduring. 
dig/dirt: Physical: Dirt represents fertility; you are
planting the seeds of a new phase of growth. You need
to clean out your body or house or simply be more
grounded. Emotional: You want to bury, hide, or deny
something. You feel unclean or guilty that you’ve been
acting in an unwholesome or devious way. Mental-
Spiritual: You are trying to understand yourself better,
looking for root causes, hidden secrets, buried treas-
ure, and basic motives. You are reaching down into
the subconscious to unearth answers, information, or
talent. 
desk — dig/dirt 129

diploma: Physical: You have achieved a level of suc-
cess and expertise and are acknowledged by others.
Emotional: You are worried about succeeding at a task
or job, or don’t feel qualified to handle a situation. You
have completed a difficult time of emotional clearing.
Mental-Spiritual: You have successfully completed a
life lesson or phase of growth and feel natural self-
esteem. (see graduation)
disease: Physical: Dreaming of illness isn’t necessarily
literal or precognitive. You may be holding tension
and stress in your body, or your energy may be
blocked. You need to change a self-defeating lifestyle
choice. Emotional: Getting a disease can reflect a fear
of the outside world, or distrust of your own body and
self. If you contract a disease from another person,
you feel that person’s influence in your life is detri-
mental. If the disease has a stigma, as with sexually
transmitted diseases, you have anxiety about your
morality. Mental-Spiritual: You are looking at your lack
of faith, and where you don’t feel the divine, loving
presence in yourself and in life.
dive: Physical: You are trying to get to the bottom of a
current situation. If you’re standing on a diving board,
you’re preparing for a serious temptation or ordeal
that’s coming in the near future, summoning your
courage. Emotional: You are facing and experiencing
deep emotional wounds or are seeking to intensify
your passion and empathy. Mental-Spiritual: You are
delving into your subconscious as well as the greater
unknown. 
divorce: Physical: This may be a reflection of a real-life
experience, or you feel you are being denied a rightful
position or an opportunity to work with people you
admire. Emotional: You are experiencing stress over a
diploma — divorce 
130

relationship that you’re afraid will end or are feeling
vulnerable and abandoned. You are caught in the
blame game. Mental-Spiritual: You feel alienated from
yourself and your truth, and need to reconnect with
your purpose. You need to experience how loved and
loving you are, that your self-worth is not dependent
on approval from others. (see ex)
dock: Physical: You are grounding your creative urges.
Seeing a dock from a ship means a positive turn of
events and new action. Emotional: You are finding
security amidst emotional confusion or overwhelming
feelings. Sitting alone on a dock means you feel wistful,
sad, or dreamy. Mental-Spiritual: You are bringing spir-
itual insight and visions through your emotion and
motivation into fruition in the world, making your
dreams real.
doctor/nurse/healer: Physical: You need to attend to
your body’s condition. Healing has already occurred,
is about to occur, or there is a need for healing. If you
have an operation in a hospital, you are adjusting the
way energy flows through your subtle energy bodies
and physical body. You wish for a cure for a problem
you’re having. Emotional: You need more nurturing, to
feel cared for and safe. You feel too deeply probed by
someone or are probing into yourself. Mental-Spiritual:
You have subliminal insights about the cause of illness
in yourself or someone else. You are focusing on the
healing authority of your own soul and other knowl-
edgeable souls, making fundamental shifts in the flow
of your awareness. 
dog: Physical: You are focusing on friendships, new
relationships, family values, or masculine energy. You
are working like a dog, or dog-tired, and need some rest.
Emotional: You are looking at issues of trustworthiness,
divorce — dog 131

loyalty, protection, and dogged tenacity, both in your-
self and others. Happy dogs and puppies symbolize
simple joy in life. Aggressive dogs indicate similar ten-
dencies in you that need appropriate outlets or that
you feel defensive about being invaded. Mental-
Spiritual: As guardians of the underworld, dogs connect
you to the unconscious and often bring important
messages. They also teach about openheartedness
and positive attitude.
dolphin/whale: Physical: You are focusing on a fluid,
easy way of moving through the world, working with
your inner senses, especially telepathy and personal
vibration. Emotional: You need to trust your friends
and colleagues, develop a joyful attitude, and beautiful
harmonious feelings. You want protection moving into
unknown territory or need to feel more trust when
exploring emotions. You are developing heightened
sensitivity and good communication in relationships.
Mental-Spiritual: You are seeking high-level intelligent
guidance, or your soul is sending a message to you.
Since dolphins and whales are conductors of souls
and keepers of ancient wisdom, it’s important to listen
to what they say. If you’re riding a dolphin or whale,
you are experiencing optimism, communion, and love
for humankind. Dolphins symbolize spiritual excite-
ment while whales link to profound calmness and
peace. 
door/doorway: Physical: Stepping through a door
symbolizes a new endeavor, or moving from one phase
of life to another. A closed door is an unavailable
opportunity, or you must exert effort to open it. A
choice of many doors shows a juncture at which a
choice must be made. Revolving doors suggest you’re
moving in circles, going nowhere. Emotional: If doors
dog — door/doorway 
132

are locked or obstructed, you are making life difficult
for yourself through resistance, or there are
repressed, hidden emotions you’re avoiding. You need
to find the key that allows entry without force. If you
can’t find the door out of someplace, you’re feeling
trapped by life circumstances. A door slammed in
your face represents opportunities that are denied
you, possibly because you feel unwanted. Mental-
Spiritual: You are bridging two states of awareness.
A small door symbolizes the desire for inner explo-
ration and self-discovery. 
dove: Physical: You are seeking greater harmony, love,
and commitment in relationships, as well as an end to
disagreements. Emotional: You need inner peace, a
happy domestic and social life, or look forward to the
return of an old friend. Mental-Spiritual: Doves bring the
olive branch of understanding and also represent the
Holy Spirit or a connecting link between heaven and
humankind. Released from the hands, the dove flies
with joy toward the divine. You are seeking communion.
dragon: Physical: You are focusing on protecting or
uncovering buried secrets and talents, your heroic
nature, and on balancing your internal masculine and
feminine energies. Dragons in western culture represent
fire and earth. A fire-breathing dragon in a cave means
you are freeing your wildness and protective nature. In
eastern culture, dragons represent air and water and
are good luck. A flying or swimming dragon indicates
you are freeing your emotional, mental, and spiritual
life. Emotional: Slaying a western dragon means you are
overcoming your fears. Riding an eastern dragon means
good fortune and wisdom is coming your way. Mental-
Spiritual: You are looking at what is hidden deep within
the soul, at your true powers and riches. 
door/doorway — dragon 133

drawer: Physical: You are looking at parts of yourself
that have been stored away or hidden, that you now
are ready to use. An open drawer signifies a new
opportunity, and if full, you’ll have plenty of resources
and help. An empty drawer is an invitation to create.
Emotional: You are showing yourself your internal
state, whether it is disorderly and chaotic or neatly
organized with psychological order. A locked drawer
suggests obstacles in your path or resistance from
someone. Mental-Spiritual: You are reviewing opportu-
nities, resources, and old ideas. If you clean out your
drawers, you are making space for a new, more
inspired awareness and updated accomplishments.
drift/float: Physical: You need to strengthen personal
discipline and reaffirm your goals, or you need some
downtime to relax. Emotional: You have lost your moti-
vation, are distracted, or feel unfocused. You are
between projects or phases of your life, feeling anxiety
about what to do next. Mental-Spiritual: The motion of
drifting and floating represents activity in the spiritual
realm. You need to let go and simply “be” wherever you
are and realign with your higher purpose, letting new
direction arise spontaneously.
driving: Physical: You are focusing on taking charge of
your life direction and journey. If you can’t see the
road ahead, you lack a sense of purpose and goals.
Driving into oncoming traffic means you are challeng-
ing others and making progress difficult for yourself.
Emotional: If someone else is driving, you feel passive,
powerless, or at the mercy of external influences. If
you’re speeding or tailgating, you are being too selfish,
and out of harmony with others. Mental-Spiritual: You
are experiencing the process of manifesting your life.
Driving in reverse means you are caught in illusion,
ignoring important facts.

drown: Physical: Your body is bloated and retaining
water, or you need to flush out toxins with more water.
Emotional: You feel unable to keep your head above
water. You are overwhelmed by your life and sublimi-
nal emotions, or those of others. You feel frightened of
being swallowed up by unconscious forces. You are
dealing with difficult issues concerning your mother
or your birth experience. Seeing someone drown sug-
gests you’re too involved in something beyond your
control or you’ve lost your identity. Mental-Spiritual:
You are allowing yourself to be reborn, to surrender to
the unknown, and access deep wisdom and feminine
energy.
drum: Physical: If you are playing the drums, you are
living life on your own terms. Emotional: The kind of
drums you play or hear shows the emotional state,
and thus the overall tone of your life: it might be jazzy
and exciting, militant, wild, or like jungle drums.
Mental-Spiritual: To hear a drum symbolizes the
rhythm of life, your heartbeat, and the need to keep a
steady pace in the pursuit of your goals. There might
also be a message in the drumbeat, or someone is call-
ing for help.
DVD: Physical: Watching a DVD indicates you need to
activate your visual imagination and relax for awhile.
Returning a DVD to the store means you’re finished
with an experience, ready to begin a new endeavor.
Emotional: Moving back and forth through a DVD
means you have regrets or remorse and wish you
could go back and do something over again, or you are
trying to remember something important. Mental-
Spiritual: You’re looking for new ideas about what’s
possible in your life, or you’re examining everything
you’ve done so far, as though in a life review.

E 
eagle/hawk: Physical: You are focusing on your own
natural authority, nobility, power, courage, fierceness,
and pride. You are looking at long-range goals and
ambitions, perhaps connected to attaining wealth and
influence. Emotional: You are learning to control your
emotions and focus attention more neutrally, though
you may be aggressive and somewhat ruthless.
Mental-Spiritual: You’re stretching your mind into the
spiritual realms, looking for clear perception, keen dis-
crimination, and larger perspective. These high-flying
birds act as messengers from the sun, or soul, from
other souls in the highest dimensions, so look for mes-
sages and lessons. 
ears: (see deafness)
earth: Physical: You are working on being fully
focused in your body, being practical, and finishing
things so you have tangible results. You need to be
more loyal, committed, stable, or careful. Issues of fer-
tility are on your mind. Emotional: Under the earth’s
surface, for example, in caves, tunnels, basements,
cellars, and graves, lurk the contents of your subcon-
scious mind, which are often frightening. You are
facing your long-buried monsters. Mental-Spiritual:
The earth seen as a globe indicates wholeness, the
mother principle, and global awareness. The earth
also contains buried treasure and ancient wisdom.
You’re deepening your awareness.
earthquake: Physical: You’re experiencing, or are
about to experience, a shake-up of your world that
threatens your stability and foundations. If you escape
from the quake, you overcome the challenges.
eagle/hawk — earthquake 
136

Emotional: You are caught in feelings of anxiety, inse-
curity, and helplessness. You can’t depend on people
you thought were reliable. You are letting go of con-
trolling behavior and old fears. Mental-Spiritual: You’re
focusing on a total change in the way you view your
life — and even reality itself — and on the develop-
ment of new attitudes and mindsets. 
east: Physical: You’re focusing on a new beginning,
renewal, or birth. You need to dedicate yourself to an
area of your life, like your goals, career, family, or per-
sonal growth. You are looking for opportunities and
adventure. Emotional: You are impulsive and ahead of
yourself, overenthusiastic and blind to something.
Mental-Spiritual: You’re looking for fresh perspective,
insight, new intellectual knowledge, and control. 
eat/food: Physical: You need a consistent diet of
healthy foods, or less or more food. You are seeking
gratification based on physical pleasures. Eating with
others means harmonious cooperation, personal gain,
and joyful undertakings. If someone is taking food
away from you, you have trouble with jealous people.
Emotional: The food you’re eating shows a part of
yourself you’ve been denying that needs to be inte-
grated. You are worrying about something that’s
“eating at you.” If you’re eating alone, you feel loss,
loneliness, rejection, or depression. You crave com-
panionship and the comfort of being loved. Mental-
Spiritual: Eating represents taking in new ideas or
trying to find spiritual fulfillment. 
eavesdrop: Physical: Others are taking advantage
of you, or vice versa. You need to pay closer attention
in your waking life to what you’re being told.
Emotional: You feel left out of the loop, that you
earthquake — eavesdrop 137

must gain advantage by secretive means. You feel inse-
cure because you don’t know enough. Mental-Spiritual:
You’re looking for insight and information you think
other people have, when what you really need to know
is inside yourself. Be more open to hearing the guid-
ance and criticism of others. (see gossip)
egg: Physical: Develop your inner resources, break out
of your shell. You are ready for a new phase of life, and
you’re focusing on your creative potential. Emotional:
You feel nurturing and patient, or need this from
others. Cracked, broken eggs mean you feel drained,
unappreciated, vulnerable, fragile, or like a failure.
Mental-Spiritual: You have many unhatched ideas, or
ideas that need to gestate longer. You are focusing on
wholeness and spiritual potential. Broken eggs mean
you’ve spilled your ideas before they were fully
cooked. 
elbow: Physical: You need to make more space for
yourself or push obstacles aside. Emotional: You feel
you are fending off people who want too much from
you, or you hesitate to take up your own space for fear
of being judged. Mental-Spiritual: You are focusing on
your ability to translate your heart’s desires into form
without interference, granting yourself the right to be
fully extended into the world.
electricity: Physical: You are focusing on the workings
of your nervous system or your charisma and the
power to affect other people, or be affected by other
intense people. A live electrical wire represents the
threat of sudden disruption or destruction of your
plans. Emotional: Your emotions are too high-strung, or
you need a jumpstart of excitement. To be shocked by
electricity means you need to wake up to a potential
eavesdrop — electricity 
138

danger. Mental-Spiritual: You are taken with new ideas
that tend to overwhelm you or push you to the edge of
a sudden personality change. You are “rewiring” your
internal circuitry, attuning yourself, preparing to run a
higher frequency of spiritual energy through your
system.
elephant: Physical: You are focusing on laying solid
groundwork for prosperity and success through devel-
oping a steadfast character, excellent memory and
intelligence, gentleness, family values, loyalty, honor,
dignity, and the power to perform daunting tasks.
Emotional: You feel introverted and in need of greater
kindness and sensitivity. If the elephant is wild or
untamed, you are looking at rogue or uncontrollable
forces and plundering emotions affecting your life.
Mental-Spiritual: You are developing your heart to a
high degree, merging intelligence with compassion.
You are understanding how lucky you are.
elevator/escalator: Physical: You are experiencing
many ups and downs in your life, changing status, or
you are moving into different parts of your body to
heal yourself. A falling elevator represents a rapid
descent from higher dimensions back to the body,
often just before you awake. Emotional: If you are
going down, you are descending into your subcon-
scious to discover what’s blocking you, or you’re
bringing higher motives to bear in your everyday life.
If you’re in a falling elevator, you feel out of control or
need to surrender. If you’re stuck between floors, you
need to clarify your intentions and see why you’re
afraid to move. Mental-Spiritual: Elevators and escala-
tors help you move between levels or dimensions of
yourself. If you’re moving up, you are addressing
electricity — elevator/escalator 139

important issues, finding a more elevated view, and
making progress on your spiritual journey with ease. 
enemy: (see adversary)
escape: Physical: Escape from jail or a confined place
signifies your need to move beyond a restrictive situa-
tion or attitude. Emotional: You are resisting some-
thing you need to face, or you’ve allowed yourself to
become dominated and must take back your authority.
Mental-Spiritual: You are taking an escapist attitude,
bucking authority, or are dissolving barriers and
boxes — mental structures — you’ve been living
within. To escape from injury means you’re connect-
ing with your natural freedom and well-being. 
explosion/bomb: Physical: You are experiencing a
sudden release of energy or toxicity in your body, or a
sudden upheaval and change in your life that might
involve loss. Something needs to move, and you need
to let go. Finding an unexploded or ticking bomb is a
sign that something is about to blow open. Emotional:
You are experiencing an emotional catharsis, a release
of anger and violence. If you are blown up into the air
or engulfed in flames, you feel the brunt of a betrayal
or abuse from others. Mental-Spiritual: You are experi-
encing a release of kundalini (a vital force that lies dor-
mant, but once awakened, leads to enormous spiritual
energy) energy that frees your consciousness to move
to higher realms. You are making rapid progress on
your spiritual path.
ex: Physical: People you had past relationships with,
even old friends, indicate that you’re working out les-
sons that pertained to those relationships. You are
integrating a quality he or she represented that you
have ex-ed out or neglected in yourself. Emotional:
elevator/escalator — ex 
140

You have incomplete emotions from the past that are
being triggered by a similar situation in your current
life. What you learned from a previous relationship
needs to be applied to a present one so you don’t
repeat a mistake. Mental-Spiritual: You are looking at
your inner balance of masculine and feminine energy.
You are contemplating the positive traits you want in a
new relationship. (see divorce)
eyes/eyebrows: Physical: If you see your own eyes,
you are focusing on accepting yourself fully, or are
receiving information about the condition of your
physical eyes. If someone is winking, you’re being let
in on a secret or something is being kept from you. If
there is something in your eye, there are obstacles in
your path. Emotional: You are opening to experience
the love that comes through these windows of the
soul. Closed eyes mean you are afraid to see the truth,
are avoiding intimacy, or need to introvert to find
deeper knowledge. Crossed eyes mean you are con-
fused. Eyebrows show emotions like amazement, dis-
belief, doubt, concern, or disapproval. Mental-Spiritual:
You are focusing on your ability to see clearly, how you
receive insight, your own visions, and level of enlighten-
ment. If you have one eye, you are refusing to accept
other viewpoints. If you have a third eye, you have a
clear inner vision of spiritual truth. Floating, disembod-
ied eyes are spiritual guides connecting with you. 
F 
face: Physical: Seeing your face means you’re focusing
on your self-image or the mask you show others, and
how much of your real self shines through. You are
experiencing confrontations or heightened visibility in
ex — face 141

waking life. Emotional: Looking out from another
person’s face indicates an aspect of yourself you need
to accept and express. If your face is scarred, flawed,
red, or pimply, you are experiencing erupting emo-
tions, embarrassment, self-consciousness, or slights to
your reputation. Interacting with a faceless person
indicates you’ve decided to be impersonal and are not
facing emotional discomforts. Mental-Spiritual: Facial
expressions convey nuances of attitudes you are
unconsciously expressing. 
falling: Physical: It’s not true that you’ll die if you
don’t wake up before you hit bottom. You need to sur-
render in an area of your life and have faith. You feel
you’ve lost control, or are headed for failure or a fall
from grace. Emotional: You are dealing with feelings of
insecurity, helplessness, lack of confidence, fear of
losing someone, or worry. Falling a long way and land-
ing safely means you can trust your instinct to lead
you out of difficulty. Mental-Spiritual: Falling repre-
sents the basic downward momentum of conscious-
ness from the higher realms back to the body, and can
happen just before you awake. 
fame/famous people: Physical: You need attention,
recognition, freer self-expression, and interaction with
others at a larger scale than you presently have.
You’re focusing on qualities in the celebrity that you’d
like to activate or make peace with in yourself. Look
for specific character traits and judgments you hold
concerning the person. Emotional: You doubt your
ability to please others and be loved, or to be as excel-
lent as you can be when scrutinized too closely.
Mental-Spiritual: You need to get clear about what suc-
cess means to you. You’re glimpsing what you are
capable of when your soul is fully present.

fat: Physical: You need more personal space and insu-
lation from others, to take up your own space and be
yourself without apology. You need to share and
release more of your self-expressive energy.
Emotional: You are afraid of getting fat and being
rejected by others. You feel guilty about something
you did. You feel you can’t get enough love, that you
need to hoard your reserves because loss is always
imminent. Mental-Spiritual: You are focusing on the
need for gratitude, how you should use what you’ve
already been given, how big you really are spiritually. 
father: Physical: You are examining the way you use
power, authority, protectiveness, control, and leader-
ship skills. You need to be more self-reliant. If your
father dies in the dream, you need to take a new lead-
ership role in your life. Emotional: You are working out
emotional issues you have with your own father.
Mental-Spiritual: The archetypal father, shown by any
male authority figure, represents kingly power, provi-
sion, impersonal love, the law, tradition, discipline,
and structure. You are looking at your ideas of the
Creator.
feces: Physical: You need to cleanse your body,
change your diet, or take care with your elimination
system. You need to rid your life of toxic people, clut-
ter, and situations that have outlived their usefulness.
Emotional: There are aspects of yourself you consider
dirty and repulsive. You are in denial, or ending a
period of denial and self-deception. You have low self-
esteem or are caught in too much complaining and
negativity. This also pertains to anal retentive behav-
ior. Mental-Spiritual: You are becoming aware of nega-
tive habits and getting rid of them, or simply letting go
of a period of life or ideas that might serve as fertilizer
to others.
fat — feces 143

feet: Physical: You are looking at how you take a
stand, achieve grounding, find support and balance,
and begin to move forward. You need to be more prac-
tical and sensible, or you are ready for more independ-
ence and freedom. Emotional: Being barefoot means
you’re connecting directly with what’s real, not putting
on false airs. Having no feet means you feel unpre-
pared for what’s coming. Mental-Spiritual: You’re
focusing on foundational thought structures and your
sense of understanding. You’re contemplating your
human connection with the world and how to be more
fully present. If you’re washing someone’s feet, you are
respecting that person’s spiritual self. 
fence: Physical: You’re focusing on a limitation you’ve
put on yourself, a challenge or barrier to forward
movement, the need for privacy and boundaries,
respect for others’ boundaries, or the need to pause
and reconsider goals. Climbing or jumping over a
fence means you’re expanding into new territory
where you may meet with opposition at first.
Emotional: You feel ostracized or invaded by others.
You are dealing with issues of entitlement. Mental-
Spiritual: You are “on the fence” about an issue or
decision. You’re examining your world view and its
limits, especially if you climb to the top of a fence. 
fight: (see battle)
files/folders/file cabinet: Physical: You need to keep
your facts and information straight. Whether elec-
tronic or paper, you’re retrieving data and resources
you need to function successfully and be yourself.
You need to design better systems for your life and
work. Emotional: You feel overwhelmed by detail,
afraid of falling behind, or insecure because you lack
feet — files/folders/file cabinet 
144

information you need. If a file cabinet is locked, there
is something you don’t want revealed to others or
something is being kept from you. Mental-Spiritual:
You’re focusing on bodies of knowledge or memories
and whether to keep making them real or to let them
go. A file cabinet with open drawers means you wel-
come new viewpoints and ideas.
fire: Physical: Check the “fire element” in your body,
often connected to the heart and liver. You need to
purify and burn off toxins, get more oxygen. You are
ready for a transition that might require total release
of the old. If you put out fires, you’ll overcome obsta-
cles and succeed, though getting there may seem end-
less. A bonfire suggests there is a larger goal you
hadn’t considered. Emotional: Setting fires, seeing an
inferno, being burned, or being caught in a fire all indi-
cate that you’re angry, full of suppressed rage that
threatens to go out of control, and you’re afraid of the
destructive consequences. You feel passionate, impul-
sive, desirous, or zealous. Breathing fire means a
vicious verbal attack. A fire in a fireplace denotes con-
tentment, safety, and romance. Mental-Spiritual: You’re
involved in a process of purification, illumination, spir-
itual transformation, and waking to your positive
powers. A firefly means you’re receiving bright ideas
and insights from your highest self.
fireworks: Physical: You want to celebrate a personal
achievement. You’d like to be the center of attention
and show off to others. Emotional: You’re ready to
release pent-up emotion and feel more jubilant. You
need more exhilarating activity. Mental-Spiritual: You
are entering a period of colorful, uninhibited self-
expression where you’ll discover exciting new ideas,
files/folders/file cabinet — fireworks 145

talents, and levels of creativity. You’ve broken through
to a new level of awareness.
fish/fishing: Physical: Catching a fish, especially a big
one, portends success in a venture. Seeing fish means
you need to be more adaptable, flexible, and sensitive.
Emotional: You are focusing on specific feelings in
your subconscious. Catching a fish means dealing with
one deep emotional issue. Trying to hold a fish that
wriggles away means you’re having trouble forming or
maintaining a relationship. A dead or dying fish signi-
fies disappointment or hopelessness. You are inse-
cure, “fishing for compliments.” Mental-Spiritual: You
are dipping into the collective unconscious for cre-
ative ideas, or messages from the superconscious
mind. You are actively pursuing a spiritual quest and
transformation. 
flag: Physical: You’re focusing on your identity as part
of a large group or the qualities you hold in common
with others. A waved flag warns of dangerous condi-
tions ahead, a new group you’re about to encounter,
or signals the end of a process you’ve been engaged
in. Emotional: You’re focused on feelings of pride, loy-
alty, family, and patriotism, and issues of belonging or
being an outcast. Mental-Spiritual: You’re looking at
the goals and beliefs you hold in common with a
group.
float: (see drift)
flood: Physical: You are experiencing an overwhelm-
ing situation, often with tribulations and serious reper-
cussions. Emotional: You feel out of control and
overwhelmed by repressed emotions or other
people’s emotions. You have lost your boundaries.
fireworks — flood 
146

Mental-Spiritual: A gentle flood, leaks in the house, or
broken pipes indicate that you’re in a process of clean-
ing yourself up, preparing for a new phase of growth.
(see drown)
floor: Physical: You are focusing on your support
system and the foundations of your life. Repairing,
replacing, or shining the floor means you’re improving
the basic conditions of your home and work life. If the
floor is slanted or uneven, you have minor impedi-
ments to success that must be patiently remedied.
Emotional: You may feel “floored” by emotions that
cause you to stop or surrender. Mental-Spiritual: A
floor represents a division between the conscious and
unconscious mind as well as between various levels of
your awareness, as with multi-storied buildings. You
are shifting your reality if you’re moving between
floors. The floor you stand on is the reality you’re
creating.
flower: Physical: You are focusing on the stage of your
personal growth process (bud to full flower), your
beauty, attractiveness, sexuality, sensuality, and natu-
ral self-expression. Emotional: You’re activating feel-
ings of peace, gentleness, kindness, pleasure,
sweetness, and love. You want to be defenseless.
Withered or dead flowers denote disappointment or
loss of hope and joy. The flower’s color gives clues to
the emotion: yellow/joy, white/sadness and purity,
red/romantic love, pink/affection, lavender/spiritual
connection. Receiving a bouquet means you are loved,
appreciated, and admired. Mental-Spiritual: You are
tuning in to your soul and heart, and how perfect,
beautiful, and unique you are. 
flood — flower 147

flying: Physical: You’re focusing on your dreams,
goals, and how far you want to go in life. How you fly
represents the way you grow and express your creativ-
ity. Flying easily, surveying the landscape, means
you’re on top of a situation, or that you’ve risen above
something that used to be a problem. Running into
power lines, trees, mountains, or other obstacles
means you’re dealing with people, situations, or ideas
that block your progress. Emotional: You need more
freedom, exhilaration, adventure, and joy. If you feel
fear about the inability to control your flight or flying
too high, you doubt your power and skill and may
dread the possibility of failure. Mental-Spiritual: You’re
moving up in frequency, expanding your conscious-
ness through the dimensions. You want more spiritual
knowledge, the big picture, or a higher perspective on
a situation. (see above)
fog: Physical: You are invisible to others, not making
the impact you want. A situation hides some impor-
tant factors. You aren’t facing reality. Others are
obscuring the truth. Emotional: If the scene is
shrouded in fog, you feel confused, directionless, and
lost. Mental-Spiritual: You can’t see clearly and need to
explore the unconscious, unknown inner realms for
answers. If the fog lifts, pay attention to what you see.
food: (see eat)
forest: Physical: You need to retreat, achieve calm-
ness, rebuild vitality, soak up the greenness of nature.
A forest fire implies that the density of a period in
your life is finally clearing. Emotional: You feel over-
whelmed by potential dangers, the unknown, or the
uncontrollable, especially if you are lost in a forest or
flying — forest 
148

traversing one. Mental-Spiritual: You are focusing on
your subconscious, secrets, mysteries, memories, and
feminine wisdom. You’re using your intuition to find
answers.
fork in the road: (see crossroads)
fortuneteller/psychic: Physical: Your life is about to
change. Emotional: You are anxious about your future.
You’re looking at a tendency to give your authority to
others who you think know more than you. Be sure to
weigh the information you receive against your waking
common sense to make sure it isn’t fear-based.
Mental-Spiritual: You have a strong desire to discover
the unknown. Soliciting guidance from a spiritually ori-
ented source means a higher part of you is sending an
important message. 
fox: Physical: Someone is acting dishonestly or secre-
tively, or you are acting in a cunning or wily manner.
You need to remain silent, or speak in favor of diplo-
macy. Emotional: You feel manipulated or victimized
by clever, sly people. You are focusing on a woman
who is a “vixen,” or “foxy,” and whom you don’t trust.
Mental-Spiritual: You need to sharpen your mental
awareness and pay more attention to what’s going on
around you. 
frog: Physical: You need renewal, cleansing, or rebirth.
You are ready for a major change. Emotional: Because
frogs are bringers of rain and messengers of water
spirits, they indicate you are clearing your emotions,
becoming more sensitive to others, and diving deep
into your unconscious to bring truths to the surface.
Mental-Spiritual: You are focusing on metamorphosis;
the tadpole becomes the frog, the frog becomes the
forest — frog 149

handsome prince. Pay attention to messages from
frogs, and trust your growth process.
front: Physical: The front part of anything, like a front
porch or the front bumper of a car, interfaces with the
public and the world. You’re focusing on how others
see and know you, and how you portray your person-
ality to others. Emotional: You are examining how
strong or vulnerable you feel about being a leader, pio-
neer, or innovator. You feel too visible or unprepared.
Sitting in the front row means you are ready to be
involved. Mental-Spiritual: You’re focusing on what is
consciously known. If you are in front of other people,
you’re teaching or initiating; if others are in front of
you, you’re learning or following.
fruit: Physical: You need more fresh, highly nutritional
food. You are fertile and ready to have a child. You are
ripe, full of talent, and ready to express yourself or
move into a new phase. Picking ripe fruit or seeing a
bowl of fruit is an omen of prosperity and success to
come. Emotional: You feel abundant, sensual, sexual,
seductive, luscious, and tempting. Bitter, rotten, or
wormy fruit symbolizes untruthfulness, lack of trust,
or an area of self-expression that troubles you. Mental-
Spiritual: You are focusing on positive values, the
appropriate span of time for a successful process, and
the abundance within.
funeral: Physical: A situation, relationship, or aspect
of yourself has ended or needs to end. You are putting
something to rest, closing the lid on the past, letting
go, and moving into a new life phase. Emotional: You
are releasing old feelings you’ve been clinging to.
Attending the funeral of someone who is still alive
means you need to separate from restrictions you feel
frog — funeral 
150

from that person and be more independent. Mental-
Spiritual: You are examining lifeless ideas and world
views that have no relevance for you anymore. You’re
expanding beyond your known world.
furniture: Physical: You are focusing on the habits,
relationships, and the “stuff” of your daily and domes-
tic life. If you’re rearranging or moving furniture, you
are changing your routine, what you depend on, the
way you do things, or the flow of your energy.
Emotional: Décor indicates your mood. Dark, formal
fabrics and furniture mean depression or seriousness,
while lighter, contemporary furnishings indicate spon-
taneity and inventiveness. Mental-Spiritual: Old or
worn furniture symbolizes outdated attitudes and old
ways of thinking. How you use the furniture shows
your mental habits. New furniture means growth and
change.

cess in an endeavor, but not necessarily gambling.

area of your life, either mild, enlivening ones, or dra-
matic, potentially dangerous ones, looking for reward.

ability, reserves of energy, and the tools and tech-
niques you use to accomplish your goals. You are in a
period of inactivity, getting ready for new direction.
Emotional: You’re focusing on how stable and safe
your life is. The condition (messy, organized) repre-
sents the way you store and manage your inner
resources. If the garage is crammed with stuff, you feel
afraid you won’t be prepared for the many demands
of the world. Mental-Spiritual: You’re focusing on
planning, strategizing, goal setting, and maintaining
resources, things that allow you to progress. Cleaning
out the garage means you are releasing old ideas and
techniques that don’t work anymore. 
garbage: Physical: You need to detoxify or cleanse
your body. Rooting through trash indicates you still
have use for something you haven’t paid attention to
in a long time. Or, you have to do something you don’t
want to do. Emotional: You feel rejected, tossed aside,
unwanted, expendable, or distasteful. Rooting through
a stranger’s garbage shows your desire for useful, free
surprises, parts of yourself or new creative ideas.

dealing with ugly, negative thought structures in

adventure. Emotional: Your emotions have built to an

garden — ghost 153

fear. You are afraid of dying. Mental-Spiritual: You’re
focusing on desires that haven’t successfully mani-
fested, or part of yourself that has remained in the

giraffe: Physical: You need to stick your neck out or
extend yourself to succeed or find the right resources.

to focus on personal and practical issues. If the giraffe

from sudden attacks. Mental-Spiritual: You have the
ability to see different perspectives or both sides of an
issue, or you need a broader view of a situation. You
need to keep your feet firmly on the ground while
viewing the distance clearly.

between yourself, your goals, others, and the world.
Broken glass means something you thought would
last, will end surprisingly or too soon. Emotional: You
feel removed, out of touch with others, or misunder-

154

Mental-Spiritual: Seeing through clear glass or glasses
indicates revelation, insight, or a clear perspective.
Dirty glass or glasses means you have limiting beliefs
or blind spots in the way. Losing your glasses means

about shattering illusions to move through barriers. 
gloves: Physical: You or someone you know needs to
be handled with care. You need to get a better grip on
something. Your creativity or ability to touch others is
veiled in some way. Gardening or work gloves indicate
you’re ready to begin a new phase of productivity.
Driving gloves mean you’re taking control of your life
direction. Gloves that are too large mean you took on
more than you can handle. Emotional: You’re protect-
ing yourself from harm. Throwing down a glove means
you’re challenging yourself or someone else. Boxing
gloves indicate you’re ready to confront an opponent
or critic, perhaps an inner one. Mental-Spiritual:

ness. Dropping a glove means flirtation.

a project. Someone is invading your territory, leaving

dipping into your primal self and your body’s non-

cussions or humiliation later. Emotional: You’re afraid
to confront someone or share yourself openly. You feel
unfairly judged or disrespected. You feel ashamed of
the way you treated someone else. Mental-Spiritual:

You are freshening up your ideas and growing men-
tally and spiritually. You are integrating polarized
ideas or opposing forces within yourself.
gun: Physical: You’re focusing on personal power with
others, especially exerted from a safe distance, and
aggressive, sexual male energy. Emotional: You feel
pressured by a male person in your life. You need to

dent or on purpose indicates overactive, destructive,
or vengeful emotions, or a need to assert personal
control over a situation. Mental-Spiritual: Firing guns

shot, consider which part of your body has been
wounded for clues about the meaning.

down” or the wind is blowing through your hair, you
feel free to express uninhibited feelings. Stroking hair
connects to sympathy, protectiveness, and fraternal
love. Mental-Spiritual: You’re focusing on your atti-
tudes, opinions, and insights. White hair denotes
wisdom. Knotted or tangled hair shows uncertainty
and confusion. Combing your hair means you’re organ-
izing your thoughts, getting your facts straight. Long

act. Touching someone’s hair means you are trying to
connect on a spiritual or intellectual level.

one life phase to another, beginning a journey into the
unknown and further self-exploration. Emotional: If the
hall is dimly lit, you feel insecure as you move toward

touch others, grasp or take hold, make and create
things, and how you give and receive. You need to

with someone means you’ve reached an agreement, a
level of trust, or a new beginning. Emotional: Washing
your hands means you’re worried or guilty, or you’re
complete and no longer taking responsibility for some-

dealing with others. Blood on your hands means
you’ve hurt yourself or others and need to heal the sit-
uation. Being in handcuffs means you or something
else is holding you back, making you focus on your
actions. You are too possessive. Mental-Spiritual:
Hands and fingers communicate and convey many
messages, often of approval and disapproval. Praying
hands mean the left and right sides of your body and
brain are balanced and you are in harmony, open to
the spiritual realm. Clasped or covered hands mean
you’re contemplating something, or are hesitant to
agree.

your desire for power and recognition, or your respon-
sibilities in life. A feather in your hat shows achieve-
ment. A top hat denotes formality, elegance, and
aspirations for wealth. Emotional: You are concealing
or covering up something. You are hiding your opin-
ions and attitudes from others for fear of judgment.

self-image, and your perception of the world. You’re

fully you are living. The chest and breasts indicate a
focus on pride, generosity, nurturing capacity, and
how unprotected and trusting you are. Emotional:
Problems with the heart, like heartaches or heart
attacks, indicate imbalances, loss of love, lack of sup-
port and acceptance, or great disappointment. You’re
looking at how you deal with feelings and express
emotion. Hearing a heartbeat suggests you need to re-
center into safety and feelings of being nurtured. A
racing heartbeat indicates you’re anxious, upset, and
threatened about something. Mental-Spiritual: You are
focusing on integrating your soul’s wisdom into your
life, understanding who you are, how you give uncon-
ditional love, and how courageous you are. You want

hero/hero’s journey: Physical: You are asking yourself
to stretch your level of competence, be more coura-
geous and confident, and develop an expanded skill
set. Emotional: You are examining your need to rescue
others or be rescued. Mental-Spiritual: To make the
hero’s journey you must first be cut off from your
roots and misunderstood, then experience the call to
adventure to discover your true self, which comes
after a difficult rite of passage where you confront
temptation, challenges, demons, villains, handicaps,
and unresolved fear. Finally, you experience a spiritual
awakening and reach your goal. You must then return
to those who misunderstood you and enlighten them.
This is the process of spiritual growth we all go
through as we evolve. You are reminding yourself that
you’re living through a stage in the hero’s journey, and
there is an end eventually. Notice what stage you are
focusing on. 
hide: Physical: Hiding from someone means you’re
avoiding an aspect of yourself you’ve not accepted or
integrated. You don’t want to face a real situation or
issue. Emotional: You need security and protection.
Hiding from an authority figure implies feelings of
guilt. Hiding an object means you feel it’s possible to
lose part of your credibility, luck, or power to another
person and thus you need to protect or hoard it. If
someone is hiding from you, you feel frustrated in
your desire for intimacy, honesty, or self-expression
with others. Mental-Spiritual: You are keeping a secret,
withholding information, or denying the truth.

lessen your dependency on others. Picking up a hitch-
hiker means you are carrying others in some way,

the coattails of others, borrowing their ideas, not
doing your own homework. You may be possessed in
some way by discarnate beings.

horse: Physical: You are focusing on the magnificence
of your physical body, and on freedom, power, wild-
ness, pride, energy, majesty, courage, and sexuality.
The condition of the horse indicates the state of your
energy in waking life. You have been “horsing around”
and need to get serious. You need to “get off your high
horse” and be less arrogant. Galloping or racing
horses represent the drive you need to compete and
succeed. Emotional: If you are riding a horse that is
out of control, you are being carried away by your pas-
sions. An armored horse refers to fierceness, aggres-
sion, confrontation, or rigidity. Or you are repressing
sexual urges. Mental-Spiritual: Horses link to your
instinct, intuition, and prophetic ability. White or
flying horses (Pegasus) represent purity and good for-
tune, as well as a strong motivation for spiritual
growth. Black or dark horses signify mystery, occult
forces, and gambling on the unknown.

pay attention to your physical health, allow time and
space to rest, or ask others for help. Emotional: You

later. Hotel lobbies represent an environment where
ideas are coming and going, and new ideas are being
considered. 
house: Physical: A house symbolizes your personal
self, life situation, current state, and possibly your
health. A new house or a bigger house indicates
you’ve entered a new expanded phase. If the house is
too small or cluttered, you are finding motivation to
begin to change. Emotional: A childhood home repre-
sents emotions, attitudes, and behaviors, created
when you lived in that residence, that need to be
changed now. If the house is empty, you feel insecure
and isolated, or you need to develop more independ-
ence. A haunted house means unfinished emotional
business related to family, dead relatives, or repressed
feelings. A burglarized house means you feel vulnera-
ble or violated, or unconscious knowledge is trying to
make itself known. Mental-Spiritual: If the house is
under construction and not yet complete, or if it needs
repair, you are doing inner psychological work, getting
ready for a growth spurt. Cleaning house means you’re
clearing old thoughts, seeking self-improvement.
Specific rooms in the house indicate specific aspects
of your psyche. (see architecture)

to others. You need to find the beauty and good inside
yourself and others, going deep, beyond the outer
layers. Mental-Spiritual: You are focusing on how to
live in the present moment and maintain inner still-
ness while in action. Small ideas and concepts possess
much power. You are trying to shift away from having
flighty thoughts and frivolous ideas. Hummingbird is a

high spiritual levels. 
hurricane/tornado/storm: Physical: You are experi-
encing sudden changes or a clearing of old structures,
like changing jobs suddenly or needing to move.

destructive and powerful emotions, like rage with
ensuing chaos and confusion, are beginning to release.
Mental-Spiritual: Being in the eye of the storm symbol-
izes the still, calm center within yourself where you

swept up in the storm, you are experiencing intensely
confusing thoughts and are consumed by overwhelm-
ing conditions.
I
ice/icicles/iceberg: Physical: You are making slow

ice, you are taking risks, sensing potential danger or

hopeless, emotionally paralyzed or blocked, or unable
to express your feelings due to an unsympathetic envi-
ronment. If you fall through ice, you are about to have
hummingbird — ice/icicles/iceberg 
166

an emotional breakthrough where suppressed feelings
come to the surface. Melting ice indicates an easing of
emotional problems and difficult times. Icicles repre-
sent sadness and emotional pain that started to
release but became blocked again. An iceberg repre-
sents a huge emotional obstacle you need to face, or
its hidden aspects might destroy you. Mental-Spiritual:
Your ideas and creativity are blocked, or you feel
numb and brain-dead. 
infestation/insects: Physical: Something or someone is
bugging you, or making a pest of itself. You are dealing
with minor annoyances and small obstacles that must
not be ignored. Emotional: You are worrying exces-
sively or feel irritated. If the insects bite or sting,
you are afraid of being wounded by sharp words.
Infestations, whether by people, animals, insects,
bacteria, or clutter, represent feeling invaded, over-
whelmed, overrun, and undermined. Strengthen your
boundaries. Look to the location of the infestation for
the area of life it’s affecting. Be more assertive and
take up your own space. Mental-Spiritual: You are
neglecting important information because of an obses-
sion with one thing. You need to organize your
thoughts and sort through your priorities. Insects rep-

about others and life. You are looking into the true
nature of things.

Specific jewels are indicative of different kinds of heal-
ing and specific qualities you need to activate in
yourself. Emotional: Jewelry you own symbolizes par-

through a two-way mirror, you’re seeing the hidden
dynamics of an issue that concerns you. 
money: Physical: You’re focusing on your intrinsic
value, inner abundance, confidence, self-worth, and
success. You’re looking at your energy level. Winning
money means that success and prosperity can easily
manifest for you. Losing money indicates depleted
inner resources, temporary setbacks, or the need to
be more detached concerning outcomes. Investing
money in the stock market means you have faith in
your own talent and potential. Emotional: Having inad-
equate money denotes fear of losing status, or being
unprepared, weak, passive, out of control, and power-
less. To be underpaid or not rewarded monetarily
means you feel ignored, neglected, undervalued, and
unloved. Hoarding money means you’re focusing on
what you don’t have; you are worrying about debt,
unemployment, or negative cash flow in waking life.
Stealing money or having money stolen, means you
need to let go and trust that you’ll have what you
need. You feel envy toward fortunate people, as
though you are being unfairly deprived. You need to
reach toward the things you value and feel entitled.

and values concerning provision, deservedness, and

for what you have and expect improved circumstances.

are plagued by negative or obsessive thoughts. You’re

into your totality, thus achieving psychological com-
pletion and wholeness.

tuates constantly. You’re focusing on feminine energy

your goals, are successful, and now have a new view of
your life. Emotional: You are avoiding hard work and

tions and annoyances, or problems with insincere,

character you’re drawn to represents an element of
life you are preparing to embody. Emotional: You want
to escape from the reality of your own life or protect

your life purpose and plan. (see DVD)

situation, problem, or relationship. You need to
cleanse your body internally. If your face or clothes

bolizes stirred-up emotions that affect your success.
You feel weighed down or depressed. You are too per-

terns in your awareness to incorporate increased har-
mony, joy, and sensitivity. You’re using your intuition.

a facade. You’re trying to be something you’re not.

ful, quarrelsome nature. A beautiful neck indicates a
graceful, sensitive nature. Mental-Spiritual: You’re
focusing on finding your voice, communicating easily,
and having faith in yourself and others. You’re looking

nose: Physical: You are being curious or perhaps too
“nosy,” meddlesome, interfering, or pushy. Emotional:
If your nose is stuffed up, broken, out of joint, or
bleeding, you have invaded someone else’s reality and
been rebuffed, or you haven’t been trusting your intu-
ition and higher sensitivity. Mental-Spiritual: You need

and instinct to avoid danger and find your way. You

great detail a situation in your waking life. You are
solving a problem, finding a new approach. You are
focusing on multiplicity, relative size, or a multifaceted
process. Specific numbers represent different aspects
of your personality, ways of doing things, stages of
your growth process and the creation cycle, and time
periods. You’re giving yourself coded guidance about
how to proceed. A date on a calendar, street address,
phone number, number of objects, or a number super-
imposed over a scene, all indicate important clues.
Emotional: You need to be careful about being overly
emotional, or conversely, too rational. You have emo-
tional associations with the numbers you see: a year
of your life, date of an important event, how many chil-
dren you have, or a lucky number. Mental-Spiritual:
You’re attuning to spiritual understanding, large pat-
terns of consciousness, and archetypal human quali-
ties. In complex numbers, examine each of the single
digits, add them together until you have one digit.

true colors. Mental-Spiritual: You are going through a
specific rite of passage, or remembering one from your
past. You’re aligning your ideas and life direction with

doesn’t move. Emotional: You feel dominated, power-
less, depressed, unable to express yourself freely or

scious fear. If you associate paralysis with aliens or
evil forces from the underworld, it means you feel vul-
nerable and need to strengthen your core sense of self
and your boundaries. Mental-Spiritual: You’ve reached
an impasse where your beliefs and world view no
longer serve your growth. You need to attune to the

facing, understanding, and releasing frozen emotions

plish things: “I can sink my teeth into it,” or I’ve “bitten
off more than I can chew.” Loose teeth or losing your

you are speaking with a “forked tongue,” lying, “tongue
in cheek,” joking, a “silver tongue” charming, or giving

on how you communicate and use speech. A wagging,
loose tongue means you’re gossiping, talking too
much, or being talked about. Emotional: Having to bite
or hold your tongue means you feel silenced, judged,
and limited in your self-expression. Ripping someone’s
tongue out means you are extremely angry with some-
thing the person has said. Mental-Spiritual: Having
your tongue cut out indicates you need to be silent
and listen, watch what thoughts you’ve been voicing,
and find new ways to express yourself. (see mouth)

spiritual growth, and you benefit from the work and
experience of your family lineage. Life has more mean-
ing and is richer.

and save for a rainy day. If you’re carrying an
umbrella, you are focusing on being prepared, safe,

of the genitals. You feel put down or fouled, as though
someone is “pissing on” your work or character.
Mental-Spiritual: You’re experiencing a release of ten-
sion and worry. Ideas that have served their purpose
need to be eliminated.

your journey and choosing your direction. Emotional:

Hearing a literal voice speaking to you means an
important message is coming from your soul or spiri-
tual guides. You might hear a single word, a phrase, an

your life, or what you expect. Emotional: Being outside

intuition and healing, and connecting to a deep under-
standing of the universal laws. (see monster)

been seduced. You are afraid of aggressive, lustful,

seasons of life and death, and the deep wisdom of
group relations. You are connecting with a spiritual

Part III 
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
P
art III provides a little “dream dessert.”
In these pages, you can find ten useful
techniques for exploring dream messages
and ten of the most common dreams and their
meanings.

Chapter 6
Ten Techniques for Exploring
Dream Messages
D
reams are little realities that are entirely fluid, intu-
itive, and responsive to a change of thought or
intent. This means you can play with their form to dis-
cover insights, and not feel as locked in or helpless as
you might in everyday life. You can expand the scope of
a dream, change the action, bring in imaginary helpers,
talk to an imaginary dream expert, or use a creative
process to find hidden connections between symbols.
In this chapter, you can explore ten helpful methods for
finding the messages in your dreams.
Back Up and Extend a Dream
1. Pick a dream with clear images, where you
remember the beginning, middle, and end.
In your imagination, run through the dream.
Familiarize yourself with the symbols, feelings,
actions, and characters.
2. Return to the beginning and instead of run-
ning it as is a second time, imagine you’re
backing it up so you can see what happened

just before the dream began. Make a note of
the predream activity. Replay it from the new
starting point to where it stopped before.
3. Keep playing the dream past its normal end-
point. See what happens next. Use the new
insights about causes and outcomes to help
you find the deeper messages in your dream.
Add an Extra Character 
1. Pick any dream, but a frustrating or frighten-
ing one works especially well. Review the
beginning, middle, and end, remembering the
feelings, symbols, and actions.
2. Just at the point where you get frustrated or
terrified, introduce a new character into the
dream. Let your imagination invent someone,
and continue the dream with the intervention
and help of the new person, entity, or animal.
What happens next? How does the dream
resolve?
3. How does the new character represent a
new part of you that might want to be acti-
vated? What is the lesson your soul is trying
to teach you?
Expand the Scope of the 
Dream Environment 
1. Enter your dream and review it from begin-
ning to end. Then go back to any point where
Part III: The Part of Tens 
270

you are centered in a location, inside or out-
side. Slow the speed way down or freeze-frame
the action. Now look around. What direction
are you facing: east, south, west, or north?
What’s to the left, right, and behind you?
Where’s the light coming from? Are there other
people nearby you didn’t notice before? If
you’re inside, go outside. If you’re outside and
there’s a house or vehicle, go in. Try zooming
up in the air and see the lay of the land. What’s
just beyond the horizon?
2. Notice what extra information you receive.
How does that data help you understand the
dream process and message? You can repeat
the process with other dream locations within
the same dream and see how the expanded
knowledge helps the pieces fit together.
Dialogue with Symbols 
or Dream Characters
1. Create an imaginary dialogue with a dream
character. The conversation can be between
you and the character, or between two charac-
ters. Have the characters ask each other
questions. Why are you here? What’s your
complaint or biggest problem? What are you
good at doing? How are you supposed to help
me? How can I help you? What do you want
to do next?
2. Create an imaginary dialogue with a dream
symbol. Focus attention on a symbol, give
your energy to it, and let it give its energy to
Chapter 6: Ten Techniques for Exploring Dream Messages 271

you. Enter and merge with the symbol, become
it, then speak directly in first person about
what you represent, what your expertise is,
and why you appeared at this time. Describe
how you feel and why. What do you need help
with? What is your message?
Face Your Monsters and 
Take Your Power Back
1. If you’re being chased or threatened by a
dream monster, wild animal, serial killer,
science fiction character, or violent family
member or ex-spouse, you can turn things
around quickly. Review the dream later in a
meditation, moving to the point where the anxi-
ety reaches its crescendo, and you feel the most
helpless and panic-stricken. In the meditation,
stop running or acting like a victim. Turn and
face your pursuer. Pull out an imaginary
weapon that is more powerful than your oppo-
nent. Ask: Why are you chasing me? What do
you want from me? What do you need to tell
me? See what the character says. If the scene
wants to progress into a dialogue, let it. You
might demand of it: Give me a present!
2. Once the tension resolves and you find
understanding, let the image of the “oppo-
nent” melt and dissolve. As it does, the
energy that was in it flows back into you and
you become stronger, more confident, and full
of yourself.
Part III: The Part of Tens 
272

Make Quick Associations
1. For each symbol, write a string of associated
words, as fast as you can, without reading
back over the list. For instance, if the symbol
were camera, you might write: lens, shutter,
film, eye, click, blink, view, zoom, look, pic-
tures, color, format. 
2. Then write a series of words or phrases that
convey emotions or a feeling-state you associ-
ate with that symbol, such as, private view,
enjoy, preserving a moment, being close to
people and landscapes, magical images,
loving details, perfect framing.
3. From the new associations and meanings, see
what insights are freed from your subcon-
scious, and what feels real and useful when
connected to a process in your waking life.
Redream and Change Your
Dream’s Outcome
1. If you have a troubling dream (someone
steals your car, you plant a garden and it
dies, you flub a speech in front of a thousand
people), you can go back later in a medita-
tion and re-dream it. Simply sit quietly and
bring the dream to mind, review it, and reenter
it. At the point where things start to go awry,
shift the plot. The thief is about to hotwire
your car and a loud squealing alarm goes off,
Chapter 6: Ten Techniques for Exploring Dream Messages 273

attracting the attention of neighbors or
passersby, scaring the thief away. Your garden
is planted, and just as it begins to wilt, you
spray magic fairy dust over the whole thing,
and it starts to glow with extra light. You are
struggling with your speech and you see the
Dalai Lama sitting in the front row, smiling and
nodding encouragement, and you immediately
relax and become eloquent and funny.
2. After changing your dream so it flows to a
new conclusion, which may surprise you,
notice what you’ve been trying to show your-
self about a real issue in your life and what
you’re capable of doing.
Invite a Hero or Expert 
to Give You Insights 
1. Imagine yourself sitting casually at a side-
walk cafe. Get the feeling that you’d really like
to talk to an “expert” about what your dream
means. Suddenly, someone slips from the
crowd and sits down at your table. He or she
says, “I’m sorry I’m late for our appointment.
I got word you wanted to talk to me. I’m
____________________________. How can I
help you?”
2. Notice his or her face, eyes, clothes, the
energy of his body, the feel of his maturity,
the light coming from him. Explain your
dream and let him tell you what the parts of
the dream mean, what’s going on inside you,
Part III: The Part of Tens 
274

and what you need to do next. Allow the ex-
perience to unfold spontaneously. When it’s
finished, thank him, come back, and record
what happened.
3. Why did that particular person appear to
you? Is there a symbolic meaning? Does he or
she have a quality you want to activate in
yourself?
Write a Story, Fable, or Poem
from a Dream
1. Write a children’s story or fable based on
your dream. This is especially fun to do with a
child or a friend. Or, role-play your own inner
five-year-old, or 100-year-old self, and alternate
between yourself and your role. First tell your
dream or a single dream scene. Then let the
other person or your pretend self add a made-
up scene. Then you add more. Keep going this
way until it comes to a natural end. If you get
stuck, ask yourself, What else could have hap-
pened at this point? The next day you might
take the dream you had that night, add it to
the end of the storyline, and continue the
process. You might actually make a blank book
by folding sheets of paper and stapling them
together. Then write and illustrate the dream
story, and finally, create a title for it. 
2. Every dream can be written as a poem. You
can excerpt powerful pieces of the dream and
turn them into three-line haikus. Write a poem
Chapter 6: Ten Techniques for Exploring Dream Messages 275

around a list of words from your dream, or
draw a picture of your dream. Then make lists
of word pairs from the dream (red mountain,
spiral cloud, rushing mud) and write a poem
using those phrases tied together in a mean-
ingful way. Your intuitive poetic voice often
interprets the symbols naturally as you write.
You might try writing your dreams in both nar-
rative form and poetic form side by side in
your dream diary. 
Make a Dream Collage 
1. Cut up old magazines and save pictures of
wild animals, cars, airplanes, monsters, flow-
ers, trees, toys, dolls, dogs, cats, birds, fish,
foods, kids doing different things, old people,
adults in sunglasses, mountains, lakes, back-
yards, bedrooms, shoes, and sky. Paste
images that connect to your dream on a big
sheet of paper, overlapping them or making
connections between images, perhaps doing
some pencil drawings of the dream alongside.
You’ll find the dream expands as you add
related images and meanings. As the dream
collage grows in complexity, tell yourself the
new story that’s taking shape. 
2. When you’re finished, write the complete
story from beginning to end on the back of
the collage or in your dream diary. What is
the hidden message? What guidance do you
receive from your inner voice?
Part III: The Part of Tens 
276

There are 700 references to dreams in the Bible. The
longest recorded dream is three hours and eight minutes.
The tune for “Yesterday” came to Paul McCartney in a
dream. He heard a classical string ensemble playing, and
said: “I woke up with a lovely tune in my head.” Golfer
Jack Nicklaus found a new way to hold his golf club in a
dream, which he credits with improving his golf game.

Chapter 7
Ten Common Dreams
and Their Meanings
You’ve probably experienced one of these ten
common types of dreams in your life; they focus
on themes universal to most of us. Under these
dreams are emotions we all share that preoccupy us,
but that we don’t especially like to deal with con-
sciously. By working with the inner messages in
common dreams, you can maximize your confidence,
creativity, and effectiveness in waking life.
My Teeth Are Falling Out!
It’s especially popular now to have gleaming white,
movie-star teeth, so if your teeth are dirty, diseased,
disintegrating, or falling out in your dreams, you’re
probably worrying about how pleasing and attractive
you are to others and to sexual and romantic partners.
You may be afraid of getting old. Teeth also relate to
self-expression and effective communication, so losing
teeth can mean you’re embarrassed about something
you’ve said, or you’re having trouble saying what you
really mean. The real essence of teeth is their ability to
bite through, to cut, tear, and grind. As human animals,

you retain a vestige of snarling — showing teeth as a
“stay back” warning — in our disarming smile. If your
teeth fall out, you lose personal power and your abil-
ity to be assertive, decisive, and self-protective. 
You might ask yourself: Where do I lack confidence or
feel powerless? With whom do I feel self-conscious or
insecure? How am I angry or frustrated? Where should
I take action to “bite through” something, or chew
something thoroughly so I understand it? 
I’m Naked in Public! 
You’re going about your business and suddenly realize
you’re naked or in your underwear at work or at the
grocery store. Exposure dreams bring to light the
things you don’t want others to know about you and
places where you feel vulnerable. Suddenly everyone
sees through you. Being naked in front of others also
implies being caught off guard or being unprepared,
uninformed, uneducated, or unpracticed. 
Try asking yourself: What have I been hiding? Where
do I feel like a phony? What’s wrong with being seen
for whom I really am? Where do I feel invisible? Can I
tolerate, or even love, my imperfections? Who am I
afraid will reject me? What am I telling myself I need to
be prepared for — for my own sake?
A Monster Is Chasing Me!
You’re running, trying to outpace or outwit your pur-
suer, and he/she/it’s gaining on you! Suddenly your
Part III: The Part of Tens 
280

legs are paralyzed! Chase dreams often represent fears
of facing up to something you’ve judged negatively,
like your own rage, shame, or irresponsibility, for
example. Or, you may feel threatened by someone or
by a possible failure. If you become paralyzed, you
probably need to stand still and meet your pursuer to
receive an important message. Or, you may be experi-
encing the normal “paralysis” that occurs in the REM
(rapid eye movement) sleep state. 
Try asking yourself: What do I feel threatened by?
What am I avoiding? Who have I given my power to?
Where have I surrendered my right to “take up space”?
Where do I feel helpless or unsupported? How do I
deal with conflict? 
I’m in My Childhood Home; 
It Has New Rooms!
Houses are symbols of the self, so returning to an old
house means you are looking back at an old way of
being, past habits, identities you’ve held, and out-
dated concepts you’ve been operating from. Perhaps
you need to bring repressed memories to the surface
to be healed. Trying to live in an old house that might
be too small for you now, or seeing things that need
repair, means you’re becoming conscious of how
much you’ve grown and what you’re renovating in
yourself. When your old house has new rooms, you’ve
added new talents, experiences, people, and compo-
nents to your life. 
Chapter 7: Ten Common Dreams and Their Meanings 281

You might ask yourself: What parts of my house
need refurbishing? Am I comfortable in this space?
Which room is my favorite? What do the new rooms
symbolize?
I’m Making Love with 
a Movie Star! 
Sex dreams are often about merging several aspects of
yourself together, or loving a part of yourself you’ve
judged or rejected. Sex with a celebrity can mean you
want more visibility, self-worth, and recognition, or
you are activating qualities in yourself represented by
the famous person. Sex with an authority figure like a
professor, doctor, or boss, can show how it feels to
have greater power and knowledge so you can be
more effective in the world. Sex with a foreigner or
someone of another race might mean you are integrat-
ing the character traits of that culture or racial con-
sciousness into your personality. Sex with someone of
your own gender may simply show you how to better
accept and love yourself. 
You might ask yourself: What quality or experience am
I activating in myself? What do I admire about this
lover that is a key to a new ability of mine?
I Lost My Wallet and Keys! 
Dreams of loss point to areas where you are too
attached to something; you are telling yourself, “Let go
and see what comes next when you don’t have it all
Part III: The Part of Tens 
282

locked down.” Losing your wallet can indicate it’s time
to reexamine your identity. Losing your car may mean
you need to look at your need for movement, freedom,
and independence as you’ve defined it. Losing keys
points to a fear of losing authority or access to an
opportunity. Losing money can mean you’re letting go
of what’s been valuable to you so you can revalue
your core self. 
Ask yourself: How have I outgrown ideas of who I am?
Where do I need to let go and trust the unknown part
of myself to provide for me? Where do I need to ex-
perience space and emptiness instead of clutter?
I’m Taking a Test 
and Didn’t Study!
You have an exam and can’t find the room, you are
late, or haven’t studied. You’re in a play and forgot
your lines. Performance anxiety dreams point to areas
in your life where you feel judged by others or unpre-
pared for a challenge. You fear if you don’t do well,
you’ll be rejected and ridiculed. If the setting is aca-
demic, you probably need to pay attention to new
knowledge or to a lesson that’s part of your personal
growth process. If it’s a play or a keynote lecture, you
may be ready to express yourself more fully, to be
more articulate and confident in the world. 
You might ask yourself: What new opportunity do I
want but don’t feel ready for? How could I feel ade-
quately prepared? How do I feel I might let others
down? Who has expectations of me and who am I
afraid of not pleasing? 
Chapter 7: Ten Common Dreams and Their Meanings 283

I Found Money or Jewels!
Dreams about finding valuables operate on several
levels. You may be awash in debt, fear that you’ll
never have enough, or that you’ll lose what you have.
You want to feel lucky, abundant, influential, and rich,
so you try it out in your dreams. Under these worries
often lurks a deeper fear — that you don’t deserve to
be loved, supported, or cared for. Your deep self is
showing you what it feels like to be blessed. Gaining
money or valuables really means you’re gaining in
emotional well-being, confidence, and power. You may
be preparing to increase your creativity and abun-
dance level, to feel that having more is normal.
Try asking yourself: Who gave me the money or valu-
ables? What or who does this person represent to me?
Where did I find the valuables and what do the place
and kind of item represent to me? What’s my attitude
as I receive: greedy, worried, egocentric? How do I act
after I’ve received: powerful, generous, relaxed? 
I’m Having Surgery on My Eyes,
Brain, Heart, or . . . !
Hospital and surgery dreams are often symbolic of a
fundamental change you’re making in the way you live,
the way you work with energy and run your body, and
how you construct your identity and world view. On
rare occasions, they are warnings about actual health
problems, or they indicate you’re exhausted and need
Part III: The Part of Tens 
284

to rest and be cared for so you can shift to a new
phase of self-expression. You may need to get some-
thing out of your system, change your habits, move to
a new location, or release a person from your life. You
may need to open yourself to emotional healing and
new experiences. If you experience anesthesia in the
dream, you’re probably avoiding your feelings, wor-
ries, or responsibilities. If you’re bleeding profusely in
the dream or feel actual pain, you are telling your con-
scious mind that part of you feels out of control,
severely drained, and mortally wounded by trauma
or cruelty.
Try asking yourself: What or who has caused me to
feel so wounded and helpless? Why am I focusing on
this particular area of my body? What are the sur-
geons doing to help me? Is there a change occurring in
my subtle energy body? After I heal, what will I be
capable of doing? How is the pattern of my awareness
changing?
My Car Won’t Stop or Go!
“Difficulty with your vehicle” dreams usually arise
when events in your waking life seem out of control,
you feel powerless over something, or are afraid you’re
about to fail or “crash.” Your car is rolling backwards,
the brakes won’t work, you’re trying to steer from the
back seat, the tires are flat, the ignition doesn’t catch.
Vehicles are symbols for the way you move through
experiences in your life. Cars, motorcycles, bicycles,
buses, or trains represent physical experience and
Chapter 7: Ten Common Dreams and Their Meanings 285

your body; boats signify emotional experience; planes
connect you to mental experience; and rockets and
UFOs represent spiritual levels.
Once you see what level of yourself you’re focusing on,
determine whether you are the driver or passenger.
This shows how you feel about being able to direct
your own life. Driving from the back seat means you
need to step up and be more responsible. Someone
else driving means you’ve given your authority away.
Next, look at how the vehicle is functioning. Problems
indicate problems you may have in real life. The steer-
ing or brakes don’t work: you’re going too fast and are
about to make a big mistake. The tires on the right
side are flat: you’re afraid to move forward and take
new actions. The starter won’t work: you need to
renew your motivation and passion.
Try asking yourself: In what area do I feel disabled or
powerless? Who did I give power to? How am I out of
control? What in my life needs to work properly? What
can I do to move freely?

Appendix
Dream Diary Writing Prompts
A
s an extension of your dream diary practice, I
want to give you some additional writing ideas to
prompt informative, insightful responses from your
deeper self. Asking the right questions can be very
powerful, especially if you remain neutral and recep-
tive and allow your intuitive voice to answer sponta-
neously. The responses you receive can open and
refine your dreamwork process and intuition.
Motivating Yourself
1. Start with the following phrases and write
several paragraphs on each until you feel fin-
ished. You might want to repeat the phrase
several times as you write to maintain a fresh
connection with your source. 
If I could remember what I do in my dreams,
I’d . . .
If I knew my dream activities were real, it
would change my experience of myself
because . . .

If I knew I could try anything in my dreams
and not get hurt, it would encourage me 
to . . .
2. Write from your body’s point of view, in first
person (starting with “I . . .”), about why
you’re not remembering your dreams as well
as you might. What are your body’s recom-
mendations for increasing your dream life?

each one ten times:
If I could know anything in my dreams, I’d
like to know . . .
If I could go anywhere in my dreams, I’d like
to visit . . .
If I could meet anyone in my dreams, I’d like
to get to know . . .
If I could create or invent anything in my
dreams I’d like to create . . .
If I could avoid dreaming about a particular
subject, it would be . . .
4. On a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the
highest or best, rate the following abilities:
Your ability to be consistently 
enthusiastic
Your ability to be calm and centered 
Your stress and anxiety level
Your level of depression or apathy
Dream Dictionary For Dummies

Your energy level in the early morning,
the late morning, the early afternoon, the
late afternoon, the early evening, the late
evening
Afterward, write about how these factors
affect your attitude about dreams and your
ability to dream.
5. Write about your specific dream goals for the
week. As you write, notice which one or two
appeal to you the most.
6. Write about your “innocent expectations”
in life. What do you assume will come to you
effortlessly? What do you expect you will
never attain, and what do you expect to be
difficult? How might these expectations affect
your dream life?
7. Describe your ideal bedroom in detail. What
would you do in your ideal bedroom? How
would it feel to dream there?
Remembering Your Dreams
1. Write about the animals you consider to be
your allies, especially those you could imag-

will work specifically for you.
Appendix: Dream Diary Writing Prompts 289

3. Meditate for ten minutes and write about the
process you experience. The process could
be anything and different each time you do it.
How did it feel to your body? What happened
to your emotions? What images did you
notice? How long could you maintain it? How
did you feel afterward? Could you recall any
fleeting dream images?
4. Pick three well-known people or characters
from books, from any time in history, who
you think could help you with your dreams.
Write about what each person would do for
you and how they’d do it.
Energizing Your Dream Diary
1. Describe a collage of images you might
assemble to decorate the cover of your
dream diary. What goes next to what?
2. List ten reasons why you can’t possibly do a
daily writing practice — then list ten ways
you could.
3. Write a paragraph completing each of the
following: 
If I were Picasso, my dream journal would
be filled with dreams about and would look
like . . .
If I were Mother Teresa, my dream journal
would be filled with dreams about and
would look like . . .

If I were George Burns, my dream journal
would be filled with dreams about and
would look like . . .
If I were Amelia Earhardt, my dream journal
would be filled with dreams about and
would look like . . .
Enhancing Your 24-hour
Awareness
1. Write about your process of falling asleep.
Describe the bodily sensations you experi-
ence. Do you have sleep disturbances during
the night? What happens to your body then?
Describe your experience of waking up and
how you could refine the process.
2. Write a pre-sleep prayer asking for help
remembering and recording your dreams
and aligning with your own higher dimen-
sions, your soul, and the divine. Then write a
blessing to say after your prayer, one that
addresses your desire to help those you love,
or people who are in need in the world.
3. If I were fully conscious 24 hours a day, I’d
feel capable of . . . (repeat ten times)
4. Write an imaginary account of your journey
into dreamland. Pretend that you can remem-
ber every detail of what you’re doing from the
moment you close your eyes until you open
them again. Don’t allow any blank spots.

your dreams may have carried over and
affected what you subsequently did in your
daily life.

dimension (such as, someone’s death) inter-
rupted your ability to concentrate while you
were awake. 
10. Notice the times today or recently that you
“left your body” and blanked out. Write
about what triggered you to leave.
Sorting through Love and Fear
1. Make notes next to all the dreams you’ve
remembered this week. How many are
primarily love-based? How many primarily
fear-based?
2. Using stream of consciousness — writing
whatever comes into your mind — make up

three superconscious or love-based dreams,
writing nonstop without rereading. Take five
minutes to do each.
3. Using stream of consciousness, make up
three subconscious or fear-based dreams,
writing nonstop without rereading. Take five
minutes to do each.

scious symbols and actions in your dreams
from the past week.What might each signify?
Write about how each might relate to your
daily life.
5. Write about what you label this week as
“good,” desirable, or pleasing — write about
what you label this week as “bad,” undesir-
able, or upsetting. Why do you hold these
judgments?
6. Pick a “bad” dream, think back through your
life to earlier similar episodes, and write
about as many as you can, and then pick a
“good” dream, think back through your life
to earlier similar episodes, and write about
as many as you can. 
7. Transform a nightmare into a useful dream
and write about what you needed to do to
shift the outcome and the insights that came
as a result.
8. Looking back at your dreams and waking
experiences for the past few weeks, write
about what your soul is trying to do to
help you.
Appendix: Dream Diary Writing Prompts 293

9. List five “shoulds” that affect
The way you act with other people.
How you progress in life and attain success.
How you view yourself.
Write about the negative consequences that
your subconscious thinks underlie each of
your “shoulds.” For example: I should be quiet.
If I’m too loud, people will think I’m selfish and
reject me.
Programming Your Dreams
1. Make a list of five problems you’d like to
solve, or questions you’d like insight about.
Pick the most important one and program a
dream to help you with it. Write about the
response you get. If you don’t receive a dream,
make one up with stream of consciousness
writing. 
2. Loosen your “question-answer” imagination
by pretending to be your body giving you
advice. Write spontaneously about:
If I were my body, giving me a dream about
how to heal my (backache, carpal tunnel
syndrome, insomnia, and so on), I’d project
the following images . . . 
If I were my body, giving me a dream about
what I want to eat and don’t want to eat, I’d
project the following images . . .

3. Write out a detailed description of how you
see yourself optimally expressing a new skill,
and program a dream to practice the skill.

dancer, architect, musician) with no creative
blocks, and write a stream of consciousness
dream sequence involving your creative
genius as if you are them. What do you learn
about the creative process?
Interpreting Waking Dreams
1. Make a list of ten images from daily life that
stand out to you. What might each of them
mean if they occurred in a dream?
2. Make a list of the signs or waking dreams
you notice for one week, and write about the
underlying themes and the connecting
threads. Now relate those themes to the
themes you notice in your sleep dreams
for the same period of time.
3. Make a list of the subtle signs or signals you
notice in one day, and write about the under-
lying messages.
4. Write several paragraphs describing a time
your body acted directly from instinct and
led you to discover something interesting.
Appendix: Dream Diary Writing Prompts 295

5. Write several paragraphs about a time a sign
or waking dream connected meaningfully to
your future.
6. Write about how you are either ahead of
yourself (in the future) or running behind (in
the past). What prompts you to go forward or
backward in time? Write about what you might
be avoiding, the seeming benefits of being else-
where, and what happens when you bring your
entire awareness into the present moment.
7. Write several paragraphs about your recent
experiences of synchronicity. What were you
bringing to your attention?
8. Try to catch as many of your daydreams, fan-
tasies, preoccupations, and flashes of insight
today as possible, and record them in your
diary, writing about what conversation is
going on inside yourself under the surface.
Interpreting Sleep Dreams
1. Scan through your dreams and make a list of
scenes where you experienced fear, worry,
or anxiety, and then list scenes where you
felt uplifted, excited, or inspired. Write in first
person as your soul about each scene, such as,
“I caused myself to experience this so that . . .”
2. Pick a dream, center yourself, and ask your
body to write about what it knows about the
core purpose of the dream. Let yourself write
in a stream of consciousness, without editing
or rereading. Begin by writing: The core
Dream Dictionary For Dummies 
296

purpose of this dream is to show myself . . . . I
chose the symbol of the <blank>because to me
it represents <blank>. Let yourself write, word
by word, until you feel complete.
3. Examine your recent dreams and notice their
structure. Have you dreamed predominantly in
fragments? Have they been epic movies? Were
they composed of two, three, or four scenes?
Write about why you like the style of your
dreams. What does one powerful fragment give
you that a longer dream might not? Why does
your subconscious like to have a beginning,
middle, and end?
4. Write about what one of your dreams means,
as though you are (Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung,
Buddha, Jesus, your grandmother, your inner
five year old, whoever).
5. Pick a dream, go back through it in your
imagination and while you’re in it, look to
the left, to the right, look behind you, and
write about what you see.
6. Pick a dream where you woke before the
action was complete, or where an action
taken by a character was ineffectual, and
write about why your subconscious caused
the flow to be interrupted.
7. Review your dreams and make a list of all
the statements, directives, specific questions,
or literal words or phrases you saw or heard
in the dreams. As you see them now, grouped
together, out of context, write about the
impressions you have about what you’re really
telling yourself.
Appendix: Dream Diary Writing Prompts 297

8. Examine your recent dreams for puns, exag-
gerations, and opposite meanings, and write
about the hidden meanings you find.
9. Go through your dream diary and pick three
dreams, and then write your opinions and
judgments about what occurs in each. See
how those statements show you about your
deeper self.
Working with Symbols
1. Make a list of the symbols in your dreams
from the past week, and write about how
each might relate to your physical and emo-
tional life right now.
2. List five symbols from your dreams this
week. Write out the vertical path of their
essential meaning; then the horizontal path of
their associative meanings.
3. Pick five colors, other than the seven standard
rainbow colors (pick, for example, turquoise,
chartreuse, olive green), and enter the experi-
ence of what each one represents. Write about
your body’s primal responses. What emotions
do you feel? What impressions do you receive?
What happens to your mental clarity with each?
What does each color “know about”?
4. If the numbers of your home address
appeared on a house in your dream, what
would they mean? Write about the qualities
Dream Dictionary For Dummies 
298

your home is activating in you based on the
archetypal meanings of the numerals.
5. List the people in your nuclear family, includ-
ing grandparents, aunts and uncles, and
cousins. For each one, decide: What color
would symbolize them? What kind of food
would symbolize them? What other odd
symbol pops to mind for each?
6. Draw a symbol that represents
The essence of your creativity.
Your future success.
Your personal truth.
Your current health.
Something from your shadow self.
7. Write a paragraph about what your full name
means. What characteristics, sensations, and
emotions does it elicit? What impressions
might it give others?
8. Pick three to five symbols from one dream
and write directly as each one, then write
directly about their interrelationships with
each other.
9. Pick three dream fragments and write out
an interview with your dream self about
each one. 
10. Pay attention to the cliches and puns you
hear this week, and write them in your diary,
exploring the underlying meaning of each.
Appendix: Dream Diary Writing Prompts 299

Empowering Your “Life Dream”
1. Pick three dreams from your diary and write
about what has happened to you since you
dreamed each one, placing special emphasis
on insights, ideas, experiences, and even
other dreams that tie in thematically. How
has your understanding of the dream meaning
deepened over time?
2. Pick three dreams and determine the mes-
sage, and then decide what actions you
are going to take to integrate the dream’s
advice — then, act! Write about what happens.
3. Go through your dream diary with an eye to
finding the life lessons peppered through
your recent dreams. Make a list of the themes
and specific issues you’re working on.
4. Examine your dreams for the personality
traits of the various dream characters. If each
trait is something you might want to activate
or balance within yourself, how would doing
this help you learn a life lesson?
5. Make up a life-work vision for yourself that
has the elements of a mission or a calling.
Totally blue-sky it and don’t listen to your
inner skeptic. How much do you think you’re
capable of doing?
6. Examine your dreams to see what they are
telling you about your life dream. Have they
been indicating a new direction, or new goals? 
Dream Dictionary For Dummies 
300

7. Scan through your diary and write about the
types of decision-making dreams you’ve had.
How have they given you direction, and about
what issues?
8. Write about your life dream as extensively as
you can. Then write about your desires and
things you want to do after you’ve felt the real-
ity of your life dream. List the actions you
could take to bring that reality closer to you
physically.
9. Look through your dream diary and make a
list of ten dream characters you had relation-
ships with. For each, write about what your
dream self was showing you concerning how
to relate more successfully.
10. List ten people or animals you have relation-
ships with in your daily life. Then write about
what character traits each represents to you
and why it’s important to you to develop or
fully understand these traits. 
Improving Relationships
1. Think of one of your friends who seems to be
troubled or in need of help right now. Ask for
a dream to shed light on their problem, and
to show you how you might counsel them.
Incubate a dream and when you receive one
that seems like the answer to your request,
call your friend and tell them about it. See if
together, the two of you can interpret it.
Appendix: Dream Diary Writing Prompts 301

2. Finish the following sentences with as many
answers as you can:
If I could know anything about my relation-
ship with <blank>, I’d like to understand . . .
If I could help <blank>, the most appropriate
thing to do or say would be . . .
If I could find true forgiveness for <blank>I’d
need to let go of/understand . . .
If I could begin a new relationship with some-
one, I’d like them to have these qualities . . .
3. Go through your dream diary and list the
romance or sex dreams you’ve had. What,
besides wishful thinking, might have been the
purpose of these dreams?
4. Write several paragraphs about the taboos
you’ve broken in your dreams. How did it
feel? What did you learn? Why did your dream
self want to open that particular area? Did you
receive increased energy as a result?
5. Write about the times you’ve experienced
telepathy, in ordinary reality and in dreams,
with someone else. How did it feel? How did
the communication occur? Was it in a visita-
tion from someone far away, or on the other
side?
Enhancing Healing
1. Scan through your dream diary, noting any
dreams that might be about your health
Dream Dictionary For Dummies 
302

or body. Write about each: If this were a
forecasting dream, what would my dream self
be trying to tell me? 
2. Scan through your dream diary, noting any
dreams that might be about your health or
body. Write about each: If this were a thera-
peutic or healing dream, what would my dream
self be trying to tell me? 
3. Write about three possible scenarios that
would put you in a state of deep peaceful-
ness. Write about the sensory detail, how your
body responds to being there, and how you
would use each setting for maximum benefit.
4. Make up three dream scenarios where you
are healed of some problem you currently
have — mental, emotional, energetic, or
physical. How does it happen? Who helps you?
Where are you when it happens? What advice
do your helpers have for you?
5. Write out three dream scenarios depicting
yourself in optimum health. How do you look?
What are you doing? How are you interacting
with others? How do you remain healthy?
6. Let yourself fantasize and write about how
you would help heal a friend, relative, or
even a public figure who suffers from an
injury or illness. Imagine that anything is
possible, and you can use any technique that
comes to mind.
7. Examine your dreams and write about sym-
bols and imagery pertaining to possible imbal-
ances in your system, illnesses, accidents,
Appendix: Dream Diary Writing Prompts 303

parts of the body, or problems other people
might be having. Are you dreaming about your
own health, or the health of another? Is it literal
or symbolic?
