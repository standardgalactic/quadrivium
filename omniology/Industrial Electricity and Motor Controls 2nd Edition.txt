A glossary is provided for use by the technician
and apprentice to aid in keeping current with the
rapidly evolving terminology and equipment.
There are ample illustrations for showing the equip-
ment long established in this field. However, the field is
rapidly progressing and this material can serve as a
valuable resource for those who are attempting to
keep up with the latest developments in motor con-
trol. Obviously, not all problems can be presented here;
a great deal of on-the-job ingenuity is required.
As you know, it is not possible to learn to swim
without first getting a feel for the water. Neither is it
possible to learn all there is to know about electrical
controls by reading about them. You must be willing to
get practical experience and devote time to the devel-
opment of skills related to the job.
It is the authors’ hope that the book will serve as an
appetizer to those really interested in going into this
exciting, yet demanding field.

Industrial Electricity & Motor Controls has been
designed for use by industrial electricians and appren-
tices who install and operate electrical systems as well
as for others concerned with motor controls. These
include electricians, technicians, engineers, electrical
contractors and related others, such as drafters and de-
signers of electrical systems. We assume that the reader
has a working knowledge of basic electricity and elec-
tric motor theory and operation, but a quick review of
basics is provided for those who can use it. The book
builds on that base to provide a working knowledge of
the many aspects of maintenance systems.
All the information needed for a thorough under-
standing of motor controllers and their theory, opera-
tion, installation, and maintenance of various electrical
systems is provided. The book is designed primarily
for use by apprentice training programs, journeyman
training, vocational-technical schools and two-year
colleges where a need for a better grasp of the termi-
nology and processes are present.

A Quick Review 
of the Basics
Introduction

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• Give a simple definition of current electricity.
• List seven ways in which electricity is generated. 
• Identify the four factors that determine resistance.
• Identify the various types of circuits.
• State Ohm’s law.
• Discuss the ways in which electricity is measured.
• Identify the switches used to control electricity.
• Read a resistor color code.
WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?
Though you cannot see electricity, you are aware of it
everyday. You see it used in countless ways. You can-
not taste or smell electricity, but you can feel it. You
can taste food cooked with its energy. You can smell
the gas (ozone) formed when lightning passes through
the air.
Basically there are two kinds of electricity: static
(stationary) and current (moving). This book is chiefly
about current electricity because that is the kind com-
monly put to use. Current electricity can be simply
defined as the flow of electrons along a conductor. To
understand the definition, you must know something
about chemical elements and atoms.
ELEMENTS AND ATOMS
Elements are the most basic materials in the universe.
Ninety-four elements, such as iron, copper, and nitro-
gen, have been found in nature. Scientists have made
11 others in laboratories. Every known substance—
solid, liquid, or gas—is composed of elements.
It is very rare for an element to exist in a pure
state. Nearly always the elements are found in combi-
nations called compounds. Even such a common sub-
stance as water is a compound rather than an element
(Fig. I-1).
An atom is the smallest particle of an element that
retains all the properties of that element. Each ele-
ment has its own kind of atom. That is, all hydrogen
atoms are alike, and they are different from the atoms
of all other elements. However, all atoms have certain
things in common. They all have an inner part, known
as the nucleus, which is composed of tiny particles
called protons and neutrons. An atom also has an
outer part consisting of other tiny particles, called
electrons, which orbit around the nucleus (Figs. I-2
and I-3).

Introduction

Two or more atoms linked are called a molecule. Here
two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom form a molecule of the
compound water (H2O).

better than others. Thus the term conductor is usually
used to mean a material through which electrons
move freely.
What makes one material a better conductor than
another? A material that has many free electrons tends
to be a good conductor. For practical purposes, how-
ever, there are other points that must be considered
when choosing a material to use as a conductor. For
example, gold, silver, aluminum, and copper are all
good conductors. However, the cost of gold and silver
limits their use. Copper, because of its superior strength
in both hot and cold weather, is preferred over alu-
minum for many uses.
Insulators
An insulator is a substance that restricts flow of elec-
trons. Such materials have a very limited number of
free electrons. Thus you see that the movement of free
electrons classifies a material as either a conductor or
an insulator. No material is known to be a perfect insu-
lator, that is, entirely void of free electrons. However,
some materials are such poor conductors that for all
practical purposes, they are placed in the insulator
class.
Wood, glass, mica, and polystyrene are insulators
(Fig. I-4). They have varying degrees of resistance to
the movement of their electrons. The higher the line on
the chart in Fig. I-4, the better are the insulating quali-
ties of the material.
Semiconductors
You have heard the word “semiconductor” in relation
to transistors and diodes used in electronic equipment.
Materials used in the manufacture of transistors and
diodes have a conductivity between that of a good con-
ductor and a good insulator. Therefore, the name semi-
conductor is given to them. Germanium and silicon are
the two most commonly known semiconductors.
Through the introduction of small amounts of other ele-
ments, these nearly pure (99.999999%) elements
become limited conductors. The manufacture of semi-
conductors is a fascinating process. However, it would
take too long to go into details at this time. You may
wish to research the topic on your own by checking out
a book from your library or using the Internet.
GENERATING ELECTRICITY
There are several ways to produce electricity. Remem-
ber that electricity is the flow of electrons along a con-
ductor. Friction, pressure, heat, light, chemical action,
and magnetism are among the more practical methods
Generating Electricity  
3
Neutrons have no electrical charge, but protons
are positively charged. Electrons have a negative
charge. Because of these charges, protons and elec-
trons are energy particles, that is, these charges
form an electric field of force within the atom. Stated
very simply, these charges are always pulling and
pushing each other, which makes energy in the form
of movement.
The atoms of each element have a definite number
of electrons and protons. A hydrogen atom has one elec-
tron and one proton. An aluminum atom has 13 of each.
The opposite charges: negative electrons and positive
protons, attract each other and tend to hold electrons in
orbit. As long as this arrangement is not changed, an
atom is electrically balanced.
However, electrons of some atoms are easily
pushed or pulled out of their orbits. This ability of
electrons to move or flow is the basis of current elec-
tricity.
Free Electrons
In some materials, heat loosens electrons from their
atoms. In other materials such as copper, electrons may
be easily forced to drift, even at room temperatures.
When electrons leave their orbits, they may move from
atom to atom at random, drifting in no particular direc-
tion. Electrons that move in such a way are referred to
as free electrons. However, a force can be applied to
direct them in a definite path.
Current Flow
If the movement of free electrons is channeled in a given
direction, a flow of electrons, commonly referred to as
current flow, occurs. Thus you see that the movement of
electrons is related to current electricity.
Energy
Electrons are incredibly small. The diameter of an elec-
tron is about 0.00000000000022 in. You may wonder
how anything so small can be a source of energy. Much
of the answer lies in the fact that electrons move with
nearly the speed of light. Also, billions of them can
move at once through a wire. The speed and concentra-
tion produce great energy.
ELECTRICAL MATERIALS
Conductors 
A conductor is a material through which electrons
move. Actually, all metals and most other materials
are conductors to some extent. Some, however, are

used to make electrons move along a conductor. Other
methods (sometimes called “exotic”) are used to gener-
ate electricity for special purposes. For instance, exper-
imental cells developed for the space program are
termed “exotic.”
• Friction. Electricity is produced when two materials
are rubbed together. The movement of your shoes
against the carpet can cause static electricity. Some
practical applications of static electricity are manu-
facture of sandpaper and cleaning of polluted air
(Fig. I-5).
• Pressure. Electricity is produced when pressure is
applied to certain crystals, these are usually Rochelle
salts or quartz. Special properties of the crystals are
utilized in crystal microphone (Fig. I-6). Here, bend-
ing of the crystal produces a small electrical output.
This phenomenon is known as the piezoelectric
effect. The small voltage thus produced can be ampli-
fied to drive a speaker. In fact, crystal pickups are
used in inexpensive record players and for some
industrial jobs.
• Heat. Electricity is produced when heat is applied to
the junction between two dissimilar metals. This
junction is usually referred to as a thermocouple.
Thermocouples are used to measure temperatures in
industrial applications. This is especially true in
checking the temperature of kilns for ceramic work
(Fig. I-7).

Electrostatic precipitator uses a two-stage method of cleansing air by
collecting ionized particles on charge plates. Ionizing wires of tungsten are charged
with 12,000-V dc (). All particles are then electrically charged by ionization ().
The positively charged particles are attracted to the negatively charged plates with
6000 V (). The negatively charged plate is the collecting cell. Clean air is
exhausted from the precipitator.

Introduction
• Light. Electricity is produced when light strikes a
photosensitive material. (The word “photo” means
light.) Photoelectric cells are used in cameras, space-
craft, and radios (Fig. I-8).
• Chemical action. Electricity is produced when a
chemical action takes place between two metals in a
cell. A single unit is called a cell. Connecting two or
more cells together produces a battery. Batteries are
used in flashlights, radios, hearing aids, toys, cam-
eras and calculators. Automobiles use a lead-acid
cell combination. You cannot start cars today without
a battery. Many types of cells are available today
(Fig. I-9).
• Lithium batteries. There are a number of lithium
batteries types. They are encountered in watches,
hand battery powered electric drills, and other tools.
They are rechargeable and are found in laptop com-
puters and other electronics equipment. The lithium
battery may be small enough to fit into a hearing aid
or large enough to power an automobile.
The family of lithium batteries include the:
• Lithium iron phosphate
• Lithium manganese oxide
• Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide
• Lithium cobalt oxide
The lithium battery or cell carries its current from
the negative to the positive electrode through a non-
aqueous electrolyte and separator diaphragm. Graphite
is most often used as the negative electrode and the pos-
itive electrode is any one of the following materials:
• Lithium cobalt oxide
• Lithium iron phosphate
• Lithium manganese oxide
The electrolyte is usually a mixture of organic car-
bonates such as ethylene carbonate or diethyl carbonate
that are complexes of lithium ions.
The lithium battery has a higher energy density
than the nickel cadmium so it is physically smaller and
lighter. The lithium can operate over a wider tempera-
ture range with higher outputs.
Figure 1-9B shows a round lithium cell used in a
handheld remote control unit to open and lock automo-
bile doors. The larger flat 3.6 volt cell is used in small
cameras and cell phones. A larger unit is utilized in bat-
tery powered screwdrivers, hedge trimmers, and various
other devices in which light weight power sources are
necessary. The laptop computer makes good use of the
lithium battery.
• Magnetism. Electricity is produced when a magnet is
moved past a piece of wire or a piece of wire is moved
through a magnetic field. The result is the same.
Motion, a magnetic field, and a piece of wire are
needed to produce electricity. To date, magnetism is
the most inexpensive way of producing electrical
power. We use magnetism to produce electricity for
homes and cars. An electric generator is found under
the hood of every automobile. This device can pro-
duce great amounts of electrical energy. The electric
generator is called an alternator because it generates
alternating current (ac). AC flows first in one direc-
tion and then in the other. Direct current (dc) flows in
one direction only (Fig. I-10).
• Exotic generators. The fuel cell is one of the latest
developments for production of electricity. The oxy-
gen-concentration cell includes an electrolyte. The
electrolyte conducts electric charge in the form of
oxygen ions, but acts as an insulator to electrons. The
electrolyte is located between two electrodes. (The
electrolyte is wet, and the electrodes are usually metal
rods or sheets.) By causing oxygen of different con-
centrations to pass by the electrodes, it is possible to
produce electricity.
The hydrogen-oxygen cell produces water and
electricity. Such a cell was used on one of the space-
flights to supply both drinking water and electricity in
a very small space. Other exotic cells—not all of
them perfected yet—are the redox fuel cell, hydrocar-
bon fuel cell, ion-exchange membrane, and magneto-
hydrodynamic (MHD) generator (Fig. I-11). In the
MHD generator, hot plasma is generated and seeded
in a burner, similar to a rocket engine. It then travels
through a magnetic field applied at right angles to the
flow and past electrodes exposed to this stream of gas.
Electrons in the gas are deflected by the field.
Between collisions with the particles in the gas, they
make their way to one of the electrodes. Electricity
flows as the electrons move from the cathode, through

the load, to the anode, and back again to the gas
stream. There are thousands of other methods of pro-
ducing electricity.
VOLTAGE AND CURRENT
So far you have become aware of what electricity is.
You have learned some of the ways it is produced. Now
it is time to learn how electrical energy is measured.
The units of measurement most frequently used are
volt (V) for voltage and ampere (A) for current.
• Volts. We measure the difference in potential between
two plates in a battery in terms of volts. It is actually
the electrical pressure exerted on electrons in a cir-
cuit. (A circuit is a pathway for the movement of
electrons.) An external force exerted on electrons to
make them flow through a conductor is known as
electromotive force (EMF), which is measured in
volts. Electrical pressure, potential difference, and
EMF mean the same thing. The terms “voltage drop”
and “potential drop” can be interchanged.

• Current. For electrons to move in a particular direc-
tion, there must be a potential difference between two
points of the EMF source. If  6.28  1018 electrons
pass a given point in 1 s, a current of 1 A flows
through the point. The same number of electrons
stored on an object (static charge) and not moving is
called a coulomb (symbol C). Current is assumed to
flow from the negative () to positive () terminal of
a battery or generator.
Current is measured in amperes. In electronics, it is
sometimes necessary to use smaller units of measure-
ment. The milliampere (mA) is used to indicate 1/1000
of an ampere (0.001 A). If an even smaller unit is
needed, it is usually the microampere (A). The
microampere is one-millionth of an ampere, which may
also be written as 0.000001 A. The Greek letter “mu” ()
is used to indicate micro. (Table I-A lists the Greek
alphabet and the terms they designate.)
A voltmeter is used to measure voltage. An amme-
ter is used to measure current in amperes. A microam-
meter or a milliammeter may be used to measure
smaller units of current.
Resistance
The movement of electrons along a conductor meets
with some opposition. This opposition is resistance.
Resistance is useful in electrical and electronics work.
Resistance makes it possible to generate heat, control
electron flow, and supply the correct voltage to a
device.
Resistance in a conductor depends on four factors:
material, length, cross-section area, and temperature.

Voltage and Current

• Material. Some materials offer more resistance than
others. The  resistance depends upon the number of
free electrons present in the material.
• Length. The longer the wire or conductor, the more
resistance it has. The resistance varies directly with
the length of the wire.
• Cross-sectional area. Resistance varies inversely
with the cross-sectional size of the conductor. In
other words, the larger the wire, the smaller the resis-
tance per foot.
• Temperature. For most materials, the higher the
temperature, the higher the resistance. However,
there are some exceptions to this in devices known as
thermistors. Thermistors change resistance with tem-
perature. The resistance decreases as the temperature
increases. Thermistors are used in meters and as tem-
perature indicators.
Resistance is measured in the unit called ohm,
which is denoted by the Greek letter “omega” ().
Wire Size
As you become more familiar with electricity and cir-
cuits and with some of the requirements for wiring a
house or building, you will become more aware of the
current carrying abilities of wire. Size of the wire is
given in numbers. This size usually ranges from 0000
(referred to as 4 noughts) to No. 40. The larger the wire,
the smaller its number.
For instance, No. 32 wire is smaller than No. 14.
Table I-B shows the resistance (in ohms per 1000 ft) in
relation to the cross-sectional area. Note how the tem-
perature affects the resistance at 77°F and 149°F
(25°C and 65°C). Temperature can make quite a dif-
ference in resistance for long wires. Long wires pick
up heat and expand when exposed to summer weather.
Copper versus Aluminum Wire
Although silver is the best conductor, its use is lim-
ited because of high cost. Two commonly used con-
ductors are aluminum and copper. Each has
advantages and disadvantages. For instance, copper
has high conductivity and is more ductile (can be
drawn out thinner). It is relatively high in tensile
strength and can be soldered easily. But it is more
expensive than aluminum.
Aluminum has only about 60% of the conductivity
of copper. It is used in high-voltage transmission lines
and sometimes in home wiring. Its use has increased in
recent years. However, many electricians will not use it
to wire a house today. There are a number or reasons
for this, which will become apparent as we progress
through the book.
If copper and aluminum are twisted together, as in
a wire nut connection, it is possible for moisture to get
to the open metals over a period of time. Corrosion will
take place, causing a high-resistance joint. This can
result in a dimmer light or a malfunctioning motor.

Circuits
• Complete circuit. A complete circuit is necessary
for the controlled flow or movement of electrons
along a conductor (Fig. I-12A). A complete circuit is
made up of a source of electricity, a conductor, and a
consuming device. The flow of electrons through the
consuming device produces heat, light, or work.
In order to form a complete circuit, these rules must
be followed:
1. Connect one side of the power source to one side of
the consuming device (A to B). 
2. Connect the other side of the power source to one
side of the control device, usually a  switch (C to D).
3. Connect the other side of the control device to
the consuming device it is supposed to control (E
to F).
This method is used to make a complete path for
electrons to flow from one terminal of the battery or
power source containing excess of electrons to the ter-
minal which has a deficiency of electrons. The move-
ment of the electrons along the completed path provides
energy. Of course, in order for the path to be complete,
the switch must be closed.

used for finding parallel resistances. If there are only
two resistors in parallel, a simple formula can be used:
If there are more than two resistors in parallel, you
can use the following formula: (You can also use this
formula if there are only two resistors.)
One thing should be kept in mind in parallel resis-
tances: The total resistance is always less than the
smallest resistance.
• Series-parallel circuits. Series-parallel circuits are a
combination of the two circuits. Figure I-12D shows
a series-parallel resistance circuit.
• Open circuit. An open circuit is one which does not
have a complete path for electrons to follow. Such an
incomplete path is usually brought about by a loose
connection or the opening of a switch (Fig. I-13).
• Short circuit. A short circuit is one which has a path
of low resistance to electron flow. It is usually cre-
ated when a low-resistance wire is placed across a

Open circuit caused by an open switch.
If the circuit is so arranged that the electrons have
only one path, the circuit is called a series circuit. If
there are two or more paths for electrons, the circuit is
called a parallel circuit.
• Series circuit. Figure I-12B shows three resistors con-
nected in series. The current flows through each of
them before returning to the positive terminal of the
battery.
Kirchhoff’s Law of Voltages states that the sum of all
voltages across resistors or loads is equal to the applied
voltage. Voltage drop is considered across the resistor.
In Fig. I-12B, the current flows through three resistors.
The voltage drop across R1 is 5 V. Across R2, it is 10 V,
and across R3 it is 15 V. The sum of the individual volt-
age drop is equal to the total or applied voltage, 30 V.
To find the total resistance in a series circuit, just
add the individual resistances: 
RT  R1  R2  R3  . . .
• Parallel circuit. In a parallel circuit, each load (resis-
tance) is connected directly across the voltage
source. There are as many separate paths for current
flow as there are branches (Fig. I-12C).
The voltage across all branches of a parallel circuit is
the same because all branches are connected across the
voltage source. Current in a parallel circuit depends on
the resistance of the branch. Ohm’s law (discussed later)
can be used to determine the current in each branch. You
can find the total current for a parallel circuit by adding
the individual currents. As a formula, this reads:
IRT  IR1  IR2 IR3  . . .
The total resistance of a parallel circuit cannot be
found by adding the resistor values. Two formulas are

The best way to become accustomed to solving
problems is to start with something simple, such
as:
1. If the voltage is given as 100 V and the resistance is
known to be 50 , it is a simple problem and a prac-
tical application of Ohm’s law to find the current in
the circuit.
I  2 A
2. If the current is given as 4 A (shown on an ammeter)
and the voltage (read from a voltmeter) is 100 V, it is
easy to find the resistance.
R  25 
3. If the current is known to be 5 A, and the resistance
is measured (before current is applied to the circuit)
and found to be 75 , it is then possible to determine
how much voltage is needed to cause the circuit to
function properly.

consuming device. A greater number of electrons will
flow through the path of least resistance rather than the
consuming device. A short circuit usually generates an
excess current flow which results in overheating, possi-
bly causing a fire or other damage (Fig. I-14).
It is easy to compute the amount of current flowing
in a circuit if the voltage and the resistance are known.
The relationship between voltage, current, and resis-
tance in any circuit is given by Ohm’s law.
OHM’S LAW
There are three basic quantities of electricity, and each
has a relationship to the other two. A physicist named
Georg S. Ohm discovered the relationship in 1827. He
found that in any circuit where the only opposition to
the flow of electrons is resistance, there is a relation-
ship among the values of voltage, current, and resis-
tance. The strength or intensity of the current is directly
proportional to the voltage and inversely proportional
to the resistance.
It is easier to work with Ohm’s law when it is
expressed in a formula. In the formula, E represents
EMF, or voltage. I is the current, or the intensity of
electron flow. R stands for resistance. The formula is
E  I  R and is used in finding the EMF (voltage)
when the current and resistance are known.
To find the current when the voltage and resistance
are known, the formula to use is
To find the resistance when the voltage and current
are known, the formula to use is
Using Ohm’s Law
There are many times in electrical work when you will
need to know Ohm’s law: for example, to determine
wire size in a particular circuit or to find the resistance
in a circuit.

Power formulas are sometimes needed to figure the
wattage of a circuit. The three most commonly used for-
mulas are
P  E  I
P  
P  I2R
This means that if any one of the three—voltage, cur-
rent, or resistance—is missing, it is possible to find the
missing quantity by using the relationship between the
two known quantities. In later chapters, you will
encounter the problem of the I2R losses and some other
terminology related to the formulas just shown.
The milliwatt (mW) is sometimes used in referring
to electrical equipment. For instance, the rating of a
speaker in a portable transistor radio may be given as
100 or 300 mW, which means that a 0.1- or 0.3-W rating,
since the prefix “milli” means one-thousandth. Transis-
tor circuits are designated in milliwatts, but power-line
electrical power is usually in kilowatts.
MEASURING ELECTRICITY
Electricity must be measured if it is to be sold, or if it is
to be fully utilized. There are a number of ways to mea-
sure electricity. It can be measured in volts, amperes, or
watts. The kWh meter is the most commonly used
device to measure power.
Meters
In order to measure anything, there must be a basic unit
in which to measure. In electricity, current (flow of
electrons) is measured in a basic unit called ampere.
The current is usually measured with a permanent mag-
net and an electromagnet arranged to indicate the
amperes. Such a device is necessary since we are unable
to see an electron—even with the most powerful micro-
scopes. Obviously, counting the number of electrons
passing a given point in a second is impossible when
there are no visible particles to count. Therefore, a mag-
netic field is used to measure the effect of electrons.
The D’Arsonval meter movement uses a permanent
magnet as a base over which a wire or electromagnet is
pivoted and allowed to move freely. When current flows
through the coil, a magnetic field is set up (Figs. I-16A
and I-16B). The strength of the magnetic field deter-
mines how far the coil will be deflected. The polarity of
the moving coil is the same as that of the permanent
magnet. A repelling action results, in proportion to the
strength of the magnetic field generated by the current
flowing through the coil. The number of turns in the coil,

The horsepower rating of electric motors is arrived
at by multiplying the voltage by the current drawn
under full load. This power is measured in watts. In
other words, 1 V times 1 A equals 1 W. When put into
a formula,
Power  Volts  Amperes
or
P  E  I
Kilowatts
The prefix “kilo” means one thousand. Thus 1000 W
equals 1 kilowatt (kW). One kilowatt-hour (kWh) is
equivalent to 1000 W used for 1 h. Electric bills are
figured in kWh. Usage for an entire month is computed
on an hourly basis and then read in the kWh unit.
POWER
Power is defined as the rate at which work is done.  In
metric measurement it is expressed in watts for power
and joules (J) for energy or work. (For some common
metric conversions, see Appendix A.) One watt is the
power that gives rise to the production of energy at the
rate of 1 J in 1 s (1 W  1 J/s). One joule is the work
done when the point of application of a force of 1 N
(newton) is displaced at a distance of 1 m in the direc-
tion of the force (1 J  1 N  1 m).
It has long been the practice in United States to mea-
sure work in terms of horsepower (hp). Electric motors
are still rated in horsepower, and probably will be for
some time. The United States did not change to metric
when Canada and England did and probably never will.
Power can be electrical or mechanical. When a mechani-
cal force is used to lift a weight, work is done. The rate at
which the weight is moved is called power. Horsepower
is defined in terms of moving a certain weight over a cer-
tain distance in 1 min. Energy is consumed in moving a
weight, or work is done in the process. The findings in
this field have been equated with the same amount of
work done by electrical energy. It takes 746 W of electri-
cal power to equal 1 hp (Table I-C).
Measuring Electricity  
13
Table I–C
Horsepower
One horsepower is usually defined as the amount of work required
to move a 550-pound weight a distance of one foot in one second.
In most cases the modern way to measure power is in kilowatts
rather than horsepower. In case a motor is specified in terms of horse-
power, but is rated in watts or kilowatts, the conversion is simple:
1 horsepower = 746 watts
Divide the number of watts or kilowatts by 746 or 0.746, respec-
tively, to find the horsepower rating.

times the current through the coil determines the
strength of the magnetic field. Since the meter coil is
pivoted on jeweled bearings to reduce any friction, the
movement is calibrated against a known source of cur-
rent or against another meter. The scale on a new device
is calibrated to read in amperes, milliamperes, or
microamperes (Fig. I-16C).
• AC ammeter. If ac is to be measured by a dc meter
movement, a rectifier is inserted in the circuit (meter
circuit) to change the ac to dc. Otherwise, the ac will
make the needle on the meter vibrate rapidly. This
vibration means there is little or no movement from
zero (Fig. I-17).
• Shunts. A shunt is a means of bypassing current
around a meter movement. A resistor of proper size is
inserted across the meter movement to bypass the
current around the movement. Most of the current is
bypassed with only the necessary amount left to
cause the meter to deflect at its designed limit. The
meter is calibrated to read on its scale the full amount
of current flowing in the circuit (Fig. I-18).
A number of shunts can be placed in a meter case
and switched. A different resistor (shunt) can be switched
in for each range needed. A meter with more than one
range is called a multimeter.

ac meter movement is made by adding a diode to the
dc meter movement.

COMMON is negative (), or black, and POSITIVE is
positive (), or red. However, polarity isn’t necessary
to measure ac, either lead can be used at any terminal in
an ac circuit. Ammeters are always connected in series
in a circuit. This usually means the circuit has to be bro-
ken and the meter inserted in the line.
• Voltmeter. The voltmeter measures electrical pres-
sure, or volts. It is nothing more than an ammeter with
a resistor added in the meter circuit. The high resis-
tance of the voltmeter makes it possible to connect in
parallel across a power source (Fig. I-20). A number of
resistors, called multipliers, can be switched into a
meter circuit to increase its range or make it capable of
measuring higher voltages. The voltmeter in Fig. I-21
is capable of measuring voltages ranging from 0 to
150, 0 to 300, and 0 to 750 V by connecting the proper
multiplier into the meter circuit. Note how the termi-
nals on top of the meter allow connection of test
A multimeter (one which can measure volts and
ohms as well) is shown in Fig. I-19. It can measure
from 0 to 1 mA, 0 to 10 mA, and 0.1 to 1 A. This is a
1-mA meter movement and needs no shunt when used
to measure as high as 1 mA. A shunt is switched in,
however, to measure a range of 0 to 10 mA and 0.1 to 1 A.
A switch on the meter can also add a diode to help with
measuring ac.
COMMON and POSITIVE holes have test leads
inserted to attach to the circuit being measured.

probes in a number of different positions for varying
the range of measurement.
• Ohmmeter. The basic unit for measuring resistance
is ohm. An ohmmeter is a device for measuring resis-
tance in ohms (). It is an ammeter (or milliammeter
or micrometer) movement modified to measure resis-
tance (Fig. I-22).
Figure I-22 shows a multimeter capable of measur-
ing ohms with three different ranges: R  1, R  100,
and R  10K (R  10,000). This means the meter can
measure from 0 to 200  on the R  1 scale and 0 to
200 k on the R  100 range. Within the R  10K
range, it is capable of measuring from 0 to 20 M
(megohms; mega means 1 million). The meter scale has
to be multiplied by 100 or 10,000 in order to have it
read the proper value. By changing resistors, it is possi-
ble to vary the resistance measuring range of an ohm-
meter. Figure I-23 shows a basic ohmmeter using a
1-mA meter movement and its necessary parts. Note
how the battery serves as the power source. This makes
it necessary to turn off power whenever you read the
resistance of a circuit. THE OHMMETER HAS ITS
OWN POWER SOURCE. Do not connect it to a LIVE
CIRCUIT or one with the power on, because that will
result in destruction of the meter movement.
Adjust the ohmmeter so that the meter reads zero
before starting resistance measurement, which means
you have adjusted the meter circuit to compensate for
the battery voltage changes. Battery voltages decrease
with shelf life. It doesn’t matter whether or not the bat-
tery is used. It will, in time, lose its voltage.
Some meters are not portable. They need external
sources of power. Electronic circuits using vacuum

you have to insert it properly into the circuit being mea-
sured. If a circuit is being measured for resistance,
make sure there is no power turned on when the meter
is connected.
This type of meter is rugged but can be damaged,
however, if it is set for measuring ohms when instead,
volts are being measured. The display can be damaged
permanently when left on for too long or when the
meter is dropped rather hard. To extend the battery life,
turn the meter off when not in use.
Prices of digital meters are dropping rapidly. Grad-
ually, the digital meter can be expected to replace all
other types. However, for some purposes, the digital
meter can be outperformed by the D’Arsonval move-
ment. For example, some meter indicators simply need
a deflection of the needle to show proper operation. In
digital meters, you have to wait for the numbers to be
counted up or down, which takes concentration on the
part of the user. The D’Arsonval movement simply
shows a deflection of the needle.
• AC clamp-on meter. Figures I-25 and I-26 show two
types of ac clamp-on meters. The meters are inserted
over a wire carrying ac. The magnetic field around the
wire induces a small current in the meters. The scale
is calibrated to read amperes or volts. Because the wire
is run through the large loop extending past the meter
movement, it is possible to read the ac voltage, or cur-
rent, without removing the insulation from the wire.
These meters are very useful when working with
ac motors.
tubes or transistors are used to improve the meter capa-
bilities. Figure I-24 shows a digital voltmeter set to read
dc voltages.
• Digital meters. The digital meter is entirely elec-
tronic. It uses printed circuits and integrated circuit
chips to measure and calculate voltage, resistance,
and current. There are no coils or magnets.
Figure I-24 shows a portable and self-contained
digital meter. The meter indicates the reading on a liq-
uid crystal display (LCD). This type of digital readout is
found on many instruments, clocks, and watches.
Most of these meters have a number of voltage
ranges. The ranges must be selected each time you
measure a circuit. Some meters are made with auto-
ranging. They select the proper range and measure the
voltage without the need for preselection. The operator
must indicate if volts, ohms, or amperes are to be mea-
sured.
Digital meters sample the circuit about 5 times per
second and then display the average of the 5 samples for
very accurate readings. In most instances, the electri-
cian is not concerned with the 0.01-V accuracy that
these meters are capable of reaching.
The meter is highly accurate and easy to use. You
simply turn on the meter to the needed function, then
select ohms, and use the probes across the resistor to
measure resistance. If you use this unit as a milliammeter,

• Wattmeter. A wattmeter measures electrical power.
Electrical power is figured by multiplying the voltage
times the current. A wattmeter has two electromag-
netic coils (a coil with many turns of fine wire for
voltage and a coil with a few turns of heavy wire for
current). The voltage coil is connected across the
incoming line, and the current coil is connected in
series with one of the incoming wires. The two coils
are stationary and in series with a moving coil. The
strength of the magnetic fields determines how much
the moving coil is deflected. The deflection of the
needle is read on a scale calibrated in watts. In this
way, the wattmeter measures the power consumed in
1 s (Fig. I-27).

of many types used today. The taut band type is basi-
cal1y the same as the D’Arsonval movement except
that a tightly stretched and twisted hand is used to hold
the coil and needle in place between the permanent
magnet poles. In addition, no moving points touch the
meter case; so jeweled bearings are unnecessary. The
band is twisted when it is inserted into the meter frame
so that it will cause the coil to spring back to its origi-
nal resting place upon interruption of current through
the coil.
• Electrodynamometer. 
The 
electrodynamometer
type of meter uses no permanent magnet. Two fixed
coils produce the magnetic field. The meter also uses
two moving coils. This meter can be used as a volt-
meter or an ammeter (Fig. I-29). It is not as sensitive
as the D’Arsonval meter movement.
For measuring the electrical power used over a
longer period of time, the kWh meter was designed.
The kWh meter is often seen on the side of a house or
building. It measures power used over a certain period,
for example, a month. A kWh meter measures power
consumed in terms of thousands of watts. Electric
power is priced at a certain rate per kWh.
The kWh meter is a small induction motor. Meter
torque is produced by an electromagnet called a stator,
which has two sets of windings. One winding, called a
potential coil, produces a magnetic field representing cir-
cuit voltage. Another winding, called a current coil, pro-
duces a magnetic field that represents the load current.
These two coils are arranged so that their magnetic fields
create a force on the meter disc, which is directly propor-
tional to the power, or watts, drawn by the connected load.
Permanent magnets are used to introduce a retard-
ing, or braking, force that is proportional to the speed of
the disc. The magnetic strength of these retarding mag-
nets regulates the disc speed for any given load so that
each revolution of the disc always measures the same
quantity of energy or watt-hours. Disc revolutions are
converted to kWh on the meter register.
Most meters are inserted into a socket on the wall
of a structure. Removing the meter interrupts or termi-
nates power, without handling of dangerous high-
voltage wires. Three-phase and single-phase power, to
be discussed in later chapters 16, 19, and 20, each require
different watt-hour meters. Kilowatt-hour meters are
tested by computers in the service centers of power
companies (Fig. I-28).
Other Types of Meters
There are other types of meters used to measure volt-
age and current. The D’Arsonval movement is only one

CONTROLLING ELECTRICITY
In order to make electricity useful, it is necessary to
control it. You want electricity in the proper place at the
proper time. Otherwise, it can do great damage—even
kill. Electricity can be controlled by using switches,
relays, or diodes. These devices are used to direct the
current where it will work for you. Each device is care-
fully chosen to do a specific job. For example, the relay
is used for remote-control work, and a diode is used to
control large and small currents in electrical as well as
electronic equipment. A diode is a device which allows
current to flow in one direction only. It can be used to
change ac to dc.
Switches
There are a number of switches used for controlling
electricity. Each switch has a different name, which
helps designate it according to the job it performs. For
instance, the single-pole, single-throw (SPST) is just
that, a single pole which is moved either to make con-
nection between two points or to not make connection.
In the off position the contacts are not touching, and the
flow of electrons is interrupted (Fig. I-30).
The double-pole, double-throw (DPDT) switch can
be used to control more than one circuit at the same
time. It can be used to reverse the direction of rotation
of a dc motor by reversing polarity (Fig. I-31).
Figure I-32 shows a single-pole, double-throw
(SPDT) switch. These switches: SPST, DPDT, and
SPDT, are open switches and should not be used with
more than 12 V. They are usually referred to as radio or
battery switches and are used here to show simple oper-
ation of a switch. Switches used for higher voltages are
totally enclosed and protected from body contact. This
prevents shocks or injuries from electrical shorts or
contact with high voltages.
The DPST switch is used to control two circuits at
the same time. It can be used as a simple on-off switch
for two circuits. Opening the switch interrupts the cur-
rent in the two circuits. When it is closed it completes
the circuits for proper operation. This switch is meant to
be used only on low voltages where the danger of shock
is very much reduced. Figure I-33 illustrates this type of
switch.
The doorbell, or door chime, switch is extremely
simple. It controls a circuit from the low-voltage trans-
former to the chime or bell (Fig. I-34). When the button
is pressed, the switch completes the circuit to the bell or
chime, causing current to flow from the transformer to
the chime (Fig. I-35).

• Toggle switches. Toggle switches are used to turn var-
ious devices on and off, or to switch from one device
to another. They are made in a number of configura-
tions to aid in selection for a particular job (Fig. I-36).
These switches usually have a metal handle and are
mounted through a round hole. Screw terminals are
usually provided for attaching wires. However, some
may have wire leads furnished. A wire nut is used to
attach the switch leads to the circuit wires. A wire nut
is a device that makes a connection between two
pieces of wire by twisting ends together. It insulates
the connection with a plastic coating.

Toggle switches.

Note the ac rocker switch in Fig. I-36. It is mounted
with screws to attack to the switch’s steel bracket. Holes
are tapped for a No. 6-32 screw on “1” centers. These
switches are usually rated for use on 120-V ac, with
special attention to current. The switches are capable of
switching 240 V. Current is usually doubled in a 120-V
rating as compared to a 240-V rating. This means a
switch rated at 120 V and 6 A must be de-rated to 3 A
for 240-V circuits.
• Residential toggle switches. Various shapes are
encountered when switches are needed for use in
business, industry, or the home. For instance in Fig. I-37,
you will find examples of some of those used to
switch 120-V ac and 240-V ac in common circuits
used in lighting and small motors. Figure I-37A
shows a residential toggle switch, rated 10 A on a
125-V line. Note the absence of “plaster ears” near
the long screws. Switch B is like A, except that it has
wide plaster ears (the extensions around the screw
holes) that can be removed easily if not required to
hold the switch rigid in its box. The plaster ears are
scored (marked) so that they can be easily bent and
removed. Switch C is more expensive than either A or
B. It has specification grade (top of the line) quality
with wide plaster ears. Note that the screws for
attaching circuit wiring are located topside, instead of
along the side of the switch.
Switch D is a high-capacity, heavy-duty, industrial
type, rated 20 A at 125 V. Switch E is an extra-heavy-
duty industrial type. It is a more expensive switch which
minimizes the arcing of contacts when turned on and off.
The arc, which occurs each time a switch is turned on or
off, creates high heat. The heat can cause the contacts of
the switch to become pitted and make a high-resistance
contact. The contacts in switch E have an extended life,
made possible by the use of arc snuffers.
Switch F is a “no-klik,” or quiet, heavy-duty
switch. It has eliminated the noise associated with the
on-off operation of a switch. Switch G is also a heavy-
duty, quiet, high-capacity-specification-grade switch,
and is good for 15 A at 120 or 277 V. Switch H is 
a quiet 15-A ac, side- or back-wired with binding
screw, and pressure, or screw-less, terminals. Some
switches have a grounding strap designed for use with
nonmetallic systems that use Bakelite boxes and for
bonding between the device strap and steel boxes.
These newer switches feature a green grounding-screw
terminal. They are available in either ivory or brown.
• Three-way switches. Three-way switches are used
where you need to control a light or device from more
than one location. These switches have three termi-
nals instead of two and do not have the labels ON and
OFF on the handles. The three-way switch looks like
a regular switch with the exception of the three termi-
nals for wiring into a circuit.
• Four-way switches. Four-way switches have double
poles, and are used where a light or device needs to be
controlled from three or more locations. If three con-
trols are preferred, you need two three-way switches
and one four-way switch. The four-way switch
resembles the three-way, but has four terminals for
connection into a circuit. Other types of switches are
available for different jobs of current control. They
will be shown as they are introduced in connection
with a specific job.
Switches are used to turn the flow of electricity on
or off, thereby causing a device to operate or cease oper-
ation. Switches can be used to reverse polarity, and as in
the case of electric motors, the direction of rotation can
be reversed by this action. Switches, as you have already

to be attracted upward into the coil area. When the
plunger is moved upward by the pull of the electromag-
net, the soft disc (10) is also pulled upward, allowing gas
to flow through the valve. This basic technique is used to
control water, oil, gasoline, or any other liquid or gas.
The starter solenoid on an automobile uses a simi-
lar procedure, except that the plunger has electrical con-
tacts on the end that complete the circuit from the
battery to the starter. The solenoid uses low voltage
(12 V) and low current to energize the coil. The coil in
turn sucks the plunger upward. The plunger then touches
heavy-duty contacts designed to handle the 300-A cur-
rent needed to start a cold engine. In this way, low volt-
age and low current are used, from a remote location, to
control low voltage and high current.
Solenoids are electromagnets. An electromagnet is
composed of a coil of wire wound around a core of soft
iron. When current flows through the coil, the core will
become magnetized. The magnetized core can be used
to attract an armature and act as a magnetic circuit
seen, come in many shapes and sizes. The important
thing to remember is to use a switch with proper voltage
and current rating, for the job to be done.A careful study
of the types presented in chapter 5 will aid in proper
selection of a switch for a particular job.
Solenoids
Solenoids are devices that turn electricity, gas, oil, or
water on and off. Solenoids can be used, for example, to
turn the cold water on and the hot water off in a washing
machine, to get a proper mix of warm water. To control
the hot water solenoid, a thermostat is inserted in the
circuit.
Figure I-38 shows a solenoid for controlling nat-
ural-gas flow in a hot-air furnace. Note how the coil is
wound around the plunger. The plunger is the core of
the solenoid. It has a tendency to be sucked into the coil
whenever the coil is energized by current flowing
through it. The electromagnetic effect causes the plunger

breaker (Fig. I-39). (A circuit breaker, like a fuse, pro-
tects a circuit against short circuits and overloads.) In
Fig. I-39, the magnetic circuit breaker is connected in
series with both the load circuit to be protected and with
the switch contact points. When excessive current flows
in the circuit, a strong magnetic field in the electromag-
net causes the armature to be attracted to the core. A
spring attached to the armatures causes the switch con-
tacts to open and break the circuit. The circuit breaker
must be reset by hand to allow the circuit to operate
again. If the overload is still present, the circuit breaker
will “trip” again. It will continue to do so until the cause
of the short circuit or overload is found and corrected.
Relays
A relay is a device that can control current from a remote
position through the use of a separate circuit for its own
power. Figure I-40 shows a simple relay circuit.
When the switch is closed, current flows through
the electromagnet, or coil, and energizes it. The pull of
the electromagnet causes the soft iron armature to be
attracted toward the electromagnet core. As the arma-
ture moves toward the coil, it touches the contacts of
other circuits, thereby completing the circuit for the
load. When a switch opens, the relay coil de-energizes,
and the spring pulls the armature back. This action
breaks the contact and removes the load from the 12-V
battery. Relays are remote switches that can be con-
trolled from almost any distance if the coil is properly
wired to its power source.
Many types of relays are available. They are used in
telephone circuits and in almost all automated, electri-
cal machinery.
Diodes
Diodes are semiconductor devices that allow current to
flow only in one direction. By properly connecting a
diode, or diodes, in a circuit, it is possible to control cur-
rent flow by controlling the direction of the current
(Fig. I-41A). AC flows first in one direction and then in
the reverse/opposite direction 120 times per second in a
60-hertz (Hz) circuit. The diode is a rectifier which
allows current to flow in only one direction. It changes
ac to dc which flows in only one direction.
It is possible to use four diodes, two switches, and
two wires to control two lamps located some distance
away from the switches. For example, Fig. I-41B shows
how switch A is depressed, allowing current to flow
through it and diode No. 1. The current then passes
through the wire to diode No. 2, through lamp A, and
back to the 120-V source. Lamp A will light.
When switch B is pressed, current flows through the
bottom wire to lamp B, diode No. 3, and along the top
wire to diode No. 4. The current then flows to switch B
and, back through the wire, to the 120-V ac source, caus-
ing lamp B to light. Whenever lamp B is lit, lamp A is

be identified by three- or four-color bands around them.
Their resistance can be determined by reading the color
bands and checking the resistor color code.
The wattage ratings of carbon-composition resis-
tors are determined by physical size. They come in 1/4-,
out because current cannot flow through diode No. 2.
However, if both switches are de-pressed at the same
time, both lamps will light. This is due to the ac taking
turns, flowing first in one direction, for instance in lamp
A, and then the other, in lamp B. There are pulses of cur-
rent, or pulsating direct current (PDC), through each
lamp. At 60 Hz, it is not possible for the human eye to
see the on-off condition of the lamps. The pulses are so
fast that the eye cannot respond, thus causing the lamps
to appear glowing continuously.
You will find applications of diodes in computers
and in other less-complicated electrical devices. Just
remember that the diode allows current to flow in only
one direction.
RESISTORS
A resistor is a device used to provide a definite,
required amount of opposition to current in a circuit.
Resistance is the basis for generation of heat. It is used
in circuits to control the flow of electrons and to ensure
that the proper voltage reaches a particular device.
Resistors are usually classified as either wire-wound or
carbon-composition. 
• Wire-wound resistors. These resistors are used to
provide sufficient opposition to current flow to dissi-
pate power of 5 W or more. They are made of resis-
tance wire (Fig. I-42). Variable wire-wound resistors
are also available for use in circuits where voltage is
changed at various times (Fig. I-43). Some variable
resistors have the ability to be varied but also adjusted
for a particular setting (Fig. I-44).
High-wattage, wire-wound resistors are available in
many sizes and shapes (Fig. I-45).
Carbon-composition resistors. These resistors are
usually found in electronic circuits of low wattage,
since they are not made in sizes beyond 2 W. They can

1/2-, 1-, and 2-W sizes. By examining them and becom-
ing familiar with them through use, you should be able
to identify wattage rating by sight. The larger the phys-
ical size of the resistor, the larger the wattage rating
(Fig. I-46).
Resistor Color Code
Take a close look at a carbon-composition resistor. The
bands should be to your left (Fig. I-47). Read from left
to right. The first band gives the first number according
to the color code. In this case, it is yellow, or 4. The sec-
ond band gives the next number, which is violet, or 7.
The third band represents the multiplier or divisor. If
the third band is a color in the range 0 to 9 in the color
code, it states the number of zeros to be added to
the first two numbers. Orange is 3; so the resistor in
Fig. I-47 has a value of 47,000- resistance.
If there is no fourth band, the resistor has a toler-
ance rating of 20% ( means “plus or minus”). If the
fourth band is silver, the resistor has a tolerance of
10%. If the fourth band is gold, the tolerance is 5%.
Silver and gold may also be used for the third band,
where according to the color code, the first two num-
bers (obtained from the first two color bands) must be
divided by 10 or 100. Silver means divide by 100; gold
means divide by 10. For example, if the bands on a
resistor are red, yellow, gold, and silver, the resistance
would be 24 divided by 10, or 2.4 (10% (Fig. I-48).
Resistors are available in hundreds of sizes and
shapes. Once familiar with electronics and electrical

CHAPTER

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• Identify the hand tools needed for motor control
work.
• Operate a volt-ohm-milliammeter (VOM), scope,
voltage tester, and digital probe.
• Identify wire wrap/unwrap tools, conduit benders,
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cutters, cable benders, and
conduit reamers.
A quick review of the tools and equipment used in
this trade will provide you with a refresher and better
overall view of them. You will be handling these tools
as well as others. Identification and utilization of
tools and equipment is necessary for your everyday
work.
Tools are an extension of a person. They allow a
human being to do things that are impossible using the
human hands alone. Tools are also expensive and rep-
resent a sizable investment in money and in the time
necessary to keep them in working condition. Two
types of tools are needed by electricians: hand tools,
and electrical instruments for measurement. We dis-
cuss both types in this chapter.
HAND TOOLS
Tools may be placed in an electrician’s pouch (Fig. 1-1)
or in a toolbox (Fig. 1-2). Keeping tools organized
saves time and money. If tools do not have a place to
call their own, you will spend too much time looking
for them. Not only do you need to have a definite place
for a tool, but you should also develop the habit of
returning it to that place after you have used it. Whenever
your tools are used on a workbench or around a piece
of equipment, you need a toolbox.
Some tools can be mounted on a silhouetted out-
line on a board in front of the workbench. That way, if
a tool is missing, you know which one it is, and when
using it, you know where to put it when you are fin-
ished with it. Pegboard or a piece of plywood with
cutouts attached and pegs on which to hang the tools
can be used.
Screwdrivers
These tools are often incorrectly used. They may be
used for opening paint cans, punching holes, and pry-
ing as well as their intended use. Keep in mind that the
right tool should be used for the job.
Screwdrivers are most often misused. Two types
of screwdrivers are encountered most common: the
Phillips-head and the standard or slot type. Screw-
drivers come in thousands of variations.
Generally, screwdrivers are available with either
wooden or plastic handles, but plastic is most common.
Plastic handles are very helpful when working around
electricity. Plastic is supposed to be shockproof if the
handle is kept clean and dry. The blade tip may vary in
size from 1/8 to 1/4 in. The shaft is 4 to 8 in. long and is
usually made of nickel-plated chrome-vanadium steel.
The tips or points must withstand force applied when a
screw sticks or is difficult to remove.
The main thing to remember when using a screw-
driver is to get a good fit between the tip of the screw-
driver and the slot in the screw. This will prevent
damage to both the screw head and the screwdriver.
Other types of screwdrivers are also available.
They are usually adapted for a particular purpose. The
main reason for changing the screw head from the slot
to some other type is to increase efficiency in getting
the driver into the screw head for positive mating and
more positive driving force. See Fig. 1-3 for other
types of screw-head configurations.

Pliers
There are a number of pliers available for special
jobs. The pliers shown in Fig. 1-4 are indicative of
the variety available for work in the electrical and
electronics field. Each of the pliers is designated a
particular job.
1. 4-in. midget for close work.
2. 4-in. plier for fast, clean tip cutting. It has a tapered
nose and nearly flush cutting edges and will cut to
the tip, producing burr-free cuts.

Numbering is not in sequential order

Hammers
As with other hand tools, there are a number of ham-
mer types. The three most common are best suited for
electricians or technicians. The claw hammer (Fig. 1-5)
is used to drive nails and to work mainly with wood; it
has claws with which to remove nails. It is the most
common type of hammer, but is used only occasion-
ally in most work where a ball-peen hammer is not
available.
The ball-peen hammer (Fig. 1-6) has a rounded top
and a flat, large-diameter bottom surface. It is used in
work around machineries.
In some cases, a mallet is needed to force a con-
nection or to make a slight adjustment. Mallets can be
obtained with either a soft face or a hard face. Leather,
plastic, rubber, wood, and lead mallets are used for var-
ious jobs, as the need arises (Fig. 1-7). In most in-
stances, a rubber mallet is used to enable you to do the
job without marring the surface of the metal being hit.
Keep in mind that you should be careful with your
hammer or mallet blows. Use eye protection.
CAUTION Hammers are perhaps the
most abused and misused of all hand
tools. Improper use of hammers can cause
injury. Use of damaged hammers can
cause injury. Use of hammers for jobs
other than those for which they have been
specifically designed can cause injury.
The following rules for proper use apply to all
hammers:
1. Strike square blows only. Avoid glancing blows.
2. Be sure striking face of the hammer is at least 3/8 in.
larger than tools to be struck (chisels, punches
wedges, etc.). The hammer face should be slightly
crowned with edges beveled.
3. Never use one hammer to strike another hammer.
4. Always use a hammer of the right size and weight
for the job.
5. Never strike with the side or “cheek” of a hammer.
6. Never use a hammer with a loose or damaged han-
dle. Replace the handle.
7. Discard any hammer having chips, cracks, dents,
mushrooming, or excessive wear. Replace the ham-
mer. DO NOT TRY TO REPAIR IT.
8. Always wear safety goggles to protect your eyes.
For instructions on safe use, see label on each hammer.

and bolt sizes and may range from 4 to 18 in. in length
for different types of work (Fig. 1-9). When adjustable
wrenches are used, there are two rules to remember:
1. Place the wrench on the nut or bolt so that the force
will be placed on the fixed jaw.
2. Tighten the adjustable jaw so that the wrench fits
the nut or bolt snugly (Fig. 1-10).
Nonadjustable wrenches have fixed openings to fit
nuts and bolt heads. Figure 1-11 shows a nonadjustable
open wrench, and Fig. 1-12 shows a nonadjustable box-
end wrench. These wrenches are available in sets and also
in metric sizes. Openings are usually 0.005 to 0.015 in.
larger than the size marked on the wrench to allow the
wrench to be slipped easily over the nut or bolt head.
Make sure, however, that the wrench fits the nut or bolt
Hacksaws
Hacksaws are very useful for cutting metal. Figure 1-8
shows a hacksaw blade being installed. The blade will
break if it is not properly inserted and tightened; so
once the blade is pointing in the right direction—away
from the handle—tighten it. Note that the cutting takes
place when the hacksaw is pushed away from the oper-
ator. Lift up on the saw when bringing it back to the
starting position. Riding the blade as it is drawn back
through the metal ruins the blade.
Blades come in 8-, 10-, and 12-in. lengths. The
hacksaw is usually adjustable to fit any of the three
blade lengths. Hacksaw blades also come in a number
of tooth sizes. Use 14-teeth-per-inch blades for cutting
1-in. or thicker sections of cast iron, machine steel,
brass, copper, aluminum, bronze, or slate. Use 18-
tooth-per-inch blades for cutting 1/4- to 1-in.-thick sec-
tions of annealed tool steel, high-speed steel, rail,
bronze, aluminum, light structural shapes, and copper.
The 24-tooth-per-inch blade is used for cutting 1/8- to
1/4-in.-thick section of materials. It is usually best for
iron, steel, brass, and copper tubing, wrought iron pipe,
drill rod, conduit, light structural shapes, and metal
trim. The 32-tooth-per-inch blade is used for cutting
material similar to that recommended for 24-tooth-per-
inch blades.
Wrenches
Wrenches are used to tighten and loosen nuts and bolts.
Two general types of wrenches are adjustable and non-
adjustable wrenches. Adjustable wrenches have one
jaw that can be adjusted to accommodate different nut

head properly (Fig. 1-13); otherwise, the nut or bolt head
may get damaged. It is safer to pull than to push a
wrench. If you exert pressure on a wrench and the nut or
bolt head suddenly breaks loose, there is a chance that
you will injure your hand. If the wrench must be pushed
rather than pulled, use the palm of the hand so that the
knuckles will not be injured if there is a slip.
Allen Wrenches
Allen wrenches are designed to be
used with headless screws. These screws are used in
many devices such as setscrews (Fig. 1-14). Allen
wrenches come in a variety of sizes to fit any number
of setscrews (Fig. 1-15). A complete set is especially
helpful in motor work.
Another type of recessed setscrew head has an
Allen-type hole, but ridges in each flat side make it dif-
ficult for an Allen wrench to fit. Newer hex-socket key
sets are made in 3/32 to 1/4-in. sizes with 8 blades in a set
(Fig. 1-16).
Socket Wrenches
Socket wrenches may be used in
locations that are not easily accessible to the box-end
or open-end wrench. Sockets are easily taken off the
ratchet and replaced with another size. Sockets come in
both a 12-point and a 6-point arrangement. Make sure
that you use the proper size for each nut or bolt head.
Socket wrenches are also available in metric sizes.
Figure 1-17 shows some sockets, extensions, flexible
handles, and universal joints that make sockets effec-
tive in almost any location.
Torque Wrenches
Torque wrenches, which are de-
signed to apply proper torque to various bolts and nuts,
are made to fit various socket drives. Two popular sizes
of torque wrenches are the 3/8-in. drive and the 1/2-in.
drive. Torque wrenches are made to measure in pound

Some bearing removals need a different approach.
The pulley or gear puller can, in some instances, be
used to remove a bearing that has stuck on the motor
shaft. These pullers come in a variety of sizes and
styles (Fig. 1-21).
inches (lb-in.) and in pound feet (lb-ft).* Use the proper
wrench for the torque that has to be applied. The
wrenches come in various handle lengths. Normally,
the longer the wrench, the greater the torque the
wrench will measure. A typical torque wrench is shown
in Fig. 1-18.
Nut Drivers
The nut driver is nothing more than a socket attached to
a screwdriver handle. It is an excellent tool for most on-
the-bench work. Nut drivers come in a variety of sizes
and usually have the size stamped on the handle. Some-
times they are color coded according to size. Figure 1-19
shows a set of nut drivers.
Tools for Bearings and Bushings
In motor repair, it is sometimes necessary to remove a
bearing from the end bell of a motor. A bearing tool
(Fig. 1-20) makes this task somewhat easier. The set
illustrated has nine adapters that easily and quickly
remove or insert any sleeve motor bearing or bushing
with a 1/2- to 1-in. inside diameter. A bearing tool elim-
inates the chance of broken bearings or end bells.
Bushing tools have been designed for removing or
inserting bushings in motors. They are handy time-
savers. A complete set usually consists of 20 pieces: the
box, 3 drivers, and 16 adapters of lengths varying from
3/8 to 1 in. (Fig. 1-22).

*The term in.-lb and ft-lb were formally used for torque. Recently they have
been more accurately stated as lb-in. and lb-ft.

Solderless Connector Crimper
The solderless connector crimper (Fig. 1-23) is very
useful in motor work. It takes a good connection to
withstand the vibration of a motor. A number of con-
tactors have been designed for electrical work. The tool
and kit of connectors and lugs of various sizes are
available at most electrical supply houses.
Soldering Iron
The soldering iron (Fig. 1-24) comes in handy when it
is necessary to make a solder connection that will take
vibration and withstand corrosion. Soldering irons of
about 15 watts (W) to over 600 W are available in the
market. The best all-purpose soldering iron for use in
the shop is about 100 W. This will do the job in most
cases where larger wires are involved. The small 15-W
irons are very useful in electronics work on printed cir-
cuit boards.
SOLDERING GUN
The soldering gun (Fig. 1-25) is very handy for making
quick disconnects of soldered joints. Cold solder joints
result when the operator heats the tip, places solder on
it, and then lets the solder cool on the joint. The wires
being soldered on the metal surface and the wire being
connected to it must be heated up to the temperature
sufficient to melt the solder. This means that the gun
must be left in one spot long enough to cause the joint
to be heated to the temperature needed to melt the sol-
der. The secret is to heat the material, not the solder.
Do not hold the soldering gun tip on the joint too
long. You do not want the soldering gun tip to overheat
the printed circuit board, or the copper strip will lift up
from the board.
Fuse Puller
Fuse pullers are made of phenolic material that has
been shaped so that you can pull at least two sizes of
fuse with them. A fuse puller catches the round body of
the fuse and allows you to extract the fuse from its
holder, without coming in contact with the live circuit
(Fig. 1-27).
Wire Gages
Wire gages are needed to measure wire size. The num-
bers on the gage (Fig. 1-26) tell you the size of the
wire. Keep in mind, however, that wire with Formvar
insulation will read one size larger. Keep in mind also
that the wire is moved through the slit in the gage. The
hole is there to pass the wire through. The slot does the
measuring. Pull the wire free of the slot and through
the hole. Decimal equivalents are usually stamped on
the metal disk on the opposite side of the gage num-
bers. Every toolbox needs a wire gage.

Fish Tape
For pulling wires through conduit and walls, or into
junction boxes, fish tape is essential (Fig. 1-30).
Cable Stripper
A larger-gage wire (cable) has to be stripped for a T-tap
or mid-span strip. In most instances, a cable stripper is
used for stripping insulation so that placing lugs on the
end of the wire or cable is much easier. Figure 1-31
shows how the stripper can be used to strip insulation
from a conductor without scoring.
Tachometer
To check the speed of rotation of an electric motor, it is
best to use a handheld tachometer, which is available in
both analog and digital forms representing speed in
revolutions per minute (rpm) (Fig. 1-28). The tachome-
ter is a very useful device for measuring motor speed. It
can help locate possible problems and can indicate
if a motor is operating as it should after it has been
repaired.
The shaft speed will read out in digital form in the
tachometer as shown in Fig. 1-28. The tachometer can
be placed on the open end of a motor shaft, or it can be
used on motors, saws, compressors, fans, pumps,
grinders, and other equipment. A cone-shaped tip is
used for shafts with center holes; a cup-shaped tip is
used for flat-end shafts. Tachometers that use a strobe
light to detect the number of revolutions per minute are
available, but they are somewhat more expensive.
Knockout Punch
Knockout punches come in many sizes. They are used
to make holes in metal boxes for enclosures of various
control devices. They range from a simple punch that
uses wrenches to large hydraulic units utilized to punch
holes in very heavy gage metals (Fig. 1-29).

Cable Cutter
Hand-operated cable cutters are used to make a
shear-type cut for large-size wire. Long fiberglass
handles give leverage. A cable cutter can cut cables
up to 750 MCM (750,000 circular mils)† (Fig. 1-32).
The clean cut that results makes it easier to fit cable
ends into lugs.
Electrician’s Knives
The jack knife (Fig. 1-33) is used to cut insulation.
Every toolbox should have a handy jack knife with
very sharp blades. Another knife that comes in handy
for the electrician or anyone working around electrical
equipment is the skinning knife (Fig. 1-34). This knife
fits in the toolbox or in the tool pouch with the proper
cover.
Other Tools
Other tools that may be useful on the job are a flash-
light, digital camera, polarized receptacle tester, wire
markers, and various wire-pulling apparatus and
threading tools for rigid conduit. A heavy-duty electric
drill or one with hammer action to drill through con-
crete is also handy. Various tools will come to mind as
you develop your workshop or toolbox. As different
situations arise on the job, you will be better equipped
to know which tools to invest in. Keep in mind that
your tools are an investment. Mark them with your
name or the name of your company.
ELECTRICAL TOOLS
There are a number of electrical instruments that are
needed for the motor repair technician to install and
maintain motors and their controls. Everything from a
simple VOM to an oscilloscope is needed to perform
various tests and to increase the efficiency of the trouble
shooter.

Megohmmeter
The megohmmeter is usually referred to as a megger.
The megger shown in Fig. 1-36 has ranges for measur-
ing insulation resistances of motors, compressors, con-
ductors, or anything else that needs measuring. It can
also read continuity and can measure low resistances of
motor windings.
Test voltage is generated by a hand crank. This
means that the megger does not require any other
power source and is therefore always ready for use.
The ohmmeter range of the unit illustrated is especially
well suited for measuring the resistance of motor wind-
ings and other low resistances. The guard terminal
eliminates the effect of any surface leakage that may
influence a reading. The megger comes with a manual
that shows how to use it for various purposes.
Voltage Tester
The voltage tester is a handy device that checks 
10 ac/dc voltage levels. It fits in a shirt pocket. The
lighted windows indicate the voltage level, which
enables it to be easily read in dimly lighted areas. The
coiled lead cord extends to 50 in. A test button distin-
guishes normal readings from those due to distributed
capacitance or high-resistance leakage. The voltage
tester is also helpful in checking out 115-V ac
grounded convenience outlets, and will operate on 25
to 800 Hz (Fig. 1-37).
Portable Ammeter and Voltmeter
The clamp-on type of ammeter and voltmeter has
extended leads with replaceable probe tips that make
voltage reading easy and fast. The clamp-on jaw goes
around a conductor of 1-in. diameter, 500-MCM or
2-in. diameter, or 2000-MCM diameter to take the
current reading without interrupting the service. One
hand operation is possible: Open the jaws, change
ranges, and read the current. The meter comes in 
a handy, sturdy case to protect it while not in use
(Fig. 1-35).

Volt-Ohm-Milliammeter (VOM)
The volt-ohm-milliammeter, usually called a VOM, is
available in many sizes designed to read many ranges.
VOMs check out voltages, currents, and resistances.
They are portable and contain a battery to power the re-
sistance checking ranges. Most are also capable of test-
ing capacitors and inductances as well as decibels
(Figs. 1-38 and 1-39). A flip-open carrying case makes
it easy to store and provides a place for lead storage so
that you know where they are the next time you need
the meter.
Digital Logic Probe
The digital logic probe has become a necessity in trou-
bleshooting programmable controllers and other
equipment that uses computer logic to switching or se-
quencing. It is a quick way to peek inside TTL, LSI,
and CMOS digital circuits.‡ The probe shown in Fig. 1-40
has color-coded light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to indi-
cate high, low, or pulsed logic states (up to 10 MHz). It
puts out a tone that really speeds up the testing.
The next order of business involves the operation of
the probe and what it indicates at various points in the
test procedure. Typical signals and corresponding LED
indications are shown in Fig. 1-40. To operate the probe,
apply power to it by connecting the black clip to ground
or as the English say, earth (). Connect the red clip to
the Vcc, (). Make sure that the voltage is less than 20 V.
The TTL/CMOS switch can be switched to TTL
mode for use in TTL circuits. The TTL logic 1 thresh-
old is 2.3  0.2 V; the logic 0 threshold is 0.8  0.2 V.
When switching to CMOS mode, the CMOS logic 1
threshold is 70% Vcc; the logic 0 threshold is 30% Vcc.
The logic probe can also detect and memorize the level
transition. Either positive or negative level transition
can be detected or memorized, depending on the mode
(pulse/memory) selected. On the PULSE position, the
memory function is inoperative. Input state transition
is “0” to “1”; or “1” to “0” will activate the pulse indi-
cator (flicker for 500 ms) and will generate a chop
sound for the beeper. On the MEMORY position, the
memory function is activated. The pulse indicator
lights and a beeper generates sound until reset if any
pulse or level transition occurs.
The beeper generates sound when the red or green
LED lights. Some typical combinations of indications
from the probe are shown in the table of typical signals
in Fig. 1-40.
Continuity Tester
Whenever an ohmmeter is not available or handy, it is
convenient to use the continuity tester, since the tester
is usually carried in the toolbox or on the tool belt. The
tester is a simple device consisting of a battery, lamp,
and probe, with another lead to complete the circuit
and light the lamp to indicate a complete path for cur-
rent flow. It can be used for testing for opens, shorts, or
continuity (Fig. 1-41).
Polarized Plug Tester
There are a number of plug-in devices to indicate if a
circuit has the proper ground and if the hot side of the
receptacle is where it is supposed to be. Figure 1-42
shows one of these plug-in devices and how the read-
out in the LEDs indicates the various conditions of the
circuit.

Recorder
The strip recorder comes in handy to check out line
voltages that may vary under a number of conditions
that are not easily checked. The recorder can be placed
on the line and will record variations in line voltages
over a long period of time. Knowing when the varia-
tions occur aids in locating a number of problems. The
recorder shown in Fig. 1-43A monitors voltage condi-
tions over a wide variety of ranges. It helps pinpoint
over-voltage conditions, which shorten lamp and
motor life, and under-voltage conditions, which affect
oven, tool, and lighting output. The ammeter-type
recorder (Fig. 1-43B), which uses the split-core trans-
former principle for clamp-on transducers, simply
clamps around the conductor in which the current is to
be measured. There is no need to interrupt the service.
With this ammeter-type device, you can monitor all
three phases; in conjunction with a voltmeter-type
recorder, it can be utilized to check out when various
power surges occur and can aid in regulating placement
of various machines on the line at the most economical
time for power consumption.
Oscilloscope
The oscilloscope (Fig. 1-44A) is also a voltage-
indicating device. It shows the shape of power being
used. It can aid in tracing pulses on the line that may
cause timing problems with programmable controllers
or other computer-operated machines. By using a
function reference signal generator, such as that shown
in Fig. 1-44B, with an oscilloscope, it is possible to
properly adjust and tune the stability circuit of a high-gain
motor drive and regulators. The appropriate stability

allows the operator to select the strobe and find the rate
for stop-motion analysis. The balance/analyze mode
allows the model to be tuned to specific frequencies for
signature analysis and balancing purposes. Although
this analyzer is a very expensive instrument, it is usu-
ally worth its price in locating and eliminating prob-
lems caused by vibration and off-balance loads.
SPECIAL TOOLS FOR SPECIFIC
JOBS
Printed Circuit Board Puller
Motor controls are sometimes incorporated into
printed circuit boards and mounted into racks. Extreme
caution must be taken when installing or removing
boards because some boards are extremely sensi-
tive to static electricity discharges. The printed cir-
cuit board puller shown in Fig. 1-47 clamps firmly
onto the circuit board. It is covered with plastic to
prevent physical damage to the board, and its use
prevents you from touching the board while remov-
ing it.
circuits can be optimized by using a step function into
the regulator and observing the feedback loop output
with an oscilloscope or chart recorder.
Phase Sequence Adapter
The phase sequence adapter (Fig. 1-45) is used in con-
junction with any Amprobe volt/ammeter or other volt-
meter with appropriate ac range. It permits you to
determine the phase sequence of any electrical equip-
ment using three-phase lines up to 550 V, 25 to 60 Hz.
The carrying case and manual are included.
Balance Analyzer
The balance analyzer (Fig. 1-46) has a digital meter
that provides readings of displacement, velocity, and
acceleration in the vibration mode. The strobe mode

Wire Wrap/Unwrap Tool
Soldering is not the only way that wire terminations are
made at present. Wire wrapping provides fast, secure
electrical connections without soldering. Wire wrap-
ping and unwrapping tools (Fig. 1-48) are made of
case-hardened steel for long life. They are hand oper-
ated, so there is no need for air or electrical supply.
This method of termination eliminates wire crystalliza-
tion due to soldering heat and subsequent fracturing
from on-the-job vibration. The tool shown can handle
18- to 22-gage wire.
Conduit Benders
Conduit benders take the guesswork out of this job.
Benders have built-in benchmark symbols, degree
scales, and multiplier scales. An arrow points to the
beginning of a bend; a star indicates back-of-bend
locations. A teardrop symbol indicates the exact center
of a 45° bend.
Benders for 1/2-in. EMT also have a cast-in offset
formula and multiplier, providing instant, on-the-spot
information for making accurate offset-angle bends
(Fig. 1-49).
PVC Cutters
Cutting PVC plastic has traditionally been done using a
backsaw. This saw cut can be rather ragged when fin-
ished, because the kerf of the saw blade is designed for
cutting wood. Making clean, burr-free cuts through PVC
is a quick, simple task with specially designed cutters.
They use ratchet action for maximum cutting power
with very little effort (Fig. 1-50). The one shown in the
figure is only 9 in. long, so it can fit in the toolbox or can
be hung on the tool pouch. It will cut 1/4- to 11/4-in.
PVC. Just open the handles completely, place the con-
duit in the lower jaw hook, and alternately squeeze and
release the handles, letting the ratchet action do the work
until the shear is complete. By using a cutter with longer
handles, it is possible to cut 1/2- to 2-in. PVC as easily as
the short-handled cutter cuts smaller diameters. The ad-
vantage of this type of cutter is reduction in pipe defor-
mation and the possibility of PVC conduit cracking
during cutting. A clean cut is also obtained. The blades
can easily be replaced when they become dull.

Cable Benders
Some cables require a great deal of effort to bend to fit
their intended placement. The forged one-piece ben-
der has been made of steel to meet the demands for
such a tool designed to aid in the bending operation
(Fig. 1-51). The head is bent at 22° for ease in bending
the cable in tight, hard-to-access places. A 7/8-in.
opening will allow inserting cables up to 300-MCM
capacity. A 11/64-in. opening is used for cables up to
500-MCM capacity. The handle is plastic coated and
contoured for good gripping action. For easier bends,
two benders should be used.
Conduit Reamer
The conduit reamer (Fig. 1-52) locks onto a screw-
driver, and reams and de-burrs 1/2-; 3/4-, and 1-in. thin-
wall conduit ends. The smooth ends protect wire being
pulled through the conduit, which permits correct
installation of fittings. The conduit reamer reams in-
side and outside at the same time. Two setscrews hold
it tightly on round or square screwdriver shanks. The
reamer can be left on the screwdriver for normal use.
The steel cutting blade is replaceable to keep it cutting
easily.

NOTE: A heart that is in fibrillation can-
not be restricted by closed-chest car-
diac massage. A special device called
a defibrillator is available in some med-
ical facilities and ambulance services.
Muscular contractions are so severe with 200 mA
and above that the heart is forcibly clamped during the
shock. Clamping prevents the heart from going into
ventricular fibrillation, making the victim’s chances for
survival better.

Working with electricity can be dangerous. However,
electricity can be safe if properly respected.

After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
1. List safety measures for working safely on the job. 
2. List values associated with the use of ground-fault
circuit interrupters (GFCIs).
3. Identify conditions that lead to overloads, short
circuits, and blown fuses.

11. Use motors and generators safely.
12. Select proper equipment for doing a job safely.
13. Explain the need for proper grounding of electri-
cal equipment.
Safety concerns everyone working with you as well as
yourself. Working safely is of great concern for all
who work around electricity and electrical equipment.
Most fatal electrical shocks happen to people who
should know better. Below we provide some electro-
medical facts that should make you think twice before
taking chances. For a safe workplace you have to think
before you act. Working safely involves a number of
considerations. Before working around motors that re-
quire large currents and usually operate on very high
voltages, there are a number of things of which you
should be aware.
ELECTRICAL SHOCK
It is not the voltage but the current that kills. People
have been killed by 110 V in the home and also with as
little as 42-V direct current (dc). The real measure of a
shock’s intensity lies in the amount of current (in mil-
liamperes) forced through the body, not in the voltage.
Any electrical device used on a house wiring circuit
can, under certain conditions, transmit a fatal current.
Since you do not know how much current went
through the body in an accident, it is necessary to
perform artificial respiration to try to get the person
breathing again, or if the heart is not beating, perform
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
Fig. 2-1
Ground-fault protection system. (Westinghouse)

(NEC) has required installation of GFCIs in outdoor
and bathroom outlets in new construction, but most
homes built before then have no GFCI protection.
Ground-fault protection is also available for installa-
tion in motor control centers and high-voltage starters.
The ground-fault protection shown in Figs. 2-1 and
2-2 consists of a ground-fault relay and a current sen-
sor. Two types of relays are available from Westing-
house. Type GR operates instantaneously and fulfills
the basic need for fast, sensitive ground-fault detection.
Type GRT incorporates a time delay and is adjustable
from instantaneous to 36 cycles (0.6 second at 60 Hz).
Both relays employ reliable solid-state circuits and are
self-powered by fault current.
Current sensors are window current transformer-
type devices through which the cable or bus of all phases
is run. Various “window” sizes are available for a wide
variety of applications. Relay contacts are available on
relays both tripped open for application in standard
contactor holding coil circuits and tripped closed for
mechanically latched contactors.
Safety Devices
Electricity can create conditions almost certain to
result in bodily harm, property damage, or both. It is
important for those who work with or around electricity
to understand the hazards involved when they are work-
ing around electrical power tools, maintaining electrical
equipment, or installing equipment for electrical
operation. Available safety devices are essentially over
current devices: specifically, fuses and circuit breakers
as well as GFCIs.
Circuit Protection
Electrical distribution systems are often quite compli-
cated. They cannot be absolutely fail-safe. Circuits
are subject to destructive over currents. Harsh envi-
ronments, general deterioration, accidental damage or
damage from natural causes, excessive expansion, or
overloading of the electrical distribution system are
factors that contribute to the occurrence of over cur-
rents. Reliable protective devices prevent or minimize
costly damage to transformers, conductors, motors,
and the many other components and loads that make
up the complete distribution system. 
Reliable circuit protection is essential to avoid the se-
vere monetary losses that can result from power blackouts
and prolonged downtime of facilities. It is the need for re-
liable protection, safety, and freedom, from fire hazards
that have made the fuse a widely used protective device.
Over currents
An over current is either an overload current or a short-cir-
cuit current. The overload current is an excessive current
relative to normal operating current but one that is con-
fined to the normal conductive paths provided by the con-
ductors and other components and loads of the distribution
system. As the name implies, a short-circuit current is one
that flows outside the normal conducting paths.
Overloads
Overloads are most often between one and six times
the normal current level. Usually, overloads are caused
by harmless temporary surge-currents. They may occur
when motors are started or transformers are energized.
Such overload currents or transients are normal occur-
rences. Since they are of brief duration, any tempera-
ture rise is trivial and has no harmful effect on the
circuit components. It is important to ensure that pro-
tective devices do not react to them.
Continuous overloads can result from defective
motors (such as worn motor bearings), overloaded
equipment, or too many loads on one circuit. Such sus-
tained overloads are destructive and must be cut off by
protective devices before they damage the distribution
system or system loads. However, since they are of rela-
tively low magnitude compared to short-circuit currents,
removal of the overload current within a few seconds
will generally prevent equipment damage. A sustained
overload current results in overheating of conductors
and other components and will cause deterioration

of insulation, which may eventually result in severe
damage and short circuits if not interrupted.
Short Circuits
Overload currents usually occur at rather modest levels;
the short circuit or fault current can be many hundreds
of times larger than the normal operating current. A
high-level fault may be 50,000 A or larger. If not cut off
within a matter of a few milliseconds, damage and de-
struction can become rampant. There can be 
• severe insulation damage 
• melting of conductors
• metal vaporization
• ionization of gases
• arcing 
• fire
Simultaneous high-level, short-circuit currents can
develop huge magnetic field stresses. The magnetic
forces between bus bars and other conductors can be
many hundreds of pounds per lineal foot; even heavy
bracing may not be adequate to keep them from being
warped or distorted beyond repair.
Fuses
The fuse is a reliable over current protective device. The
fundamental element of the basic fuse is a fusible link or
links encapsulated in a tube and connected to contact
terminals. The link’s electrical resistance is so low that it
simply acts as a conductor. However, when destructive
currents occur, the link very quickly melts and opens the
circuit to protect the conductor and other circuit compo-
nents and loads. Fuse characteristics are stable. Fuses do
not require periodic maintenance or testing. Fuses have
three unique performance characteristics:
1. They are safe. Fuses have a high interrupting rating,
which means that they can withstand very high fault
currents without rupturing.
2. Properly applied fuses prevent blackouts. Only the
fuse nearest to a fault opens without up-stream
fuses (feeders or mains) being affected—fuses thus
provide selective coordination.
3. Fuses provide optimum component protection by keep-
ing fault currents to a low value. They limit current.
Voltage Rating
Most low-voltage power distribution
fuses have 250- or 600-V ratings (others have ratings
of 125 V and 300 V). The voltage rating of a fuse must
at least equal the circuit voltage. It can be higher but
can never be lower. The voltage rating determines the
ability of the fuse to suppress the internal arcing that
occurs after a fuse link melts and an arc is produced. If
a fuse is used with a voltage rating lower than the
circuit voltage, arc suppression will be impaired, and
under some fault current conditions, the fuse may not
safely clear the over current.
Ampere Rating
Fuses have ampere ratings. In select-
ing the ampacity of a fuse, consideration must be given
to the type of load and code requirements. The ampere
rating of a fuse should normally not exceed the current-
carrying capacity of the circuit. There are some specific
circumstances where the ampere rating is permitted to
be greater than the current-carrying capacity of the
fuse. A typical example is a motor circuit. The dual-
element fuse can be sized up to 175% and non–time-
delay fuses up to 300% of the motor full-load amperes
(Fig. 2-3). Generally, the ampere rating of a fuse and
switch combination should be selected at 125% of the
load current (this usually corresponds to the circuit
capacity, which is also selected at 125% of the load
current). There are exceptions, such as when the fuse-
switch combination is approved for continuous opera-
tion at 100% of its rating.

The Code is purely advisory as far as the NFPA
(National Fire Protection Association) and ANSI
(American National Standards Institute) are con-
cerned but is offered for use in law and for regulatory
purposes in the interest of life and property protection.
Anyone noticing any errors is asked to notify the
NFPA executive office, the chairman, and the secre-
tary of the committee.
Underwriters Laboratories
Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (UL) was founded in
1894. William Henry Merrill came to Chicago to test the
installation of Thomas Edison’s new incandescent elec-
tric light at the Columbian Exposition. He later started
UL as a laboratory where insurance companies could test
products for electrical and fire hazards. It continued as a
testing laboratory for insurance underwriters until 1917.
It then became an independent, self-supporting, safety-
testing laboratory. The National Board of Fire Under-
writers (now the American Insurance Association)
continued as sponsors of UL until 1968. At that time,
sponsorship and membership were broadened to include
representatives of consumer interests, governmental bod-
ies or agencies, education, public safety bodies, public
utilities, and the insurance industry, in addition to safety
and standardization experts. UL has expanded its testing
services to more than 13,000 manufacturers throughout
the world. Over 1 billion UL labels are used each year on
products listed by Underwriters laboratories.
UL is chartered as a not-for-profit organization
without capital stock, under the laws of the state of
Delaware, to establish, maintain, and operate laborato-
ries for the examination and testing of devices, sys-
tems, and materials. Its stated objectives are “By
scientific investigation, study, experiments and tests, to
determine the relation of various materials, devices,
products, equipment, constructions, methods and sys-
tems to hazards appurtenant thereto or to the use
thereof, affecting life and property, and to ascertain,
define and publish standards, classifications and speci-
fications for materials, devices, equipment, construc-
tion, methods and systems affecting such hazards, and
other information tending to reduce and prevent loss of
life and property from such hazards.”
The corporate headquarters, together with one of
the testing laboratories, is located on West Street in
Northbrook, Illinois; Melville, New York; Santa Clara,
California; and Tampa, Florida.
Underwriters Laboratories has a total staff of over
2000 employees. More than 700 persons are engaged
in engineering work, and of this number, approxi-
mately 425 are graduate engineers. Supplementing the
engineering staff are more than 500 factory inspectors.
ELECTRICAL CODES
Thomas Edison’s first electric station could transmit
electricity only 5000 ft. Modern power pools enable a
customer to use electricity produced in a power plant
many states away. Early generators had a power-
producing capacity of only 100 kW, but generators
with the ability to produce millions of kilowatts are
now in operation. Since 1900 transmission voltages
have increased from 30,000 V to 500,000 V, and lines
of up to 765,000 V are now in operation.
In the early 1880s the New York Board of Fire
Underwriters were concerned with the new method of
electric lighting proposed by Thomas Edison. Although
he did not realize the danger of the giant force that he
was helping to create, the New York Board recognized
that unless proper precautions were followed, the new
method of lighting could prove to be as hazardous as the
open flame that it was replacing. In 1881, one person
was appointed to inspect every electrical installation be-
fore power was turned on. This was the beginning of the
Electrical Department of the New York Board. It was
necessary for the inspector to check not only the instal-
lation within the building but to carry the investigation
back to the power station, then only one or two blocks
distant. At that time, the board investigated the safety of
the entire power system and required the power compa-
nies to make weekly tests for grounds and open circuits
and report to the board the results of their tests. In 1882,
the Committee of Surveys drew up a set of safe-guards
for arc and incandescent lighting, which was the fore-
runner of the present National Electrical Code.
National Electrical Codes
The National Electrical Code is the most widely
adopted code in the world. The combined sales of its
handbooks are over 1 million copies each time it is pub-
lished, which is once every three years. The National
Electrical Code is a nationally accepted guide for the
safe installation of electrical conductors and equipment
and is, in fact, the basis for all electrical codes used in
the United States. It is also used extensively outside the
United States, particularly where American-made equip-
ment is installed. No electrician should be caught with-
out a copy in the toolbox.
The National Electrical Code Handbook is published
by the National Fire Protection Association to assist those
concerned with electrical safety in understanding the in-
tent of the new edition of the Code. A verbatim reproduc-
tion of the new National Electrical Code is included, and
added where necessary are comments, diagrams, and il-
lustrations that are intended to clarify further some of the
intricate requirements of the Code.
Electrical Codes

The engineering functions are divided among these six
departments:
Burglary protection and signaling
Casualty and chemical hazards
Electricity
Fire protection
Heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration
Marine equipment
The electrical department is the largest of the six
engineering departments. Safety evaluations are made
on hundreds of different types of appliances for use in
homes, commercial buildings, schools, and factories.
The scope of the work in this department includes elec-
trical construction materials that are used in buildings
to distribute electrical power from the meter location to
the electrical load.
Underwriters Laboratories publishes annual lists
of manufacturers whose products have met UL safety
requirements. These lists are kept up-to-date by quar-
terly supplements. Eleven lists are published each year.
UL presently publishes more than 300 Standards for
Safety for materials, devices, constructions, and meth-
ods. Copies of these are available to interested persons,
and a free catalog is available.
For your own safety, the products you are using to
wire a house, building, or installation of any kind
should be marked “UL” (Fig. 2-4).
Products certified by CSA are eligible to bear the
CSA certification mark. Misuse of the mark may result
in suspension or cancellation of certification. CSA may
resort to legal action to protect its registered trademark
in the event of abuse. Figure 2-5 shows the CSA mark.
In addition, CSA information tags and other markings
are made available for certified products and their con-
tainers, to supplement the CSA mark.
Standards in Other Countries
Other countries also have standards and testing labora-
tories. Figure 2-6 shows some of the marking used by
other countries.

Canadian Standards
Association
The Canadian organization that parallels UL is the
Canadian Standards Association (CSA). However,
CSA has more authority to remove from the market
products that do not meet standards; the UL program is
strictly voluntary. If an electrical product (or in some
cases, another type of product) used in Canada is
connected in any way with the consumption of power
from the electrical sources owned by the provinces,
that product must have CSA approval. This is a mea-
sure in the interest of public safety.

FIRE EXTINGUISHERS
Fire extinguishers are limited in their application. They
are used to control small fires that are identified
properly by the person selecting the extinguishers.
Extinguishers are made for various uses. Needless to
say, the water type is not useful for electrical fires.
Electrical fires are classified as class C. Class C fires
are described as those dealing with energized electrical
equipment, where the electrical nonconductivity of the
extinguishing medium is of importance. Electrical fires
call for carbon dioxide, dry chemicals, multipurpose
dry-chemical, and Halon-1211 types of extinguishers
(Fig. 2-7).
SAFE WORKING PRACTICES
Safety equipment is available for use by the electrician
or anyone working with electric motors. In most in-
stances a person working in a commercial or industrial
location will need steel-toed shoes, a hard hat, goggles,
or a face shield. Fuse pullers are insulated to protect the
user, but must be handled properly. Using pliers and
cutting equipment can be harmful if certain common-
sense rules are not followed.
TOOL SAFETY
Some precautions to be observed when using pliers:
1. Never cut any wire or metal unless your eyes are
protected. Safety goggles or other protective equip-
ment are an absolute necessity. It is easy to forget to
OSHA
The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) of
1970 sets uniform national requirements for safety in
the workplace—anywhere that people are employed.
Originally, OSHA adopted the 1971 NEC as rules for
electrical safety. The involved process for modifying
a federal law such as OSHA made it impossible for
the act to adopt each new NEC revision, as the code
is amended every three years. To avoid this problem,
the OSHA administration in 1981 adopted its own
code, a condensed version of the NEC containing
only those provisions considered related to occupa-
tional safety. OSHA was amended to adopt this code,
based on the NFPA standard 70E, Part 1, which is
now federal law.
Equipment Standards
Equipment standards have been established by the
National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA).
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is
another standards source. Underwriters Laboratory
(UL) has standards that equipment must meet before
UL will list or label it. Most jurisdictions and OSHA
require that where equipment listed as safe by a recog-
nized laboratory is available, unlisted equipment may
not be used. UL is by far the most widely accepted na-
tional laboratory, although Factory Mutual Insurance
Company lists some equipment, and a number of
other testing laboratories have been recognized and
accepted. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE) publishes a number of books (the
“color book” series) on recommended practices for the
design of industrial buildings, commercial buildings,
emergency power systems, grounding, and the like.
Some of these IEEE standards have been adopted as
ANSI standards. They are excellent guides, although
they are not in any way mandatory.
OSHA Color Code
In order to establish a safe environment for everyone,
OSHA has standardized some colors for specific appli-
cations. Red, yellow, orange, purple, and green have
been chosen to indicate various locations, machines,
and devices.
• Red
• Fire protection equipment and apparatus
• Portable containers of flammable liquids
• Emergency stop buttons and switches

Safety in the Workplace
Working Clothes
Clothes worn on the job should be selected to protect
you while you work. Of course, everyone will not work
under the same conditions; therefore, some general
safety tips will be mentioned here. Others may present
themselves as you work in a specific area.
1. Wear head protection—a hardhat if the job requires
it. Long hair should be concealed and not allowed to
move freely. Short hair is preferred for personal
safety.
2. Wear goggles or tempered glasses or both. 
3. Do not wear a tie.
4. Wear long-sleeved shirts with the cuffs tightly but-
toned near the wrists.
5. Wear your trousers tucked into your safety shoes or
tightly fastened near the ankles.
6. Do not wear rings, earrings, necklaces, or bracelets.
7. Wear safety shoes. These should have an arch sup-
port and steel-tipped or safety toes. Soles should be
such as not to slip on oily or wet surfaces. Wear rub-
ber boots in wet or damp locations.
Disconnects
Electrical shock can be prevented if the circuit is not
“live” when you are working on it or any equipment
wear them. It is a big bother to put them on for “just
one cut.” You have heard all the reasons and ex-
cuses. But none of them make any sense. They are
all part of the lazy person’s way, not the profes-
sional’s way—the safe way.
2. Never cut any wire or metal unless your fellow
workers’ eyes are also protected. Although you may
not have heard that precaution before, you’ll see that
it makes sense. The wire that does not get you may
get someone else. So think about others as well as
yourself.
3. Never depend on plastic-dipped handles to insulate
you from electricity. Plastic-dipped handles are for
comfort and a firmer grip. They are not intended for
protection against electric shock.
4. Always wear protective goggles!
Using Hammers Properly
There are some precautions that should be observed
when using hammers on the job. Hammers are perhaps
the most abused—and misused—of all hand tools. Im-
proper use of hammers can cause injury. Use of dam-
aged hammers can cause injury, as can use of hammers
for jobs other than those for which they were specifi-
cally designed.
There are some basic rules for the proper use of
hammers:
• Strike square blows only. Avoid glancing blows.
• Make sure that the striking face of the hammer is at
least 8 in. larger than tools to be struck (chisels,
punches, wedges, and the like). The face should be
slightly crowned with the edges beveled.
• Never use a hammer to strike another hammer.
Always use a hammer of the right size and weight for
the job.
• Never strike with the side or “cheek” of a hammer.
• Never use a hammer with a loose or damaged handle.
Replace the handle.
• Discard any hammer having chips, cracks, dents,
mushrooming, or excessive wear. Replace the ham-
mer. Do not try to repair it.
• Always wear safety goggles to protect your eyes
(Fig. 2-8).
The professional takes both the job and tools se-
riously. The right tool for a job means saved time
and professional results. Using tools safely also
means saving time and getting the job done properly.
There is only one way to do a job right and that is the
safe way.
Fig. 2-8
(A) General-purpose cover-type protective goggles are
made of soft vinyl plastic. This type protects the eyes from all an-
gles. (B) For more protection you may want to add a hardhat and
face shield as a combination safety step while working in haz-
ardous locations. (Klein)

connected to the circuit. Remove the power. Remove
the fuse or disconnect. If it has a lockout feature, make
sure that it is used—that the lock is locked and you
have the key.
Report to your supervisor any unsafe conditions
observed. Keep in mind both your own safety and that
of others.
Using Motors and Generators
Safely
The use of electric motors and generators, like that of
all other utilization of concentrated power, is poten-
tially hazardous. The degree of hazard can be greatly
reduced by proper design, selection, installation, and
use, but hazards cannot be completely eliminated.
The reduction of hazards is the joint responsibility of
the user, the manufacturer of the driven or driving
equipment, and the manufacturer of the motor or
generator.*
Most manufacturers make their equipment to meet
the NEMA standards for safe operation. However, even
well built equipment can be installed or operated in a
hazardous manner. It is important that safety consider-
ations be observed. The user must properly select, in-
stall, and use the apparatus with respect to load and
environment.
Selection of Apparatus
Before selecting a piece of
equipment you should study the recommendations of
the manufacturer of the apparatus, generally available
in catalogs. Manufacturers usually maintain engineer-
ing departments to assist you in making sure that you
have the right equipment for the job. Local sales repre-
sentatives or factory representatives can usually arrange
for more details, if needed.
Installation of Apparatus
The equipment manu-
facturer or the person installing the apparatus must
take care in the installation. The National Electrical
Code (NEC), sound local electrical and safety codes,
and when applicable, the Occupational Safety and
Health Act (OSHA) should be followed when in-
stalling the apparatus to reduce hazards to persons and
property. 
Use of Apparatus
The chance of electric shocks,
fires, or explosions can be reduced by giving proper
consideration to the use of grounding, thermal and
over-current protection, type of enclosure, and good
maintenance procedures.
Safety Considerations
1. All motors, gear motors, and controls must be
grounded adequately and securely. Failure to ground
properly may cause serious injury to personnel.
2. Do not insert objects into ventilation openings,
motors, or other apparatus.
3. Sparking of starting switches in ac motors so
equipped, and of brushes in commutator type mo-
tors, can be expected during normal operation. In
addition, enclosures may eject flame in the event
of an insulation or component failure. Therefore,
avoid, protect from, or prevent the presence of
flammable or combustible materials in the envi-
ronment of motors, gear motors, and controls.
4. When dealing with hazardous locations (flammable
or explosive gas, vapor, dust) an explosion-proof
or dust-ignition-proof product is the recommended
approach. Exceptions are allowed by the National
Electrical Code. The NEC and NEMA safety stan-
dard should be studied thoroughly before exercis-
ing this option.
5. Ventilated products are suitable for clean, dry
locations where cooling air is not restricted. 
Enclosed products are suitable for dirty, damp 
locations. For outdoor use, wash down, and so on,
enclosed products must be protected by a cover
while allowing adequate air flow.
6. Moisture will increase the electrical shock hazard
of electrical insulation. Therefore, consideration
should be given to the avoidance of (or protection
from) liquids in the area of motors and controls.
Use of totally enclosed motors/gear motors will
reduce the hazard if all openings are sealed.
7. Chassis controls should be properly guarded or
enclosed to prevent possible human contact with
“live” circuitry.
8. Proper consideration should be given to rotating
members. Before starting, make sure that keys,
pulleys, and so on, are securely fastened. Proper
guards should be provided for rotating members to
prevent hazards to personnel.
9. Before servicing or working on equipment, discon-
nect the power source (this applies especially to
equipment using automatic restart devices instead
of manual restart devices. See Fig. 2-9 where a
specially designed switch and panel box has dou-
ble interlocking hasp of tempered steel with inter-
locking tabs for extra security. For safety reasons

Safety in the Workplace
Code (Article 250) and the National Electrical Safety
Code. Equipment grounding also provides a return
path for ground-fault currents, permitting protective
devices to operate. 
Accidental contact of any energized conductor of
the system with an improperly non–current-carrying
metallic part of the system (such as a motor frame or
panel board enclosure) would raise the potential of the
metal object above ground potential. Any person com-
ing in contact with such an object while grounded
could be seriously injured or killed. In addition, current
flow from the accidental grounding of an energized
part of the system could generate sufficient heat (often
arcing) to start a fire.
The equipment grounding system must be bonded
to the grounding electrode at the source or service.
However, it may also be connected to ground at many
other points. This will not cause problems with safe op-
eration of the electrical distribution system. 
Where computers, data processing, or micro-
processor-based industrial process control systems are
installed, the equipment grounding system must be
designed to minimize interference with their proper
operation. Often, isolated grounding of this equipment,
or a completely isolated electrical supply system, is
required to protect microprocessors from power sys-
tem “noise” that does not in any way affect motors or
other electrical equipment.
System Grounding
System grounding connects the
electrical supply—from the utility, transformer sec-
ondary windings, or a generator-to ground. A system
can be solidly grounded (no intentional impedance to
ground), impedance grounded (through a resistance or
reactance), or ungrounded (with no intentional connec-
tion to ground).
Solidly grounded three-phase systems are shown
in Fig. 2-10. They are usually wye-connected, with the
neutral point grounded. Less common is the “red-leg”
or high-leg delta, a 240-V system supplied by some
utilities with one winding center-tapped to proved 120
V to ground for lighting. This 240-V, three-phase, four-
wire system is used where the 120-V lighting load is
small compared to the 240-V power load, because the
installation is low in cost to the utility.
A corner-grounded three-phase delta system is
sometimes used, with one phase grounded to stabilize
all voltages to ground. Better solutions are available for
new installations. Ungrounded systems (Fig. 2-11) can
be either wye or delta, although the ungrounded delta
system is far more common.
Resistance-grounded systems (Fig. 2-12) are sim-
plest with a wye connection, grounding the neutral
the box should be locked whenever someone is
working on the circuit or equipment. In this way
another person is unable to apply power while
someone else is working on equipment. 
10. In selecting, installing, and using equipment, the
hazard of mechanical failure should be considered
in addition to electrical hazards. Mechanical con-
siderations include proper mounting and alignment
of apparatus and safe loads on shafting and gearing.
Do not depend on gear friction to hold loads. 
11. Ambient temperatures around apparatus should
not exceed 40°C (104°F) unless the nameplates
specifically permit higher values.
12. Power supply to all equipment must be that shown
on the nameplate.
Grounding
In industrial installations, the effect of a shutdown
caused by a single ground fault could be disastrous. An
interrupted process could cause the loss of all materials
involved, often ruin the process equipment itself, and
sometimes create extremely dangerous situations for
operating personnel.
Grounding encompasses several different but inter-
related aspects of electrical distribution system design
and construction, all of which are essential to the safety
and proper operation of the system and equipment sup-
plied by it. Among these are equipment grounding, sys-
tem grounding, static and lightning protection, and
connection to earth as a reference (zero) potential.
Equipment Grounding
Equipment grounding is
essential to the safety of personnel. Its function is to
ensure that all exposed non–current-carrying metallic
parts of all structures and equipment in or near the elec-
trical distribution system are at the same potential, and
that this is the zero reference potential of the earth.
Grounding is required by both the National Electrical

Review Questions

point directly through the resistor. Delta systems can
be grounded by means of a zigzag or other grounding
transformer. This derives a neutral point, which can be
either solidly or impedance grounded. If the grounding
transformer has sufficient capacity, the neutral created
can be solidly grounded and used as part of a three-
phase, four-wire system. Most transformer-supplied sys-
tems are either solidly grounded or resistance grounded.
Generator neutrals are often grounded through a reac-
tor, to limit ground-fault (zero sequence) currents to
values the generator can withstand. Medium-voltage
resistance-grounded neutrals are often grounded through
a grounding transformer, although many 2400-V and
some 4160-V systems are grounded directly, like low-
voltage systems. 
Which System Is Best?
There is no best distribution
system for all applications. That is why you may find
any one of these systems in any plant. In choosing
among solid-grounded, resistance-grounded, or un-

installation.
ELECTRONIC SYMBOLS
The field of electronics has its own symbols that are
used by those who draw wiring diagrams. More and
more electronics are being utilized in the control of
motors (Figs. 3-4 and 3-5).
Resistor Color Code
It is a good idea to learn how the resistor color code
is read. Many electronic controls have resistors
identified by the color code. The color code is used
on resistors from 0.1 to 2 W. The small resistors are
useful primarily in electronic circuits that draw very
little current. They usually have large resistances, as
opposed to the larger wire-wound types used
directly in series with motor windings (Fig. 3-6).
Electronic Symbols Compared
Figure 3-7 shows the usual electronic symbol on the
left and compares it with industrial control sym-
bols. This will give you an idea as to how they may
differ when you are looking at a wiring diagram. In
most instances, the capacitor symbol is a straight
line with a curved line parallel to it. The older sym-
bol shown is there for those schematics or wiring
diagrams you may find hidden away in a closet from
bygone days.
RELAY CONTACT SYMBOLS
One of the things you do work with a great deal in
controlling motors is relays. Figure 3-8 shows some
of the basic relay contact symbols that may be used.
Keep in mind what make and break mean when
working with relays. The single pole, single throw is
similar to switches symbols. Remember, the relay
contacts are doing exactly what the switch contact is
doing—making and breaking or closing and opening
the circuit.

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
1. Draw the symbols used in electrical wiring dia-
grams and ladder diagrams.
2. Use the resistor color code to select the proper size
resistors.
3. Identify relay contact symbols.
4. Identify electronic schematic symbols.
Electrical wiring diagrams and ladder diagrams,
which are the main means of communicating between
engineer and technician in the motor controls field, are
made up of nothing more than lines connecting certain
symbols.
Symbols are used as a sort of shorthand that allows
many electrical functions to be identified and sketched
out in a small area. People familiar with the symbols
used in the electrical field are able to identify certain
components and figure out how they are wired and
how they operate.
Symbols are the heart of any wiring diagram.
Because they are so important a part of the job, it is
best to become acquainted with them at an early stage
in the learning of a trade.
ELECTRICAL SYMBOLS
Electrical symbols are used on blueprints and in
wiring diagrams for buildings and plants. Figure 3-1
shows the standardized symbols utilized by drafters
who draw wiring diagrams for the placement of elec-
trical equipment and control devices.
Common Switch (Button)
Symbols
Motor controls technicians work with switches (but-
tons) and their associated components to make a
motor do what it is supposed to do when it is sup-
posed to do it. Some of the symbols used for switch-
ing are shown in Fig. 3-2. Note the pressure and
vacuum switches, liquid-level switch, temperature-
actuated switch, and flow switch. These will be uti-
lized by the motor control technician in their many
applications. Switches may also be referred to as
buttons.

Figure 3-9 shows the symbols put to work in the
typical ladder diagram. Note that there are both a line
1 (L1) and a line 2 (L2), where the power is brought
into the circuit. Then the various devices are con-
nected to both sides of the power line. At this time
you should focus on how the contacts are drawn in the
circuit in reference to what device is being controlled
by the normally open (NO) and normally closed
(NC) contacts. Also take a close look at the START and
STOP switches. As soon as the START switch (button) is
closed, M in the circle will energize. This causes the
M contacts (located across the START switch), which
are NO, to close. That completes the circuit from L1
through the stop switch and the START switch through
coil M and the overload contacts (O.L.) to the other
side of the line L2. Once the coil is energized, the NO
contacts across the START switch stay closed and the
START switch can be released. However, when the STOP
switch is opened, it causes the circuit to de-energize
and the contacts M to open again until the START button
is again closed.
Now drop down to the next line in the diagram.
Note that the NC contacts have an M above them.
This means that they are connected to the M coil or
relay. When the M coil is energized, these contacts
open and turn off the pilot light connected in series
with the contacts.

sentation of the physical station, showing relative posi-
tions of units, suggested internal wiring, and connections
with the starter.

CHAPTER

WIRING DIAGRAMS
A wiring diagram gives the necessary information for
actually wiring up a group of control devices or for phys-
ically tracing wires when troubleshooting is necessary.
Wiring diagrams or connection diagrams include all
the devices in the system and show their physical relation
to each other. All poles, terminals, coils, contacts, and
switches are shown in their proper place on each device.
These diagrams are helpful in wiring up systems, because
connections can be made exactly as they are shown in the
diagram. In following the electrical sequence of any cir-
cuit, however, the wiring diagram does not show the con-
nections in a manner that can easily be followed. For this
reason a rearrangement of the circuit elements to form a
line diagram is desirable.
Start Circuits
Manual starting switches are designed for starting and
protecting small ac and dc motors rated at 1 hp or less
where undervoltage protection is not needed. They
are operated by a toggle lever mounted on the front of
the switch (Fig. 4-2). Wiring diagrams do not show the

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
1. Draw a ladder diagram.
2. Explain how to use symbols in diagrams.
3. Describe undervoltage release and protection. 
4. Identify a two-wire control circuit.
5. Identify a three-wire control circuit.
6. Describe the difference between a line drawing and
a wiring diagram.
7. Define the role of a thermal protector.
A wiring diagram shows, as closely as possible, the
actual location of all of the component parts of the
device. The open terminals, which are marked by open
circles, and arrows represent connections made by the
user. Figure 4-1 shows a circle with motor written in it
with three arrows leaving the circle and labeled T1,
T2, and T3; this represents a three-phase motor. The T
stands for the terminals on the motor and are to be con-
nected by the electrician.

Since wiring connections and terminal markings
are shown, this type of diagram is helpful when wiring
the device or in tracing wires when troubleshooting.
Note that bold lines denote the power circuit, and thin
lines are used to show the control circuit. In most
instances, ac magnetic equipment uses black wires for
power circuits and red wiring for control circuits. It is
to your advantage to learn how to read both wiring dia-
grams and line diagrams.

Other simple wiring diagrams are used to show how
to connect manual starters operated by START–STOP push
buttons mounted on the front of the starter. Figure 4-7
shows what the pushbutton looks like when properly
packaged with the cover removed for ease in viewing
the terminals. This type of starter is used where under-
voltage protection is not required. Wiring diagrams do
not show the operating mechanism since it is not elec-
trically controlled. Pushing the button mechanically
closes the contacts, connnecting the motor to the line.

LINE DIAGRAM OR LADDER
DIAGRAM
A line diagram gives the necessary information for eas-
ily following the operation of the various devices in the
circuit. It is very helpful in troubleshooting, for it
shows, in a simple way, the effect that opening or clos-
ing various contacts has on other devices in the circuit.
A line diagram is sometimes referred to as an ele-
mentary diagram or a schematic diagram. No attempt
is made to show the various devices in their actual posi-
tions. All control devices are shown between vertical
lines which represent the source of control power, and
circuits are shown connected as directly as possible
from one of these lines to the other. All connections are
made in such a way that the functioning of the various
devices can easily be traced (Fig. 4-12). 
This is a simple or elementary diagram of a
switch in series with a magnetic coil (M) and over-
load contacts. Note how the L1 is to the left and the
number 1 is placed near the junction point of L1 with
the horizontal line. Each line or point where a hori-
zontal line is taken off the power line is numbered.
This comes in handy later when the programmable
controller is utilized to do the work of switching. This
type of drawing is also referred to as a ladder dia-
gram, due to its design with parallel power lines and
rungs that make up the circuits.
UNDERVOLTAGE RELEASE
Another name for undervoltage release is low-
voltage release–two-wire control. These terms mean
that the starter will drop out when there is a voltage
failure and will pick up again as soon as power is
restored (Fig. 4-12). This low-voltage release is a
two-wire control using a maintained contact pilot
device (limit switch, pressure, or float switch) in
series with the starter coil. This arrangement is used
when a starter is required to function automatically
without the attention of an operator. If a power fail-
ure occurs while the contacts of the pilot device are
closed, the starter will drop out. When the power is
restored, the starter will pick up automatically
through the closed contacts of the pilot device. The
term two-wire control arises from the fact that in the
basic circuit, only two wires are required to connect
the pilot device to the starter.
TWO-WIRE CONTROL CIRCUITS
There are a number of circuits that can be drawn and used
to good advantage in specific situations. Figure 4-13
shows a starter operated with manual control provided by
a selector switch. 
A high-pressure cutout switch can be added. Both
the wiring diagram and the line drawing are shown to
illustrate how things are connected and arranged. The
selector switch makes it possible to operate the starter
manually for testing in case of failure of the auto-
matic pilot control. When a standard across-the-line

The thermostat contacts must not overlap or be
adjusted too close to one another, since this may burn
out the resistance unit. It is also advisable to check the
inrush current of the relay against the current rating of
the thermostat. This arrangement can also be used with
pressure controls. “A” represents the three-wire gage-
type temperature control device. CR is the thermostat
relay, which in this case has two sets of contacts also
labeled CR.
Another method of protecting thermostat contacts
from high currents can be seen in Fig. 4-15. This dia-
gram shows the use of a thermostat whose contacts can
handle even less current than the ones in the preceding
example. It is advisable in such cases as this to use
relays having coils that operate at a very small value of
volt-amperes. This will reduce the burden on the ther-
mostat contacts and is especially advisable where fre-
quent operation is required. “A” represents the
three-wire sensitive gage-type control. CR1 and CR2
are the low coil current relays.
When the close position is indicated it means that
relay CR1 is energized. Energizing CR1 causes the
contacts CR1 to close. Closing CR1 contacts in series
with the control coil (M) causes it to energize, starting
the motor. It also keeps itself energized by the other set
of CR1 contacts. However, when open is indicated by
the thermostat it completes the circuit through the
starter without pushbuttons is used, connection Y is
removed and the wiring follows the solid lines of
the diagram.
Note that in the ladder diagram only L1 and L2 are
used. The control circuitry uses these two for power,
while the magnetic starter M has three sets of contacts
that will interrupt the power to the three-phase motor in
all three legs or phases.
If a high-pressure cutout switch is added, it
should be inserted in the line leading from L1 to the
HAND terminal of the selector switch. A low-pressure
switch or thermostat can be used where A is located
(Fig. 4-13). B represents the high-pressure switch or
safety cutout. Note how the HAND-OFF-AUTO switch
operates in both the wiring diagram and the ladder
diagram.
THERMOSTAT CONTROL
Since the contacts of a gage-type thermostat cannot
handle the current to a starter coil, a thermostat relay
must be used as an intermediate step between the ther-
mostat and the starter (Fig. 4-14). The relay is ener-
gized when the close contact is made and de-energized
when the open contact is made. The open contact
bypasses the relay coil to de-energize it. A resistor
(Res.) is built into the relay to guard against a short
circuit when this is done.
Thermostat Control

closed contacts of CR1 to cause relay CR2 to energize.
Once CR2 is energized, it opens its contacts (CR2),
which are normally closed and in series with CR1 relay
coil. This causes CR1 to de-energize and open the CR1
contacts, one of which is in series with the motor con-
trol coil (M); this stops the motor. Once CR2 is ener-
gized it is quickly de-energized by its contacts opening
CRTs circuit and opening the CR1 contacts, which
de-energize the motor starter coil.
The difference between the line drawing and the
wiring diagram is the line drawing (ladder diagram)
makes it easier to see how the relays operate in sequence
to control the magnetic starter coil and thereby the motor.
UNDERVOLTAGE PROTECTION
Undervoltage protection is also referred to as low-
voltage protection, three-wire control. Both terms
mean the same and indicate that the starter will drop
out when there is a voltage failure but will not pick up
automatically when voltage returns. The control cir-
cuit is completed through the STOP button and also
through a holding contact. See contact 2-3 on the
starter in Fig. 4-16. When the starter drops out, these
contacts open, breaking the control circuit until the
START button is pressed once again.
Three wires lead from the pilot device to the
starter. The START-STOP pushbutton station is usually
thought of when undervoltage protection or three-wire
control is mentioned. This is the most common means
of providing this type of control.
The main distinction between the two-wire and
three-wire controls is that with undervoltage release
(two-wire) and undervoltage protection (three-wire) is
the fact that one will cause the motor to start again
when the power is on again and the other will not start
until the START button is pressed. The designations two-
wire and three-wire are used only to describe the sim-
plest applications of the two types. Actually, in other
systems, there might be more wires leading from the
pilot device to the starter, but the principle of two-wire
or three-wire control would still be present.
THREE-WIRE CONTROL CIRCUITS
One of the methods used to improve your ability to
read wiring diagrams and ladder diagrams is to prac-
tice. Figures 4-17 through 4-26 are three-wire control
circuits that can do a variety of things. Each will be
analyzed to show how it operates. Knowing how they
operate will aid in troubleshooting since troubleshoot-
ing is nothing more than determining why a device is
not performing the way it should normally.
One of the simplest types of three-wire control cir-
cuitry is shown in Fig. 4-17. This three-wire control
has a pilot light in the circuit to indicate when the

Fig. 4-21 can be used. A maintained overload on any
one of the motors will drop out all three starters. Note
how M1 contacts control M2 and M2 contacts control
M3. Once the STOP button is depressed it opens the
circuit to Ml, and its dropout causes the other two
coils to also drop out. The START switch is paralleled
with contacts from M3.
motor is running. The pilot light is wired in parallel
with the starter coil to indicate when the starter is ener-
gized and the motor is running or at least has power
applied to its terminals.
Figure 4-18 takes the three-wire control circuitry a
step further. It shows a pilot light used to indicate when
the motor is stopped. A pilot light may be required to
indicate when the motor is stopped in some cases. This
can be done by wiring a normally closed auxiliary con-
tact located on the starter in series with the pilot light.
When the starter is de-energized, the pilot light is on.
When the starter picks up, the auxiliary contacts open,
turning off the light.
Three-Wire Control Circuits  
77

Three-wire control with pilot light. Motor stopped.
Figure 4-19 uses a push-to-test pilot light to indi-
cate when the motor is running. When the motor-
running pilot light is not glowing, there may be doubt
as to whether the circuit is open or whether the pilot
light bulb is burned out. The push-to-test pilot light
enables testing of the bulb simply by pushing on the
switch cap. This only indicates if the bulb is working
or not; it does not indicate other problems that may be
in the coil or the wiring up to the motor.

The illuminated pushbutton combines a start but-
ton and a pilot light (see Fig. 4-20). Pressing the pilot
light lens operates the start contacts. Space is saved by
requiring only a two-unit pushbutton station instead of
three.
When one START-STOP station is required to con-
trol more than one starter, the arrangement shown in
Fig. 4-20
Three-wire control with illuminated pushbutton. Motor
running.
Fig. 4-21
Three-wire control. More than one starter. One push-
button station controls all. (Allen-Bradley)
So far the circuits have been utilized to keep the
motor running or stopped when unsafe conditions
occur. Now it is time to look at what can be done to
reverse the direction of motor rotation. Three-wire con-
trol of a reversing starter can be accomplished with a
FORWARD-REVERSE-STOP pushbutton station, as shown in
Fig. 4-22. Limit switches can be added to stop the motor
at a certain point in either direction. Jumpers 6 to 3 and
7 to 5 must then be removed. The circle with F and the
circle with R in the figure are the coils whose contacts
actually do the switching of the leads to the motor in
order to make it reverse the direction.
Fig. 4-22
Three-wire control. Reversing starter. (Allen-Bradley)

In some cases more than one pushbutton station
is needed. That calls for an arrangement similar to
Fig. 4-23. Note how the two switches (FORWARD and
REVERSE) are paralleled but arranged so that pressing
FORWARD in either location will cause the F coil to
energize and pushing REVERSE will cause the R coil
to energize from either position. Note how the F con-
tacts are in series with the R coil and the R contacts
are placed in series with the F coil. This de-energizes
the R coil when the F coil is energized.
Once the two-speed motor has been controlled, it
is, in most instances, preferable to have some indica-
tion as to which speed is engaged. Figure 4-26 shows a
three-wire two-speed starter with one pilot light to
indicate that the motor is operational at both speeds.
One pilot light can be used to indicate operation at both
low and high speeds. One extra, normally open inter-
lock on each contactor is required. Two pilot lights, one
for each speed, could be used by connecting pilot lights
in parallel with high and low coils, such as shown in
Fig. 4-24.

Sometimes it is necessary to know in which direc-
tion the motor is rotating. A pilot light can be con-
nected to indicate the direction of rotation. Pilot lights
can be connected in parallel with the forward and
reverse contactor coils to indicate which contactor is
energized and thus in which direction the motor is run-
ning (Fig. 4-24). Start-stop and reversing of rotation

have been examined up to this point. Now it is time to
introduce the two-speed starter. Three-wire control of
a two-speed starter with a HIGH-LOW-STOP pushbutton
station is shown in Fig. 4-25. The diagram allows the
operator to start the motor from rest at either speed or
to change from low to high speed. The STOP button
must be operated before it is possible to change from
high to low speed. This arrangement is intended to pre-
vent excessive line current and shock to the motor and
the driven machinery. Shock to the motor can result
when motors are run at  high speed and are then recon-
nected for a lower speed.

OVERCURRENT PROTECTION 
FOR CONTROL CIRCUITS
A high-quality electric motor, properly cooled and
protected against overloads, can be expected to have
a long life. The goal of proper motor protection is to
prolong motor life and postpone the failure that ulti-
mately takes place. Good electrical protection con-
sists of providing both proper overload protection
and current-limiting with short-circuit protection. Alter-
nating current motors and other types of high-inrush
loads require protective devices with special charac-
teristics. Normal, full-load, running currents of
motors are substantially less than the currents that
result when motors start or are subjected to temporary
mechanical overloads. This characteristic is shown in
Fig. 4-27.

• Thermal protectors. Sensitive to heat and internally
embedded in small fractional-horsepower motors
and hermetic compressor motors of integral sizes;
resetting can be automatic or manual.
Circuit breakers are not generally recommended
for overload protection. They usually do not have suffi-
cient time delay to permit close sizing (typically, sizing
must be 200 to 250%) of motor full-load amperes
(FLA) and are prone to trip out magnetically under
starting conditions. The instantaneous trips of circuit
breakers have to be set high enough to overcome the
motor momentary transient current. Fuses other than
dual-element are not recommended because they must
be substantially oversized (typically, 300 to 400% of
motor FLA) to permit starting.
Common control with fusing in one line only and
with both lines ungrounded or, if user’s conditions per-
mit, with one line grounded are shown in Fig. 4-28.
Note the fuse symbol and that it is in series with L1. L2
is grounded and not fused. Common control with fus-
ing in both lines and with both lines ungrounded is
shown in Fig. 4-29.
At the moment when the ac motor circuit is ener-
gized, the starting current rapidly rises to many times
the normal current and the rotor begins to rotate. As the
rotor accelerates and reaches running speed, the current
declines to the normal running current. Thus, for this
period, the overcurrent protective devices in the motor
circuit must be able to tolerate the rather substantial
temporary overload.
Motor starting currents can vary substantially
depending on the motor type, load type, starting meth-
ods, and other factors. For the initial half-cycle, the
momentary transient rms current can be 11 times
higher or more. After the first half-cycle, the starting
current subsides to four to eight times (typically, six
times) the normal current for several seconds. This cur-
rent is called the locked rotor current. When the motor
reaches running speed, the current subsides to its nor-
mal running level.
The special requirements for protection of motors
require that the motor overload protective device with-
stand the temporary overload caused by motor starting
currents, and at the same time, protect the motor from
continuous or damaging overloads. Overload protec-
tion is provided by three main types of devices:
• Overload relays in motor controllers. Usually, the
melting alloy or bimetallic type, which are designed
to simulate motor damage curve characteristics. Cor-
rectly sized, overload relays in a good-quality con-
troller, properly maintained, provide good protection.
• Dual-element, time-delay fuses and low-peak dual-
element fuses. The time-delay element in these fuses
provides a minimum of 10 seconds delay at 500%
load and will yield good running protection when
sized correctly. In addition, short-circuit protection is
afforded by the short-circuit element.

TRANSFORMERS IN CONTROL
CIRCUITS
Transformers can be used to step down or step up volt-
ages. A step-down transformer is usually employed in
control circuits where the equipment utilized to control
the main operating equipment is connected to high-
voltage lines. Low voltage can be used to control high
voltages and high currents by energizing starter coils
that have contacts that can handle the higher currents
and voltages. This lower voltage allows for smaller wire

to be used and for control stations to be placed in remote
areas far from the actual operating device or motor.
There are a number of control circuits that use fuses
for protection. Note the fusing employed in Fig. 4-30.
One fuse is used to protect the transformer in this circuit,
where it is placed in the secondary circuit of the trans-
former. However, Fig. 4-31 uses two fuses to protect the
secondary transformer circuitry, while Fig. 4-32 shows
how both the primary and the secondary circuits of the
transformer are fused with one of the primary lines
being grounded. In Fig. 4-33 the primary circuit is not
grounded, so two fuses are used, one in Ll and one in
L2, as well as two fuses in the secondary circuitry.
Figure 4-34 shows the control circuit transformer with
fusing in both primary lines, with no secondary fusing
and with all lines ungrounded.

provides low voltage for the control circuit, which is
wired for three-wire control. The starter coil is oper-
ated on a voltage lower than line voltage. This is usu-
ally done for safety reasons. This also requires the

CHAPTER

Industrial controls consist of nothing more than
relays, diodes, and switches, which are designed for
specific jobs. Switches may come in the form of ther-
mostats or pressure-sensing devices. Relays may have
one set of contacts, or any number, even 40. Diodes
may be as small as a pin-head or large enough to han-
dle high currents with the aid of heat sinks. In your
car’s alternator diodes are used to control the output of
the generator. The alternator generates alternating cur-
rent and the diodes change it to direct current before it
leaves the device.
The device most often used to control electricity
and all the work it accomplishes is the switch.
Switches come in many sizes and shapes. They have
different types of contacts for various applications.
In the case of motor controls, the switches have to
have contacts that are able to withstand the onrush of
current at the start and the inductive kickback pro-
duced by the collapsing magnetic field of the motor
when it is turned off. In this chapter, we discuss those
switches used to turn motors on and off and to
reverse their direction of rotation. The switches have
been arranged alphabetically by name. The electri-
cian should become familiar with various manufac-
turers and what each has done to adapt a device to a
special job. 
DRUM SWITCH
One of the most commonly used switches for motor
control is the drum switch (Fig. 5-1). It has the capa-
bility to reverse a motor or turn it off. Drum switches
may be used for across-the-line starting and the

CONTROLLING ELECTRICITY
In order to make electricity useful it is necessary to
control it. You will want it in the proper place at the
proper time. Otherwise, it can do great damage—even
kill. Electricity can be controlled by using switches,
relays, or diodes. These devices are used to direct the
current to the place where it will work for you. Each
device is carefully chosen to do a specific job. For
example, the relay is used for remote-control work,
and a diode is used to control large and small amounts
of current in electrical as well as electronic equipment.
A diode is a device which allows current to flow in one
direction only. It can be used to change ac to dc.

Three-Phase Switching
Three-phase motors can also be reversed by using the
drum switch. Keep in mind that only two of the phases
have to be changed to cause a three-phase motor to
reverse its direction of rotation (Fig. 5-3).
Drum Switch

reversing of ac poly-phase, ac single-phase, or dc
motors. They are compact and inexpensive but ruggedly
constructed.
Easy Conversion
Drum switches are field convertible from MAINTAINED
to MOMENTARY operation. This conversion consists of
removing the handle screw and handle, turning the
shaft 180, then replacing the handle and handle screw.
A handle is used to move contacts that are
mounted on an insulated rotating shaft. Moving con-
tacts make and break contact with stationary contacts
within the controller as the shaft is rotated. This drum-
like rotation or moving of the contacts causes the
switch to be called a drum switch. It is also sometimes
called a cam switch since it uses a cam action to
accomplish its switching action.
Figure 5-1 shows that the drum switch is fully
enclosed and its insulated handle is used to move the
contacts from point to point. Figure 5-2 shows how the
six contacts of the switch are connected for off-reverse-
forward positions. Note how the start and run windings
connections are changed by the switching action to
cause a reverse rotation.
Fig. 5-2

Fig. 5-3
Reversing a three-phase motor with a drum switch.

DC Switching
Direct current motor control can also be provided by
the drum switch (Fig. 5-4). The reversal is accom-
plished by changing the polarity. Note how the switch-
ing action causes the armature and field coil windings
of the series motor to be placed in series in the forward
position. Then trace it out for the reversal of polarity in
the REVERSE position of the drum switch. The com-
pound dc motor is also reversed by changing the polar-
ity provided to the armature. The field coil maintains
the same polarity in both positions of the switch. Note
how the coils are connected to  and  in the same
way for both positions of the switch. Then take a look
at how the armature has  and  switched to make it
rotate in the opposite direction. That is accomplished
by 5 and 6 on the switch being the same in both the for-
ward and reverse positions.
Some dc motors use inter-poles (commutating
windings) to suppress brush arcing. Therefore, it is a
good idea to keep in mind that these windings are part
of the armature circuit.
FLOAT SWITCHES
Float switches provide automatic control for motors that
operate tank or sump pumps. They are built in five styles
and can be supplied with accessories to provide rod or
chain operation, wall or floor mounting (Fig. 5-5). Float
switches are designed for automatic control of ac or dc
pump motor magnetic starters, or for direct control of
light motor loads.
A great variety of operating accessories are available
to make float switches operate by many methods, depend-
ing on the position, depth of a tank, or sump (Fig. 5-6).
Stainless steel floats, rods, chains, and stop collars are
available for use in certain corrosive liquids. They are
made in both normally open and normally closed config-
urations or both. Figure 5-7 shows how the float switch is
connected in the circuit. Note the normally open and nor-
mally closed operation of the switch. This is one of the
most popular means of pumping water from a basement
automatically and prevents damage from seepage or
flooding of any type. Once the level of the water causes
the switch to close, it turns on the pump motor. 
If it is a small fractional-horsepower motor, the
switch can control the motor directly. If it is a larger-
horsepower pump motor, the float switch is used to
energize a magnetic motor starter.
FLOW SWITCHES
A flow switch is used to detect the flow of liquids,
water, oil, or other gases in a pipe or duct. It is nothing

systems. Electrical heating systems are especially
prone to damage if the proper amount of air is not
allowed to circulate over the heating coils. The coils
can burn out if not properly cooled by a steady flow of
air. See Fig. 5-10 for the electrical circuit that puts the
flow switch to work.

with an operator extending from the switch enclosure
(Fig. 5-8). Most are adjustable so that allowances can
be made for buildup or changes in the application of
the switch.

FOOT SWITCHES
Foot switches are just what the name suggests. They
are operated by pressure directed by a human foot.
They can be found on stapling machines, older-model
automobile headlight dimmers, and any number of
machine operations that require a person to use both
hands and thus operate the on-off switch by foot. This
type of switch is usually a heavy-duty type and comes
in a variety of sizes, voltages, and shapes. Many limit
switches can be converted to foot operation.
Some floor lamps used for residential lighting are
controlled by foot switches usually mounted on the
base of the lamp.

Fig. 5-9
Flow switch sounds alarm for sprinkler malfunction.
These switches are very useful in a number of
locations. They may be used to detect the flow of air in
a wind tunnel or in air-conditioning ductwork, or they
may be used to set off alarms or start motors.
They are used to indicate the flow of water in a
sprinkler system. This can be used to alert the person in
charge in case a sprinkler system begins to operate with-
out being triggered by fire. The sounding of the alarm
can allow the operator to shut off the sprinkler system
before too much water damage occurs (Fig. 5-9).
Clogged air filters can be detected by flow
switches. Flow switches can be adjusted to indicate
when a filter is clogged and is not allowing enough air
through to keep a motor or other device properly
cooled. Airflow detection is important in heating

JOYSTICK
The joystick is a rather recent device and is used
most commonly in conjunction with computers,
although it can be used to control a number of opera-
tions (Fig. 5-11). This type of switch can be used to
good advantage in the operation of a crane, where the
operator has to keep his or her eyes on the load rather
than on the switch.
gate. The placement of the gates in the switch causes it
to change its possibilities. The gates are metal plates that
can be changed as needed by the person who usually
makes repairs and installations.
Whenever a job requirement dictates the utilization
of moving an object from left to right or up and down,
the joystick can be made to control the movement
needed. A good example is operating a foundry ladle or
a hoist for any number of jobs. There are some advan-
tages to joystick operation of a load. Inasmuch as no
two contacts can be closed at the same time, there is a
slight delay between the break of one circuit and the
make of another by the switching action. This means
that the load will not have to change directions quickly.
INTERLOCK SWITCHES
Interlock switches are used for safety purposes. The
idea is to make sure that the forward motion of the
motor has been stopped before the reversing action is
started by changing the electrical path through the
motor windings. There are three ways to incorporate
interlocking and the protection needed. Auxiliary
contact interlocking, mechanical interlocking, and
pushbutton interlocking are the three methods most
commonly used.
Mechanical Interlocking
A ladder diagram can be used to illustrate the way a
mechanical interlock functions (Fig. 5-13B). The
dashed lines from the forward coil to the reverse coil
are used to indicate a mechanical interlock. This type
of interlock switching is usually provided by the
manufacturer of the starter. A piece of material is
usually inserted so that when one pushbutton is
depressed, the other cannot be depressed. The FORWARD
pushbutton is depressed, completing the circuit to the
F coil. The coil is energized, but in energizing, it
closes the contacts F1. Keep in mind that there are
two parts to the switch or contacts that close or touch
one another. This means that the pushbutton can be
released and the circuit stays energized by complet-
ing the circuit through the F1 contacts instead of the
pushbutton contacts. This is often referred to as
memory. The F coil stays energized until the STOP
switch is depressed. Once it is depressed, the coil
de-energizes and contacts (Fl) open. The STOP button
returns to its normally closed position and the
REVERSE button can be depressed, energizing the R
coil. The coil energizes and closes contacts (R) that
are across the REVERSE pushbutton. The circuit stays
energized until the STOP switch is depressed, causing
the coil to de-energize.

Joystick switch. (Square D)
Two types of joysticks are available: the standard
model, where the operator is free to move from position
to position, and the latched lever type. The latched lever
requires the operator to lift a locking ring before the lever
can be moved. The switching action can be momentary
or maintained contact or a combination of both.
Note the different combinations of contact positions
available in Fig. 5-12. The center position on the joy-
stick is used for the off or stop control. Figure 5-13A
shows how the joystick is wired into a circuit and can
operate at least four loads, depending on where the lever
is located to close the switches. The switches can be
adjusted to have a two-, three-, four-, or eight-position
Fig. 5-12
Contact positions of the joystick.

Pushbutton Interlocking
Double-circuit pushbuttons can be used for pushbutton
interlocking (Fig. 5-15). This type of interlocking
depends on the electrical circuit for its operation. The
idea is to make sure that both coils are not energized at
the same time.
Note that the STOP button is normally closed in
Fig. 5-15. That means that when the FORWARD button is
pressed, coil F is energized and the normally open
(NO) contact F1 closes to hold in the forward contac-
tor. Because the normally closed (NC) contacts are
used in the forward and reverse pushbutton units, there
The mechanical interlock prevents both forward
and reverse from being energized if the buttons were to
be depressed at the same time. It also prevents the
reverse power being applied while forward power is
still being applied to the motor.
Keep in mind that the contacts for the mechanical
interlock are not shown in a line or ladder diagram. The
assembly of the switches causes one to be disabled when
the other is being depressed. In this way, short circuits
and burnouts are prevented. Take a look at Fig. 5-14. The
three-phase motor can be reversed by changing any two
of the phases. Reversing motor starters are available in
vertical or horizontal construction.

is no need to press the STOP button before changing
direction of rotation. If the REVERSE button is pressed
while the motor is running in the forward direction,
the forward control circuit is de-energized and the
reverse contactor is energized and held closed.
If reversing is repeated quickly, it may cause the
motor to overheat and overload relays and fuses to
function as designed. In most applications for motors
it is best for the motor to coast to a stop before
reversing. However, if plugging is called for, the
starter has to be rated to handle the reversing, espe-
cially if it occurs at a rate of more than five times
per minute.
Auxiliary Contact Interlocking
Normally closed (NC) auxiliary contacts on the
starter can be used for interlocking. This is done by
a separate set of contacts on the reversing starter
(Fig. 5-16). The three-phase motor shown has a for-
ward (F) and reverse (R) coil that energize to close
contacts in L1, L2, and L3 to complete the power to
the motor through its overload (OL) contactors,
inserted inside the motor windings. The forward
pushbutton is depressed. This completes the circuit
to the F coil because the R normally closed contacts
(R2) are closed. Once coil F is energized, it holds
the F contacts across the forward switch contacts
closed, keeping coil F energized. When coil F is
energized, it opened contact F2, making it impossi-
ble for the R coil to energize. Contacts F2 and R2 are
auxiliary contacts and are sometimes mounted on
the outside of the reversing starter. In reversing the
single-phase motor, keep in mind that either the run
or the start winding leads are reversed, not both.

the on-off function of the contacts. The actuating
mechanism may take a number of forms.
Types of Limit Switches 
There are various types of limit switches (Fig. 5-19).
Heavy-duty precision oil-tight (type C) provides
long electrical and mechanical life together with
easy installation and wiring. This type is available in
a variety of head and body styles, including an
explosion-proof version that is also watertight and
submersible. Also available are standard, logic reed,
and power reed contacts, as well as many special
features.
Miniature enclosed reed switch (type XA) is a
small, inexpensive die-cast zinc switch utilizing a her-
metically sealed reed for the contact mechanism. Pre-
wiring and potting, combined with the sealed reed make
this switch a good choice where contact reliability and
environmental immunity are required along with small
size and low cost.
Heavy-duty oil-tight foundry (type FT) is used in
foundries or mills where one or more of the type T fea-
tures (see Fig. 5-19) are required and where hot, falling
sand, or similar foreign material could cause jamming
of other limit (position) switches.
Figure 5-17 shows how this is done with a reversing
starter using single-phase.
LIMIT SWITCHES
As the name implies, the limit switch limits the opera-
tion of a machine that is connected in line with the
switching action (Fig. 5-18). Many industrial produc-
tion lines use this type of switch to limit the travel of
various devices on the line. A good example of the use
of a limit switch is a garage door opener. When the door
is lifted it must stop before it hits the motor. A limit
switch turns off the motor before the door crashes into
the motor that is pulling it up. Then, too, the motor
must be turned off when the door is lowered, or else the
motor keeps running after the door hits the floor. Limit
switches do the job and make it possible for these oper-
ations to be semiautomatic, or once the action has been
initiated, it is limited by limit switches to conform to
the physical conditions.
Limit switches can be used to start, stop, forward,
reverse, recycle, slow down, or speed up various oper-
ations. Inasmuch as they can do all these things, a vari-
ety of sizes and shapes are needed.
Limit switches are made up of two parts, the elec-
trical contacts and the mechanical device that operates

distance to trip the limit switch, regardless of the speed
with which it travels. This type should be used when-
ever machine operation acts at a slow rate of speed or
where machine motion is short. Figure 5-20 shows
some of the wiring diagrams and contact configuration
and terminal wire color code for limit switches.
Gravity return limit switches are designed for
conveyor-type operations with small, lightweight
Snap switches are used on applications requiring a
basic contact mechanism with or without operator where
an enclosure is furnished separately or not required.
There are limit switches designed for special appli-
cations or found to be particularly useful under certain
conditions. Snap-action limit switches are designed to
snap over (trip instantly) once the mechanism that
operates the limit switch has traveled the required

moving objects. They have an extremely light oper-
ating torque and use the action of gravity on the
lever arm to reset the contacts (Fig. 5-21). Limit
switches are also described according to how they
work. They may be top push, spring return, roller
type, rod type, side push, lever type, and maintained
contact.
Limit Switch Circuits
Figure 5-22 shows the limit switch in a single-station,
maintained-contact configuration. The START button
mechanically maintains the contacts that take the place
of hold-in contacts. Pressing the START button main-
tains the circuit. By pressing the STOP button it breaks
the circuit by opening the start contacts. If the contactor
is de-energized by a power failure or overload opera-
tion, the start contacts are unaffected. The motor
restarts automatically.
PRESSURE SWITCHES
The control of pumps, air compressors, welding
machines, lube systems, and machine tools requires
control devices that respond to the pressure of a
medium such as water, air, or oil. The control device
that does this is a pressure switch. It has a set of con-
tacts that are operated by the movement of a piston,
bellows, or diaphragm against a set of springs. The
spring pressure determines the pressures at which the
switch closes and opens it contacts (Fig. 5-23).
Industrial pressure switches are designed for use in
pneumatic and hydraulic systems in a wide variety of
applications. Open types are suitable for panel mount-
ing where permitted. They can be used on air, water,
oil, or any pressure media that is compatible with the
actuator material. However, piston-actuated devices
used on dry gas media will have reduced seal life due
to lack of seal lubrication.
Pressure controls are accurate, rugged, compact,
and adaptable to a wide variety of pressure applications.

lines, provided that a limited amount of leakage is not
objectionable. Phosphate ester-based hydraulic fluids
require a special diaphragm assembly. Figure 5-24
shows the symbols for the various types of pressure-
operated switches.
PUSHBUTTON SWITCHES
Pushbutton switches are used in stations to control
motor operation. Figure 5-25 shows pushbutton sta-
tions fitted with two, three, and six switches. They can
be used to start, stop, forward, and reverse action, as
well as to reset and test or cause up-and-down move-
ment. Pushbutton stations are used in the control cir-
cuits of magnetic starters. They are usable on the great
majority of applications where compact size and
dependable performance is needed. Assembled stations
are available with any combination of push buttons,
selector switches, pilot lights, or special-purpose
devices.
Push buttons can be used in a number of ways to
control motors and manufacturing processes, for
instance: start-stop control, reversing control, two-
speed control, jogging control, thermostat-controlled
The control has a snap-action precision switch
equipped with silver contacts. Contact force is main-
tained at a high value up to the instant of snap-over.
This avoids dead-center conditions. Normal industrial
vibration has little effect on the positive opening and
closing of the contacts. Straight in-line and relatively
friction-free construction provides accurate and consis-
tent operation regardless of the angle at which the con-
trol is mounted.
Long-life copper-alloy bellows are designed for
use with air, water, oil, non-corrosive liquids, vapors,
or gases in a series of pressure ranges from 30 in vac-
uum (Hg) to 900 psi. Stainless steel bellows are avail-
able for use with many of the more corrosive liquids or
gases at pressures up to 375 psi.
Piston-type controls are designed for use on oil
only and must not be used on air or gases, water, or
other liquids that will rust cast iron. All pistons are pro-
vided with a drain, which should be connected to an oil
return line with the reservoir vented to atmosphere.
Drains should never be plugged, as back pressure on
the diaphragm assembly may change the setting and
could result in forcing fluid into the enclosure. Con-
trols with seal rings generally do not require return

MASTER STOP button de-energizes all the circuits.
The circuit in Fig. 5-26 is the basic start-stop cir-
cuit. Two-wire control or under voltage release circuits
are not applicable here because they would be reener-
gized as soon as the MASTER STOP button is released.
SAFETY SWITCHES
A safety switch can be used for motors that can be
placed directly across the line for starting (Fig. 5-27).
This type of switch is operated manually and usually has
a handle on the outside of the enclosure to operate the
switching blades. The switch enclosures are made of
steel or fiberglass-reinforced polyester especially for-
mulated to withstand attack from almost any corrosive
atmosphere found in industrial applications. Electrical
interlocks are available for safety purposes. A pivot arm
operated from the switch mechanism breaks the control
circuit before the main switch blades break. Slow-blow

fuses are usually installed inside the enclosure to handle
the current surge caused by a starting motor.
Manual transfer switches are designed to transfer
loads from one supply to another. They are not fusible.
They are available from 30 to 600 A. Of course, the
higher current switches with four-pole switching are
well over $5000.
SELECTOR SWITCHES
Selector switches can be used for determining the
direction of motor rotation, for starting-stopping and
jogging. They are available in two-, three-, or four-
position configurations. Figure 5-28 shows the switch
and the contact arrangements. Selector switches are

available with a lever operator, coil operator, slot oper-
ator, knob operator, or key operator. They can also be
obtained with a momentary contact where testing a cir-
cuit is necessary.
SINGLE-POLE SWITCHES
Single-pole switches are simple on-off types. They are
made in thousands of different shapes and styles and
can be utilized as a simple on-off switch for a small
motor or can be made into larger motor controllers by
making the switch contacts of different materials.
Many pushbutton switches are single-throw. They use
two contacts, as shown in Fig. 5-29.
the start contacts are unaffected. The motor restarts
automatically. Note the symbol for the maintained con-
tact switch.
TEMPERATURE SWITCHES
Temperature-operated switches are usually referred to
as thermostats. Figure 5-31 shows how the high-
temperature cutout is placed in the circuit. Then note
the location of the thermostat. This particular circuit
has under voltage release and uses a selector switch to
change from automatic operation with the thermostat
in the circuit to one where the thermostat is taken out of
the circuit or the circuit is de-energized by the selector
switch being placed in the no-contact center position.
TOGGLE SWITCHES
Toggle switches are available in many sizes and shapes
and are made for special purposes as well as for motor
control circuits (Fig. 5-32). They are used to turn vari-
ous devices on and off, or to switch from one device to
another. They usually have a metal handle and are
mounted through a round hole. Screw terminals are
usually provided for attaching wires. However, some
may have wire leads furnished. A good example of a
toggle switch is located in the home where it is
mounted on the wall and turns on and off the overhead
light.
TRANSISTOR SWITCHING
One of the functions of the transistor is switching. It is
a very efficient device when it comes to switching.
Another function of the transistor is amplifying. These
functions are discussed in chapter 7.

START-STOP SWITCHES
Start-stop switches take many shapes and can be used
for a number of control purposes. The main concern in
a switch used to turn a motor on and off is its current
rating; that is, will it be able to handle the onrush cur-
rent? Figure 5-30 shows a circuit where the START but-
ton maintains the contacts that take the place of
hold-in contacts. Depressing the START button main-
tains the circuit. Depressing the STOP button breaks the
circuit by opening the start contacts. If the contactor is
de-energized by a power failure or overload operation,

VACUUM SWITCHES
These types of switches use a vacuum for proper oper-
ation (Fig. 5-33). They may have double-throw con-
tacts that are normally open and normally closed so
they can be used to control forward and reverse opera-
tion of a motor.

CHAPTER

put to work.

4. Explain the importance of the air gap and the
armature in a solenoid’s operation.

10. Identify various problems associated with mag-
netic coil devices and their causes.
Observation of the effects of magnetism predate
the discovery of static electricity. Magnetism was dis-
covered about 2600 B.C. Some say it was first
observed by the Chinese; others believe that the Greeks
were the first to observe it. There is a little doubt that
primitive man also noticed its effect but lacked the
knowledge to use it. Certain heavy stones or rocks had
the power to attract and lift similar stones as well as
pieces of iron. The material in these stones was called
magnetite, named by the Greeks for the province of
Magnesia in Asia Minor, where some of the stones
were found. Its properties were later referred to as pos-
sessing magnetism. Magnetism is a property of stones
made of magnetite (Fig. 6-1).
pointed north and the other south. This led to later
development of the magnetic compass. Since this stone
could lead the way for travelers, it was called the
leading stone (later changed to lodestone).
Many years passed with no developments in the
field of magnetism. Then William Gilbert, a physician
to Queen Elizabeth I of England, began studying the
mystery of the lodestone and formed the basic princi-
ples of magnetism. He also experimented with static
electricity and established the use of the word electron.
Others were also experimenting with the properties of
the lodestone at the same time. Many added knowledge
to the field and some have contributed their names to
units of measurement in both electricity and magnet-
ism. These pioneering workers include Alesandro
Volta, Charles Augustin de Coulomb, Andre Marie
Ampere, Luigi Galvani, Hans Christian Oersted, and
Georg Simon Ohm.
Benjamin Franklin caused some interest in elec-
tricity in the United States by flying his kite with metal
objects attached during a thunderstorm. About 80 years
later Michael Faraday of England and Joseph Henry of
the United States each discovered the relationship
between magnetism and electron flow. This discovery
became one of the most important contributions to the
field of electricity and electronics.
After the establishment of this relationship,
progress in the field was quite rapid. Thomas Edison
did a lot of work with the electric motor and the
electric light and developed a generator to produce
electricity. The advent of the transformer led to devel-
opments in the modern era.
SOLENOIDS
One device that grew out of the development of electric
power and its transmission was the solenoid. The sole-
noid is a current-carrying coil used as a magnet. In a
solenoid, there is a tendency for the core to move so
that it encloses the maximum number of magnetic lines
of force, each having the shortest possible path. In
Fig. 6-2 the core is shown outside the coil. Because it is
made of a ferromagnetic material, it presents a low-
reluctance path to the magnetic lines of force at the
north end of the coil. These lines of force concentrate
the soft-iron core and then complete their paths back to
the south pole of the electromagnet.
A movable iron core tends to be pulled to the
center of a solenoid. The electromagnetic lines of force
passing through the core material have thus magne-
tized the core. The direction of the magnetic lines has
produced a south pole in the core at the north end of the
electromagnet. The electromagnetic lines of force

The lodestone is a natural magnet with no definite
shape but a north-south pole alignment.
The Chinese were among the first to record obser-
vations of the stone and its properties. They hung mag-
netite on a string and watched it line up so that one end

current is supplied to it. It closes when the current is
turned off. In general, solenoid valves are used to con-
trol the liquid refrigerant flow into the expansion
valve, or the refrigerant gas flow from the evaporator
when it or the fixture it is controlling reaches the
desired temperature.
The most common application of the solenoid
valve, in the liquid line, operates with a thermostat.
With this hookup, the thermostat may be set for the
desired temperature in the fixture. When the tempera-
ture is reached, the thermostat will open the electrical
circuit and shut off the current to the valve. The sole-
noid valve then closes and shuts off the refrigerant sup-
ply to the expansion valve. The condensing unit
operation should be controlled by a low-pressure
switch. In other applications, where the evaporator is to
be in operation for only a few hours each day, a manu-
ally operated snap switch may be used to open and
close the solenoid valve.
The solenoid valve shown in Fig. 6-4 is operated
with a normally closed status. A direct-acting metal ball
and seat assure tight closing. The two-wire, class W coil
is supplied standard for long life on low-temperature
service or sweating conditions. Current failure or inter-
ruption will cause the valve to fail-safe in the closed
position. The solenoid cover can be rotated 360° for
easy installation. Explosion-proof models are available
for use in hazardous areas.
leave the opposite end of the iron core, and this end is
the north pole of the magnetized core.
An attraction between the north pole of the coil and
the south pole of the iron core tends to pull the core into
the coil. Magnetic lines of force fan outward from the
north pole of the magnetized core. They have a shorter
magnetic path back to the south pole of the coil. As the
iron core is pulled into the coil, this path becomes
increasingly shorter. The magnetic lines of force travel
the shortest possible distance when the core centers
itself in the coil. This movement of the core into the coil
can be harnessed to cause the closing of switch contacts
or the opening of a valve that controls air, gas, hydraulic
fluid, or any other flowing medium.
Solenoid Valves
Solenoid valves are used on many refrigeration sys-
tems. They are electrically operated. A solenoid valve,
when connected as in Fig. 6-3, remains open when

Uses
This solenoid valve is usable with all refriger-
ants except ammonia. It can also be used for air, oil,
water, detergents, butane or propane gas, and other non-
corrosive liquids or gases. A variety of temperature con-
trol installations can be accomplished with these valves.
Such installations include bypass, defrosting, suction
line, hot gas service, humidity control, alcohols,
unloading, reverse cycle, chilled water, cooling tower,
brine, and liquid-line stop installations and ice makers.
Operation
The valves are normally held in the
closed position by the weight of the plunger assembly
and the fluid pressure on top of the valve ball. The
valve opens by energizing the coil and magnetically
lifting the plunger and allowing full flow by the valve
ball. De-energizing the coil permits the plunger and
valve ball to return to the closed position.
Automatic Gas Furnace
Solenoid
The solenoid shown in Fig. 6-5 is used to control the
flow of natural gas into a furnace. When heat is desired,
the thermostat in the room goes on, making contact and
completing the circuit through the power supply to the
valve coil. The energized coil creates a magnetic field
that lifts the plunger. This allows pressurized gas to
flow through the inlet at the left side of the valve body,
beneath the plunger, and through the outlet at the right.
When the room reaches the desired temperature, the
thermostat breaks the circuit and the plunger drops
back into the valve seat, shutting off the flow of gas.
can affect the operation of the solenoid. The armature
gap and the coil’s ability to handle current and voltage
are part of the designer’s concerns. They are also part
of the maintenance person’s concern, inasmuch as
these factors contribute to the malfunctioning, in time,
of the solenoids used to control motors and processes
in industry and commerce.
Eddy Currents in the Armature
and Core
Eddy currents are generated any time a varying mag-
netic field is brought near a piece of metal (Fig. 6-6).
Eddy currents can create heat and cause problems. In
the ac solenoid note that the core and armature are
made of laminated steel. Lamination of the steel core
and armature reduce the buildup of heat produced by
eddy currents. Eddy currents meet with high opposi-
tion in a lamination. Laminations are sheets of metal
rather than a solid piece. Direct current solenoids
are made with a solid core, inasmuch as the mag-
netic field varies only when the coil is energized and
de-energized.

Generation of eddy currents in an open core.
Air Gap and the Armature
The armature completes the path of the magnetic
lines of force. It is important that the armature
matches or fits the rest of the magnetic assembly of
the solenoid. A close fit leads to less chattering. Very
close tolerances are required in the fitting of the sur-
faces. However, some problems are associated with
the armature being too closely mated to the rest of the
magnetic (iron) circuit. Inasmuch as residual magnet-
ism is generated by the electric current producing the
magnetic field, it has a tendency not to let go when
CONSTRUCTION OF SOLENOIDS
The manufacture of solenoids warrants closer atten-
tion. Some parts and their interaction make for certain
considerations by their manufacturer. Eddy currents

SOLENOID COILS
The coils of solenoids have special needs. They are the
source of the magnetic field when energized. There-
fore, the amount of current and voltage needed for
their operation is a result of their intended use. More
current is needed to energize the coil than to keep it
energized, especially when the coil is used on alternat-
ing current. A coil has inductive reactance that is the
product of the inductance of the coil and the frequency
of the current times a factor of 2π. This inductive
reactance is measured in ohms () and in some
instances is referred to as impedance (Z). This means
that the coil has a tendency to hold back the flow of
current after it is energized and pulls in the core mater-
ial to change its inductance. The inrushing current pro-
duces a magnetic field that extends past the first coil of
wire into those on top of it, thus inducing an EMF that
is in the direction opposite to that which caused it.
Inasmuch as alternating current is constantly chang-
ing, in most instances 120 times per second (60 Hz), it
the current is turned off in the coil. The residual mag-
netism holds the armature closely even after the
power has been removed. That is why a small air gap
is left in the iron circuit. This allows the magnetic
field to be broken and the armature to drop away after
the coil is de-energized (Fig. 6-7).
SHADING COILS
Shading coils are used on ac solenoids to reduce the
chatter produced by the varying electric current
through the coil and thus the varying magnetic field
produced in the iron circuit. Figure 6-8 shows how the
shading coil is placed on the magnetic assembly. The
shading coil is a single ring of heavy-duty wire. A
moving magnetic field causes current to be induced
into this single turn in much the same way as in the sec-
ondary of a transformer. The induced current is slightly
out of phase with the current that is flowing in the coil
circuit. The result is a magnetic field, even though
slightly less than the original field, that is slightly
behind the rise and fall of the original field produced
by the coil. By being slightly behind in its peak, the
induced field created by the shading coil has a ten-
dency to fill in when the original drops to zero. This
has a tendency to hold the armature close to the mag-
netic circuit and reduces the chatter that would other-
wise result from a varying magnetic field.

does not always meet the physical limitations imposed
by the inductance of the coil and there is an opposition
generated (XL) greater than the resistance of the coil’s
copper wire.
The inrush current is about 6 to 10 times as great as
is needed to hold the armature to the magnetic assem-
bly. Some heat is generated when the coil is energized
for a period of time. The coil is rated in terms of volt-
amperes (VA). Volt-amperes are the product of the
volts times the amperes it takes to cause the coil to
energize.
Sealed Current Rating
If a coil has a VA rating of 300 and 30 VA sealed, the
inrush current of the 120-V coils is 300 VA/120 V.
This means that it takes a current of 2.5 A to produce
300 VA. If the sealed current of the same coil (that
is, the current it pulls when the solenoid is com-
pletely closed) is 30/120, the sealed current will be
0.25 A. The same solenoid with a 480-V coil will
draw 300/480 or 0.625 A inrush and 30/480 or
0.0625 A sealed. As you can see, the VA rating of the
coil can be useful in determining the amount of cur-
rent drawn at the start and at the hold-in condition of
the solenoid.
Coil Voltage
Voltage ratings of coils are determined by the manu-
facturer. The number of turns of wire and the size of the
wire make a difference in the voltage it takes to ener-
gize the coil. Keep in mind also that the amount of cur-
rent drawn by the coil is determined by the number of
turns (dc resistance of the wire) and the core material.
Core material and the turns as well as the length and
diameter of the coil determine its inductance. The
inductance is an important factor when considering ac
operation of the coil.
Pickup voltage is the lowest voltage at which the
coil armature will start to move. Seal-in voltage is the
lowest voltage required to cause the armature to seat
against the pole faces of the magnet. Dropout voltage is
the voltage at which the armature will start to lose its
attraction to the magnet and fall back to its open posi-
tion (Fig. 6-9).
Pickup voltage is usually higher than seal-in
voltage for most solenoids. However, there are some
exceptions to this general statement, such as the
bell-crank armature solenoid and magnetic assem-
bly. Figure 6-10 shows the types of solenoid con-
struction.
Effects of Voltage Variation
Low-control voltage produces low coil currents and
reduced magnetic pull. On devices with vertical
action assemblies, if the voltage is greater than pickup
voltage, but less than seal-in voltage, the controller
may pick up but will not seal. With this condition, the
coil current will not fall to the sealed value. As the
coil is not designed to carry continuously a current
greater than its sealed current, it will quickly get very
hot and burn out. The armature will also chatter. In
addition to the noise, wear on the magnet faces results
(Fig. 6-11).

ALTERNATING CURRENT HUM 
All ac devices that incorporate a magnetic effect pro-
duce a characteristic hum. This hum or noise is mainly
due to the changing magnetic pull (as the flux changes)
inducing mechanical vibrations. Contactors, starters,
and relays could become excessively noisy as a result
of some of the following operating conditions:

REVIEW PROBLEMS
A solenoid has a coil. The coil has inductance and
inductive reactance when used on alternating current.
Impedance (Z) is also a factor in some instances when
inductive reactance and resistance are both present. A
quick review of these two important factors makes you
aware of their presence and the need to understand
their role in the proper operation of solenoids on alter-
nating current.

RELAYS
A relay is a device designed for remote control of
another device. The word relay is defined as to pass on.
That is what the electromagnetic device does. A relay
uses low voltage and low current to cause switching of
high voltage or high current, usually at a distant or
remote location.
Relay Solenoids
The relay puts to work the solenoid and its ability to
generate an attracting magnetic force. A practical
example of the solenoid principle is the relay (Fig. 7-1).
One or more sets of contacts are associated with the
moving armature of a relay. These serve as electrical
contacts and make or break when the relay current is
switched on and off. 
The relay contacts can be arranged for a variety of
functions, such as SPST (single-pole single-throw),
SPDT (single-pole double throw), DPDT (double-pole
double-throw), or other desired combinations.
The advantage of the relay is the substantial pulling
power that can be developed with a small coil current.
The contacts themselves can be made quite large and
can handle and switch high values of electrical power.
An extremely small amount of control power can be
used to switch much higher voltages and currents in a
safe manner.
Uses for Relays
Relays are used to control the start and stop operations
of small electric motors. Figure 7-2 shows how mag-
netic frames and armature assemblies are used to control
the large currents used in the motor circuits. Figure 7-3
shows a DPDT relay that can be used to remotely con-
trol an electric motor or other electrical devices.
Relay Armature
Note how the armature of the relay is connected to a set
of contacts so that when the armature moves to its closed
position, the contacts also closed (Fig. 7-2). The electro-
magnet makes the difference between a remote control
possibility and a manual control. The electromagnet

that some manufacturers do not recommend sanding
contacts, but simply replacing with a new set.
SOLID-STATE RELAYS
Solid state refers to relays made with silicon or germa-
nium materials that operate on the same basic princi-
ples as transistors and diodes. In most instances the
relay is nothing more than a transistor, either PNP or
NPN type. In other instances the solid-state relay is a
silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR). Of course, the cir-
cuit arrangements are such as to allow the switching
needed for the relay action. Other features, not readily
available in electromechanical relays, are also available
in this type of relay. As with everything, there are advan-
tages and some limitations or disadvantages. In most
instances the manufacturer will point to the advantages
and you have to become aware of the limitations by
closely examining the information provided by the
manufacturer of the device.
One of the first differences noted between electro-
mechanical and solid-state relays is the absence of a
coil and no contacts. The solid-state relay needs very
low voltage and current to to do its job of switching.
The transistor or SCR do the actual switching and the
change in control voltage causes the semiconductor
device to conduct or not conduct according to the con-
trol voltage applied to its elements. Figure 7-5 is an
example of a solid-state relay.
consists of a coil of wire placed on an iron core. When
current flows through the coil, the iron bar, called the
armature, is attracted by the magnetic field created by
the current in the coil. To this extent, both will contact
the iron bar. 
The electromagnet can be compared to the perma-
nent magnet; however, the electromagnet does have the
ability to be turned on and off electrically. Interrupting
the current flow to the coil or electromagnet causes it to
de-energize. This means that it will cause the armature
to open and return to its original position, with the con-
tacts no longer making contact. That means that the
electrical circuit connected to the contacts is then open
or broken. A low voltage and small current can be used
to energize the coil. This, in turn, causes the contacts to
close and turn on the device connected to the relay con-
tacts circuit. By making certain modifications, it is pos-
sible to make some rather useful motor controllers.
Relay Contacts
If the contacts of a relay are pitted or burned, it calls for
a burnishing (polishing) so that they will close tightly
against one another and complete the circuit. This can
be done with the power off. Place a piece of sandpaper
(very fine grain) between the contacts and hold the
contacts closed. Then move the sandpaper until it sands
down the high points on the contacts. Use an even finer
grade and polish the points further. Make sure that you
do not get the contacts to the point where they no
longer “mate” properly. It may be sufficient to use a
tool such as that shown in Fig. 7-4. It should be noted

Transistor
Inasmuch as the transistor is the device used to do
the switching in a solid-state relay; it may be a good
idea at this point to take a closer look at its operation

(Fig. 7-6). The transistor is the key element in this
type of relay. There are three elements in a transistor:
base, collector, and emitter. The base-to-emitter volt-
age of the transistor can control the current flow
between the emitter and the collector. In this PNP
(positive-negative-positive) type of transistor, a nega-
tive voltage on the base allows emitter-base current to
flow. This is due to the properties of the silicon-doped
material at the junction of the emitter and base. The
emitter-base voltage can then cause the transistor to
conduct current from the emitter to the collector. A
positive voltage on the base and negative on the emitter
prevents emitter-base current from flowing, and the
transistor stops conducting. This means that it behaves
as a closed contact in the first state and as an open con-
tact in the second. This means that the current flow
from emitter to collector can be controlled by a small
voltage change in the base-emitter connection. There
are no moving parts and no contacts to be concerned
with at this time. However, there are limitations on how
much current the transistor will conduct. The fact that
there are no moving contacts, wear or arcing, deteriora-
tion or vibration, or dust and dirt damage makes the
solid-state relay very much in demand.
Surge Protection
Solid-state devices are sometimes used with magnetic
switches. This means that a voltage transient suppressor
may be needed to prevent some of the harmful electri-
cal impulses generated by electromagnetic devices on
the line. Figure 7-7 shows a transient suppressor, and
Fig. 7-8 shows a transient suppressor mounted on a
magnetic relay.
Triacs
Triacs are also used in solid-state switching. Since the
SCR can control current in only one direction, it is lim-
ited in its applications. The triac can conduct in both
directions. The triac has the same characteristics as the
SCR. This means that the triac can be thought of as two
SCRs placed in parallel but connected in the opposite
direction.
Triac Construction
Examine the drawing of the
triac in Fig. 7-9. The triac has three terminals: main ter-
minal 1 (MT1), main terminal 2 (MT2), and gate (G).
By examining the PN structure of the triac it can be seen
that current can pass through a PNPN layer, or it can
pass through an NPN. The device can be described as
having an NPNP layer in parallel with a PNPN layer.
This arrangement of four-layer material gives the triac
a connection of two SCRs in parallel. This connection
is shown in Fig. 7-10. The connection in Fig. 7-10 is
not how the triac operates. That is because the triac
gate voltage responds differently than the SCR gate
voltage. Figure 7-11 shows the schematic diagram of
the triac. Because the triac can conduct current in both
directions, the schematic diagram contains two diodes
facing in opposite directions.

Surge suppressors.

Triac Applications
Because the triac can conduct in
both directions, it is best when used to control ac
power. Take a look at the diagram in Fig. 7-12. In this
circuit, full power is applied to the load when the gate
is triggered on. When S, is open, the triac cannot con-
duct. This is because the voltage applied to the triac is
below the break-over point. When S, is closed, the triac
is triggered on, and both halves of the ac power are
applied to the load. This differs from SCR operation.
The SCR can apply only half of the power to the load
because it conducts in only one direction. The advan-
tage of all thyristors is that small gate currents can con-
trol large load currents.
The triac conducts in both directions and requires a
small current to operate. It does, however, have some
disadvantages compared to the SCR. The SCR has
higher current ratings than the triac. The triac can han-
dle currents up to 25 A, whereas the SCR can safely
handle currents of around 800 A. That means when
large currents are required the SCR is the better choice.
There are some differences in the frequency-
handling abilities of the SCR and triac. The triac is usu-
ally slower in turning on when used with an inductive
load, such as when it is used to control a motor. The
triac is also designed to operate mainly in the low-
frequency range of 30 to 400 Hz. The SCR can safely
handle frequencies up to 30 kHz.
Silicon-Controlled Rectifiers
The silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) is a three-
junction semiconductor device that can operate as a
switch (Fig. 7-13). It is basically a rectifier. It will con-
duct current in only one direction. The best part of SCR
operation is its ability to be turned on and off. The on-off
action makes the SCR very useful in controlling current.

Construction of the SCR
Construction details of a
component provide information about how the com-
ponent will operate. Solid-state devices are made by
joining P and N material into junction or junctions.
Bipolar transistors, diodes, and FETs (field effect tran-
sistor) are all constructed this way. The SCR is made
by joining four alternating layers of P and N material.
Most SCRs are made of silicon, but germanium is also
used (Fig. 7-14).
In Fig. 7-14, note how the layers of P and N mate-
rial are sandwiched together. Also note the three junc-
tions. Leads for external connections are attached to
these layers. These three connections are called the
anode (A), cathode (K), and gate (G).
Now take a look at the schematic diagram of the
SCR shown in Fig. 7-13. The schematic symbol is
about the same as that for a rectifier diode. The main
difference is the gate. In some cases the circle around the
symbol is not shown. The leads may not be identified on
a schematic drawing. When the leads are marked, they
are identified with the letters A, K, and G. 
Operation of the SCR
Inasmuch as the SCR is a
semiconductor device, it requires a biasing voltage
to cause it to turn on. Figure 7-15 shows a simplified
arrangement that causes the SCR to operate. A
switch is used in the gate circuit to apply voltage to
the gate.
Resistor R, is used to limit the current flow in the
gate circuit. A second voltage source supplies the
needed forward bias to the anode and cathode. A resis-
tor is in series with the anode-cathode circuit. This
resistor is also used as a current-limiting resistor. It pre-
vents high currents from causing damage to the SCR.
Without the resistor, the SCR conducts hard in forward
bias and burns out after a short operating period. A spe-
cific gate current must be reached before the SCR will
become a conductor. Each SCR has its own break-over
voltage. This means that each SCR must have the
proper forward bias applied and the proper gate current
in order to operate effectively as a switch. 
Alternating Current Operation of the SCR
The
SCR can be used to control dc or ac. Since it is a rec-
tifier, it operates on only one ac alternation. The SCR
conducts only when the input cycle makes the anode
positive and the cathode negative (Fig. 7-16). By

Layer construction of the SCR.

When a phase failure occurs on L2 or L3, the shunt
trip coil draws power from L1 through the control
relay (CR) contacts and phase-failure relay contacts
(which change state on detecting a phase failure). If a
phase failure occurs on L1, the CR contacts change
state. The shunt trip coil draws power from L2 through
the CR contacts and phase-failure relay contacts.
If the control relay contacts, the phase-failure relay
contacts, or the shunt trip coil does not have the same
voltage rating as the motor, control transformers may
be interposed where needed.
Load-side monitoring is shown in Fig. 7-19. With
the relay connected directly to the motor, the total feed
lines are monitored. The motor may sustain a momen-
tary bump in the reverse direction with this connection.
closing S, a positive voltage is developed that turns the
SCR on. The series resistor is in the gate circuit for
current-limiting purposes. The diode is in the circuit to
protect the anode and cathode during reverse voltage
operation.
If S is closed, the SCR conducts when the proper
polarity appears at the anode. If the gate switch is
opened, the SCR continues to conduct until the voltage
between the anode and cathode falls below the break-
over voltage. Once the voltage falls below this level,
the SCR remains off until S is closed again.
There are many advantages to the use of an SCR
over an electrical switch. For instance, the SCR will not
wear out. It will not develop contact arcing, nor will it
stick in one position. This means that the SCR is a more
reliable component than the mechanical switch, espe-
cially in high current applications. The SCR may be
controlled by a switch, or it may be controlled by an
electrical pulse from a computer. The most important
characteristic is that a small amount of power applied
to the gate controls large amounts of current to a load.
PHASE-FAILURE RELAYS
Interchanging any two phases of a three-phase induc-
tion motor power source causes the motor to reverse its
direction of rotation. This is called phase reversal. In
elevators and other industrial operations, equipment
damage and personnel injuries may result when a phase
reversal occurs unexpectedly. This can happen if a fuse
blows or a wire to a motor breaks while the motor is
running. The motor continues to operate on single
phase but that causes serious overheating. Phase failure
and phase-failure reversal relays are used to protect
motors against these situations.
Both voltage-sensing and current-sensing phase
failure relays are available. Voltage-sensing relays
may be connected at any point on the lines, but only
detect abnormal conditions ahead of the point of con-
nection. Voltage sensing offers the advantage of being
able to detect abnormal conditions independent of
motor running status. They are also easy to apply since
motor voltage is all that is required to select the relay.
Figure 7-17 shows line-side monitoring. With the relay
connected before the starter, the motor cannot be
started in the reverse direction. However, the motor is
unprotected against phase failures between the relay
and the motor.
Phase-failure relays are often used to control a
shunt trip circuit breaker. When this is done, care must
be taken to ensure that the shunt trip circuit always has
an adequate source available. This can be accom-
plished by using the diagram shown in Fig. 7-18. 
Phase-Failure Relays  
119

Line side monitoring. (Square D).
Fig. 7-18

circuit breaker. (Square D)

Current-sending relays require three externally
connected current transformers. These must be sized to
match the motor full-load current. Current sensing
offers the advantage of being able to detect imbalances
more precisely by monitoring currents. Relay selection
is independent of motor voltage and requires a separate
120-V source or supply.
Three-wire control is necessary with current con-
trol to prevent the relay from “cycling” on and off
when an open phase or phase reversal occurs. See
Fig. 7-20. Due to the current-sensing features of this
relay, the load must first draw current before a reverse-
phase condition can be sensed. This means that this
relay is not used for protecting motors driving equip-
ment unable to tolerate a momentary “bump” in the
reverse direction.
Figure 7-21 shows three types of phase-failure
relays. These offer the reliability and accuracy of solid-
state sensing circuitry with the isolation of hard output
contacts. NIPS is a phase-failure and under voltage
relay. DAS is a phase-failure relay. DAS and MPS are
used by Square D to designate this type of relay.

the relay is wired in the circuit and how its contacts
operate.
In electromechanical type of relays, the pull-in
voltage means that the voltage necessary to cause the
relay coil to energize is enough to pull the armature to
the coil core and thereby close the contacts attached to
the armature. In the semiconductor or solid-state type
of relay it refers to the voltage needed to cause proper
biasing of the transistor or semiconductor device to
energize or conduct, thereby lowering its emitter-
collector resistance or forward conduction resistance
of the SCR or triac.
The term dropout voltage means the same in both
electromechanical and semiconductor solid-state relays.
The dropout voltage is lower than the voltage it takes
for the relay to energize. In other words, the relay will
continue to be energized between the pull-in and
dropout voltages once it is energized. However, once
the voltage has reached a point where there is not
enough current flowing to cause a sufficient magnetic
field to hold the armature to the core, it will open. In
the case of the solid-state relay, it is the point at which
the device stops conducting or turns off. The solid-state
relay has no armature to pull in or drop out. It takes
very little difference in voltage to cause the voltage
monitoring relay to drop out or stop conducting. It also
makes this type of relay very useful in operating with
computer signals. It is very useful in digitally con-
trolled logic circuits.
Current Relay
This relay is almost identical to the voltage monitoring
relay except that it monitors the variations in current. It
is also hooked up differently (Fig. 7-24). The relay
monitors ac single-phase and dc (independent of polar-
ity) currents. The relay has independent adjustable
controls for both pickup and dropout current. The relay
energizes when the supply voltage is present and the
SOLID-STATE MONITORING
RELAYS
Solid-state monitoring relays use solid-state sensing
circuitry with the isolation of hard output contacts.
This type of monitoring is both accurate and reliable.
Figure 7-22 shows the enclosure of several types of
monitoring relays. All of these relays have an LED
indication when the relay is energized.
Voltage Relay
The relay monitors ac single-phase and dc (indepen-
dent of polarity) voltages. The relay has independent
adjustable controls for both pickup and dropout volt-
age. The relay energizes when the supply voltage is
present and the monitored voltage is above the pickup
setting. The relay de-energizes when the supply voltage
is removed or the monitored voltage is below the
dropout setting. The dropout voltage is adjustable from
50 to 95% of pickup voltage. Figure 7-23 shows how

monitored current is above the pickup setting. The
relay de-energizes when the supply voltage is removed
or the monitored current is below the dropout setting.
The dropout current is adjustable from 50 to 95% of
the pickup current.
Over/Under Relay
This type of relay monitors single-phase voltages and
requires no additional supply voltage (Fig. 7-25). Over
voltage is adjustable from 100 to 110% of nominal
voltage. Under voltage is adjustable from 80 to 100%
of nominal voltage. The relay energizes when voltage
is between these two settings.
Zero-Current Turn-Off
One of the unique features
of a semiconductor or solid-state relay is its ability to
automatically turn off when the ac load current sine
wave is crossing its zero axis. This property of a
solid-state device is very important when switching
inductive loads, since the turn-off occurs when the
current is at its minimum point on the sine wave. This
reduces the inductive kickback that often sustains an
arc in the electromechanical relay contacts. Inductive
kickback increases voltage spikes that can damage
semiconductors.
Zero-Voltage Turn-On
Zero-voltage turn-on is not
necessarily available on solid-state relays. It is one
condition that can be added to a solid-state relay to pro-
vide certain features that will greatly extend the life of
some types of loads.
TYPES OF SOLID-STATE RELAY
SWITCHING
The three types of relay switching that can be accom-
plished by the solid-state relay are the instant on (IO),
the universal (US), and the zero switch (ZS). Each of
these relays is designed to switch on at different locations
on the sine wave and for good reasons. The type of
load—resistive, inductive, lamp, or a combination of
these—determines the type of relay to select for the job.
The instant-on (IO) type turns on immediately as
soon as the control input is switched. That means that it
can turn on at any point on the sine wave. However, the
turn-off of the instant-on type is always at the zero
point where the current crosses the zero point of the
sine wave (Fig. 7-26).
The universal-type solid-state relay turns on within
a given window on the ac sine wave (Fig. 7-26). The
universal relay does not turn on at the zero point or at
the peak of the sine wave. This type of relay can turn on
only inside the given window. The universal relay turns
off at zero current, just as in the other two basic types
of solid-state relays.
The zero switch has an advantage in handling the
turn-on surges so often associated with a circuit. This
type of relay monitors the load circuit to make sure that
it turns off when the sine wave passes through the zero
point on the sine wave.
Switching Relay Loads
Relays are designed to take into consideration the char-
acteristics of inductive loads, resistive loads, and varia-
tions of these two types. One of the advantages of the
solid-state relay is its ability to turn on or off at the zero
point of the sine wave. Some devices benefit more than
others if switched at these points. For instance, resis-
tive loads such as light bulbs have a low resistance
when cold and higher resistance when hot. If they are
turned on cold, they can draw large amounts of current,
at least more than normal operating current, which will

energizes when the supply voltage is present and the
thermistor resistance is below 1.9 k (range of 1.5 
to 2.3 ). The relay de-energizes when the supply volt-
age is removed or the thermistor resistance increases
above 3 k (range of 2.5 to 3.6 k).
Contact Amplifier Relay
Contact amplifier relays are used in cases where con-
tacts do not have sufficient current and voltage ratings
to switch loads such as coils, solenoids, or small
motors. Typical examples are manometer contacts or
supervisory relays for broken wire at wire-producing
machines (Fig. 7-28).
Load Detector and Load
Converter Relays
The load on an induction motor can be monitored
with the right choice of solid-state circuitry. The load
detector relay and the load converter relay shown in
Fig. 7-29 are used to control equipment and processes
shorten their life. When turned on at the zero point it
gives the filaments time to heat up and change resis-
tance slightly and keep the surge down to a manageable
point, and in turn extends the life of the bulb or lamp.
Zero-point switching also eliminates noise spikes. This
means that a zero-switching relay should be used with
lamps and other types of resistive loads.
Other types of load do not necessarily respond well
to zero switching. Inductive loads are one type that
need an instant-on type of relay. This is due to the
nature of an inductive load presented by a motor, trans-
former, or solenoid coil. With an inductive load the cur-
rent and voltage are nearly 90° out of phase. This
means that the current is lagging the voltage by this
amount and that there is no inductive reactance to
increase the opposition to current flow at the instant
when starting voltage is applied. This also means that
there is a large current draw when the voltage is at the
zero-crossing point of the sine wave. Switching at any
point other than zero is preferable for an inductive load.
Loads consisting of lamps are also resistive, but the
inrush current is high (up to 15 times normal operating
currents) due to the low resistance of the cold fila-
ments. This high inrush current can do great damage to
relays. The main concern here is the inrush current at
the start of operation. That means that a zero switching
relay can be of some advantage with this type of load.
However, the inrush currents should be taken into con-
sideration when choosing the proper relay for the job.
When there is a combination of resistive and induc-
tive loads in a circuit to be switched, it is best to use the
universal relay. This type of relay does not switch at the
zero point or at the peak point of the sine wave. There-
fore, it is often selected for a combination load.
Thermistor Relay
The thermistor relay operates from the signal of exter-
nally connected thermistors. See Fig. 7-27. The relay

by monitoring the load of an induction motor. The
devices simulate the true output power of the motor by
measuring the input voltage, current, power factor, and
compensating for internal losses of the motor. Using
these parameters, the output power is computed contin-
uously. In an induction motor, the current varies as the
input voltage varies. By computing power, the load
relays are not affected by these variations and can pro-
vide much greater accuracy over a wider range of load
than is possible by measuring current alone. Three
relay models are available. One type provides both a
maximum and a minimum trip point, a second type
provides two maximum trip points, and a third type
provides an analog current output.
Three types of load detectors are available. The
type V load detector monitors the motor load and has
two separate output relays to indicate when a trip point
has been exceeded. On the type V3, the two output
relays correspond to a maximum and minimum trip
point. On the type V4, the two output relays correspond
to two maximum trip points. Two separate pushbutton
thumbwheel switches, located on the face of the
device, are used to select the trip points. The load
detector has two SPDT relay outputs, to indicate maxi-
mum or minimum trip points exceeded. The unit is also
adjustable for startup delay, response delay, and com-
pensation of motor losses. LEDs indicate power on,
maximum trip, or minimum trip.
Typical Applications
Either the type V3 load detector or the type G load
converter is used in a crusher-conveyor situation
(Fig. 7-30). The load converter can monitor the crusher
load and feed the output signal to an adjustable-
frequency drive controlling the feeder conveyor motor.
In this way the load on the crusher is kept constant by
varying the speed of the conveyor. If an adjustable
drive is not used, the load detector starts and stops the
conveyor motor to keep the load on the crusher within
preset limits.
The type V load detector has a monitoring resolu-
tion fine enough to determine worn tools on machinery.
See Fig. 7-31. When monitoring a drill motor, the drill
is stopped when the drill bit is dull. This extends the
life of tools and prevents breakage problems. By con-
tinuously monitoring the power consumption of a fan
motor, an accurate indication of the system status can
be obtained. The V load detector monitors the loading
on three-phase motors and controls and protects fan
systems. See Fig. 7-32.
The load detector can simultaneously monitor four
common problems that may occur in heating, ventilat-
ing, and air-conditioning systems: broken or loose fan
belts, closed dampers, blocked filters, and mechanical
wear on the motor (such as bearings).
Figure 7-33 shows how the load detector and the
load converter are connected in a circuit. Figure 7-34
shows the outputs of the type V3 unit that can be used to
disconnect a motor when load limits are exceeded. In a
three-wire control scheme, normal operating mode,
with an alarm signal, the relay is wired as shown.
The typical load converter monitors the motor load
and generates a 0- to 20-mA or 4- to 20-mA output sig-
nal proportional to the load on the motor. An integra-
tion adjustment on the face of the device smoothes the
output signal from short-term variations in the input
signals. Two separate pushbutton thumbwheel switches
on the face of the device are used to select the zero
point of the range and the span. The output signal can

over current protection. This is possible because the
most vulnerable part of most motors is the winding
insulation, and this insulation is very susceptible to
damage by excessively high temperature.
Being a thermal model for a motor, the thermal over-
load relay produces a shorter trip time at higher current
similar to the way in which a motor reaches its tempera-
ture limit in a shorter time at a higher current. In a high
ambient temperature, a thermal overload relay trips at a
lower current, or vice versa, allowing the motor to be used
to its maximum capacity in its particular ambient temper-
ature (if the motor and overload are in the same ambient).
After it is tripped, the thermal overload relay does
not reset until it has cooled. This allows the motor to
cool before it can be restarted.
Types of Thermal Overload
Relays
There are two types of thermal overload relays: bimetallic
and melting alloy. In some types the. bimetallic is available
in both non-compensated and ambient-temperature-
compensated versions. In both melting alloy and
bimetallic, single-element and three-element overloads
are available. See Fig. 7-36 for a cutaway view of a
standard trip melting alloy thermal unit. With the excep-
tions of a few types, all thermal overloads incorporate a
trip-free reset mechanism that allows the relay to trip on
be selected to increase with load or decrease as load
increases. An LED indicates when power is applied to
the device.
THERMAL OVERLOAD RELAYS
Thermal overload relays sense motor current by con-
verting this current to heat in a resistance element. The
heat generated is used to open a normally closed con-
tact in series with a starter coil causing the motor to be
disconnected (Fig. 7-35).
The thermal overload relay is simple and inexpen-
sive. It is very effective in providing motor-running

an overload even though the reset lever is blocked or
held in the reset position. This mechanism also prevents
the control circuit contact from being reclosed until the
overload relay and the motor have cooled.
Hand-Reset Melting Alloy 
(NEMA Style)
Hand-reset melting alloy overload relays use a eutectic
alloy solder that responds to the heat produced in a
heater element by the motor current. When tripped, the
overload relay is reset manually after allowing a few
minutes for the motor and the relay to cool and the sol-
der to solidify.
Repeated tripping does not affect the original cali-
bration. Melting-alloy thermal units are available in
three designs: quick trip, standard trip, and slow trip.
Quick trip (class 10) units are used to protect hermeti-
cally sealed, submersible pump, and other motors that
can endure locked rotor current for a very short time, or
motors that have a low ratio of locked rotor to full-load
current. Standard trip (class 20) units provide trip char-
acteristics for normal motor acceleration up to approx-
imately 7 seconds on a full-voltage start. Slow trip
(class 30) units provide trip characteristics for motor
acceleration up to approximately 12 seconds on a full-
voltage start. The motor should be suitable for
extended starting periods.
Overload Relay Class Designation
Class 10
Relay will trip in 10 seconds or less at a
current equal to 600% of its current rating.
It is used with hermetic motors, submersible
pumps, or motors with short locked-rotor
time capability.
Class 20
Relay will trip in 20 seconds or less at a
current equal to 600 times its current rating. 
Class 30
Relay will trip in 30 seconds or less at a
current equal to 600 times its current rating.
General applications call for a class 20 thermal relay.
Bimetallic Overloads 
(NEMA Style)
Bimetallic overload relays are used where the controller
is remote or difficult to reach. Three-wire control is rec-
ommended when automatic restarting of a motor could
be hazardous to personnel.
Normally, bimetallic relays are used on automatic
reset. They are supplied from the factory on hand reset,
but can be adjusted for either hand or automatic reset in
the field. When used on hand reset, allow the motor and
thermal units a few minutes to cool before resetting.
Temperature Compensation
Ambient temperature compensation is available on
some overload relays (Fig. 7-37). These relays have all
the features of the non-compensated bimetallics. In
addition, an extra bimetal element maintains a nearly
constant trip current in relay temperatures from 20 to
165°F for one type and 4 to 131oF for the other
type. Trip current is adjustable from 85 to 115% of the
trip current ratings. A SPDT contact is standard on the
25- and 45-A sizes. The NO contact can be used in an

instruction sheet that is included with every starter or
overload relay. If it is desirable to order thermal units
along with the controller, they should be selected from a
catalog with specifications listed and based on the type
of controller being ordered and the nameplate full-load
current of the motor. If the motor full-load current is not
known at the time thermal units are ordered, an approx-
imate selection can be made using Table 7-1 as follows:

alarm circuit and must be wired on the same polarity as
the NC contact. Contacts are not replaceable. 
Protection Level
Protection level is the relationship
between trip current rating and full-load current. Pro-
tection level is in percent and is the trip current rating
divided by the motor full-load current times 100. Check
with the manufacturer of the thermal relay (usually
listed with instructions in tables in the back of the cata-
log) to make sure that the correct unit is selected for the
job the motor is expected to do.
Thermal units are not included with any overload
relays. They are selected and ordered and priced sepa-
rately. Ideally, thermal units should be selected from the

aUse only when motor full-load current is not known.Thermal units selected using approximate full-load currents from the table will pro-
vide a trip current between 100 and 125% of full-load current for many four-pole, single-speed, normal-torque, 60-Hz motors. Since the
full-load current rating of different makes and types of motors vary so widely, these selections may not be suitable.Thermal units should
be selected on the basis of motor nameplate full-load current and service factor. Thermal unit sizes originally selected on an approxi-
mate basis should always be rechecked and corrected at the time of installation if required.
Note: These currents should not be used for selection of fuses, circuit breakers, or wire sizes. See NEC tables 430–148 through
430–150. For motor rated 208 to 220 V, use the 230 V column. For motors rated 440 to 550 V, use 460 and 575 V columns, respectively.

Ambient-temperature correction curves for thermal
overload relays are given in Fig. 7-38.
Mounting Thermal Units
Always be certain the
correct thermal units are installed in the starter before
operating a motor. Thermal units should always be
mounted so that their type designation can be read
from the front of the starter (Fig. 7-39). Melting-alloy
thermal units should be mounted so that the tooth of
the pawl assembly can engage the teeth of the ratchet
wheel when the reset button is pushed. Mounting sur-
faces of the starter and thermal units should be clean.
Make sure that the thermal unit mounting screws are
securely fastened.
ELECTROMAGNETIC RELAYS AND
MOTORS
Relays are a necessary part of many control and pilot
light circuits. They are similar in design to contactors,
but are generally lighter in construction, so they carry
smaller currents. 
Magnetic contactors are normally used for starting
poly-phase motors, either squirrel cage or single phase.
Contactors may be connected at any convenient point
in the main circuit between the fuses and the motor.
Small-diameter control wires may be run between the
contactor and the point of control.
Protection of the motor against prolonged overload
is accomplished by time-limit overload relays that are
operative during the starting period and running period.
Relay action is delayed long enough to take care of
heavy starting currents and momentary overloads with-
out tripping.
Motors for commercial condensing units on refrig-
eration or air-conditioning systems are normally pro-
tected by a metallic switch operated on the thermo, or
heating principle. This is a built-in motor overload pro-
tector. It limits the motor winding temperature to a safe
value. In its simplest form, the switch or motor protec-
tor consists essentially of a bimetal switch mechanism
that is permanently mounted and connected in series
with the motor circuit (Fig. 7-40).
When the motor becomes overloaded or stalled,
excessive heat is generated in the motor winding due to

and air conditioning compressors: the current-type
relay and the potential-type relay.
Potential-Type Relay
The potential-type relay is gen-
erally used with large commercial air-conditioning com-
pressors. The motors may be capacitor start-capacitor
run types up to 5 hp. Relay contacts are normally closed.
The relay coil is wired across the start winding. It senses
voltage change. Start winding voltage increases with
motor speed. As the voltage increases to the specific
pickup value, the armature pulls up, opening the relay
contacts and de-energizing the start winding. After
switching, there is still sufficient voltage induced in the
start winding to keep the relay coil energized and the
relay starting contacts open. When power is turned off,
the voltage drops to zero. That means that the coil is
de-energized and the start contacts reset (Fig. 7-41).
Many of these relays are extremely position sensi-
tive. When changing a compressor relay, care should be
taken to install the replacement in the same position as
the original. Never select a replacement relay solely by
horsepower or other generalized rating. Select the cor-
rect relay from the parts guidebook furnished by the
manufacturer.
Current-Type Relay
The current-type relay is gen-
erally used with small refrigeration compressors up to
4 hp. When power is applied to the compressor motor,
the relay solenoid coil attracts the relay armature
upward. This causes the bridging contact and station-
ary contact to engage (Fig. 7-42). This energizes the
motor start winding. When the compressor motor
attains running speed, the motor main winding current
is such that the relay solenoid coil de-energizes. This
allows the relay contacts to drop open, thereby discon-
necting the motor start winding.
the heavy current produced by this condition. The pro-
tector located inside the motor is controlled by the
motor current passing through it and the motor temper-
ature. The bimetal element is calibrated to open the
motor circuit when the temperature, as a result of exces-
sive current, rises above a predetermined value. When
the temperature decreases, the protector automatically
resets and restores the motor circuit.
Motor Winding Relays
Following the thermal overload protector in the circuit
(Fig. 7-40) is the motor start relay. A motor winding
relay is usually incorporated in single-phase motor com-
pressor units. This relay is an electromagnetic device for
making and breaking the electrical circuit to the start
winding. A set of normally closed contacts is placed in
series with the motor start winding (Fig. 7-40).
The electromagnetic coil is in series with the auxil-
iary winding of the motor. When the motor start and
run windings are energized a fraction of a second later,
the motor comes up to speed and sufficient voltage is
induced in the auxiliary winding to cause current to
flow through the relay coil. The magnetic force created
by the current through the coil is sufficient to attract the
spring-loaded armature, which mechanically opens the
relay starting contacts. With the starting contacts open,
the start winding is out of the circuit. The motor con-
tinues to run only on the run winding. When the control
contacts open, power to the motor is interrupted. This
allows the relay armature to close the starting contacts.
The motor is now ready to start a new cycle when the
control contacts again close.
A hermetic compressor motor relay is an automatic
switching device designed to disconnect the motor start
winding after the motor has attained a running speed.
There are two types of motor relays used in refrigeration

ELECTROMECHANICAL RELAYS
The electromechanical relay is available in a number of
different arrangements and have any number of names
to indicate their purpose. The general-purpose relay
can perform a number of operations in a variety of
locations.
The control relay is designed specifically for use as
a machine tool relay (Fig. 7-43). This relay is designed
to handle the logic switching requirements of machine
tools, conveyors, hoists, elevators, cranes, tire machines,
and practically every type of motor-driven machinery.
The control relay is electromagnetically operated
and held. Energizing of the magnet coil causes the nor-
mally open contacts to close and the normally closed
contacts to open. De-energizing of the coil causes the
contacts to switch back to their original state.
The latching relay, the control relay, and the timing
relay work together to form a logic system for making
automated plants possible. The control relay is designed
to switch inductive and resistive loads in both ac and dc
circuits. By far the greatest number of applications
involve the switching of inductive loads in ac circuits.
Typical loads are operating coils on such devices as
other relays, timers, starters, contactors, and solenoids.
The latching relay is electromagnetically operated
and is held by means of a mechanical latch. Energizing
the latching coil causes the normally open contacts to
close and the normally closed contacts to open. The
mechanical latch holds all contacts switched, even
after power is removed from the latching coil. Energiz-
ing of a second coil, the unlatching coil, results in all
contacts switching back to their original state. Both
coils are continuously rated and require no coil clear-
ing contacts. If the latching and unlatching coils are
energized at the same time, the latching coil will over-
ride the contacts and the contacts will go to, and remain
in, their switched state. Figure 7-44 shows the conven-
tional two-coil circuit.
The latch attachment has its own coil and is
mounted on the control relay (Fig. 7-45). The mecha-
nism fits on any two- to eight-pole relay and can be
mounted on the relay in the field even after the relay
contacts and coil are wired. The latching attachment
has a self-adjusting feature that adapts the stroke of the
latch to the stroke of the relay on which it is mounted
to provide optimum performance.
The solid-state timer is recommended for use in
control system work, with the latching relay. The solid-
state timer is useful in extremely high duty cycles. This
type of relay is discussed in chapter 9.

ratings. NEMA standards do not recommend using a
relay at its maximum ampere rating where the number of
operations are expected to exceed substantially the 6000
operations required by the NEMA endurance test.
Contact Construction
The relay uses a double-break contact (Fig. 7-46). This
places, for practical purposes, two single breaks in
series, so that two arcs occur when the contact inter-
rupts the current flow. This division of energy in the arc
materially extends the electrical life of the contact
when compared to devices using single-break contacts.
The stationary movable contacts are made of silver
cadmium oxide material. This choice of material is
important because of its resistance to welding when
closing on the inrush currents normally associated with
inductive loads. It also helps to reduce the contact ero-
sion associated with repeated interruption of inductive
circuits. Note how the contacts are constructed in
Fig. 7-47. They provide two parallel paths per pole.
The fact that both halves of the movable finger are not
rigidly connected assures that all four contact points
are held closed with nearly equal force. A conductive
crossover saddle (Fig. 7-48) straddles the two fingers
to provide a crossover path for even greater reliability.
RELAY OPERATING
CHARACTERISTICS
Ratings of relays are important. The make rating, the
break rating, and the continuous rating have to be taken
into consideration when the relay is specified.
Resistive Ratings
This indicates the resistive load that
the contacts can make, break, or carry continuously.
Resistive ratings are based on 75% power factor.
Inductive Ratings
The inductive rating refers to
loads, such as coils of contactors, starters, relays, and
solenoids, that the contacts can make, break, and carry
continuously. Inductive rating tests are run with 35%
power factor loads.
Make Ratings
This rating applied to the current that
can be handled by the contact at the time of contact clo-
sure. In inductive ac circuits, the momentary inrush
current is often 10 times the sealed current, and a relay
must be able to handle this inrush current as well as be
able to break it in an emergency.
Break Ratings
This rating applies to the current that
can be interrupted successfully by the contact. The
inductive break rating is always less than the resistive or
continuous ratings. When contacts break an inductive
circuit, the inductance in the load tends to maintain the
current. The result is an arc across the contact that causes
heating and erosion of the contacts. Because of the extra
heat generated, the allowable inductive current must be
less than the resistive current for equal contact life.
Continuous Ratings
Continuous rating indicates the
load that the contacts can carry continuously without
making or breaking the circuit and without exceeding a
certain temperature rise.
Contact Life
The life of the control relay contact depends on the
magnitude and characteristics of the electrical load,
inductance, duty cycle, mechanical properties of the
device in which they are used, voltage fluctuations, and
environment.
When control circuit relays are operated at maxi-
mum rated load, the life of the contacts is usually less
than that of the remainder of the device. If the applica-
tion requires a large number of operations during the
life of the contacts, the contacts must be applied at val-
ues less than their maximum make and break ratings.
NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Associa-
tion) standards recommend that control relays for auto-
matically operated sequencing systems be utilized with
loads of less than 25% of the 60-A make and 6-A break

An ohmmeter test on a contact is unreliable because
the most common voltage source for an ohmmeter is a
1.5-V dry cell, and to contacts being tested, this is a
low-energy circuit load. Several ohmmeter readings of
the same contacts may work perfectly well with a relay
coil load.
Relay Coils
Coils for relays are designed to operate satisfactorily
on voltages varying as much as 15% below and 10%
above the nominal values. The nominal value is the
value stamped on the coil.
Most coils are stamped with a part number, operat-
ing voltage, frequency, and date code. In most relays
the external part of the coil is pressure-molded epoxy
(Fig. 7-49). This forms a dense protective cover that
provides high strength and resistance to mechanical
damage. Construction of this type also provides good
heat transfer for better cooling. Moisture absorption is
also reduced. Coils for control relays and latch relays
are designed so that they may be operated continuously
without overheating.
with proper operation of nearby solid-state equipment.
An optional transient suppressor is available to sup-
press transients to approximately 200% of peak voltage
(Fig. 7-7).
Shock and Vibration
Shock and vibration show up in the form of contact
bounce, false switching of contacts due to armature
travel, or mechanical breakage. Most relays are
designed with vibration and shock in mind, inasmuch
as this is part of the operating environment of the relay.
They are given consideration and compensated for by
high contact pressure along with low-mass movable
contacts.
Relays and Altitude
Higher altitudes produce an atmosphere with less pres-
sure. The low pressure in itself does not affect the relay
directly. However, the higher altitudes tend to reduce
the insulation value of the air as well as its cooling
effect. As a result it is necessary to consider the possi-
ble need to derate electrical equipment when it is used
at high altitude. The relay should be derated when used
at altitudes above 6000 ft but not more than 15,000 ft.
This calls for derating the relay to 75% of its normal
rating.

Transients
The coil is relatively unaffected by
switching transients. That is, because the pickup time
of the relay is about 9 milliseconds, a short transient
voltage is very unlikely to cause false switching of the
output contacts. High-quality coil insulation plus low
voltage differential between turns makes failure due to
shorted turns, resulting from transients, also quite
unlikely. However, when a relay coil is de-energized, a
transient is generated by the relay coil that may interfere

Operating Principles
The operation of a dc motor is based on the principle
that a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic
field, perpendicular to the lines of flux, tends to move
in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic lines of
flux (Fig. 8-1). The relationship between the direction
of the magnetic field, the direction of current in the
conductor, and the direction in which the conductor
tends to move is called the right-hand rule for motors

14. Describe the classification of insulation systems
used for motors.
MOTOR CLASSIFICATIONS
There are three types of motors when classified into
large groups. 
• The dc motor runs on direct current only
• The ac motor runs on alternating current only 
• The universal motor runs on ac or dc
Before you learn to control motors, it is best to
know what makes them run and why they are chosen to
do a particular job. The job they are designed to do and
their ability to do the job are important factors in
putting a motor to work at its greatest efficiency.
DC MOTORS
DC motor is a mechanical workhorse. Many large
pieces of equipment depend on a dc motor for power to
move. The speed and direction of rotation of a dc motor
are easily controlled. Just reverse the polarity and you
reverse the direction of rotation. Change the voltage
and the speed changes. This makes it especially useful
for operating equipment such as winches, cranes, mis-
sile launchers, and elevators.

armature loop, caused by the switching action of the
commutator segments, change the polarity of the mag-
netic field around the conductor. The magnetic fields
repel and attract each other and the armature continues
to turn. The momentum of the rotating armature carries
the armature past the position where the unlike poles
are exactly lined up. However, if these fields are
exactly lined up when the armature current is turned
on, there is no momentum to start the armature mov-
ing. In this case the motor will not rotate or start. It
would be necessary to give the motor a spin to start it.
This disadvantage is eliminated when there are
more turns on the armature, because then there is more
than one armature field. No two armature fields can
be exactly aligned with the field from the field poles at
the same time.
Counter Electromotive Force
While a dc motor is running, it acts somewhat like a dc
generator. For instance, there is a magnetic field from
the field poles. This means that a loop of wire is turn-
ing and cutting this magnetic field. For the moment,
disregard the fact that there is current flowing through
the loop of wire from the battery. As the loop sides cut
the magnetic field, a voltage is induced in them just as
it is in the loop sides of a dc generator. This induced
voltage causes current to flow in the loop. The current
induced is in the opposite direction from that which
caused it (the battery). Inasmuch as this current flows
in the opposite direction from that which caused it, it is
called a counter electromotive force (CEMF).
In a dc motor, a counter EMF is always developed.
The counter EMF cannot be equal to or greater than the
applied battery voltage because then the motor would
not run. The counter EMF is always a little less. Counter
EMF opposes the applied voltage enough so that it is
able to keep the armature current from the battery to a
low value. If there were no such thing as counter EMF,
much more current would flow through the armature.
This is because it would have only its low dc resistance
to determine the current draw. This means that the motor
would run much faster. There is no way to avoid counter
EMF. It makes a dc motor more economical to operate.
Loads
DC motors are used to turn many mechanical devices:
such things as water pumps, grinding wheels, fan
blades, and circular saws. Keep in mind that the pump
or fan blade is the load. It is the mechanical device that
the motor must move. This is the motor load. This load
can cause the motor to draw more current as the
The right-hand rule can be used to find the direc-
tion of rotation of a motor. If the motion of a conductor
is unknown, it can be found by extending the thumb,
index finger, and middle finger of your right hand so
that they are at right angles to each other. If the forefin-
ger is pointed in the direction of magnetic flux (north to
south) (check the polarity of the power source to deter-
mine this), and the middle finger is pointed in the direc-
tion of current flow in the conductor, the thumb will
point in the direction the conductor will move.
Keep in mind that a dc motor rotates as a result of
two magnetic fields interacting with one another. The
armature of a dc motor acts through its coils. Since the
armature is located within the magnetic field of the field
poles, these two magnetic fields interact. Like magnetic
poles repel each other, and unlike magnetic poles attract
each other. The dc motor has field poles that are station-
ary and an armature that turns on bearings in the space
between the field poles. The armature of a dc motor has
windings that are connected to commutator segments.
Figure 8-3 shows how the simple dc motor operates.
DC Motors  
137
Fig. 8-3
DC motor armature rotation.
Note how the brushes fitting on the commutator
segments create a magnetic field in the conductor
according to the polarity of the battery voltage. The
changes in direction of current flow through the

amount of mechanical energy demanded is increased.
This, in turn, means that there is more electrical power
consumed since the voltage times the current equals
the power consumed. The load on a motor affects its
speed, current drawn, and its efficiency.
To get the most from a motor or operate it at its
most efficient point, the load and the motor character-
istics and abilities must be matched. This makes for a
better operating condition for the load and the motor.
Types of DC Motors
The three categories for the dc motor are the series,
shunt, and compound. Each type has distinct character-
istics since each has its field coils and armature con-
nected in different arrangements.
Series DC Motors
In a series dc motor, the field is connected in series
with the armature. The field is wound with a few
turns of comparatively large diameter wire because it
must carry full armature current (Fig. 8-4). There are
both advantages and disadvantages in this arrangement.
This type of motor develops a very large amount of
turning force (torque) from standstill. Because of this
characteristic, the series motor can be used to operate
electrical appliances, portable electric tools, cranes,
winches, hoists, and to start an automobile engine.
keeps increasing in speed until it self-destructs. With
large motors such as cranes there is some danger to
both the equipment and the personnel around it. A
load must always be connected to a series motor
before it is turned on. This means that there can be no
belt-driven loads, since the belt may break or slip off.
Small motors, such as those used in electrical hand
drills, have enough internal friction (gearbox) to load
themselves. Larger motors must be treated with more
caution.
The series motor can be operated on ac or dc. This
makes it more flexible in its use. However, it operates
best on dc. The universal motor (operates on ac or dc)
is discussed later.
Shunt DC Motors
A shunt motor is connected with the field windings in
parallel (shunt) with the armature windings (Fig. 8-5).
138
Electric Motors
Fig. 8-4
Series-wound dc motor diagram.
Another characteristic is that the speed varies
widely between no-load and full-load. Series motors
cannot be used where a relatively constant speed is
needed for varying loads. A major disadvantage of
the series motor is related to the speed characteristic.
The speed of a series motor with no load increases to the
point where the motor may become damaged. Usu-
ally, either the bearings are damaged or the windings
fly out of the slots in the armature because the motor
Fig. 8-5
Shunt-wound dc motor diagram. 
Once adjusted, the speed of a dc shunt motor
remains relatively constant even under changing load
conditions. One reason for this is that the field flux
remains constant. A constant voltage across the field
makes the field independent of variations in the arma-
ture circuit.
When the load on the motor is increased, the motor
tends to slow down. This slowdown decreases the
amount of counter EMF generated in the armature.
This decrease in counter EMF decreases the opposi-
tion to the flow of battery current through the armature.
Armature current then increases. The increased arma-
ture current causes the motor to speed up. The condi-
tions that established the original speed are then
reestablished, and the original speed is maintained.
Now, if the motor load decreases, the motor tends
to increase its speed. However, the counter EMF
increases. This means that the armature current
decreases and the decrease in armature current causes

show the current flowing toward you, and the + indi-
cates that the current is flowing away from you, or that
it resembles the tail feathers of an arrow as it goes
away from you. Figure 8-7B is a side view of the
armature and pole pieces. Notice that the length of
each conductor is positioned parallel to the faces of
the pole pieces. Each conductor of the armature can
then cut the maximum flux of the motor field. The
inefficiency of the gramme-ring type of armature is
overcome by this positioning and makes it the drum-
wound type.
the speed to decrease. The decrease in load and the
decrease in speed cause an almost instantaneous
response. This means that the speed has a tendency to
appear to be constant or to have so slight a fluctuation
as to be unnoticed in most cases.
Compound DC Motors
A compound motor has two field windings (Fig. 8-6).
One is a shunt field; it is connected in parallel with the
armature. The other is a series field; it is connected in
series with the armature. The shunt field gives the
motor a constant speed advantage. The series field
gives it the advantage of being able to develop a large
torque when the motor is started under a heavy load.
The compound motor has both shunt and series motor
characteristics.
There are two types of compound motors, the long
shunt and the short shunt. In the long shunt the shunt
field is connected in parallel with the series field and
armature (Fig. 8-6A). In the short shunt the shunt field
is across the armature and the series field is in series
with this parallel (shunt) arrangement (Fig. 8-6B).

(B) side view.
Direction of Rotation
The direction of rotation of a dc motor depends on the
direction of the magnetic field and the direction of
current flow in the armature. If either the direction of
the field or the direction of current flow through the
armature is reversed, the rotation of the motor will
reverse. However, if both of these factors are reversed
at the same time, the motor will continue rotating in
the same direction. In actual practice, the field excita-
tion voltage is reversed to reverse the motor direction.
This means that if you want a motor that can be con-
nected to a reversing switch, the leads from the field
must be brought out for easy access to the switching
device.
Motor Speed
DC motors are variable-speed motors. The speed of a
dc motor is changed by changing the current in the
field or by changing the current in the armature. A
decrease in field current causes a decrease in the field
flux. That means that the counter EMF decreases. This
decrease in CEMF permits more armature current.
That means that the motor speeds up. When the field
current is increased, the field flux increases. More
counter EMF is developed. The increase in CEMF
decreases the armature current. The armature current
Types of Armatures
Two types of armatures are used for dc motors. The
gramme-ring armature is inefficient and is not neces-
sarily used for any purpose except to get a better under-
standing of the drum-wound armature. The drum-
wound armature is used on ac motors.
Figure 8-7A shows an end view of the drum-
wound armature as it appears cut through the middle.
Current flow through the coils is indicated by a dot to

then decreases and the motor slows down. Decreasing
the applied voltage to the armature causes the armature
current to decrease and the motor slows down. Increas-
ing the armature voltage and current causes the motor
to speed up.
Shunt motor speed can be controlled by a rheostat
connected in series with the field windings (Fig. 8-8).
Increasing the resistance of the rheostat causes the
current through the field winding to decrease. This
decreases the flux momentarily, which, in turn, decreases
the counter EMF. The motor then speeds up. This
momentary increase in speed increases the counter
EMF and keeps the armature current the same. A
decrease in rheostat resistance increases the current
flow through the field windings and causes the motor
to slow down.
Armature Reaction
Since the armature revolves in a magnetic field it is
subject to the same laws of nature that control the gen-
erator. This means that it cuts the flux field produced
by the field coil. Of course, it also has its own magnetic
field, produced by current flowing through its wind-
ings. There is a generator reaction produced by the
armature revolving in the magnetic field, as well as its
own magnetic field, used to give the motor effect. This
armature effect has to be compensated for in the design
of the motor. There are several ways to do this, one of
which is to shift the brushes after the motor has started
(Fig. 8-9). Note how the armature field has distorted
the flux field between the pole pieces. The effect has
shifted to the neutral plane to the left. This is in oppo-
sition to the direction of rotation. As the brushes are
shifted it causes the neutral plane to shift. The proper
location is indicated when there is no sparking from the
brushes. Another way is to place compensating wind-
ings and interpoles in the motor permanently.
140

Armature reaction.
Compensating Windings 
and Interpoles
Compensating windings and interpoles cancel arma-
ture reaction in a motor. Shifting brushes reduces
sparking and makes the field less effective. Canceling
armature reaction eliminates the need to shift brushes.
Compensating windings and interpoles can be
found in both motors and generators. Compensating
windings are somewhat expensive. This means that
most large dc motors depend on interpoles to correct
armature reaction. Compensating windings are the
same in motors as in generators. Interpoles, however,
are slightly different. The difference is that a generator
interpole has the same polarity as the main pole ahead
of it in the direction of rotation. In a motor the inter-
poles have the same polarity as that of the main pole
following it (Fig. 8-10).
In a series motor, the rheostat speed control may be
connected either in parallel or in series with the arma-
ture windings. Moving the rheostat in a direction that
allows the voltage across the armature to be lowered,
allows the current through the armature to be decreased
and slows the motor. Moving the rheostat in a direction
that increases the voltage and current through the arma-
ture increases the motor speed. One disadvantage of
putting a resistor in series with a series motor is that it
destroys the torque advantage the motor characteristi-
cally possesses. A good example of this is the foot con-
trol on a sewing machine. It is a series motor that powers
the sewing machine. Inserting the series resistor in the
foot-speed control decreases the motor’s starting torque,
and to start the sewing machine the motor must be given
an assist by spinning the wheel. Changing speed con-
trols from rheostats to SCRs gives the advantage of speed
control without the loss of starting torque. This type of
control is discussed in chapter 7.

does not exist until the armature begins to turn. This
means that it is necessary to use an external starting
resistance in series with the armature of a dc motor to
keep the initial armature current to a safe level. As the
armature begins to turn, counter EMF increases and the
applied voltage is opposed by this increase in counter
EMF. This means that the armature current is then
reduced by its own generator effect. Then, once the
motor comes up to normal speed, the external resistance
in series with the armature is decreased or eliminated
and full voltage can be applied across the armature.
Starting resistance can be controlled either manu-
ally, by an operator, or by any of several automatic
devices. The automatic devices are usually just switches
controlled by motor speed sensors. Automatic starters
are covered in later chapters.
DC Motor Characteristics 
and Applications
A quick reference for checking out the characteris-
tics and applications of dc motors is provided in
Table 8-1.
Troubleshooting DC Motors
Methods used for solving problems with dc motors and
a troubleshooting dc motors table are described in
Chap. 23.
Interpoles are connected to carry the armature cur-
rent. As the load varies, the interpole flux varies, and
commutation is corrected automatically as the load
changes. This means that it is not necessary to shift the
brushes when the load increases or decreases. Brushes
are located on the no-load neutral plane and they
remain in that position for all conditions of load.
The dc motor is reversed by reversing the direction
of current in the armature. This means that the current
through the interpole is also reversed. The interpole,
then, still has the proper polarity to provide automatic
commutation.

The resistance of most dc motor armatures is low,
somewhere between 0.05 and 0.5 . Counter EMF

AC MOTORS
The ac motor is less expensive than the dc motor of com-
parable size. The ac motor also requires less maintenance
since it has, in most cases, no brushes or commutator to
be maintained. Since most commercial power is gener-
ated as ac, it is only natural that this type of motor be used
for doing the work that needs to be done.
An ac motor is well suited for constant-speed jobs.
This is mainly because its speed is determined by the
frequency of the power source. However, for some
applications, the dc motor is better suited than the ac
motor. The dc is more easily varied in its speed. But in
some instances the speed of the ac motor can also be
controlled within very narrow limits. Inverter-type dri-
ves make it easier to vary ac motor speed. It is these
limits of control that we discuss here.
Types of AC Motors
In this chapter we discuss three types of ac motors: series,
synchronous, and induction. Synchronous motors may
be considered as polyphase motors. They have a constant
speed and their rotors are energized with dc voltage.
Induction motors are commonly used as single-phase or
polyphase. Their rotors are energized by induction. The
series ac motor is a familiar type of motor. It is very sim-
ilar to a dc motor that has already been discussed.
Series AC Motor
The series ac motor is the same electrically as a dc
series motor (Fig. 8-11). Use the left-hand rule for the
polarity of coils and you can see that the instantaneous
magnetic polarities of the armature and field oppose
each other. This means that motor action results. By
reversing the current, you reverse the polarity of the
input. Note that the field magnetic polarity still opposes
the armature magnetic polarity. This is because the
reversal affects both the armature and the field. The ac
input causes these reversals to take place continuously
and the motor continues to rotate in the same direction.
Construction of the ac series motor does vary
slightly from the dc series motor. Since ac is being used
it calls for special metals in the pole pieces—such as sil-
icon steel, which easily reverses its magnetic polarity
without causing residual magnetism to remain after the
reversal. It also means that laminations are used in the
ac motor to decrease the amount of eddy currents gen-
erated in the pole pieces. DC can be used to power ac
series motors efficiently, but putting ac to a series motor
made for dc does not produce the same efficiencies.
Characteristically, the ac and dc series motors are
similar. They both have a varying speed characteristic.
Low speeds are possible for large loads and light loads
produce high speeds. Speed varies directly with the
size of the load. The larger the load, the slower the
speed.
AC-DC types of series motors, called universal
motors, are especially designed for use on both power
sources. They are usually made in small horsepower
sizes, usually less than 1 hp, and are used most fre-
quently in vacuum cleaners. Universal motors cannot
be operated on polyphase ac power.
Magnetic Fields in AC Motors
Rotating magnetic fields are the key to the operation of
ac motors. This is because the alternating current
causes a continuously changing magnetic field as it
rotates around a series of stator pole pairs.
The magnetic field in a stator can be made to rotate
electrically. This means that it can move around and
around. Then another magnetic field in the rotor can be
made to chase it. This is done by having the rotor field
attracted and repelled by the stator field. By allowing
the rotor to turn freely, it is allowed to chase the rotat-
ing field in the stator. Rotating magnetic fields are set
up in two-phase or three-phase machines. To establish
a rotating magnetic field in a motor stator, the number
of pole pairs must be the same as (or a multiple of) the
number of phases in the applied voltage. The poles
must be displaced from each other by an angle equal to
the phase angle between the individual phase of the
applied voltage.

Rotating Magnetic Field: 
Two-Phase 
A two-phase stator shows the rotating magnetic field
most easily. The stator of a two-phase induction motor
is made up of two windings (or a multiple of two)
placed at right angles to each other around the stator
(Fig. 8-12). Note that the voltages applied to phases 1-
1A and 2-2A are 90° out of phase; that is, the currents
that flow in the phases are displaced from each other by
90°. The magnetic fields generated in the coils are in
phase with their respective current. The magnetic fields
are also 90° out of phase with each other. The coil axes
of these two out of phase magnetic fields are at right
angles to each other. They also add together at every
instant during their cycle.

from one point to the next, the polarities are rotating
from one pole to the next in a clockwise manner. One
complete cycle of input voltage produces a 360° rota-
tion of the pole polarities.
Two-Phase Waveforms 
The waveforms in Fig. 8-13 are applied to the windings
as shown in Fig. 8-12. Note that they are displaced by
90o. That means that when one is at its maximum, the
other is at its minimum. Now take a closer look at
Fig. 8-13 and position 1, indicated by the circled 1. The
current flow and the magnetic field in winding 1-lA are
at maximum (because the phase voltage is maximum).
The current flow and magnetic field in winding 2-2A
are zero (because the phase voltage is zero). The resul-
tant magnetic field is therefore in the direction of the
1-lA axis. At the 45° point (position 2), the resultant
magnetic field is midway between windings and 1-1A
and 2-2A. The coil currents and magnetic fields are
equal in strength. At 90°, position 3, the magnetic field
in winding 1-lA is zero. The magnetic field in winding
2-2A is at maximum. Now the resultant magnetic field
is along the axis of the 2-2A winding. The resultant
magnetic field has rotated clockwise through 90° to get
from position 1 to position 3.
Once the two-phase voltages have completed one
full cycle and arrived at position 9, the resultant mag-
netic field has rotated through 360o. This means that by
placing two windings at right angles to each other and
exciting them with voltages 90° out of phase, a rotating
magnetic field can be produced. Note that the arrow
representing the rotor is now pointing to where it
started in position 1, indicating a complete revolution
of the rotor.
They produce a resultant field that rotates one rev-
olution for each cycle (hertz) of ac. Analyzing how the
two-phase stator’s rotating field works is one way of
understanding how all ac motors work. Figure 8-13
shows the two-phase rotating field. By taking a look at
the nine different locations on this figure, you will be
able to see how the field moves step by step with each
of the two phases.
The arrow indicates the rotor. Keeping track of the
arrow shows how the rotation of the rotor is accom-
plished. This chart shows the voltage of each phase.
The current flows in a direction that causes the mag-
netic polarity indicated at each pole piece. Note that

Two-phase current is rarely used in this country.
However, it is used here to show how similar operation
is used to start a single-phase motor with its start wind-
ing placed in the circuit to get the rotor turning. Single-
phase and three-phase motors use the same principle of
rotating magnetic fields to cause their rotors to rotate.
Rotating Magnetic Field: 
Three-Phase
A three-phase induction motor also operates on the
principle of a rotating magnetic field. Figure 8-14
shows how a three-phase operation is connected. This
one is Y-connected. The three-phase windings can be
connected to a three-phase ac input and have a resultant
magnetic field that rotates (Fig. 8-15).
Now refer to Fig. 8-15. Note that at position 1 the
magnetic field in coils 1-1A is maximum. Check the
polarities. At the same time, negative voltages are pre-
sent in the 2-2A and 3-3A windings. These negative
voltages create weaker magnetic fields that tend to aid
the 1-1A field. At position 2, maximum negative volt-
age is present in the 3-3A windings. This creates a
strong magnetic field that is aided by the weaker fields
in 1-lA and 2-2A. Now move along each point on the
voltage graph. Notice that the resultant magnetic field
is rotating in a clockwise direction. This means that
when the three-phase voltage completes one full cycle
and reaches position 7, the magnetic field has rotated
through 360o.
If you place a permanent bar magnet in this rotat-
ing magnetic field with a shaft through it and allow the
magnet to rotate freely in step with the rotating mag-
netic field, you will be able to see how the shaft rotates
at the same rate as the moving magnetic field. Keep in
mind that this simplified explanation of rotating fields
is given here to show you how a rotating magnetic field
can be utilized to cause a shaft to turn and produce
usable mechanical energy from electrical energy.
Motors have been designed to use a number of princi-
ples and can be utilized to do many jobs efficiently.
Synchronous Motors
The main advantage of synchronous motors is a con-
stant-speed characteristic. They are capable of correct-
ing the low power factor of an inductive load when

where connections are made to ensure a wye configu-

that 3 times 120 equals 360. Now take a closer look
at Fig. 8-15. It shows how instantaneous polarities are
generated. Current flows toward the terminal number

terminal number for negative voltages.

starting torque. It has torque only when running at syn-
chronous speed. A synchronous motor used to correct
the power factor has to operate at less than its nominal
mechanical load. 
Squirrel-Cage Motor
The three-phase current with which the motor is sup-
plied establishes a rotating magnetic field in the stator.
This rotating magnetic field cuts the conductors in the
rotor, inducing voltages and causing currents to flow.
These currents set up an opposite-polarity field in the
rotor. The attraction between these opposite stator and
rotor fields produces the torque that causes the rotor
to rotate. This is, in essence, how a squirrel-cage motor
works.
A squirrel-cage winding can be added to the rotor
of a synchronous motor to cause it to start. The squirrel
cage is shown as part of the rotor in Fig. 8-17. The
name comes from the shape-it looks something like a
turnable squirrel cage. The windings are heavy copper
bars shorted together by copper rings. A low voltage is
induced in these shorted windings by the three-phase
stator field. Because of the short circuit, a relatively
large current flows in the squirrel cage. This causes a
magnetic field that interacts with the rotating field of
the stator. Because of the interaction the rotor begins to
turn, following the stator field and the motor starts. The
squirrel cage is also used in single-phase and other
three-phase motors.
operated under certain conditions. They are often used
to drive dc generators. Synchronous motors are avail-
able in sizes up to thousands of horsepower. They may
be designed as either single-phase or three-phase
machines (Fig. 8-16).
Synchronous motors are often used without a load.
They can be used for power factor correction. Adding
the synchronous motor to the circuit can be useful in
power factor correction. This means that the machine
will do the same amount of work as before power cor-
rection; however, it will draw less current from the
power lines. This is accomplished by the amount of
excitation applied to the wound rotor in the form of
low-voltage dc. Fixed condensers (capacitors) are often
used in place of synchronous motors for power factor
correction.
This type of motor is used whenever exact speed
must be maintained or for power factor correction.
Synchronous motors are more expensive than other
types at the lower horsepower ratings, but may possi-
bly be more economical for 100 hp and higher ratings
(Fig. 8-16).
If three-phase ac is applied to a synchronous
motor, a rotating magnetic field is set up around the
rotor. The rotor is then energized with dc. That is it acts
as a bar magnet since the dc produces a fixed north-
south polarity for the rotor. The strong rotating mag-
netic field attracts the strong rotor field activated by the
dc. This results in a strong turning force on the rotor
shaft. The rotor is therefore able to turn a load as it
rotates in step with the rotating magnetic field.
Getting the motor started is accomplished by adding
a squirrel-cage winding to the rotor. It cannot start from
standstill without the aid of a squirrel-cage rotor. That
is because when ac is applied to the stator, a high-speed
rotating magnetic effect appears immediately. This
rotating field rushes past the rotor poles so quickly that
the rotor does not have a chance to get started. In effect,
the rotor is repelled first in one direction and then the
other. In its purest form, a synchronous motor has no

Self-starting synchronous ac motor.
Starting the Synchronous Motor 
To start a practical synchronous motor, the stator is
energized. However, the dc supply to the rotor field is
not energized. The squirrel-cage windings are allowed

to bring the rotor close to synchronous speed. At that
point the dc field is energized. This locks the rotor in
step with the rotating stator field.
Full torque is developed in the synchronous motor
when it comes up to speed. Once it comes up to syn-
chronous speed the load can be applied. A switch oper-
ated by centrifugal force is used to apply dc to the rotor
as it reaches synchronous speed. The need for a dc
power source for the rotor makes it an expensive type
of machine to operate and maintain. The dc source may
be part of the motor or it may come from an external
generator.
As you can see from this discussion, synchronous
motors have advantages and disadvantages, as do other
types of motors. If expense is not a factor, the selection
of one over another depends on the job and the power
available. Table 8-2 summarizes the synchronous
motor characteristics and applications.
Induction Motors
The induction motor is the most commonly used ac
motor (Fig. 8-18). It is simple in design and rugged in
construction. It costs relatively little to manufacture.
The induction motor rotor is not connected to an exter-
nal source of voltage. The induction motor derives its
name from the fact that ac voltages are induced in the
rotor circuit by the rotating magnetic field in the stator.
Induction in this motor is similar to the induction
between the primary and secondary of a transformer.
The rotor can be thought of as a short-circuited sec-
ondary of a transformer that is mounted on a shaft and
supported by bearings that allow it to rotate freely as
the rotating field in the stator moves from stator pole to
stator pole (Fig. 8-19).
Induction motors are often large and permanently
mounted. They drive loads at fairly constant speed.
They are used in washing machines, refrigerator com-
pressors, bench grinders, and table saws.
Stator Construction
The stator construction of the three-phase induction
motor and the three-phase synchronous motor are
almost identical. However, their rotors are completely
different (Fig. 8-20). An induction motor is made of
a laminated cylinder with slots in its surface. The

motion to exist between the two, the rotor must rotate
at a slower speed than that of the rotating magnetic
field. The difference between the speed of the rotating
stator field and the rotor speed is called slip. The
smaller the slip, the closer the rotor speed approaches
the stator field speed.
Rotor speed depends on the torque requirements of
the load: The greater the load, the stronger the turning
force needed to rotate the rotor. Turning force increases
only if the rotor-induced EMF increases. This EMF can
increase only if the magnetic field cuts through the
rotor at a faster rate. To increase the relative speed
between the field and rotor, the rotor must slow down.
This means that for heavier loads the induction motor
turns more slowly than for lighter loads.
Slip is directly proportional to the load on the
motor. A slight change in speed is necessary to produce
windings in these slots are one of two types. The most
common is the squirrel-cage winding. This entire
winding is made up of heavy copper bars connected
together at the end by a metal ring made of copper or
brass. No insulation is required between the core and
the bars. This is because of the very low voltages
generated in the rotor bars. The other type of windings
contains actual coils placed in the rotor slots. This type
of rotor is then called a wound rotor (Table 8-3).
Slip
The rotor of an induction motor cannot turn at the same
speed as the rotating magnetic field. If the speeds were
the same, there would be no relative motion between
the stator and rotor fields. Without relative motion there
would be no induced voltage in the rotor. For relative

the usual current changes required for normal changes
in load. This is because the rotor windings have such a
low resistance. Induction motors are referred to as con-
stant-speed motors.
Single-Phase Induction Motors 
The single-phase induction motor is the most com-
monly used of all types of electric motors. It has the
lowest initial cost and needs little maintenance. There
are a number of descriptive titles for each type of
single-phase motor: such names as split-capacitor,
capacitor-start, split-phase, shaded-pole, capacitor start-
capacitor run and permanent-split capacitor. Of course,
other groupings include the capacitor start and resis-
tance start as part of the overall title “split-phase.”
The stator field in the single-phase motor does not
rotate. It simply alternates polarity between poles as
the ac voltage changes polarity (Fig. 8-21). Magnetic
induction causes a voltage to be induced in the rotor,
thereby producing a magnetic field in the rotor. This
field is in opposition to the stator field because, as
Lenz’s law states: The induced voltage is in the oppo-
site direction from that which produced it. Thus the
interaction between rotor and stator fields will not pro-
duce rotation. Instead of rotation it produces a north
pole directly opposite a south pole. Therefore, the rotor
stands still until pushed or nudged into motion. This is
shown in Fig. 8-21A.
Once the movement is started (Fig. 8-21B) the
south pole on the rotor is attracted by the left-hand
pole. That is, the north rotor pole is attracted to the
right-hand pole. This is a result of the rotor being
rotated 90° by an outside force. Once the pull exists
between the two fields, it becomes a rotary force, turn-
ing the rotor toward the magnetic field of the stator.
The two fields alternate continuously. They never actu-
ally line up, so the rotor will continue to rotate once
started. The next problem is to design a starting method
to get this single-phase motor to start without an out-
side force turning it each time it is started.
The basic operation of the single-phase motor is
the same for all types, but the starting methods utilized
create a specialized label for each. To become familiar
with two of the slightly different methods used to get
the single-phase motor started, we will look at the
capacitor-start and the resistance-start in addition to the
shaded-pole types.
Split-Phase Induction Types 
Split-phase motors are designed to use inductance,
capacitance, or resistance to develop a starting torque.
The capacitor-start type uses, of course, capacitance.
Figure 8-22 shows how an auxiliary winding is added
with a capacitor in series with it. This winding is
placed in parallel with the main (run) winding and is
located at right angles (90°) to it. This produces a phase
difference of 90 electrical degrees between the two
windings. The start or auxiliary winding is connected
with a switch that is operated centrifugally. When the
motor comes up to about 75% of its rated speed, open-
ing the switch disconnects the start winding.

moving if there is little or no load on the motor. The
centrifugal switch opens the circuit once the rotor is up
to about 75% of its normal design speed.
Shaded-Pole Induction Motors 
Shaded-pole motors are also of the induction type.
They use a different type of starting arrangement. The
effect of a moving magnetic field is produced by con-
structing the stator in a special way. These motors have
projecting pole pieces similar to some dc motors. Por-
tions of the pole-piece surfaces are surrounded by a
copper strap called a shading coil.
Figure 8-24 shows a pole piece with the strap in
place. The strap causes the field to move back and forth
across the face of the pole piece. Note the numbered
sequence and points on the magnetization curve in the
figure. As the alternating stator field starts increasing
from zero, step 1, the lines of force expand across the
face of the pole piece and cut through the strap. A volt-
age is induced in the strap. The current that results gen-
erates a field that opposes the cutting action (and
decreases the strength) of the main field. This produces
the following:
A. As the field increases from zero to a maximum at
90°, the field reaches its maximum value.
B. A large portion of the magnetic lines of force are
concentrated in the unshaded portion of the pole .
C. At 90° the field reaches its maximum value and
stops expanding. No EMF is induced in the strap.
No opposition magnetic field is generated, so the
main field is uniformly distributed across the poles
as shown in .
When the power is first applied, the starting switch
is closed. This places the capacitor in series with the
auxiliary winding. The capacitor is of such value that
the auxiliary circuit is effectively a resistive-capacitive
circuit. In this circuit the current leads the line volt-
age by 45°. That is because XC equals the resistance
in the circuit. The main (run) winding has enough
resistance and inductance to cause the current to lag
the line voltage by about 45o because XL about equals
the resistance. The currents in each winding are there-
fore 90° out of phase. The magnetic fields are thus dis-
placed by the same amount. The effect is that the two
windings act as a two-phase stator and produce the
rotating field required to start the motor.
Once the motor is started, the centrifugal switch
opens and takes the start winding out of the circuit; the
rotor continues to rotate until power is removed from
the main winding. Split-phase motors are available in
small sizes, usually less than 1 hp, because they do not
have sufficient starting torque to handle large loads.
Another type of split-phase induction motor is the
resistance-start (Fig. 8-23). Note that there is a resistor
in series with the start winding. The auxiliary circuit,
consisting of the winding and the resistor, is switched
in the circuit and cut out by a centrifugal switch. The
electrical phase shift between the currents in the auxil-
iary and main windings is obtained by making the
impedance of the windings unequal. Note how the
main winding has a high inductance (little resistance
due to windings) and the auxiliary winding has a low
inductance plus a high-value series resistance. The start
winding then has a lagging phase angle due to the
inductance.
AC Motors  
149
Fig. 8-23
Resistance-start ac induction motor.
The start winding has a smaller phase angle, so that
the current does not lag as much as in the main wind-
ing. There is about a 30° difference between the two
windings in their phase angles. This is enough of a
difference to develop enough torque to get the rotor
Fig. 8-24
Starting a shaded-pole induction motor.

D. From 90° to 180°, the main field starts decreasing
or collapsing inward. The field generated in the
strap opposes the collapsing field. The effect is to
concentrate the lines of force in the shaded portion
of the pole face as shown in .
E. From 180° to 360° the main field goes through
the same change as it did from 0° (180°). How-
ever, note that it is in the opposite direction as
shown in .
The direction of the field does not affect the way
the shaded pole works. The motion of the field is the
same during the second half-cycle as it was during the
first half of the cycle.The motion of the field back and
forth between shaded and unshaded portions produces
a weak torque to start the motor. Because of the weak
starting torque, shaded-pole motors are built in very
small sizes. They drive such things as fans, clocks,
blowers, and electric razors. Timer motors on many
large pieces of equipment use the shaded-pole motor
for the clock mechanism.
Speed and Slip 
in Squirrel-Cage Motors
The speed of a squirrel-cage motor depends on the fre-
quency of the power source and the number of poles
the motor has. The higher the frequency, the faster the
motor; the more poles the motor has, the slower it runs.
The smallest number of poles ever used in a squirrel-
cage motor is two. A two-pole 60-Hz motor runs at
approximately 3600 rpm (Table 8-4). Formula: 
Synchronous Speed 
where f is the frequency of power supply and p is the
number of poles in the motor. Most standard commer-
cial motors (143T through 445T frame sizes) are
wound with a maximum of eight poles.
The actual speed of the motor is somewhat less
than its synchronous speed. This difference between
the synchronous and actual speeds is defined as slip. 
60  2f
p
If the squirrel-cage rotor rotated as fast as the stator field,
the rotor conductor bars would be standing still with
respect to the rotating field. See Fig. 8-25 for a look at
the rotor construction. This means that no voltage
would be induced into the bars and no current would be
set up to produce torque. Since no torque is produced,
the rotor will slow down until sufficient current is
induced to develop enough torque to keep the rotor at a
constant speed. Therefore, the rotor rotates slower than
the rotating magnetic field of the stator. For example, a
3600-rpm motor usually rotates at 3450 rpm and a
1800-rpm turns at 1725 rpm at rated load.
An increased load on the motor causes the rotor to
slow down; that is, the rotating field cuts the rotor bars
at a higher rate than before. This has the effect of
increasing the current in the bars and hence increasing
the pole strength of the rotor. This increased pole
strength makes it possible for the motor to carry the
larger load. Slip is usually expressed in percent and can
be easily computed using the formula:

Squirrel-cage motors are made with the slip rang-
ing from less than 5% to around 20%. Motors with a
slip of 5% or higher are used for hard-to-start applica-
tions. A motor with a slip of 5% or less is called a nor-
mal slip motor. A normal slip motor is often referred to
as a constant-speed motor because the speed changes
very little with load variations.
Manufacturers usually specify the motor speed on
the nameplate as that which is normal at its rated load.
Actual speed is, of course, lower than the synchronous
speed.
Rotation
The direction of rotation of a polyphase squirrel-cage
motor depends on the motor connection to the power

torque for a NEMA design B motor. The curve shows
the torque to be 210% of the rated load torque.
Breakdown Torque
Occasionally, a sudden overload will be placed on a
motor. To keep the motor from stalling every time an
overload occurs, these motors have what is called
breakdown torque. Breakdown torque is much higher
than the rated-load torque. It takes quite an overload to
stall the motor. The speed-torque curve shows the
breakdown torque for a typical motor to be 270% of the
rated-load torque. Operating a motor overloaded for an
extended period of time causes excessive heat buildup
in the motor and may eventually burn up the motor
windings.
Because of the variety of torque requirements,
NEMA has established different designs to cover
almost every application (Table 8-5). These designs
take into consideration starting current and slip as well
as torque. These designs should not be confused with
various classes of insulation, which are also designated
by letter (Table 8-6).
lines. Rotation can readily be reversed by interchang-
ing any two input leads.
Torque and Horsepower
Torque and horsepower are two very important motor
characteristics that determine the size of the motor for
a particular job. Torque is the turn effort produced by
the motor. Torque is measured in pound feet (lb-ft).
Horsepower is a rate of doing work. One horsepower
equals 33,000 lb being lifted for a distance of 1 ft in 1
minute:
It takes 746 watts of electrical power to produce 1
horsepower.
Locked-Rotor Torque

needed to start a load. The speed-torque curve for a typ-
ical motor is shown in Fig. 8-26. This curve shows the

Locked-Rotor kVA/hp
Another rating specified on motor nameplates and
determined by the motor design is locked-rotor kVA
per horsepower. A letter appears on the nameplate cor-
responding to various kVA/hp ratings (Table 8-5).
These nameplate code ratings give a good indica-
tion of the starting current the motor will draw. A code
letter at the beginning of the alphabet indicates a low
starting current, and a letter at the end of the alphabet
indicates a high starting current for the particular
horsepower rating of the motor. Starting current can be
figured by using the formula:
locked-rotor amperes 
1000  hp  kVA/hp
1.73  volts
The starting current is important to the buyer of a
motor since it indicates the amount of protection
needed in the way of over-current devices. The buyer
must install power lines big enough to carry the
required currents and put in fuses of the proper size.
Starting Squirrel-Cage Motors
Squirrel-cage motors are usually designed for across-
the-line starting. This means connecting it directly to
the power source by means of a suitable contactor. In
large squirrel-cage motors and in some other types of
motors the starting currents are very high. Usually, the
motor is built to stand these high currents. However,
since these currents are almost six times rated load cur-
rent, there may be a large voltage drop in the power sys-
tem. Some method of reducing the starting current has
to be used to limit the voltage drop to a tolerable level.
Reduced-voltage starting is described in another chap-
ter. A summary of the mechanical and electrical formu-
las used with electric motors is given in Table 8-7.

Classification of Insulation Systems
An insulation system is an assembly of insulating materials
in association with the conductors and the supporting
structural parts of a motor or generator. Insulation sys-
tems are divided into classes according to the thermal
endurance of the system for temperature rating purposes.
Four classes of insulation systems are used in motors and
generators; classes A, B, F, and H. These classes have
been established in accordance with IEEE Std I, General
Principles for Temperature Limits in the Rating 
of Electric Equipment.
Insulation Systems are classified as follows:
Class A—A class A insulation system is one which by expe-
rience or accepted test can be shown to have suitable
thermal endurance when operating at the limiting class A
temperature specified in the temperature rise standard for
the machine under consideration.
Class B—A class B insulation system is one which by

able thermal endurance when operating at the limiting
class B temperature specified in the temperature rise
standard for the machine under consideration.
Class F—A class F insulation system is one which by expe-
rience or accepted test can be shown to have suitable

TIME AND TIMERS
Time is important in any industrial or commercial oper-
ation. Proper timing makes it possible to meet produc-
tion schedules and demands. Timing the operation of a
machine is an important function and needs the proper
equipment to do the job. Many types of industrial
timers are available to control operations of machines.
In most instances it is necessary to control the motor
that drives the machine. A close examination of timers
shows that there are several types, viz. general-purpose,
pneumatic, programmable and solid-state.
Of course, there are such individual-purpose timers
as those required for welders and similar pieces of
equipment. Complex operations and production sched-
ules are timed by equipment that has been designed for
doing the job and making sure it is done properly and
accurately. Timers are called upon to time a fraction of
a second up to hours and in some cases a year. Timers
can be broken down into three categories: 
1. Dashpot 
2. Synchronous clock
3. Electronic timers 
Electronic timers are gaining more favor as they
become less expensive and more reliable than the
older mechanical types. Since there are new types
being designed and released each week it is best to
keep updated using the internet.

SYNCHRONOUS CLOCK TIMERS
A synchronous motor is used to turn a clock mechanism
(Fig. 9-2). The synchronous motor is very accurate
since it operates on the frequency of the line voltage and
is not affected by fluctuations in line voltage. This type
of timer has one or more contacts that open or close
depending on the position of the clock hands.
Fig. 9-2
Synchronous motors used to power motor-driven timers.
The hands can be set to where they are to make
contact. This means that it is possible to obtain from
1 minute to up to 12 hours of time delay on the clock.
Some can be made to time in seconds. A good example
of a clock timer is the one used in darkrooms to time
the development of film.
SOLID-STATE TIMERS
The solid-state timer is more accurate and versatile
and is becoming the standard in industry. Although the
price has a tendency to continue to decrease, it has
become the most reliable type of timer. In most

passes before the relay contacts change state. Figure 9-3
shows the schematic symbols for time-delay relays.
A ladder diagram of a control circuit with an on-
delay relay is shown in Fig. 9-4. The start button is
pushed and the control relay (CR) is energized; thus all
CR contacts close. The CR remains energized even
after the pushbutton is released. Relay contacts CR-1
and CR-2 are closed, and a voltage is applied to the coil
of the time-delay relay (TR). Even though voltage is
applied to the timing relay coil, contact TR-1 does not
close immediately. After a predetermined period of
time, TR-1 closes and the indicator lamp turns on.

instances there are no moving parts to cause trouble or
need servicing. The time delay is set by a resistance-
capacitance (RC) network and the switching is usually
done by an SCR. Most units are encapsulated in plastic
of some type, usually an epoxy.
TIME-DELAY RELAYS
The pneumatic-type relay has a synthetic rubber bellows
for controlling the tripping time (Fig. 9-3). The timer is
particularly useful for applications requiring a timer with
greater accuracy and a longer timing range than is afforded
by the fluid dashpot timer. These pneumatic timing relays
have a range of 0.05 to 180 seconds with a repetitive accu-
racy of 10%. A minimum reset time of 75 milliseconds
must be provided to ensure repetitive accuracy. The
times are adjustable for a period longer than 180 seconds
(3 minutes) provided that 100% accuracy is not needed.
Relays can be timed so that the delay takes place
with the contacts closed or open. When power is applied
to the relay coil of an on-delay relay, a period of time

Ladder diagram of control circuit with a delay relay.
This on-delay relay gets its name from the fact that
a period of time passes before the contact is closed. If
the circuit also has an NC contact, the NC contact is
also delayed for a period of time before it opens. When
the circuit is turned off, all contacts immediately
return to their normal de-energized positions.
The off-delay relay symbols are shown in Fig. 9-5.
This relay has NO and NC contacts. Voltage is applied

and NC contacts.

to the coil of the off-delay relay. The contacts change
state immediately as they do in a normal control relay.
NO contacts close and remain closed as long as a volt-
age is applied to the coil. Even after the voltage is
removed from the coil, the contacts remain in their
activated states for a preset period. The contacts return
to their normal states only after the relay times-out.
The off-delay relay shown in Fig. 9-6 is a ladder
diagram of a control circuit. The start button is pushed
and a voltage is applied to the relay’s coil (CR). Then the
START button is released, so CR-1 closes and main-
tains voltage to coil CR. Contact CR-2 also closes and
a voltage is applied to coil TR. Contact TR 1 closes
immediately and the indicator lamp turns on. The stop
button is pushed and voltage is removed from coil CR.
All CR contacts open. Voltage is also removed from
coil TR. However, contact TR-1 remains closed for a
preset period of time and the indicator lamp remains
on. After the relay times-out, contact TR-1 opens and
the light goes out.
are counted from the keyway in a clockwise direction.
However, looking at the bottom of the socket, you
have to count in the opposite (counterclockwise)
direction for making connections to the socket. Some
timers have an 11-pin base. An adjustable knob on top
of the case allows for the time delay to be adjusted
from 0.1 to 10 seconds on some and other time ranges
for others (Table 9-1).

GENERAL PURPOSE TIMING
RELAYS
The general purpose timing relay has many uses. It is
used for automatic control of machine tool program-
ming, sequencing controls, heating and cooling oper-
ations, and warm-up delays. Most of this type are
designed for plug-in housing (Fig. 9-7). The plug-in
base resembles the eight-pin base of the older vac-
uum tubes. In fact, they can fit into some vacuum-
tube sockets. Note how the keyway indicates the
beginning or pin 1 and the location of pin 8. The pins
CONTROL OF PROGRAMMABLE
TIMERS
Programmable timers are microprocessor controlled to
provide flexibility with accurate timing. The on-delay
timer has five programmable timing ranges:
0.5 to 9.99 seconds
0.1 to 99.9 seconds
1.0 to 999 seconds
0.1 to 99.9 minutes
1.0 to 999 minutes

are available with either a digital readout capable of up
or down timing/counting or a LED status indicator.
Time/Count Modes
Relay switches require a great deal of attention, which
results in a lot of downtime for the machines they con-
trol. In industry, the relay has quickly been replaced by
electronics, just as the telephone company uses transis-
tor switching to replace relay switching. There are no
moving parts in transistors and no contact points to be
cleaned periodically. With relays, the entire circuit had
to be rewired to change a program, but with a digital
solid-state timer/counter, only the thumbwheels on
front of the device are changed.
The four modes for the solid-state timer/counter are
on-delay, off-delay, interval, and repeat cycle pulse. 
On-delay mode
Closing the initiating contact begins
the delay period, and the time/count outputs are
energized.
Off-delay mode
Closing the initiating contact ener-
gizes the time/count outputs. Opening the initiating
contact begins the delay period. At the end of the
delay period, the time/count outputs de-energize. 
Interval
Closing the initiating contact energizes
the time/count outputs and begins the delay period.
At the end of the delay period, the time/count out-
puts de-energize.
Repeat cycle pulse
Closing the initiating contact
begins the delay period. At the end of the delay
period, the time/count outputs energize for 50 mil-
liseconds and then de-energize. The device repeats
this cycle until the initiating contact is opened.
Dual-Stage Version
Dual-stage units have eight pushbutton thumbwheels
located on the face of the device (Fig. 9-11). The four
left pushbutton thumbwheels are used to set the
A five-position rotary switch is used to select the tim-
ing ranges. Three pushbutton thumbwheels are used to
select the time value (Fig. 9-8). Timing modes are shown
in Fig. 9-9. These relays draw about 1.2 VA, making the
solid-state relay very low in power consumption.

DIGITAL SOLID-STATE
TIMER/COUNTER
There are some extremely flexible microcomputer-based
digital timer/counters. They can be field programmed to
perform as a timer or counter with a variety of timing or
counting modes and ranges. They are available in either
a single- or dual-stage model and can be ordered with
either relay or solid-state outputs and with ac or dc inputs
to make them compatible with most control systems.
Single-Stage Version
Single-stage units have a selector switch and four
pushbutton thumbwheels located on the front face of
the device (Fig. 9-10). The selector switch is used to
select the time or count range, while the four pushbut-
ton thumbwheels are used to set the time or count
value. Operating mode selection is accomplished by
programming seven internal DIP switches. The units

time/count value for stage 1, while the four right push-
button thumbwheels are used to set the time/count
value for stage 2. A seven-position DIP switch located
inside the device is used to set the time or count range
and mode. The units come with two LED status indica-
tors, one for stage 1 and one for stage 2.
Two-stage (on-delay) mode
Closing the initiating
contact begins the stage-1 delay period. At the end
of stage-1 delay period, the stage-1 time/count out-
puts energize and the stage-2 delay period begins. At
the end of the stage-2 delay period, the stage-2
time/count outputs energize.
Two-stage (on-delay)
Closing the initiating contact
begins the off stage-1 delay period. At the end of the
off stage-1 delay period, the stage-2 time/count out-
puts energize and the on stage-2 delay period begins.
At the end of the on stage-2 delay period, the stage-2
time/count outputs de-energize and the off stage-1
delay period begins. This cycle repeats until the initi-
ating contact is opened. The stage-1 time/count out-
puts act as instantaneous outputs and are energized
when the initiating contact is closed.
Two-stage (off-delay)
Closing the initiating contact
energizes the stage-1 and stage-2 time/count outputs.
When the initiating contact is opened, the stage-1
delay period begins. At the end of the stage-1 delay
period, the stage-1 time/count outputs de-energize
and the stage-2 delay period begins. At the end of the
stage-2 delay period, the stage-2 time/count outputs
de-energize.
Repeat cycle (off-delay)
Closing the initiating
contact energizes the stage-1 and stage-2 time/count
outputs. When the initiating contact is opened, the
stage-1 time/count outputs de-energize and the on
stage-1 delay period begins. At the end of the on
stage-1 delay period, the stage-2 time/delay outputs
de-energize and the off stage-2 delay period begins.
At the end of the off stage-2 delay period, the stage-
2 time/count outputs energize and the on stage-1 delay
period begins. This cycle repeats until the initiating
contact is closed. The stage-1 outputs act as instan-
taneous outputs and are energized when the initiating
contact is closed. These timer/counters operate on
120 V 50/60 Hz (102 to 132 V) and 240 V 50/60 Hz
(204 to 264 V). Figure 9-12 shows the wiring dia-
grams for these timers/counters.

Thumbwheel Switches
Thumbwheel switches are utilized on many electronic
devices to allow for the setting of time or counts. They
can be ganged to make more than one. A nut driver is
used to tighten the nuts on the end of the long screw
that inserts into the body of the switches to hold the
outside cases and any separators together. (Fig. 9-13).
You can see from those shown that push button front
mount switch has a pushbutton for setting each num-
ber, whereas the others have the thumbwheel that can

the switches to be rotated from on-to-off or off-to-on.
They also come in raised rocker, recessed rocker, and
piano DIP switch. A high-pressure spring-and-ball con-
tact system causes them to make and break contact. The
ball makes the complete circuit between the two con-
tacts as shown in the cutaway views.
A high-pressure, spring-and-ball contact system is
also used to make or break contact in single-pole, single-
throw, slide-actuated switches, which are very small and
need a very small screwdriver tip or ball point pen to
close or open them. These are also mounted on printed
circuit boards and are used to program a circuit or chip
to function in such a manner as in the timer/counters dis-
cussed in previous paragraphs.
PNEUMATIC TIMING RELAYS
The pneumatic timing relay has some advantages over
other types. It has the advantage of not being affected
by normal variations in ambient temperature and
atmospheric pressure. It is adjustable over a wide range
of timing periods and has good repeat accuracy. This
type of relay is available with a variety of contact and
timing arrangements (Fig. 9-15).
This pneumatic time-delay unit is mechanically
operated by a magnet structure. The time-delay func-
tion depends on the transfer of air through a restricted
orifice. This restriction is done by the use of a rein-
forced synthetic rubber bellow or diaphragm. The tim-
ing range is adjusted by positioning a needle valve to
vary the amount of orifice or vent restriction.
be rotated until the correct digit comes up. Components
needed to assemble a complete switch are
• One pair of end plates
• Blank bodies to divide switches in a bank
• Divider plates to separate switch banks into framed
sections
• Hardware
DIP SWITCHES
DIP (dual-in-line packaging) is also used with integrated
circuits or chips and their packaging. DIP switches are
small and have contacts that resemble those of an inte-
grated circuit (IC) or chip. They are designed to be
attached to a printed circuit board and soldered in place.
As you can see from Fig. 9-14, these are very small and it
takes a ballpoint pen or something equally small to cause

Energizing or de-energizing pneumatic timing
relays can be controlled by devices such as pushbut-
tons, limit switches, and thermostatic relays. They
draw very small amounts of current, so sensitive con-
trol devices are used to control the operating sequence.
This type of timing relay is used for motor accel-
eration and in automatic control circuits. Automatic
control is needed where uses are repetitive and
accuracy is required.
Two types of time delay are provided by pneumatic
timers: on-delay, which means that the relay provides
time delay when it is energized, and off-delay, which
means that the relay is de-energized when it provides
time delay. Figure 9-16 shows the on-delay arrangement
in an Allen-Bradley relay. When the operating coil (O) is
energized, solenoid action raises the solenoid plunger
(A). The pressure on the rod (B) is released. A spring (W)
is located inside the bellows (E). The spring then allows
the pushrod (B) to move upward. As (B) moves upward,
it causes the off-center linking mechanism (C) to move
the end of the snap-action mechanism (X) upward. This
action, in turn, raises (D) to operate the switch or time-
controlled contacts.
The position of the needle valve at the bottom deter-
mines how fast the bellows rises. The needle valve setting
determines the time interval between the solenoid closing
and the rise of the bellows to operate the switch. If the
needle valve is almost closed, it takes a considerable
length of time for air to pass the valve and cause the bel-
lows to rise. Gravity causes the plunger (B) to drop when
the coil is de-energized. The action of the reset spring and
the falling plunger resets the timer almost instantaneously.
The off-delay mode in this Allen-Bradley relay is
shown in Fig. 9-16 with the solenoid rotated 180°.
When the operating coil (O) is energized, plunger (A) is
held down and (G) pushes against (B). That holds the

Many timers are easily converted from on-delay to
off-delay. Figure 9-19A shows some of the types avail-
able for various jobs. Most are synchronous motor dri-
ven. These are hysteresis-synchronous motors and are
self-starting but very accurate since they synchronize on
frequency rather than depend on voltage for constant
speed. Figure 9-19B shows a set of cams that can be pro-
grammed for their on-off periods. A number of these
switches can be ganged to control a number of opera-
tions. Figure 9-20 shows how a standard start-stop station
controlling an on-delay timer with a set of timed-closed
contacts is arranged in an elementary diagram.
bellows (E) in a fully compressed position. De-energiz-
ing the coil allows the reset spring to force (A) upward.
This also causes (G) to rise. That releases the downward
force on (B). With the pressure taken from (B), the bel-
lows (E) slowly expands. This forces (B) upward. As (B)
moves up, it trips to toggle; this is the same as in the on-
delay mode. Tripping the toggle causes the switch to be
tripped. Figure 9-17 shows the symbols used in the stan-
dard elementary diagrams for timed contacts.

MOTOR-DRIVEN TIMERS
There are many types of motor-driven timers used for
various purposes. Figure 9-18 is only one of the many
types utilized in industry and in commerce. This timer
is operated from a sustained or momentary contact
switch. In the latter case, the solenoid-actuated switch
can energize a load during the time period as an inter-
val timer. Its features are cam-actuated switches that
allow programmed timing, reduce switch actuator
over travel, and greatly extend switch life. A differen-
tial clutch employs hardened gears for reliable, long-
life operation. Power required is 120 V and the motor
consumes about 2.5 W. Scale reset is within 0.5 sec-
ond. Switch ratings are 10 A resistive at 125 V ac or
hp at 125 V.

SEQUENCE CONTROL
The circuit shown in Fig. 9-21 is a sequence control of
two motors, one to start and run for a short time after the
other stops. In this system it is desired to have a second
motor started automatically when the first is stopped.
The second motor is to run only for a given length of
time. Such an application might be found where the
second motor is needed to run a cooling fan or a pump.

Programming instructions come with the unit. The detailed
instructions manual ensures that you are able to program
the unit for its intended purposes.
SENSORS
Sensors are used for many purposes in industry. They
detect the presence or absence of materials or products.
They can be used to set off an alarm if one or a number
of conditions are not met. Sensors are made to sense
temperature, pressure, and in some instances, levels of
materials in tanks or storage facilities.
Solid-State Level Controls
The level control shown in Fig. 9-23 detects the level of
materials by having the material’s presence detected by
the two probes that stick out from the body of the sensor.
When the material being checked is between the two
probes, it changes the characteristics of a transistorized
circuit and causes it to energize a relay. A number of
approaches can be taken in electronics to accomplish
the sensing action. The Hall effect can be utilized (dis-
cussed in a later chapter), the eddy current method can
be used, or the capacitance between the two probes can
be changed by having the dielectric altered. The sensor
shown in Fig. 9-23 has the ability to respond in 0.5 second
To accomplish this, an off-delay timer (TR) is
used. When the start button is pressed, it energizes both
M1 and TR. The operation of TR closes its time delay
contact but the circuit to M2 is kept open by the open-
ing of the instantaneous contact. As soon as the stop
button is pressed, both M1 and M2 will continue to run
until TR times out and the time-delay contact opens.
PROGRAMMABLE TIMERS
With the advent of microprocessors and digitized
equipment, many types of programmable timers have
become available. One good example of some of the
possibilities that timers offer is shown in the Watchdog
Time Commander (Fig. 9-22). It is a precision, wall-
mounted, 365-day timer that can be programmed to
operate to an exact second. The timer consists of a
clock and an enclosure with a four-circuit capacity.
Another model has 16-circuit capability. Relay mod-
ules may be added to both models. Each relay module
controls four electrical circuits.
Sensors  
165

Watchdog Time Commander programmable timer. (Square D)
The timer accepts 60 operational programs, each
capable of controlling any or all circuits. Up to 20 holidays
may be programmed, and each holiday can be a single day
or an unlimited span of days. Battery backup retains pro-
grams, during power failures, for up to three years. Leap-
year adjustment is automatic and the start and end of
daylight savings time can be programmed. Commands
may also be programmed relative to sunrise and sunset.
Some of the purposes of this type of timing are
energy management, security, and a wide range of indus-
trial and commercial applications. Lights, water heaters,
fans, furnaces, and pumps may be turned on and off to
best utilize energy dollars. Door locks, burglar alarms,
and elevators may be cycled to ensure security during
unoccupied hours. Industrial and commercial uses
include sprinkler and irrigation systems, traffic control,
schools, and industrial bells for life testing. One-second
resolution provides precise and accurately-timed control.

to level changes. It can be used to detect either rising or
falling liquid levels in storage vessels, mixing tanks, or
pipelines. It can be used with any liquid compatible
with the stainless steel housing. It is ideally suited for
applications that have material buildup, foam, gas bub-
bles, or suspended solids. It is unaffected by agitation,
wave action, or turbulence and can be installed directly
without the need for measuring chambers or bypasses.
It is designed to operate between 24 and 250 V ac at
50/60 Hz, in series with the relay, solenoid, valve, or
annunciator it is to control. Power should never be
applied to the sensor without an external load con-
nected in series. Figure 9-24 shows how the power
input is connected and how the contacts are arranged at
terminals 7 through 12. Even with the load switched
off, a small current of less than 5 mA still passes
through the sensor and load to maintain power to the
unit’s sensing electronics.
The capacitance-type level limit control shown in
Fig. 9-25 has the ability to be mounted in any number
of positions. The field-selectable fail-safe mode is
advantageous since it allows the user to apply the unit
as either normally open (material absent) or normally
closed (material present). The connections shown in
Fig. 9-24, which also apply here for the sensor connec-
tions, are marked next to the 115-V ac power input.
The internal relay has its output connections from ter-
minals 7 to 12.
Temperature Sensing
The ability to sense the actual temperature or the abil-
ity to detect a difference between temperatures makes
it possible to control the temperature of liquid baths,
bearings, internal combustion engines, and large air
compressors, to mention but a few devices. Figure 9-26

The extremely sensitive sensing head detects materials
with dielectric constants as low as 1.5.
A dielectric is the material (air and vacuum or
other substances) that separates the two plates of a
capacitor. This material varies in its influence on the
capacitance of a capacitor. Each material has a con-
stant when compared with a vacuum, which has a con-
stant of 1. Table 9-2 shows the constants for a variety
of substances.

sizes and a multitude of shapes (Fig. 9-28). This is the
most temperature sensitive device, and its resistance
varies from 0.5  to 80 M. However, it does have
disadvantages, including nonlinear response and lim-
ited temperature range. Thermistors are used where it
is necessary to detect temperature changes of 1C in
chemical processes. They can also be used as a liquid-
or fluid-flow control device. They detect the presence
of a liquid through the temperature change in the
material. Once immersed in the liquid, a thermistor
can determine the temperature of the material and
serves to energize the proper circuitry to cause the
level to be corrected.
Resistance Temperature
Devices 
The thermistor changes resistance when heated in an
inverse direction, as is normal for most metals or mate-
rials. This means that gold, silver, iron, or pure elements
shows some of the temperature switches used for auto-
matic control of temperature-maintenance equipment
in industrial and general-duty applications. Tempera-
ture sensing may be done by a number of methods,
including: 
• thermocouple
• thermistor
• resistance temperature detector
• semiconductor temperature sensor
Thermocouple 
Thermocouple is the most widely used temperature-
sensing device. It dates back to 1821, when Thomas
Seebeck found that joining two wires made of differ-
ent materials generate an EMF when heated at one
end. The amount of heat is directly proportional to
the amount of output EMF or voltage. This is a sim-
ple, rugged device that can be made inexpensively. It
also has the advantage of being able to measure a
4500°F range of temperatures. It is, however, unsta-
ble and needs a reference junction to make sure that
its output is useful. Figure 9-27 shows how the ther-
mocouple works. Industry uses thermocouples for
measuring the temperature of ovens and furnaces, of
flowing liquids, and the core temperatures of nuclear
reactors.
Thermistor
Thermistor is a device that produces a decrease in
resistance when heated. As the temperature increases,
the resistance decreases. Thermistors come in many

such as these increase in resistance as they are heated.
This particular characteristic can also be used in
designing devices to control temperature.
Some of the best known devices are the bridge cir-
cuit (shown in Fig. 9-29), metal film resistance temperature
detectors, and helical resistance temperature devices.
The metal film detector is made by depositing a thin
film of platinum on a flat ceramic substrate and etching
it with a laser. It is then trimmed and sealed. This
makes a very sensitive device for detecting temperature

Strain Gage Transducers
Figure 9-30 shows two types of pressure transducers
that fulfill the requirements of many industrial users.
They are reliable, accurate, and provide a continuous
(analog) pressure input in process and factory automa-
tion. These strain gage-based sensors measure strain
or tension. The gages are attached to one side of a
pressure-sensing diaphragm, then pressure is applied
to the diaphragm, producing a minute deflection that
induces strain to the gages, thus changing their resis-
tances. By applying a constant voltage across the
strain gages, the change in resistance is measured. The
resulting outputs are conditioned to user needs
through amplifiers and other circuitry within the trans-
ducer (Fig. 9-31). 
Piezo-resistive Transducers 
This type of transducer or sensor is used to sense
ranges from 10 to 5000 psi. A strain sensor is incorpo-
rated in the semiconductor circuitry.
Pressure sensors are used in pneumatic systems;
hydraulic systems; irrigation systems; lubrication sys-
tems; heating, air-conditioning, and ventilation systems;
energy management systems; robotics; automated
process equipment; plant utilities; and machine tools.
changes. Disadvantages include the requirement of an
amplifier because of the small temperature changes and
the fact that response time is rather slow. 
Semiconductor Temperature
Sensor
Silicon and germanium can both be used for tempera-
ture sensing. Germanium-doped crystals can be used to
detect temperatures near absolute zero. The negative
temperature coefficient of germanium is similar to that
of the thermistor. However, silicon has a positive tem-
perature coefficient. It is also limited in its range of
sensing from 67F to 275F. Semiconductor temper-
ature sensors have good linearity and are small and
inexpensive.
Pressure Sensors
There are many ways to sense pressure. The strain
gage and the piezo-electrical are the two most com-
monly used to produce an electrical output that can be
utilized to control a process. Different manufacturers
use different methods. Each appears to have a spe-
cialty that has worked for years, and it is improved
over the years to make use of the latest technology in
the electronics field.

CHAPTER

Contact Sensors
A limit switch is a contact sensor that permits a system
to sense whether an object is present or missing. If the
object makes contact with the limit switch, the system
knows that the object is near enough to begin the next
operation. If the switch is not closed, it means that the
object is missing and the system must react accord-
ingly. That usually generates what is referred to as an
alarm condition.
Force, pressure, temperature, and tactile sensors all
respond to contact. They all send their signals to another
device or to a central location for processing.
Noncontact Sensors
Pressure changes, temperature changes, and electro-
magnetic changes can all be sensed by contact meth-
ods. They usually react to a change in a magnetic field
or a light pattern. If an electromagnetic field is dis-
turbed, it is sensed and fed to the controller. The same
is true of the disturbance of a light beam. Changes in
the light beam—its intensity or whether or not it is pre-
sent—are sent to an electronic circuit or controller for
processing and then sent back to a device so that it can
react according to the disturbance.
PRESENCE SENSING
Presence sensors indicate whether a part or piece is in
position. These are used to indicate an on-off condi-
tion. They are status devices that communicate a single
bit of information. Limit switches, proximity switches,
and photoelectric cells fall into this category. These
devices are becoming smaller and faster, and have
greater reliability, with increasing emphasis on non-
contact sensing.
LIMIT SWITCHES
Perhaps the most commonly used type of sensing
device is the limit switch. It has been around for many
years and has been used in almost all electrically oper-
ated devices. This wide usage translates into many var-
ied types of devices. Some are designed for general
purposes and others are designed for specific opera-
tions. For instance, they may be designed for corrosion
resistance, with sealed contacts that are oil-tight, or
they may be the plug-in style or non-plug-in type. This
type of switch has been designed as a rotating-cam
limit type with programming capability.
Various types of sensing devices are attached to the
limit switch (Fig. 10-1). The device may be a lever type
with a spring return, a lever type with a maintained

Sensors are the foundation of the control system.
They must provide usable input to the high-level con-
troller. They must gather data and communicate the
data, on a real-time basis, to the appropriate level
within the control system. A wide range of sensing
devices is available from many different technologies.
Sensors include a broad range of technologies and
physical configurations. They range from a simple
electromechanical limit switch, which provides a sin-
gle bit of information to the control system, to radio
frequency-activated tags storing up to 2K bytes of
manufacturing information.
CLASSES OF SENSORS
Sensors may be classified as either contact or noncon-
tact. They may be further classified as internal or exter-
nal and as passive or active. Various types of sensors
are added to manufacturer’s catalogs every year. In
order to keep up with these changes, it will be necessary
to use the internet to locate and read the latest informa-
tion for these new devices.

contact, a low-operating-torque type with a return
spring, a push type with spring return, a wobble stick,
or a cat whisker for making contact with the object
being tested, counted, stopped, or started. Limit switches
can also be designed for programmable operation.
Figure 10-2 is a solid-state control device used with
machinery and equipment having a repetitive operation
cycle where motion can be correlated to shaft rotation.
Its limits are controlled by three screwdriver locations
(Fig. 10-3). Chapter 5 provides many examples of limit
switches.
SPEED SWITCHES
Speed sensing can be used to sequence conveyors
where it is necessary for one conveyor to be running
at nearly full speed before a second conveyor is
started. The switch can also be used to indicate in
which direction material on a conveyor is moving
from the rotation of a suitably driven shaft (Fig. 10-4).
This switch is used in conjunction with automatic
starters arranged for reversing or plugging duty, to
provide plugging or antiplugging of squirrel-cage
motors. The pilot device can be used as a speed-
sending switch or indicate direction of rotation from
the driven shaft.

The contacts can be adjusted to determine the
speed at which they will operate. This is done by alter-
ing two external screws, one for each set of contacts.
After the operating temperature has been reached, the
screw is turned to adjust the point at which the contacts
are to operate. Changes in inertia of moving equipment
may require readjustment of the set points. 
In some cases an accidental turn of the shaft may
close the switch contacts and start the motor. To pre-
vent this, the switch can be equipped with a lockout
solenoid. The solenoid mechanically keeps the con-
tacts from operating unless the lockout coil is ener-
gized. This is a factory-mounted feature or can be field
mounted from a kit. If a lockout solenoid is used, a
slight change in the wiring is necessitated. Figure 10-5
shows which terminals are used for the lock out (LO)
solenoid.
In Fig. 10-6 the control circuit for forward-
direction plugging (with lockout protection) is optional.
Operation is as follows—pushing the start button
closes the forward contactor and the motor runs
forward. The normally-closed contact (F) opens the
circuit to the reverse contactor. The forward contact on
the speed switch closes.
Pushing the stop button drops out the forward con-
tactor. The reverse contactor is energized and the motor
is plugged. The motor speed decreases to the preset
speed setting of the switch, at this point the speed switch
contact opens and drops out the reverse contactor.
Figure 10-4 shows a speed switch used in a plug-
ging operation. A switch with normally open (NO)
contacts is used. It is designed to interrupt reverse brak-
ing power automatically as the motor approaches zero
speed. The speed at which the contacts operate can be
adjusted so as to avoid coasting or reverse rotation of
the motor. A speed switch can be wired for plugging in
either or both directions.
Antiplugging can also be accomplished by using
this switch. Then a switch with normally-closed (NC)
contacts is used. It is designed to keep the reverse con-
tacts open until the machine being driven has slowed to
a predetermined safe speed. At this speed the contacts
are designed to close, permitting reversing or breaking
by a designated method. The switch can be used for
antiplugging in either or both directions.
Operation of the Speed Switch
When the shaft of the switch is rotated, a magnet induc-
tion linkage operates a contact. One contact is provided
for forward operation and one for reverse. In plugging
circuits, the forward or reverse contact is closed
(depending on the direction of rotation) at any speed
above the point at which the contact is set to operate.
However, as the shaft speed is reduced, the electromag-
netic torque holding the contact closed is also reduced,
until a point is reached where the contact returns to the
normally-open position.

PRESSURE CONTROLS
Pressure controls operate on the principle of respond-
ing to changes in pneumatic (air or gas) or hydraulic
(water or oil) pressure applied to a bellows or piston.
This force is opposed by a main spring. Varying the
force on the main spring (by turning the range adjust-
ment screw) allows setting the contacts to trip at the
upper pressure setting. Turning the differential adjust-
ing screw (when provided) varies the force on a sec-
ondary spring and allows setting the lower pressure
setting, where the contacts reset to their static state.
Many ranges and differentials can be achieved by using
bellows or pistons of different sizes to meet various
requirements.
THEORY OF OPERATION
The pressure controls shown in Fig. 10-7 are designed
to open or close electrical circuits in response to
changes in pneumatic (air or gas) or hydraulic (oil or
non-corrosive liquids) pressure. Keep in mind that pis-
ton controls are not intended for use with air or water.
Once pressure is applied to the actuator, either a
bellows or piston type, the actuator exerts force on the
main spring until the threshold force of the main spring
is overcome and levers then transfer the motion to the
contact block. This displaces the contacts and is
referred to as the trip setting. The lever design ampli-
fies the actuator motion and provides a shorter stroke,
which results in increasing bellows life.
The lever assembly also includes a virtually friction-
free over-center toggle arrangement. This provides
positive snap action of the contact block for longer
contact life. As the pressure falls, the force on the dif-
ferential spring increases and the contacts return to
their normal state. This is referred to as a reset setting.
Varying the force of the main spring (by turning the
operating range adjustment screw) determines when
the contacts will trip. Varying the force of the differen-
tial spring (by turning the differential adjustment
screw) determines when the contacts will reset. Setting
trip and reset values determine the operating parame-
ters of the application.
Copper alloy bellows are used with air, water, oil,
noncorrosive liquids, vapors, or gases in a series of
pressure ranges from 30 in vacuum (Hg) to 900 psi.
Stainless steel bellows are used with many of the more
corrosive liquids or gases at pressures up to 375 psi.
Contact blocks are single-pole, double-throw and
can be wired to open or close on increasing or decreas-
ing pressures. Contact blocks can be obtained as a
replacement kit. See Fig. 10-8.
Refrigeration-type controls may have low pres-
sures ranging from 20 inHg vacuum to 120 psi. High
pressure cutout controls have ranges from 100 to 500
psi. They are available with or without maximum-
limit range stops to meet high-pressure safety adjust-
ment requirements. Figure 10-9 shows the trip and reset
pressure settings with minimum adjustment and max-
imum adjustment as well as differentials. Figure 10-10
shows the selection range for general applications.
Bellows are used in low-pressure ranges up to 650 psi.
Piston assemblies are used in high-pressure ranges
up to 5000 psi. A diaphragm is used on the vacuum
controls.
TEMPERATURE CONTROLS
Temperature controls may have direct vertical immer-
sion bulbs for sensing changes in temperature or they
may have remote capillary and bulb (Fig. 10-11).
Temperature controls are similar to pressure con-
trols. They differ in that a closed chemically filled
bellows system is used. The pressure in the system
changes in proportion to the temperature of the bulb.
The temperature response medium in the system is a
liquid whose vapor pressure increases as the temper-
ature of the bulb rises. As the temperature of the
bulbs falls, the vapor pressure decreases. The pres-
sure change is transmitted to the bellows through a
capillary tube operating the control at a predeter-
mined setting. Temperature controls using this accu-
rate and long-life vapor-pressure method of sensing
temperatures are available in a series of ranges from
150 to 570°F.
Armored capillary is available for added protection
of all bulb and capillary-type temperature controls.
Copper bulb and capillary, bronze armor, and controls
with stainless steel bulb and capillary are available for
various environments.
Wells and Packing Glands
Wells are used to mount and protect as well as permit
removal of the bulb when necessary without discharg-
ing the system. Glands form seals at any desired posi-
tion along the standard capillary. Armored capillary
wells and glands include a setscrew to hold the
armor so as not to expose the capillary. Wells are
also available with a retaining nut to secure the bulb
(Fig. 10-12). Figure 10-13 shows some contact blocks
for these controls.

FLOAT SWITCHES
Float switches are also sensing devices. They provide
automatic control for motors that pump liquids from a
sump or tank. They have both motor and pilot duty
ratings (Fig. 10-14).
Float switches have a snap-action mechanism for
quick-make and quick-break contact operation. This
feature provides high snap-through forces once the mech-
anism has traveled the required distance. This type of
switch is available in copper, brass, and stainless steel
to allow for wall or floor mounting to accommodate
different tank or sump depths. Figure 10-15 shows
various types of float switch arrangements.
ENCODERS
Industrial optical encoders are designed to convert
mechanical shaft rotation to an accurate electrical out-
put in binary-coded decimal (BCD) or optional Gray
code format. Gray code is defined as sequential num-
bers by binary values in which only one value changes
at a time. This type of encoder (Fig. 10-16) is designed
for use in industrial environments. It is a noncontact-
ing optical design that uses high-speed, low-torque
operation. Long life and good reliability are a result of
using electronic components. They include a light-
emitting diode as the source of light. A metal code disk
is used with the single-LED light source, utilizing a
fiber-optic light guide. Operating speed for BCD is
800 rpm and for Gray code 2000 rpm.
Many digital circuits, including some combina-
tional logic circuits, are designed to handle BCD data.
Binary-coded decimal is a code that uses a 4-bit
binary number to represent each digit in the decimal
system. This is a conventional code for taking decimal
information from a device such as a calculator key-
board and converting it to binary information for pro-
cessing by digital circuits. It is equally useful for
converting the binary output from digital circuits to
decimal information for displaying on an output
device such as a seven-segment light-emitting diode
(LED) or liquid  crystal display (LCD) (Table 10-1).
This information generated by the encoder can be fed
to circuits that are designed to utilize the information
and present it as a speed in rpm, and it can also be uti-
lized to control the speed of rotation by adjusting the
motor controller output.
Optical Programmable
Controller Encoders
Encoders are also designed for interface with pro-
grammable controllers. The encoder contains all the
electronics necessary to provide a latched output on com-
mand from a programmable controller. A data-ready
output signals the programmable controller when the
encoder data are latched. The encoders are capable of
being multiplexed, allowing one programmable con-
troller with one set of input cards/modules to accept
data from many encoders. The multiplex and latch cir-
cuits operate independently.
Multiplexing
Placing a logic zero (0) on the multiplex control line
will force all outputs to high-impedance state, allow-
ing the programmable controller to scan multiple

Operation
Proximity switches are designed for general-purpose
use, with a high output rating of 1 A maximum contin-
uous and 10 A maximum inrush. They are capable of
energizing such external loads as relays, contactors,
motor starters, and solenoids. Switches with program-
mable normally-open/normally-closed output have two
LED indicators: a power LED indicator that is on when
power is applied to the device, and an output LED indi-
cator that is on when the switch output is conducting
current.
Solid-State Switches
Switches for solid-state applications interface directly
with programmable controllers, hard-wired, solid-
state logic, and similar high-impedance loads. In addi-
tion, they have circuit protection against overload and
short-circuit conditions. In switches with a normally-
open, fixed output, the LED indicator is on when a
metal object is within the sensing field and the load is
energized.
Self-contained proximity switches include both
front-sensing and top-sensing types. The front-sensing
version can be arranged to sense in any of the four
directions: front, rear, or either side. The switches
come with a conduit coupler, threaded conduit open-
ing, pre-wired receptacle, or pre-wired cable base.
Inductive Cylindrical Switch
Inductive cylindrical switches are self-contained and
solid state (Fig. 10-18). They are also designed for
industrial environments where it is required to sense
the presence of metal objects, both ferrous and nonfer-
rous, without touching them. The switches are equipped
with a red LED to indicate the presence (NO output
configuration) or absence (NC output configuration) of
a target in the sensing field.
This type of switch interfaces with programmable
controller input modules without the use of an external

encoders using one set of input cards/modules. A mul-
tiplexer is a type of combinational digital circuit that is
readily available in an IC package. Multiplexing allows
a single conductor (bus line) to carry signals alternately
from a variety of signal sources. Multiplexers are also
called data selectors. They operate like an electrically
controlled rotary switch. The output line is like a pole
of a rotary switch, and the input lines are like the posi-
tions of a rotary switch. Data selectors are available
with as many as 16 input lines.
PROXIMITY SWITCHES
Proximity switches are designed for industrial environ-
ments in places where it is required to sense the pres-
ence of metal objects (ferrous and nonferrous) without
touching them. These are self-contained, two-wire
devices used in 120-V ac control circuits (Fig.10-17).

loading resistor. Switches can also be used to energize
relays, contactors, and motor starters. The switch hous-
ing is made of nickel-plated brass. The electronic cir-
cuitry is potted for protection against shock, vibration,
and contaminants.
Extended-Sensing-Range
Inductive Proximity Switch
The extended-sensing-range switch is also self-con-
tained and solid state (Fig. 10-19). It is designed for
industrial use such as materials handling (transfer
lines, roller-belt conveyors, and the like). The position
of objects traveling these lines cannot always be accu-
rately controlled, therefore the need to sense an
extended distance. This switch interfaces with pro-
grammable controllers without the use of loading
resistors.
PHOTOELECTRIC SWITCHES
The photoelectric industrial switch is self-contained
and has solid-state electronics as part of the package
(Fig. 10-22). The industrial-type photoelectric switch
is capable of sensing the presence of a wide variety of
objects without making contact.
The switch shown in Fig. 10-22 uses a modulated
infrared LED light-source detection system. It is mod-
ulated or pulsed in the near-infrared portion of the elec-
tromagnetic spectrum. This switch is highly tolerant of
ambient light, including sunlight.
Operation
This switch is a retro-reflective device that operates
loads between 10 and 30 V dc. It can be wired in cur-
rent sink or current source mode, for energizing a
variety of loads. The operating range is 18 ft for a 3-
in reflector. Other types use the through-beam photo-
electric system. The through-beam pair of 120-V ac
devices is especially well suited for demanding
applications that require a maximum range of 25 ft.
These switches can be used to operate relays, contac-
tors, and motor starters and interface directly with
most programmable controllers. The output condi-
tion can be programmed between light and dark
Self-Contained Low Profile
Proximity Switch
The self-contained low profile proximity switch will
operate with PCs and sense the presence of metal
objects (Fig. 10-21). There are two types: weld field
and general purpose. The weld-field type has a built-in

some switches to indicate reliable system performance.
An unstable indication from the LED means that the
light intensity level at the receiver is staying within
+20% of the switch trip point, resulting in marginal
switch operation (Fig. 10-23). Common situations
causing such an indication include:
1. Sensitivity adjustment set too low
2. Switch misalignment, particularly when the emitter
halo rather than the emitter beam is detected
(Fig.10-23)
3. Target or reflector set too far from the switch
4. Dust or other residue buildup on the lens or reflector
5. Target not large enough to block the light beam
completely
6. Insufficient contrast between the target and back-
ground (in diffusing applications)
This setup and use of a photoelectric switch system
without a stability indicator can result in premature
system failure. Failure modes can include erratic trip-
ping or no switching response. 
Figure 10-24 shows selectable light-dark operation
of the photoelectric switch. Polarized lenses are found
only on retro-reflective devices; a photoelectric switch
with polarized lenses detects only light signals
bounced off a retro-reflector. The switch is immune to
any undesirable light reflection from targets such as
metals, foils, mirrors, tiles, shrink wrap, and shiny
plastics.

Features
Reliable performance is the needed feature on any
sensing operation or system. One means of ensuring
proper operation of a photoelectric switch is to use a
stability indicator. A green stability LED is provided on

Photoelectric Light Sources
Generally, switch emitters are either an incandescent
light or an LED light source. LED light sources have
many advantages compared to incandescent. LEDs have:
• Longer life
• Virtually no heat dissipation
• Resistance to shock and vibration 
• Longer sensing ranges
• Cost-effectiveness
• The ability to be pulsed at high frequencies
Pulsing an LED beam creates a stronger light beam
capable of longer sensing ranges. By modulating the
pulse frequency, emitters can be keyed to the light
receiver. This helps eliminate ambient-light interfer-
ence problems.
LEDs are available in four basic color bands:
infrared, red, green, and yellow. All but yellow are
used as photoelectric switch emitters. Of the three
color bands used, infrared LED emitters are found in a
large majority of photoelectric switches. Infrared light
does the best job of penetrating dust, fog, and other
airborne particles that may interfere with a photoelec-
tric beam.
Red LED emitters can be found in fiber-optic units
using plastic fiber cable and in retro-reflective units
with polarized lenses. Mark sensors use either a red or
green LED emitter.
Mark Sensors
Selecting a mark sensor with the proper LED emitter
color depends on both the mark color and its back-
ground color. Table 10-2 is a useful guide for deter-
mining if a mark sensor will
• Require a green or red LED emitter
• Function stably in the light-operate or dark-operate
mode
Mark sensors detect (diffuse setting) color marks
on most materials, both opaque and transparent
(including film). They have either green or red emitter
LEDs and can detect a wide variety of color marks on
different backgrounds. Special optics and adjustable
lensing allow precise setting of the switch focal point.
This feature is useful in pinpoint detection (narrow vis-
ibility types) or for setting a precise limit to a detecting
distance (wide-visibility types). Special applications
for this device include detecting objects as shown in
Fig. 10-25. A miniature specialty focusable diffuse
switch is shown in Fig. 10-26.
Clear Material Detection
The retro-reflective type photoelectric switch is ideal
for transparent bottle detection. A special optical sys-
tem permits stable detection of clear materials not pre-
viously possible with conventional retro-reflective
photoelectric switches. The 1-m sensing range of this
switch makes the system flexible compared to standard

and data bases with information they need. Automatic
identification locates everything and tells you where it
is going. There are systems already tested that can keep
track of everything in production. They consist of a
radio-frequency (RF) identification system, bar code
readers and decoders, and multiplexing.
All of these involve hardware, software, and net-
working communications. They require sensors made
for special systems applications. Identification devices
can provide a few characters of data in the case of a bar
code system, or up to 2K bytes of data when a radio-
frequency system is used.
RADIO-FREQUENCY
IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS
Figure 10-28 shows the Allen-Bradley radio-fre-
quency (RF) system as it is set up for operation. The
system keeps track of parts and follows them through
the manufacturing process, without the need for a
paper chase or factoring in an operator error. Data can
be transmitted or received by an RF tag whenever they
pass an antenna. Keep in mind that the actual units
may have changed in shape as newer configurations
are available.
The system is based on radio waves that can pene-
trate plastic, wood, and various types of factory conta-
minants. It can be installed and operated in a wide
diffuse photoelectric switches normally used in these
applications.
SWITCH APPLICATIONS
Figure 10-27 shows the typical photoelectric switch
applications. Note the diffuse mode, specular mode,
through-beam mode, retro-reflective mode, and diffuse
mode. Sensing ranges are based on clean lenses and a
clean air environment. Air contaminants and dirty
lenses affect switch performance.
AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION
Automatic identification keeps a control system or
operation under scrutiny. It supplies the control system

range of industrial environments. It is dependable in
transferring its information to a control system
(Fig.10-29). Note how the system consists of three
main pieces of hardware: the antenna, RF tags, and the
universal identification interface (UII).
Using this method it is possible to use a single
method of product identification in all phases of pro-
duction and processing. Data can be stored on a read/
write RF tag and can be added to, altered, or deleted
whenever the tag passes an antenna.
The Antenna
The antenna contains both the transmit and receive
antennas (Fig. 10-30A). It decodes the data stored in
the tags and transmits this information to the UII or the
host, depending on the control architecture utilized.
Housed in a die-cast aluminum enclosure, the unit can
be installed on the shop floor or in a wide range of
industrial environments.
The RF Tag 
There are two RF tags available: the read/write and the
programmable (Fig. 10-30B). The read/write tag is a
small battery-powered tag that can store up to 2K bytes
of data and is reusable. 
The tag is activated when it enters the antenna’s
RF field. At that time the information can be read
from or written into the tag’s memory (Fig. 10-30).
The programmable tag is small and rugged. It is
designed for industrial applications and is also
reusable. The tag can be exposed to temperatures as
high as 180°C for up to 1 hour, without damaging
data stored in the tag. Up to 40 bytes of data can be

antenna’s RF field.
BAR CODE READERS AND
DECODERS
Bar coder readers offer fast entry of data, with speed
and accuracy not humanly possible through keyboard
entry (Fig. 10-31 shows a typical bar code). Scanning
devices can be stationary or portable. They can be auto-
matic or manually operated. Allen-Bradley has a vari-
ety of scanners to meet industrial needs.

Handheld Scanners
This reader (Fig. 10-32A) accepts input from a variety of
bar code scanners, offers high-performance decoding, and

away. The scanner head is separate from the decoder
console, so it can be installed in areas where space is a
problem. The decoder automatically decodes Code 39,
interleaved 2-of-5, UPC/EAN, and Codabar symbols.
MULTIPLEXING
The universal identification interface (UII) is a new idea
in automatic identification control. With one UII you
can multiplex up to eight sensors (Fig. 10-33). This type
of sensor utilization makes it possible for programmable
controllers and robots to function as intended.

RS-232 port makes it compatible with most computers.
The reader works with either a wand or a moving-beam
laser scanner. The laser scanner (Fig. 10-32B) is a non-
contact device that can operate in harsh environments. It
can be dropped on concrete and still survive to work
again. The scanning rate is 36 scans per second. Labels
can be decoded within 1 to 23 in. from the scanner,
depending on the density of the bar code symbol.
Moving-Beam Scanners
This type of scanner (Fig. 10-32C) operates at 175
scans per second and can decode symbols up to 20 in.

VISION SYSTEM
Sensing involves the five senses: touch, feel, smell,
taste, and seeing. The vision system makes use of the
size and shape of objects for its operation. Of course,
the ideal inspection rate is 100% at production-line
speeds. With a vision system it is possible to inspect,
visually, all products coming off a line. In fact, it is
also possible to inspect each product as it passes
through an operation heading toward completion
(Fig. 10-34).
Identification, location, and sorting of objects by
pattern recognition is possible with the utilization of
video imagery and computer technology. The system
offers a means of reducing product waste, inspection
errors, and human fatigue. This inspection system can
operate 24 hours a day and 7 days a week without
endangering product integrity.

11
CHAPTER

Electromagnetic lines of force that pass through
the core magnetize it. That means that the induced
magnetic field in the core has a south pole near the
coil’s north pole. Inasmuch as unlike poles attract, the
core is attracted toward the hole in the solenoid coil.
This attraction tends to pull the core into the coil. As
the iron core is pulled into the coil, the magnetic field
becomes increasingly shorter and the magnetic lines of
force travel the shortest possible distance when the
core centers itself in the coil.
By attaching a spring to the core, it is possible to
have the core return to its outside position once the
power is interrupted to the coil. When the power is then
turned on again, it pulls the core back into the coil. It
is this type of movement that is utilized in the con-
struction of industrial solenoids that operate switch
contacts in relays and motor starters and valves in gas,
air, and liquid lines of various types.
INDUSTRIAL SOLENOIDS
Tubular Solenoids
There are various uses for solenoids. Figure 11-2
shows tubular solenoids. Notice the type, voltage rat-
ing, coil resistance, and the minimum and maximum
lifts and strokes. Some are pull types and others are
push types. They are also specified as intermittent and
continuous duty. 
Frame Solenoids
The frame-mounted types of solenoids (Fig. 11-3) are
available in intermittent and continuous duty as well as
usable on either ac or dc. Types 11 and 28 can operate
on ac or dc. The other types are identified as to whether
they operate best on ac or dc.

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
1. Explain how a solenoid provides mechanical motion. 
2. Identify various types of industrial solenoids.
3. List applications for solenoid devices.
4. Select a solenoid according to its class.
5. Describe how to service solenoid coils.
6. Explain how solenoid valves work in circuits.
SOLENOIDS
Solenoids are devices that turn electricity, gas, oil, or
water on and off. Solenoids can be used, for example,
to turn the hot water on and the cold water off, to get a
proper mix of warm water in a washing machine. To
control the hot water solenoid, a thermostat is inserted
in the circuit.
A solenoid where the length is greater than the
diameter is one of the most common types of coil con-
struction used in electricity and electronics. The field
intensity is the highest at the center in an iron-core
solenoid. At the ends of the air-core coil, the field
strength falls to a lower value.
A solenoid that is long compared to the diameter has
approximately half the field intensity at the ends than at
the center. If the solenoid has a ferromagnetic core, the
magnetic lines pass uniformly through the core.
Mechanical motion can be produced by the action
of a solenoid or a solenoid can generate a voltage that
is a result of some mechanical movement. The term
solenoid commonly means a coil of wire with a mov-
ing iron core that can center itself lengthwise within
the coil when current is applied to the coil. Then if a
ferromagnetic core is properly suspended and under
suitable tension, it can be moved in and out of a sole-
noid coil form with the application of current to the
coil. This is the operating basis of some relays and a
number of other electromechanical devices. When an
outside force is used to move the ferromagnetic core
physically, it is possible to induce a voltage in the sole-
noid coil.
There is a tendency in a solenoid for the core to
move so that it encloses a maximum number of mag-
netic lines of force. Each line of force has the shortest
possible length (Fig. 11-1). In the illustration the core is
outside the coil. Because it is a ferromagnetic material,
the coil presents a low-reluctance path to the magnetic
lines of force at the north end of the coil. These lines of
force concentrate the soft-iron core and then complete
their paths back to the south pole of the electromagnet.

The starter solenoid on an automobile uses a simi-
lar procedure except that the plunger has electrical
contacts on the end that complete the circuit from the bat-
tery to the starter. The solenoid uses low voltage (12 V)
and low current to energize the coil. The coil in turn
sucks the plunger upward. The plunger, with a heavy-
duty copper washer attached, then touches heavyduty
contacts that are designed to handle the 300 A needed
to start a cold engine. In this way, low voltage and low
current are used, from a remote location, to control low
voltage and high current.
Solenoids as Electromagnets
An electromagnet is composed of a coil of wire wound
around a core of soft iron. A solenoid is an electromag-
net. When current flows through the coil, the core
becomes magnetized.
The magnetized core can be used to attract an arma-
ture and act as a magnetic circuit breaker (Fig. 11-5). Note
APPLICATIONS
Solenoids are devices that turn electricity, gas, oil, or
water on and off. Solenoids can be used, for example,
to turn the cold water on, and the hot water off to get
the proper mix of warm water in a washing machine.
To control the hot water solenoid, a thermostat is
inserted in the circuit.
Figure 11-4 shows a solenoid for controlling nat-
ural gas flow in a hot-air furnace. Note how the coil
is wound around the plunger. The plunger is the core
of the solenoid. It has a tendency to be sucked into
the coil whenever the coil is energized by current flow-
ing through it. The electromagnetic effect causes the
plunger to be attracted upward into the coil area. When
the plunger is moved upward by the pull of the electro-
magnet, the soft disc (10) is also pulled upward, allow-
ing gas to flow through the valve. This basic technique
is used to control water, oil, gasoline, or any other liquid
or gas.
Applications

how the magnetic circuit breaker is connected in series
with both the load circuit to be protected and with the
switch contact points. When excessive current flows in
the circuit, a strong magnetic field in the electromagnet
causes the armature to be attracted to the core. A spring
attached to the armature causes the switch contacts to
open and break the circuit. The circuit breaker must be
reset by hand to allow the circuit to operate properly
again. If the overload is still present, the circuit breaker
will “trip” again. It will continue to do so until the cause
of the short circuit or overload is found and corrected.
Solenoid Coils
The coil is the most important part of the solenoid,
inasmuch as the valve or switch contacts that it oper-
ates cannot work unless the coil is capable of being
energized. There are at least three types of coils you
should be aware of in solenoids used in air conditioning,

refrigeration, and heating circuits. For various applica-
tions they are divided into classes, as outlined in
Table 11-1 (see Fig. 11-6).
Servicing Coils
Coils can be replaced when they malfunction. Exces-
sive heat causes coil malfunction. Make sure that the
valve is not heated to a temperature above the coil rat-
ing. When replacing a coil, reassemble the solenoid cor-
rectly. A missing part or improper reassembly causes
excessive coil heat. See the exploded view in Fig. 11-7.
Applied voltage must be at the coil-rated fre-
quency and voltage. A damaged plunger tube or tube
sleeve causes heat and can prevent the solenoid from
operating. For applications requiring greater resistance
or different electrical requirements, use the proper coil
in the solenoids. Do not change from ac to dc or dc to
ac without changing the entire solenoid assembly (coil,
plunger, plunger tube, and base fitting).
When replacing a coil, first be sure to turn off
the electric power to the solenoid. It will not be neces-
sary in most instances to remove the valve from the
pipeline. Disconnect the coil leads. Disassemble the
solenoid carefully and reassemble in reverse order.
Failure to reassemble the solenoid properly can cause
coil burn out.

anced diaphragm for high operating pressure with low
electrical power consumption. It is suitable for use with
all gases and comes in a variety of sizes, capacities, and
pressures.
Presence of a low, barely audible hum is normal
when the coil is energized. If the valve develops a
buzzing or chattering noise, check for proper voltage.
Thoroughly clean the plunger and the interior of the
plunger tube. Make sure that the plunger tube and sole-
noid assembly are tight. See Fig. l1-9.

fixture it is controlling reaches the desired tempera-
ture. The most common application of the solenoid
valve is in the liquid line and operates with a thermo-
stat. With this hookup, the thermostat is set for the
desired temperature in the fixture. When this tempera-
ture is reached, the thermostat opens the electrical cir-
cuit and shuts off the current to the valve. The solenoid
valve, closes and shuts off the refrigerant supply to the
expansion valve. The condensing unit operation is
controlled by the low-pressure switch. In other appli-
cations, where the evaporator is in operation for only a
few hours each day, a manually operated snap switch
is used to open and close the solenoid valve.
Refrigeration Valve
The solenoid valve shown in Fig. 11-11 is operated with
a normally closed status. A direct-acting metal ball and
seat assure tight closing. The two-wire, class W coil is
supplied standard for long life on low-temperature 
SOLENOID VALVES IN CIRCUITS
Solenoid valves are used on multiple installations in
refrigeration systems. They are electrically operated as
shown in Fig. 11-10. When connected as shown in the
illustration, the valve remains open when current is
supplied to it. It closes when the current is turned off.
In general, solenoid valves are used to control the liq-
uid refrigerant flow into the expansion valve or the
refrigerant gas flow from the evaporator when it or the

service or sweating conditions. Current failure or inter-
ruption causes the valve to fail-safe in the closed posi-
tion. Explosion-proof models are available for use in
hazardous areas.
This solenoid valve is usable with all refrigerants
except ammonia. It can also be used for air, oil, water,
detergents, butane or propane gas, and other non-cor-
rosive liquids or gases.
A variety of temperature control installations can
be accomplished with these valves. Such installations
include bypass, defrost, suction line, hot gas service,
humidity control, alcohols, unloading, reverse cycle,
chilled water, cooling tower, brine, and liquid-line stop
installations and ice makers.
The valves are held in the normally closed position
by the weight of the plunger assembly and fluid pres-
sure on top of the valve ball. The valve is opened by
energizing the solenoid or coil. This magnetically lifts
the plunger and allows full flow by the valve ball.
De-energizing the coil permits the plunger and valve
ball to return to the closed position.

Motor Starting
Methods
12
CHAPTER

Single-phase and polyphase motors call for differ-
ent approaches or methods to start them under various
conditions of operation. Most single-phase motors are
started by the turning on of an on-off switch or a mag-
netic starter.
STARTING THE MOTOR
One of the most important parts of the electric motor
is the start mechanism. A special type is needed for
use with single-phase motors. A centrifugal switch is
used to take a start winding out of the circuit once the
motor has come up to within 75% of its run speed.
The split-phase, capacitor-start, and other variations
of these types all need the start mechanism to get
them running.
The stator of a split-phase motor has two types 
of coils, one called the run winding and other the
start winding. The run winding is made by winding
the enamel-coated copper wire through the slots in
the stator punchings. The start winding is made in the
same way except that the wire is smaller. Coils that
form the start windings are positioned in pairs in the
stator directly opposite each other and between the
run windings. When you look at the end of the stator,
you see alternating run windings and start windings
(Fig. 12-1).

ELECTRIC MOTORS
Electric motors are designed to deliver their best over-
all performance when operated at the design voltage
shown on the nameplate. However, this voltage is
often not maintained. Instead, it varies between mini-
mum and maximum limits over what is termed voltage
spread. The voltage spread is usually due to the wiring
and transformers of the electrical distribution system
and varies in proportion to motor or load currents.
In most modern plants using load-center power dis-
tribution systems, variations in voltage normally will be
within recommended limits of 110 to 120, 220 to 240,
440 to 480, and 550 to 600 for single-phase and three-
phase squirrel-cage and synchronous motors. However,
there are older plants throughout the country with large
low-voltage systems. Long low-voltage feeders often
cause voltage drops that result in below-standard voltages
at the motor terminals, especially during motor starting,
when currents may be up to six times normal full-load.
Table 12-1 shows the effect of voltage variations on the
performance of polyphase induction motors.

forces are produced during starting by the repulsion
between the magnetic pole in the armature and the
same kind of pole in the adjacent stator field winding.
The repulsing force is controlled and changed so that
the armature rotational speed increases rapidly, and if
not stopped, would continue to increase beyond a prac-
tical operating speed. It is prevented by a speed-actuated
mechanical switch that causes the armature to act as a
rotor that is electrically the same as the rotor in single-
phase induction motors. That is why the motor is called
a repulsion-induction motor.
The stator of this motor is constructed very much
like that of a split-phase or capacitor-start motor, but
there are only run or field windings mounted inside.
End bells keep the armature and shaft in position and
hold the shaft bearings.
The armature consists of many separate coils of
wire connected to segments of the commutator. Mounted
on the other end of the armature are governor weights,
which move pushrods that pass through the armature
core. These rods push against a short-circuiting ring
mounted on the shaft on the commutator end of the
armature. Brush holders and brushes are mounted in
the commutator end bell, and the brushes, connected
by a heavy wire, press against segments on opposite
sides of the commutator (Fig. 12-3).
Repulsion-Induction Motor  
203
Fig. 12-2
Single phase induction motor.
The two wires from the run windings in the stator are
connected to terminals on an insulated terminal block in
one end bell where the power cord is attached to the same
terminals. One wire from the start winding is also tied
to one of these terminals. However, the other wire from
the start winding is connected to the stationary switch
mounted in the end bell. Another wire then connects this
switch to the opposite terminal on the insulated block.
The stationary switch does not revolve but is placed so
that the weights in the rotating portion of the switch,
located on the rotor shaft, will move outward when the
motor is up to speed and open the switch to stop electrical
current from passing through the start winding.
The motor then runs only on the main winding
until such times as it is shut off. Then, as the rotor
decreases in speed, the weights on the rotating switch
again move inward to close the stationary switch and
engage the start winding for the next time it is started. 
Reversibility
The direction of rotation of the split-phase motor can
be changed by reversing the start winding leads.
Uses
This type of motor is used for fans, furnace blowers,
oil burners, office appliances, and unit heaters.
REPULSION-INDUCTION MOTOR
The repulsion-induction motor starts on one principle
of operation and, when almost up to speed, changes
over to another type of operation. Very high twisting
Fig. 12-3
Brush-lifting, repulsion-start, induction-run, single-
phase motor.
When the motor is stopped, the action of the gov-
ernor weights keeps the short-circuiting ring from
touching the commutator. When the power is turned on
and current flows through the stator field windings, a
current is induced in the armature coils. The two
brushes connected together form an electromagnetic
The run windings are all connected together, so the
electrical current must pass through one coil com-
pletely before it enters the next coil, and so on through
all the run windings in the stator. The start windings are
connected together in the same way and the current
must pass through each in turn (Fig. 12-2).

coil that produces a north and south pole in the arma-
ture, positioned so that the north pole in the armature is
next to a north pole in the stator field windings. Since
like poles try to move apart, the repulsion produced
in this case can be satisfied in only one way, by the
armature turning and moving the armature coil away
from the field windings.
The armature turns faster and faster, accelerating
until it reaches what is approximately 80% of the run
speed. At this speed the governor weights fly outward
and allow the pushrods to move. The pushrods, which
are parallel to the armature shaft, have been holding
the short-circuiting ring away from the commutator.
Now that the governor has reached its designed speed,
the rods can move together electrically in the same
manner that the cast aluminum disks did in the cage of
the induction motor rotor. This means that the motor
runs as an induction motor.
Uses
The repulsion-induction motor can start very heavy,
hard-to-turn loads without drawing too much cur-
rent. They are made from 1/2 to 20 hp. This type of
motor is used for applications such as large air com-
pressors, refrigeration equipment, large hoists, and
are particularly useful in locations where low-line
voltage is a problem. This type of motor is no longer
used in the refrigeration industry. Some older oper-
ating units may be found with this type of motor
still in use.
CAPACITOR-START MOTOR
The capacitor motor is slightly different from a split-
phase motor. A capacitor is placed in the path of the elec-
trical current in the start winding (Fig. 12-4). Except for
the capacitor, which is an electrical component that
slows any rapid change in current, the two motors are
the same electrically. A capacitor motor can usually be
recognized by the capacitor can or housing that is
mounted on the stator (Fig. 12-5).
Adding the capacitor to the start winding increases
the effect of the two-phase field described in con-
nection with the split-phase motor. The capacitor
means that the motor can produce a much greater twist-
ing force when it is started. It also reduces the amount
of electrical current required during starting to about
1.5 times the current required after the motor is up to
speed. Split-phase motors require three or four times
the current in starting than they do in running.
REVERSIBILITY
An induction motor will not always reverse while run-
ning. It may continue to run in the same direction but at
a reduced efficiency. An inertia type load is difficult to
reverse. Most motors that are classified as reversible
while running will reverse with a noninertial-type load.
They may not reverse if they are under no-load condi-
tions or have a light load or an inertial load.

Figure 12-6A shows a capacitor-start, induction-
run motor used in a compressor. This type uses a relay
to place the capacitor in and out of the circuit. More
details regarding this type of relay will be given later.
Figure 12-6B shows how the capacitor is located out-
side the compressor.
Uses
Capacitor motors are available in sizes from 1/6 to 20 hp.
They are used for fairly hard-starting loads that can be
brought up to run speed in under 3 seconds. They may
be used in industrial machine tools, pumps, air condi-
tioners, air compressors, conveyors, and hoists.
One of the problems related to the reversing of a
motor while it is still running is the damage done to the
transmission system connected to the load. In some
cases it is possible to damage a load. One of the ways
to avoid this is to make sure that the right motor is con-
nected to a load.
Reversing (while standing still) the capacitor-start
motor can be done by reversing its start winding connec-
tions. This is usually the only time that it will work on a
motor.  The available replacement motor may not be rotat-
ing in the direction desired, so the electrician will have to
locate the start winding terminals and reverse them in
order to have the motor start in the desired direction.

PERMANENT SPLIT-CAPACITOR
MOTOR
The permanent split-capacitor (PSC) motor is used in
compressors for air-conditioning and refrigeration units.
It has an advantage over the capacitor-start motor inas-
much as it does not need the centrifugal switch and its
associated problems.
The PSC motor has a run capacitor in series with
the start winding. Both run capacitor and start winding
remain in the circuit during start and after the motor is
up to speed. Motor torque is sufficient for capillary
and other self-equalizing systems. No start capacitor
or relay is necessary. The PSC motor is basically an
air-conditioner compressor motor. It is very common
upto 3-hp, but is also available in the 4- and 5-hp sizes
(Fig. 12-7).
stator field starts increasing from zero (1), the lines of
force expand across the face of the pole piece and cut
through the strap. A voltage is induced in the strap. The
current that results generates a field that opposes the
cutting action (and decreases the strength) of the main
field. This action causes certain actions: As the field
increases from zero to a maximum of 90, a large por-
tion of the magnetic lines of force are concentrated in
the unshaded portion of the pole (1). At 90 the field
reaches its maximum value. Since the lines of force
have stopped expanding, no EMF is induced in the
strap, and no opposite magnetic field is generated. As a
result, the main field is uniformly distributed across the
poles as shown in (2).
From 90 to 180 the main field starts decreasing or
collapsing inward. The field generated in the strap
opposes the collapsing field. The effect is to concen-
trate the lines of force in the shaded portion of the poles
as shown in (3).
Note that from 0 to 180, the main field has shifted
across the pole face from the unshaded to the shaded
portion. From 180 to 360, the main field goes through

SHADED-POLE MOTOR
The shaded-pole induction motor is a single-phase
motor. It uses a unique method to start the rotor turn-
ing. The effect of a moving magnetic field is produced
by constructing the stator in a special way (Fig. 12-8).
Portions of the pole-piece surfaces are surrounded
by a copper strap called a shading coil. The strap causes
the field to move back and forth across the face of the
pole piece.
In Fig. 12-9, the numbered sequence and points on
the magnetization curve are shown. As the alternating

shaded-pole motor with a molded plastic fan blade. For
maximum air circulation the location of the fan on the
motor shaft is most important. Mounting the fan blade
too far back or too far forward on the motor shaft, in
relation to the evaporator cover, will result in improper
air circulation. The freezer compartment fan must be
positioned with the lead edge of the fan 1/4 in in front
of the evaporator cover.
The fan assembly shown in Fig. 12-11 is used on
the top-freezer, no-frost, fiberglass-insulated model

the same change as it did from 0 to 180. However, it is
now in the opposite direction (4). The direction of the
field does not affect the way the shaded pole works. The
motion of the field is the same during the second half-
hertz as it was during the first half-hertz.
The motion of the field back and forth between
shaded and unshaded portions produces a weak torque.
This torque is used to start the motor. Because of the
weak starting torque, shaded-pole motors are built in
only small sizes. They drive such devices as fans,
clocks, and blowers.
Reversibility
Shaded-pole motors can be reversed mechanically. Turn
the stator housing and shaded poles end for end. These
motors are available from 1/250 to 1/2 hp.
Uses
As mentioned previously, this type of motor is used as
a fan motor in refrigerators and freezers. They can also
be used as fan motors in some types of airconditioning
equipment where the demand is not too great. They can
also be used as part of the timing devices used for
defrost timers and other sequenced operations.
The fan and motor assembly are located behind
the provisions compartment in a refrigerator, directly
above the evaporator in the freezer compartment. The
suction fan pulls air through the evaporator and blows
it through the provisions compartment air duct and
freezer compartment fan grille (Fig. 12-10). This is a

SPLIT-PHASE MOTOR
Instead of rotating, the field of a single-phase motor
merely pulsates. No rotation of the rotor takes place.
A single-phase pulsating field may be visualized as
two rotating fields revolving at the same speed but in
opposite directions. The rotor will revolve in either
direction at nearly synchronous speed if it is given an
initial impetus in either one direction or the other. The
exact value of this initial rotational velocity varies
widely with different machines. A velocity higher
than 15% of the synchronous speed is usually suffi-
cient to cause the rotor to accelerate to the rated or
running speed. A single-phase motor can be made
self-starting if means can be provided to give the
effect of a rotating field.
To get the split-phase motor running, a run wind-
ing and a start winding are incorporated into the stator
of the motor. Figure 12-12 shows the split-phase motor
with the end cap removed so that you can see the start-
ing switch and governor mechanism. 

This type of motor is difficult to use with aircondi-
tioning and refrigeration equipment inasmuch as it has
very little starting torque and will not be able to start a
compressor since it presents a load to the motor imme-
diately upon starting. This type of motor, however, is
very useful in heating equipment (Fig. 12-13).
During across-the-line starting, motor input current
is five to eight times the normal full-load current. This
can cause an excessive temporary voltage drop on
power lines that causes lights to flicker or may even
interrupt the service.
To control these temporary voltage drops, power
companies have restrictions such as
• A specific maximum starting current (or kVA)
• A specific limit on kVA/hp
• A maximum horsepower motor size which can be
started across-the-line
• A specific maximum line current that can be drawn
in steps (increment starting)
The specified restrictions vary considerably between
power companies, even within one company’s service
area. It is wise to check local power company restric-
tions before making a larger motor installation.
REDUCED-VOLTAGE STARTING
METHODS
Reduced-voltage starters operate such that input cur-
rent and consequently torque are reduced during
starting. Table 12-2 briefly describes the various
methods of starting and gives features and limitations
of each.
When motors are started at reduced voltage, the
current at the motor terminals is reduced in direct
proportion to the voltage reduction, while the torque
is reduced as the square of the voltage reduction.
For example, if the “typical” motor were started at
65% of line voltage, the starting current would be
42% and the torque would be 42% of full-voltage
values. Thus reduced-voltage starting provides an
effective means of reducing both current and torque
(Fig. 12-19).

POLYPHASE MOTOR STARTERS
The simple manual starter works for single-phase
motors and also, in some instances, for polyphase
motors. Most of the polyphase manual starters consist-
ing of an on-off switching arrangement are designed
for motors of 1 hp or less. Figure 12-14 shows the
magnetic motor starter designed for across-the-line
control of squirrel-cage motors or as primary control
for wound-rotor motors. They are available for nonre-
versing, reversing, and two-speed applications. The
drawing in Fig. 12-15A shows the difference between
the single- and three-phase nonreversing type of starter.
Figure 12-15B shows the reversing drawing; Fig. 12-15C
is the two-speed, one-winding starter, and Fig. 12-15D
is the two-speed, two-winding starter for motors up
to 100 hp.

PRIMARY RESISTOR STARTING
In primary resistor starting, a resistor is connected in
each motor line (in one line only in single-phase starters)
to produce a voltage drop due to the motor starting cur-
rent. A timing relay shorts out the resistors after the
motor has accelerated. Thus the motor is started at
reduced voltage but operates at line voltage. 
Figure 12-16 shows two types of motor starter
resistors. The resistance element will retain its mechan-
ical and electrical properties both during and after
repeated heating and cooling. All metal parts are either
plated with or fabricated of corrosion-resistant material
for overall corrosion protection. Under certain condi-
tions operating temperatures may reach 600C and not
change the resistance value. The motor starter resistors
are 11, 14, 17, and 20 in long and come in wattage rat-
ings of 450 to 1320. Table 12-3 shows the resistance

starting resistors, and the motor will now be running at
full voltage. The contactor (S) and timing relay (TR) are
de-energized when the interlock runb opens.
An overload, which opens the stop button or other
pilot device, de-energizes the (run) contactor. This
removes the motor from the line.
Primary resistor starters provide extremely smooth
starting due to the increasing voltage across the motor
terminals as the motor accelerates. Since motor current
decreases with increasing speed, the voltage drop across
the resistor decreases as the motor accelerates and the
motor terminal voltage increases. Thus if a resistor is
shorted out as the motor reaches maximum speed, there
is little or no increase in current or torque.
AUTOTRANSFORMER STARTING
Autotransformer starters provide reduced-voltage start-
ing at the motor terminals through the use of a tapped,
three-phase autotransformer. Upon initiation of the con-
troller pilot device, a two-and a three-pole contactor
close to connect the motor to the preselected autotrans-
former taps. A timing relay causes the transfer of the
motor from the reduced-voltage start to line-voltage oper-
ation without disconnecting the motor from the power
source. This is known as closed transition starting.
ranges and other factors. Note the current-handling abil-
ity of the resistors.
Primary resistor starters are sometimes known as
cushion starters. The main reason for the name is their
ability to produce a smooth, cushioned acceleration with
closed transition. However, this method is not as efficient
as other methods of reduced-voltage starting, but it is ide-
ally suited for applications such as conveyors, textile
machines, or other delicate machinery where reduction of
starting torque is of prime consideration.

Taps on the autotransformer provide selection of
50%, 65%, or 80% of line voltage as a starting voltage.
Starting torque will be 25%, 42%, or 64%, respectively,
of line-voltage values. However, because of transformer
action, the controller line current will be less than motor
current, being 25%, 42%, or 64% of full-voltage values.
This autotransformer starting may be used to provide
maximum torque available with minimum line current,
together with taps to permit both of these factors to be
varied. Figure 12-19 shows torque and voltage tap points.
Manual autotransformer starters are used to start
squirrel-cage polyphase motors when the characteris-
tics of the driven load or power company limitations
require starting at reduced voltage (Fig. 12-20).
NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Associ-
ation) permits one start every 4 minutes, for a total of
four starts followed by a rest period (2 hours). Each
starting period is not to exceed 15 seconds. Figure 12-21
shows a autotransformer type of starter. Note the loca-
tion of the taps on the starting transformer.
The autotransformer provides the highest starting
torque per ampere of line current. Thus it is an effective
means of motor starting for applications where the
inrush current must be reduced with a minimum sacri-
fice of starting torque. This type of starter arrangement
features closed-circuit transition, an arrangement that
maintains a continuous power connection to the motor
during the transition from reduced to full voltage. This
avoids the high transient switching currents character-
istic of starters using open-circuit transition. It pro-
vides smoother acceleration as well.
Operation
Operating an external start button or pilot device closes
the neutral and start contactors, applying reduced volt-
age to the motor through the autotransformer. After a

PART-WINDING STARTING
Part-winding motors have two sets of identical
windings—intended to be operated in parallel—which
can be energized in sequence to provide reduced start-
ing current and reduced starting torque. Most (but not
all) dual-voltage 230/460-V motors are suitable for part-
winding starting at 230 V.
When one winding of a part-winding motor is ener-
gized, the torque produced is about 50% of “both wind-
ing” torque, and line current is 60 to 70% (depending on
motor design) of comparable line voltage values. Thus,
although part-winding starting is not truly a reduced
voltage means, it is usually also classified as such
because of its reduced current and torque.
preset interval, the timer contacts drop out the neutral
contactor, breaking the autotransformer connection but
leaving part of the windings connected to the motor as
a series reactor. The run contactor then closes to short
out this reactance and apply full voltage to the motor.
Transition from reduced to full voltage is accomplished
without opening the motor circuit.
For starters rated up to 200 hp you should allow a
15-second operation out of every 4 minutes. This proce-
dure is followed for 1 hour with a rest period of 2 hours.
For starters rated above 200 hp, you should allow three
30-second operations separated by 30-second intervals
followed by a rest period of 1 hour. The major disad-
vantages of this type of starter are its expense for lower
horsepower ratings and its low power factor.
Part-Winding Starting  
213
Fig. 12-21
Typical wiring diagram for an autotransformer type of reduced-voltage starter. (Allen-Bradley)

When a dual-voltage delta-connected motor is oper-
ated at 230 V from a part-winding starter having a three-
pole start and a three-pole run contactor, an unequal
current division occurs during normal operation result-
ing in overloading of the starting contactor. To overcome
this defect, some part-winding starters use a four-pole
starting contactor and a two-pole run contactor. This
arrangement eliminates the unequal current division
obtained with a delta-wound motor, and it enables wye-
connected part-winding motors to be given either a one-
half or two-thirds part-winding start.
The class 8640 starters have a start contactor, a tim-
ing relay, a run contactor, and necessary overload relays.
Closing the pilot device contact causes the start contactor
to close to connect the start winding and to initiate the
time cycle. After expiration of the preset timing, the run
contactor closes to connect the balance of the motor
windings. A time setting of 1 second is recommended.
Most motor manufacturers do not permit energization of
the start winding alone for longer than 3 seconds. Part-
winding starters provide closed transition starting.
Operation
The part-winding type of starter is shown in Fig. 12-22.
The parts are located for ease in understanding the oper-
ation. By taking a look at the schematic in Fig. 12-23
you can see how the starter operates. Closing the start
button or other pilot device energizes the start contactor
(1M) that seals in through its interlock (1Ma) and
energizes the timer (TR). The (1M) contacts connect
the first half-winding of the motor across the line. After
a preset time interval, timer TRTC contacts close the
energizing contactor (2M). The (2M) contacts connect
the second half-winding of the motor across-the-line.
An overload, which opens the stop button or other
pilot device, de-energizes contacts 1M, 2M, and timer
TR, removing the motor from the line. The three-pole
contactor (1M) connects only the first halfwinding of
the motor for reduced inrush current on starting. A
three-pole contactor (2M) connects the second half-
winding of the motor for running.
Advantages and Disadvantages
Part-winding starters are the least expensive reduced-
voltage controller. They use closed transition starting
and are small in size. The disadvantages are that they
are unsuitable for long acceleration or frequent start-
ing, require special motor design, and that there is no
flexibility in selecting starting characteristics.
WYE-DELTA OR STAR-DELTA
STARTERS
Wye-delta or star-delta starters are used with delta-
wound squirrel-cage motors that have all leads brought
out to facilitate a wye connection for reduced-voltage
starting. This starting method is particularly suitable
for applications involving long accelerating times or
frequent starts. Wye-delta starters are typically used for
high-inertia loads such as centrifugal air-conditioning
units, although they are applicable in cases where low
starting torque is necessary or where low starting cur-
rent is necessary and low starting torque is permissible.
When 6- or 12-lead delta-connected motors are started
star-connected, approximately 58% of fullline voltage is
applied to each winding and the motor develops 33% of
full-voltage starting torque and draws 33% of normal
locked-rotor current from the line. When the motor has
accelerated, it is reconnected for normal delta operation.

Advantages and Disadvantages
The advantages are moderate cost and its suitability for
high-inertial, long-acceleration loads. It does have
torque efficiency. However, the disadvantages are that
it requires special motor design, starting torque is low,
and it is inherently open transition—closed transition
is available at added cost. There is no flexibility in
selecting starting characteristics.

Operation
Operating an external start button energizes the motor in the
wye connection (Fig. 12-24). This applies approximately
58% of full-line voltage to the windings. At this reduced
voltage, the motor will develop about 33% of its full-
voltage starting torque and will draw about 33% of its nor-
mal locked rotor current. After an adjustable time interval,

the motor is automatically connected in delta, applying full
line voltage to the windings. In starters with open-circuit
transition the motor is momentarily disconnected from the
line during the transition from the wye to delta. With closed
transition (Fig. 12-25) the motor remains connected to the
line through the resistors. This avoids the current surges
associated with open-circuit transition.

circuit transistion. (Allen-Bradley)

suitable for wye-delta starting. Figure 12-26B shows the
connection to the lines for the six-lead motor. Keep in
mind that overload relay protection is required by the
National Electrical Code. The size of the protection is
determined by the manufacturer of the motor (Table 12-4).
MULTISPEED STARTERS
Multispeed starters are designed for the automatic
control of two-speed squirrel-cage motors of either the
consequent pole or separate winding types. These
starters are available for constant-horsepower, constant-
torque, or variable-torque three-phase motors. Multi-
speed motor starters are commonly used on machine
tools, fans, blowers, refrigeration compressors, and
many other types of equipment.
Low-Speed Compelling Relay
When added to a standard starter, the low-speed com-
pelling relay compels the operator always to start the
motor in low speed before switching to a higher speed.
This is a safety feature where damage to equipment may
result when the motor is started at high speed (Fig. 12-27).
Automatic Sequence
Accelerating Relay
The automatic sequence accelerating relay will control
the sequence of acceleration from low speed to high
speed.
Automatic Sequence
Decelerating Relay
The automatic sequence decelerating relay is used with
large-inertia loads. The braking effect caused by a sud-
den change from high to low speed may cause damage
to the motor or to the driven machine. To avoid this
danger, the operation should give the motor sufficient
time to slow down by pushing the stop button and then
waiting a short interval before pushing the button for a
lower speed.
To help provide correct operation, multispeed
starters can be equipped with an automatic sequence
decelerating relay for each lower-speed step. This relay
automatically interposes a time delay between the
speed steps and makes it unnecessary to press the stop
button when switching to a lower speed.

CONSEQUENT-POLE MOTOR
CONTROLLER
By increasing the number of poles a motor has it is possi-
ble to change its speed. By increasing the number of
poles, the speed of the motor is decreased. Inasmuch as a
motor is wound and mounted rather permanently on a
frame, it is not easily possible to take out or put in poles or
the associated windings. Therefore, an electrical means
must be found if the speed of the motor is to be changed
by using the number of poles method to do so. One
method of doing this is the consequent-pole arrangement.
This method can be used for two-speed, one-winding
motors or four-speed, two-winding motors.
The reversal of some of the currents in the wind-
ings has the same effect as physically increasing or
decreasing the number of poles. Three-phase motors
are wound, in some cases, with six leads brought out
for connection purposes. It is possible to connect the
windings, using combinations of the terminals for con-
nection purposes, either in series delta or in parallel
wye (Fig. 12-28). By tapping the windings it is possible
to send current in two different directions, effectively
creating more poles and decreasing the speed of the
motor. The number of poles is doubled by reversing
through half a phase. Two speeds are obtained by pro-
ducing twice as many consequent poles for lowspeed
operation as for high speed.
Figure 12-29 shows how the controller is wired to
produce consequent poles for constant torque or vari-
able torque. The wiring diagram and the line drawing
(Fig. 12-30) illustrate connections for the following

method of operation: The motor can be started in either
high or low speed. The change from low to high or
from high to low can be made without first pressing the
stop button. 
Figure 12-31 shows pilot devices with connections
that can be made to obtain different sequences and
methods of operation. The series delta arrangement
produces high speed. It also produces the same horse-
power rating at high and low speeds.
The torque rating is the same for both speeds if the
winding is such that the series delta connection gives
the low speed and the parallel wye connection gives the
high speed. Consequent-pole motors that have a single
winding for two speeds have the extra tap at the mid-
point of the winding. This permits the various connec-
tion possibilities. However, the speed range is limited
to a 1:2 ratio of or 600/1200 or 900/1800 rpm.
Figure 12-32 shows the motor terminal markings
and connections for a constant-horsepower delta.
The wiring diagram (Fig. 12-33) and the line drawing

current, and the motor and the driven machine can
withstand the sudden starting shock. Examples of
this are machines that start unloaded, as well as
those that require little torque; or machines may be
equipped with some form of unloading device to
reduce starting torque, as in the use of an unloader
valve in a compressor. A clutch may be inserted
between a machine and motor so that the motor may
be started unloaded. When the motor is up to speed
the clutch is engaged. Clutches are sometimes used
on large machines so that maximum horsepower can
be exerted during breakaway without serious power
system disturbance. Use of clutches also permits
using motors with lower torque and locked-rotor
currents. In most instances, up-to-date installations
use solid-state motor controllers to better advantage.
Many of the older types of starters are still in use
and will continue to provide good service for many
more years. As they deteriorate, they are usually
replaced by a solid-state type of starter so that the
clutch arrangements are unnecessary.
Figure 12-38 shows the general-purpose enclo-
sure for a full-voltage starter. This type of starter is
designed for full-voltage starting of polyphase
squirrel-cage motors and primary control of slip-
ring motors. This type of starter may be operated by
remote control with pushbuttons, float switches,
thermostats, pressure switches, snap switches, limit
switches, or any other suitable two- or three-wire pilot
device.
STARTING SEQUENCE
If full-voltage starting produces excessive current
demands on the distribution system, motors should be
started individually or in blocks of permissible size
by using some method of time delay, such as motor
driver, pneumatic, or mercury plunger timing relays.
When large and small motors are to be started on a
common power system, best results are obtained by
starting the largest sizes first. This gives larger motors
the advantage of full-line capacity. If synchronous
pressed between speeds. The pilot devices shown in
Fig. 12-35 show the other connections that can be
made to obtain sequences and methods of operation.
Four-speed, two-winding consequent-pole motor
controllers can be used on squirrel-cage motors that
have two reconnectable windings and two speeds for
each winding. This type of motor does need a special
type of starting sequence. This means that it must use
the properties of the compelling relay, accelerating
relay, and decelerating relay to operate correctly. 
Figure 12-36 shows the two-speed consequent-
pole starter with variable-torque and constant-torque
connections. Figure 12-37 shows how the four-speed,
two-winding controller is connected for the possible
arrangements using this type of motor.
FULL-VOLTAGE CONTROLLERS
The least expensive of the starters is the full-voltage
type. There is no limit to the horsepower, size, voltage
rating, or type of motor that can be started on full volt-
age when the power is available.
Full-voltage starters are always the first choice
when the power system can supply initial inrush

motors are on the system with other types of ac
motors, the synchronous units should always be started
first since they provide voltage stability for starting
the induction motors.
PROTECTION AGAINST LOW
VOLTAGE
Low-voltage protection is needed while the motors are
running even though systematic starting permits all
motors to be started without excessive line voltage drop.
When three-wire control circuits are used, a severe dip in
line voltage or a momentary complete outage breaks the
control-sealing circuits, and the controller drops out and
stops the motor. This provides low-voltage protection
and prevents simultaneous acceleration of all motors to
full speed after being slowed down by a voltage dip.
However, all motors are disconnected from the line dur-
ing the voltage dip, and each must be restarted.
TIME-DELAY PROTECTION
It is possible to wire the circuitry so that a time-delay
undervoltage arrangement can be used. This permits
dropout of the controllers on low-voltage dips but
allows restarting automatically if normal voltage is
restored within a preset time delay. The usual time
delay is 2 seconds or less.
Time-delay undervoltage protection on con-
trollers will prevent some complete shutdowns but
should be applied with caution. If used on all motor
controllers, restoration of voltage within the time-
delay setting after a voltage dip causes each motor
to attempt to accelerate simultaneously, thus pro-
ducing excessive currents that may operate backup
protection and starter overload devices and discon-
nect the motors.
Pilot devices such as pressure, float, or tempera-
ture switches automatically start and stop motors as
the demand arises. On severe voltage dips or voltage
failure, motor controllers drop open even though the

demand switch is closed. Upon restoration of full
voltage, all units attempt to restart at the same time.
This operating hazard can be overcome by adding a
time delay in the starting circuit of each motor and
timing the demand for starting at slightly different
intervals. Time delays of various units can then be stag-
gered so that at the restoration of voltage only one unit
at a time will be started.

ELECTROMECHANICAL DEVICES
The electromechanical devices used for years are still
reliable and working in many installations. They are
used to provide sequencing and interlocking tasks.
They are simple in construction, flexible in use, and
have many contact combinations. They can also handle
large currents and break the circuit as required.
Solid-state devices have no moving parts and no con-
tacts to clean, replace, or adjust. They use transistors, triacs,
diacs, and SCRs to do the switching. These logic elements
can perform the same functions in a solid-state system as
relays do in the electromechanical systems (Fig. 13-1).
Fig. 13-1
Solid-state reduced-voltage controller. (Square D)
The solid-state control device has many advan-
tages that make it desirable for the various environ-
ments in which it has to operate. It has no contacts to
become dirty or malfunction when needed to control a
critical sequence of operations. The solid-state control
devices are more reliable than electromechanical devices.
They come in sealed-in modules that can be plugged
into a rack and replaced as a unit if anything goes wrong
with the circuitry.
REDUCED-VOLTAGE STARTING
Reduced-voltage starting can be accomplished in a
number of ways. However, in solid-state circuitry it is

somewhat simpler than described previously. The exact
details of the circuit functions are somewhat more com-
plex than those of the electromechanical system; how-
ever, a complete understanding of solid-state physics
and/or electronics is not necessary in order to grasp the
workings of the simple devices utilized to perform the
operations of solid-state switching and control.
SILICON-CONTROLLED
RECTIFIERS
The silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) is the device used
most often to control electric motors. The proper name
for an SCR is thyristor. However, popular use of the
term SCR has made it part of the literature and accepted
by everyone working in the field. It is a specialized type
of semiconductor used for control of electrical circuits.
An SCR conducts current in a forward direction
only. The symbol for an SCR is shown in Fig. 13-2.
Current flows through an SCR from the cathode (C) to
the anode (A). The illustration indicates the SCR also
has a gate (G).
The function of the SCR is shown in the circuit
diagram in Fig. 13-3. The most typical use of an SCR is
for a controlled circuit. Examples include a light dimmer
or a speed control for a motor. This type of circuit is

illustrated in Fig. 13-3. The resistor in this circuit, R, is
a rheostat, or adjustable resistor. This is used to control
the amount of voltage delivered to the gate of the SCR.
The more voltage delivered, the greater the flow. Thus,
adjusting the rheostat can serve to control the circuit. If
the circuit illuminates a lamp, lowering the voltage to
the rheostat dims the bulb. If the load is a motor, its
speed is slowed. Figures 13-4, 13-5, and 13-6 show what
typical SCRs look like with their leads identified
according to cathode, gate, and anode connections.
Silicon-Controlled Rectifiers  
227

Fig. 13-6
Larger currents require larger SCRs.
One of the main reasons for using semiconductor
devices for motor control is the device’s ability to start
a motor under reduced-voltage conditions and thus
allow the motor to accelerate to full speed at a lower
torque level. By reducing the high current inrush the
mechanical shock to the driven equipment is reduced.
A reduced-voltage solid-state motor starter uses
SCRs for power control. Inasmuch as an SCR conducts
in the direction of the arrow in the symbol, it means
that current flows only one way in an SCR. To use an
SCR to its advantage on ac it is necessary to use two
of them in reverse parallel (Fig. 13-7). SCRs have to be
turned on in order to conduct current through them;
that is, they need a gate pulse to turn them on. Once an
SCR is turned on or gated, it does not stop forward cur-
rent flow. Full wave control uses two SCRs in each
phase. Three-phase operation must utilize six diodes,
connected as shown in Fig. 13-8.
Fig. 13-7
Parallel SCRs for one phase.
Fig. 13-8
Three-phase SCR arrangement.
Fig. 13-9
Outputs for differently gated SCRs.
The current through an SCR can be controlled by
gating the SCR at different times within the half cycle.
This also controls the acceleration time of the motor. If
the gate pulse is applied early in the half cycle, the out-
put is high. If the gate pulse is applied late in the half-
cycle, only a small part of the waveform is passed
through and the output is low. So by controlling the
SCR’s output voltage the motor acceleration character-
istics can be controlled. (Fig. 13-9).

SOLID-STATE STEPLESS
ACCELERATION
The class 8660 solid-state reduced-voltage controller
provides smooth, stepless acceleration of a three-phase
induction motor. The controller offers several standard
and optional features to control, monitor, and protect the
motor during the start and run modes of operation. Mod-
ular construction of the controller adds flexibility and
ease of maintenance (Fig. 13-10). Soft start is accom-
plished by gradually turning on six silicon-controlled
rectifiers. Two SCRs are connected in a back-to-back or
reverse-parallel arrangement and mounted on a heat sink
to make up a power pole. The power pole also contains a
printed circuit board and a thermal sensor.
LOGIC RACK 
The logic rack is located on the lower part of the
controller and has sockets for eight plug-in modules
(Fig. 13-12). Each module has a specific location
and performs a specific function in the operation of
the controller. The module in the first position is inter-
nal to the controller and provides wiring connections
between the power pole and the logic modules. The
modules in positions 2 through 8 control the firing of
the SCRs, check for correct startup and running condi-
tions, and provide a visual indication of the controller
status through the use of LEDs. The B-2 module goes
in the second position, one of the B-3 modules goes in
the third position and so on. The specific module func-
tions are noted below.
228

Firing of the SCRs is controlled by the modules on
the logic rack. These modules also check for correct
startup and running conditions and provide a visual
indication of controller status through the use of light-
emitting diodes (LEDs). Each module has a specific
location and function. Figure 13-11 shows a logic
module rack.

This module provides logic voltages and checks for
correct starting conditions. The control can be started
if the control power LED is on and the start inhibit
LED is off.
B-3 Module
A three-phase, temperature-compensated, solid-state
overload relay is supplied as an integral part of the
controller. It provides class 10, inverse-time trip char-
acteristics that protect against harmful motor over-
loads. There is a different B-3 module for each of the
four controller current ratings of 200, 320, 500, and
720 A. Motor full-load current settings are adjustable

back
This option allows the motor speed to be
increased linearly with the time until the motor reaches
full speed (Fig. 13-14). Start time is adjustable from
3 to 30 seconds and does not fluctuate with motor load-
ing. This method gives the smoothest acceleration but
requires a tachometer input. Motor current is limited to
the current-limit setting.
by the use of potentiometers on the B-3 module. An
overload condition will automatically de-energize the
controller, close the alarm contact, and light the trip-
and start-inhibit LEDs. An overload test feature on the
logic rack assembly provides a check for operation of
the solid-state overload circuitry. Overload trip time is
a function of the current-limit setting. The lower the
current-limit setting, the longer the trip time. Trip times
for three current-limit settings are shown in Table 13-1.
Longer trip times for high-inertial loads can be pro-
vided on the other types of controllers. Form Z72 pro-
vides class 30, inverse-time trip characteristics by using
a special B-3 module and power poles with higher cur-
rent ratings. Trip times for class 30 overloads are
shown in Table 13-1.

B-4 Module
The starting method that is used is determined by the
B-4 module. Current limit starting is standard and is
adjustable by the use of a potentiometer on the logic
rack assembly. Optional starting methods are available.
A description of each of the starting methods follows.
Current Limit (B-4A Module)
The current-limit
feature will limit the motor current to a preset level at
all times during start and run conditions. Current limit
is adjustable between 150 and 425% of motor full-
load current by way of a potentiometer located on
the logic rack. If a shorting contactor is used, this
feature will be present only in the start condition
(Fig. 13-13).

Voltage Ramp (B-4C Module)
This option allows
the applied motor voltage to increase linearly from 0 to
100% over an adjustable period of 3 to 30 seconds.
The motor current is limited to the current-limit set-
ting. This method provides acceleration that is approx-
imately linear from zero to full speed but does not
require a tachometer. The actual acceleration time
depends on the motor and load (Fig. 13-15).
Current Ramp (B-4D Module)
This option sup-
plies a breakaway currrent to the motor at start and
then linearly ramps the current up to the current-
limit setting. Breakaway current is adjustable from
0% to 150% of motor full-load current. Ramp time
is adjustable from 0 to 7 seconds. This method
provides the greatest control of starting current
(Fig. 13-16).

Accel/Decel (B-4E Module)
This option provides
both a soft start and a soft stop. Starting characteristics
are identical to the voltage ramp start B-4C This option
also allows the applied motor voltage to decrease lin-
early from 50% to 0% over an adjustable period of 3 to
30 seconds to provide a soft stop. Provisions for an
emergency stop are included (Fig. 13-17).
adjustable from 0% to 90% of motor full-load current.
This can be disabled by adjusting the setting to zero.
B-5 Module
The B-5 module determines the correct firing sequence
of the SCRs.
B-6 Module
The B-6 module provides the firing phase angles of the
SCRs, which determines the percent of conduction for
each SCR.
B-7 Voltage Monitor Module
This optional module provides three separate functions:
1. Phase unbalance 
2. Phase reversal 
3. Underload
B-8 Energy-Saving Module
The energy-saving module will automatically adjust the
voltage to the motor when load fluctuations occur. The
motor will maintain full speed and required torque but
draw less kVA when the load decreases. If the load
increases, the module will respond by increasing the
kVA so that the motor and load do not slow down in
speed. This feature cannot be used on controllers with
shorting contactors.
SHORTED SCR SWITCH
If an SCR shorts, the short is detected and the shorted
SCR switch will flip to the yes position. This switch
will also trip the shunt trip circuit breaker (if used)
ahead of the controller. If there is an open circuit
between the controller and the motor, the shorted SCR
circuitry will trip. This can occur if there is an open
disconnect switch between the controller and motor.
Isolation contactors should be placed ahead of the con-
troller. A motor load must be connected to the con-
troller to prevent nuisance tripping of the shorted SCR
circuitry.

If any one of these occurs, the controller will shut
off and the appropriate LEDs will be lighted. The
phase unbalance function is activated whenever three-
phase power is present at the controller line terminals
but is disabled during starting. A fault condition
occurs when voltage unbalance is greater than the
unbalance setting. The voltage unbalance setting is
adjustable from 5% to 14% as defined by NEMA
standards.
The phase-reversal function is activated whenever
three-phase power is present at the controller line ter-
minals. A fault condition occurs if the three phases are
not in correct sequence. Without the B-7 module, the
controller is phase insensitive and will operate with
any phase sequence.
The underload function is activated after the motor
is “up to speed.” A fault condition occurs when the
motor drops below the underload setting, which is

DIAC
The diac is basically a two-terminal device. It has a
parallel-inverse combination of semiconductor lay-
ers. This combination of layers permits the triggering
of the device in either direction (Fig. 13-21). As you
remember, the SCR allowed triggering in only one
direction. Thus the diac has the ability to conduct in
up-to-speed relays are mounted on the controller and
wired internally. Figure 13-19 shows the solid-state
reduced-voltage controller with a shorting contactor
and Fig. 13-20 shows the controller with a shorting

both directions when an ac signal voltage is applied
across its terminals. There are a number of applica-
tions for such a device. One of them is in the control
of ac electric motors. They may also be used in prox-
imity detectors.
Note in the symbol that the diac does not have a
gate or control element. It can be used as a bidirec-
tional trigger diode (Fig. 13-23B). Current can flow
either way when enough voltage is supplied for
breakover. Typically, the firing potential is about 30 V
in either direction. The diac is in its off state until the
voltage across terminals T1 and T2 exceeds the breakover
voltage. In power control circuits a diac can be used for
more effective control of the turn-on point for the gate
electrode of either a triac or an SCR.
TRIAC
The triac is basically a diac with a gate terminal. The
gate terminal controls the turn-on conditions of this
bilateral device. The gate current can control the action
of the device in either direction. This is similar to that
of the SCR. However, the characteristics of the triac are
somewhat different from those of the diac. Figure 13-22
shows the symbol and the location of the gate terminal.
arrangement as with an SCR. An ac motor may have a
problem with this type of pulsating dc voltage. When
the switch is moved to position 3, the full ac sine-wave
voltage is applied to the gate, with, of course, a reduc-
tion in value caused by the resistor R. Now that both
halves of the ac sine wave are applied to the gate, the
triac conducts full time and the full value of ac is applied
to the ac motor. The motor then runs at full speed. R can
be made a variable type and its value would then con-
trol the amount of ac current that passes through the
triac and to the motor.
Another arrangement for the triac is shown in
Fig. 13-23B. Here a diac is used to trigger the triac. The
trigger voltage is controlled by the variable resistor.
This allows for better regulation of the motor.
Triacs are packaged in the same types of cases as
SCRs, so it is difficult or impossible to tell by a visual
inspection which type is in the package. The numbers
on the package indicate whether it is an SCR or a triac.
There are triacs available today that can handle in excess
of 10-kW loads.
232
Solid-State Reduced-Voltage Starters

Symbol for a triac.
By placing the triac in a circuit it is possible to
indicate how it works (Fig. 13-23). In this arrangement
the switch is used to select various conditions for the
triac. The load can be either a light bulb or an ac motor.
When the switch is in position 1 there is no gate con-
nection. The triac does not conduct. The motor does
not run. There is no trigger voltage applied to the gate.
In position 2, a diode is placed in the circuit and with
its polarity so arranged to allow a trigger voltage applied
to the gate on the positive pulse of the ac applied to the
circuit. The triac conducts, but only one-half of the ac
sine wave.
This means that only about one-half of the normal
current is applied to the motor. This is the same

the “dirty” power source. The buildup and collapse of a
magnetic field whenever a coil of wire or inductor is
energized and de-energized produces spikes and other
types of electrical noise. These spikes can cause prob-
lems with solid-state devices since they are susceptible
to voltage surges and spikes that are commonplace
with the energizing of relay coils and the turning on
and off of electric motors.
SURGE SUPPRESSORS
Surge suppressors are installed on magnetic device
coils, such as relays, contactors, and motor starters. A
voltage-surge suppressor may have its leads connected
to the coil terminals. The purpose of the suppressor is
to limit voltage noise and overvoltage spikes produced
by the starter coil when the coil circuit is opened.
The surge suppressor shown in Fig. 13-25 is made to
be easily mountable directly across the coil terminals of
contactors and starters with 120 and 240 V ac coils. The
purpose of the suppressor is to limit voltage transients for
applications requiring interface with solid-state compo-
nents. One suppressor is required for each coil.
LIGHT-EMITTING DIODES
Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are used as indicator
lights on the module panels for solid-state controllers.
They are small, give enough light for the purpose, and
draw very little current. They are available in red, green,
and amber (Fig. 13-24).
Surge Suppressors

nals. (Allen-Bradley)
LEDs are made of gallium-arsenide junctions, a
semiconductor material. Creation of electron-hole pairs
is a reversible process. Energy is released when an
electron recombines with a hole. In gallium-arsenide,
an electron drops directly into a hole and a photon of
energy is emitted. The gallium-arsenide junctions
provide the best conditions for the generation of radi-
ation in the visible range. Some are made for infrared
radiation.
LEDs are used as indicator lamps. In most instances,
they must be used in series with a resistor. They are
also used as logic indicators for computer circuits.
When reverse biased, the LED is nonconducting. This
means that you have to have the proper polarity con-
nections to the cathode and anode in order for it to
glow. It is capable of conducting current when it is
forward biased. It emits light when conducting with a
forward bias current. An LED usually operates on 1 to
3 V. Excessive current will destroy an LED, and this
calls for a series resistor in most circuits.
USING SOLID-STATE CONTROL
AND ELECTROMAGNETIC
DEVICES
When solid-state controls are utilized in circuits that
have electromagnetic devices, there are problems with

Figure 13-26 shows two types of surge suppressors
used to reduce the high transient voltages generated
when the coil circuit is opened. These suppressors are
used with relay coils and other electromechanical
devices.

Figure 13-27 is a surge suppressor used to protect
solid-state devices against electrical transients that
can result whenever electromechanical devices are
operated.
Suppressors are for use with relays, timers, ac
contactors, and starters. This suppressor consists of a
resistor-capacitor combination sealed in epoxy.
LIGHTNING PROTECTION
Lightning can also present some high-voltage surges.
Secondary surge arrestors can be installed to prevent
problems associated with lightning (Fig. 13-28). The
arrestor shown in Fig. 13-28A is for single-phase, two-
or three-wire grounded service. Two of them may be
installed to provide protection on 208Y/ 120-V ac,
three-phase, four-wire services. This suppressor will
handle 1500 A at 940 V, 5000 A at 1600 V, 10,000 A at
2200 V, and 20,000 A at 3250 V.
A suppressor for use on 650-V ac phase-to-ground
maximum is shown in Fig. 13-28B. It is used for three-
or four-wire grounded service such as single phase
three-wire, three-phase three-wire, or three phase four-
wire systems. This suppressor will handle 1500 A at
2200 V, 5000 A at 2900 V, and 10,000 A at 3400 V, and
20,000 A at 4000 V. These are maximum discharge
voltages that appear across the arrestor during the
passage of the discharge current. Discharge current is
the current at the arrester during sparkover.

Speed Control 
and Monitoring

CHAPTER

The difference in speed for any given load between
synchronous and load speed is called the slip of the
motor. Slip is usually expressed as a percentage of the
synchronous speed. 
Synchronous speed equals the speed of the rotating
field. Since the amount of slip is dependent on the load,
the greater the load, the greater the slip will be, that is,
the slower the motor will run. This slowing of the
motor, however, is very slight, even at full load, and
amounts from 1 to 4% of synchronous speed. Thus
the squirrel-cage type is considered a constant-speed
motor.
This type of motor is not suitable for industrial
applications where a great amount of speed regulation
is required, because the speed can be controlled only
by a change in frequency, number of poles, or slip.
Speed control by changing the frequency is becoming
very popular. The number of poles is sometimes
changed either by using two or more distinct windings
or by reconnecting the same winding for a different
number of poles.
SYNCHRONOUS MOTORS
A synchronous motor is by definition one that is in uni-
son or in step with the phase of the alternating current
that operates it. This condition is only approximated in
practice because there is always a slight phase differ-
ence. Any single-phase or polyphase alternator will
operate as a synchronous motor when supplied with
current at the same potential, frequency, and wave
shape that it produces as an alternator, the essential
condition in the case of an alternator being that it must

MOTOR SPEED CONTROL
Controlling the speed of an electric motor is possible
in some instances. However, there is always some
price to pay for speed control. A motor is usually
designed to operate at a given speed, and any deviation
from that speed causes it to have less starting torque or
to run hot.
Industrial processes call for motors that can be var-
ied in their speed. This means that methods must be
designed to handle the variable-speed requirement.
The first place to look is at the characteristics of the
motors themselves as to what they will or will not tol-
erate in terms of speed variations.
SQUIRREL-CAGE MOTORS
The speed of a squirrel-cage induction motor (Fig. 14-1)
is nearly constant under normal load and voltage con-
ditions but is dependent on the number of poles and the
frequency of the ac source. This type of motor slows
down, however, when loaded by an amount that is just
sufficient to produce the increased current needed to
meet the required torque.

Squirrel-cage electric motor.

is constant for a given frequency and number of poles.
The equation for the determination of motor speed is
where P is the number of poles of the motor.
All motors are built with an even number of poles,
so the available speeds on 60 Hz range from 3600 rpm
for a two-pole machine down to 80 rpm for a machine
containing 90 poles. This allows the motor to be directly
connected to its load, even at lower speeds, where induc-
tion motors cannot be used advantageously because of
low operating efficiency and power factor.
Some motors are required to operate at more than
one speed but are constant-speed machines at a partic-
ular operating speed. For example, when a speed ratio
of 2:1 is required, a single-frame, two-speed synchro-
nous motor may be suitable. Four-speed motors are
used when two speeds that are not in the ratio of 2:1 are
desired.
The single-frame, two-speed motor is usually of
the salient-pole type of construction, with the number
of poles corresponding to the low speed. High speed is
obtained by regrouping the poles so as to obtain two
adjacent poles of the same polarity, followed by two
poles of opposite polarity. This gives the effect of
reducing the number of poles on the rotor by one-half
for high-speed operation. Corresponding changes in
the stator connections are also made. This switching is
usually accomplished automatically by means of mag-
netic starters, by manually operated pole-changing
equipment. Figure 14-3 shows a synchronous motor
and exciter with the exciter-field rheostat, field switch,
and exciter-field meters.

be speeded up to synchronism before being put into the
circuit.
A synchronous motor may have either a revolving
armature or a revolving field. Most synchronous motors
are of the revolving field type. The stationary armature
is attached to the stator frame, while the field magnets
are attached to a frame that revolves with the shaft.
The field coils are excited by direct currents, either
from a small dc generator (usually mounted on the
same shaft as the motor and called an exciter) or from
some other source. Figure 14-2 shows a directly con-
nected exciter.
In most industrial applications today, solid-state
electronics provide the dc needed for operation of this
type of motor. Solid-state electronics also provides the
change in frequency needed to control the speed of the
motor.
Excitation
Field excitation for a synchronous motor is obtained
from a separate exciter set driven by an induction
motor, from a direct-connected or belted exciter, or
from a constant dc voltage supply such as a station bus.
Standard excitation voltage is either 125 or 250 V, but
the motor field winding is designed for an excitation
voltage approximately 10% below this, to allow for
voltage drop in the line.
Speed
The speed of a synchronous motor is determined by the
frequency of the supply current and the number of
poles of the motor. This means that the operating speed

Starting
To make a synchronous motor self-starting, a squirrel-
cage winding is usually placed on the rotor. After the
motor reaches a speed slightly below synchronous,
the rotor is energized. When synchronous motors are
started, their dc fields are not excited until the rotor has
practically reached full synchronous speed. The start-
ing torque required to bring the rotor up to this speed is
produced by induction.
In addition to a dc winding on the field, synchro-
nous motors are generally provided with a damper or
amortisseur winding. It consists of short-circuited bars
of brass or copper embedded in slots in the pole faces
and joined together at either end by means of end rings.
This winding usually termed a squirrel-cage winding,
enables the motor to obtain sufficient starting torque
for the motor to start under load.
The starting torque necessary to bring the motor
up to synchronous speed is termed the pull-in torque.
The maximum torque that the motor will develop
without pulling out of step is termed the pull-out
torque.
When the stator winding in the synchronous motor
is being excited by the ac line connection, it immedi-
ately sets up a rotating magnetic field. The rotating flux
of this field cuts across the damper winding of the rotor
and induces secondary currents in the bars of this
winding. The reaction between the flux of these sec-
ondary currents and that of the rotating stator field pro-
duces the torque necessary to start the rotor and to
bring it up to speed.
When the rotor has been brought up to nearly syn-
chronous speed (as an induction motor because of the
damper winding), the dc field poles are excited and the
strong flux of these poles causes them to be drawn into
step or full synchronous speed with the poles of the
rotating magnetic field of the stator. During normal
operation, the rotor continues to revolve at synchro-
nous speed as if the dc poles were locked to the poles
of the rotating magnetic field of the stator. Because a
synchronous motor has no slip after the rotor is brought
up to full speed, no secondary currents are induced
in the bars of the damped windings during normal
operation.
Starting Methods
In starting a synchronous motor as an induction motor,
the voltage impressed on the motor should be reduced
in starting and while coming up to speed. This reduced
starting voltage is usually obtained from a starting
compensator (autotransformer) similar to that used in
the starting of an induction motor. 
Autotransformer Starting 
With the autotrans-
former method of starting, the usual practice is to close
the starting contactor first. This connects the stator
to the reduced voltage. When a speed near synchro-
nization has been reached, the starting contactor is
opened and the running contactor is closed, thus con-
necting the motor to the full-line voltage. After syn-
chronous speed has been reached, the field switch is
closed through a moderate amount of resistance. The
field current is now adjusted in order to make the motor
operate at the desired power factor.
Full-Line Voltage Starting
If the motor is to operate
at high starting torque, it is common practice to use a
full-line starting voltage in connection with a time-
delay over-current relay. The relay will operate before
the surge of starting current can damage the motor
windings. Figure 14-4 shows the typical automatic
across-the-line synchronous motor starter. Across-the-
line starting and reduced-voltage starting have already
been discussed. However, the reduced-voltage diagram
is shown in Fig. 14-5. Note how the autotransformers
are switched into the circuit. This method of reduced-
voltage starting uses three switches or contactors. The
two starting switches or contactors are connected to
each side of the autotransformer or compensator and
are both closed at the same time. After the motor
has attained nearly synchronous speed, the starting
switches are opened and the running switch is closed.
This sounds great in theory but is not always successful.
The motor may not become synchronized when it is
supposed to, so you may have to start over again and try
to get it to synchronous speed or use an automatic
method.
238

Elementary diagram of an across-the-line motor
starter.

Reactance Starting
Reactance starting is similar
to the reduced-voltage starting methods, except that
the first step is obtained by reactance in series with the
motor armature instead of autotransformers. In the
reactance method of starting, more current is required
from the line for the same torque on the first step than
when compensators are used. It has one advantage. No
circuit opening is required when the motor is trans-
ferred to running voltage. The transfer is accomplished
by short-circuiting the reactance.
Resistance Starting
A typical circuit using the resis-
tance method of reduced-voltage starting is shown in
Fig. 14-6. Switch 1 is closed first. This connects the
motor to the line through the entire resistance. Switches
2, 3, and 4 are then closed, with a time interval between
each closing. Each switch, in turn, short circuits a part
of the resistance. This method of starting is sometimes
used when power company rulings require several pro-
gressive steps of starting current.
Korndorfer Starting
The reactance and resistance
methods are similar to starting the motor using the
Korndorfer method. It permits the motor to be started

without opening the motor circuit. The motor is first
connected through suitable taps of a compensator, and
then started by connecting the compensator to the line.
Full voltage is connected by first opening the neutral of
the starting compensator. This allows the motor to run
with part of the compensator winding in series with the
motor. Then the entire compensator winding is short
circuited (Fig. 14-7).
Switch 1 is closed first. This connects one of the
compensator windings to the line. Then switch 2 is
closed, completing the motor circuit at reduced volt-
age. As the motor increases its speed, a timing relay,
operated by switch 2, opens the circuit of 3. This, in
turn, opens the transformer neutral. Switch 4 is closed
next. This connects the motor to full-line voltage by
shorting the compensator sections. By opening switch 2,
the reduced-voltage taps of the compensator are dis-
connected and the permanent running connection to the
motor is completed.
Other Methods of Starting
An auxiliary prime
mover, usually an induction motor, may be used as a
starter. This method of starting is applied to the motors
that have no squirrel-cage winding, or it is used with
alternators converted to motor use. This type of motor
cannot start under load.
Speed Regulation by Resistance
Resistors can be used to regulate the speed if they are
of the proper size to prevent overheating from constant
use. The resistors used in starting are used only for a
short time, but those used for continuous motor speed
reduction are in use for longer periods of time. This
means that a resistor must be selected for its intended
purpose.
DC motors produce the most effective variable
speed outputs. However, wound-rotor motors, because
Uses for Synchronous Motors
Synchronous motors may be used for power factor cor-
rection; for constant-speed, constant-load drives; and
for voltage regulation. Because of the higher efficiency
possible with synchronous motors, they can be used
advantageously on most loads where constant speed is
required. Typical applications are compressors, fans,
blowers, line shafts, centrifugal pumps, rubber and paper
mills, and to drive dc generators.
WOUND-ROTOR MOTORS
The wound-rotor motor differs from the squirrel-cage
type. It has wire-coil windings in its rotor instead of a
series of conducting bars in the rotor. Inserting external
resistance in the motor circuit when starting will
develop a high torque with a comparatively low start-
ing current. As the motor comes up to speed, the resis-
tance is gradually removed until, at full speed, the
rotor is short-circuited. Speed can be regulated, within
limits, by varying the amount of resistance in the rotor
circuit (Fig. 14-8).
240

motor starter.

Wiring diagram with resistor connections. 

However, some resistance can be left in the circuit
to aid in speed control, that is, of course, if the size
(wattage rating) of the resistors is such as to withstand
the constant current flow through them. By placing a
high resistance in the rotor circuit, it is possible to start
the motor and have it produce high starting torque with
low starting current.
Types of Speed Control
The wound-rotor motor can be used where the speed
range is small, where the speeds desired do not coin-
cide with a synchronous speed of the line frequency,
and where the speed must be gradually or frequently
changed from one value to another. This includes com-
pressors, pulverizers, stokers, and conveyors.
A smooth, no-jerk start can be obtained by using
the wound-rotor motor. It is simply a matter of supply-
ing the right control equipment.
Multiswitch Starters
Figure 14-10 shows how a typical multiswitch starter
for a wound rotor is wired into the rotor circuit. This
type of starter is used in the secondary circuits of large
wound-rotor induction motors up to 2000 hp with rotor
currents up to 1000 A. Contact levers are of the double-
pole type and are mechanically arranged in such a
manner that they must be closed in a predetermined
sequence, and only one at a time. Since the switches
are designed for hand-over-hand operation, a desirable
time element is introduced that prevents too-rapid
acceleration of the motor. When the final switch has
been closed, it is held in place by a magnetic coil, and
because of the mechanical interlocking feature, all
of their adjustable rotor resistance, are one of the few
means of speed control available for ac motors.
Wound-rotor motors are just that—they have a wound
rotor. They are insulated coils of wire that are not per-
manently short circuited, as in the squirrel-cage motor,
but are connected in regular succession to form a defi-
nite polar area having the same number of poles as the
stator. The ends of these rotor windings are brought out
to collector rings, usually referred to as slip rings.
Currents induced in the rotor are carried by means of
slip rings (and carbon brushes riding on the slip rings) to
an externally mounted resistance (Fig. 14-9). These resis-
tances can then be regulated or changed according to the
needs of the start sequence. By changing the resistance
in the rotor circuit it is possible to change the speed of
the motor. Once it has come up to synchronous speed the
resistors are then short circuited and the motor runs with
characteristics similar to a squirrel-cage type.

other switches remain closed. This type of starter is just
that—a starter, it is not useful as a speed regulator.
Drum Controllers
Drum controllers can be used for starting and for
speed control of the wound-rotor motor (Fig. 14-11).
Drum controllers are made to handle both stator and
rotor circuits. The cylinder mounting the contact seg-
ments are built in two insulated sections. When they
are built to handle the rotor circuit, only the stator
circuit is controlled by a circuit breaker or line
starter. In addition to starting and regulating, speed-
regulation drum collectors are commonly used for
speed-reversing duty as well.
Motor-driven controllers are used in certain dri-
ves requiring close automatic speed regulation such
as in large air-conditioning plants, blowers, stokers,
and similar applications. Some of these installations
have been in use for a number of years and are gradu-
ally being replaced by more modern motor control
methods.
Magnetic Starters
Magnetic starters are built to regulate motor speed,
start the motor, and to set the speed of the motor. They
consist of a magnetic contactor for connecting the
stator circuit to the line, and one or more accelerating
contactors to commutate the resistance in the rotor cir-
cuit. The number of secondary accelerating contactors
varies with the rating, a sufficient number being used to
assure smooth acceleration and to keep the inrush cur-
rent within practical limits. The operation of the accel-
erating contactors is controlled by a timing device,
which provides definite time acceleration. For high-
voltage service, the primary contactor is usually of the
oil-immersed type. The diagram of a typical magnetic
starter for use with a wound-rotor induction motor is
shown in Fig. 14-12.
Resistors
Generally, the secondary resistors for wound-rotor
induction motors are designed for star connection.
Resistors for most manual controllers may be con-
nected with all three secondary phases closed or with
one secondary phase open on the first point of the con-
troller. Resistors for magnetic controllers are con-
nected with all three phases closed in the secondary on
the first point. The torque obtained with a resistor of a
given class number varies with the connection used on
the first point of the controller.
Keep in mind that wound-rotor motors can be started
with a load and without drawing too much current.

FREQUENCY SPEED CONTROL
Solid-state ac motor control is accomplished by chang-
ing the frequency of the power source. Westinghouse’s
Accutrol line is an adjustable-speed ac drive package
in ratings from 1 to 5 hp at 230 V and 3 to 250 hp at
460 V, three-phase, 60 Hz (Fig. 14-13).
Motor speed is adjusted by controlling the output
voltage and frequency of the unit. This is accomplished
They can be used for such loads as those with back
pressures set up by fluids and gases, as in reciprocat-
ing pumps and compressors. They are also used in
elevators and cranes. They do, however, have some
disadvantages.
Disadvantages are the initial cost since they do
require a wound rotor. The slip rings and brushes do
need maintenance from time to time. Resistors and the
switching arrangements require periodic inspection and
maintenance.
Solid-State Adjustable-Speed
Controllers
Solid-state adjustable-speed controllers are available to
produce smooth starts and energy savings. They are, in
most instances, maintenance free and are easy to oper-
ate and make it simple to train new operators.
The reason for using solid-state adjustable-speed
controllers is because they provide step-less, smooth
adjustable-speed control of the ac wound-rotor motor.
This means the elimination of resistors, liquid rheostats,
and reactors as well as magnetic clutches. They all con-
sume energy that is not the case with the solid-state
controller. The solid-state circuitry is used to provide
the excitation to the rotor. By controlling the rotor cur-
rent it is possible to control the motor speed and
thereby its torque.
Frequency Speed Control

by rectifying the incoming ac supply voltage and chang-
ing it to dc. The dc voltage is inverted by a three-phase
inverter section to an adjustable frequency output
whose voltage is adjusted proportionately to the fre-
quency to provide constant volts per hertz excitation to
the motor terminals up to 60 Hz. Above 60 Hz, the volt-
age may remain constant at rated volts. In this way
energy-efficient low-loss speed control is obtained in
the range 2 to 120 Hz.
This type of speed control does have advantages
over dc machines inasmuch as the dc motors are hard
to maintain and have problems in environments that are
wet, corrosive, or explosive. These controls are found
in food-packing plants, dairies, chemical plants, sand
and gravel plants, paper mills, and cement plants. Cen-
trifugal pumps and blowers are particularly suited for
use with this type of control, as considerable reduction
in energy consumption can be achieved by varying the
speed to control the flow of gas or fluids instead of
using throttling devices such as valves, dampers, or
fluid recirculators.
MULTISPEED STARTERS
Multispeed starters are designed for the automatic con-
trol of two-speed squirrel-cage motors of either the con-
sequent-pole or separate-winding types (Fig. 14-14).
These starters are available for constant horsepower,
constant-torque or variable-torque, three-phase motors
(Fig. 14-15). Multi-speed motor starters are commonly
used on machine tools, fans, flowers, refrigeration com-
pressors, and many other types of equipment.
SPEED MONITORING
Speed sensing a switch can be used to sequence con-
veyors where it is necessary for one conveyor to be
running at nearly full speed before a second conveyor
is started. The switch can also be used to indicate
which direction material on a conveyor is moving from
the rotation of a suitable driven shaft.
The electronic speed switch is a rugged, self-con-
tained, rotary shaft-speed detector (Fig. 14-16). If the
shaft speed exceeds or falls below an adjustable, preset
value, the speed switch detects the change and actuates
external relays, audible alarms, or warning lamps.

of the machine it powers. Then, of course, as the
motor is used, it is also abused. This means that it
must be protected if it is to run properly and for long
periods of time as needed for any given purpose.
Keep in mind that not all motors are meant to be
variable-speed motors. Some are made to run at a
constant speed.
Motors must be started, stopped, reversed, and the
speed must be controlled. They are also jogged, plugged,
and in some instances stopped rather quickly. All these
operations require equipment and circuitry to accom-
plish the job correctly without damage to the motor.
This chapter covers these operations and the equip-
ment needed to cause proper operation of an electric
motor under varying load conditions.
MANUAL STARTERS
Manual starters (Fig. 15-1) provide full-line voltage
starting, reliable thermal overload protection, as well
as undervoltage protection. Typical applications are on
woodworking machinery, metal sawing machines, and
many other machine tools where undervoltage protec-
tion is needed to meet safety standards. By removing
jumper A, a remote emergency stop operator may be
wired to the vacated terminals. Note how the pilot light
is wired in the circuit so that the light is on when the
motor is energized. Three-phase operation using the
same type of starter is shown in Fig. 15-2. The pushbut-
ton wiring is shown in Fig. 15-3. Note how the wiring
diagram and the elementary diagram differ but con-
tain the same information. The elementary diagram
shows how the pilot device is energized. The M
shown in the diagram represents the contactor coil that
will close the contacts in the three-phase lines to the
motor when energized. A complete circuit for energiz-
ing the coil is provided by pressing the start button.

MOTOR CONTROL
Controlling a motor can be a simple task or it can be
complicated, depending on the needs of the machine
that is powered by the motor. Motors are incorpo-
rated into many machines. This makes it necessary
for the motor to be controlled according to the needs

must be removed from all but one of the start-stop sta-
tions used.
Low-voltage protection is a method of protecting an
operator from injury from automatic restart of a machine
upon resumption of voltage after a power failure. This is
normally accomplished with a magnetic starter with
three-wire control. This protection can be had with stan-
dard manual starters (Fig. 15-6). The low-voltage fea-
ture is accomplished by a continuous-duty solenoid
assembly built into the overload relay mechanism. When a

249
A variation on the standard start-stop starter is
shown in Fig. 15-4, where the three-phase starter is
used with a single-phase motor. Figure 15-5 is a varia-
tion that is used with a three-phase motor. It provides
more than one start-stop station. The elementary dia-
gram shows how the start buttons are in parallel with
the contacts of the starter M coil. This is a useful
arrangement when a motor must be started and stopped
from any of several widely separated locations. Using
this particular circuitry, it is also possible to use only
one start-stop station and have several stop buttons at
different locations to serve as emergency stops.
Standard-duty start-stop stations are provided with
connections A shown in Fig. 15-5. This connection

power failure occurs or the line voltage is disconnected,
the solenoid will de-energize and mechanically open the
starter contacts. When power is restored, the starter must
be manually reset before the contacts can be closed and
normal operation resumed.
Low-voltage protection is required by OSHA
1910.213b3 and 1910.217b8iii on certain woodwork-
ing machines and all mechanical power presses. NFPA
79 Section 130-21 requires it on certain metalworking
machines. Some local safety regulations have extended
it to other applications, such as mixers, conveyors, or
wherever operator safety could be in jeopardy.
SOLID-STATE MOTOR
CONTROLLER
It is possible to obtain the advantages of solid-state
electronics in motor controllers. In fact, an entire chap-
ter is dedicated to the programmable controller and its
advantages and uses. In this chapter, however, the
smaller microcomputer-controlled starters for standard
squirrel-cage induction motors are highlighted.
Allen-Bradley makes the smart motor controller
(SMC), which has a soft-start, current limiting, and
full-voltage starting. Three modes are possible with the
same controller: the soft start, current limit, and full
voltage (Fig. 15-7).

controlled starting. (Allen-Bradley)
Soft Start
This method has the most general appli-
cation. The motor voltage gradually increases during
the acceleration ramp period. The ramp period can be
adjusted from 2 to 30 seconds. Then the user sets it
for the best starting performance over the required
load range.
Current Limit
This starting mode is used when it is
necessary to limit the maximum starting current. The
current limit is adjusted according to the starting cur-
rent restriction. This can be adjusted for 200 to 450%
of full-load amperes.
Full Voltage
For applications requiring a full-load
start, the acceleration ramp time is set to a minimum of
0.25 second. This, in effect, allows the controller to
start the load across-the-line.
Solid-state electronics have been utilized success-
fully in the production of motor controls. In time, they
will probably replace the electromechanical devices.
However, the cost of the electronic devices will con-
tinue to decrease with better circuitry and more com-
petition. Older machines will be retrofitted with the
newer electronics. Some packages are already avail-
able to be attached to existing setups.

starters arranged for sequence control of a conveyor
system. The two starters are wired so that M2 cannot
be started until M1 is running. This is necessary if M1
is driving a conveyor fed by another conveyor driven
by M2. Material from M2 conveyor would pile up if
the M1 conveyor could not move and carry it away.
If a series of conveyors is involved, the control cir-
cuits of the additional starters can be interlocked in the
SEQUENCE CONTROL
In some applications it is necessary to make sure that
one starter is not operational until the other has been
energized. This type of use is found in equipment that
may have the need for high-pressure lubrication or with
hydraulic pumps.
These auxiliary devices have to be operational
before the machine is turned on. Figure 15-8 shows the

same way. That is, M3 would be connected to M2 in
the same step arrangement that M2 is now connected to
M1, and so on.
The M1 button, stop button, or an overload on M1
will stop both conveyors. The M2 stop button or an
overload on M2 will stop only M2.
WHEN STARTING ANY ONE
REQUIRES ANOTHER
Several motors can be run independently of each other
with some of the starters actuated by two-wire and
some by three-wire pilot devices. Whenever any one of
these motors is running, a pump or fan motor must also
run (Fig. 15-9).
A master start-stop pushbutton station with a con-
trol relay is used to shut down the entire system in an
emergency. Control relay (CR) provides three-wire
control for M1, which is controlled by a two-wire con-
trol device such as a pressure switch. Motors M2 and
M3 are controlled by start-stop pushbutton stations.
Auxiliary contacts on M1, M2, and M3 control
M4. These auxiliary contacts are all wired in parallel so
that any one of them may start M4. On some starters,
auxiliary contacts have been added to M2 and M3 for
this purpose. The standard hold-in contact on M1 may
be used as an auxiliary if wire Y is removed. Hold-in
contacts are not required when a two-wire control
device is used.
When this system is used, the phase connections
on all of the starters must be the same. That is, L1 of
each starter must be connected to the same incoming
phase line; L2 and L3 of each starter must be phased
out similarly.
Automatic Sequence Control
Having automatic sequence control is also possible
with the arrangement shown in Fig. 15-10. In this system
it is desired to have a second motor start automatically
when the first one is stopped. The second motor is to
252

When Starting Any One Requires Another  
253

Sequence control diagrams. (Allen-Bradley)

run only for a given length of time. A good application
of this might be found where the second motor is
needed to run a cooling fan or a pump after the first
motor has stopped.
To accomplish this, an off-delay timer (TR) is
used. When the start button is pressed, it energizes
both M1 and TR. This operation of TR closes its time-
delay contact, but the circuit to M2 is kept open by the
opening of the instantaneous contact. As soon as the
stop button is pressed, both M1 and TR are dropped
out. This closes the instantaneous contact on TR and
starts M2. M2 will continue to run until TR times out
and the time-delay contact opens.
JOGGING
Jogging, or inching, is defined by NEMA as the
momentary operation of a motor from rest for the pur-
pose of accomplishing small movements of the driven
machine. One method of jogging is shown in Fig. 15-11.
The selector switch disconnects the holding circuit
interlock and jogging may be accomplished by press-
ing the start button.
There are several means of accomplishing the jog-
ging operation. Figure 15-12 shows how jogging is
done using a control relay. Pressing the start button
energizes the control relay that in turn energizes the

the selector pushbutton gives normal three-wire control.
In the jog position, the holding circuit is broken and the
jogging is accomplished by pressing the button.
Forward or Reverse Jogging
Jogging in the forward or reverse direction is possible
if the wiring shown in Fig. 15-14 is followed. This
control scheme permits jogging the motor either in
the forward or reverse direction, whether the motor is
starter coil. The normally-open starter interlock and
relay contact then form a holding circuit around the
start button. However, pressing the jog button ener-
gizes the starter coil independent of the control relay
and no holding circuit forms. Then jogging can be
obtained simply by pushing the jog button and releas-
ing it independent of the start button.
Jogging can also be accomplished by using a selec-
tor pushbutton. The use of a selector pushbutton to
obtain jogging is shown in Fig. 15-13. In the run position

at a standstill or is rotating in either direction. Press-
ing  the start-forward or start-reverse buttons ener-
gizes the corresponding starter coil, which in turn
closes the circuit to the control relay. The relay picks
up and completes the holding circuit around the start
button. As long as the relay is energized, either the
forward or reverse contactor will remain energized.
Pressing either jog button will de-energize the relay,
releasing the closed contactor. Further pressing of the
jog button permits jogging in the desired direction.
PLUGGING
Plugging is defined by the NEMA as a system of braking
in which the motor connections are reversed so that the
motor develops a countertorque. Thus it exerts a retarding
force. In the scheme shown in Fig. 15-15 the motor is run
in one direction only and must come to a complete stop
when the stop button is pressed. The reverse contactor of
the reversing switching is used only for plug stopping
and not for running in reverse. The lockout solenoid is
built into some of the speed switches and its function is to
guard against an accidental turn of the motor shaft, closing
the speed switch contacts and starting the motor. This
protective feature is optional and the speed switch can be
furnished without lockout solenoid if desired.
Plugging a Motor to Stop 
from Either Direction
With the system shown in Fig. 15-16, the motor can be
started in either direction by pressing the proper but-
ton. Pressing the stop button will plug the motor to stop
from either direction. A standard reversing switch is
used for this purpose.
The lockout solenoid is a built-in part of the speed
switch and it guards against an accidental turn of the
motor shaft closing the speed switch contacts and start-
ing the motor. The control relay and the pushbutton sta-
tion are standard parts.
Antiplugging
Antiplugging protection is defined by NEMA as the effect
of a device that operates to prevent application of counter-
torque by the motor until the motor speed has been
reduced to an acceptable value. With the motor operating
256

Electronic Motor Brake
The electronic motor brake made by Square D provides
a simple, effective means of braking an ac squirrel-
cage motor (Fig. 15-18). It can be used for woodwork-
ing machines such as saws and sanders, and for
machine tools such as lathes and drills, as well as for
conveyor systems, textile machinery, and centrifuges.
Heating, venting, and air-conditioning fans and many
other machines in varied industries may also use this
type of braking.
The major advantages of the electronic methods
versus the mechanical brake system are:
• No friction, wear, or maintenance  
• Adjustable soft-stop capability
in one direction, as shown in Fig. 15-17, a contact on the
antiplugging switch opens the control circuit of the con-
tactor used for the opposite direction. This contact will not
close until the motor has slowed down, after which the
other contactor can be energized. In this schematic the
motor can be reversed, but it must not be plugged.
BRAKING
Electric motors can be brought to a stop or braked
both electrically and mechanically. In some instances
it is necessary to use a combination of both. This usu-
ally happens when the motor is connected to a load
that is not easily stopped or cannot be disconnected
easily.

Electronic motor brake. (Square D)

The electronic motor brake is designed such that
the braking contactor closes before the thyristor (SCR)
switches the braking current on. The contactor will not
open until after the braking current has been switched
off. This allows the braking contactor to be rated for
current-carrying capacity only and not for the higher
make-and-break duty.
An additional circuit detects when the motor has
come to a halt, switches off the braking current, and
permits the motor to restart. No braking time adjust-
ment is required. The maximum braking time is factory
preset at 10 seconds. Braking torque is adjustable by
use of a single potentiometer. This is an ideal braking
system for jobs where there is a variable load and for
multispeed three-phase motors.
Mechanical Braking
Electric motors can also be stopped when necessary
by using a mechanical means. These are similar to what
is used with automobiles. Some of them rely on an elec-
tric current to energize the solenoid to cause the brake
shoes to tighten around the motor shaft and stop it.
Reliance makes an electromechanical brake for
motors up to 10 hp and 3600 rpm (Fig. 15-20). It has
friction disks that are self-resetting with a manual
release lever. The magnet coils are encapsulated to pro-
tect them from dirt and moisture. Antirattle springs are
incorporated to reduce vibration and noise.
• No mechanical connection to the motor shaft 
• Multimotor braking capability
• Easily wired to a new or existing machinery 
• Unaffected by hostile motor environment
Electronic braking is commonly known as
dynamic braking. Dynamic braking of an ac induction
motor is generally accomplished by exciting its stator
windings with dc current. The amount of braking
torque is directly proportional to the dc current passing
through the stator windings of the motor (Fig. 15-19).
Braking  
259
Fig. 15-19
Wiring diagram for electronic motor brake. (Square D)
Fig. 15-20
Electromechanical brakes. (Reliance)
Dynamic braking of a motor may cause threaded
fasteners connected to the motor shaft to loosen, due to
the reverse torque applied. Use positive-locking fasten-
ers or fastening compound to prevent such loosening.
Note: Electronic motor brakes will not stop
the motor if power is lost or disconnected.
This type of electronic motor brake can be used to
stop a load and signal a mechanical brake system to
hold it. In addition, the brake will interface with either
jogging, reversing, multispeed, or reduced-voltage
motor starter applications.
In some instances it is necessary to have a mechan-
ical brake since dynamic braking is not sufficient to stop
the motor rotation completely after power is removed.
These brakes may be actuated whenever power is
removed from the motor circuit. An electromagnet
holds brake shoes away from the motor shaft whenever
the motor is energized. Once power has been removed
the brake is automatically applied by spring action
(Fig. 15-21). This type of braking is very useful in ele-
vators and similar installations.

Thruster Brakes
Thruster brakes are used with ac or dc motors and pro-
vide a smoothly applied fixed torque for hold or for
stopping (Fig. 15-22). They are used on crane travel
drives, lift bridges, conveyors, and similar applica-
tions to reduce load sway, and affect loading to motors
and the mechanical system. These brakes are released
by a thruster mechanism. This self-contained mecha-
nism contains an ac square-cage motor and hydraulic
pump. When de-energized, the brake sets smoothly as
the pumping action ceases.
Magnetic Brakes
Brakes are selected by the amount of torque required
for the particular application. Generally, the full-
load torque of the motor is used as a basis for deter-
mining the brake torque required. This can be
calculated by using the following formula for both
ac and dc motors:
Depending on the characteristics of the drive,
the braking torque required may be more or less
than the full-load torque of the motor. In addition to
being selected to meet the torque requirements of
the particular application, the magnetic brake used
for stopping must be selected to prevent overheating
of the brake wheel when operated on the anticipated
duty cycle.

backspin are both present in pumps and must be con-
sidered in the circuitry design of the starters.
Surge Protection and Backspin
Surge protection and “backspin” are two of the factors
to be considered when protecting motor used to power
pumps. Surge protection is often necessary when the
pump is turned off and the long column of water is
stopped by a check valve. The force of the sudden stop
may cause surges that operate the pressure switch con-
tacts, subjecting the starter to chattering.
Figure 15-25 shows how the system provides pro-
tection on both starting and stopping. Backspin is
included automatically. Two-timing relays are used
here, one to provide surge protection on starting and
one to provide surge protection on stopping and back-
spin protection. TR1 is an on-delay tuner used for
surge protection on starting. When the pressure switch
contact closes, relay CR, the starter and two timers are
energized. The instantaneous contact on TR1 closes,
bypassing the pressure switch contact and preventing
the pump motor starter from dropping out even though
starting surges open the pressure contact. After the tim-
ing period, the time-delay contact TR1 opens the
bypass and pressure switch (PS) can then stop the
pump at the proper pressure. TR2 is an off-delay timer
for surge protection on stopping and backspin protec-
tion. Once turned off the system cannot be operated
again until timer TR2 has timed out and its normally
closed contact is closed.
Hydraulic Brakes
Hydraulic brakes are used with ac or dc motors to
provide an operator-controlled infinitely adjustable
torque for slowing and stopping. These are used on
crane travel drives, mill machines, conveyors, and
similar jobs. They are spring released, hydraulically
applied shoe-type friction brakes designed to meet
American Iron and Steel Engineers (AISE) standards
for mounting. The standard brake includes corrosion-
resistant hardware and grease fittings (Fig. 15-23).
Figure 15-24 shows the typical piping diagram for
one brake.

MOTOR PROTECTION
Motor protection can take many forms, inasmuch as
various types of motors are used to drive many types of
machines. One of the most commonly used motor
applications is to drive pumps. Surge protection and

Another system that provides backspin protec-
tion and surge protection on stopping is shown in
Fig. 15-26. It also has time delay between pressure
switch closing and motor starting. The pressure
switch energizes the timer (TR), but the motor cannot
start until the time-delay contact has closed. The
timer can thus be set for a time long enough to allow
all surges and backspin to stop.
The dashed lines show how a selector switch can
be added to bypass the pressure switch if necessary.
This is often used for motor testing purposes. It does
not eliminate the time delay, however. If the selector
switch is added, wire A must be removed.
Overload Protection
The overload relay is a manual reset, eutectic alloy,
thermal-type overload device (Fig. 15-27). When coor-
dinated with the proper short-circuit protection, the
overload relay is intended to protect the motor, motor
controller, and power wiring against overheating due to
excessive overcurrents.

Overload relay, eutectic alloy, thermal type. (Allen-Bradley)
The ratchet stud assembly is heated by current
flowing through the heater element. Relay operation
occurs when the temperature of the ratchet and stud
reaches the melting point of the eutectic alloy, freeing
the ratchet stud and opening the NC contact.
To reset the overload relay contact, it is necessary
to press and release the reset operator after the eutectic
alloy has solidified. Approximately 2 minutes are
required for the alloy to solidify.
Automatic Reset Overload Relay
An indirectly heated, automatic reset noncompensated
thermal relay is shown in Fig. 15-28. The temperature-
sensitive unit of this relay is a bimetallic U-shaped strip
that is mechanically coupled to a precision snap-action
switch. The bimetallic strip is heated by the motor cur-
rent that flows through a heater element affixed in close
proximity. As the bimetal is heated, a deflection is pro-
duced in it by the different rates of expansion of the

Line-Voltage Monitor
The line-voltage monitor
detects phase failure, voltage imbalance, phase rever-
sal, and undervoltage (Fig. 15-31A). It provides pre-
start and running protection on the line side of the point
of connection and connects directly to three-phase
lines with a 600-V maximum. It can be used with poten-
tial transformers where line voltage exceeds 600 V. It
has automatic reset and an LED indicates normal volt-
age conditions and energized output relay CR.
two metals. A sustained current, greater than the rating
of the heater element, will develop sufficient deflection
to open the contact of the snap switch.
Inverse Time Current Relay
A magnetically operated inverse time current overload
relay that can be used in the protection of ac or dc
motors is shown in Fig. 15-29. Both the tripping cur-
rent and tripping time are easily adjustable. The relay is
usually supplied with normally-closed contacts and
automatic reset. To prevent relay damage, current
through the relay coil should be interrupted after the
relay trips.

Solid-State, Line-Voltage and
Line-Current Monitor Relays
The line-voltage monitor and line-current monitor are
solid-state devices designed for use in three-phase sys-
tems to protect motors and other loads against abnor-
mal voltage/current conditions. In general, the
line-voltage monitor is applied where prestart protec-
tion and line-side protection are important, whereas the
line-current monitor is applied where line- and load-
side protection is important (Fig. 15-30).

(A) Line-voltage monitor in the circuit; (B) line-
current monitor in the circuit. (Allen-Bradley)

Line-Current Monitor
The line-current monitor
detects phase failure, current imbalance, and phase
reversal. It also provides running protection on the line
and load side of the point of connection when used in a
single single-motor branch circuit. Inputs connect to
standard current transformers (5 A secondary). An
LED indicates that supply voltage is present. The man-
ual reset device also has an LED to indicate normal
current conditions and an energized output relay CR
(Fig. 15-31B). Current imbalance protection is effective
during the motor running period only. Phase failure
and reversal protection is provided during both starting
and running periods.
Programmable Motor Protection

bines sophisticated, comprehensive, and coordinated
motor protection into a modular system (Fig. 15-32).
annunciates an abnormal condition and provides an
output that trips the motor off-line. Alarm and trip con-
tacts can also be used to initiate an orderly shutdown of
the process.
Protective Module
The protective module is the main module in the
system. It has inputs, an annunciator panel, and out-
puts. This module receives inputs from external
potential transformers (for three-phase line voltage)
and current transformers (for three-phase line cur-
rent). These inputs represent a portion of real-time
motor data coming into the device for processing
(Fig. 15-33). The remaining inputs to the protective
module consist of the outputs from the program-
mer/monitor and the remote resistance temperature
detector (RTD) module.
The protective module examines incoming motor
data and compares them to user-preprogrammed limits.
The module then determines if the motor should be
taken off-line. It provides alarm and trip signals, and
visually indicates the abnormality.
Remote Temperature Detector
Module
The remote RTD module serves as a remote tempera-
ture gathering panel. It is a microprocessor-based
device that performs temperature data acquisition and
coordination on demand from the protective module.
The temperature data are used by the protective mod-
ule to help construct a thermal model of the motor cop-
per and iron.
This remote RTD module scans eight RTDs (two
bearing and six winding). It takes an analog signal,
digitizes it, performs a linearization function (to
compensate for nonlinear RTD characteristic), scales
it, and communicates the value to the protective mod-
ule on demand. For motors not having RTDs embed-
ded in the stator windings and bearings, motor
protection can still be provided using just the protec-
tive module.
An optional instrumentation card allows the pro-
grammable motor protection (PMP) to provide a vari-
ety of metering functions (Fig. 15-34).
The following information can be provided:
• Elapsed time running: hours
• Total energy consumption: MWh
• Power factor: lead/lag
• Power: kW

Typically, these motors are medium-voltage (2300 to

By processing incoming data and looking for
trends in various motor parameters, the device can pro-
vide a high degree of coordinated motor protection. It

CHAPTER

The following factors are to be considered in the
operation and control of any motor. These conditions
can cause the motor to be damaged or destroyed.
• Low voltage. The motor tries to do the work, but the
low voltage causes excessive currents that overheat
the motor.
• Heavy-duty load cycles. Constant starting, stopping,
jogging, inching, or plugging overloads the motor.
• Excessive loads. The load is too big for the motor.
• Locked rotor. Motor jams or cannot get running.
• High-inertia load. Motor takes abnormally long time
to accelerate.
• High ambient temperature. The surrounding temper-
ature is high, which heats the motor. Thus the motor
may not be able to handle as big a load safely as in a
lower ambient temperature.
• Single phasing. One of the power lines fails. The
motor will draw higher line current. Two overload
relays with properly sized elements will protect the
motor except in rare cases such as when the motor is
fed by an ungrounded wye-delta supply transformer.
•. Poor ventilation. Motor cannot get cool air to take
away some of the heat (cannot be protected by over-
load (OL) relays).
STARTERS
Simplest Type
The simplest type of three-phase starter is shown in
Fig. 16-1. The wiring diagram shown in Fig. 16-2 makes
it easy to visualize the wiring of the starter. The arma-
ture and crossbar or the overload reset mechanism is
not shown in the wiring diagram since these parts need
not be considered from the wiring standpoint. Note the
location of L1, L2, and L3 at the top of the starter and
T1, T2, and T3 at the bottom. As can be seen here,
overload protection is built into the device.

Three-Phase Controllers
PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter you will be able to:
1. List factors to be considered in the operation and
control of any motor.
2. List the types of three-phase starters.
3. Draw a ladder diagram for the operation of start-
stop jog on a three-phase motor.
4. Describe how to reverse a three-phase motor.
5. List the advantages of solid-state controllers for
three-phase motors.
THE THREE-PHASE MOTOR
The squirrel-cage three-phase motor is highly reliable
and efficient at essentially constant speed and requires
little or no maintenance. Depending on construction, it
may be classified as normal torque, normal starting
current; normal torque, low starting current; high
torque, low starting current; high slip; low starting
torque, normal starting current; low torque, low start-
ing current.
The three-phase squirrel-cage motor can be used in
many different locations and for various applications,
including rotary compressors, machine tools, large fans,
light conveyors, milling machines, agitators, elevators,
hoists, punch presses, centrifugal pumps, and blowers.
It is made in the range 1/2 to 400 hp.
The wound-rotor motor is used where limited
speed control and speed adjustments under fluctuating
load are required. This type of motor is made in the
range of half to several thousand horsepower. It can be
found driving conveyors, fans, lift bridges, cranes,
hoists, and metal rolling mills.
The synchronous motor is made in the range of 20
to several thousand horsepower. It is used for power
factor correction and for exact slow-speed drives and
maximum efficiency on continuous loads above 75 hp.
These motors can be started with comparative ease
with the equipment available today. However, there are
some uses that require special consideration. A con-
troller is something more than just a starter. A starter
causes the motor to start and stop. The controller not
only starts the motor, but it also has the ability (accord-
ing to its intended design) to reverse the motor and to
vary its speed and torque as needed. It is this facet of
motor control that requires special consideration and
slightly different use of electrical circuitry and electro-
mechanical devices. More solid-state devices such as
programmable controllers are being introduced into the
field of control and will require a better grasp of elec-
tronics to be fully understood.

Full-Voltage Reversing Starter
Full-voltage starting with the capability of reversing
the motor calls for a little more complex wiring
(Fig. 16-3). Remember, that to reverse the direction of
the rotation of a three-phase motor it is necessary to
change two of the incoming lines. Note in Fig. 16-4 that
L1 and L3 are reversed when the contacts on the left are
closed. It also means that the contacts in L1, L2, and L3
are opened when the reversing contacts close. L2 is not
switched, so look at the diagram closely to see how the
reversing contacts are directly across the L2 contacts,
indicating that there is no change in this line. Also
notice how the starters are electrically interlocked to
avoid both contactors being closed simultaneously. The
contacts are also mechanically interlocked so that both
cannot be closed at the same time. Normally, L1 and L2
are switched to reverse direction.
Starters  
269
A mechanical interlock and electrical interlocks
are supplied as standard on all reversing starters. Limit
switches can be added to stop the motor at a certain
point in either direction. Connections A and B must be
removed when the limit switches are used.
Start-Stop Jog
The purpose of jogging is to have the motor operate
only as long as the jog button is held down (Fig. 16-6).
The starter must not lock-in during jogging. That is
why the jog relay (CR) is used.
Pushing the start button operates the jog relay.
This causes the starter to lock in through one of the
relay contacts. When the jog button is pressed, the
starter operates, but this time the relay is not energized
and thus the starter will not lock in.

Forward-Reverse-Stop
Standard wiring with the forward-reverse-stop push-
button station is shown in Fig. 16-5. The stop button
must be pressed before changing direction.

Reversing Starter
Figure 16-7 shows how a manually operated reversing
starter operates. Note the absence of a low-voltage con-
trol circuitry. This means that the contacts are closed,
either to start or to reverse by manually (by hand) set-
ting the contacts. L1 is changed with L3 and L2 just
shorted in the reverse positions with the contacts short-
ing or paralleling the start contacts.
shown in Fig. 16-9. The motor can be started in either
high or low speed. The change from low to high can
be made without first pressing the stop button. How-
ever, when changing from high to low, the stop but-
ton must be pressed between speeds.

Two-Speed Starter
A two-speed starter for a motor with separate wind-
ings for low and high speeds resembles that shown in
Fig. 16-8. As the situation becomes more demand-
ing, it is necessary to wire up motors to do various
things under different conditions. A typical connec-
tion for a two-speed separate winding motor is

used for squirrel-cage, reduced-voltage, nonreversing
reactor controller, and part B is used for synchronous
reduced-voltage, nonreversing autotransformer and reac-
tor controllers.
Full-voltage controllers are used when full starting
torque and resulting inrush current are not objection-
able. One-high construction provides complete isola-
tion for each controller and permits space for adding
optional power and control devices. Figure 16-12 shows
how the squirrel-cage, full-voltage, nonreversing motor
is controlled. Note the three fuses used for current limit-
ing and the three current transformers plus the bridge
circuit made up of diodes.
Figure 16-13 shows a feeder disconnect circuit.
Feeder disconnect controllers use mechanically held
contactors that remain closed on loss of power. They
are opened by use of a manual-trip pushbutton or an
optional electrical solenoid release. Feeder disconnect
controllers are available with either vacuum or air
brake contactors of the bolted or draw-out design.
These controllers are used frequently to disconnect
transformers and in transfer schemes in place of metal-
clad circuit breakers or disconnect switches.
A full-voltage, squirrel-cage, reversing controller
is shown in Fig. 16-14. These controllers are used to
control motors being operated in forward and reverse
directions, where full starting torque and resulting
inrush current are not objectionable to the motor.
Reversing controllers are available with either vacuum
or air-break contactors.
The squirrel-cage, reduced-voltage motor using an
autotransformer is shown in its controller configuration
in Fig. 16-15. These controllers provide maximum
torque with a minimum of line current while providing
taps to permit torque and line current to be varied. Vac-
uum or air-break contactors are available.
The reduced-voltage, primary reactor, squirrel-
cage motor controller permits the starting of motors
without the high inrush currents and voltage variations
DUPLEX MOTOR CONTROLLERS
The controller operates first one motor and then the
other on each successive closing of pilot device A.
(Fig. 16-10). When pilot device B closes, both motors
are energized. Typical applications include pump motors,
where a second pump is required for peak demand
periods. For this application, both pilot devices may be
float or pressure switches and B is set to operate after A
and only if both pumps are required.
Medium-Voltage Controllers  
271

Fig. 16-11
Medium-voltage controllers. (Square D)
Both pilot devices must be two-pole, but B can be
omitted if only alternation is required and both motors
are never required to run simultaneously. If one motor
is running and its disconnect switch is opened, an over-
load relay trips, or the starter is de-energized for any
reason, the other motor will automatically be started.
MEDIUM-VOLTAGE
CONTROLLERS
Medium voltage usually refers to the range from 2200 to
7200 V. This higher voltage range calls for protection for
those who work around the equipment. Larger cabinets
are needed to contain all the devices utilized in the con-
trol of these higher-horsepower motors. Figure 16-11
shows the housing for two of the controllers. Part A is

are used with motors where constant speed and plant
power factor correction are desired. Some typical
industrial applications are pulp and paper mills, lumber

sors, centrifugal fans, blowers, generators, crushers,

Controller for synchronous, reduced-voltage, primary reactor motors. (Square D)
The primary reactor synchronous motor controllers
are used for drives where maximum efficiencies are
required and when full starting torque and resulting
inrush current are objectionable to the system. Further,
these controllers are used where constant speed and
plant power-factor correction are desired (Fig. 16-20).
SOLID-STATE MOTOR
CONTROLLER
The Bulletin 2050 controller made by Allen-Bradley pro-
vides controlled current (torque) starting of squirrel-cage
motors from 30 to 1200 hp rated at 208 through 575 V ac
at 50/60 Hz. These controllers are used on applications
such as conveyors, pumps, compressors, and various
other loads where minimum shock starting and smooth
step-less acceleration is required (Fig. 16-21). Three
acceleration modes are provided; current ramp, constant
current, and linear timed.
Current Ramp
This method has the most general
application. During acceleration, a low initial current is
gradually increased to a limiting-start current value.
Smooth starting and optimum performance are
achieved by adjusting the acceleration ramp time (rate
of current increase). In most cases no other adjust-
ments are required.
Constant Current
This is a variation of the current
ramp method, used where the principal requirement is
to limit the starting current. With the acceleration ramp
time set at minimum, the start current limit is adjusted
in accordance with starting current restrictions.
Linear Timed Acceleration
For applications requiring
a controlled acceleration time or linear rate of speed
increase, the controller can be set up for linear timed
acceleration. A tachometer is installed on the motor and
provides a feedback signal that is used by the controller

power module and logic module with mounting plate; (B) 200-hp

to increase the motor speed linearly with time, according
to the acceleration ramp potentiometer setting.
Modules
The controller consists of modules. The power module
contains three power pole assemblies, each having
back-to-back SCRs with single-bolt clamping. The
power poles share a single heat sink/base and cooling
fan. See Fig. 16-22 for a block diagram of the combi-
nation controller with some of the options marked with
an asterisk.
The logic module can be mounted on the front of
the power module or it can be mounted separately.
External features include diagnostic LEDs, a terminal
strip connecting the control devices, and the accelera-
tion ramp adjustment potentiometer.
The energy-saver module is an option. It can
reduce operating costs by reducing the motor power
losses. It is recommended for certain applications, such
as where motors run unloaded for long periods. It can
be installed within the logic module.
Solid-State Advantages
There are a few advantages claimed for solid-state
controllers as opposed to electromechanical types.
The main advantage is maintenance. Inasmuch as
there are no moving parts such as contacts, there is

little call for cleaning and adjusting them. It is possi-
ble to incorporate voltage regulation, transient sup-
pression, and snubber circuits for protection against
changes in temperature and changes in voltage. It is
also possible to incorporate into the circuitry shorted
SCR and open-phase protection. Phase-reversal
detection is possible as well as protection against
startup in an incorrect sequence. Over-current pro-
tection can also be designed for protection in various
operating modes.
MOTOR CONTROL CENTERS
As technology becomes more complex, integrated
control equipment is becoming more in demand. There
is a decided advantage to integrating all control and
power requirements into one centralized package. It
can be pre-engineered, pre-wired, and fully tested
before it is delivered, thereby saving time not only in
installation but in testing.
Motor control centers are used in a wide variety of
industrial and commercial applications, such as pulp
and paper mills, sawmills, building products, food
processing, can plants, wastewater treatment plants,
coal and bulk handling, chemical plants, and oil and
gas production, to name but a few. In other words, it
can be used wherever three-phase motors are used
(Fig. 16-23).

The control center shown in Fig. 16-23 houses a
three-phase 600-V rated bus network that distributes
power to various vertical sections. The main horizontal
bus is located in the center of the section. This provides
better heat dissipation and power distribution and makes
the main bus accessible from floor level for easier and
safer maintenance. The center-fed 300-A rated vertical
bus supplies power to individual units above and below
the horizontal bus for effective 600-A capacity, provid-
ing virtually unrestricted unit arrangement.
Different sizes and ratings of units with varying
degrees of complexity are available depending on the
horsepower and voltage of the motor and its particular
control requirements. Standard units are available to
handle basic starting-stopping-reversing, multi-speed,
and reduced-voltage starting applications. Motor control
centers are not only used to house basic control devices;
they are used to package solid-state technology.
Programmable controllers, adjustable-frequency dri-
ves, solid-state reduced-voltage starters, and solid-state
protective devices represent the kind of technology that
is integrated into today’s motor control centers.

the existing methods.
In addition, adjustable-frequency drives offer a
distinct advantage over other forms of variable-speed

Industry is constantly striving to find controls that will
increase productivity and reduce energy costs. This striving
has about ceased, inasmuch as electronics has taken over
and produced the desired results. However, many electro-
mechanical devices are still in use and will be for many
years. It is both of these worlds—electromechanical and
electronic—that we discuss in this chapter.
The ac induction motor is the mainstay for energy
conversion in the United States. It is found in industry,
in commerce, and in the home. Our lifestyle would be
unimaginable without it. It is the major converter of
electrical energy into another usable form. For this
purpose, about two-thirds of the electrical energy pro-
duced is fed to motors.
FANS, BLOWERS, AND PUMPS
Fans, blowers, and pumps consume much of the electri-
cal energy to operate the ac motors that power them. It
has been estimated that approximately 50% of the
motors in use today are attached to these types of loads.
Fans, blowers, and pumps are particularly attractive to
look at for energy savings. Several other methods of
control for fans and pumps have been advanced recently
that show energy savings over traditional methods.
Fans are designed for their maximum load. How-
ever, they do not always operate at maximum capacity.
This means that there is a possibility of energy savings
if the speed of the motor can be changed according to
the load demand. In most instances the outlet dampers
for fans and throttling valves for pumps were used to
control their outputs. However, neither of these con-
trols improved the efficiency of the pump or fan. What
is needed is a control method to adapt fans and pumps
to varying demands that do not decrease the efficiency
of the system as much. Newer methods include direct
variable-speed control of the fan or pump. This method

Variable-speed drives change fan rpm. (Allen-Bradley)
ADJUSTABLE-SPEED DRIVES
There are several types of adjustable-speed drives that
can be used on fans. These include variable-pitch belt
drives, eddy current drives, dc drives, and adjustable-
frequency drives.
ADJUSTABLE-FREQUENCY AC
DRIVES
Adjustable-frequency drives are commonly called
inverters. They are available in a range of horsepower
from fractional to 1000. They are designed to operate
standard induction motors. This allows them to be
added easily to an existing system. The inverters are
often sold separately because the motor may already
be in place (Fig. 17-2).
The basic drive consists of the inverter itself, which
converts the 60-Hz incoming power to a variable fre-
quency and a variable voltage. The variable frequency is

the actual requirement that will control the motor speed.
Three major types of inverter designs are in use today:
current source inverters (CSI), variable-voltage inverters
(VVI), and pulse-width-modulated inverters (PWM).
Keep in mind that ac motor speeds are a function
of frequency and the number of poles:
Variable-Voltage Inverters
281
changes the ac to dc and back to ac again at a different
frequency. It may also be a reshaped waveform when
changed back to ac again for frequency control purposes.
CSI INVERTERS
The CSI inverter controls the current output to the motor.
The actual speed of the motor is sensed by the use of
other circuits. This is then compared to the reference
speed and an error is used to generate a demand for more
or less current to the motor. The output switching devices,
usually SCRs, are switched at the desired frequency to
“steer” the current to the motor. Current source inverters
are available in a wide range of horsepower but most
often are found in the range of 50 hp and above.
This type of inverter is used on a standard induction
motor and is readily available, reliable, and easy to repair.
If the inverter fails, the motor can be operated directly
across the incoming line for continued operation. The
inverter can adapt its operation to prevent overloads
caused by accelerating the high-inertia loads found in
some applications. The current control limits fault cur-
rents that will minimize damage on a major fault or over-
load condition. This inverter may require tachometer
feedback for speed regulation. A tach generator must be
added and is not a standard option for induction motors.
If the tach feedback signal is lost during operation, the
drive may run away to full speed. The inverter has to be
matched to the motor’s electrical characteristics. The
inverter is sensitive to those characteristics, and improper
operation may occur if the motor is replaced with a dif-
ferent type or size.
The inverter design requires the motor to be con-
nected to operate at all. The inverter cannot be run or
tested without the motor. The inverter uses a phase-
controlled rectifier for current control. This method
produces low power factor at low speeds.
The size of the major components usually causes
these inverters to be the largest of the drives in overall
size. All the power delivered to the system may go
through a conversion within the inverter. Large power
devices must be used to handle this.
VARIABLE-VOLTAGE INVERTERS
The variable-voltage inverter controls the voltage and
frequency to the motor to produce variable speed opera-
tion. The distinguishing characteristic between this
type of inverter and the PWM inverter is the scheme
used to control the voltage. VVI inverters control the
voltage in a separate section from the output section
used for frequency generation. Usually, the voltage con-
trol is done using a phase-controlled input bridge recti-
fier circuit at the input of the inverter. The frequency

Synchronous motors will run at the synchronous
speed as determined by the formula. Their speed will not
change with load changes within the pull-out torque
capacity of the motor. An induction motor’s speed-torque
characteristics are shown in Fig. 17-3. Motor output
requirements are dictated by the load. Friction-type loads
such as conveyors require constant torque from the drive
motor. Certain machine tool applications require con-
stant horsepower. Most fans and blowers require variable
torque. Generally, standard ac motors can produce con-
stant torque throughout the speed range with a constant
volts/Hz supply. The converter is adjusted to provide this
supply (Fig. 17-4).
The converter and inverter are two different devices.
The converter changes from ac to dc and the inverter
changes dc to ac, whereas in actual practice the inverter

control is accomplished by an output bridge circuit that
switches the variable voltage to the motor at the desired
frequency. These drives are available from fractional
horsepower to about 500 hp.
The standard induction motor is readily available,
reliable, and easy to repair and can be used with the
VVI inverter. The inverter can achieve efficiencies of
90% at full speed and full load. If the inverter fails, the
motor can still be operated directly across the incoming
line for continued operation. The inverter can adapt its
operation to prevent overloads caused by accelerating
the high-inertia loads found in some applications.
Installation of this type of inverter is simple. Just three
power leads to the motor are used. No tach feedback is
required, and the drive can be located large distances from
the motor being controlled. The drive can be tested and
operated without requiring a motor to be connected. More
than one motor can be operated from the same inverter.
Also, the inverter is not sensitive to changing the combi-
nation of motors operated as long as the total load current
does not exceed the inverter’s rated current.
There are some drawbacks to the VVI inverter. The
initial cost of the inverter system is high. The total power
delivered to the motor must be converted by the inverter.
This requires high-power components within the inverter.
The inverter has a large portion of sophisticated circuits
that require skilled technicians for service.
PULSE-WIDTH-MODULATED
INVERTERS
These inverters accomplish both frequency and voltage
control at the output section of the drive. The output
voltage is always a constant amplitude and by chop-
ping or pulse-width modulation, the average voltage is
controlled (Fig. 17-5). These drives are available from
1 to 1000 hp.
Some of the features of this type of inverter are its
use on induction motors. It has good efficiency, up to
90% at full speed and full load. A diode bridge rectifier
is used to rectify the incoming power. This permits a
good power factor throughout the full operating speed
range of the inverter (Fig. 17-6).
Control and logic functions are integrated onto a
single LSI chip. This chip contains approximately
6300 transistors to perform the complex logic and con-
trol function. The use of this chip actually simplifies
drive construction by reducing the number of electrical
connections needed, thus providing more reliability
and quality.
If the inverter fails, the motor can be operated
directly across the incoming line for continued opera-
tion. The inverter can adapt its operation to prevent
282

overloads caused by accelerating the high inertial
loads found in some applications. No tach is needed,
so there are only three wires to connect. The control
can be operated large distances from the motor.
This type of drive can also be tested without
requiring a motor to be connected. More than one
motor can be operated from the same inverter. Also,
the inverter is not sensitive to changing the combina-
tion of motors operated as long as the total current is
within the rated current limits of the inverter.
Some of the less desirable features of this type of
inverter are its high cost initially and the fact that the
total power delivered to the motor must be converted
by the inverter. This requires high-power components
within the inverter.

much smaller than for other drives, and they need to han-
dle 10% or less of the total power being delivered to the
system. The control circuitry is less sophisticated and
complex than that found in other systems. The eddy current
coupling and the control respond well without overload-
ing when operating high-inertia loads.
However, there are some disadvantages to this type
of drive. Eddy current clutches are not common devices.
On-site repair or even local repair may not be available.
The special clutch does not permit the motor to operate
the load directly. If the mechanical unit or the con-
troller needs repair, the system is down.
The efficiency of the system decreases with speed.
This is due to the output speed being controlled by slip
within the clutch. Tach feedback is required to maintain
speed control. If speed feedback is lost, the drive will go
to full speed. Eddy current clutch brand names include
Louis-Allis’s Adjusto Speed and GE’s Kinatrol.
VARIABLE-PITCH DRIVES
The variable-pitch drive is a method of speed control that
uses the mechanical means of belts and variable pitch
sheaves or pulleys to change speed. The power source is a
standard induction motor. Often these units are enclosed
and have a gear reduction built in for reduced speed
ranges. The horsepower range is generally limited from 5
to 50 hp, with not much available outside that range.
However, the cost is an important factor in this
type of speed control. These systems are among the
lowest-cost methods of achieving variable speed. The
principle of operation is well known and easy to under-
stand, and construction is simple.
The disadvantages are headed by remote control.
This is not an inherent feature of the variable pitch drive.
This is because the drive uses mechanical means to vary
the speed. Electrical control signals must be adapted to
existing mechanical controls. The stress of variable-
speed operation on belts requires periodic checks and the
replacement of belts from time to time. High-inertia
loads may cause problems. This may require over sizing
the drive or custom motors. Special shutdown and startup
procedures may be required to prevent overloading the
motor. Running at constant speed for extended periods of
time may cause grooving in the sheaves. This degrades
speed control and decreases belt life.
WOUND-ROTOR AC MOTOR
DRIVES
Wound-rotor motor drives use a specially constructed
motor to accomplish speed control. The motor rotor is
constructed with windings that are brought out of the
motor through slip rings on the motor shaft. These
It does have some sophisticated circuits that require
skilled technicians to repair or service. However, the use
of large-scale-integrated circuits and microprocessor cir-
cuits permit self-diagnostics that aids in troubleshooting.
Printed circuit board substitution can be done by unskilled
service workers.
EDDY CURRENT DRIVES
The eddy current drives consists of both mechanical and
electronic types. One type is electronic and the other is
mechanical consisting of the eddy current clutch and the
induction motor. The motor runs at constant speed and
provides a source of energy for the clutch. By controlling
the excitation to the clutch, the amount of slip between the
motor and the output shaft can be regulated and the output
speed varied. If the excitation is high, the output speed
increases toward the motor speed. If the excitation is low-
ered, the speed decreases toward zero speed. A given
speed is maintained by balancing the excitation of the
clutch to the load requirement.
Eddy currents are small currents created in the core
when magnetic fields are changed. Eddy currents gener-
ate heat. They flow in the opposite direction to the cur-
rent that induced them. The effect is to resist the flow of
current in the core. Eddy currents can be minimized by
using laminating techniques. Laminating is the building
of an object through use of several layers of material.
When this method is used, each lamination is varnished.
Varnishing insulates the layers from each other, which
increases resistance to eddy currents. Eddy currents in
motors and transformers must be reduced as much as
possible inasmuch as they represent power consumption
for no work accomplished. By varying the excitation to
the clutch in the eddy current drive it is possible to vary
the eddy currents accordingly.
The clutch excitation is controlled by the eddy
current controller. The controller uses high-gain
amplifiers and a closed-loop speed control circuit to
sense the need for clutch excitation. The mechanical
unit has a tachometer generator mounted on the out-
put shaft to provide speed feedback for the controller.
The drive cannot regulate speed without this type of
feedback.
Eddy current drives are available as integral units
with the induction motor mounted or as just the eddy
current coupling alone, which must be connected to an
induction motor. There are also special designs available
for use on vertical pumps. The drives are available from
integral horsepower ratings all the way up to clutches
large enough to handle several thousand horsepower.
Some of the advantages and good features of the eddy
current drives are that the first costs are usually smaller
than for adjustable-frequency drives, the controllers are

283

windings are connected to a controller that places vari-
able resistors in series with the windings. The torque
performance of the motor can be controlled using these
variable resistors. Wound rotor motors are most com-
mon in the range of 300 hp and above.
There are a few advantages to this type of drive. The
initial cost is moderate for the high-horsepower units.
Not all the power need be controlled. That results in a
moderate size and simple controller. The simple con-
struction of the motor and control lends itself to mainte-
nance without the need for a high level of training.
High-inertia loads work well with this type of motor.
However, there are some disadvantages that should
be taken into consideration for this type of drive. The
motor has slip rings and is not readily available. Effi-
ciency suffers at low speeds. The drive usually is lim-
ited to a speed range of 2:1. The speed regulation is
also poor on the fan-type loads.
DC DRIVES
The dc drive technology is the oldest form of electrical
speed control. The drive system consists of a dc motor and
a controller. The motor is constructed with armature and
field windings. Both of these windings require dc excita-
tion for motor operation. Usually, the field winding is
excited with a constant level voltage from the controller.
REGULATED SPEED DRIVES
There are various speed control methods used on dc
motors. One of the simplest is the rheostat. The rheostat
has an effective speed control range of about 4:1 with
poor regulation of motor speed against changes in load
and torque and line voltage. This control method is very
inefficient because of the power dissipated in the rheostat.
Another method, the variable transformer with rec-
tifiers, can run dc motors over a wider speed range (up
to 10:1) at an improved regulation compared to the
rheostat control. It is also more efficient than the rheostat.
The SCR (thyristor) controls have half-wave oper-
ation and characteristics that are similar to the variable
transformer control. However, SCR systems with full-
wave rectification can achieve a 20:1 speed range when
used with IR compensation techniques, that is, pseudo-
closed-loop current sensing techniques.
If a tachometer is used for feedback, true closed
loop feedback control is possible with SCR circuits. A
full-wave or three-phase SCR control may achieve
speed ranges of up to 100:1. Due to the pulsating nature
of SCR control techniques, the speed stability of motors
below 1 hp may not always be good in the lower speed
range, due to the low moment of inertia of the motor
and due to the load. However, in integral-horsepower
machines, excellent speed range can be achieved.
Transistor controllers can handle closed-loop speed
control with a speed range of over 1000:1 and with reg-
ulation better than 1 or 2% based on set speed. Transis-
tor controls have their best operational advantage for
motors up to 1 hp, with some servomotors up to 5 hp.
For smaller motor sizes, a continuous control method is
used, but for motors above 1/3 to 1/2-hp a PWM tech-
nique is the most efficient control method.
OPEN-LOOP CONTROLS
(TRADITIONAL APPROACH)
DC motor speed controls have been around a long time.
Perhaps the oldest and most widely used control for
small dc motors is the series resistor speed control,
shown in Fig. 17-7. The variable resistance is inserted
in series with the armature and field circuit. The control
has good starting characteristics with large torque avail-
able at low speed but has a runaway speed tendency at
small-load torque conditions. This makes the control

useful only for control applications with somewhat
fixed friction conditions.
The shunt motor variable resistor speed control is
shown in Fig. 17-8. Here a series resistor is inserted in
the armature circuit.

speed-torque characteristics are much improved over
variable resistor control characteristics, with a more
uniform speed regulation over a wider speed range.
Figure 17-10 shows how a shunt motor connected
to a variable field resistor operates. The action of this
control circuit is unique in that the motor speed is vari-
able only above the speed it would have without the
field resistor control. This has an undesirable effect in
that the torque constant of the motor will decrease with
increasing resistance insertion (field weakening). The
net effect or result is that the armature current for a
given torque will increase with higher speed. The
motor can easily be overloaded. This control circuit is
used only in unique cases where load conditions are
both predictable and well controlled.
The field winding is excited with a constant volt-
age. When more resistance is inserted in the armature
circuit, speed regulation degenerates. This type of
control works well for constant load torque rather than
for a widely varying torque situation.
Figure 17-9 shows a control that uses a variable
transformer to control the armature voltage of a shunt
motor with constant field excitation. The resulting
In some sophisticated open-loop control methods,
such as the motor-generator armature control shown in
Fig. 17-11, a constant-speed motor drives a generator
with an adjustable control field voltage. The generator
will produce an adjustable voltage that is delivered to
the armature of the motor. The resulting torque-speed
characteristics are improved over those shown in
Fig. 17-8. This is because the regulation is essentially
independent of the speed setting.
This results in superior motor speed control perfor-
mance over any of the methods shown previously.
However, due to the cost of the motor-generator set and

DC DRIVES: ADVANTAGES AND
DISADVANTAGES
Among the advantages for dc drives is the fact that the
dc drive technology is simpler than the ac drive technol-
ogy. It has been in existence for a long time and is well
known. DC drives have good efficiency through the
speed range. DC controllers are smaller than adjustable-
frequency drives, but the motors are larger than induction
motors.
Disadvantages of the dc drives are the fact that the
dc motor is not always available or is not considered a
shelf item. A tach generator for good speed regulation
is a requirement. If tach loss occurs, the drive may run
away to full speed. The power factor decreases with
speed. Bypass is not possible because of the construc-
tion of the dc motor. Full power conversion of all
power supplied to the motor is required by the con-
troller. Larger power devices are required.
DC DRIVES AND SYSTEMS
Custom-engineered drives and coordinated drive sys-
tems are available in ratings from 4 to 1500 hp. A wide
variety of packaging and functional modifications pro-
vide flexibility and performance levels for demanding
applications as dictated by machine characteristics and
process requirements.

with 75-hp Speedpak drive for a pull-through-slitter
application. It is mounted in a standard enclosure.
System-engineered drives serve complex manufac-
turing processes. In many cases they are integrated
with programmable controllers and a variety of stan-
dard industrial control products to provide the user
with a total control system.

associated field control, this method has not been prac-
tical for the small motor speed control applications
most commonly used in home and industry. Therefore,
the motor-generator control method has been confined
primarily to industrial uses of large motor speed con-
trol, that is, for motors with more than 1 hp.
CLOSED-LOOP CONTROLS
Many of the open-loop controls are adequate, but the
trend toward better speed regulation, such as in meeting
servo systems requirements, has necessitated closed-loop
control (Fig. 17-12). In the basic or elementary form,
a closed-loop control consists of an actuator (the motor),
a comparator, an amplifier, and a sensor (the generator).
The more sophisticated controls use this basic circuitry
and then build on it to get motors to produce the torque
and speed required when needed.

CHAPTER

IRON-CORE TRANSFORMER
Iron-core transformers use the mutual inductance prin-
ciple to transfer power between primary and secondary
windings. An iron core provides a low-reluctance path
for the magnetic flux. The iron core is represented by
two straight lines between the primary and secondary
coils.
Alternating current (ac) changes its magnetic field
constantly so that a transformer can use this changing
magnetic flux field to transfer ac power from the pri-
mary to the secondary (Fig. 18-2). Note that the two
windings are not connected in this type of transformer
(autotransformers will be examined later—they have
only one winding). The only means of transferring
energy from the primary winding to the secondary
winding is the magnetic field.
Turns Ratio
Transformers are either step-up or step-down. If the
input voltage is higher than the output voltage, the
device is a step-down transformer. In a step-up trans-
former, the output voltage is higher than the input. The
input-output voltage relationship depends on the turns
ratio, which describes the relationship between the
windings of the primary and secondary coils. The first
number in a given ratio is for the secondary. The sec-
ond number is for the primary. The ratio of the primary

TRANSFORMERS
Transformers make it possible to utilize the high volt-
ages generated at power plants. They can be used to
step up voltages to allow electrical power to be trans-
ported from the generator site to the user. Transformers
make it possible to do many things with electricity.
This is a relatively silent device that is hidden in enclo-
sures above and below ground. It has no moving parts
(except ventilation fans in some cases) and is over 99%
efficient. Transformers can range in size from tiny
assemblies of the size of a pea to behemoths weighing
over 500 tons. However, the principles that govern the
function of electrical transformers are the same, no
matter what the size or the use to which it is put.
A transformer functions with no physical con-
nection between the input and output coils. The prin-
ciple used is mutual inductance. Current flows into
the transformer primary coil. This current creates a
magnetic flux. The magnetic flux, in effect, couples
the primary coil with the secondary coil. Voltage is
induced in the secondary coil. The induced voltage
may be varied by increasing or decreasing the mag-
netic field. The result of a transformer’s operation is
the induction of electromotive force (EMF) in the
secondary coil (Fig. 18-1).

The primary of the coil is coupled to the secondary by
the magnetic flux lines.

winding. The impedance ratio is equal to the square of
the turns ratio:
or
TRANSFORMER LOSSES
Most transformers operate warm, and some are quite
hot if used for a long period of time. This heat repre-
sents a power loss and means an efficiency of less than
100%.
Eddy Current Losses
The greatest loss comes from eddy currents. They are
currents induced into the core material. Since the core
material has low electrical resistance, there are many
closed loops for high current. This current in the core
material generates heat and is wasted power.
Eddy currents are not desired. They are produced
by the magnetic flux that links the primary and sec-
ondary windings. The flux lines are necessary for
the transfer of electrical energy from the primary to the
secondary. However, they also induce voltages into the
core material (Fig. 18-4A). Flux produced by the eddy
currents opposes the desired flux that links the primary
and secondary windings. This means that a greater
power demand is made on the source, and the primary
current is higher than the amount required to supply the
secondary load.

to secondary voltage is the same as the primary-to-sec-
ondary turns ratio:
We can also state that the power in the primary equals
the power in the secondary, minus any losses.
A moderate overload causes the temperature of the
transformer to be increased. Therefore, the current
available is actually a function of the amount of heating
permissible in the transformer itself.
AUTOTRANSFORMERS
Autotransformers provide a simple means of trans-
forming voltage and impedance, but they do not
provide the isolation between the primary and the
secondary given by a regular transformer. The sec-
ondary load is really a part of the primary circuit
whether the autotransformer is being used to step up
or step down the voltage. A good example of auto-
transformer use in the industry is the buck and boast
transformer. It is used to increase or decrease the
voltage as needed (Fig. 18-3).
Autotransformers are restricted in their applica-
tions because it is not always possible to have one end
grounded as required by the National Electrical Code
(NEC) in some installations.
Turns Ratio
The voltage ratio for an autotransformer is directly
related to the number of turns between the tap and the
common terminal and over the entire winding. Voltages
and impedance can be calculated for an autotrans-
former in the same way that they are calculated for a
transformer with separate windings. The voltage is
directly proportional to the number of turns in the

Electric power is transferred from the primary to the
secondary by the mutual coupling of the magnetic fields.
Fig. 18-3
Primary and secondary are both part of a single
winding on an autotransformer.

Eddy current losses are reduced to a minimum by
using a laminated core (Fig. 18-4B). With a laminated
core, the eddy current paths in the core are parallel to
that for the current in the windings. These thin layers of
material create a high-resistance electrical path and
reduce the circulation of eddy currents. At the same
time, the iron laminations provide a low-reluctance
magnetic path, and the structure has no adverse effect
on transformer action.
Hysteresis Losses
Hysteresis also plays a role in the loss presented by trans-
former operation. These losses are due to the properties
of the iron core. Iron is slow to change polarity with
changes in current and magnetic field polarity. The delay
is known as hysteresis, or slowness to change properties
(from north to south or south to north as the current
changes polarity) (Fig. 18-5).

Fig. 18-5
Functional drawings showing hysteresis loss.
Note how the north-south poles are aligned in the
magnetized piece and scattered in the nonmagnetized
piece in between the change from north to south pole.
This change from a north-south orientation to a south-
north orientation consumes energy inasmuch as the
metal structure is actually changed with the change in
polarity. Hysteresis losses in transformers are mini-
mized by using silicon steel inasmuch as it will change
its polarity with a minimum of effort.
Copper Losses
Copper losses are due to the resistance of the copper
wire in the primary and secondary coils. Large-size
wire helps to minimize these losses.
CORE CONSTRUCTION
There are at least two usable core designs for power
transformers (Fig. 18-6). The core form has the low-
voltage and high-voltage windings at different locations

sets, one on each leg of the transformer core. Figure 18-7
shows how this is done with a cutaway view of a three-
phase transformer. Note the tube coolers, where the hot
oil moves up and then through the tubes to be cooled and
to reenter the tank through the bottom.
TRANSFORMER OIL
In order to make a better transformer, the industry dis-
covered in 1929 that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
made a good insulating oil and also served to keep the
coil from overheating since it carried the heat to an out-
side cooling arrangement (Fig. 18-7). However, PCBs
on the frame or core (Fig. 18-6A). The shell-form con-
struction makes a more efficient type of transformer
inasmuch as the secondary is wound on top of the pri-
mary (Fig. 18-6B). This allows for maximum flux to cut
the secondary windings. The magnetic field is also con-
centrated by the middle leg and contained within the
core by the other two legs of the core. The laminations
are E-shaped and inserted within the coil first in one
direction and then the other. Then I-shaped laminations
are used to complete the flux path, and the E-I combi-
nation makes a complete path for the magnetic flux.
In a three-phase transformer, the primary is wound
and then the secondary on top of it, but there are three coil

have been determined to be toxic and to cause cancer in
human beings and animals. The Environmental Protec-
tion Agency (EPA) keeps close tabs on transformers
that utilize this cooling oil:
1. PCB transformers: All transformers that contain over
500 ppm (parts per million) of PCB. These cannot be
rebuilt and must be labeled with the EPA label.
2. PCB-contaminated transformer: All transformers
not in category 1 must be assumed to be contami-
nated with between 50 and 500 ppm, unless proven
otherwise by testing. They may be rebuilt, but PCB
fluid must be burned in an EPA-approved incinerator.
3. Non-PCB transformers: They have less than 50 ppm
PCB.
The historical significance of this development in
the transformer-manufacturing process makes interest-
ing reading, inasmuch as it also shows the development
of the technology for the past 60 years.
EPA Highlights1
1929—Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) invented
by Swann Chemical Company.
1933—General Electric Company patented the
application for use as a dielectric fluid in transform-
ers and placed in service.
1977—US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
published the final rule for “Polychlorinated
Biphenyls (PCBs) Manufacturing, Processing, Dis-
tribution in Commerce and Use Prohibitions.”
1982—Electrical Use Rule required periodic inspec-
tion and records of PCB leaks and also established
new classification for PCB transformers, which pose
an exposure risk to food plants and animal feeds.
1985 (July)—Fire Hazard Rule imposed new restric-
tions due to PCB transformers involved in fires,
requiring removal of high-risk transformers or
installation of fault protection by October l, 1990.
1985 (August 16)—Fire Hazard Rule requires the
reporting of any PCB transformer involved in a fire that
caused tank to rupture and details cleanup procedures.
1985 (October 1)—Deadline for removal of PCB
transformers in food and feed plants. Also prohib-
ited the installation of used PCB transformers into
commercial buildings. Commercial buildings are
defined as public assembly properties, educational
properties, institutions, stores, office buildings, and
transportation centers, such as airports and bus or
train stations.
1985 (December 1)—Fire Hazard Rule further requires
the following, regarding all PCB transformers:
1. Removal of all combustibles in and around the
transformer.
2. Notify local fire department of location of PCB
transformer.
3. Access ways to PCB transformers that must be
marked and identified for firefighters.
4. Owners of PCB transformers in or near commer-
cial buildings must register the transformer with
the building owner in writing with a complete
description of the transformer and location.
(“Near” means within 30 m.)
1990 (October 1)—All PCB transformers in or near
commercial buildings must be removed, retrofitted,
or equipped with new fault protection based on their
classification.
1. Transformer secondary voltage less than 480Y/277
V requires high fault current protection.
2. A radial transformer with a secondary voltage of
480Y/277 V or higher must be equipped with
both high and low fault current protection.
3. Use of network PCB transformers is prohibited
as of this date.
After reviewing the requirements above, it should
be evident that the best permanent solution is a retrofit
or transformer replacement, providing a new non-PCB
transformer.
AUTOTRANSFORMERS: 
THREE- AND SINGLE-PHASE
The three-phase autotransformer is chosen for its
economy and energy considerations. They are used
by those who have a 480Y/277- or 208Y/120-V, three-
phase, four-wire distributing system in the building
(Fig. 18-8).
An autotransformer cannot be used on a 480- or
240-V, three-phase, three-wire delta system. A grounded
neutral phase conductor must be available in accordance
with the NEC Article 210-9, Exception 1.
Other than this article, autotransformers are installed
under the same requirements as any other dry-type
transformer. Figure 18-9 shows a typical wiring dia-
gram for the autotransformer. Table 18-1 lists some of
the characteristics of these transformers at 30 to 300 kVA
(kilovolt-amperes).

Since the source and load share a common
winding, there is no isolation of the load from the
source. Where this is a requirement, it is recom-
mended that the shielded isolating transformer be
used. This is especially true for computers and other
sensitive loads.
Impedances
Impedances of autotransformers are quite a bit lower
than comparable two-winding transformers. Although
this provides better voltage regulation, it must be con-
sidered when making short-circuit studies for proper
protective devices. Note the X/R and percentage Z val-
ues in Table 18-1. Table 18-2 shows impedances at
170C.
Third Harmonics
Third harmonics are always present in wye-wye con-
nections, but are kept at a minimum by using a three-
legged core construction. For general use, this
presents no problem. Sound levels are indicated in
Table 18-3.

Grounding
Article 250-26 of the NEC deals with grounding of
separately derived ac systems. It is best to study the
requirements of Article 250-26, 250-79(c), and Section
250-5 before connecting the transformers. Figure 18-10
shows the typical drawing for grounding a two-winding
transformer, and Fig. 18-11 shows how the common
grounded neutral is installed for autotransformers as
per the NEC 210-9.
BUCK AND BOOST
TRANSFORMERS
Buck and boost transformers are used to increase or
decrease voltage. They are insulating transformers that
have 120  240 V primaries and either 12/24- or 16/32-V
secondaries. When used as isolating transformers, they
carry the rated kilovolt-amperes stated on the nameplate.
Their prime use and value, however, lies in the fact that
the primary and secondary of a buck and boost trans-
former can be interconnected and the unit used as an
autotransformer. By varying the manner in which the
two primary and two secondary windings are connected,
numerous ratios and current ratings can be obtained.
There are many applications where a slight
adjustment in voltage (either upward or downward) is
desirable or necessary. The use of a buck and boost
transformer is one of the most economical and compact
means of accomplishing adjustments of this type.
When used as an autotransformer, a buck and boost
unit will carry loads in excess of its nameplate rating.
The increased ampacity is dependent on the ratio and
voltage to which the transformer is subjected.
The application of buck and boost transformers as
autotransformers has long been a source of confusion to
users. Key to this confusion undoubtedly lies in the fact
that when used as an autotransformer, the buck and
boost unit carries loads in excess of its nameplate rating.
The nameplate rating shows the load that can be
carried continuously by the unit when used as an isola-
tion transformer, with a line voltage of 120 or 240 V
(Fig. 18-12). There is no direct electrical connection
between the primary windings (letters H) and the sec-
ondary windings (letters X). If used in this way, each
winding must carry full nameplate load.
Figure 18-13 shows a buck and boost transformer
connected as an autotransformer. Note that in this case,
the primary windings (letters H) and the secondary
windings (letters X) are in direct electrical contact at H1-
X1 junction. Because the primary and secondary wind-
ings are interconnected, they share the load, rather than
each having to carry the full load. Consequently, the
transformer can carry a load greater than on the name-
plate. The winding section from H1 to H4 carries only
the difference of the primary and secondary currents,
thus permitting the higher-load kilovolt-ampere ratings.
Calculating the Load
Increasing or decreasing line voltage by small percent-
ages can be accomplished easily and economically by the
proper use of buck and boost units as autotransformers.
Depending on the percentage of change desired and the

In the case of the autotransformer, the grounded

Three-Phase Buck and Boost

and boost transformers. Figure 18-14, schematics 5 to

in three-phase arrangements.

formers to boost or buck. Three-phase loads can be

in open delta form. Three-phase loads can also be
served by using three single-phase units connected
in wye.
Before using autotransformers, check local codes
for any restrictions to their use.
DRY-TYPE TRANSFORMERS
Newer makes of oil-filled transformers have elimi-
nated the use of PCBs in their tanks. Dry-type trans-
formers do have some advantages and are used to
replace the older PCB types. Dry-type transformers
increase the efficiency of electrical systems consider-
ably by permitting voltages greater than 600 V to be
conducted, as near as physically possible, to the elec-
trical center of the load. This reduces to the minimum
money spent for line losses and for larger secondary
systems. It is not practical to do this with oil-filled
transformers, which must be installed outdoors at a

permissible rise (by resistance measurement) of the
windings (150C), the hot differential allowance
(30C), and the ambient allowance (40C). This 220C
insulation system was formerly called the H Insulation
System by the National Electrical Manufacturers Asso-
ciation (NEMA) and the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI). The letter designation H was dropped
due to the confusion caused by UL calling this same
220C system a C Insulating System.
Taps
Taps are made standard with two 2.5% above and
below normal primary voltage. Four 2.5% taps below
normal primary voltage can be obtained from most
manufacturers.
SPECIAL TRANSFORMERS
Outdoor transformers of the ventilated dry type are tam-
perproof with special baffled louvers, and are con-
structed of heavy-gage sheet metal that has been cleaned
and painted. Periodic inspections are recommended, but
there is no oil or filter to check. The transformers are
available in all voltages up to 15 kV and sizes through
1500 kVA (Fig. 18-16).
safe distance from a building, or in a fireproof vault,
which cannot be usually located for the most efficient
power distribution. Although recent NEC changes per-
mit vaults with lower fire ratings if they are sprinkler
protected, many engineers and users object to installing
any water pipes in electrical equipment rooms. Some
electrical equipment rooms also contain an emergency
distribution system, including the generator. A water
leak or sprinkler head malfunction could disable the
entire electrical system.
A second type of application, which is quite com-
mon, is the use of dry-type transformers on a roof.
Since they are usually lighter than a comparable oil-
filled transformer, a lighter roof structure is required.
Also, they do not require any special provisions for
containing the oil in case of a leak or fire.
Another major area of use has been in high-rise
buildings, permitting the economical distribution of
power to the various floors using voltages up to 15 kV,
and then stepping down to the utilization voltage.
Since the use of askarel transformers was prohibited
because of the environmental concerns raised by PCBs,
new liquids with suitable cooling and insulating qualities
have been developed and applied to transformer use.
The NEC classifies them as “less flammable.”
This means that they can burn but are less combustible
than mineral oil, or “nonflammable,” which means
that they do not have a flash point or fire point.
Because this is a new application for most of these liq-
uids, there are few historical field data to determine if
there are some unknown, undesirable characteristics
that might develop in some of these liquids over a
period of years. Figure 18-15 shows dry-type trans-
formers with and without a cabinet.
Cooling
The addition of cooling fans increases the capacity of a
transformer by 33.33%. This is an economical way to
handle short-time load peaks or emergency overloads.
Fans can be provided at the time the transformer is pur-
chased, or provision can be made for the future addition of
fans in the field. Fan cooling is generally economical to
provide on transformers 300 kVA and larger. Automatic
fan cooling systems have heat-sensing thermistors in each
phase of a three-phase or single-phase transformer.
Insulation and Temperature
Rise
Most dry-type transformer manufacturers use UL-
component-recognized 220C insulation systems for
30 kVA and above. The 220C represents the ultimate
temperature of the winding and is the sum of the

LIQUID-FILLED TRANSFORMERS
The transformer coils are immersed in an oil or silicone
to increase the efficiency of the transformer. The liquid
has the ability to transfer heat from the coil to the out-
side of the case efficiently. The liquid also has insulat-
ing qualities that are very desirable at high voltages.
Now that PCBs are eliminated from the manufacture of
transformers, it is necessary to make sure that the
replacements are environmentally safe. So far, the oils
used are as fire resistant as the PCB oil.
Safety Notice
Keep in mind that to work with transformers, adequate
training is needed. Extremely hazardous voltages are
present in energized units. Adequate training and safe
working procedures for this and related high-voltage
equipment are needed to make sure that you can work
with the equipment safely.
Working with and inspecting the transformer tank
and its contents requires special instructions on its con-
tents and operation. Some of these are mentioned here
to inform those who may wish to obtain further train-
ing before work on the equipment.
SUBMERSIBLE TRANSFORMER
Some manufacturers use gray paint for the exterior of
the transformer and others use green (Fig. 18-19).
These three-phase transformers consist of a core and
coil assembly designed to reduce operating losses, and
to provide adequate mechanical strength should a sys-
tem fault occur. The 75- to 5000-kVA core-coil assem-
blies are of the five-legged design with wound cores
(Fig. 18-20). By using the five-legged design, the pos-
sibility of tank heating due to stray flux paths under
short-circuit conditions is eliminated. Computer design
techniques produce a core-coil assembly with high
efficiency and low losses for the most economical
operating characteristics. Strip aluminum secondary
windings offer high axial short-circuit strength and fast
coil heat dissipation.
Maintenance
Oil leaks are rare but, if detected, must be repaired at
once to avoid the liquid level dropping below ener-
gized parts, creating a possibility of flashover or tank
overheating. If required, the transformer must be
refilled to its proper operating level. Small pinhole
leaks in the exterior metal, weld seam, or other loca-
tions, resulting in slow dripping, can be repaired with
Pad-mounted transformers (dry-type) are ventilated
and have a 4160-V delta primary and 208Y/120-V
secondary with two 2.5% taps (Fig. 18-17). This type of
housing may also contain a primary hook-stick-operated
switch, transformer, and a limited amount of secondary
breakers and switches. All outdoor transformers over
600 V have lightning arresters as standard equipment for
extra protection against lightning or switching surges.
Epoxy units are made for substations and are par-
ticularly suited for applications requiring a dry-type
transformer with good performance characteristics. The
windings are completely impregnated with epoxy resin,
which together with fiberglass cloth and tape forms the
solid dielectric system. The solid dielectric system pro-
tects the windings from its environment with respect to
moisture and airborne contaminants. This solid dielec-
tric system also provides the ability to withstand ther-
mal shock and the mechanical forces of a short circuit.
They are ideal replacements for PCB units (Fig. 18-18).

a lifetime durable epoxy patch kit. The transformer
must first be de-energized. Then a temporary oil stick
is applied. Next the epoxy is applied. This usually
eliminates the need for a vacuum pump to stop the oil
leak while the epoxy is being cured. Larger leaks may
require the use of a vacuum pump. The main reason
for maintaining the level and preventing the oil to leak
out is the entry of moisture into the tank. The mois-
ture can cause problems at high voltages and can also
cause the oil to become contaminated, necessitating
its removal and replacement. Figure 18-21 shows all
the parts of a liquid-filled substation transformer.
Note the location of the pressure relief device, fill
plug, liquid-level gage, dial-type thermometer, name-
plate, and drain valve. The fins on the back are used to
cool the liquid as it passes through the tubes from top
to bottom. Hot oil rises and enters the tubes at the top
of the fins. As it trickles down, it is cooled by the out-
side air. Once cooled, it reenters the tank at the bot-
tom to once again pick up excess heat and conduct it
to the outside of the tank and away from the coils
inside.

chapter.
Distributing Power at High
Voltages
Transformers are used for distributing power at 480
or 600 V and stepping down voltage at the point of
use (for 240-V motors, or 120-V equipment and
lights). This results in better regulation of voltage
and minimized line loss and reduces wiring costs. See
Fig. 18-22 for a diagram illustrating these points.
Double-Wiring Elimination
Transformers are used to eliminate double wiring. For
maximum safety, 120-V lighting and control circuits
may be obtained from 240-, 480-, or 600-V power cir-
cuits by installing dry-type transformers at the most
convenient location to the load. This eliminates sepa-
rate circuits and independent metering for power and
light and often results in large savings. See Fig. 18-23
for examples of this.
Operating 120/240-V Equipment
from Power Circuits
Transformers are used to operate portable tools, elec-
trical control devices, alarms, relays, soldering irons,
TRANSFORMER APPLICATIONS
Transformers are used in business, industry, and com-
merce as well as for schools and homes. They come in
many sizes and shapes, as has been seen so far in this

welders, and other high-current devices more economi-
cally from 120- or 240-V circuits supplied through a
dry-type transformer from a high-voltage power circuit
(Fig. 18-24).
Isolating Circuits
Transformers are used because of their ability to isolate
one circuit from another. They can be air-cooled trans-
formers and used as a means of subdividing circuits to
accommodate independent demand.
They can be connected to a three-phase, 480-V cir-
cuit, dry-type transformer to provide 120/240-V, three-
wire, single-phase power for lighting loads. They can
provide 120-V single-phase lighting loads or 240-V
single-phase lighting or power loads. Transformers per-
mit grounding of each low-voltage circuit (Fig. 18-25).
Changing from a Four-Wire 
to Three-Wire Circuit
Transformers can be used to produce a three-wire,
120/240-V, single-phase circuit from the 120-V, two-
wire circuit of a four-wire, 208Y/120-V, three-phase
source. A three-phase primary of 240, 480, or 600 V
may be used to provide a three-wire, 120/240-V, single-
phase circuit (Fig. 18-26).
Stepping-Up or Stepping-Down
Voltage
Transformers can be used to step up or step down volt-
ages simply by virtue of the turns ratio in the primary
as compared to the secondary (Fig. 18-27). Whenever
the voltage source is lower or higher than the nominal
required by the equipment load, a buck and boost trans-
former may be used.
MOTOR TRANSFORMERS
Transformers arse very necessary to obtain the proper
voltage for the operation of motors. Table 18-4 shows
transformer ratings required for the operation of stan-
dard induction motors at standard voltages and at 60 Hz.
Table 18-5 shows how to convert kilowatts to horse-
power or horsepower to kilowatts, and Table 18-6 shows
what can happen with improper voltage levels in a plant.

HARMONIC MITIGATING
TRANSFORMERS AND AC LINE
REACTORS
Harmonic Mitigating
Transformers
Non-linear loads generate high levels of harmonic cur-
rents, which can be fed back in the distribution system.
Waveform distortion causes overheating of motors and
transformers, and increases neutral currents. This can
cause malfunctioning and/or damage to equipment on
the line. Figure 18-28 shows an enclosed harmonic
mitigating transformer with a 480-volt Delta primary
and a secondary output of 208Y/120.
A wide range of applications make use of line reactors
such as paper machines, process lines, press controls,
and drive systems, along with tube mills and other
sophisticated process equipment. These reactor appli-
cations are also found in such industries as food pro-
cessing and beverage bottling, paper manufacture,
packaging systems, and printing.
Uses for Line and Load Reactors
Line reactors
eliminate nuisance tripping of circuit breakers due to
transients created by switching on the utility line. Har-
monics are generated by drive systems when they are
switched on and off and the line reactor can eliminate
these harmonics and make for a quieter running motor
with an extended life. Today’s switchgear, equipped
with solid state trip sensing devices, is designed to react
to peak current rather than RMS current. Since switch-
ing transients can peak over 1000 volts, the resulting
overvoltage will cause undesirable interruptions. The
line reactor can also extend the life of solid state devices
by attenuating these disturbances.

Transformers have been designed to contain the
harmonics within without allowing them to move
along the distribution line. Conventional K-Factor
transformers operate on the harmonics and contain
them within the transformer, thus preventing them
from going further upstream.
The harmonic mitigating transformer eliminates
harmonics by pitting them against themselves. This
presents a cleaner power and provides greater system-
wide energy efficiency.
Line Reactors
Line reactors look like transformers (see Fig. 18-29).
They aid in preventing equipment failure and down-
time, thus adding years to the life of electrical equip-

BASIC PRINCIPLE
The basic principle for the generation of an EMF in an
ac generator or alternator is the same as in a dc genera-
tor. The generation of an EMF in an armature conductor
depends solely on a relative motion between the con-
ductor and the magnetic field. Two constructions are
possible. The magnetic field may be stationary, and the
armature may rotate. In this case, the magnetic field is
called the stator and the armature is called the rotor. Or
the magnetic field may rotate and the armature may be
stationary, in which case the magnetic field is called
the rotor and the armature is called the stator.
In almost all dc generators, the field is stationary
and the armature is rotated. But in almost all ac genera-
tors, the armature is stationary and the field is rotated.
The latter type of construction provides some advan-
tages. A rotating armature requires slip rings to carry
current to the external load. Such rings are difficult to
insulate. They are frequent sources of trouble often caus-
ing open and short circuits. A stationary armature needs
no slip rings. Thus armature leads can be continuously
insulated conductors from the armature coils to the bus
bars. It is more difficult to insulate conductors in a rotat-
ing armature than in a stationary armature because of the
centrifugal force that results from rotation. Also, the sta-
tionary armature allows alternators to operate with higher
voltages than those in dc generators.
Inasmuch as an ac motor will not operate without a
source of alternating current, it is important that a closer
examination of the device that provides the power for
the operation of all ac motors be made. Figure 19-1

Power Generation
Fig. 19-1
Loop of wire rotating in a magnetic field. This basic alternator produces the wave form shown in Fig. 19-2.

Compare the salient-pole rotor and Fig. 19-4, which
has a turbo-type rotor.
When the ac generator is to be driven by a slow
speed diesel engine or by a water turbine (up to 720
rpm), the salient-pole or projecting-pole rotor is used.
The field poles are formed by fastening a number of
steel laminations to a spoked-frame or spider. The
heavy pole pieces produce a flywheel effect on the
slow-speed rotor. This helps to keep the angular speed
constant. It also reduces variation in the voltage and
frequency of the generator output. In high-speed alter-
nators (up to 3600 rpm), the smooth-surface turbo type
rotor is used for two major reasons: (1) it has less air-
friction (heating) loss, and (2) the windings can be
placed so that they can withstand the centrifugal forces
developed at high speeds. Turbo-type rotors are a solid-
steel forging, a number of steel disks fastened together
with the field coils locked in slots. These field coils are
usually placed so they distribute the field flux evenly
around the rotor, as shown in Fig. 19-4.
Stators
In a rotating-field ac generator, the armature windings
are stationary and are therefore the stator. The armature
iron, being in a moving magnetic field, is laminated to
reduce eddy current losses. A typical ac generator stator
is shown in Fig. 19-5. In high-speed turbo-type genera-
tors, the stator laminations are ribbed to provide suffi-
cient ventilation. This is necessary because the high
temperature developed in the windings cannot be dissi-
pated in the small air gap between the rotor and the sta-
tor. Figure 19-6 illustrates the close tolerance. In some
large installations, the alternators are totally enclosed
and cooled by hydrogen gas under pressure, which has
greater heat-dissipating properties than air. Stator coils
in high-speed alternators must be well braced. Bracing
prevents coils from being pulled out of place when the
alternator is operating with heavy loads.
shows a simplified drawing of an ac generator. Certain
features of this generator are basic to the design of all
ac generators. Note how the loop of wire rotating in a
magnetic field creates the sine-wave output.
Sine Wave
The voltage produced by this generator is an alternat-
ing voltage. One complete revolution of the coil pro-
duces 1 Hz of voltage. That is, the voltage builds up
from zero to a maximum, then drops to zero, then
builds up again in the opposite direction to a maxi-
mum. Finally, the voltage drops to zero to complete the
hertz or cycle. Such a hertz of alternating current or
voltage is represented by a sine wave (Fig. 19-2).
COMPONENTS OF THE
ALTERNATOR
Rotors
The rotating part of the generator is called the rotor.
The field of the ac generator is placed on the rotor. It is
either a salient-pole type or a turbo type (Fig. 19-3)..

Exciters
Like many dc generators, ac generators need a sepa-
rate dc source for their fields. This dc field current
must be obtained from an external source called an
exciter. The exciter used to supply this current is usu-
ally a flat, compound-wound dc generator designed to
furnish from 125 to 250 V. The exciter armature may
be mounted directly on the rotor shaft of the ac gener-
ator, or it may be belt driven. Figure 19-7 shows an
exciter armature and generator field mounted on the
same shaft.
Brushless exciters are also used to provide the dc
fields. The brushless exciter is an ac generator that con-
verts the ac power to dc. It does so by means of a diode
rectifier assembly which is attached to, but insulated
from, the generator shaft. The brushless exciter has no
friction-producing parts, such as brushes, brush hold-
ers, commutator, or slip rings. It needs very little main-
tenance (Fig. 19-8).
Static Exciters
Another method of field excitation
commonly used is the static exciter. It is called a static
exciter because it contains no moving parts. A portion
of the ac current from each phase of the generator out-
put is fed back through a system of transformers, recti-
fiers, and reactors to the field windings as dc excitation
current. With this system an external source of dc cur-
rent is necessary for initial excitation of the field wind-
ings. On engine-driven generators, the initial “field
flash” may be obtained from storage batteries, which
are also used to start the engine.
Frame and Shaft
The frame and shaft of an alternator
serve the same purpose as in the dc generator. The frame
completes the magnetic circuit of the field. It also sup-
ports the parts and windings. The shaft, on which the
rotor turns is supported by the end bells or end frames.

leads are brought out from the generator for connection
TYPES OF ALTERNATORS
Single-Phase
This type of alternator is seldom used except for spe-
cial purposes. It is used as an emergency generator and
for construction crews. As a rule, this type of alternator
is low powered and self-excited. Figure 19-9 shows a
typical alternator. Its construction is similar to a dc gen-
erator with an auxiliary ac winding on the dc armature.
The dc winding on the rotating member is of the usual
lap or wave-type construction. The winding is con-
nected to the commutator bars in the usual way. 
The dc winding output provides the current for the
dc field excitation and other dc power applications. A
second open wave winding is laid in the slots of the
rotating member on top of the dc winding. This second
winding, which is connected to slip rings, supplies the
ac output.
Two-Phase
This type of alternator is called a multiphase or
polyphase ac generator. It has two or more single-phase
windings symmetrically spaced around the stator. In a
two-phase alternator, these are two single-phase wind-
ings physically spaced so that the ac voltage induced in
one is 90o out of phase with the voltage induced in the
other. When one winding is being cut by maximum
flux, the other is cut by no flux.
Figure 19-10 shows a schematic diagram of a two-
phase, four-pole alternator. This stator consists of two
single-phase windings (phases) separated from each
other. Each phase consists of four windings. These
windings are connected in series so that their voltages
add. The rotor is identical to the rotor used in the sin-
gle-phase alternator. Note in Fig. 19-10B the wave-
forms produced by this type of generator.

three-phase. The three phases are then divided by three
separate transformers into single-phase power for three
different subdivisions or three different customers. Some
three-phase power is used by businesses to drive large
motors. Three-phase motors do not require as much
maintenance as single-phase motors.
WYE AND DELTA
CONFIGURATIONS
Wye Connection
Instead of` six leads coming out of the three-phase
alternator, one of the leads from each phase, may be
connected to form a common junction. The stator is
then wye- or star-connected. Figure 19-13 shows a
wye connection. The common lead may or may not
be brought out of the machine. If it is brought out, it
is called the neutral. One advantage of the neutral is
the balancing of the load between or among all coils.
The neutral serves as a common return circuit from
all three phases. It maintains a voltage balance across
the loads. No current flows in the neutral when the
loads are balanced. The three-phase, four-wire system
is widely used in industry and for aircraft ac power
systems.

Delta Connection
A three-phase stator may also be connected in a delta
configuration. In a delta-connected alternator, one
phase winding and the start end of another are con-
nected to the finish end of the third. The start end of
the third is connected to the finish end of the first. The
three junction points are connected to the line wires
leading to the load. Figure 19-14 shows a delta con-
nection. When the generator phases are properly
to a load. This type of power is seldom used. However,
in some parts of Europe this type of power is available
for home and commercial use. It has an advantage
when starting motors: ac motors that use two-phase
power do not need a start winding or a switch to
remove the windings from the circuit once the motor
has reached operating speed, as is the case with single-
phase motors.
Three-Phase
As the name indicates, this type of alternator has three
single-phase windings. These windings are spaced so
that the voltage induced in each winding is 120° out of
phase with the voltage in the other two windings. A
schematic diagram of a three-phase generator showing
all three coils is complex. Figure 19-12A shows how
some of the various load options can be connected on
three-phase power.
Figure 19-12B shows the output waveform or the
alternator. Note that there are 120° of separation between
each phase of the output.
Electrical power generated by power companies
for use in homes and business is all produced as

The total true power is:
Thus the expression for three-phase power deliv-
ered by a balanced delta-connected system is the same
as the expression for three-phase power delivered by a
balanced wye-connected system.
FREQUENCY
The frequency of the alternator voltage depends on the
speed of rotation of the rotor and the number of poles.
The higher the frequency needed, the faster the alterna-
tor must turn. The lower the speed: the lower the fre-
quency. The more poles on the rotor: the higher the
frequency for a given speed. When a rotor has rotated
through an angle such that two adjacent poles (a north
and a south pole) have passed one winding, the voltage
induced in that winding has varied through one com-
plete cycle or hertz.

connected in delta, no appreciable current flows within
the delta loop when there is no external load connected
to the alternator. If any one of the phases is reversed
with respect to its correct connection, a short circuit
current flows within the windings on no-load. This
causes damage to the windings.
To avoid connecting a phase in reverse, it is neces-
sary to test the circuit before closing the delta. This is
done by connecting a voltmeter or fuse wire between
the two ends of the delta loop before closing the delta.
The two ends of the delta loop are never connected if
there is an indication of any appreciable current or volt-
age between them when no load is connected to the
alternator.
Power in a Balanced Wye
The power delivered by a balanced three-phase wye-
connected system is equal to three times the power
delivered by each phase. The total true power is:

LOAD CHANGES
When the load of an alternator is changed, the termi-
nal voltage carries the load. The amount of variation
depends on the design of the generator and the power
factor of the load. With a load having a lagging
power factor (one with inductance dominating), the
drop in terminal voltage with increased load is
greater than for unity (1.00) power factor (that is, a
totally resistive load). With a load, a power factor
that is leading the terminal voltage tends to rise. The
causes of terminal voltage changes with load changes
are the armature resistance, armature reactance, and
armature reaction.
Armature Resistance
When current flows through a generator armature wind-
ing, there is an IR drop (voltage drop) due to the resis-
tance of the winding. This drop increases with load.
Thus the terminal voltage is reduced. The armature
resistance drop is small because the resistance is low.
Armature Reactance
The armature current in an alternator varies approxi-
mately as a sine wave. The continuously varying cur-
rent in the generator armature is accompanied by an
IRL voltage drop in addition to the IR drop. Armature
reactance in an alternator may be from 30 to 50 times
the value of armature resistance. This is because of the
relatively large inductance of the coils in comparison
with its resistance.
Armature Reaction
When an alternator supplies no load, the dc field flux is
distributed uniformly across the air gap. When an alter-
nator supplies a reactive load, however, the current flow-
ing through the armature conductors produces an armature
magnetomotive force (MMF). That force influences the
terminal voltage by changing the magnitude of the field
flux across the air gap. When the load is inductive, the
armature MMF opposes the dc field and weakens it.
Thus the terminal voltage decreases. When a leading
current flows in the armature, the dc field is aided by the
armature MMF. The flux across the air gap is increased.
Thus the terminal voltage increases.
VOLTAGE REGULATION
Voltage regulation of an alternator is the change from
full-load to no-load voltage. This is expressed in per-
centage of full-load volts with a constant speed and dc
field current. For example, the no-load voltage of an
alternator is 250 V. Its full-load voltage is 220 V. What
is the percent of regulation?
STANDBY OR EMERGENCY POWER
SOURCES
The loss of power can be very dangerous—catastrophic
in some cases. When the power goes off it can interrupt
ventilation fans, water pumps, milking machines, mechan-
ical feeders, fallout shelters, refrigeration, furnace con-
trols, and other vital modern production equipment that
requires continuous electric service.
Storms, accidents, and equipment breakdown can all
cause an interruption of electrical service. If a power out-
age lasts for any length of time, serious problems, such as
animal suffocation in windowless animal shelters, food
spoilage, frozen water pipes, or loss of production, can
result. An ever-increasing dependence on a constant sup-
ply of electrical power causes increased interest in
standby equipment for the generation of electricity.
Farms, hospitals, schools and businesses, and indus-
try are all interested in a constant supply of electrical
energy. With the widespread use of computers in indus-
try, commerce, and education, the need for a dependable
source of electricity is even more important.
Transfer Switch
One of the most important parts of an emergency
power source is the transfer switch. The National Elec-
trical Codes requires that a standby generator be con-
nected so as to prevent the inadvertent interconnection
of two power sources. A double-pole; double-throw
switch is usually installed between the power sup-
plier’s meter and the service entrance. If current trans-
formers are used for metering, a pole-top transfer
switch may be used. Figure 19-16 shows the typical
transfer switch wiring.
The use of a double-pole, double-throw switch pre-
vents power from feeding back into the power supplier’s
line and endangering the lives of linemen who may be
working to restore power. It also prevents accidental-
energizing of the farm, business, hospital, or other system
and consequent burnout of the generator when regular
power service is restored. Most standby equipment guar-
antees are voided if the transfer switch is not used.
The transfer switch shown in Fig. 19-16 is used at a
home or farm. It shows the basis: method used to transfer
power from a generator to a home or farm system and
then back to the power company’s line. Figure 19-17
shows the automatic transfer and bypass isolation switch.

mounted unit (Fig. 19-19). Engine driven units can also
be stationary or portable and can be either manual start
or automatic start.
Standby generators are available to operate either
as single- or three-phase. Some units are wired with
four lead wires so that they can be operated either sin-
gle- or three-phase. Generators must be matched to the
power, voltage, and frequency used from the power
company’s lines. This is usually 120/240-V, single-
phase, 60-Hz ac.
Types of Standby Generators
Standby generators can be divided into two types:
engine driven and tractor driven (Fig. 19-18). Tractor
driven units can be stationary or portable, as a trailer

There are no standard ratings for standby genera-
tors. That means overload or maximum capacity, lim-
ited to short intermittent periods, must be considered in
selecting the size of generator. Manufacturers’ ratings
can vary from zero overload capacity to 100%. A large
overload capacity permits a smaller unit, particularly
where large electric motors are involved. Figure 19-20
shows a generator design for indoor installation.
Larger units usually rely on a diesel engine for power.
Automatic Transfer Switches
An automatic transfer switch can monitor the normal
power source (Fig. 19-17). If there is a power outage,
the switch signals the engine generator to start. When the
generator reaches proper voltage and frequency, it
transfers selected loads to it. When the normal source
is then restored, the switch retransfers the load to it. It
then shuts down the engine after a cool-down period.
At times a transfer switch handles more than its
normal or continuous current rating. A reliable transfer
switch must be able to handle all situations with no
harmful effects on the switch. Motor starting current is
one of these situations. When a motor starts up, it can
draw as much as six times its running current. It can
draw that much if it stalls while running. If the transfer
switch operates at either of these times, it will have to
interrupt that six times current. Thus the switch must
be able to handle it; if not, the switch could be perma-
nently damaged (Fig. 19-21).
All current goes through the transfer switch. Thus
a short circuit on the load side will cause the maximum
available current to go through the transfer switch until

with battery backup. Due to advances in solid state
equipment, the more commonly used UPS is now the
static inverter with battery backup. This is due primar-
ily to the lower cost per kVA and the elimination of a
high-starting kVA requirement.
A solid-state UPS is made up of three major sec-
tions. The first section is the rectifier that converts the
ac input into dc. The second section is a dc bus on
which floats a battery system. The third section is the
static inverter that converts the dc back to a clean ac
sine wave. The principal function of the UPS is to iso-
late the protected electronic load from power devia-
tions that would affect the operation of the connected
electronic load. Any short-term outage or transient that
occurs on the ac power bus is filtered out or overridden
by the battery in the dc bus section providing constant
power into the inverter.
Sometimes the battery supply of the UPS is
required to carry the output of the inverter for extended
periods of time (in excess of 3 to 5 minutes). Upon
reconnection of the ac power source to the rectifier, the
UPS draws power not only to carry the output load, but
also to recharge the batteries.
Multiple-Engine Generator Sets
Where there are two critical loads with one more criti-
cal than the other, the three source priority load system
can be used. This system supplies the priority load first,
then the non-priority load (Fig. 19-23).
the circuit breaker opens the line. Therefore, the trans-
fer switch must also withstand short-circuit loads.
Magnetic forces are so great during a short circuit
that they can cause the contacts of an inadequately
designed switch to open. Thus the switch must be able to
lock its contacts closed until the circuit breaker operates.
Tungsten lamps can draw up to 16 times more cur-
rent when they are cold. This means that a transfer
switch feeding power to tungsten lamps must be able to
handle this above-normal inrush current.
Motors can draw up to 15 times as much inrush
current on starting as when they are running and is
reconnected to a new normal or emergency source that
is not synchronized with the motor. This can happen if
the motor is as much as 1800 out of phase with the new
source (Fig. 19-22).

Electronic Loads
Almost every power system has some electronic load.
Increased automation and the economies of solid state
control suggest that even larger percentages of power
system loads will be electronic in the future. Typical
examples of electronic loads include data processing
equipment, intensive-care-unit monitoring equipment,
numerical control machinery, and security equipment.
There is virtually no commercial or industrial facility
in which electronic loads are not becoming a critical
part of the overall load profile.
Uninterruptible Power Systems
Electronic loads are very susceptible to voltage and fre-
quency variations. As a typical example, real-time
access computers require an ac power system that does
not deviate from nominal voltage by more than  8% or
less than 10%. Allowable frequency deviations are
typically 0.5 Hz. In addition to the deviation stated,
some data processing loads are affected by rate change
of deviation as well. To protect computer systems, unin-
terruptible power systems (UPS) have been developed.
Essentially, there are two types of UPS systems:
the motor-generator flywheel set and the static inverter
The priority load system operates the same as the
three-source system, with the following exceptions.
The first engine generator set to reach acceptable output
is connected to the emergency terminals of the auto-
matic transfer switch 1 (ATS 1) by ATS 2, which is a
six-pole, double-throw switch. The double-throw action
of ATS 2 simultaneously connects the emergency ter-
minals of ATS 3 to the other engine generator set.

When that set reaches acceptable output, ATS 3 trans-
fers the non-priority load to it. If the set carrying the pri-
ority load malfunction, ATS 2 transfers the other set to
the priority load. Other features built into the system
provide optimum protection for the non-priority load.
Systems for Paralleling Multiple
Power Sources
When it is necessary to start and parallel two or more
engine generator sets to supply emergency power on a
common bus, a system is needed that includes reverse
power monitors, synchronizers, load sequencers, and
other components to handle parallel-related operations.
A two-engine system is shown in Fig. 19-24. If the
normal source fails or drops below acceptable levels,
the controls start both engine generator sets. The first
to reach adequate output is put onto the emergency bus.
Assuming that ATS 1 is feeding the more critical load,
it will transfer its load to the emergency bus as soon as
the first engine is connected to the bus. When the other
set reaches adequate output, the controls bring into
synchronism with the first set, parallel it onto the same
bus, and ATS 2 transfers the secondary load. Furthermore,
the controls will operate to maintain power to the more
critical load as long as power is available from any
source.
Figure 19-25 shows a multiple-engine system.
Multiple-engine generator sets are used for various
reasons, such as economy, reliability, or to minimize
downtime. A multiple-engine system operates the same
way as a two-engine system with additional controls
to handle required number of engine generator sets.
Figure 19-26 shows a power control system.

Selective Load Transfer Systems
The selective load transfer system is dependable and
economical. It is also a limited supply of emergency
power to be channeled to selected loads one at a time.
Some of the applications for this system are: elevators,
production processes, multiple-pump systems in sewage
treatment plants, boiler feed-water pumps, HVAC chillers,
chilled-water circulating pumps, equipment bays, and
work-stations. 

automatically synchronized, paralleled, and run together
for a warm-up and stabilization period. Then the other
set is disconnected, cooled down, and turned off. There
is no interruption in power continuity during changeover.
If a set malfunctions while in service, the other is
started and put on line automatically. There will be
continuity of power for as long as it takes to start and
connect the idle engine—usually less than 10 seconds.
Multiple-Source Systems
Figure 19-29 shows a multiple-engine generator prime
power system. More than two engine generator sets
may be required, for reasons mentioned previously.
However, rarely do they require continuous operation
of all sets on line at the same time. Load requirements
vary throughout the day and with the season. Further-
more, fuel is saved and engine wear is reduced by oper-
ating only enough sets to carry the load and have some
on-line reserve capacity.
The system is most frequently applied to elevator
systems in both new construction and retrofit. In these
cases, one elevator at a time can be operated when nor-
mal power fails. It uses the minimum amount of auxil-
iary power for operation because the standby generator
can be sized for the necessary emergency load plus
only one elevator. Once the first elevator reaches the
main or selected floor, another elevator can be con-
nected to the emergency source. This sequence contin-
ues until all elevators have safely been brought down—
one at a time. Once the normal power is restored, all
elevators automatically resume normal operation.

transfer system.

PRIME MOVER SYSTEMS
To meet increased demands for clean and continuous
reliable electric power, many installations are being sup-
plied with on-site power generation. In some a cogener-
ation concept is employed where the heat from the
power sources is used for heating and air conditioning.
Prime mover systems can consist of any number of
engine generator sets. The number depends on the size
and number of loads, and other factors, depending on
individual applications. Basically, however, prime
power applications fall into two categories: two-engine
systems and multiple-engine systems.
Two-Source Systems
Figure 19-28 shows a two-engine prime mover system.
The prime mover system is similar to the two-engine
generator emergency system except that typically in
the prime power system either engine generator set can
supply the total load. As a rule the sets are alternated on
a weekly basis. That allows the idle set to be serviced
easily. Changeover from one set to another can be ini-
tiated manually or automatically. The idle set is started,
Systems are available to measure the kilowatt load
being drawn from the bus. They operate only the mini-
mum number of sets necessary to carry the load. If the
load increases, the controls start, synchronize, and par-
allel additional sets to meet it. If the load decreases, the
controls remove sets from the line, run them for a cool-
down period then turn them off.
When a running set malfunctions, the controls
disconnect it, shed an appropriate amount of load so
that the remaining sets are not overloaded, and start the

next idle set in turn. When its output is adequate and
synchronized, the set is paralleled onto the bus and the
shed load is reconnected. As a rule the total from mal-
functioning to reconnecting the shed load will not
exceed 10 seconds.
POWER MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
A cogeneration system is defined as any system where
a single source of thermal energy (fuel) drives two
processes, the second process being driven by waste
heat from the first process. Most power management
systems for cogeneration usually involve the recovery
and use of rejected heat (second process) produced in
the generation of electricity (first process).
The electrical generation portion of the cogenera-
tion system can operate in either of two ways: isolated
from the utility or in parallel with the utility. When
operating in parallel with the utility, the design must
incorporate protective relaying, as required in guide-
lines issued by the local utility, in addition to the
standard controls. Optimum cost-effectiveness, energy
conversion efficiency, and system performance are
achieved when the power management system operates
in parallel with the utility system. These systems incor-
porate control functions that cause the on-line engines
to produce only that amount of electricity which would
provide recoverable heat to satisfy the heat load demand.
Thus fuel consumption is minimized and efficiency is
maximized.
Figure 19-30 shows a typical cogeneration system.
Note that this diagram illustrates a cogeneration sys-
tem operating in parallel with the utility. The recover-
able heat may be applied to absorption chilling, as is
usually the case in commercial buildings. In industrial
buildings the recovered heat is more likely used for
process heat.
As indicated, co-generating systems require con-
trol functions in addition to those controls supplied as
standard in a prime power system. To ensure that these
system controls meet all the specialized requirements
of cogeneration, including operating in parallel with
the utility, contact the manufacturer of such systems
during the preliminary design stages for suggestions in
selecting appropriate controls and to assure proper
coordination.
Peak Load-Sharing Systems
Peak sharing systems (peaking systems) allow desig-
nated building loads to be powered by on-site power
generation whenever the building’s total load demand
exceeds a predetermined level. While an on-site gener-
ation system usually supplies emergency or standby
power as its major function, such a system can be mod-
ified with additional controls to provide peaking ser-
vice. These systems can be grouped into two categories:
(1) isolated from the utility service, or (2) paralleled
with the utility service.
Utility-Isolated Peaking Transfer
System
When on-site generation is isolated from the utility ser-
vice, it is necessary to include transfer switches for the
peaking loads (shown in PL in Fig. 19-31) when they
are not the emergency loads. The transfer switches
allow the designated peaking loads to draw power from
either the utility or the engine generators as a function
of total building demand. Only after the present level of
demand is reached are the designated loads transferred
to the generator sets. Thus the higher demand changes
are avoided. When building demand falls below the
retransfer level, the peak load is retransferred back to
the utility service and the engine generators are signaled
to shut down.

As in the peaking transfer system, interrupt logic
automatically suspends peak shaving upon loss of
power to the emergency loads. The operation of the
generator controls, however, is very different. The
governors and voltage regulators are controlled to
cause the engine generators to assume only that por-
tion of the load in excess of the demand limit, not a
fixed block of load as with peak transfer systems.
The engine generators continue to assume all load
in excess of the limit point and up to the capacity of
the engine generator sets. Any further excess after all
engine generators are carrying their rated load is
assumed by the utility. In this manner, the on-site-
generated kilowatt-hour value is minimized while

When two or more generator sets provide power in
a power management system, generators are brought
on-line only as required. When the demand limit from
the utility is exceeded, the first generator is started and
one of the peaking loads is transferred to it. If the limit
is again exceeded, the second generator is started, syn-
chronized, and paralleled with the first, and the second
peak load is transferred. This procedure can be repeated
until all on-site generation is on-line, provided that suf-
ficient peak loads are fed by transfer switches.
Priority interrupt logic is necessary in peak-shav-
ing transfer systems because peak loads are sometimes
not the same loads as emergency loads, as indicated in
Fig. 19-31. This interrupt logic automatically suspends
peak sharing upon sensing loads of adequate power to
emergency loads. The logic initiates the retransfer or
disconnect of the peak shaving loads from the standby
source to enable the immediate transfer of the emer-
gency loads to the standby source. The emergency
loads are supplied with power without the usually start-
up delay of the generator sets since these sets are
already up and on-line.
Utility-Paralleled Peaking
Systems
An optional form of peak sharing is shown in Fig. 19-32.
The on-site generation is paralleled with the utility. In
this case it is not necessary to designate particular loads
as peak loads and add peak-shaving transfer switches
since the utility and the standby generators share the
building load.

REVIEW PROBLEMS
Power factor plays an important role wherever electric
motors are connected to an ac line. The windings have
inductance and resistance. A quick review of the way
in which power factor is found mathematically will aid
in the understanding of why this unit keeps showing up
in the power calculations for motors. When reactance
and resistance both exist in an ac circuit, the phase
difference between the current and the voltage is no
longer 90° as it is with the reactance alone. It is some
quantity less than 90°. The phase angle (denoted by
Greek letter “theta,” ), which is the angular differ-
ence between the voltage and the current, can quickly
be converted to a power factor.

tance is 100  and the impedance is 100 ? What
does this condition represent?
2. What is the phase angle of a circuit if the resistance
is 100  and the impedance is 150 ?
3. If a resistor of 500  is placed in series with an
inductor of 1 H on a 120-V line with 60 Hz, what is
the phase angle?
4. What is the phase angle if the circuit is a series
combination of resistance (1000 ) and induc-
tance with an inductive reactance of 628  in a

are present?

There are 340 miles of transmission lines to inter-
connect this project with another at the dam on the

The generating section of the Robert Moses plant in
Niagara Falls consists of 13 unit blocks. Each of these
unit blocks consists of a Francis-type hydraulic (water-
driven) turbine rated at 200,000 hp at 300 ft net head.
The 150,000-kW generators operate at 120 rpm, three-

removable hatch covers, as can be seen in Fig. 20-1.
The crane travels along the top of them and can be posi-

SOURCES OF COMMERCIAL AC
The use of magnetism is the most common method of
generating electricity in large quantities for busi-
nesses, homes, industries, hospitals, and other insti-
tutions. A simple ac generator consists of a single
loop of wire wrapped around an iron core. As the
loop rotates and cuts lines of force, it has an EMF
induced in it according to the strength of the magnet
and the polarity of the lines being cut. This has been
discussed in chapter 19. What we are interested in
here is the way the ac is generated by large devices
called alternators. The alternators may be mounted
on poles and operated by wind. They may also be
used in automobiles and driven by the engine power-
ing the auto. In some instances the power is gener-
ated in ac form and converted to dc to charge
batteries and then converted to ac by electronics to
produce the correct frequency for operating commer-
cial and residential devices or excess energy may be
placed on a grid that serves a larger area than the
local source where generated.
Falling-Water Generators
The principle of electricity generation is the same
whether it uses mechanical energy produced by
gasoline or diesel engines, or falling water or
nuclear energy. The Niagara Power Project is an
example of falling water used to generate huge

furnace for burning coal, oil, or gas is replaced by a
reactor that contains a core of nuclear fuel. Energy is
produced in the reactor by a process called nuclear
fission. This fission process splits the center, or
nucleus, of certain atoms when they are struck by a
subatomic particle called neutron. The resulting frag-
ments, or fission products, then fly apart at great
speed, generating heat as they collide with surround-
ing matter.
Figure 20-3A shows the gas-cooled, fast-breeder
reactor used in some of today’s older nuclear plants.
Figure 20-3B shows the liquid-metal fast breeder
reactor used in some other types of generating
plants.
Fossil-Fuel Power Generators
Steam needed for driving turbines, which in turn drive
electric generators, must be produced by heat. The
method of heat production often becomes a rather dif-
ficult engineering problem. With the development of
some dependable sources of heat from fossil fuel, for-
mer design problems have been simplified. Almost any
substance may be used as a fuel. If it can be pulverized
and fed into a furnace with extremely high tempera-
tures it will burn (Fig. 20-4).

Switchyard
The Niagara switchyard is situated on a 35-acre site
south of the power canal, halfway between the
Robert Moses and Lewiston power plants. Purpose of
the switchyard is to collect and meter power from the
generators and send it out over transmission lines.
The switchyard has three voltage sections: 115,000,
230,000, and 345,000 V. Power enters the switchyard
from the Robert Moses plant through seven 115,000-
V cable circuits and six 230,000-V cable circuits.
The cables are installed in underground power tun-
nels. These cable circuits, 61,620 ft in length, are
filled with a total of 138,000 gal of a special insulat-
ing oil (Fig. 20-2). Electrical power leaves the
switchyard at 115,000, 230,000, and 345,000 V for
use in many locations in New York State and as far
north as Montpelier, Vermont. The power is gener-
ated at 13,800 V and stepped up by the generators
located nearby to 138,000 and 230,000 V before it is
sent to the switchyard.
Nuclear Power Generators
Nuclear plants are similar to the fossil-fuel burning
plants. The chief difference is in the way the heat is
generated, controlled, and used to produce steam to
run turbine generators. In a nuclear power plant, the

Electricity may be generated by fossil fuel-powered
generators, by atomic-powered generators, or by the
use of falling water. It is also possible to generate power
by engine-driven generators. In Alaska, for example,
where long distribution lines are impractical due to ice
and wind conditions that result in line damage, engine-
driven generators are common.
DISTRIBUTION
Once electricity is generated in sufficient amounts for
consumption in large quantities, the second necessary
step is to get the energy to the consumer. Herein lies a
distribution problem: that of stringing and maintaining
long lines (Fig. 20-6).
The best distribution system is one that will most
economically and safely supply adequate electric ser-
vice to both present and future probable loads. The best
system for a given building or industrial plant is one
that takes into consideration the needs and require-
ments of the electrical equipment. Various types of
systems have been designed to furnish the proper
power when-needed to different types of loads.
Types of Distribution Systems
The simplest type of system is the radial. However,
there are other modifications that have specific advan-
tages when special problems or situations are present.
In the great majority of cases, power is supplied to a
building at the utilization voltage. In practically all of
these cases, the distribution of power within the build-
ing is achieved through the use of a simple radial sys-
tem. In some cases where service is available at the
building at a voltage higher than the utilization voltage,
there are a number of systems that may be used. 
Simple Radial System
The conventional simple radial
system receives power at the utility supply voltage at a
single substation and steps the voltage down to the uti-
lization level. In some cases the utility supply is at the
utilization voltage, and the substation then becomes a
main distribution switchgear or switchboard.
332
Power Distribution Systems

An improved version of the simple radial system is
the modified modern simple radial system (Fig. 20-9).
In this arrangement one primary feeder is used per
transformer. The system is comparable in service con-
tinuity to the single substation form of the simple radial
system. This system arrangement is usually very
expensive. The cost can be materially reduced, how-
ever, by replacing automatic feeder circuit breakers
with load-break switches, fused or unfused, and back-
ing up a number of these switches with one automatic
circuit breaker.
Low-voltage feeder circuits run from the substation
bus to switchgear or switchboard assemblies and panel
boards that are located with respect to the loads as shown
in Fig. 20-7. Each feeder is connected to the substation
bus through a circuit breaker or other over current
protective device. Relatively small circuits are used to
distribute power to the loads from the switchgear or
switchboard assemblies and panel boards.
Distribution
333
Fig. 20-7
Conventional simple radial system. (Westinghouse)
The modern simple radial system is an improve-
ment over the simple radial system. It distributes power
at a primary voltage. The voltage is stepped down to
utilization level in the several load areas within the
building through power center transformers. The trans-
formers are usually connected to their associated load
bus through a circuit breaker (Fig. 20-8). Each power
center is a factory-assembled unit substation consisting
of a three-phase liquid-filled or air-cooled transformer,
an integrally mounted primary switch, and low-voltage
circuit breakers. Circuits are run to the load from these
circuit breakers.
Fig. 20-8
Modern simple-radial system. (Westinghouse)
Fig. 20-9
Modified modern simple-radial system. (Westinghouse)
In this system a primary feeder fault interrupts ser-
vice to all loads. Service can be restored to all loads
except those associated with the fault system element
by opening the load-break switch on the faulted circuit
and closing the circuit breaker. Service can be restored
to the remaining load when the necessary repairs are
made.
Loop Primary Radial System
This system is simi-
lar to the modern form of a simple radial system. It
provides for quick restoration of service when a pri-
mary feeder or transformer fault occurs, as does the
modified modern simple radial system shown in Fig.
20-9, but at a lower cost. A sectionalized primary
loop controlled by a single primary feeder breaker,
rather than a radial primary feeder, is shown in Fig.
20-10. 
Banked-Secondary Radial System
This system per-
mits quick restoration of service to all loads following
a primary feeder or transformer fault. It uses a sec-
ondary loop to provide an emergency supply when a
fault occurs in a transformer or a section of the primary
loop (Fig. 20-11).
The secondary loop gives a number of important
advantages other than providing an emergency supply to

restore service. It helps equalize the loads on all trans-
formers and thus makes it unnecessary to match the
transformer capacity at each load center to the load con-
nected to each load bus. This system is better adapted for
across-the-line starting of relatively large motors than is
any other type of radial system because the starting cur-
rent is supplied through several transformers in parallel
rather than through a single transformer. Thus if the
starting of large motors is involved, the use of this sys-
tem may result in a savings in the cost of motor starting
equipment. It is also the most satisfactory type of radial
system for combined light and power secondary circuits.
Primary-Selective Radial System
This type of sys-
tem uses at least two primary feeder circuits in each
load area (Fig. 20-12). It is designed so that when one
primary circuit is out of service, the remaining feeder
or feeders have sufficient capacity to carry the total
load. While three or more primary feeders may be
used, usually only two feeders are employed. Half of
the transformers are normally connected to each of two
feeders. When a fault occurs on one of the primary
feeders, only half of the load in the building is dropped.
In the systems discussed previously a primary feeder
fault causes an outage to all loads in the building. This
system is not as good as the banked-secondary radial
system from the standpoint of restoring service to the
loads after a primary feeder or transformer fault. It is
only a little better than the loop-primary radial system
in this respect. In some cases, particularly in fairly
large buildings, with medium- or light-load density,
about the same quality of service can be rendered at
less cost by using the loop primary radial system
employing two separate loops instead of one. In this
case, half of the transformers are connected to each
loop of the system.

instead of all the loads in the area. Both systems permit
quick restoration of service to all loads when a primary
feeder or transformer fault occurs. 
Modified Secondary-Selective Radial System
A
modified form of secondary-selective radial system
will often be less costly than the common form
described previously (Fig. 20-14). In this system
there is only one transformer at each load center,
instead of two. Pairs of adjacent load buses con-
nected by secondary cables or bus permit picking up
the load of any bus when a primary feeder or trans-
former fault occurs.
Secondary-Selective Radial System
This system uses
the same principle of duplication feed from the power
supply point as the primary-selective radial system. In
this system, however, the duplication is carried all the
way to each load bus on the secondary side of the trans-
formers instead of just to the primary terminals of the
transformers. This arrangement permits quick restora-
tion of service to all loads when a primary feeder or
transformer fault occurs, as does the banked-secondary
radial system.
The usual form of secondary-selective radial sys-
tem is shown in Fig. 20-13. Each load area in the build-
ing is supplied over two primary feeders and through
two transformers.
Distribution
335
Fig. 20-13
Secondary-selective radial system. (Westinghouse)
A bus-tie breaker is provided for connecting the
two secondary or load bus sections at each load center.
A primary feeder fault causes half of the load in the
building to be dropped.
A fault in a transformer causes the associated pri-
mary feeder breaker to trip and interrupts service to
half the building load. Service can be restored by
opening the disconnecting switch on the primary and
the circuit breaker on the secondary of the fault trans-
former, closing the associated bus-tie breaker, and
re-closing the primary feeder breaker. This manual
switching restores the system to normal operating
conditions except that the faulted transformer is 
de-energized and its load is being supplied through the
adjacent transformer.
From the standpoint of voltage fluctuation when a
load such as a relatively large motor is thrown on the sys-
tem, this system is not as good as the banked-secondary
radial system. The advantage that the secondary selec-
tive radial system offers over the banked-secondary
radial system is that a primary feeder or transformer
fault causes only one-half the load to be dropped
Fig. 20-14
Modified secondary-selective radial system.
(Westinghouse)
Each tie circuit is connected to each of its two load
buses through a secondary-tie circuit breaker. Each
secondary-tie breaker is interlocked so that it cannot
be closed unless one of the two transformer breakers is
open.
Basically, the single-transformer-substation form
of secondary-selective radial system, regardless of the
number and size of the transformers used, functions as
described in connection with the more usual form of
this system.
Simple Network System
The ac secondary network
system is the system that has been used for many years
to distribute electrical power in the high-density down-
town areas of cities. Modifications of this type of sys-
tem make it applicable to serve loads within buildings
(Fig. 20-15).
The best known advantage of the secondary net-
work system is continuity of service. No single fault
anywhere on the system will interrupt service to more
than a small part of the system load. Most faults will

be cleared automatically without interrupting service
to any load. Another outstanding advantage that the
network system offers is its flexibility to meet chang-
ing and growing load conditions at minimum cost and
with minimum interruption of service to the other
loads. In addition to flexibility and service reliability,
the secondary network system provides exceptionally
uniform and good voltage regulation, and its high effi-
ciency materially reduces the cost of losses.
The chief purpose of the secondary loop is to pro-
vide an alternative supply to any load bus when the pri-
mary feeder that normally supplies it is de-energized.
This prevents any service interruption when a trans-
former or feeder fault occurs. The secondary loop
makes it unnecessary to match the load supplied from
any load bus with the transformer capacity at that
point. Loads can be served from the loop at load buses
located between network transformers and the load cir-
cuits can be run directly to the loads from the nearest
load bus. This permits the use of very short radial cir-
cuits and results in considerable saving in secondary
cable and conduit compared with the load circuits of a
simple radial system. The voltage regulation on a net-
work system is such that both lights and power can be
fed from the same load bus. Much larger motors can be
started across the line than on a simple radial system.
This often results in greatly simplified motor control
and permits the use of relatively large low-voltage
motors with their less expensive control.
To obtain satisfactory selectivity between limiters
under all fault conditions, a minimum of two similar
single-conductor cables per phase should be used in the
secondary loop. When a fault occurs on a primary
feeder or in a transformer, the fault is isolated from the
system through automatic tripping of the primary
feeder circuit breaker and all of the network protectors
associated with that feeder circuit. This operation does
not interrupt service to any load. When the necessary
repairs have been made, the system is restored to nor-
mal operating condition by closing the feeder circuit
breaker. All network protectors associated with that
feeder will close automatically.
The simple spot-network system resembles the
secondary-selective radial system in that each load
area is supplied over two or more primary feeders
through two or more transformers. In this system,
however, the transformers are connected through
network protectors to a single load bus, as shown in
Fig. 20-16.
336
Power Distribution Systems
Fig. 20-15
Simple network system. (Westinghouse)
Fig. 20-16
Simple spot-network system. (Westinghouse)
Simple spot-network systems are more economi-
cal than other forms of network systems for buildings
where there are heavy concentrations of load covering
small areas, with considerable distances between these
concentrations and very little load in areas between
them. They are commonly used in high-rise office
buildings. The chief disadvantage of these systems is
that, they are not nearly as flexible for growing and
shifting loads as are the other forms of network sys-
tems. Simple spot-network systems are used where a
high degree of service continuity is required, flexibil-
ity is of minor importance, and their cost is less than
the network systems using a secondary loop. The sim-
ple spot-network system is most economical where
three or more primary feeders are required. This is
because supplying each load bus through three or more
transformers greatly reduces the spare cable and trans-
former capacity that is required.
Primary-Selective Network
This is the most gener-
ally applicable and widely used form of industrial
secondary network system. Each transformer in the
primary-selective network system is equipped with a
primary selector switch arrangement (Figs. 20-17
and 20-18).

network transformers are normally connected to each
primary feeder.
A primary feeder fault causes the faulty feeder and
its transformers to be disconnected from the system by
automatic operation of the primary feeder breaker and
associated network protectors. The entire building load is
then carried over the remaining primary feeder and one-
half of the network transformers. The transformers asso-
ciated with the faulty feeder can be connected to the good
feeder by manually operating their selective selector
switches. This relieves the overload on the transformers
normally associated with the good feeder.
A transformer fault is isolated from the system by
operation of the primary feeder breaker and the network
protectors associated with the primary feeder. The defec-
tive transformer can be disconnected from the primary
feeder by opening its selector switch. The feeder and its
good transformer can be returned to service immedi-
ately. A primary feeder or transformer fault will not
cause any interruption of service to the load.
As with the simple network system, the primary
selective network may also take the form of a spot-
network system. Each transformer in the primary-
selective network system is equipped with a primary
selector switch and arranged for connection to either of
two primary feeders (Fig. 20-20). This largely elimi-
nates the necessity for spare transformer capacity and
the system is ordinarily designed without providing for
such capacity.
Two primary feeders are run to each transformer as
shown in Fig. 20-19. In a building requiring two primary
feeders, each feeder must be capable of supplying the
entire load in the building. Each transformer is con-
nected to a load bus through a network protector. The
radial circuits serving the loads are connected to the load
bus through circuit breakers or fused switches. A sec-
ondary loop, such as is used in the banked-secondary
radial and the simple network systems, connects each
load bus to the two adjacent load buses. One half of the

SYSTEMS ANALYSIS
A major consideration in the design of a distribution
system is to ensure that it provides the required quality
of service to the various loads. This includes serving
each load under normal conditions and under abnor-
mal conditions providing the desired protection to service
the system apparatus so that the interruptions of ser-
vice are minimized consistent with good economic
and mechanical design. Short-circuit currents and fault
currents are to be considered in any system.

Short-Circuit Currents
The amount of current available in a short-circuit fault
is determined by the capacity of the system voltage
sources and impedances of the system, including the
fault. Constituting voltage sources are the power sup-
ply (utility or on-site generation) plus all rotating
machines connected to the system at the time of the
fault. A fault may be either an arcing or bolted fault. In
all arcing faults, part of the circuit voltage is consumed
across the fault and the total fault current is somewhat
smaller than for a bolted fault, so the latter condition is
the value sought in the fault calculations.
Basically, the short-circuit current is determined by
Ohm’s law except that the impedance is not constant
since some reactance is included in the system. The effect
of reactance in an ac system is to cause the initial current
to be high and then decay toward a steady-state or Ohm’s
law value. The fault current consists of an exponentially
decreasing direct-current component superimposed on a
decaying alternating current. The rate of decay of both
the dc and ac components depends on the ratio of reac-
tance to resistance, X/R, of the circuit. The greater this
ratio, the longer the current remains higher than the
steady state that it would eventually reach.
Fault Currents
The calculation of asymmetrical currents is a laborious
procedure since the degree of asymmetry is not the
same on all three phases. It is common practice to cal-
culate the rms symmetrical fault current, with the
assumption being made that the dc component has
decayed to zero, and then apply a multiplying factor to
obtain the first half-cycle rms asymmetrical current,
which is called the momentary current.
To determine motor contribution to the first half-
cycle fault current when the system motor load is
known, the following assumptions generally are made:
1. 208Y/120-V systems:
a. Assume 50% lighting and 50% motor load.
b. Assume motor feedback contribution of twice
full-load current of transformer.
2. 240/480/600-V three-phase, three wire systems:
a. Assume 100% motor load.
b. Assume motor feedback contribution of four
times full-load current of transformer.
3. 480Y/277-V systems in commercial buildings:
a. Assume 50% motor load.
b. Assume 100% induction motors.
c. Assume motor feedback contribution of two times
full-load current of transformer source.
4. For industrial plants, make same assumptions as for
three-phase, three-wire systems.
Three-Phase Power
Three-phase power can be generated by a wye-
connected generator or a delta-connected generator.
Instead of having six leads come out of the three-phase
ac generator, one of the leads from each phase can be
connected to form a common junction. The stator is
then called a wye. Sometimes the wye connection is
also called a star connection. Tire common lead may
not be brought out of the generator. If it is brought out,
it is called the neutral (Fig. 20-21). If the wye connec-
tion has the neutral brought out of the generator, it is
called a four-wire, three-phase system.

Single-phase voltage from a wye connection.
The wye connection provides 1.73 times the phase
voltage for any two of the three wires connected. The
line currents are equal to the current in any phase wind-
ing. The advantage of a wye connection is its ability to
produce more voltage. Note in Fig. 20-21 that windings
1 and 2 are in series with each other. Windings 2 and 3
are in series with each other also. If windings 1 and 3 are
used for connections, they, too, are in series. Thus no
matter which connections are used, there are two coils in
series to produce the single-phase power needed. The
current provided, however, is as in any series connection.
It is that which can be provided by only one winding.

erator is the same as that of a delta-connected genera-
tor. The total true power is

The delta connection provides 1.73 times the phase

duce more current. Note that winding 1 is in parallel with
windings 2 and 3, and windings 2 and 3 are in series with

the advantage. With the wye connection, voltage is the
advantage. In summary, the delta connection produces
line voltage equal to the phase voltage and the line current
equal to the square root of 3 or 1.73 times the phase cur-
rent. True power is the same in the delta connection as in
the wye connection. In both cases it is merely a matter of
multiplying the line current times the line voltage times
the 1.73 factor and the cosine of the angle .
MEASUREMENT OF POWER
The wattmeter connections for measuring the true power
in a three-phase system are shown in Fig. 20-23. The
method shown in Fig. 20-23A uses three wattmeters with
their current coils inserted in series. The line wires and
their potential coils are connected between line and
neutral wires. The total true power is equal to the arith-
metic sum of the three wattmeter readings.
each other. This produces the output labeled C. Winding 2
is in parallel with windings 1 and 3, and windings 1 and 3
are in series with each other. They produce output A.
Winding 3 is in parallel with windings 1 and 2, and windings
1 and 2 are in series with each other. This combination
produces output B. With delta connection, the current is

In Fig. 20-23B two wattmeters are used with their
potential coils connected between these line wires and
the common or third wire that does not contain the cur-
rent coils. The total true power is equal to the algebraic
sum of the two wattmeter readings. If one meter reads
backward, its potential coil connections are reversed.
Note the polarity indications placed there to prevent
incorrect connections. The incorrect connection causes
the meter to read up-scale. The total true power is then
equal to the difference in the two wattmeter readings. If
the load power factor is less than 0.5 and the loads are
balanced, the true power will equal the difference
between the two wattmeter readings. If the load power
factor is 0.5, one meter will indicate zero. If the load
factor is above 0.5, the total true power is the sum of
the two wattmeter readings.
TRANSFORMERS
Transformers are important in any power distribution
system. A quick review of their basic principles will
aid in understanding their use in various parts of a dis-
tribution system.
A transformer is a device that has no moving parts.
It transfers energy from one circuit to another by elec-
tromagnetic induction. The energy is always trans-
ferred without a change in frequency. 
Usually, changes in voltage and current are evi-
dent. A step-up transformer receives electrical energy
at one voltage and delivers it at a higher voltage. Con-
versely, a step-down transformer receives energy at one
voltage and delivers it at a lower voltage. Transformers
require little care and maintenance because they are
simple, rugged, and durable in construction. Since there
are no moving parts, there is little to wear out. The effi-
ciency can be more than 99%.
Transformers are responsible for the use of ac today
in every phase of life.
Transformer Construction
A transformer in its simplest form has two windings
insulated electrically from each other. These windings
are wound on a common magnetic circuit built of lam-
inated steel sheet. The principal parts are the following:
1. Core: provides a circuit of low reluctance for the
magnetic flux
2. Primary winding: receives the energy from the ac source
3. Secondary winding: receives the energy by mutual
induction from the primary and delivers it to the load
4. Enclosure: prevents damage when the transformer
is overloaded
When a transformer is used to step up voltage, the
low-voltage winding is the primary. When a trans-
former is used to step down the voltage, the high-volt-
age winding is the primary. The primary is always
connected to the source of the power. The secondary, is
always connected to the load. It is common practice to
refer to the windings as the primary and secondary
rather than the high-voltage and low-voltage windings.
The principal types of transformer construction
are the core type and the shell type. Figure 20-24
shows the two types. The cores are built of thin stamp-
ings of silicon steel called laminations. Eddy currents
are generated in the core by the alternating flux as it
cuts through the iron. These currents are minimized by
using the thin laminations with insulating varnish. 
Hysteresis losses are caused by the friction devel-
oped between magnetic particles as they rotate through
each cycle of magnetization. These losses are mini-
mized by using a special grade of heat-treated grain
oriented silicon-steel laminations.
In the core-type transformer, the copper windings sur-
round the laminated iron core. In the shell-type transformer
the iron core surrounds the copper windings. Distribution
transformers are generally of the core type. Some of the
largest power transformers are of the shell type.
If the windings of a core-type transformer were
placed on separate legs of the core, a relatively large
amount of flux produced by the primary windings
would fail to link the secondary winding. This would
cause a large leakage flux. The effect of the leakage
flux would be to increase the leakage reactance drop,
340

Three-Phase Transformer
Connections
Power may be supplied through three-phase circuits
containing transformers in which the primaries and
secondaries are connected in various wye and delta
combinations. For example, three single-phase trans-
formers may supply three-phase power with four pos-
sible combinations of their primaries and secondaries.
Possible combinations are:
1. Primaries in delta and secondaries in delta 
2. Primaries in wye and secondaries in wye 
3. Primaries in wye and secondaries in delta 
4. Primaries in delta and secondaries in wye
If the primaries of three single-phase transformers
are properly connected (either in wye or delta) to a
three-phase source, the secondaries may be connected
in delta (Fig. 20-26). A topographic vector diagram of
the three-phase voltages is shown in Fig. 20-26A. The
vector sum of these three voltages is zero. This can be
seen by combining any two vectors. For example,
check EA and EB. Note that their sum is equal and oppo-
site to the third vector, EC. A voltmeter inserted within
the delta will indicate zero voltage (Fig. 20-26B).
Assuming that all three transformers have the same
polarity, the delta connection consists of the X2 lead of
winding A to the X1 lead of B, the X2 lead of B to X1
of C, and the X2 lead of C to X1 of A. If any one of the
three windings is reversed with respect to the other two
windings, the total voltage within the delta will equal
XI, in both windings. To reduce the leakage flux and
reactance drop, the windings are subdivided. Half of
each winding is placed on each leg of the core. The
windings may be cylindrical in form and placed one
inside the other with the necessary insulation. The low-
voltage winding is placed with a large part of its sur-
face area next to the core. The high-voltage winding is
placed outside the low-voltage winding to reduce the
insulation requirements of the two windings. If the
high-voltage winding were placed next to the core, two
layers of high-voltage insulation would be required.
One would be needed next to the core; the other would
be needed between the two windings. In another
method, the windings are built up in thin flat sections
called pancake coils. The pancake coils are sandwiched
together with the required insulation between them.
The complete core and coil assembly is placed
inside a set of steel covers or a steel tank (Fig. 20-25B).
In commercial transformers, the complete assembly is
usually immersed in a special mineral oil. This oil pro-
vides a means of insulation and cooling. No oil is used
in the transformer enclosures shown in Fig. 20-25A.
This type requires air circulation to keep it cool.
Transformers are built in both single-phase and
three-phase units. A three-phase transformer consists
of separate insulated windings for the different phases.
The windings are wound on a three-legged core capa-
ble of establishing three magnetic fluxes displaced
120 in time phase. Three-phase transformers are not
used in locations where the operation of a single unit
may affect the others.

twice the value of one phase. If the delta is closed on
itself, the resulting current will be of short-circuit mag-
nitude. The result is damage to the transformer wind-
ings and cores. The delta should never be closed until a
test is made to determine that the voltage within the
delta is zero or nearly zero. This may be done with a
voltmeter, fuse wire, or a test lamp. In Fig. 20-26B,
when the voltmeter is inserted between the  X2 lead of
A and the X1 lead of B, the delta circuit is completed
through the voltmeter. The indication should be
approximately zero. Then the delta is completed by
connecting the X2 lead of A to the X1 lead of B.
If the three secondaries of an energized transformer
bank are properly connected in delta and are supplying
a balanced three-phase load, the line current will be
equal to 1.73 times the phase current. If the rate current
of a phase (winding) is 100 A, the rated line current will
be 173 A. If the rated voltage of a phase is 120 V, the
voltage between any two line wires will be 120 V.
The three secondaries of the transformer bank may
be reconnected in wye to increase the output voltage.
The voltage vectors are shown in Fig. 20-26C. If the
phase voltage is 120 V, the line voltage will be 1.73
times 120  208 V. The line voltages are represented
by vectors, E1,2, E2,3, and E3,1. A voltmeter test for
the line voltage is represented in Fig. 20-26D. If the
three transformers have the same polarity, the proper
connections for a wye-connected secondary bank are

transformers. These transformers will maintain the cor-
rect voltage and phase relations on the secondary to
supply a balanced three-phase load. An open delta con-
nection is shown in Fig. 20-28. The three-phase source
supplies the primaries of the two transformers. The
secondaries supply a three-phase voltage to the load.
The line current is equal to the transformer phase cur-
rent in the open-delta connection. In the closed-delta
connection,

. Thus when one transformer is removed
from a delta-connected bank of three transformers, the
remaining two transformers will carry a current to
. This value amounts to an overload current on
each transformer of 1.73 times the rated current, or an
overload of 73.2%.
Thus to prevent overloading transformers in an
open-delta connection, the line current must be reduced

indicated in the figure. The X1 leads are connected to
form a common or neutral connection. The X2 leads of
the three secondaries are brought out to the line leads.
If the connections of any one winding are reversed, the
voltages between the three line wires will become
unbalanced. Thus the loads will not receive their proper
magnitude of load current. Also, the phase angle
between the line currents will be changed. They will no
longer be 120 out of phase with each other.
Therefore, it is important to connect the trans-
former secondaries correctly to preserve the symmetry
of the line voltages and currents.
Transformer installations with both primary and
secondary windings delta connected are shown in
Fig. 20-27. The H1 lead of one phase is always con-
nected to the H2 lead of an adjacent phase. The X1 lead
is connected to the X2 terminal of the corresponding
adjacent phase, and so on. The line connections are
made at these junctions. This arrangement assumes that
the three transformers have the same polarity.
An open-delta connection results when any one of
the three transformers is removed from the delta con-
nected transformer bank without distributing the three-
wire, three-phase connections to the remaining two

so that the rated current of the individual transformers
is not exceeded. The open-delta connection results in a
reduction in system capacity. The full-load capacity in
a delta connection at unit power factor is:
In an open-delta connection, the line current is lim-
ited to the rate phase current of 
. The full load
capacity of the open-delta or V-connected system is
The ratio of the load that can be carried by two
transformers connected in open-delta to the load that
can be carried by three transformers in closed-delta is
or 57.7% of the closed-delta rating.
For example, a 150-kW, three-phase balanced load
operating at unity power factor is supplied at 250 V.
The rating of each of three transformers in closed delta
is 150/3  50 kW. The phase current is 50,000/250 

Three single-phase transformers with both primary
and secondary windings wye-connected are shown in
Fig. 20-29A. Only 57.7% of the line voltage 
is impressed across each winding. But full line current
flows in each transformer winding. Three-phase trans-
formers delta-connected to the primary circuit and wye-
connected to the secondary circuit are shown in Fig. 20-30.
This connection provides four-wire, three-phase service
with 208 V between lines wires ABC. There is
or 120 V between each line wire and neutral, N.
The wye-connected secondary is desirable when
a large number of single-phase loads are to be supplied
from a three-phase transformer bank. The neutral, or
grounded wire is brought out from the midpoint of the
wye connection. This permits the single-phase loads to
be distributed evenly across the three phases; and three-
phase loads can be connected directly across the line
wires. The single-phase loads have a voltage rating of
120 V. The three-phase loads are rated at 208 V. This
connection is often used in high-voltage power supply
transformers for radar installations. The phase volt-
age is 1/1.73, or 0.577 (57.7%) of the line voltage.
Three single-phase transformers with wye-con-
nected primaries and delta-connected secondaries are
shown in Fig. 20-31. This arrangement is used for
stepping down the voltage from approximately 4000 V
between line wires on the primary side to either 115
or 230 V, depending on whether the secondary wind-
ings of each transformer are connected in parallel,
and the secondary output voltage is 115 V. There is
an economy in transmission with the primary in wye.
The line voltage is 73% higher than the phase volt-
age, and the line current is accordingly less. Thus
line losses are reduced and the efficiency of trans-
mission is improved.
SWITCHING
Electrical distribution systems are often quite compli-
cated. They cannot be made absolutely fail safe. Circuits
are subject to destructive over currents. Harsh environ-
ments, general deterioration, accidental damage from
natural causes, excessive expansion, and overloading
of the electrical distribution system are factors that
contribute to the occurrence of such over currents.
Reliable protective devices prevent or minimize costly
damage to transformers, conductors, motors, and many
other components and loads that make up the complete
distribution system. Reliable circuit protection is essen-
tial to avoid the severe momentary losses that can result
from power blackouts and prolonged downtime of facil-
ities. Switching is one of the means utilized to be able
to disable a circuit while the fuses or circuit breakers

Automatic Emergency 
Power Switching
When the utility power or the normal source fails, controls
for automatic handling of the emergency power and the
restoration of utility power are needed (Fig. 20-32). Con-
trols are needed to start the engine and transfer the loads
to the generator when it reaches proper voltage and fre-
quency. Then, when the utility power is restored, the con-
trols are needed to sense that power is restored and a need
to retransfer the loads to the utility is evident. Allowing
the engine to cool off before shutting down also needs to
be handled automatically. The basic controls needed to
accomplish this job are shown in Fig. 20-32.
All the abbreviations are defined below for ease in
understanding some of the complexity of a system with
an automatic emergency power source.
ATS (Automatic Transfer Switch): switches the loads
from the utility power (normal source) when it fails,
to the engine generator (emergency source). Then
retransfers the loads back to the utility when its
power is restored. Switching is done automatically
at the proper times under the supervision of the
appropriate sensors, time delays and relays.
ECC (Engine Control Contact): closes when the
normal source fails and thereby initiates engine
operation through the Automatic Engine-Starting
Controls (AESC).
ECO (Engine Control Contact): opens when the nor-
mal source fails. This may be used to trigger the
AESCs, depending on the type of controls being used.
FSE (Frequency Sensor, Emergency): senses the fre-
quency of the power from the engine generator.
PAP (Pre-alarm Panel): alerts personnel that engine
oil pressure is dropping or that water temperature is
rising before they reach a critical point. This panel
also indicates low fuel level, low water temperature.
In addition, it shows the system status and sounds an
alarm when the engine is shut down from over
crank, over speed, low oil pressure, and high water
temperature.
RAP (Remote Alarm Panel): located in an occupied
area such as the maintenance engineer’s, or building
security office, this panel alerts personnel who are
not in the vicinity of the power system and engine of
the status of the complete system.
SLG (Signal Light, Green): when lighted, indicates
that the automatic transfer switch is connected to the
utility (normal source).
SLR (Signal Light, Red): when lighted, indicates that
the automatic transfer switch is connected to the
engine-generator set (emergency source).
TDC (Time Delay, Cool-down): delays the engine
from shutting down immediately when the load is
retransferred to allow the engine to cool down from
operating temperature.
TDE (Time Delay, Emergency): delays the transfer
switch from switching loads from the failed utility
to the engine generator. This delay is usually set at
zero unless there is more than one transfer switch
handling loads for one engine generator; in which
case, you may want to set the time delays so that all
switches do not transfer their loads at the same
time. 
346
Power Distribution Systems
Fig. 20-32
Basic controls needed to handle a power failure and restoration. (Automatic Switch)

In addition to the items mentioned above, which
are basic for a reliable automatic emergency power
control system, other lights, meters, and specialized
accessories may be added, depending on the installa-
tion. Accessories may include additional time delays,
manual controls, engine-generator control accessories,
and indicators. However, the items listed, if properly
designed and coordinated, will provide reliable control
for automatic transfer of two sources of power: one
normal, the other emergency. Figure 20-33 has all the
controls necessary to handle a power failure and
restoration in a facility having one normal and one
emergency source of power. One enclosure houses all
the controls for switching purposes.
It is important to test and inspect the automatic,
transfer switch because it is the heart and brains of the
emergency power system. It senses the power failure,
signals the engine to start, transfers the loads and then
retransfers the load back to normal, and shuts down the
engine. If the automatic transfer switch fails, nothing
else in the system will respond to the need.
However, in hospitals and other facilities where an
uninterrupted supply of power is vital to human life—
places where the automatic transfer switches must be
periodically tested—there is reluctance to do so because
maintenance personnel do not want to interrupt the power
even momentarily. For facilities such as these where
power interruption and downtime cannot be tolerated,
an automatic transfer and bypass isolation switch
(Fig. 20-34) solves the problem. The automatic transfer and
isolation switch unit goes into the same location in the
electrical circuit as the automatic transfer switch
(Fig. 20-35).
TDN (Tune Delay, Normal): delays starting the
engine when the utility power dips momentarily,
then comes back up. This time delay avoids nuisance
starts on the engine.
TDR (Time Delay, Retransfer): delays the transfer
switch from retransferring the loads from the genera-
tor (emergency source) back to the utility (normal
source) as soon as the utility power has been restored.
This delay gives the utility time to establish itself.
T’NS (Test Normal Switch): simulates a failure of the
utility power. When this switch is operated, the
engine generator starts and runs. Then the transfer
switch transfers the loads to the engine generator at
the proper time. After a prescribed amount of
engine-running time determined by the TDR setting,
the transfer switch retransfers the loads back to the
utility power and shuts down the engine. If it is
important that loads not be interrupted when testing,
a combination automatic transfer and bypass-isola-
tion switch should be used.
VSE (Voltage Sensor, Emergency): senses when the
engine generator is producing acceptable voltage,
and if the frequency (see FSE) is also acceptable,
signals the transfer switch to transfer the loads to
the generator.
VSN (Voltage Sensor, Normal): senses when the util-
ity power (normal source) drops below an acceptable
value on any phase and, through the ECC, triggers
the engine-starting controls. Also senses when the
utility power is again acceptable and signals the
transfer switch to return the loads back to the
restored utility. Then signals the engine controls to
begin cooldown and shutdown.

Switchboards
There are a number of manufacturers of switchboards.
Each does the same thing but in a slightly different
way. Square D switchboards with 200,000-A short-
circuit rating are referred to as QMB. This type of
switchboard uses fusible switches. The switches are of
modular design (Fig. 20-36). Red and black operating

These switches are rated from 30 to 800 A. Switch-
boards are shown in Fig. 20-37. Circuit breaker units
for motor starter applications are available with either
thermal-magnetic circuit breakers or magnetic trip cir-
cuit breakers (Fig. 20-38).
Motor starter centers are available for 120 to 600 V
with reversing or nonreversing types. They have push-
buttons, pilot lights, control voltage transformers, and
fuse blocks (Fig. 20-39).

purpose is to distribute the power to the motor or device
that needs it and do the job without exposing people or
equipment to the dangers of high voltage and high-cur-
rent-carrying cables.
Aluminum Lay-In Wall Duct and
Floor Trench Duct
Evolving technology in medical care facilities has
identified the need for a nonferrous raceway system.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic
procedure that utilizes a magnetic field rather than 
x-rays. Because the equipment uses magnets, it is impor-
tant that all or as much ferrous material as possible be
eliminated from the room (Fig. 20-42). These rooms
will normally utilize a raised floor in areas with the
magnetic and electronic equipment. Along with the
raised floor, cables must be routed back to control
rooms. This can be accomplished with aluminum con-
duit, but aluminum lay-in wall duct and in some cases
aluminum floor trench are preferred.
Cable Tray
An economical raceway system designed to support
and protect electrical wire and cable is available in alu-
minum and two types of galvanized steel for outdoor
or indoor applications (Fig. 20-43).
Cable trays are not raceways. They are covered by

can be routed and used to support heavy cables. The

aluminum, or a suitable nonmetallic material. They are
used in buildings to route cables and support them out
of the way of normal building activities. A strong,
sturdy support for cables is provided through troughs

to accommodate all changes of direction or quantity of
cables. They are usually made of aluminum or zinc-
coated steel.
Trough-type trays protect cables from damage and
give good support and ample ventilation. Solid bottom
fittings generally create no ventilation problems since
they are a small part of the system. Cables are ade-
quately ventilated through straight sections.
Ladder trays provide maximum ventilation to
power cables and other heat-producing cables. How-
ever, cables are vulnerable to damage and covers are
available. Various parts are needed to support the trays
and covers (Fig. 20-45). Cables suitable for use in
cable trays are marked CT (cable tray) on the outside of
the jacket.
The cable system must be complete. It must be
used as a complete system of straight sections, angles,
offsets, saddles, and other associated parts to form a
cable support system that is continuous and grounded
as required by the NEC in Section 318-6(a). The sys-
tem must be grounded as any raceway system must
also be grounded. The Code treats the cable tray as a
raceway and a wiring method. Limitations are placed
on the number, size, and placement of conductors
inside the tray. These limitations can be obtained by
checking the Code.

NEMA PLC Definition
The National Electrical Manufacturers Association
gives the following definition for a programmable-
logic controller (PLC): a digitally operating electronic
apparatus which uses a programmable memory for the
internal storage of instructions for implementing specific
functions such as logic, sequencing, timing, counting
and arithmetic to control, through digital or analog
input/output modules, various types of machines or
processes.
SOLID-STATE ELECTRONICS
Solid-state electronics have gradually been making the
control of motors easier and predictable in terms of
load requirements and changes in loads. Electronics
devices have been used to detect phase failure, phase
reversals, open circuits, and short circuits. Electronic
devices have also been used to provide reduced starting
current and high starting torque. They also reduce the
voltage to lightly loaded motors. Reducing the voltage
in these applications can save energy.
Typical applications for controllers are in motors
used in food-processing facilities, beverage bottling
facilities, textile machinery, cranes, belt-driven equip-
ment, conveyors, general machinery, materials handling
facilities, compressors, machine tools, woodworking
equipment, and water treatment facilities. Figure 21-1
shows a solid-state ac motor control circuitry. Note the
control logic and overload protection module. This
type of electronics is utilized in the soft start and volt-
age reduction during light-loads situations.
The conversion of the fixed-frequency input to an
adjustable-frequency output is also possible using elec-
tronics for adjustable-frequency drives. The rectifier con-
verts incoming ac supply voltage to a fixed-potential
dc bus level. The dc voltage is in turn inverted by a
three-phase, pulse-width modulated (PWM) inverter
section to an adjustable-frequency output whose volt-
age is also adjusted proportionately to the frequency to
provide constant voltage per hertz excitation to the
motor terminals up to 60 Hz. Above 60 Hz, the voltage
remains constant at nominal motor full voltage rating.
In this way energy-efficient speed control is obtained
in the range from 6 to 120 Hz.
Standard Electronic Features
in Controls
Some of the standard protective features provided by
electronics circuitry are instantaneous power failure
protection. The controller trips if power outage exceeds
15 milliseconds. Electronic instantaneous over current
protection, inverse time overload protection, and under
voltage protection are provided by electronics. DC bus
overload protection and controller over temperature
protection are provided by electronics. Torque (current)
limit protect, if necessary, is automatically extended to
accelerate or decelerate. When running under stated
state conditions, current limit will reduce output fre-
quency when the adjustable value is exceeded. Elec-
tronic ground-fault protection is also available in the
package. Surge protection from input ac line transients

Interfacing
Interfacing is used to describe what happens when the
controller communicates with the motor it is control-
ling and the switches or sensing devices that sense
require information needed for the process to be com-
pleted. The programmable controller is able to commu-
nicate with the rest of the equipment around it by being
connected through ports. It is necessary to input infor-
mation to the controller and it is necessary to receive
information from the controller after it has processed it
according to its program.
In some instances the programmable controller can be
programmed using a computer keyboard and the informa-
tion can be displayed on a cathode ray tube (CRT) and
checked for accuracy before being stored in the controller’s
memory. LCD displays are also available.
ASCII Code
Digital information is processed and communicated by
using the ASCII code (Table 21-1). To communicate
with the controller, it is necessary to be able to input
instructions to the microprocessor or chip that makes
up the processing unit. A special code has been
designed so that the regular typewriter type of key-
board can be used to type in instructions. However, the
keys of the keyboard are switches and they send a pulse
to a decoder which generates a special binary code.
That code is most often the American Standard Code
for Information Interchange (ASCII).
is provided by a snubber network and electrical isola-
tion is provided between the power and the logic cir-
cuits. All this and more can be accomplished by a
programmable controller.
THE PROGRAMMABLE
CONTROLLER
The programmable controller (PLC)* is made up of
a power supply, a processor unit, and I/O modules.
Figure 21-2 shows a block diagram of a programmable
controller system. The inputs can be a keyboard or
limit switches, pressure switches, thermostats, or any
number of devices that can provide an on-off status.
The controller has a memory so that it can be pro-
grammed and can retain the information presented to it
and compare it to what has been programmed and then
make a decision and send the required signal by way of
the output modules to the motor it is controlling.
Input-Output
The connections that interface with the outside world
of the programmable controller are called input-output
(I/O) ports. The input port allows data from a keyboard
or other input device to be taken into the controller. The
output port is used to send data to an output device
such as a motor. Bus lines carry the signals to and from
the major parts of the system.
The Programmable Controller

Block diagram for PLC system, including I/0s.
*Inasmuch as you see the abbreviation PC used to mean personal
computer it is now suggested that PLC (for programmable logic
controller) be used for programmable controller to differentiate it
from the PC.

358
Programmable Controllers
The ASCII code is made up of seven binary bits, so
there are 128 possible combinations. This is obtained
when you take 2 to the seventh power (27). The 128 (27)
possible combinations of 1’s and 0’s can represent all
the letters of the alphabet, both upper and lower case,
as well as the numbers 0 through 9 and several special
codes that include punctuation and machine control
information.
Parallel Ports
Parallel ports are the outputs of the microprocessor or
computer. The parallel port has a flat cable connected
to it with eight conductors. Seven of these wires or con-
ductors carry the information just mentioned. The
eighth conductor carries the strobe line, the line that
prevents the problem of switch bounce. When a switch
is closed it also bounces or allows more than the on and
off information to be given. It is necessary to eliminate
this noise or incorrect signal information from being
transmitted from the keyboard to the controller and
then to the motor. It may cause the motor to make some
incorrect on-off moves.
Serial Ports
The serial format may also be used to transmit data in
the ASCII code. The serial format allows the informa-
tion to be transmitted along two wires. This is very
convenient when transmitting over long distances. The
parallel format is very good for short distances or con-
nection between machines with the same work cell, but
if the information has to be sent for a greater distance,
it is better to send it by serial formatting.
The information may be transmitted as changes in
voltage or changes in current. There are standards for
both. In fact, there are two standards for each. The two
voltage standards are known as RS-232C and TTL.
The two current standards are the 60-mA current loop
and the 20-mA current loop. As you can see, the raw
data or the 20-mA is not enough to operate a motor, so
it must be used to control a circuit that will turn the
motor on and off.
The RS-232C standard says that the voltage of the
signal will be between –3 and –25 V to represent the
logic 1 or “on” condition. A voltage between 3 and
25 V is used to represent the logic 0 or “off” position.
This standard was developed by the Electronic Indus-
try Association (EIA). There is an advantage to this
standard inasmuch as the line noise will have to be very
high to make any false signals and the voltage losses
along the line will not affect the signal level as much as
lower voltages do. It does have a disadvantage, inas-
much as it has to be converted to transistor-transistor
logic (TTL) at the port of the computer or micro-
processor.
The TTL standard specifies that 5 V presents a
logic 1 and 0 represents a logic 0. TTL standard is com-
patible with TTL logic and interfaces directly. There
are problems with any transmission of data over a dis-
tance. If there is a line voltage of at least 1/2 V, there is
a possibility of receiving incorrect data. Since the peak
is only 5 V there is always the possibility of picking up
a noise signal when a wire is spread over a distance and
in an electrical noise generating environment.
The 60-mA standard says that a current of 60-mA
is logic 1 while zero represents logic 0. The main
advantage is that the noise usually encountered over
long-distance transmission lines does not affect the
quality of the data being transmitted. However, the
main disadvantage of this standard is that it has to be
converted to voltage variations if used as inputs to a
computer port.
The 20-mA standard is basically the same as the
60-mA standard except that it is 20 mA. The 20-mA
level represents logic 1 and zero current represents
logic 0. The same advantage is experienced with this
standard as with the 60-mA standard. It is also neces-
sary to convert the current variations to voltage varia-
tions if used as inputs to a computer port.
THE ENVIRONMENT AFFECTS
PERFORMANCE
Many solid-state controls are sensitive to various envi-
ronment factors but not the same ones as those that
generally affect electromechanical devices. Solid-state
controls are generally less sensitive to shock and vibra-
tion since they contain no moving parts. At relatively
high levels of shock and vibration, circuit boards may
loosen, and crack or component leads may fail. Some
electromechanical components are more susceptible to
activation under shock and vibration. In this area solid-
state controls may prove superior. Mounting position is
also usually of little significance with the solid-state
control, except in instances where airflow is required
for cooling.
ELECTRICAL NOISE
This noise is defined as any unwanted electrical signal
that enters the equipment through various means. Elec-
trical noise is capable of causing various types of mal-
functions of solid-state equipment. Electrical noise
may cover the entire spectrum of frequencies and exhibit
any wave shape. Solid-state devices are especially sen-
sitive to noise since they operate at low signal levels.

noise coupled into it, especially through the external
wiring.
Installation Practices
Noise must be minimized as much as possible from
entering the control by using the appropriate installa-
tion practices, especially when the anticipated noise
signal has characteristics very similar to the desired
control input signal.
Grounding
Grounding practices that are used have a significant
effect on noise immunity. Each ground should be con-
nected to its respective reference point by no more than
one wire, called a single-point ground. Under no cir-
cumstance should two or more systems share a com-
mon single ground wire, either equipment ground or
control common.
SOLID-STATE RELIABILITY
Solid-state components exhibit a high degree of relia-
bility when operated within their ratings. For example,
a triac might have an average life of 450,000 hours or
50 years under typical operating conditions, but it fails
at random even when operated within its ratings. The
lifetime above is an average. The time of failure of an
individual device cannot be predicted by observation
as in the case of a relay, where patterns of wear might
be watched. It is thus advisable to provide some sort of
independent check on the operation of individual
devices when they are controlling a critical or potentially
hazardous operation. In addition, the predominant
mode of failure of a solid-state output is in the “on” or
short-circuit mode. This must be considered in certain
critical applications.
Backup Operations
For any size of solid-state control capable of perform-
ing potentially hazardous machine operations, emer-
gency circuits for stopping operation must be routed
Also, the speed of solid-state components allows them
to respond to relatively high frequencies.
Electrical noise entering a solid-state control is
often incapable of damaging components directly
unless extremely high energy and/or voltage levels are
encountered. Most of the malfunctions due to noise are
temporary nuisance-type occurrences or operating
errors, but could result in hazardous machine opera-
tions under certain conditions (Fig. 21-3).
Input lines, output lines, and power supply lines are
the most common sources of noise entering solid-state
controls. Noise may be coupled into the lines electro-
statically through capacitance between these lines and
lines carrying other signals. A high potential is usually
required or long closely spaced conductors are neces-
sary. Magnetic coupling is also quite common when
control lines are closely spaced to lines carrying large
currents. The signals in this case are coupled through
the mutual inductances as in a transformer. Electrosta-
tic and magnetic noise may also be coupled directly
into the control logic circuitry. This generally appears
in unenclosed, unshielded control electronics and
requires a strong noise field. Noise can occur in the
form of electromagnetic radiation from remote sources.
Close coupling is not required and the various lines
entering the control act as receiving antennas. Occa-
sionally, the control circuitry itself is sufficiently sensi-
tive to detect a radiated signal and respond to it. This
type of noise is troublesome when it is encountered
since it is usually of high frequency and occasionally
difficult to filter and shield against on a generalized
basis. A particular installation may require special
treatment, since the various coupling elements, such as
control lines, exhibit unpredictable characteristics,
some of which could render built-in filters ineffective.
Metal enclosures are effective shields where adequate
electrical bonding around doors and bolted surfaces is
provided.
Many designs have been tested and retested. Much
effort has gone into filters, shielding, and the design of
generally insensitive circuitry. It is, however, impossi-
ble to design a control that can handle every form of
Solid-State Reliability

Programmable Controllers
outside the controller. For example, devices such as
end-of-travel limit switches or emergency-stop pull
cord switches should operate motor starters directly
without being processed through controller logic. This
forms a reliable means of control and should be imple-
mented using a minimum number of simple, highly
dependable components of an electromechanical nature,
if possible. Thus, in the event of a complete controller
failure, an independent rapid shutdown means is available.
A convenient means of disconnecting the critical or
potentially hazardous portions of a machine from the
controller should be provided for use during trou-
bleshooting or setup following maintenance.
CONTROLLERS
A number of manufacturers make programmable con-
trollers. Each has slightly different electronics pack-
ages. However, to make sense of the process and the
equipment, one has been chosen for this discussion. It
is the Sy/Max, made by Square D (Fig. 21-4). There
are a number of processors for this particular manufac-
turer to suit as many of the requirements of customers
as possible.
Programmable controllers are used in a variety of
applications to replace conventional control devices,
such as relays and solid-state logic. When compared
with conventional control means, programmable con-
trollers (PLCs) allow ease of installation, quick and
efficient system modifications, more functional capa-
bility, troubleshooting diagnostics, and a high degree
of reliability. Typical applications include automated
material handling, machine tool, and assembly machine
control, wood and paper processing control, injection
molding machine control and process control applica-
tions such as film, chemical, food, and petroleum.
System Hardware and
Programming Equipment
The controller family consists of two groups of equip-
ment: system hardware and programming equipment.
System hardware is used to control the actual opera-
tion, while the programming equipment is used to enter
the user control program into the system hardware.
Once the program is entered, the programming equip-
ment can be used for monitoring, program alteration,
or message displays, but is not required for system
operation (Fig. 21-5).
System hardware consists of a processor, one or
more rack assemblies, power supplies, I/O modules,
and various other modules that provide additional
capabilities. The rack assemblies and associated I/O
modules communicate with external I/O control
devices such as limit switches, motor starters, and
other devices.
Processors
There are five processors available with the Sy/Max
system. The smallest or least expensive, Model 50, can
be programmed with an IBM or compatible personal
computer using Sy/Mate software in addition to its
own handheld programmer, or the process parameters
can be fine tuned with the controller by using the con-
trol station shown in Fig. 21-6. Memory is available up
Fig. 21-4
Processor family. (Square D)

to 4K of EPROM with a battery-backed RAM or
E2PROM. The I/O capacity is 256. To make a compar-
ison of what is available, take a look at Model 300
processor. The Model 300 has an I/O capacity of 256.
The processor has 128 internal relay equivalents and
96 four-digit storage registers for timers, counters, syn-
chronous shift registers, and data storage. In addition to
relay logic, counting, timing, and data manipulation,
this processor offers modular construction for ease of
installation and troubleshooting, fourfunction math,
ASCII output to generate alarm messages and reports,
plus peer-to-peer communication with other processors
through either of two communication ports.
By upgrading to the Model 500 level, other fea-
tures may be acquired. The 500 can perform square-
root math functions, scan control, subroutines, timed
interrupts, and matrix operations. It also has several
levels of security that can prevent unauthorized access
to data and program information through either of its
two communications ports. It has up to 8K of battery-
backed RAM or combination RAM/EPROM memory
and has an I/O capacity of over 2000.
Another upgrade to Model 400 (See Fig. 21-7)
produces a processor that can handle almost any appli-
cation. In addition to Model 500 processor capabilities,
the instruction set of the Model 400 includes trig-o-
metric, transcendental, and statistical functions and the
ability to perform these functions in integer or floating-
point (result to 1038) format. Another unique feature is

the capability of an on-board battery to support the
RAM memory and real-time clock upon removal of the
processor from the rack. This model can also read ASCII
data through either of its two independent communica-
tion ports, allowing it to interface directly with ASCII
weight scales, bar code readers, and other such inputs
for applications such as materials handling. It has up to
16K words of RAM or RAM/EPROM combination and
has an I/O capacity of 4000. Keep in mind that these are
some of the first electronic controls and many are still in
use. For the latest information check with the internet
web sites for the manufacturers of this equipment. 
Input-Output Modules
The I/O modules provides the interface between the
processor and the field device that is being switched or
controlled. The I/O modules shown in Fig. 21-8 are
available in five versions. The standard four-function
covers the range of operating voltages from TTL to
240-V ac/250-V dc. Standard I/Os have a single diag-
nostic LED for each point. Output fuses are accessible
from the side of the module. The deluxe four-function
module is interchangeable and compatible with the
standard four-function modules but has a high-power
(5 A per output) dual-point module and individual
power circuit isolation when used with the isolated
I/O rack. The 4-, 8-, 16-, and 32-function modules are
capable of handling most processes.
The fiber-optic input module has field devices
(switches) designed for use with its circuitry (Fig. 21-9).
The fiber-optic interface module converts all program-
mable controller differential communication (remote
I/O, programming and so forth.) to optical communica-
tion. Fiber-optic communications provides immunity
from electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio-
frequency interference (RFI) and complete electrical
isolation. It is intrinsically safe and uses lightweight,
easily installed cable. Maximum length for the cable
is 5 miles or 8 km. This type of communication system
is useful in process control systems, petrochemical
plants, utility power substations, and outdoor/under-
ground installations.
Intelligent I/O Modules
Intelligent (register) I/O modules such as multiplexed
binary-coded decimal (BCD) and analog I/O and high-
speed counter input, stepping motor output, and speech
output modules provide special functions to the PLC.
On-board microprocessors in each of these devices
allow information to be directly transferred and stored
in processor data registers. A plant floor microcom-
puter allows for a production report. Graphic genera-
tion is also available.
The speech module is a synthesized speech/message
annunciator. It can provide audible alarm annunciation,

The CRT programmer is a portable device that can
monitor, program, and document the control logic of
any processor mentioned previously (Fig. 21-11). In
most industries the LCD flat screen monitor has been
utilized for its ability to take up less space and produce
less heat as well as consume less energy.
This programmer makes programming the proces-
sor easy. This is due to its set of multifunction soft
keys. In addition, high-level functions such as math,
shift registers, timers, and counters are programmed
using simple fill-in-the-blank function boxes in many
cases. Programming is fairly easy once you have
learned the procedures.
operator instructions, or directions to supplement or
replace a visual display. The speech module is compat-
ible with the processors and data controllers or any
device that can generate ASCII output.
Display Systems
There are a number of display systems that can utilize
the features of a programmable controller. Several dif-
ferent types of color graphic displays are available.
Color graphics are available with the hardware and
software systems that interface with a computer such as
that in Fig. 21-10.

Programmable Controllers
Off-line programming allows the processor control
program to be developed, edited, and documented in a
non-factory environment without a processor. The con-
trol program can then be stored on tape and down-
loaded into the processor on the plant floor, reducing
overall system development time.
I/O function names improve the ability for main-
tenance and other plant personnel to understand a
detailed control program by displaying the name (up
to 12 alphanumeric characters) of the I/O device.
This enhances using the CRT to diagnose control
system faults. Each I/O element can have up to an
18-character alphanumeric name along with its address.
In addition, each logic run can have up to a full-
page description of its operation. See the program in
Fig. 21-12.
Cell Controllers
A cell controller is typically used to coordinate and
manage the operation of a manufacturing cell, consist-
ing of a group of automated programmable machine
controls (programmable controllers, robots, and so
forth) designed to work together and perform a com-
plete manufacturing or process-related task.
Micro-Cell Controller
The micro-cell controller is a programmable multi-
function, data and program storage device, designed
for small cell control applications (Fig. 21-13).
The mini-cell controller is the midrange member of
the cell controller family. It is designed to perform basic
control functions in addition to high-level functions
such as data analysis, trending, statistical process con-
trol, statistical quality control, color graphic generation
and serve as a communications gateway (Fig. 21-14).

Low Voltage Motor 
Control Centers
These control centers combine motor control and pro-
tection devices with the advanced networking and diag-
nostic capabilities to give you an inside look at your
motor control application. This technology features
built-in DeviceNet®, intelligent motor controls, and pre-
configured and tested networks. See Fig. 21-16.
Local Area Network
One of the advantages of keeping the same type of pro-
grammable controller within a plant is its ability to
become part of a local area communication network
(Fig. 21-15). The network can have up to 200 con-
trollers and other devices communicate with each
other. The network consists of twin-axial cable up to
10,000 ft long and up to 100 network interface mod-
ules. Two devices (PLCs, computers, CRTs, printers,
etc.) can be connected to each network interface mod-
ule. The network allows any programmer or program-
mable package of the acceptable type to be used on the
network. Several versions of network interface mod-
ules are available.

Figure 21-17 illustrates the architecture network
diagram. These motor control centers with ArcShield®
reduce the risk of arc flash injury through the use of the
industry-leading arc containment design that has been
tested to meet the arc resistant standards for medium
voltage equipment.
The arcresistant controller provides rugged process
control for applications requiring a higher level of per-
sonnel protection. The units are compliant with IEEE
standards and provide a Type 2 protection. During an arc
flash the controller safely redirects the arc flash energy
out the top of the unit and away from personnel. This
protection is also provided when the low voltage door is
open for maintenance purposes. See Fig. 21-18.

Future of PLCs
The programmable controller (PLC) has a bright
future inasmuch as it will probably be used in all new
production facilities. In some instances it has found
applications that were once thought to be robot jobs.
The cost of robots and their limited reprogrammable
nature makes the inexpensive PLC the device for the
future.
Each manufacturer has a different training pro-
gram for its particular devices. As you may have wit-
nessed here it is impossible to cover PLCs in one
chapter of a book. It is more a subject for an entire
book and training program.
What has been done here is an introduction to
some of the concepts, ideas, and equipment involved
in a PLC system that is used to form part of a larger
unit such as a manufacturing cell. Of course, as with
any electronics equipment there are constant upgrades
and improvements. Keeping up with the latest is time
consuming and a task that is lifetime in nature.
Much more time and effort will be needed by all
those involved in electrical motor control to keep
abreast of how electronics is doing the job and
becoming less expensive and more reliable while
doing so.
A good background in digital electronics is neces-
sary to be able to understand how the programmable
controller operates and functions in computer inte-
grated manufacturing (CIM) as part of a computer
controlled manufacturing facility (Fig. 21-19).

Robots and Robotics
A robot is defined as a programmable, multifunctional,
manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools, or
specialized devices through variable programmed
motions for the performance of a variety of tasks. The
computer is the brain of the robot.
The robot is a relatively recent development. In
1921, Karl Capek used the Czech word Robota in a
book and play called R.U.R. The word was changed to
robot in English. A number of things must be consid-
ered when determining the answer to the question,
what is a true robot? See Fig. 22-1.
It is a device or system that is programmed by a
human to perform human-like acts. The robot is a
device or system that may sense various conditions and
react in a preprogrammed manner. See Fig. 22-2. The
robot may be able to react to various conditions in
terms of the five human senses: touch (feel), vision
(see), taste, smell, and hearing.
THE ROBOT AS A SYSTEM 
The robot is a system that can operate on its own with-
out any human supervision. It may make decisions by
comparing information received from sensors and
reacting in a preprogrammed way. Unlike humans it
does not tire easily. These sensors are classified as
magnetic, light-activated, heat-activated, and pressure-
activated.
ROBOT HISTORY
The robot became a reality in the mid-1950s. The devel-
opment of the robot is closely tied to the development

of the computer. Special programs are used to control
robots. They are designed for specific jobs and are
written in special programming languages. Many lan-
guages exist for the control of robots. See Fig. 22-3.
The microprocessor is the brain of the robot. It has the
ability to take sensed signals and make the robot react
in a planned manner. The microprocessor is an electronic
device made from silicon chips. Robots can work
seven days a week without at a break. See Fig. 22-4.
They are capable of performing tasks more efficiently
than humans. Robots are expensive and need highly
trained technicians to keep them operational. They
replace humans, but create a demand for highly skilled
workers to keep them operating. Robots are tied to the
improvement of quality of manufactured products.
They have advantages and disadvantages. Each advan-
tage must be weighed against the disadvantage before
making a decision to buy robots instead of using
human labor. Robots have the advantage of being
retrained rather quickly. They are flexible and can be
used to do more than one thing with a minimum of

reprogramming or retraining. The main disadvantage of
a robot is down time. If the robot breaks down, it may
hold up an entire plant’s production schedule. Robots
have a number of industrial applications that make them
useful to larger manufacturer who can withstand the ini-
tial cost of the unit, and its installation and debugging.
Robots are made up of a number of systems. 
CLASSIFYING ROBOTS
There are a number of methods used to classify robots.
The classification system used in this book is accord-
ing to the end purpose of the robot. Industrial robots
have arms with grippers attached. The grippers are finger-
like ends and can grip or pick up various objects. See
Fig. 22-5.

The Explorer Robot
The explorer robot is used to probe outer space and to
explore caves, dive underwater, and explore areas
where no human can exist. Most hobbyist robots are
mobile. They are still experimental and are part of an
effort to develop a house-keeping robot that resembles
the human form.
The Classroom Robot
Classroom robots have limited application today.
However, remarkable things are planned for them in
the near future as the world becomes more technolog-
ically oriented.

The Entertainment Robot
Entertainment robots are just beginning to be developed
and made available to entertain people in movies and
television. Bookstores now feature the latest robots and
flying units that have video cameras that feed pictures
back to a computer. They can act as roving advertise-
ments also. The movies make robots do some amazing
things that humans would not attempt. They are also
used to remove bombs from buildings and check for
humans in burning buildings. Applications for the robot
are limited only by the human imagination.
The manipulator is one of the basic components of
the robot. The other two are the controller and the power
supply. The manipulator can be classified by four coor-
dinate systems, used to describe the arm movement.
The base of the robot is its anchor point. The base
may be either rigid or mobile. Some type of arm is found
on most industrial robots. It may be jointed and resemble
a human arm or it may be a slide-in/slide-out type used to
grasp something and bring it back closer to the robot. See
Fig. 22-6. The wrist is attached to the jointed arm and can
be designed with a wide range of motions. The gripper is
located at the end of the wrist and is used to hold what-
ever the robot is to manipulate (Fig. 22-7). The manipu-
lator is really a combination shoulder, arm, wrist, and
hand. The gripper represents the hand. See Fig. 22-8.

WORK ENVELOPE 
The work envelope is also referred to as a sphere of
influence or work area for the robot. See Fig. 22-9.
Articulations are (1) extending and retracting the arm,
(2) swinging or rotating the arm, and (3) elevating the
arm. The robot has six degrees of freedom if it can
move the wrist three ways and the arm three ways.
Human workers have forty-two degrees of freedom. 
ROBOT MOTION CAPABILITIES
The four basic motion capabilities of robots are linear
motion, rotating motion, twisting motion, and exten-
sional motion. These four motions are the basics of the
LERT classification system. 
L—linear motion
E—extensional motion
R—rotational motion
T—twisting motion
Keep in mind that most robots are mounted to the
floor. However, it is possible for them to be mounted to
the ceiling or onto a mobile platform. Each axis is
listed in the order it is mounted to the first component
or base. For instance, L3 indicated there are three linear
motions. If you use the R2L3, you have two rotational
motions and three linear motions.
FOUR SYSTEMS
CLASSIFICATIONS FOR THE ARM
The manipulator arm geometry refers to the movement
of the robot arm. There are four systems of classifica-
tion for robot axis movement (See Fig. 22-10):
• Articulate
• Cartesian 
• Cylindrical
• Polar 
Each describes the movement of the arm through
space and within its work envelope. The manipulator uses

the X, Y, and Z planes to reach its target (Fig. 22-11A, B).
However, there are also the theta (θ), beta (β), W,
and U axes to be considered in the operation of a
robot.
The Cartesian coordinate system robot is one of the
simplest in its operation. It can be used to load and
unload and do point-to-point operations. This type of
robot can be further classified as a low technology type.
Cartesian in and of itself does not make it low technol-
ogy. Most air operated pick-and-place robots, being low
technology, are of the Cartesian design. See Fig. 22-11. 
Coordinate systems are also used to describe the
motion possibilities of the wrist. The manipulator arm
is limited in its ability to do work without some type of
end-effector to act as a hand. The axes that the wrist
adds are identified as the pitch axis, the yaw axis, and
the roll axis. Cartesian coordinate robots have a rectan-
gular-shaped work envelope. The polar coordinate robot

DRIVE SYSTEMS FOR ROBOTS
Drive systems for robots are classified as: 
• Pneumatic 
• Hydraulic 
• Electric
Each type has its applications due to physical lim-
itations of the method used to do the work. Each type
of drive has its advantages and disadvantages. See
Figs. 22-14 and 22-15.
Robots need some type of system to cause them to
function. Hydraulic, pneumatic, and electrical drive
systems are all utilized to drive robots. Hydraulic sys-
tems are used for heavy loads. Pneumatic systems are
used for medium-low load weights. The electric drive
is used for low load weights. 
Hydraulic systems use pumps to create the flow
needed to do the work at the end of the arm. There are
several types of hydrostatic pumps used to make the
system operate properly. 
The automobile uses a hydraulic system for brak-
ing. As the brake pedal is depressed, it puts pressure on
a reservoir of liquid that is moved under pressure to the
brake cylinders. The brake cylinders then apply pressure
to the pads that make contact with the rotor that is

attached to the front wheel. By applying pressure to the
pads in varying amounts, forward motion of the car is
either stopped or slowed, as desired. The hydraulic sys-
tem used for the robot is similar to the braking system
of the automobile. Hydraulics is the Greek word for
water. However, oil, not water, is used in the robot
drive systems. See Fig. 22-16.
Pneumatic systems use air to do work, Fig. 22-17.
There are pneumatic motors used on the end manipula-
tor to grip or handle the load being processed. The
pneumatic system does not need a return system for the
air. It exhausts directly into the atmosphere. The word
pneu means air in Latin. In the field of robotics, com-
pressed air is the medium used.
The electric drive systems are powered by electric
motors. There are many types of electric motors, but
the DC types are preferred for precision motion and
movements. Permanent magnet, stepper, brushless DC,

and Hall-effect DC motors are used for various functions
in robots. AC motors are used for heavy loads where pre-
cision of movement is not necessary. They are classified
as induction and squirrel-cage types. Each type has its
particular applications. Squirrel-cage motors are further
broken down into six classifications according to their
starting currents and torque. See Fig. 22-18A, B.
END-EFFECTORS
End effectors may also be called end-of-arm tooling.
The manipulator is used to move the end-effector that is
mounted on the end of it. Grippers are used to pick up
and hold objects being machined or boxed or picked up
and placed or palletized. There are vacuum operated
grippers and magnetic grippers as well as a variety of
mechanical devices used to grip or hold materials. See
Figs. 22-19 and 22-20. Many of these grippers are made
in the plant where the robot is working. Positioning is
very important in the proper utilization of a robot. The
robot must be able to place an object in the same loca-
tion over and over again without being too far off the
spot. Controllers, consequently robots, are classified as:
• Low technology 
• Medium technology 
• High technology
The ability of a controller to handle programs for
the robot makes the difference in a classification.
Dynamic braking and plugging are both used to
promptly stop the movement of the manipulator. They
both have advantages and disadvantages and can be
used in various locations depending on the application.
Repeatability and accuracy are important parts of the
robot system. Repeatability is the ability of the robot to
place an object in the same place repeatedly. Accuracy is
determined by the degree to which it can handle the
repeat function. 
Gears, chains, and belts are the type of drives used
in robots. Each has its own applications. Gears are
accurate but noisy (Fig. 22-21). Chains have their
limitations, whereas belts can be used under circum-
stances where power is transmitted only short dis-
tances. Harmonic drives have been developed to
reduce backlash and improve the efficiency of the
robot operation. See Fig. 22-22. They have also elimi-
nated a lot of noise inherent in standard transmissions.
The ball screw is a useful adaptation of principles to
eliminate backlash or gear looseness (Fig. 22-23).
In order for the robot to hold and recognize
objects, it must be able to sense their presence, size,
and shape. Transducers are used to convert nonelectri-
cal energy into electrical energy. A transducer then can
serve as a sensor. See Fig. 22-24.
LIMIT SWITCHES
Limit switches are designed to be turned on or off by
an object contacting a lever or roller that, in turn, oper-
ates the switch. Some low and medium technology
robots use this type of sensor (Fig. 22-25).
SENSORS
Sensors are classified as contact or noncontact. They
may also be called internal or external and passive or
active. Most robotic sensors are contact or noncontact.
A limit switch is a contact sensor. Touch, force, pres-
sure, temperature, and tactile sensors all respond to
contact. Pressure changes, temperature changes, and
electromagnetic changes can all be sensed by noncon-
tact methods. They usually react to a change in a mag-
netic field or light pattern.

A number of light-emitting diode (LED) sensors are
used in robotics. The light beam is used in a number
of applications (Fig. 22-26). Another light sensor is
the television camera mounted on the end of the
manipulators. See Fig. 22-27. It can see the parts
and compare them to what is in the memory of the
computer. 
As previously mentioned, the work envelope is
that area where the manipulator moves the end effec-
tor. lt varies according to the robot and its design char-
acteristics. See Fig. 22-28. Robots are usually located
in a cage to prevent humans from entering the work
envelope. The quick movements of the robot arm may
cause serious injury to anyone it hits. Maintenance
persons have to be very careful whenever they are in
the work area of the robot (Fig. 22-29).

PROXIMITY SENSORS
Proximity sensors are used to give the robot a sense of
touch and sight. They take various forms and work on
different principles (Fig. 22-30). Different types of
proximity sensors include:
• Inductance sensor 
• Capacitance sensor 
• Resistive sensor

Eddy current proximity detectors use magnetism to
function. They induce a magnetic field in an object,
and a small coil is used to pick up the change in mag-
netic field. A reed switch is another type of magnetic-
electrical proximity switch. It responds to a controlled
magnetic field (Fig. 22-31).
One type of range sensor is called a laser interfer-
ometric gauge. It is very expensive and is sensitive to
humidity, temperature, and vibration. Another ranging
system is the television camera. See Fig. 22-32. 
Tactile sensors rely on touch. The simplest type is
the micro-switch. Some experimenting is being done
to produce a better quality tactile sensor than is presently
available. See Fig. 22-33 for the Hillis touch sensor.
Pulsed infrared photoelectric systems can also be used
for presence sensing.
Temperature sensing is done with thermocouples
and thermistors (Fig. 22-34). 
Displacement sensing is done with capacitive,
inductive, and resistive devices. See Fig.  22-35. The
strain gauge is a device used to sense mechanical move-
ment and, in some cases, weight or force. Speed sensing
can be done with a tachometer or photocell (Fig. 22-36).
Torque sensing is used to make go-no-go decisions. 
Adjustments and process variables detect end-
effector collisions, and determine required actions to
unjam the end-effector. They can coordinate two or
more arms. 
Some have advantages that others do not. Pulsed
infrared photoelectric controls are used in industrial
robotics for presence sensing of any type of object.

Machine vision systems are used to recognize

(Fig. 22-37).
POWER FOR ROBOTS
Robots need a source of power to do work. The power
may be from a single source or from any combination
of three sources, that is, electricity, hydraulic pressure,
or pneumatic pressure (Fig. 22-38).
ELECTRIC MOTORS
Single-phase and three-phase motors are used to pro-
vide the energy to move heavy loads. Single-phase
motors may be split-phase, capacitor start, or shaded
pole. The shaded pole motor is usually employed to
power fans and ventilation devices. The split-phase
motor does not start well under load, but the capacitor-
start motor does. The capacitor-start motor can be used
to power compressors and similar devices where lower
voltages (120/240) are available. The three-phase motor

is one of the most reliable of electrical machines. It is
the workhorse of industry. Take a closer look at the
motor characteristics in Figs. 22-39. Figure 22-40
shows the single-phase and three-phase motors most
often used by robots.
SERVO-CONTROLLED ROBOTS
A servo-controlled robot can do more things than a
non–servo-controlled robot. It can move up and down
and back and forth and is able to stop at any point
within its work envelope. The non-servo robot usually

is controlled by limit switches or banging into stops at
the end of each swing. There are electric, pneumatic,
and hydraulic non–servo-controlled robots. See
Fig. 22-41. Feedback is the main advantage that servo-
controlled robots have over non–servo-controlled
robots. See Fig. 22-42. Feedback tells the controller
where the manipulator is located at all times. 
ACTUATORS
Actuators are motors, cylinders, or other mechanisms
used to power robots. They are employed primarily to
provide the power to move each axis of the robot arm.
The actuator causes the motion of the robot. There are
pneumatic actuators, electrically operated actuators,
and electro-hydraulic actuators. 

Controllers  
387

CONTROLLERS
Controllers are available in six types: 
• Drum 
• Air logic 
• Relay logic 
• Programmable 
• Microprocessor-based minicomputer
• Minicomputer 
The drum, air logic, and relay logic controllers
have become obsolete with the advent of the integrated
circuit chip and its ability to store and recall programs
for the robot. The ladder diagram is the circuit used by
the programmable robot (Fig. 22-43). It is also needed
to make the computer function as a device that can
control sequencing and timing of operations of a robot.
The computer replaced the switching operations nor-
mally done by a relay. The relay turned on and off the
solenoid that allowed air or hydraulic fluid to pass or
exhaust. The ladder diagram is the electrical schematic
of the circuit of control for the solenoids and the
timers.
Microprocess-Based Controllers
Microprocessor-based controllers were made possible
by the development of the integrated circuit chip. They
have the ability to store sequences and allow them to be
recalled when needed. This opened up the possibility of
making changes to a program without having to mechan-
ically adjust the circuitry (Fig. 22-44).

Teach Pendant
The teach pendant is one of the ways to program a
robot. It is used for point-to-point programming of pick
and place roots and for programming continuous-path
robots used for painting and welding (Fig. 22-46).
Lead-through programming is done by leading the
manipulator through the points it is supposed to follow.
The points are stored in its memory and recalled when-
ever the program is repeated. Computer terminal pro-
gramming is done with the aid of a computer properly
connected to the controller of the robot. This, then,
allows for easy changes in the program if needed to
change the job of the robot. A number of methods or
systems are used to accomplish the mating of the com-
pute and robot. The microprocessor is one device used
to control robots. See Fig. 22-47. Very intelligent
robots have the ability to understand high-level lan-
guages. Almost every robot manufacturer has devel-
oped its own controller language. Some of the more
frequently used languages are VAL, HELP, AML, MCL,
RPL, and RAIL. BASIC and COBOL are also used for
some controllers.
Programming the Computer to
Control the Robot
A robot can be programmed by a computer. The pro-
gram software (disk, magnetic tape, or other means)
can be written and then adapted to the robot so that the
robot does not have to be taken off -line during pro-
gramming.
Interfacing is the means used to enable the robot to
communicate with its controller and other parts of the
work station. The microprocessor-controlled robot is
able to communicate with other equipment around it by
connections through ports (Fig. 22-48).

Software and Computer Code
ASCII code is the means by which the keyboard can
be used to communicate with robot computers or
microprocessors. Parallel ports are used when the
computer and the machine it is controlling are sepa-
rated by less than 50 feet. Serial ports are used when
long distance communications is necessary between
units. Information may be transmitted as changes in
voltage or changes in current. The RS232C standard
and the TTL standard rely on voltage variations. The
60 mA and the 20 mA standards rely on current varia-
tions. The controller has input ports for interfacing
with various computer controls. RS232C and RS422
formats are used for interfacing. A computer interface
allows the programmer of the robotic system to pro-
gram off-line.
SENSOR INPUTS
Sensor information is converted to digital so the com-
puter can handle it. Controllers have interfacing ports
that provide for connecting sensors. There are two
types of program interfacing: service requests and
robot requests. Each deals with interacting with periph-
eral components and provides control during the
period when the data are transmitted and received at
the input ports (Fig. 22-49).
VISION SYSTEMS
Vision systems can provide the robot controller with
information about the location, orientation, and type of
part to be handled. Machine vision systems are used
for recognition and verification of parts for inspection
and sorting of parts, for noncontact measurements and
for providing part position and orientation information
to the robot controller. Edge detection and clustering
are the two processes used for identification by the
computer of the parts viewed by the vision camera
(Figs. 22-50 and 22-51).

flow is the moving of parts and materials in an orderly
and timely manner. Fabricating can also be done by
robots. Everything from drilling, riveting, sanding,
de-burring, and grinding to polishing can be done by
robots. They can also assemble products partially or
totally without human supervision.
Painting and welding are two value-added opera-
tions the robots can do. They are easily adapted to
welding and spray painting. Inspecting and testing are
also easily automated. Robots are designed to do the
job without tiring. Robots have a tendency to improve
PARTS HANDLING
The stacking of parts is easily automated and the robot
does the job well. Parts can be taken from an assembly
line and placed in a bin or box (palletizing), or they can
be taken out of a box or off a pallet by a robot (depal-
letizing).

Line tracking is done by the robot moving along with
the line and performing a job as it moves along. Process

CHAPTER

Troubleshooting and Maintenance
PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
1. Explain how preventive maintenance can prolong
trouble-free operation of a system.
2. Explain how to prevent accidental shock. 
3. Troubleshoot ac and dc motors.
4. Troubleshoot power supply disturbances.
5. Troubleshoot circuits using a volt-ohm-milliammeter
(VOM).
6. Troubleshoot circuits using an oscilloscope. 
7. Troubleshoot relays.
8. Troubleshoot solid-state motor control equipment.
TROUBLESHOOTING AND 
THE ELECTRICIAN
Troubleshooting is another of the tasks performed by the
electrician. It tests your ability to observe everything
around you and your ability to understand how things
work. One of the best ways to prevent trouble is to check
off certain items as a routine procedure to catch trouble
before it becomes a major item and causes fire, damage,
and/or death. Electrical problems are many, and every
connection and every device is a potential problem.
Each device and service as well as circuits should have
been properly wired, but that is not always the case.
One of the biggest problems is troubleshooting
electric motors. A troubleshooting chart will aid in this
task as well as some of the more obvious observations
made by the person on the scene. All textbook trou-
bleshooting can do is identify the logical problems.
On-scene facts are not always detailed in textbooks, so
a good observer must also be able to uncover the facts
needed to make a diagnosis. Once the problem is
found, it is usually easily corrected.
PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE
Damp and Wet Areas
One of the areas that can cause problems in any home
or shop wiring system is dampness and wetness.
Watertight equipment should be installed wherever
there is a danger of water coming in contact with live
wires. One of the largest problems is the condensation
of moisture inside the panel board (Fig. 23-1). Mois-
ture condenses where the warm, moist air in the base-
ment moves up to come in contact with the cold air
outside making the riser cold. In areas where this is a
problem, either an underground entrance can be made
or, an outside riser can be mounted alongside the build-
ing, which will make its entrance only when it reaches
the panel board. An entrance as low as possible is pre-
ferred so that any moisture that does condense will easily
drain out the bottom of the panel board without con-
tacting the hot side of the distribution panel. Another
problem is rust and corrosion. Anywhere there is mois-
ture there is the possibility of rust and corrosion. Both
rust and corrosion can cause contact problems with
metals and remove or place high resistance in the path
of a ground system. Removing a ground produces a
situation that can be very hazardous (Fig. 23-2). In a single-
phase system the current on the neutral of a properly
installed 120/240-V system carries the difference
between the current flowing on the hot lines. If the
ground is removed by corrosion or rust preventing con-
tact with the proper grounding lugs, it is the same as
having an open ground.
One of the indications of this condition is that
some lights in the building will appear very bright and
others very dim. Turn off the main switch and locate
the open or corroded ground connection before allow-
ing continued operation. A situation of this sort will
make it very dangerous for anyone who touches any of
the conductors. That person or animal (in the case of
barnyards) will complete the ground circuit and fatal
shock may occur.
Fig. 23-1
Moisture in the panel board can cause problems.

employed and use electrical equipment. It is often
encountered by the electrician whether in the home or
on the job.
The arrangement shown in Fig. 23-4A checks pola-
rity and grounding. It also diagnoses five other incorrect
wiring conditions with a plug-in tester. Figure 22-4B
shows the same tester being used to check continuity of
the ground path of a tool. This is very important since
the hand drill has a metal handle.
In Fig. 23-4C the meter is a ground loop tester; it
measures the ground loop impedance of live circuits. It
can also be used to check for grounding of tools, piping
systems, and other equipment. The meter in Fig. 23-4D
is used to check the 500- and 1000-V dc insulation resis-
tance of de-energized circuits and electrical equipment.
It also checks for continuity in low resistance circuits.
The ground-fault circuit interrupter shown in
Fig. 23-4E mainly provides insurance that a tool will
not develop a fault on the job, causing a serious per-
sonal injury. It tests tools to assure that any current
leakage is below a hazard level. Keep in mind that
nuisance tripping of a GFCI can be caused by a few
drops of moisture or flecks of dust. One way to avoid
this problem is to use watertight plugs and connec-
tors on extension cords.
Ground-Fault Receptacles
There are two different ways to wire up ground-fault
receptacles (GFRs) (Figs. 23-5 and 23-6). The devices
shown are not only GFCIs but also receptacles. They
can be used, as shown in Fig. 23-6, to protect other
downstream receptacles. This brings about problems in
some places, inasmuch as the protected outlets are not
always known by the persons using them, and when the
GFR trips it takes them off-line also.
One way to check for a terminal installation is to
check the red and gray wires. If they are capped with a
wire nut, you know that GFR does not service any
other outlets.
Wiring Devices
Using the proper wiring devices is a form of preventive
maintenance inasmuch as it prevents problems later.
Shock hazards are minimized by the dielectric strength
of the material used for the molded interior walls and
the individual wire pocket areas. Nylon seems to be
best for this job. Nylon devices withstand high impact
in heavy-duty industrial and commercial applications.
Each molded piece has to support adjacent molded
pieces to result in good resiliency and strength.
Devices made of vinyl, neoprene, urea, or phenolic
materials can crack or be damaged under pressure.
Prevention of Accidental Shock
The ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) is one
device used to prevent accidental shock. However,
GFCI protection should never be a substitute for good
grounding practice, but should support a well-maintained
grounding system. Figure 23-3 shows a device that can
be used in various locations for the prevention of shock
by checking the grounding system. This device is used
in homes, plants, and businesses where people are

Damage can be invisible and cause direct shorts and
other hazards. Nylon also has the ability to withstand
high voltages without breaking down.
MAINTENANCE OF SMALL
ELECTRIC MOTORS
Small motors usually operate with so little trouble that
they are apt to be neglected. They should be thor-
oughly inspected twice yearly to detect wear and to
remove any conditions that might lead to further wear.
Special care must be taken to inspect motor bearings,
cutouts, and other wearing parts. Make sure that dirt
and dust are not interfering with ventilation or clog-
ging moving parts.
Adequate Wiring
When installing a new motor or transferring a motor
from one installation to another, it is well to check the
wiring. Be sure that adequate wire sizes are used to
feed electrical power to the motor; in many cases,
replacement of wires will prevent future breakdown.
Adequate wiring assists in preventing overheating of
motors and reduces electric power costs.
Check Internal Switches
Start winding switches usually give little trouble;
however, regular attention makes them last even
longer. Use fine sandpaper to clean contacts. Make
sure that the sliding member on the shaft that operates
the start winding switch moves freely. Check for
loose screws.
Check Load Condition
Check the driven load regularly. Sometimes, additional
friction develops gradually within the machine and
imposes an overload on the motor, so watch the motor
temperature. Protect motors with properly rated fuses
or overload cutouts.
Extra Care in Lubrication
A motor running three times as much as usual will
need three times as much attention to lubrication.
Motors should be lubricated according to the manufac-
turer’s recommendation. Provide enough oil, but do not
overdo it.
Keep Commutators Clean
Do not allow a commutator on a dc motor to become
covered with dust or oil. It should be wiped occasionally
with a clean, dry cloth or one moistened with a solvent
that does not leave a film. If necessary to use sandpaper,
use No. 0000 paper or finer. Sandpaper or abrasive
papers are available with ratings as high as 1500 grit.
Motors Must Have Proper
Service Rating
Sometimes it is necessary to move a motor from one job
to another or to operate a machine continuously when it
has previously been running for short periods of time.
Whenever a motor is operated under different condi-
tions or on a new application, make sure that it is rated
properly. A motor is rated for intermittent duty because
the temperature rise within the motor will not be exces-
sive when it is operated for short periods. Putting such a
motor on a continuous-duty application will result in
excessive temperature rise, which will cause the insula-
tion to deteriorate or may even cause burnout.
Replace Worn Brushes
Brushes should be inspected at regular intervals so that
replacements can be made if necessary. Whenever a
brush is removed for inspection, be sure that it is
replaced in the same axial position; that is, it must not
be turned around in the brush holder when putting it
back in the motor. If the contact surface, which has
been “worn in” to fit the commutator, is not replaced
in the same position, excessive sparking and loss of
power will result. Brushes naturally wear down and
should be replaced before they are less than 1/4 in. in
length. The commutator should also be inspected when
brushes are removed. See the section “DC Motor
Problems” later in the chapter.
MOTOR PROBLEMS
Certain danger signals are presented before a motor
overheats or burns out.
Ball Bearing Motors
Danger Signals
• A sudden increase in the temperature differential
between the motor and bearing temperatures is an
indication of malfunction of the bearing lubricant.
• A temperature higher than that recommended for the
lubricant warns of a reduction in bearing life. The
rule of thumb is that grease life is halved for each
25°F (−4°C) increase in operating temperature.
• An increase in bearing noise, accompanied by a
bearing temperature rise, is an indication of a serious
malfunction of the bearing.
402
Troubleshooting and Maintenance

internal friction of the oil, which is due to the sliding
action of the many oil layers, is measured as the viscos-
ity. The viscosity of the oil chosen for a particular appli-
cation should provide ample oiliness to prevent wear
and seizure at ambient temperature, low speeds, and
heavy loads, before the oil film is established and oper-
ating temperature is reached. Low-viscosity oils are rec-
ommended for use with fractional-horsepower motors,
as they offer low internal friction, permit fuller realization
of the motor’s efficiency, and minimize the operating
temperature of the bearing. 
Standard Oils  High ambient temperatures and high
motor operating temperature will have a destructive
effect on sleeve bearings lubricated with standard tem-
perature range oil by increasing the bearing operating
temperature beyond the oil’s capabilities. Such
destructive effects include reduction in oil viscosity, an
increase in corrosive oxidation products in the lubri-
cant, and usually a reduction in the quantity of the
lubricant in contact with the bearing. Special oils are
available, however, for motor applications at high tem-
peratures and also for motor applications at low tem-
peratures. The care exercised in selecting proper
lubricant for expected extremes in bearing operating
temperatures will have a decided influence on motor
performance and bearing life.
Wear
Although sleeve bearings are less sensitive to a
limited amount of abrasive or foreign materials than are
ball bearings, owing to the ability of the relatively soft
surface of the sleeve bearing to absorb hard particles of
foreign materials, good maintenance practice recom-
mends that the oil and bearing be kept clean. Frequency
of oil changing will depend on local conditions such as
severity and continuity of service and operating temper-
ature. A conservative lubrication maintenance program
should call for periodic inspections of the oil level and
cleaning and refilling with new oil every 6 months.
Warning: Over lubrication should be avoided.
Insulation damage by excess motor lubricant repre-
sents one of the most common causes of motor wind-
ing insulation failure in both sleeve and ball bearing
motors.
COMMON MOTOR PROBLEMS
AND THEIR CAUSES
Easy-to-detect symptoms, in many cases, indicate
exactly what is wrong with a fractional-horsepower
motor. However, where general types of trouble have
similar symptoms, it becomes necessary to check each
possible cause separately. Table 23-1 lists some of the
more common ailments of small motors, together with
Major Duties of Ball Bearing Lubricant
• To dissipate heat caused by friction of bearing mem-
bers under load.
• To protect bearing members from rust or corrosion.
• To offer maximum protection against entrance of for-
eign matter into the bearings.
Causes of Bearing Failures
• Foreign matter in bearing from dirty grease or inef-
fective seals.
• Deterioration of grease because of excessive temper-
ature or contamination.
• Overheated bearings as a result of too much grease.
Sleeve Bearing Motors
The lubricant used with sleeve bearings must actually
provide an oil film that completely separates the bear-
ing surface from the rotating shaft member, and ideally,
eliminate metal-to-metal contact.
Lubricant
Oil, because of its adhesive properties
and because of its viscosity or resistance to flow, is
dragged along by the rotating shaft of the motor and
forms a wedge-shaped film between the shaft and the
bearing. The oil film forms automatically when the
shaft begins to turn and is maintained by the motion.
The forward motion sets up a pressure in the oil film,
which in turn supports the load. This wedge-shaped
film of oil is an absolutely essential feature of effective
hydrodynamic, sleeve bearing lubrication. Without it
no great load can be carried, except with high friction
loss and resultant destruction of the bearing. When
lubrication is effective and an adequate oil film is main-
tained, the sleeve bearing serves chiefly as a guide to
ensure alignment. In the event of failure of the oil film,
the bearing functions as a safeguard to prevent actual
damage to the motor shaft.
Selection of Oil
The selection of the oil that will pro-
vide the most effective bearing lubrication and not
require frequent renewal, merits careful consideration.
Good lubricants are essential to low maintenance cost.
Top-grade oils are recommended, as they are refined
from pure petroleum, are substantially noncorrosive as
far as metal surfaces to be lubricated are concerned, are
free from sediment, dirt, or other foreign materials, and
are stable with respect to heat and moisture encoun-
tered in the motor. In performance terms, the higher-
priced oils prove to be cheaper in the long run.
An oil film is built up of many layers or laminations
that slide upon one another as the shaft rotates. The
Common Motor Problems and Their Causes

suggestions as to possible causes. Most common motor
problems can be checked by some test or inspection.
The order of making these tests rests with the trou-
bleshooter, but it is natural to make the simplest ones
first. For instance, when a motor fails to start, you first
inspect the motor connections, since this is an easy and
simple thing to do.
Problem Diagnosis
In diagnosing problems, a combination of symptoms
will often give a definite clue to the source of the trouble
and hence eliminate other possibilities. For instance, in
the case just cited of a motor that will not start, if heat-
ing occurs, it offers the suggestion that a short or
ground exists in one of the windings and eliminates the
likelihood of an open circuit, poor line connection, or
defective starter switch.
Centrifugal Switches
Centrifugal starting switches, found in many types of
single-phase fractional-horsepower motors, occasion-
ally are a source of trouble. If the mechanism sticks
in the running position, the motor will not start. On
the other hand, if stuck in the closed position, the
motor will not attain speed and the starting winding
heats up quickly. The motor may also fail to start if
the contact points of the switch are out of adjustment
or coated with oxide. It is important to remember,
however, that any adjustment of the switch or con-
tacts should be made only at the factory or authorized
service station.
404
Troubleshooting and Maintenance
Commutator-Type Motors
More maintenance is required by motors with commuta-
tors. High-speed series-wound motors should not be used
on long, continuous-duty cycle applications because the
commutator and brushes are a potential source of trouble.
Gummy commutators and oil-soaked brushes can cause
sluggish action and severe sparking. The commutator can
be cleaned with fine sandpaper. However, if pitted spots
still appear, the commutator should be reground.
TROUBLESHOOTING AIDS
Connection Diagrams
Figure 23-7 shows motor connection diagrams as an
aid in troubleshooting. Knowing the arrangement of
coils aids in checking out the shorts and grounds as
well as opens.
Small Three-Phase Motor Rating
Data
Knowing the current expected to be drawn in normal
operation aids in troubleshooting. It is possible to use a
clamp-on type meter and check the current drawn by
the motor to see if it is excessive or incorrect. Table 23-2
shows the ampere rating of ac motors that operate on
three-phase power.
Ampere ratings of motors vary somewhat depend-
ing on the type of motor. The values given below are

Voltage Fluctuations
In many states the appropriate public service commis-
sions establish allowable voltage tolerances for utilities.
These tolerances are continually monitored, and in
most instances every reasonable precaution is taken to
stay within these limits. However, some equipment is
so sensitive that fluctuations within the tolerance limits
can still cause problems (Fig. 23-8).
can wipe out data stored in memory, produce output
errors, or cause extensive equipment damage. Besides
the immediate damage, there are also harder-to-detect
effects, particularly reduced service life. Subsequent
random failures can be particularly annoying and
expensive (Fig. 23-11).

Under voltage can result from overloaded power
circuits. Intermittent low voltage is typically caused by
starting a large heavily loaded motor such as an air
conditioner. Over voltage conditions are less common
but are more damaging and are seen frequently in facil-
ities with rapidly varying loads (Fig. 23-10).
Transients
Voltage Spikes
Short-duration impulses in excess of
the normal voltage are called spikes or surges.
Although their duration is incredibly brief, a spike may
exceed the normal voltage level five- or tenfold. Spikes
Voltage fluctuations can usually be detected by vis-
ible flickering of lights. High- or low-voltage conditions
can result in damage to equipment, loss of data, and
erroneous readings in monitoring systems (Fig. 23-9).
The leading day-to-day cause of small low-energy
spikes is the switching on and off of an electrical
motor (inductive load switching). Air conditioners,
electrical power tools, furnace ignitions, electrostatic
copy machines, arc welders, and elevators are particu-
larly guilty of creating voltage spikes. The problems
created by the inductive load switching are very com-
mon in industrial plants. Larger spikes are typically
caused by lightning. A direct lightning hit, of course, is
catastrophic but of very low probability. However, a
distant lightning strike several miles away may be
transmitted through utility power lines and show up as
a voltage spike all along the line.
Electrical Noise
As contrasted to outright equip-
ment damage, computer “glitches” are caused by
electrical noise (Fig. 23-12). The same causes of volt-
age spikes can (at a lower voltage magnitude) cause
noise interference. Other electrical noise generators
include radio transmitters, fluorescent lights, computers,

load. Measurement of the current can be made without
disconnecting lines. This means that you engage one of
the lines with the split-core transformer of the tester. If the
ammeter reading is much higher than the full-load ampere
rating on the nameplate, the motor is probably shorted.
In a two- or three-phase motor, a partially shorted
winding produces a higher current reading in the shorted
phase. This becomes evident when the current in each
phase is measured.
MOTORS WITH SQUIRREL-CAGE
ROTORS
Loss in output torque at rated speed in an induction
motor may be due to opens in the squirrel-cage rotor.
To test the rotor and determine which rotor bars are
loose or open, place the rotor in a growler. Engage the
split-core ammeter around the lines going to the growler,
as shown in Fig. 23-14. Set the switch to the highest
current range. Switch on the growler and then set the
test unit to the approximate current range. Rotate the
rotor in the growler and take note of the current indica-
tion whenever the growler is energized. The bars and
end rings in the rotor behave similarly to a shorted sec-
ondary of a transformer. The growler windings act as
the primary. A good rotor will produce approximately
the same current indications for all positions of the
rotor. A defective rotor will exhibit a drop in the current
reading when the open bars move into the growler field.
business machines, and electrical devices such as light
sockets, wall receptacles, plugs, and loose electrical con-
nections. Interaction between system components may
generate sufficient noise to cause errors. Although most
electronic equipment has some internal noise filtering,
equipment located in severe noise environments may
encounter some interference. Transients are by far the
most common sort of power disturbance and fortunately,
often the easiest to correct. However, they may be diffi-
cult to detect since they last such a short time.
Power Outages
Power outages are a total interruption of power supply.
An interruption of a mere 15 milliseconds is considered
a blackout to sensitive equipment. Power outages can
cause problems for equipment users, most critical of
which are loss of valuable data and expensive time-
consuming reprogramming.
Outages tend to be caused by a larger-scale problem
than a transient. Interruptions may be caused, for example,
by utility or on-site load changes, on-site equipment mal-
function, or by faults on the power system (Fig. 23-13).

TESTING THE CENTRIFUGAL
SWITCH IN A SINGLE-PHASE
MOTOR
A defective centrifugal switch may not disconnect the
start winding at the proper time. To determine conclu-
sively that the start winding remains in the circuit,
place the split-core ammeter around one of the start-
winding leads. Set the instrument to the highest current
range. Turn on the motor switch. Select the appropriate

shorted secondary of a transformer. A motor with a shorted
winding will draw excessive current while running at no

A short between run and start windings may be deter-

the windings are shorted to one another.
full-line voltage indication on the meter signifies that the
capacitor is grounded to the can. A high-resistance ground
is evident by a voltage reading that is somewhat below the
line voltage. A negligible reading or a reading of no volt-
age will indicate that the capacitor is not grounded.
Measuring Capacity 
of a Capacitor
To measure the capacity of the capacitor, set the test unit’s
switch to the proper voltage range and read the line-
voltage indication. Then set to the appropriate current
range and read the capacitor current indication. During
the test, keep the capacitor on the line for a very short
period of time because motor starting electrolytic capaci-
tors are rated for intermittent duty (Fig. 23-18). The
capacity in microfarads is then computed by substituting
the voltage and current readings in the following formula,
assuming that a full 60-Hz line is used:

current range. Observe if there is any current in the
start-winding circuit. A current indication signifies
that the centrifugal switch did not open when the
motor came up to speed (Fig. 23-15).
CAPACITOR TESTING
Defective capacitors are very often the cause of trouble in
capacitor-type motors. Shorts, opens, grounds, and insuf-
ficient capacity in microfarads are conditions for which
capacitors should be tested to determine whether they are
good. You can determine a grounded capacitor by setting
the instrument on the proper voltage range and connecting
it and the capacitor to the line as shown in Fig. 23-17. A

of the voltmeter are in contact with the terminals of the
line under test. To measure current, the conventional
ammeter must be connected in series with the line so
that the current will flow through the ammeter.
To insert the ammeter means that you have to shut
down the equipment, break open the line, and connect
the ammeter and then start up the equipment to read the
meter. You have to do the same to remove the meter once
it has been used. Then there are other time-consuming
tests that may have to be made to locate the problem.
However, all this can be eliminated by the use of a
clamp-on volt-ammeter (Fig. 23-19).
An open capacitor will be evident if there is no cur-
rent indication in the test. A shorted capacitor is easily
detected. It will blow the fuse when the line switch is
turned on to measure the line voltage.
USING METERS TO CHECK 
FOR PROBLEMS
The voltmeter and the ohmmeter can be used to isolate
various problems. You should be able to read the
schematic and make the proper voltage or resistance mea-
surements. An incorrect reading will indicate the possibil-
ity of a problem. Troubleshooting charts will aid in
isolating the problem to a given system. Once you have
arrived at the proper system that may be causing the
symptoms noticed, you will then need to use the ohmme-
ter with the power off to isolate a section of the system.
Once you have zeroed in on the problem, you can locate it
by knowing what the proper reading should be. Deviation
from a stated reading of over 10% is usually indicative of
a malfunction, and in most cases the component part must
be replaced to assure proper operation and no call-backs.
Using a Volt-Ammeter for
Troubleshooting Electric Motors
Most electrical equipment will work satisfactorily if
the line voltage differs 10% from the actual name-
plate rating. In a few cases, however, a 10% voltage
drop may result in a breakdown. Such may be the case
with an induction motor that is being loaded to its
fullest capacity on both start and run. A 10% loss in
line voltage will result in a 20% loss in torque.
The full-load current rating on the nameplate is an
approximate value based on the average unit coming off
the manufacturer’s production line. The actual current for
any unit may vary as much as 10% at rated output.
However, a motor whose load current exceeds the rated
value by 20% or more will reduce the life of the motor
due to higher operating temperatures, and the reason for
excessive current should be determined. In many cases it
may simply be an overloaded motor. The percentage
increase in load will not correspond with the percentage
increase in load current. For example, in the case of a sin-
gle-phase induction motor, a 35% increase in current
may correspond to an 80% increase in torque output.
Operating conditions and behavior of electrical
equipment can be analyzed only by actual measure-
ment. A comparison of the measured terminal voltage
and current will check whether the equipment is oper-
ating within electrical specifications.
A voltmeter and an ammeter are needed for the two
basic measurements. To measure voltage, the test leads

Clamp-on volt-ammeter. (Amprobe Instrument)
Clamp-On Volt-Ammeter
The pocket-size volt-ammeter shown in Fig. 23-19 is
the answer to most troubleshooting problems on the
job. The line does not have to be disconnected to obtain
a current reading. The meter works on the transformer
principle that picks up the magnetic lines surrounding
a current-carrying conductor and then presents this as a
function of the entire amount flowing through the line.
Remember that earlier we discussed how the magnetic
field strength in the core of the transformer determines
the amount of current in the secondary. Well, the same
principle is used here to detect the flow of current and
how much.
To get transformer action, the line to be tested is
encircled with the split-type core simply by pressing
the trigger button. Aside from measuring terminal
voltages and load currents, the split-core ammeter-
voltmeter can be used to track down electrical difficulties
in electric motor repair.

Looking for Grounds
To determine whether a winding is grounded or has a
very low value of insulation resistance, connect the unit
and test leads as shown in Fig. 23-20. Assuming that the
available line voltage is approximately 120 V, use the
unit’s lowest voltage range. If the winding is grounded
to the frame, the test will indicate full-line voltage.
A high-resistance ground is simply a case of low
insulation resistance. The indicated reading for a high-
resistance ground will be a little less than line voltage. A
winding that is not grounded will be evidenced by a small
or negligible reading. This is mainly due to the capacitive
effect between the windings and the steel lamination.
To locate the grounded portion of the windings,
disconnect the necessary connection jumpers and test.
Grounded sections will be detected by a full-line volt-
age indication.
Looking for Opens
To determine whether a winding is open, connect test
leads as shown in Figs. 23-21 and 23-22. If the winding
is open, there will be no voltage indication. If the circuit
is not open, the voltmeter indication will read full-line
voltage.

One of the quickest ways to troubleshoot is to check
out symptoms and possible causes in a chart. This
allows for quick isolation of the cause and suggests
possible corrections. Both three-phase motors and
their starters can be checked quickly this way.

each 10°C increase of winding temperature. Therefore,
long winding life requires normal operating temperatures.
Ventilation
Forced ventilation is generally an inherent design fea-
ture of induction motors. Decreased cooling air volume
caused by blocked air passages, blower failure, or low
air density at higher altitudes leads to overheating and
shortened winding life.
Ambient Temperature
The insulation system of motors is usually designed to
operate at a maximum 40°C (104°F) ambient tempera-
ture. Any increase of ambient over 40°C requires de-
rating the motor or its expected life will be shortened.
Factors that raise input air temperature include place-
ment of motors in discharge airstreams from other
equipment and high-temperature locations.
To calculate the de-rating required for high ambi-
ent temperatures, multiply the ambient factor
obtained from Fig. 23-23 by the rated horsepower of
the motor. The ambient factor from Fig. 23-23 can
also be used to up-rate motors used in ambient tem-
peratures under 40°C (104°F).
MOTOR LIFE
The stator windings of integral horsepower ac motors
are capable of full-power operation for many years.
However, winding life can be shortened by any combi-
nation of the following:
• Mechanical damage produces weak spots in the
insulation. It can occur during maintenance of the
motor or result from such operating problems as
severe vibration.
• Excessive moisture encountered in service causes
deterioration of the insulation.
• High dielectric stress such as voltage surges or
excess input current, can cause overheating and insu-
lation deterioration.
• High temperature reduces the ability of the insula-
tion system to withstand mechanical or electrical
abuse. Over temperature is usually a result of poor
installation or misapplication of the motor.
Regardless of the reason for failures, the obvious result
is thermal degradation of the insulation-or burnouts. The
rate of insulation degradation is increased by higher tem-
perature. In fact, insulation life is reduced by about half for

Whenever a motor is de-rated or up-rated, the start-
ing, pull-up, and breakdown torques remain the same
as the nameplate rating, but the bearings, shaft, and
other components may be subjected to life that is a
function of the new rating.
PERFORMANCE
CHARACTERISTICS
Performance characteristics of motors change when they
are operated on high or low voltages at rated frequency.
Table 23-5 shows the characteristic and the change when
operated 10% above rated voltage and 10% below rated
voltage. Winding failures resulting from extreme voltage
variation are identical to those of overloads because the
input current is uniformly excessive. 
Voltage Unbalance
Voltage unbalance occurs when the phase voltages differ
from one another. At one extreme this phenomenon
occurs as single phasing. It can also occur in a more sub-
tle form as voltage differences among the three phases.
Single Phasing
A single-phase motor at standstill
will not start and the large inrush current overheats the
windings rapidly. If the single phasing occurs when
running, the motor will continue to supply torque, but
the input current to the remaining two phases increases,
causing overheating.
Voltage Unbalance

When the voltage varies among the three phases,

Fig. 23-25
Diagram showing protective devices.
Voltage unbalances are caused by the following
conditions:
• Unequal loading of the three-phase system 
• Unequal tap settings on transformers
• Poor connections in the power supply
• Open delta transformer systems
• Improper function of capacitor banks
The winding failure pattern from either single phas-
ing or voltage unbalance will be similar. Figure 23-24
shows two phases that are overheated in a Y-connected
motor. A delta-connected motor will have one over-
heated phase.
MOTOR PROTECTION
In each of the abnormal operating conditions listed
over loading, voltage regulation, and voltage unbal-
ance—the risk of excessive winding temperature
exists because input current is higher than nameplate
current. Motor controls and protective devices must
prevent input current from exceeding nameplate cur-
rent for extended periods.
The National Electrical Code has established stan-
dards that apply to the control and protection of motors
and associated circuits. For example, Fig. 23-25 is a
general circuit for the installation of squirrel-cage
inductor motors. Consult the National Electrical Code
for complete requirements for all installations.
Motor controllers and their associated circuits will
vary among different models as well as different con-
troller manufacturers. Figure 23-26 is a functional
schematic diagram of a motor controller that incorpo-
rates overload protection. Good engineering practice
emphasizes using three overload relays, one in each
phase line of the motor, to give protection from voltage
unbalance conditions. The size of the controller and
overload protection relays must be in accordance with
the controller manufacturer’s specifications as well as
the National Electrical Code.
As a further safeguard against motor failure due to
prolonged locked rotor conditions, the overload pro-
tection should trip out in 15 seconds or less at locked-
rotor current.
DC MOTOR PROBLEMS
One of the problems associated with dc motors is high
maintenance costs in both time and materials. They do
have a tendency to need attention at the commutator
and brush level. Figure 23-27 shows some of the prob-
lems associated with worn or damaged commutators.

Figure 23-27A. The pitch bar-marking produces
low or burned spots on the commutator surface that
equals half or all the number of poles of the motor.
Figure 23-27B. Streaking on the commutator sur-
face denotes the beginning of serious metal transfer to
the carbon brush.
Figure 23-27C. Heavy slot bar-marking involves
etching of the trailing edge of the commutator bar in
relation to the numbered conductors per slot.
Figure 23-27D. Threading of the commutator with
fine lines is a result of excessive metal transfer leading
to resurfacing and excessive brush wear.
Figure 23-27E. Copper drag is an abnormal
amount of excessive commutator material at the trail-
ing edge of the bar. Although rare, flashover may occur
if not corrected.

material in the brush or the atmosphere. Satisfactory com-
mutator surfaces are shown in Fig. 23-28. Determine desir-
able and undesirable commutator surfaces by checking
these with those shown in the previous figure. Figure 23-29
shows what can be done to correct the situation.

SOLID-STATE EQUIPMENT
TROUBLESHOOTING
Troubleshooting is easier with solid-state equipment
since it is usually made with printed circuit boards or
modules that can be identified as the cause of the prob-
lem and removed to be exchanged by another board or
circuit module of the same type. Many are removed by
pulling the card from clips and others have plugs that
have to be disconnected.
Most of the devices are self-diagnosing. LEDs are
used to indicate possible problems not only in the cir-
cuitry or equipment as a whole but also in individual
devices. In fact, many pieces of equipment are self-
diagnosing to the point of telling you what to replace to
repair the device.
In many of these devices a diode is either shorted
or open. You can check the diode using a VOM and
changing the probes across the diode. The diode, if
good, will read high resistance in one direction and low
resistance in the other. If the diode is shorted, there will
be a low-resistance reading in both directions. If the
diode is open, there will be an infinite reading in both

CHAPTER

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
1. Identify the prominent career areas in electricity.
2. List the educational requirements necessary to
become an electrical engineer.
3. Identify the job responsibilities of a maintenance
electrician.
4. Define entrepreneur.

Industrial Electrician
The industrial electrician requires a 4- to 5-year appren-
ticeship with 28 credits required to graduate. During
this time the apprentice learns to install, maintain, and
repair machinery for an industrial employer and gain
knowledge about ac/dc fundamentals, motors, hydraulics/
pneumatics, programmable logic controls, and trans-
formers. In addition, study topics such as codes, safety
issues, schematic drawing and schematic print reading
are mastered.
INDUSTRIES THAT EMPLOY
ELECTRICIANS 
The field of electricity offers a variety of career oppor-
tunities. Electricians are employed by many different
industries, from steel plants to drug manufacturers,
from coal mines to the merchant marine.
Many industries that rely heavily on electrical
equipment hire full-time electricians to keep that
equipment in good working order. For example, the
aluminum industry needs electricians to install and
repair electrical fixtures, apparatus, and control equip-
ment. In the iron and steel industry, electricians install
wiring and fixtures, and hook up electrically operated
equipment. Electrical repairers (motor inspectors) keep
the wiring, motors, switches, and other electrical equip-
ment in good working condition. The paper industry
employs electricians to repair wiring, motors, control
panels, and switches.
Railroad companies employ electrical workers to
install and maintain the wiring and electrical equip-
ment in locomotives, cars, and railroad buildings. Some
workers also lay and maintain power lines.
Ships at sea need their own crew of maintenance
workers on board. In the merchant marine industry, the
ship’s electrician repairs and maintains electrical equip-
ment, such as generators and motors. The electrician
tests wiring for short circuits and removes and replaces
fuses and defective lights.
In hospitals, the lives of patients often depend on
equipment powered by electricity. Proper maintenance
and quick repair of this equipment are both vital. Many
hospitals employ full-time electricians and electronics
technicians for this type of maintenance.
Factories that make medicines also rely on electri-
cians to keep equipment working properly and prevent-
ing costly breakdowns. Electricians who work for these
companies also install and repair various types of elec-
trical equipment.
Electricians are involved in the coal mining indus-
try. They check and install electrical wiring in and
around the mines. In addition, they help, repair, and
maintain the machinery used for mining. Today’s cars
have a number of electrically operated devices and sys-
tems as well as onboard computers. In the auto industry,
electrical engineers design the car’s electrical systems,
such as on board computers, the ignition system, lights,
and accessories.
In the construction industry, electricians assemble
install wire systems for heat, light, power, air-conditioning,
and refrigeration. Electrical inspectors then check these
systems to make sure they work properly and comply with
electrical codes and standards. The inspectors visit work-
sites to inspect new and existing wiring, lighting, sound
and security systems, as well as the generating equip-
ment. They also check the installation of all electrical
wiring for heating and air-conditioning systems, kitchen
appliances, motors, and other components.
CAREERS IN ELECTRICITY
Although each industry has its own special require-
ments, careers in electricity can be divided into general
categories: 
• Electrical engineer
• Industrial electrician
• Construction electrician
• Maintenance electrician
• Electric motor control electrician
There are other types of electricans who specialize:
• Industrial electrician (motor controls)
• Residential electrician (homes and apartments)
• Maintenance electrician (all areas where needed)
426
Careers in Electricity

Engineering graduates usually begin work under
the supervision of experienced engineers. With experi-
ence and proven ability, they advance to positions of
greater responsibility. Electrical engineers should be
able to work as part of a team and have creativity, an
analytical mind, and a capacity for detail. They should
be able to express their ideas well, both orally and in
writing.
The employment outlook for electrical engineers is
good. Increased demand for computers, for electrical
and electronic consumer goods, for military electronics,
and for communications and power generating equip-
ment will increase the need for engineers in these fields.
Construction Electrician
As stated earlier, construction electricians assemble
and install wire systems for heat, light, power, air-
conditioning, and refrigeration. They also install elec-
trical machinery, electronic equipment, controls, and
signal and communications systems. 
Construction electricians must be able to read
blueprints and specifications. For safety reasons, they
must follow the regulations in the National Electrical
Code, and their work must also conform to local elec-
trical codes.
There are an estimated 450,000 construction
electricians in the United States. Most work for elec-
trical contractors or are self-employed as contractors.
Some work for government agencies and businesses
that do their own electrical work. Training for a career
as a construction electrician usually involves a 4-year
apprenticeship program. Apprenticeship programs are
sponsored and supervised by local union-management
committees. The programs include both classroom and
on-the-job training. To qualify for an apprenticeship,
an applicant usually must be a high school or voca-
tional school graduate. Courses in electricity, electron-
ics, mechanical drawing, science, and shop provide a
good background.
Physical strength is not essential, but skill with
one’s hands, agility, and good health are important.
Good color vision is essential because electrical wires
are often identified by color.
Electricians who install residential wiring and
equipment are usually referred to as construction elec-
tricians since they usually work with new or remodeled
housing. This type of work also serves to introduce
most entry level people to electrical work. By doing
on-the-job tasks for a number of years, the electrician’s
helper is also an assistant who may not be an appren-
tice working with a union contractor, but with a small
town skilled electrician.
• Inside electrician (usually a maintenance electrician
for an institution)
• Limited energy electrician (electrician who works
with low voltage installations—closed circuit TV,
communications systems, and cable problems)
Electrical Engineer
Electrical engineers design, develop, and supervise the
manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment.
The projects they work on include electric motors
and generators, communications equipment, electronic
equipment such as heart pacemakers, pollution-
measuring devices, radar, computers, lasers, missile
guidance systems, and electrical applicances of all
kinds. They also design and operate facilities for the
generation and distribution of electric power.
Usually, electrical engineers specialize in one of
the major areas such as electronics, computers, electri-
cal equipment, or power. Within these areas, there are
still more specialized fields such as missile guidance
and tracking systems.
About 450,000 people are employed as electrical
engineers. Most work for makers of electrical and elec-
tronic equipment, aircraft and parts, business machines,
and professional and scientific equipment. Many work
in the communications industry for electric light and
power companies. Electrical engineers also work for
government agencies, for construction firms, for engi-
neering consultants, or as independent consulting engi-
neers. Others teach in colleges and universities.
Electricial engineers are responsible for design and
development of a wide variety of equipment. A bache-
lor’s degree in engineering is required for most begin-
ning engineering jobs. In a typical 4-year curriculum,
the first 2 years are spent studying basic sciences
(mathematics, physics, introductory engineering) and
the humanities, social sciences, and English. The last
2 years are devoted mostly to specialized engineering
courses.
Graduate training is now required for many jobs,
particularly for teaching and for jobs in specialized
areas. A number of colleges and universities offer 5-year
master’s degree programs.
All 50 states and the District of Columbia require
licensing for engineers whose work may affect life,
health, or property, or who offer their services to the
public. In order to obtain a license, an engineer usually
must have a degree from an accredited engineering col-
lege, 4 years of related work experience, and must pass
a state examination. They are called professional engi-
neers (PEs).
Careers in Electricity  
427

In most cities a license is required for employment.
The electrician must pass a test which requires a thor-
ough knowledge of the craft and of state and local
building codes.
Employment outlook is good; the number of con-
struction electricians is expected to grow faster than the
average for all occupations. In any given year, the num-
ber of employed persons depends on the amount of
construction activity. When jobs are not available,
however, construction electricians may be able to
transfer to related work. For example, they may work
as maintenance electricians.
Maintenance Electrician
Maintenance electricians keep lighting systems, trans-
formers, generators, and other electrical equipment in
good working order. They may also install new equipment.
The duties of maintenance electricians depend on
where they are employed. Electricians working in large
factories may repair particular items such as motors
and welding machines. Those in office buildings and
small plants usually fix all kinds of electrical equip-
ment. Regardless of location, electricians spend much
of their time doing preventive maintenance. They
check equipment to locate and correct defects before
breakdowns occur. An estimated 350,000 people
work as maintenance electricians. More than half are
employed by manufacturing industries. Many others
work for utilities, mines, railroads, or the government.
Most maintenance electricians learn their trade
on the job or through apprenticeship programs. The
apprenticeship programs and the requirements for get-
ting into the programs are the same as those for con-
struction electricians. Hand skills, agility, and good
health are important. Good color vision is required.
Maintenance electricians check equipment to locate
defects before machine failure results.
Because of increased use of electrical and elec-
tronic equipment by industry, the demand for mainte-
nance electricians will increase. Growth in the number
of job openings is expected to be steady since the
demand for maintenance electricians is not very sensi-
tive to ups and downs in the economy.
Limited Energy Electrician
Limited energy electricians install, maintain, replace,
and repair electrical systems and equipment of under
100 volt-amperes. 
The work may include:
• Basic telephone cable installation and termination
• Telephone station and control equipment installation
for telephone systems
• Fire alarms system installation and repair
• Intrusion/burglar alarm system installation and
repair
• Audio/visual system installation and repair
• Closed-circuit television systems
• Central control systems
• Nurse call and emergency call systems
• Installation and repair of sound and public address
systems
• Fiber optics
• Programmable and controlling instruments
• Local area networks (LANs) and structured wiring
systems
This type of electrician works inside and outside.
The job requires standing, bending, and reaching in cold
and wet conditions, and working either in confined
crawl spaces or at heights.
GENERAL INFORMATION
The electrician may find a position in the physical
plant departments of higher education institutions and
other state institutions. Some positions in the class may
require:
• A willingness to work in an environment containing
dust, grime, odor, fumes, and high levels of noise.
• You to walk, stand, and work while bending and
stooping for extended periods.
• You to lift and carry heavy objects; to work from lad-
ders, scaffolds, and other above ground locations such
as roofs.
• You to work overhead while lying on your back, or to
work outdoors in inclement weather.
The inside wireman’s job is to distribute and con-
nect the customer’s electrical equipment to the outside
power source. The inside wireman installs and main-
tains all of the various types of electrical systems found
in commercial and industrial facilities. 
This equipment may include lighting, receptacles,
motors, heating equipment, and systems that control
the operation of all of a facility’s energy usage.
The inside wireman installs conduit systems that
contain the wire from the motor control centers or
panel boards to all of the equipment that use electricity.
Those conduits may contain power cables or control
cables. Many of the conduit systems are exposed and
must be installed to exacting standards using neat and
workmanlike craftsmanship.

STARTING YOUR OWN BUSINESS
In your town, there are many businesses—some large and
some small. Some of the small businesses may be owned
and managed by one person. Others may be medium-
sized, employing several people. There may also be large
industries in your town. For example, there may be a large
manufacturing plant. Or, the headquarters of a large com-
pany may be located in your town. Either of these could
employ hundreds or even thousands of people.
Most large businesses started as small businesses.
This, also, is true of some large corporations. Building
up a business requires skill and hard work. It can be dif-
ficult to imagine the energy needed to start a business.
Anyone starting a small business faces a variety of tasks.
The person, first, must have the money needed. (This
money may have to be borrowed.) He or she also must
have a product or service that can be sold at a profit. He
or she must have a way of distributing the product or ser-
vice to the public. The smaller the business, the more of
these jobs the owner/operator may have to do personally.
In some small businesses, the owner/operator has all of
these responsibilities. In larger businesses, such duties
are divided. For example, one person (or one depart-
ment) may be in charge of making the product. Another
may be in charge of advertising it. A third person may be
in charge of delivering or shipping the item. Usually, the
larger the business, the greater the number of people
needed for each of these duties.
The person who starts a business is usually an
entrepreneur. An entrepreneur is anyone who organizes
and manages a business. This person also assumes the
risks of the business. This means that the entrepreneur
is responsible for paying the business expenses. All
responsibility for the success of the business rests with
the entrepreneur.
A person who is self-employed, or in business for
himself, is an entrepreneur. All entrepreneurs face four
similar problems. These problems are:
• Identifying a need
• Finding a product to satisfy the need
The work of an inside wireman can vary. One day
the inside wireman could be installing a fire alarm sys-
tem or security system in a high rise building and the
next day he may be installing conduit in a ditch on the
outside of the building. 
Inside wiremen also install electrical systems in 
• Industrial facilities such as chemical plants
• Power plants
• Chip manufacturing facilities
• Distribution centers
Each type of installation has specific electrical
needs and systems to support those needs. While there
are many tasks associated with the inside wireman
classification, the apprenticeship training provides all
of the knowledge necessary for an individual to per-
form these tasks in a professional manner while help-
ing the individual to sharpen natural abilities so as to
become the best worker in the electrical construction
and maintenance industry.
Most states require licensing of anyone performing
electrical work.
1. In most states you must be registered in a state
approved apprenticeship program to receive an
apprentice license.
2. Upon completion of the apprenticeship you will be
required to pass a state examination in order to
receive a general journeyman electrician’s license.
Electricians currently earn around $31.90 per hour
and can expect some time off work due to construction
market conditions in a typical year.

• Financing the business
• Selling the product
Now, let us look at each of these concerns:
• All successful businesses have one thing in common.
They were started because someone noticed that
people needed or wanted an item or service. 
• Once an entrepreneur has noticed a need, he can then
find a product to fill the need. This product might be
an item (such as an electrical device). It might also
be a service (such as an electrical product repair).
• Starting a business is not easy. Succeeding in busi-
ness is even harder. Anyone who starts a business is
an entrepreneur, but not all entrepreneurs are suc-
cessful. For an entrepreneur to be successful, the
business must be successful.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF
LEADERSHIP
Our society has always prized resourcefulness and ini-
tiative. These qualities were essential to the westward
expansion of the American frontier and the early shap-
ing of the values of the infant Republic. Some of the
values of our American culture have been shaped by
our history, which especially in its early days, required
strong decisions and firm enterprise. The events that
are now simply history, required fast commitments and
unwavering resolution from those who took part in
them.
Though the accidentals of historical influence may
change, it’s the basic forces that remain much the
same. These resulting forces are the problems and
challenges our society thinks are as puzzling and diffi-
cult as those posed for our ancestors. Because ours is a
democratic society, every man and woman is prompted
to develop leadership qualities.
Good leaders are characterized by effective com-
munication, firmness of will and singleness of pur-
pose, and moral integrity. While it seems these
qualities are more readily apparent in some, all of us
can develop, in some degree, the skills needed for
effective leadership. Membership in student clubs—
such as VICA or Technology Education Clubs—can
help develop leadership ability. A club, by its nature
(bringing together as it does individuals with a single
common interest) has perhaps less diversity than soci-
ety generally. Still, it can offer you an opportunity to
practice effective communication and learn the skills
needed to work within a group, such as a committee.
The valuable qualities of leadership are often exercised
in the most quiet situations. Each of you will be given
opportunities to exert the force of leadership to bring
about a decision, resolve a crisis, or prompt an action.
Leadership is essential to active participation in a
democratic society.
*Employment of Electricians
Electricians held about 705,000 jobs in 2006 (latest
year for statistics). About 68% of wage and salary
workers were employed in the construction industry;
while the remainder worked as maintenance electri-
cians in other industries. In addition, about one in
eleven electricians were self employed. In the year
2016 the Bureau of Labor is predicting that about
757,000 electricians will be employed, or about a 7%
increase from 2006.
Because of the widespread need for electrical services,
electrician jobs are found in all parts of the country.
*Earnings
In May 2006, median hourly earnings of electricians
were $20.97. The middle 50% earned between $16.07
and $27.71. The lowest 10% earned less than $12.76,
and the highest 10% earned more than $34.95. Median
hourly earnings in the industries employing the largest
numbers of electricians in May 2006 were as follows:
Motor vehicle parts manufacturing........
$31.90
Local government..................................
$23.80
Nonresidential building construction.....
$20.58
Building equipment contractors.............
$20.47
Employment services.............................
$17.15
Apprentices usually start at between 40 and 50%
of the rate paid to fully trained electricians, depending
on experience. As apprentices become more skilled,
they receive periodic pay increases throughout the
course of their training.
Some electricians are members of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Among unions rep-
resenting maintenance electricians are the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; the International
Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine, and
Furniture Workers; the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers; the International
Union, United Automobile, Aircraft and Agricultural
Implement Workers of America; and the United Steel-
workers of America.

Related Occupations
To install and maintain electrical systems, electricians
combine manual skill and knowledge of electrical mate-

and repairers; electrical and electronics installers and
repairers; electronic home entertainment equipment
installers and repairers; and elevator installers and
repairers.
THE FUTURE
The future for the controls engineer or technician
includes exposure to many different types of auto-
mated equipment utilizing complex circuitry and pro-
gramming. These automated programs will demand a
constant updating of equipment, programming, and
personnel. 
The increasing presence of modern programma-
ble automation controllers (PACs), using the same
open Ethernet communications standards and object-
oriented programming brings the benefits of com-
moditization. This includes lower prices, common
device compatibility, and “components off the shelf”
(COTS) availability.
The 
programming 
and 
maintenance 
skills
required of one PAC platform is easily transferrable to
another. This lowers integrating and training costs and
increases labor flexibility and efficiency.
Presently, only the traditional distributed control
systems (DCS) hosting a development and mainte-
nance environment for the special needs of process
applications—the seamless translation between pipe
and instrumentation diagram (P&ID) and controls
architecture. 
A common tag database between human–machine
interface (HMI) and control system specialization has
warranted the elevated cost control applications.
However, this doesn’t quite justify the expense of a
DCS or the more complex discrete applications that
test the upper boundaries of PAC capability. 
That means the extra costs of a DCS is overkill
for the task at hand. In turn, this calls for a controls
technician or controls engineer well versed in all
aspects of motors, programs, and components included
in any system.

Electrical and Electronic Symbols Used in Schematics
Diagrams are more useful if you know what the
symbols mean. The schematic diagram of an electrical
circuit aids in being able to troubleshoot. They are also
useful in making it possible to understand what hap-
pens in a given arrangement of symbols.
These symbols are part of ARI Standard 130-88.
ARI is the abbreviation for the Air Conditioning and
Refrigeration Institute.
In some instances notes are added near the symbol
for a special purpose. For instance, if IEC shows up
near the symbol it means the symbol has been recom-
mended by the International Electro-technical Com-
mission. The following symbols are not necessarily in
alphabetical order.

gized.
3. The solenoid valve is used to open and close a valve
electrically. It opens by energizing the coil and magnet-
ically lifting the plunger attached to the valve ball; it
closes when the coil is de-energized, aided by plunger
weight and fluid pressure. 
4. Eddy currents are generated by a magnetic field when it
comes near a piece of metal. They can cause problems

eign materials.
4. Motor-bearings fail because of certain conditions, such
as: dirty grease, lack of grease, and foreign matter cont-
amination.
5. Oil viscosity is important to a motor to assure lubrica-
tion when needed. Viscosity means a resistance to a
liquid’s flow.
6. Motors should be oiled at least every 6 months. Of
course, sealed motors don’t need to be oiled.

16. Ambient temperature is that which surrounds the motor
in its operating location.
17. Overheating and misuse of motor load capabilities.
18. Yes.
19. Take the meter probes and check the leads on the diode.
Then reverse the probes and check the diode. What you
will find is a path for current to flow in one direction, but
not in the other. That indicates normal operation. How-
ever, if you don’t get a reading on the meter in either
direction, or, if you get a reading in both directions, it
means a problem with the diode.
Reading in one direction of the probes—Diode is OK.
Reading in both directions—Diode is shorted.
No reading in either direction—Diode is open.
