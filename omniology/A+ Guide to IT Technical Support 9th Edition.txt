Introduction: CompTIA A+ Guide  
to IT Technical Support
CompTIA A+ Guide to IT Technical Support, Ninth Edition was written to be the very best 
tool on the market today to prepare you to support desktop and laptop computers as well as 
mobile devices. Previously titled, A+ Guide to Mangaging and Maintaining Your PC for eight 
editions, the text has been updated to include the most current hardware and software tech-
nologies, this book takes you from the just-a-user level to the I-can-fix-this level for hardware 
and software matters. It achieves its goals with an unusually effective combination of tools that 
powerfully reinforce both concepts and hands-on, real-world experiences. It also provides thor-
ough preparation for the content on the new CompTIA A+ 220-901 and 220-902 Certification 
exams. Competency in using a computer is a prerequisite to using this book. No background 
knowledge of electronics is assumed. An appropriate prerequisite course for this book would 
be a general course in computer applications.
This book includes:
	 Several in-depth, hands-on projects are spaced throughout each chapter that invite you 
to immediately apply and reinforce critical thinking and troubleshooting skills and are 
designed to make certain that you not only understand the material, but also execute  
procedures and make decisions on your own.
	 Comprehensive review and practice end-of-chapter material, including a chapter  
summary, key terms, review questions that focus on A+ content, critical thinking 
questions, and real-world problems to solve.
	 Step-by-step instructions on installation, maintenance, optimization of system per-
formance, and troubleshooting.
	 A wide array of photos, drawings, and screen shots support the text, displaying in 
detail the exact software and hardware features you will need to understand to set up, 
maintain, and troubleshoot personal computers and small networks.
In addition, the carefully structured, clearly written text is accompanied by graphics that 
provide the visual input essential to learning and to help students master difficult subject  
matter. For instructors using the book in a classroom, instructor resources are available online.
Coverage is balanced—while focusing on new hardware and software, the text also 
covers the real work of an IT support technician, where some older technology remains 
in widespread use and still needs support. For example, the book covers how to use a 
64-bit operating system to support the latest processors, but also addresses how to get 
the most out of a 32-bit OS with limited hardware resources. At the time of writing 
this text, Windows 8 and Windows 7 are the most popular Microsoft operating ­systems 
used on desktop and laptop computers. The text focuses on supporting Windows 8/7 
­systems, while also including light coverage of Windows Vista where knowledge of Vista 
is ­necessary for the CompTIA A+ 900 series exams. The text also has light coverage of 
Linux and Mac OS X operating systems for desktops and laptops and Android, iOS, and 
Windows Phone operating systems for mobile devices. Other new technologies covered 
include ­virtualization, cloud computing, UEFI firmware, GPT partitioning systems, and 
support for mobile device hardware.
This book provides thorough preparation for CompTIA’s A+ 220-901 and 220-902 
Certification examinations. This certification credential’s popularity among employers is 
growing exponentially, and obtaining certification increases your ability to gain employ-
ment and improve your salary. To get more information on CompTIA’s A+ certification 
and its ­sponsoring organization, the Computing Technology Industry Association, see 
their website at www.comptia.org.

n this chapter, you learn how Windows uses TCP/IP protocols and 
standards to create and manage network connections, including how 
computers are identified and addressed on a network. You also learn to 
connect a computer to a network and how to set up and secure a small 
wired or wireless network.
This chapter prepares you to assume total responsibility for supporting 
both wired and wireless networks in a small-office/home-office (SOHO) 
environment. In the chapter, “Supporting Network Hardware,” you learn 
more about the hardware used in networking, including network devices, 
connectors, cabling, networking tools, and the types of networks used for 
Internet connections. So let’s get started by looking at how TCP/IP works 
in the world of Windows networking.
A+ Exam Tip
Much of the content in this chapter applies to both the  
A+ 220-901 exam and the A+ 220-902 exam.
Caution
You can damage a computer component with static electricity if you touch the component when you are 
not grounded. Before you touch a sensitive computer component, you first need to dissipate any static electricity on your 
body. You learn how to do that in the appendix, “Safety Procedures and Environmental Concerns.” For now, to protect a 
working component your instructor has on display, don’t touch; just look.
 examine the power Supply, Motherboard, and 
expansion Cards Inside a Desktop Case
If you have access to a desktop computer with the case cover removed, examine its components and 
answer the following questions. As you look, remember to not touch anything inside the case unless 
you are properly grounded.

1. Identify the power supply, motherboard, and any expansion cards that might be installed on the 
motherboard. Remember: Don’t touch a component unless you are properly grounded. If the case is plugged 
into a power source, don’t touch inside the case even if you are grounded.
2. Identify the cooler that is installed on top of the processor. This cooler is likely to have a fan on top and a 
heat sink that you can’t see. The processor is hidden under the cooler.
3. Identify the memory modules and memory slots. How many memory slots are there? How many of these slots 
are populated?
4. If an expansion card is installed, what type of ports does the card provide at the rear of the case? Find the 
one screw that is used to attach the expansion card to the case.
5. Locate the screws that are attaching the motherboard to the case. How many screws are used? Do you see 
screw holes in the motherboard that are not being used? As a general rule of thumb, up to nine screws can be 
used to attach a motherboard to a case.
6. How many power cables are coming from the power supply? How many of these cables are connected to the 
motherboard? To other devices inside the computer? Identify each type of power cable the system is using.
7. Find the screws or clips that are attaching the power supply to the case. Is the power supply attached using 
screws, clips, or both screws and clips?

Here are the steps to make a straight-through cable using the T568B standard:
1. Use wire cutters to cut the twisted-pair cable the correct length plus a few extra inches.
2. If your RJ-45 connectors include boots, slide two boots onto the cable.
3. Use wire strippers to strip off about two inches of the plastic jacket from the end of the wire. To do that, put 
the wire in the stripper and rotate the stripper around the wire to score the jacket (see Figure 15-35). You 
can then pull off the jacket.

reaL prObLem 2-1 Taking a Lab Computer Apart and Putting It Back Together
A PC technician needs to be comfortable with taking apart a computer and putting it back together. 
In most situations, the essential tools you’ll need for the job are an ESD strap, a Phillips-head screwdriver, 
a flathead screwdriver, paper, and pen.
Working with a partner and using a lab computer designated to be disassembled, take a computer apart. 
It is not necessary to remove the processor or memory modules from the motherboard, but be very careful 
to properly support the motherboard and processor as you remove them from the case. Then reassemble 
the system. Don’t replace the computer case panel until your instructor has inspected all cable connections. 
Then turn on the computer and verify that all is working.
reaL prObLem 2-2 Setting Up a Service Center for Laptops
If you intend to set up your own computer repair shop, you might want to consider becoming a service 
center for a few brands of the more popular laptops. Reasons to become an authorized service center are 
that you have access to service manuals, parts lists, and wholesale parts for laptops. Do the following to 
research becoming an authorized service center:
1.  Select a brand of laptops that you think you would like to service.
2.  Research the website of this manufacturer and answer these questions:
a. Where is the closest authorized service center for this brand of laptops?
b. What are the requirements to become an authorized service center? Print the webpage showing the 
requirements.
c. Is A+ certification one of those requirements?
Real Problems, Real Solutions allow you to 
apply what you’ve learned in the chapter to a 
real-life situation.
Thinking Critically sections require you to 
analyze and apply what you’ve learned.

L
ike many other computer users, you have probably used your 
personal computer to play games, update your Facebook profile, 
write papers, or build Excel worksheets. This text takes you from being 
an end user of your computer to becoming an information technology 
(IT) support technician able to support all types of personal computers. 
The only assumption made here is that you are a computer user—that 
is, you can turn on your machine, load a software package, and use 
that software to accomplish a task. No experience in electronics is 
assumed.
As an IT support technician, you’ll want to become A+ certified, 
which is the industry standard certification for IT support technicians. 
This text prepares you to pass the A+ 220-901 and 220-902 exams by 
CompTIA (www.comptia.org). The exams are required by CompTIA 
for A+ Certification.
In this chapter, you learn to recognize various hardware components 
you’ll find inside desktop computer and laptop cases and about the 
tools you’ll need to work inside the case. Later in the text, you learn 
to take a desktop and laptop apart and reassemble them.
A+ Exam Tip
As you work your way through a chapter, notice the green and 
blue A+ mapping icons underneath headings. These page elements help you know to 
which objectives on which exam the content applies. After studying each chapter, 
take a look at the grid at the beginning of this text and make sure you understand 
each objective listed in the grid that is covered in the chapter.

What’s Inside a Desktop Case
Before we discuss the parts inside a desktop case, let’s take a quick look at the case and the 
ports and switches on it. A computer case for any type of computer is sometimes called the 
chassis and houses the power supply, motherboard, processor, memory modules, expansion 
cards, hard drive, optical drive, and other drives. A computer case can be a tower case, a desk-
top case that lies flat on a desk, an all-in-one case used with an all-in-one computer, or a mobile case used 
with laptops and tablets. A tower case (see Figure 1-1) sits upright and can be as high as two feet and has 
room for several drives. Often used for servers, this type of case is also good for desktop computer users 
who anticipate upgrading, because tower cases provide maximum space for working inside a computer and 
moving components around. A desktop case lies flat and sometimes serves double-duty as a monitor stand. 
In the chapter, “Working Inside Desktop Computers and Laptops,” you learn how to work inside a tower 
case, desktop case, laptop case, and all-in-one case.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know how to identify 
the ports shown in Table 1-1.
Notes Don’t lay a tower case on its side when the computer is in use 
because the CD or DVD drive might not work properly. For the same reason, 
if a desktop case is designed to lie flat, don’t set it on its end when the 
computer is in use.
Table 1-1 lists ports you might find on a desktop or mobile computer. 
Consider this table your introduction to these ports so that you can 
recognize them when you see them. Later in the text, you learn more 
about the details of each port.
Port
Description
A VGA (Video Graphics Array) port, also called a DB-15 port, 
DB15 port, HD15 port, or DE15 port, is a 15-pin, D-shaped, 
female port that transmits analog video. (Analog means a con-
tinuous signal with infinite variations as compared with digital, 
which is a series of binary values—1s and 0s.) All older monitors 
use VGA ports. (By the way, the HD15 [high-definition 15-pin] 
name for the port is an older name that distinguishes it from the 
early 9-pin VGA ports.)
An S-Video port is a 4-pin or 7-pin round video port sometimes 
used to connect to a television. The 7-pin port is shown on the 
left. The 4-pin port is missing the extra pins in the middle and is 
the more common type.

Port
Description
A DVI (Digital Video Interface) port transmits digital or analog 
video. Three types of DVI ports exist, which you learn about in 
the chapter, “Supporting I/O Devices.”
An HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) port transmits 
digital video and audio (not analog transmissions) and is often 
used to connect to home theater equipment.
A DisplayPort transmits digital video and audio (not analog 
transmissions) and is slowly replacing VGA and DVI ports on 
personal computers.

Attribution 3.0, Macfan97
A Thunderbolt port transmits video, data, and power on the same 
port and cable and is popular with Apple computers. The port 
is shaped the same as the DisplayPort and is compatible with 
DisplayPort devices. Up to six peripherals (for example, moni-
tors and external hard drives daisy-chained together) can use the 
same Thunderbolt port.
A network port, also called an Ethernet port, or an RJ-45 port, 
is used by a network cable to connect to the wired network. Fast 
Ethernet ports run at 100 Mbps (megabits per second), and Giga-
bit Ethernet runs at 1000 Mbps or 1 Gbps (gigabits per second). 
A megabit is one million bits and a gigabit is one billion bits. A 
bit is a binary value of 1 or 0.
A system usually has three or more round audio ports, also called 
sound ports, for a microphone, audio in, audio out, and stereo 
audio out. These types of audio ports can transmit analog or digi-
tal data. If you have one audio cable to connect to a speaker or 
earbuds, plug it into the lime green sound port in the middle of 
the three ports. The microphone uses the pink port.
An S/PDIF (Sony/Philips Digital Interface) sound port connects 
to an external home theater audio system, providing digital au-
dio output and the best signal quality. S/PDIF ports always carry 
digital audio and can work with electrical or optical cable. When 
connected to a fiber-optic cable, the port is called an optical 
connector.
A USB (Universal Serial Bus) port is a multipurpose I/O port that 
comes in several sizes and is used by many different devices, in-
cluding printers, mice, keyboards, scanners, external hard drives, 
and flash drives. Some USB ports are faster than others. Hi-Speed 
USB 2.0 is faster than regular USB, and Super-Speed USB 3.0 is 
faster than USB 2.0.
A FireWire port (also called an IEEE 1394 port, pronounced  
“I-triple-E 1394 port”) is used for high-speed multimedia  
devices such as digital camcorders.

I know you’re eager to open a case and work inside it, but first let’s get familiar with the major components 
in the case and how to work with them safely so you don’t fry a motherboard or bend delicate connectors.

Port
Description
An external SATA (eSATA) port is used by an external hard drive 
or other device using the eSATA interface. eSATA is faster than 
FireWire.
A PS/2 port, also called a mini-DIN port, is a round 6-pin port 
used by a keyboard or mouse. The ports look alike but are not in-
terchangeable. On a desktop, the purple port is for the keyboard, 
and the green port is for the mouse. Many newer computers use 
USB ports for the keyboard and mouse rather than the older PS/2 
ports.
An older serial port, sometimes called a DB9 port, is a 9-pin 
male port used on older computers. It has been mostly replaced 
by USB ports. Occasionally, you see a serial port on a router 
where the port is used to connect the router to a device a techni-
cian can use to monitor and manage the router.
A parallel port, also called an LPT port, is a 25-pin female port 
used by older printers. This older port has been replaced by USB 
ports.
A modem port, also called an RJ-11 port, is used to connect dial-
up phone lines to computers. A modem port looks like a network 
port, but is not as wide. In the photo, the right port is a modem 
port and the left port is a network port, shown for comparison.

What’s Inside a Desktop Case
Here is a quick explanation of the main components installed in the case, which are called internal 
components:
­ 	The motherboard, processor, and cooler. The motherboard, also called the main board, the system 
board, or the techie jargon term, the mobo, is the largest and most important circuit board in the 
computer. The motherboard contains a socket to hold the processor or CPU. The central processing unit 
(CPU), also called the processor or microprocessor, does most of the processing of data and instructions 
for the entire system. Because the CPU generates heat, a fan and heat sink might be installed on top to 
keep it cool. A heat sink consists of metal fins that draw heat away from a component. The fan and heat 
sink together are called the processor cooler. Figure 1-3 shows the top view of a motherboard, and 
Figure 1-4 shows the ports on the side of a motherboard.

	Expansion cards. A motherboard has expansion slots to be used by expansion cards. An expansion card, 
also called an adapter card, is a circuit board that provides more ports than those provided by the 
motherboard. Figure 1-5 shows a video card that provides three video ports. Notice the cooling fan and 
heat sink on the card, which help to keep the card from overheating. The trend today is for most ports 
in a system to be provided by the motherboard (called onboard ports) and less use of expansion cards.

	Memory modules. A desktop motherboard has memory slots, called DIMM (dual inline memory module) 
slots, to hold memory modules. Figure 1-6 shows a memory module installed in one DIMM slot and three 
empty DIMM slots. Memory, also called RAM (random access memory), is temporary storage for data 
and instructions as they are being processed by the CPU. The memory module shown in Figure 1-6 
contains several RAM chips. Video cards also contain some embedded RAM chips for video memory.
	Hard drives and other drives. A system might have one or more hard drives, an optical drive, a tape drive, 
or, for really old systems, a floppy drive. A hard drive, also called a hard disk drive (HDD), is permanent 
storage used to hold data and programs. For example, the Windows 8 operating system and applications

drives are also shown in Figure 1-7. The larger hard drive is a magnetic drive, and the smaller hard drive is 
a solid-state drive. Each drive has two connections for cables: The power cable connects to the power  
supply, and another cable, used for data and instructions, connects to the motherboard.

	A power supply. A computer power supply, also known as a power supply unit (PSU), is a box installed 
in a corner of the computer case (see Figure 1-8) that receives and converts the house current so that 
components inside the case can use it. Most power supplies have a dual-voltage selector switch on the 
back of the computer case where you can switch the input voltage to the power supply to 115 V used in 
the United States or 220 V used in other countries. See Figure 1-9. The power cables can connect to and 
supply power to the motherboard, expansion cards, and drives.

Notes If you ever need to change the dual-voltage selector switch, be sure you first turn off the computer and 
unplug the power supply.

Form Factors Used By Desktop Cases, Power Supplies, 
and Motherboards
The desktop computer case, power supply, and motherboard must all be compatible and fit 
together as an interconnecting system. The standards that describe the size, shape, screw hole 
positions, and major features of these interconnected components are called form factors. Using 
a matching form factor for the motherboard, power supply, and case assures you that:
	 The motherboard fits in the case.
	 The power supply cords to the motherboard provide the correct voltage, and the connectors match the 
connections on the board.
	 The holes in the motherboard align with the holes in the case for anchoring the board to the case.
	 The holes in the case align with ports coming off the motherboard.
	 For some form factors, wires for switches and lights on the front of the case match up with connections 
on the motherboard.
	 The holes in the power supply align with holes in the case for anchoring the power supply to the case.
The two form factors used by most desktop and tower computer cases and power supplies are the ATX 
and microATX form factors. Motherboards use these and other form factors that are compatible with ATX 
or microATX power supplies and cases. You learn about other motherboard form factors in the chapter, 
“All About Motherboards.” Following are the important details about ATX and microATX.
ATX Form Factor 
ATX (Advanced Technology Extended) is the most commonly used form factor today. It is an open, 
nonproprietary industry specification originally developed by Intel in 1995, and has undergone several 
revisions since then. The original ATX form factor for cases had case fans blowing air into the case, but 
early revisions to the form factor had fans blowing air out of the case. Blowing air out of the case does a 
better job of keeping the system cool.
An ATX power supply has a variety of power connectors (see Figure 1-10). The power connectors are 
listed in Table 1-2 and several of them are described next.

Connector
Description
The 20+4 pin P1 connector has four pins removed so the connector can fit into a  
20-pin P1 motherboard connector.
The 4-pin 12-V connector is an auxiliary motherboard connector, which is used for 
extra 12-V power to the processor.
The 8-pin 12-V connector is an auxiliary motherboard connector, which is used for 
extra 12-V power to the processor, providing more power than the older 4-pin auxiliary 
connector.
The 4-pin Molex connector is used for older IDE (PATA or Parallel ATA) drives and some 
newer SATA drives. It can provide +5 V and +12 V to the drive.
The 15-pin SATA power connector is used for SATA (Serial ATA) drives. It can provide 
+3.3V, +5 V, and +12 V, although +3.3 V is seldom used.
The 4-pin Berg connector is used by older floppy disk drives (FDD).
The PCIe 6-pin connector provides an extra +12 V for high-end video cards using PCI  
Express, Version 1 standard.
The PCIe 8-pin connector provides an extra +12 V for high-end video cards using PCI  
Express, Version 2.
The PCIe 6/8-pin connector is used by high-end video cards using PCIe x16 slots to 
provide extra voltage to the card and can accommodate a 6-hole or 8-hole port. To get 
the 8-pin connector, combine both the 6-pin and 2-pin connectors.

What’s Inside a Desktop Case
Power connectors have evolved because components using new technologies require more power. As you 
read about the following types of power connectors and why each came to be, you’ll also learn about the 
evolving expansion slots and expansion cards that drove the need for more power:
	 20-pin P1 connector. The first ATX power supplies and motherboards used a single 20-pin P1 power 
connector that provided +3.3 volts, +5 volts, +12 volts, –12 volts, and an optional and rarely used –5 volts. 
See Figure 1-11. This 20-pin power connector was sufficient for powering expansion cards installed in 
PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) expansion slots on the motherboard (see Figure 1-12). Several 
versions of PCI slots evolved over time, which you learn about in the chapter, “All About Motherboards.”
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know about each connector listed in Table 1-2.

power, the ATX Version 
2.1 specifications added a 
4-pin auxiliary connector

provide an additional 12 V 
of power (see Figure 1-13). A 
power supply that provides 
this 4-pin 12-volt power 
cord is called an ATX12V 
power supply. Later boards 
replaced the 4-pin 12-volt 
power connector with an 
8-pin motherboard auxiliary 
connector that provided more 
amps for the processor.
	 24-pin or 20+4-pin P1 connector. Later, when faster PCI Express (PCIe) slots were added to 
motherboards, more power was required and a new ATX specification (ATX Version 2.2) allowed for a 
24-pin P1 connector, also called the 20+4 power connector. The 20-pin power cable will still work in the 
new 24-pin connector. Looking back at Figure 1-3, you can see one long blue PCIe ×16 slot (16 lanes 
for 16-bit transfers on this slot) that can be used by a video card and two short black PCIe ×1 slots (for 
1-bit transfers) that can be used for other expansion cards that fit this type slot.
	
	
The extra 4 pins on the 24-pin P1 connector provide +12 volts, +5 volts, and +3.3 volts pins. 
Motherboards that support PCI Express and have the 24-pin P1 connector are sometimes called 
Enhanced ATX boards. Figure 1-14 shows a 20-pin P1 power cord from the power supply and a 24-pin 
P1 connector on a motherboard. Figure 1-15 shows the pinouts for the 24-pin power cord connector, 
which is color-coded to wires from the power supply. The 20-pin connector is missing the lower four 
pins, which are listed in the photo and diagram.

Identify Ports and Parts
Do the following to identify computer ports and parts that your instructor might have on display:
1.	 Look on the front and back of your computer case and list the type of ports the computer offers.
2.	 For a power supply, list the number and type of power connectors.
3.	 For a motherboard, list the number and type of expansion slots on the board. Does the board have a 20-pin 
or 24-pin P1 connector? What other power connectors are on the board? How many memory slots does the 
board have?
4.	 For expansion cards, examine the ports on the back of the card. Can you tell by the ports the purpose of the 
card? What type of slot does the card use?

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to recognize and know the more important features of the ATX 
and microATX form factors used by power supplies.
Notes For more information about all the form factors discussed in this chapter, check out the form factor website 
sponsored by Intel at www.formfactors.org.
MicroAtx Form Factor
The microATX (MATX) form factor is a major variation of ATX and addresses some technologies that 
have emerged since the original development of ATX. MicroATX reduces the total cost of a system by 
reducing the number of expansion slots on the motherboard, reducing the power supplied to the board, 
and allowing for a smaller case size. A microATX motherboard (see Figure 1-17) will fit into a case that 
follows the ATX 2.1 or higher standard. A microATX power supply uses a 24-pin P1 connector and is not 
likely to have as many extra wires and connectors as those on an ATX power supply.

What’s Inside a Desktop Case
Caution
You can damage a computer component with static electricity if you touch the component when you are 
not grounded. Before you touch a sensitive computer component, you first need to dissipate any static electricity on your 
body. You learn how to do that in the appendix, “Safety Procedures and Environmental Concerns.” For now, to protect a 
working component your instructor has on display, don’t touch; just look.
Examine the Power Supply, Motherboard, and 
Expansion Cards Inside a Desktop Case
If you have access to a desktop computer with the case cover removed, examine its components and 
answer the following questions. As you look, remember to not touch anything inside the case unless 
you are properly grounded.
Hands-On  Project 1-2
A+  
220-901 
1.7, 1.8,

1.	 Identify the power supply, motherboard, and any expansion cards that might be installed on the 
motherboard. Remember: Don’t touch a component unless you are properly grounded. If the case is plugged 
into a power source, don’t touch inside the case even if you are grounded.
2.	 Identify the cooler that is installed on top of the processor. This cooler is likely to have a fan on top and a 
heat sink that you can’t see. The processor is hidden under the cooler.
3.	 Identify the memory modules and memory slots. How many memory slots are there? How many of these slots 
are populated?
4.	 If an expansion card is installed, what type of ports does the card provide at the rear of the case? Find the 
one screw that is used to attach the expansion card to the case.
5.	 Locate the screws that are attaching the motherboard to the case. How many screws are used? Do you see 
screw holes in the motherboard that are not being used? As a general rule of thumb, up to nine screws can be 
used to attach a motherboard to a case.
6.	 How many power cables are coming from the power supply? How many of these cables are connected to the 
motherboard? To other devices inside the computer? Identify each type of power cable the system is using.
7.	 Find the screws or clips that are attaching the power supply to the case. Is the power supply attached using 
screws, clips, or both screws and clips?
Now let’s learn about the drives you might find installed inside a system.
Drives, Their Cables, and Connectors
A computer might have one or more hard drives, an optical drive (CD, DVD, or Blu-ray), tape 
drive, or some other type of drive. A drive receives power by a power cable from the power 
supply, and communicates instructions and data through a cable attached to the motherboard. 
Most hard drives, optical drives, and tape drives today use the serial ATA (SATA) standard.

Notes If you support older desktop computers, you might see some drives using the slower and older PATA (parallel 
ATA) standard, also called the IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) or EIDE (Enhanced IDE) standard, for drive connections. 
PATA used a 40-pin connector on the motherboard and a wide ribbon cable that could accommodate one or two drives on 
the cable. Figure 1-18 shows two PATA ribbon cables, each connecting a drive to the motherboard.

Now that you know about what’s inside a desktop computer case, let’s take a look at laptop computers.
First Look at Laptop Components
A laptop, also called a notebook, is designed for portability (see Figure 1-21a and 1-21b) 
and can be just as powerful as a desktop computer. More than half of personal computers 
purchased today are laptops, and almost 30 percent of personal computers currently in use 
are laptops. Laptops use the same technology as desktops, but with modifications to use less 
power, take up less space, and operate on the move.

Laptops come in several varieties, including 
some with a touch screen that also allows you 
to handwrite on it with a stylus and some with 
a rotating screen or removable screen that allows 
you to use the laptop as a tablet (see Figure 1-22). 
Another variation of a laptop is a netbook 
(Figure 1-21b) that is smaller and less expensive than 
a laptop and has fewer features. An all-in-one 
computer (Figure 1-21c) has the monitor and 
computer case built together and uses components 
that are common to both a laptop and desktop. 
Because all-in-one computers use many laptop components and are serviced in similar ways, we include them in 
this chapter.
A laptop provides ports on its sides, back, or front for connecting peripherals (see Figure 1-23). Ports 
common to laptops as well as desktop systems include USB, FireWire, network, dial-up modem (seldom 
seen on newer laptops), and audio ports (for a microphone, headset, or external speakers). Video ports 
might include one or more VGA, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt (on Apple laptops), or HDMI ports to connect 
to a projector, second monitor, or television. On the side or back of the laptop, you’ll see a lock connector 
that’s used to physically secure the laptop with a cable lock (see Figure 1-24) and a DC jack to receive 
power from the AC adapter. Also, a laptop may have an optical drive, but netbooks usually don’t have 
optical drives.

Notice the two slots in Figure 1-23 used for flash 
memory cards: a MagicGate slot and an SD card slot. 
Each can support several types of flash memory cards 
that you learn about later in the text.
When a laptop is missing a port or slot you need, you 
can usually find a USB dongle to provide the port or slot. 
Here are some options:
	 Connect to a local wired network. Figure 1-25 
shows a USB to RJ-45 dongle. Plug the dongle 
into a USB port and plug a network cable into 
the RJ-45 port the dongle provides to connect the 
laptop to a wired network.
	 Connect to a local wireless network. Figure 1-26 
shows a USB to Wi-Fi dongle, which allows you 
to connect a laptop that doesn’t have wireless 
capability to a wireless network. Wi-Fi (Wireless 
Fidelity) is the common name for standards for a 
local wireless network.

	 Connect to a cellular network. Some laptops have embedded capability to connect to a cellular network. 
Figure 1-27 shows a USB cellular modem that can be used for a laptop that doesn’t have the embedded 
technology. A cellular network consists of geographic areas of coverage called cells, each controlled by a 
tower, called a base station. Cell phones are called that because they use a cellular network.

Bluetooth adapter to connect to a Bluetooth wireless device such as a Bluetooth printer or smart phone. 
Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology to connect two devices in a small personal network.
	 Use an external optical drive. When a laptop or netbook doesn’t have an optical drive, you can use a 
USB optical drive. Plug the USB optical drive into a USB port so that you can use CDs and DVDs with 
the laptop or netbook.

	 Bluetooth,Wi-Fi, or cellular on or off. Some 
laptops use function keys such as Fn with F5 or 
F6 to toggle Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or cellular on or off, 
or a laptop might have a switch for this purpose. 
You can also control these wireless technologies 
using Windows settings or software utilities 
provided by the manufacturer. When you turn off 
all wireless technologies, the computer is said to be 
in airplane mode.
	 Media options. Some laptops provide buttons or 
allow you to use function keys to fast forward, stop, 
pause, or rewind audio or video media playing in 
an optical drive.
	 GPS on or off. If a laptop has a GPS 
(Global Positioning System) receiver to calculate 
its position on the Earth, the laptop might provide 
a button or function key to turn the GPS on or off. 
The Global Positioning System is a system of 24 or 
more satellites orbiting the Earth, and a GPS receiver 
can locate three or more of these satellites at any 
time and from these three locations, calculate its 
own position in a process called trilateration.
Notes If the keyboard fails and you’re not able to immediately exchange it, know that you can plug in an external 
keyboard to a USB port to use in the meantime.
And now onward to ExpressCard slots and docking stations.
Expresscard Slots
Most peripheral devices on today’s laptops use a USB port to connect to the laptop. Before 
USB devices became so popular, a laptop offered ExpressCard slots to connect peripheral 
devices. See Figure 1-31. These slot and card standards were designed and supported by the 
PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) and are sometimes 
called PCMCIA cards. The cards were used by many devices, including modems, network cards for wired 
or wireless networks, sound cards, FireWire (IEEE 1394) controllers, USB controllers, flash memory 
adapters, TV tuners, and hard disks. Most new laptops don’t have these slots, but you still need to know 
how to support them because you’ll see them on older laptops.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know how to install and configure ExpressCard/34 and 
ExpressCard/54 cards and slots.
ExpressCard uses the PCI Express bus standard or the USB 2.0 standard. Two sizes of ExpressCards 
exist: ExpressCard/34 is 34mm wide and ExpressCard/54 is 54mm wide, as shown in Figure 1-32. Notice 
the offset in the ExpressCard/54 card. An ExpressCard/34 card can fit into an ExpressCard/54 slot, but 
not vice versa. An ExpressCard slot is fully hot-pluggable (you can add a card while the system is on), 
hot-swappable (exchange or add a card while the system is on), and supports autoconfiguration. An 
ExpressCard/54 card that provides two eSATA ports for external SATA drives is shown in Figure 1-33.

Windows must provide two services for an ExpressCard: a socket service and a card service. The socket 
service establishes communication between the card and the laptop when the card is first inserted. The card 
service provides the device driver to interface with the card after the socket is created.
The first time you insert an ExpressCard in a laptop, Windows automatically guides you through the 
installation steps in which you can use the drivers provided by the hardware manufacturer or use Windows 
drivers. The next time you insert the card in the laptop, the card is detected and starts without help.
ExpressCards can be hot-swapped (inserted or removed while the system is on), but you must stop one 
card before inserting another. To stop the card, use the Safely Remove Hardware icon in the notification 
area of the Windows taskbar.

After you have stopped the card, push on the card, which causes it to pop out of the slot. Some 
ExpressCard slots have an eject button to pop out the card. Then you can remove the card.
Docking Stations
Some notebooks have a connector, called a docking port, on the bottom or sides of the laptop 
(see Figure 1-34) to connect to a docking station. A docking station provides ports to allow 
a laptop to easily connect to a full-sized monitor, keyboard, AC power adapter, and other 
peripheral devices. See Figure 1-35. Laptop manufacturers usually offer a docking station as 
an additional option.

To use a docking station, plug all the peripherals into the docking station. Then connect your laptop to 
the station. No software needs installing. When you need to travel with your laptop, rather than having to 
unplug all the peripherals, all you have to do is disconnect the laptop from the docking station.
Caution
Inserting an ExpressCard while the laptop is shutting down or booting up can cause damage to the 
card and/or to the laptop. Also, a card might give problems when you insert or remove the card while the laptop is 
in hibernation or sleep mode.

	 Wireless card. The wireless card is installed to the left of the hard drive in Figure 1-36. You can see two 
wires leading to the wireless antennas, which are installed in the laptop lid.
	 System board. Look for the blue system board (in laptop documentation, the motherboard is usually 
called the system board) under the heat sink, memory, and fan. If you look carefully, you can see 
microchips and other components on the board.
	 Optical drive. The optical drive is not visible in the photo. To replace it, you first remove a single screw 
holding the drive in place and then slide the drive to the left and out of the case. This one screw is 
labeled in Figure 1-36.
Other hardware components you are likely to find in a laptop case include a small speaker and smart 
card reader and writer. In the chapter, “Working Inside Desktop Computers and Laptops,” you learn how 
to disassemble and reassemble a laptop.
What’s Inside an All-in-One Computer
An all-in-one computer uses a mix of components sized for a desktop computer and a laptop. 
Let’s get the general idea of what’s inside the case of an all-in-one by looking at the inside 
of the Lenovo ThinkCentre all-in-one shown earlier in Figure 1-21. Figure 1-38 shows the 
computer with the case cover removed. Notice in the figure the hard drive is a 3.5-inch drive 
appropriate for a desktop system, and the memory modules are SO-DIMMs appropriate for a laptop. So 
goes the hybrid nature of an all-in-one. The fan and heat sink look more like that of a laptop computer, 
but the processor socket on the motherboard is a desktop processor socket, another hybrid design.

First Look at Laptop Components
To work inside an all-in-one, you’ll need the service manual to know how to open the case and replace 
internal components. Also, for some components, such as the motherboard and power supply, you’ll need to 
buy the replacement component from the all-in-one manufacturer because these components are likely to be 
proprietary as with many laptop components. For specific directions about replacing parts in an all-in-one, 
see the service manual.
Maintaining Laptops and Mobile Devices
Laptops and mobile devices tend to not last as long as desktop computers because they are 
portable and, therefore, subject to more wear and tear. A device’s user manual gives specific 
instructions on how to care for the device. Those instructions follow these general guidelines:
  LCD panels on devices are fragile and can be damaged fairly easily. Take precautions 
against damaging a laptop or other device’s LCD panel. Don’t touch it with sharp objects like 
ballpoint pens.
	 Don’t pick up or hold a laptop by the lid. Pick it up and hold it by the bottom. Keep the lid closed when 
the laptop is not in use.
	 Only use battery packs and AC adapters recommended by the laptop manufacturer. Keep the battery pack 
away from moisture or heat, and don’t attempt to take the pack apart. When it no longer works, dispose 
of it correctly. For laptops, you might consider buying an extra battery pack to use when the first one  
discharges. You can also buy battery chargers so that you can charge one while the other is in use.
	 Don’t tightly pack a laptop or tablet in a suitcase because the LCD panel might get damaged. Use a 
good-quality carrying case and make a habit of always transporting the laptop in the carrying case. 
Don’t place heavy objects on top of the laptop case.
	 Don’t move the laptop while the hard drive is being accessed (when the drive indicator light is on). Wait 
until the light goes off.
Several components are easy to exchange in this all-in-one without further disassembly. For example, 
the Mini PCIe card for wireless connectivity, shown in Figure 1-39, is easy to get to, as are the SO-DIMMs 
you can partly see on the right side of the photo.

	 Don’t put the laptop close to an appliance such as a TV, large audio speakers, or refrigerator 
that generates a strong magnetic field, and don’t place your cell phone on a laptop while the phone  
is in use.
	 Always use passwords to protect access to your laptop or mobile device so you are better protected 
when connected to a public network or the device is stolen or used by an unauthorized person.
	 Keep your laptop or device at room temperature. For example, never leave it in a car overnight when it 
is cold, and don’t leave it in a car during the day when it’s hot. Don’t expose your laptop or device to 
direct sunlight for an extended time.
	 Don’t leave the laptop or device in a dusty or smoke-filled area. Don’t use it in a wet area such as near a 
swimming pool or in the bathtub. Don’t use it at the beach where sand can get in it.
	 Don’t power it up and down unnecessarily.
	 Protect the laptop from overheating by not running it when it’s still inside the case, resting on a 
pillow, or partially covered with a blanket or anything else that would prevent proper air circulation 
around it.
	 If a laptop has just come indoors from the cold, don’t turn it on until it reaches room temperature. In 
some cases, condensation can cause problems. Some manufacturers recommend that when you receive a 
new laptop shipped to you during the winter, you should leave it in its shipping carton for several hours 
before you open the carton to prevent subjecting the laptop to a temperature shock.
	 Protect a laptop against static electricity. If you have just come in from the cold on a low-humidity day 
when there is the possibility that you are carrying static electricity, don’t touch the laptop until you have 
grounded yourself.
	 Before placing a laptop in a carrying case for travel, remove any CDs, DVDs, or USB flash drives, and 
put them in protective covers. Verify that the system is powered down and not in sleep mode, which will 
drain the battery.
	 If a laptop gets wet, you can partially disassemble it to allow internal components to dry. Give the 
laptop several days to dry before attempting to turn it on. Don’t use heat to speed up the drying time.
	 Keep current backups of important data on a laptop or device in case it fails or is stolen.
A well-used laptop, especially one that is used in dusty or dirty areas, needs cleaning occasionally. Here 
are some cleaning tips:
1. Clean the LCD panel with a soft dry cloth. If the panel is very dirty, you can use monitor wipes to clean 
it or dampen the cloth with water. Some manufacturers recommend using a mixture of isopropyl alcohol 
and water to clean an LCD panel. Be sure the LCD panel is dry before you close the lid.
2. Use a can of compressed air meant to be used on computer equipment to blow dust and small particles 
out of the keyboard, trackball, and touch pad. Turn the laptop at an angle and direct the air into the 
sides of the keyboard. Then use a soft, damp cloth to clean the key caps and touch pad.
3. Use compressed air to blow out all air vents on the laptop to make sure they are clean and  
unobstructed.
4. If keys are sticking, remove the keyboard so you can better spray under the keys with compressed 
air. If you can remove the key cap, remove it and clean the key contact area with contact cleaner. 
One example of a contact cleaner you can use for this purpose is Stabilant 22 (www.stabilant.com). 
Reinstall the keyboard and test it. If the key still sticks, replace the keyboard.
5. Remove the battery and clean the battery connections with a contact cleaner.

First Look at Mobile Device Hardware
Now that you know about some of the parts and components in desktops, laptops, and all-in-ones, let’s 
turn our attention to the components found in a few other mobile devices, including tablets, smart phones, 
phablets, and wearable technology devices.
Observe Laptop Features
Examine a laptop, its documentation, and the manufacturer’s website, and then answer these questions:
1.	 What ports are on the laptop?
2.	 Does the laptop have an ExpressCard slot? If so, which type of ExpressCard slot does the laptop have?
3.	 What type of memory slots does the laptop have?
4.	 List the purpose of each function key on the keyboard.
5.	 List the purpose of each button on the top or bottom of the keyboard.
6.	 What is the cost of a new battery pack?

Here’s a list of the mobile devices that you, as an IT support technician, might be called on to 
support:
  Smart phone. A smart phone is primarily a cell phone that also includes abilities to send 
text messages with photos, videos, or other multimedia content attached; surf the web; manage 
email; play games; take photos and videos; and download and use small apps. Most smart phones use 
touch screens for input (see Figure 1-40) and a few have a physical keyboard and a touch screen. Some 
smart phones allow for voice input.

Figure 1-40  Most smart phones don’t have a keyboard and use 
a touch screen for input
	 Tablets and phablets. A tablet is a computing 
device with a touch screen that is larger than 
a smart phone and has functions similar to a 
smart phone. Most tablets can connect to Wi-Fi 
networks and use Bluetooth or NFC (Near 
Field Communication) to wirelessly connect to 
nearby devices. Some tablets have the ability to 
use a cellular network for data transmissions 
and phone calls. Installed apps, such as Skype, 
can make voice phone calls, send text, and 
make video calls. When you can use your tablet 
to make a phone call, the distinction between a 
smart phone and a tablet is almost nonexistent, 
except for size.
	
	
A phablet bridges this size exception. A 
phablet (pronounced “fab-let”) has the same 
capabilities of a smart phone or tablet, but is 
smaller than a tablet and larger than a smart 
phone.
	 E-readers. An e-reader is a mobile device that 
holds digital versions of books, newspapers,

magazines, and other printed documents, which are usually downloaded to the device from the web. An 
e-reader can connect to the Internet using a Wi-Fi wireless connection or a wired connection to a computer 
that is connected to the Internet. In addition, content can be stored on a flash memory card, which is 
inserted in the e-reader.
	 Smart cameras. A smart camera is a digital camera that has embedded computing power to make 
decisions about the content of the photos or videos it records, including transmitting alerts over a wired 
or wireless network when it records certain content. Smart cameras, sometimes called vision sensors, 
can be used to initiate alerts for surveillance of a protected area or to monitor manufacturer automated 
assembly lines for potential problems.
	 Wearable technology devices. Wearable technology devices, including smart watches (see Figure 1-41), 
wristbands, arm bands, eyeglasses, headsets, and clothing, can be used as computing devices to make 
phone calls, send text messages, transmit data, 
and check email; wearable technology fitness 
monitors can measure heart rate, count pool 
laps or miles jogged or biked, and a host of 
other activities. These devices can sync up with a 
computer for power and communication, similar 
to how other mobile devices work. Many people 
believe smart watches will eventually replace 
smart phones as the personal communication 
device of choice.

  Wi-Fi local wireless network and cellular network. Most mobile devices have Wi-Fi 
capability and can connect to a Wi-Fi local wireless network. In addition, smart phones 
and some laptops, tablets, phablets, and wearable mobile devices can connect to a cellular 
network. To connect to a cellular network, the device must have cellular capability and a subscription 
to the cellular network carrier, for example, AT&T or Verizon. Two types of technologies are used to 
connect to cellular networks: GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) and CDMA (Code 
Division Multiple Access). With GSM networks, information about your subscription is kept on a small 
SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card inserted in the device. Figure 1-42 shows the slot on the side of 
an Apple iPad where you can insert a SIM card so that the iPad can connect to the cellular network.

	 Bluetooth and Infrared. Mobile devices might have the capability to connect to other nearby wireless 
devices using a Bluetooth, IR, or NFC connection. Figure 1-43 shows an iPad connected to a keyboard 
using Bluetooth. Infrared (IR) is a wireless connection that requires an unobstructed “line of sight” 
between transmitter and receiver. Smart phones and other mobile devices sometimes offer an IR interface 
that can be used with an app to control a television in place of its remote control.
	 NFC. Near Field Communication (NFC) is a wireless technology that establishes a communication link 
between two NFC devices that are within 4 inches of each other. For example, when you tap your smart 
phone with that of your friend, the two phones can use NFC to exchange contact information. NFC can 
also be used to read an NFC tag, which is a small microchip that can be embedded in just about anything, 
including a key chain tag, printed flyer, or billboard (see Figure 1-44). The NFC tag dispenses information to 
any NFC-enabled smart phone or other device that comes within 4 inches of the tag.
Figure 1-43  An iPad and a wireless keyboard 
can connect using Bluetooth
Figure 1-44  These programmable NFC tags have sticky backs for 
attaching to a flat surface like a wall, desk, or car dashboard
	 Wired connection. Smart phones, tablets, phablets, and wearable devices can make a wired connection 
to a computer. This connection can be used to charge the device, download software updates, upload 
data to the computer, back up data, and restore software or data. The device’s port used for power and 
communication may be a type of USB port or a proprietary vendor-specific port. Some USB connectors 
used for this purpose include microUSB (see Figure 1-45a) or the smaller miniUSB (see Figure 1-45b). 
Newer Apple iPhones, iPods, and iPads use the proprietary Lightning port and connector for power and 
communication (see Figure 1-46).

	 Tethering and mobile hotspots. When a mobile device is connected to the Internet by way of its 
cellular network, you can allow other computers and devices to use this same connection. For example, 
in Figure 1-47, the smart phone is tethered by USB to a laptop so that the laptop can use the cellular

computer end and a Lightning connector for an iPhone or iPad
Figure 1-47  Tether your smart phone to your laptop using a USB cable
network to connect to the Internet. If the smart phone has Wi-Fi 
capabilities, the smart phone can create its own Wi-Fi hotspot for 
other computers and devices to connect to wirelessly. An app on the 
smart phone controls these connections, and your carrier subscription 
must allow for tethering and for providing mobile hotspots.
	   A mobile device can use an accelerometer and GPS receiver to sense 
its position. Here are brief details about each:
  Accelerometer. A gyroscope is a device that contains a disc that is 
free to move and can respond to gravity as the device is moved 
(see Figure 1-48). Three axes in the device sense how the disc moves 
and, therefore, can tell the direction of motion. An accelerometer 
is a type of gyroscope used in mobile devices to sense the physical 
position of the device. The accelerometer is used by the OS and apps 
to adjust the screen orientation from portrait to landscape as the 
user rotates the device. Apps such as a Compass, Carpenter’s Leveler, 
and some game apps use the accelerometer to sense how the user 
is moving the device.

Figure 1-49  An Android device might provide a memory card slot to allow for extra storage
  GPS receiver. Mobile devices might contain a GPS receiver to determine its position by using the GPS 
satellite data or data from the position of nearby cellular towers. A cellular-enabled device with a GPS 
receiver is likely to use both types of data to find its position. A mobile device routinely reports its 
position to the owner of its operating system. For example, a device may report its position to Apple 
(for devices that use the iOS operating system by Apple, Inc.), Google (for devices that use the Android 
operating system by Google), or Microsoft (for devices that use the Windows Phone operating system 
by Microsoft) at least twice a day, and usually more often, which makes it possible for these companies 
to track your device’s whereabouts, which is called geotracking. Law enforcement agencies sometimes 
use this data to reconstruct a person’s travels.
Storage Devices
Mobile devices store their apps and data on a solid-state device (SSD), a type of flash memory. 
In addition, a device might have an external slot where you can plug in a smart card such as 
an SD card or MicroSD card to provide extra storage. Figure 1-49 shows a memory card slot 
on an Android tablet, and Figure 1-50 shows a MicroSD card. The iPhone, iPad, and iPod 
don’t have these external slots for a smart card.
A+  
220-901 
3.1, 3.3, 
3.4, 3.5
An Android or Microsoft device might also have a USB port that 
you can use to plug in a USB flash drive to provide extra storage or 
transfer files and folders to other devices. Apple mobile devices don’t 
have USB ports.
Mobile Device Accessories
You can buy all kinds of accessories for mobile devices, such 
as wireless keyboards, speakers, earbuds, headsets, game

Field-Replaceable Parts for Mobile Devices
For the purposes of IT support technicians supporting mobile devices, know there are few 
field-replaceable units (FRU) in mobile devices because the cost of replacement, including parts 
and labor, generally exceeds the value of fixing rather than replacing the device. Although it 
is possible to replace the screens in some mobile devices, a support technician is not generally 
expected to take the time to do so. SIM cards and batteries can be replaced, and accessories such as a 
battery charger or earbuds can be attached.

Replacing the battery in a smart phone or tablet is a handy skill for an IT support technician to have. If you have  
a smart phone or tablet or know a friend who has one, find out the brand and model of the device. Search the  
www.ifixit.com website, which is a wiki-based site with tons of guides for tearing down, repairing, and reassembling 
all kinds of products, including smart phones, tablets, and laptops. Does the site offer a guide for replacing the  
battery in your device or your friend’s device? If so, list the high-level steps for the repair. What tools would you 
need to actually make the repair?
Hands-On  Project 1-5
Tools Used by a Computer Hardware Technician
Every IT support technician who plans to repair desktop or laptop computers or mobile 
devices needs a handy toolbox with a few essential tools. Several hardware and software tools 
can help you maintain a computer and diagnose and repair computer problems. The tools you 
choose depend on the amount of money you can spend and the level of hardware support you 
expect to provide.
Essential tools for computer hardware troubleshooting are listed here, and several of them are shown in 
Figure 1-52. You can purchase some of these tools in a computer toolkit, although most toolkits contain 
items you really can do without.

Tools Used by a Computer Hardware Technician
One of the more important tools is an ESD strap (also called a ground bracelet), which protects against 
ESD when working inside the computer case. Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is another name for static 
electricity, which can damage chips and destroy motherboards, even though it might not be felt or seen 
with the naked eye. Use the strap to connect or ground your hand to the case, as shown in Figure 1-53, 
and any static electricity between you and the case is dissipated.

First Look at Computer Parts and Tools
Here is a list of essential tools:
	 An ESD strap (also called a ground bracelet)
	 Flathead screwdriver
	 Phillips-head or crosshead screwdriver
	 Torx screwdriver set, particularly size T15
	 Tweezers, preferably insulated ones, for picking pieces of paper out of printers or dropped screws out of 
tight places
	 Extractor, a spring-loaded device that looks like a hypodermic needle (When you push down on the top, 
three wire prongs come out that can be used to pick up a screw that has fallen into a place where hands 
and fingers can’t reach.)
	 Software, including recovery CD or DVD for any OS you might work on (you might need several, 
depending on the OSs you support), antivirus software on bootable CDs or USB flash drives, and 
diagnostic software
The following tools might not be essential, but they are very convenient:
	 Cans of compressed air (see Figure 1-54), small portable compressor, or antistatic vacuum cleaner to 
clean dust from inside a computer case
	 Cleaning solutions and pads such as contact cleaner, monitor wipes, and cleaning solutions for CDs, 
DVDs, tapes, and drives
Figure 1-54  A can of compressed air is handy to blow dust from a computer case
	 Multimeter to check cables and the power supply output

Tools Used by a Computer Hardware Technician
	 Newer motherboards use Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware that is more robust 
and secure than BIOS. Just as with BIOS, UEFI is responsible for managing essential devices before the 
OS is launched, starting the computer, and managing motherboard settings. UEFI can also assure that 
the boot is secure and no rogue operating system hijacks the system.
	 Chip extractor to remove chips (To pry up the chip, a simple screwdriver is usually more effective, 
however.)
	 Pen and paper for taking notes
	 POST diagnostic cards
Keep your tools in a toolbox designated for hardware troubleshooting. If you put discs and hardware 
tools in the same box, be sure to keep the discs inside a hard plastic case to protect them from scratches 
and dents. In addition, make sure the diagnostic and utility software you use is recommended for the 
hardware and software you are troubleshooting.
Now let’s turn our attention to the details of several IT support technician tools, including diagnostic 
cards, power supply testers, multimeters, and loopback plugs. 
Post Diagnostic Cards
Although not an essential tool, a POST diagnostic card, also called a POST card, or motherboard 
test card, can be of great help to discover and report computer errors and conflicts that occur 
when you first turn on a computer and before the operating system (such as Windows 8) is 
launched. To understand what a POST card does, you need to know about the firmware, which is 
programs and data stored on the motherboard. Two types of firmware may be used on motherboards:
	 The older BIOS (basic input/output system) contains system BIOS to manage essential devices (such 
as the keyboard, mouse, hard drive, and monitor) before the OS is launched, startup BIOS to start the 
computer, and BIOS setup to change the motherboard configuration or settings. Figure 1-55 shows an 
embedded firmware chip on a motherboard that contains the BIOS programs.

Notes It’s important to know how to stay safe when working inside computers. Before opening a computer case and 
using the tools described in this section, be sure to read the appendix, “Safety Procedures and Environmental Concerns.”  
As you work inside a computer, follow all the safety guidelines discussed in this appendix.

First Look at Computer Parts and Tools
So now back to the usefulness of a POST card. The POST (power-on self test) is a series of tests performed 
by the startup UEFI/BIOS when you first turn on a computer. These tests determine if startup UEFI/BIOS 
can communicate correctly with essential hardware components required for a successful boot. If you have 
a problem that prevents the computer from booting that you suspect is related to hardware, you can install 
the POST card in an expansion slot on the motherboard. For laptops, some cards install in a USB port. Then 
attempt to boot. The card monitors the boot process and reports errors, usually as coded numbers on a small 
LED panel on the card. You then look up the number online or in the documentation that accompanies the 
card to get more information about the error and its source. Figure 1-56 shows a POST diagnostic card, the 
Post Code Master card by Microsystems Developments, Inc. (www.postcodemaster.com).
Figure 1-56  Post Code Master diagnostic card by Microsystems Developments, Inc., installs in a PCI slot
Before purchasing these or any other diagnostic tools or software, read the documentation about what 
they can and cannot do, and read some online product reviews. Try using Google.com and searching on 
“computer diagnostic card reviews.”
Notes Some Dell computers have lights on the case that blink in patterns to indicate a problem early in the boot 
before the OS loads. These blinking lights give information similar to that given by POST cards.
Power Supply Tester
A power supply tester is used to measure the output of each connector coming from the power 
supply. You can test the power supply when it is outside or inside the case. As you saw earlier 
in Figure 1-8, the power supply provides several cables and connectors that power various 
components inside the computer case. A power supply tester has plugs for each type of cable. 
Connect a power cable to the tester, plug up the power supply, and turn on the tester. An LCD panel 
reports the output of each lead (see Figure 1-57).

Multimeter
A multimeter (see Figure 1-58) is a more general-purpose tool that can measure several 
characteristics of electricity in a variety of devices. Some multimeters can measure voltage, 
current, resistance, or continuity. (Continuity determines that two ends of a cable or fuse are 
connected without interruption.) When set to measure voltage, you can use it to measure 
output of each pin on a power supply connector. Set to measure continuity, a multimeter is useful to test 
fuses, to determine if a cable is good, or to match pins on one end of a cable to pins on the other end.

>> Chapter Summary
What’s Inside a Desktop Case
	Video ports a computer might have include the VGA, S-Video, DVI, DisplayPort, and HDMI ports. 
Other ports include RJ-45, audio, S/PDIF, USB, FireWire, eSATA, PS/2, serial, parallel, and RJ-11 ports. 
A Thunderbolt port can transmit video, data, and power.
	Internal computer components include the motherboard, processor, expansion cards, DIMM memory 
modules, hard drive, optical drive, tape drive, and power supply.
	Form factors used by cases, power supplies, and motherboards are the ATX and microATX form 
factors. The form factor determines how the case, power supply, and motherboard fit together and the 
cable connectors and other standards used by each.
	Power connectors used by the ATX and microATX form factors include the 20-pin P1, 24-pin P1, 4-pin 
and 8-pin CPU auxiliary motherboard, 4-pin Molex, 15-pin SATA, 4-pin Berg, and 6/8-pin PCIe connectors.
	The two main types of expansion slots in a desktop computer are PCI and PCI Express (PCIe).
	Most hard drives, optical drives, and tape drives today use the serial ATA (SATA) standards for the drive 
to interface with the motherboard and power supply.
First Look at Laptop Components
	Laptop computers use function keys to control display, volume, touch pad, media options, GPS, airplane 
mode, and other features of the laptop. A laptop docking station can make it easy to disconnect 
peripheral devices.
	A laptop may have an ExpressCard/34 or ExpressCard/54 slot for expansion. You can also use the USB 
ports for expansion, for example, to add a USB to RJ-45 dongle, USB to Wi-Fi dongle, Bluetooth 
capability, or a USB optical drive.
Loopback Plugs
A loopback plug is used to test a port in a computer or other device to make sure the port is working and 
might also test the throughput or speed of the port. Figure 1-59 shows a loopback plug testing a network 
port on a laptop. You know both the port and the network cable are good because the lights on either side 
of the port are lit. You can also buy a USB loopback plug to test USB ports.
Now that you know about computer parts and their connections and the tools you need, you’re ready to 
learn how to work inside a desktop or laptop case.

wireless card, screen, DC jack, battery pack, touch pad, speaker, system board, CPU, heat sink, and fan.
	An all-in-one computer uses a combination of components designed for desktop computers and laptops.
First Look at Mobile Device Hardware
	Mobile devices an IT support technician may be called on to service include smart phones, tablets, 
phablets, e-readers, smart cameras, GPS devices, and wearable technology devices such as smart watches,  
fitness monitors, glasses, and headsets.
	A mobile device might make a connection to the outside world using a cellular network, Wi-Fi network, 
Bluetooth, IR, NFC, tethering, creating its own hotspot, or wired connection. A wired connection may 
use a microUSB, miniUSB, or proprietary port, such as the Lightning port by Apple.
	A mobile device most likely will have an accelerometer to sense how the user is moving the device and a 
GPS receiver to sense the device’s location and for geotracking.
Tools Used by a Computer Hardware Technician
	Common tools for a computer hardware technician include an ESD strap, screwdrivers, tweezers, 
flashlight, compressed air, and cleaning solutions and pads.
	Special tools a hardware technician might need include a POST diagnostic card, power supply tester, 
multimeter, and loopback plugs.

aking apart and servicing a computer are tasks that every A+ certified 
technician needs to know how to do. As part of your preparation 
to become A+ certified, try to find old desktop and laptop computers 
you can take apart. If you can locate the service manual for a laptop, 
you should be able to take it apart, repair it (assuming the parts are still 
available and don’t cost more than the computer is worth), and get it up 
and running again. Have fun with this chapter and enjoy tinkering with 
these computers!

Working Inside Desktop Computers and Laptops
1.  Back up important data. If you are starting with a working computer, make sure important 
data is first backed up. Copy the data to an external storage device such as a flash drive or 
external hard drive. If something goes wrong while you’re working inside the computer, at 
least your data will be safe.
How to Work Inside a Desktop Computer Case
In this part of the chapter, you learn how to take apart a desktop computer and put it back 
together. This skill is needed in this and other chapters as you learn to add or replace computer 
parts inside the case and perhaps even build a system from scratch. As you read the following 
steps, you might want to perform the Hands-On Projects, which allow you to follow along by 
taking a computer apart. As you do so, be sure to follow all the safety precautions found in Appendix A 
“Safety Procedures and Environmental Concerns.” In the steps that follow, each major computer component 
is identified and described. You learn much more about each component later in the text. Take your time—
don’t rush—as you take apart a computer for the first time. It can be a great learning experience or an 
expensive disaster! As you work, pay attention to the details, and work with care.
Step 1: Plan and Organize Your Work
When you first begin to learn how to work inside a computer case, make it a point to practice 
good organization skills. If you keep your notes, tools, screws, and computer parts well 
organized, your work goes smoother and is more fun. Here are some tips to keep in mind:
	Make notes as you work so that you can backtrack later if necessary. (When you’re first learning to take 
a computer apart, it’s really easy to forget where everything fits when it’s time to put it back together. 
Also, in troubleshooting, you want to avoid repeating or overlooking things to try.)
	Remove loose jewelry that might get caught in cables and components as you work.
	To stay organized and not lose small parts, keep screws and spacers orderly and in one place, such as a 
cup or tray.
	Don’t stack boards on top of each other: You could accidentally dislodge a chip this way. When you 
remove a circuit board or drive from a computer, carefully lay it on an antistatic mat or in an antistatic 
bag in a place where it won’t get bumped.
	When handling motherboards, cards, or drives, don’t touch the chips on the device. Hold expansion 
cards by the edges. Don’t touch any soldered components on a card, and don’t touch the edge connectors 
unless it’s absolutely necessary. All this helps prevent damage from static electricity. Also, your finger-
prints on the edge connectors can cause later corrosion.
	To protect a microchip, don’t touch it with a magnetized screwdriver.
	Never ever touch the inside of a computer that is turned on. The one exception to this rule is when 
you’re using a multimeter to measure voltage output.
	Consider the monitor and the power supply to be “black boxes.” Never remove the cover or put your hands 
inside this equipment unless you know about the hazards of charged capacitors and have been trained to deal 
with them. The power supply and monitor contain enough power to kill you, even when they are unplugged.
	As you work, remember to watch out for sharp edges on computer cases that can cut you.
	In a classroom environment, after you have reassembled everything, have your instructor check your 
work before you put the cover back on and power up.
Now that you’ve prepared your work area and tools, put on your ESD strap and let’s get started with 
opening the computer case.
Step 2: Open the Computer Case and Examine the System

2. Power down the system and unplug it. Remove discs from the optical drive. Then power down the system 
and unplug the power, monitor, mouse, and keyboard cables, and any other peripherals or cables attached and 
move them out of your way.
3. Press and hold down the power button for a moment. After you unplug the computer, press the power 
button for about three seconds to completely drain the power supply (see Figure 2-1). Sometimes when 
you do so, you’ll hear the fans quickly start and go off as residual power is drained. Only then is it safe 
to work inside the case.
4. Have a plastic bag or cup handy to hold screws. When you reassemble the computer, you will need to 
insert the same screws in the same holes. This is especially important with the hard drive because screws 
that are too long can puncture the hard drive housing so be careful to label those screws clearly.
5. Open the case cover. Sometimes I think figuring out how to open a computer case is the most difficult 
part of disassembling. If you need help figuring it out, check the user manual or website of the case 
manufacturer. To remove the computer case cover, do the following:
	 Some cases require you to start by laying the case on its side and removing the faceplate on the front 
of the case first. Other cases require you to remove a side panel first, and really older cases require 
you to first remove the entire sides and top as a single unit. Study your case for the correct approach.
	 Most cases have panels on each side of the case that can be removed. It is usually necessary to only 
remove the one panel to expose the top of the motherboard. To know which panel to remove, look at 
where the ports are on the rear of the case. For example, in Figure 2-2, the ports on this motherboard 
are on the left side of the case, indicating the bottom of the motherboard is on the left. Therefore, you 
will want to remove the right panel to expose the top of this motherboard. Lay the case down to its 
Figure 2-1  Press the power button after the computer is unplugged
Caution
When you power down a computer and even turn off the power switch on the rear of the computer case, 
know that residual power is still on. Some motherboards even have a small light inside the case to remind you of this 
fact and to warn you that power is still getting to the system. Therefore, be sure to always unplug the power cord before 
opening a case.

left so that the ports and the motherboard are sitting on the bottom. Later, depending on how drives 
are installed, it might become necessary to remove the bottom panel in order to remove the screws 
that hold the drives in place.

Figure 2-2  Decide which side panel to remove
	 Locate the screws or clips that hold the side panel in place. Be careful not to unscrew any screws 
besides these. The other screws probably are holding the power supply, fan, and other components 
in place (see Figure 2-3). Place the screws in the cup or bag used for that purpose. Some cases use 
clips on a side panel in addition to or instead of screws (see Figure 2-4).

	 Some cases require you to pop the front panel off the case before removing the side panels. Look for 
a lever on the bottom of the panel and hinges at the top. Squeeze the lever to release the front panel 
and lift it off the case (see Figure 2-6).

6. Clip your ESD strap to the side of the computer case. To dissipate any charge between you and the  
computer, put on your ESD strap if you have not already done so. Then clip the alligator clip on  
the strap cable to the side of the computer case (see Figure 2-8).
	 Then remove a single screw (see Figure 2-7) and slide the side panel to the front and then off the case.

Step 3: Remove Expansion Cards
If you plan to remove several components, draw a diagram of all cable connections to the 
motherboard, expansion cards, and drives. You might need this cable connection diagram 
to help you reassemble. Note where each cable begins and ends, and pay particular attention to 
the small wires and connectors that connect the lights, switches, and ports on the front of 
the case to the motherboard front panel connectors. It’s important to be careful about diagramming these 
because it is so easy to connect them in the wrong position later when you reassemble. If you want, use

Open a Computer Case
Using a desktop or tower computer, identify all the ports on the front or rear of the case. If you need help,  
see Table 1 in the chapter, “First Look at Computer Parts and Tools.” Look at the rear of the case. On which side is 
the motherboard? Examine the case and determine how to open it. Shut down the system, and unplug the power 
cable. Disconnect all other cables. Press the power button on the front of the case to discharge residual power. 
Carefully open the case. Remember to not touch anything inside the case unless you are using an ESD strap  
or antistatic gloves to protect components against ESD.
Draw a diagram of the inside of the case and label all drives, the motherboard, the cooler, DIMM memory modules, 
the power supply, and any expansion cards installed. Leave the case open so you’ll be ready for Hands-On  
Project 2-2 coming up later.
Hands-On  Project 2-1
After you open a computer case, the main components you see inside are the power supply, motherboard, 
and drives installed in drive bays. You also see a lot of cables and wires connecting various components. 
These cables are power cables from the power supply to various components, or cables carrying data 
and instructions between components. The best way to know the purpose of a cable is to follow the 
cable from its source to its destination.

Computer systems vary in so many ways, it’s impossible to list the exact order to disassemble one. Most 
likely, however, you need to remove the expansion cards first. Do the following to remove the expansion cards:
1. Remove any wire or cable connected to the card.
2. Remove the screw holding the card to the case (see Figure 2-10).
a felt-tip marker to make a mark across components, to indicate a cable connection, board placement, 
motherboard orientation, speaker connection, brackets, and so on, so that you can simply line up the marks 
when you reassemble. This method, however, probably won’t work for the front case wires because they are so 
small. For these, consider writing down the color of the wires and their position on the pins or taking a photo 
of the wires in their positions with a digital camera (see Figure 2-9).
Figure 2-10  Remove the screw holding an expansion card to the case
Notes A connector on a motherboard that consists of pins that stick up from the board is called a header. For example, 
the group of pins shown in Figure 2-9 is called the front panel header.

Figure 2-11  Hold the retention mechanism back as you remove a video card from its 
expansion slot
Notes Cards installed in PCI Express 3 16 slots use a latch that helps to hold the card securely in the slot. To remove 
these cards, use one finger to hold the latch back from the slot, as shown in Figure 2-11, as you pull the card up and out 
of the slot.
Identify Connectors Used on an Installed 
Motherboard
If necessary, remove the case cover to your desktop computer. Next, remove the expansion cards from your system. 
With the expansion cards out of the way, you can more clearly see the power cables and other cables and cords 
connected to the motherboard. Diagrams and notes are extremely useful when disassembling and reassembling 
a system. To practice this skill, draw a large rectangle that represents the motherboard. On the rectangle, label 
every header or connector that is used on the board. Include on the label the type of cable that is used and 
where the other end of the cable connects.
Hands-On  Project 2-2
3. Grasp the card with both hands and remove it by lifting straight up. If you have trouble  
removing it from the expansion slot, you can very slightly rock the card from end to end  
(not side to side). Rocking the card from side to side might spread the slot opening and weaken  
the connection.
4. As you remove the card, don’t put your fingers on the edge connectors or touch a chip,  
and don’t stack the cards on top of one another. Lay each card aside on a flat surface, preferably  
in an antistatic bag.

4. Disconnect any other cables or wires connected to the motherboard. A case fan might be getting power 
by a small wire connected to the motherboard. In addition, USB ports on the front of the computer case 
might be connected by a cable to the motherboard.
5. You’re now ready to remove the screws that hold the motherboard to the case. A motherboard is 
installed so that the bottom of the board does not touch the case. If the fine traces or lines on the 
bottom of the board were to touch the case, a short would result when the system is running. To keep 
the board from touching the case, screw holes are elevated, or you’ll see spacers, also called standoffs, 
which are round plastic or metal pegs that separate the board from the case. Carefully pop off these 
spacers and/or remove the screws (up to nine) that hold the board to the case (see Figure 2-13) and then 
remove the board. Set it aside in a safe place. Figure 2-14 shows a motherboard sitting to the side of 
these spacers. One spacer is in place and the other is lying beside its case holes. Also notice in the photo 
the two holes in the motherboard where screws are used to connect the board to the spacers.
Step 4: Remove the Motherboard, Power Supply, and Drives
Depending on the system, you might need to remove the motherboard next or remove the 
drives next. My choice is to first remove the motherboard. It and the processor are the most 
expensive and easily damaged parts in the system. I like to get them out of harm’s way before 
working with the drives. However, in some cases, you must remove the drives or the power 
supply before you can get to the motherboard. Study your situation and decide which to do first. To 
remove the motherboard, do the following:
1. Unplug the power supply lines to the motherboard.
2. Unplug SATA cables connected to the motherboard.
3. The next step is to disconnect wires leading from the front or top of the computer case to the 
motherboard, which are called the front panel connectors. If you don’t have the motherboard 
manual handy, be very careful to diagram how these wires connect because they are rarely labeled 
well on a motherboard. Make a careful diagram and then disconnect the wires. Figure 2-12 shows 
five leads and the pins on the motherboard front panel header that receive these leads. The pins are 
color-coded and cryptically labeled on the board.

7. To remove the power supply from the case, look for screws that attach the power supply to the 
computer case, as shown in Figure 2-16. Be careful not to remove any screws that hold the power 
supply housing together. You do not want to take the housing apart. After you have removed the screws, 
the power supply still might not be free. Sometimes, it is attached to the case on the underside by 
recessed slots. Turn the case over and look on the bottom for these slots. If they are present, determine 
in which direction you need to slide the power supply to free it from the case.
Caution
Some processors have heavy cooling assemblies installed on top of them. For these systems, it is best to 
remove the cooler before you take the motherboard out of the case because the motherboard is not designed to support 
this heavy cooler when the motherboard is not securely seated in the case. How to remove the cooler is covered in the 
chapter, “Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory.”
Figure 2-15  Remove the motherboard from the case
6. The motherboard should now be free and you can carefully remove it from the case, as shown in 
Figure 2-15. Lift the board by its edges, as shown in the figure.
Caution
Never lift a motherboard by the cooler because doing so might create an air gap between the cooler 
and the processor, which can cause the processor to later overheat.

Steps to Put a Computer Back Together
To reassemble a computer, reverse the process of disassembling. Here is where your diagrams will 
be really useful and having the screws and cables organized will also help. In the directions that 
follow, we’re also considering the possibility that you are installing a replacement part as you 
reassemble the system. Do the following:
1. Install components in the case in this order: power supply, drives, motherboard, and cards. When installing 
drives, know that for some systems, it’s easier to connect data cables to the drives and then slide the drives 
into the bay. If the drive is anchored to the bay with screws or latches, be careful to align the front of the 
drive flush with the front of the case before installing screws or pushing in the latches (see Figure 2-20).

2. Place the motherboard inside the case. Make sure the ports stick out of the I/O shield at the rear of the 
case and the screw holes line up with screw holes on the bottom of the case. Figure 2-21 shows how you 
must align the screw holes on the motherboard with those in the case. There should be at least six screw 
sets, and there might be as many as nine. Use as many screws as there are holes in the motherboard.

	 A board might have a 6-pin or 8-pin PCIe power connector (see Figure 2-25). If the board has 
either connector, connect the 6-pin or 8-pin cord from the power supply to the connector. If a power 
supply doesn’t have this connector, you can use an adapter to convert two Molex connectors to 
a PCIe connector.

Figure 2-25  8-pin PCIe Version 2.0 power connector
	 Some boards designed to support multiple PCIe video cards will have additional power connectors 
on the board to power these wattage-hungry cards. For example, Figure 2-26(a) shows a Molex-style 
connector on one board that provides auxiliary power to PCIe graphics cards. This same board offers 
a SATA-style connector, shown in Figure 2-26(b). The motherboard documentation says to use just 
one of these auxiliary power connectors to provide additional wattage for PCIe video cards.

	 To power the case fan, connect the power cord from the fan to pins on the motherboard labeled  
Fan Header. Alternately, some case fans use a 4-pin Molex connector that connects to a power cable 
coming directly from the power supply.
	 If a CPU and cooler are already installed on the motherboard, connect the power cord from the CPU 
fan to the pins on the motherboard labeled CPU Fan Header.
4. Connect the wire leads from the front panel of the case to the front panel header on the motherboard. 
These are the wires for the switches, lights, and ports on the front or top of the computer. Because 
your case and your motherboard might not have been made by the same manufacturer, you need to 
pay close attention to the source of the wires to determine where they connect on the motherboard. 
For example, Figure 2-27 shows a computer case that has seven connectors from the front panel 
that connect to the motherboard. Figure 2-28 shows the front panel header on the motherboard 
for these lights and switches. If you look closely at the board in Figure 2-28, you can see labels 
identifying the pins.

To help orient the larger connectors on the motherboard pins, look for a small triangle embedded on 
the connector that marks one of the outside wires as pin 1 (see Figure 2-27). Look for pin 1 to be labeled 
on the motherboard as a small 1 embedded to either the right or the left of the group of pins. If the labels 
on the board are not clear, turn to the motherboard user guide for help. The diagram in Figure 2-29

10.	 Turn on the power and check that the PC is working properly. If the PC does not work, most likely 
the problem is a loose connection. Just turn off the power and go back and check each cable connection 
and each expansion card. You probably have not solidly seated a card in the slot. After you have 
double-checked, try again.
Now step back and congratulate yourself on a job well done! By taking a computer apart and putting it 
back together, you’ve learned much about how computer parts interconnect and work.
Now we turn our attention to laptops.
Special Considerations When Supporting Laptops
Laptops and their replacement parts cost more than desktop computers with similar features 
because their components are designed to be more compact and stand up to travel. They use 
compact hard drives, small memory modules, and CPUs that require less power than regular 
components. Whereas a desktop computer is often assembled from parts made by a variety of 
manufacturers, laptop computers are almost always sold by a vendor that either manufactured the laptop 
or had it manufactured as a consolidated system. Factors to consider that generally apply more to laptop 
than desktop computers are the original equipment manufacturer’s warranty, the service manuals and 
diagnostic software provided by the manufacturer, the customized installation of the OS that is unique to 
laptops, and the advantage of ordering replacement parts directly from the laptop manufacturer or other 
source authorized by the manufacturer.
In many situations, the tasks of maintaining, upgrading, and troubleshooting a laptop require the same 
skills, knowledge, and procedures as when servicing a desktop computer. However, you should take some 
special considerations into account when caring for, supporting, upgrading, and troubleshooting laptops. 
These same concerns apply to netbooks and all-in-one computers. Let’s begin with warranty concerns.
A+ 
220-901 
3.1, 4.5
Close the Case
The case cover to your desktop computer is off from doing the previous exercises. Before you close your case, it’s 
always a good idea to quickly clean it first. Using a can of compressed air, blow the dust away from fans and other 
components inside the case. Be careful to not touch components unless you are properly grounded. When you’re 
done, close the case cover.
Hands-On  Project 2-3
Warranty Concerns
Most manufacturers or retailers of laptops offer at least a one-year warranty and the option to 
purchase an extended warranty. Therefore, when problems arise while the laptop is under warranty, 
you are dealing with a single manufacturer or retailer to get support or parts. After the laptop is 
out of warranty, this manufacturer or retailer can still be your one-stop shop for support and parts.
A+ 
220-901 
3.1, 4.5
Caution
The warranty often applies to all components in the system, but it can be voided if someone other than an 
authorized service center services the laptop. Therefore, you, as a service technician, must be very careful not to void a 
warranty that the customer has purchased. Warranties can be voided by opening the case, removing part labels, installing 
other-vendor parts, upgrading the OS, or disassembling the system unless directly instructed to do so by the authorized 
service center help desk personnel.

Figure 2-33  The model and serial number stamped on the bottom of a laptop are used to identify the 
laptop to service desk personnel
Before you begin servicing a laptop, to avoid problems with a warranty, always ask the customer, “Is 
the laptop under warranty?” If the laptop is under warranty, look at the documentation to find out how 
to get technical support. Options are chat sessions on the web, phone numbers, and email. Use the most 
appropriate option. Before you contact technical support, have the laptop model and serial number ready 
(see Figure 2-33). You’ll also need the name, phone number, and address of the person or company that 
made the purchase. Consider asking the customer for a copy of the receipt and warranty so that you’ll 
have the information you need to talk with support personnel.
Based on the type of warranty purchased by the laptop’s owner, the manufacturer might send an 
on-site service technician, ask you to ship or take the laptop to an authorized service center, or help you 
solve the problem by an online chat session or over the phone. Table 2-1 lists some popular manufacturers 
of laptops, netbooks, and all-in-ones. Manufacturers of laptops typically also produce all-in-ones because 
of the features they have in common.

Service Manuals and Other Sources of Information
Desktop computer cases tend to be similar to one another, and components in desktop 
systems are usually interchangeable among manufacturers. Not so with laptops. Laptop 
manufacturers typically take great liberty in creating their own unique computer cases, 
buses, cables, connectors, drives, circuit boards, fans, and even screws, all of which are 
likely to be proprietary in design.
Every laptop model has a unique case. Components are installed in unique ways and opening the case 
for each laptop model is done differently. Because of these differences, servicing laptops can be very 
complicated and time consuming. For example, a hard drive on one laptop is accessed by popping open a 
side panel and sliding the drive out of its bay. However, to access the hard drive on another model laptop, 
you must remove the keyboard. If you are not familiar with a particular laptop model, you can damage 
the case frame or plastics as you pry and push trying to open it. Trial and error is likely to damage a 
case. Even though you might successfully replace a broken component, the damaged case will result in 
an unhappy customer.
Fortunately, a laptop service manual can save you much time and effort—if you can locate one 
(see Figure 2-34). Most laptop manufacturers closely guard these service manuals and release them only 
to authorized service centers. Two laptop manufacturers, Lenovo (formerly IBM ThinkPad) and Dell, 
provide their service manuals online free of charge. HP also does an excellent job of offering online 
support. For example, in Figure 2-35, you can see a video in progress showing you the steps to replace 
the optical drive in an HP laptop. I applaud Lenovo, Dell, and HP for the generous documentation 
about how their laptops are disassembled and the options to purchase proprietary parts without first 
being an authorized service center.

Notes The wiki-type website ifixit.com does an excellent job of providing its own teardown and reassemble 
instructions for many brands and models of laptops.

and replacing components

For all laptop manufacturers, check the Support or FAQ pages of their websites for help in tasks 
such as opening a case without damaging it and locating and replacing a component. Be aware that some 
manufacturers offer almost no help at all. Sometimes, you can find service manuals on the web. To find your 
manual, search on the model of laptop, for example, search on “Sony VGN-CR120E laptop service manual”.
Don’t forget about the user manuals. They might contain directions for upgrading and replacing 
components that do not require disassembling the case, such as how to upgrade memory or install 
a new hard drive. User manuals also include troubleshooting tips and procedures and possibly 
descriptions of UEFI/BIOS settings. In addition, you can use a web search engine to search on the computer 
model, component, or error message, which might give you information about the problem and solution.
Diagnostic Tools Provided by Manufacturers
Most laptop manufacturers provide diagnostic software that can help you test components to 
determine which component needs replacing. As one of the first steps when servicing a laptop, 
check the user manual, service manual, or manufacturer’s website to determine if diagnostic 
software exists and how to use it. Use the software to pinpoint the problem component, 
which can then be replaced.

Check the manufacturer’s website for diagnostics software that can be downloaded for a particular 
model laptop or stored on the hard drive or on CDs bundled with the laptop. Figure 2-36 shows 
a window provided by the diagnostics program installed on the hard drive of one laptop.
Notes When you purchase a replacement part for a laptop from the laptop’s manufacturer, most often the 
manufacturer also sends you detailed instructions for exchanging the part.
Figure 2-36  Use diagnostics software provided by a laptop manufacturer to troubleshoot hardware problems

One example of diagnostic software is PC-Doctor, which is used by several manufacturers, including 
Lenovo, Fujitsu, and HP laptops. The diagnostic software is stored on the hard drive or on CD. If stored 
on CD, you can boot from the CD to run the tests. If the software is stored on the hard drive, you can run 
it from the Windows Start menu or by pressing a function key at startup before Windows loads. Either 
way, PC-Doctor can run tests on the keyboard, video, speakers, touch pad, optical drive, wireless LAN, 
motherboard, processor, ports, hard drive, and memory. To learn how to use the software, see the laptop’s 
service manual or user manual.
Lenovo offers PC-Doctor for DOS that you can download from their website at www.lenovo.com/
support and burn to a CD. Boot from the CD and use the command-line interface of the older DOS 
operating system to run the tests. You can also find a stand-alone version of PC-Doctor for DOS and 
PC-Doctor for Windows at www.pc-doctor.com. You can purchase it at this site; it’s expensive but might 
be worth it if you plan to service many laptops.

Now let’s turn our attention to how to disassemble and reassemble a laptop.
How to Work Inside a Laptop Computer
Sometimes it is necessary to open a laptop case so you can upgrade memory, exchange 
a hard drive, or replace a failed component such as the LCD panel, video inverter, keyboard, 
touch pad, processor, optical drive, DC jack, fan, motherboard, CMOS battery, Mini-PCIe 
card, wireless card, or speaker. Most laptops sold today are designed so that you can easily 
purchase and exchange memory modules or hard drives. However, replacing a broken LCD panel or 
motherboard can be a complex process, taking several hours. Most likely, you will choose to replace 
the entire laptop rather than doing these labor-intensive and costly repairs.
Screws and nuts on a laptop are smaller than a desktop system and therefore require smaller tools. 
Figure 2-37 shows a display of several tools used to disassemble a laptop, although you can get by without 
several of them. Here’s the list:

Research Laptop Service Manuals
Do the following to find a service manual for a laptop that you have access to, such as one belonging to you or a friend:
1.	 What are the brand, model, and serial number of the laptop?
2.	 What is the website of the laptop manufacturer? Print a webpage on that site that shows the documentation 
and/or drivers available for this laptop.
3.	 If the website provides a service manual for disassembling the laptop, download the manual. Print two or 
three pages from the manual showing the title page and table of contents for the manual.
4.	 If the website does not provide a service manual, search the Internet for the manual. If you find it, download 
it and print the title page and table of contents.

Working on laptops requires extra patience. Just as when you are working with desktop systems, 
before opening the case of a laptop or touching sensitive components, you should always wear an ESD 
strap to protect the system against ESD. You can attach the alligator clip end of the strap to an unpainted 
metallic surface on the laptop. This surface could be, for instance, a port on the back of the laptop 
(see Figure 2-39). If a ground strap is not available, first dissipate any ESD between you and the laptop 
by touching a metallic unpainted part of the laptop, such as a port on the back, before you touch a 
component inside the case.

Laptops contain many small screws of various sizes and lengths. When reassembling, put screws back 
where they came from so that when you reassemble the system, you won’t use screws that are too long 
and that can protrude into a sensitive component and damage it. As you remove a screw, store or label it 
so you know where it goes when reassembling. One way to do that is to place screws in a pillbox with 
each compartment labeled. Another way is to place screws on a soft padded work surface and use white 
labeling tape to label each set of screws. A third way to organize screws is to put them on notebook 
paper and write beside them where the screw belongs (see Figure 2-40). My favorite method of keeping 
up with all those screws is to tape the screw beside the manufacturer documentation that I’m following 
to disassemble the laptop (see Figure 2-41). Whatever method you use, work methodically to keep screws 
and components organized so you know what goes where when reassembling.

Working Inside Desktop Computers and Laptops
As you disassemble the computer, if you are not following directions from a service manual, keep 
notes as you work to help you reassemble later. Draw diagrams and label things carefully. Include in 
your drawings cable orientations and screw locations. You might consider using a digital camera. Photos 
that you take at each step in the disassembly process will be a great help when it’s time to put the laptop 
back together.
When disassembling a laptop, consider the following tips:
	 Make your best effort to find the hardware service manual for the particular laptop model you are 
servicing. The manual should include all the detailed steps to disassemble the laptop and a parts list 
of components that can be ordered from the laptop manufacturer. If you don’t have this manual, your 
chances of successfully replacing an internal component are greatly reduced! And, if you don’t have 
much experience disassembling a laptop, it is not wise to attempt to do so without this manual.
	 Consider the warranty that might still apply to the laptop. Remember that opening the case of a 
laptop under warranty most likely will void the warranty. Make certain that any component you 
have purchased to replace an internal component will work in the model of laptop you are servicing.
	 Take your time. Patience is needed to keep from scratching or marring plastic screw covers, hinges, 
and the case.
	 As you work, don’t force anything. If you find yourself forcing something, you’re likely to break it.
	 Always wear an ESD strap or use other protection against ESD.
	 When removing cables, know that sometimes cable connectors are ZIF connectors. To disconnect a 
cable from a ZIF connector, first pull up on the connector and then remove the cable, as shown in 
Figure 2-42. Figure 2-43 shows a laptop using three ZIF connectors that hold the three keyboard 
cables in place.
Figure 2-42  To disconnect a ZIF 
connector, first push 
up on the connector to 
release the latch, and 
then remove the cable
Figure 2-43  Three ZIF connectors hold the three keyboard cables in place
	 Again, use a dental pick or very small screwdriver to pry up the plastic cover hiding a screw.
	 Some laptops use plastic screws that are intended to be used only once. The service manual 
will tell you to be careful to not overtighten these screws and to always use new screws when 
reassembling a laptop.

Chapter Summary
	 Disassemble the laptop by removing each field replaceable unit (FRU) in the order given 
by the service manual for your laptop. For example, one manufacturer says that to replace 
the motherboard for a laptop, remove components in this order: battery pack, RAM door, 
keyboard, middle cover, hinge cover, DVD drive and bracket, mini PCIe adapter, keyboard bezel 
assembly, fan assembly, CPU, CPU fixture, and DVD drive bracket. After all these components 
are removed, you can then remove the motherboard. Follow the steps to remove each component 
in the right order.
When reassembling a laptop, consider these general tips:
	 Reassemble the laptop in the reverse order of the way you disassembled it. Follow each step 
carefully.
	 Be sure to tighten, but not overtighten, all screws. Loose screws or metal fragments in a laptop can be 
dangerous; they might cause a short as they shift about inside the laptop.
	 Before you install the battery or AC adapter, verify that there are no loose parts inside the laptop.  
Pick it up and gently shake it. If you hear anything loose, open the case and find the loose 
component, screw, spring, or metal flake, and fix the problem.
>> Chapter Summary
How to Work inside a Desktop Computer Case
	When a hardware support technician is disassembling or reassembling a computer, it is important to stay 
organized, keep careful notes, and follow all the safety procedures to protect the computer equipment.
	Before opening a computer case, shut down the system, unplug it, disconnect all cables, and press the 
power button to drain residual power.
	An expansion card fits in a slot on the motherboard and is anchored to the case by a single screw or clip.
Special Considerations when Supporting Laptops
	Laptop computers are designed for travel. They use the same technology as desktop computers, with 
modifications for space, portability, and power conservation. A laptop generally costs more than a 
desktop with comparable power and features. Special concerns when supporting a laptop also apply 
to supporting a netbook or all-in-one computer.
	When supporting laptops, pay careful attention to what the warranty allows you to change on the 
computer.
	The laptop manufacturer documentation, including the service manual, diagnostic software, and 
recovery media, is useful when disassembling, troubleshooting, and repairing a laptop.
How to Work inside a Laptop Computer
	Field replaceable units in a laptop can include the memory modules, hard drive, LCD panel, video 
inverter, keyboard, touch pad, processor, optical drive, DC jack, fan, motherboard, CMOS battery,  
Mini-PCIe card, wireless card, or speakers.
	When an internal component needs replacing, consider the possibility of disabling the component and 
using an external peripheral device in its place. Don’t jeopardize the warranty on a laptop by opening 
the case or using components not authorized by the manufacturer.
	Replacing the laptop might be more cost effective than performing labor-intensive repairs, such as 
replacing the motherboard.

	When disassembling a laptop, the manufacturer’s service manual is essential.
	When upgrading components on a laptop, including memory, use components that are the same brand 
as the laptop, or use only components recommended by the laptop’s manufacturer.
	Follow the directions in a service manual to disassemble a laptop. Keep small screws organized as 
you disassemble a laptop because the laptop will have a variety of sizes and lengths of screws. Some 
manufacturers use plastic screws and recommend you use new screws rather than reuse the old ones.

Real Problem 2-1 Taking a Lab Computer Apart and Putting It Back Together
A PC technician needs to be comfortable with taking apart a computer and putting it back together. 
In most situations, the essential tools you’ll need for the job are an ESD strap, a Phillips-head screwdriver, 
a flathead screwdriver, paper, and pen.
Working with a partner and using a lab computer designated to be disassembled, take a computer apart. 
It is not necessary to remove the processor or memory modules from the motherboard, but be very careful 
to properly support the motherboard and processor as you remove them from the case. Then reassemble 
the system. Don’t replace the computer case panel until your instructor has inspected all cable connections. 
Then turn on the computer and verify that all is working.
Real Problem 2-2 Setting up a Service Center for Laptops
If you intend to set up your own computer repair shop, you might want to consider becoming a service 
center for a few brands of the more popular laptops. Reasons to become an authorized service center are 
that you have access to service manuals, parts lists, and wholesale parts for laptops. Do the following to 
research becoming an authorized service center:
1.		 Select a brand of laptops that you think you would like to service.
2.		 Research the website of this manufacturer and answer these questions:
a.	Where is the closest authorized service center for this brand of laptops?
b.	What are the requirements to become an authorized service center? Print the webpage showing the 
requirements.
c.	 Is A+ certification one of those requirements?
d.	Some laptop manufacturers offer a program that falls short of becoming an authorized service 
center but does provide support for IT professionals so that repair technicians can order laptop 
parts. Does the manufacturer offer this service? If so, what must you do to qualify?
If you try one brand of laptop and can’t find the information you need, try another brand. Sometimes

Working Inside Desktop Computers and Laptops
Real Problem 2-3 Taking Apart a Laptop
If you enjoy putting together a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle, you’ll probably enjoy working on laptop 
computers. With desktop systems, replacing a component is not a time-consuming task, but with laptops, 
the job could take half a day. If you take the time to carefully examine the laptop’s case before attempting 
to open it, you will probably find markings provided by the manufacturer to assist you in locating 
components that are commonly upgraded. If you have a service manual, your work will be much easier 
than without one.
The best way to learn to disassemble a laptop is to practice on an old one that you can afford to break. 
Find an old Dell or Lenovo or IBM ThinkPad for which you can download the service manual from the 
Dell or Lenovo website. Carefully and patiently follow the disassembly instructions and then reassemble it. 
When done, you can congratulate yourself and move on to newer laptops.

All About Motherboards
I
n previous chapters, you learned how to work inside a computer 
and began the process of learning about each major component 
or subsystem in a computer case. In this chapter, we build on all that 
knowledge to learn about motherboards, which techies sometimes 
call the mobo. You’ll learn about the many different features of 
a motherboard, including motherboard sockets, chipsets, buses, 
expansion slots, and onboard ports and connectors. Then you’ll 
learn how to support a motherboard, and that includes configuring, 
maintaining, installing, and replacing it. A motherboard is considered 
a field replaceable unit, so it’s important to know how to replace 
one, but the good news is you don’t need to know how to repair 
one that is broken. Troubleshooting a motherboard works hand in 
hand with troubleshooting the processor and other components that 
must work to boot up a computer, so we’ll leave troubleshooting 
the motherboard until later chapters.

Motherboard Types and Features
A motherboard is the most complicated component in a computer. When you put together a 
computer from parts, generally you start with deciding which processor and motherboard you 
will use. Everything else follows these two decisions. Take a look at the details of Figure 3-1, 
which shows a microATX motherboard by Intel that can hold an Intel Core i7, Core i5, or 
Core i3 processor in the LGA1155 processor socket. When selecting a motherboard, generally you’d need 
to pay attention to the form factor, processor socket, chipset, buses and number of bus slots, and other 
connectors, slots, and ports. In this part of the chapter, we’ll look at the details of each of these features 
so that you can read a technical motherboard ad with the knowledge of a pro and know how to select 
the right motherboard when replacing an existing one or when building a new system.

Motherboard Form Factors
Recall from the chapter, “First Look at Computer Parts and Tools,” that a motherboard 
form factor determines the size of the board and its features that make it compatible with 
power supplies and cases. The most popular motherboard form factors are ATX, microATX 
(a smaller version of ATX), and Mini-ITX (a smaller version of microATX). You saw a 
microATX motherboard in Figure 3-1. Figure 3-2 shows an ATX board, and a Mini-ITX board is shown 
in Figure 3-3. The Mini-ITX board is also commonly referred to as an ITX board.

Processor Sockets
Another important feature of a motherboard is the processor socket. This socket and the 
chipset determine which processors a board can support. A socket for a desktop or laptop 
computer is designed to hold either an Intel processor or an AMD processor. Some older 
processors were installed on the motherboard in a long narrow slot, but all processors sold 
today use sockets. Now let’s look at sockets for Intel and AMD processors.
Sockets for Intel Processors
Table 3-2 lists the sockets used by Intel processors for desktop systems. The first two sockets are currently 
used by new Intel processors. The last six sockets in the table have been discontinued by Intel, but you still 
need to be able to support them because you might be called on to replace a processor or motherboard that 
uses one of these legacy sockets. The types of memory listed in the table that are used with these sockets 
are explained in detail in the chapter, “Supporting the Power System and Troubleshooting Computers.” Intel 
also makes several Itanium and Xeon processors designed for servers. These server processors might use 
different sockets than those listed in the table. Mobile processor sockets are also not included in the table.

All About Motherboards
Sockets and processors use different methods to make the contacts between them. Here is a list of the 
more important methods:
	 A pin grid array (PGA) socket has holes aligned in uniform rows around the socket to receive the pins 
on the bottom of the processor. Early Intel processors used PGA sockets, but they caused problems 
because the small delicate pins on the processor were easily bent as the processor was installed in the 
socket. Some newer Intel mobile processors, including the Second Generation Core i3, Core i5, and 
Core i7 processors, use the PGA988 socket or the FCPGA988 socket in laptops.
	 A land grid array (LGA) socket has blunt protruding pins on the socket that connect with lands or 
pads on the bottom of the processor. The first LGA socket was the LGA775 socket. It has 775 pins and 
is shown with the socket lever and top open in Figure 3-7. Another LGA socket is the LGA1366 shown 
in Figure 3-8. LGA sockets generally give better contacts than PGA sockets, and the processor doesn’t 
have the delicate pins so easily damaged during an installation. You learn how to use both sockets in 
the chapter, “Supporting the Power System and Troubleshooting Computers.”

	 Some sockets can handle a processor using a flip-chip land grid array (FCLGA) processor package or 
a flip-chip pin grid array (FCPGA) package. The chip is flipped over so that the top of the chip is on the 
bottom and makes contact with the socket. The LGA1155 socket has a flip-chip version, which is called 
the FCLGA1155 socket. The two sockets are not compatible.
	 A staggered pin grid array (SPGA) socket has pins staggered over the socket to squeeze more pins into a 
small space.
	 A ball grid array (BGA) connection is not really a socket. The processor is soldered to the motherboard, 
and the two are always purchased as a unit. For example, the little Atom processors often use this 
technology with a Mini-ITX motherboard in low-end computers or home theater systems.

Caution
When a processor is installed in a socket, extreme care must be taken to protect the socket and 
the processor against ESD and from damage caused by bending the pins or scratching the socket holes during the 
installation. Take care to not touch the bottom of the processor or the pins or holes of the socket, which can leave 
finger oil on the gold plating of the contact surfaces. This oil can later cause tarnishing and lead to a poor contact.

So that even force is applied when inserting the processor in the socket, all current processor sockets 
have one or two levers on the sides of the socket. These sockets are called zero insertion force (ZIF) 
sockets, and this lever is used to lift the processor up and out of the socket. Push the levers down and 
the processor moves into its pin or hole connectors with equal force over the entire housing. Because the 
socket and processor are so delicate, processors generally should not be removed or replaced repeatedly.
Sockets for AMD Processors
Table 3-3 lists the AMD sockets for desktop systems. AMD has chosen to use the PGA socket 
architecture for its desktop processors. (Some of AMD’s server processors use Socket F, which is an LGA 
socket.) Figure 3-10 shows the AM2+ socket. The lever on the side of the socket is lifted, and an Athlon 
64 processor is about to be inserted. If you look closely near the lower edge of the processor, you can see 
the small delicate pins that will seat into the holes of the socket.

Match a Processor to the Socket and Motherboard
As you glance over Tables 3-2 and 3-3, you’ll notice the same processor family listed under several 
different sockets. For example, the AMD Athlon family of processors offers many versions of the Athlon. 
Among these are the Athlon X2 Dual-Core, the Athlon Neo, and the Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core. Because 
these various processors within the same processor family use different sockets, you must be careful when 
matching a processor to a motherboard. To be certain you have a good match, search the Intel (www.intel 
.com) or AMD (www.amd.com) website for the exact processor you are buying and make sure the socket 
it uses is the same as the socket on the motherboard you plan to use.
Also, look at the motherboard manufacturer’s website or user guide for a list of processors that 
the motherboard supports. It’s not likely to support every processor that uses its socket because the 
motherboard chipset is designed to work only with certain processors.
The Chipset
A chipset is a set of chips on the motherboard that works closely with the processor to 
collectively control the memory, buses on the motherboard, and some peripherals. The chipset 
must be compatible with the processor it serves. The two major chipset manufacturers are 
Intel (www.intel.com) and AMD (www.amd.com).
Intel dominates the chipset market for several reasons: It knows more about its own Intel processors 
than other manufacturers do, and it produces the chipsets most compatible with the Intel family of 
processors.

Intel Chipsets
Intel has produced far too many chipsets to list them here. To see a complete comparison chart of all Intel 
chipsets, start at the Intel link ark.intel.com.
Here is a list of the more significant chipset families by Intel:
	North Bridge and South Bridge use a hub architecture. Beginning with the release in 2006 of the 
Intel i800 series of chipsets, a hub using the Accelerated Hub Architecture is used to connect buses 
(see Figure 3-11). This hub has a fast and slow end, and each end is a separate chip on the 
motherboard. The fast end of the hub, called the North Bridge, contains the graphics and memory 
controller, and connects directly to the processor by way of a 64-bit bus, called the Front Side Bus 
(FSB), system bus, or host bus. The slower end of the hub, called the South Bridge, contains the I/O 
controller hub (ICH). All I/O (input/output) devices, except video, connect to the hub by using the 
slower South Bridge. Notice that in Figure 3-11, the primary PCI Express slot, the slot designated for 
the video card, has direct access to the North Bridge, but other PCI Express slots must access the 
processor by way of the slower South Bridge. On a motherboard, when you see two major chip

and FM2+.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam does not expect you to be familiar with the processor sockets used by laptop 
computers. For laptops, generally, it is more cost effective to replace a laptop that has a damaged processor than to 
replace the processor. If you are called on to replace a laptop processor, however, always use a processor the laptop 
manufacturer recommends for the particular laptop model and system board CPU socket.

	Nehalem chipsets with the memory controller in the processor. The release of the X58 chipset in 2008 
was significant because, with previous chipsets, the memory controller was part of the North Bridge. 
But beginning with the X58, the memory controller was contained in the processor housing. For 
example, in Figure 3-12, the Core i7 processor contains the memory controller. Notice that memory 
connects directly to the processor rather than to the North Bridge. Another significant change is the 
64-bit Front Side Bus was replaced with a technology called the QuickPath Interconnect (QPI). 
The QPI has 16 lanes for data packets and works similar to how PCI Express works. All Intel 
chipsets since the X58 use QuickPath Interconnects. A motherboard using the X58 chipset is shown 
in Figure 3-13. The board comes with a fan that can be clipped to the top of the North Bridge to 
help keep the chipset cool.
	
	 Nehalem chipsets, which Intel has begun to call the previous generation of chipsets, support the Intel 
LGA1366 socket, the Core i7 processors, and PCI Express Version 2. They can also support either SLI 
or CrossFire technologies. (SLI and CrossFire are two competing technologies that allow for multiple 
video cards installed in one system.)

	Sandy Bridge chipsets with the memory and graphics controller in the processor. In 2011, Intel 
introduced its second-generation chipsets and sockets, which it code-named Sandy Bridge technologies. 
Rather than using the traditional North Bridge and South Bridge, only one chipset housing is needed, 
which houses the Platform Controller Hub. The processor interfaces directly with the faster graphics 
PCI Express 2.0 bus as well as with memory (see Figure 3-14). Therefore, both the memory controller 
and graphics controller are contained within all Sandy Bridge processors. Sandy Bridge processors, 
such as the Second Generation Core i7, use the LGA1155 or the LGA2011 socket, and Sandy Bridge 
motherboards use DDR3 memory. The Sandy Bridge H67 chipset on an Intel motherboard is shown in 
Figure 3-15 and earlier in Figure 3-1.

	Ivy Bridge chipsets. Third-generation processors and chipsets by Intel, released in 2012 and code-named 
Ivy Bridge, use less power, squeeze more transistors into a smaller space, and perform better than earlier 
products. Ivy Bridge chipsets include B75, Q75, Q77, H77, Z75, and Z77. Several Ivy Bridge processors 
use the LGA1155 socket for backward compatibility with earlier motherboards. The Ivy Bridge chipset 
uses a single Platform Controller Hub.

	Haswell and Broadwell chipsets. In 2013, Intel introduced the Haswell chipsets, which work with the 
LGA1150 and LGA2011 sockets in desktops and servers and also work with low-power processors in 
laptops and ultrabooks (very thin laptops). The chipsets work with DDR3 and DDR4 memory and use 
less power than previous chipset architectures. Broadwell chipsets, released in 2015, are a little faster 
than the Haswell chipsets and can also use the LGA1150 socket.
AMD Chipsets
AMD specializes in chipsets and graphics processors (called a graphics processor unit or GPU) that target 
the gaming and hobbyist markets. The two current chipset families by AMD are:
	A-Series chipsets. These chipsets are designed to support the AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU). 
An APU is a combination of a CPU and a graphics processor unit (GPU) in the same processor housing. 
In traditional desktops with high graphics needs, the CPU is installed on the motherboard and a GPU is 
embedded on a video card, also called a graphics adapter, installed in the system. The A-Series chipsets 
also support AMD CrossFire technology, which uses dual video cards in the same system.
	9-Series chipsets. These chipsets are designed to support AMD processors that can have up to eight cores. 
You’ll learn more about processor cores in the chapter, “Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory.”
Notes The Skylake chipset architecture is expected to be released by the time this text is published. The chipset will 
use the new LGA1151 socket and will support DDR3 and DDR4 memory.

Buses and Expansion Slots
When you look carefully at a motherboard, you see many fine lines on both the top and 
the bottom of the board’s surface (see Figure 3-16). These lines, sometimes called traces, 
are circuits or paths that enable data, instructions, and power to move from component to 
component on the board. This system of pathways used for communication and the protocol 
and methods used for transmission are collectively called the bus. (A protocol is a set of rules and 
standards that any two entities use for communication.) The parts of the bus that we are most familiar 
with are the lines of the bus that are used for data; these lines are called the data bus. A bus can also carry 
electrical power (to power components on the motherboard), control signals (to coordinate activity), and 
memory addresses (for one program to tell another program where to find data or instructions).

All data and instructions inside a computer exist in binary, which means there are only two states: on 
and off. Binary data is put on a line of a bus by placing voltage on that line. We can visualize that bits are 
“traveling” down the bus in parallel, but in reality, the voltage placed on each line is not “traveling”; rather, 
it is all over the line. When one component at one end of the line wants to write data to another component, 
the two components get in sync for the write operation. Then, the first component places voltage on several 
lines of the bus, and the other component immediately reads the voltage on these lines. The CPU or other 
devices interpret the voltage, or lack of voltage, on each line on the bus as binary digits (0s or 1s).

The width of a data bus is called the data path size. Some buses have data paths that are 8, 16, 32, 
64, 128, or more bits wide. For example, a bus that has eight wires, or lines, to transmit data is called an 
8-bit bus. Figure 3-17 shows an 8-bit bus between the CPU and memory that is transmitting the letter A 
(binary 0100 0001). All bits of a byte are placed on their lines of the bus at the same time: no voltage for 
binary zero and voltage for binary one. For every eight bits of a bus, a bus might use a ninth bit for error 
checking. Adding a check bit for each byte allows the component reading the data to verify that it is the 
same data written to the bus.

and other devices as bits
One of the most interesting lines, or circuits, on a bus is the system clock or system timer, which is 
dedicated to timing the activities on the motherboard much like a metronome helps a musician with timing. 
The chipset sends out a continuous pulsating electrical signal on one line of the system bus. This one system 
clock line, dedicated to carrying the pulse, is read by other components on the motherboard (including the 
processor, bus slots, memory slots, and so forth) and ensures that all activities are synchronized. Remember 
that everything in a computer is binary, and this includes the activities themselves. Instead of continuously 
working to perform commands or move data, the CPU, bus, and other devices work in a binary fashion—do 
something, stop, do something, stop, and so forth. Each device works on a clock cycle or beat of the clock. 
Some devices, such as the CPU, do two or more operations on one beat of the clock, and others do one 
operation for each beat. Some devices might even do something on every other beat, but most components 
inside the system work according to these beats or cycles.
You can think of this as similar to children jumping rope. The system clock (child turning the rope) 
provides the beats or cycles, while devices (children jumping) work in a binary fashion (jump, don’t jump). 
In the analogy, some children jump two or more times for each rope pass.
The speed of memory, Front Side Bus, processor, or other component is measured in hertz (Hz), which is 
one cycle per second; megahertz (MHz), which is one million cycles per second; and gigahertz (GHz), which 
is one billion cycles per second. Common ratings for memory are 1333 MHz and 1866 MHz. Common 
ratings for Front Side Buses are 2600 MHz, 2000 MHz, 1600 MHz, 1333 MHz, 1066 MHz, 800 MHz, 
533 MHz, or 400 MHz. A CPU operates from 166 MHz to almost 4 GHz. The CPU can put data or 
instructions on its internal bus at a much higher rate than does the motherboard. Although we often refer 
to the speed of the CPU and memory, talking about the frequency of these devices is more accurate, because 
the term speed implies a continuous flow, while the term frequency implies a digital or binary flow: on 
and off, on and off.
Notes If the processor requests something from a slow device and the device is not ready, the device issues a wait state, 
which is a command to the processor to wait for slower devices to catch up.

All About Motherboards
A motherboard can have more than one bus, each using a different protocol, speed, data path size, and 
so on. Table 3-4 lists the various buses used on motherboards today, in order of throughput speed from 
fastest to slowest. (Throughput is sometimes called bandwidth.) Looking at the second column of Table 3-4, 
you can see that a bus is called an expansion bus, local bus, local I/O bus, or local video bus. A bus that 
does not run in sync with the system clock is called an expansion bus. For chipsets that use a South Bridge, 
expansion buses always connect here. Most buses today are local buses, meaning they run in sync with the 
system clock. If a local bus connects to the slower I/O controller hub or South Bridge of the chipset, it is 
called a local I/O bus. Because the video card needs to run at a faster rate than other adapter cards, this one 
slot always connects to the faster end of the chipset, the North Bridge, or directly to the processor when 
using Sandy Bridge or later technologies. Today’s boards use PCI Express x16 slots for video cards. These 
video buses that connect to the older North Bridge or directly to the processor are called local video buses.
So now let’s look at the details of the PCI, PCI-X, and PCIe expansion slots used in desktops. We’ll also 
discuss the MiniPCI expansion slots used in laptops. The FireWire and USB buses are discussed in the 
chapter, “Supporting I/O Devices.”
Conventional PCI
The first PCI bus had a 32-bit data path, supplied 5 V of power to an adapter card, and operated at 33 MHz. 
It was the first bus that allowed adapter cards to run in sync with the CPU. PCI Version 2.x introduced the 
64-bit, 3.3-V PCI slot, doubling data throughput of the bus. Because a card can be damaged if installed in the 
wrong voltage slot, a notch in a PCI slot distinguishes between a 5-V slot and a 3.3-V slot. A Universal PCI 
card can use either a 3.3-V or 5-V slot and contains both notches (see Figure 3-18). Conventional PCI is no 
longer evolving and ended up with four types of slots and six possible PCI card configurations to use these 
slots. These slots and cards include 32-bit PCI and 64-bit PCI-X, all shown in Figure 3-19.
Notes Rather than measuring the frequency of a system bus, sometimes you see a system bus measured in 
performance such as the GA-990FXA-UD3 motherboard by GIGABYTE (see www.gigabyte.us). This system bus is rated at 
5.2 GT/s or 5200 MT/s. One GT/s is one billion transfers per second, and one MT/s is one million transfers per second.

PCI-X
The next evolution of PCI is PCI-X, which uses a 64-bit data path and had three major revisions; the last and 
final revision is PCI-X 3.0. All PCI-X revisions are backward compatible with conventional PCI cards and 
slots, except 5-V PCI cards are not supported. PCI-X focused on the server market; therefore, it’s unlikely 
you’ll see PCI-X slots in desktop computers. Motherboards that use PCI-X tend to have several different PCI 
slots with some 32-bit or 64-bit slots running at different speeds. For example, Figure 3-20 shows a server 
motherboard with three types of slots. The two long white slots are PCI-X; the two shorter white slots are PCI, 
and the two black slots are PCIe. The two PCI-X slots can use most 32-bit and 64-bit PCI or PCI-X cards.

PCI Express
PCI Express (PCIe) uses an altogether different architectural design than conventional PCI and PCI-X 
and is not backward compatible with either. PCI Express will ultimately replace both these buses, although 
it is expected PCI Express will coexist with conventional PCI for some time to come (see Figure 3-21). 
Whereas PCI uses a 32-bit or 64-bit parallel bus, PCI Express uses a serial bus, which is faster than 
a parallel bus because it transmits data in packets similar to how Ethernet, USB, and FireWire transmit 
data. A PCIe expansion slot can provide one or more of these serial lanes.

Another difference in PCI Express is how it connects to the processor. One or more PCI Express slots 
used for video cards have a direct link to the North Bridge or to the processor (using Sandy Bridge or later 
architecture). Refer back to Figures 3-10, 3-11, and 3-13.
PCI Express currently comes in four different slot sizes called PCI Express ×1 (pronounced “by one”), 
×4, ×8, and ×16. Figure 3-21 shows three of these slots. Notice in the photo how the PCIe slots are not 
as tall and the pins are closer together than the conventional PCI slot. A PCI Express ×1 slot contains a 
single lane for data; this lane is actually four wires. One pair of wires is used to send data and the other 
pair receives data, one bit at a time. The ×16 slot contains 16 lanes, with each lane timed independently of 
other lanes. The more lanes you have, the more data gets transmitted in a given time. Therefore, a ×16 slot 
is faster than a ×4 slot, which is faster than a ×1 slot. A shorter PCI Express card (such as a ×1 card) can 
be installed in a longer PCI Express slot (such as a ×4 slot).
Revisions of PCIe include PCIe version 1.1, PCIe version 2.0 and 2.1, PCIe version 3.0, and PCIe version 4.0. 
Here are important facts about each PCIe version:
	 PCIe version 1.0. The original PCIe version 1.0 allowed for 150 W to PCIe cards. Pins on the 
expansion card provide 75 W, and a new 6-pin PCIe connector from the power supply provides 
an additional 75 W.
	 PCIe version 1.1. PCIe version 1.1 allowed for more wattage to PCIe cards, up to 225 W. The standard 
allows for two 6-pin PCIe connectors from the power supply to the card. Therefore, the total 225 W 
comes as 75 W from the slot and 150 W from the two connectors.
	 PCIe version 2.0. PCIe version 2.0 doubled the frequency of the PCIe bus and allows for up to 32 lanes 
on one slot (though few motherboards or cards actually use 32 lane slots). The allowed wattage to one 
PCIe 2.0 card was increased to a total of 300 W by using a new 8-pin PCIe power connector that provides 
150 W (see Figure 3-22). The 300 W to the card come from the slot (75 W), from the 8-pin connector 
(150 W), and an additional 75 W come from a second auxiliary connector on the motherboard. This 
second connector can be a 6-pin PCIe connector, a Molex-style connector, or a SATA-style connector. 
You’ll see an example of these connectors later in this chapter.
8-pin connector
Figure 3-22  8-pin PCIe Version 2.0 power connector
	 PCIe versions 3.0 and 4.0. PCIe version 3.0 roughly doubles the speed of PCIe version 2.0 and is 
backward compatible with PCIe version 2.0 components. PCIe version 4.0 doubles the speed of PCIe 
version 3.0 and is also backward compatible with earlier PCIe standards; PCIe version 4.0 devices 
are not yet available on the market.
Mini PCI and Mini PCIe in Laptop Computers
Smaller versions of the PCI and PCIe slots are used in laptops, all-in-one computers, and with small 
form factor motherboards such as the Mini-ITX board. The Mini PCI slot follows the PCI standards 
and the Mini PCI Express slot follows the PCI Express standards. To save space, the slots lay flat on 
the motherboard and hold an expansion card parallel to the board.

Mini PCIe slots have 52 or 54 pins on the edge connector and have one notch offset from the center 
of the slot (see Figure 3-23). One screw holds the card securely in the slot. The Mini PCI slot is wider 
and has 100 or 124 pins and a notch slightly offset from the end of the slot (see Figure 3-24).

PCI Riser Cards Used to Extend the Slots
Suppose you are installing a Mini-ITX or microATX motherboard into a low-profile or 
slimline case that does not give you enough room to install a PCI card standing up in an 
expansion slot. In this situation, a PCI riser card can solve the problem. The riser card installs 
in the slot and provides another slot at a right angle (see Figure 3-25). When you install an 
expansion card in this riser card slot, the card sits parallel to the motherboard, taking up less space. These 
riser cards come for all types of PCI slots, including PCIe, PCI-X, and conventional PCI.

Onboard Ports and Connectors
In addition to expansion slots, a motherboard might also have several ports and internal 
connectors. Ports coming directly off the motherboard are called onboard ports or integrated 
components. Almost all motherboards have two or more USB ports and sound ports. Boards 
might also offer a network port, FireWire (IEEE 1394) port, one or more video ports, one or 
more eSATA ports (for external SATA hard drives), parallel port, serial port, a port for a wireless antenna, 
and PS/2 ports for a mouse and keyboard. Older motherboards might have a modem port. Figure 3-26

in the computer case that provides holes for these I/O ports. The I/O shield is the size designed for the case’s 
form factor, and the holes in the shield are positioned for the motherboard ports (see Figure 3-27). When 
you first install a motherboard, you might need to install the drivers that come on the DVD or CD bundled 
with the board before some of the motherboard ports will work. How to install the motherboard drivers is 
covered later in this chapter.

A motherboard might have several internal connectors, including SATA, USB, and FireWire (IEEE 1394) 
connectors. When you purchase a motherboard, look in the package for the motherboard manual either 
printed or on DVD or CD. It will show a diagram of the board with a description of each connector. For 
example, the connectors for the motherboard in Figure 3-28 are labeled as the manual describes them.  
If a connector is a group of pins sticking up on the board, the connector is called a header. You will learn 
to use most of these connectors in later chapters.

Documentation
The motherboard user guide is essential to identifying components on a board and knowing how to 
support the board. This guide can be a PDF file stored on the CD or DVD that came bundled with 
the motherboard. If you don’t have the CD, you can download the user guide from the motherboard 
manufacturer’s website.
To find the correct user guide online, you need to know the board manufacturer and model. If a motherboard 
is already installed in a computer, you can use the Windows System Information utility (msinfo32.exe) to report 
the brand and model of the board. To access the utility, for Windows 8.x, from the desktop, right-click Start, 
click Run, and type msinfo32.exe in the Run box. (For Windows 7/Vista, click Start, type msinfo32.exe in the 
Search box, and press Enter.) In the System Information window, click System Summary. In the System Summary 
information in the right pane, look for the motherboard information labeled as the System Manufacturer and 
System Model (see Figure 3-29).

Configuring a Motherboard
3
Now that you know what to expect when examining or selecting a motherboard, let’s see how to 
configure a board.
Configuring a Motherboard
Firmware on the motherboard is used to enable or disable a connector, port, or component; 
control the frequency of the CPU, security features, and what happens when the PC first boots; 
and monitor various activities of the board. Today’s motherboards may use these types of 
firmware:
	 BIOS. BIOS is used on older motherboards.
	 UEFI. Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is replacing BIOS and is used on most 
motherboards made after 2012. Microsoft requires UEFI in order for the system to be certified for 
Windows 8 and later. UEFI is also required for hard drives larger than 2 TB. (One terabyte or TB 
equals 1000 gigabytes or GB.)
	 UEFI with BIOS. Most personal computer motherboards contain UEFI firmware with BIOS also 
provided for backward compatibility with older devices.
As an IT support technician, you need to know how to configure the BIOS or UEFI firmware settings. 
We first look at how to configure BIOS settings and then we’ll see how to configure UEFI settings.

Using BIOS Setup to Configure a Motherboard
The motherboard settings don’t normally need to be changed except, for example, when there 
is a problem with hardware, or a power-saving feature or security feature (such as a power-on 
password) needs to be disabled or enabled.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know about BIOS settings regarding RAM, the hard drive, 
optical drive, CPU, boot sequence, enabling and disabling devices, system date and time, virtualization support, 
passwords, drive encryption, and monitoring temperature, fan speeds, intrusion detection, voltage, and clock and bus 
speeds. All these settings are covered in this part of the chapter.
Examine Motherboard Documentation
Using the motherboard brand and model installed in your computer, or another motherboard brand and 
model assigned by your instructor, download the user guide from the motherboard manufacturer and 
answer these questions:

All About Motherboards
Access the BIOS Setup Program
You access the BIOS setup program by pressing a key or combination of keys during the boot process. 
For most motherboards, you press F2 or Del during the boot. For a few older motherboards, you press 
Ctrl+Alt+Esc. See the motherboard documentation to know for sure which keys to press. A message such 
as the following usually appears on the screen near the beginning of the boot:
Press DEL to change Setup
or
Press F2 for Setup
When you press the appropriate key or keys, a setup screen appears with menus and Help features that are often 
very user-friendly. Although the exact menus depend on the BIOS maker, the sample screens that follow will help 
you become familiar with the general contents of BIOS setup screens. Figure 3-31 shows a main menu for setup. 
On this menu, you can view information about the BIOS version, processor model and speed, memory speed, total 
memory, and the amount of memory in each memory slot. You can also change the system date and time.
Figure 3-31  BIOS setup main menu

Now let’s examine setup screens that apply to the boot sequence, virtualization, built-in diagnostics, 
monitoring the system, and security.
Change the Boot Sequence
Figure 3-32 shows an example of a boot menu in BIOS setup. Here, you can set the order in which the system 
tries to boot from certain devices (called the boot sequence or boot priority). Most likely when you first install 
a hard drive or an operating system, you will want to have the BIOS attempt to first boot from a DVD so that

you can install Windows from the setup DVD. After the OS is installed, to prevent accidental boots from a 
DVD or other media, change setup BIOS to boot first from the hard drive. Notice in Figure 3-32 the option to 
perform a UEFI Boot. This particular motherboard holds both BIOS and UEFI firmware.
Figure 3-32  Set the boot priority order in BIOS setup
Source: Intel
Also, the BIOS setup boot screens might give you options regarding built-in diagnostics that occur at 
the boot. Recall from the chapter, “First Look at Computer Parts and Tools,” that these tests are called the 
POST (power-on self test). You can configure some motherboards to perform a quick boot and bypass 
the extensive POST. For these systems, if you are troubleshooting a boot problem, be sure to set BIOS 
to perform the full POST.
Configure Onboard Devices
You can enable or disable some onboard devices (for example, a network port, FireWire port, USB ports, 
or video ports) using setup BIOS. For one system, the Configuration screen shown in Figure 3-33 does the 
job. On this screen, you can enable or disable a port or group of ports, and you can configure the Front 
Panel Audio ports for Auto, High Definition audio, and Legacy audio, or you can disable these audio ports. 
What you can configure on your system depends on the onboard devices the motherboard offers.

View Hard Drive and Optical Drive Information
Using setup BIOS, you can view information about installed hard drives and optical drives. For example, 
in Figure 3-34, one system shows five internal SATA and eSATA ports and one external eSATA port. One 
120-GB hard drive is installed on SATA port 0, and another 1000-GB hard drive is installed on SATA 
port 1. Both ports are internal SATA connectors on the motherboard. Notice the optical drive is installed 
on SATA port 3, also an internal connector on the motherboard.

Processor and Clock Speeds
Overclocking is running a processor, memory, motherboard, or video card at a higher speed than the 
manufacturer recommends. Some motherboards allow overclocking. If you decide to overclock a system, 
pay careful attention to the temperature of the processor so it does not overheat; overheating can damage 
the processor. Figure 3-35 shows one BIOS setup screen for adjusting performance. Notice on the screen 
the Host Clock Frequency. This is the basic system clock provided by the chipset, by which all other 
components synchronize activities. The Core Max Multiplier on this screen is 33. (This value is sometimes 
called the bus/core ratio.) When you multiply 100 MHz by 33, you get 3.30 GHz, which is the frequency 
of the processor. This board uses the QuickPath Interconnect. For older boards that use a Front Side Bus, 
you can change the speed of the FSB to overclock the system, which affects the processor and memory 
speeds. On some boards, you can change the processor multiplier to change the processor speed and/or 
change the memory multiplier to affect memory speed.
Notes You don’t have to replace an entire motherboard if one port fails. For example, if the network port fails, use 
BIOS setup to disable the port. Then use an expansion card for the port instead.

Monitor Temperatures, Fan Speeds, and Voltages
Using BIOS setup screens, you can monitor temperatures inside the case, fan speeds, and voltages. One 
BIOS screen that allows you to monitor these values and also control fan speeds is shown in Figure 3-36. 
Case and CPU fans on modern computers adjust their speeds based on the temperatures of the CPU, memory, 
and motherboard. You can also install software (for example, SpeedFan by Alfredo Comparetti at www 
.almico.com/speedfan.php) in Windows to monitor temperatures and control fan speeds. To use the software, 
you might need to change a BIOS setting to allow software to control the speeds. For this system, when you 
select Processor Temperature, you can set the threshold temperatures that software uses to create an alert.

Intrusion Detection
BIOS settings might offer several security features, and one of these is an intrusion-detection alert. For example, for 
the BIOS setup screen shown in Figure 3-37, you can enable event logging, which logs when the case is opened. To 
use the feature, you must use a cable to connect a switch on the case to a header on the motherboard.
Figure 3-37  BIOS is enabled to log a chassis intrusion
Source: Intel
When the security measure is in place and the case is opened, BIOS displays an alert the next time the system 
is powered up. For example, the alert message at startup might be “Chassis Intruded! System has halted.” If you 
see this message, know that the case has been opened. Reboot the system and the system should start up as usual. 
To make sure the alert was not tripped by accident, verify that the case cover is securely in place. Also, sometimes 
a failed CMOS battery can trip the alert. Intrusion-detection devices are not a recommended best practice for 
security. False alerts are annoying, and criminals generally know how to get inside a case without tripping the alert.
Power-on Passwords
Another security feature is power-on passwords assigned in BIOS setup to prevent unauthorized access to 
the computer and/or the BIOS setup utility. For one motherboard, this security screen looks like the one 
shown in Figure 3-38, where you can set a supervisor password and a user password. In addition, you can 
configure how the user password works.

The choices under User Access Level are No Access (the user cannot access the BIOS setup utility), View 
Only (the user can access BIOS setup, but cannot make changes), Limited (the user can access BIOS setup 
and make a few changes such as date and time), and Full Access (the user can access the BIOS setup utility 
and make any changes). When supervisor and user passwords are both set and you boot the system, a box 
to enter a password is displayed. What access you have depends on which password you enter. Also, if both 
passwords are set, you must enter a valid password to boot the system. By setting both passwords, you can 
totally lock down the computer from unauthorized access.
BIOS Support for Virtualization
Virtualization is when one physical machine hosts multiple activities that are normally done on multiple 
machines. One type of virtualization is the use of virtual machines. A virtual computer or virtual machine (VM) 
is software that simulates the hardware of a physical computer. Each VM running on a computer works like a 
physical computer and is assigned virtual devices such as a virtual motherboard and virtual hard drive. Examples 
of VM software are Windows Virtual PC, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Oracle VirtualBox. For most VM software 
to work, virtualization must be enabled in BIOS setup. Looking back at Figure 3-38, you can see the option to 
enable Intel VT. Intel VT is the name that Intel gives to its virtualization technology.
LoJack for Laptops Technology
LoJack is a technology embedded in the BIOS of many laptops to protect a system against theft. When 
you subscribe to the LoJack for Laptops service by Absolute (www.absolute.com), the Computrace Agent 
software is installed. The software and BIOS work together to protect the system. The company can locate 
your laptop whenever it connects to the Internet, and you can give commands through the Internet to lock 
the laptop or delete all data on it.
Drive Encryption and Drive Password Protection
Some motherboards and hard drives allow you to set a password that must be entered before someone 
can access the hard drive. This password is kept on the drive and works even if the drive is moved to 
another computer. Some manufacturers of storage media offer similar products. For example, Seagate 
(www.seagate.com) offers Maxtor BlackArmor, a technology that encrypts an entire external storage  
device that is password protected.
Caution
In the event that passwords are forgotten, know that supervisor and user passwords to the computer can 
be reset by setting a jumper (group of pins) on the motherboard to clear all BIOS customized settings and return BIOS 
setup to its default settings. To keep someone from using this technique to access the computer, you can use a computer 
case with a lockable side panel and install a lock on the case. How to use jumpers is covered later in this chapter.
Notes For added protection, configure the BIOS setup utility so that a user cannot boot from a removable device 
such as a CD, USB device, or floppy disk.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know how to use BIOS setup to secure a workstation from 
unauthorized use.
Notes Drive lock password protection might be too secure at times. I know of a situation where a hard drive with 
password protection became corrupted. Normally, you might be able to move the drive to another computer and recover 
some data. However, this drive asked for the password, but then could not confirm it. Therefore, the entire drive, 
including all the data, was inaccessible.

The TPM Chip and Hard Drive Encryption
Many high-end computers have a chip on the motherboard called the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip. 
The BitLocker Encryption tool in Windows 8/7/Vista is designed to work with this chip; the chip holds the 
BitLocker encryption key (also called the startup key). The TPM chip can also be used with other encryption 
software that may be installed on the hard drive other than BitLocker. If the hard drive is stolen from the 
computer and installed in another computer, the data would be safe because BitLocker has encrypted all 
contents on the drive and would not allow access without the startup key stored on the TPM chip. Therefore, 
this method assures that the drive cannot be used in another computer. However, if the motherboard fails 
and is replaced, you’ll need a backup copy of the startup key to access data on the hard drive.
When you use Windows to install BitLocker Encryption, the initialization process also initializes the TPM 
chip. Initializing the TPM chip configures it and turns it on. After BitLocker is installed, you can temporarily 
turn off BitLocker, which also turns off the TPM chip. For example, you might want to turn off BitLocker to 
test the BitLocker recovery process. Normally, BitLocker will manage the TPM chip for you, and there is no 
need for you to manually change TPM chip settings. However, if you are having problems installing BitLocker, 
one thing you can do is clear the TPM chip. Be careful! If the TPM chip is being used to hold an encryption key 
to protect data on the hard drive and you clear the chip, the encryption key will be lost. That means all the data 
will be lost, too. Therefore, don’t clear the TPM chip unless you are certain it is not being used to encrypt data.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know about drive encryption and the TPM chip.
Manage the TPM Chip

Exiting the BIOS Setup Menus
When you finish with BIOS setup, an exit screen such as the one shown in Figure 3-40 gives you various 
options, such as exit and save your changes or exit and discard your changes. Notice in the figure that you 
also have the option to load BIOS default settings. This option can sometimes solve a problem when a user 
has made several inappropriate changes to the BIOS settings.
4.	 Using the console, you can change the TPM owner password, turn TPM on or off, reset the TPM when it has 
locked access to the hard drive, and clear the TPM, which resets it to factory defaults. After you have made 
changes to the TPM chip, you will most likely be asked to restart the computer for the changes to take effect.

All About Motherboards
Using UEFI Setup to Configure a Motherboard
Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI), the original version of UEFI, was first developed by Intel. 
Today, Unified EFI (UEFI) is managed by several manufacturers and developers under the 
Unified EFI Forum (see www.uefi.org). UEFI firmware on the motherboard working with an 
operating system that supports UEFI improves on legacy BIOS in these ways:
	 Faster and better booting. UEFI does a faster and better job of booting the system, handing over the 
boot to the OS, and loading device drivers and applications before the OS loads.
	 Mouse-enabled interface. The mouse-enabled UEFI interface is more user friendly to get information 
about system components; configure the boot sequence, clock speed, virtualization, and power-on 
passwords; and monitor temperature, fan speeds, voltage, and bus speeds.
	 Secure boot. UEFI version 2.3 and higher offers a secure boot, which prevents a system from booting 
up with drivers or an OS that are not digitally signed and trusted by the motherboard or computer 
manufacturer. For secure boot to work, the OS, such as Windows 8 or Linux Ubuntu version 14, must 
support UEFI.
	 Support for hard drives larger than 2 TB. UEFI allows booting from hard drives larger than 2 TB. A 
hard drive uses one of two methods for partitioning the drive: The Master Boot Record (MBR) method 
is older, allows for four partitions and is limited to 2-TB drives. The GUID Partition Table (GPT) 
method is newer, allows for any size hard drive, and, for Windows, can have up to 128 partitions on 
the drive. GPT is required for drives larger than 2 TB or for systems that boot using UEFI firmware.
UEFI allows for backward compatibility. It can boot from a MBR hard drive and provides a BIOS boot 
through its Compatibility Support Module (CSM) feature. CSM is backward compatible with devices and 
drivers that use BIOS.
A+  
220-901

Explore UEFI Setup
Let’s explore a few important UEFI setup screens that you need to be aware of. If you need help using 
UEFI setup, refer to the documentation for the motherboard manufacturer. Here are the steps for one 
system, but your UEFI screens might be different:
Applying  Concepts
A+

1.	 As with BIOS setup, to access the UEFI firmware, press a key, such as F12, F2, or Del, during the 
boot. A UEFI main screen appears. Figure 3-41 shows the main screen for one system, but yours might be 
different. On this screen, you can view information about the CPU and memory and change the language, 
date, or time. You can use your mouse or arrow keys to navigate through menus at the top of the screen 
to view and change information. Use the Ai Tweaker screen to overclock the CPU, the Advanced screen to 
configure the CPU, SATA, USB, onboard devices, power, and network settings, and the Monitor screen to 
monitor temperature, fans, and voltages. On the Boot screen, you can change the boot sequence and other 
boot settings. The Tool screen is used to flash UEFI and BIOS.

compatibility with older BIOS devices and drivers and MBR hard drives. Select Secure Boot to boot using UEFI 
secure boot. For secure boot to work, CSM must be disabled, Windows 8 or another UEFI-aware OS must be 
installed, and the hard drive used for the boot must be partitioned using GPT.

3.	 To manage Secure boot, click Secure Boot. On the next screen, you can select the operating system that will 
be loaded when you have more than one OS installed on the system. To manage the keys used for a Secure 
boot, click Key Management. The screen in Figure 3-43 appears.
4.	 A Secure boot uses the following keys, databases, and drivers, which are stored in flash memory on the 
motherboard and/or on the hard drive and can be managed using commands shown in Figure 3-43:
	The signature database (db) holds a list of digital signatures of approved operating systems, applications, 
and drivers that can be loaded by UEFI. Notice in Figure 3-43, the option to delete the db, load it from a file, 
or append to it.
	The revoked signature database (dbx) is a blacklist of signatures for software that has been revoked and 
is no longer trusted.
	The Key-exchange Key (KEK), also called the Key-enrollment Key (KEK), database is another database that 
holds digital signatures provided by OS manufacturers, such as Microsoft and Red Hat (a Linux manufacturer). 
The OS manufacturer or vendor that owns the keys can update them, which will in turn update the db or dbx. 
For example, an update may occur when a new OS is released or to revoke a bad release of an OS.
	The Platform Key (PK) is a digital signature belonging to the motherboard or computer manufacturer. The 
PK authorizes turning on or off Secure boot and updating the KEK database.
	Option ROMs are UEFI drivers, for example, video, keyboard, and mouse drivers required as the computer 
first boots, that are digitally signed and identified in the signature database.
Just as with BIOS, UEFI loads an OS and drivers at the beginning of the boot and then turns the control of the 
computer over to the OS. When UEFI secure boot is active, it checks the OS and each UEFI driver or application 
before it is loaded to verify it is signed and identified in the secure boot databases. The OS, drivers, and applications 
that are loaded by UEFI are stored in a system partition on the hard drive named efi. After the OS is launched, it can 
load additional drivers and applications that UEFI secure boot does not verify.

Maintaining a Motherboard
3
Now let’s see what other tasks you might need to do when you are responsible for maintaining a 
motherboard.
Maintaining a Motherboard
To maintain a motherboard, you need to know how to update the motherboard drivers, 
flash BIOS or UEFI, and replace the CMOS battery. All these skills are covered in this part 
of the chapter.
A+  
220-901 
1.1
Updating Motherboard Drivers
Device drivers are small programs stored on the hard drive that an operating system, such 
as Windows or Linux, uses to communicate with a specific hardware device, for example, a 
printer, network port on the motherboard, or scanner. The CD or DVD that comes bundled 
with the motherboard contains a user guide and drivers for its onboard components (for 
example, chipset, graphics, audio, network, and USB drivers), and these drivers need to be installed in 
the OS. For a motherboard, after installing the board, you can install the drivers from CD or DVD and 
later update drivers by downloading updates from the motherboard manufacturer’s website. Updates 
are sometimes included in updates to Windows.
A+  
220-901 
1.1, 1.2
If a motherboard or one of its components is giving problems, try downloading and installing updated 
drivers from the motherboard manufacturer website. Figure 3-44 shows the download page for one Asus 
motherboard where you can download drivers and BIOS updates. When you download the drivers using 
the system with the motherboard installed, Asus selects the correct OS, as shown in the figure.
Notes The motherboard CD or DVD or the manufacturer’s website might contain useful utilities, for example, a utility 
to monitor the CPU temperature and alert you if overheating occurs or a diagnostics utility for troubleshooting.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know how to update drivers and firmware and replace the 
CMOS battery.
For normal operation, you would not be required to change secure boot settings unless you want to install hardware 
that is not certified by the OS or computer manufacturer. In this situation, you could disable secure boot, assuming 
the PK allows you to do so. When you disable secure boot, the system is no longer protected from rogue drivers or OS 
installing at the boot. Before you make any changes to the secure boot screen, be sure to use the option to Save Secure 
Boot Keys, which saves all the databases to a USB flash drive so that you can backtrack your changes later if need be.
Notes On laptops and other computers that carry the Windows 8 logo imprinted on the computer, the computer 
manufacturer is required to configure secure boot so that it cannot be disabled, which assures that only certified

If you must download the drivers from a computer that does not have the motherboard installed, be 
sure to select the correct OS (for example, Windows 7) and the correct type (32 bit or 64 bit). Always use 
32-bit drivers with a 32-bit OS and 64-bit drivers with a 64-bit OS. The bit number is the number of bits 
the driver or OS can process at one time, and you want that to match up. To know what edition and type 
of Windows you are using, on the Windows 8 desktop, right-click Start and click System. For Windows 
7/Vista, click Start, right-click Computer, and select Properties. The System window appears, giving you 
details about the Windows installation (see Figure 3-45).

Flashing BIOS
Recall that BIOS includes the BIOS setup program, the startup BIOS that manages the startup 
process, and the system BIOS that manages basic I/O functions of the system. All these programs 
are stored on a firmware chip. The process of upgrading or refreshing the programming stored 
on the firmware chip is called updating the BIOS or flashing BIOS. Here are some good reasons 
you might want to flash the BIOS:
	 The system hangs at odd times or during the boot.
	 Some motherboard functions have stopped working or are giving problems. For example, the onboard 
video port is not working.
	 You want to incorporate some new features or component on the board. For example, a BIOS upgrade 
might be required before you upgrade the processor.
A+  
220-901 
1.1
The BIOS updates are downloaded from the motherboard manufacturer’s website. To flash BIOS, always 
follow the directions that you can find in the user guide for your motherboard. Here are four methods that 
most motherboards can use:
	 Express BIOS update. Some motherboards allow for an express BIOS update, which is done from 
Windows. Download the update file to your hard drive. Close all open applications. Double-click the 
file, which runs the update program, and follow the directions on screen. The system will reboot to 
apply the update.
	 Update from a USB flash drive using BIOS setup. Copy the downloaded update file to a USB flash 
drive. Then restart the system and press a key at startup that launches the BIOS update process. (For 
some motherboard brands, you press F7.) A screen appears where you can select the USB flash drive. 
BIOS finds the update file on the flash drive, completes the update, and restarts the system.
	 Update using a bootable CD. You can download an ISO file from the motherboard manufacturer’s 
website that contains the BIOS update. An ISO file has an .iso file extension and contains an ISO image 
of a CD. You can use an ISO image to create a bootable CD with software and data on it. After you 
have created the bootable CD, boot from it and follow the directions on screen to flash the BIOS.
If the BIOS update is interrupted or the update gives errors, you are in an unfortunate situation. You 
might be able to revert to the earlier version. To do this, generally, you download the recovery file from the 
website and copy the file to a USB flash drive. Then set the jumper on the motherboard to recover from a 
failed BIOS update. Reboot the system and the BIOS automatically reads from the device and performs the 
recovery. Then reset the jumper to the normal setting and boot the system.
Notes To identify the BIOS version installed, look for the BIOS version number displayed on the main menu of BIOS 
setup. Alternately, you can use the System Information utility (msinfo32.exe) in Windows to display the BIOS version.
Notes To use Windows to burn a CD from an ISO file, first insert a blank CD in the optical drive. Then right-click the .iso 
file, select Burn disc image, and follow the directions on screen.
Caution
Be sure you use the correct motherboard brand and model when selecting the BIOS update on the 
manufacturer’s website. Trying to use the wrong update can cause problems.

All About Motherboards
Makers of BIOS code are likely to change BIOS frequently because providing the upgrade on the Internet 
is so easy for them. Generally, however, follow the principle that “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it.” Update 
your BIOS only if you’re having a problem with your motherboard or there’s a new BIOS feature you want 
to use. Also, don’t update the BIOS unless the update is a later version than the one installed. One last 
word of caution: It’s very important the update not be interrupted while it is in progress. A failed update 
can make your motherboard totally unusable. Be sure you don’t interrupt the update, and make sure there 
are no power interruptions. For laptops, make sure the AC adapter is plugged in and powering the system.
Flashing UEFI
UEFI updates are more secure than BIOS updates because they require digital signatures 
for the update to be verified. UEFI firmware, drivers, and databases can be updated by  
way of a USB flash drive or from within Windows. The process using a USB flash drive 
works like this:
1. Follow the motherboard manufacturer’s directions to make the USB drive bootable and download the 
UEFI update files to the drive.
2. If secure boot is enabled, enter UEFI setup and disable secure boot. Also make sure the USB device is 
listed in the boot priority order before the hard drive.
3. For a laptop, plug the AC adapter into an external power source so that the power won’t fail during the update.
4. Reboot the system, this time from the USB flash drive. Follow the manufacturer’s directions to flash 
UEFI. For one manufacturer, you enter the flash command at a command prompt.
5. When prompted, reboot the system. For a secure boot system, go back to UEFI setup and enable secure boot.
Windows updates sometimes include UEFI updates that are handled similarly to driver updates published 
by hardware manufacturers. When Windows receives an update that it recognizes to be a UEFI update, it 
hands off the update to UEFI. On the next reboot, the Windows loader verifies the update against the UEFI 
signature database. If the signature is validated, the update passes to the UEFI firmware. The firmware is 
then responsible for applying the update and displays a screen letting the user know to not disturb the system 
while the update is in progress. After the update is completed, the Windows loader continues loading the OS.

Using Jumpers to Clear BIOS Settings
A motherboard may have jumpers that you can use to clear BIOS/UEFI settings, which returns 
BIOS/UEFI setup to factory default settings. You might want to clear settings when flashing 
BIOS didn’t work or failed to complete correctly or a power-on password is forgotten and you 
cannot boot the system.
A jumper is two small posts or metal pins that stick up on the motherboard, used to hold configuration 
information. An open jumper has no cover, and a closed jumper has a cover on the two pins (see Figure 3-46). 
Look at the jumper cover in Figure 3-46(b) that is “parked,” meaning it is hanging on a single pin for safe-
keeping, but is not being used to turn a jumper setting on.
A+  
220-901 
1.1
Notes If a UEFI update fails to complete, UEFI may reboot and try again up to three times. After the third attempt, 
the update will be discarded and UEFI will roll back a partial update.
Caution
Be very careful that you upgrade BIOS with the correct upgrade and that you follow the manufacturer’s 
instructions correctly. Upgrading with the wrong file could make your system BIOS useless. If you’re not sure that you’re 
using the correct upgrade, don’t guess. Check with the technical support for your BIOS before moving forward. Before you 
call technical support, have the information that identifies your BIOS and motherboard available.

Most motherboards today allow you to set a supervisor password (to make changes in BIOS setup) or 
a power-on password (to get access to the system). Know that these passwords are not the same password 
that can be required by a Windows OS at startup. If both passwords are forgotten, you cannot use the 
computer. However, jumpers can be set to clear both passwords. Also, if flashing BIOS fails, a jumper can 
be set to undo the update.
For example, Figure 3-47 shows a group of three jumpers on one board. (The tan jumper cap is positioned 
on the first two jumper pins on the left side of the group.) Figure 3-48 shows the motherboard documentation 
on how to use these jumpers. When jumpers 1 and 2 are closed, which they are in the figure, normal booting 
happens. When jumpers 2 and 3 are closed, passwords to BIOS setup can be cleared on the next boot. When 
no jumpers are closed, on the next boot, the BIOS will recover itself from a failed update. Once set for normal 
booting, the jumpers should be changed only if you are trying to recover when a power-up password is lost or 
flashing BIOS has failed. To know how to set jumpers, see the motherboard documentation.

Replacing the CMOS Battery
Motherboard settings may be stored in flash memory in the firmware or in CMOS RAM. 
CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) is a method of manufacturing microchips, 
and CMOS RAM is a small amount of memory stored on the motherboard that retains the data 
even when the computer is turned off because it is charged by a nearby lithium coin-cell battery 
(see Figure 3-49). If the CMOS battery is disconnected or fails, setup information is lost. An indication that 
the battery is getting weak is that the system date and time are incorrect after power has been disconnected 
to the PC. A message about a low battery can also appear at startup.
A+  
220-901 
1.2
Figure 3-49  The coin-cell battery powers CMOS RAM when the system  
is turned off and unplugged
The CMOS battery on the motherboard is considered a field replaceable unit. The battery is designed to 
last for years and recharges when the motherboard has power. However, on rare occasions, you might need 
to replace one if the system loses BIOS settings when it is unplugged. Make sure the replacement battery is an 
exact match to the original or is one the motherboard manufacturer recommends for the board. Power down 
the system, unplug it, press the power button to drain the power, and remove the case cover. Use your ESD 
strap to protect the system against ESD. The old battery can be removed with a little prying using a flathead 
screwdriver. The new battery pops into place. For more specific directions, see the motherboard documentation.
Now let’s turn our attention to installing or replacing a motherboard.

Installing or Replacing a Motherboard

Installing or Replacing a Motherboard
A motherboard is considered a field replaceable unit, so you need to know how to replace one 
when it goes bad. In this part of the chapter, you learn how to select a motherboard and then 
how to install or replace one in a desktop or laptop computer.
How to Select a Desktop Motherboard
Because the motherboard determines so many of your computer’s features, selecting the 
motherboard is, in most cases, your most important decision when you purchase a desktop 
computer or assemble one from parts. Depending on which applications and peripheral 
devices you plan to use with the computer, you can take one of three approaches to selecting 
a motherboard. The first approach is to select the board that provides the most room for expansion, so 
you can upgrade and exchange components and add devices easily. A second approach is to select the 
board that best suits the needs of the computer’s current configuration, knowing that when you need to 
upgrade, you will likely switch to new technology and a new motherboard. The third approach is to select 
a motherboard that meets your present needs with moderate room for expansion.
Ask the following questions when selecting a motherboard:
1. What form factor does the motherboard use?
2. Which brand (Intel or AMD) and model processors does the board support? Which chipset does it use? 
How much memory can it hold? What memory speeds does the board support?
3. What type and how many expansion slots are on the board (for example, PCI Express 3.0 or PCI)?
4. How many and what hard drive controllers and connectors are on the board (for example, SATA 
or eSATA)?
5. What are the embedded devices on the board, and what internal slots or connections does the board 
have? (For example, the board might provide a network port, wireless antenna port, FireWire port, two 
or more USB ports, video port, and so forth.)
6. Does the board fit the case you plan to use?
7. What are the price and the warranty on the board? Does the board get good reviews?
8. How extensive and user friendly is the documentation?
9. How much support does the manufacturer supply for the board?
Sometimes a motherboard contains an onboard component more commonly offered as a separate 
device. One example is support for video. The video port might be on the motherboard or might require 
a video card. The cost of a motherboard with an embedded component is usually less than the combined 
cost of a motherboard with no embedded component and an expansion card. If you plan to expand, be 
cautious about choosing a proprietary board that has many embedded components. Often such boards 
do not easily accept add-on devices from other manufacturers. For example, if you plan to add a more 
powerful video card, you might not want to choose a motherboard that contains an onboard video port. 
Even though you can likely disable the video port in UEFI/BIOS setup, there is little advantage to paying 
the extra money for it.

component if needed. Components are disabled in UEFI/BIOS setup.

All About Motherboards
Table 3-5 shown earlier in the chapter lists some manufacturers of motherboards and their web 
addresses. For motherboard reviews, check out www.motherboards.org and www.pcmag.com, or do a 
general search of the web.
How to Install or Replace a Motherboard
When you purchase a motherboard, the package comes with the board, I/O shield, documentation, 
drivers, and various screws, cables, and connectors. When you replace a motherboard, you pretty 
much have to disassemble an entire computer, install the new motherboard, and reassemble the 
system, which you learned to do earlier. The following list is meant to be a general overview 
of the process and is not meant to include the details of all possible installation scenarios, which can vary 
according to the components and case you are using. The best place to go for detailed instructions on installing 
a motherboard is the motherboard user guide.
The general process for replacing a motherboard is as follows:
1. Verify that you have selected the right motherboard to install in the system. The new motherboard 
should have the same form factor as the case, support the RAM modules and processor you want to 
install on it, and have other internal and external connectors you need for your system.
2. Get familiar with the motherboard documentation, features, and settings. Especially important are any 
connectors and jumpers on the motherboard. It’s a great idea to read the motherboard user guide from 
cover to cover. At the least, get familiar with what it has to offer and study the diagrams in it that label 
all the components on the board. Learn how each connector and jumper is used. You can also check the 
manufacturer’s website for answers to any questions you might have.
3. Remove components so you can reach the old motherboard. Use an ESD strap. Turn off the system 
and disconnect all cables and cords. Press the power button to dissipate the power. Open the case 
cover and remove all expansion cards. Disconnect all internal cables and cords connected to the old 
motherboard. To safely remove the old motherboard, you might have to remove drives. If the processor 
cooler is heavy and bulky, you might remove it from the old motherboard before you remove the 
motherboard from the case.
4. Install the I/O shield. The I/O shield is a metal plate that comes with the motherboard and fits over the 
ports to create a well-fitting enclosure for them. A case might come with a standard I/O shield already 
in place. Hold the motherboard up to the shield and make sure the ports on the board will fit the holes in 
the shield (see Figure 3-50). If the holes in the shield don’t match up with the ports on the board, punch 
out the shield and replace it with the one that came bundled with the motherboard.

Caution
As with any installation, remember the importance of using an ESD strap to ground yourself when 
working inside a computer case to protect components against ESD.

5. Install the motherboard. Place the motherboard into the case and, using spacers or screws, securely 
fasten the board to the case. Because coolers are heavy, most processor instructions say to install the 
motherboard before installing the processor and cooler to better protect the board or processor from 
being damaged. On the other hand, some motherboard manufacturers say to install the processor and 
cooler and then install the motherboard. Follow the order given in the motherboard user guide. The 
easiest approach is to install the processor, cooler, and memory modules on the board and then place 
the board in the case (see Figure 3-51).

 6.	 Install the processor and processor cooler. The processor comes already installed on some 
motherboards, in which case you just need to install the cooler. How to install a processor and cooler 
is covered in the chapter, “Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory.”
 7.	 Install RAM into the appropriate slots on the motherboard. How to install RAM is covered in the 
chapter, “Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory.”
 8.	 Attach cabling that goes from the case switches to the motherboard, and from the power supply and 
drives to the motherboard. Pay attention to how cables are labeled and to any information in the 
documentation about where to attach them. The chapter, “First Look at Computer Parts and Tools,” 
can help you identify the types of power connectors. You’ll need to connect the P1 connector, the fan 
connectors, and the processor auxiliary power connector. Position and tie cables neatly together to 
make sure they don’t obstruct the fans and the airflow.
 9.	 Install the video card on the motherboard. This card should go into the primary PCI Express ×16 
slot. If you plan to install multiple video cards, install only one now and check out how the system 
functions before installing the second one.
10. Plug the computer into a power source, and attach the monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Initially install 
only the devices you absolutely need.
11. Boot the system and enter UEFI/BIOS setup. Make sure settings are set to the default. If the 
motherboard comes new from the manufacturer, it will already be at default settings. If you are 
salvaging a motherboard from another system, you might need to reset settings to the default. You 
will need to do the following while you are in UEFI/BIOS setup:
	 Check the time and date.
	 Make sure fast boot (also called abbreviated POST) is disabled. While you’re installing a motherboard, 
you generally want it to do as many diagnostic tests as possible. After you know the system is 
working, you can choose fast boot.
	 Set the boot order to the hard drive, and then the optical drive, if you will be booting the OS from 
the hard drive.
	 Leave everything else at their defaults unless you know that particular settings should be otherwise.
	 Save and exit.
12. Observe POST and verify that no errors occur.
13.	 Verify Windows starts with no errors. If Windows is already installed on the hard drive, boot to 
the Windows desktop. Use Device Manager to verify that the OS recognizes all devices and that no 
conflicts are reported.
14.	 Install the motherboard drivers. If your motherboard comes with a CD that contains some 
motherboard drivers, install them now. You will probably need Internet access so that the setup 
process can download the latest drivers from the motherboard manufacturer’s website. Reboot the 
system one more time, checking for errors.
15.	 Install any other expansion cards and drivers. Install each device and its drivers, one device at a time, 
rebooting and checking for conflicts after each installation.
16.	 Verify that everything is operating properly, and make any final OS and UEFI/BIOS adjustments, 
such as setting power-on passwords.

Replacing a Laptop System Board

Replacing a Laptop System Board
Replacing the system board (motherboard) on a laptop probably means you’ll need to fully 
disassemble the entire laptop except the LCD assembly in the lid. Therefore, before you 
tackle the job, consider alternatives. If available, use diagnostic software from the laptop 
manufacturer to verify that the problem is a failed system board. If a port or component on 
the system board has failed, consider installing an external device rather than replacing the entire board. 
Replacing the system board is a big deal, so consider that the cost of repair, including parts and labor, 
might be more than the laptop is worth. A new laptop might be your best solution.
If you do decide to replace a system board, use a replacement purchased from the laptop manufacturer. 
Here is the general procedure for replacing the system board in one laptop:
1. Remove the keyboard, optical drive, and mini PCIe card.
2. The next step is to remove the laptop lid and keyboard bezel assembly. To do this, first remove two 
screws on the back of the laptop (see Figure 3-52) and the screws on the bottom of the laptop. You can 
then crack the case by lifting the laptop lid and keyboard bezel from the case (see Figure 3-53).

Notes Whenever you install or uninstall software or hardware, keep a notebook with details about the components 
you are working on, configuration settings, manufacturer specifications, and other relevant information. This helps if 
you need to backtrack later and can also help you document and troubleshoot your computer system. Keep all hardware 
documentation for this system together with the notebook in an envelope in a safe place.

Motherboard Types and Features
	The motherboard is the most complicated of all components inside the computer. It contains the 
processor socket and accompanying chipset, firmware holding the UEFI/BIOS, memory slots, expansion 
slots, jumpers, ports, and power supply connections. The motherboard you select determines both the 
capabilities and limitations of your system.
	The most popular motherboard form factors are ATX, microATX, and Mini-ITX.

All About Motherboards
	A motherboard will have one or more Intel sockets for an Intel processor or one or more AMD sockets 
for an AMD processor.
	The chipset embedded on the motherboard determines what kind of processor and memory the board 
can support.
	Major advancements in past Intel chipsets included the Accelerated Hub Architecture (using the North 
Bridge and South Bridge), Nehalem chipsets (using the memory controller on the processor), and Sandy 
Bridge chipsets (using the memory and graphics controller on the processor). All later chipsets use the 
memory and graphics controller in the processor package.
	Buses used on motherboards include conventional PCI, PCI-X, and PCI Express. PCI Express is replacing 
all the other bus types.
	Some components can be built into the motherboard, in which case they are called onboard components. 
Other components can be attached to the system in some other way, such as on an expansion card.
Configuring a Motherboard
	The firmware that controls a motherboard and the boot is the older BIOS or the newer UEFI. Most 
UEFI firmware provides for backward compatibility with BIOS devices.
	Motherboard settings that can be configured using UEFI/BIOS setup include changing the boot priority

ple, power-on passwords and intrusion detection). You can also view information about the installed 
processor, memory, and storage devices and temperatures, fan speeds, and voltages.
Maintaining a Motherboard
	Motherboard drivers might need updating to fix a problem with a board component or to use a new 
feature provided by the motherboard manufacturer.
	To flash BIOS, use a utility program in Windows, a USB flash drive, or a bootable CD.
	To update UEFI, you can boot from a USB flash drive that holds the updates, or Windows can receive an 
update during the normal Windows update process and then pass it on to the UEFI firmware, which 
applies the update.
	Jumpers on the motherboard may be used to clear UEFI/BIOS settings, restoring them to factory default. 
The CMOS battery that powers CMOS RAM might need replacing.
Installing or Replacing a Motherboard
	When selecting a motherboard, pay attention to the form factor, chipset, expansion slots, and memory 
slots used and the processors supported. Also notice the internal and external connectors and ports the 
board provides.
	When installing a motherboard, first study the motherboard and its manual, and set jumpers on the 
board. Sometimes the processor and cooler are best installed before installing the motherboard in the 
case. When the cooling assembly is heavy and bulky, it is best to install it after the motherboard is 
securely seated in the case.
Replacing a Laptop System Board
	For laptops, it’s usually more cost effective to replace the laptop than to replace a failed system board.

Supporting Processors 
and Upgrading Memory
P
reviously, you learned about motherboards. In this chapter, 
you learn about the two most important components on the 
motherboard, which are the processor and memory. You learn how 
a processor works, about the many different types and brands of 
processors, and how to match a processor to the motherboard.
Memory technologies have evolved over the years. When you 
support an assortment of desktop and laptop computers, you’ll be 
amazed at all the different variations of memory modules used not 
only in newer computers, but also in older computers still in use. 
A simple problem of replacing a bad memory module can become 
a complex research project if you don’t have a good grasp of current 
and past memory technologies.
The processor and memory modules are considered field replaceable 
units (FRUs), so you’ll learn how to install and upgrade a processor and 
memory modules. Upgrading the processor or adding more memory to 
a system can sometimes greatly improve performance. How to trouble-
shoot problems with the processor or memory is covered in the chapter, 
“Supporting the Power System and Troubleshooting Computers.”

Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory
Types and Characteristics of Processors
The processor installed on a motherboard is the primary component that determines the 
computing power of the system (see Figure 4-1). Recall that the two major manufacturers of 
processors are Intel (www.intel.com) and AMD (www.amd.com).

Figure 4-1  An AMD Athlon 64 X2 installed in socket AM2+ with cooler not yet installed
In this chapter, you learn a lot of details about processors. As you do, try to keep these nine features of 
processors at the forefront. These features affect performance and compatibility with motherboards:
	Feature 1: Processor speed. The processor frequency is the speed at which the processor operates internally 
and is measured in gigahertz, such as 3.3 GHz. Current Intel and AMD processors run at 1.8 GHz up to 
more than 4.4 GHz.
	Feature 2: Socket and chipset the processor can use. Recall that important Intel sockets for desktop 
systems are the LGA1150, LGA1155, LGA1156, LGA2011, LGA1366, and LGA775. AMD’s important 
desktop sockets are AM3+, AM3, AM2+, AM2, FM1, FM2+, and FM2 sockets.
	Feature 3: Processor architecture (32 bits or 64 bits). All desktop and laptop processors sold today 
from either Intel or AMD are hybrid processors, which can process 64 bits or 32 bits at a time. A hybrid 
processor can use a 32-bit operating system (OS) or a 64-bit OS. Windows 8 and most editions of 
Windows 7 come in either type.
	Feature 4: Multiprocessing abilities. The ability of a system to do more than one thing at a time is 
accomplished by several means:
	Multiprocessing. Two processing units (called arithmetic logic units or ALUs) installed within a 
single processor is called multiprocessing. The Pentium was the first processor that contained two 
ALUs, which means the processor can execute two instructions at the same time.
	Multithreading. Each processor or core processes two threads at the same time. When 
Windows hands off a task to the CPU, it is called a thread and might involve several instructions. 
To handle two threads, the processor requires extra registers, or holding areas, within the processor

housing that it uses to switch between threads. In effect, you have two logical processors for 
each physical processor or core. Intel calls this technology Hyper-Threading and AMD calls it 
HyperTransport. The feature must be enabled in UEFI/BIOS setup and the operating system must 
support the technology.
	Multicore processing. Multiple processors can be installed in the same processor housing (called 
multicore processing). A processor package might contain up to eight cores (dual-core, triple-core, 
quad-core, and so forth). In Figure 4-2, this quad-core processor contains four cores or CPUs. Using 
multithreading, each core can handle two threads. Therefore, the processor appears to have up to 
eight logical processors as it can handle eight threads from the operating system.

core can handle two threads

	Dual processors. A server motherboard 
might have two processor sockets, called 
dual processors or a multiprocessor 
platform (see Figure 4-3). A processor 
(for example, the Xeon processor for 
servers) must support this feature.
	Feature 5: Memory cache, which is the 
amount of memory included within the 
processor package. Today’s processors all 
have some memory on the processor chip 
(called a die). Memory on the processor die 
is called Level 1 cache (L1 cache). Memory 
in the processor package, but not on 
the processor die, is called Level 2 cache (L2 
cache). Some processors use a third cache 
farther from the processor core, but still in 
the processor package, which is called Level 
3 cache (L3 cache). Memory used in a memory cache is static RAM (SRAM; pronounced “S-Ram”). 
Memory used on the motherboard loses data rapidly and must be refreshed often. It is, therefore, called 
volatile memory or dynamic RAM (DRAM; pronounced “D-Ram”). SRAM is faster than DRAM 
because it doesn’t need refreshing; it can hold its data as long as power is available.

Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory
	Feature 6: Security. Execute Disable Bit (EDB) (also called eXecute Disable [XD] by Intel, Enhanced Virus 
Protection by AMD, and disable execute bit by CompTIA) is security built into a processor so that it can 
work with the operating system to designate an area of memory for holding data or instructions. When 
an area is designated for data, instructions stored in this area are not executed, thus preventing a buffer 
overflow attack by malicious software, which attempts to run its code from an area of memory assigned 
to another program for its data. EDB requires a compatible OS. You can enable EDB using the BIOS or 
UEFI setup screen (see Figure 4-4). It is important to remember that even though EDB can stop malware 
from executing, it cannot remove it. You still need to use anti-malware software to remove the malware.
	Feature 7: The memory features on the motherboard that the processor can support. DRAM memory 
modules that might be used on a motherboard include DDR, DDR2, DDR3, or DDR4. Besides the 
type of memory, a processor can support certain amounts of memory, memory speeds, and number 
of memory channels (single, dual, triple, or quad channels). All these characteristics of memory are 
discussed later in the chapter.
	Feature 8: Support for virtualization. A computer can use software to create and manage multiple 
virtual machines and their virtual devices. Most processors sold today support virtualization, and the 
feature must be enabled in UEFI/BIOS setup.
	Feature 9: Integrated graphics. A processor might include an integrated GPU. A graphics processing 
unit (GPU) is a processor that manipulates graphic data to form the images on a monitor screen. The 
GPU might be on a video card, on the motherboard, or embedded in the CPU package. When inside 
the CPU package, it is called integrated graphics. Many AMD processors and all the Intel second  
generation and higher processors have integrated graphics.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to be familiar with the characteristics of processors. Know the 
purposes and characteristics of Hyper-Threading, core processing, types of cache, virtualization, integrated GPU, disable 
execute bit (CompTIA’s name for EDB), and 32-bit versus 64-bit processing.
Let’s now turn our attention to a discussion of how a processor works, including several of the processor 
features just listed. Then you’ll learn about the families of Intel and AMD processors.

How a Processor Works
Although processors continue to evolve, they all have some common elements. These elements 
are diagrammed in Figure 4-5 for the Pentium processor. The Pentium made several major 
advances in processor technologies when it was first introduced. Because of its historical 
significance and the foundation it created for today’s processors, it’s a great place to start 
when learning how a processor works.

Figure 4-5  Since the Pentium processor was first released in 1993, the 
standard has been for a processor core to have two arithmetic 
logic units so that it can process two instructions at once
A processor contains these basic components diagrammed in Figure 4-5 for the Pentium processor:
	An input/output (I/O) unit manages data and instructions entering and leaving the processor.
	A control unit manages all activities inside the processor itself.
	One or more arithmetic logic units (ALUs) do all logical comparisons and calculations inside the 
processor. All desktop and laptop processors sold today contain two ALUs in each processor core within 
the processor package.
	Registers, which are small holding areas on the processor chip, work much like RAM does outside the 
processor to hold counters, data, instructions, and addresses that the ALU is currently processing.
	Internal memory caches (L1, L2, and possibly L3 or L4) hold data and instructions waiting to be 
processed by the ALU.
	Buses inside the processor connect components within the processor housing. These buses run at a much 
higher frequency than the motherboard buses that connect the processor to the chipset and memory on 
the motherboard.
If the processor operates at 3.2 GHz internally and the Front Side Bus is operating at 800 MHz, the 
processor operates at four times the FSB speed. This factor is called the multiplier. As you learned in 
the chapter, “All About Motherboards,” you can view the actual processor frequency and the clock speed 
using the UEFI/BIOS setup screens. You can also change the multiplier or the clock speed in order to 
overclock or throttle the processor.
In Figure 4-5, you can see the internal data bus for the Pentium was only 32 bits wide. More important, 
however, than the width of the internal bus is the fact that each ALU and register in the early Pentiums 
could process only 32 bits at a time. All desktop and laptop processors sold today from either Intel or AMD 
contain ALUs and registers that can process 32 bits or 64 bits at a time. To know which type of operating

Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory
system to install, you need to be aware of three categories of processors currently used on desktop and 
laptop computers:
	32-bit processors. These older processors are known as x86 processors because Intel used the number 
86 in the model number of these processors. If you are ever called on to install Windows on one of 
these old Pentium computers, you must use a 32-bit version of Windows. These processors can handle 
only 32-bit instructions from the OS.
	Processors that can process 32 bits or 64 bits. These hybrid processors are known as x86-64 bit 
processors. AMD was the first to produce one (the Athlon 64) and called the technology AMD64. Intel 
followed with a version of its Pentium 4 processors and called the technology Extended Memory 64 
Technology (EM64T). Because of their hybrid nature, these processors can handle a 32-bit OS or a 
64-bit OS. All desktop or laptop processors made after 2007 are of this type.
	64-bit processors. Intel makes several 64-bit processors for workstations or servers that use fully 
implemented 64-bit processing, including the Itanium and Xeon processors. Intel calls the technology 
IA64, but they are also called x64 processors. They require a 64-bit operating system and can handle 
32-bit applications only by simulating 32-bit processing.
Each core in a processor has its own cache and can also share a cache. Figure 4-6 shows how  
quad-core processing can work if the processor uses an L3 cache and an internal memory controller. 
Each core within a processor has its own independent internal L1 and L2 caches. The L1 cache is on the 
die and the L2 cache is off the die. In addition, all the cores might share an L3 cache within the processor 
package. Recall that prior to the memory controller being in the processor package, it was part of the 
North Bridge chipset. Putting the controller inside the processor package resulted in a significant increase 
in system performance.
Intel Processors
Intel’s current families of processors 
for the desktop include the Core, 
Atom, Celeron, and Pentium families 
of processors. In addition, Intel 
groups its processors into Sixth Generation, Fifth 
Generation, Fourth Generation, Third Generation, 
Second Generation, and Previous Generation 
processors. Each generation improves on how the 
processor and chipset are integrated in the system. 
Processors in each family are listed in Table 4-1. 
Some significant retired processors are also listed. 
Later in the chapter, you’ll learn about the memory 
technologies mentioned in the table.

An Intel Sandy Bridge Core i5 processor is shown in Figure 4-7. You can purchase a processor with 
or without the cooler. When it’s purchased with a cooler, it’s called a boxed processor. The cooler is also 
shown in the photo. If you purchase the cooler separately, make sure it fits the socket you are using.

Types and Characteristics of Processors
4
Some of the Intel mobile processors are packaged in the Centrino processor technology. Using the 
Centrino technology, the Intel processor, chipset, and wireless network adapter are all interconnected 
as a unit, which improves laptop performance. Several Intel mobile processors have been packaged as a 
Centrino processor. You also need to be aware of the Intel Atom processor, which is Intel’s low-powered 
processor and is used in low-cost desktops, laptops, and netbooks.
AMD Processors
Processors by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD (www.amd.com) are popular in 
the game and hobbyist markets, and are generally less expensive than comparable Intel 
processors. Recall that AMD processors use different sockets than do Intel processors, so the 
motherboard must be designed for one manufacturer’s processor or the other, but not both. 
Many motherboard manufacturers offer two comparable motherboards—one for an Intel processor and 
one for an AMD processor.
The current AMD processor families are the FX, Phenom, Athlon, Sempron, A Series, and E Series for 
desktops and the Athlon, Turion, V Series, Phenom, and Sempron for laptops. Table 4-2 lists the current 
AMD processors for desktops. Figure 4-9 shows an FX processor by AMD.

Select a Processor to Match System Needs
When selecting a processor, the first requirement is to select one that the motherboard is 
designed to support. Among the processors the board supports, you need to select the best 
one that meets the general requirements of the system and the user’s needs. To get the best 
performance, use the highest-performing processor the board supports. However, sometimes 
you need to sacrifice performance for cost.

In the next part of the chapter, you learn the 
detailed steps to select and install a processor 
in several of the popular Intel and AMD 
sockets used by desktop computers.
Selecting and Installing 
a Processor
A hardware technician is 
sometimes called on to assemble 
a desktop computer from parts, 
exchange a processor that is faulty, 
add a second processor to a dual-processor 
system, or upgrade an existing processor to 
improve performance. In each situation, it is 
necessary to know how to match a processor 
for the system in which it is installed. And then 
you need to know how to install the processor 
on the motherboard for each of the current 
Intel and AMD sockets used for desktop and 
laptop systems. In this part of the chapter, you 
learn about selecting and installing processors in desktops. Later in the chapter, you learn about selecting 
and installing processors in laptops.

The cooler is bracketed to the motherboard using a wire or plastic clip. A creamlike thermal compound 
is placed between the bottom of the cooler heat sink and the top of the processor. This compound 
eliminates air pockets, helping to draw heat off the processor. The thermal compound transmits heat 
better than air and makes an airtight 
connection between the fan and the 
processor. When processors and coolers 
are boxed together, the cooler heat sink 
might have thermal compound already 
stuck to the bottom (see Figure 4-10).
Select a Processor
Your friend, Alice, is working toward her A+ certification. She has decided the best way to get the experience she 
needs before she sits for the exam is to build a system from scratch. She has purchased an Asus motherboard and 
asked you for some help selecting the right processor. She tells you that the system will later be used for light 
business needs and she wants to install a processor that is moderate in price to fit her budget. She says she doesn’t 
want to install the most expensive processor the motherboard can support, but neither does she want to sacrifice 
too much performance or power.
The documentation on the Asus website (support.asus.com) for the ASUS H81M-C motherboard gives this information:
	 The microATX board contains the H81 chipset and socket LGA1150 and uses DDR3 memory.
	 CPUs supported include a long list of Fourth-Generation Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 processors and Celeron 
and Pentium processors. Here are five processors found in this list:
	 Intel Core i7-4790, 3.6 GHz, 8-MB cache
	 Intel Core i5-4590, 3.3 GHz, 6-MB cache
	 Intel Core i3-4350, 3.6 GHz, 4-MB cache
	 Intel Celeron G1850, 2.9 GHz, 2-MB cache
	 Intel Pentium G3260, 3.3 GHz, 3-MB cache
Based on what Alice has told you, you decide to eliminate the most expensive processors (the Core i7) and the  
least-performing processors (the Celerons and Pentiums). That decision narrows your choices down to the Core i3 
and Core i5. Before you select one of these processors, you need to check the list on the Asus site to make sure the 
specific Core i3 or Core i5 processor is in the list. Look for the exact processor number, for example, the Core i3-4350. 
Also double-check and make sure the processor uses the correct socket and is a Fourth-Generation processor.
You will also need a cooler assembly. If your processor doesn’t come boxed with a cooler, select a cooler that fits the 
processor socket and gets good reviews. You’ll also need some thermal compound if it is not included with the cooler.

Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory
When building a new system, if the motherboard is not already installed in the case, follow the 
directions of the motherboard manufacturer to install the motherboard and then the processor or to install 
the processor and then the motherboard. The order of installation varies among manufacturers. When 
replacing a processor in an existing system, power down the system, unplug the power cord, press the 
power button to drain the system of power, and open the case. Follow these steps to install the processor 
and cooler using socket LGA1150:
1. Read all directions in the motherboard user guide about installing the processor and carefully follow 
them in order.
2. Use an ESD strap or antistatic gloves to protect the processor, motherboard, and other components 
against ESD.
3. Remove the socket protective cover. Keep this cover in a safe place. If you ever remove the processor, 
put the cover back on the socket to protect the socket. While the socket is exposed as in Figure 4-12, 
be very careful to not touch the pins in the socket.
Install a Processor
Now let’s look at the details of installing a processor in Intel LGA1150, LGA1155, LGA1366, 
LGA775, and AMD AM2+ sockets.

5. Remove the clear plastic protective cover from the processor. While the processor contacts are exposed, 
take extreme care to not touch the bottom of the processor. Hold it only at its edges. (It’s best to 
use antistatic gloves as you work, but the gloves make it difficult to handle the processor.) Put the 
processor cover in a safe place and use it to protect the processor if you ever remove the processor 
from the socket.
6. Hold the processor with your index finger and thumb and orient the processor so that the two notches 
on the edge of the processor line up with the posts embedded on the socket. Gently lower the processor 
straight down into the socket. Don’t allow the processor to tilt, slide, or shift as you put it in the socket. 
To protect the pads, it needs to go straight down into the socket.
7. Check carefully to make sure the processor is aligned correctly in the socket. Closing the socket without 
the processor fully seated can destroy the socket. Figure 4-14 shows the processor fully seated in the 
socket. Close the socket load plate so that it catches under the screw head at the front of the socket.

8. Push down on the lever and gently return it to its locked position.
We are now ready to install the cooler. Before installing a cooler, read the directions carefully and make 
sure you understand them. Clips that hold the fan and heat sink to the processor frame or housing are 
sometimes difficult to install. The directions might give you important tips. Follow these general steps:
1. The motherboard has four holes to anchor the cooler. You can see them labeled in Figure 4-15. 
Examine the cooler posts that fit over these holes and the clips, screws, or wires that will hold 
the cooler firmly in place. Make sure you understand how this mechanism works.
2. If the cooler has thermal compound preapplied, remove the plastic from the compound. If the cooler 
does not have thermal compound applied, put a small dot of compound (about the size of a small 
pea) in the center of the processor (see Figure 4-15). When the cooler is attached and the processor

is running, the compound spreads over the surface. Don’t use too much—just enough to later create 
a thin layer. If you use too much compound, it can slide off the housing and damage the processor or 
circuits on the motherboard. To get just the right amount, you can buy individual packets that each 
contain a single application of the thermal compound.
3. Verify the locking pins on the cooler are turned as far as they will go in a counterclockwise direction. 
(Make sure the pins don’t protrude into the hollow plastic posts that go down into the motherboard 
holes.) Align the cooler over the processor so that all four posts fit into the four holes on the 
motherboard and the fan power cord can reach the fan header on the motherboard.
4. Push down on each locking pin until you hear it pop into the hole. To help keep the cooler balanced 
and in position, push down two opposite pins and then push the remaining two pins in place. Using 
a flathead screwdriver, turn the locking pin clockwise to secure it (see Figure 4-16). (Later, if you need 
to remove the cooler, turn each locking pin counterclockwise to release it from the hole.)
Notes When removing and reinstalling a processor, use a soft dry cloth to carefully remove all the old thermal 
compound from both the processor and the cooler. Don’t try to reuse the compound.

5. Connect the power cord from the cooler fan to the 4-pin CPU fan header on the motherboard near the 
processor, as shown in Figure 4-17.
Figure 4-17  Connect the cooler fan power cord to the motherboard CPU fan header
After the processor and cooler are installed and the motherboard is installed in the case, make sure 
cables and cords don’t obstruct fans or airflow, especially airflow around the processor and video card. 
Use cable ties to tie cords and cables up and out of the way.
Make one last check to verify that all power connectors are in place and other cords and cables 
connected to the motherboard are correctly done. You are now ready to plug back up the system, turn 
it on, and verify all is working. If the power comes on (you hear the fan spinning and see lights), but the 
system fails to work, most likely the processor is not seated solidly in the socket or some power cord has 
not yet been connected or is not solidly connected. Turn everything off, unplug the power cord, press the 
power button to drain power, open the case, and recheck your installation. If the system comes up and 
begins the boot process, but suddenly turns off before the boot is complete, most likely the processor 
is overheating because the cooler is not installed correctly. Turn everything off, unplug the power cord, 
press the power button to drain power, open the case, and verify that the cooler is securely seated and 
connected.
After the system is up and running, you can check UEFI/BIOS setup to verify that the system recognized 
the processor correctly. The setup screen for one processor is shown in Figure 4-18.
Also check in UEFI/BIOS setup the CPU and motherboard temperatures to verify the CPU is not overheating. 
For the UEFI setup in this system, this screen is under the Monitor menu, as shown in Figure 4-19.
Notes If you later notice the CPU fan is running far too often, you might need to tighten the connection between 
the cooler and the processor.

the processor will stop execution if the temperature rises above 130 degrees. If you see the temperature 
rising this high, open the case cover and verify that the processor fan is running. Perhaps a wire is in the 
way and preventing the fan from turning or the fan wire is not connected. Other troubleshooting tips for 
processors are covered in the chapter, “Supporting the Power System and Troubleshooting Computers.”

Installing an Intel Processor in Socket LGA1155
The installations of all processors and sockets in this part of the chapter are similar to that of installing 
a processor in Socket LGA1150, so we will not repeat many of those steps. Listed next are the differences 
when installing a processor in the LGA1155 socket. These socket pins are delicate, so work slowly and 
take care. Here is how to work with this socket:
1. Open the socket by pushing down on the socket lever and gently pushing it away from the socket to 
lift the lever (see Figure 4-20). You can then lift the socket load plate, as shown in Figure 4-21. Next, 
remove the socket protective cover.
2. To install the processor, hold the processor with your index finger and thumb and orient the processor 
so that the gold triangle on the corner of the processor lines up with the right-angle mark embedded 
on the motherboard just outside a corner of the socket (see Figure 4-22). Gently lower the processor 
straight down into the socket. Don’t allow the processor to tilt, slide, or shift as you put it in the socket. 
To protect the pads, it needs to go straight down into the socket.

2. To install the processor, hold the processor with your index finger and thumb and orient the processor 
so that the notches on the two edges of the processor line up with the two posts on the socket. You 
can see the notch and post on the right side of the processor and socket in Figure 4-25. Gently lower 
the processor straight down into the socket. Don’t allow the processor to tilt, slide, or shift as you put 
it in the socket. To protect the pins, it needs to go straight down into the socket.

Installing an Intel Processor in Socket LGA775
Socket LGA775 is shown in Figure 4-26 along with a Pentium processor and cooler. In the photo, the 
socket is open and the protective cover removed. The processor is lying upside down in front of the cooler.
When installing a processor in socket LGA775, do the following:
1. Push down on the lever and gently push it away from the socket to lift it. Lift the socket load plate. 
Remove the socket protective cover.
2. Orient the processor so that 
the notches on the two edges of 
the processor line up with the 
two notches on the socket. Gently 
place the processor in the socket. 
Socket LGA775 doesn’t have those 
delicate pins that Socket LGA1366 
has, but you still need to be careful 
to not touch the top of the socket 
or the bottom of the processor as 
you work.
3. Close the socket cover. Push down 
on the lever and gently return it to 
its locked position.

Installing an AMD Processor in Socket AM2+
When installing an AMD processor in AMD socket AM2, AM2+, or other AMD sockets, do the following:
1. Open the socket lever. If there’s a protective cover over the socket, remove it.
2. Holding the processor very carefully so you don’t touch the bottom, orient the four empty positions 
on the bottom with the four empty positions in the socket (see Figure 4-27). For some AMD sockets, a 
gold triangle on one corner of the processor matches up with a small triangle on a corner of the socket. 
Carefully lower the processor into the socket. Don’t allow it to tilt or slide as it goes into the socket. The 
pins on the bottom of the processor are very delicate, so take care as you work.

3. Check carefully to make sure the pins in the processor are sitting slightly into the holes. Make sure the 
pins are not offset from the holes. If you try to use the lever to put pressure on these pins and they are 
not aligned correctly, you can destroy the processor. You can actually feel the pins settle into place when 
you’re lowering the processor into the socket correctly.
4. Press the lever down and gently into position (see Figure 4-28).

5. You are now ready to apply the thermal compound and install the cooler assembly. For one system, 
the black retention mechanism for the cooler is already installed on the motherboard (see Figure 4-29). 
Set the cooler on top of the processor, aligning it inside the retention mechanism.

Research a Processor Upgrade or Replacement
To identify your motherboard and find out the processor and processor socket a motherboard is currently using, you can 
use UEFI/BIOS setup, Windows utilities, or third-party software such as Speccy at www.periform.com/speccy. To research 
processors a board can support, you can use the motherboard user guide, the website of the motherboard manufacturer, 
and for Intel processors, the Intel site at ark.intel.com. Research the current processor and processor socket of your 
computer’s motherboard and which processors your board can support, and answer the following questions:
1.	 What is the brand and model of your motherboard? What processor socket does it use? How did you find your 
information?
2.	 Identify the currently installed processor, including its brand, model, speed, and other important 
characteristics. How did you find your information?
3.	 List three or more processors the board supports according to the motherboard documentation or website.
4.	 Search the web for three or more processors that would match this board. Save or print three webpages 
showing the details and prices of a high-performing, moderately performing, and low-performing processor 
the board supports.
5.	 If your current processor fails, which processor would you recommend for this system? Explain your 
recommendation.
Now assume the Core i7 920 processor that you saw installed in Figure 4-25 has gone bad. The motherboard 
in which it is installed is the Intel DX58SO desktop board. The owner of the motherboard has requested that you 
keep the replacement cost as low as possible. What processor would you recommend for the replacement? Save 
or print a webpage showing the processor and its cost.
Hands-On  Project 4-1
Insert and Remove a Processor
In this project, you remove and install a processor. As you work, be very careful to not bend pins on the processor 
or socket, and protect the processor and motherboard against ESD. Do the following:
1.	 Verify the computer is working. Turn off the system, unplug it, press the power button, and open the 
computer case. Put on your ESD strap. Remove the cooler assembly. Remove all the thermal compound from 
the cooler and processor.
2.	 Reinstall the processor and thermal compound. Have your instructor check the thermal compound. Install 
the cooler.
3.	 Replace the case cover, power up the system, and verify all is working.
Hands-On  Project 4-2
Replacing the Processor in a Laptop
Before replacing the processor in a laptop, consider the laptop might still be under warranty. 
Also consider it might be more cost effective to replace the laptop rather than replacing the 
processor, including the cost of parts and labor. If you do decide to replace a processor in a 
laptop, be sure to select a processor supported by the laptop manufacturer for the particular 
model laptop. The range of processors supported by a laptop does not usually include as many options 
as those supported by a desktop motherboard.

For many laptops, removing the cover on the bottom of a laptop exposes the processor fan and heat sink 
assembly. When you remove this assembly, you can then open the socket and remove the processor. For 
example, looking at the laptop shown in Figure 4-31, you can see the processor heat sink and fan assembly 
exposed. To remove the assembly, remove the seven screws and the fan power connector (see Figure 4-32). 
Then lift the assembly straight up, being careful not to damage the processor underneath.

For another laptop, the heat sink and fan 
assembly is also exposed when you remove 
the cover on the bottom of the laptop (see 
Figure 4-33). Notice the heat sink on this laptop 
extends to the processor and chipset. You remove 
several screws and then lift the entire assembly out 
as a unit. For both laptops, the heat sink fits on top 
of the processor and the fan sits to the side of the 
processor. This design is typical of many laptops. 
However, some laptops require you to remove the 
keyboard and the keyboard bezel to reach the fan 
assembly and processor under the bezel.

Notice the thermal compound on the processor. To remove the processor, turn the CPU socket screw 
90 degrees to open the socket, as shown in the figure. Most Intel and AMD sockets have this socket 
screw on the side of the socket, as shown in Figure 4-34, although other sockets have the screw on 
the  corner of the socket.

of the processor and socket. This corner is used to correctly orient the processor in the socket, which is 
socket 478B.
Before you place the new processor into the socket, be sure the socket screw is in the open position. Then 
delicately place the processor into its socket. If it does not drop in completely, consider that the screw might 
not be in the full open position. Be sure to use thermal compound on top of the processor. Intel recommends

Now let’s turn our attention to the various memory technologies used in personal computers, and how 
to upgrade memory.
Memory Technologies
Recall that random access memory (RAM) temporarily holds data and instructions as the 
CPU processes them and that the memory modules used on a motherboard are made of 
dynamic RAM or DRAM. DRAM loses its data rapidly, and the memory controller must 
refresh it several thousand times a second. RAM is stored on memory modules, which are 
installed in memory slots on the motherboard (see Figure 4-36).

Memory Technologies
4
Several variations of DRAM have evolved over the years. Here are the four major categories of memory modules:
	 All new motherboards for desktops sold today use a type of memory module called a DIMM 
(dual inline memory module).
	 Laptops use a smaller version of a DIMM called a SO-DIMM (small outline DIMM and pronounced 
“sew-dim”). MicroDIMMs are used on subnotebook computers and are smaller than SO-DIMMs.
	 An older type of module is a RIMM, which is designed by Rambus, Inc.
	 Really old computers used SIMMs (single inline memory modules). You’re unlikely to ever see these 
modules in working computers.
The major differences among these modules are the width of the data path that each type of module 
accommodates and the way data moves from the system bus to the module. DIMMs have seen several 
evolutions. Five versions of DIMMs, one RIMM, and two types of SIMMs are shown in Table 4-3. Notice 
the notches on the modules, which prevent the wrong type of module from being inserted into a memory 
slot on the motherboard. The table includes older and current memory technologies.
Description of Module
Example
288-pin DDR4 DIMM is currently the fastest memory with 
lower voltage requirements. It can support quad or dual 
channels or function as single DIMMs. It has one notch near 
the center of the edge connector.
240-pin DDR3 DIMM can support quad, triple, or dual channels 
or function as single DIMMs. It has an offset notch farther 
from the center than a DDR2 DIMM.
240-pin DDR2 DIMM can support dual channels or function 
as single DIMMs. It has one notch near the center of the 
edge connector.
184-pin DDR DIMM can support dual channels or function as 
a single DIMM. It has one offset notch.
168-pin SDRAM DIMM has two notches on the module. The 
positions of these notches depend on the memory features 
the DIMM uses.
RIMM has 184 pins and two notches near the center of the 
edge connector.
72-pin SIMMs were installed in groups of two modules to 
each bank of memory.
30-pin SIMMs were installed in groups of four modules  
to each bank of memory.

Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory
In this chapter, you see tons of different technologies used by RAM and so many can get a little 
overwhelming. You need to know about them because each motherboard you might support requires a 
specific type of RAM. Figure 4-37 is designed to help you keep all these technologies straight. You might 
find it a useful road map as you study each technology in the chapter. And who keeps up with all these 
technologies? JEDEC (www.jedec.org) is the organization responsible for standards used by solid-state 
devices, including RAM technologies. The goal of each new RAM technology approved by JEDEC is to 
increase speed and performance without greatly increasing the cost.
Even though an older RAM technology is no longer used by new motherboards, RAM manufacturers 
continue to produce the older RAM because older motherboards require these replacement modules. 
In Figure 4-37, the dotted lines for SIMMs and RIMMs indicate these technologies are now obsolete. 
All new motherboards today use DIMMs. However, if you check some retail websites, you can see that 
RIMMs can still be purchased.

We’ll now look at each of the types of DIMM and SO-DIMM modules and the technologies they use.
DIMM Technologies
DIMMs use a 64-bit data path. (Some early DIMMs had a 128-bit data path, but they’re now 
obsolete.) A DIMM (dual inline memory module) gets its name because it has independent pins 
on opposite sides of the module.
Early DIMMs did not run in sync with the system clock because they were too slow to keep up. Their 
speeds are measured in nanoseconds (ns), which is how long it takes for the module to read or write data. 
The first DIMM to run synchronized with the system clock was synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), which 
has two notches, and uses 168 pins. (Don’t confuse SDRAM with SRAM. SRAM is static RAM used in 
processor memory caches, and SDRAM is dynamic RAM used on DIMMs.) Synchronized memory runs 
in step with the processor and system clock, and its speeds are measured just as processor and bus speeds 
are measured in MHz.
Double Data Rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM, or SDRAM II, or simply DDR) is an improved version 
of SDRAM. DDR runs twice as fast as regular SDRAM, has one notch, and uses 184 pins. Instead of

processing data for each beat of the system clock, as regular SDRAM does, it processes data when the 
beat rises and again when it falls, doubling the data rate of memory. If a motherboard runs at 200 MHz, 
DDR memory runs at 400 MHz. Three other improvements over DDR are DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4. 
DDR2 is faster and uses less power than DDR. DDR3 is faster and uses less power than DDR2. The 
trend continues with DDR4 being faster and using less power than DDR3. Both DDR2 and DDR3 use 
240 pins. They are not compatible because their notches are not in the same position, and the different 
notch positions keep someone from installing a DDR2 or DDR3 DIMM in the wrong memory slot. 
DDR4 uses 288 pins.
Factors that affect the capacity, features, and performance of DIMMs include the number of channels 
they use, how much RAM is on one DIMM, the speed, error-checking abilities, and buffering. All these 
factors are discussed next.
Single, Dual, Triple, and Quad Channels
When you look at a motherboard, you might notice the DIMM slots are different colors. This color 
coding is used to identify the channel each slot uses. Channels have to do with how many DIMM slots 
the memory controller can address at a time. Early DIMMs only used a single channel, which means the 
memory controller can access only one DIMM at a time. To improve overall memory performance, dual 
channels allow the memory controller to communicate with two DIMMs at the same time, effectively 
doubling the speed of memory access. A motherboard that supports triple channels can access three 
DIMMs at the same time. Sandy Bridge technology introduced quad channels where the processor can 
access four DIMMs at the same time. DDR, DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4 DIMMs can use dual channels. 
DDR3 DIMMs can also use triple channels. DDR3 and DDR4 DIMMs can use quad channels. For dual, 
triple, or quad channels to work, the motherboard and the DIMM must support the technology.
Figure 4-38 shows how dual channeling works on a board with four DIMM slots. The board has two 
memory channels, Channel A and Channel B. With dual channeling, the two DIMMs installed in the two 
slots labeled Channel A can be addressed at the same time. If two more DIMMs are installed in the Channel 
B slots, they can be accessed at the same time.
Figure 4-38  Using dual channels, the memory controller can read from two DIMMs at the 
same time

When setting up dual channeling, know that the pair of DIMMs in a channel must be equally matched 
in size, speed, and features, and it is recommended they come from the same manufacturer. A motherboard 
supporting dual channels was shown in Figure 4-36. The two black DIMM slots make up the first channel, 
and the two blue slots make up the second channel. To use dual channeling, matching DIMMs must be 
installed in the black slots and another matching pair in the blue slots, as shown in Figure 4-39. Know that 
the second pair of DIMMs does not have to match the first pair of DIMMs because the first channel runs 
independently of the second channel. If the two DIMM slots of a channel are not populated with matching 
pairs of DIMMs, the motherboard will revert to single channeling.

Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory
For a triple-channel installation, three DIMM slots must be populated with three matching DDR3 DIMMs 
(see Figure 4-40). The three DIMMs are installed in the three blue slots on the board. This motherboard has 
a fourth black DIMM slot. You can barely see this black slot behind the three filled slots in the photo. If the 
fourth slot is used, then triple channeling is disabled, which can slow down performance. If a matching pair 
of DIMMs is installed in the first two slots and another matching pair of DIMMs is installed in the third 
and fourth slots, then the memory controller will use dual channels. Dual channels are not as fast as triple 
channels, but certainly better than single channels.
Figure 4-40  Three identical DDR3 DIMMs installed in a triple-channel configuration

The latest memory technology is quad channeling that was introduced with Intel Sandy Bridge chipsets 
and processors. Figure 4-41 shows an Intel motherboard that has the LGA2011 socket and eight memory 
slots. The processor can access four slots at the same time. The four black slots can be addressed by the 
processor on one memory channel and the four blue slots on another channel. Second Generation Sandy 
Bridge and later processors contain the memory controller within the processor package rather than on 
the chipset. To get the highest performance, memory slots are placed on either side of the processor in 
order to shorten the length of the memory bus. Because of the high performance of processors that use 
the LGA2011 socket, Intel recommends that systems using this socket use liquid cooling methods.

DIMM Speeds
DIMM speeds are measured either in MHz (such as 1333 MHz or 800 MHz) or PC rating (such as PC6400). 
A PC rating is a measure of the total bandwidth in MB/second of data moving between the module and the 
CPU. To calculate the PC rating for a DDR DIMM, multiply the speed by 8 bytes because a DIMM has an 
8-byte or 64-bit data path. For example, a DDR DIMM that runs at 800 MHz has a bandwidth or transfer 
rate of 800×8 or 6400 MB/second, which is expressed as a PC rating of PC6400. A DDR2 PC rating is 
usually labeled PC2, a DDR3 PC rating is labeled PC3, and a DDR4 PC rating is labeled PC4. In Figure 4-42, 
this memory ad shows the PC rating and lists speed as the DDR rate. Table 4-4 lists some current PC ratings.

Single-Sided and Double-Sided DIMMs
A DIMM can have memory chips installed on one side of the module (called single-sided) or both sides 
of the module (called double-sided). Most desktop and laptop processors address memory 64 bits at a 
time. A memory bank is the memory a processor addresses at one time and is 64 bits wide, and a DIMM 
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to be able to calculate PC ratings, given the transfers per sec-
ond. To get the PC rating, multiply the transfers per second by eight. To get the speed, divide the PC rating by eight.

slot provides a 64-bit data path. However, some double-sided DIMMs provide more than one bank, which 
means the chips on the DIMM are grouped so that the memory controller addresses one group and then 
addresses another. These DIMMs are said to be dual ranked, and don’t perform as well as DIMMs where 
all the memory is addressed at one time. Figure 4-43 shows some examples of DDR dual-ranked memory 
modules used in servers.

Error Checking and Parity
Because DIMMs intended to be used in servers must be extremely reliable, error-checking technology 
called ECC (error-correcting code) is sometimes used. The memory modules shown in Figure 4-43 are ECC 
memory. Some DDR, DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4 memory modules support ECC. A DIMM normally has 
an even number of chips on the module, but a DIMM that supports ECC has an odd number of chips on

the module. The odd extra chip is the ECC chip. ECC compares bits written to the module to what is later 
read from the module, and it can detect and correct an error in a single bit of the byte. If there are errors 
in 2 bits of a byte, ECC can detect the error but cannot correct it. The data path width for DIMMs is 
normally 64 bits, but with ECC, the data path is 72 bits. The extra 8 bits are used for error checking. ECC 
memory costs more than non-ECC memory, but it is more reliable. For ECC to work, the motherboard and 
all installed modules must support it. Also, it’s important to know that you cannot install a mix of ECC 
and non-ECC memory on the motherboard because such a mixture causes the system to not work.
As with most other memory technologies discussed in this chapter, when buying memory to add to 
a motherboard, match the type of memory to the type the board supports. To see if your motherboard 
supports ECC memory, look for the ability to enable or disable the feature in UEFI/BIOS setup, or check 
the motherboard documentation.
Older SIMMs used an error-checking technology called parity. Using parity checking, a ninth bit is 
stored with every 8 bits in a byte. If memory is using odd parity, it makes the ninth or parity bit either  
a 1 or a 0, to make the number of 1s in the nine bits odd. If it uses even parity, it makes the parity bit a 1 
or a 0 to make the number of 1s in the 9 bits even.
Figure 4-44  A SIMM appears in a memory ad as EDO memory
Source: crucial.com
Later, when the byte is read back, the memory controller checks the odd or even state. If the number of bits 
is not an odd number for odd parity or an even number for even parity, a parity error occurs. A parity error 
always causes the system to halt. On the screen, you see the error message “Parity Error 1” or “Parity Error 2” 
or a similar error message about parity. Parity Error 1 is a parity error on the motherboard; Parity Error 2 is a 
parity error on an expansion card.
Figure 4-44 shows a SIMM for sale. It’s pricy because this old technology is hardly ever used. Notice 
the module is non-parity memory. In the ad, the SIMM is called EDO memory. EDO (extended data out) 
is a technology used by SIMMs.
Buffered and Registered DIMMs
Buffers and registers hold data and amplify a signal just before the data is written to the module. (Using 
buffers is an older technology than using registers.) Some DIMMs use buffers, some use registers, and 
some use neither. If a DIMM doesn’t support registers or buffers, it’s referred to as an unbuffered DIMM. 
Looking at the ad in Figure 4-42 for value memory used in desktops, you can see all the modules are 
unbuffered. However, in Figure 4-43, two of the kits of expensive server memory are registered DIMMs.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know that parity memory uses 9 bits (8 bits for data and 1 bit 
for parity). You also need to be familiar with ECC and non-ECC memory technologies.
Notes RAM chips that have become undependable and cannot hold data reliably can cause errors. Sometimes this 
happens when chips overheat or power falters.

CAS Latency and RAS Latency
Two other memory features are CAS Latency (CAS stands for “column access strobe”) and RAS Latency 
(RAS stands for “row access strobe”), which are two ways of measuring access timing. Both features refer 
to the number of clock cycles it takes to write or read a column or row of data off a memory module. CAS 
Latency is used more than RAS Latency. Lower values are better than higher ones. For example, CL8 is a 
little faster than CL9.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know that DDR3, DDR2, and DDR memory can be found on 
SO-DIMMs.
Notes In memory ads, CAS Latency is sometimes written as CL, and RAS Latency might be written as RL.
Notes When selecting memory, use the memory type that the motherboard manufacturer recommends.
Ads for memory modules might give the CAS Latency value within a series of timing numbers, such 
as 5-5-5-15. The first value is CAS Latency, which means the module is CL5. The second value is RAS 
Latency. Looking back at Figure 4-42, you can see CL ratings vary from 2.5 to 11.
Types of Memory Used in Laptops
Today’s laptops use DDR4, DDR3L, DDR3, or DDR2 SO-DIMM (small outline DIMM) memory. 
Table 4-5 lists current SO-DIMMs. All of these memory modules are smaller than regular DIMMs.
Memory Module Description
Sample Memory Module
2.74" 260-pin SO-DIMM contains DDR4 memory. The one notch  
on the module is offset from the center of the module.
2.66" 204-pin SO-DIMM contains DDR3 memory. The one notch on  
the module is offset from the center of the module. A DDR3L SO-DIMM  
uses less power than a regular DDR3 SO-DIMM.
2.66" 200-pin SO-DIMM contains DDR2 SDRAM. One notch is near  
the side of the module.
2.66" 200-pin SO-DIMM contains DDR SDRAM. One notch near the side of the

How to Upgrade Memory
To upgrade memory means to add more RAM to a computer. Adding more RAM might solve 
a problem with slow performance, applications refusing to load, or an unstable system. When 
Windows does not have adequate memory to perform an operation, it gives an “Insufficient 
memory” error or it slows down to a painful crawl.
When first purchased, many computers have empty slots on the motherboard, allowing you to add DIMMs 
or SO-DIMMs to increase the amount of RAM. Sometimes a memory module goes bad and must be replaced.
When you add more memory to your computer, you need answers to these questions:
	 How much RAM do I need and how much is currently installed?
	 How many and what kind of memory modules are currently installed on my motherboard?
	 How many and what kind of modules can I fit on my motherboard?
	 How do I select and purchase the right modules for my upgrade?
	 How do I physically install the new modules?
All these questions are answered in the following sections.
A+  
220-901 
1.3, 3.1
Just as with memory modules used in desktop computers, you can only use the type of memory 
the laptop is designed to support. The number of pins and the position of the notches on a SO-DIMM 
keep you from inserting the wrong module in a memory slot.
Now, onward to upgrading memory.
How Much Memory Do I Need and How Much Is Currently Installed?
With the demands today’s software places on memory, the answer is probably, “All you can 
get.” Windows 8 and Windows 7 need at least 2 GB, but more is better. The limit for a 32-bit 
OS is 4 GB installed RAM. A 64-bit Windows installation can handle more. For example, a 
64-bit installation of Windows 8 can use up to 128 GB of RAM, and a 64-bit installation of 
Windows 7 Home Premium can use up to 16 GB of RAM.

How Much Memory Is Currently 
Installed?
In Windows, you can use the System Information window to report the amount of physical memory installed. From 
the Windows 8 desktop, right-click Start, click Run, and then type msinfo32. For Windows 7, click Start and type 
msinfo32 in the Search box. The System Information window shown in Figure 4-45 reports the amount of installed 
physical memory. Notice on the window that 16 GB is installed.
Applying  Concepts
The BIOS setup screen shows more information about installed memory than does Windows. Reboot the computer 
and access BIOS setup (you learned how to do that in the chapter, “All About Motherboards”). The BIOS setup main 
menu for one system is shown in Figure 4-46. This screen shows the number of memory slots and how much RAM is 
installed in each slot. Notice the system has two memory channels of two slots each. You can, therefore, conclude 
this system is using dual channels.

How Many and What Kind of Memory Modules Are Currently Installed?
The next step to upgrading memory is to determine what type of memory modules the 
motherboard is currently using. If the board already has memory installed, you want to do 
your best to match the new modules with whatever is already installed. To learn what type 
of memory modules are already installed, do the following:
1. Open the case and look at the memory slots. How many slots do you have? How many are filled? 
Remove each module from its slot and look on it for imprinted type, size, and speed. For example, 
a module might say “PC2-4200/512MB.” The PC2 tells you the memory is DDR2, the 4200 is the 
PC rating and tells you the speed, and the 512 MB is the size. This is not enough information to 
know exactly what modules to purchase, but it’s a start.
2. Examine the module for the physical size and position of the notches. Compare the notch positions 
to those in Table 4-3.
3. Read your motherboard documentation. If the documentation is not clear (and some are not) or you 
don’t have the documentation, look on the motherboard for the imprinted manufacturer and model 
(see Figure 4-47). With this information, you can search a good memory website such as Kingston 
(www.kingston.com) or Crucial (www.crucial.com), which can tell you what type of modules this 
board supports.

4. Look in the documentation to see if the board supports dual channel, triple channel, or quad channels. 
If it does, most likely the memory slots on the board will be color-coded in pairs (for dual channels) 
or groups of three slots (for triple channels) or four slots (for quad channels). If the board supports 
multiple channels and modules are already installed, verify that matching DIMMs are installed in 
each channel.
5. If you still have not identified the module type, you can take the motherboard and the old memory 
modules to a good computer parts store and they should be able to match it for you.
Use an Online Memory Scanner
A great shortcut to research a memory upgrade is an online memory scanner. Go to www.crucial.com/systemscanner 
by Crucial. Download and run the Crucial System Scanner, which scans your system and reports what type of memory 
is installed and can be installed. Using the Crucial report, answer these questions:
1.	 Which motherboard do you have installed? How much memory is installed? How many memory slots does the 
board have? How many are populated?
2.	 What is the maximum memory the board supports? What type of memory does the board support? What would 
be the total cost of the memory upgrade if you were to max out the total memory on the board?

How Many and What Kind of Modules Can Fit on My Motherboard?
Now that you know what memory modules are already installed, you’re ready to decide 
how much and what kind of modules you can add to the board. Keep in mind that if all 
memory slots are full, sometimes you can take out small-capacity modules and replace them 
with larger-capacity modules, but you can only use the type, size, and speed of modules that 
the board can support. Also, if you must discard existing modules, the price of the upgrade increases.
To know how much memory your motherboard can physically hold, read the documentation that 
comes with the board. You can always install DIMMs as single modules, but you might not get the best 
performance by doing so. For best performance, install matching DIMMs in all the slots (two, three, or 
four slots) on one channel. Now let’s look at a few examples. The examples are ordered from a more recent 
motherboard to an older motherboard. As you study these examples, notice that the older the board, the 
more complicated the configuration can be and the harder it is to understand the documentation. Is life 
with computers getting simpler or what?
Motherboard Using DDR3 Dual-Channel DIMMs
The Intel Desktop Board DH67GD shown earlier in Figure 4-21 has four memory slots that use dual 
channeling. These slots are numbered in the user guide, as shown in Figure 4-48. The slots can hold 
Dual Channel DDR3 1333 MHz and 1066 MHz non-ECC, 1.35-V modules for up to 32 GB of RAM 
on this board. To use four DIMMs and dual channeling, install matching DIMMs in the two blue slots 
and matching DIMMs in the two black slots.

Figure 4-48  Documentation shows four DIMM slots that use dual channels
The motherboard user guide says it is possible to use only three DIMMs and dual channeling if 
you install matching DIMMs in the two blue slots and install a third DIMM in a black slot. This third 
DIMM must be equal in speed and total size of the DIMMs in the blue slots. For example, you can 
install two 4-GB DIMMs in the two blue slots and one 8-GB DIMM in a black slot for a total of 16-GB 
of RAM. If you install only a single DIMM on this board, it must go in the first blue slot, which is the 
blue slot closest to the processor.
Motherboard Using DDR3 Triple-Channel DIMMs
The Intel motherboard shown earlier in Figure 4-40 has four DDR3 memory slots that can be configured 
for single, dual, or triple channeling. The four empty slots are shown in Figure 4-49. If triple channeling 
is used, three matching DIMMs are used in the three blue slots. If the fourth slot is populated, the board 
reverts to single channeling. For dual channeling, install two matching DIMMs in the two blue slots farthest 
from the processor and leave the other two slots empty. If only one DIMM is installed, it goes in the blue 
slot in the farthest position from the processor.

Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory
Figure 4-49  Four DDR3 slots on a motherboard
The motherboard documentation says that these types of DIMMs can be used:
	 The DIMM voltage rating no higher than 1.6 V
	 Non-ECC DDR3 memory
	 Serial Presence Detect (SPD) memory only
	 Gold-plated contacts (some modules use tin-plated contacts)
	 1333 MHz, 1066 MHz, or 800 MHz (best to match the system bus speed)
	 Unbuffered, nonregistered single- or double-sided DIMMs
	 Up to 16 GB total installed RAM
The third item in the list needs an explanation. Serial Presence Detect (SPD) is a DIMM technology that 
declares to system UEFI/BIOS at startup the module’s size, speed, voltage, and data path width. If the DIMM 
does not support SPD, the system might not boot or boot with errors. Today’s memory always supports SPD.
Motherboard Using DDR DIMMs with Dual Channeling
Let’s look at another example of a DIMM installation. The Pentium motherboard allows you to use three 
different speeds of DDR DIMMs in one to four sockets on the board. The board supports dual channeling 
and has two blue slots for one channel and two black slots for the other channel. For dual channeling 
to work, matching DIMMs must be installed in the two blue sockets. If two DIMMs are installed in the 
two black sockets, they must match each other.
This board supports up to 4 GB of unbuffered, 184-pin, non-ECC memory running at PC3200, 
PC2700, or PC2100. The documentation says the system bus can run at 800 MHz, 533 MHz, or 
400 MHz, depending on the speed of the processor installed. Therefore, the speed of the processor 
determines the system bus speed, which determines the speed of memory modules.
Figure 4-50 outlines the possible configurations of these DIMM modules, showing that you can install 
one, two, or four DIMMs and which sockets should hold these DIMMs. To take advantage of dual 
channeling on this motherboard, you must populate the sockets according to Figure 4-50, so that identical 
DIMM pairs are working together in DIMM_A1 and DIMM_B1 sockets (the blue sockets), and another 
pair can work together in DIMM_A2 and DIMM_B2 sockets (the black sockets).
The board has two installed DDR DIMMs. The label on one of these DIMMs is shown in Figure 4-51. 
The important items on this label are the size (256 MB), the speed (400 MHz or 3200 PC rating), and the 
CAS Latency (CL3). With this information and knowledge about what the board can support, we are now 
ready to select and buy the memory for the upgrade. For example, if you decide to upgrade the system to

best results, you need to also match the manufacturer and buy Elixir memory.
How Do I Select and Purchase the Right Memory Modules?
You’re now ready to make the purchase. As you select your memory, you might find it difficult 
to find an exact match to DIMMs already installed on the board. If necessary, here are some 
compromises you cannot or can make:
	 Mixing unbuffered memory with buffered or registered memory won’t work.
	 When matching memory, for best results, also match the module manufacturer. But in a pinch, you can 
try using memory from two different manufacturers.
	 If you mix memory speeds, know that all modules will perform at the slowest speed.
Now let’s look at how to use a website or other computer ad to search for the right memory.
Using a Website to Research Your Purchase
When purchasing memory from a website such as Crucial Technology’s site (www.crucial.com) or 
Kingston Technology’s site (www.kingston.com), look for a search utility that will match memory modules 
to your motherboard (see Figure 4-52). These utilities are easy to use and help you confirm you have made

Plan and Price a Memory Upgrade
Using the information you gained about your computer in Hands-On Project 4-3, research the web to determine 
the total cost of the memory upgrade in order to max out the total memory on your computer. You can keep the 
cost down by using the modules you already have, but don’t forget to match the speed of the modules already 
installed. Print two webpages from two sites other than the Crucial site that show the modules you would 
purchase. How much will the upgrade cost?
Hands-On  Project 4-4
How Do I Install the New Modules?
When installing RAM modules, be careful to protect the chips against static electricity, as you 
learned to do in the “Working Inside Desktop Computers and Laptops” chapter. Follow these 
precautions:
	 Always use an ESD strap as you work.
	 Turn off the power, unplug the power cord, press the power button, and remove the case cover.
	 Handle memory modules with care.
	 Don’t touch the edge connectors on the memory module or on the memory slot.
	 Don’t stack cards or modules because you can loosen a chip.
	 Usually modules pop into place easily and are secured by spring catches on both ends. Make sure that 
you look for the notches on one side or in the middle of the module that orient the module in the slot.
Let’s now look at the details of installing a DIMM.
A+  
220-901 
1.3, 3.1
Installing DIMMs
For DIMM modules, small clips latch into place on each side of the slot to hold the module in the slot, as 
shown in Figure 4-54. Some newer motherboards have only one latch on the slot. To install a DIMM, first 
pull the supporting arms on the sides of the slot outward. Look on the DIMM edge connector for the notches, 
Modules faster than the board supports are listed. They will work on the board, running at a slower speed, 
but it’s not necessary to spend the money for speed you won’t use. The best buy is the second item listed; 
these DIMMs are rated at 1333 MHz, which is the maximum speed the board supports.

When the DIMM is fully inserted, the supporting clips should pop back into place. Figure 4-55 shows a DIMM 
being inserted into a slot on a motherboard. Apply pressure on both ends of the DIMM at the same time.

Most often, placing memory on the motherboard is all that is necessary for installation. When the 
computer powers up, it counts the memory present without any further instruction and senses the features 
that the modules support, such as ECC or buffering. For some really old computers, you must tell BIOS 
setup the amount of memory present. Read the motherboard documentation to determine what yours 
requires. If the new memory is not recognized, power down the system and reseat the module. Most 
likely it’s not installed solidly in the slot.

How to Upgrade Memory on a Laptop
Before upgrading memory, make sure you are not voiding the laptop’s warranty. Search for 
the best buy, but make sure you use memory modules made by or authorized by your laptop’s 
manufacturer and designed for the exact model of your laptop. Installing generic memory 
might save money but might also void the laptop’s warranty.
Upgrading memory on a laptop works about the same way as with upgrading memory on a desktop: 
Decide how much memory you can upgrade and what type of memory you need, purchase the memory, and 
install it. As with a desktop computer, be sure to match the type of memory to the type the laptop supports.

>> Chapter Summary
Types and Characteristics of Processors
	The most important component on the motherboard is the processor, or central processing unit. The two 
major manufacturers of processors are Intel and AMD.
	Processors are rated by the processor speed, the socket and chipset the processor can use, processor 
architecture (32-bit or 64-bit), multicore rating, how much internal memory cache the processor 
has, amount and type of RAM the processor can support, and the computing technologies the 
processor can use.
	A processor’s memory cache inside the processor housing can be an L1 cache (contained on the 
processor die), L2 cache (off the die), and L3 cache (farther from the core than L2 cache).
	The core of a processor has two arithmetic logic units (ALUs). Multicore processors have two, three, 
or more cores (called dual core, triple core, quad core, and so forth). Each core can process two threads 
at once if the feature is enabled in UEFI/BIOS setup.
	The current families of Intel processors for desktops include the Core, Atom, Celeron, and Pentium 
families of processors. Several different processors are within each family.
	The current AMD desktop processor families are the FX, Phenom, Athlon, and Sempron. Several 
processors exist within each family.
Selecting and Installing a Processor
	Select a processor that the motherboard supports. A board is likely to support several processors that 
vary in performance and price.
	When installing a processor, always follow the directions given in the motherboard user guide and be 
careful to protect the board and processor against ESD. Current Intel sockets LGA1150, LGA1155, 
LGA1366, and LGA775 use a socket lever and socket load plate. When opening these sockets, lift the 
socket lever and then the socket load plate, install the processor, and then close the socket. Many AMD 
sockets have a socket lever, but not a socket load plate.

Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory
Memory Technologies
	DRAM is stored on DIMMs for desktop computers and SO-DIMMs for laptops.
	Types of current DIMMs are DDR4 with 288 pins, DDR3 and DDR2 DIMMs that have 240 pins, 
and DDR DIMMs with 184 pins.
	DIMMs can be single-sided or double-sided. Some double-sided DIMMs provide more than one memory 
bank and are called dual ranked or quad ranked. A memory bank has a 64-bit data path and is accessed 
by the processor independently of other banks.
	DIMMs can work together in dual channels, triple channels, and quad channels so that the memory 
controller can access more than one DIMM at a time to improve performance. In a channel, all DIMMs 
must match in size, speed, and features. DDR3 DIMMs can use dual, triple, or quad channeling, but 
DDR and DDR2 DIMMs can only use dual channels. DDR4 DIMMs can use dual or quad channels.
	DIMM speeds are measured in MHz (for example, 1333 MHz) or PC rating (for example, PC3-10600).
	The memory controller can check memory for errors and possibly correct those errors using ECC  
(error-correcting code). Using parity, an older technology, the controller could only recognize an error 
had occurred, but not correct it.
	Buffers and registers are used to hold data and amplify a data signal. A DIMM is rated as a buffered, 
registered, or unbuffered DIMM.
	CAS Latency (CL) and RAS Latency (RL) measure access time to memory. The lower values are faster 
than the higher values.
	Today’s laptops use DDR4, DDR3L, DDR3, or DDR2 SO-DIMMs.
How to Upgrade Memory
	When upgrading memory, use the type, size, and speed the motherboard supports and match new 
modules to those already installed. Features to match include DDR4, DDR3, DDR2, DDR, size in MB 
or GB, speed (MHz or PC rating), buffered, registered, unbuffered, single-sided, double-sided, CL rating, 
tin or gold connectors, support for dual, triple, or quad channeling, ECC, and non-ECC. Using memory 
made by the same manufacturer is recommended.
	When upgrading components on a laptop, including memory, use components that are the same brand 
as the laptop, or use only components recommended by the laptop’s manufacturer.

Supporting the Power System 
and Troubleshooting Computers
I
n the first chapters of this text, you learned much about the 
motherboard, processor, and RAM. This chapter focuses on how 
to keep these heat-producing components cool. You learn about the 
fans, heat sinks, and other devices needed to keep a system cool. You 
also learn about one more essential component of a computer system, 
the power supply, including how to select a power supply to meet the 
wattage needs of a system.
Then we focus on troubleshooting these various hardware subsystems 
and components. You study the troubleshooting techniques and 
procedures to get the full picture of what it’s like to have the tools and 
knowledge in hand to solve any computer hardware-related problem. 
Then you learn to practically apply these skills to troubleshooting the 
electrical system, motherboard, processor, and memory. Finally, you learn 
about troubleshooting the hardware in mobile devices. By the end of 
this chapter, you should feel confident that you can face a problem with 
hardware and understand how to zero in on the source of the problem 
and its solution.

Supporting the Power System and Troubleshooting Computers
Cooling Methods and Devices
The processor, motherboard, memory modules, expansion cards, and other components in the 
case produce heat, and, if they get overheated, the system can get unstable and components 
can fail or be damaged. As a hardware technician, you need to know how to keep a system 
cool. Devices that are used to keep a system cool include CPU fans, case fans, coolers, heat 
sinks, and liquid cooling systems.
In this part of the chapter, you learn about these several methods to keep the system cool. We begin with 
keeping the processor cool.
Processor Coolers, Fans, and Heat Sinks
Because a processor generates so much heat, computer systems use a cooling assembly 
designed for a specific processor to keep temperatures below the processor maximum 
temperature. If a processor reaches its maximum temperature, it automatically shuts down. 
Good processor coolers maintain a temperature of 90–110 degrees F (32–43 degrees C). The 
cooler (see Figure 5-1) sits on top of the processor and consists of a fan and a heat sink. A heat sink is 
made of metal that draws the heat away from the processor into the fins. The fan can then blow the heat 
away. You learned to install a cooler in the chapter, “Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory.”

Figure 5-1  A cooler sits on top of a processor to help keep it cool
A cooler is made of aluminum, copper, or a 
combination of both. Copper is more expensive, 
but does a better job of conducting heat. For 
example, the Thermaltake (www.thermaltake.
com) multisocket cooler shown in Figure 5-2 
is made of copper and has an adjustable fan 
control.
Recall that the cooler is bracketed to the 
motherboard using a wire or plastic clip and 
thermal compound is placed between the 
bottom of the cooler heat sink and the top of 
the processor. To get its power, the cooler fan 
power cord connects to a 4-pin fan header on the 
motherboard (see Figure 5-3). The fan connector 
will have three or four holes. A three-hole 
connector can fit onto a 4-pin header; just ignore 
the last pin. A 4-pin header on the motherboard 
supports pulse width modulation (PWM) that 
controls fan speed in order to reduce the overall noise in a system. If you use a cooler fan power cord with 
three pins, know that the fan will always operate at the same speed.

For enthusiasts trying to run a desktop computer with 
less noise, a fanless CPU cooler, also called a passive 
CPU cooler, can help (see Figure 5-4). These coolers 
contain heat pipes, which contain a small amount of 
liquid that becomes a vapor when heated, and the vapor 
draws the heat away from the CPU toward the fins 
on the cooler. There the heat can be blown away by 
case fans. Most passive CPU coolers are very large, so 
before you buy one, be sure it will fit in your computer 
case with all other components installed. Also, most 
motherboards give a startup error if a cable is not 
attached to the CPU fan header. Because these coolers 
don’t have a fan cable, you will need to attach another 
cable to the header. For some systems, you can connect 
a case fan to the header.

Case Fans and Other Fans and Heat Sinks
To prevent overheating, you can also install additional case fans. Most cases have one or more 
positions on the case to hold a case fan to help draw air out of the case. Figure 5-5 shows 
holes on the rear of a case designed to hold a case fan.

Supporting the Power System and Troubleshooting Computers
A computer case might need as many as seven or eight fans mounted inside the case; however, the trend 
is to use fewer and larger fans. Generally, large fans tend to perform better and run quieter than small fans.
Processors and video cards, also called graphics 
cards, are the two highest heat producers in a system. 
Some graphics cards come with a fan on the side of 
the card. You can also purchase heat sinks and fans to 
mount on a card to keep it cool. Another solution is 
to use a fan card mounted next to the graphics card. 
Figure 5-6 shows a PCI fan card. Be sure you select 
the fan card that fits the expansion slot you plan to 
use, and make sure there’s enough clearance beside the 
graphics card for the fan card to fit.
For additional cooling, consider a RAM cooler 
such as the one shown in Figure 5-7. It clips over a 
DIMM. A fan might be powered by a SATA power 
connector or 4-pin Molex power connector. The fan 
shown in Figure 5-7 uses a Molex connector. You can 
use an adapter to convert a SATA or Molex connector 
to whichever the power supply provides.

Liquid Cooling Systems
In addition to using fans, heat sinks, and thermal compound to keep a processor cool, a 
liquid cooling system can be used. For the most part, they are used by hobbyists attempting 
to overclock to the max a processor in a gaming computer. For example, Intel recommends a 
liquid cooling system for processors that use the LGA2011 socket, which is typically used on 
hobbyist and gaming computers. (You learned about this socket in the chapter, “All About Motherboards.”) 
Liquid cooling systems tend to run quieter than other cooling methods. They might include a PCIe or PCI 
card that has a power supply, temperature sensor, and processor to control the cooler.
Using liquid cooling, a small pump sits inside the computer case, and tubes move liquid around components 
and then away from them to a place where fans can cool the liquid, similar to how a car radiator works. 
Figure 5-8 shows one liquid cooling system where the liquid is cooled by fans sitting inside a large case. 
Sometimes, however, the liquid is pumped outside the case, where it is cooled.
A+  
220-901 
1.6
When selecting any fan or cooler, take into consideration the added noise level and the ease of installation. 
Some coolers and fans can use a temperature sensor that controls the fan. Also consider the guarantee made 
by the cooler or fan manufacturer.

Now let’s turn our attention to the power 
supply.
Selecting a Power Supply
In the chapter, “Working 
Inside Desktop Computers and 
Laptops,” you learned how to 
uninstall and install a power 
supply unit (PSU). Reasons you might 
need to replace a power supply are when a 
power supply fails, or the power supply in 
an existing system is not adequate for the 
system. When building a new system, you 
can purchase a computer case with the power 
supply already installed (see Figure 5-9), or 
you can purchase a power supply separate 
from the case.

Supporting the Power System and Troubleshooting Computers
	
When selecting a power supply, pay particular attention to the capacity for the +12 V rail. (A rail is 
the term used to describe each circuit provided by the power supply.) The +12 V rail is the most used, 
especially in high-end gaming systems. Notice in Figure 5-10, the +12 V rail gets 360 W of the maximum 
525 W load. Sometimes you need to use a power supply with a higher-than-needed overall wattage to 
get enough wattage on this one rail. Also, a PSU rated 1000 W and higher might have a second +12 V 
rail and is called a dual rail power supply. The extra rail is used for safety to ensure that a single +12 V 
rail is not overloaded.
	 Number and type of connectors. Consider the number and type of power cables and connectors the 
unit provides. Connector types are shown in Table 1-2 in the chapter, “First Look at Computer Parts 
and Tools.” Table 5-1 lists some common connectors and the voltages they supply. Some power supplies 
include detached power cables that you can plug into connectors on the side of the unit. By using only 
the power cables you need, extra power cables don’t get in the way of airflow inside the computer case.
Types and Characteristics of Power Supplies
As you select the right power supply for a system, you need to be aware of the following 
power supply features:
A+  
220-901 
1.2, 1.8
	 Wattage ratings. A power supply has a wattage rating for total output maximum load (for example, 500 W, 
850 W, or 1000 W) and individual wattage ratings for each of the voltage output circuits. These wattage 
capacities are listed in the documentation and on the side of a power supply, as shown in Figure 5-10.
	 ATX or microATX form factor. The form factor of a power supply determines the size of 
the power supply and the placement of screw holes and slots used to anchor the power 
supply to the case.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam 
expects you to know the voltage output of 
the power connectors listed in Table 5-1. 
Consider memorizing the table.
Notes If a power supply doesn’t have 
the connector you need, it is likely you can 
buy an adapter to convert one connector 
to another. For example, Figure 5-11 shows 
an adapter that converts two Molex cables 
to one 12 V 6-pin PCIe connector.
	 Fans inside the PSU. Every power supply has a fan inside its case; some have two fans. The fan can be 
mounted on the back or top of the PSU. Fans range in size from 80mm to 150mm wide. The larger the fan, 
the better job it does and the quieter it runs. Some PSUs can automatically adjust the fan speed based on the 
internal temperature of the system.
Figure 5-11  This adapter converts two Molex cables to a single 12 V 
6-pin PCIe connector
	 Dual voltage options. Expect a power supply to have a dual-voltage selector switch on the back where 
you can switch input voltage to 115 V for the United States or 220 V for other countries.
	 Extra features. Consider the warranty of the power supply and the overall quality. Some power supplies 
are designed to support two video cards used in a gaming computer. Two technologies used for dual 
video cards are SLI by NVIDIA and Crossfire by AMD. If you plan to use dual video cards, use a PSU 
that supports SLI or Crossfire used by the video cards. Know that more expensive power supplies are 
quieter, last longer, and don’t put off as much heat as less expensive ones. Also, expect a good power 
supply to protect the system against overvoltage. A power supply rated with Active PFC runs more 
efficiently and uses less electricity than other power supplies.
Notes Some power supplies are designed without fans so that they can be used in home theater systems or other 
areas where quiet operation is a requirement.
How to Calculate Wattage Capacity
When deciding what wattage capacity you need for the power supply, consider the total 
wattage requirements of all components inside the case as well as USB and FireWire devices 
that get their power from ports connected to the motherboard.
A+  
220-901 
1.2, 1.8
Keep these two points in mind when selecting the correct wattage capacity for a power supply:
	 Video cards draw the most power. Video cards draw the most power in a system, and they draw 
from the +12 V output. If your system has a video card, pay particular attention to the +12 V rating. 
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know how to select and install a power supply. You need to 
know how to decide on the wattage, connectors, and form factor of the power supply.

192
Supporting the Power System and Troubleshooting Computers
The current trend is for the motherboard to provide the video components and video port, thus reducing 
the overall wattage needs for a system. Video cards are primarily used in gaming computers or other 
systems that require high-quality graphics.
	 The power supply should be rated about 30 percent higher than expected needs. Power supplies that 
run at less than peak performance last longer and don’t overheat. In addition, a power supply loses some 
of its capacity over time. Also, don’t worry about a higher-rated power supply using too much electricity. 
Components only draw what they need. For example, a power supply rated at 1000 W and running at 
a 500 W draw will last longer and give off less heat than a power supply rated at 750 W and running 
at a 500 W draw.
To know what size power supply you need, add up the wattage requirements of all components, and 
add 30 percent. Technical documentation for these components should give you the information you need. 
Table 5-2 lists appropriate wattage ratings for common devices. Alternately, you can use a wattage calculator 
provided on the website of many manufacturers and vendors. Using the calculator, you enter the components 
in your system and then the calculator will recommend the wattage you need for your power supply.
Table 5-3 lists a few case and power supply manufacturers.
Caution
Some older Dell motherboards and power supplies do not use the standard P1 pinouts for ATX, although the 
power connectors look the same. For this reason, never use a Dell power supply with a non-Dell motherboard, or a Dell 
motherboard with a non-Dell power supply, without first verifying that the power connector pinouts match; otherwise, 
you might destroy the power supply, the motherboard, or both.

How to Approach a Hardware Problem
5
So far in the text, you have learned about motherboards, processors, RAM, and the electrical system, 
which are the principal hardware components of a computer. With this hardware foundation in place, 
you’re ready to learn about computer troubleshooting. Let’s start with an overview of how to approach 
any hardware problem, and then we’ll turn our attention to the details of troubleshooting the electrical 
system, motherboard, RAM, and CPU.
How to Approach a Hardware Problem
A good IT support technician over time builds a strong network of resources he or she can 
count on when solving computer problems. Here are some resources to help you get started 
with your own list of reliable and time-tested sources of help:
A+  
220-901 
3.0, 4.1
Calculate Wattage Capacity for Your System
Do the following to compare the wattage capacity of the power supply installed in your computer 
with the recommended value:
Hands-On  Project 5-1
A+  
220-901 
1.8
1.	 Search the web for a power supply wattage calculator. Be sure the one you use is provided by 
a reliable website. For example, the ones at newegg.com and extreme.outervision.com are reliable. 
(At newegg.com, click Computer Hardware and then click Power Supply Wattage Calculator. At extreme.
outervision.com, click eXtreme Power Supply Calculator.)
2.	 Enter the information about your computer system. Print or save the webpage showing the resulting calculations.
3.	 What is the recommended wattage capacity for a power supply for your system?
4.	 Look on the printed label on the power supply currently installed in your computer. What is its wattage capacity?
5.	 If you had to replace the power supply in your system, what wattage capacity would you select?
Shop for a Power Supply
Shop online for a power supply to meet the needs of each of the following systems. Print or save the 
webpage showing the power supply, its features, and its price:
Hands-On  Project 5-2
A+  
220-901 
1.8
1.	 A regular desktop system for light computing has a moderately priced motherboard and processor, 
onboard video, two SATA hard drives, a DVD-RW drive, and two case fans. The system needs a 
microATX power supply rated at least 450 W.
2.	 A file server has a high-end motherboard and processor using the LGA2011 socket, 8 modules of DDR4 RAM, 
onboard video, one SSD SATA hard drive, five magnetic SATA hard drives, DVD-RW drive, tape drive, PCI RAID 
card, and four fans. The system needs an ATX power supply rated at about 550 W.
3.	 A gaming system has a high-end motherboard and processor, two high-end video cards using SLI technology, 
two SATA hard drives, a Blu-ray drive, and four fans. The system needs an ATX power supply rated at about 
800 W. The two high-end video cards require about 275 W each.
4.	 Suppose the gaming system in Number 3 is generating extra heat because of overclocking and a liquid cooling 
system has been installed. To account for the needs of the liquid cooling system, the power supply needs to 
be upgraded to 1800 W.

Supporting the Power System and Troubleshooting Computers
	 The web. Do a web search on an error message, short description of the problem, or model and 
manufacturer of a device to get all sorts of help on the web. Check out the website of the product 
manufacturer or search a support forum. It’s likely that others have encountered the same problem 
and posted the question and answer. If you search and cannot find your answer, you can post a new 
question. Youtube.com videos might help. Many technicians enjoy sharing what they know online, 
but be careful, however. Not all technical advice is correct or well intentioned.
	 Chat, forums, or email technical support. Support from the hardware and software manufacturers can 
help you interpret an error message or provide general support in diagnosing a problem. Most technical 
support is available during working hours by way of an online chat session.
	 Manufacturer’s diagnostic software. Many hardware device manufacturers provide diagnostic software, 
which is available for download from their websites. For example, you can download Diagnostic Tools 
(can be used to copy all data from a drive that won’t boot to another device), SeaTools for Windows (must 
be installed in Windows), or SeaTools for DOS (used to create a bootable CD that contains the software) 
and use the software to diagnose problems with Seagate and Maxtor drives. See Figure 5-12. Search the 
support section of a manufacturer’s website to find diagnostic software and guidelines for using it.
	 User manuals. Refer to your user manuals, which often list error messages and their meanings. They also 
might contain a troubleshooting section and list any diagnostic tools available.
	 Technical associates in your organization can help. Be sure to ask for advice when you’re stuck. 
Also, after making a reasonable and diligent effort to resolve a problem, getting the problem fixed 
could become more important than resolving it yourself. There comes a time when you might need 
to turn the problem over to a more experienced technician. (In an organization, this process is 
called escalating the problem.)
Next, let’s examine the six-step model for computer troubleshooting. You’ll learn much more about these steps 
in later chapters. Keep in mind, however, that these steps are only the beginning of computer troubleshooting. 
As an IT technician, expect that you will build your own style and steps for troubleshooting based on your own 
experiences over time.

How to Approach a Hardware Problem

Step 1: Interview the User
When an end user brings any computer problem to you, begin the troubleshooting process by 
interviewing the user. When you interview the user, you might want to include these questions:
A+  
220-901 
4.1
	 Can you describe the problem and describe when the problem first started and when it occurs?
	 Was the computer recently moved?
	 Was any new hardware or software recently installed?
	 Was any software recently reconfigured or upgraded?
	 Did someone else use your computer recently?
	 Does the computer have a history of similar problems?
	 Is there important data on the drive that is not backed up?
	 Can you show me how to reproduce the problem?
After you gather this basic information, you can prioritize what to do and begin diagnosing and 
addressing the problem. If the computer will not start or starts with errors so that you cannot reach the 
Windows desktop, setting priorities helps focus your work. For most users, data is the first priority unless 
they have a recent backup.
Step 2: Back up Data as Needed
If the hard drive has important data on it that has not been backed up, your first priority is 
most likely to recover the data. Here are three options for doing that:
A+  
220-901 
4.1
	 Move the hard drive to another system. If a system won’t boot from the hard drive, consider 
removing the drive and installing it as a second drive in a working system. If the file system 
on the problem drive is intact, you might be able to copy data from the drive to the primary drive in the 
working system.
	
To move the hard drive to a working computer, you don’t need to physically install the drive in the 
drive bay. Open the computer case. Carefully lay the drive on the case and connect a power cord and 
data cable (see Figure 5-13). Then turn on the computer. While you have the computer turned on, be 
very careful to not touch the drive or touch inside the case. Also, while a tower case is lying on its side 
like the one in Figure 5-13, don’t use the optical drive.
Figure 5-13  Move a hard drive to a working computer to recover 
data on the drive
	
Start the computer and sign in to 
Windows using an Administrator account. 
(If you don’t sign in with an Administrator 
account, you must provide the password 
to an Administrator account before you 
can access the files on the newly con-
nected hard drive.) When Windows finds 
the new drive, it assigns it a drive letter. 
Use Explorer in Windows 8/7/Vista or 
third-party software to copy files from 
this drive to the primary hard drive in this 
system or to another storage media. Then 
return the drive to the original system and 
turn your attention to solving the original 
problem.

Supporting the Power System and Troubleshooting Computers
	 Use file recovery software. File recovery software is third-party software that can help recover deleted 
and corrupted files. On the Internet, do a search on “data recovery” for lots of examples. One good 
product is GetDataBack by Runtime Software (www.runtime.org), which can recover data and program 
files even when Windows cannot recognize the drive. Another example is Seagate Recovery Services 
(see Figure 5-15), which includes various tools and services, including file recovery software PC Trial.
Figure 5-14  Use a USB-to-SATA converter to recover data from a drive using a SATA connector
Figure 5-15  File recovery software made available by Seagate, a hard drive manufacturer
Source: www.seagate.com
Notes An easier way to temporarily install a hard drive in a system is to use a USB port. Figure 5-14 shows a  
SATA-to-USB converter kit. The SATA connector can be used for desktop or laptop hard drives because a SATA connector 
is the same for both. A SATA-to-USB converter is really handy when recovering data and troubleshooting problems with 
hard drives that refuse to boot.
	 Hire a professional file recovery service. If your data is extremely valuable and other methods have failed, you 
might want to consider a professional data recovery service. They’re expensive, but getting the data back might 
be worth it. To find a service, do a web search on “data recovery.” Before selecting a service, be sure to read 
reviews, understand the warranty and guarantees, and perhaps get a recommendation from a satisfied customer. 
For example, in Figure 5-15, click Data Recovery to see a description of the service offered by Seagate.

Step 3: Examine the System and Establish a Theory
After data is secure, you’re ready to tackle the problem and its solution. Most computer 
problems are simple and can be simply solved, but you do need a game plan. That’s how 
Figure 5-16 can help. The flowchart focuses on problems that affect the boot. As you work 
your way through it, you’re eliminating one major computer subsystem after another until 
you zero in on the problem. After you’ve discovered the problem, many times the solution is obvious.

Supporting the Power System and Troubleshooting Computers
As Figure 5-16 indicates, troubleshooting a computer problem is divided into problems that occur during 
the boot and those that occur after the Windows Start screen or desktop has successfully loaded. Problems 
that occur during the boot might happen before Windows starts to load or during Windows startup. Read 
the flowchart in Figure 5-16 very carefully to get an idea of the symptoms you might be faced with that 
would cause you to suspect each subsystem.
Also, Table 5-4 can help as a general guideline for the primary symptoms and what are likely to be the 
sources of a problem.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam might give you a symptom and expect you to select a probable source of a 
problem from a list of sources. These examples of what can go wrong can help you connect problem sources to symptoms.
Symptom or Error Message
What to Do About the Problem
System shuts down unexpectedly
Try to find out what was happening at the time of the shutdowns to 
pinpoint an application or device causing the problem. Possible sources 
of the problem are overheating or faulty RAM, motherboard, or processor.
System shuts down unexpectedly and 
starts back up
Begin by checking the system for overheating. Is the processor cooler 
fan working? Go to UEFI/BIOS setup and check the temperature of the 
processor. When the processor overheats and the system restarts, the 
problem is called a processor thermal trip error.
System locks up with an error 
message on a blue screen, called 
a blue screen of death (BSOD)
Figure 5-17 shows an example of a BSOD error screen. These Windows errors 
are caused by problems with devices, device drivers, or a corrupted Windows 
installation. Begin troubleshooting by searching the Microsoft website for 
the error message and a description of the problem.
System locks up with an error 
message on a black screen
These error messages, such as the one shown in Figure 5-18, are most likely 
caused by an error at POST. Begin by troubleshooting the device mentioned 
in the error message.
System freezes or locks up without 
an error message
If the system locks up without an error screen and while still displaying 
the Windows Start screen or desktop, the problem is most likely caused by 
an application not responding. Sometimes you’ll see the Windows pinwheel 
indicating the system is waiting for a response from a program or device. 
Open the Windows Task Manager utility and end any application that is not 
responding. If that doesn’t work, restart Windows.
POST code beeps
One or no beep indicates that all is well after POST. However, startup UEFI/
BIOS communicates POST errors as a series of beeps before it tests video. 
Search the website of the motherboard or UEFI/BIOS manufacturer to know 
how to interpret a series of beep codes. You might need to restart the 
system more than once so you can carefully count the beeps. Table 5-5 lists 
some common beep codes.
No power
If you see no lights on the computer case and hear no spinning fans, make 
sure the surge protector or wall outlet has power. Is the switch on the rear 
of the case on? Is the dual voltage selector switch set correctly? Are power 
supply connectors securely connected? Is the power supply bad?
Blank screen when you first power 
up the computer, and no noise or 
indicator lights
Is power getting to the system? If power is getting to the computer, address 
the problem as an electrical problem with the computer. Make sure the 
power supply is good and power supply connectors are securely connected.
Blank screen when you first power up 
the computer, and you can hear the 
fans spinning and see indicator lights
Troubleshoot the video subsystem. Is the monitor turned on? Is the monitor 
data cable securely connected at both ends? Is the indicator light on the 
front of the monitor on?
BIOS loses its time and date settings
“CMOS battery low” error message 
appears during the boot
The CMOS battery is failing. Replace the battery.
System reports less memory than you 
know is installed
A memory module is not seated correctly or has failed. Begin 
troubleshooting memory.

Symptom or Error Message
What to Do About the Problem
System attempts to boot to the wrong 
boot device
Go into UEFI/BIOS setup and change the boot device priority order.
Fans spin, but no power to other 
devices
Begin by checking the power supply. Are connectors securely connected? 
Use a power supply tester to check for correct voltage outputs.
Smoke or burning smell
Consider this a serious electrical problem. Immediately unplug the computer.
Loud whining noise
Most likely the noise is made by the power supply or a failing hard 
drive. There might be a short. The power supply might be going bad or is 
underrated for the system.
Clicking noise
A clicking noise likely indicates the hard drive is failing. Replace the drive 
as soon as possible.
Intermittent device failures
Failures that come and go might be caused by overheating or failing RAM, 
the motherboard, processor, or hard drive. Begin by checking the processor 
temperature for overheating. Then check RAM for errors and run diagnostics 
on the hard drive.
Distended capacitors
Failed capacitors on the motherboard or other circuit board are 
sometimes distended and discolored on the top of the capacitor. Replace 
the motherboard.
Error appears during boot:  
Intruder detection error
An intrusion detection device installed on the motherboard has detected 
that the computer case was opened. Suspect a security breach.
Error appears during boot: 
Overclocking failed. Please enter 
setup to reconfigure your system
Overclocking should be discontinued. However, this error might not be 
related to overclocking; it can occur when the power supply is failing.
Possible error messages:
No boot device available
Hard drive not found
Fixed disk error
Invalid boot disk
Inaccessible boot device or drive
Invalid drive specification
Startup BIOS did not find a device to use to load the operating system.  
Make sure the boot device priority order is correct in BIOS setup. Then  
begin troubleshooting the hard drive.
Possible error messages:
Missing operating system
Error loading operating system
Windows startup programs are missing or corrupted. How to troubleshoot 
Windows startup is covered in the chapter, “Troubleshooting Windows 
Startup.”
Continuous reboots
See explanation later in this chapter.

Four Troubleshooting Rules
Here are four important rules that can help you solve many hardware problems:
Rule 1: Check the Obvious and Check Simple Things First
Check for obvious and simple solutions first. Here are some tips:
	Is the external device plugged in and turned on? Are the data cable connections solid at both ends? Is there 
a wall light switch controlling the power, and is it turned on? Is the surge suppressor you’re using plugged 
in and turned on?
	For expansion cards and memory modules, are they seated solidly in their slots? For sound, is the volume knob 
turned up? For video, is the monitor getting power, turned on, connected, and is the screen resolution correct?

How to Approach a Hardware Problem

	Consider the application using the device. For example, if you are having problems trying to use a USB 
scanner, try scanning using a different application.
Rule 2: Trade Known Good for Suspected Bad
When diagnosing hardware problems, this method works well if you can draw from a group of parts that you know 
work correctly. Suppose, for example, video does not work. The parts of the video subsystem are the video card, 
the power cord to the monitor, the cord from the monitor to the computer case, and the monitor itself. Also, don’t 
forget that the video card is inserted into an expansion slot on the motherboard, and the monitor depends on 
electrical power. As you suspect each of these five components to be bad, you can try them one at a time beginning 
with the easiest one to replace: the monitor. Trade the monitor for one that you know works. If this theory fails, 
trade the power cord, trade the cord to the computer’s video port, move the video card to a new slot, and trade the 
video card. When you’re trading a good component for a suspected bad one, work methodically by eliminating one 
component at a time.
Rule 3: Trade Suspected Bad for Known Good
An alternate approach works well in certain situations. If you have a working computer that is configured similarly 
to the one you are troubleshooting (a common situation in many corporate or educational environments), rather 
than trading good for suspected bad, you can trade suspected bad for good. Take each component that you suspect is 
bad and install it in the working computer. If the component works on the good computer, then you have eliminated 
it as a suspect. If the working computer breaks down, then you have probably identified the bad component.
Rule 4: Divide and Conquer
Isolate the problem. In the overall system, remove one hardware or software component after another, until the 
problem is isolated to a small part of the whole system. As you divide a large problem into smaller components, you 
can analyze each component separately. You can use one or more of the following to help you divide and conquer on 
your own system:
	 In Windows, stop all nonessential services running in the background to eliminate them as the problem.
	 Boot from a bootable DVD to eliminate the OS and startup files on the hard drive as the problem.
	 Remove any unnecessary hardware devices, such as a second video card, optical drive, and even the hard drive.
Once down to the essentials, start exchanging components you know are good for those you suspect are bad, until 
the problem goes away. You don’t need to physically remove the optical drive or hard drive from the bays inside the 
case. Simply disconnect the data cable and the power cable.
Steps 4, 5, and 6: Fix the Problem, Verify the Fix, and Document 
the Outcome
After you understand the problem, you’re ready to plan steps to resolve the problem. After 
the fix, be sure to verify the system works. Perform one last hard boot and make sure 
everything works as expected. If you’re working with a user, ask the user to also verify 
the problem is fixed. In addition, ask yourself if anything could have been done to prevent 
the problem from happening in the first place. If so, take preventive action. Finally, most organizations 
require troubleshooting a computer problem be documented in a call tracking or help desk application 
where you are expected to record your findings, actions, and outcomes. Throughout the rest of this text, 
you’ll have many opportunities to practice the troubleshooting skills introduced here.

Special Concerns When Troubleshooting Mobile Device Hardware
When a component on a laptop or other mobile device needs replacing or upgrading, first you 
need to consider the warranty and how much time the repair will take. Before you decide to 
upgrade or repair an internal component, take into consideration these three alternatives:
A+  
220-901 
3.0
	 Return the mobile device to the manufacturer or another service center for repair. If the mobile 
device is under warranty, you need to return it to the manufacturer to do any serious repair work 
such as fixing a broken LCD panel on a laptop. However, for simple repair and upgrade tasks, such as 
upgrading memory or exchanging a hard drive on a laptop, most likely you can do these simple jobs 
by yourself without concern for voiding a warranty. Manufacturers allow a user to exchange the hard 
drive or memory when these components are accessible by way of a door or cover on the bottom of 
the laptop and it’s not necessary to open the case. If you’re not sure about the possibility of voiding the 
warranty, check with the manufacturer before you begin working on the mobile device. If the device is 
not under warranty and you don’t have the experience or time to fix a broken component, find out how 
much the manufacturer will charge to do the job. Also, consider taking the device to a mobile device 
repair shop. Know that some mobile device manufacturers refuse to sell internal components or service 
manuals that explain how to take the device apart except to authorized service centers. In this case, 
you have few options but to use the authorized service center for repairs.
	 Substitute an external component for an internal component. Replacing components on mobile 
devices can be time consuming and require a lot of patience. For a laptop, consider using BIOS 
setup to disable an internal component and then use an external device in its place. For example, 
if a keyboard fails, you can use a wireless keyboard with an access point connected to the USB port. 
Also, if the Ethernet port fails, the simplest solution might be to disable the port and use a USB 
network adapter to provide the Ethernet port.
	 Replace the internal device. Before deciding to replace an internal device that is not easy to get to, 
such as an LCD panel in a laptop, first find out if you can get the manufacturer documentation 
necessary to know how to open the laptop case and exchange the component. Also consider if the 
cost of parts and labor is worth more than the value of the device. Buying a new device might be 
the best solution for your customer.
Caution
Before you send a laptop or other device for repairs, if possible, back up any important data on the

Troubleshooting the Electrical System

Electrical problems can occur before or after the boot and can be consistent or intermittent. Many 
times repair technicians don’t recognize the cause of a problem to be electrical because of the 
intermittent nature of some electrical problems. In these situations, the hard drive, memory, the 
OS, or even user error might be suspected as the source of the problem and then systematically 
eliminated before the electrical system is suspected. This section will help you to be aware of symptoms of 
electrical problems so that you can zero in on the source of an electrical problem as quickly as possible.
Possible symptoms of a problem with the electrical system are:
	 The computer appears “dead”—no indicator lights and no spinning drive or fan.
	 The computer sometimes locks up during booting. After several tries, it boots successfully.
	 Error codes or beeps occur during booting, but they come and go.
	 You smell burnt parts or odors. (Definitely not a good sign!)
	 The computer powers down at unexpected times.
	 The computer appears dead, but you hear a whine coming from the power supply.
Without opening the computer case, the following list contains some questions you can ask and things 
you can do to solve a problem with the electrical system. The rule of thumb is “try the simple things first.” 
Most computer problems have simple solutions.
	 If you smell any burnt parts or odors, don’t try to turn the system on. Identify the component that is 
fried and replace it.
	 When you first plug up power to a system and hear a whine coming from the power supply, the power 
supply might be inadequate for the system or there might be a short. Don’t press the power button to 
start up the system. Unplug the power cord so that the power supply will not be damaged. The next step 
is to open the case and search for a short. If you don’t find a short, consider upgrading the power supply.
	 Is the power cord plugged in? If it is plugged into a power strip or surge suppressor, is the device turned 
on and also plugged in?
	 Is the power outlet controlled by a wall switch? If so, is the switch turned on?
	 Are any cable connections loose?
	 Is the circuit breaker blown? Is the house circuit overloaded?
	 Are all switches on the system turned on? Computer? Monitor? Surge suppressor or UPS 
(uninterruptible power supply)?
	 Is there a possibility the system has overheated? If so, wait a while and try again. If the system comes on, 
but later turns itself off, you might need additional cooling fans inside the unit. How to solve problems 
with overheating is covered later in this chapter.
	 Older computers might be affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI). Check for sources of electrical or 
magnetic interference such as fluorescent lighting or an electric fan or copier sitting near the computer case.

Now you’re ready to look at how to troubleshoot each subsystem that is critical to booting up the 
computer. We begin with the electrical system.
Troubleshooting the Electrical System
Your friend Sharon calls to ask for your help with a computer 
problem. Her system has been working fine for over a year, but now 
strange things are happening. Sometimes the system powers down for no apparent reason while she 
is working, and sometimes Windows locks up. As you read this section, look for clues as to what 
the problem might be. Also, as you read, think of questions to ask your friend that will help you 
diagnose the problem.

Supporting the Power System and Troubleshooting Computers
If the problem is still not solved, it’s time to look inside the case. First, turn off the computer, unplug it, 
press the power button to drain residual power, and then open the case. Next, do the following:
	 Check all power connections from the power supply to the motherboard and drives. Also, some cases require 
the case’s front panel be in place before the power-on button will work. Are all cards securely seated?
	 If you smell burnt parts, carefully search for shorts and frayed and burnt wires. Disassemble the parts 
until you find the one that is damaged.
	 If you suspect the power supply is bad, test it with a power supply tester.
Problems That Come and Go
If a system boots successfully to the Windows Start screen or desktop, you still might have a 
power system problem. Some problems are intermittent; that is, they come and go. Generally, 
intermittent problems are more difficult to solve than a dead system. There can be many 
causes of intermittent problems, such as an inadequate power supply, overheating, and devices 
and components damaged by ESD. Here are some symptoms that might indicate an intermittent problem 
with the electrical system after the boot:
	 The computer stops or hangs for no reason. Sometimes it might even reboot itself.
	 Memory errors appear intermittently.
	 Data is written incorrectly to the hard drive.
	 The keyboard stops working at odd times.
	 The motherboard fails or is damaged.
	 The power supply overheats and becomes hot to the touch.
	 The power supply fan whines and becomes very noisy or stops.
Here is what to do to eliminate the electrical system as the source of an intermittent problem:
1. Consider the power supply is inadequate. If the power supply is grossly inadequate, it will whine when 
you first plug up the power. If you have just installed new devices that are drawing additional power, 
verify the wattage rating of the power supply is adequate for the system.
 
You can also test the system to make sure you don’t have power problems by making all the devices 
in your system work at the same time. For instance, you can make two hard drives and the DVD drive 
work at the same time by copying files from one hard drive to the other while playing a movie on the 
DVD. If the new drive and the other drives each work independently, but data errors occur when all 
work at the same time, suspect a shortage of electrical power.
2. Suspect the power supply is faulty. You can test it using either a power supply tester (the easier method) 
or a multimeter (the more tedious method). However, know that a power supply that gives correct 
voltages when you measure it might still be the source of problems because power problems can be 
intermittent. Also be aware that an ATX power supply monitors the range of voltages provided to the 
motherboard and halts the motherboard if voltages are inadequate. Therefore, if the power supply 
appears “dead,” your best action is to replace it.
3. The power supply fan might not work. Don’t operate the computer if the fan does not work because 
computers without cooling fans can quickly overheat. Usually just before a fan stops working, it hums 
or whines, especially when the computer is first turned on. If this has just happened, replace the power 
supply. After you replace the power supply, if the new fan does not work, you have to dig deeper to find

Caution
Before opening the case of a brand name computer, such as a Gateway or Dell, consider the warranty. If 
the system is still under warranty, sometimes the warranty is voided if the case is opened. If the warranty prevents you 
from opening the case, you might need to return the system to a manufacturer’s service center for repairs.

the source of the problem. You can now assume the problem wasn’t the original fan. A short somewhere 
else in the system drawing too much power might cause the problem. To troubleshoot a nonfunctional fan, 
which might be a symptom of another problem and not a problem of the fan itself, follow these steps:
a.	 Turn off the power and remove all power cord connections to all components except the motherboard. 
Turn the power back on. If the fan works, the problem is with one of the systems you disconnected, not 
with the power supply, the fan, or the motherboard.
b.	Turn off the power and reconnect one card or drive at a time until you identify the device with the short.
c.	 If the fan does not work when all devices except the motherboard are disconnected, the problem is 
the motherboard or the power supply. Because you have already replaced the power supply, you can 
assume the problem is the motherboard and it’s time to replace it.
Power Problems with the Motherboard
A short might occur if some component on the motherboard makes improper contact with 
the chassis. This short can seriously damage the motherboard. For some cases, check for 
missing standoffs (small plastic or metal spacers that hold the motherboard a short distance 
away from the bottom of the case). A missing standoff most often causes these improper 
connections. Also check for loose standoffs or screws under the board that might be touching a wire on 
the bottom of the board and causing a short.
Shorts in the circuits on the motherboard might also cause problems. Look for damage on the 
bottom of the motherboard. These circuits are coated with plastic, and quite often damage is difficult 
to spot. Also look for burned-out capacitors that are spotted brown or corroded. You’ll see examples 
of burned-out capacitors later in the chapter.

Never replace a damaged motherboard with a good one without first testing or replacing the power 
supply. You don’t want to subject another good board to possible damage.

	 Have you added new devices to your system? (These new devices might be drawing too much power 
from an overworked power supply.)
	 Have you moved your computer recently? (It might be sitting beside a heat vent or electrical equipment.)
	 Does the system power down or hang after you have been working for some time? (This symptom 
might have more than one cause, such as overheating or a power supply, processor, memory, or 
motherboard about to fail.)
	 Has the computer case been opened recently? (Someone working inside the case might not have used 
a ground bracelet and components are now failing because of ESD damage.)
	 Are case vents free so that air can flow? (The case might be close to a curtain covering the vents.)
Intermittent problems like the one Sharon described are often heat related. If the system only hangs but does not 
power off, the problem might be caused by faulty memory or bad software, but because it actually powers down, you 
can assume the problem is related to power or heat.
If Sharon tells you that the system powers down after she’s been working for several hours, you can probably 
assume overheating. Check that first. If that’s not the problem, the next thing to do is replace the power supply.

Problems with Overheating
As a repair technician, you’re sure to eventually face problems with computers overheating. 
Overheating can happen as soon as you turn on the computer or after the computer has been 
working a while. Overheating can cause intermittent errors, the system to hang, or components 
to fail or not last as long as they normally would. (Overheating can significantly shorten the 
life span of the CPU and memory.) Overheating happens for many reasons, including improper installation 
of the CPU cooler or fans, overclocking, poor airflow inside the case, an underrated power supply, 
a component going bad, or the computer’s environment (for example, heat or dust).
Here are some symptoms that a system is overheating:
	 The system hangs or freezes at odd times or freezes just a few moments after the boot starts.
	 A Windows BSOD error occurs during the boot.
	 You cannot hear a fan running or the fan makes a whining sound.
	 You cannot feel air being pulled into or out of the case.

2. Excessive dust insulates components and causes them to overheat. Use compressed air, a blower, or an 
antistatic vacuum to remove dust from the power supply, the vents over the entire computer, and the 
processor cooler fan (see Figure 5-20). To protect the fan, don’t allow it to spin as you blow air into it. 
Overspinning might damage a fan.
1. If the system refuses to boot or hangs after a 
period of activity, suspect overheating. Immediately 
after the system hangs, go into UEFI/BIOS 
setup and find the screen that reports the CPU 
temperature. The temperature should not exceed 
that recommended by the CPU manufacturer.
If you suspect overheating, go into UEFI/BIOS 
screens and view the temperature monitors for the 
system. To protect the expensive processor and other 
components, you can also purchase a temperature 
sensor. The sensor plugs into a power connection 
coming from the power supply and mounts on the 
side of the case or in a drive bay. The sensor sounds 
an alarm when the inside of the case becomes too 
hot. To decide which temperature sensor to buy, use 
one recommended by the case manufacturer. You can 
also install utility software that can monitor system 
temperatures. For example, SpeedFan by Alfredo 
Comparetti is freeware that can monitor fan speeds 
and temperatures (see Figure 5-19). A good website 
to download the freeware is www.filehippo.com/
download_speedfan. Be careful to not download 
other freeware available on the site.
Here are some simple things you can do to solve 
an overheating problem:

3. Check airflow inside the case. Are all fans running? You might need to replace a fan. Is there an empty 
fan slot on the rear of the case? If so, install a case fan in the slot (see Figure 5-21). Orient the fan so that 
it blows air out of the case. The power cord to the fan can connect to a fan header on the motherboard 
or to a power connector coming directly from the power supply.

Notes When working in a customer’s office or home, be sure you clean up any mess you create from blowing dust 
out of a computer case.
4. If there are other fan slots on the side or front of the case, you can also install fans in these slots. 
However, don’t install more fans than the case is designed to use.
5. Can the side of the case hold a chassis air guide that guides outside air to the processor? If it has a slot 
for the guide and the guide is missing, install one. However, don’t install a guide that obstructs the CPU 
cooler. How to install an air guide is covered later in this section.

6. A case is generally designed for optimal airflow when slot openings on the front and rear of the case are 
covered and when the case cover is securely in place. To improve airflow, replace missing faceplates over 
empty drive bays and replace missing slot covers over empty expansion slots. See Figure 5-22.
7. Are cables in the way of airflow? Use tie wraps to secure cables and cords so that they don’t block 
airflow across the processor or get in the way of fans turning. Figure 5-23 shows the inside of a case 
where cables are tied up and neatly out of the way of airflow from the front to the rear of the case.
8. A case needs some room to breathe. Place it so there are at least a few inches of space on both sides 
and the top of the case. If the case is sitting on carpet, put it on a computer stand so that air can 
circulate under the case and also to reduce carpet dust inside the case. Many cases have a vent on 
the bottom front of the case and carpet can obstruct airflow into this vent (see Figure 5-24). Make 
sure drapes are not hanging too close to fan openings.

9. Verify the cooler is connected properly to the processor. If it doesn’t fit well, the system might not boot 
and certainly the processor will overheat. If the cooler is not tightly connected to the motherboard and 
processor or the cooler fan is not working, the processor will quickly overheat as soon as the computer 
is turned on. Has thermal compound been installed between the cooler and processor?
10. After you close the case, leave your system off for at least 30 minutes. When you power up the computer 
again, let it run for 10 minutes, go into UEFI/BIOS setup, check the temperature readings, and reboot. 
Next, let your system run until it shuts down. Power it up again and check the temperature in UEFI/
BIOS setup again. A significant difference in this reading and the first one you took after running the 
computer for 10 minutes indicates an overheating problem.
11. Check UEFI/BIOS setup to see if the processor is being overclocked. Overclocking can cause a system 
to overheat. Try restoring the processor and system bus frequencies to default values.
12. Have too many peripherals been installed inside the case? Is the case too small for all these peripherals? 
Larger tower cases are better designed for good airflow than smaller slimline cases. Also, when installing 
cards, try to leave an empty slot between each card for better airflow. The same goes for drives. Try not 
to install a group of drives in adjacent drive bays. For better airflow, leave empty bays between drives. 
Take a close look at Figure 5-23, where you can see space between each drive installed in the system.
13. Flash UEFI/BIOS to update the firmware on the motherboard. How to flash UEFI/BIOS is covered in 
the chapter, “All About Motherboards.”
14. Thermal compound should last for years, but eventually it will harden and need replacing. If the 
system is several years old, replace the thermal compound.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to recognize that a given symptom is possibly power or heat related.
If you try the preceding list of things to do and still have an overheating problem, it’s time to move on 
to more drastic solutions. Consider whether the case design allows for good airflow; the problem might be 
caused by poor air circulation inside the case. The power supply fan in ATX cases blows air out of the case, 
pulling outside air from the vents in the front of the case across the processor to help keep it cool. Another 
exhaust fan is usually installed on the back of the case to help the power supply fan pull air through the 
case. In addition, most processors require a cooler with a fan installed on top of the processor. Figure 5-25 
shows a good arrangement of vents and fans for proper airflow and a poor arrangement.

For better ventilation, use a power supply that has vents on the bottom and front of the power supply, 
as shown in Figure 5-26. Compare that with the power supply in Figure 5-21 that has vents only on the 
front and not on the bottom.

An intake fan on the front of the case might help pull air into the case. Intel recommends you use a front 
intake fan for high-end systems, but AMD says a front fan for ATX systems is not necessary. Check with 
the processor and case manufacturers for specific instructions as to the placement of fans and what type 
of fan and heat sink to use.
Intel and AMD both recommend a chassis air guide (CAG) as part of the case design. This air guide is 
a round air duct that helps to pull and direct fresh air from outside the case to the cooler and processor 
(see Figure 5-27). The guide should reach inside the case very close to the cooler, but not touch it. Intel 
recommends the clearance be no greater than 20mm and no less than 12mm. If the guide obstructs the 
cooler, you can remove the guide, but optimum airflow will not be achieved.

Be careful when trying to solve an overheating problem. Excessive heat can damage the CPU and the 
motherboard. Never operate a system if the case fan, power-supply fan, or cooler fan is not working.
Blow Dust Out of a Case
If necessary, open the case cover to your desktop computer. Using a can of compressed air, blow the 
dust away from all fans and other components inside the case. Be careful to not touch components 
unless you are properly grounded. When you’re done, close the case cover.

For best battery charge times, some laptops can use two batteries. For example, the laptop in Figure 5-30 
uses a second battery called a sheet battery that fits on the bottom of the laptop. The two batteries together 
give about 12 hours of use between charges. The sheet battery comes with an adapter so you can charge it 
when it’s disconnected from the laptop.
Figure 5-30  The second battery for this laptop is a sheet battery that attaches to 
the bottom of the laptop and adds up to six hours to the battery charge
Here are some problems you might encounter with laptop power systems and their solutions:
	 If power is not getting to the system or the battery indicator light is lit when the AC adapter should 
be supplying power, verify the AC adapter is plugged into a live electrical outlet. Is the light on the 
AC adapter lit? Check if the AC adapter’s plug is secure in the electrical outlet. Check the connections 
on both sides of the AC adapter transformer. Check the connection at the DC jack on the laptop. Try 
exchanging the AC adapter for one you know is good. The DC jack might need replacing. Most laptops 
allow you to replace the DC jack without replacing the entire system board. Check the service manual 
for the laptop to see how labor-intensive is the repair before you decide to proceed.
	 If the battery is not charging when the AC adapter is plugged in, the problem might be with the battery 
or the motherboard. A hot battery might not charge until it cools down. If the battery is hot, remove it 
Notes If you’re using the AC adapter to power your laptop when the power goes out, the installed battery serves as a 
built-in UPS. The battery immediately takes over as your uninterruptible power supply (UPS). Also, a laptop has an internal 
surge protector. However, for extra protection, you might want to use a power strip that provides surge protection.

from the computer and allow it to cool to room temperature. Check the battery for physical damage. 
If the battery is swollen or warped, replace it. If it shows no physical signs of damage, try to recharge it. 
If it does not recharge, replace the battery pack. If a known-good battery does not recharge, you have 
three options: (1) Replace the system board, (2) replace the laptop, or (3) use the laptop only when it’s 
connected to power using the AC adapter.
Test an AC Adapter
If the system fails only when the AC adapter is connected, it might be defective. Try a new AC 
adapter, or, if you have a multimeter, use it to verify the voltage output of the adapter. Do the 
following for an adapter with a single center pin connector:
1.	 Unplug the AC adapter from the computer, but leave it plugged into the electrical outlet.
2.	 Using a multimeter set to measure voltage in the 1 to 20 V DC range, place the red probe of the multimeter 
in the center of the DC connector that would normally plug into the DC outlet on the laptop. Place the black 
probe on the outside cylinder of the DC connector (see Figure 5-31).
3.	 The voltage range should be plus or minus 5 percent of the accepted voltage. For example, if a laptop is 
designed to use 16 V, the voltage should measure somewhere between 15.2 and 16.8 V DC.

Troubleshooting the Motherboard, Processor, and RAM
The field replaceable units (FRUs) on a motherboard are the processor, the processor cooler 
assembly, RAM, and the CMOS battery. Also, the motherboard itself is an FRU. As you troubleshoot 
the motherboard and discover that some component is not working, such as a network port, you 
might be able to disable that component in UEFI/BIOS setup and install a card to take its place.
A+  
220-901 
4.1
When you suspect a bad component, a good troubleshooting technique is to substitute a known-good 
component for the one you suspect is bad. Be cautious here. A friend once had a computer that wouldn’t 
boot. He replaced the hard drive, with no change. He replaced the motherboard next. The computer booted 
up with no problem; he was delighted, until it failed again. Later he discovered that a faulty power supply 
had damaged his original motherboard. When he traded the bad one for a good one, the new motherboard 
also got zapped! If you suspect problems with the power supply, check the voltage coming from the power 
supply before putting in a new motherboard.
Symptoms that a motherboard, processor, or memory module is failing can appear as:
	 The system begins to boot but then powers down.
	 An error message is displayed during the boot. Investigate this message.
	 The system reports less memory than you know is installed.
	 The system becomes unstable, hangs, or freezes at odd times. (This symptom can have multiple 
causes, including a failing power supply, RAM, hard drive, motherboard or processor, Windows 
errors, and overheating.)
	 Intermittent Windows or hard drive errors occur.
	 Components on the motherboard or devices connected to it don’t work.
Remember the troubleshooting principle to check the simple things first. The motherboard and processor 
are expensive and time consuming to replace. Unless you’re certain the problem is one of these two 
components, don’t replace either until you first eliminate other components as the source of the problem.
If you can boot the system, follow these steps to eliminate Windows, software, RAM, BIOS settings, 
and other software and hardware components as the source of the problem:
1. If an error message appears, Google the error message. Pay particular attention to hits on the motherboard 
or processor manufacturer or Microsoft websites. Search forums for information about the error.
2. The problem might be a virus. If you can boot the system, run a current version of antivirus software 
to check for viruses.
3. A memory module might be failing. In Windows 8/7/Vista, use the Memory Diagnostics tool to test 
memory. Even if Windows is not installed, you can still run the tool by booting the system from the 
Windows setup DVD. How to use the Memory Diagnostics tool is coming up later in this chapter.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know how to troubleshoot problems with motherboards, 
processors, and RAM.
4. Suspect the problem is caused by an application or by Windows. In Windows, the best tool to check 
for potential hardware problems is Device Manager.
5. In Windows, download and install any Windows updates or patches. These updates might solve a 
hardware or application problem.
Notes Other than the Windows Memory Diagnostics tool, you can use the Memtest86 utility to test installed memory 
modules. Check the site www.memtest86.com to download this program.

6. Ask yourself what has changed since the problem began. If the problem began immediately after 
installing a new device or application, uninstall the device or applications.
7. A system that does not have enough RAM can sometimes appear to be unstable. Using the System 
window, find out how much RAM is installed, and compare that with the recommended amounts. 
Consider upgrading RAM.
8. The UEFI/BIOS might be corrupted or have wrong settings. Check UEFI/BIOS setup. Have settings been tampered 
with? Is the CPU speed set incorrectly or is it overclocked? Reset UEFI/BIOS setup to restore default settings.
9. Disable any quick booting features in UEFI/BIOS so that you get a thorough report of POST. Then look 
for errors reported on the screen during the boot.
10. Flash BIOS to update the firmware on the board.
11. Check the motherboard manufacturer’s website for diagnostic software that might identify a problem 
with the motherboard.
12. Update all drivers of motherboard components that are not working. For example, if the USB 
ports are not working, try updating the USB drivers with those downloaded from the motherboard 
manufacturer’s website. This process can also update the chipset drivers.
13. If an onboard port or device isn’t working, but the motherboard is stable, follow these steps:
a. Verify the problem is not with the device using the port. Try moving the device to another port on 
the same computer or move the device to another computer. If it works there, return it to this port. 
The problem might have been a bad connection.
b. Go into UEFI/BIOS setup and verify the port is enabled.
c. Check Device Manager and verify Windows recognizes the device or port with no errors. 
For example, Device Manager shown in Figure 5-32 reports the onboard Wi-Fi adapter is disabled. 
Try to enable the device.
Notes Another useful Windows tool for troubleshooting hardware problems is Event Viewer, which reports logs of 
hardware and application errors. A Real Problems, Real Solutions activity at the end of this chapter gives you experience 
using Event Viewer.

d.	Next try updating the motherboard drivers for this device from the motherboard manufacturer’s 
website.
e. If you have a loopback plug, use it to test the port.
f. If the problem is still not solved, disable the port in BIOS setup and install an expansion card to 
provide the same type of port or connector.
14. Suspect the problem is caused by a failing hard drive. How to troubleshoot a failing drive is covered in 
the chapter, “Supporting Hard Drives and Other Storage Devices.”
15. Suspect the problem is caused by overheating. How to check for overheating is covered earlier in this 
chapter.
16. Verify the installed processor is supported by the motherboard. Perhaps someone has installed the 
wrong processor.
Use Windows Memory Diagnostics
Errors with memory are often difficult to diagnose because they can appear intermittently and might 
be mistaken as application errors, user errors, or other hardware component errors. Sometimes these 
errors cause the system to hang, a blue screen error might occur, or the system continues to function 
with applications giving errors or data getting corrupted. You can quickly identify a problem with 
memory or eliminate memory as the source of a problem by using the Windows 8/7/Vista Memory Diagnostics tool. 
Use one of these two methods to start the utility:
	Use the mdsched.exe command from within Windows. To open a command prompt window from the 
Windows 8 desktop, right-click Start and click Command Prompt. (In Windows 7, click Start, enter command 
or cmd, and press Enter.) In the command prompt window, enter mdsched.exe and press Enter. A dialog box 
appears (see Figure 5-33) asking if you want to run the test now or on the next restart.
Applying  Concepts
	Boot from the Windows setup DVD. If Windows is not the installed operating system or you cannot boot from 
the hard drive, boot the computer from the Windows setup DVD. On the opening screen, select your language. 
On the next screen (see Figure 5-34), click Repair your computer. For Windows 8, in the following boxes, click 
Troubleshoot and then Advanced options. On the Advanced options screen, click Command Prompt. At the 
command prompt, enter mdsched.exe and press Enter. For Windows 7, select the Windows installation to 
repair. On the System Recovery Options screen (see Figure 5-35), click Windows Memory Diagnostic.

Use Device Manager to Delete  
the Driver Store
One thing you can do to solve a problem with a device is to uninstall and reinstall the device. When 
you first install a device, Windows stores a copy of the driver package in a driver store. When you 
uninstall the device, you can tell Windows to also delete the driver store. If you don’t delete the 
driver store, Windows uses it when you install the device again. That’s why the second time you 
install the same device Windows does not ask you for the location of the drivers. Windows might also use the 
driver store to automatically install the device on the next reboot without your involvement.
All this is convenient unless there is a problem with the driver store. To get a true fresh start with an installation, 
you need to delete the driver store. To do that, first sign in to Windows using an account with administrative 
privileges and then follow these steps:
1.	 To open Device Manager from the Windows 8 desktop, right-click Start and click Device Manager. (In 
Windows 7, click Start and click Control Panel. In Control Panel Classic icon view, click Device Manager.) 
Device Manager opens.
Applying  Concepts
2.	 Right-click the device and click Properties in the shortcut menu. Click the Driver tab and click Uninstall. 
In the Confirm Device Uninstall box, check Delete the driver software for this device, and click OK. 
See Figure 5-36. The installed drivers and the driver store are both deleted. When you reinstall the device, 
you’ll need the drivers on CD or downloaded from the web.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to be familiar with Control Panel in Classic icon view. 
If Control Panel is showing Category view, click Category, and then click Large icons or Small icons.
Figure 5-36  Use Device Manager to uninstall the drivers and delete the driver store for a device
Also know if the check box is missing on the Confirm Device Uninstall box, the drivers are embedded in Windows 
and you cannot delete the driver store for these devices. Examples of these devices are the optical drive, hard drive, 
and generic keyboard, which all have embedded Windows drivers.

Troubleshooting the Motherboard, Processor, and RAM
5
We’re working our way through what to do when the system locks up, gives errors, or generally appears 
unstable. Another problem that can occur at the boot is continuous reboots, which can be caused by 
overheating, a failing processor, motherboard, or RAM, or a corrupted Windows installation. For Windows 8, 
many continuous restart errors can be solved by performing a Startup Repair process. Follow these steps:
1. Boot from the Windows 8 setup DVD. (You might need to first change the boot priority order in UEFI/
BIOS setup to boot first from the optical drive.)
2. On the opening screen, select your language. On the next screen (refer back to Figure 5-34), click Repair 
your computer. Next click Troubleshoot and then Advanced options. On the Advanced options screen 
(see Figure 5-37), click Startup Repair and follow directions on screen.
Figure 5-37  Startup Repair on the Advanced options menu can solve problems launching Windows 8
For Windows 7/Vista, error messages disappear before they can be read as the system reboots. To 
disable these automatic restarts, press F8 as Windows starts up. The Advanced Boot Options menu 
appears (see Figure 5-38). Select Disable automatic restart on system failure. When you restart Windows,

Supporting the Power System and Troubleshooting Computers
the error message stays on screen long enough for you to read it. Search the Microsoft websites (support 
.microsoft.com and technet.microsoft.com) for information about the hardware component causing the 
problem and what to do about it. BSOD errors might apply to the motherboard, video card, RAM, 
processor, hard drive, or some other device for which Windows is trying to load device drivers.
If you have checked Windows and UEFI/BIOS settings and searched the web for help and still have not 
identified the source of the problem, it’s time to open the case and check inside. As you do so, be sure 
to use an ESD strap and follow other procedures to protect the system against ESD. With the case open, 
follow these steps:
1. Check that all the power and data cables the system is using are securely connected. Try reseating all 
expansion cards and DIMM modules.
2. Look for physical damage on the motherboard. Look for frayed traces on the bottom of the board or 
discolored, distended, or bulging capacitors on the board.
3. Reduce the system to essentials. Remove any unnecessary hardware, such as expansion cards, and then 
watch to see if the problem goes away. If the problem goes away, replace one component at a time until 
the problem returns and you have identified the component causing the trouble.
4. Try using a POST diagnostic card. It might offer you a clue as to which component is giving a problem.
5. Suspect the problem is caused by a failing power supply. It’s less expensive and easier to replace than the 
motherboard or processor, so eliminate it as a cause before you move on to the motherboard or processor.
6. Exchange the processor.
7. Exchange the motherboard, but before you do, measure the voltage output of the power supply or simply 
replace it, in case it is producing too much power and has damaged the board.
Discolored Capacitors
Jessica complained to Wally, her IT support technician, that Windows was occasionally giving errors, 
data would get corrupted, or an application would not work as it should. At first, Wally suspected 
Jessica might need a little more training on how to open and close an application or save a file, but 
he discovered user error was not the problem. He tried reinstalling the application software Jessica 
most often used, and even reinstalled Windows, but the problems persisted.
Applying  Concepts
Wally began to suspect a hardware problem. Carefully examining the motherboard revealed the source of the 
problem: failing capacitors. Look carefully at Figure 5-39 and you can see five bad discolored capacitors with 
bulging heads. (Know that sometimes a leaking capacitor can also show crusty corrosion at the base of the 
capacitor.) When Wally replaced the motherboard, the problems went away.
Notes Catastrophic errors (errors that cause the system to not boot or a device to not work) are much easier 
to resolve than intermittent errors (errors that come and go).

Troubleshooting Mobile Devices
Here is what to do for problems with a cell phone that is overheating:
A+  
220-901 
4.5
	 Check if the heat is coming from the bottom of the cell phone where the battery is located. 
If so, try these things:
	 Use a different AC adapter to charge the battery.
	 If the phone is not under warranty, open the case and examine the battery for damage. 
Is it swollen or warped? If so, replace the battery. If the phone is under warranty, lay the 
phone on a flat surface. If the phone appears warped, take it in for repair.
	 If heat is coming from other areas of the phone, try these things:
	 Too many apps might be open. Close all apps you’re not currently using.
	 Follow troubleshooting steps for your phone’s operating system to resolve the problem. These steps 
include updating the OS. For more information, see the chapter, “Supporting Mobile Operating Systems.”
	 The phone processor might be overworked by streaming data (watching a movie online), playing 
a game, or texting. Allow the phone to rest and cool down.
	 Consider removing the phone from a case that doesn’t allow heat to dissipate.
If you decide the battery is the problem, check if the phone is under warranty. If not, you are likely 
to find teardown directions to replace the battery online. For example, at ifixit.com the kit to replace the 
iPhone 5 battery includes the battery, tools, and directions (see Figure 5-40). You can also watch videos 
on the site to step you through the process.
Figure 5-40  At www.ifixit.com, you can purchase tools, parts, and instructions 
to replace an iPhone battery

Notes Some Android cell phones will provide information about the device when you enter *#*#4636#*#* in the 
phone keypad. In the screen that appears, select Battery Information. If the Battery Health screen reports “unknown,” 
suspect a bad battery. The temperature of the battery is also reported on this screen, which should be less than 40°C.
Here are some other problems and solutions for cell phones and phablets:
	 For a frozen system, do the following:
	 For the iPhone or iPad, reset the device. To do so, hold down the Wake/sleep button and the Home 
button at the same time for at least 10 seconds until the Apple logo appears.

	 For a frozen Android device, you can reboot the system by following manufacturer directions for a 
reboot for the specific device. As a last resort, you can open the back of the device and remove and 
reinstall the battery.
	 For Windows Phone, first try holding down the Power button and then swipe Slide down to power 
off. Power back up your phone. If that doesn’t work, press and hold the Volume Down and Power 
buttons at the same time for at least 10 seconds until you feel a vibration. If that doesn’t work, open 
the back of the device and remove and reinstall the battery.
	 When the battery charge lasts an extremely short time, first try exchanging the AC adapter (charger). If 
that doesn’t work, exchange the battery unless the device is under warranty.
	 When installing apps that don’t load or load slowly, a hot or failing battery might be the problem. Other 
problems might be a failing network connection. Reset the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection. If your device 
is connected to your computer with a USB connection, check the USB connection.
	 For slow performance, close apps you’re not using, clean Android cached data, and disable live wallpa-
pers. Consider performing a factory reset and start over by installing only the apps you actually use. For 
more information, see the chapter, “Supporting Mobile Operating Systems.”
	 Email encryption is done using a public key and private key. You distribute your public key to those 
who want to send you encrypted email and you keep the private key on your device. If your device 
is unable to decrypt email, most likely you’ll need to generate a new public key and private key and 
distribute your new public key to those who send you encrypted email.
Lessons Learned
Sophia is putting together a computer from parts for the first time. She has decided to keep costs 
low and is installing an AMD processor on a microATX motherboard, using all low-cost parts. She 
installed the hard drive, optical drive, and power supply in the computer case. Then she installed 
the motherboard in the case, followed by the processor, cooler, and memory. Before powering up the 
system, she checked all connections to make sure they were solid and read through the motherboard 
documentation to make sure she did not forget anything important. Next, she plugs in the monitor to the onboard 
video port and then plugs in the keyboard and power cord. She takes a deep breath and turns on the power switch 
on the back of the computer. Immediately, she hears a faint whine, but she’s not sure what is making the noise. 
When she presses the power button on the front of the case, nothing happens. No fans, no lights. Here are the 
steps Sophia takes to troubleshoot the problem:
1.	 She turns off the power switch and unplugs the power cord. She remembers to put on her ground bracelet 
and carefully checks all power connections. Everything looks okay.
2.	 She plugs in the system and presses the power button again. Still all she hears is the faint whine.
3.	 She presses the power button a second and third time. Suddenly a loud pop followed by smoke comes from 
the power supply, and the strong smell of electronics fills the room! Sophia jumps back in dismay.
4.	 She removes a known-good power supply from another computer, disconnects the blown power supply, 
and connects the good one to the computer. When she turns on the power switch, she hears that same faint 
whine. Quickly she turns off the switch and unplugs the power cord. She does not want to lose another 
power supply!
5.	 Next, Sophia calls technical support of the company that sold her the computer parts. A very helpful 
technician listens carefully to the details and tells Sophia that the problem sounds like a short in the 
system. He explains that a power supply might whine if too much power is being drawn. As Sophia hangs up 
the phone, she begins to think that the problem might be with the motherboard installation.

6.	 She removes the motherboard from the case, and the source of the problem is evident: She forgot to install 
spacers between the board and the case. The board was sitting directly on the bottom of the case, which had 
caused the short.
7.	 Sophia installs the spacers and reinstalls the motherboard. Using the good power supply, she turns on the 
system. The whine is gone, but the system is dead.
8.	 Sophia purchases a new power supply and motherboard, and this time, carefully uses spacers in every hole 
used by the motherboard screws. Figure 5-41 shows one installed spacer and one ready to be installed. The 
system comes up without a problem.
In evaluating her experience with her first computer build, Sophia declares the project a success. She was grateful 
she had decided to use low-cost parts for her first build. She learned much from the experience and will never, ever 
forget to use spacers. She told a friend, “I made a serious mistake, but I learned from it. I feel confident I know 
how to put a system together now, and I’m ready to tackle another build. When you make mistakes and get past 
them, your confidence level actually grows because you learn you can face a serious problem and solve it.”

Cooling Methods and Devices
	Devices that are used to keep a processor and system cool include CPU coolers and fans, thermal 
compound, case fans, heat sinks, and liquid cooling.
	Liquid cooling systems use liquids pumped through the system to keep it cool and are sometimes used 
by hobbyists when overclocking a system.
Selecting a Power Supply
	Important features of a power supply to consider when purchasing it are its form factor, wattage 
capacity, number and type of connectors it provides, and warranty.
	To decide on the wattage capacity of a power supply, add up the wattage requirements for all 
components in a system and then increase that total by about 30 percent. The wattage provided by 
the +12 V rail is also important.

Chapter Summary
How to Approach a Hardware Problem
	If possible, always begin troubleshooting a computer problem by interviewing the user. Find out when 
the problem started and what happened about the time it started. You also need to know if important 
data on the computer is not backed up. When troubleshooting, set your priorities based on user needs.
	Sources that can help with hardware troubleshooting are the web, online technical support and forums, 
diagnostic software, user manuals, and your network of technical associates.
	When troubleshooting, check the simple things first. For example, you can scan for viruses, test RAM, 
and run diagnostic software before you begin the process of replacing expensive components.
	Decide if a computer problem occurs before or after a successful boot and if it is caused by hardware or 
software. After you have fixed the problem, verify the fix and document the outcome.
	When troubleshooting mobile devices, consider the warranty and that replacing a component might cost 
more than replacing the device. If possible, substitute an external component for an internal one.
Troubleshooting the Electrical System
	To determine if a system is getting power, listen for spinning fans or drives and look for indicator lights.
	Use a power supply tester to test the power supply.
	Intermittent problems that come and go are the most difficult to solve and can be caused by hardware 
or software. The power supply, motherboard, RAM, processor, hard drive, and overheating can cause 
intermittent problems.
	Removing dust from a system, providing for proper ventilation, and installing extra fans can help to 
keep a system from overheating.
	The battery and the DC jack are considered field replaceable units in a laptop that pertain to the power 
system.
	Use a multimeter to check the voltage output of an AC adapter.
Troubleshooting the Motherboard, Processor, and RAM
	UEFI/BIOS gives beep codes when a POST error occurs during the boot before it tests video.
	Error messages on a black screen during the boot are usually put there by startup UEFI/BIOS dur-
ing POST.
	Error messages on a blue screen during or after the boot are put there by Windows and are called the 
blue screen of death (BSOD).
	The motherboard, processor, RAM, processor cooler assembly, and CMOS battery are field replaceable 
units.
	An unstable system that freezes or hangs at odd times can be caused by a faulty power supply, RAM, 
hard drive, motherboard, or processor, Windows error, or overheating.
	A POST diagnostic card can troubleshoot problems with the motherboard.
Troubleshooting Mobile Devices
	A mobile device battery that overheats or quickly loses its charge might need replacing, but first try 
replacing the AC adapter (charger).
	For a frozen system, try resetting an iPhone or iPad, rebooting an Android device, or resetting Windows 
Phone. You can also try removing the battery and reinstalling it.

Figure 5-42  Use Event Viewer to find logs that can help with troubleshooting hardware problems
>> Real Problems, Real Solutions
Real Problem 5-1 Replacing a Power Supply
Suppose you turn on a system and everything is dead—no lights, nothing on the monitor screen, and no 
spinning fan or hard drive. You verify the power to the system works, all power connections and power 
cords are securely connected, and all pertinent switches are turned on. You can assume the power supply 
has gone bad. It’s time to replace it. To prepare for this situation in a real work environment, exchange 
power supplies with another student in your lab who is using a computer that has a power supply rated at 
about the same wattage as yours. Then verify that your system starts up and works.
Real Problem 5-2 Using Event Viewer to Troubleshoot a Hardware Problem
Just about anything that happens in Windows is recorded in Event Viewer (Eventvwr.msc). You can find 
events such as a hardware or network failure, OS error messages, or a device that has failed to start. When 
you first encounter a Windows, hardware, application, or security problem, get in the habit of checking 
Event Viewer as one of your first steps toward investigating the problem. To save time, first check the 
Administrative Events log because it filters out all events except Warning and Error events, which are the 
most useful for troubleshooting. Do the following to practice using Event Viewer:
1.		 For Windows 8, press Win+X, click Run, and enter eventvwr.msc. For Windows 7, enter eventvwr.msc 
in the Search box. Event Viewer opens. Drill down into the Custom Views list in the left pane and click 
Administrative Events. Scroll through the list of Error or Warning events and list any that indicate a 
possible hardware problem. Make note of the first event in the list.
2.		 Disconnect the network cable.
3.		 In the Event Viewer menu bar, click Action and Refresh to refresh the list of events. How many new 
events do you see? Click each new event to see its details below the list of events until you find the 
event that tells you the network cable was unplugged. Figure 5-42 shows Event Viewer for Windows 7. 
Describe the details of the event about the network cable.
4.		 Tinker around with other hardware on your computer. What actions did you take that triggered a 
Warning or Error event in Event Viewer?

Real Problem 5-3 Troubleshooting a Hung System
A user complains to you that her system hangs for no known reason. After asking her a few questions, you 
identify these symptoms:
	The system hangs after about 15–20 minutes of operation.
	When the system hangs, it doesn’t matter what application is open or how many applications are open.
	When the system hangs, it appears as though power is turned off: There are no lights, spinning drives, 
or other evidence of power.
You suspect overheating might be the problem. To test your theory, you decide to do the following:
1.		 You want to verify that the user has not overclocked the system. How do you do that?
2.		 You decide to check for overheating by examining the temperature of the system immediately after the 
system is powered up and then again immediately after the system hangs. Describe the steps you take 
to do this.
3.		 After doing the first two steps, you decide overheating is the cause of the problem. What are four 
things you can do to fix the problem?

Supporting Hard Drives 
and Other Storage Devices
T
he hard drive is the most important permanent storage device in a 
computer, and supporting hard drives is one of the more important 
tasks of a computer support technician. This chapter introduces the 
different kinds of hard drive technologies and the ways a computer 
interfaces with a hard drive. You learn how to select and install 
the different types of hard drives and how to troubleshoot hard 
drive problems. You also learn about tape drives and how to select 
and install optical drives in desktops and laptops. The chapter also 
covers flash memory cards, including which type of card to buy for 
a particular need.

Hard Drive Technologies and Interface Standards
A hard disk drive (HDD), most often called a hard drive, comes in two sizes for personal 
computers: the 2.5" size is used for laptop computers and the 3.5" size is used for desktops. 
See Figure 6-1. In addition, a smaller 1.8" size hard drive (about the size of a credit card) is 
used in some low-end laptops and other equipment such as MP3 players.

Now let’s look at the technologies used inside a hard drive and then we’ll turn to how the drive interfaces 
with the computer.
Technologies Used inside a Hard Drive
The two types of hardware technologies used inside the drive are solid-state and magnetic. 
In addition, some drives use a combination of both technologies. Here are important details 
about each:
A+  
220-901 
1.5, 1.7, 
1.11
	 Solid-state drive. A solid-state drive (SSD), also called a solid-state device (SSD), is called solid-state 
because it has no moving parts. The drives are built using nonvolatile memory, which is similar to that 
used for USB flash drives. Recall that this type of memory does not lose its data even after the power 
is turned off.
In an SSD drive, flash memory is stored on EEPROM (Electronically Erasable Programmable  
Read-Only Memory) chips inside the drive housing. The chips contain grids of rows and columns with 
two transistors at each intersection that hold a 0 or 1 bit. One of these transistors is called a floating gate 
and accepts the 0 or 1 state according to a logic test called NAND (stands for “Not AND”). Therefore, 
the memory in an SSD is called NAND flash memory. EEPROM chips are limited as to the number of 
times transistors can be reprogrammed. Therefore, the life span of an SSD drive is based on the number 
of write operations to the drive. (The number of read operations does not affect the life span.) For 
example, one SSD manufacturer guarantees its SSD drives for 20 GB of write operations per day  
for three years. For normal use, a drive would not be used that much and would last much longer.
Notes In technical documentation, you might see a hard drive abbreviated as HDD (hard disk drive). However, this 
chapter uses the term hard drive.

	 Magnetic hard drive. A magnetic hard drive has one, two, or more platters, or disks, that stack together and 
spin in unison inside a sealed metal housing that contains firmware to control reading and writing data to the 
drive and to communicate with the motherboard. The top and bottom of each disk have a read/write head 
that moves across the disk surface as all the disks rotate on a spindle (see Figure 6-3). All the read/write heads 
are controlled by an actuator, which moves the read/write heads across the disk surfaces in unison. The disk 
surfaces are covered with a magnetic medium that can hold data as magnetized spots. The spindle rotates at 
5400, 7200, or 10,000 RPM (revolutions per minute). The faster the spindle, the better performing the drive.
Because flash memory is expensive, solid-state drives are much more expensive than magnetic hard 
drives, but they are faster, more reliable, last longer, and use less power than magnetic drives. Figure 6-2 
shows two sizes of solid-state drives (2.5" and 1.8") and what the inside of an SSD hard drive looks 
like. The 1.8” drives are used in some laptops and other small mobile devices.

Notes Many solid-state drive manufacturers reserve blocks on the drive that are used when blocks begin to prove 
they are no longer reliable. Also, a technique called wear leveling assures that the logical block addressing does not 
always address the same physical blocks in order to distribute write operations more evenly across the device.

Supporting Hard Drives and Other Storage Devices
Data is organized on a magnetic hard drive in concentric circles called tracks (see Figure 6-4). Each 
track is divided into segments called sectors (also called records). Older hard drives used sectors that 
contained 512 bytes. Most current hard drives use 4096-byte sectors.
Figure 6-4  A hard drive is divided into tracks and sectors; several sectors make 
one cluster
One sector
One track
	 Hybrid hard drives. A hybrid hard drive (H-HDD), sometimes called a solid-state hybrid drive (SSHD), 
uses both technologies. The flash component serves as a buffer to improve drive performance. Some 
hybrid drives perform just as well as an SSD drive. For a hybrid drive to function, the operating 
system must support it.
Before a magnetic drive leaves the factory, sector markings are written to it in a process called low-level 
formatting. (This formatting is different from the high-level formatting that Windows does after a drive is 
installed in a computer.) The hard drive firmware, UEFI/BIOS on the motherboard, and the OS use a simple 
sequential numbering system called logical block addressing (LBA) to address all the sectors on the drive. 
SSD drives are marked into blocks, which are communicated to the motherboard and OS, which read/write 
to the drive in blocks just as with magnetic drives.
The size of each block and the total number of blocks on the drive determine the drive capacity. Today’s 
drive capacities are usually measured in GB (gigabytes) or TB (terabytes, each of which is 1024 gigabytes). 
Magnetic drives are generally much larger in capacity than SSD drives.
You need to be aware of one more technology supported by both SSD and magnetic hard drives 
called S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology), which is used to predict when 
a drive is likely to fail. System UEFI/BIOS uses S.M.A.R.T. to monitor drive performance, temperature, 
and other factors. For magnetic drives, it monitors disk spin-up time, distance between the head and 
the disk, and other mechanical activities of the drive. Many SSD drives report to the UEFI/BIOS the 
number of write operations, which is the best measurement of when the drive might fail. If S.M.A.R.T. 
suspects a drive failure is about to happen, it displays a warning message. S.M.A.R.T. can be enabled 
and disabled in UEFI/BIOS setup.
Now let’s look at how the drive’s firmware or controller communicates with the motherboard.
Notes Malware has been known to give false S.M.A.R.T. alerts.

Hard Drive Technologies and Interface Standards

External hard drives can connect to a computer by way of external SATA (eSATA), FireWire, or USB. 
Be sure the port provided by the computer uses the same standard that the external drive uses, for example, 
SuperSpeed USB 3.0 or eSATA III. If the port is not fast enough, you can install an expansion card to 
provide faster ports.
A consortium of manufacturers, called the Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO; see  
sata-io.org) and led by Intel, developed the SATA standards, and the standards also have the oversight 
of the T13 Committee (t13.org). SATA has had three major revisions, which are summarized in  
Table 6-1.
SATA Interface Standards Used by a Hard Drive
All hard drives in today’s personal computers use the SATA interface standards to connect to 
the motherboard. The serial ATA or SATA (pronounced “say-ta”) standard uses a serial data 
path, and a SATA data cable can accommodate a single SATA drive (see Figure 6-5).

Figure 6-5  A SATA cable connects a single SATA drive to a motherboard SATA connector
Notes Interface standards for drives define data speeds and transfer methods between the drive controller, the UEFI/
BIOS, the chipset on the motherboard, and the OS. The standards also define the type of cables and connectors used by 
the drive and the motherboard or expansion cards.
Notes Years ago, hard drives used the Parallel ATA (PATA) standards, also called the IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) 
standards, to connect to a motherboard. PATA allowed for one or two IDE connectors on a motherboard, each using a 
40-pin data cable. Two drives could connect to one cable. In addition, a few personal computer hard drives used the SCSI 
(pronounced “scuzzy”) interface standard.

Supporting Hard Drives and Other Storage Devices
SATA interfaces are used by all types of drives, including hard drives, CD, DVD, Blu-ray, and tape drives. 
SATA supports hot-swapping, also called hot-plugging. With hot-swapping, you can connect and disconnect 
a drive while the system is running. Hard drives that can be hot-swapped cost significantly more than 
regular hard drives.
A SATA drive connects to one internal SATA connector on the motherboard by way of a 7-pin SATA 
data cable and uses a 15-pin SATA power connector (see Figure 6-6). An internal SATA data cable can be 
up to 1 meter in length. A motherboard might have two or more SATA connectors; use the connectors in 
the order recommended in the motherboard user guide. For example, for the four connectors shown in 
Figure 6-7, you are told to use the red ones before the black ones.

Figure 6-7  This motherboard has two black and two red SATA II ports
In addition to internal SATA connectors, 
the motherboard or an expansion card 
can provide external SATA (eSATA) 
ports for external drives (see Figure 6-8). 
External SATA drives use a special 
external shielded SATA cable up to 
2 meters long. Seven-pin eSATA ports run 
at the same speed as the internal ports 
using SATA I, II, or III standards. The 
eSATA port is shaped differently from an 
internal SATA connector so as to prevent 
people from using the unshielded internal 
SATA data cables with the eSATA port.
When purchasing a SATA hard drive, keep 
in mind that the SATA standards for the drive 
and the motherboard need to match. If either 
the drive or the motherboard uses a slower 
SATA standard than the other device, the 
system will run at the slower speed. Other hard 
drive characteristics to consider when selecting 
a drive are covered later in the chapter.

Examine UEFI/BIOS Settings for a Hard Drive
Following the directions given in the chapter, “All About Motherboards,” view the UEFI/BIOS setup 
information on your computer, and write down all the UEFI/BIOS settings that apply to your hard drive. 
Explain each setting that you can. What is the size of the installed drive? Does your system support

How to Select and Install Hard Drives
In this part of the chapter, you learn how to select a hard drive for your system. Then, you learn 
the details of installing a SATA drive. Next, you learn how to deal with using removable bays, 
the problem of installing a hard drive in a bay that is too wide for it, and special considerations 
to install a hard drive in a laptop. You also learn how to set up a RAID system.

Selecting a Hard Drive
When selecting a hard drive, keep in mind that to get the best performance from the system, 
the system UEFI/BIOS and the hard drive must support the same standard. If they don’t 
support the same standard, they revert to the slower standard that both can use, or the drive 
will not work at all. There’s no point in buying an expensive hard drive with features that 
your system cannot support.
Therefore, when making purchasing decisions, you need to know what standards the motherboard or 
controller card providing the drive interface can use. To find out, see the documentation for the board 
or the card. For the motherboard, you can look at UEFI/BIOS setup screens to see which standards are 
mentioned. However, know that when installing a drive, you don’t need to know which SATA standard a 
hard drive supports because the startup UEFI/BIOS uses autodetection. With autodetection, the UEFI/BIOS 
detects the new drive and automatically selects the correct drive capacity and configuration, including the 
best possible standard supported by both the hard drive and the motherboard.
A+  
220-901 
1.4, 1.5, 
1.11
When purchasing a hard drive, consider the following factors that affect performance, use, and price:
	 The capacity of the drive. Today’s hard drives for desktop systems are in the range of 1 TB for SSD 
drives to more than 6 TB for magnetic drives. The more gigabytes or terabytes, the higher the price. 
Magnetic drives have larger capacity for the money than solid-state drives.
	 The spindle speed. Magnetic hard drives for desktop systems run at 5400, 7200, or 10,000 RPM 
(revolutions per minute). The most common is 7200 RPM. The higher the RPMs, the faster the drive.
	 The interface standard. Use the standards your motherboard supports. For SATA, most likely that will 
be SATA II or SATA III. For external drives, common standards are eSATA, FireWire 800 or 400, and 
SuperSpeed or Hi-Speed USB.
	 The cache or buffer size. For magnetic hard drives, buffer memory improves hard drive performance 
and can range in size from 2 MB to 128 MB. The more the better, though the cost goes up as the size 
increases. A buffer helps because the hard drive reads ahead of the requested data and stores the extra 
data in the buffer. If the next read is already in the buffer, the controller does not need to return to the 
spinning platters for the data. Buffering especially improves performance when managing large files, 
such as when working with videos or movies.
Now that you know about the various hard drive technologies and interfaces, let’s see how to select 
and install a hard drive.

Now let’s turn our attention to the step-by-step process of installing a SATA drive.
Steps to Install a SATA Drive
In Figure 6-9, you can see the back of a SATA hard drive. A SATA drive might have jumpers 
used to set features such as the ability to power up from standby mode. Most likely, if jumpers 
are present on a SATA drive, the factory has set them as they should be and advises you not to 
change them.

Table 6-2  Hard drive manufacturers
Some SATA drives have two power connectors, as does the one in Figure 6-10. Choose between the SATA 
power connector (which is the preferred connector) or the legacy 4-pin Molex connector, but never install 
two power cords to the drive at the same time because this could damage the drive.
A hard drive manufacturer might produce both magnetic drives and solid-state drives. Some hard drive 
manufacturers are listed in Table 6-2. Most manufacturers of memory also make solid-state drives.

You can also purchase a SATA controller card that can provide internal SATA connectors and external 
eSATA connectors. You might want to use a controller card when (1) the motherboard drive connectors 
are not functioning, or (2) the motherboard does not support a fast SATA standard that your hard drives 
use. Figure 6-11 shows a PCIe storage controller card that offers two internal SATA III connections and 
two eSATA III ports.
Here is the step-by-step process of installing a SATA drive in a desktop system.
Step 1: Know Your Starting Point
As with installing any other devices, before you begin installing a hard drive, make sure you know where 
your starting point is. Do this by answering these questions: How is your system configured? Is everything 
working properly? Verify which of your system’s devices are working before installing a new one. Later, 
if a device does not work, the information will help you isolate the problem. Keeping notes is a good idea 
whenever you install new hardware or software or make any other changes to your computer system. Write 
down what you know about the system that might be important later.
Notes When installing hardware and software, don’t install too many things at once. If something goes wrong, you 
won’t know what’s causing the problem. Install one device, start the system, and confirm that the new device is working 
before installing another.

Step 2:Read the Documentation and Prepare Your Work Area
Before you take anything apart, carefully read all the documentation for the drive and controller card, 
as well as the part of your motherboard documentation that covers hard drive installation. Make sure 
that you can visualize all the steps in the installation. If you have any questions, keep researching until 
you locate the answer. You can also call technical support, or ask a knowledgeable friend for help. As 
you get your questions answered, you might discover that what you are installing will not work on your 
computer, but that is better than coping with hours of frustration and a disabled computer. You cannot 
always anticipate every problem, but at least you can know that you made your best effort to understand 
everything in advance. What you learn with thorough preparation pays off every time!
You’re now ready to set out your tools, documentation, new hardware, and notebook. Remember the 
basic rules concerning static electricity. Be sure to protect against electrostatic discharge (ESD) by wearing 
an ESD strap during the installation. You need to also avoid working on carpet in the winter when there’s 
a lot of static electricity.
Some added precautions for working with a hard drive are as follows:
	 Handle the drive carefully.
	 Do not touch any exposed circuitry or chips.
	 Prevent other people from touching exposed microchips on the drive.
	 When you first take the drive out of the static-protective package, touch the package containing the 
drive to a screw holding an expansion card or cover, or to a metal part of the computer case, for at least 
two seconds. This drains the static electricity from the package and from your body.
	 If you must set down the drive outside the static-protective package, place it component-side-up on a 
flat surface.
	 Do not place the drive on the computer case cover or on a metal table.
If you’re assembling a new system, in most situations, it’s best to install drives before you install the 
motherboard so that you will not accidentally bump sensitive motherboard components with the drives.
Step 3: Install the Drive
So now you’re ready to get started. Follow these steps to install the drive in the case:
1. Shut down the computer and unplug it. Then press the power button for three seconds to drain residual 
power. Remove the computer case cover. Check that you have an available power cord from the power 
supply for the drive.
2. Decide which bay will hold the drive. To do that, examine the locations of the drive bays and the length 
of the data cables and power cords. Bays designed for hard drives do not have access to the outside of 
the case, unlike bays for optical drives and other drives in which discs are inserted. Also, some bays are 
wider than others to accommodate wide drives such as a DVD drive. Will the data cable reach the drives 
and the motherboard connector? If not, rearrange your plan for locating the drive in a bay, or purchase a 
custom-length data cable. Some bays are stationary, meaning the drive is installed inside the bay because 
it stays in the case. Other bays are removable; you remove the bay and install the drive in the bay, and 
then return the bay to the case.
3. For a stationary bay, slide the drive in the bay, and using a screwdriver, secure one side of the drive 
with one or two short screws (see Figure 6-12). It’s best to use two screws so the drive will not move 
in the bay, but sometimes a bay only provides a place for a single screw on each side. Some drive bays 
provide one or two tabs that you can pull out before you slide the drive in the bay and then push the 
Notes If there are not enough power cords from a power supply, you can purchase a Y connector that can add an 
additional power cord.

5. Check the motherboard documentation to find out which SATA connectors on the board to use first. For 
example, five SATA connectors are shown in Figure 6-15. The documentation says the two blue SATA 
connectors support 6.0 Gb/s and slower speeds, and the two black and one red SATA connectors support 
3.0 Gb/s and slower speeds. On this board, be sure to connect your fastest hard drive to a blue connector. 
For some boards, the hard drive that has the bootable OS installed must be connected to the first SATA 
connector, which is usually labeled SATA 0. For both the drive and the motherboard, you can only plug 
the cable into the connector in one direction. A SATA cable might provide a clip on the connector to 
secure it (see Figure 6-16).

Notes Do not allow torque to stress the drive. In other words, don’t force a drive into a space that is too small for it.

shows a UEFI setup screen on one system that has four SATA connectors. A hard drive is installed on 
one of the faster yellow SATA connectors and a DVD drive is installed on one of the slower brown

You are now ready to prepare the hard drive for first use. If you are installing a new hard drive in a 
system that is to be used for a new Windows installation, boot from the Windows setup DVD, and follow 
the directions on the screen to install Windows on the new drive. If you are installing a second hard drive 
in a system that already has Windows installed on the first hard drive, you use the Disk Management 
utility in Windows to prepare the drive for first use (called partitioning and formatting the drive). How 
to install Windows is covered in the “Installing Windows” chapter, and how to use Disk Management is 
covered in the chapter,“Maintaining Windows.”
Installing a Drive in a Removable Bay
Now let’s see how a drive installation goes when you are dealing with a removable bay. 
Figure 6-19 shows a computer case with a removable bay that has a fan at the front of the 
bay to help keep the drives cool. (The case manufacturer calls the bay a fan cage.) The bay 
is anchored to the case with three black locking pins. The third locking pin from the bottom 
of the case is disconnected in the photo.

If you are mounting a hard drive into a bay that is too large, a universal bay kit can help 
you securely fit the drive into the bay. These inexpensive kits should create a tailor-made fit. 
In Figure 6-21, you can see how the universal bay kit adapter works. The adapter spans the 
distance between the sides of the drive and the bay. Figure 6-22 shows a SATA SSD drive with 
the brackets connected. Because SSD drives are usually smaller than magnetic drives, you’re likely to need 
a bay kit to fit these drives into most desktop computer cases.

Installing a Hard Drive in a Laptop
When purchasing and installing an internal hard drive or optical drive in a laptop, see the 
laptop manufacturer’s documentation about specific sizes and connectors that will fit the 
laptop. Also be aware of voiding a warranty if you don’t follow the laptop manufacturer’s 
directions. Here is what you need to know when shopping for a laptop hard drive:
	 A desktop hard drive is 3.5 inches wide and a laptop drive is 2.5 inches or 1.8 inches wide. Because 
the form factor of a laptop drive is more compact, it costs more than a desktop drive holding the same 
amount of data. Some laptop hard drives use SSD (solid-state device) technology.
	 Today’s laptop hard drives use a SATA interface, and older laptops used a PATA interface. Check your 
laptop manual to know which type of hard drive to buy, or remove the old drive and see which interface 
it uses. SATA data and power connectors on a laptop hard drive look the same as those in a desktop 
installation.
Before deciding to replace a hard drive, consider these issues:
	 If the old drive has crashed, you’ll need the recovery media to reinstall Windows and the drivers. Make 
sure you have the recovery media before you start.
	 If you are upgrading from a low-capacity drive to a higher-capacity drive, you need to consider how 
you will transfer data from the old drive to the new one. One way to do that is to use a USB-to-SATA 
converter. Using this converter, both drives can be up and working on the laptop at the same time, so 
you can copy files.
To replace a hard drive, older laptop computers required that you disassemble the laptop. With newer 
laptops, you should be able to easily replace a drive. For example, for one laptop, first power down the 
system, remove peripherals, including the AC adapter, and remove the battery pack. Then remove a screw 
that holds the drive in place (see Figure 6-23).

Caution
To protect sensitive components, never open a laptop case without first unplugging the AC adapter and 
removing the battery pack.

Notes It is possible to give general directions on desktop computer repair that apply to all kinds of brands, models, 
and systems. Not so with laptops. Learning to repair laptops involves learning unique ways to assemble, disassemble, and 
repair laptop components for specific brands and models of laptops.
Open the lid of the laptop slightly so that the lid doesn’t obstruct your removing the drive. Turn the 
laptop on its side and push the drive out of its bay (see Figure 6-24). Then remove the plastic cover from 
the drive. Move the cover to the new drive, and insert the new drive in the bay. Next, replace the screw 
and power up the system.

When the system boots up, if UEFI/BIOS setup is set to autodetect hard drives, UEFI/BIOS recognizes the 
new drive and searches for an operating system. If the drive is new, boot from the Windows recovery DVD 
and install the OS.
For some laptops, such as the one shown in Figure 6-25, you remove a cover on the bottom of the computer 
to expose the hard drive. Then remove one screw that anchors the drive. You can then remove the drive.

Setting up Hardware RAID
For most personal computers, a single hard drive works independently of any other installed 
drives. A technology that configures two or more hard drives to work together as an array of 
drives is called RAID (redundant array of inexpensive disks or redundant array of independent 
disks). Two reasons you might consider using RAID are:
	 To improve fault tolerance, which is a computer’s ability to respond to a fault or catastrophe, such as 
a hardware failure or power outage, so that data is not lost. If data is important enough to justify the 
cost, you can protect the data by continuously writing two copies of it, each to a different hard drive. 
This method is most often used on high-end, expensive file servers, but it is occasionally appropriate 
for a single-user workstation.
	 To improve performance by writing data to two or more hard drives so that a single drive is not 
excessively used.
Types of RAID
Several types of RAID exist; the four most commonly used are RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, and RAID 10. 
Following is a brief description of each, including another method of two disks working together, called 
spanning. The first four methods are diagrammed in Figure 6-26:

	 Spanning, sometimes called JBOD (just a bunch of disks), uses two hard drives to hold a single Windows 
volume, such as drive E:. Data is written to the first drive, and, when it is full, the data continues to be 
written to the second.
	 RAID 0 also uses two or more physical disks to increase the disk space available for a single volume. 
RAID 0 writes to the physical disks evenly across all disks so that no one disk receives all the activity 
and therefore improves performance. Windows calls RAID 0 a striped volume. To understand that term, 
think of data striped—or written across—several hard drives. RAID 0 is preferred to spanning.
	 RAID 1 is a type of mirroring that duplicates data on one drive to another drive and is used for fault 
tolerance. Each drive has its own volume, and the two volumes are called mirrors. If one drive fails, the 
other continues to operate and data is not lost. Windows calls RAID 1 a mirrored volume.
	 RAID 5 stripes data across three or more drives and uses parity checking, so that if one drive fails, the 
other drives can re-create the data stored on the failed drive by using the parity information. Data is 
not duplicated, and, therefore, RAID 5 makes better use of volume capacity. RAID-5 drives increase 
performance and provide fault tolerance. Windows calls these drives RAID-5 volumes.
	 RAID 10, also called RAID 1+0 and pronounced “RAID one zero” (not “RAID ten”), is a combination 
of RAID 1 and RAID 0. It takes at least four disks for RAID 10. Data is mirrored across pairs of disks, 
as shown at the top of Figure 6-27. In addition, the two pairs of disks are striped, as shown at the 
bottom of Figure 6-27. To help you better understand RAID 10, in the figure notice the data labeled 
as A, A, B, B across the first stripe. RAID 10 is the most expensive solution that provides the best 
redundancy and performance.

All RAID configurations can be 
accomplished at the hardware level (called 
hardware RAID) or at the operating 
system level (called software RAID). 
Using Windows 7 to implement software 
RAID, the Disk Management utility is 
used to configure a group of hard drives 
in a RAID array. In Windows 8, you can 
use the Disk Management utility or the 
new Windows 8 Storage Spaces utility 
to implement software RAID. However, 
software RAID is considered an unstable 
solution and is not recommended by 
Microsoft. Configuring RAID at the

hardware level is considered best practice because if Windows gets corrupted, the hardware might 
still be able to protect the data. Also, hardware RAID is generally faster than software RAID.
How to Implement Hardware RAID
Hardware RAID can be set up by using a RAID controller that is part of the motherboard UEFI/BIOS or by 
using a RAID controller storage card. Figure 6-28 shows a RAID controller card by Sabrent that provides 
four SATA ports.

When installing a hardware RAID system, for best performance, all hard drives in an array should be identical 
in brand, size, speed, and other features. Also, if Windows is to be installed on a hard drive that is part of a RAID 
array, RAID must be implemented before Windows is installed. As with installing any hardware, first read the 
documentation that comes with the motherboard or RAID controller and follow those specific directions rather 
than the general guidelines given here. Make sure you understand which RAID configurations the board supports.
For one motherboard that has six SATA connectors that support RAID 0, 1, 5, and 10, here are the 
general directions to install the RAID array using three matching hard drives in a RAID-5 array:
1. Install the three SATA drives in the computer case and connect each drive to a SATA connector on the 
motherboard (see Figure 6-29). To help keep the drives cool, the drives are installed with an empty bay 
between each drive.

2. Boot the system and enter UEFI/BIOS setup. On the Advanced setup screen, verify the three 
drives are recognized. Select the option to configure SATA and then select RAID from the menu 
(see Figure 6-30).
3. Reboot the system and a message is displayed on screen: “Press <Ctrl+I> to enter the RAID 
Configuration Utility.” Press Ctrl and I to enter the utility (see Figure 6-31). Notice in the information

5. Under RAID Level, select RAID5 (Parity). Because we are using RAID 5, which requires three hard drives, 
the option to select the disks for the array is not available. All three disks will be used in the array.
6. Select the value for the Strip Size. (This is the amount of space devoted to one strip across the striped 
array. Choices are 32 KB, 64 KB, or 128 KB.)
7. Enter the size of the volume. The available size is shown in Figure 6-32 as 1192 GB, but you don’t have 
to use all the available space. The space you don’t use can later be configured as another array. (In this 
example, I entered 500 GB.)
8. Select Create Volume to complete the RAID configuration. A message appears warning you that if you 
proceed, all data on all three hard drives will be lost. Type Y to continue. The array is created and the 
system reboots.
You are now ready to install Windows. Windows 8/7/Vista have built-in hardware RAID drivers and, 
therefore, automatically “see” the RAID array as a single 500-GB hard drive. After Windows is installed 
on the drive, Windows will call it drive C:.
Troubleshoot Hard Drive Installations
Sometimes, trouble crops up during an installation. Keeping a cool head; thinking things through 
carefully a second, third, and fourth time; and using all available resources will most likely get you 
out of any mess.
Installing a hard drive is not difficult, unless you have an unusually complex situation. For example, 
your first hard drive installation should not involve the extra complexity of installing a RAID array. If a complicated 
installation is necessary and you have never installed a hard drive, ask for expert help.

The following list describes errors that cropped up during a few hard drive installations; the list also includes the 
causes of the errors and what was done about them. Everyone learns something new when making mistakes, and 
you probably will, too. You can then add your own experiences to this list:
	 Shawn physically installed a SATA hard drive. He turned on the machine and accessed UEFI/BIOS setup. 
The hard drive was not listed as an installed device. He checked and discovered that autodetection was not 
enabled. He enabled it and rebooted. Setup recognized the drive.
	 When first turning on a previously working computer, Susan received the following error message: 
“Hard drive not found.” She turned off the machine, checked all cables, and discovered that the data 
cable from the motherboard to the drive was loose. She reseated the cable and rebooted. POST found 
the drive.
	 Lucia physically installed a new hard drive, replaced the cover on the computer case, and booted the 
computer with a Windows setup DVD in the drive. POST beeped three times and stopped. Recall that 
diagnostics during POST are often communicated by beeps if the tests take place before POST has 
checked video and made it available to display the messages. Three beeps on some computers signal 
a memory error. Lucia turned off the computer and checked the memory modules on the motherboard. 
A module positioned at the edge of the motherboard next to the cover had been bumped as she replaced 
the cover. She reseated the module and booted again, this time with the cover still off. The error 
disappeared.
	 Jason physically installed a new hard drive and turned on the computer. He received the following error: 
“No boot device available.” He forgot to insert a Windows setup DVD. He put the disc in the drive and 
rebooted the machine successfully.
	 The hard drive did not physically fit into the bay. The screw holes did not line up. Juan got a bay kit, 
but it just didn’t seem to work. He took a break, went to lunch, and came back to make a fresh start. 
Juan asked others to help view the brackets, holes, and screws from a fresh perspective. It didn’t take 
long to discover that he had overlooked the correct position for the brackets in the bay.
External Enclosures
Hard drives are sometimes stored in external enclosures such as the one shown in 
Figure 6-33. These enclosures make it easy to expand the storage capacity of a single 
computer or to make available hard drive storage to an entire network. For network 
attached storage (NAS), the enclosure connects to the network using an Ethernet port. 
When the storage is used by a single computer, the connection is made using a USB or eSATA port. 
Regardless of how the enclosure connects to a computer or network, the hard drives inside the 
enclosure might use a SATA connection.

Caution
When things are not going well, you can tense up and make mistakes more easily. Be certain to turn 
off the machine before doing anything inside! Not doing so can be a costly error. For example, a friend had been 
trying and retrying to boot for some time and got frustrated and careless. She plugged the power cord into the 
drive without turning the computer off. The machine began to smoke and everything went dead. The next thing she 
learned was how to replace a power supply!

How to Select and Install Hard Drives

Here is what you need to know about supporting 
these external enclosures:
	 An enclosure might contain firmware that supports 
RAID. For example, a switch on the rear of one 
enclosure for two hard drives can be set for 
RAID 0, RAID 1, or stand-alone drives. Read the 
documentation for the enclosure to find out how 
to manage the RAID volumes.
	 To replace a hard drive in an enclosure, see the 
documentation for the enclosure to find out how 
to open the enclosure and replace the drive.
	 If a computer case is overheating, one way to 
solve this problem is to remove the hard drives 
from the case and install them in an external 
enclosure. However, it’s better to leave the hard 
drive that contains the Windows installation in 
the case.

Install a Hard Drive
In a lab that has one hard drive per computer, you can practice installing a hard drive by removing 
a drive from one computer and installing it as a second drive in another computer. When you boot 
up the computer with two drives, verify that both drives are accessible in Windows 8 File Explorer or 
Windows 7/Vista Windows Explorer. Then remove the second hard drive, and return it to its original 
computer. Verify that both computers and drives are working.

Now let’s move on to other types of storage devices, including tape drives, optical drives, and flash cards.
Identifying Tape Drives
Tape drives (see Figure 6-34) are 
an inexpensive way of backing up 
an entire hard drive or portions 
of it. Because tape drives are less 
expensive for backups than external hard drives, 
CDs, DVDs, or USB flash drives, they are still 
used for backups even though other methods 
are more convenient. Tapes currently have up to 
185 TB true tape capacity and come in several 
types and formats. Some tape drives and tape 
cartridges support WORM (write once and read 
many). WORM drives and cartridges assure 
that data written on the tape will not be deleted 
or overwritten. Most tape drives come bundled 
with backup software to use them.

Ultrium 5 and LTO Ultrium 4 tapes and reads from LTO 
Ultrium 5, LTO Ultrium 4, and LTO Ultrium 3 tapes. It 
provides AES 256-bit data encryption security, WORM 
functionality, and partitioning capability.

The biggest disadvantage of using tape drives is that data is stored on tape by sequential access; to read 
data from anywhere on the tape, you must start at the beginning of the tape and read until you come to 
the sought-after data. Sequential access makes recovering files slow and inconvenient, which is why tapes 
are not used for general-purpose data storage.
Tape drives accommodate one of two kinds of tapes: full-sized data cartridges are 4 × 6 × 5
8 inches, and the 
smaller minicartridges, like the one shown in Figure 6-35, are 3 1
4 × 2 1
2 × 3
5 inches. Minicartridges are more 
popular because their drives can fit into a standard 3-inch drive bay of a computer case.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know how to install a tape drive and how to select the right 
tapes for the drive.
Notes Two basic ways computers access data is random access and sequential access. As an analogy, “pick a card, 
any card” is random access and “take the first card in the stack” is sequential access.

Before we explore the details of several other types of storage devices, including optical discs, 
USB flash drives, and memory cards, let’s start with the file systems they might use.
A+  
220-901 
1.5, 1.11
File Systems Used by Storage Devices
A storage device, such as a hard drive, CD, DVD, USB flash drive, or memory card, uses a file 
system to manage the data stored on the device. A file system is the overall structure the OS 
uses to name, store, and organize files on a drive. In Windows, each storage device is assigned 
a drive letter. In Windows 8 File Explorer or Windows 7/Vista Windows Explorer, to see what 
file system a device is using, right-click the device and select Properties from the shortcut menu. The device 
Properties box appears, which shows the file system and storage capacity of the device (see Figure 6-37).

File system
used by the
SD card
Figure 6-37  This 4-GB SD card is using the FAT32 file system
Installing a new file system on a device is called formatting the device, and the process erases all data on 
the device. One way to format a device is to right-click the device and select Format from the shortcut menu. 
In the box that appears, you can select the file system to use (see Figure 6-38). The New Technology file 
system (NTFS) is primarily used by hard drives. The exFAT file system is used by large-capacity removable 
storage devices such as large-capacity USB flash drives, memory cards, and some external hard drives. In 
addition, the older FAT32 and FAT file systems are used by smaller-capacity devices. If you have problems 
with a device, make sure it’s using a file system appropriate for your situation.
When selecting a tape drive, consider how many and what type of cartridges the drive can use and how it 
interfaces with the computer. The drive might be able to read from more types of cartridges than it can write 
to. A tape drive can be external or internal. An external tape drive costs more but can be used by more than 
one computer. An internal tape drive can interface with a computer using a SATA, PATA, or SCSI connection. 
An external tape drive can connect to a computer using a USB, FireWire, SCSI, SAS, or eSATA port.

Standards Used by Optical Drives and Discs
CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs use similar laser technologies. Tiny lands and pits on the surface 
of a disc represent bits, which a laser beam can read. This is why they are called optical storage 
technologies. CD (compact disc) drives use the CDFS (Compact Disc File System) or the UDF 
(Universal Disk Format) file system, while DVD (digital versatile disc or digital video disc) 
drives and Blu-ray Disc (BD) drives use the newer UDF file system.
Blu-ray drives are backward compatible with DVD and CD technologies, and DVD drives are backward 
compatible with CD technologies. Depending on the drive features, an optical drive might be able to read 
and write to BDs, DVDs, and CDs. An internal optical drive can interface with the motherboard by way of 
a SATA connection. An external drive might use an eSATA, FireWire, or USB port. Figure 6-39 shows an 
internal DVD drive, and Figure 6-40 shows an external DVD drive.

Data is written to only one side of a CD, but can be written to one or both sides of a DVD or Blu-ray 
disc. Also, a DVD or Blu-ray disc can hold data in two layers on each side. This means these discs can hold 
a total of four layers on one disc (see Figure 6-41).
The breakdown of how much data can be held on CDs, DVDs, and BDs is shown in Figure 6-42. The 
capacities for DVDs and BDs depend on the sides and layers used to hold the data.

Windows 8/7/Vista supports optical drives using its own embedded drivers without add-on drivers. 
Therefore, when Windows first starts up after the drive is installed, it recognizes the drive and installs 
drivers. Use Device Manager to verify the drive installed with no errors and is ready to use.
Replacing an Optical Drive on a Laptop
Some of the newest laptops do not have an optical drive in order to save on the size and 
weight of a laptop, but instead use an external optical drive. However, several new laptops 
still include the optical drive, and if it goes bad on a laptop, it is likely cheaper to replace the 
optical drive than to replace the laptop. For some systems, you’ll need to first remove the 
keyboard to expose an optical drive. Follow along as we remove the DVD drive from one laptop system:
1. Very important: Unplug the AC adapter and remove the battery pack.
2. For this laptop, to remove the keyboard, you first remove one screen on the bottom of the case and then 
turn the case over and pry up the keyboard. You can then move the keyboard to one side. You can leave 
the ribbon cable from the motherboard to the keyboard connected. When you move the keyboard out of 
the way, the DVD drive is exposed, as shown in Figure 6-46.

4. Slide the drive out of the bay (see Figure 6-48).
5. When you slide the new drive into the bay, make sure you push it far enough into the bay so that it 
solidly connects with the drive connector at the back of the bay. Replace the screw.
For other systems, the optical drive can be removed by first removing a cover from the bottom of the 
laptop. Then you remove one screw that secures the drive. Next, push the optical drive out of the case 
(see Figure 6-49).

Solid-state Storage
Types of solid-state storage include SSD hard drives, USB flash drives, and memory cards. 
USB flash drives currently for sale range in size from 128 MB to 1 TB and go by many names, 
including a flash pen drive, jump drive, thumb drive, and key drive. Several USB flash drives 
are shown in Figure 6-50. Flash drives might work at USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 speed and use the 
FAT (for small-capacity drives) or exFAT file system (for large-capacity drives). Windows 8/7/Vista has 
embedded drivers to support flash drives. To use one, simply insert the device in a USB port. It then shows 
in Windows 8 File Explorer or Windows 7/Vista Windows Explorer as a drive with an assigned letter.

SDHC and SDXC slots are backward compatible with earlier standards for SD cards. However, you 
cannot use an SDHC card in an SD slot, and you cannot use an SDXC card in an SDHC slot or SD slot. 
Only use SDXC cards in SDXC slots.
SD and SDHC cards use the FAT file system, and SDXC cards use the exFAT file system. Windows 8/7/
Vista support both file systems, so you should be able to install an SD, SDHC, or SDXC card in an SD 
slot on a Windows 8/7/Vista laptop with no problems (assuming the slot supports the SDHC or SDXC 
card you are using).
Memory cards other than SD cards are shown in Table 6-5. Some of the cards in Table 6-5 are now obsolete.

Example
The Sony Memory Stick PRO Duo is about half the size of the Memory Stick PRO but 
is faster and has a higher storage capacity (up to 2 GB). You can use an adapter to 
insert the Memory Stick PRO Duo in a regular Memory Stick slot.
Compact Flash (CF) cards come in two types, Type I (CFI) and Type II (CFII). Type II 
cards are slightly thicker. CFI cards will fit a Type II slot, but CFII cards will not fit 
a Type I slot. The CF standard allows for sizes up to 137 GB, although current sizes 
range up to 32 GB. UDMA CompactFlash cards are faster than other CompactFlash 
cards. UDMA (Ultra Direct Memory Access) transfers data from the device to memory 
without involving the CPU.
MultiMediaCard (MMC) looks like an SD card, but the technology is different and 
they are not interchangeable. Generally, SD cards are faster than MMC cards.
Embedded MMC (eMMC) is internal storage used instead of using an SSD drive in 
inexpensive mobile devices such as cell phones, tablets, and laptops.

Figure 6-52 shows several flash memory cards together so you can get an idea of their relative sizes. Sometimes 
a memory card is bundled with one or more adapters so that a smaller card will fit a larger card slot.
Troubleshooting Hard Drives
In this part of the chapter, you learn how to troubleshoot problems with hard drives. Problems 
caused by the hard drive during the boot can be caused by the hard drive subsystem, by the 
file system on the drive, or by files required by Windows when it begins to load. When trying 
to solve a problem with the boot, you need to decide if the problem is caused by hardware or 
software. All the problems discussed in this section are caused by hardware.

Slow Performance
One of the most common complaints about a computer is that it is running slowly. When files 
are physically written over a magnetic hard drive in disconnected fragments on the drive, 
slow performance can result. (SSD drives don’t suffer from slow performance when files are 
fragmented on the drive.) A quick fix for fragmented files is to run the defragmentation tool

Hard Drive Problems during the Boot
Hardware problems usually show up at POST, unless there is physical damage to an area of 
the hard drive that is not accessed during POST. Hardware problems often make the hard 
drive totally inaccessible. If UEFI/BIOS cannot find a hard drive at POST, it displays an error 
message similar to these:
No boot device available
Hard drive not found
OS not found
Read/write failure
Fixed disk error
Invalid boot disk
Inaccessible boot device

on the hard drive. Windows 8/7/Vista automatically defragments a magnetic hard drive once a week, 
but you can run the defragmentation tool independently of the scheduled maintenance. The Windows 
defragmentation tool rearranges fragments or parts of files in contiguous clusters so that, when the computer 
is searching for files, they are easier and faster to find. To run the defragmentation tool, right-click the Start 
button in Windows 8, click Run, and enter the dfrgui command. In Windows 7, click Start and enter the 
dfrgui command in the Search box. Select the drive to defrag (see Figure 6-53 for Windows 8). Windows will 
tell you if the drive is fragmented and will benefit from defragmentation. Notice in the figure that solid-state 
drives are not marked as fragmented, but Windows 8 can optimize these drives to release unused space to 
reduce the number of write operations to the drive. (Windows 7 does not optimize SSD drives.)

Drive not recognized
RAID not found
RAID stops working
Numeric error codes in the 1700s or 10400s
S.M.A.R.T. errors during the boot
The reasons UEFI/BIOS cannot access the drive can be caused by the drive, the data cable, the electrical 
system, the motherboard, or a loose connection. Here is a list of things to do and check before you open 
the case:
1. If UEFI/BIOS displays numeric error codes or cryptic messages during POST, check the website of the 
UEFI/BIOS manufacturer for explanations of these codes or messages.
2. Check UEFI/BIOS setup for errors in the hard drive configuration. If you suspect an error, set UEFI/BIOS 
to default settings, make sure autodetection is turned on, and reboot the system.
3. Try booting from another bootable media such as the Windows setup DVD or a USB flash drive or 
CD with the Linux OS and diagnostics software installed (for example, Hiren’s BootCD software at 
hirensbootcd.org). If you can boot using another media, you have proven that the problem is isolated 
to the hard drive subsystem. You can also use the bootable media to access the hard drive, run 
diagnostics on the drive, and possibly recover its data.
4. For a RAID array, use the firmware utility to check the status of each disk in the array and to check for 
errors. Press a key at startup to access the RAID UEFI/BIOS utility. This utility lists each disk in the array 
and its status. You can search the website of the motherboard or RAID controller manufacturer for an 
interpretation of the messages on this screen and what to do about them. If one of the disks in the array 
has gone bad, it might take some time for the array to rebuild using data on the other disks. In this 
situation, the status for the array is likely to show as Caution.
After the array has rebuilt, your data should be available. However, if one of the hard drives in the array has 
gone bad, you need to replace the hard drive. After you have replaced the failed drive, you must add it back 
to the RAID array. This process is called rebuilding a RAID volume. How to do this depends on the RAID 
hardware you are using. For some motherboards or RAID controller cards, you use the RAID firmware. For 
others, you use the RAID management software that came bundled with the motherboard or controller. You 
install this software in Windows and use the software to rebuild the RAID volume using the new hard drive.
If the problem is still not solved, open the case and check these things. Be sure to protect the system 
against ESD as you work:
1. Remove and reattach all drive cables.
2. If you’re using a RAID or SATA controller card, remove and reseat it or place it in a different slot. 
Check the documentation for the card, looking for directions for troubleshooting.
3. Inspect the drive for damage, such as bent pins on the connection for the cable.
4. Determine if a magnetic hard drive is spinning by listening to it or lightly touching the metal drive 
(with the power on).
5. Check the cable for frayed edges or other damage.
6. Check the installation manual for things you might have overlooked. Look for a section about system 
setup, and carefully follow all directions that apply.
7. S.M.A.R.T. errors that display during the boot result from UEFI/BIOS reporting that the drive has met a 
threshold point of failure. Back up the data and replace the drive as soon as possible.
8. When Windows installed on a hard drive cannot launch, it might present a BSOD (blue screen of death) 
screen with error messages or it might hang and you see a never-ending spinning Windows pinwheel or 
wait icon. Windows includes several tools for checking a hard drive for errors and repairing a corrupted

Windows installation that are covered in the chapter,“Troubleshooting Windows Startup.” Without 
getting into these details of supporting Windows, here are a few simple things you can try:
a.	Use Windows 8/7/Vista Startup Repair. The Startup Repair utility restores many of the Windows 
files needed for a successful boot. Following directions given in the chapter,“Supporting the Power 
System and Troubleshooting Computers,” boot from the Windows setup DVD. For Windows 8, on 
the opening screen, select your language, and click Repair your computer. Next choose Troubleshoot, 
then choose Advanced options. On Advanced options (see Figure 6-54), click Startup Repair and 
follow the on-screen instructions. In Windows 7, boot from the Windows setup DVD, click Repair 
your computer, and sign in to the Windows system installed on the hard drive. Next, on the System 
Recovery Options menu (see Figure 6-55), select Startup Repair.

b.	Use the chkdsk command. To make sure the hard drive does not have bad sectors that can corrupt the 
file system, you can use the chkdsk command. To use the command in Windows 8, select Command 
Prompt from the Advanced options menu (refer back to Figure 6-54). In Windows 7, select Command 
Prompt from the System Recovery Options menu (refer back to Figure 6-55). At the command prompt 
that appears, use this chkdsk command to search for bad sectors on drive C: and recover data:
chkdsk C: /r
c.	 Repair the BCD. The BCD (Boot Configuration Data) is a small database that holds parameters Windows 
needs for a successful boot. At a command prompt, use this bootrec command to rebuild the BCD:
bootrec /RebuildBCD
d.	Repair the MBR. When a hard drive is using the MBR method to manage partitions on the drive, 
the bootrec command can be used to fix problems with the MBR program that is needed to start 
Windows. Use this command:
bootrec /FixMBR
e.	 Repair the boot sector. The boot sector holds the MBR partition table. To repair a corrupted boot 
sector, use this command:
bootrec /FixBoot
9. Check the drive manufacturer’s website for diagnostic software. Sometimes this software can be run 
from a bootable CD. Run the software to test the drive for errors.
10. If it is not convenient to create a bootable CD with hard drive diagnostic software installed, you can 
move the drive to a working computer and install it as a second drive in the system. Then you can use 
the diagnostic software installed on the primary hard drive to test the problem drive. While you have the 
drive installed in a working computer, be sure to find out if you can copy data from it to the good drive, 
so that you can recover any data not backed up. Remember that you set the drive on the open computer 
case (see Figure 6-56) or use a SATA-to-USB converter to connect the drive to a USB port. If you have 
the case open with the computer turned on, be very careful to not touch the drive or touch inside the case.

11. After you have tried to recover the file system on the drive and before you decide to replace the hard 
drive, try these things to clean the drive and get a fresh start:
a.	Format a hard drive volume. If you decide the hard drive volume is corrupted and you want to start 
over, open a Windows command prompt and use the format command to erase everything on the 
volume. In this example, D: is the drive letter for the volume:
format D:
b.	Use diskpart to start over with a fresh file system. If formatting the volume doesn’t work, you can 
erase the hard drive partitions using the diskpart command. When you enter diskpart at a command 
prompt, the DISKPART> prompt appears. Then use these commands to wipe everything off the hard 
drive. In the example, you are erasing partition 1 on disk 0.
list disk
select disk 0
list partition
select partition 1
clean
	
Use the exit command to exit the diskpart utility. You can then reinstall Windows, which partitions 
the hard drive again. If Windows cannot recognize the drive, it’s probably time to replace hardware 
in the hard drive subsystem.
12. If the drive still does not boot, exchange the three field replaceable units—the data cable, the storage 
card (if the drive is connected to one), and the hard drive itself—for a hard drive subsystem. Do the 
following, in order, and test the hard drive after each step:
a.	Reconnect or swap the drive data cable.
b. Reseat or exchange the drive controller card, if one is present.
c. Exchange the hard drive for a known good drive.
13. Sometimes older drives refuse to spin at POST or a failing drive can make a loud clicking noise. 
Drives that have trouble spinning often whine at startup for several months before they finally refuse 
to spin altogether. If your drive whines loudly when you first turn on the computer, never turn off the 
computer and replace the drive as soon as possible. One of the worst things you can do for a drive that 
is having difficulty starting up is to leave the computer turned off for an extended period of time. Some 
drives, like old cars, refuse to start if they are unused for a long time. A drive making a loud clicking 
noise most likely is not accessible and must be replaced.
14. A bad power supply or a bad motherboard also might cause a disk boot failure.
If the problem is solved by exchanging the hard drive, take the extra time to reinstall the old hard drive 
to verify that the problem was not caused by a bad connection.
>> Chapter Summary
Hard Drive Technologies and Interface Standards
	A hard disk drive (HDD) comes in three sizes: 3.5" for desktop computers and 2.5" and 1.8" for laptops.
	A hard drive can be a magnetic drive, a solid-state drive, or a hybrid drive. A solid-state drive contains 
flash memory and is more expensive, faster, more reliable, and uses less power than a magnetic drive.
	Most hard drives, tape drives, and optical drives use the SATA interface standards. External SATA ports 
are called eSATA ports.

Chapter Summary
	Three SATA standards provide data transfer rates of 1.5 Gb/sec (using SATA I), 3.0 Gb/sec (using SATA II), 
and 16.0 Gb/sec (using SATA III).
	S.M.A.R.T. is a self-monitoring technology whereby the UEFI/BIOS monitors the health of the hard 
drive and warns of an impending failure.
How to Select and Install Hard Drives
	When selecting a hard drive, consider the storage capacity, technology (solid-state or magnetic), spindle 
speed, interface standard, and buffer size (for hybrid drives).
	SATA drives require no configuration and are installed using a power cord and a single SATA data cable.
	Laptop hard drives plug directly into a SATA connection on the system board.
	RAID technology uses an array of hard drives to provide fault tolerance and/or improvement in 
performance. Choices for RAID are RAID 0 (striping using two drives), RAID 1 (mirroring using two 
drives), RAID 5 (parity checking using three drives), and RAID 10 (striping and mirroring combined 
using four drives).
	Hardware RAID is implemented using the motherboard UEFI/BIOS or a RAID controller card. Software 
RAID is implemented in Windows. Best practice is to use hardware RAID rather than software RAID.
	Multiple hard drives can be installed in a single external enclosure to expand the storage capacity of a 
single computer or to make hard drive storage available on a network.
Identifying Tape Drives
	Tape drives are an inexpensive way to back up an entire hard drive or portions of it. Tape drives are 
more convenient for backups than   drives. The disadvantage of tape drives is that data can only be 
accessed sequentially.
Supporting Other Types of Storage Devices
	File systems a storage device might use in Windows include NTFS, exFAT, FAT32, and FAT.
	CDs, DVDs, and BDs are optical discs with data physically embedded into the surface of the disc. Laser 
beams are used to read data off the disc by measuring light reflection.
	Optical discs can be recordable (such as a CD-R disc) or rewriteable (such as a DVD-RW disc).
	Flash memory cards are a type of solid-state storage. Types of flash memory card standards by the SD 
Association include SD, MiniSD, MicroSD, SDHC, MiniSDHC, MicroSDHC, SDXC, and MicroSDXC. 
Other memory cards include Memory Stick PRO Duo, Memory Stick PRO, Sony Memory Stick Micro 
M2, CompactFlash I and II, eMMC, and xD-Picture Card.
Troubleshooting Hard Drives
	Defragmenting a magnetic hard drive can sometimes improve slow performance of the drive.
	Problems caused by the hard drive during the boot can be caused by the hard drive subsystem, by the 
file system on the drive, or by files required by Windows when it begins to load. After the boot, bad 
sectors on a drive can cause problems with corrupted files.
	To determine if the hard drive is the problem when booting, try to boot from another media, such as the 
Windows setup DVD.
	For problems with a RAID volume, use the RAID controller firmware (on the motherboard or on the 
RAID controller card) or RAID management software installed in Windows to report the status of the 
array and to rebuild the RAID volume.

	To determine if a drive has bad sectors, use the chkdsk command. You can run the command after 
booting to the System Recovery Options menu using the Windows setup DVD.
	The bootrec command can be used to rebuild the BCD, repair the MBR, or repair the boot sector of a 
hard drive.
	Use the format command to erase everything on a Windows volume.
	Use commands within the diskpart utility to completely erase a partition on a hard drive.
	Field replaceable units in the hard drive subsystem are the data cable, optional storage card, 
and hard drive.

Real Problem 6-1 Recovering Data
Your friend has a Windows 8 desktop system that contains important data. He frantically calls you to say 
that when he turns on the computer, the lights on the front panel light up and he can hear the fan spin 
for a moment and then all goes dead. His most urgent problem is the data on his hard drive, which is not 
backed up. The data is located in several folders on the drive. What is the quickest and easiest way to solve 
the most urgent problem, recovering the data? List the major steps in that process.
Real Problem 6-2 Using Hardware RAID
You work as an IT support technician for a boss who believes you are really bright and can solve just 
about any problem he throws at you. Folks in the company have complained one time too many that the 
file server downtime is just killing them, so he asks you to solve this problem. He wants you to figure out 
what hardware is needed to implement hardware RAID for fault tolerance.
You check the file server’s configuration and discover it has a single hard drive using a SATA connection 
with Windows Server 2012 installed. There are four empty bays in the computer case and four extra SATA 
power cords. You also discover an empty PCIe x4 slot on the motherboard. UEFI/BIOS setup does not offer 
the option to configure RAID, but you think the slot might accommodate a RAID controller.
Complete the investigation and do the following:
1.		 Decide what hardware you must purchase and print webpages showing the products and their cost.
2.		 What levels of RAID does the RAID controller card support? Which RAID level is best to use? Print 
any important information in the RAID controller documentation that supports your decisions.
3.		 What is the total hardware cost of implementing RAID? Estimate how much time you think it will 
take for you to install the devices and test the setup.

By the time this text is published, Microsoft will have released Windows 10; currently, however, 
Windows 8 is the latest Microsoft operating system and is an upgrade to Windows 7, which was preceded 
by Windows Vista. Every IT support technician needs to be a power user of Windows 8 and also be 
familiar with Windows 7.
Notes This chapter assumes Windows 8 or Windows 7 is already installed on your computer, and it would be great if you 
have access to both operating systems as you work your way through this chapter. If Windows is not yet installed, read the 
chapter, “Installing Windows,” and install Windows 8 or 7. Then you can return to this chapter to learn how to use the OS.

Windows Interfaces
7
Every Windows OS offers a graphical user interface (GUI; pronounced “GOO-ee”) that uses graphics instead 
of with a command-driven interface. Windows 8 has two graphical user interfaces, the modern interface and the 
desktop. Windows 7 offers one graphical user interface, the desktop. We next examine all three interfaces.
The editions of Windows 8 include Windows 8, Windows 8 Professional, Windows 8 Enterprise, and 
Windows RT. Windows 8.1 is a free update or release of the original Windows 8. Editions of Windows 7 
include Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Home Premium, 
Windows 7 Home Basic, and Windows 7 Starter.
Windows 8 Modern Interface
The Windows 8 modern interface, also called the Windows 8 interface and formerly called 
the Metro User Interface or Metro UI, presents the Start screen to the user. The Start screen 
contains tiles that represent lean apps, which use few system resources and are designed for 
social media, social networking, and the novice end user (see Figure 7-2). Click a tile to open 
its app. Some apps use live tiles, which offer continuous real-time updates. For example, the People app 
has a live tile to make it easy to keep up with updates on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam covers Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, and Windows Vista. For the most 
part, Windows 7 and Vista work alike. Important information about Vista where it differs from Windows 7 is presented in 
OS Differences boxes.
Notes In this text, we use Windows 8 as an umbrella term to cover Windows 8.0 (the first release of Windows 8) 
and Windows 8.1 (the free update to Windows 8.0).
The modern interface uses pages in comparison to the windows used on the desktop. The interface is 
specifically designed for touch screens.
Notes To conserve system resources, you can turn off a live tile. To do so, right-click the tile on the Start screen 
and then click Turn live tile off in the shortcut menu that appears. You can also use Task Manager to find out how the 
app is affecting overall system performance. You learn to use Task Manager in a later chapter.
Notes The figures and steps in this text use Windows 8.1 Professional and Windows 7 Professional. If you are using 
a different edition of Windows 8 or 7, your screens and steps may differ slightly from those presented here.

The Charms Bar and the Settings Charm
The charms bar appears on the right side of any Windows 8 screen when you move your pointer to a 
right corner (see Figure 7-3a). It gives handy access to common tasks such as returning to the Start screen, 
searching for content, connecting to a wireless network, personalizing the Start screen, or changing other 
Windows settings. In the charms bar, click a charm to select it. The Settings charm can be particularly 
useful, and items at the top of the Settings pane can change depending on the situation. Figure 7-3b shows 
the Settings pane from the Start screen, and Figure 7-3c shows the Settings pane from the desktop.

Notes With the first release of Windows 8, many users complained that important items like the charms bar were 
difficult to find and not at all intuitive to use. As a result, beginning with Windows 8.1, Microsoft added tips that randomly 
appear on screen to help users learn how to use the new interface.
The Settings Charm and 
the Power Icon
The Power icon in the upper-right 
corner of the Start screen can be 
used to shut down or restart the 
computer. Click the Power icon, and 
then click an item in the menu that 
appears (see Figure 7-4). The items 
on this menu always include Shut 
down and Restart, and, depending 
on the configuration, might also 
include Sleep and Hibernate.

Sign in to Windows 8 and Use 
the Windows 8 Interface
Although the Windows 8 interface is designed to work best with a touch screen, you can also use a 
mouse and keyboard. Follow these steps to learn how to sign in to Windows 8 and manage apps using 
the Windows 8 interface:
1.	 When you first start up a Windows 8 computer, you see the lock screen shown in Figure 7-5a. Click anywhere 
on the screen and the sign-in screen appears (see Figure 7-5b). To sign in, select a user account and enter 
the account password. The Start screen appears.

2.	 To open an app, click the app tile on the Start screen. If the app works in the Windows 8 modern interface, 
the app page opens. (If the app works on the Windows desktop, the desktop appears and the application 
window opens.)
3.	 To return to the Start screen, press the Win key. Open a second app, which fills the entire screen.
Notes These instructions assume you are using a mouse and keyboard. If you’re using a touch screen, simply 
tap instead of click; press and hold instead of right-click; double-tap instead of double-click; and swipe to scroll 
the screen to the right or left.
(continues)
4.	 You can snap a page to the left or right side of the screen so a second page can share the screen, which 
is called side-by-side apps. To snap a page, first move your pointer to the top of the screen—the pointer 
changes to a hand. Then press and drag the page down and to the left or right side of the screen. The page 
snaps to the side, and the second app takes up the other side of the screen. You can press and drag the 
vertical bar between the two pages to adjust the page sizes (see Figure 7-6).
Notes In Windows, there are multiple ways to do the same thing. For example, to return to the Start screen 
(a) press the Win key, (b) move your pointer to the lower left of the screen and click the Start (Windows logo) 
button that appears, or (c) move your pointer to a right corner of the screen and click the Start (Windows logo) 
charm in the charms bar that appears.
Notes To snap pages, your screen resolution must be at least 1366 × 768.

	 If the app tile isn’t showing, move your pointer to the bottom of the screen. You can then use the scroll bar 
that appears to scroll the screen to the right or left to see more apps on the Start screen. (You can also move 
your pointer to the far left or right side of the screen to scroll the screen.)
	 Some apps are not on the Start screen. Move your pointer to the bottom of the Start screen and a down 
arrow appears. Click the arrow to see the Apps screen, which shows all installed apps. Click one to open it.
	 You can also use the Search feature to open an app. On the Start screen, start typing the name of the app. 
As you type, the Search pane appears. For example, in Figure 7-8, you can see the top of the pane when no 
is typed. The remaining letters in notepad automatically appear in the Search box, and other possibilities 
are listed in the pane. If you want to open the Notepad app, click it. By default, the Search app searches 
for apps, Windows settings, files, web images, and web videos. If you click an item at the bottom of the 
pane, Internet Explorer opens to find it on the web.

system configuration, you might also 
see Sleep or Hibernate.
	 Pin to taskbar. For a desktop 
program you use often, you can add 
its icon to the taskbar on the desktop, 
which is called pinning to the taskbar. 
To do that, right-click an app on the 
Start screen or Apps screen to see 
the app’s shortcut menu (refer back 
to Figure 7-7). If the app works on 
the desktop, the menu includes the 
item Pin to taskbar. Another way to 
add a program icon to the taskbar is 
to open the program, right-click the 
program’s icon in the taskbar, and 
then click Pin this program to taskbar 
(see Figure 7-11).
Notes If you have a sluggish Windows system, one thing you can do is look at all the running services in the 
notification area and try to disable the services that are taking up system resources. How to do that is covered in 
the chapter, “Optimizing Windows.”

Here are a few tips about managing windows on the desktop:
	 Drag the title bar of a window to move the window. Use the buttons in the upper-right corner to resize, 
maximize, minimize, and close a window.
	 Drag a window to the top of the screen to maximize it. Drag the window downward on the screen to 
return it to its original size. Drag a window to the right or left of the screen so that it snaps to the side 
of the screen to fill half the screen.
	 Press and shake (drag back and forth quickly) the title bar of a window to minimize all other windows 
except the one you shake. Shake again to restore the size of the other windows.
	 Double-click the program file name in File Explorer. File Explorer allows you to view and manage files 
and folders on your computer or the network. To open File Explorer, click the File Explorer icon in the 
taskbar. You can launch a program by double-clicking the program file name in File Explorer. You learn 
to use File Explorer later in this chapter.
	 Shortcut on desktop. You can place a shortcut to a program on the desktop. How to do that is coming

Now, onward to the Windows 7 desktop.
The Windows 7 Desktop
In Windows 7 (and Vista), the desktop is the initial screen that is displayed after the user logs on and 
Windows is loaded. Just as with Windows 8, you can move, maximize, resize, minimize, shake, and close 
windows on the desktop. The Windows 7/Vista desktop provides a 3D user interface called the Aero 
user interface that gives a glassy appearance and is sometimes called Aero glass (see Figure 7-13). 
(TheAero interface is not available for the Windows 7 Starter and Home Basic editions.) For Windows 7 to support 
Aero, the system must have at least 1 GB of RAM and the video adapter must support Aero.

can change depending on the situation. You click a tab to see its ribbon or a dropdown menu that appears 
with more tools. The Computer ribbon is shown in the figure. The Windows 7 Windows Explorer window 
doesn’t use ribbons (see Figure 7-16).
Let’s see how to use the Explorer windows to manage files and folders and other system resources.
Files and Directories
Every OS manages a hard drive, optical drive, USB drive, or other type of drive by using directories 
(also called folders), subdirectories, and files. The drive is organized with a single root directory at the top 
of the top-down hierarchical structure of subdirectories, as shown in Figure 7-17. The exception to this 
rule is a hard drive because it can be divided into partitions that can have more than one volume such 
as drive C: and drive D: on the same physical hard drive (see Figure 7-18). For a volume, such as drive C:, 
the root directory is written as C:. Each volume has its own root directory and hierarchical structure of 
subdirectories. You can think of volumes as logical drives within the one physical drive.

As shown in Figure 7-17, the root directory can hold files or other directories, which can have names 
such as C:\Data. These directories, called subdirectories, child directories, folders, or subfolders can, in turn, 
have other directories listed in them. Any directory can have files and other subdirectories listed in it; for 
example, Figure 7-17 shows that one file on drive C: is C:\Data\Business\Letter.docx. In this path to the file, 
the C: identifies the volume and is called the drive letter. Drive letters used for a hard drive, CD, USB drive, 
or DVD are C:, D:, E:, and so forth.
Notes Technicians tend to call a directory a folder when working in File Explorer or Windows Explorer, but when 
working with a command-line interface, they call a directory a directory.

When you refer to a drive and directories that are pointing to the location of a file, as in C:\Data\
Business\Letter.docx, the drive and directories are called the path to the file (see Figure 7-19). The first 
part of the name before the period is called the file name (Letter), and the part after the period is called the 
file extension (.docx). A file extension indicates how the file is organized or formatted, the type of content 
in the file, and what program uses the file. For example, the .docx file extension identifies the file type as 
a Microsoft Word document file. By default, Windows does not display file extensions in Explorer. How 
to display these extensions is coming up.

Navigate the Folder Structure
When working with the File Explorer or Windows Explorer window, these tips can make your work easier:
	 Tip 1: Click or double-click items in the left pane, called the navigation pane, to drill down into these 
items. The folders or subfolders appear in the right pane. You can also double-click folders in the right 
pane to drill down. When you click the white arrow to the left of a folder in the navigation pane, its 
subfolders are listed underneath it in the pane.
	 Tip 2: To control how files and subfolders appear in the right pane of Windows 8, click one of the icons 
in the lower-right corner to select Thumbnail view or Details view (see Figure 7-20a). For Windows 7, 
click the View icon in the menu bar and select your view (see Figure 7-20b).

Create a Folder
To create a folder, first select the folder you want to be the parent folder. (Remember that a parent folder 
is the folder that contains the child folder.) Next, use one of these methods to create the new folder:
	 In Windows 8, select the Home ribbon and click New folder. In Windows 7, click New folder on the 
menu bar.
	 Right-click in the white area of the right pane and point to New in the shortcut menu. The menu 
in Figure 7-23 appears. Click Folder to create a regular folder or click Compressed (zipped) Folder 
to create a compressed folder.
After Windows creates the folder, the folder name is highlighted so that you can rename it (see Figure 7-24).
Figure 7-24  Edit the new folder’s name
Notes A compressed (zipped) folder has a .zip extension. Any file or folder that you put in this folder will be 
compressed to a smaller size than normal. A compressed folder is often used to compress files to a smaller size so 
they can more easily be sent by email. When you remove a file or folder from a compressed folder, the file or folder is 
uncompressed back to its original size. In general, Windows treats a compressed folder more like a file than a folder.

Notes The Windows desktop is itself a folder and is located at C:\Users\username\Desktop. For example, if the user, 
Anne, creates a folder on her desktop named Downloads, this folder is located at C:\Users\Anne\Desktop\Downloads.
Create a File
You can create a file using a particular application, or you can create a file using File Explorer or Windows 
Explorer. In Explorer, right-click in the unused white area in the right pane of the window and point to 
New in the shortcut menu. The menu lists applications you can use to create a file in the current folder 
(see Figure 7-23). Click the application and the file is created. You can then rename the file. However, 
to keep the proper file association, don’t change the file extension.
Copy, Move, Rename, or Delete Files or Folders
Use these handy tips to copy, move, rename, and delete files or folders using File Explorer or Windows 
Explorer:
	 To copy a file or folder, right-click it and select Copy from the shortcut menu. Then right-click in the 
white area of the folder where the copied item is to go and select Paste from the shortcut menu. You 
can also use the Cut and Paste commands to move an item to a new location.
	 Drag and drop an item to move or copy it to a new location. If the location is on the same drive as the 
original location, the file or folder will be automatically deleted from its original location. If you don’t 
want it deleted, hold down the Ctrl key while you drag and drop the item.
	 To rename a file or folder, right-click it and select Rename from the shortcut menu. Change the name 
and click off the file or folder to deselect it. You cannot rename a data file when an application has the 
file open; first close the data file and then rename it.
	 To delete a file or folder, select the item and press the Delete key. Or you can right-click the item and select Delete 
from the shortcut menu. Either way, a confirmation dialog box asks if you are sure you want to delete the item. 
If you click Yes, you send the file or folder and all its contents, including subfolders, to the Recycle Bin.
Notes In Windows, the difference between a window and a dialog box is that a window can be resized, but a dialog 
box cannot be resized.
	 To select multiple items to delete, copy, or move at the same time, hold down the Shift or Ctrl key as you 
click. To select several adjacent items in a list, click the first item and Shift-click the last item. To select 
nonadjacent items in a list, hold down the Ctrl key as you click each item.
Files deleted from the hard drive are stored in the Recycle Bin on the desktop. Emptying the Recycle Bin 
will free up your disk space. To empty the Recycle Bin, right-click the bin and select Empty Recycle Bin 
from the shortcut menu.
Notes In this chapter, you learn how to use File Explorer or Windows Explorer to create, copy, move, delete, and 
rename files and folders. In the chapter, “Maintaining Windows,” you will learn that you can do these same tasks using 
commands from a command prompt.
Create a Shortcut
To create a shortcut on the Windows desktop to a data file or program, use File Explorer or Windows 
Explorer to locate the data file or program file, right-click it, and click Create shortcut in the menu that 
appears. For example, in Figure 7-25, you can see a shortcut to the C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe 
program is about to be placed on the Windows desktop.

Control Panel
Control Panel is a window containing several small utility programs called applets that are used 
to manage hardware, software, users, and the system. (In general, a utility program is a program 
used to maintain a system or fix a computer problem.) To access Control Panel in Windows 8, 
right-click Start and click Control Panel. In Windows 7, click Start and click Control Panel.
By default, Control Panel appears in Category view where utilities are grouped by category. To switch to Classic 
view, click Category and select either Large icons or Small icons. Figure 7-26 shows the Windows 8 Control Panel 
in Small icons view. Use the Search box in the title bar to help find information and utilities in Control Panel.

	 The Sound applet is used to select a default speaker and microphone and adjust how Windows handles 
sounds.
	 Administrative Tools is a console rather than an applet. A console in Control Panel is a collection of 
support tools used by technicians to support Windows, hardware, applications, and users. Examples of 
Administrative Tools are Print Management, Computer Management, Event Viewer, and Services. You’ll 
learn to use these tools later in the text.
	 Windows Firewall puts up a shield to protect the system from outside attacks and to enforce security 
policies applied to the system.
	 Windows Defender is antivirus software embedded in Windows 8 that can detect, prevent, and clean 
up a system infected with viruses and other malware. Defender is included in Windows 7 but is not 
antivirus software and only protects against spyware, which is out to steal personal information on 
a computer. You’ll learn more about protection against malware in the chapter, “Security Strategies.”
	 BitLocker Drive Encryption is a Windows utility that works with the motherboard and hard drive 
to encrypt a drive so that, in the event a computer is lost or stolen, data on the drive cannot be read.
	 Action Center is an easy-to-use tool that can help nontechnical users solve simple problems with 
Windows, hardware, and applications.
	 The Folder Options applet lets you change how files and folders are displayed in File Explorer or 
Windows Explorer.
Folder Options
The Folder Options applet in Control Panel can be used to view and change options 
assigned to folders. These options control how users view the files in the folder and what 
they can do with these files. In File Explorer or Windows Explorer, Windows has an 
annoying habit of hiding file extensions if it knows which application is associated with 
a file extension. For example, just after installation, it hides .exe, .com, .sys, and .txt file extensions, 
but does not hide .docx, .pptx, or .xlsx file extensions until the software to open these files has been 
installed. Also, Windows really doesn’t want you to see its own system files, and it hides these files from 
view until you force it to show them.

A technician is responsible for solving problems with system files (files that belong to the Windows 
operating system) and file extensions. To fix problems with these files and extensions, you need to 
see them. To change folder options so you can view system files and file extensions in Windows 8/7, 
do the following:
1.	 Open Control Panel and, if necessary, change the view to Small icons view. Then click Folder Options. The 
Folder Options dialog box appears with the General tab selected (see Figure 7-28a). On the General tab, you 
can change settings for how Explorer browses folders and handles the navigation pane.
2.	 Click the View tab. Scroll down in the Advanced settings group and make these selections to show hidden 
information about files, folders, and drives, as shown in Figure 7-28b:
	 Select Show hidden files, folders, and drives.
	 Uncheck Hide extensions for known file types.
	 Uncheck Hide protected operating system files (Recommended) and respond to the Warning box.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know how to view hidden files and file extensions in File 
Explorer and Windows Explorer.
Here are the different power-saving states:
	 Sleep mode. Using Windows 8/7/Vista, you can put the computer into sleep mode, also called suspend 
mode, to save power when you’re not using the computer. If applications are open or other work is 
in progress, Windows first saves the current state, including open files, to memory and saves some of 
the work to the hard drive. Then everything is shut down except memory and enough of the system 
to respond to a wake-up. In sleep mode, the power light on the laptop might blink from time to time. 
(A laptop generally uses about 1 to 2 percent of battery power for each hour in sleep mode.) To wake 
up the computer, press the power button or, for some computers, press a key or touch the touch 
pad. Windows wakes up in about two seconds. When Windows is in sleep mode, it can still perform 
Windows updates and scheduled tasks. Windows can be configured to go to sleep after a period of 
inactivity, or you can manually put it to sleep. To put the system to sleep manually in Windows 8, you 
can use the charms bar as you learned to do earlier in the chapter. You can also open the Quick Launch 
menu, point to Shut down or sign out, and click Sleep (see Figure 7-29a). For Windows 7, click Start,

power button, Windows reloads its state, including all open applications and documents. When Windows is 
in sleep mode on a laptop and senses the battery is critically low, it will put the system into hibernation.
Notes Recall that hard drives are permanent or nonvolatile storage and memory is temporary or volatile storage. A hard 
drive does not require power to hold its contents, but memory, on the other hand, is volatile and loses its contents when it 
has no power. In hibernation, the computer has no power and everything must, therefore, be stored on the hard drive.

So what technical information are you looking at? Here is the rundown:
	 Windows 8/7 comes in several editions and you can see this system has the Windows 8.1 Professional 
edition installed.
	 The type of OS installed is a 64-bit OS. A 32-bit operating system processes 32 bits at a time, and  
a 64-bit operating system processes 64 bits at a time. Most editions of Windows 8/7 come in either  
32-bit or 64-bit versions. A 64-bit OS performs better than a 32-bit OS, but requires more memory. 
A 32-bit OS can support up to 4 GB of memory, and a 64-bit OS can support much more. The details 
of how much memory each edition of Windows can support are covered in the chapter, “Installing 
Windows.”
	 The processor installed is the Intel Core i5-2320 and about 4 GB of RAM is installed.
	 You can also see that Windows 8.1 is not activated. To activate Windows, make sure you’re connected 
to the Internet and click Activate Windows. The product key used during the installation will be verified 
during activation.
OS Differences Recall that Windows 8 offers free major updates and the only one Microsoft has published to date 
is Windows 8.1. However, Windows 7 handles major updates differently. A major update to Windows 7 is called a service 
pack, and the Windows 7 System window reports which service packs, if any, have been installed. See Figure 7-33. Minor 
updates or fixes that are released more frequently for Windows 8 or 7 are called patches and are not reported on the 
System window.

System Information Window
Turn to the System Information (msinfo32.exe) window for more details about a system, 
including installed hardware and software, the current system configuration, and currently 
running programs. For example, you can use it to find out what BIOS version is installed on 
the motherboard, how much RAM is installed, the directory where the OS is installed, the size 
of the hard drive, the names of currently running drivers, a list of startup programs, print jobs in progress, 
currently running tasks, and much more. Because the System Information window gives so much useful 
information, help desk technicians often ask a user on the phone to open it and read to the technician 
information about the computer.
When strange error messages appear during startup, use the System Information window to get a list of 
drivers that loaded successfully. Device drivers are small programs stored on the hard drive that tell the 
computer how to communicate with a specific hardware device such as a printer, network card, or scanner. 
If you have saved the System Information report when the system was starting successfully, comparing the 
two reports can help identify the problem device.
To run System Information in Windows 8, open the Quick Launch menu, click Run, enter msinfo32.exe 
in the Run box, and press Enter. In Windows 7, click Start, and enter msinfo32.exe in the Search box and 
press Enter. The System Information window for one computer is shown in Figure 7-34. To drill down to 
more information in the window, click items in the left pane.

can probably do it in a matter of minutes because it lists errors and issues that need attention 
and proposed solutions. The Action Center flag appears in the notification area of the taskbar. 
If the flag has a red X beside it, as shown in Figure 7-35, Windows considers the system has an important

Windows Network Connections
An essential task of IT technicians is to connect computers to a wired or wireless 
network and support these connections. Before we get into the Windows networking tools 
to help you, let’s start by looking at the ways Windows accesses resources on a network. 
If a network is public, such as a public hotspot at a local coffee shop, resources on the 
network aren’t shared. However, private networks often share their resources (for example, shared data 
files and printers). On private networks, Windows offers three ways to share resources: workgroups, 
homegroups, and domains.

1.5, 1.6
Windows Workgroup and Homegroup
A network that doesn’t have centralized control, such as one in a small office or home office 
(SOHO), is called a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Windows can access resources on a P2P 
network by using a workgroup or homegroup. Each can form a logical group of computers 
and users that share resources (see Figure 7-37), where administration, resources, and security 
on a workstation are controlled by that workstation.

In a Windows workgroup, each computer maintains a list of users and their rights on that particular 
computer. The computer allows a user on the network to access local resources based on the rights she has 
been given. In a homegroup, each computer shares files, folders, libraries, and printers with other computers 
in the homegroup. A homegroup provides less security than a workgroup because any user of any computer 
in the homegroup can access homegroup resources.

Windows Domain
A Windows domain is implemented on a larger, private network, such as a corporate or college 
network. The domain forms a logical group of networked computers that share a centralized 
directory database of user account information and security for the entire group of computers 
(see Figure 7-38). A Windows domain is a type of client/server network, which is a network

Notes When looking at the diagrams in Figure 7-37 and later in Figure 7-38, know that the connecting lines 
describe the logical connections between computers and not the physical connections. Both networks might be 
physically connected the same way, but logically, resources are controlled by each computer on the network or by using 
a centralized database. In network terminology, the arrangement of physical connections between computers is called 
the physical topology. The logical way the computers connect on a network is called the logical topology.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to contrast a workgroup, homegroup, and domain. You also need 
to know that homegroups only apply to Windows 8/7, but not to Windows Vista, which does not support homegroups.

Windows Server controls a network using the directory database called Active Directory. Each user on 
the network must have his own domain-level account called a global account, network ID, domain account, 
or global username, which is kept in Active Directory and assigned by the network or system administrator. 
If you are connecting a computer to a domain, the administrator will tell you the network ID and password 
to the domain that you can use to sign in to the network.
Notes If your computer is part of a domain, when Windows starts up, press Ctrl+Alt+Del to display a sign-in screen, 
and then enter your network ID and password.
Notes Windows Home Editions do not support joining a domain. If you plan to join a domain on your network, 
install Windows 8.1 Professional or Enterprise, or Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate editions.
Public and Private Networks
When you connect to a public network, such as when you connect your laptop to a 
public wireless network at a local airport, you always want to ensure that your computer 
is protected from outside hackers and malware. Windows 8 offers two types of network 
security:

	 Public network. When using Public network security, Windows configures strong firewall settings and 
you cannot join a homegroup or domain.
	 Private network. When using Private network security, you can join a homegroup or domain and share 
files and printers.
Windows 7 offers three network security options, which are managed by Network Discovery settings that 
allow this computer to see other computers on the network and other computers can see this computer:
	 Public network. Network Discovery is turned off and you cannot join a homegroup or domain. 
This option is the most secure.
	 Home network. Network Discovery is turned on and you can join a homegroup.
	 Work network. Network Discovery is turned on, you can join a domain, but you cannot join a 
homegroup.
MAKE a Windows 8 Network Connection
To make a wired connection to a network, unless you have an unusual network setup, simply 
plug in the network cable and Windows does the rest.
To create a wireless connection in Windows 8, you can use the charms bar or the Network 
icon in the taskbar on the Windows 8 desktop. Here are directions when using the charms bar:
1. On the charms bar, click the Settings charm, and then click the Network icon. A list of available wireless 
networks appears (see Figure 7-39a). Click one to select it, and then click Connect (see Figure 7-39b).

The details of securing and managing shared resources on a network and troubleshooting network 
connections are covered later in the text.
We now turn our attention to the various types of user accounts supported by Windows.
Windows User Accounts
A user must sign in to Windows with a valid user account to gain access to the OS. Windows 
supports various types and privileges for user accounts. Here’s a brief overview:
A+  
220-902 
1.1, 1.5, 
3.3
	 The scope of the account. A local account is created on the local computer and is recognized 
only on the local computer. As you have already learned, a network ID is created by a 
network administrator in a centralized database that manages an entire corporate network. When you 
sign in to Windows using a network ID, you are authenticated to the local computer and also to the 
Windows domain or network.
	 Privileges for the account. In Windows, there are two types of privileges assigned to a user account: an 
administrator account and a standard account. An administrator account has more privileges than a 
standard account and is used by those responsible for maintaining and securing the system. In addition, 
Windows 8 offers a third type of privilege: a child account that parents can set up for their children, 
which has very limited privileges.
	 A Microsoft account. For Windows 8, a Microsoft account is an email address, which allows you to 
access several types of online accounts, including Microsoft OneDrive, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, 
Skype, Outlook.com, and others. A Microsoft account is an example of a single sign-on (SSO) account, 
which accesses multiple, independent resources, systems, or applications after signing in one time to 
one account. To set up a Microsoft account, go to the live.com website and link an email address to the 
Microsoft account. The account is assigned a OneDrive, which is 15 GB of free storage space in the 
cloud. You can pay for additional storage, and you can also use Microsoft’s free cloud apps to manage 
data files stored on your OneDrive. A Microsoft account can be linked to a local account or a network 
ID and can be assigned the privileges of a standard account or an administrative account.

Create a Local Account
To create a local account, you must first sign in to Windows with an administrative account. In 
Windows 8, you can then create a new local account using the Settings charm, or you can create 
accounts using the Computer Management console, which is one of the Administrative Tools in Control 
Panel. In Windows 7, you can create accounts through the User Accounts applet in Control Panel or 
the Computer Management console.
In Windows 8, to use the Settings charm to create an account, do the following:
1.	 Sign in to Windows 8 using an administrator account. Open the Settings charm, and click Change 
PC settings. On the PC settings screen, click Accounts. On the Accounts screen, click Other accounts 
(see Figure 7-48).
Applying  Concepts

2.	 Click Add an account. The How will this person sign in? screen appears (see Figure 7-49) where you have four 
options:
	To set up an existing Microsoft account on this computer, enter the email address for the account, and 
click Next.
	To sign up for a new email address that will also be a Microsoft account, click Sign up for a new  
email address.
	To set up a child account, click Add a child’s account.
	To set up a regular local account (not a Microsoft account), click Sign in without a Microsoft account 
(not recommended), and click Next. Follow directions on screen to set up the account.

Apps purchased from the Windows Store 
can be synced with up to five computers

Microsoft account to sign in to Windows 
is that your private settings and access 
to your apps and online accounts are stored on the local computer. Therefore, you would only want to 
set up your Microsoft account on a computer where you trust those with administrative access to the 
computer. For many, this means using a Microsoft account only on your own personal computers that 
are under your complete control. When you are not signed in to Windows with your Microsoft account, 
you can still use a browser to access online accounts, including your OneDrive. See Figure 7-53.

then click Disconnect (see Figure 7-55).
Notes To connect a network ID on a domain to a Microsoft account, Group Policies controlling the Windows domain 
must allow it. After the connection, the Microsoft account is used to authenticate to the domain.
You’ll need to enter your name, gender, and birth date, and, for security purposes, you’ll need to associate 
a cell phone number and/or an alternate email address with the account. Be sure you write down your email 
address and password for your Microsoft account.

Recall that you can sign in to Windows using a local account, network ID, or Microsoft account. As you 
ponder the differences among these accounts, consider where the account is authenticated:
	 A local account is authenticated on the local computer and gives access to the local computer. An 
administrator local account has more access than a standard local account.
	 A network ID is authenticated by a computer on the network, which gives you access to the local 
computer and other resources on the network.
	 A Microsoft account is authenticated on the live.com website, which gives access to the local computer 
and online resources, such as OneDrive and Facebook.com. A Microsoft account can also be associated 
with a network ID so that you can sign in with the Microsoft account and be authenticated to the 
network as well as to live.com.
User Account Control DIALOG BOX
At some point while working with a computer to maintain or troubleshoot it, the User Account 
Control (UAC) dialog box, shown in Figure 7-56, will pop up. When the UAC box appears, if you 
are signed in as an administrator, all you have to do is click Yes to close the box and move on, as 
shown in Figure 7-56a. If the user account does not have administrative privileges, you’ll have the

The purposes of the UAC box are: (1) to prevent malicious background tasks from gaining administrative 
privileges when the administrator is signed in, and (2) to make it easier for an administrator to sign in using 
a less powerful user account for normal desktop activities, but still be able to perform administrative tasks 
while signed in as a regular user.
For example, suppose you’re signed in as an administrator with the UAC box turned off and click 
a malicious link on a website. Malware can download and install itself without your knowledge and 
might get admin privileges on the computer. If you’re signed in as a standard user and the UAC box is 
turned off, the malware might still install without your knowledge but with lesser privileges. The UAC 
box stands as a gatekeeper to malware installing behind your back because someone has to click  
the UAC box before the installation can proceed.
Control the UAC DIALOG BOX
Using Windows 8/7, you can control how the UAC box works. Do the following:
Applying  Concepts
3.	 Change when the UAC box appears. Here is a description of the four options shown in Figure 7-57:
	 Always notify me when apps try to install software or make other changes to the computer and when I make 
changes to Windows settings.
	 Notify me when apps try to make changes, but don’t notify me when I make changes to Windows settings. 
(This is the default setting.)
	 Same as the second option above but, in addition, do not dim the Windows desktop. Dimming the Windows 
desktop can alarm a user and take up resources.
	 Never notify me when apps try to install software or make changes to my computer or I make changes to 
Windows settings.

	Windows 8 File Explorer and Windows 7 Windows Explorer are used to manage files and folders on 
storage devices. Folders are organized in a top-down hierarchical structure of subfolders.
	The file extension indicates how the file contents are organized and formatted and what program 
uses the file.
	Control Panel gives access to a group of utility programs used to manage the system. Technicians 
generally prefer the Classic view for Control Panel.
	The Folder Options applet in Control Panel changes the way files and folders are displayed in Explorer.
	The Power Options applet in Control Panel manages power settings on a computer.
	The System window gives a quick overview of the system, including which edition and version of 
Windows is installed and the amount of installed memory.
	The System Information window gives much information about the computer, including hardware, 
device drivers, the OS, and applications.
	The Action Center is a centralized location used to solve problems with security and computer 
maintenance.
Windows Network Connections
	Windows 8/7 supports workgroups, homegroups, and domains to manage resources on a private 
network. Vista supports workgroups and domains.
	A network ID and password are used to authenticate to a Windows domain, which gives access to 
resources on the network.
	Windows 8 supports public and private settings for network security, and Windows 7 supports public, 
home, and work settings for network security.
	To connect to a wireless network in Windows 8, use the Settings charm or the Network icon in the 
taskbar on the desktop. Windows 7 uses the Network icon in the taskbar to connect to a wireless 
network.

	Use the Network and Sharing Center to view information about network connections and solve 
network problems.
	Use the System window to set up a computer to connect to a Windows domain.
Windows User Accounts
	Windows supports local accounts that are recognized only on the local computer and network IDs that 
are recognized on a Windows domain.
	Two main types of privileges can be assigned to a Windows account: An administrator account has 
more privileges than a standard account and is required when maintaining and securing a system.
	Windows 8 offers a Microsoft account that is authenticated online at the live.com website. The account 
is assigned a OneDrive, which is storage in the cloud.
	Use the Settings charm to manage Windows 8 user accounts. In Windows 7, use the User Accounts 
applet in Control Panel. For Windows 8/7, the Computer Management console in the Administrative 
Tools group in Control Panel can be used for advanced management of user accounts.
	You can associate a Microsoft account with a local account or network ID on a domain.
	The User Account Control box helps prevent malware from installing itself on a system. The UAC box 
settings are controlled in the User Accounts applet in Control Panel.

Real Problem 7-1 Using Windows Help and Support
The best IT support technicians are the ones continually teaching themselves new skills. You can teach 
yourself to use and support Windows by using the web and the Windows Help and Support utility. To start 
the utility in Windows 8, type Help and Support on the Start screen. In Windows 7, click Start and click 
Help and Support. If you are connected to the Internet, clicking links can take you to the Microsoft website 
where you can find information and watch videos about Windows.
Do the following to learn to research a topic so you can become an independent learner about Windows:
1.		 The Windows 8/7 Snipping Tool can help you take screen shots of the Windows desktop. These screen 
shots are useful when documenting computer problems and solutions. Use Windows Help and Support 
to find out how to use the Snipping Tool. Use it to take a screen shot of your Windows desktop. Save 
the screen shot into a file on a USB flash drive or on the hard drive. Print the file contents.
2.		 Windows 7 Home Premium, Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate editions all support the Aero 
interface. If you are using one of these editions, find out how to turn the Aero interface off and on. 
Describe the difference in the appearance of Windows when using Aero and not using it.
3.		 Access the support.microsoft.com website for Windows 8/7 support. Save or print one article from the 
Knowledge Base that addresses a problem when installing Windows 8/7.
4.		 Search the web for the purpose of the Pagefile.sys file. What website did you use to find your 
answer? Why is the Microsoft.com website considered the best source for information about the 
Pagefile.sys file?

Real Problem 7-2 Documenting How to Use Windows 8
This real problem requires a microphone, and a webcam would also be useful. Make a screen recording 
with voice-over to teach end users how to use Windows 8. Do the following:
1.		 Screencast-O-Matic offers free software to make a screen recording with voice and video. Go to 
screencast-o-matic.com and launch the online video recording software. You might be required to 
download and install the software.
2.		 Select a Windows 8 feature to explain. For example, you can explain how to open and close an app, 
install or uninstall an app, create a new user account, empty the Recycle Bin, or use the charms bar or 
search feature. You or your instructor might have other ideas.
3.		 Use the Screencast-O-Matic software to make a screen recording to show how to use the Windows 8 
feature you selected. The recording should be no longer than three minutes. Explain the steps as you 
go. The software records your screen movements, your voice (if a microphone is detected), and video 
(if a webcam is detected).
4.		 View the video. If you see a problem, record it again. When you’re satisfied with your video, save it as 
an MP4 file.
Real Problem 7-3 Launching the Windows 8 Desktop at Startup
Some users prefer to go directly to the Windows 8 desktop rather than to the Start screen at Windows 
startup. To make this change, you’ll need Windows 8.1 installed. Go to the Windows desktop, right-click 
the taskbar, and click Properties. In the Taskbar and Navigation properties box, click the Navigation tab. 
Then check When I sign in or close all apps on a screen, go to the desktop instead of Start. See Figure 7-58. 
Apply your changes. When you next sign in to Windows, you are taken directly to the desktop.

indows 8, 7, and Vista all share the same basic Windows 
architecture, and all have similar characteristics. Windows 8 
includes a free upgrade to Windows 8.1 via the Windows Store. 
Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 are available for purchase directly 
from Microsoft, but you can no longer purchase Windows 8.0 or 
Vista. (However, Windows 8.0 and Vista can be purchased from other 
vendors.) Mainstream support of Windows Vista by Microsoft ended 
in 2012, and extended support is slated to end in 2017. Because many 
individual users and corporations still rely on Vista, you still need to 
know how to support it.
By the time this text is published, Windows 10 should be available. 
How to install and support Windows 10 is not covered in this text.

Installing Windows
How to Plan a Windows Installation
As an IT support technician, you can expect to be called on to install Windows in a variety of 
situations. You might need to install Windows on a new hard drive, after an existing Windows 
installation has become corrupted, or to upgrade from one OS to another. Many decisions need to 
be made before the installation, and most of these decisions apply to any Windows operating system.
Choose the Edition, License, and Version of Windows
When buying a Windows operating system, know that the price is affected by the Windows 
edition and type of license you purchase. You also need to decide between 32-bit and 64-bit 
architecture. In this part of the chapter, you learn about your options when purchasing 
Windows and how to make sure your computer qualifies for the version and edition  
you’ve selected.
Editions of Windows
Windows 8 provides a choice of these editions designed to satisfy a variety of consumer needs:
	 Windows 8.1 is the edition of choice for a laptop or desktop computer used in a home or small office. 
This edition supports homegroups, but it doesn’t support joining a domain or BitLocker Encryption.
	 Windows 8.1 Professional (Windows 8.1 Pro) includes additional features at a higher price, while 
Windows 8.1 Pro for Students is available for a lower price to students, faculty, and staff at eligible 
institutions. Windows Pro Pack can be installed on a Windows 8.1 machine to add the functionality of 
Windows 8.1 Pro to the more basic edition. Windows 8.1 Pro supports homegroups, joining a domain, 
BitLocker, Client Hyper-V, Remote Desktop, and Group Policy. (You’ll learn about these tools later in 
the text.)
	 Windows 8.1 Enterprise allows for volume licensing in a large, corporate environment.
	 Windows RT, a lighter edition, is available for tablets, netbooks, and other mobile devices.
Windows 7 editions include Windows 7 Starter, Windows 7 Home Basic, Windows 7 Home Premium, 
Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Enterprise, and Windows 7 Ultimate. Each edition comes at a 
different price with different features and capabilities.
Editions of Windows Vista are Windows Vista Starter, Windows Vista Home Basic, Windows Vista Home 
Premium, Windows Vista Business, Windows Vista Enterprise, and Windows Vista Ultimate.

OEM, Full Retail, or Upgrade Retail License
When buying Windows, you can purchase a retail license or an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) 
license. The OEM license costs less but can be installed only on a new computer. The boxed retail package 
contains the 32-bit DVD and 64-bit DVD (see Figure 8-1). You can also purchase and download Windows 
8.1 from the Microsoft online store at microsoftstore.com. The retail license costs less if you purchase a 
license to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8.1 using Microsoft’s Windows 8.1 Upgrade Assistant, 
as explained below. You are required to purchase the Windows 8.1 full license for a new computer or any 
computer that has an OS other than Windows 8 or Windows 7 installed.
Notes An antitrust ruling (a ruling to break up monopolies) in Europe requires that Microsoft must offer editions 
of Windows that do not include multimedia utilities. Windows 8.1 and 7, therefore, come in N, K, and KN editions that 
do not include Windows Media Player and other media technologies or, in Windows 8.1, some media apps such as Sound 
Recorder and Skype. If you have an N or KN edition of Windows, you can, however, legally download the utilities from 
the Microsoft website.

32-Bit or 64-Bit Architecture
Recall that an operating system can process 32 bits 
or 64 bits at a time. A 64-bit installation of Windows 
generally performs better than a 32-bit installation 
if you have enough RAM. Table 8-1 shows how 
much RAM popular editions of Windows can 
support. Another advantage of 64-bit installations 
of Windows is they can support 64-bit applications, 
which run faster than 32-bit applications. Even 
though you can install 32-bit applications in a 64-bit 
OS, for best performance, always choose 64-bit 
applications. Keep in mind that 64-bit installations 
of Windows require 64-bit device drivers.
Figure 8-1  A Windows 8.1 package comes with two DVDs 
and one product key
Notes The Windows 8.1 setup DVD is the same 
whether you’re upgrading from Windows 7 or performing 
a clean installation. However, you cannot use an OEM 
disk for an upgrade installation.
Notes All processors (CPUs) used in personal computers today are hybrid processors and can handle a 32-bit or 
64-bit OS. However, the Intel Itanium and Xeon processors used in high-end workstations and servers are true 64-bit 
processors and require a 64-bit OS.
Notes How much memory or RAM you can install in a computer depends not only on the OS installed, but also on 
how much memory the motherboard can hold. To know how much RAM a motherboard can support, see the motherboard 
documentation.

Verify Your System Qualifies for Windows
The minimum hardware requirements for Windows 8/7/Vista are listed in Table 8-2. (These 
minimum requirements are also the Microsoft recommended requirements.) In addition to the 
requirements listed, Microsoft added to Windows 8 requirements three technologies used by the 
processor (NX, PAE, and SSE2). All processors built in the last 10 years use these technologies, 
so the move was intended to not allow Windows 8 to be installed on a system that was older than 10 years. 
Know, however, that Microsoft occasionally changes the minimum and recommended requirements for an OS.

Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant
The simplest way to find out if a system can be upgraded to Windows 8.1 is to download, install, and run 
the Windows 8.1 Upgrade Assistant (called the Upgrade Advisor in Windows 7). You can find the software 
and instructions on how to use it at windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-from-windows-7- 
tutorial. Microsoft also offers the Windows Compatibility Center at microsoft.com/windows/compatibility 
(see Figure 8-2). You can search under both software and hardware to find out if they are compatible with 
Windows 8.1. The site sometimes offers links to patches or fixes for a program or device so that it will 
work with Windows 8.1. Before you upgrade to Windows 8.1, research each item that’s not compatible, 
install an update if available, or uninstall the software or device. You can deal with most problems after 
Windows 8.1 is installed unless it’s a critical device such as your network adapter. (You don’t want to 
install Windows 8.1 only to find out later you can’t access the network or Internet.)
Figure 8-2  Use the Windows 8.1 Compatibility Center to find out if your hardware and software  
qualify for Windows 8.1
Notes Websites change often. If you can’t find the Upgrade Assistant at the link given, try this search string using 
google.com: windows 8.1 upgrade assistant site: microsoft.com.
Notes The three processor technologies are NX (Never Execute or No Execute), which prevents malware from hiding 
in the data storage area of another program; PAE (Physical Address Extension), which was originally intended to allow 
32-bit processors to use more than 4 GB of RAM but is no longer used for that purpose because it gave device drivers  
a big headache; and SSE2 (Streaming SIMD Extensions 2), which allows a processor to execute a single instruction  
multiple times.

MBR or GPT Partitioning System
You need to be aware of the partitioning method you will use on the hard drive. A hard drive is divided 
into one or more partitions. Windows can use one of two methods to partition a hard drive: The master 
Boot Record (MBR) method is older, allows for four partitions, and is limited to 2-TB drives. The GUID 
Partition Table (GPT) method is newer, allows for any size hard drive, and, for Windows, can have up to 
128 partitions on the drive. GPT is required for drives larger than 2 TB.
When an MBR or GPT partition is formatted with a file system and assigned a drive letter (such as  
drive C:), it is called a volume. A file system is the overall structure an OS uses to name, store, and 
organize files on a volume, and Windows is 
always installed on a volume that uses the NTFS 
file system. For most installations, you install 
Windows on the only hard drive in the computer 
and allocate all the space on the drive to one 
partition that Windows setup calls drive C:. 
Windows is installed in the C:\Windows folder.
UEFI or Legacy BIOS Firmware
To understand if your system qualifies for 
Windows 8/7, it helps to understand how 
Windows relates to hardware by using device 
drivers and system UEFI/BIOS, as shown in 
Figure 8-3. (In the figure, the kernel is that 
part of Windows responsible for relating to 
hardware.)
When a computer is first turned on, it uses 
some devices such as the keyboard, monitor, 
and hard drive before the OS starts up. The 
motherboard UEFI/BIOS is contained on a 
chip on the motherboard (see Figure 8-4) and 
manages these essential devices. This chip 
is called a firmware chip because it holds 
programs.

Installing Windows
Older motherboards use firmware called BIOS (basic input/output system). A much-improved 
replacement for BIOS is UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), which stores its setup information 
and some drivers on the motherboard and also on the hard drive. Most motherboards today support a 
combination of the two types of firmware, commonly called UEFI/BIOS. The motherboard UEFI/BIOS 
provides three main functions:
	 The system UEFI/BIOS contains instructions for running essential hardware devices before an ­operating 
system is started. After the OS is started, it might continue to use system UEFI/BIOS or use device 
­drivers to communicate with these devices.
	 The startup UEFI/BIOS starts the computer and finds a boot device that contains an operating system. 
Boot devices that a system might support include an internal or external hard drive, CD or DVD drive, 
bootable USB flash drive, and the network. After it finds a boot device, the firmware turns the startup 
process over to the OS.
	 The setup UEFI/BIOS is used to change motherboard settings. You can use it to enable or disable a 
device on the motherboard (for example, the network port, video port, or USB ports), change the date 
and time that is later passed to the OS, and select the order of boot devices for startup UEFI/BIOS to 
search when looking for an operating system to load.
Most computers today give you the option of using UEFI or legacy BIOS to manage booting the 
computer and turning it over to the operating system. Legacy BIOS in UEFI firmware is called UEFI CSM 
(Compatibility Support Module) mode. You must make your selection of which firmware mode you will 
use before you install Windows. Here are points to help you decide:
	 UEFI and the GPT partitioning system for the hard drive work only with 64-bit versions of Windows 8/7.  
However, a 32-bit version of Windows 8/7 can read and write to a GPT disk but not boot from it.
	 If the computer has a hard drive larger than 2 TB, you must use UEFI firmware, the GPT partition 
­system, and a 64-bit version of Windows.
	 UEFI has a security system called Secure Boot, which helps to prevent malware from hijacking a 
system during or before the operating system load. UEFI and Windows work together to ensure that no 
unsecured device driver, application, or OS component is loaded. If you want to use Secure Boot, you 
must use UEFI, GPT, and a 64-bit edition of Windows.
	 To install Windows on an MBR hard drive, you must run UEFI in CSM mode. To install Windows on a 
GPT drive, you must use UEFI and disable CSM mode.
Notes Solid-state drives are faster than magnetic hard drives because they have no moving parts. USB flash drives 
are also solid-state devices. Some hard drives might be hot-swappable, which means the hard drives are inserted into an 
easily accessible hot-swap bay and can be exchanged without powering down the system.
Select the Firmware Mode
So how do you select your firmware mode before you start the Windows installation? 
Follow these steps:

1. To access UEFI/BIOS setup, press a key, such as Del or F2, early in the boot process 
before Windows starts to load. When the UEFI/BIOS setup screen appears, look for a 
screen to manage the boot. For example, the Boot screen for one motherboard’s firmware is shown 
in Figure 8-5.

Installing Windows
Device Drivers
Device drivers are small programs stored on the hard drive that tell the computer how to communicate 
with a specific hardware device such as a printer, network card, or scanner. These drivers are installed on 
the hard drive when the OS is first installed, or when new hardware is added to the system. A device driver 
is written to work for a specific OS, such as Windows 8.1 or 7. In addition, a 32-bit OS requires 32-bit 
drivers, and a 64-bit OS requires 64-bit drivers.
Windows provides some device drivers, and the manufacturer of the hardware device provides others. 
When you purchase a printer, video card, digital camera, scanner, or other hardware device, a CD that 
contains the device drivers is usually bundled with the device along with a user manual (see Figure 8-8). 
You can also download the drivers for a device from the manufacturer’s website.
 
b.  On the Boot screen (Figure 8-5), click Secure Boot. In the Secure Boot menu, select Other OS 
for the OS Type (see Figure 8-7).

To use UEFI firmware and the GPT partitioning system, use these same screens to disable CSM  
(see Figure 8-6) and set the OS Type to Windows UEFI mode (see Figure 8-7).

Be sure you have the correct Windows device drivers for all your critical devices such as your network 
card or motherboard. To find the drivers, look on the CD that came bundled with the device or check the 
website of the device manufacturer. Remember that a 64-bit OS requires all 64-bit drivers.
If you are not sure if your devices will work with Windows 8/7, one solution is to set up a dual boot.  
A dual boot, also called a multiboot, allows you to install the new OS without disturbing the old one so 
you can boot to either OS. After the installation, you can test your software or hardware. If they work 
under the new OS, you can delete the old one. If they don’t work, you can still boot to the old OS and use 
it. How to set up a dual boot is covered later in this chapter.
If you have applications written for Windows 7 or Vista that are not compatible with Windows 8, you 
can use compatibility mode to solve the problem. Compatibility mode is a group of settings that can be 
applied to older drivers or applications that might cause them to work in Windows 8. You learn more 
about compatibility mode later in this chapter.
Prepare for an Upgrade
On a computer with Windows 7 installed, access the Microsoft website windows.microsoft.com/en-US/
windows-8/upgrade-from-windows-7-tutorial and locate, download, and run the Windows 8.1 Upgrade 
Assistant to find out if the computer is ready for a Windows 8.1 installation. Make a list of any 
hardware or software components found to be incompatible with Windows 8.1, and draw up a plan 
for getting the system ready for a Windows 8.1 upgrade.

Installing Windows
When the Computer Does Not Have a DVD Drive
You can buy Windows 8.1 on DVD or download it from the Internet. If the computer does not have a 
DVD drive, consider these options:
	 Download Windows 8.1 from the Microsoft website. Purchase Windows 8.1 on the Microsoft website 
(microsoftstore.com), download it to your computer’s hard drive, and install it from there. This option 
assumes the computer already has a working OS installed. You can also follow directions on the website 
to create a bootable USB flash drive with the files you downloaded and install Windows using this USB 
flash drive.
	 Use an external DVD drive. Use an external DVD drive, which will most likely connect to the computer 
by way of a USB port. If the computer does not already have an OS installed, you must boot from this 
USB port. To do so, access UEFI/BIOS setup and set the boot order for the USB as the first boot device. 
The boot order is the order of devices that startup UEFI/BIOS looks to for an OS. Recall you can enter 
UEFI/BIOS setup by pressing a key at startup. Then locate the appropriate UEFI/BIOS setup screen. For 
example, the BIOS setup screen shown in Figure 8-9 shows a removable device as the first boot device. 
You can then boot from the external DVD drive and install Windows.
Figure 8-9  Set the boot order in BIOS setup

	 Use a DVD drive on another computer on the network. Share the DVD drive on another computer onto 
the network. Then go to the computer that is to receive the Windows installation and locate the DVD 
drive on the network. Double-click the setup.exe program to run the installation across the network. 
Alternately, you can copy the files on the DVD from the other computer to your hard drive. Again, this 
option assumes the computer already has a working OS installed. How to share folders and drives on a 
network is covered later in this text.
Factory Recovery Partition
If you have a laptop computer or a brand-name computer, such as a Dell, IBM, or Gateway, and you need 
to reinstall Windows, follow the recovery procedures given by the computer manufacturer. A hard drive 
is divided into one or more partitions, and the hard drive on a brand-name computer is likely to have a 
hidden recovery partition that contains a recovery utility and installation files.

To access the utilities on the hidden partition so that you can perform a repair installation, press a key 
during startup. The key to press is displayed on the screen early in the boot before the OS is loaded. If you 
don’t see the message, search the website of the computer manufacturer to find the key combination. For 
one Dell laptop, you press Ctrl + F11 to start the recovery. One Gateway computer displays the message 
Press F11 to start recovery. When you press these keys, a menu displays, giving you the opportunity to 
reinstall Windows from setup files kept in the hidden partition.
Sometimes a manufacturer puts a utility in this hidden partition that can be used to create recovery 
discs (see Figure 8-10). However, the discs must have already been created if they are to be there to help 
you in the event the entire hard drive fails. You might also be able to purchase these CDs or DVDs on the 
computer manufacturer’s website.

Installation in a Virtual Computer
Another type of Windows installation is when you install Windows in a virtual computer. A virtual computer 
or virtual machine (VM) is software that simulates the hardware of a physical computer. Using this software, 
you can install and run multiple operating systems at the same time on a single computer, which is called the 
host machine. These multiple instances of operating systems can be used to train users, run legacy software, 
and support multiple operating systems. For example, help-desk technicians can run a virtual machine for 
each OS they support on a single computer and quickly and easily switch from one OS to another by clicking 
a window. Another reason to use a virtual machine is that you can capture screen shots of the boot process 
in a virtual machine, which is the way the screen shots during the boot were made for this text.
Notes In general, it’s best not to upgrade an OS on a laptop unless you want to use some feature the new OS offers. 
For laptops, follow the general rule, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Many hardware components in a laptop are propri-
etary, and the laptop manufacturer is the only source for these drivers. If you are considering upgrading a laptop to 
Windows 8.1, check the laptop manufacturer’s website for advice and to download Windows 8.1 drivers, which are called 
third-party drivers because they are not included in UEFI/BIOS or Windows. It’s very important you have available a 
Windows 8.1 driver for your network port without having to depend on the network or Internet to get one after Windows 
8.1 is installed. Also know that many Windows 7 drivers work with Windows 8.1.

Installing Windows
Software used to manage VMs installed on a workstation is called a hypervisor. Some popular 
hypervisors for Windows are Client Hyper-V and Virtual PC by Microsoft (www.microsoft.com), VirtualBox 
by Oracle (www.virtualbox.org), and VMware Player by VMware, Inc. (www.vmware.com). Client Hyper-V 
is embedded in Windows 8 Pro or Enterprise, but is not available for other Windows releases. Virtual PC 
is free for download in all other editions of Windows 7 or 8 except Windows 7 Starter. VirtualBox and 
VMware Player are freeware. Be aware that virtual machine programs require a lot of memory and might 
slow down your system. Figure 8-11 shows two virtual machines running under VirtualBox.
If you are upgrading many computers to Windows 8.1 in a large enterprise, more automated methods 
are used for installations. Installation files are made available over the network or on bootable USB flash 
drives or DVDs. These automated methods are discussed later in this chapter.
Install and Run VirtualBox
Hands-On  Project 8-2
Notes If you don’t want to use VirtualBox as your hypervisor, you can substitute another client hypervisor, 
such as VMware Player or Client Hyper-V. Note that Client Hyper-V does not play well on the same computer with 
other hypervisors, and can cause problems such as failed network connectivity. For that reason, don’t enable 
Hyper-V on a Windows 8 computer that has another hypervisor installed.
On a Windows 8/7 computer, go to the Oracle VirtualBox website (www.virtualbox.com) and download and install 
VirtualBox on your computer. To set up a new virtual machine, open VirtualBox and click New at the top of the 
VirtualBox window. The Create Virtual Machine box shown in Figure 8-12 appears. Assign the VM a name and select 
Windows 8.1 (32 bit) from the Version drop-down menu. Click Next. Leave the default memory size selection of 
1024 MB and click Next. Be sure that Create a virtual hard drive now is checked and click Create.

Notes Windows XP Mode, which CompTIA calls virtual XP mode, is a Windows XP installation that runs under 
Virtual PC, and can be installed on a Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate computer. When you install an OS 
in Virtual PC, normally you must have a valid product key for the installation, but an XP product key is not required for 
XP Mode. Windows XP Mode is not supported in Windows 8, although it is still possible to install Windows XP in a virtual 
machine in Windows 8.

A wizard launches and steps you through the process of creating a new machine. During the process, you can 
select the virtual machine file type, the type of space allocation for the VM’s hard drive, and the hard drive size. 
For the hard drive file type, make sure the default selection VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) is checked (unless 
directed otherwise by your instructor), and click Next.
Be sure the default selection Dynamically allocated is checked so that space on the physical computer’s hard 
drive is used only when it’s needed by the VM. Click Next. Change the size of the virtual hard drive to 16 GB, as 
shown at the bottom of Figure 8-13, and click Create. When you complete the wizard, the new virtual machine is 
listed in the VirtualBox window.

Installing Windows
Choose the Type of Installation: In-Place Upgrade,
Clean Install, or Dual Boot
If you are installing Windows on a new hard drive, you must perform a clean install. If an OS 
is already installed on the hard drive, you have three choices:
  Clean install. You can perform a clean install, overwriting the existing operating system 
and applications. In the Windows setup program, a clean install is called a custom installation. 
The main advantage of a clean install is that problems with the old OS are not carried forward and you 
get a fresh start. During the installation, you will have the option to reformat the hard drive, erasing 
everything on the drive. If you don’t format the drive, the data will still be on the drive. The previous 
operating system settings and user profiles are collectively stored in the Windows.old folder that setup 
creates on the hard drive. After Windows is installed, you will need to install the applications. After 
you’re sure the new installation is working as expected, you can delete the Windows.old folder to save 
space on the drive. Windows 8 automatically deletes most of the content of this folder 28 days after the 
installation.
	 In-place upgrade. If the upgrade path allows it, you can perform an in-place upgrade installation.  
An in-place upgrade is a Windows installation that is launched from the Windows desktop and the 
installation carries forward user settings and installed applications from the old OS to the new one.  
A Windows OS is already in place before you begin the new installation. An in-place upgrade is faster 
than a clean install and is appropriate if the system is generally healthy and does not have problems. 
In order to perform an in-place upgrade, Microsoft requires that certain editions and versions of 
Windows be installed already. These qualifying OSs are called upgrade paths. Table 8-3 outlines the 
acceptable upgrade paths for Windows 8.1. There is no upgrade path from Windows Vista or XP to 
Windows 8.1. Even though you can purchase an upgrade license to install Windows 8.1 on these  
systems, you must perform a clean install.
A+  
220-902 
1.1, 1.2
Notes You can upgrade to a higher edition of Windows 8 or 8.1 by using the Add features to Windows 8 or Add 
features to Windows 8.1 option within Windows, which essentially means that you’re purchasing the Pro Pack through 
Windows directly. The upgrade is easy to do and does not require going through the entire upgrade process.
OS Differences Because Windows 7 is quickly becoming outdated, most likely you won’t be asked to upgrade a 
computer to Windows 7. However, if you need to see the upgrade paths to Windows 7, do a google.com web search on 
windows 7 upgrade paths site:technet.microsoft.com.

	 Multiboot. You can install Windows in a second partition on the hard drive and create a dual-
boot ­situation with the other OS, or even install three OSs, each in its own partition in a multiboot 
­environment. Don’t create a dual boot unless you need two operating systems, such as when you need to 
verify that applications and hardware work under Windows 8.1 before you delete the old OS. Windows 
8/7/Vista all require that they be the only operating system installed on a partition. So to set up a dual 
boot, you’ll need at least two partitions on the hard drive or a second hard drive.
In addition to the information given in Table 8-3, keep in mind these tips:
	 A 64-bit version of Windows can only be upgraded to a 64-bit OS. A 32-bit OS can only be upgraded to 
a 32-bit OS.
	 If you want to install a 64-bit version of Windows on a computer that already has a 32-bit OS installed, 
you must perform a clean install.
	 You cannot upgrade from Windows XP or Vista to Windows 8, and you cannot upgrade from XP to 
Windows 7. You must perform a clean install.
Understand the Choices You’ll Make during the Installation
While Windows is installing, you must choose which drive and partition to install Windows, 
the size of a new partition, and how Windows will connect to the network. Next you learn 
about what might affect your decisions regarding the size of the Windows partition and how 
Windows will connect to the network.
The Size of the Windows Partition
For a clean install or dual boot, you can decide to not use all the available space on the drive for the 
Windows partition. Here are reasons to not use all the available space:
	 You plan to install more than one OS on the hard drive, creating a dual-boot system. For example, 
you might want to install Windows 7 on one partition and leave room for another partition where you 
intend to install Windows 8.1, so you can test software under both operating systems. (When setting up 
a dual boot, always install the older OS first.)
	 Some people prefer to use more than one partition or volume to organize data on their hard drives. For 
example, you might want to install Windows and all your applications on one partition and your data 
on another. Having your data on a separate partition makes backing up easier. In another situation, you 
might want to set up a volume on the drive that is used exclusively to hold backups of data on another 
computer on the network. The size of the partition that will hold Windows 8/7 and its applications 
should be at least 16 GB for a 32-bit install and 20 GB for the 64-bit install, but a larger volume is 
nearly always preferred.
A+  
220-902 
1.1, 1.2, 
1.6
Caution
It’s convenient to back up one volume to another volume on a different hard drive. However, don’t back 
up one volume to another volume on the same hard drive, because when a hard drive fails, quite often all volumes on the 
drive are damaged and you will lose both your data and your backup.
Later in this text, you learn to use the Disk Management utility after Windows is installed to create 
partitions from unallocated space and to resize, delete, and split existing partitions.
Network Configuration
Recall from the chapter, “Survey of Windows Features and Support Tools,” that all editions of Windows 
8/7/Vista can join a workgroup, Windows 8/7 can join a homegroup, and business editions of Windows 8/7 
can join a homegroup or Windows domain. (Vista does not support homegroups.) To join a domain, you’ll

Installing Windows
need the network ID and password assigned to you by the network administrator of the private network. 
To join a homegroup, you’ll need the password to the homegroup, and to join a workgroup, you’ll need the 
name of the workgroup. You can connect to a workgroup, homegroup, or domain during the installation, 
or you can wait and make the connection after the installation is complete.
You also need to know that the Windows installation process usually has no problems connecting to 
the network and the Internet without your help. However, you might need to know how the IP address is 
assigned. An IP address uniquely identifies a computer on the network. It might be assigned dynamically 
(IP address is assigned by a server each time the workstation connects to the network) or statically 
(IP address is permanently assigned to the workstation). If the network is using static IP addressing, 
you need the IP address for the workstation.
Notes For new installations, look for the product key written on the cover of the Windows setup DVD, on a card 
inside the DVD case, or affixed to the back of the Windows documentation booklet, as shown in Figure 8-14. If you are 
reinstalling Windows on an existing system and you can’t find the product key documentation, you can download and run 
freeware to tell you the key. For example, try Magical Jelly Bean freeware at magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder.

How to Plan a Windows Installation
8
Before getting into the step-by-step instructions of installing an OS, here are some general tips about 
installing Windows:
	 Verify you have all application software CDs or DVDs available and all device drivers.
	 Back up all important data on the drive. How to perform backups is covered in the chapter, 
“Maintaining Windows.”
	 For upgrade installations and clean installs in which you do not plan to reformat the hard drive, run 
antivirus/anti-malware software to make sure the drive is free from malware. If Windows will not start 
and you suspect malware might be a problem, plan to reformat the hard drive during the installation so 
you know the hard drive is clean of malware.
	 If you want to begin the installation by booting from the Windows setup DVD or other media such as a 
USB device, use UEFI/BIOS setup to verify that the boot sequence is first the optical drive or USB device, 
and then the hard drive.
	 In UEFI/BIOS setup, disable any virus protection setting that prevents the boot area of the hard drive 
from being altered.
	 For a system that uses UEFI firmware, set the firmware to use UEFI mode (to use GPT and possibly 
Secure Boot) or UEFI CSM mode (to use MBR partitions on the hard drive). Know that Windows will 
install on a GPT drive only when UEFI CSM mode is disabled and will install on an MBR drive only 
when UEFI CSM mode is enabled.
	 For a laptop computer, connect the AC adapter and use this power source for the complete OS 
installation, updates, and installation of hardware and applications. You don’t want the battery to  
fail in the middle of the installation process.

Installing Windows
Steps to Perform a Windows 8.1 In-Place Upgrade
The Windows 8.1 upgrade package comes with a 32-bit DVD and a 64-bit DVD. The product 
key is on a card found in a slip pocket inside the box. Here are the steps to perform an 
in-place upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8.1 when you’re working with a Windows 8.1 
setup DVD:
1. As with any upgrade installation, before you start the upgrade, do the following:
 
a. Scan the system for malware using an updated version of anti-malware software. When you’re done, 
be sure to close the anti-malware application so it’s not running in the background.
 
b. Uninstall any applications or device drivers you don’t intend to use in the new installation.
 
c. Make sure your backups of important data are up to date and then close any backup software 
running in the background.
2. Insert the Windows 8.1 setup DVD. If the setup program doesn’t start automatically and the AutoPlay 
dialog box doesn’t open, open Windows Explorer and double-click the setup.exe program in the root of 
the DVD. Respond to the UAC box. The setup program loads files, examines the system, and reports any 
problems it finds. If it finds the system meets minimum hardware requirements, setup asks permission to 
go online for updates (see Figure 8-15). Make your selection and click Next.

Installing Windows 8.1 and Windows 7
In this part of the chapter, you learn the steps to install Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 as an 
in-place upgrade, clean install, and dual boot, and how to handle the special situation of using 
a Windows upgrade product key to install Windows on a new hard drive. As you install and 
configure software, be sure to document what you did. This documentation will be helpful 
for future maintenance and troubleshooting. In a project at the end of this chapter, you will develop a 
documentation template.
Let’s begin with how to perform an in-place upgrade of Windows 8.1.

4. The License terms window 
appears. Check I accept the 
license terms and click Accept.
5. On the Choose what to keep 
window (see Figure 8-17), 
decide what you want to 
do with Windows settings, 
personal files, and apps:
	 The first two options perform 
upgrades to Windows 8.1.
	 The Nothing option  
performs a clean install 
of Windows 8.1. Everything on drive C: is deleted and the Windows.old folder is created, which holds 
files from the old installation. Other volumes on the hard drive are not disturbed.
For an upgrade installation, choose the first option and click Next. On the next screen, verify the choices 
listed and click Install to begin the installation.

8. If the computer is connected to the Internet, on the next screen, you are given the opportunity to enter 
a Microsoft account that you can use to sign in to Windows (see Figure 8-19). Recall that a Microsoft 
account is associated with an email address registered at live.com. You also have the option to continue 
using a local account or domain account, although setup makes the option a little difficult to find.
Notes An in-place upgrade uses the existing selections for network connections and hard drive volumes; therefore, 
you’re not asked to make these decisions during the upgrade process.
Notes When setup recognizes that it cannot perform an upgrade, but must perform a clean install, the first option 
on the window in Figure 8-17 is missing.

Windows 8.1 Upgrade from Microsoft Website
You just saw how to perform an upgrade using the Windows setup DVD. You can  
also download from the Microsoft website the files you need to perform the upgrade.  
To do that, Microsoft requires you first run the Upgrade Assistant. Here’s how to  
get started:
1. After you have your Windows computer ready to upgrade, go to windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/ 
windows-8/upgrade-assistant-download-online-faq. Download and run the Windows 8.1 Upgrade 
Assistant. Make sure you have Windows 8.1 device drivers already downloaded for critical devices such 
as your network adapter.
2. If you’re ready to proceed with the upgrade, click Next to continue.
3. The Choose what to keep window appears (refer back to Figure 8-17). Choose Keep Windows settings, 
personal files, and apps, and then click Next.
4. On the next screen, Microsoft recommends the right edition of Windows (see Figure 8-22). To buy the 
edition, click Order. On the next screen, click Checkout.
A+  
220-902 
1.2, 1.6
5. Follow directions on screen to enter your name, phone number, email address, and billing address, and 
pay for and start the download.
6. After the download completes, the Install Windows 8 screen appears. You can click Install now to 
continue with the installation. If you click Install by creating media, you are given the opportunity to 
create a bootable USB flash drive or DVD that contains the Windows setup files. Later, you can use the 
USB flash drive or DVD to perform the upgrade or a clean install of Windows 8.1. You’re also given the 
opportunity to save the setup files to an ISO file. An ISO file, also called an ISO image or disc image, is 
an International Organization for Standardization image of an optical disc and includes the file system 
used. An ISO file has an .iso file extension. As you’ll see later in the chapter, the ISO file is a handy tool 
when you want to install Windows in a virtual machine.

Windows 7 in-Place Upgrade
When would you ever be called on to upgrade a Vista system to Windows 7? Suppose a Vista 
computer has several applications and device drivers installed that will not work in Windows 
8.1, but will work in Windows 7. An in-place upgrade to Windows 7 will improve performance 
and security without having to deal with the hassle and expense of incompatible apps and 
drivers in Windows 8.1.
An in-place upgrade to Windows 7 is similar to that of Windows 8.1, with these exceptions:
	 Check for compatibility. After inserting the Windows 7 DVD in the DVD drive, you then launch 
Windows 7 setup.exe just as you learned to do for Windows 8.1 setup. Respond to the Vista UAC box. 
If you have not yet performed the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor process, do so by clicking Check  
compatibility online in the opening menu shown in Figure 8-23. To proceed with the installation, 
click Install now.

Notes If you have an optical drive that can write to DVDs and you want to burn a DVD from an ISO file, insert a 
blank DVD in your optical drive and double-click the ISO file. Follow directions on screen and Windows does the rest.
Notes Best practice is to save the Windows setup files to a storage device or ISO image. You never know when you’ll 
need the files to repair a corrupted Windows installation.

	 Product key. Windows 8 setup asks for and requires you enter a product key early in the installation, 
but Windows 7 asks for the product key near the end of the installation (see Figure 8-24). You’re not 
required to enter the product key in this window and you can uncheck Automatically activate Windows 
when I’m online. You can enter the product key and activate Windows after the installation is finished. 
You have 30 days before you must activate Windows 7.
	 Network location. Windows 7 setup requires you select a network location (see Figure 8-25). Click the 
option that is appropriate to your network connection. You learned about these network locations in the 
chapter, “Survey of Windows Features and Support Tools.” If you choose Home network, you are given 
the opportunity to create a homegroup or enter the homegroup password to join an existing homegroup. 
Recall you can change these settings later using the Network and Sharing Center.

Steps to Perform a Windows 8.1 Clean Install
Recall that a clean install is the best option to use if the current installation is  
sluggish or giving problems, the currently installed OS does not allow for an  
in-place upgrade, or you’re installing Windows 8.1 on a new desktop computer  
you’re building.
If you have a Windows 7/Vista installation that qualifies for a Windows 8.1 upgrade and you need 
to do a clean install, begin by starting the installation from the Windows desktop as you would for an 
upgrade. When you get to the window shown earlier in Figure 8-17, click Nothing and continue with the 
installation. The volume holding the old Windows installation is formatted and everything on the volume is 
lost. If the hard drive has other volumes, these volumes are left unchanged.
A+  
220-902 
1.2, 1.6
Here are the steps to perform a clean install on a new hard drive using a product key purchased for a 
new installation of Windows 8.1:
1. Boot from the Windows setup DVD or USB flash drive. In the Windows Setup screen (see Figure 8-26), 
select the language and regional preferences and click Next. On the next screen, click Install now.
Figure 8-26  Decide on language and keyboard preferences
2. Enter your product key on the next screen. Setup verifies the key is a valid product key. Click Next.
3. Accept the license agreement on the next screen, and click Next. On the next screen (see Figure 8-27), 
click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced).

4. The Where do you want to install Windows? screen appears. Select the drive and volume where you want 
to install Windows. Figure 8-28 shows the screen that appears for a new hard drive that has not been 
partitioned. By default, setup will use the entire unallocated space for the Windows volume. If you want 
to use only a portion of the space, click New and enter the size of the volume. (Setup will also create a 
small reserved partition that it later uses for system files and the startup process.) Click Next to continue.

Steps to Perform a Windows 7 Clean Install
To perform a clean install of Windows 7, you can begin the installation from the Windows 7 
DVD or from the Windows desktop:
  If no operating system is installed on the PC, begin the installation by booting from the 
Windows 7 DVD. Using this method, the Upgrade option is not available and you are forced 
to do a Custom installation, also called a clean install.

Figure 8-31  Select language, time, and keyboard options
	 If an operating system is already installed on the PC, you can begin the installation from the Windows 
desktop or by booting from the Windows 7 DVD. Either way, you can perform a Custom installation. If you 
are using an upgrade license of Windows 7, setup will verify that a Windows OS is present, which qualifies 
you to use the upgrade license. This is the method to use when upgrading from Windows XP to Windows 7; 
you are required to perform a clean install even though setup verifies that Windows XP is present.
	 If you are installing a 64-bit OS when a 32-bit OS is already installed or vice versa, you must begin the 
installation by booting from the DVD. Setup still allows you to use the less-expensive upgrade license even 
though you are performing a clean install because it is able to verify a Windows installation is present.
Follow these steps to begin the installation by booting from the Windows 7 DVD:
1. Insert the Windows 7 DVD in the DVD drive and start the system, booting directly from the DVD. If you have 
trouble booting from the disk, go into UEFI/BIOS setup and verify that your first boot device is the optical 
drive. On the first screen (see Figure 8-31), select your language and regional preferences and click Next.
2. The opening menu shown in Figure 8-32 appears. Click Install now.

3. On the next screen, accept the license agreement. On the next screen, select the type of installation you 
want. Choose Custom (advanced).
4. On the next screen, select an existing partition on the hard drive to hold the installation or select unal-
located space for setup to use to create a partition.
5. The installation is now free to move forward. At the end of this process, the window in Figure 8-33 
appears asking for a local account username and computer name. The next screen asks for a password 
for the local account.
Figure 8-33  Choose a username and computer name
Steps to Set up a Windows Multiboot
You can install two or more operating systems on the same computer in a multiboot situation, 
for example, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, and Ubuntu Desktop. Each OS must have its own 
hard drive partition and each partition must have enough free space to hold the OS. Recall 
that Windows 8/7 needs at least 16 GB (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit) free space. Also know you 
cannot boot more than one OS at a time. To create a multiboot environment, always install Windows 
operating systems in order from older to newer.
A+  
220-902 
1.2, 1.6
Notes If an OS is already installed, you might need to shrink a partition to make room for a second partition to 
hold the next OS. For Windows, use Disk Management to shrink a partition, create a new partition, or format a partition. 
Windows requires the NTFS file system. How to use Disk Management is covered in the chapter, “Maintaining Windows.”
6. The installation now continues the same way as an upgrade installation. You are asked to enter the 
product key, Windows update settings, time and date settings, and network settings. Windows Update 
downloads and installs updates and you are asked to restart the system. After the restart, the logon screen 
appears. After you log in, the Windows 7 desktop loads and the installation is complete.

Here are the steps to set up a dual-boot system with two operating systems (using Windows 7 and 8.1 as 
examples):
1. Install Windows 7. If you plan to install Windows 8.1 on the same hard drive as Windows 7, leave 
some unallocated space for the Windows 8.1 partition. To do that, refer back to Figure 8-28. (This 
Windows setup screen works the same in Windows 7 as in Windows 8.1.) On this screen, click New. 
You can then specify how much of the total unallocated space you want to use for the Windows 7 
installation.
2. To install Windows 8.1, first make sure you have (a) a second partition with enough free space to hold 
the Windows 8.1 installation, (b) enough unallocated space on the drive to create a new partition while 
installing Windows 8.1, or (c) a second hard drive to hold the Windows 8.1 installation.
3. Start the Windows 8.1 installation by booting from the Windows 8.1 setup DVD or USB flash drive. The 
Windows Setup screen shown earlier in Figure 8-26 appears. Follow steps given earlier in this chapter to 
perform a clean install.
4. When you’re asked where to install Windows, select the partition or unallocated space to hold the 
­installation. For example, select Unallocated Space to hold the Windows 8.1 installation, as shown in 
­Figure 8-34. Don’t select the partition where the older operating system is already installed; doing so 
causes setup to install Windows 8.1 in place of the older OS. Continue on to complete the clean install.

Figure 8-34  Select unallocated space or a partition other than the one used by the first OS installation
After the installation, when you boot with a dual boot, the boot loader menu automatically appears and 
asks you to select an operating system, as shown in Figure 8-35.

Figure 8-35  Boot loader menu in a dual-boot environment
When using a dual boot, you can execute an application while one OS is loaded even if the application is 
installed under the other OS if each OS is using the same architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). If the application 
is not listed on the Windows 8.1 Start screen or the Windows 7 Start menu, locate the program file in File 
Explorer (Windows 8.1) or Windows Explorer (Windows 7/Vista). Double-click the application to run it.
Using an Upgrade Product Key on a New Hard Drive
Suppose an upgrade license for Windows 8.1, Windows 8.0, or Windows 7 has been used 
to install Windows on a computer and later the hard drive fails. You replace the hard drive 
with a new one and now you need to reinstall Windows. You’ll find lots of elegant and not 
so elegant shortcut solutions on the web, but here’s the official Microsoft answer, using the 
example where a Windows 7 system was upgraded to Windows 8.0 and then updated to Windows 8.1:
1. Reinstall Windows 7. You don’t need to enter the product key during the installation or activate 
Windows 7.
2. Reinstall Windows 8.0 using the upgrade product key and make sure Windows 8 is activated after the 
installation.
3. Download and install the free Windows 8.1 upgrade from the Windows Store.
In a situation where a Windows Vista system was upgraded to Windows 7, you can do the following  
so that you don’t have to install Vista:
1. Install Windows 7 using your upgrade media. Don’t enter the product key during the installation.
2. Reinstall Windows 7 as an upgrade. Windows setup should accept the upgrade product key during the 
installation and Windows should automatically activate.

Convert an MBR Drive to GPT
Suppose you want to use a 64-bit version of Windows and UEFI firmware mode, thus requiring you to use the GPT 
partitioning system. However, your hard drive has already been partitioned with the MBR system. The error won’t 
show up until you get to the step in the installation where you select the partition or unallocated space on the hard 
drive to hold the Windows installation (see Figure 8-36).

Install Windows
Follow the instructions in the chapter to install Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 as either an upgrade or clean install. 
Write down each decision you had to make as you performed the installation. If you get any error messages during 
the installation, write them down and list the steps you took to recover from the error. How long did the installation 
take? If you have a hypervisor (virtual machine software) installed on your computer, you can do this project 
in a VM.
Hands-On  Project 8-4
Install Windows 8.1 in a VM
Earlier in the chapter, in Hands-On Project 8-2, you installed VirtualBox on your computer and created a VM. Use 
this VM to install a 32-bit version of Windows 8.1. You can use this VM installation of Windows 8.1 in projects 
later in the text.
To start this virtual machine and install an OS in it, first make sure you have the correct ISO file available to the 
host computer. Windows is best installed in a VM by using an ISO image.
Click on the VM you created earlier, then click Start. VirtualBox asks for the location of the startup disk (see Figure 8-39). 
Select the correct location then click Start. The VM boots up, finds the ISO file, and starts the OS installation, as shown 
in Figure 8-40.

What to Do After a Windows Installation
After you have installed Windows, you need to do the following:
  Verify you have network access.
  Activate Windows.
  Install updates and service packs for Windows.
	 Verify automatic updates are set as you want them.
	 Install hardware.
	 Install applications, including anti-malware software.
	 Set up user accounts and transfer or restore from backup user data and preferences to the new system.
	 Turn Windows features on or off.

In addition, if you are installing Windows on a laptop, you will want to use Control Panel to configure 
power-management settings. If you are installing an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) version of 
Windows 7, look for a sticker on the outside of the DVD case. This sticker contains the product key and 
is called the Certificate of Authenticity. Put the sticker on the bottom of a laptop or the side or rear of a 
desktop computer (see Figure 8-41). Windows 8 doesn’t provide the sticker.
Caution
To protect your computer from malware, don’t surf the web for drivers or applications until you have 
installed Windows updates and service packs and also installed and configured anti-malware software.

Now let’s look at the details of the items in the preceding list.
Verify You Have Network Access
To make a wired connection to a network when using Windows, simply plug in the  
network cable and Windows does the rest. To create a wireless connection, follow  
the steps you learned in the chapter, “Survey of Windows Features and Support Tools.”
To verify you have access to the local network and to the Internet, do the following:
1. Open File Explorer or Windows Explorer and verify you can see other computers on the network 
(see Figure 8-42). Try to drill down to see shared resources on these computers.

Figure 8-42  Use File Explorer to access resources on your network
2. To verify you have Internet access, open Internet Explorer and try to navigate to a couple of websites.
If a problem arises, consider that the problem might be that you need to install the drivers for the 
motherboard, including the drivers for the onboard network port. Also, the IP address, wireless network, 
or network security settings might be wrong. How to configure network settings and troubleshoot network 
connections are covered later in the chapter, “Connecting To and Setting Up a Network.”

Installing Windows
Activate Windows
In order to make sure a valid Windows license has been purchased for each installation of Windows, 
Microsoft requires product activation. Windows 8.1 setup requires you enter a product key during 
the installation and, if the computer is connected to the Internet, Windows will automatically 
activate on the next restart after the installation completes. Recall from earlier in the chapter, you 
have more control over when to activate Windows 7. For Windows 7, you’re not required to enter the product key 
during installation, and you can activate Windows 7 any time within the 30-day grace period.
To view the activation status, go to the System window. Figure 8-43 shows the window for one system 
that is not activated. To activate, make sure you’re connected to the Internet and click Activate Windows. 
On the next screen, if necessary, you can enter a new product key and then activate Windows.

Install Windows Updates and Service Packs
The Microsoft website offers patches, fixes, and updates for known problems and has  
an extensive knowledge base documenting problems and their solutions. It’s important  
to keep these updates current on your system to fix known problems and plug up security 
holes that might allow malware in. Be sure to install updates before you attempt to install 
software or hardware.

Notes If you change the product key after Windows is activated, you must activate Windows again because the 
activation is tied to the product key and the system hardware. If you replace the motherboard or replace the hard drive 
and memory at the same time, you must also reactivate Windows.
If you use the same product key to install Windows on a different computer, a dialog box appears telling you of the 
suspected violation of the license agreement. You can call a Microsoft operator and explain what caused the discrepancy. 
If your explanation is reasonable (for example, you uninstalled Windows from one computer and installed it on another), 
the operator can issue you a valid certificate. You can then type the certificate value into a dialog box to complete the 
boot process.

Figure 8-44  View and manage Windows updates
If Windows 8.0 is installed, you can update it to Windows 8.1 for free. Open the Windows Store app on 
the Start screen, select the Windows 8.1 update, and follow directions on screen to download and install it.
OS Differences Recall that Windows 7 releases major updates as a service pack. On a Windows 7 system, if you 
see a service pack listed in the updates, install all the updates listed above it. Then install the service pack as the only 
update to install. It takes about 30 minutes and a reboot to download and install a service pack. Only the latest service 
pack for an OS will install because the latest service pack includes all the content from previous service packs.
To view and manage Windows update settings, open the System window and click Windows Update in 
the left pane (refer back to Figure 8-43). In the Windows Update window (see Figure 8-44), you can view 
updates and install them. Before you move on, make sure all important updates are installed. To check for 
new updates, click Check for updates in the left pane. Windows selects the updates in the order the system 
can receive them, and will not necessarily list all the updates you need on the first pass. Keep installing 
important updates and checking for more updates until no more updates are available. You might need to 
restart the system after certain updates are installed.
Configure Automatic Updates
Next, you need to make sure the update settings are as you want them. In the Windows Update window, 
click Change settings. In the Change settings window (see Figure 8-45), you can decide when and how 
updates are installed. The recommended setting is to allow Windows to automatically download and install 
updates daily. However, if you are not always connected to the Internet, your connection is very slow, or 
you want more control over which updates are installed, you might want to manage the updates differently. 
To change how and when updates are installed or to decide whether Windows can wake up your computer 
to perform updates, click Updates will be automatically installed during the maintenance window.
Update Windows
On a Windows 8.1 system connected to the Internet, open the System window and click Windows Update. Windows 
Update searches the Microsoft website and recommends Windows updates. Print the webpage showing a list of 
recommended updates. For a lab computer, don’t perform the updates unless you have your instructor’s permission.

Installing Windows
Figure 8-45  Manage how and when Windows is updated
Update Virus and Spyware Definitions
Windows 8 includes its own, preinstalled anti-malware software called Windows Defender. Although you 
might decide to install additional anti-malware software later, Windows Defender can provide adequate 
protection during the remainder of the setup process, and it’s free. To verify Windows Defender settings, 
go to the Start screen and open Windows Defender. (On the Start screen, start typing Defender, then click 
Windows Defender in the search results.) The Windows Defender window appears on the desktop. Click 
the Update tab, then click Update.
After Defender has updated, click the Settings tab, and if necessary click Real-time protection in the 
menu on the left. Make sure the Turn on real-time protection (recommended) check box is checked. If not, 
check the box and click Save changes.
OS Differences Windows 7 comes with Windows Defender installed, but Defender only protects against spyware and 
not other types of malware. To install anti-malware software in Windows 7, you can go to the Microsoft website and download 
and install Microsoft Security Essentials The link is windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download.
Install Hardware
You’re now ready to install the hardware devices that were not automatically installed 
during the Windows installation. As you install each device, reboot and verify the software 
or device is working before you move on to the next item. Most likely, you will need to do 
the following:
	 Install the drivers for the motherboard. If you were not able to connect to the network earlier in the 
installation process, it might be because the drivers for the network port on the motherboard are not 
installed. Installing the motherboard drivers can solve the problem. These drivers might come on a 
CD bundled with the motherboard, or you can use another computer to download them from the 
motherboard manufacturer’s website. To start the installation, double-click a setup program on the CD 
or a program that was previously downloaded from the web.
	 Even though Windows has embedded video drivers, install the drivers that came with the video card so 
that you can use all the features the card offers. These drivers are on disc or downloaded from the video 
card manufacturer’s website.

Figure 8-46  Windows 7 reports a problem with a driver for a USB printer
Immediately after this first window appeared, the window in Figure 8-47 appeared, which is provided  
by the Action Center. When the user clicked Click to download and install the new driver from the  
Hewlett-Packard Company website, the driver was immediately downloaded and installed with no errors.
	 Install the printer. For a network printer, run the setup program that came with the printer and this 
program will find and install the printer on the network. Alternately, open Control Panel in Classic view 
and open the Devices and Printers window. Then click Add a printer and follow the directions on screen. 
To install a local USB printer, all you have to do is plug in the USB printer, and Windows will install the 
printer automatically.
	 For other hardware devices, always read and follow the manufacturer’s directions for the installation. 
Sometimes you are directed to install the drivers before you connect the device, and sometimes you will 
first need to connect the device.
If a problem occurs while Windows is installing a device, it automatically launches the Action Center to 
help find a solution. For example, Figure 8-46 shows the error message window that appeared when a USB 
keyboard and USB printer were connected to a computer following a Windows 7 installation.

Installing Windows
Recall that you can also open the Action Center at any time to see a list of problems and solutions. If 
the problem is still not resolved after following the solutions offered by the Action Center, turn to Device 
Manager.
Use Device Manager
Device Manager (its program file is named devmgmt.msc) is your primary Windows tool for managing 
hardware. It lists all installed hardware devices and the drivers they use. Using Device Manager, you can 
disable or enable a device, update its drivers, uninstall a device, and undo a driver update (called a driver 
rollback).
To access Device Manager, use one of these methods:
	 Open the System window and click Device Manager.
	 For Windows 8, right-click Start, select Run, and type devmgmt.msc. For Windows 7, click Start and 
type Devmgmt.msc in the Search box. Then press Enter.
	 For Windows 8, right-click Start and select Device Manager.
A Device Manager window is shown in Figure 8-48.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know in what scenarios it is appropriate to use Device 
Manager. You also need to know how to use the utility and how to evaluate its results.
Click a white arrow to expand the view of an item, and click a black arrow to collapse the view. Here 
are ways to use Device Manager to solve problems with a device:
	 Try uninstalling and reinstalling the device. To uninstall the device, right-click the device and click 
Uninstall on the shortcut menu, as shown in Figure 8-48. (Alternately, you can click Properties in the 
shortcut menu to open the Properties box and then click Update Driver on the Driver tab.) Then reboot the 
system. Windows will recognize that the device is not installed and will attempt to install the appropriate 
driver. Look for issues during the installation that point to the source of the problem. Sometimes 
reinstalling a device is all that is needed to solve the problem. Notice in Figure 8-48 that the device selected 
is an HID-compliant mouse, which is connected through a USB port. (HID stands for human interface 
device.) Sometimes USB devices are listed in Device Manager and sometimes they are not.
	 Look for error messages offered by Device Manager. To find out more information about a device, 
right-click the device and select Properties on the shortcut menu. Figure 8-49 a shows the General tab 
of the Properties box for the onboard wireless network adapter. Many times, a message shows up in 
this box reporting the source of the problem and suggesting a solution.

	 Update the drivers. Click the Driver tab (see Figure 8-49b) to update the drivers and roll back (undo) a 
driver update.
Update Device Drivers
Follow these steps to use Device Manager to update device drivers:
1.	 For best results, locate and download the latest driver files from the manufacturer’s website to your  
hard drive. Be sure to use 64-bit drivers for a 64-bit OS and 32-bit drivers for a 32-bit OS. If possible,  
use Windows 8.1 drivers for Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 drivers for Windows 7.
2.	 Using Device Manager, right-click the device and select Properties from the shortcut menu. The Properties window 
for that device appears. Select the Driver tab and click Update Driver. The Update Driver Software box opens.
3.	 To search the Internet for drivers, click Search automatically for updated driver software. If you have 
already downloaded drivers to your PC, click Browse my computer for driver software, and point to the 
downloaded files. Note that Windows is looking for an .inf file to identify the drivers. Continue to follow the 
directions on screen to complete the installation.
APPLYING  CONCEPTS
Notes By default, Device Manager hides legacy devices that are not Plug and Play. To view installed legacy devices, 
click the View menu of Device Manager, and check Show hidden devices (see Figure 8-50).

Problems with Legacy Devices
Older hardware devices might present a problem. A Windows Vista driver is likely to work in the Windows 
7 installation because Windows 7 and Vista are so closely related, but it might not work in Windows 8. If 
the driver does not load correctly or gives errors, first search the web for a Windows 8 driver. If you don’t 
find one, try running the driver installation program in compatibility mode, which is explained next.

In the example that follows, the installation program for an older network printer worked under Windows 7 but did 
not load correctly on Windows 8.1. Follow these steps to use compatibility mode with the driver installation program:
1.	 Using File Explorer, locate the program file with an .exe file extension for the driver installation program. 
Right-click the program file and select Troubleshoot compatibility from the shortcut menu (see Figure 8-51).

Install Applications
Applications can be installed in Windows 8/7 from CD or DVD, from a downloaded 
application file, directly from the web, or, for Windows 8, from the Windows Store.
To install applications from a disc, insert the setup CD or DVD, and follow the directions 
on screen to launch the installation routine. For software downloaded from the Internet, open 
File Explorer or Windows Explorer and double-click the program filename to begin the installation. When 
installing a program directly from the web, click the link on the website to install the software and follow 
directions on screen. To install apps in the Windows 8 interface, use the Store app on the Start screen. 
(Later in the text, you’ll learn what to do when an installation fails.) After an application is installed, you 
might also need to install any updates available for the application on the manufacturer’s website.
If you need to uninstall an application, open Control Panel and click Programs and Features. (For Windows 
8, you can press Win+X and click Programs and Features.) The Programs and Features window appears, listing 
the programs installed on this computer where you can uninstall, change, or repair these programs. Select a 
program from the list. Based on the software, the buttons at the top of the list will change. For example, in 
Figure 8-56, the Camtasia Studio 8 software offers the option to Uninstall, Change, or Repair the software.

Recall that you can also uninstall a Windows 8 app by using the Start screen or Apps screen. Right-click 
the app tile and then click Uninstall in the status bar that appears at the bottom of the screen.
Set up User Accounts and Transfer User Data
Remember that you can use the Windows 8 Settings charm or the Windows 7 User Accounts 
applet in Control Panel to create user accounts. In addition, you can use the Computer 
Management console in Windows 8/7 to create accounts. After you have created user accounts 
in a new installation of Windows, you might want to transfer user data and settings from 
another computer to this one.
For individuals or small organizations, use Windows Easy Transfer in Windows 8/7/Vista to copy user 
data and settings from one computer to another. The utility is easy to use and you can find directions in 
Windows Help and Support. For large corporations that use a Windows domain, a more advanced tool is 
required, the User State Migration Tool (USMT). This tool is discussed later in this chapter.

Turn Windows Features on or Off
You can save on system resources by turning off Windows 8/7 features you will not use, and 
you might need to turn on some features that are, by default, turned off. To control Windows 
features, in the left pane of the Programs and Features window, click Turn Windows features 
on or off (refer to Figure 8-56). The Windows Features box opens (see Figure 8-57). Check or 
uncheck the features you want or don’t want and then click OK. Sometimes a restart is necessary for the 
changes to take effect.

The Windows installation, devices, applications, and user accounts should now be good to go. Restart 
the computer and make one last check that all is well. Now would be a good time to complete your 
documentation and make a backup of the entire Windows volume in the event of a hard drive failure or 
corrupted installation. How to make backups is covered in the chapter, “Maintaining Windows.”
Create a Documentation Form
Create a document that technicians can use when installing Windows and performing all the chores mentioned in 
the chapter that need doing before and after the installation. The document needs a checklist of what to do before 
the installation and a checklist of what to do after the installation. It also needs a place to record decisions made 
during the installation, the applications and hardware devices installed, user accounts created, and any other  
important information that might be useful for future maintenance or troubleshooting. Don’t forget to include a way 
to identify the computer, the name of the technician doing the work, and when the work was done.

Special Concerns When Working in a Large Enterprise
Working as an IT support technician in a large corporate environment is different from  
working as an IT support technician for a small company or with individuals. In this part of

Deployment Strategies for Windows
Earlier in the chapter, you learned how to install Windows using a setup DVD, USB flash drive, 
or files downloaded from the Microsoft website. You perform the installation while sitting at 
the computer, responding to each query made by the setup program. Then you must configure 
Windows and install device drivers and applications. If, however, you were responsible for 
installing Windows on several hundred computers in a large corporation, you might want a less time-consuming 
method to perform the installations. These methods are called deployment strategies. A deployment strategy is 
a procedure to install Windows, device drivers, and applications on a computer and can include the process to 
transfer user settings, application settings, and user data files from an old installation to the new installation.
Microsoft suggests four deployment strategies; the one chosen depends on the number of computers to be 
deployed and determines the amount of time you must sit in front of an individual computer as Windows is 
installed (this time is called the touch time). As an IT support technician in a large corporation, most likely 
you would not be involved in choosing or setting up the deployment strategy. But you need to be aware of 
the different strategies so that you have a general idea of what will be expected of you when you are asked 
to provide desk-side or help-desk support as Windows is being deployed in your organization.
The four deployment strategies are discussed next.
High-Touch with Retail Media (Recommended for Fewer  
than 100 Computers)
The high-touch with retail media strategy is the strategy used in the installations described earlier in 
the chapter. All the work is done by a technician sitting at the computer. To save time doing multiple 
installations, you can copy the Windows setup files to a file server on the network and share the folder. 
Then at each computer, you can execute the setup program on the server to perform a clean install 
or upgrade of the OS. A server used in this way is called a distribution server. Except for upgrade 
installations, applications must be manually installed after the OS is installed.
To transfer user settings, application settings, and user data files to a new installation (a process called 
migrating), you can use Windows Easy Transfer (a manual process that is easy to use) or the User State 
Migration Tool (more automated and more difficult to set up and use). Windows Easy Transfer is part 
of Windows 8/7/Vista. The User State Migration Tool (USMT) is a command-line tool that works only 
when the computer is a member of a Windows domain. USMT is included in the Windows Assessment 
and Deployment Kit (ADK) for Windows 8, and in the Windows Automated Installation Kit (AIK) for 
Windows 7. Both can be downloaded from the Microsoft website, and both contain a group of tools used 
to deploy Windows in a large organization.
High-Touch with Standard Image (Recommended for 100  
to 200 Computers)
To use the high-touch using a standard image strategy, a system administrator prepares an image called 
a standard image that includes the Windows OS, drivers, and applications that are standard to all the 
computers that might use the image. A standard image is hardware independent, meaning it can be installed 
on any computer. (In the chapter “Maintaining Windows,” you learn to create other types of images that 
can only be used on the computer that created them.)
Drive-imaging software is used to copy the entire hard drive to another bootable media in the process 
called drive imaging. Tools included in the Windows ADK or AIK or third-party software can be used. 
Examples of third-party drive-imaging software are True Image by Acronis (www.acronis.com), Ghost by 
Symantec (www.symantec.com), and Todo Backup Free, a freeware version of the Todo Backup software 
by EaseUS (www.easeus.com). A standard image is usually stored on an 8-GB or larger bootable USB flash 
drive (UFD) or on a bootable DVD along with Windows setup files.

Installing Windows
Installing a standard image on another computer is called image deployment, which always results in a 
clean install rather than an upgrade. To begin, boot the computer from the bootable flash drive or DVD 
that contains the image. A menu appears to begin the Windows installation. When you finish this Windows 
installation, the standard image is installed. USMT can then be used to transfer user settings, user data files, 
and application settings to the new installation.
The high-touch using a standard image strategy takes longer to set up than the previous strategy because 
a system administrator must prepare the image and must set up USMT, but it takes less time to install on 
each computer and also assures the administrator that each computer has a standard set of drivers and 
applications that are configured correctly.
Lite-Touch, High-Volume Deployment (Recommended for 200  
to 500 Computers)
The lite-touch, high-volume deployment strategy uses a deployment server on the network to serve up 
the installation after a technician starts the process. The files in the installation include Windows, device 
drivers, and applications, and collectively are called the distribution share.
The technician starts the installation by booting the computer to Windows PE. Windows Preinstallation 
Environment (Windows PE) is a minimum operating system used to start the installation. It is included in 
the Windows ADK for Windows 8 or in the Windows AIK for Windows 7, and it can be installed on a USB 
flash drive, CD, or DVD to make the device bootable. The technician boots from the device, which might 
be configured to display a menu to choose from multiple distribution shares available on the deployment 
server.
The technician can also boot the computer directly to the network to receive Windows PE from the 
deployment server. For a legacy BIOS system, set the first item in the boot device priority to be Ethernet 
(see Figure 8-58). For a UEFI system, look for an advanced setup screen in UEFI setup to enable PXE 
Support. Then reboot the system. The computer boots to the Preboot eXecution Environment or 
­Pre-Execution Environment (PXE) that is contained in the UEFI or BIOS code on the motherboard. PXE 
searches for a server on the network to provide a bootable operating system (Windows PE on the  
deployment server).

Special Concerns When Working in a Large Enterprise
8
After the installation begins, the technician is not required to respond to prompts by the setup program, 
which is called an unattended installation. These responses, such as the administrator password or domain 
name, are stored in an answer file. The User State Migration Tool is then used to transfer user settings, user 
data files, and application settings to the new installation.
For high-touch strategies, a technician would normally sit at a computer and use the Windows 8 
Upgrade Assistant or the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor to determine if the system qualifies for the upgrade 
before performing the installation. Using lite-touch deployments, a more automated method of qualifying 
a computer is preferred. The Microsoft Assessment and Planning (MAP) Toolkit can be used by a system 
administrator from a network location to query hundreds of computers in a single scan. The software 
automatically examines hardware and applications on each computer to verify compatibility with Windows 
7 or 8. The MAP software might also be used by the system administrator before deciding to deploy a new 
OS to determine what computer hardware upgrades or application software upgrades are required that 
must be included in the overall deployment budget.
Zero-Touch, High-Volume Deployment (Recommended for More  
than 500 Computers)
The zero-touch, high-volume deployment strategy is the most difficult to set up and requires complex 
tools. The installation does not require a technician to start the process (called pull automation). Rather, 
the installation uses push automation, meaning that a server automatically pushes the installation to a 
computer when a user is not likely to be sitting at it. The entire remote network installation is automated 
and no user intervention is required. The process can turn on a computer that is turned off and even works 
when no OS is installed on the computer or the current OS is corrupted.
Using the USMT Software
Let’s look briefly at what to expect when using the USMT software, which is included in 
the Windows 8 ADK software and the Windows 7 AIK software. To prepare to use USMT, 
a system administrator must first install the ADK or AIK software on his or her computer. 
In Microsoft documentation, this computer is called the technician computer. The source 
computer is the computer from which the user settings, application settings, and user data files are taken. 
The destination computer is the computer that is to receive this data. Sometimes the source computer and 
the destination computer are the same computer. An example is when you perform a clean installation of 
Windows 8/7 on a computer that has an earlier version of Windows installed and you want to transfer user 
files and settings from the older installation to the new installation.

Notes IT support technicians find that large enterprises appreciate quick-and-easy solutions to desktop or laptop 
computer problems. Technicians quickly learn their marching orders are almost always “replace or reimage.” Little time 
is given to trying to solve the underlying problem when hardware can quickly be replaced or a Windows installation can 
quickly be reimaged.
Notes USMT uses hard-link migration of user files and settings when the source computer and the destination 
computer are the same computer. Hard-link migration does not actually copy files and settings, but leaves them on the 
hard drive without copying. This method makes USMT extremely fast when the hard drive is not formatted during the 
Windows installation.

376
Installing Windows
Here are the general steps to use USMT:
1. Download and install the ADK or AIK software on the technician computer.
2. Copy the USMT program files from the technician computer to the source computer.
3. Run the scanstate command on the source computer to copy user files and settings to a file server or 
other safe location.
4. Install Windows, device drivers, and applications on the destination computer.
5. Run the loadstate command to apply user files and settings from the file server to the destination computer.
The USMT software uses three commands:
	 scanstate copies settings and files from the source computer to a safe location.
	 loadstate applies these settings and files to the destination computer.
	 usmtutils provides encryption options and hard-link management.
The scanstate, loadstate, and usmtutils command lines can be lengthy and include references to .xml files 
in the command line along with other parameters. The details of these command lines are not covered in 
this text. Most likely, the commands are stored in batch files provided by the system administrator. A batch 
file has a .bat file extension and contains a list or batch of OS commands that are executed as a group. 
These batch files might be automatically executed as part of a zero-touch installation or manually executed 
in a lite-touch or high-touch installation. To manually execute a batch file, you type the name of the batch 
file at a command prompt.
Notes For detailed instructions on using USMT that a system administrator might use, go to technet.microsoft.com

>> Chapter Summary
How to Plan a Windows Installation
	Editions of Windows 8 are Windows 8, Windows 8 Professional, Windows 8 Enterprise, and Windows 
RT. All editions come in 32- or 64-bit versions.
	The Windows 7 editions are Windows 7 Starter, Windows 7 Home Basic, Windows 7 Home Premium, 
Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Enterprise, and Windows 7 Ultimate.
	Windows can be purchased as the less-expensive OEM version or the more-expensive retail version. The 
OEM version can only be installed on a new computer.
	Each edition of Windows 8 and Windows 7 (except Windows 7 Starter) is available in either 32- or 64-bit 
versions. A 32-bit OS cannot address as much memory as a 64-bit OS. A 64-bit OS performs better and 
requires more memory than a 32-bit OS.
	Before purchasing Windows, make sure your system meets the minimum hardware requirements and all 
the hardware and applications will work under the OS. A 64-bit OS requires 64-bit drivers.

Key Terms
	A computer might have legacy BIOS installed on the motherboard or have the newer UEFI firmware 
installed. Most UEFI firmware offers the option to support legacy BIOS when in UEFI CSM mode.
	A hard drive contains one or more partitions or volumes and can use the MBR or GPT partitioning system.  
To use UEFI Secure Boot, the partitioning system must be GPT and the Windows installation must be 64 bit.
	Normally, Windows is installed on the C: volume in the C:\Windows folder. The volume in which 
Windows is installed must use the NTFS file system.
	Windows can be installed from the setup DVD, USB flash drive, files downloaded from the Internet, hid-
den partition on the hard drive (called a factory recovery partition), or in a virtual machine.
	Virtual machine software can provide multiple instances of operating systems for training users, running 
legacy software, and supporting multiple operating systems.
	Windows can be installed as an in-place upgrade, a clean installation, or in a multiboot environment 
with another OS.
Installing Windows 8.1 and Windows 7
	A technician needs to know how to perform an in-place upgrade, a clean install, or a multiboot with 
Windows.
	The steps for installing or upgrading Windows 8.0 are about the same as those for Windows 8.1.
	A clean install is the best option to use if the current installation is sluggish or giving problems, or if 
you’re installing Windows on a new desktop computer that you’re building.
	In a multiboot, each OS must be installed on its own partition. Make sure you have enough free space 
on a partition before installing Windows onto it, and make sure it doesn’t currently hold an OS.
What to Do After a Windows Installation
	After a Windows installation, verify you have network access, activate Windows, install any Windows 
updates or Windows 7 service packs, verify automatic updates are configured correctly, install hardware 
and applications, create user accounts and transfer or restore from backup user data and preferences, 
and turn Windows features on or off.
Special Concerns When Working in a Large Enterprise
	Four deployment strategies for installing Windows in a large enterprise are high-touch with retail media, 
high-touch with a standard image, lite-touch with high volume, and zero-touch with high volume. Which 
strategy to use depends on the number of computers to deploy. Zero-touch deployments require the most 
time to set up, but do not require a technician to be at the computer when the installation happens.

Real Problem 8-1 Recovering Data from a Corrupted Windows Installation
As an IT support technician for a small organization, it’s your job to support the computers, the 
small network, and the users. One of your coworkers, Jason, comes to you in a panic. His Windows 
8.1 system won’t boot, and he has lots of important data files in several locations on the drive. He 
has no idea in which folder some of the files are located. Besides the application data he’s currently 
working on, he’s especially concerned about losing email addresses, email, and his Internet Explorer 
Favorites links.
After trying everything you know about recovering Windows 8.1, you conclude the OS is 
corrupted beyond repair. You decide there might be a way to remove the hard drive from Jason’s 
computer and connect it to another computer so that you can recover the data. Search the Internet 
and find a device that you can use to connect Jason’s hard drive to another computer using a USB 
port on that computer. The hard drive uses a SATA hard drive interface. Print the webpage showing 
the device and its price.

Supporting I/O Devices
T
his chapter is packed full of details about the many I/O (input/
output) devices an IT support technician must be familiar with and 
must know how to install and support. Most of us learn about new 
technologies as we need to use a device or when a client or customer 
requests our help with purchasing decisions or solving a problem 
with a device. Good technicians soon develop the skills of searching 
the web for explanations, reviews, and ads about a device and can 
quickly turn to support websites for how to install, configure, or trou-
bleshoot a device. This chapter can serve as your jump start toward 
learning about many computer parts and devices used to enhance 
a system. It contains enough information to get you started toward 
becoming an expert at computer devices.
We begin with the basic skills common to supporting any device, 
including how to use Device Manager and how to select the right port 
for a new peripheral device. Then you learn to install I/O devices and 
adapter cards and to support the video subsystem. Finally, you learn 
how to troubleshoot problems with I/O devices.

384
Supporting I/O Devices
Basic Principles for Supporting Devices
An I/O or storage device can be either internal (installed inside the computer case) or external 
(installed outside the case and called a peripheral device). These basic principles apply to sup-
porting both internal and external devices:
	Every device is controlled by software. When you install a new device, such as a barcode reader or 
scanner, you must install both the device and the device drivers to control the device. These device 
drivers must be written for the OS you are using. Recall from earlier chapters that the exceptions to this 
principle are some simple devices, such as the keyboard, which are controlled by the system UEFI/BIOS. 
Also, Windows has embedded device drivers for many devices. For example, when you install a video 
card, Windows can use its embedded drivers to communicate with the card, but to use all the features of 
the card, you can install the drivers that came bundled with the card.
	When it comes to installing or supporting a device, the manufacturer knows best. In this chapter, you learn a 
lot of principles and procedures for installing and supporting a device, but when you’re on the job installing 
a device or fixing a broken one, read the manufacturer’s documentation and follow those guidelines first. For 
example, for most installations, you install the device before you install the device driver. However, for some 
devices, such as a digital camera and a wireless keyboard, you might need to install the device driver first. 
Check the device documentation to know which to do first.
	Some devices need application software to use the device. For example, after you install a scanner and 
its device drivers, you might also need to install Adobe Photoshop to use the scanner.
	A device is no faster than the port or slot it is designed to use. When buying a new external device, pay 
attention to the type of port for which it is rated. For example, an external hard drive designed to use a 
USB 2.0 port will work using a USB 3.0 port, but will work at the USB 2.0 speed even when it’s 
connected to a faster USB 3.0 port. For another example, a TV tuner card in a PCI slot will not work as

	Use an administrator account in Windows. When installing hardware devices under Windows, you need 
to be signed in to the system with a user account that has the highest level of privileges to change the 
system. This type of account is called an administrator account.
	Problems with a device can sometimes be solved by updating the device drivers. Device manufacturers 
often release updates to device drivers. Update the drivers to solve problems with the device or to add 
new features. You can use Device Manager in Windows to manage devices and their drivers.
	Install only one device at a time. If you have several devices to install, install one and restart the system. 
Make sure that device is working and all is well with the system before you move on to install another 
device.
Recall that Device Manager (its program file is named devmgmt.msc) is your primary Windows tool for 
managing hardware. It lists almost all installed hardware devices and the drivers they use. (Printers and 
many USB devices are not listed in Device Manager.) Using Device Manager, you can disable or enable a 
device, update its drivers, uninstall a device, and undo a driver update (called a driver rollback).
Before we move on to installing devices, you need to be familiar with the ports on a computer. When selecting 
a new device, to get the best performance, select one that uses the fastest port available on your computer.
Ports and Wireless Connections Used by Peripheral Devices
Many ports used by peripheral or external devices are pictured in Table 1 in the chapter, “First 
Look at Computer Parts and Tools.” When deciding what type of port a new device should use, 
the speed of the port is often a tiebreaker. Table 9-1 shows the speeds of various ports, from 
fastest to slowest. Because wireless connections are sometimes an option, they are also included 
in the table for comparison. For example, you might need to decide between a USB 2.0 printer connection 
and a Bluetooth wireless connection. This table can help you decide if speed should be a consideration.

2. As many as 127 USB devices can be daisy-chained together using USB cables. In a daisy chain, one 
device provides a USB port for the next device.
3. USB uses serial transmissions, and USB devices are hot-swappable, meaning that you can plug or unplug 
one without first powering down the system.
4. A USB cable has four wires, two for power and two for communication. The two power wires (one is 
hot and the other is ground) allow the host controller to provide power to a device. Table 9-2 shows 
the different USB connectors on USB cables.
Notes Sometimes a mouse that uses USB 2.0 gives problems when plugged into a USB 3.0 port. If a mouse refuses 
to work or is unstable, try moving it to a USB 2.0 port.

FireWire (IEEE 1394) Connections
USB and FireWire competed as a solution for fast I/O connections for a few years, but USB clearly won 
that contest, and now FireWire is hardly used in new devices. FireWire standards are managed by the 1394 
Trade Association (www.1394ta.org). The official name of these standards is IEEE 1394, and other names 
used are FireWire (first used by Apple) and i.LINK (first used by Sony). The most common name used 
today is FireWire. Here are the key facts you need to know about FireWire:
	 FireWire uses serial transmissions, and FireWire devices are hot-swappable.
	 FireWire 800 (1394b) allows for up to 63 FireWire devices to be daisy-chained together. FireWire 400 
(1394a) allows for up to 16 daisy-chained devices.
	 FireWire 400 (1394a) supports two types of connectors and cables: a 4-pin connector that does not 
provide voltage to a device and a 6-pin connector that does. Figure 9-2 shows a cable that plugs into a 
6-pin FireWire port to provide a 4-pin connector for a FireWire device.
	 FireWire 800 (1394b) uses a 9-pin rectangular connector. Figure 9-3 shows a FireWire 800 adapter 
card that provides three 1394 ports: two 1394b 9-pin ports and one 1394a 6-pin port. The power cable 
connected to the card plugs into a 4-pin Molex power cable from the power supply to provide extra 
power to the card. The latest 1394 standard is 1394c, which allows FireWire 800 to use a standard 
network port and network cable.
Figure 9-2  IEEE 1394a cable provides a smaller 4-pin and larger 6-pin  
connectors
Notes A USB 3.0 A-Male connector or port has additional pins compared with USB 1.1 or 2.0 ports and connectors but 
still is backward compatible with USB 1.1 and 2.0 devices. A USB 3.0 A-Male or B-Male connector or port is usually blue. 
Take a close look at the blue and black USB ports shown in Figure 4 in the chapter “First Look at Computer Parts and Tools.”
Notes IEEE 1394a ports with six pins are the most common FireWire ports on motherboards.

Infrared Connections
Infrared (IR) is an outdated wireless technology 
to connect personal devices that has been mostly 
replaced by Bluetooth. IR requires an unobstructed 
“line of sight” between the transmitter and receiver. 
Today, the most common use of Infrared is by remote 
controls. Figure 9-4 shows a remote control that can 
be used with multimedia applications installed on a 
laptop computer. The remote communicates with the 
laptop by way of an IR transceiver connected to a 
USB port. To use the remote, the device drivers that 
came bundled with the device are installed and then 
the IR transceiver is connected to the USB port.

Installing I/O Peripheral Devices
9
Installing I/O Peripheral Devices
Installing peripheral or external devices is easy to do and usually goes without a hitch. All 
devices need device drivers or UEFI/BIOS to control them and to interface with the operating 
system. Simple input devices, such as the mouse and keyboard, can be controlled by the UEFI/
BIOS or have embedded device drivers built in to the OS. For these devices, you usually don’t 
have to install additional device drivers.
Peripheral devices you might be called on to install include a keyboard, mouse, touch pad, barcode reader, 
biometric device (for example, a fingerprint reader), touch screen, motion controller, scanner, microphone, 
game pad, joystick, digitizer, digital camera, smart card reader, webcam, camcorder, MIDI-enabled devices, 
speakers, and display devices. These installations are similar, so learning to do one will help you do another. 
Here are the general procedures to install any peripheral device:
1. Read the manufacturer’s directions. I know you don’t want to hear that again, but when you follow 
these directions, the installation goes better. If you later have a problem with the installation and you 
ask the manufacturer for help, being able to say you followed the directions exactly as stated goes a 
long way toward getting more enthusiastic help and cooperation.
2. Make sure the drivers provided with the device are written for the operating system (OS) you are using. 
Recall that 64-bit drivers are required for a 64-bit operating system, and 32-bit drivers are required 
for a 32-bit OS. You can sometimes use drivers written for older Windows versions in newer Windows 
versions, but for best results, use drivers written for the OS installed. You can download the drivers you 
need from the manufacturer’s website.
3. Make sure the motherboard port you are using is enabled. Most likely it is enabled, but if the device 
is not recognized when you plug it in, go into UEFI/BIOS setup and make sure the port is enabled. In 
addition, UEFI/BIOS setup might offer the option to configure a USB port to use SuperSpeed (USB 3.0), 
Hi-Speed USB (USB 2.0), or original USB (USB 1.1). Figure 9-5 shows the BIOS setup screen for one 
system where you can enable or disable onboard devices. In addition, if you are having problems with 
a motherboard port, don’t forget to update the motherboard drivers that control the port.

Supporting I/O Devices
4. Install drivers or plug in the device. Some devices, such as a USB printer, require that you plug in the 
device before installing the drivers, and some devices require you to install the drivers before plugging 
in the device. For some devices, it doesn’t matter which is installed first. Carefully read and follow the 
device documentation. For example, the documentation for one digital camera says that if you install the 
camera before installing the driver, the drivers will not install properly.
 
If you plug in the device first, Device Setup launches and steps you through the installation of drivers 
(see Figure 9-6). As Device Setup works, an icon appears in the taskbar. To see the Device Setup box, as 
shown in the figure, click the icon.
Figure 9-6  Device Setup begins installing a new device
Mouse or Keyboard
Plug a mouse or keyboard into a USB port and Windows should immediately recognize it and 
install generic drivers. Because PS/2 ports are not hot-pluggable, you must restart Windows after 
plugging a mouse or keyboard into a PS/2 port. For keyboards with special features such as the 
one shown in Figure 9-7, you need to install the drivers that came with the keyboard before 
you can use these features. Also notice in Figure 9-7 a green USB to PS/2 adapter and a purple PS/2 to USB 
adapter, which can solve the problem when a case has PS/2 ports and doesn’t have enough USB ports.
A+  
220-901

If you need to install the drivers first, run the setup program on CD or DVD. If you downloaded drivers 
from the web, double-click the driver file and follow the directions on screen. It might be necessary to 
restart the system after the installation. After the drivers are installed, plug the device into the port. The 
device should immediately be recognized by Windows. If you have problems using the device, turn to 
Device Manager for help.
5. Install the application software to use the device. For example, a FireWire camcorder is likely to come 
bundled with video-editing software. Run the software to use the device.
Now let’s look at some key features and installation concerns for several peripheral devices.

You can later use Device Manager to uninstall, disable, or enable most devices. However, USB devices 
are managed differently. To uninstall a USB device such as the USB keyboard shown in Figure 9-7, use the 
Programs and Features window. To open the window in Windows 8, press Win+X and click Programs and 
Features. For Windows 7, click Start, click Control Panel, and click Programs and Features. In the Programs 
and Features window (see Figure 9-8), select the device and click Uninstall. Follow the directions on screen 
to uninstall the device.

4. Bring the keyboard out of the case and forward to expose the keyboard ribbon cable attached under-
neath the board. Use a screwdriver to lift the cable connector up and out of its socket (see Figure 9-11).
Replacing the Keyboard and Touch pad in a Laptop
Replacing the keyboard is pretty easy to do. Before you begin any disassembly of a laptop, refer to the 
manufacturer documentation. Here are typical steps that are similar to many models of laptops:
1. Power down the laptop and remove the AC adapter and the battery pack.
2. Remove two or more screws on the bottom of the laptop (see Figure 9-9). (Only the manufacturer 
documentation can tell you which ones because there are probably several of them used to hold various 
components in place.)
Figure 9-9  Remove screws on the bottom of the laptop
Figure 9-10  Pry up and lift the keyboard out of the laptop case
3. Turn the laptop over and open the lid. Gently push the keyboard toward the lid while pulling it up to 
release it from the case (see Figure 9-10).
Notes The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to use Control Panel in Classic view, which presents a list of individual 
items. If Control Panel is in Category view, which presents items in groups, to get Classic view, click Category and then 
click Small icons or Large icons.

5. Replace the keyboard following the steps in reverse order.
Sometimes the touch pad and keyboard are one complete field replaceable unit (FRU). If the touch pad is 
a separate component, it might be part of the keyboard bezel, also called the palm rest. This bezel is the flat 
cover that surrounds the keyboard. Most likely you have to remove the keyboard before you can remove 
the keyboard bezel.
Barcode Readers
A barcode reader is used to scan barcodes on products at the point of sale (POS) or when 
taking inventory. The reader might use a wireless connection, a serial port, a USB port, or 
a keyboard port. If the reader uses a keyboard port, most likely it has a splitter (called a 
keyboard wedge) on it for the keyboard to use, and data read by the barcode reader is input 
into the system as though it were typed using the keyboard. Figure 9-12 shows a barcode reader by 
Intermec that is a laser scanner and uses Bluetooth to connect wirelessly to the computer.

Biometric Devices
A biometric device is an input device that inputs biological data about a person, used to identify 
a person’s fingerprint, handprint, face, voice, eye, or handwritten signature. For example, you can 
use a fingerprint reader to sign in to Windows or to access an iPhone using Touch ID technology. 
These fingerprint readers should not be considered the only authentication to control access to 
sensitive data: for that, use a strong password, which is a password that is not easy to guess.

Fingerprint readers can look like a mouse and use a wireless or USB connection, such as the one shown 
in Figure 9-13, or they can be embedded on a keyboard, flash drive, or laptop case. For mobile devices, the 
fingerprint reader can be activated by pressing a button or touch screen. Most fingerprint readers that are 
not embedded in other devices use a USB connection. As with other USB devices, read the documentation 
to know if you should install the drivers first or the device first.
Digital Cameras and Camcorders
A digital camera or camcorder can hold images and videos both in embedded memory that 
cannot be removed or exchanged and in removable flash memory cards. Both of these types of 
memory retain data without a battery. Here are two ways to transfer images from your camera 
or camcorder to a computer:
	 Connect the camera or camcorder to the computer using a cable. Using embedded memory or flash 
memory cards, you can connect the device to your computer using a USB or FireWire port and cable. 
To connect the device to the computer, you might need to first install the software and then connect the 
device, or you might need to connect the device and then install the software. Read the camera or cam-
corder documentation to find out which order to use. After the device and software are installed, the 
software displays a menu to download images or video to your computer.
	 Install the memory card in the computer. If images or video are stored on a flash memory card installed 
in your device, you can remove the card and then insert it in a flash memory card slot on your computer. 
Most laptop computers have one or more of these slots (see Figure 9-14).

Webcams
A webcam (web camera) is embedded in most laptops and can also be installed as a peripheral 
device using a USB port or some other port. For example, the webcam shown in Figure 9-17 
works well for personal chat sessions and videoconferencing and has a built-in microphone. 
First, use the setup CD to install the software and then plug in the webcam to a USB port.
A webcam comes with a built-in microphone. You 
can use this microphone or use the microphone port 
on the computer. Most software allows you to select 
these input devices. For example, Figure 9-18 shows

Graphics Tablets
Another input device is a graphics tablet, also called a digitizing tablet or digitizer, that is used 
to hand draw and is likely to connect by a USB port (see Figure 9-19). It comes with a stylus 
that works like a pencil on the tablet. The graphics tablet and stylus can be a replacement to 
a mouse or touch pad on a laptop, and some graphics tablets come with a mouse. Graphics 
tablets are popular with graphic artists and others who use desktop publishing applications.

MIDI Devices
MIDI (musical instrument digital interface), pronounced “middy,” is a set of standards 
that are used to represent music in digital form. Using the MIDI format, each individual 
note played by each individual instrument is digitally stored. MIDI standards are used to 
connect electronic music equipment, such as musical keyboards and mixers, or to connect 
this equipment to a computer for input, output, and editing. Most sound cards can play MIDI files, 
and most electronic instruments have MIDI ports.
A MIDI port is a 5-pin DIN port that looks like a PS/2 keyboard port, only larger. Figure 9-21 
shows MIDI ports on electronic drums. A MIDI port is either an input port or an output port, but not 
both. Normally, you would connect the MIDI output port to a mixer, but you can also use it to connect 
to a computer.

Here are ways to connect a musical instrument to a computer using the MIDI standards:
	 MIDI to MIDI. A few sound cards provide MIDI ports. Use two MIDI cables to connect output jack to 
input jack and to connect input jack to output jack.
	 MIDI to USB. If your computer does not have MIDI ports, you can use a MIDI-to-USB cable like the 
one shown in Figure 9-22. The two MIDI connectors on the cable are for input and output.

To mix and edit music using MIDI on your computer, you’ll need MIDI editing software such as 
JAMMER Pro by SoundTrek (www.soundtrek.com). Before connecting the instrument to your computer, 
install the software that you intend to use to manage the music. Then, connect the instrument.
Touch Screens
A touch screen is an input device that uses a monitor or LCD panel as the backdrop for input 
options. In other words, the touch screen is a grid that senses taps, finger pinches, and slides 
and sends these events to the computer by way of a USB port or other type of connection. 
Some laptops have built-in touch screens, and you can also install a touch screen on top of 
a monitor screen as an add-on device. As an add-on device, the touch screen has its own AC adapter to 
power it. Some monitors for desktop systems have built-in touch screen capability.
For add-on desktop monitors, clamp the touch screen over the monitor. For most installations, you 
install the drivers before you connect the touch screen to the computer by way of a USB port. After you 
install the drivers and the touch screen, you must use management software that came bundled with the 
device to decide how much of the monitor screen is taken up by the touch screen and to calibrate the touch 
screen. Later, if the monitor resolution is changed, the touch screen must be recalibrated.
KVM Switches
A KVM (Keyboard, Video, and Mouse) switch allows you to use one keyboard, monitor, and 
mouse for multiple computers. A KVM switch can be useful in a server room or testing lab where 
you use more than one computer and want to keep desk space clear of multiple keyboards, mice, 
and monitors or you simply want to lower the cost of peripherals. Figure 9-23 shows a KVM 
switch that can connect a keyboard, monitor, mouse, microphone, and speakers to two computers. The device 
uses USB ports for the keyboard and mouse.

computer to the device. Also plug in one set of a monitor, mouse, keyboard, and possibly a microphone 
and speakers to the device. Switch between computers by using a hot key on the keyboard, buttons on the 
top of the KVM switch, or a wired remote such as the one shown in Figure 9-23.

Installing and Configuring Adapter Cards
In this part of the chapter, you learn to install and configure adapter cards. These cards 
include a video card, sound card, storage controller card, serial and parallel port card, 
Thunderbolt card, FireWire card, USB card, storage card, TV tuner card, and video capture 
card. The purpose of adding an adapter card to a system is to have available the external 
ports or internal connectors the card provides.
Regardless of the type of card you are installing, when preparing to install an adapter card, be sure to 
verify and do the following:
	 Verify the card fits an empty expansion slot. Recall that there are several PCI and PCI Express stand-
ards; therefore, make sure the card will fit the slot. To help with airflow, try to leave an empty slot 
between cards. Especially try to leave an empty slot beside the video card, which puts off a lot of heat.
	 Verify the device drivers for your OS are available. Check the card documentation and make sure you 
have the drivers for your OS. For example, you need to install 64-bit Windows 8 device drivers in a 
64-bit installation of Windows 8. It might be possible to download drivers for your OS from the website 
of the card manufacturer.
	 Back up important data that is not already backed up. Before you open the computer case, be sure to 
back up important data on the hard drive.
	 Know your starting point. Know what works and doesn’t work on the system. Can you connect to the 
network and the Internet, print, and use other installed adapter cards without errors?
Here are the general directions to install an adapter card. They apply to any type of card.
1. Read the documentation that came with the card. For most cards, you install the card first and then the 
drivers, but some adapter card installations might not work this way.
2. If you are installing a card to replace an onboard port, access UEFI/BIOS setup and disable the port.
3. Wear an ESD strap as you work to protect the card and the system against ESD. Shut down the system, 
unplug power cords and cables, and press the power button to drain the power. Remove the computer 
case cover.
4. Locate the slot you plan to use and remove the faceplate cover from the slot if one is installed. 
Sometimes a faceplate punches or snaps out, and sometimes you have to remove a faceplate screw to 
remove the faceplate. Remove the screw in the top of the expansion slot or raise the clip on the top of 
the slot. Save the screw; you’ll need it later.
5. Remove the card from its antistatic bag and insert it into the expansion slot. Be careful to push the card 
straight down into the slot, without rocking the card from side to side. Rocking it from side to side 
can widen the expansion slot, making it difficult to keep a good contact. If you have a problem getting 
the card into the slot, resist the temptation to push the front or rear of the card into the slot first. You 
should feel a slight snap as the card drops into the slot.
Recall that PCIe x16 slots use a retention mechanism in the slot to help stabilize a heavy card (see  
Figure 9-24). For these slots, you might have to use one finger to push the stabilizer to the side as you push 
the card into the slot. Alternately, the card might snap into the slot and then the retention mechanism snaps 
into position. Figure 9-25 shows a PCIe video card installed in a PCIe x16 slot.

6. Insert the screw that anchors the card to the top of the slot (see Figure 9-26). Be sure to use this screw.  
If it’s not present, the card can creep out of the slot over time.

7. Connect any power cords or data cables the card might use. For example, a video card might have a 6-pin 
or 8-pin PCIe power connector for a power cord from the power supply to the card (see Figure 9-27). 
(If the power supply does not have the right connector, you can buy an inexpensive adapter to convert a 
4-pin Molex connector to a PCIe connector.) In another example, look at Figure 9-3 shown earlier in  
the chapter. This FireWire card requires a power connection using a 4-pin Molex power cable from the 
power supply.
Figure 9-27  Connect a power cord to the PCIe power connector on the card
  8. Make a quick check of all connections and cables, and then replace the case cover. (If you want, you 
can leave the case cover off until you’ve tested the card, in case it doesn’t work and you need to reseat 
it.) Plug up the external power cable and essential peripherals.
  9. Start the system. When Windows starts, it should detect a new hardware device is present and attempt 
to automatically install the drivers. As the drivers are installed, a message might appear above the 
taskbar. When you click the message, the Device Setup window appears (refer back to Figure 9-6). You 
can cancel the wizard and manually install the drivers.
10. Insert the CD that came bundled with the card and launch the setup program on the CD. The card 
documentation will tell you the name of the program (examples are Setup.exe and Autorun.exe).  
Figure 9-28 shows the opening menu for one setup program for a video card. Click Install Video Drivers 
and follow the on screen instructions to install the drivers. If you are using downloaded driver files, 
double-click the file to begin the installation and follow the directions on screen.
Notes All 64-bit drivers must be certified by Microsoft to work in Windows. However, some 32-bit drivers might not 
be. During the driver installation, if you see a message that says 32-bit drivers have not been certified, go ahead and give 
permission to install the drivers if you obtained them from the manufacturer or another reliable source.

11. After the drivers are installed, you might be asked to restart the system. Then you can configure the card 
or use it with application software. If you have problems with the installation, turn to Device Manager 
and look for errors reported about the device. The card might not be properly seated in the slot.

Now let’s turn our attention to a little information about three types of cards you might be called on to 
install. As with any adapter card you install, be sure to get familiar with the user guide before you start the 
installation so that you know the card’s hardware and software requirements and what peripheral devices 
it supports.

Notes Some motherboards provide extra ports that can be installed in faceplate openings off the back of the 
case. For example, Figure 9-29 shows a module that has a game port and two USB ports. To install the module, 
remove a faceplate and install the module in its place. Then connect the cables from the module to the appropriate 
connectors on the motherboard.

TV Tuner and Video Capture Cards
A TV tuner card can turn your computer into a television. A port on the card receives input 
from a TV cable and lets you view television on your computer monitor. If the TV signal is 
analog, the TV tuner card can convert it to digital. A video capture card lets you capture this 
video input and save it to a file on your hard drive. Some cards are a combination TV tuner 
card and video capture card, making it possible for you to receive television input and save that input to 
your hard drive (see Figure 9-31). A high-end TV tuner/video capture card might also serve as your video 
card. Also, some motherboards and laptop computers have onboard TV tuners and TV captures.

Replacing Expansion Cards in a Laptop
A laptop does not contain the normal PCI Express or PCI slots found in desktop systems. 
Newer laptops are likely to use the Mini PCI Express slots (also called Mini PCIe slots) that 
use the PCI Express standards applied to laptops. Mini PCI Express slots use 52 pins on the 
edge connector. These slots can be used by many kinds of Mini PCIe cards. These cards are 
often used to enhance communications options for a laptop, including Wi-Fi wireless, cellular WAN, and 
Bluetooth Mini PCIe cards. Figure 9-32 shows a Mini PCI Express Sierra Wireless mobile broadband 
Internet card. Older laptops use a Mini PCI slot (see Figure 9-33), which uses PCI standards. Mini PCI 
cards are about twice the size of Mini PCI Express cards. Figure 9-34 shows a Wi-Fi Mini PCI card by

the image. At the center of the layers is the liquid crystal 
material. Next to it is the layer responsible for providing 
color to the image. These two layers are sandwiched 
between two grids of electrodes forming columns and rows. 
Each intersection of a row electrode and a column electrode 
forms one pixel on the LCD panel. Software can address

Two common classes of LCD monitors are:
	 Twisted Nematic (TN) LCD monitors are preferred by gamers because they have fast response times 
to keep fast-moving images crisp. However, TN monitors are brighter, consume more power, and have 
limited viewing angles.
	 In-Plane Switching (IPS) monitors are a newer technology that offers truer color images and better 
viewing angles. However, IPS monitors are expensive and have slower response times.
The LCD panel does not produce any light so it needs a source of light, called backlighting. There are 
two common types of backlighting:
	 Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp (CCFL) backlighting, also called fluorescent backlighting, is an 
older technology first used in laptop monitors. It uses one or two fluorescent tubes to light the panel. 
An inverter circuit board provides power to the fluorescent light. Two fluorescent tubes (CCFL-2) 
requires two inverter boards.
	 LED (light-emitting diode) backlighting receives its DC power directly from the motherboard and 
doesn’t use an inverter. The growing trend for most monitor manufacturers is to use LED backlighting, 
which provides a better range and accuracy of color and uses less power than fluorescent backlighting. 
LED technology also uses less mercury, and is, therefore, kinder to the environment when an LCD 
monitor is disposed of. When you see a monitor advertised as an LED monitor, know the monitor 
is an LCD monitor that uses LED backlighting.
	 Plasma monitor. A plasma monitor provides high contrast with better color than LCD monitors. They 
work by discharging xenon and neon plasma on flat glass and don’t contain mercury. Plasma monitors 
are expensive and heavy and are generally available only in large commercial sizes.
	 Projector. A digital projector (see Figure 9-40) is used to shine a light that projects a transparent image onto 
a large screen and is often used in classrooms or with other large groups. Several types of technologies are 
used by projectors, including LCD. A projector is often installed on a computer as a dual monitor, which 
you learn how to do later in the chapter.

	 OLED monitor. An OLED (organic light-emitting diode) monitor uses a thin LED layer or film between 
two grids of electrodes and does not use backlighting. It does not emit as much light as an LCD monitor 
does, and, therefore, can produce deeper blacks, provide better contrast, work in darker rooms, and 
use less power than can an LCD monitor. On the other hand, LED monitors give less glare than OLED 
monitors. OLED screens are used by digital cameras, camcorders, mobile devices, and other small 
portable electronic devices. OLED monitors are just now appearing for desktop systems.
A laptop display almost always uses LCD technology, although laptops that use OLED display are 
available. It is expected that laptops will one day use plasma display because plasma is expected to use only 
about 20 percent as much power as LCD and gives better quality display than LCD. Some laptop LCD 
panels use LED backlighting to improve display quality and conserve power.
For desktops, by far the most popular monitor type is LCD. Figure 9-41 shows an ad for one high-end 
LCD monitor. Table 9-3 explains the features mentioned in the ad.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know about these monitor features: refresh rate, resolution, 
native resolution, brightness in lumens, and analog and digital connectors used.
Monitor Characteristic
Description
Screen size
The screen size is the diagonal length of the screen surface in inches.
Aspect ratio
The aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between width and height. Common aspect 
ratios are 4:3, 16:9, and 16:10. Sometimes, an image must be converted from one aspect 
ratio to another. Three ways to convert a standard 4:3 image to a wide screen 16:9 is to add 
black bars to either side of the image to fill in the space; stretch the image horizontally, 
which creates distortion; or zoom without distorting the image until the image touches the 
sides, which will crop the top and bottom of the image.
Refresh rate
The refresh rate is the number of times a monitor screen is built or refreshed in one 
second, measured in Hz (cycles per second). The ad in Figure 9-41 shows the monitor 
refresh rate as 60 Hz (60 frames per second)—the higher, the better. Related to 
refresh rate, the response time is the time it takes to build one frame, measured in ms 
(milliseconds)—the lower, the better. The ad in Figure 9-41 shows a response time of 8 ms 
(time to build one frame).
Pixel pitch
A pixel is a spot or dot on the screen that can be addressed by software. The pixel pitch is 
the distance between adjacent pixels on the screen—the smaller the number, the better. An 
example of a pixel pitch is .283mm. 
Resolution
The resolution is the number of spots or pixels on a screen that can be addressed by 
software. Values can range from 640 × 480 up to 4096 × 2160 for high-end monitors. 
Popular resolutions are 1920 × 1080 and 1366 × 768.
Native resolution
The native resolution is the number of pixels built into the LCD monitor. Using the native 
resolution usually gives the highest-quality image.
Contrast ratio
Contrast ratio is the contrast between true black and true white on the screen—the higher 
the contrast ratio, the better. 1000:1 is better than 700:1.
An advertised dynamic contrast ratio is much higher than the contrast ratio, but is not a 
true measurement of contrast. Dynamic contrast adjusts the backlighting to give the effect 
of an overall brighter or darker image. For example, in Figure 9-41, the contrast ratio is 
1000:1, and the dynamic ratio is 20,000,000:1. When comparing quality of monitors, pay 
attention to the contrast ratio, more so than the dynamic ratio.
Viewing angle
The viewing angle is the angle of view when a monitor becomes difficult to see. A viewing 
angle of 170 degrees is better than 140 degrees.
Backlighting or 
brightness
Brightness is measured in cd/m2 (candela per square meter), which is the same as lumens/m2 
(lumens per square meter).
In addition, the best LED backlighting for viewing photography is class IPS, which provides 
the most accurate color.
Connectors
Options for connectors are VGA, DVI-I, DVI-D, HDMI, DisplayPort, and Apple’s Thunderbolt. 
Some monitors offer more than one connector (see Figure 9-42). These and other 
connectors used by video cards and monitors are discussed later in the chapter.
Other features
LCD monitors can also provide a privacy or antiglare surface, tilt screens, microphone 
input, speakers, USB ports, adjustable stands, and perhaps even a port for your iPod. Some 
monitors are also touch screens, so they can be used with a stylus or finger touch.
Table 9-3  Important features of a monitor
Caution
If you spend many hours in front of a computer, you may strain your eyes. To protect your eyes from strain, 
look away from the monitor into the distance every few minutes. Use a good monitor with a high refresh rate or low response 
time. The lower refresh rates that cause monitor flicker can tire and damage your eyes. When you first install a monitor, set 
the refresh rate at the highest value the monitor can support.

Video Cards and Connectors
Video cards (see Figure 9-43) are sometimes called graphics adapters, graphics cards, or 
display cards. Most motherboards sold today have one or more video ports integrated into 
the motherboard. If you are buying a motherboard with a video port, make sure that you can 
disable the video port on the motherboard if it gives you trouble. You can then install a video 
card and use its video port rather than the port on the motherboard. Recall that a video card can use a PCI 
or PCI Express slot on the motherboard. The fastest slot to use is a PCIe x16 slot.

Recall that types of video ports include VGA, S-Video, DVI, DisplayPort, and HDMI connectors. In 
addition to these ports, you also need to know about a composite video, miniHDMI, Mini-DIN-6, DVI-I, 
DVI-D, and DVI-A ports. All these ports are described here:
	 VGA. The 15-pin VGA port is the standard analog video port and transmits three signals of red, green, 
and blue (RGB). A VGA port is sometimes called a DB-15 port.
	 DVI ports. DVI ports were designed to replace VGA, and variations of DVI can transmit analog and/
or digital data. The five DVI standards for pinouts are shown in Figure 9-44. Three DVI connectors 
are shown in Figure 9-45. The DVI standards specify the maximum length for DVI cables is 5 meters, 
although some video cards produce a strong enough signal to allow for longer DVI cables.

	 Composite video. Using a composite video port, also called an RGB port, the red, green, and blue 
(RGB) are mixed together in the same signal. This is the method used by television and can be used by 
a video card that is designed to send output to a TV. Composite video uses a round RCA connector that 
is usually yellow and has a single pin in the center. Figure 9-48 shows a laptop that has a composite 
video input port so that you can use the laptop as your display for a game box. Composite video does 
not produce as sharp an image as VGA video or S-Video.

	 DVI-I. The DVI-I port (see Figure 9-46b) supports both analog and digital signals. If a computer has 
this type of port, you can use a digital-to-analog adapter to connect an older analog monitor to the 
port using a VGA cable (see Figure 9-47). If a video card has a DVI port, most likely it will be the 
DVI-I port (the one with the four extra holes) so that you can use an adapter to convert the port to 
a VGA port.
	 DVI-A. The DVI-A port only transmits analog data. You don’t see these very often.

	 S-Video (Super-Video) ports. An S-Video port is a 4-pin or 7-pin round port used by some televisions and 
video equipment. An S-Video cable is shown in Figure 9-49. A few older video cameras use a 6-pin varia-
tion of S-Video. The connector is called a Mini-DIN -6 connector and looks like a PS/2 connector used by a 
keyboard or mouse. (In general, a DIN connector is always round with multiple pins in the connector.)

	 DisplayPort. DisplayPort was designed to replace DVI and can transmit digital (not analog) video and 
audio data. It uses data packet transmissions similar to those of Ethernet, USB, and PCI Express, and 
is expected to ultimately replace VGA, DVI, and HDMI on desktop and laptop computers. Besides the 
regular DisplayPort used on video cards and desktop computers, laptops might use the smaller Mini 
DisplayPort. Figure 9-51 shows a DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort cable. Some DisplayPort controllers 
allow you to use a DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapter so the port can be used with an HDMI connection. 
Maximum length for DisplayPort cables is 15 meters.

Digital Rights Management (DRM) is meant to protect digital content and prevent piracy. DRM 
involves both software and hardware. HDMI and DVI allow for protected content to stay encrypted 
until it is on the presentation device. If you end up with a blank screen when playing a movie or no 
sound when listening to a CD, the problem may be that DRM is blocking the signal to prevent it from 
being pirated. In addition to protecting content from being pirated, DRM also limits quality of content 
based on its authorization. For example, a high-definition movie must be limited to DVD quality on 
video outputs that are not approved by DRM.

UEFI/BIOS setup can be used to manage onboard 
DisplayPort and HDMI ports. For example, look 
at Figure 9-5 shown earlier in the chapter, where 
you can enable or disable the audio transmissions 
of DisplayPort and HDMI ports and still use these 
ports for video.
	 HDMI and HDMI mini connectors. HDMI trans-
mits both digital video and audio (not analog), and 
was designed to be used by home theater equip-
ment. The HDMI standards allow for several types 
of HDMI connectors. The best known, which is 
used on most computers and televisions, is the Type 
A 19-pin HDMI connector. Small mobile devices 
can use the smaller Type C 19-pin HDMI mini 
connector, also called the mini-HDMI connector. 
Figure 9-52 shows a cable with both connectors 
that is useful when connecting some devices like a 
smart phone to a computer. Figure 9-53 shows an 
HDMI to DVI-D cable. Because HDMI does not 
transmit analog data, the connector works only on DVI-D and DVI-I ports, not DVI-A ports. To connect 
HDMI to VGA, you need an HDMI to VGA adapter with signal conversion because VGA is analog and 
HDMI is digital. The maximum length of an HDMI cable depends on the quality of the cable; no maxi-
mum length has been specified.

Now let’s see how to configure a monitor or dual monitors connected to a Windows computer.
Changing Monitor Settings
Settings that apply to the monitor can be managed by using the monitor buttons and Windows 
utilities. Using the monitor buttons, you can adjust the horizontal and vertical position of the 
screen on the monitor surface and change the brightness and contrast settings. For laptops, the 
brightness and contrast settings can be changed using function keys on the laptop.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know about these video connector types: VGA (DB-15), HDMI, 
Mini HDMI, DisplayPort, S-Video, Mini-DIN-6, composite (RGB), component, RCA, DVI-D, DVI-I, and DVI-A.
INSTALL Dual Monitors
To increase the size of your Windows desktop, you can install more than one monitor for a single com-
puter. To install dual monitors, you need two video ports on your system, which can come from moth-
erboard video ports, a video card that provides two video ports, or two video cards.
To install a second monitor in a dual-monitor setup using two video cards, follow these steps:
1.	 Verify the original video card works properly and decide whether it is to be the primary monitor.
2.	 Boot the computer and enter UEFI/BIOS setup. If UEFI/BIOS setup has the option to select the order in which 
video cards are initialized, verify the currently installed card is configured to initialize first. For example, for 
the UEFI/BIOS system in Figure 9-54, the video adapter in the PCIe slot initializes first before other video 
adapters. If it does not initialize first, then, when you install the second card, video might not work at all 
when you first boot with two cards.

3.	 Install a second video card in an empty slot. A computer might have a second PCIe slot or an unused PCI slot 
you can use. Attach the second monitor.
4.	 Boot the system. Windows recognizes the new hardware and launches Device Setup. You can use the utility 
to install the video card drivers or cancel the utility and install them manually as you learned to do earlier in 
the chapter.
Here are the steps to configure dual monitors:
1.	 Connect two monitors to your system. Open Control Panel in Classic view, click Display, and then click 
Adjust resolution. The Screen Resolution window appears (see Figure 9-55).

2.	 Notice the two numbered boxes that represent your two monitors. When you click one of these boxes, 
the drop-down menu changes to show the selected monitor, and the screen resolution and orientation 
(Landscape, Portrait, Landscape flipped, or Portrait flipped) follow the selected monitor. This lets you 
customize the settings for each monitor. If necessary, use drag-and-drop to arrange the boxes so that they 
represent the physical arrangement of your monitors.
3.	 Adjust the screen resolution according to your preferences. For the sharpest images, use the native resolution 
for each monitor. Most often, the native resolution is the highest resolution listed, but this is not always the 
case. To know for certain the native resolution, see the documentation that came with the monitor.
4.	 The Screen Resolution window (refer back to Figure 9-55) allows you to select how to handle multiple dis-
plays. You can extend your desktop onto the second monitor, duplicate displays, or disable display on either 
monitor. To save the settings, click Apply. The second monitor should initialize and show the extended or 
duplicated desktop.
5.	 Close the Screen Resolution window. For an extended desktop, open an application and verify you can use 
the second monitor by dragging the application window over to the second monitor’s desktop.
After you add a second monitor to your system, you can move from one monitor to another simply by moving 
your mouse over the extended desktop. Switching from one monitor to the other does not require any special key-
stroke or menu option.
Most laptop computers are designed to be used with projectors and provide a VGA, DisplayPort, or HDMI port for 
this purpose. To use a projector, plug in the projector to the extra port and then turn it on. For a laptop computer, 
use a function key to activate the video port and toggle between extending the desktop to the projector, using only 
the projector, duplicating the screen on the projector, or not using the projector. When giving a presentation, most 
presenters prefer that they see their presentation duplicated on the LCD screen and the projector.
Video Memory and Windows
Video cards have their own processor called a graphics processing unit (GPU) or visual pro-
cessing unit (VPU). These processors use graphics RAM installed on the card so that RAM on 
the motherboard is not tied up with video data. (If a motherboard offers a video port rather 
than using a video card, the GPU is part of the onboard video controller and is called inte-
grated video. For integrated video, RAM on the motherboard is used for video data, or some video RAM 
is embedded on the motherboard.)

Notes In Figure 9-55, if you arrange the two boxes side by side, your extended desktop will extend left or 
right. If you arrange the two boxes one on top of the other, your extended desktop will extend up and down.
Notes For group presentations that require a projector, the software used for the presentations is likely to 
be Microsoft PowerPoint. If you configure your projector as a dual monitor, you can use PowerPoint to display a 
presentation to your audience on the projector at the same time you are using your LCD display to manage your 
PowerPoint slides. To do so, for PowerPoint, select the SLIDE SHOW tab. In the Set Up group, click Set Up Slide 
Show. In the Set Up Show box under Multiple monitors, check Show Presenter View or Use Presenter View and 
click OK.

The more RAM installed on the card, the better the performance. Most video cards used and sold today 
use DDR2, DDR3, Graphics DDR3 (GDDR3), GDDR4, or GDDR5 memory. Graphics DDR memory is 
faster than regular DDR memory and does a better job of storing 3D images. Some video cards have as 
much as 2 GB of graphics memory.
Most Windows 7/Vista editions offer the Aero user interface (also called Aero glass), which has a 3D 
appearance. Windows 8 removed Aero glass, but kept a few of the same features. The hardware must 
qualify for Aero glass before Windows can enable it. These requirements include onboard video or a video 
card that supports DirectX 9 or higher, has at least 128 MB of video memory, and uses the Windows 
Display Driver Model (WDDM). The Windows Display Driver Model is a Windows component that 
manages graphics. DirectX is a Microsoft software development tool that software developers can use to 
write multimedia applications such as games, video-editing software, and computer-aided design software. 
Components of DirectX include DirectDraw, DirectMusic, DirectPlay, and Direct3D. The video firmware 
on the video card or motherboard chipset can interpret DirectX commands to build 3D images as pre-
sented to them by the WDDM. In addition, Windows relies on DirectX and the WDDM to produce the 
Aero user interface.
If an application, such as a game or desktop publishing app, that relies heavily on graphics is not 
performing well or giving errors, the problem might be video memory or the version of DirectX the 
system is using. You can use the dxdiag.exe command to display information about hardware and 
diagnose problems with DirectX. To use the command in Windows 8, press Win+X and click Run. Then 
type dxdiag.exe in the Run box and press Enter. For Windows 7, click Start, type dxdiag.exe in the Search 
box, and press Enter. Respond to a message box that appears asking if you want to check if your drivers 
are digitally signed. Then the opening window shown in Figure 9-56 appears. Look for the version of 
DirectX installed (version 11 in the figure).

Video memory available to the graphics processor can be the graphics memory embedded on the video 
card or on the motherboard, system memory, or a combination of both. To see the video memory available 
to Windows, use Control Panel to open the Screen Resolution window (refer back to Figure 9-55). Click

Here is an explanation of the four entries in the dialog box that concern video memory:
	 Total Available Graphics Memory is total memory that may be available to the video subsystem.
	 Dedicated Video Memory is found on a video card or embedded on the motherboard. The motherboard 
in both the laptop and desktop have 32 MB of graphics memory.
	 System Video Memory is system RAM dedicated to video. No other application or component can use it.
	 Shared System Memory is system RAM that might be available to video if another application or com-
ponent is not already using it.
Troubleshooting I/O Devices
A computer usually has so many peripheral devices that chances are high you are going to 
have to troubleshoot at least one of everything at some point in your technical career. When 
this happens, always try the least invasive and least expensive solutions first. For example, try 
updating drivers of a graphic tablet before replacing it. So let’s learn how to handle some of 
the errors or problems you might encounter.
NumLock Indicator Light
If a user complains she cannot sign in to Windows even when she’s certain she is entering the 
correct password, ask her to make sure the NumLock key is set correctly. Laptops use this key 
to toggle between the keys interpreted as letters and numbers. Most laptops have a NumLock 
indicator light near the keyboard.
Device Manager
Device Manager is usually a good place to start troubleshooting. A Device Manager window 
is shown on the left side of Figure 9-59. Click a white arrow to expand the view of an item, 
and click a black arrow to collapse the view. Notice the yellow triangle beside the SM Bus 
Controller, which indicates a problem with this motherboard component. To see a device’s 
properties box, right-click the device and click Properties.

video memory. In other words, Total Available Graphics Memory must add up to at least 128 MB.

First try updating the drivers. (Click Update Driver on the General tab or the Driver tab.) If a driver 
update creates a problem, you can roll back (undo) the driver update if the previous drivers were working. 
(Windows does not save drivers that were not working before the driver update.) If you are still having a 
problem with a device, try uninstalling it and installing it again. (To uninstall the device, click Uninstall on 
the Driver tab.) Then reboot and reinstall the device, looking for problems during the installation that point 
to the source of the problem. Sometimes reinstalling a device is all that is needed to solve the problem.
If Windows is not able to locate new drivers for a device, locate and download the latest driver files from 
the manufacturer’s website to your hard drive. Be sure to use 64-bit drivers for a 64-bit OS and 32-bit driv-
ers for a 32-bit OS. If possible, use Windows 8 drivers for Windows 8, Windows 7 drivers for Windows 7, 
and Vista drivers for Vista. You can double-click the downloaded driver files to launch the installation.
Updating Port or Slot Drivers on a Laptop
If you ever have a problem with a port or slot on a laptop, first turn to Device Manager to see if errors are 
reported and to update the drivers for the port or slot. The laptop manufacturer has probably stored back-
ups of the drivers on the hard drive under support tools and on the recovery media if the recovery media 
is available. You can also download the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website. If the problem is 
still not solved after updating the drivers, try using Device Manager to uninstall the port or slot drivers and 
then use the support tools to reinstall the drivers.

Problems with Video Card Installations
When you install a video card, here is a list of things that can go wrong and what to do about them:
	 When you first power up the system, you hear a whining sound. This is caused by the card not getting 
enough power. Make sure a 6-pin or 8-pin power cord is connected to the card if it has this connector. 
The power supply might be inadequate.
	 When you first start up the system, you see nothing but a black screen. Most likely this is caused by the 
onboard video port not being disabled in UEFI/BIOS setup. Disable the port.
	 When you first start up the system, you hear a series of beeps. UEFI/BIOS cannot detect a video card. 
Make sure the card is securely seated. The video slot or video card might be bad.
	 Error messages about video appear when Windows starts. This can be caused by a conflict in onboard 
video and the video card. Try disabling onboard video in Device Manager.
	 Games crash or lock up. Try updating drivers for the motherboard, the video card, and the sound card. 
Also install the latest version of DirectX. (You learn about DirectX later in the chapter.) Then try unin-

If you hear one or no beep during the boot and you see a blank screen, then UEFI/BIOS has successfully 
completed POST, which includes a test of the video card or onboard video. You can then assume the prob-
lem must be with the monitor or the monitor cable. Ask these questions and try these things:
1. Is the monitor power cable plugged in?
2. Is the monitor turned on? Try pushing the power button on the front of the monitor. An indicator light 
on the front of the monitor should turn on, indicating the monitor has power.
3. Is the monitor cable plugged into the video port at the back of the computer and the connector on the 
rear of the monitor?
4. Try a different monitor and a different monitor cable that you know are working.
Notes A user very much appreciates a support technician who takes a little extra time to clean a system being  
serviced. When servicing a monitor, take the time to clean the screen with a soft dry cloth or monitor wipe.
Notes When you turn on your computer, the first thing you see on the screen is the firmware on the video card  
identifying itself. You can use this information to search the web, especially the manufacturer’s website, for troubleshoot-
ing information about the card.

Monitor Indicator Light Is on; No Image on screen
For this problem, try the following:
  1. Make sure the video cable is securely connected at the computer and the monitor. Most likely the prob-
lem is a bad cable connection.
  2. If the monitor displays POST but goes blank when Windows starts to load, the problem is Windows 
and not the monitor or video. Boot from the Windows setup DVD and perform a Startup Repair, which 
you learned to do in the chapter, “Supporting the Power System and Troubleshooting Computers.” If 
this works, change the driver and resolution. Other tools for troubleshooting Windows are covered 
later in the text.
  3. The monitor might have a switch on the back for choosing between 110 volts and 220 volts. Check 
that the switch is in the correct position.
  4. The problem might be with the video card. If you have just installed the card and the motherboard has 
onboard video, go into BIOS setup and disable the video port on the motherboard.
  5. Verify the video cable is connected to the video port on the video card and not to a disabled onboard 
video port.
  6. Using buttons on the front of the monitor, check the contrast adjustment. If there’s no change, leave it 
at a middle setting.
  7. Check the brightness or backlight adjustment. If there’s no change, leave it at a middle setting.
  8. If the monitor-to-computer cable detaches from the monitor, exchange it for a cable you know is good, 
or check the cable for continuity. If this solves the problem, reattach the old cable to verify that the 
problem was not simply a bad connection.
  9. Test a monitor you know is good on the computer you suspect to be bad. If you think the monitor is 
bad, make sure that it also fails to work on a good computer.
10. Open the computer case and reseat the video card. If possible, move the card to a different expansion 
slot. Clean the card’s edge connectors, using a contact cleaner purchased from a computer supply store.
11. If there are socketed chips on the video card, remove the card from the expansion slot and then use a 
screwdriver to press down firmly on each corner of each socketed chip on the card. Chips sometimes 
loosen because of temperature changes; this condition is called chip creep.
12. Trade a good video card for the video card you suspect is bad. Test the video card you think is bad on 
a computer that works. Test a video card you know is good on the computer that you suspect is bad. 
Whenever possible, do both.
13. Test the RAM on the motherboard with memory diagnostic software.
14. For a motherboard that is using a PCI-Express video card, try using a PCI video card in a PCI slot or 
a PCIe ×1 video card in a PCIe ×1 slot. A good repair technician keeps an extra PCI video card around 
for this purpose.
15. Trade the motherboard for one you know is good. Sometimes, though rarely, a peripheral chip on the 
motherboard can cause the problem.

impression of that image on the monitor. An alternate method to avoid burn-in is to use a screen saver 
that has a moving image or a rotation of varying images. To wake up the computer, press any key on the 
keyboard or press the power button. Use the Power Options applet in Control Panel to configure the sleep 
settings on a computer.
Poor Display
In general, you can solve problems with poor display by using controls on the monitor and using Windows 
settings. Do the following:
	 LCD monitor controls. Use buttons on the front of an LCD monitor to adjust color, brightness, contrast, 
focus, and horizontal and vertical positions.
	 Windows display settings. Use Windows settings to adjust font size, screen resolution, brightness, color, 
and Clear Type text. Open Control Panel in Classic view and click Display. Use these settings to adjust 
the display:
	 To make sure Clear Type text is selected, click Adjust ClearType text and turn on ClearType (see 
Figure 9-60). Then follow the steps in the wizard to improve the quality of text displayed on the 
screen.
Figure 9-60  ClearType in Windows improves the display of text on the screen
	 LCD monitors will not experience distorted geometry if the resolution is set to the native resolution. 
So if monitor shows distorted geometry where images are stretched inappropriately, adjust the reso-
lution. Also a low resolution can cause oversized images or icons. To adjust screen resolution, click 
Change display settings in the Display window.
Notes Problems might occur if the motherboard power-saving features are turning off the monitor, and Windows 
screen saver is also turning off the monitor. If the system hangs when you try to get the monitor going again, try  
disabling one or the other. If this doesn’t work, disable both.
Notes If adjusting the resolution doesn’t correct oversized images or icons, try updating the video drivers.

	 To calibrate colors, click Calibrate color in the Display window and follow the directions on screen. As 
you do so, color patterns appear (see Figure 9-61). Use these screens to adjust the gamma settings, which 
define the relationships among red, green, and blue as well as other settings that affect the display.
Figure 9-61  Two screens in the Windows 8 color calibration wizard
	 Update the video drivers. The latest video drivers can solve various problems with the video subsystem, 
including poor display.
Here are a few other display problems and their solutions:
	 Dead pixels. An LCD monitor might have pixels that are not working called dead pixels, which can 
appear as small white, black, or colored spots on your screen. A black or white pixel is likely to be a 
broken transistor, which cannot be fixed. Having a few dead pixels on an LCD monitor screen is consid-
ered acceptable and usually not covered under the manufacturer’s warranty.
	 Dim image. A laptop computer dims the LCD screen when the computer is running on battery to 
conserve the charge. You can brighten the screen using the Windows display settings. To do so, open 
Control Panel in Classic view, click Display, and then click Adjust brightness (see Figure 9-62). To check 
if settings to conserve power are affecting screen brightness, note the power plan that is selected. Click 
Change plan settings for this power plan. On the next screen, you can adjust when or if the screen will 
dim (see Figure 9-63). If the problem is still not resolved, it might be a hardware problem. How to trou-
bleshoot hardware in laptops is covered later in this chapter.
Notes A pixel might not be a dead pixel (a hardware problem), but only a stuck pixel (a software problem). You 
might be able to use software to fix stuck pixels. For example, run the online software at www.flexcode.org/lcd2.html to 
fix stuck pixels. The software works by rapidly changing all the pixels on the screen. (Be aware the screen flashes rapidly 
during the fix.)

A dim image in a desktop monitor might be caused by a faulty video card or a faulty monitor. To find 
out which is the problem, connect a different monitor. If the monitor is the problem, most likely the 
backlighting in the LCD monitor is faulty and the monitor needs replacing.
	 Artifacts. Horizontally torn images on screen are called artifacts (see Figure 9-64), and happen when the 
video feed from the video controller gets out of sync with the refresh of the monitor screen. The problem 
can be caused by hardware or software. A common cause is when the GPU on the video card overheats. 
You can test that possibility by downloading and running freeware to monitor the temperature of the 
CPU and the GPU while you’re playing a video game. If you notice the problem occurs when the GPU

	 Try updating the video drivers. However, if you 
see artifacts on the screen before Windows loads, 
then you know the problem is not caused by 
the drivers. The problem might be caused by the 
monitor. Try using a different monitor to see if 
the problem goes away. If so, replace the monitor.
	
	 Overclocking can cause artifacts. Other causes 
of artifacts are the motherboard or video card 
going bad, which can happen if the system has 
been overheating or video RAM on the card is 
faulty. Try replacing the video card. The power 
supply also might be the problem.
In general, to improve video quality, upgrade the 
video card and/or monitor. Poor display might be 
caused by inadequate video RAM. Your video card 
might allow you to install additional video RAM. 
See the card’s documentation.

CORRECT WINDOWS DISPLAY SETTINGS 
WHEN THE SCREEN IS UNREADABLE
When the display settings don’t work, you can easily return to standard VGA settings called VGA mode, 
which includes a resolution of 640 × 480 or 800 × 600 for some systems.
To use VGA mode when Windows 8 is able to boot and you can use at least one monitor, do the 
following:
1.	 Press Win+X and click Run. In the Run box, type msconfig.exe and press Enter. The System Configuration 
box appears. Click the Boot tab (see Figure 9-66).

Video System in a Laptop
If the LCD panel shows a black screen, but the power light indicates that power is getting to 
the system, the video subsystem might be the source of the problem. Do the following:
1.  Look for an LCD cutoff switch or button on the laptop (see Figure 9-67). The switch must 
be on for the LCD panel to work.

2. If using an onboard video port, try to use the video port to connect it to an external monitor. After you 
connect the monitor, use a function key to toggle between the LCD panel, the external monitor, and 
both the panel and monitor. If the external monitor works, but the LCD panel does not work, try these 
things using the external monitor:
	 Check Device Manager for warnings about the video controller and to update the video drivers.
	 Check Event Viewer for reported problems with the video subsystem. You learned about Event 
Viewer in the chapter, “Supporting the Power System and Troubleshooting Computers.”
3. If you still can’t get the LCD panel on a laptop to work, but the external monitor does work, you have 
proven the problem is with the LCD panel assembly. In a laptop, a dim screen or no display can be 
caused by a bad inverter. If replacing the inverter does not help, the next task is to replace the LCD panel. 
Be aware the replacement components might cost more than the laptop is worth. Steps to replace the 
LCD panel in a laptop are covered later in the chapter.
Cannot Connect to External Monitor
When wanting to expand desktop space or possibly troubleshoot video problems, you need to be able to use 
an external monitor with a laptop. If the connection to the external monitor fails, try the following solutions:
1. Make sure the monitor is getting power.
2. Use the Function keys to toggle between the laptop display and the external monitor. (Alternately, you 
can press Win+P to toggle between displays.)
3. Try using a different cable.
4. Try using a different connection if the laptop and monitor have another option available.

Touch Screen Is NonResponsive
Smart phones, tablets, and some laptops offer a touch screen. If the touch screen becomes unresponsive, try 
the following solutions:
1. Wash and thoroughly dry your hands.
2. If there is a case or screen protector, remove it. Some screen protectors are too thick and interfere with 
the touch screen interface. Use a screen protector that is licensed for your device.
3. Clean the screen with an electronic wipe, or with a soft, lint-free cloth.
4. Restart the device.
5. If you recently installed a third-party app when the touch screen became unresponsive, try uninstalling 
that app. Sometimes third-party apps can cause a touch screen to freeze.
6. Recalibrate the touch screen. For a laptop, open Control Panel in Classic view and click Tablet PC 
Settings. See Figure 9-68. (The item in Control Panel shows up only if you have a touch screen.)

Flickering, Dim, or Otherwise Poor Video
Use these tips to solve problems with bad video:
	 Verify Windows display settings. Try using the native 
resolution for the LCD panel. This resolution will be 
the highest resolution available unless the wrong video 
drivers are installed.
	 Try adjusting the brightness, which is a function of the 
backlight component of the LCD panel.
	 Try updating the video drivers. Download the latest drivers 
from the laptop’s manufacturer’s website. Bad drivers can 
cause an occasional ghost cursor on screen. A ghost cursor 
is a trail left behind when you move the mouse.
	 A flickering screen can be caused by bad video drivers, a 
low refresh rate, a bad inverter, or loose connections inside 
the laptop. To adjust the refresh rate, use Control Panel 
to open the Display window. In the Display window, click 
Change display settings. In the Screen Resolution window, 
click Advanced settings. On the Monitor tab, select the 
highest refresh rate available (see Figure 9-69).

Replacing the LCD Panel in a Laptop
Because the LCD panel is so fragile, it is one component that is likely to be broken when a laptop is not 
handled properly. If the LCD display is entirely black, most likely you’ll have to replace the entire LCD 
assembly. However, for a laptop that uses fluorescent backlighting, if the screen is dim, but you can make 
out that some display is present, the problem might be the inverter. The inverter board converts DC to AC 
used to power the backlighting of the LCD panel (see Figure 9-70). Check with the laptop manufacturer to 
confirm that it makes sense to first try replacing just the relatively inexpensive inverter board before you 
replace the more expensive entire LCD panel assembly. If the entire assembly needs replacing, the cost of 
the assembly might exceed the value of the laptop.
Sometimes, a laptop LCD panel, including the entire cover and hinges, is considered a single field 
replaceable unit, and sometimes components within the LCD assembly are considered FRUs. For example, 
the field replaceable units for the display panel in Figure 9-71 are the LCD front bezel, the hinges, the LCD

panel, the inverter board, the LCD interface cables, the LCD USB cover, and the rear cover. Also know 
that an LCD assembly might include a microphone, webcam, or speakers that are embedded in the laptop 
lid. For other laptops, the microphone and speakers are inside the case. The speakers are considered a 
field replaceable unit. In addition, a Wi-Fi antenna might be in the lid of the laptop, which is why if you 
need a better Wi-Fi signal, you should raise the lid of the laptop. When you disassemble the lid, you must 
disconnect the antenna from the bottom part of the laptop.
Some high-end laptops contain a video card that has embedded video memory. This video card might 
also need replacing. In most cases, you would replace only the LCD panel and perhaps the inverter board.
Before you begin any disassembly of a laptop, refer to the manufacturer documentation. The following 
are some general directions to replace an LCD panel:
1. Remove the AC adapter and the battery pack.
2. Remove the upper keyboard bezel. (A bezel is a band that holds a device in place and the keyboard bezel 
is a band around the keyboard that holds it in place.) You might also need to remove the keyboard.
3. Remove the screws holding the hinge in place and remove the hinge cover. Figure 9-72 shows a laptop 
with a metal hinge cover, but some laptops use plastic covers that you can easily break as you remove 
them. Be careful with the plastic ones.
4. Remove the screws holding the LCD panel to the laptop.
5. You’re now ready to remove the LCD panel from the laptop. Be aware there might be wires running 
through the hinge assembly, cables, or a pin connector. Cables might be connected to the motherboard 
using ZIF connectors. As you remove the LCD top cover, be careful to watch for how the panel is 
connected. Don’t pull on wires or cables as you remove the cover, but first carefully disconnect them.
6. Next, remove screws that hold the top cover and LCD panel together. Sometimes, these screws are 
covered with plastic or rubber circles or pads that match the color of the case. First use a dental pick or 
small screwdriver to pick off these covers. You should then be able to remove the front bezel and separate 
the rear cover from the LCD panel. For one LCD panel, when you separate the LCD assembly from the 
lid cover, you can see the inverter board. Figure 9-73 shows the inverter being compared with the new 
one to make sure they match. The match is not identical but should work.

7. Disconnect the old inverter and install the new one. When disconnecting the ribbon cable from the old 
inverter, notice you must first lift up on the lock holding the ZIF connector in place, as shown in Figure 9-74.
8. Install the new inverter. Reassemble the LCD panel assembly. Make sure the assembly is put together 
with a tight fit so that all screws line up well.
9. Reattach the LCD panel assembly to the laptop.

Speakers in a Laptop
Laptops and other mobile devices have built-in speakers. If you’re not getting any sound from 
the speakers, try the following solutions:
  Make sure the volume is turned up.
  Update the audio output drivers.
	 Run the Playing Audio troubleshooting tool. Open Control Panel in Classic view and select 
Troubleshooting. In the Hardware and Sound group, select Troubleshoot audio playback. Follow the 
on-screen instructions for the Playing Audio troubleshooting wizard.
Sometimes speakers might get cracks or tears in the membrane that creates the sound, but also consider 
that laptop speakers are generally quieter than external speakers. When laptop speakers start sounding 
weak or unclear, first try updating the speaker drivers using Device Manager. You can also try plugging an 
external set of speakers to the audio port of the laptop. If using external speakers isn’t convenient for the 
user, then you can replace the broken speakers.

Basic Principles for Supporting Devices
	Adding new devices to a computer requires installing hardware and software. Even if you know how to 
generally install an I/O device, always follow the specific instructions of the product manufacturer.
	Use Device Manager under Windows to manage hardware devices and to solve problems with them.
	Popular I/O ports on a motherboard include eSATA (Versions 1, 2, and 3), FireWire 800 and 400, and 
USB (Versions 1, 2, and 3). Older ports include parallel, serial, and PS/2 ports.
	Wireless connections can use Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n, Bluetooth, and Infrared standards.
	USB connectors include the A-Male, B-Male, Mini-B, Micro-B, Micro-A, USB 3.0 B-Male, and USB 3.0 
Micro-B connectors.
Installing I/O Peripheral Devices
	When installing devices, use 32-bit drivers for a 32-bit OS and 64-bit drivers for a 64-bit OS.
	A touch screen is likely to use a USB port. Software is installed to calibrate the touch screen to the 
monitor screen and receive data input.
	Biometric input devices, such as a fingerprint reader, collect biological data and compare it with that 
recorded about the person to authenticate the person’s access to a system.
	A KVM switch lets you use one keyboard, monitor, and mouse with multiple computers.
Installing and Configuring Adapter Cards
	Generally, when an adapter card is physically installed in a system and Windows starts up, it detects the 
card and then you install the drivers using the Windows wizard. However, always follow specific instruc-
tions from the device manufacturer when installing an adapter card because the order of installing the 
card and drivers might be different.

Key Terms
	A TV tuner card turns your computer or laptop into a television. A video capture card allows you to 
capture input from a camcorder or directly from TV. Combo cards have both abilities. A sound card 
allows you to input audio and use multispeaker systems.
Supporting the Video Subsystem
	Types of monitors include LCD monitor, plasma monitor, projector, and OLED monitor. An LCD 
monitor can use two types of backlighting: fluorescent and LED.
	Technologies and features of LCD monitors include screen size, refresh rate, pixel pitch, resolution, 
native resolution, contrast ratio, viewing angle, backlighting, and connectors that a monitor uses.
	Video ports that a video card or motherboard might provide are VGA, DVI-I, DVI-D, DVI-A, composite 
video, S-Video, component video, DisplayPort, HDMI, and HDMI mini ports.
	Use the Screen Resolution window to configure a monitor resolution and configure dual monitors.
	To use the Aero user interface, Windows 7/Vista requires a video card or onboard video to have at least 
128 MB of video RAM, support DirectX version 9 or higher, and use the Windows Display Driver 
Model (WDDM).
	The dxdiag.exe command is used to report information about hardware, including the video card and 
which version of DirectX it is using.
Troubleshooting I/O Devices
	Use Device Manager to update drivers on I/O devices giving trouble.
	Video problems can be caused by the monitor, video cable, video card, onboard video, video drivers, or 
Windows display settings.
	To bypass Windows display settings, boot the system to the Advanced Boot Options menu and select 
Safe Mode or Enable low-resolution video (640 × 480).
	A few dead pixels on an LCD monitor screen are considered acceptable by the manufacturer.
	Artifacts on the monitor screen can be caused by hardware, software, overheating, or overclocking. Try 
updating video drivers and checking for high temperatures.

Real Problem 9-1 Helping with Upgrade Decisions
Upgrading an existing system can sometimes be a wise thing to do, but sometimes the upgrade costs more 
than the system is worth. Also, if existing components are old, they might not be compatible with compo-
nents you want to use for the upgrade. A friend, Renata, asks your advice about several upgrades she is 
considering. Answer these questions:
	 1.	 Renata has a four-year-old desktop computer that has a Core2 Duo processor and 2 GB of memory. 
It does not have a FireWire port. She wants to use a camcorder that has a FireWire 400 interface to 
a PC. How would she perform the upgrade, and what is the cost? Save or print webpages to support 
your answers.
	 2.	 Her computer has one USB port, but she wants to use her USB printer at the same time she uses her 
USB scanner. How can she do this, and how much will it cost? Save or print webpages to support your 
answers.
	 3.	 Renata also uses her Windows 8 computer for gaming and wants to get a better gaming experience. The 
computer is using onboard video and has an empty PCI Express video slot. What is the fastest and best 
graphics card she can buy? How much does it cost? Save or print webpages to support your answer.
	 4.	 What is the total cost of all the upgrades Renata wants? Do you think it is wise for her to make 
these upgrades or would it be wiser to purchase a new system? How would you explain your 
recommendation to her?

Real Problem 9-2 Using Input Director
Input Director is software that lets you use one keyboard and mouse to control two or more computers 
that are networked together. You can download the free software from www.inputdirector.com. To use 
the software, you need to know the host name of each computer that will share the keyboard and mouse. 
To find out the host name, in Windows 8, right-click Start and select System. In Windows 7 right-click 
Computer and select Properties. The host name is listed as the Computer name.
Working with a partner, download and install Input Director and configure it so that you and your partner 
are using the same keyboard and mouse for your computers.
Real Problem 9-3 Researching a Computer Ad
Pick a current website or magazine ad for a complete, working desktop computer system, including com-
puter, monitor, keyboard, and software, together with extra devices such as a mouse or printer. Research the 
details of the ad and write a two- to four-page report describing and explaining these details. This project 
provides a good opportunity to learn about the latest offerings on the market as well as current pricing.
Real Problem 9-4 Working with a Monitor
Do the following to practice changing monitor settings and troubleshooting monitor problems:
	 1.	 Practice changing the display settings, including the wallpaper, screen saver, and appearance. If you are 
not using your own computer, be sure to restore each setting after making changes.
	 2.	 Pretend you have made a mistake and selected a combination of foreground and background colors 
that makes reading the screen impossible. Solve the problem by booting Windows into Safe Mode. 
Correct the problem and then reboot.
	 3.	 Change the monitor resolution. Try several resolutions. Make a change and then make the change per-
manent. You can go back and adjust it later if you want.
	 4.	 Work with a partner who is using a different computer. Unplug the monitor in the computer lab or 
classroom, loosen or disconnect the computer monitor cable, or turn the contrast and brightness all 
the way down while your partner does something similar to the other computer. Trade computers and 
troubleshoot the problems.
	 5.	 Wear an ESD strap. Turn off the computer, press the power button, remove the case cover, and loosen 
the video card. Turn on the computer and write down the problem as a user would describe it. Turn 
off the computer, reseat the card, and verify that everything works.
	 6.	 Turn off your system. Insert into the system a defective video card provided by your instructor. Turn 
on the system. Describe the resulting problem in writing, as a user would.

Maintaining Windows
E
arlier in the text, you learned how to install Windows. This 
chapter takes you to the next step in learning how to support a 
Windows operating system: maintaining the OS after it is installed. 
Most Windows problems stem from poor maintenance. If you are an 
IT support technician responsible for the ongoing support of several 
computers, you can make your work easier and your users happier by 
setting up and executing a good maintenance plan for each computer 
you support. A well-maintained computer gives fewer problems and 
performs better than one that is not maintained. In this chapter, you 
learn how to schedule regular maintenance tasks, prepare for disaster 
by setting up backup routines for user data and system files, use 
commands to manage files and folders, and manage a hard drive.
This text covers Windows 8.1, 8.0, 7, and Vista. As you read, 
you might consider following the steps in the chapter first using a 
Windows 8.1 system, and then going through the chapter again using 
a Windows 7 system.

Maintaining Windows
Schedule Preventive Maintenance
Regular preventive maintenance can keep a Windows computer performing well for years. At 
least once a month, you need to verify critical Windows settings and clean up the hard drive. 
These skills are covered in this part of the chapter. If you notice the system is slow as you do 
this maintenance, you need to dig deeper to optimize Windows. How to optimize Windows is 
covered later in the chapter “Optimizing Windows.”

Verify Critical Windows Settings
Three Windows settings discussed here are critical for keeping the system protected from 
malware and hackers. Users sometimes change these settings without realizing their 
importance. Check the three settings and, if you find settings that are incorrect, take time to 
explain to the primary user of the computer how important these settings are. Here are the 
critical Windows settings you need to verify:
	 Windows updates. Install any important Windows updates or Windows 7 service packs that are waiting 
to be installed and verify that Windows Update is configured to automatically allow updating. These 
updates may include updates to Windows, applications, device drivers, and firmware. You learned how 
to configure Windows Update in the chapter “Installing Windows.”
	 Antivirus/anti-malware software. To protect a system against malicious attack, you also need to verify 
that anti-malware software is configured to scan the system regularly and that it is up to date. If you 
discover it is not scanning regularly, take the time to do a thorough scan for viruses.
	 Network security setting. To secure the computer against attack from the network, check that the 
network security type (public or private in Windows 8; public, work, or home in Windows 7) is set 
correctly for the optimum firewall settings. How to verify the network type was covered in the chapter 
“Survey of Windows Features and Support Tools.” Further details of configuring network security are 
discussed in the chapter “Security Strategies.”

Update Drivers and Firmware
As part of routine maintenance, you normally would not update device drivers unless a device 
is having a problem or you want to use a new feature available with a driver update. In the 
chapter, “Installing Windows,” you learned to use Device Manager to update drivers. A few 
devices have firmware on the device that can be updated, which is called flashing firmware. 
For example, after a RAID controller had its drivers updated by Device Manager, new tabs appeared on the 
controller’s properties box that are put there by the drivers (see Figure 10-1). To flash the firmware on this 
controller card, you first download the flash image file from the device manufacturer’s website. Then click 
Browse and locate the file. Next, click Program Flash to begin the firmware update.

Notes When you’re responsible for a computer, be sure to keep good records of all that you do to maintain, upgrade, 
or fix the computer. When performing preventive maintenance, take notes and include those in your documentation. The 
Computer Inventory and Maintenance document available at cengagebrain.com can help you organize your notes.
Notes Don’t forget that what you learn about maintaining Windows also applies to Windows in a VM. When maintaining 
a VM, make sure Windows in a VM is updated, anti-malware software is installed and running, and network settings are secure.

Patch Management
When researching a problem, suppose you discover that Microsoft or a manufacturer’s website 
offers a fix or patch for Windows, a device driver, or an application. To download and apply 
the right patch, you need to make sure you get a 32-bit patch for a 32-bit installation of 
Windows, a device driver, or an application. For a 64-bit installation of Windows, make sure 
you get a 64-bit device driver. An application installed in a 64-bit OS might be a 32-bit application or a 
64-bit application.
The documentation on the Microsoft or other websites might be cryptic about the type of patch. Follow 
these guidelines when reading error messages or documentation:
	 The term x86 refers to 32-bit CPUs or processors and to 32-bit operating systems. For example, suppose 
you need to download a patch from Microsoft to fix a Windows 8.1 problem you are having with USB 
devices. The article on the Microsoft website that applies to your problem says to download the patch if 
you are using a Windows 8.1, x86-based version. This means you can use this patch if you are using a 
32-bit version of Windows 8.1.
	 All CPUs installed in personal computers today are hybrid processors that can process either 32 bits or 
64 bits. The term x86-64 refers to these processors, such as the Intel Core i5 or an AMD Phenom pro-
cessor. (AMD64 refers specifically to these hybrid AMD processors.) The term x86-64 can also refer to a 
64-bit OS. For example, a Windows message might say, “You are attempting to load an x86-64 operat-
ing system.” Take that to mean you are attempting to load a 64-bit OS onto a computer that has a 
hybrid 32-bit/64-bit processor installed, such as the Phenom II X4 or Intel Core i5.

Maintaining Windows
	 The term IA64 refers specifically to 64-bit Intel processors such as the Xeon or Itanium used in servers 
or high-end workstations. For example, suppose you are selecting a utility to download from the 
Microsoft website. One choice for the utility specifies an IA64 platform. Only select this choice if you 
have installed an Itanium or Xeon processor. (By the way, a techie often uses the word platform to mean 
the processor and operating system on which other software is running. However, in this context, the 
operating system’s platform is the processor.)
	 The term x64 refers to 64-bit operating systems. For example, Microsoft offers two versions of 
Windows 8.1: the x86 version and the x64 version.
Clean up the Hard Drive
For best performance, Windows needs at least 15 percent free space on the hard drive that it 
uses for defragmenting the drive, for burning CDs and DVDs, and for a variety of other tasks, 
so it’s important to delete unneeded files occasionally. In addition, you can improve drive 
performance and free up space by defragmenting magnetic hard drives, checking the drive for 
errors, compressing folders, and moving files and folders to other drives. All these tasks are discussed in the 
following subsections. We begin by learning where Windows puts important folders on the drive.
Directory Structures
Folder or directory locations you need to be aware of include those for user files, program files, and 
Windows data. In the folder locations given in this discussion, we assume Windows is installed on drive C:.
User Profile Namespace
When a user first signs in to Windows, a user profile is created, which is a collection of user data and 
settings, and consists of two general items:
	 A user folder together with its subfolders. These items are created under the C:\Users folder, for exam-
ple, C:\Users\Jean Andrews. This folder contains a group of subfolders collectively called the user profile 
namespace. (In general, a namespace is a container to hold data, for example, a folder.)
	 NTUSER.DAT. NTUSER.DAT is a hidden file stored in the C:\Users\username folder and contains user 
settings. Each time the user logs on, the contents of this file are copied to a location in the registry.
Program Files
Here is where Windows stores program files unless you select a different location when a program is 
installed:
	 Program files are stored in C:\Program Files for 32-bit versions of Windows. Only 32-bit applications 
can be installed in a 32-bit installation of Windows.
	 In 64-bit versions of Windows, 64-bit programs are stored in the C:\Program Files folder, and 32-bit 
programs are stored in the C:\Program Files (x86) folder.  (For best performance, when you have the 
option, install 64-bit applications in a 64-bit installation of Windows.)
Here are folders that applications and some utilities use to launch programs at startup:
	 A program file or shortcut to a program file stored in the C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\
Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup folder launches at startup for an individual user.
	 A program file or shortcut to a program file stored in the C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start 
Menu\Programs\Startup folder launches at startup for all users.

Folders for Windows Data
An operating system needs a place to keep hardware and software configuration information, user 
preferences, and application settings. This information is used when the OS is first loaded and when 
needed by hardware, applications, and users. Windows uses a database called the registry for most of this 
information. In addition, Windows keeps some data in text files called initialization files, which often have 
an .ini or .inf file extension.
Here are some important folder locations used for the registry and other Windows data:
	 Registry location. The Windows registry is stored in the C:\Windows\System32\config folder.
	 Backup of the registry. A backup of the registry is stored in the C:\Windows\System32\config\RegBack 
folder.
	 Fonts. Fonts are stored in the C:\Windows\Fonts folder.
	 Temporary files. These files, which are used by Windows when it is installing software and performing 
other maintenance tasks, are stored in the C:\Windows\Temp folder.
	 Offline files. Offline files are stored in the client-side caching (CSC) folder, which is C:\Windows\CSC. 
This folder is created and managed by the Offline Files utility, which allows users to work with files in 
the folder when the computer is not connected to the corporate network. Later, when a connection hap-
pens, Windows syncs up the offline files and folders stored in the C:\Windows\CSC folder with those on 
the network.
Use the Disk Cleanup Utility
Begin cleaning up the drive by finding out how much free space the drive has. Then use the Windows Disk 
Cleanup (cleanmgr.exe) utility to delete temporary files on the drive.
Notes Most often, Windows is installed on drive C:, although in a dual-boot environment, one OS might be installed 
on C: and another on a different drive. For example, Windows 7 can be installed on C: and Windows 8 installed on E:. Also, 
drive C: for one OS in a dual-boot system is likely to have a different drive letter in the other OS.
If the drive letter of the Windows volume is not known, it is written in Microsoft documentation as %SystemDrive%.  
For example, the location of the Program Files folder is written as %SystemDrive%\Program Files.
USE Disk Cleanup
Follow these steps to find out how much free space is on the drive, and use Disk Cleanup:

Windows is installed, most likely drive C:. Select Properties from the shortcut menu. The drive 
Properties box appears, as shown on the left side of Figure 10-2. You can see the free space on this drive C: is 
155 GB, which is about 37 percent of the volume.

2.	 On the General tab, click Disk Cleanup. (Alternatively, you can access the utility by executing the cleanmgr.exe 
program.) Disk Cleanup calculates how much space can be freed and then displays the Disk Cleanup box, shown 
on the right side of Figure 10-2. Select the files you want to delete.
3.	 Click Clean up system files to see temporary system files that you can also delete. The Disk Cleanup tab in 
Figure 10-3a shows the result for one computer. Notice in the figure the option to delete files from Previous 
Windows installation(s), which can free up additional hard drive space. This space is used by the Windows.
old folder, which was created when Windows 8 was installed as an upgrade from Windows 7 and stored the old 
Windows, Program Files, and User folders in the Windows.old folder. If the user assures you that no information, 
data, or settings are needed from the old Windows installation, it’s safe to delete these files to free up the space.

defragments the drive once a week. To defragment is to rearrange fragments or parts of files on the drive so 
each file is stored on the drive in contiguous clusters.
In a file system, a cluster, also called a file allocation unit, is a group of whole sectors. The number of sectors 
in a cluster is fixed and is determined when the file system is first installed. A file is stored in whole clusters, 
and the unused space at the end of the last cluster, called slack, is wasted free space. As files are written and 
deleted from a drive, clusters are used, released, and used again. New files written on the drive can be put 
in available clusters spread over the drive. Over time, drive performance is affected when the moving read/
write arm of a magnetic drive must move over many areas of the drive to collect all the fragments of a file. 
Defragmenting a drive rewrites files in contiguous clusters and improves drive performance.
Because a solid-state drive has no moving parts, defragmenting does not improve read/write time. In 
fact, defragmenting a solid-state drive can reduce the life of the drive and is not recommended. Windows 
disables defragmenting for solid-state drives.
4.	 If you still need more free space, click the More Options tab (see Figure 10-3b) in the Disk Cleanup box. In 
the Programs and Features area, click Clean up. You are taken to the Programs and Features window where 
you can uninstall unneeded software to recover that space. Also on the More Options tab in the Disk Cleanup 
box, when you click Clean up under the System Restore and Shadow Copies area, Windows will delete all but 
the most recent restore points that are created by System Restore. (You will learn more about System Restore 
later in this chapter.)

Disks area, and you can see the model information for two hard drives installed in the system. A quick search on the web 
shows the first hard drive is a magnetic HDD and the second hard drive is SSD.

Verify Scheduled Drive Maintenance
To verify that Windows 8/7/Vista is defragmenting a magnetic drive and not defragmenting  
a solid-state drive, do the following:

3.	 If the drive is more than 10 percent fragmented, click Optimize (Defragment now in 7/Vista) to defrag the 
drive immediately. The process can take a few minutes to several hours. If errors occur while the drive is 
defragmenting, check the hard drive for errors and try to defragment again.
	
You can also use the defrag command to defrag a drive from a command prompt window.
OS Differences Windows 8 can optimize an SSD to release unused space to reduce the number of write 
operations to the drive. Windows 7/Vista does not support optimizing an SSD. To optimize an SSD in Windows 8, 
select the drive in the Optimize Drives window and click Optimize.
A+

1.	 Use Explorer to open the Properties box for a drive and click the Tools tab (see the left side of 
Figure 10-5), and then click Optimize (or Defragment now in 7/Vista). In the Optimize Drives box (Disk 
Defragmenter in 7/Vista), as shown on the right side of Figure 10-5, verify the defrag settings. This system 
has two hard drives installed. Drive C: is an SSD and drive D: is a magnetic HDD. To have Windows tell you if 
a drive needs defragmenting, select a drive and click Analyze (Analyze disk in 7/Vista).
2.	 In Figure 10-5, you can see optimization is turned off. To turn it on for drive D:, select the drive and click 
Turn on. In the box that appears, which is showing in the bottom of the figure, check Run on a schedule 
(recommended) and select Weekly for the Frequency. Click OK.

Schedule Preventive Maintenance
10
Check the Hard Drive for Errors
Next, to make sure the drive is healthy, you need to search for and repair file system errors. The error-checking 
utility searches for bad sectors on a volume and recovers the data from them if possible. It then marks the 
sector as bad so that it will not be reused.
To use the error-checking utility in Explorer, right-click the drive, and select Properties from the shortcut 
menu. Click the Tools tab, and then click Check (Check now in 7/Vista). In the Error-checking dialog box, 
click Scan drive. (In 7/Vista, check Automatically fix file system errors and Scan for and attempt recovery 
of bad sectors in the Check Disk dialog box, and then click Start.) For the utility to correct errors on the 
drive, it needs exclusive use of all files on the drive. When Windows has exclusive use, the drive is called a 
locked drive. Therefore, a dialog box appears telling you about the problem and asking your permission to 
scan the drive the next time Windows starts. Reboot the system and let her rip.
You can also use the chkdsk command from the command prompt window to check a drive for errors.
Free up Space on the Drive
To free up some space on the hard drive, consider these tips:
	 Uninstall software you no longer use. Doing so will free up some space on the hard drive, and, if the 
software loads a service or program during Windows startup, Windows startup might see performance 
improvement.
	 Move data off the drive. Consider moving home videos, movies, photos, and other data to an external 
hard drive or burning them to DVDs or CDs, or transfer them to an online storage service such as 
Microsoft’s OneDrive or Google’s Drive.
	 Move programs off the drive. If your Windows volume needs more free space, you can uninstall a pro-
gram and reinstall it on a second hard drive installed in the system. An installation routine usually gives 
you the option to point to another location to install the program other than the default C:\Program 
Files or C:\Program Files (x86) folder.
	 Use drive or folder compression. Windows offers drive and folder compression that can save on hard 
drive space. However, it is not recommended that you compress the volume on which Windows is 
stored. To compress a folder or file on an NTFS drive, open the file or folder Properties box, and click 
Advanced on the General tab. Then click Compress contents to save disk space, and click OK.
Move the Virtual Memory Paging File
Windows uses a file, Pagefile.sys, in the same way it uses memory. This file is called virtual memory and 
is used to enhance the amount of RAM in a system. Normally, the file, pagefile.sys, is a hidden file stored 
in the root directory of drive C:. To save space on drive C:, you can move Pagefile.sys to another volume 
on the same hard drive or to a different hard drive, but don’t move it to a different hard drive unless you 
know the other hard drive is at least as fast as this drive. If the drive is at least as fast as the drive on which 
Windows is installed, performance should improve. Also, make sure the new volume has plenty of free 
space to hold the file—at least three times the amount of installed RAM.
Notes Windows installs on an NTFS volume, but if a second volume on the drive is formatted using the FAT32 file 
system, you can convert the volume to NTFS. For large drives, NTFS is more efficient and converting might improve 
performance. NTFS also offers better security and file and folder compression. For two Microsoft Knowledge Base articles 
about converting from FAT to NTFS, go to support.microsoft.com and search for articles 156560 and 314097. The first article  
discusses the amount of free space you’ll need to make the conversion, and the second article tells you how to convert.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know how to configure virtual memory for optimal performance.

Backup Procedures
10
Now let’s look at how to perform on-demand backups and to schedule routine backups.
Backup Procedures
A backup is an extra copy of a data or software file that you can use if the original file 
becomes damaged or destroyed. Losing data due to system failure, a virus, file corruption, or 
some other problem really makes you appreciate the importance of having backups.
A+  
220-902 
1.1, 1.4, 
1.5, 1.7, 
3.3
Notes With data and software, here’s a good rule of thumb: If you can’t get along without it, back it up.
4.	 Click OK. Windows informs you that you must restart the system for the change to take effect. Click OK to 
close the warning box.
5.	 Click Apply and close all boxes. Then restart the system.
If you still don’t have enough free space on the Windows volume, consider adding a second hard drive to the 
system. In fact, if you install a second hard drive that is faster than the Windows hard drive, know that reinstalling 
Windows on the faster hard drive will improve performance. You can then use the slower and older hard drive for data.
Notes If the Windows system is still slow and sluggish, know that later in the course you’ll learn more about 
how to optimize Windows so it performs better.
Perform Routine Maintenance
Sign in to  a Windows 8 or Windows 7 system using a Standard user account. Step through the process 
described in the chapter to do the following routine maintenance. As you work, note which chores you 
cannot perform unless you know the password to an administrator account. Do the following:
1.	 Verify critical Windows settings in Windows Update, anti-malware software, and the Network and Sharing Center.
2.	 Use the Disk Cleanup utility to clean up the hard drive.
3.	 Find out the brand and model of the hard drive that holds Windows. What is the brand and model? Is the 
drive a magnetic or solid-state drive? How do you know?
4.	 Check defrag settings and change them as necessary. Analyze the hard drive and determine if it needs 
defragmenting or optimizing. If so, optimize the drive.
5.	 Check the hard drive for errors.
6.	 Compress the My Documents folder.

Backups Pay Off
Dave was well on his way to building a successful career as an IT repair technician. His PC repair shop was doing 
well, and he was excited about his future. But one bad decision changed everything. He was called to repair a server 
at a small accounting firm. The call was on the weekend when he was normally off, so he was in a hurry to get the 
job done. He arrived at the accounting firm and saw that the problem was an easy one to fix, so he decided not to 
do a backup before working on the system. During his repairs, the hard drive crashed and all data on the drive was 
lost—four million dollars’ worth! The firm sued, Dave’s business license was stripped, and he was ordered to pay the 
money the company lost. A little extra time to back up the system would have saved his whole future. True story!
Applying  Concepts
Because most of us routinely write data to the hard drive, in this section, we focus on backing up from 
the hard drive to another media. However, when you store important data on any media—such as a flash 
drive, external hard drive, or CD—always keep a copy of the data on another media. Never trust important 
data to only one media.
In this part of the chapter, you learn how to make a disaster recovery plan and then learn how to use 
Windows to back up user data, critical Windows system files, and entire volumes.
Planning for Disaster Recovery
The time to prepare for disaster is before it occurs. If you have not prepared, the damage from 
a disaster will most likely be greater than if you had made and followed disaster recovery 
plans. Suppose the hard drive on your computer stopped working and you lost all its data. 
What would be the impact? Are you prepared for this to happen? Here are decisions you need 
to make for your backup and recovery plans:
	 Decide on the backup destination. For example, options include online backup, network drive, CD, DVD, 
Blu-ray, SD card, USB flash drive, external hard drive, or other media. Here are points to keep in mind:
	 For individuals or small organizations, an online backup service such as Carbonite (carbonite.com) or 
Mozy (mozy.com) is the easiest, most reliable, and most expensive solution. You pay a yearly subscription 
for the service, and they guarantee your backups, which are automatically done when your computer is 
connected to the Internet. If you decide to use one of these services, be sure to restore files from backup 
occasionally to make sure your backups are happening as you expect and that you can recover a lost file.
	 Even though it’s easy to do, don’t make the mistake of backing up your data to another volume or 
folder on your same hard drive. When a hard drive crashes, most likely all volumes go down together 
and you will have lost your data and your backup. Back up to another media and, for extra safety, 
store it at an off-site location.
	 Decide on the backup software. Windows offers a backup utility. However, you can purchase third-party 
backup software that might offer more features. An external hard drive often comes with backup soft-
ware already installed on the drive. However, before you decide to use an all-in-one backup system, be 
certain you understand the risks of not keeping backups at an off-site location and keeping all your 
backups on a single media.
	 Decide how simple or complex your backup strategy needs to be. A backup and recovery plan for indi-
viduals or small organizations might be very simple. But large organizations might require backups be 
documented each day, scheduled at certain times of the day or night, and recovery plans tested on a reg-
ular basis. Know the requirements of your organization when creating a backup and recovery plan. As a 
general rule of thumb, back up data for about every 4 to 6 hours of data entry. This might mean a 
backup needs to occur twice a day, daily, weekly, or monthly. Find out the data entry habits of workers 
before making your backup schedule and deciding on the folders or volumes to back up.

Backup Procedures
10
After you have a backup plan working, test the recovery plan. In addition, you need to occasionally 
retest the recovery plan to make sure all is still working as you expect. Do the following:
	 Test the recovery process. Erase a file on the hard drive, and use the recovery procedures to verify that 
you can re-create the file from the backup. This verifies that the backup medium works, that the recov-
ery software is effective, and that you know how to use it. After you are convinced that the recovery 
works, document how to perform it.
	 Keep backups in a safe place and routinely test them. Don’t leave a backup disk lying around for some-
one to steal. Backups of important and sensitive data should be kept under lock and key at an off-site 
location. In case of fire, keep enough backups off-site so that you can recover data even if the entire 
building is destroyed. Routinely verify that your backups are good by performing a test recovery of a 
backed-up file or folder. Backups are useless if the data on the backup is corrupted.
Now let’s see how to back up user data, important Windows system files, and the entire Windows 
volume. We begin with how to back up user data.
Back up User Data with Windows 8 File History
Windows 8 File History backs up user data stored in several locations, including Windows 
8 libraries, user desktop, Internet Explorer favorites, contact folders, and offline OneDrive 
files (for Microsoft accounts). When the backup is enabled, it first makes a full backup to 
another media. By default, it scans for file and folder changes every hour and keeps as many 
generations of backups as it has free space on the storage device.
The File History utility is available as a window on the Windows desktop or an app in the Windows 8 
interface. For most control over the utility, use the window on the desktop. Follow these steps:
1. First connect your backup device. Open Control Panel in Classic view, and then click File History. 
Figure 10-8 shows a File History window that recognizes a drive to hold the backups. The drive in 
the figure is an external hard drive with plenty of free space. To turn on File History, click Turn on.

2. To manage these backups, click Advanced settings. On the Advanced Settings window, you can set 
how often backups are made (every 10 minutes up to daily) and how long old backups should be kept 
(forever, until space is needed, 1 month, 1 year, and so forth). You can also view a history of events and 
clean up old backups to free up space.
Use File History to Recover a Corrupted or Lost File or Folder
To recover items from File History backups, in the File History window, click Restore personal files. In the 
window that appears (see Figure 10-9), use the left and right arrow keys on either side of the green button 
at the bottom of the window to select a backup and drill down into a backup to find the file or folder you 
need. Select an item to see a preview, and then click the green Restore button at the bottom of the window 
to restore it. If you prefer to save the previous version in a different location so as not to lose the newest 
version of that file, right-click the Restore button, and click Restore to. Navigate to the location where you 
want to save the previous version, and then click Select Folder.
Figure 10-9  Drill down into backups to find what you want to restore
Notes To open File History in the Windows 8 interface, open the Settings charm and click Change PC settings. In 
the PC settings pane, click Update and recovery and then click File History.
Use Windows 7 Backup and Restore
Using Windows 7 Backup and Restore, you can create a backup schedule that can include any folder 
on the hard drive and the system image. The system image is a backup of the entire volume where 
Windows 7 is installed. The folders and volume are first backed up entirely (called a full backup). 
Then on the schedule you set, any file or folder is backed up that has changed or been created since 
the last backup (called an incremental backup). Occasionally, Windows does another full backup.

Maintaining Windows
Notes Windows 7 Professional, Ultimate, and Enterprise editions allow you to save the backup to a network 
location. To use a shared folder on the network for the backup destination, click Save on a network (see Figure 10-11). 
In the resulting box, click Browse and point to the folder. Also enter the user name and password on the remote 
computer that the backup utility will use to authenticate to that computer when it makes the backup. You cannot save 
to a network location when using Windows 7 Home editions. For these editions, the button Save on a network is missing 
in the window where you select the backup destination.
Recover Backed-up Items
To recover backed-up items, open the Windows 7 Backup and Restore window and scroll down to the bottom 
of the window and click Restore my files. The Restore Files box appears (see Figure 10-12). Note that if the 
Restore my files button is missing from the Backup and Restore window, your backup media might not be available 
to Windows. You might need to plug in the media and then use Windows Explorer to verify you can access 
the backup folder on the media.
Notes After Windows does a full backup, it only backs up files that have changed since the last full backup. 
Occasionally, it does another full backup. Each full backup is called a backup period. It keeps as many backup 
periods as it has space on the backup media. As the media fills, it deletes the oldest backup periods. To see 
how space is used on your backup media, click Manage space in the Backup and Restore window. In the Manage 
Windows Backup disk space, you can click View backups to delete a backup period, but be sure to keep the most 
recent backup periods.
Notes One limitation of Windows Backup and Restore is that you can have only one scheduled backup routine.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know what a shadow copy is.
3.	 In the next box, you can allow Windows to decide what to back up or decide to choose for yourself. Select 
Let me choose so that you can select the folders to back up. Click Next.
4.	 In the next box, select the libraries and folders you want to back up. Click the white triangle beside Local Disk 
(C:) to drill down to any folder on the hard drive for backup. Check folders or libraries to back up. If the backup 
media can hold the system image, the option to include the image is selected by default. If you don’t want to 
include the image, uncheck it. Click Next to continue. Here are folders that might contain important user data:
	 Application data is usually found in C:\Users\username\AppData.
	 Internet Explorer favorites are in C:\Users\username\Favorites.
	 Better still, back up the entire user profile at C:\Users\username.
	 Even better, back up all user profiles at C:\Users.
5.	 In the next box, verify the correct folders and libraries are selected. To change the default schedule, click 
Change schedule. In the next box, you can choose to run the backup daily, weekly, or monthly and select 
the time of day. Make your selections, and click OK.
6.	 Review your backup settings, and click Save settings and run backup. The backup proceeds. A shadow copy 
is made of any open files so that files that are currently open are included in the backup.
Later, you can return to the Backup and Restore window to change the backup settings or to turn off the 
backup.

Use one of the three buttons on the 
window to locate the file or folder. Search 
allows you to search for a file or folder when 
you only know part of the file name or folder 
name. Browse for files allows you to drill 
down to the file to restore. Browse for folders 
allows you to search for the folder to restore. 
You can locate and select multiple files or 
folders to restore. Then follow the directions 
on screen to restore all the selected items.
To restore a folder or file to a previous 
version, follow these steps:
1.	 Use Windows Explorer to copy—not 
move—the corrupted folder or file 
to a new location. When you restore 
a file or folder to a previous version, 
the current file or folder can be 
overwritten by the previous version. 
By saving a copy of the current file or 
folder to a different location, you can 
revert to the copy if necessary.
2.	 Right-click the file or folder and select 
Restore previous versions from the 
shortcut menu. The Properties box 
for the file or folder appears with 
the Previous Versions tab selected. 
Windows displays a list of all previous 
versions of the file or folder it has 
kept (see Figure 10-13).
3.	 Select the version you want and click 
Restore. A message box asks if you 
are sure you want to continue. Click 
Restore, and then click OK.
4.	 Open the restored file or folder and 
verify it is the version you want. If 
you decide you need another version, 
delete the file or folder, and copy the 
file or folder you saved in Step 1 back 
into the original location. Then return 
to Step 2 and try again, this time 
selecting a different previous version.

Make Sure System Protection Is Turned On
To make sure System Protection has not been turned off, open the System window, and click System 
protection. The System Protection tab of the System Properties box appears (see the left side of Figure 10-14). 
Make sure protection is turned on for the drive containing Windows, which indicates that restore points are 
created automatically. In Figure 10-14, protection for drive C: is on and other drives are not being protected. 
To make a change, click Configure. The System Protection box on the right side of the figure appears. If you 
make a change to this box, click Apply, and then click OK.
Figure 10-14  Make sure System Protection is turned on for the volume on which Windows is installed
Restore points are normally kept in the folder C:\System Volume Information, which is not accessible to 
the user. Restore points are taken at least every 24 hours, and they can use up to 15 percent of disk space. 
If disk space gets very low, restore points are no longer made, which is one more good reason to keep 
about 15 percent or more of the hard drive free.
Manually Create a Restore Point
To manually create a restore point, use the System Protection tab of the System Properties box, as shown 
on the left side of Figure 10-14. Click Create. In the System Protection box, enter a name for the restore 
point, such as “Before I tested software,” and click Create. The restore point is created.
Back up Windows System Files
The Windows System Protection utility automatically backs up system files and stores them 
on the hard drive at regular intervals and just before you install software or hardware. These 
snapshots of the system are called restore points and include Windows system files that have 
changed since the last restore point was made. A restore point does not contain all user data, 
and you can manually create a restore point at any time.

Apply a Restore Point
System Restore (rstrui.exe) restores the system to its condition at the time a restore point was made. If you 
restore the system to a previous restore point, user data on the hard drive will not be altered, but you can 
affect installed software and hardware, user settings, and OS configuration settings. When you use System 
Restore to roll back the system to a restore point, any changes made to these settings after the restore point 
was created are lost; therefore, always use the most recent restore point that can fix the problem so that 
you make the least intrusive changes to the system.
To return the system to a previous restore point and to practice opening a utility from the command 
prompt, do the following:
1. Click Start, type rstrui.exe in the Search box, and press Enter. The System Restore box opens. 
Click Next.
2. In the next box, the most recent restore points appear. For most situations, the most recent is the one to 
select so as to make the least possible changes to your system. Select a restore point (see Figure 10-15), 
and click Next.
3. Windows asks you to confirm your selection. Click Finish and respond to the warning box. The system 
restarts and the restore point is applied.

Points to Remember about System Restore
System Restore is a great tool to try to fix a device that is not working, restore Windows settings that are 
giving problems, or solve problems with applications. Although it’s a great tool in some situations, it does 
have its limitations. Keep these points in mind:
	 Point 1: System Restore won’t help you if you don’t have restore points to use. System Protection 
must be turned on so that restore points are automatically created.
	 Point 2: Restore points replace certain keys in the registry but cannot completely rebuild a totally 
corrupted registry. Therefore, System Restore can recover from errors only if the registry is 
somewhat intact.

Maintaining Windows
	 Point 3: The restore process cannot remove a virus or worm infection. However, it might help you start 
a system that is infected with a virus that launches at startup. After Windows has started, you can then 
use anti-malware software to remove the infection.
	 Point 4: System Restore might create a new problem. Often when using a restore point, anti-malware soft-
ware gets all out of whack and sometimes even needs reinstalling. Therefore, use restore points sparingly.
	 Point 5: System Restore might make many changes to a system. If you know which change caused a 
problem, try to undo that particular change first. The idea is to use the least invasive solution first. 
For example, if updating a driver has caused a problem, first try Driver Rollback to undo that change. 
Driver Rollback is performed using Device Manager.
	 Point 6: Restore points are kept in a hidden folder on the hard drive. If that area of the drive is cor-
rupted, the restore points are lost. Also, if a user turns System Protection off, all restore points are lost.
	 Point 7: Viruses and other malware sometimes hide in restore points. To completely clean an infected 
system, you need to delete all restore points by turning System Protection off and back on.
	 Point 8: If Windows will not start, you can launch System Restore using startup recovery tools, which 
are covered in the chapter, “Troubleshooting Windows Startup.”
And now moving on to backing up the entire Windows volume.
Windows 8 Custom Refresh Image
A custom refresh image is an image of the entire Windows volume, including the Windows 
installation, Windows 8 apps, desktop applications, and user settings and data. The best 
time to create the image is right after you’ve installed Windows, hardware, applications, and 
user accounts and customized Windows settings. The image is stored in a single file named 
CustomRefresh.wim in the folder you specify. The WIM file uses the Windows Imaging File (WIM) format, 
which is a compressed file that contains many related files.
Here are the steps to create a Windows 8 custom refresh image:
1. Open an elevated command prompt window. One way to do that is to press Win+X and click Command 
Prompt (Admin). Respond to the UAC box. The Administrator: Command Prompt window opens.
2. Enter this command, substituting any drive and folder for that shown in the command line (see Figure 10-16):

Recimg
command line
Creating the image takes some time and then the image and its location are registered as the active 
recovery image. The image is stored in a large file and you can view it using File Explorer (see Figure 10-17). 
You can create as many refresh images as you like, but only one is designated as the active recovery image, 
and it’s the one that will be used when you refresh the Windows 8 installation. How to perform a Windows 
refresh is covered in the chapter, “Troubleshooting Windows Startup.”
Figure 10-17  File Explorer shows the refresh image WIM file
The recimg command can also be used to manage refresh images. The parameters for the command are 
listed in Table 10-1.
Command

refresh image.
recimg /showcurrent
Displays the location of the active refresh image.
bcdedit /set {default}  
bootmenupolicy legacy
Deregisters the active recovery image. During the refresh process, 
Windows will not find an image and will revert to a hidden recovery 
partition on the hard drive or the Windows 8 setup files for the refresh.
recimg /setcurrent <path>
Registers a refresh image in the path given. The image at this 
location is now the active refresh image.

Caution
Before creating a system image on a laptop, plug the laptop into an AC outlet so that a failed battery 
will not interrupt the process.
Here are points to keep in mind when creating a system image and using it to recover a failed Windows volume:
	 A system image includes the entire drive C: or other drive on which Windows is installed. When you restore 
a hard drive using the system image, everything on the volume is deleted and replaced with the system image.
	 A system image must always be created on an internal or external hard drive. When scheduling the 
backup of your data folders, you can include the system image in the backup procedure. Even if the files and 
folders are being copied to a USB drive, CD, or DVD, the system image will always be copied to a hard drive.
	 Don’t depend just on the system image as your backup. You should also back up individual folders that contain 
user data. If individual data files or folders need to be recovered, you cannot rely on the system image because 
recovering data using the system image would totally replace the entire Windows volume with the system image.
	 You can create a system image any time after Windows is installed, and then you can use this image to 
recover from a failed hard drive. Using the system image to recover a failed hard drive is called reimaging the 
drive. The details of how to reimage the drive are covered later in the chapter “Troubleshooting Windows Startup.”
Notes The system image you create can be installed only on the computer that was used to create it. 
A hardware-independent image is called a standard image and was discussed in the chapter “Installing Windows.”

Managing Files, Folders, and Storage Devices

Managing Files, Folders, and Storage Devices
In this part of the chapter, you learn to manage files and folders on the hard drive and other 
storage devices using commands in a command prompt window and to manage hard drive 
partitions and volumes using the Disk Management utility. Let’s begin the discussion with how 
partitions and file systems work in Windows.
How Partitions and File Systems Work
Recall that a hard drive is organized using sectors, blocks, partitions, volumes, and file systems. 
Let’s see how it all works.
Sectors and Blocks
All data is stored on a magnetic hard drive in sectors, sometimes called records. Each sector on the drive is 
the same size, and for most hard drives, that size is 512 bytes. Sector markings used to organize the drive 
are done before it leaves the factory in a process called low-level formatting. The size of a sector and the 
total number of sectors on a drive determine the drive capacity. UEFI/BIOS and the OS can address groups 
of sectors on the drive in blocks, which is called Logical Block Addressing (LBA). SSD drives don’t use 
sectors; space on an SSD drive is divided into blocks or LBAs that can be addressed by the UEFI/BIOS and 
OS. Today’s drive capacities are measured in GB (gigabytes, roughly one million bytes) or TB (terabytes, 
roughly one trillion bytes).

Notes For backward compatibility, Windows 8 allows you to create a system image. To do so, click System Image 
Backup in the File History window. However, a custom refresh image is more flexible and easier to use than a system image.
OS Differences Windows Vista uses different backup methods than Windows 8 or 7 to back up user data, system 
files, and the Windows volume. The backup of the Vista volume is called the Complete PC Backup.
Notes For magnetic hard drives, each platter is divided into concentric circles called tracks, and each track is divided 
into sectors (see Figure 10-19). Magnetic drive sectors are usually 512 bytes, but blocks on SSDs can be larger: 4 KB or 16 KB.

Maintaining Windows
	 GPT partitions. The Globally Unique Identifier Partition Table (GUID or GPT) system can support up 
to 128 partitions and is required for drives larger than 2 TB. Recall that GPT requires a 64-bit operating 
system and UEFI firmware enabled and is needed to use Secure Boot, a feature of UEFI and the OS. The 
GPT system does not use extended partitions or logical volumes, and the bootable partition is not called 
an active partition. Most new computers sold today use the GPT system.
	
The first sector in a GPT system contains the protective MBR. This protective MBR provides informa-
tion to legacy software that doesn’t recognize GPT systems. The protective MBR makes the drive appear 
to consist of a single MBR partition instead of the multiple GPT partitions that it might actually con-
tain, but this is sufficient to keep legacy software from assuming the drive is not yet partitioned or has a 
corrupted MBR system, which it might attempt to repair and, thus, destroy the GPT system. GPT tracks 
all partitions in a single partition table, which it stores in the GPT header immediately following the 
protective MBR. GPT systems also back up the partition table at the end of the disk (see Figure 10-21). 
On Windows systems, there can be up to 128 partitions in between the two GPT headers.
Partitions
A drive is further divided into one or more partitions using one of two partitioning systems:
	 MBR partitions. The Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system keeps a map of these partitions in 
a partition table stored in the very first sector on the hard drive called the MBR. Recall that the MBR 
system is required when a computer is using a 32-bit operating system, legacy BIOS, or UEFI in CSM 
mode. The MBR partition table can track up to four partitions on a drive. A drive can have one, two, or 
three primary partitions, also called volumes. The fourth partition is called an extended partition and 
can hold one or more volumes called logical drives, which are tracked in their own partition table 
separately from the primary partitions. Figure 10-20 shows how an MBR hard drive is divided into 
three primary partitions and one extended partition.

File System
Before a partition or drive can be used, it must be assigned a drive letter such as C: or D: and formatted 
using a file system. Recall that the file system is the overall structure an OS uses to name, store, and 
organize files on a drive. Windows 8 and Windows 7 support three types of file systems for hard drives: 
NTFS, FAT32, and exFAT. NTFS is the most reliable and secure and is used for the volume on which 
Windows is installed. Installing a drive letter, file system, and root directory on a volume is called 
formatting the drive, also called high-level formatting, and can happen during the Windows installation.
Here is a list of file systems supported by Windows that you can choose for volumes and drives that 
don’t hold the Windows installation:
	 NTFS. Choose the NTFS file system for hard drives because it uses smaller allocation units or cluster 
sizes than FAT32, which means it makes more efficient use of disk space when storing many small files. 
NTFS is more reliable; gives fewer errors; supports encryption, disk quotas (limiting the hard drive space 
available to a user), file and folder compression; and offers better security. As an example of the better 
security with NTFS, if you boot the system from another boot media such as a CD, you can access a 
volume using a FAT file system. If the volume uses NTFS, an administrator password is required to 
gain access.
	 ReFS. The latest file system by Microsoft is the Resilient File System (ReFS), designed to improve on the 
NTFS file system by offering better fault tolerance (eliminating the need for repairs using chkdsk) and 
allowing for better compatibility with virtualization and data redundancy in a RAID system. ReFS is not 
widely used on personal computers, but it is expected to eventually replace NTFS. The 64-bit version of 
Windows 8.1 supports ReFS.
Notes In most Microsoft documentation, a partition is called a partition until it is formatted with a file system, and 
then it is called a volume.

Maintaining Windows
	 exFAT. Choose the exFAT file system for large external storage devices that you want to use with other 
operating systems. For example, you can use a smart card formatted with exFAT in a Mac or Linux computer 
or in a digital camcorder, camera, or smart phone. exFAT uses the same structure as the older FAT32 file 
system, but with a 64-bit-wide file allocation table (FAT). exFAT does not use as much overhead as the NTFS 
file system and is designed to handle very large files, such as those used for multimedia storage.
	 FAT32. Use FAT32 for small hard drives or USB flash drives because it does not have as much overhead 
as NTFS.
	 CDFS and UDF. CDFS (Compact Disk File System) is an older file system used by optical discs (CDs, 
DVDs, and BDs), and is being replaced by the newer UDF (Universal Disk Format) file system.
How Partitions Are Used during the Boot
With MBR hard drives, one of the primary partitions is designated the active partition, which is the 
bootable partition that startup UEFI/BIOS turns to when searching for an operating system to start up. 
In GPT systems, this bootable partition is called the EFI System Partition (ESP), and UEFI turns to this 
partition to find and start the operating system. The OS program it looks for in this partition and starts is 
called the boot loader or boot manager.
In Windows, the MBR active partition or the ESP System Partition is called the system partition and, for 
Windows 8/7, the boot manager is named BootMgr (with no file extension). The boot manager turns to the 
volume that is designated the boot partition, where the Windows operating system is stored, and continues 
the process of starting Windows.
In Figure 10-22, you can see an example of an MBR hard drive in a two-drive system. In this computer, 
disk 0 is an SSD and disk 1 is a magnetic hard drive. The OS is stored on disk 0, which makes for a faster 
boot. On disk 0, the first partition is the System Reserved partition and is designated the active partition 
and the Windows system partition. The boot partition is drive C: where Windows is stored. Figure 10-23 
shows a GPT system that contains a single hard drive. It contains a recovery partition, the EFI System 
Partition, and drive C:, which is designated the boot partition and holds the Windows 8 installation.

Notes Don’t be confused by the terminology here. It is really true that, according to Windows terminology, the 
Windows OS is on the boot partition, and the boot manager is on the system partition, although that might seem backward. 
The computer starts or boots from the system partition and loads the Windows operating system from the boot partition.

Commands to Manage Files and Folders
IT support technicians find it is much faster to manipulate files and folders using commands 
in a command prompt window than when using File Explorer (or Windows Explorer in 
Windows 7). In addition, in some troubleshooting situations, you have no other option but to 
use a command prompt window. For Windows 8, to open the command prompt window, press 
Win+X and click Command Prompt. The command prompt window is shown in Figure 10-24.

OS Differences To get an elevated command prompt window in Windows 7, click Start, All Programs, Accessories, 
and right-click Command Prompt. Then select Run as administrator from the shortcut window and respond to the UAC box.
Here are some tips for working in a command prompt window:
	 Type cls and press Enter to clear the window.
	 To retrieve the last command you entered, press the up arrow. To retrieve the last command line one 
character at a time, press the right arrow.
	 To terminate a command before it is finished, press Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Break, or Ctrl+Pause.
	 To close the window, type exit (see Figure 10-25) and press Enter.
Windows has two levels of command prompt windows: a standard window and an elevated window. 
The standard window is shown in Figure 10-24, which shows the default directory is the currently 
signed-in user’s folder. Commands that require administrative privileges will not work from this standard 
command prompt window. To get an elevated command prompt window in Windows 8, press Win+X 
and click Command Prompt (Admin). After you respond to the User Account Control (UAC) box, the 
Administrator: Command Prompt window appears (see Figure 10-25). Notice the word Administrator 
in the title bar, which indicates the elevated window, and the default directory, which is the C:\Windows\
system32 folder.
Figure 10-25  An elevated command prompt window has administrative privileges
If the command you are using applies to files or folders, the path to these files or folders is assumed 
to be the default drive and directory. The default drive and directory, also called the current drive and 
directory, shows in the command prompt. It is the drive and directory that the command will use if you 
don’t give a drive and directory in the command line. For example, in Figure 10-24, the default drive is 
C: and the default path is C:\Users\Jill West. If you use a different path in the command line, the path you 
use overrides the default path. Also know that Windows makes no distinction between uppercase and 
lowercase in command lines (however, Linux does).
Notes Many of the commands you learn about in this section can also be used from the Windows Recovery 
Environment (Windows RE). Windows RE can be loaded from the Windows setup DVD to troubleshoot a system when 
Windows refuses to load. How to use the Recovery Environment is covered later in the text.
OS Differences To open the command prompt window in Windows 7, enter command or cmd in the Search box 
and press Enter. Alternately, you can click Start, All Programs, Accessories, and Command Prompt.

dir a*.???
In a command prompt window, if a path or file name has spaces in it, it is sometimes necessary to 
enclose the path or file name in double quotation marks.
Wildcard Characters in Command Lines
As you work at the command prompt, you can use wildcard characters in a file name to say that the 
command applies to a group of files or to abbreviate a file name if you do not know the entire name. 
The question mark (?) is a wildcard for one character, and the asterisk (*) is a wildcard for one or more 
characters. For example, if you want to find all files in a directory that start with A and have a three-letter 
file extension, you would use the following command:
Notes Many commands can use parameters in the command line to affect how the command will work. Parameters 
(also called options, arguments, or switches) often begin with a slash followed by a single character. In this chapter, 
you learn about the basic parameters used by a command for the most common tasks. For a full listing of the parameters 
available for a command, use the help command. Another way to learn about commands is to follow this link on the 
Microsoft website: technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772390(WS.10).aspx.

Now let’s look at the file-naming conventions you will need to follow when creating files, wildcard 
characters you can use in command lines, and several commands useful for managing files and folders.
file-naming Conventions
When using the command prompt window to create a file, keep in mind that file name and file extension 
characters can be the letters a through z, the numbers 0 through 9, and the following characters:
Help or <command name> /?
Use the help command to get help about any command. You can enter help followed by the command name 
or enter the command name followed by /?. Table 10-2 lists some sample applications of this command.

Dir [<filename>] [/p] [/s] [/w]
Use the dir command to list files and directories. In Microsoft documentation about a command (also 
called the command syntax), the brackets [ ] in a command line indicate the parameter is optional. In 
addition, the parameter included in < >, such as <filename>, indicates that you can substitute any file name 
in the command. This file name can include a path or file extension. Table 10-3 lists some examples of the 
dir command.

Table 10-3  Sample dir commands
Figure 10-26 shows the result of the dir command on the directory game. Note the two initial entries 
in the directory table: . (dot) and . . (dot, dot). The md command creates these two entries when the OS 
initially sets up the directory. You cannot edit these entries with normal OS commands, and they must 
remain in the directory for the directory’s lifetime. The . (dot) entry points to the subdirectory itself, and 
the .. (dot, dot) entry points to the parent directory, which, in this case, is the root directory.
Md [drive:] path
The md (make directory) command creates a subdirectory under a directory. Note that in the command 
lines in this section, the command prompt is not bolded, but the typed command is in bold. To create a 
directory named \game on drive C:, you can use this command:
C:\> md C:\game
The backslash indicates that the directory is under the root directory. If a path is not given, the default 
path is assumed. This command also creates the C:\game directory:
C:\> md game
To create a directory named chess under the \game directory, you can use this command:
C:\> md C:\game\chess

cd [drive:]path or cd..
The cd (change directory) command changes the current default directory. You enter cd followed by the 
drive and the entire path that you want to be current, like so:
C:\> cd C:\game\chess
The command prompt now looks like this:
C:\game\chess>
To move from a child directory to its parent directory, use the .. (dot, dot) variation of the command:
C:\game\chess> cd..
The command prompt now looks like this:
C:\game>
Remember that .. (dot, dot) always means the parent directory. You can move from a parent directory to 
one of its child directories simply by stating the name of the child directory:
C:\game> cd chess
C:\game\chess>
The command prompt now looks like this:
Remember not to put a backslash in front of the child directory name; doing so tells the OS to go to a 
directory named chess that is directly under the root directory.
rd [drive: ]path [/s]
The rd (remove directory) command removes a directory. Unless you use the /s switch, three things must be 
true before you can use the rd command:
	The directory must contain no files.
	The directory must contain no subdirectories.
	The directory must not be the current directory.
A directory is ready for removal when only the . (dot) and .. (dot, dot) entries are present. For example, to 
remove the \game directory when it contains the chess directory, the chess directory must first be removed, like so:
C:\> rd C:\game\chess
Or, if the \game directory is the current directory, you can use this command:
C:\game> rd chess
After you remove the chess directory, you can remove the game directory. However, it’s not good to attempt 
to saw off a branch while you’re sitting on it; therefore, you must first leave the \game directory like so:
C:\game> cd..
C:\> cd \game
When you use the /s switch with the rd command, the entire directory tree is deleted, including all its 
subdirectories and files.

del or erase <filename>
The del or erase command erases files or groups of files. Note that in the command lines in this section, the 
command prompt is not bolded, but the typed command is in bold.
To erase the file named Myfile.txt, use the following command:
E:\> del myfile.txt
To erase all files in the current default directory, use the following command:
E:\Docs> del *.*
To erase all files in the E:\Docs directory, use the following command:
C:\> erase e:\docs\*.*
A few files don’t have a file extension. To erase all files that are in the current directory and that have no 
file extensions, use the following command:
E:\Docs> del *.
ren <filename1> <filename2>
The ren (rename) command renames a file. <filename1> can include a path to the file, but <filename2> 
cannot. To rename Project.docx in the default directory to Project_Hold.docx:
E:\Docs> ren Project.docx Project_Hold.docx
To rename all .txt files to .doc files in the C:\Data folder:
ren C:\Data\*.txt *.doc
copy <source> [<destination>] [/v] [/y]
The copy command copies a single file or group of files. The original files are not altered. To copy a file 
from one drive to another, use a command similar to this one:
E:\> copy C:\Data\Myfile.txt E:\mydata\Newfile.txt
The drive, path, and file name of the source file immediately follow the copy command. The drive, path, 
and file name of the destination file follow the source file name. If you don’t specify the file name of the 
destination file, the OS assigns the file’s original name to this copy. If you omit the drive or path of the 
source or the destination, then the OS uses the current default drive and path.
To copy the file Myfile.txt from the root directory of drive C: to drive E:, use the following command:
C:\> copy myfile.txt E:
Because the command does not include a drive or path before the file name Myfile.txt, the OS assumes 
that the file is in the default drive and path. Also, because there is no destination file name specified, the file 
written to drive E: will be named Myfile.txt.
To copy all files in the C:\Docs directory to the USB flash drive designated drive E:, use the following 
command:
C:\> copy c:\docs\*.* E:
To make a backup file named System.bak of the System file in the \Windows\system32\config directory 
of the hard drive, use the following command:
C:\Windows\system32\config> copy system system.bak

If you use the copy command to duplicate multiple files, the files are assigned the names of the original files. 
When you duplicate multiple files, the destination portion of the command line cannot include a file name.
Here are two switches or parameters that are useful with the copy command:
	 /v. When the /v switch is used, the size of each new file is compared with the size of the original file. This 
slows down the copying, but verifies that the copy is done without errors.
	 /y. When the /y switch is used, a confirmation message does not appear asking you to confirm before 
overwriting a file.
recover <filename>
Use the recover command to attempt to recover a file when parts of the file are corrupted. The command is 
best used from the Windows Recovery Environment. To use it, you must specify the name of a single file in 
the command line, like so:
C:\Data> recover Myfile.txt
expand [/d] <source> [<destination>]
The expand command extracts files from compressed distribution files, which are often used to distribute 
files for software installations. Table 10-4 lists examples of the command.
xcopy <source> [<destination>] [/s] [/c] [/y] [/d:date]
The xcopy command is more powerful than the copy command. It follows the same general command-
source-destination format as the copy command, but it offers several more options. Table 10-5 shows some 
of these options.
Notes When trying to recover a corrupted file, you can sometimes use the copy command to copy the file to new 
media, such as from the hard drive to a USB drive. During the copying process, if the copy command reports a bad or miss-
ing sector, choose the option to ignore that sector. The copying process then continues to the next sector. The corrupted 
sector will be lost, but others can likely be recovered. The recover command can be used to accomplish the same thing.

robocopy <source> <destination> [/s] [/e] [/log:filename] [/log+:filename]

The robocopy (robust file copy) command is similar to the xcopy command. It offers more options than 
xcopy and is intended to replace xcopy. A few options for robocopy are listed in Table 10-6.
Chkdsk [drive:] [/f] [/r]
The chkdsk (check disk) command fixes file system errors and recovers data from bad sectors. Earlier in 
the chapter, you learned to check for errors using the drive properties box, which does so by launching 
the chkdsk command. Recall that a file is stored on the hard drive as a group of clusters. The FAT32 and 
exFAT file systems use a FAT (file allocation table) to keep a record of each cluster that belongs to a file. 
The NTFS file system uses a database to hold similar information called the master file table (MFT). In 
Figure 10-27, you can see that each cell in the FAT represents one cluster and contains a pointer to the next 
cluster in a file.

Used with the /f parameter, chkdsk searches for and fixes two types of file system errors made by the 
FAT or MFT:
	 Lost clusters (also called lost allocation units). Lost clusters are clusters that are marked as used clusters 
in the FAT or MFT, but the cluster does not belong to any file. In effect, the data in these clusters is lost.
	 Cross-linked clusters. Cross-linked clusters are clusters that are marked in the FAT or MFT as belonging 
to more than one file.
Used with the /r parameter, chkdsk checks for lost clusters and cross-linked clusters and also checks for 
bad sectors on the drive. The FAT and MFT keep a table of bad sectors that they normally do not use. 
However, over time, a sector might become unreliable. If chkdsk determines that a sector is unreliable, it 
attempts to recover the data from the sector and also marks the sector as bad so that the FAT or MFT will 
not use it again.
Used without any parameters, the chkdsk command only reports information about a drive and does not 
make any repairs.
In the following sample commands, the command prompt is not showing as the default drive and directory 
are not important. To check the hard drive for file system errors and repair them, use this command:
chkdsk C:/f
To redirect a report of the findings of the chkdsk command to a file that you can later print, use this 
command:
chkdsk C:>Myfile.txt
Use the /r parameter of the chkdsk command to fix file system errors and also examine each sector of the 
drive for bad sectors, like so:
chkdsk C:/r
If chkdsk finds data that it can recover, it asks you for permission to do so. If you give permission, it 
saves the recovered data in files that it stores in the root directory of the drive.
The chkdsk command will not fix anything unless the drive is locked, which means the drive has no 
open files. If you attempt to use chkdsk with the /f or /r parameter when files are open, chkdsk tells you of 
the problem and asks permission to schedule the run the next time Windows is restarted. Know that the 
process will take plenty of time. Keep in mind that you must use an elevated command prompt window to 
run chkdsk.
defrag [drive:] [/c]
The defrag command examines a magnetic hard drive for fragmented files (files written to a disk in 
noncontiguous clusters) and rewrites these files to the drive in contiguous clusters. You use this command 
to optimize a magnetic hard drive’s performance. Table 10-7 shows two examples of the command. Recall 
that it’s not a good idea to defrag solid-state storage devices such as an SSD, flash drive, or smart card. 
Doing so can shorten the life of the drive.
Notes Use either the /f or /r parameter with chkdsk, but not both. Using both parameters is redundant. For the 
most thorough check of a drive, use /r.
Notes The chkdsk command is also available from the Windows Recovery Environment.

The defrag command requires an elevated command prompt window in Windows. It is not available 
under the Windows Recovery Environment. Earlier in the chapter, you learned to defrag a drive using the 
Windows drive properties box.
format <drive:> [/v:label] [/q] [fs:<filesystem>]
You can format a hard drive or other storage device using Disk Management. In addition, you can use 
the format command from a command prompt window and from the Windows Recovery Environment. 
This high-level format installs a file system on the device and erases all data on the volume. Table 10-8 lists 
various sample uses of the format command.
Shutdown [/m \\COMPUTERNAME] [/i] [/r] [/s] [/f] [/t xx]
Use the shutdown command to shut down the local computer or a remote computer. You must be 
signed in with an administrator account to use this command. By default, the command gives users a 
30-second warning before shutdown. To shut down a remote computer on the network, you must have an 
administrator account on that computer and be signed on the local computer with that same account and 
password. Table 10-9 lists some shutdown commands.

Windows PowerShell
Windows PowerShell is designed to replace the command prompt utility for providing a command-line 
interface. Like the command prompt utility, users enter commands to be executed. Unlike the command 
prompt, Windows PowerShell processes objects, called cmdlets (pronounced “command-lets”), that have 
been built with the .NET Framework programming tools instead of processing the text in a command 
line in order to perform tasks. This means that when entering a command into PowerShell, the utility is 
essentially running a prebuilt program, similar to the batch file you just created and ran in Hands-On  
Project 10-3. Windows PowerShell contains thousands of cmdlets so that users don’t have to build their 
own. Technicians or programmers who program their own cmdlets can build customized objects using the 
pre-existing cmdlets as building blocks.
Let’s see how a few cmdlets work in PowerShell. The get-help cmdlet gives help about a cmdlet and the 
get-process cmdlet lists all processes running on a computer. Do the following to practice using these and 
other cmdlets:
1. To open Windows 8 PowerShell, press Win+X, click Run, type powershell in the Run box, and press 
Enter.
Use a Batch File
A file with a .bat file extension is called a batch file. You can use a batch file to execute a group of commands, 
sometimes called a script, from a command prompt. Do the following to learn to use a batch file:
1.	 Using a command prompt window, copy the files in your Documents folder (My Documents in Windows 7) to 
a folder named \Save on a USB flash drive. Don’t include subfolders in the copy.
2.	 Using Notepad, create a batch file named MyBatch.bat on the USB flash drive that contains the commands 
to do the following:
a.	 Create the C:\Data folder and a subfolder named C:\Data\Documents.
b.	 Copy all the files in your \Save folder to the C:\Data\Documents folder.
c.	 List the contents of the C:\Data\Documents folder.
3.	 Using a command prompt window, execute the MyBatch.bat file and fix any problems you see. What happens 
when you execute the batch file and the C:\Data\Documents folder already exists?
Hands-On  Project 10-3
2. Enter the command get-help get-process, which requests information (get-help) on the get-process 
cmdlet.
3. View a more detailed description of the get-process cmdlet with the command get-help get-process 
-detailed.
4. Generate a list of all the processes running on your computer by entering the cmdlet get-process.
5. To list all cmdlets installed on a system, enter the cmdlet get-command.
6. As you can see, get cmdlets provide information on the item requested, but don’t access the item itself. 
To start a program, use a start cmdlet instead. For example, to open Notepad, enter the cmdlet start-
process notepad.exe.
OS Differences In Windows 7, click Start, All Programs, Accessories, and Windows PowerShell. You might see 
other options in the Windows PowerShell folder, such as Windows PowerShell (x86), which is a 32-bit version of Windows 
PowerShell on 64-bit computers, or Windows PowerShell ISE, which is an administrator-level version of Windows 
PowerShell called the Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE). Click Windows PowerShell to open.

Maintaining Windows
Use Disk Management to Manage Hard Drives
The primary tool for managing hard drives is Disk Management. In the “Installing Windows” 
chapter, you learned how to install Windows on a new hard drive. This installation process 
initializes, partitions, and formats the drive. After Windows is installed, you can use Disk 
Management to install and manage drives. In this part of the chapter, you learn to use 
Disk Management to manage partitions on a drive, prepare a new drive for first use, mount a drive, 
use Windows dynamic disks, and troubleshoot problems with the hard drive.
Resize, Create, and Delete Partitions
Suppose you have installed Windows 8 on a hard drive and used all available space on the drive for the 
one partition. Now you want to split the partition into two partitions so you can install Windows 10 in 
a dual-boot installation with Windows 8. You can use Disk Management (diskmgmt.msc) to shrink the 
original partition, which frees up some space for the new Windows 10 partition. Follow these steps in 
Windows 8:
1. To open the Disk Management window, use one of these methods:
	 Press Win+X and click Disk Management.
	 Press Win+X, click Run, and enter diskmgmt.msc in the Run box.

Figure 10-28  Shrink a volume to make room for a new partition
2. The Disk Management window opens (see Figure 10-28). To shrink the existing partition, right-click 
in the partition space and select Shrink Volume from the shortcut menu (see Figure 10-28). The Shrink 
dialog box appears showing the amount of free space on the partition. Enter the amount in MB to 
shrink the partition, which cannot be more than the amount of free space so that no data on the parti-
tion will be lost. (For best performance, be sure to leave at least 15 percent free space on the disk.) Click 
Shrink. The disk now shows unallocated space.
OS Differences To open the Disk Management window in Windows 7, click Start, type Disk Management or 
diskmgmt.msc in the Search box, and press Enter.

Volume from the shortcut menu (see Figure 10-29). The New Simple Volume Wizard opens.
Figure 10-29  Use unallocated space to create a new partition
4. Follow the directions on screen to enter the size of the volume in MB and select a drive letter for the 
volume, a file system, and the size for each allocation unit (also called a cluster). It’s best to leave the 
cluster size at the default value. You can also decide to do a quick format. The partition is then created 
and formatted with the file system you chose.
Notice in Figure 10-28 the options on the shortcut menu for this MBR system where you can make the 
partition the active partition (the one UEFI/BIOS looks to for an OS), change the drive letter for a volume, 
format the volume (erases all data on the volume), extend the volume (increase the size of the volume), 
and shrink or delete the volume. An option that is not available for the particular volume and situation is 
grayed.
Prepare a Drive for First Use
When you install a new, second hard drive in a computer, use Disk Management to prepare the drive for 
use. This happens in a two-step process:

Maintaining Windows
Step 1: Initialize the Disk
When the disk is initialized, Windows identifies the disk as a basic disk. A basic disk is a single hard drive that 
works independently of other hard drives. When you first open Disk Management after you have installed a 
new hard drive, the Initialize Disk box automatically appears (see Figure 10-30). Select the partitioning system 
(MBR or GPT), and click OK. Disk Management now reports the hard drive as a Basic disk.
Step 2: Create a Volume and Format It with a File System
To create a new volume on a disk, right-click in the unallocated space, select New Simple Volume from the 
shortcut menu, and follow the directions on screen to select the size of the volume, assign a drive letter 
and name to the volume, and select the file system. When the process is finished, the drive is formatted and 
ready for use. When you open Explorer, you should see the new volume listed.
Figure 10-30  Use the Initialize Disk box to set up a partitioning system on new hard drives
How to Mount a Drive
A mounted drive is a volume that can be accessed by way of a folder on another volume so that the folder 
has more available space. A mounted drive is useful when a folder is on a volume that is too small to 
hold all the data you want in the folder. In Figure 10-31, the mounted drive gives the C:\Projects folder a 
capacity of 20 GB. The C:\Projects folder is called the mount point for the mounted drive.
Notes After installing a new hard drive, if you don’t see the Initialize Disk box when you first open Disk 
Management, right-click in the Disk area and select Initialize Disk from the shortcut menu. The box will appear.
Notes Recall you can use the diskpart command to convert an MBR disk to a GPT disk. However, all data on the disk 
is lost when you do the conversion. In the chapter “Troubleshooting Windows Startup,” you learn more about diskpart 
and other commands used to manage a hard drive.

1. Make sure the volume that is to host the mounted drive uses the NTFS file system. The folder on this 
volume, called the mount point, must be empty. You can also create the folder during the mount process. 
In this example, we are mounting a drive to the C:\Projects folder.
2. Using Disk Management, right-click in the unallocated space of a disk. In our example, we’re using Disk 
1 (the second hard drive). Select New Simple Volume from the shortcut menu. The New Simple Volume 
Wizard launches. Using the wizard, specify the amount of unallocated space you want to devote to the 
volume. (In our example, we are using 20 GB, although the resulting size of the C:\Projects folder will 
only show about 19 GB because of overhead.)
3. As you follow the wizard, the box shown on the left side of Figure 10-32 appears. Select Mount in the 
following empty NTFS folder, and then click Browse. In the Browse for Drive Path box that appears (see 
the right side of Figure 10-32), you can drill down to an existing folder or click New Folder to create a 
new folder on drive C:.

4. Complete the wizard by selecting a file system for the new volume and an Allocation unit size (the clus-
ter size). The volume is created and formatted.
5. To verify the drive is mounted, open Explorer and then open the Properties box for the folder. In our 
example, the Properties box for the C:\Projects folder is shown in the middle of Figure 10-33. Notice the

Properties box reports the folder type as a Mounted Volume. When you click Properties in the Properties 
box, the volume Properties box appears (see the right side of Figure 10-33). In this box, you can see the 
size of the volume, which is the size of the mounted volume, less overhead.

You can think of a mount point, such as C:\Projects, as a shortcut to a volume on a second hard drive. 
If you look closely at the left window in Figure 10-33, you can see the shortcut icon beside the Projects 
folder.
Windows Dynamic Disks
A basic disk works independently of other hard drives, but a dynamic disk can work with other hard drives 
to hold data. Volumes stored on dynamic disks are called dynamic volumes. Several dynamic disks can 
work together to collectively present a single dynamic volume to the system.
When dynamic disks work together, data to configure each hard drive is stored in a disk management 
database that resides in the last 1 MB of storage space on each hard drive. Note that Home editions of 
Windows do not support dynamic disks.
Here are three uses of dynamic disks:
	 For better reliability, you can configure a hard drive as a dynamic disk and allocate the space as a 
simple volume. This is the best reason to use dynamic disks and is a recommended best practice. Because 
of the way a dynamic disk works, the simple volume is considered more reliable than when it is stored 
on a basic disk. A volume that is stored on only one hard drive is called a simple volume.
	 You can implement dynamic disks on multiple hard drives to extend a volume across these drives 
(called spanning). This volume is called a spanned volume.
	 Dynamic disks can be used to piece data across multiple hard drives to improve performance. The 
technology to configure two or more hard drives to work together as an array of drives is called RAID 
(redundant array of inexpensive disks or redundant array of independent disks). Joining hard drives 
together to improve performance is called striping or RAID 0. The volume is called a striped volume (see 
Figure 10-34). When RAID is implemented in this way using Disk Management, it is called software 
RAID. A more reliable way of configuring RAID is to use UEFI/BIOS setup on a motherboard that 
supports RAID, which is called hardware RAID.

You can use Disk Management to convert two or more basic disks to dynamic disks. Then you can use 
unallocated space on these disks to create a simple, spanned, or striped volume. To convert a basic disk to 
dynamic, right-click the Disk area and select Convert to Dynamic Disk from the shortcut menu (see Figure 
10-35), and then right-click free space on the disk and select New Simple Volume, New Spanned Volume, or 
New Striped Volume from the shortcut menu. If you were to use spanning or striping in Figure 10-35, you 
could make Disk 1 and Disk 2 dynamic disks that hold a single volume. The size of the volume would be 
the sum of the space on both hard drives.

Now for some serious cautions about software RAID where you use Windows for spanning and striping: 
Microsoft warns that when Windows is used for software RAID, the risk of catastrophic failure increases 
and can lead to data loss. Microsoft suggests you only use Windows spanning or striping when you have 
no other option. In other words, spanning and striping in Windows aren’t very safe—to expand the size of 
a volume, use a mounted drive or use hardware RAID.

Use Disk Management to Troubleshoot Hard Drive Problems
Notice in Figure 10-35 that this system has three hard drives, Disk 0, Disk 1, and Disk 2, and information 
about the disks and volumes is shown in the window. When you are having a problem with a hard drive, 
it helps to know what the information in the Disk Management window means. Here are the drive and 
volume statuses you might see in this window:
	 Healthy. The healthy volume status shown in Figure 10-35 indicates that the volume is formatted with a 
file system and that the file system is working without errors.
	 Failed. A failed volume status indicates a problem with the hard drive or that the file system has become 
corrupted. To try to fix the problem, make sure the hard drive data cable and power cable are secure. 
Data on a failed volume is likely to be lost. For dynamic disks, if the disk status is Offline, try bringing 
the disk back online (how to do that is coming up later in this list).
	 Online. An online disk status indicates the disk has been sensed by Windows and can be accessed by 
either reading or writing to the disk.
	 Active. One volume on an MBR system will be marked as Active. This is the volume that startup BIOS 
looks to for an OS boot manager to load.
	 EFI System Partition. In GPT systems, one volume will be marked as the EFI System Partition. UEFI 
looks to this volume to find an OS boot manager to load an OS.
	 Unallocated. Space on the disk is marked as unallocated if it has not yet been partitioned.
	 Formatting. This volume status appears while a volume is being formatted.
	 Basic. When a hard drive is first sensed by Windows, it is assigned the Basic disk status. A basic disk can 
be partitioned and formatted as a stand-alone hard drive.
	 Dynamic. The following status indicators apply only to dynamic disks:
	 Offline. An offline disk status indicates a dynamic disk has become corrupted or is unavailable. The 
problem can be caused by a corrupted file system, loose drive cables, a failed hard drive, or another 
hardware problem. If you believe the problem is corrected, right-click the disk and select Reactivate 
Disk from the shortcut menu to bring the disk back online.
	Foreign drive. If you move a hard drive that has been configured as a dynamic disk on another 
computer to this computer, this computer will report the disk as a foreign drive. To fix the problem, 
you need to import the foreign drive. To do that, right-click the disk and select Import Foreign Disks 
from the shortcut menu. You should then be able to see the volumes on the disk.
	Healthy (At Risk). The dynamic disk can be accessed, but I/O errors have occurred. Try returning the 
disk to online status. If the volume status does not return to healthy, back up all data and replace the 
drive.
If you are still having problems with a hard drive, volume, or mounted drive, check Event Viewer for 
events about the drive that might have been recorded there. These events might help you understand 
the nature of the problem and what to do about it. How to use Event Viewer is covered in the chapter, 
“Optimizing Windows.”
Notes When Windows implements RAID, know that you cannot install an OS on a spanned or striped volume that 
uses software RAID. You can, however, install Windows on a hardware RAID drive.
Also, after you have converted a basic disk to a dynamic disk, you cannot revert it to a basic disk without losing all 
data on the drive.

Windows Storage Spaces
Storage Spaces is new with Windows 8 and is a potential replacement for traditional Windows 
software RAID. With Storage Spaces, you can create a storage pool using any number of 
internal or external backup drives that use interfaces such as SATA (Serial ATA), SAS (Serial 
Attached SCSI), or even USB. Then you create one or more virtual drives, called spaces, from 
this pool, which appear as normal drives in File Explorer. Drives used for Storage Spaces can be formatted 
with the NTFS or ReFS file system.

directed otherwise by your instructor. Click Next. Keep the default Dynamically allocated option, and click 
Next. Keep the default drive name and location, change the size to 4 GB, and then click Create. Click OK.
4.	 Start up the VM, sign in to Windows, and open Disk Management.
5.	 Use Disk Management to initialize the new disk and partition it. Create two partitions on the disk, one for-
matted using the NTFS file system and one using the FAT32 file system.
6.	 View the new volumes using File Explorer.
7.	 Create and save a snip of your screen showing the virtual machine with the new volumes created. Email the 
snip to your instructor.

Maintaining Windows
Storage Spaces is designed for resiliency, which resists data loss in the event of drive failure. The 
following storage options offer varying degrees of resiliency in Storage Spaces:
	 Simple. A simple storage space combines multiple physical drives into a single logical drive with no 
built-in data backup. This option offers no resiliency.
	 Two-way mirroring. A logical drive can be mirrored, which means the data is duplicated across multiple 
physical drives used to create the space.
	 Three-way mirroring. In three-way mirroring, data is stored in triplicate to provide additional resiliency 
against data loss, although this feature requires that at least five physical drives be used to create the 
storage pool.
	 Parity. To provide even greater resiliency, parity spaces maintain multiple copies of data (depending 
upon the configuration) plus parity checking, which is a way to check backed-up data for any loss and 
re-create compromised data through parity calculations.
A single storage pool can be divided into multiple spaces, and each space can be configured with different 
resiliency settings. As pool capacity is depleted, more drives can be added to increase the available space 
without reconfiguring the space. In fact, the space can be configured as if it has more virtual storage than the 
physical drives actually offer by using a feature called thin provisioning. For example, in Figure 10-37, you 
can see the total of storage spaces presented to users is 12 TB; however, the physical hard drive capacities 
add up to only 8 TB. As the space actually used approaches 8 TB, the administrator is prompted to add 
more physical storage to the pool, which can eventually meet the 12-TB maximum capacity.
To set up a system to use Storage Spaces, do the following:

1. Attach any drives to the computer that you intend to use for your storage pool. These can include SATA, 
SAS, or certain USB devices, and they do not have to match in capacity. All data on the storage drives 
will be lost during formatting, so be sure to back up anything important.
2. Open Control Panel and click Storage Spaces. Click Create a new pool and storage space. Respond to the 
UAC dialog box.
3. Any drives that are compatible with Storage Spaces will be listed. Select the drives to format. All data on 
the selected drives will be lost.

Schedule Preventive Maintenance
	 Regular preventive maintenance includes verifying Windows settings, cleaning up the hard drive, 
defragmenting the hard drive, checking the drive for errors, uninstalling unwanted software, and doing 
whatever else is necessary to free up enough space on the hard drive for Windows to perform well.
	 Windows stores user profiles in the C:\Users folder.
	 For best performance, allow at least 15 percent of free space on the Windows volume. The easiest way 
to clean up temporary files is to use the Disk Cleanup utility in the drive properties box.
	 You can defrag a magnetic hard drive by using the drive properties box or the defrag command. By 
default, Windows automatically defrags magnetic hard drives weekly.
	 Use the chkdsk utility to check the drive for errors and recover data. The utility can be accessed from a 
command prompt or the drive properties box.
	 Windows supports compressed (zipped) folders and NTFS folder and file compression. You can also 
compress an NTFS volume.

Maintaining Windows
	 Virtual memory uses hard drive space as memory to increase the total amount of memory available. 
Virtual memory is stored in a paging file named pagefile.sys. To save space on drive C:, you can move 
the file to another volume or hard drive.
Backup Procedures
	 You need a plan for disaster recovery in the event the hard drive fails. This plan needs to include routine 
backups of data and system files.
	 Windows 8 File History and Windows 7 Backup and Restore can be used to schedule routine backups of 
user data files. Backup and Restore can back up a system image and File History offers the same option 
for backward compatibility with Windows 7.
	 System Protection creates restore points, which include Windows system files that have changed since 
the last restore point was made.
	 A Windows 8 custom refresh image backs up the entire Windows volume. The best time to create the 
image is right after you’ve installed Windows, hardware, applications, and user accounts and customized 
Windows settings.
Managing Files, Folders, and Storage Devices
	 A hard drive is divided into sectors (for magnetic hard drives only), blocks, and partitions. Each partition 
is formatted with a file system.
	 The MBR partitioning system requires legacy BIOS and can support only three primary partitions 
and one extended partition.
	 The GPT partitioning system requires UEFI and a 64-bit OS. It can support up to 128 partitions, Secure 
Boot, and hard drives larger than 2 TB.
	 Commands useful to manage files, folders, and storage media include help, dir, del, ren, copy, recover, 
expand, xcopy, robocopy, md, cd, rd, chkdsk, defrag, and format.
	 Use Disk Management to manage hard drives and partitions. Use it to create, delete, and resize parti-
tions, mount a drive, manage dynamic disks, and solve problems with hard drives.
	 Windows 8 Storage Spaces is expected to replace the Windows solution for software RAID and can 
support thin provisioning, which allows for physical hard drives to be added to the storage pool as need 
demands.

Real Problem 10-1 Researching the WinSxS Folder
While cleaning up a hard drive, you begin to look for folders that are excessively large and discover the 
C:\Windows\WinSxS folder is more than 7 GB. That’s almost half the size of the entire C:\Windows folder 
on this drive. Use the web to research the purpose of the WinSxS folder. What goes in this folder and how 
does it get there? How can the size of the folder be reduced without causing major trouble with the OS? 
Write a brief one-page paper about this folder and cite at least three articles you find on the web about it.
Real Problem 10-2 Cleaning Up a Sluggish Windows System
Do you have a Windows system that is slow and needs optimizing? If not, talk with family and friends and 
try to find a slow system that can use your help. Using all the tools and techniques presented in this chapter, 
clean up this sluggish Windows system. Take detailed notes as you go, listing what you checked before you 
started to solve the problems, describing what you did to solve the problems, and describing  the results of 
your efforts. What questions did you have along the way? Bring these questions to class for discussion.
Real Problem 10-3 Creating a Virtual Hard Drive
You can use the Disk Management tool or the diskpart command to create a Virtual Hard Drive (VHD) 
on a physical computer. The VHD is a file that takes up some free space on the physical hard drive, but to 
Windows it appears as a second hard drive. You can store data in folders and files on the VHD and even 
install Windows in the VHD. Follow these steps to create a VHD:
	 1.	 In Disk Management, click Action in the menu bar and click Create VHD. Follow directions on 
screen to create the VHD, specifying its location on the hard drive and its size. You can make the size 
dynamically expanding. The VHD is listed as a Disk in the Disk Management window.
	 2.	 Right-click the new disk and click Initialize Disk. Use the GPT partitioning system for the disk.
	 3.	 To format the disk, right-click the unallocated space on the disk and click New Simple Volume. The 
VHD is now ready for use and appears in File Explorer or Windows Explorer as a new volume.
Discuss in your class and research online how a VHD might be useful. What are two uses of a VHD, in 
which a VHD offers advantages over using a physical hard drive?

n the chapter, “Maintaining Windows,” you learned about the tools 
and strategies to maintain Windows and about the importance of 
keeping good backups. This chapter takes you one step further as an 
IT support technician so that you can get the best performance out 
of Windows. We begin the chapter learning about the Windows tools 
you’ll need to optimize Windows. Then we turn our attention to the 
steps you can follow to cause a sluggish Windows system to perform 
at its best and how to manually remove software that does not unin-
stall using ­normal methods. As you read the chapter, you might con-
sider ­following along using a Windows 8 or Windows 7 system.
Notes Windows installed in a virtual machine is an excellent environment to use 
when practicing the skills in this chapter.

Windows Utilities and Tools to Support the OS
Knowledge is power when it comes to supporting Windows. In this part of the chapter, you 
learn more about how Windows works and to use some Windows tools to poke around 
under the hood to see what is really happening that is slowing Windows down or giving other 
problems.
What ARE the Shell and the Kernel?
It might sound like we’re talking about a grain of wheat, but Windows has a shell and a kernel 
and you need to understand what they are and how they work so you can solve problems with 
each. A shell is the portion of an OS that relates to the user and to applications. The kernel 
is responsible for interacting with hardware. Figure 11-1 shows how the shell and kernel 
relate to users, applications, and hardware. In addition, the figure shows a third component of an OS, the 
configuration data. For Windows, this data is primarily contained in the registry.

The Windows Shell
The shell provides tools such as File Explorer or the Windows desktop as a way for the user to do such 
things as select music to burn to a CD or launch an application. For applications, the shell provides 
commands and procedures that applications can call on to do such things as print a document, read from a 
storage device, or display a photograph on screen.

The shell is made up of several subsystems that all operate in user mode, which means these subsystems 
have only limited access to system information and can access hardware only through other OS services. One 
of these subsystems, the Win32 security subsystem, provides sign-in to the system and other security functions, 
including privileges for file access. All applications relate to Windows by way of the Win32 subsystem.
The Windows Kernel
The kernel, or core, of the OS is responsible for interacting with hardware. Because the kernel operates in 
kernel mode, it has more power to communicate with hardware devices than the shell has. Applications 
operating under the OS cannot get to hardware devices without the shell passing those requests to the 
kernel. This separation of tasks provides for a more stable system and helps to prevent a wayward 
application from destabilizing the system.
The kernel has two main components: (1) the HAL (hardware abstraction layer), which is the layer closest to the 
hardware, and (2) the executive services interface, which is a group of services that operate in kernel mode between 
the user mode subsystems and the HAL. Executive services contained in the ntoskrnl.exe program file manage 
memory, I/O devices, file systems, some security, and other key components directly or by way of device drivers.
When Windows is first installed, it builds the HAL based on the type of CPU installed. The HAL cannot 
be moved from one computer to another, which is one reason you cannot copy a Windows installation 
from one computer to another.
How Windows Manages Applications
When an application is first installed, its program files are normally stored on the hard drive. When 
the application is launched, the program is copied from the hard drive into memory and there it is 
called a process. A process is a program that is running under the authority of the shell, together 
with the system resources assigned to it. System resources might include other programs it has started 
and memory addresses to hold its data. When the process makes a request for resources, this request is made to 
the Win32 subsystem and is called a thread. A thread is a single task, such as the task of printing a file that the 
process requests from the kernel. Figure 11-2 shows two threads in action, which is possible because the process 
and Windows support multithreading. Sometimes a process is called an instance, such as when you say to a user, 
“Open two instances of Internet Explorer.” Technically, you are saying to open two Internet Explorer processes.

Optimizing Windows
Now that you are familiar with the concepts of how Windows works, let’s see how to use some tools 
that can help us manage Windows components and processes.
Task Manager
Task Manager (taskmgr.exe) lets you view the applications and processes running on your 
computer as well as information about process and memory performance, network activity, 
and user activity. Several ways to access Task Manager are:
	Press Ctrl+Alt+Del. Depending on your system, the security screen (see Figure 11-3) or Task Manager 
appears. If the security screen appears, click Task Manager. This method works well when the system 
has a problem and is frozen.
	Right-click a blank area in the taskbar on the desktop, and select Task Manager in Windows 8 or Start 
Task Manager in Windows 7 from the shortcut menu.
	Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc.
	 For Windows 8, press Win+X and click Task Manager in the Quick Launch menu. For Windows 7, click 
Start, enter taskmgr.exe in the Search box, and press Enter.

Figure 11-3  Use the security screen to launch Task Manager
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know how to use Task Manager, System Configuration, Services 
console, Computer Management console, MMC, Event Viewer, Task Scheduler, Registry Editor, Performance Monitor, and 
Print Management. All these tools are covered in this part of the chapter.
Notes When working with a virtual machine, you cannot send the Ctrl+Alt+Del keystrokes to the guest operating 
system in the VM because these keystrokes are always sent to the host operating system. To send the Ctrl+Alt+Del 
keystrokes to a VM in Windows 8.1 Pro Client Hyper-V, click the Action menu in the VM window and click Ctrl+Alt+Delete 
(see Figure 11-4a). To send the Ctrl+Alt+Del keystrokes to a VM in Oracle VirtualBox, you must press a combination of 
keystrokes. To find out the keystrokes to manage a VM, with the VM window active, press Host+Home. In the menu that 
appears, point to Machine (see Figure 11-4b). As you can see in the figure, the keystroke combination is Host+Del.  
(By default, the Host key in VirtualBox is the right Ctrl key.)

OS Differences The Windows 7/Vista Task Manager window has six tabs: Applications, Processes, Services, 
Performance, Networking, and Users. The Applications tab of Task Manager (see Figure 11-7) is used to view a list of 
running processes. You can end a process that is not responding on this tab or end it on the Processes tab.
If you want to end the process and all 
related processes, on the Details tab, right-
click the process and select End Process 
Tree from the shortcut menu. Be careful to 
not end critical Windows processes; ending 
these might crash your system.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to understand the purposes of each tab in Task Manager for 
Windows 8 and Windows 7.
Notes If your desktop locks up, you 
can use Task Manager to refresh it. To do so, 
press Ctrl+Alt+Del and open Task Manager. 
Click the Processes tab. In the Windows 
processes group, select Windows Explorer 
and click Restart. (Yes, Windows 8 Task 
Manager really does call Explorer “Windows 
Explorer.”)
In Windows 7, on the Processes tab, 
select and end the explorer.exe process. 
Then click File in the menu bar and click 
New Task (Run). Enter Explorer.exe in the 
Create New Task box, and click OK. Your 
desktop will be refreshed and any running 
programs will still be open.

Click Open Resource Monitor on this tab to open the Resource Monitor, which monitors the CPU, hard 
drive, network, and memory in real time (see Figure 11-9). If you suspect CPU, memory, disk, or network 
resources are being used excessively by a process, you can use Resource Monitor to identify the process. 
Check for such a process if you suspect malware might be at work in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

Performance Tab
The Performance tab of Task Manager (see Figure 11-8) allows you to monitor performance of key devices 
in the system and network connections. For example, Figure 11-8 shows Memory selected where you can 
monitor how much RAM is currently used. When you select CPU, the Performance tab reports whether 
Hardware-assisted Virtualization is enabled.

App History Tab
The App history tab (see Figure 11-10) shows the resources that a program is using. For example, it’s  
useful when deciding if a live tile for an app on the Start screen is using up too many system resources as  
it provides live information on the tile. If you want to disable a live tile from updating itself, go to the Start 
screen, right-click the tile, and click Turn live tile off in the shortcut menu.
Figure 11-10  The App history tab can help you decide if a background program is hogging system 
resources
Startup Tab
The Startup tab of Task Manager in Windows 8 is used to manage startup items (see Figure 11-11). Click a 
white arrow to expand the items in a group. To disable a program from launching at startup, select it, and 
click Disable at the bottom of the window or in the shortcut menu. To see the program file location, right-
click it, and click Open file location, as shown in the figure.
OS Differences In Windows 7/Vista, the Performance tab of Task Manager monitors performance of the CPU and 
memory and also gives you access to the Resource Monitor. To monitor the performance of network connections, see the 
Networking tab of Task Manager. Alternately, you can use the Windows 7 Resource Monitor to monitor the performance 
of the CPU, memory, hard drive, and network connections.

Users Tab
The Users tab (see Figure 11-12) lists currently signed-in users and gives performance information that can 
help you identify processes started by a signed-in user that might be affecting overall system performance. 
Notice that the statuses of some programs on this tab are listed as Suspended. In Windows 8, if certain 
apps remain idle for a short time, they’re suspended so they don’t require the attention of the CPU. When 
the app is used again, it automatically comes out of suspension, and the CPU once again begins servicing it.

To disconnect a remote user from the system, select the user and click Disconnect at the bottom of the 
screen. To sign out a user who signed in at the workstation, select the user and click Sign out at the bottom 
of the screen.
Services Tab
The Services tab (see Figure 11-13) lists the services currently installed along with the status of each service. 
Recall that a service is a program that runs in the background and is called on by other programs to 
perform a background task. Running services are sometimes listed in the notification area of the taskbar. 
A problem with a service can sometimes be resolved by stopping and restarting the service. For example, 
stopping and restarting the Spooler service might solve a problem with print jobs not moving on to the 
printer. To stop or restart, right-click the service and use the shortcut menu, as shown in Figure 11-13. 
The Services console can also be used to manage services, and you can open the console by clicking Open 
Services at the bottom of the window. How to use this console is discussed later in the chapter.
Figure 11-13  The Services tab of Task Manager gives the current status of all installed services
Adjust the Priority Level of an Application
Each application running on your computer is assigned a priority level, which determines its position 
in the queue for CPU resources. You can use Task Manager to change the priority level for an appli-
cation that is already open. If an application performs slowly, increase its priority. You should only 
do this with very important applications, because giving an application higher priority than certain 
­background system processes can sometimes interfere with the operating system.

To use Task Manager to change the priority level of an open application, do the following:
1.	 In Task Manager, on the Processes tab, right-click the application and click Go to details.
2.	 On the Details tab, right-click the selected program and point to Set priority. Set the new priority to Above 
normal (see Figure 11-14). If that doesn’t give satisfactory performance, then try High.
Remember that any changes you make to an application’s priority level affect only the current session.
Figure 11-14  Change the priority level of a running application
OS Differences For Windows 7/Vista, to set the priority for a process, begin with the Applications tab. Right-
click the application and select Go To Process. On the Processes tab, right-click the selected process and point to 
Set Priority. You can then set the new priority.

Scheduler, and Performance Monitor. Later in the text, you learn to use more Administrative tools.
System Configuration
You can use the System Configuration (msconfig.exe) utility, which is commonly pronounced 
“M-S-config,” to temporarily disable programs from launching at startup in order to 
troubleshoot a startup problem. To open the System Configuration box, enter msconfig.exe in 
the Windows 8 Run box or in the Windows 7 Search box. The Windows 8 System Configuration 
box is shown in Figure 11-16 with the General tab selected.

Search box, click Start.
Caution
Don’t depend on System Configuration to be a permanent fix to disable a startup program or service. Once 
you’ve decided you want to make the change permanent, use other methods to permanently remove that process from 
Windows startup. For example, you might uninstall a program, remove it from a startup folder, or use the Services console 
to disable a service.

Perform a Clean Boot
System Configuration is useful when performing a clean boot of Windows, which starts Windows with 
a basic set of drivers and startup programs. By reducing the boot to essentials, you can sometimes 
identify and solve a problem with software conflicts, bad device drivers, or startup processes that cause 
slow performance.
Suppose, for example, you cannot install new software. Here’s how to perform a clean boot to verify other 
­software is not in conflict:
1.	 On the Services tab, check Hide all Microsoft services. The list now shows only services put there by third-
party software (see Figure 11-18). Click Disable all.

­window.
3.	 In the System Configuration box, click the General tab. Notice that Selective startup is now selected. Click 
Apply. Close the System Configuration box and restart Windows.
Now you can try again to install the software in a clean boot environment. If the problem is resolved, here’s 
how to return to a normal Windows startup:
1.	 Open the System Configuration box. On the General tab, click Normal startup. On the Services tab, uncheck 
Hide all Microsoft services. Verify that all services are now checked.
2.	 On the Startup tab, click Open Task Manager. In the Task Manager window, select each startup item and

Research Running Processes
Boot to the Windows desktop and then use Task Manager to get a list of all the running processes on your machine. Use 
the Windows Snipping Tool to save and print the Task Manager screens showing the list of processes. Next, perform a 
clean boot. Which processes that were loaded normally are not loaded when the system is running after a clean boot?
Hands-On  Project 11-1
Here’s how to use Windows 7 System Configuration to perform a clean boot:
1.	 Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Search box, and then press Enter.
2.	 In the System Configuration box on the Services tab, check Hide all Microsoft services and click Disable all. 
3.	 On the Startup tab (see Figure 11-20), click Disable all. Close System Configuration and restart the system.
Notes System Configuration reports only what it is programmed to look for when listing startup programs and 
services. It looks only in certain registry keys and startup folders, and sometimes does not report a startup process. 
Therefore, don’t consider its list of startup processes to be complete.
OS Differences Windows Vista uses the System Configuration utility to control startup programs just as does 
Windows 7. In addition, Vista offers Software Explorer, a user-friendly tool to control startup programs.

Computer Management
Computer Management (compmgmt.msc) contains several tools that can be used to manage 
the local computer or other computers on the network. The window is called a console 
because it consolidates several Windows Administrative tools. To use most of these tools, you 
must be signed in as an administrator, although you can view certain settings in Computer 
Management if you are signed in with lesser privileges.
As with most Windows tools, there are several ways to access Computer Management:
	 Enter compmgmt.msc in the Windows 8 Run box or the Windows 7 Search box.
	 For Windows 8, press Win+X and click Computer Management in the Quick Launch menu. For 
Windows 7, click Start, right-click Computer, and select Manage from the shortcut menu.
	 In Control Panel, look in the Administrative Tools group.
The Computer Management window is shown in Figure 11-22. Using this window, you can access Task 
Scheduler, Event Viewer, Shared Folders, Local Users and Groups, Performance Monitor, Device Manager, 
Disk Management, and the Services console. Several tools available from the Computer Management 
window are covered in this chapter.

Create a Console
If you find yourself often using a few Windows tools, consider putting them in a console stored on your 
desktop. Follow these steps to create a console:
1.	 Enter mmc.exe in the Windows 8 Run box or the Windows 7 Search box. Respond to the UAC box. 
An empty console window appears, as shown in Figure 11-23.

3.	 Select a snap-in from the list in the Add or Remove Snap-ins box. Notice a description of the snap-in appears 
at the bottom of the window. The snap-ins that appear in this list depend on the edition of Windows you 
have installed and what other components are installed on the system. Click Add to add the snap-in to the 
console.
4.	 If parameters for the snap-in need defining, a dialog box opens that allows you to set up these parameters. 
The dialog box offers different selections, depending on the snap-in being added. For example, when Device 
Manager is selected, a dialog box appears, asking you to select the computer that Device Manager will ­monitor 
(see the right side of Figure 11-24). Select Local computer (the computer this console is running on) and 
click Finish. The snap-in now appears in the list of snap-ins for this console.
Notes A program that can work as a snap-in under the MMC has an .msc file extension.

Event Viewer
Just about anything that happens in Windows is logged by Windows, and these logs can be 
viewed using Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc). You can find events such as a hardware or network 
failure, OS error messages, a device or service that has failed to start, or General Protection 
Faults, which can cause Windows to lock up or hang.
Event Viewer is a Computer Management console snap-in, and you can open it by using the Computer 
Management window, by entering Event Viewer or Eventvwr.msc in the Windows 8 Run box or the 
Windows 7 Search box, or by using the Administrative Tools group in Control Panel. The Event Viewer 
window is shown in Figure 11-25.

Add or Remove Snap-ins box.
6.	 To save the console, click File in the menu bar and then click Save As. The Save As dialog box opens. A good 
place to save a console is the Windows desktop. Then close all windows.

The different views of logs are listed in the left pane, and you can drill down into subcategories of 
these logs. First select a log in the left pane. To sort a list of events, click a column heading in the middle 
pane. Click an event in the middle pane to see details about the event. For example, in Figure 11-26, the 
Administrative Events log shows Windows had a problem loading a device driver.
Figure 11-26  Click an event to see details about the event
The types of events are Critical, Error, Warning, Information, and Audit Success. Error events are the 
most important and indicate something went wrong with the system, such as a scheduled backup failed 
to work. Warning events indicate failure might occur in the future, and Critical events indicate a problem 
occurred with a critical Windows process.
Here are the views of logs that are the most useful:
	 Administrative Events log. This log is a filtered log that shows only Critical, Error, and Warning events 
intended for the administrator. This log is in the Custom Views category and is selected in Figure 11-26.
	 Application log. In the Windows Logs group, look in the Application log for events recorded by an 
application. This log might help you identify why an application is causing problems.
	 Security log. Events in the Security log are called audits and include successful and unsuccessful sign-ins 
to a user account and attempts from another computer on the network to access shared resources on 
this computer.
	 Setup log. Look in the Setup log for events recorded when applications are installed.
	 System log. Look in the System log to find events triggered by Windows components, such as a device 
driver failing to load or a problem with hardware.
	 Forwarded Events log. This log receives events that were recorded on other computers and sent to this 
computer.
When you first encounter a Windows, hardware, application, or security problem, get in the habit of 
checking Event Viewer as one of your first steps toward investigating the problem. To save time, first check 
the Administrative Events log because it filters out all events except Critical, Error, and Warning events.

Create Custom Log Files
You can filter events and create a log of only your filtered events. Then you can save this custom view 
to an .evtx file, which you can use to document a problem or email to someone who is helping you 
troubleshoot a problem. To create a custom view, right-click any log in the left pane and select Create 
Custom View from the shortcut menu. The Create Custom View box appears (see Figure 11-27), which 
offers many ways to filter events.
Figure 11-27  Criteria to filter events in Event Viewer for a custom view
After you select the filters, click OK. In the next box, name your custom view and click OK. Your 
custom view is now listed in the left pane. To save the view to an .evtx file, right-click it and click Save All 
Events in Custom View As. In the Save As box that appears, name the file and browse to where you want 
to save it. Then click Save. A good place to save an event log file is the desktop. Later, to view the log file, 
double-click the file name and it will open in Event Viewer.
Limit Size of Logs
To control the size of a log in Event Viewer, you can clear it. Right-click a log and click Clear Log in the 
shortcut menu. Before clearing the log, Event Viewer gives you a chance to save it. Be default, Event Viewer 
sets a maximum size for each log and overwrites older events with newer ones when the maximum size 
is reached. To change this setting so that you can control the maximum size of a log file and to cause the 
events to be archived before they are overwritten, right-click a log and select Properties from the log’s 
shortcut menu. The properties box for the Application log is shown in Figure 11-28.

Event Viewer Solves a Mystery
Event Viewer can be useful in solving intermittent hardware problems. For example, I once worked in 
an office where several people updated Microsoft Word documents stored on a file server. For weeks, 
people complained about these Word documents getting corrupted. We downloaded the latest patches 
for Windows and Microsoft Office and scanned for viruses, thinking that the problem might be with 
Windows or the application. Then we suspected a corrupted template file for building the Word documents. But 
nothing we did solved our problem of corrupted Word documents. Then one day someone thought to check Event 
Viewer on the file server. Event Viewer had faithfully been recording errors when writing to the hard drive. What we 
had suspected to be a software problem was, in fact, a failing hard drive, which was full of bad sectors. We replaced 
the drive and the problem went away. That day I learned the value of checking Event Viewer very early in the 
troubleshooting process.

Event Viewer can be intimidating to use but is really nothing more than a bunch of logs to search and

and close it without saving your changes. Now look in Applications and Services Logs and Microsoft 
Office Alerts. What event is recorded about your actions?

Performance Monitor offers hundreds of counters used to examine many aspects of the system related to 
performance. The Windows default setting is to show the %Processor Time counter the first time you open 
the window (see Figure 11-34). This counter appears as a red line in the graph and tracks activity of the 
processor.
To keep from unnecessarily using system resources, only use the counters you really need. For example, 
suppose you want to track hard drive activity. You first remove the %Processor Time counter. To delete a 
counter, select the counter from the list so that it is highlighted and click the red X above the graph.
Next add two counters: the % Disk Time counter and Avg. Disk Queue Length counter in the 
PhysicalDisk group. The % Disk Time counter tracks the percentage of time the hard drive is in use, 
and the Avg. Disk Queue Length counter tracks the average number of processes waiting to use the hard 
drive. To add a counter, click the green plus sign above the graph. Then, in the Add Counters box, select a 
counter and click Add. Figure 11-35 shows the Add Counters box with two counters added. After all your 
counters are added, click OK.

If the Avg. Disk Queue Length is above two and the % Disk Time is more than 80 percent, you can 
conclude that the hard drive is working excessively hard and processes are slowed down waiting on the 
drive. Anytime a process must wait to access the hard drive, you are likely to see degradation in overall 
system performance.

Registry Editor
Many actions, such as installing application software or hardware, can result in changes to 
the registry. These changes can create new keys, add new values to existing keys, and change 
existing values. For a few difficult problems, you might need to edit or remove a registry key. 
This part of the chapter looks at how the registry is organized, which keys might hold entries 
causing problems, and how to back up and edit the registry using the Registry Editor (regedit.exe). Let’s 
first look at how the registry is organized, and then you’ll learn how to back up and edit the registry.
How the Registry Is Organized
The most important Windows component that holds information for Windows is the registry. The registry 
is a database designed with a treelike structure (called a hierarchical database) that contains configuration 
information for Windows, users, software applications, and installed hardware devices. During startup, 
Windows builds the registry in memory and keeps it there until Windows shuts down. During startup, after 
the registry is built, Windows reads from it to obtain information to complete the startup process. After 
Windows is loaded, it continually reads from many of the subkeys in the registry.
Windows builds the registry from the current hardware configuration and from information it takes 
from these files:
	 Five files stored in the C:\Windows\System32\config folder; these files are called hives, and they are 
named the SAM (Security Accounts Manager), SECURITY, SOFTWARE, SYSTEM, and DEFAULT hives. 
(Each hive is backed up with a log file and a backup file, which are also stored in the C:\Windows\
System32\config folder.)
	 C:\Users\username\Ntuser.dat file, which holds the preferences and settings of the currently  
signed-in user.

After the registry is built in memory, it is organized into five high-level keys (see Figure 11-37). Each key 
can have subkeys, and subkeys can have more subkeys and can be assigned one or more values. The way 
data is organized in the hive files is different from the way it is organized in registry keys. Figure 11-38 
shows the relationship between registry keys and hives. For example, in the figure, notice that the  
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT key contains data that comes from the SOFTWARE and DEFAULT hive, and 
some of this data is also stored in the larger HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key.

Optimizing Windows
Here are the five keys, including where they get their data and their purposes:
	 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM) is the most important key and contains hardware, software, and 
security data. The data is taken from four hives: the SAM hive, the SECURITY hive, the SOFTWARE 
hive, and the SYSTEM hive. In addition, the HARDWARE subkey of HKLM is built when the registry is 
first loaded, based on data collected about the current hardware configuration.
	 HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG (HKCC) contains information that identifies each hardware device 
installed on the computer. Some of the data is gathered from the current hardware configuration when 
the registry is first loaded into memory. Other data is taken from the HKLM key, which got its data 
­primarily from the SYSTEM hive.
	 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT (HKCR) stores information that determines which application is opened when 
the user double-clicks a file. This process relies on the file’s extension to determine which program to 
load. Data for this key is gathered from the HKLM key and the HKCU key.
	 HKEY_USERS (HKU) contains data about all users and is taken from the DEFAULT hive.
	 HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU) contains data about the current user. The key is built when a user 
signs in using data kept in the HKEY_USERS key and data kept in the Ntuser.dat file of the current user.
Before You Edit the Registry, Back It Up!
When you need to edit the registry, if possible, make the change from the Windows tool that is responsible 
for the key—for example, by using the Programs and Features applet in Control Panel. If that doesn’t work 
and you must edit the registry, always back up the registry before attempting to edit it. Changes made to 
the registry are implemented immediately.
Caution
There is no undo feature in the Registry Editor, and no opportunity to change your mind once the edit is made.
Here are the ways to back up the registry:
	 Use System Protection to create a restore point. A restore point keeps information about the registry. 
You can restore the system to a restore point to undo registry changes, as long as the registry is basically 
intact and not too corrupted. Also know that, if System Protection is turned on, Windows automatically 
makes a daily backup of the registry hive files to the C:\Windows\System32\Config\RegBack folder.
	 Back up a single registry key just before you edit the key. This method, called exporting a key, should 
always be used before you edit the registry. How to export a key is coming up in this chapter.
	 Make an extra copy of the C:\Windows\System32\config folder. This is what I call the old-fashioned 
shotgun approach to backing up the registry. This backup will help if the registry gets totally trashed. 
You can boot from the Windows setup DVD and use the Windows Recovery Environment to get a 
command prompt window that you can use to restore the folder from your extra copy. This method is 
drastic and not recommended except in severe cases. But, still, just to be on the safe side, you can make 
an extra copy of this folder just before you start any serious digging into the registry.
In some situations, such as when you’re going to make some drastic changes to the registry, you’ll want 
to play it safe and use more than one backup method. Extra registry backups are always a good thing! 
Now let’s look at how to back up an individual key in the registry, and then you’ll learn how to edit the 
registry.
Notes Device Manager reads data from the HKLM\HARDWARE key to build the information it displays about hardware 
configurations. You can consider Device Manager to be an easy-to-view presentation of this HARDWARE key data.

Backing Up and Restoring Individual Keys in the Registry
A less time-consuming method of backing up the registry is to back up a particular key that you plan to 
edit. However, know that if the registry gets corrupted, having a backup of only a particular key most 
likely will not help you much when trying a recovery. Also, although you could use this technique to back 
up the entire registry or an entire tree within the registry, it is not recommended.
To back up a key along with its subkeys in the registry, follow these steps:
1. Open the Registry Editor. To do that, enter regedit in the Windows 8 Run box or the Windows 7 Search 
box and respond to the UAC box. Figure 11-39 shows the Registry Editor with the five main keys and 
several subkeys listed. Click the triangles on the left to see subkeys. When you select a subkey, such as 
KeyboardClass in the figure, the names of the values in that subkey are displayed in the right pane along 
with the data assigned to each value.

2. Suppose we want to back up the registry key that contains a list of installed software, which is HKLM\
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall. (HKLM stands for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.) 
First click the appropriate triangles to navigate to the key. Next, right-click the key and select Export from the 
shortcut menu, as shown in Figure 11-40. The Export Registry File dialog box appears.

4. You can now edit the key. Later, if you need to undo your changes, exit the Registry Editor and double-
click the saved export file. The key and its subkeys saved in the export file will be restored. After you’re 
done with an export file, delete it so that no one accidentally double-clicks it and reverts the registry to 
an earlier setting.
Editing the Registry
Before you edit the registry, you should use one or more of the four backup methods just discussed so that 
you can restore it if something goes wrong. To edit the registry, open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe), and 
locate and select the key in the left pane of the Registry Editor, which will display the values stored in this 
key in the right pane. To edit, rename, or delete a value, right-click it and select the appropriate option from 
the shortcut menu. Changes are immediately applied to the registry and there is no undo feature. (However, 
Windows or applications might need to read the changed value before it affects their operations.) To search 
the registry for keys, values, and data, click Edit in the menu bar and then click Find.
Edit and Restore the Registry
When you install Windows on a new computer, Windows setup gives you opportunity to enter the reg-
istered owner and registered organization of the computer. Practice editing and restoring the registry 
by doing the following to change the registered owner name:
1.  In the Windows 8 Run box or the Windows 7 Search box, enter winver.exe, which displays the About 
Windows box. Who is the registered owner and registered organization of your computer?
2.	 Using the Registry Editor, export the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\
CurrentVersion to an export file stored on the desktop.
3.	 With the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion key selected in the left 
pane, double-click RegisteredOwner value in the right pane. The Edit String box appears (see Figure 11-41). 
Change the Value data, which is highlighted in the box and click OK. Close the Registry Editor window.

Caution
Changes made to the registry take effect immediately. Therefore, take extra care when editing the registry. 
If you make a mistake and don’t know how to correct a problem you create, then double-click the exported key to recover. 
When you double-click an exported key, the registry is updated with the values stored in this key.

	 For a dual-monitor setup, use the Screen Resolution window to configure multiple displays. For a multiple

boxes represent the relative positions of each monitor. (For example, in Figure 11-43, the right monitor is 
represented by box 1 and the left monitor is represented by box 2.) You can also adjust the boxes so they 
are horizontal or vertical relative to each other. If you stack the boxes vertically, the pointer moves vertically 
from monitor to monitor. For either a horizontal or 
vertical multiple monitor misalignment problem, align 
the two boxes evenly and not staggered so that the 
pointer moves straight across or straight up or down to 
the second monitor without staggering. For best results, 
use the same screen resolution for both monitors.
	 Windows 8 offers a multimonitor taskbar, which 
is the option to extend the desktop taskbar across 
both monitors. (Windows 7/Vista does not have 
this option.) To make the adjustment, right-click the 
taskbar and click Properties. You can manage the 
taskbar for multiple displays on the Taskbar tab of 
the taskbar properties box (see Figure 11-44).
Recall from the chapter, “Installing Windows,” that 
Windows requires the video adapter and drivers support 
DirectX 9. DirectX is a Microsoft software development 
tool that software developers can use to write multimedia 
applications, such as games, video-editing software, and 
computer-aided design software. The video firmware 
on the video card or motherboard chipset can interpret 
DirectX commands to build 3D.

Now let’s turn our attention to the step-by-step procedures using the tools you just learned about to 
improve Windows performance.
Improving Windows Performance
In this part of the chapter, you learn to search for problems affecting performance and to 
clean up the Windows startup process. These step-by-step procedures go beyond the routine 
maintenance tasks you learned about in the chapter, “Maintaining Windows.” We’re assuming 
Windows starts with no errors. If you are having trouble loading Windows, it’s best to address 
the error first rather than to use the tools described here to improve performance. How to handle errors 
that keep Windows from starting is covered in the chapter, “Troubleshooting Windows Startup.”

Optimizing Windows
Step 1: Perform Routine Maintenance
It might seem pretty mundane, but the first things you need to do to improve performance of 
a sluggish Windows system are the routine maintenance tasks that you learned in the chapter, 
“Maintaining Windows.” These tasks are summarized here:
	 Verify critical Windows settings. Make sure Windows updates are current. Verify that antivirus software 
is updated and set to routinely scan for viruses. Make sure the network connection is secured. If the 
system is experiencing a marked decrease in performance, suspect a virus and use up-to-date antivirus 
software to perform a full scan of the system.
	 Clean up, defrag, and check the hard drive. Make sure at least 15 percent of drive C: is free. Make 
sure a magnetic hard drive is being defragged weekly. If you suspect hard drive problems, use chkdsk to 
check the hard drive for errors and recover data.
	 Uninstall software you no longer need. Use the Programs and Features applet in Control Panel to unin-
stall programs you no longer need. Also, for Windows 8, uninstall any apps on the Start screen you no 
longer use and turn off live tiles you don’t watch.
As always, if valuable data is not backed up, back it up before you apply any of the fixes in this chapter. 
You don’t want to risk losing the user’s data.
Step 2: Clean Windows Startup
The most important step following routine maintenance to improve performance is to verify 
that startup programs are kept to a minimum. Before cleaning Windows startup, you can 
perform a clean boot to set a benchmark for the time it takes to start Windows when only the 
bare minimum of programs are launched.
Observe Performance in a Clean Boot
To find out if programs and services are slowing down Windows startup, perform a clean boot, which was 
described earlier in the chapter, and watch to see if performance improves. Do the following:
1. Use a stopwatch or a watch with a second hand to time a normal startup from the moment you press 
the power button until the wait icon on the Windows desktop disappears.
2. Time the boot again, this time using a clean boot.
If the difference is significant, follow the steps in this part of the chapter to reduce Windows startup to 
essentials. If the performance problem still exists after a clean boot, you can assume that the problem is with 
hardware or Windows settings and you can proceed to Step 3: Check If the Hardware Can Support the OS.
Investigate and Eliminate Startup Programs
To speed up startup, search for unnecessary startup programs you can eliminate. Tools that can help are 
System Configuration (msconfig.exe), startup folders, and Task Manager. Follow these steps to investigate 
startup:
1. Open the Startup tab in Windows 8 Task Manager or the Startup tab in Windows 7 System 
Configuration. In the list of startup items, look for a specific startup program you don’t want. If you’re 
not sure of the purpose of a program, for Windows 8, right-click the program and click Search online in 
the shortcut menu. (For Windows 7, scroll to the right in the Command column to see the location and 
name of the startup program file and use that information for a web search.) Then search the web for 
information on this program. Be careful to use only reliable sites for credible information.

2. If you want to find out if disabling a startup entry gives problems or improves performance, temporarily 
disable it using Windows 8 Task Manager or Windows 7 System Configuration. To permanently ­disable 
a startup item, it’s best to uninstall the software or remove the entry from a startup folder. See the 
appendix, “Entry Points for Windows Startup Processes,” for a list of startup folders.
3. As you research startup processes, Task Manager can tell you what processes are currently running. Open 
Task Manager and select the Processes. If you see a process and want to know its program file location, 
in Windows 8, right-click the process and click Open file location. File Explorer opens at the program 
file’s location.
For extremely slow systems that need a more drastic fix, set Windows for a clean boot. Then restart the 
system and see what problems you get into with a program disabled that you really need. Then enable just 
the ones you decide you need.
Caution
A word of caution is important here: Many websites will tell you a legitimate process is malicious so that 
you will download and use their software to get rid of the process. However, their software is likely to be adware or 
­spyware that you don’t want. Make sure you can trust a site before you download from it or take its advice.
Notes The startup folder for all users is hidden by default. In the chapter, “Survey of Windows Features and Support 
Tools,” you learned how to unhide folders that are hidden.
OS Differences For Windows 7, to find out the file location, click View and click Select Columns. In the Select 
Process Page Columns, check Image Path Name and click OK. The Image Path Name column is added to the Processes tab.
Regardless of the method you use, be sure to restart the system after each change and note what 
happens. Do you get an error message? Does a device or application not work? If so, you have probably 
disabled a service or program you need.
Has performance improved? If performance does not improve by disabling services or startup programs, 
go back and enable them again. If no non-Microsoft service or startup program caused the problem, then 
you can assume the problem is caused by a Microsoft service or startup program. Start disabling them one 
at a time.
Remember that you don’t want to permanently leave System Configuration or Task Manager in control 
of startup. After you have used these two tools to identify the problem, use other tools to permanently 
remove a service or program from startup that is causing a problem. Use the Services console to disable 
a service, use the Programs and Features window to uninstall software, and remove program files from 
startup folders. After the problem is fixed, return System Configuration and/or Task Manager to a normal 
startup.
Don’t forget to restart the computer after making a change to verify that all is well.
Caution
You might be tempted to disable all Microsoft services. If you do so, you are disabling Networking, Event 
Logging, Error Reporting, Windows Firewall, Windows Installer, Windows Backup, Print Spooler, Windows Update, System 
Protection, and other important services. These services should be disabled only when testing for performance problems 
and then immediately enabled when the test is finished. Also, know that if you disable the Volume Shadow Copy service, 
all restore points kept on the system will be lost. If you intend to use System Restore to fix a problem with the system, 
don’t disable this service. If you are not sure what a service does, read its description in the Services console before you 
change its status.

Step 3: Check If the Hardware Can Support the OS
The system might be slow because the OS does not have the hardware resources it needs. Use 
System Information (msinfo32.exe) to find the model and speed of the installed processor and 
hard drive and the amount of memory installed. Compare all these values with the minimum 
and recommended requirements for Windows listed in the chapter, “Installing Windows.” 
A+

4.1
Check for Unwanted Scheduled Tasks
When applications install, they often schedule tasks to check for and download their program updates, 
and malware sometimes hides as a scheduled task. Scheduled tasks might be unnecessary and can slow a 
system down. The best way to uninstall a scheduled task is to uninstall the software that is responsible 
for the task. Open the Task Scheduler window and search through tasks looking for those you think are 
unnecessary or causing trouble. Research the software the task works with and then you might decide to 
uninstall the software or disable the task.
Don’t forget to restart the system to make sure all is well before you move on.
Monitor the Startup Process
Now that you have the startup process clean, you will want to keep it that way. You can use several third-
party tools to monitor any changes to startup. A good one is WinPatrol by Ruiware (www.winpatrol 
.com). Download and install the free version of the program to run in the background to monitor all sorts 
of things, including changes to the registry, startup processes, Internet Explorer settings, and system files. 
In Figure 11-46, you can see how WinPatrol gave an alert when it detected malware about to register 
itself as a service to launch at startup. WinPatrol displays a little black Scotty dog in the notification area 
of the taskbar to indicate it’s running in the background and guarding your system. Also, many antivirus 
programs monitor the startup process and inform you when changes are made.

If you suspect that the processor, hard drive, or memory is a bottleneck, use Performance Monitor to get 
more information. If the bottleneck appears to be graphics, the problem might be solved by updating the 
graphics drivers or video adapter.
If you find that the system is slow because of a hardware component, discuss the situation with the user. 
You might be able to upgrade the hardware or install another OS that is compatible with the hardware that is 
present. Upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 8.1 can often improve performance in a computer that has 
slow hardware components. Better still, perform a clean installation of Windows 8.1 so that you get a fresh 
start with installed applications, plug-ins, and background services that might be slowing down the system.
Step 4: Check for a History of Problems
If you have the opportunity to interview the user, try to identify when the slow performance 
problem began. You can then use the Action Center and Reliability Monitor to find out what 
changes were made to the system around that time and what other problems occurred. Open 
Control Panel in Classic view and then open Action Center. In the Action Center, expand the 
Maintenance group and click View reliability history. The Reliability Monitor opens (see Figure 11-47).

Click a date to see a list of activities on that day. If you don’t know when the problem started, skim 
through the line graph at the top of the Reliability Monitor window and look for drops in the graph. Also 
look for critical events indicated by a red X (refer to Figure 11-47).
Step 5: Consider Using ReadyBoost
Windows ReadyBoost uses a flash drive or secure digital (SD) memory card to boost hard 
drive performance. The faster flash memory is used as a buffer to speed up hard drive access 
time. You see the greatest performance increase using ReadyBoost when you have a slow 
magnetic hard drive (running at less than 7200 RPM). To find out what speed your hard 
drive is using, use System Information (msinfo32.exe) and drill down into the Components, Storage group, 
and select Disks (see Figure 11-48). The model of the hard drive appears in the right pane. Use Google to 
search on this brand and model; a quick search shows this drive runs at 5400 RPM. It’s, therefore, a good 
candidate to benefit from ReadyBoost.

Optimizing Windows
When you first connect a flash device, Windows will automatically test it to see if it qualifies for ReadyBoost. To 
qualify, it must have a capacity of 256 MB to 4 GB with at least 256 MB of free space, and run at about 2 MB/sec 
of throughput. If the device qualifies and ReadyBoost will speed up hard drive performance, Windows displays a 
dialog box that can be used to activate ReadyBoost. Follow directions on screen to decide how much of the device 
memory to allot for ReadyBoost and activate ReadyBoost. You can manually have Windows test a memory card 
or flash drive for ReadyBoost by right-clicking the device and selecting Properties from the shortcut menu. On the 
device properties box, click the ReadyBoost tab. The box in Figure 11-49a reports the USB flash drive will not 
improve performance because the hard drive is fast enough; the box in Figure 11-49b reports the same USB flash 
drive will help another system that has a slower hard drive.

The best flash devices to use for ReadyBoost are the ones that can take advantage of the faster ports. 
For example, a SuperSpeed USB (USB 3.0) device and port is about 10 times faster than a Hi-Speed USB 
(USB 2.0) device and port. Incidentally, when you remove the device, no data is lost because the device only 
holds a copy of the data.
Manually Removing Software
In this part of the chapter, we focus on getting rid of programs that refuse to uninstall or give 
errors when uninstalling. In these cases, you can manually uninstall a program. Doing so often 
causes problems later, so use the methods discussed in this section only as a last resort after 
normal uninstall methods have failed.

sidebar uses system resources and disabling it can improve performance. To do that, right-click the sidebar and select 
Properties from the shortcut menu. In the Sidebar Properties box, uncheck Start Sidebar when Windows starts and 
click OK.
DISABLE THE Aero Interface
The Windows 7/Vista Aero interface might be slowing down the system because it uses memory and 
computing power. Try disabling it. If performance improves, you can conclude that the hardware is not 
able to support the Aero interface. At that point, you might want to upgrade memory, upgrade the 
video card, or leave the Aero interface disabled.
To disable the Aero interface using Windows 7, do the following:
1.	 Right-click the desktop and select Personalize from the shortcut menu. The Personalization window opens

Optimizing Windows
This part of the chapter discusses the following steps to manually remove software:
1. First try to locate and use an uninstall routine provided by the software. If this works, you are done and 
can skip the next steps.
2. Delete the program folders and files that hold the software.
3. Delete the registry entries used by the software.
4. Remove the entries in the Start menu and delete any shortcuts on the desktop.
5. Remove any entries that launch processes at startup.
Now let’s step through the process of manually removing software.
Step 1: First Try the Uninstall Routine
Most programs written for Windows have an uninstall routine that can be accessed from the 
Programs and Features window and Windows 8 apps can be uninstalled on the Start screen. 
First, try one of these methods before moving on to Step 2. 
Step 2: Delete Program Files
If the uninstall routine is missing or does not work, the next step is to delete the program folders 
and files that contain the software. In our example, we’ll delete the RegServe software without 
using its uninstall routine. (RegServe is utility software that can clean the registry of unused keys.)
Look for the program folder in one of these folders:
	 C:\Program Files
	 C:\Program Files (x86)
In Figure 11-51, you can see the RegServe folder under the C:\Program Files (x86) folder. Keep in mind, 
however, the program files might be in another location that was set by the user when the software was 
installed. Delete the RegServe folder and all its contents.

Notes
Notes Before uninstalling software, make sure it’s not running in the background. For example, antivirus software 
cannot be uninstalled if it’s still running. You can use Task Manager to end all processes related to the software, and you 
can use the Services console to stop services related to the software. Then remove the software.

As you do, you might see the Folder In Use box shown on the right side of Figure 11-51 saying the 
program is in use. In this situation, do the following:
1. Look for the program file reported on the Processes tab of Task Manager. If you see it listed, end 
the process. For Windows 8, be sure to look in the Windows Explorer group (see Figure 11-52). For 
Windows 7, the Command Line column can help you find the right program.
Figure 11-52  Task Manager shows a service is running and needs to be stopped before the 
program files can be deleted
2. If you don’t find the program on the Processes tab, check the Services tab. If you find it there, select it 
and stop the service.
3. After the program or service is stopped, try to delete the program folder again. If you still cannot delete 
the folder, look for other running programs or services associated with the software. Look for a program 
or service that has a program file location in the RegServe folder or its subfolders.
Step 3: Delete Registry Entries
Editing the registry can be dangerous, so do this with caution and be sure to back up first! Do 
the following to delete registry entries that cause a program to be listed as installed software in 
the Programs and Features window of Control Panel:
1. To be on the safe side, back up the entire registry using one or more of the methods discussed earlier in 
the chapter.
2. Open the Registry Editor by using the regedit command in the Search box.
3. Locate a key that contains the entries that make up the list of installed software. Use this criteria to 
decide which key to locate:
	 For a 32-bit program installed in a 32-bit OS or for a 64-bit program installed in a 64-bit OS,  
locate this key:
	
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall
	 For a 32-bit program installed in a 64-bit OS, locate this key:
	
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall

4. Back up the Uninstall key to the Windows desktop so that you can backtrack, if necessary. To do that, 
right-click the Uninstall key and select Export from the shortcut menu (see Figure 11-40 earlier in the 
chapter).
5. In the Export Registry File dialog box, select the Desktop. Enter the file name as Save Uninstall Key, and 
click Save. You should see a new file icon on your desktop named Save Uninstall Key.reg.
6. The Uninstall key can be a daunting list of all the programs installed on your computer. When you 
expand the key, you see a long list of subkeys in the left pane, which might have meaningless names 
that won’t help you find the program you’re looking for. Select the first subkey in the Uninstall key and 
watch as its values and data are displayed in the right pane (see Figure 11-53). Step down through each 
key, watching for a meaningful name of the subkey in the left pane or meaningful details in the right 
pane until you find the program you want to delete.
Figure 11-53  Select a subkey under the Uninstall key to display its values and data in the right pane
  7. To delete the key, right-click the key and select Delete from the shortcut menu. Confirm the deletion, 
as shown in Figure 11-53. Be sure to search through all the keys in this list because the software might 
have more than one key. Delete them all and exit the Registry Editor.
  8. Open the Programs and Features window and verify that the list of installed software is correct and the 
software you are uninstalling is no longer listed.
  9. If the list of installed software is not correct, to restore the Uninstall registry key, double-click the Save 
Uninstall Key.reg icon on your desktop.
10. As a last step when editing the registry, clean up after yourself by deleting the Save Uninstall Key.reg file 
on your desktop. Right-click the icon and select Delete from the shortcut menu.
Step 4: Remove Program Shortcuts
For Windows 8, go to the Start screen and type the name of the program. The Problem with 
Shortcut box appears (see Figure 11-54). Click Yes and the program will no longer be listed on 
the Start screen or Apps screen. For Windows 7, to remove the program from the All Programs 
menu, right-click it and select Delete from the shortcut menu. If the program has shortcuts on 
the desktop, delete these.

Chapter Summary
Step 5: Remove Startup Processes
Restart the system and watch for any startup errors about a missing program file. The 
software might have stored startup entries in the registry, in startup folders, or as a service that 
is no longer present and causing an error. If you see an error, use System Configuration or Task 
Manager to find out how the program is set to start. This entry point is called an orphaned 
entry. You’ll then need to delete this startup entry by editing the registry, deleting a shortcut in a startup 
folder, or disabling a service using the Services console.
It’s unlikely you will be able to completely remove all keys in the registry that the software put there. A 
registry cleaner can help you find these orphaned keys, but if no errors appear at startup, you can just leave 
these keys untouched. Also, an installation might put program files in the C:\Program Files\Common Files 
or the C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files folder. Most likely you can just leave these untouched as well. 
Address all error messages you encounter and stop there.
>> Chapter Summary
Windows Utilities and Tools to Support the OS
	The Windows OS is made up of two main components, the shell and the kernel. The shell provides an 
interface for users and applications. The kernel is responsible for interacting with hardware.
	A process is a program running under the shell, together with all the resources assigned to it. A thread is 
a single task that a process requests from the kernel.
	Task Manager (taskmgr.exe) lets you view services and other running programs, CPU and memory 
­performance, network activity, and user activity. It is useful to stop a process that is hung.
	Tools listed in the Administrative Tools group of Control Panel are used by technicians and developers 
to support Windows and applications.
	System Configuration (msconfig.exe) can be used to temporarily disable startup processes to test for 
­performance improvement and find a startup program causing a problem.
	System Configuration and Task Manager can be used to perform a clean boot, which reduces the boot 
to essentials.
	The Services console (services.msc) is used to manage Windows and application services. When and if a 
service starts can be controlled from this console.

Optimizing Windows
	The Computer Management console (compmgmt.msc) contains a group of Windows Administrative 
tools useful for managing a system.
	The Microsoft Management Console (MMC) can be used to build your own custom consoles from 
available snap-ins.
	The Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc) console displays a group of logs kept by Windows that are useful for 
troubleshooting problems with software and hardware. You can also use Event Viewer to view security 
audits made by Windows.
	The Print Management utility can be used to manage printers and print servers on a network. Print 
Management considers any computer that shares a printer with other computers on the network to be a 
print server.
	Task Scheduler (taskschd.msc) schedules and runs tasks, which are stored in C:\Windows\System32\
Tasks folder.
	Performance Monitor (perfmon.msc) uses counters to track activity by hardware and software to evalu-
ate performance.
	The Registry Editor (regedit.exe) is used to edit the registry in real time. There is no way to use the 
Registry Editor to undo changes you make to the registry. Therefore, you should always make a backup 
before editing it.
	The Display applet in Control Panel can be used to change the screen resolution and refresh rate and 
adjust color depth. The taskbar properties box can be used to extend the Windows 8 taskbar across 
both monitors in a dual-monitor setup.
	The dxdiag command can be used to verify the version of DirectX.
Improving Windows Performance
	The five high-level steps to improve Windows performance are (1) routine maintenance, (2) clean 
Windows startup, (3) check if hardware can support the OS, (4) check for a history of problems to find 
the source of a problem, and (5) consider using ReadyBoost to improve a slow hard drive’s performance. 
For Windows 7/Vista, disable the Aero interface.
Manually Removing Software
	To manually delete software, delete the program files, registry keys, shortcuts to the program on the 
Start screen, Apps screen, or Windows 7 All Programs menu, and items in startup folders.

RegServe by Xionix can be downloaded free from the regserve.com website. Download, install, and run 
the software. How many orphaned registry keys did it find on your computer? Which software installed 
on your computer is responsible for these orphaned keys? Do you think your system would benefit from 
allowing RegServe to clean your registry? If you decide to use RegServe to clean the registry, be sure to cre-
ate a restore point first so you can undo the changes to your registry, if necessary.
Real Problem 11-2 Cleaning Up Startup
Using a computer that has a problem with a sluggish startup, apply the tools and procedures you learned 
in this chapter to clean up the startup process. Take detailed notes of each step you take and its results. 
(If you are having a problem finding a computer with a sluggish startup, consider offering your help to a 
friend, a family member, or a nonprofit organization.)

Troubleshooting Windows

hen a computer gives you problems, a good plan for solving 
that problem can help you to not feel so helpless. This chapter 
is designed to give you just that—a plan with all the necessary details 
and tools so that you can determine just what has gone wrong and 
what to do about it.
Equally important when troubleshooting computers is handling 
customer concerns. Knowing how to effectively work with people 
in a technical world is one of the most sought-after skills in today’s 
service-oriented work environments. Just before writing this chapter, 
an employer told me, “It’s not hard to find technically proficient peo-
ple these days. But it’s next to impossible to find people who know 
how to get along with others and can be counted on when managers 
are not looking over their shoulders.” I could sense his frustration, but 
I also felt encouraged to know that good social skills and good work 
ethics can take you far in today’s world. My advice to you is to take 
this chapter seriously. It’s important to be technically proficient, but 
the skills learned in this chapter just might be the ones that make you 
stand out above the crowd to land that new job or promotion.
In this chapter, we begin with interpersonal skills (people skills, 
sometimes called soft skills) needed by an IT support technician. Then 
we move on to how to troubleshoot any computer problem, and drill 
down into the specifics of troubleshooting applications.
Notes This chapter focuses on problems that occur after the Windows desktop 
has loaded. Recall that you learned how to solve hardware problems, including those 
that cause the system to not boot, in the chapter, “Supporting the Power System 
and Troubleshooting Computers.” You’ll learn how to solve software problems when 
Windows refuses to start in the chapter, “Troubleshooting Windows Startup.”

Supporting Customers and Troubleshooting Windows
What Customers Want: Beyond Technical Know-How
Probably the most significant indication that an IT technician is doing a good job is that 
customers are consistently satisfied. In your career as an IT support technician, commit to 
providing excellent service and to treating customers as you would want to be treated in 
a similar situation. One of the most important ways to achieve customer satisfaction is to 
do your best by being prepared, both technically and personally. Being prepared includes knowing what 
customers want, what they don’t like, and what they expect from an IT technician.

Becoming a Competent and Helpful Support Technician
The following traits distinguish a competent and helpful technician from a technician who is 
incompetent or unhelpful in the eyes of the customer:
  Trait 1. Be dependable and reliable. Customers appreciate and respect those who do as they 
say. If you promise to be back at 10:00 the next morning, be back at 10:00 the next morning. 
If you cannot keep your appointment, never ignore your promise. Call, apologize, let the customer know 
what happened, and reschedule your appointment. Also, do your best to return phone calls the same day 
and email within two days.
A+  
220-902 
5.4
	 Trait 2. Keep a positive and helpful attitude. This helps establish good customer relationships. You 
communicate your attitude in your tone of voice, the words you choose, how you use eye contact, 
your facial expressions, how you dress, and in many other subjective and subtle ways. Generally, your 
attitudes toward your customers stem from how you see people, how you see yourself, and how you 
see your job. Your attitude is a heart issue, not a head issue. To improve your attitude, you must do it 
from your heart. That’s pretty subjective and cannot be defined with a set of rules, but it always begins 
with a decision to change. As you work with customers or users, make it a habit to not talk down to or 
patronize them. Don’t make the customers or users feel inferior. People appreciate it when they feel your 
respect for them, even when they have made a mistake or are not knowledgeable. If a problem is simple 
to solve, don’t make the other person feel he or she has wasted your time. Your customer or user should 
always be made to feel that the problem is important to you.
Customer Service
Josie walked into a computer parts store and wandered over to the cleaning supplies looking for Ace 
monitor wipes. She saw another brand of wipes, but not the ones she wanted. Looking around for help, 
she noticed Mary stocking software on the shelves in the next aisle. She walked over to Mary and asked 
her if she could help her find Ace monitor wipes. Mary put down her box, walked over to the cleaning 
supply aisle without speaking, picked up a can of wipes and handed them to Josie, still without speaking a word. 
Josie explained she was looking for Ace wipes. Mary yells over three aisles to a coworker in the back room, “Hey,

Notes People respond in kind to the position of facial muscles presented to them. Try smiling when you first greet 
someone and watch to see what happens.
Notes Quote from R.C., an employer: “When I choose a person to work for me, in a lot of cases, I choose based 
on his or her past dependability or attendance. I am less concerned about a person’s ability because I can train anyone 
to do a specific job. I cannot, however, train anyone to do anything if he or she is not present for me to train. Being 
dependable and reliable has a profound impact on customer relationships as well.”

	 Trait 3. Listen without interrupting your customer. When you’re working with or talking to a customer, 
focus on him or her. Don’t assume you know what your customer is about to say. Let her say it, listen 
carefully, and don’t interrupt. Make it your job to satisfy this person, not just your organization, your 
boss, your bank account, or the customer’s boss.
Billy! This lady says she wants Ace monitor wipes. We got any?” Billy comes from the back room and says, “No, we 
only carry those,” pointing to the wipes in Mary’s hand, and returns to the back room. Mary turns to Josie and says, 
“We only carry these,” and puts the wipes back on the shelf. She turns to walk back to her aisle when Josie says to 
Mary, “Well, those Ace wipes are great wipes. You might want to consider carrying them.” Mary says, “I’m only respon-
sible for software.” Josie leaves the store.
Discuss this situation in a small group of students and answer the following questions:
1.	 If you were Josie, how would you feel about the service in this store?
2.	 What would you have expected to happen that did not happen?
3.	 If you were Mary, how could you have provided better service?
4.	 If you were Billy, is there anything more you could have done to help?
5.	 If you were the store manager, what principles of good customer service would you want Billy and Mary to know 
that would have helped them in this situation?

	 Trait 4. Use proper and polite 
language. Speak politely and use 
language that won’t confuse your 
customer. Avoid using slang or jargon 
(technical language that only technical 
people can understand). Avoid 
acronyms (initial letters that stand for 
words). For example, don’t say to a 
nontechnical customer, “I need to ditch 
your KVM switch,” when you could 
explain yourself better by saying to the 
customer,  
“I need to replace that little switch 
box on your desk that controls your 
keyboard, monitor, and mouse.”
	 Trait 5. Show sensitivity to cultural 
differences. Cultural differences happen 
because we are from different countries 
and societies or because of physical 
disabilities. Culture can cause us to 
differ in how we define or judge good 
service. For example, culture can affect our degree of tolerance for uncertainty. Some cultures are willing 
to embrace uncertainty, and others strive to avoid it. Those who tend to avoid uncertainty can easily get 
upset when the unexpected happens. For these people, you need to make special efforts to communicate 
early and often when things are not going as expected. For the physically disabled, especially the hearing- 
or sight-impaired, communication can be more difficult. It’s your responsibility in these situations to do

whatever is necessary to find a way to communicate. And it’s especially important to have an attitude 
that expresses honor and patience, which you will unconsciously express in your tone of voice, your 
choice of words, and your actions.
	 Trait 6. Take ownership of the problem. Taking ownership of the customer’s problem means to accept 
the customer’s problem as your own problem. Doing that builds trust and loyalty because the customer 
knows you can be counted on. Taking ownership of a problem also increases your value in the eyes 
of your coworkers and boss. People who don’t take ownership of the problem at hand are likely to be 
viewed as lazy, uncommitted, and uncaring. One way to take ownership of a problem is to not engage 
your boss in unproductive discussions about a situation that he expects you to handle on your own.
SELF-CONTROL
Jack had had a bad day on the phones at the networking help desk in Atlanta. An electrical outage cou-
pled with a generator failure had caused servers in San Francisco to be down most of the day. The entire 
help-desk team had been fielding calls all day explaining to customers why they did not have service and 
about expected recovery times. The servers were finally online, but it was taking hours to get everything 
reset and functioning. No one had taken a break all afternoon, but the call queue was still running about 20 minutes 
behind. Todd, the boss, had asked the team to work late until the queue was empty. It was Jack’s son’s birthday and 
his family was expecting Jack home on time. Jack moaned as he realized he might be late for Tyler’s party. Everyone 
pushed hard to empty the queue. As Jack watched the last call leave the queue, he logged off, stood up, and reached 
for his coat.
And then the call came. Jack was tempted to ignore it, but decided it had to be answered. It was Lacy. Lacy was 
the executive assistant to the CEO (chief executive officer over the entire company) and when Lacy calls, all priorities 
yield to Lacy, and Lacy knows it. The CEO was having problems printing to the laser printer in his office. Would Jack 
please walk down to his office and fix the problem? Jack asks Lacy to check the simple things like, “Is the printer 
turned on? Is it plugged in?” Lacy gets huffy and says, “Of course, I’ve checked that. Now come right now. I need to 
go.” Jack walks down to the CEO’s office, takes one look at the printer, and turns it on.
He turns to Lacy and says, “I suppose the on/off button was just too technical for you.” Lacy glares at him in 
disbelief. Jack says, “I’ll be leaving now.” As he walks out, he begins to form a plan as to how he’ll defend himself to 
his boss in the morning, knowing the inevitable call to Todd’s office will come.
In a group of two or four students, role-play Jack and Todd and discuss these questions:
1.	 Todd is informed the next morning of Jack’s behavior. Todd calls Jack into his office. He likes Jack and wants 
him to be successful in the company. Jack is resistant and feels justified in what he did. As Todd, what do you 
think is important that Jack understand? How can you explain this to Jack so he can accept it? What would 
you advise Jack to do? In role-play, one student plays the role of Jack, and another the role of Todd.
2.	 Switch roles or switch team members and replay the roles.
3.	 What are three principles of relating to people that would be helpful for Jack to keep in mind?

	 Trait 7. Portray credibility. Convey confidence to your customers. Don’t allow yourself to appear con-
fused, afraid, or befuddled. Troubleshoot the problem in a systematic way that portrays confidence and 
credibility. Get the job done, and do it with excellence. Credible technicians also know when the job is 
beyond their expertise and when to ask for help.
	 Trait 8. Work with integrity and honesty. Don’t try to hide your mistakes from your customer or your 
boss. Everyone makes mistakes, but don’t compound them by a lack of integrity. Accept responsibility 
and do what you can to correct the error.

	 Trait 10. Look and behave professionally. A professional at work knows to not allow his emotions to 
interfere with business relationships. If a customer is angry, allow the customer to vent, keeping your own 
professional distance. (You do, however, have the right to expect a customer not to talk to you in an abu-
sive way.) Dress appropriately for the environment. Take a shower each day, and brush your teeth after 
each meal. Use mouthwash. Iron your shirt. If you’re not in good health, try as best you can to take care 
of the problem. Your appearance matters. And finally—don’t use rough language. It is never appropriate.
Evaluate Your Own Interpersonal Skills with 
Customers and Coworkers
Assume that you are working as an IT support technician for a corporation. Your job requires you to give desk-side 
support to users, answer the phone at the help desk, and make an occasional on-site call at corporate branches. 
Answer the following questions:
1.	 In the role of desk-side support to users, what do you think is your strongest social skill that would help you 
succeed in this role?
2.	 What is likely to be your greatest interpersonal weakness that might present a challenge to you in this role?
3.	 What is one change you might consider making that will help you to improve on this weakness?
4.	 In the role of phone support at the help desk, what part of that job would you enjoy the most? What part would 
give you the greatest challenge?
5.	 When making on-site calls to corporate branches, what part of this job would you enjoy the most? What inter-
personal skills, if any, would you need to develop so that you could do your best in this role?

Notes Your customers might never remember what you said or what you did, but they will always remember how you 
made them feel.
The Johari Window Online Game
The Johari (pronounced “Joe-Harry” after the two men who created it) window reveals an interesting view of how we 
relate to others. Sometimes when we evaluate our own interpersonal skills, we overlook our greatest assets that others 
can see. This project is designed to help others reveal to you those assets. The house in Figure 12-2 represents who we 
are. Room 1 is what we know about ourselves that we allow others to see. Room 2 is what others see about us that we 
don’t see ourselves (our blind spots). Room 3 is what we see about ourselves that we hide from others. And Room 4 
contains traits in us that we don’t know about and neither do others see—traits yet to be discovered.
As we move Bar A to the right, we are making a conscious decision to reveal more about ourselves to others, which 
is a technique successful salespeople often use to immediately connect with their customers. The theory is that if you 
move Bar A to the right, not only are you choosing to reveal what you normally would hide, but you are also moving 
the bar so that more of Room 4 can be seen in Room 2. This means that others can see more about you that you don’t 
see. When we allow others to tell us something about ourselves, we are moving Bar B away from us, which, in effect,

Planning for Good Service
Your customers can be “internal” (you both work for the same company, in which case you 
might consider the customer your colleague) or “external” (your customers come to you or 
your company for service). Customers can be highly technical or technically naive, represent a 
large company or simply own a home computer, be prompt or slow at paying their bills, want 
only the best (and be willing to pay for it) or be searching for bargain service, be friendly and easy to work

Most good service for customers of IT support begins with entries in call tracking software, so let’s 
begin there.
Call Tracking Software
Your organization is likely to use call tracking software to track support calls and give technicians a place 
to keep their call notes. Figure 12-3 shows a window in everything HelpDesk software, which is a popular 
call tracking application.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know that when servicing a customer, you should be on time, 
avoid distractions, set and meet expectations and timelines, communicate the status of the solution with the customer, 
and deal appropriately with customers’ confidential materials.
with or demanding and condescending. In each situation, the key to success is always the same: Don’t allow 
circumstances or personalities to affect your commitment to excellence and to treat the customer as you 
would want to be treated.
When someone initiates a call for help, whoever receives the call starts the process by creating a ticket, 
which is a record of the request and what is happening to resolve it. The call tracking software might track: 
(1) the date, time, and length of help-desk or on-site calls, (2) causes of and solutions to problems already 
addressed, (3) who is currently assigned to the ticket and who has already worked on it, (4) who did what 
and when, and (5) how each call was officially resolved. The ticket is entered into the call tracking system 
and stays open until the issue is resolved. Support staff assigned to the ticket document their progress under 
this ticket in the call tracking system. As an open ticket ages, more attention and resources are assigned to 
it, and the ticket might be escalated (passed on to someone more experienced or who has more resources 
available) until the problem is finally resolved and the ticket closed. Help-desk personnel and managers 
acknowledge and sometimes even celebrate those who consistently close the most tickets!

Supporting Customers and Troubleshooting Windows
As you support customers and solve computer problems, it’s very important to include detailed 
information in your call notes so that you have this information as you problem solve or later, when faced 
with a similar problem. Sometimes another person must pick up your open ticket and should not have to 
waste time finding out information you already knew. Also, tracking-system notes are sometimes audited.
Initial Contact with a Customer
Your initial contact with a customer might be when the customer comes to you, such as in a retail setting, 
when you go to the customer’s site, when the customer calls you on the phone, when the customer reaches 
you by chat or email, or when you are assigned a ticket already entered in a call tracking system. In each 
situation, always follow the specific guidelines of your employer. Let’s look at some general guidelines for 
handling first contact with customers.
When you answer the phone, identify yourself and your organization. (Follow the guidelines of your employer 
on what to say.) Follow company policies to obtain specific information you should take when answering an 
initial call, such as name (get the right spelling), phone number, and business name. For example, your company 
might require that you obtain a licensing or warranty number to determine whether the customer is entitled 
to receive your support. After you have obtained all the information you need in order to know that you are 
authorized to help the customer, open up the conversation for the caller to describe the problem.
Prepare for on-site visits by reviewing information given to you by whoever took the call. Know 
the problem you are going to address; the urgency of the situation; and what computer, software, and 
hardware need servicing. Arrive with a complete set of equipment appropriate to the visit, which might 
include a toolkit, flashlight, multimeter, ESD strap and mat, and bootable media.
Figure 12-4  If a customer permits it, begin each new relationship with a handshake

When you arrive at the customer’s site, greet the customer in a friendly manner and shake his or her 
hand. Use Mr. or Ms. and last names or Sir or Ma’am rather than first names when addressing the customer, 
unless you are certain the customer expects you to use a first name. If the site is a residence, know that you 
should never stay at a site when only a minor is present. If a minor child answers the door, ask to speak 
with an adult and don’t allow the adult to leave the house with only you and the child present.

Use diplomacy and good manners when you work with a user to solve a problem. For example, if you 
suspect that the user dropped the computer, don’t ask, “Did you drop the laptop?” Put the question in a 
less accusatory manner: “Could the laptop have been dropped?”
Set and Meet Customer Expectations
A professional technician knows that it is her responsibility to set and meet expectations with a customer. 
It’s important to create an expectation of certainty with customers so that they are not left hanging and 
don’t know what will happen next.
Part of setting expectations is to establish a timeline with your customer for the completion of a 
project. If you cannot solve the problem immediately, explain to the customer what needs to happen and 
the timeline that he should expect for a solution. Then keep the customer informed about the progress 
of the solution. For example, you can say to a customer, “I need 
to return to the office and research the cost of parts that need 
replacing. I’ll call you tomorrow before 10:00 a.m. with an 
estimate.” If later you find out you need more time, call the 
customer before 10:00 a.m., explain your problem, and give 
him a new time to expect your call. This kind of service is very 
much appreciated by customers and, if you are consistent, you 
will quickly gain their confidence.
Another way to set expectations is to give the customer an 
opportunity to make decisions about repairs to the customer’s 
equipment. When explaining to the customer what needs to be 
done to fix a problem, offer repair or replacement options if 
they apply. Don’t make decisions for your customer. Explain 
the problem and what you must do to fix it, giving as many 
details as the customer wants. When a customer must make 
a choice, state the options in a way that does not unfairly 
favor the solution that makes the most money for you as the 
technician or for your company. For example, if you must 
replace a motherboard (a costly repair in parts and labor), 
explain to the customer the total cost of repairs and then help 
him decide if it is to his advantage to purchase a new system 
or repair this one.
After initial greetings, the first thing you should do is listen and ask questions. As you listen, it’s fine to 
take notes, but don’t start the visit by filling out your paperwork. Save the paperwork for later, or have the 
essentials already filled out before you reach the site.
Interview the Customer
Troubleshooting begins by interviewing the user. As you ask the user questions, take notes and keep asking 
questions until you thoroughly understand the problem. Have the customer reproduce the problem, and 
carefully note each step taken and its results. This process gives you clues about the problem and about the 
customer’s technical proficiency, which helps you know how to communicate with the customer.

Supporting Customers and Troubleshooting Windows
Working with a Customer on Site
As you work with a customer on site, avoid distractions as you work. Don’t accept personal calls or 
texts on your cell phone, and definitely don’t check social media sites when you’re on the job. Most 
organizations require that you answer calls from work, but keep the calls to a minimum. Be aware that 
the customer might be listening, so be careful to not discuss problems with coworkers, the boss, or other 
situations that might put the company, its employees, or products in a bad light with the customer. If you 
absolutely must excuse yourself from the on-site visit for personal reasons, explain to the customer the 
situation and return as soon as possible.
When working at a user’s desk, follow these general guidelines:
1. As you work, be as unobtrusive as possible. Consider yourself a guest in the customer’s office or resi-
dence. Don’t make a big mess. Keep your tools and papers out of the customer’s way. Don’t pile your 
belongings and tools on top of the user’s papers, books, and so forth.
2. Protect the customer’s confidential and private materials. For example, if you are working on the printer 
and discover a budget report in the out tray, quickly turn it over so you can’t read it, and hand it to the 
customer. If you notice a financial spreadsheet is displayed on the customer’s computer screen, step away 
and ask the user if she wants to first close the spreadsheet before you work with the computer. If sensi-
tive documents are lying on the customer’s desk, you might let him know and ask if he would like to put 
them out of your view or in a safe place.
3. Don’t take over the mouse or keyboard from the user without permission.
4. Ask permission again before you use the printer or other equipment.
5. Don’t use the phone without permission.
6. Accept personal inconvenience to accommodate the user’s 
urgent business needs. For example, if the user gets an impor-
tant call while you are working, don’t allow your work to inter-
fere. You might need to stop work and perhaps leave the room.
7. Also, if the user is present, ask permission before you make a 
software or hardware change, even if the user has just given 
you permission to interact with the computer.
8. Don’t disclose information about a customer on social media 
sites, and don’t use those public outlets to complain about dif-
ficulties with a customer.
In some IT support situations, it is appropriate to consider 
yourself a support to the user as well as to the computer. Your 
goals can include educating the user, as well as repairing the 
computer. If you want users to learn something from a problem 
they caused, explain how to fix the problem and walk them 
through the process if necessary. Don’t fix the problem yourself 
unless they ask you to. It takes a little longer to train the user, but 
it is more productive in the end because the user learns more and 
is less likely to repeat the mistake.
Working with a Customer on the Phone
Phone support requires more interaction with customers than any other type of IT support. To understand 
the problem and also give clear instructions, you must be able to visualize what the customer sees at his 
or her computer. Patience is required if the customer must be told each key to press or command button

to click. Help-desk support requires excellent communication skills, good phone manners, and lots of 
patience. As your help-desk skills improve, you will learn to think through the process as though you 
were sitting in front of the computer yourself. Drawing diagrams and taking notes as you talk can be very 
helpful. In some cases, help-desk support personnel might have software that enables the remote control of 
customers’ computers. Examples of this type of software are GoToAssist by Citrix at www.netviewer 
.com and LogMeIn Rescue by LogMeIn at secure.logmeinrescue.com. Always communicate clearly with 
customers when using this type of software, so that they understand what type of access they are allowing 
you to have on their computers.
If your call is accidentally disconnected, call back immediately. Don’t eat or drink while on the phone. 
If you must put callers on hold, tell them how long it will be before you get back to them. Speak clearly 
and don’t talk too fast. Don’t complain about your job, your boss or coworkers, your company, or other 
companies or products to your customers. A little small talk is okay and is sometimes beneficial in easing a 
tense situation, but keep it upbeat and positive.
Dealing with Difficult Customers
Most customers are polite and appreciate your help. And, if you make it a habit to treat others as you 
want to be treated, you’ll find that most of your customers will tend to treat you well, too. However, 
occasionally you’ll have to deal with a difficult customer. In this part of the chapter, you learn how to 
work with customers who are not knowledgeable, who are overly confident, and who complain.
When the Customer Is Not Knowledgeable 
When on site, you can put a computer in good repair without depending on a customer to help you. But 
when you are trying to solve a problem over the phone, with a customer as your only eyes, ears, and hands, 
a computer-illiterate user can present a challenge. Here are some tips for handling this situation:
	 Tip 1. Be specific with your instructions. For example, instead of saying, “Open File Explorer,” say, 
“Using your mouse, right-click the Start button, and click File Explorer from the menu.”
Figure 12-7  Learn to be patient and friendly when helping users

	 Tip 2. Don’t ask the customer to do something that might destroy settings or files without first having 
the customer back them up carefully. If you think the customer can’t handle your request, ask for some 
on-site help.

Supporting Customers and Troubleshooting Windows
	 Tip 3. Frequently ask the customer what is displayed on the screen to help you track the keystrokes and 
action.
	 Tip 4. Follow along at your own computer. It’s easier to direct the customer, keystroke by keystroke, if 
you are doing the same things.
	 Tip 5. Give the customer plenty of opportunity to ask questions.
	 Tip 6. Genuinely compliment the customer whenever you can to help the customer gain confidence.
	 Tip 7. If you determine that the customer cannot help you solve the problem without a lot of coaching, 
you might need to tactfully request that the caller have someone with more experience call you. The 
customer will most likely breathe a sigh of relief and have someone take over the problem.
When the Customer Is Overly Confident
Sometimes customers might want to give advice, take charge of a call, withhold information they think you 
don’t need to know, or execute commands at the computer without letting you know, so you don’t have 
enough information to follow along. A situation like this must be handled with tact and respect for the 
customer. Here are a few tips:
	 Tip 1. When you can, compliment the customer’s knowledge, experience, or insight.
	 Tip 2. Slow the conversation down. You can say, “Please slow down. You’re moving too fast for me to 
follow. Help me catch up.”
	 Tip 3. Don’t back off from using problem-solving skills. You must still have the customer check the 
simple things, but direct the conversation with tact. For example, you can say, “I know you’ve probably 
already gone over these simple things, but could we just do them again together?”
	 Tip 4. Be careful not to accuse the customer of making a mistake.
	 Tip 5. Even though the customer might be using technical jargon, keep to your policy of not using jargon 
back to the customer unless you’re convinced he truly understands you.
When the Customer Complains
When you are on site or on the phone, a customer might complain to you about your organization, 
products, or service or the service and product of another company. Consider the complaint to be helpful 
feedback that can lead to a better product or service and better customer relationships. Here are a few 
suggestions that can help you handle complaints and defuse customer anger:
	 Suggestion 1. Be an active listener, and let customers know they are not being ignored. Look for the 
underlying problem. Don’t take the complaint or the anger personally.
	 Suggestion 2. Give the customer a little time to vent, and apologize when you can. Then start the 
conversation from the beginning, asking questions, taking notes, and solving problems. Unless you  
must have the information for problem solving, don’t spend a lot of time finding out exactly whom  
the customer dealt with and what happened to upset the customer.
	 Suggestion 3. Don’t be defensive. It’s better to leave the customer with the impression that you and your 
company are listening and willing to admit mistakes. No matter how much anger is expressed, resist the 
temptation to argue or become defensive.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know that it is important to not minimize a customer’s problem 
and to not be judgmental toward a customer.
Notes When solving computer problems in an organization other than your own, check with technical support 
within that organization instead of working only with the user. The user might not be aware of policies that have been 
set on his computer to prevent changes to the OS, hardware, or applications.

	 Suggestion 4. Know how your employer wants you to handle a situation where you are verbally abused. 
If this type of language is happening, you might say something like this in a very calm tone of voice: 
“I’m sorry, but my employer does not require me to accept this kind of talk.”
	 Suggestion 5. If the customer is complaining about a product or service that is not from your company, 
don’t start off by saying, “That’s not our problem.” Instead, listen to the customer complain. Don’t 
appear as though you don’t care.

Culture of Honor
Andy was one of the most intelligent and knowledgeable support technicians in his group working for 
CloudPool, Inc. He was about to be promoted to software engineer and today was his last day on the 
help desk. Sarah, a potential customer with little computer experience, calls asking for help accessing 
the company website. Andy says, “The URL is www dot cloud pool dot com.” Sarah responds, “What’s 
a URL?” Andy’s patience grows thin. He’s thinking to himself, “Oh, help! Just two more hours and I’m off these darn 
phones.” He answers Sarah in a tone of voice that says, hey, I really think you’re an idiot! He says to her, “You know, 
lady! That address box at the top of your browser. Now enter www dot cloud pool dot com!” Sarah gets all flustered 
and intimidated and doesn’t know what to say next. She really wants to know what a browser is, but instead she says, 
“Wait. I’ll just ask someone in the office to help me,” and hangs up the phone.
Discuss the situation with others in a small group and answer these questions:
1.	 If you were Andy’s manager and overheard this call, how would you handle the situation?
2.	 What principles of working with customers does Andy need to keep in mind?
Two students sit back-to-back, one playing the role of Andy and the other playing the role of Sarah. Play out the 
entire conversation. Others in the group can offer suggestions and constructive criticism.

Supporting Customers and Troubleshooting Windows
The Customer Decides When the Work Is Done
When you think you’ve solved the problem, allow the customer to decide when the service is finished to 
his or her satisfaction. For remote support, generally, the customer ends the call or chat session, not the 
technician. If you end the call too soon and the problem is not completely resolved, the customer can be 
frustrated, especially if it is difficult to contact you again.
For on-site work, after you have solved the problem, complete these tasks before you close the call:
1. If you changed anything on the computer after you booted it, reboot one more time to make sure you 
have not caused a problem with the boot.
2. Allow the customer enough time to be fully satisfied that all is working. Does the printer work? Print a 
test page. Does the network connection work? Can the customer sign in to the network and access data 
on it?
3. If you backed up data before working on the problem and then restored the data from backups, ask the 
user to verify that the data is fully restored.
4. Review the service call with the customer. Summarize the instructions and explanations you have given 
during the call. This is an appropriate time to fill out your paperwork and explain to the customer what 
you have written. Then ask if she has any questions.
5. Explain preventive maintenance to the customer (such as deleting temporary files from the hard drive or 
cleaning the mouse). Most customers don’t have preventive maintenance contracts for their computers 
and appreciate the time you take to show them how they can take better care of their equipment. One 
technician keeps a pack of monitor wipes in his toolkit and ends each call by cleaning the customer’s 
monitor screen.
To demonstrate a sincere concern for your customer’s business and that you have owned their problem, 
it’s extremely important to follow up later with the customer and ask if he is still satisfied with your work 
and if he has any more questions. For example, you can say to the customer, “I’ll call you on Monday to 
make sure everything is working and you’re still satisfied with the work.” And then on Monday make that 
call. As you do, you’re building customer loyalty.
Sometimes You Must Escalate a Problem
You are not going to solve every computer problem you encounter. Knowing how to escalate properly so 
the problem is assigned to those higher in the support chain is one of the first things you should learn on 
a new job. Know your company’s policy for escalation. What documents or entries in the call-tracking 
software do you use? Who do you contact? How do you pass the problem on (email, phone call, or an 
online entry in a database)? Do you remain the responsible “support” party, or does the person now 
addressing the problem become the new contact? Are you expected to keep in touch with the customer and 
the problem, or are you totally out of the picture?
When you escalate, let the customer know. Tell the customer you are passing the problem on to someone 
who is more experienced or has access to more extensive resources. If you check back with the customer 
only to find out that the other support person has not called or followed through to the customer’s 
satisfaction, don’t lay blame or point fingers. Just do whatever you can to help within your company 
guidelines. Your call to the customer will go a long way toward helping the situation.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know to follow up with the customer at a later date to verify

Working with Coworkers
Learn to be a professional when working with coworkers. A professional at work is someone who puts 
business matters above personal matters. In big bold letters, I can say the key to being professional is to learn 
to not be personally offended when someone lets you down or does not please you. Remember, most people 
do the best they can considering the business and personal constraints they’re up against. Getting offended 
leads to becoming bitter about others and about your job. Learn to keep negative opinions to yourself, and 
to expect the best of others. When a coworker starts to gossip, try to politely change the subject.
Know your limitations and be willing to admit when you can’t do something. For example, Larry’s boss 
stops by his desk and asks him to accept one more project. Larry already is working many hours overtime 
just to keep up. He needs to politely say to his boss, “I can accept this new project only if you relieve me of 
some of these tasks.”

Ray was new at the corporate help desk that supported hospitals across the nation. He had only had a 
couple of weeks of training before he was turned loose on the phones. He was a little nervous the first 
day he took calls without a mentor sitting beside him. His first call came from Fernanda, a radiology 
technician who was trying to sign in to the network to start the day. When Fernanda entered her 
network ID and passcode, an error message appeared saying her user account was not valid. She told Ray she had tried 
it several times on two different computers. Ray checked his database and found her account, which appeared to be in 
good order. He asked her to try it again. She did and got the same results. In his two weeks of training, this problem 
had never occurred. He told her, “I’m sorry, I don’t know how to solve this problem.” She said, “Okay, well, thank you

Handle Conflict at Work
Jenny works with a team of seven other professionals. Linda, a team member, is a very close personal friend of the boss. With 
the boss’s approval, Linda took a sudden and unexpected two-week vacation to go on a cruise during the team’s most difficult 
month of the year. One team member, Jason, had to work 16 days nonstop, without a day off during Linda’s vacation. Other 
team members soon began complaining and resenting Linda for the unbearable workload her vacation caused them. A few 
weeks back from vacation, Linda began to notice that she was being excluded from informal luncheons and after-work 
gatherings. She confided in Jenny that she could not understand why everyone seemed to be mad at her. Jenny, not wanting 
to cause trouble, said nothing to Linda. In a group of four or five classmates, discuss the answers to the following questions:
1.	 If you were Jenny, what would you do?
2.	 What would you do if you were Linda?
3.	 What would you do if you were Jason?
4.	 What would you do if you were another team member?
5.	 If you were the boss and got wind of the resentment against Linda, what would you do?

Learn to Interact with the User
Rob, an IT service technician, has been called on site to repair a desktop computer. He has not spoken directly with 
the user, Lisa, but he knows the floor of the building where she works and can look for her name on her cubicle. The 
following is a description of his actions. Create a table with two columns. List in one column the mistakes he makes in 
the following description, and in the next column describe the correct actions he should have taken.
Rob’s company promised that a service technician would come sometime during the next business day after the call 
was received. Rob was given the name and address of the user and the problem, which was stated as “PC will not boot.” 
Rob arrived the following day at about 10:00 a.m. He found Lisa’s cubicle, but she was not present. Because Lisa was not 
present, Rob decided not to disturb the papers all over her desk, so he laid his notebooks and tools on top of her work.
Rob tried to boot the computer, and it gave errors indicating a corrupted file system on the hard drive. He success-
fully booted from a DVD and was able to access a directory list of drive C:. The list was corrupted and jumbled and he 
realized most of the files were corrupted. Next, Rob used a recovery utility to try to recover the files and directories 
but was unable to do so. He began to suspect that a virus had caused the problem, so he ran a virus scan program that 
did not find the suspected virus.
He made a call to his technical support to ask for suggestions. Technical support suggested he try erasing every-
thing on the hard drive to remove any possible viruses and then reinstall Windows. Rob cleaned everything off the 
hard drive and was on the phone with technical support, in the process of reloading Windows from the company’s file 
server, when Lisa arrived.
Lisa took one look at her computer and gasped. She caught her breath and asked where her data was. Rob replied, 
“A virus destroyed your hard drive. I had to reformat.”
Lisa tried to explain the importance of the destroyed data. Rob replied, “Guess you’ll learn to make backups now.” 
Lisa left to find her manager.

Now let’s turn our attention to general strategies and tips that can help you troubleshoot any computer 
problem.
Strategies to Troubleshoot Any Computer Problem
When a computer doesn’t work and you’re responsible for fixing it, you should generally 
approach the problem first as an investigator and discoverer, always being careful not to 
compound the problem through your own actions. If the problem seems difficult, see it as an 
opportunity to learn something new. Ask questions until you understand the source of the 
problem. Once you understand it, you’re almost done because most likely the solution will be evident. If 
you take the attitude that you can understand the problem and solve it, no matter how deeply you have to 
dig, you probably will solve it.
One systematic method to solve a problem used by most expert troubleshooters is the six steps 
diagrammed in Figure 12-10, which can apply to both software and hardware problems.

Strategies to Troubleshoot Any Computer Problem

Here are the steps:
1. Interview the user and back up data before you make any changes to the system.
2. Examine the system, analyze the problem, and make an initial determination of what is the source of the 
problem.
3. Test your theory. If the theory is not confirmed, form another theory or escalate the problem to someone 
higher in your organization with more experience or resources.
4. After you know the source of the problem, plan what to do to fix the problem and then fix it.
5. Verify the problem is fixed and that the system works. Take any preventive measures to make sure the 
problem doesn’t happen again.
6. Document activities, outcomes, and what you learned.
Now let’s examine the process step-by-step. As you learn about these six steps, you’ll also learn about  
13 rules useful when troubleshooting. Here’s the first rule.
Rule 1: Approach the Problem Systematically
When trying to solve the problem, start at the beginning and walk through the situation in a thorough, careful 
way. This one rule is invaluable. Remember it and apply it every time. If you don’t find the explanation to the 
problem after one systematic walkthrough, then repeat the entire process. Check and double-check to find the 
step you overlooked the first time. Most problems with computers are simple, such as a loose cable or incorrect 
Windows setting. Computers are logical through and through. Whatever the problem is, it’s also very logical. Also, 
if you are faced with more than one problem on the same computer, work on only one problem at a time. Trying 
to solve multiple problems at the same time can get too confusing.
Step 1: Interview the User and Back up Data
Every troubleshooting situation begins with interviewing the user if he or she is available. 
If you have the opportunity to speak with the user, ask questions to help you identify the 
problem, how to reproduce it, and possible sources of the problem. Also ask about any data 
on the hard drive that is not backed up.
A+  
220-902 
5.5
Here are some questions that can help you learn as much as you can about the problem and its root cause:
1. Please describe the problem. What error messages, unusual displays, or failures did you see? (Possible 
answer: I see this blue screen with a funny-looking message on it that makes no sense to me.)
2. When did the problem start? (Possible answer: When I first booted after loading this neat little 
screen saver I downloaded from the web.)
3. What was the situation when the problem occurred? (Possible answers: I was trying to start up my 
laptop. I was opening a document in Microsoft Word. I was using the web to research a project.)
4. What programs or software were you using? (Possible answer: I was using Internet Explorer.)
5. What changes have recently been made to the system? For example, did you recently install new 
software or move your computer system? (Possible answer: Well, yes. Yesterday I moved the computer 
case across the room.)
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know how to interact with a user and know what questions to 
ask, given a troubleshooting scenario.

Supporting Customers and Troubleshooting Windows
  6. Has there been a recent thunderstorm or electrical problem? (Possible answer: Yes, last night. Then 
when I tried to turn on my computer this morning, nothing happened.)
  7. Have you made any hardware, software, or configuration changes? (Possible answer: No, but I think my 
sister might have.)
  8. Has someone else used your computer recently? (Possible answer: Sure, my son uses it all the time.)
  9. Is there some valuable data on your system that is not backed up that I should know about before I start 
working on the problem? (Possible answer: Yes! Yes! My term paper! It’s not backed up! You gotta save 
that!)
10. Can you show me how to reproduce the problem? (Possible answers: Yes, let me show you what to do.)
Based on the answers you receive, ask more penetrating questions until you feel the user has given you 
all the information he or she knows that can help you solve the problem. As you talk with the user, keep in 
mind rules 2, 3, and 4.
Rule 2: Establish Your Priorities
This rule can help make for a satisfied customer. Decide what your first priority is. For example, it might be to 
recover lost data or to get the computer back up and running as soon as possible. When practical, ask the user or 
customer for help deciding on priorities.
Rule 3: Beware of User Error
Remember that many problems stem from user error. If you suspect this is the case, ask the user to show you the 
problem and carefully watch what the user is doing.
Rule 4: Keep Your Cool and Don’t Rush
In some situations, you might be tempted to act too quickly and to be drawn into the user’s sense of emergency. 
But keep your cool and don’t rush. For example, when a computer stops working, if unsaved data is still in 
memory or if data on the hard drive has not been backed up, look and think carefully before you leap! A wrong 
move can be costly. The best advice is not to hurry. Carefully plan your moves. Research the problem using 
documentation or the web if you’re not sure what to do, and don’t hesitate to ask for help. Don’t simply try 
something, hoping it will work, unless you’ve run out of more intelligent alternatives!
After you have talked with the user, be sure to back up any important data that is not currently backed 
up before you begin work on the computer. If the computer is working well enough to boot to the 
Windows desktop, you can use File Explorer or Windows Explorer to copy data to a flash drive, another 
computer on the network, or other storage media.
If the computer is not healthy enough to use Explorer, don’t do anything to jeopardize the data. If you 
must take a risk with the data, let it be the user’s decision to do so, not yours. Try to boot the system. If the 
system will not boot to the Windows desktop, know that you can remove the hard drive from the system 
and use a converter to connect the drive to a USB port on another computer. You can then copy the data to 
the other computer. Next, return the hard drive to the original computer so you can begin troubleshooting 
the problem.

changes to a system.

If possible, have the user verify that all important data is safely backed up before you continue to the next 
troubleshooting step. If you’re new to troubleshooting and don’t want the user looking over your shoulder 
while you work, you might want to let him or her know you’d prefer to work alone. You can say something 
like, “Okay, I think I have everything I need to get started. I’ll let you know if I have another question.”
Step 2: Examine the System and Make Your Best Guess
You’re now ready to start solving the problem. Rules 5 and 6 can help.
A+  
220-902 
5.5
Follow this process to form your best guess (best theory) and test it:
1. Reproduce the problem and observe for yourself what the user has described. For example, if the user 
tells you the system is totally dead, find out for yourself. Plug in the power and turn on the system. 
Listen for fans and look for lights and error messages. Suppose the user tells you that Internet Explorer 
will not open. Try opening it yourself to see what error messages might appear. As you investigate the 
system, refrain from making changes until you’ve come up with your theory as to what the source of the 
problem is. Can you duplicate the problem? Intermittent problems are generally more difficult to solve 
than problems that occur consistently.
2. Decide if the problem is hardware or software related. Sometimes you might not be sure, but make your 
best guess. For example, if the system fails before Windows starts to load, chances are the problem is a 
hardware problem. If the user tells you the system has not worked since the lightning storm the night 
before, chances are the problem is electrical. If the problem is that Explorer will not open even though 
the Windows desktop loads, you can assume the problem is software related. In another example, sup-
pose a user complains that his Word documents are getting corrupted. Possible sources of the prob-
lem might be that the user does not know how to save documents properly, the application or the OS 
might be corrupted, the computer might have a virus, or the hard drive might be intermittently failing. 
Investigate for yourself, and then decide if the problem is caused by software, hardware, or the user.
3. Make your best guess as to the source of the problem, and don’t forget to question the obvious. Here are 
some practical examples of questioning the obvious and checking the simple things first:
	The video doesn’t work. Your best guess is the monitor cables are loose or the monitor is not turned on.
	Excel worksheets are getting corrupted. Your best guess is the user is not saving the workbook files 
correctly.
	The DVD drive is not reading a DVD. Your best guess is the DVD is scratched.
Rule 5: Make No Assumptions
This rule is the hardest to follow because there is a tendency to trust anything in writing and assume that people 
are telling you exactly what happened. But documentation is sometimes wrong, and people don’t always describe 
events as they occurred, so do your own investigating. For example, if the user tells you that the system boots up 
with no error messages but that the software still doesn’t work, boot for yourself. You never know what the user 
might have overlooked.
Rule 6: Try the Simple Things First
Most problems are so simple and obvious that we overlook them because we expect the problem to be difficult. 
Don’t let the complexity of computers fool you. Most problems are easy to fix. Really, they are! To save time, 
check the simple things first, such as whether a power switch is not turned on or a cable is loose. Generally, it’s 
easy to check for a hardware problem before you check for a software problem. For example, if a USB drive is not 
working, verify the drive works on another computer before verifying the drivers are installed correctly.

566
Supporting Customers and Troubleshooting Windows
	The system refuses to boot and gives the error that the hard drive is not found. Your best guess is 
internal cables to the drive are loose.
Rule 7: Become a Researcher
Following this rule is the most fun. When a computer problem arises that you can’t easily solve, be as tenacious 
as a bulldog. Search the web, ask questions, read more, make some phone calls, and ask more questions. Take 
advantage of every available resource, including online help, documentation, technical support, and books such 
as this one. Learn to perform advanced searches using a good search engine on the web, such as www.google.com. 
What you learn will be yours to take to the next problem. This is the real joy of computer troubleshooting. If 
you’re good at it, you’re always learning something new.
If you’re having a problem deciding what might be the source of the problem, keep in mind Rule 7 and 
try searching these resources for ideas and tips:
	The specific application, operating system, or hardware you support must be available to you to test, 
observe, and study and to use to re-create a customer’s problem whenever possible.
	In a corporate setting, hardware and software products generally have technical documentation availa-
ble. If you don’t find it on hand, know that you are likely to find user manuals and technical support 
manuals as .pdf files that can be downloaded from the product manufacturers’ websites. These sites 
might offer troubleshooting and support pages, help forums, chat sessions, email support, and links to 
submit a troubleshooting ticket to the manufacturer (see Figure 12-11). For Windows problems, the best 
websites to search are technet.microsoft.com or support.microsoft.com.
Figure 12-11  Search manufacturer websites for help with a hardware or software product
Source: Techsmith Corporation
	Use a search engine to search the web for help. In your search string, include an error message, symptom, 
hardware device, or description of the problem. The chances are always good that someone has had exactly 
the same problem, presented the problem online, and someone else has presented a step-by-step solution. All 
you have to do is find it! As you practice this type of web research, you’ll get better and better at knowing 
how to form a search string and which websites are trustworthy and present the best information. If your 
first five minutes of searching doesn’t turn up a solution, please don’t give up! It might take patience and 
searching for 20 minutes or more to find the solution you need. As you search, most likely you’ll learn more 
and more about the problem, and you’ll slowly zero in on a solution.

	Some companies offer an expert system for troubleshooting. An expert system is software that is designed 
and written to help solve problems. It uses databases of known facts and rules to simulate human 
experts’ reasoning and decision making. Expert systems for IT technicians work by posing questions 
about a problem to be answered by the technician or the customer. The response to each question triggers 
another question from the software until the expert system arrives at a possible solution or solutions. 
Many expert systems are “intelligent,” meaning the system will record your input and use it in subsequent 
sessions to select more questions to ask and approaches to try. Therefore, future troubleshooting sessions 
on this same type of problem tend to zero in more quickly toward a solution.
Step 3: Test Your Theory
For simple problems, you can zip right through Steps 3, 4, and 5 in Figure 12-10. Here are  
two examples where Steps 3, 4, and 5 go very fast:
  The video does not work and you suspect loose cables or the monitor is not turned on. You 
check the video cable connection (Step 3) and discover it’s loose. As you connect it (Step 4), 
the video display works. Problem solved. You now can take the time to screw the video cable to the 
connection (Step 5) so that the problem won’t happen again.
	Excel worksheets are getting corrupted. As you watch the user save a file, you discover he is saving files 
in an incorrect format that other software in the office cannot read (Step 3). You step the user through 
saving the file correctly and then verify that others can open the file (Step 4). You explain to the user 
which format to use (Step 5). The problem is then solved, and it’s not likely to happen again.
Here are two examples of Step 3 that include testing a guess that is not correct:
	The optical drive won’t read a DVD and you suspect the DVD is scratched. When you check the disc, it 
looks fine. Your next guess is the optical drive is not recognized by Windows. You check Device 
Manager, and it reports errors with the drive. Your next guess is that drivers are corrupted.
	The system refuses to boot and gives the error message that the hard drive is not found. Internal cable 
connections are solid. Your next guess is the drive is not getting power.
Here are two examples of Step 3 where your guess is correct, and then you move on toward Step 4 to 
plan a solution:
	Word files are getting corrupted. After eliminating several simple causes, you guess that the hard drive is 
going bad. You check Event Viewer and discover Windows has recorded write errors to the drive multiple 
times (Step 3). Your theory is confirmed that the drive is bad and needs replacing (Step 4).
	The video display does not work. You check cables and power and verify monitor settings controlled by 
buttons on the front of the monitor are all okay, but still no video. You guess the video cable might be 
bad and exchange it with one you know is good, but still no video. Therefore, you guess that the moni-
tor is bad. You move the monitor to a working computer and it still does not work. You try a good 
monitor on the first computer, and it works fine. Your guess that the monitor is bad has been confirmed 
(Step 3). Next, you plan how to purchase a new monitor (Step 4).
As you test your guesses, keep in mind rules 8 through 11.

Rule 8: Divide and Conquer
This rule is the most powerful. Isolate the problem. In the overall system, remove one hardware or software 
component after another until the problem is isolated to a small part of the whole system. As you divide a large 
problem into smaller components, you can analyze each component separately. You can use one or more of the 
following to help you divide and conquer:
	In Windows, perform a clean boot to eliminate all nonessential startup programs and services as a possible 
source of the problem.
	Boot from a bootable DVD or flash drive to eliminate the Windows installation and the hard drive as the problem.
Rule 9: Write Things Down
Keep good notes as you’re working. They’ll help you think more clearly. Draw diagrams. Make lists. Clearly and 
precisely write down what you’re learning. If you need to leave the problem and return to it later, it’s difficult 
to remember what you have observed and already tried. When the problem gets cold like this, your notes will be 
invaluable.
Rule 10: Don’t Assume the Worst
When it’s an emergency and your only copy of data is on a hard drive that is not working, don’t assume that 
the data is lost. Much can be done to recover data. If you want to recover lost data on a hard drive, don’t write 
anything to the drive; you might write on top of lost data, eliminating all chances of recovery.
Rule 11: Reboot and Start Over
This is an important rule. Fresh starts are good, and they uncover events or steps that might have been 
overlooked. Take a break! Get away from the problem. Begin again.
By the time you have finished Step 3, the problem might already be solved or you will know the source 
of the problem and will be ready to plan a solution.
Step 4: Plan Your Solution and Then Fix the Problem
Some solutions, such as replacing a hard drive or a motherboard, are expensive and time 
consuming. You need to carefully consider what you will do and the order in which you will 
do it. When planning and implementing your solution, keep rules 12 and 13 in mind.
A+  
220-902 
5.5
Rule 12: Use the Least Invasive Solution First
As you solve computer problems, always keep in mind that you don’t want to make things worse, so you should 
use the least invasive solution. Keep in mind that you want to fix the problem in such a way that the system 
is returned to normal working condition with the least amount of effort and least changes to the system. For 
example, don’t format the hard drive until you’ve first tried to fix the problem without having to erase everything 
on the drive. In another example, don’t reinstall Microsoft Office until you have tried applying patches to the 
existing installation.
Rule 13: Know Your Starting Point
Find out what works and doesn’t work before you take anything apart or try some possible fix. Suppose you 
decide to install a new anti-malware program. After the installation, you discover Microsoft Office gives errors and 
you cannot print to the network printer. You don’t know if the anti-malware program is causing problems or the 
problems existed before you began work. As much as possible, find out what works or what doesn’t work before 
you attempt a fix.

Strategies to Troubleshoot Any Computer Problem
12
Do the following to plan your solution and fix the problem:
1. Consider different solutions and select the least invasive one.
2. Before applying your solution, as best you can, determine what works and doesn’t work about the sys-
tem so you know your starting point.
3. Fix the problem. This might be as simple as plugging up a new monitor. Or it might be as difficult as 
reinstalling Windows and applications software and restoring data from backups.
Step 5: Verify the Fix and Take Preventive Action
After you have fixed the problem, reboot the system and verify all is well. Can you reach the Internet, 
use the printer, or use Microsoft Office? If possible, have the user check everything and verify that 
the job is done satisfactorily. If either of you finds a problem, return to Step 2 in the troubleshooting 
process to examine the system and form a new theory as to the cause of the problem.
After you and the user have verified all is working, ask yourself the question, “Could this problem have 
been prevented?” If so, go the extra mile to instruct the user, set Windows to automatically install updates, 
or do whatever else is appropriate to prevent future problems.
Step 6: Document What Happened
Good documentation helps you take what you learned into the next troubleshooting situation, 
train others, develop effective preventive maintenance plans, and satisfy any audits or customer 
or employer queries about your work. Most companies use call tracking software for this 
purpose. Be sure to include initial symptoms, the source of the problem, and what you did to 
fix it. Make the notes detailed enough so that you can use them later when solving similar problems.
For on-site support, a customer expects documentation about your services. Include in the 
documentation sufficient details broken down by cost of individual parts, hours worked, and cost per hour. 
Give the documentation to the customer at the end of the service and keep a copy for yourself. For phone 
support, the documentation stays in-house.

TAKE Good Notes
Daniel had not been a good note taker in school, and this lack of skill was affecting his work. His manager, 
Jonathan, had been watching Daniel’s notes in the ticketing system at the help desk he worked on and was not 
happy with what he saw. Jonathan had pointed out to Daniel more than once that his cryptic notes with sketchy 
information would one day cause major problems. On Monday morning, calls were hammering the help desk because 
a server had gone down over the weekend and many internal customers were not able to get to their data. Daniel escalated one call 
from a customer named Matt to a tier-two help desk. Later that day, Sandra, a tier-two technician, received the escalated ticket, and 
to her dismay the phone number of the customer was missing. She called Daniel. “How am I to call this customer? You only have his 
first name, and these notes about the problem don’t even make sense!” Daniel apologized to Sandra, but the damage was done.
Two days later, an angry Matt calls the manager of the help desk to complain that his problem is still not solved. 
Jonathan listens to Matt vent and apologizes for the problem his help desk has caused. It’s a little embarrassing to 
Jonathan to have to ask Matt for his call-back information and to repeat the details of the problem. He gives the 
information to Sandra and the problem gets a quick resolution.
Discuss this situation in a small group and answer the following questions:
1.	 If you were Daniel, what could you do to improve note taking in the ticketing system?
2.	 After Sandra called, do you think Daniel should have told Jonathan about the problem? Why or why not?
3.	 If you were Jonathan, how would you handle the situation with Daniel?
Two students play the role of Daniel and Jonathan when Jonathan calls Daniel into his office to discuss the call he just 
received from Matt. The other students in the group can watch and make suggestions as to how to improve the conversation.

Document an Intermittent Problem
Intermittent problems can make troubleshooting challenging. The trick in diagnosing problems that come and go is 
to look for patterns or clues as to when the problems occur. If you or the user can’t reproduce the problem at will, ask 
the user to keep a log of when the problems occur and exactly what messages appear. Tell the user that intermittent 
problems are the hardest to solve and might take some time, but you won’t give up. Show the user how to take a 
screen shot of the error messages when they appear. It might also be appropriate to ask him to email the screen shot 
to you. Do the following:
1.	 Use the Windows 8/7 Snipping Tool to take a snip of your Windows desktop showing the Task Manager window 
open. If you need help using the Snipping Tool, see Windows Help and Support.
2.	 Save the snip and email it to your instructor.

Troubleshooting Applications
12
With tons of information in hand about serving customers and solving problems, let’s dig into some 
actual troubleshooting.
Troubleshooting Applications
A problem with an application might be caused by the application, the hardware, the 
operating system, the data, other applications in conflict with this one, or the user. We begin 
this part of the chapter by looking at some general steps to help you solve a problem with 
an application. We then look at some Windows tools to help you solve application problems, 
and some specific error messages and what to do about them.

General Steps for Solving Application Errors
This section covers a variety of steps you can take to try to solve a problem with an application. 
As you work your way through these steps, keep in mind where each step fits in the overall 
strategy given earlier in the chapter for solving any computer problem.
A+  
220-902 
4.1
Step 1: Interview the User and Back up Data
Worth saying again: Start with interviewing the user:
1. Interview the user and back up data. Find out as much information as you can from the user about the 
problem, when it started, and what happened to the system around the time the problem started. Also 
ask if valuable data is on the system. If so, back it up.
2. Ask the user to reproduce the problem while you watch. Many problems with applications are caused 
by user error. Watch carefully as the user shows you the problem. If you see him making a mistake, be 
tactful as you explain the problem and its solution.
3. Try a reboot. Reboots solve a lot of application problems and one might be a shortcut to your solution. If 
that doesn’t work, no harm is done and you’re ready to begin investigating the system.
Step 2: Error Messages, the Web, Coworkers, and Logs Might Help
Windows might display an error message and offer a solution. Logs kept by Windows can offer clues. Here 
are a few examples of how to get help from Windows, the web, and coworkers:
	View error messages in the Action Center. The Action Center tracks problems with applications, hardware, 
and Windows (see Figure 12-12). In the Action Center, click View archived messages to see a history of 
past problems and double-click a problem to read the details about it.
Notes As you are troubleshooting a problem and make a change to the system, be sure to restart Windows and 
check to see if the problem is resolved before you move on to the next fix.

Supporting Customers and Troubleshooting Windows
	Use Event Viewer and Reliability Monitor to look for clues. The Event Viewer logs might give clues 
about applications and the system. Hard drive errors often appear as application errors. Use Reliability 
Monitor to look for errors with other applications or with key hardware components such as the hard 
drive. You learned to use both tools in the chapter, “Optimizing Windows.”
	Find and ask for help. You might find more information about a problem by searching the website of the 
application manufacturer for support and help. Also, search the web on the error message, application, or 
description of the problem. Look for forums where others have posted the same problem with the same 
app. Someone else has likely posted a solution. However, be careful and don’t take the advice unless you 
trust the website. After you’ve made a reasonable effort to find help on your own, ask for help from 
coworkers who are more experienced.
Figure 12-12  Windows 8 suggests disabling some startup applications to increase the system's performance
Step 3: Consider the Data or the Application Is Corrupted
Now that you’ve interviewed the user, backed up important data, examined the system, and investigated 
the problem, it’s time to come up with a theory as to the cause of the problem. Consider and do these 
things:
	Consider data corruption. For applications that use data files such as Microsoft Office, it might appear 
that the application has a problem when the problem is really a corrupted data file. Try creating an 
entirely new data file. If that works, then suspect that previous errors might be caused by corrupted 
data. You might be able to recover part of a corrupted file by changing its file extension to .txt and 
importing it into the application as a text file.
	Check application settings for errors. Maybe a user has made one too many changes to the application 
settings, which can cause a problem with missing toolbars and other functions. Write down each 
setting the user has changed and then restore all settings back to their default values. If the problem

cian to appear confident and in charge. To maintain your customer’s confidence in your technical abilities, you might 
want to find privacy when searching the web or talking with coworkers.

is solved, restore each setting to the way the user had it until you find the one causing the problem. 
The process will take some time, but users can get upset if you change their application settings 
without justification.
	Repair the application. The application setup might have the option to repair the installation. Look for 
it in the Programs and Features window, on the setup disc for the application, or on the manufacturer’s 
website.
	Uninstall and reinstall the application. Do so with caution because you might lose any customized set-
tings, macros, or scripts. Also know this still might not solve a problem with a corrupted application 
because registry entries might not be properly reset during the uninstall process.
Step 4: Consider Outside Interference
The problem might be caused by a virus, Windows, other applications, or hardware. Check these things:
	A virus might be causing the problem. Scan for viruses and check Task Manager to make sure some 
strange process is not interfering with your applications.
	The computer might be low on system resources or another application might be interfering. Close all 
other applications.
	Maybe a service failed to start. Research the application documentation and find out if the app relies on 
a service to work. Use the Services console to make sure the service has started. If the service has failed 
to start, make sure it has an Automatic or Manual setting.
	The problem might be bad memory. Following the directions given later in this chapter, use the Memory 
Diagnostics tool (mdsched.exe) to test memory. If it finds errors, replace the memory modules.
	The problem might be a corrupted hard drive. To eliminate the hard drive as the source of an application 
error, use the chkdsk command with the /r parameter to check the drive and recover data in bad sectors.
	A background program or other software might be conflicting with the application. To eliminate com-
patibility issues with other software, run the application after a clean boot. You learned to perform a 
clean boot in the chapter, “Optimizing Windows.” Recall a clean boot eliminates third-party software 
from starting during the boot. If a clean boot allows the application to run without errors, you need to 
methodically disable each third-party program one-by-one until you discover the one in conflict.
Step 5: Consider Windows Might Be the Problem
A problem with an application can sometimes be solved by updating or restoring Windows system files.  
Do the following:
	Download Windows updates. Make sure all critical and important Windows updates are installed. 
Microsoft Office updates are included in Windows updates.
	Use System File Checker. For essential hardware devices, use the System File Checker (SFC), which is 
covered later in this section, to verify and replace system files. Use the command sfc /scannow.
	Boot Windows in Safe Mode. Safe Mode loads Windows with a minimum configuration and can create 
a stable environment when Windows gets corrupted. It goes beyond a clean boot in that it eliminates 
third-party software from launching at the boot and also reduces Windows startup processes to only 
those essential to launch Windows. There are several ways to start Safe Mode, which you learn about in 
the chapter, “Troubleshooting Windows Startup.” One way is to use System Configuration. Enter 
msconfig.exe in the Windows 8 Run box or the Windows 7 Search box to open the System 
Configuration window and click the Boot tab. Check Safe boot (see Figure 12-13). If the application 
needs the Internet to work, select Network. Click OK and restart the system.

Chapter 12
574
Supporting Customers and Troubleshooting Windows
	
If the application works in Safe Mode, you can assume the problem is not with the application but 
with the operating system, device drivers, or other software that loads at startup. To return the system 
to a normal startup, open System Configuration again and click Normal startup on the General tab.
	Use System Restore. If you can identify the approximate date the error started and that date is in the 
recent past, use System Restore (rstrui.exe). Select a restore point just before the problem started. 
Reverting to a restore point can solve problems with registry entries the application uses that have 
become corrupted. However, System Restore can cause problems of its own, so use it with caution.
Figure 12-13  Restart Windows in a Safe boot with minimal Windows configuration
Now let’s learn to use the Memory Diagnostics and System File Checker tools, which can be useful when 
troubleshooting application problems.
Memory Diagnostics
Errors with memory are often difficult to diagnose because they can appear intermittently and 
might be mistaken as application errors, user errors, or other hardware component errors. 
Sometimes these errors cause the system to hang, a BSOD (blue screen of death) error might 
occur, or the system continues to function with applications giving errors or data getting

Caution
When researching a problem, suppose you discover that Microsoft or a manufacturer’s website offers a fix 
or patch you can download and apply. To get the right patch, recall you need to make sure you get a 32-bit patch for a 
32-bit installation of Windows, a device driver, or an application. For a 64-bit installation of Windows, make sure you get a 
64-bit device driver. An application installed in a 64-bit OS might be a 32-bit application or a 64-bit application.

expects you to know the program name of that utility.

corrupted. You can quickly identify a problem with memory or eliminate memory as the source of a 
problem by using the Windows Memory Diagnostics (mdsched.exe) tool. It works before Windows is 
loaded to test memory for errors, and can be used on computers that don’t have Windows installed. Use 
one of these two methods to start the utility:
	Method 1. In a command prompt window on the Windows desktop, enter mdsched.exe and press Enter. 
A dialog box appears (see Figure 12-14) asking if you want to run the test now or on the next restart.
Figure 12-14  Use the mdsched.exe command to test memory
	Method 2. If you cannot boot from the hard drive, boot the computer from the Windows setup DVD 
or some other recovery media such as a Windows 8 recovery drive or a Windows 7 repair disc. (You 
learn more about these options in the chapter, “Troubleshooting Windows Startup.”) On the opening 
screen, select your language. On the next screen (see Figure 12-15), click Repair your computer.

and press Enter.
	For Windows 7, select the Windows installation to repair. On the System Recovery Options screen 
(see Figure 12-16), click Windows Memory Diagnostic and follow the directions on screen.
Figure 12-16  Test memory using the Windows 7 System Recovery Options menu
If the tool reports memory errors, replace all memory modules installed on the motherboard.
System File Checker
A Windows application or hardware problem might be caused by a corrupted Windows 
system file. That’s where System File Checker might help. System File Checker (SFC) protects 
system files and keeps a cache of current system files in case it needs to refresh a damaged 
file. To use the utility to scan all system files and verify them, first close all applications and 
then enter the command sfc /scannow in an elevated command prompt window (see Figure 12-17). If 
corrupted system files are found, you might need to provide the Windows setup DVD to restore the files. 
If you have problems running the SFC utility, boot the computer into Safe Mode and run the sfc /scannow 
command again in Safe Mode. If you still have problems, know that you will learn more about repairing 
system files in the chapter, “Troubleshooting Windows Startup.”

Responding to Specific Error Messages
In this part of the chapter, we look at some specific error messages that relate to problems with 
applications.
When an Application Hangs
If an application is locked up and not responding, use Task Manager to end it. If Task Manager can’t end a 
process, use the tasklist and taskkill commands. The tasklist command returns the process identifier (PID), 
which is a number that identifies each running process. The taskkill command uses the process ID to kill 
the process. Using Notepad as a sample application, do the following:
1. Open a command prompt window and start Notepad with the command notepad.exe. Be sure the 
Notepad window and the command prompt window are positioned so both are visible on your screen. 
Use the tasklist | more command to get a list of processes currently running (press the Spacebar to 
scroll to the next page). Note the PID of the Notepad process, for example, 7132.
2. Enter the command taskkill /f /pid:7132, using the PID you noted in Step 1. The /f parameter 
forcefully kills the process. Be careful using this command; it is so powerful that you can end critical 
system processes that will cause the system to shut down.
When a File Fails to Open
Windows depends on the file extension to associate a data file with an application used to open it, which it 
calls the file association. An application associated with a file extension is called its default program. When 
you double-click a data file and Windows examines the file extension and doesn’t know which application 
to call on to open the file, it displays an error message. The solution to this problem is to change the file 
association for the data file’s file extension.

Associate a file type or protocol with a program. The list of current associations appears in the Set 
Associations window.
2.	 Select the file extension you want to change (see Figure 12-20) and click Change program. A dialog box 
appears asking how you want to open the file (as shown in the middle of Figure 12-20).
Figure 12-20  Select the default program to associate with a file extension
3.	 The box displays installed programs that can handle the selected file extension. If you don’t see the program 
you want, click More options and scroll to the bottom of the list. Then click Look for another app on this PC 
(in Windows 7, click Browse) to find it in the Program Files or Program Files (x86) folder on your hard drive. 
Otherwise, make your selection (and in Windows 7, click OK). Then close all windows.
When a Service Fails to Start
A message about a service failing to start can be caused by a corrupted or missing service program, or the 
service might not be configured to launch at startup. Recall from the “Optimizing Windows” chapter that 
you can use the Services console (services.msc) to enable, disable, start, or stop a service. A service can be 
disabled at startup using the System Configuration tool (msconfig.exe), and Task Manager (taskmgr.exe) 
can give you a list of all running services.
If you get an error message that a service has failed to start, check the Services console to make sure the 
service is set to start automatically. Make sure the Startup type is set to Automatic or Automatic (Delayed 
Start). Use the service’s Properties box in the console to find the path and file name to the executable 
program. Then use Explorer to make sure the program file is not missing. You might need to reinstall the 
service or the application that uses the service.
When a DLL Is Missing or a Component Is Not Registered
Most applications have a main program file that uses a collection of many small programs called 
components or objects that serve the main program. The main program for an application has an .exe file 
extension and relies on several component services that often have a .dll file extension. (DLL stands for

Dynamic Link Library.) Problems with applications can be caused by a missing DLL program or a broken 
association between the main program and a component.
If you get an error message about a missing DLL, the easiest way to solve this problem might be to 
reinstall the application. However, if that is not advisable, you can identify the path and name of the 
missing DLL file and recover it from backup or from the application installation files.
On the other hand, the file might be present and undamaged, but the application cannot find it because 
the relationship between the two is broken. Relationships between a main program and its components 
are normally established by entries in the registry when the application is installed. The process is called 
registering a component. In addition, the Component Services (also called COM+) tool, which is a 
Microsoft Management Console snap-in, can be used to register components. The tool is often used by 
application developers and system administrators when developing and deploying an application. For 
example, a system administrator might use COM+ when installing an application on servers or client 
computers where an application on one computer calls an application on another computer on the 
network. COM+ is more automated than the older and more manual Regsvr32 utility that is also used to 
register component services.
The regsvr32.exe program requires an elevated command prompt. Note in Figure 12-21, the first 
regsvr32 command uses the /u parameter to unregister a component. The second regsvr32 command 
registers the component again. Also notice that you need to include the path to the DLL file in the 
command line.
Figure 12-21  Use the regsvr32 command to register or unregister an application component
As an IT support technician, you might be asked by a system administrator or software provider to use 
the COM+ or Regsvr32 tool to help solve a problem with an application giving errors. Suppose you get 
this error when installing an application:
Error 1928 “Error registering COM+ application.”
When you contact the help desk of the application provider, you might be instructed to use the COM+ 
tool to solve the problem. To open the tool, open Control Panel and click Administrative Tools, then 
double-click Component Services. The Component Services window is shown in Figure 12-22. To learn 
how to use the tool, click Help in the menu bar.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know how to handle missing DLL errors and to know when it’s 
appropriate to use the Component Services and Regsvr32.

When the Application Has Never Worked
If the application has never worked, follow these steps:
1. Update Windows and search the web. Installing all important and critical Windows updates can some-
times solve a problem with an application that won’t install. Also check the website of the software 
manufacturer and the Microsoft support site (support.microsoft.com) for solutions. Search on the appli-
cation name or the error message you get when you try to run it.
2. Run the installation program or application as an administrator. The program might require that the 
user have privileges not assigned to the current user account. Try running the application with adminis-
trator privileges, which Windows calls a secondary logon. If the installation has failed, use Explorer to 
locate the installation executable file. Right-click it and select Run as administrator from the shortcut 
menu (see Figure 12-23).
Figure 12-22  Use the Component Services window to register components used by an application
Figure 12-23  Execute a program using administrative privileges
Notes To run a program using a user account other than administrator, hold down the Shift key and right-click the 
program file. Then select Run as different user from the shortcut menu. You must then enter the user name and password 
of another user account in the Windows Security box.

If the application has failed after it is installed, locate the installed program. Look for it in a subfolder of 
the Program Files or Program Files (x86) folder. If the program works when you run it with administrative 
privileges, you can make that setting permanent. To do so, right-click it and select Properties from the 
shortcut menu. Then click the Compatibility tab and check Run this program as an administrator (see 
Figure 12-24). Click Apply and then close the Properties box.
3. Consider whether an older application is having compatibility problems with Windows. Some older 
applications cannot run under Windows 8 or they run with errors. Here are some steps you can take to 
fix the problem:
Figure 12-24  Permanently change the privilege level of an 
application
a.	Go to the Windows Compatibility Center 
site at www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/
compatibility/CompatCenter/Home and 
search for the application. The site reports 
problems and solutions for known legacy 
software. For example, search on the 
application WinPatrol, then under the 
Compatible with menu, click Windows 
8.1. You find that Microsoft recommends 
Version 25 or 28 for Windows 8.1 (see 
Figure 12-25). Use the 32-bit or 64-bit type 
appropriate for your system. If the version 
and type you are using are not compatible, 
try to replace or upgrade the software.
b.	Try running the application in compatibility 
mode. To do that, on the Compatibility 
tab of the program file Properties box 
shown earlier in Figure 12-24, check Run 
this program in compatibility mode for:. 
Then, from the drop-down menu, select the 
operating system that the application was 
written to run under. Click Apply and close 
the Properties box.

4. Verify that the application is digitally signed. Although applications that are not digitally signed can still 
run on Windows, a digital signature does verify that the application is not a rogue application and that it 
is certified as Windows-compatible by Microsoft. To view the digital signature, select the Digital Signatures 
tab of the program file’s Properties box. Select a signer in the list and click Details (see Figure 12-26). If the 
Digital Signatures tab is missing, the program is not digitally signed.

OS Differences For Windows 7 Professional, Ultimate, or Enterprise editions, try running the program in Windows 
XP Mode. Recall from the chapter, “Installing Windows,” that Windows XP Mode can be used to install XP in a virtual 
machine under Windows 7. Applications installed in XP Mode work in the XP environment. Only use this option as a last 
resort because XP Mode takes up a lot of system resources.

Strategies to Troubleshoot Any Computer Problem
	The six steps in the troubleshooting process are (1) interview the user and back up data, (2) examine the 
system and form a theory of probable cause (your best guess), (3) test your theory, (4) plan a solution 
and implement it, (5) verify that everything works and take appropriate preventive measures, and  
(6) document what you did and the final outcome.
Troubleshooting Applications
	A problem with an application might be caused by the application, the hardware, the operating system, 
the data, other applications in conflict with this one, or the user.
	Windows error messages and logs can help you examine a system looking for the source of an 
application problem.
	Tools and features available in Windows to address specific application error messages include the 
Action Center, Event Viewer, Reliability Monitor, Memory Diagnostics, System File Checker, Safe Mode, 
System Configuration, Task Manager, System Restore, Services console, Default Programs, Component 
Services (COM+), secondary logon, and the regsvr32, chkdsk, tasklist, and taskkill commands.

Real Problem 12-1 Summarizing Windows Troubleshooting Tools
When you’re stuck on a problem, it’s helpful to have a quick-and-easy reference of the tools available to 
you in Windows. In this project, you create a table to gather all of this information into one place. In the 
“Troubleshooting Windows Startup” chapter, you will add more tools to this table.
1.		 Using your choice of word-processing software (such as Microsoft Word) or spreadsheet software 
(such as Microsoft Excel), create a table with the following headings: Tool, Steps to access, and 
Description.
2.		 Under the Tool heading, list all of the Windows tools covered in this chapter and in earlier chapters, 
such as Event Viewer, Task Manager, Action Center, and Memory Diagnostics.
3.		 Complete the remainder of the table with the steps needed to access each tool and a brief, one- or  
two-sentence description of each. For Computer Management, for example, you might say, “Access 
from the Control Panel, or enter compmgmt.msc at a command prompt.” Be sure to include the 
program name of the utility if it can be launched from the command prompt. The description for Disk 
Management might say, “Use it to view and modify partitions on hard drives and to format drives.” 
Be sure to note whether a tool is available only for certain releases of Windows, such as “New with 
Windows 8.”
Keep this table handy, as it can be very useful when troubleshooting problems in Windows. 
Real Problem 12-2 Writing Your Own Scenario for Developing Interpersonal Social Skills
In the chapter, you read several scenarios where technical support people failed to serve their customers 
well or failed to relate professionally with coworkers. Recall a similar situation where you observed 
poor service from a technician or salesperson. Write the scenario using fictitious names. Then write three 
questions to help other students think through what went wrong, what should have happened, and some 
principles of relating to customers or coworkers that could have helped if they had been applied. Present 
your scenario in class or with a student group for discussion.
Real Problem 12-3 Installing and Using Help-Desk Software
Go to www.spiceworks.com and watch a few of the videos about Spiceworks Help Desk Software. Then 
download, install, and run the software. Practice using the software to add help-desk workers, open a 
ticket, assign a worker to a ticket, and resolve and close the ticket.
Consider setting up an IT help desk where your classmates can provide end-user support to other students 
and instructors at your school as they have problems with their personal computers. One computer in the 
class would be designated the help-desk computer that holds the Spiceworks Help Desk Software for the 
entire class. Classmates are entered in Spiceworks as help-desk workers and are assigned tickets as users 
request help. Spiceworks can be set up to receive requests for help through an email account, and you can 
advertise the email address as a way to offer support for students and instructors on campus. What other 
ways can you use to advertise your help desk and provide a way for your customers to contact the help 
desk? Some IT support classes have run extremely successful help desks and have received small donations 
for services.

Troubleshooting Windows 
Startup
Y
ou’ve already learned how to deal with Windows and application 
problems that occur after Windows has started. In this chapter, 
you take your troubleshooting skills one step further by learning to 
deal with startup problems caused by Windows. When Windows fails 
to start, it can be stressful if important data has not been backed up 
or the user has pressing work to do with the computer. What helps 
more than anything else is to have a good understanding of Windows 
startup and a good plan for approaching startup problems.
We begin the chapter with a discussion of what happens when 
you first turn on a computer and Windows starts. The more you 
understand about startup, the better your chances of fixing startup 
problems. Then you learn about Windows tools specifically designed 
to handle startup problems. Finally, you learn about strategies for 
solving startup problems.

Troubleshooting Windows Startup
Understanding the Boot Process
Knowledge is power. The better you understand what happens when you first turn on 
a computer until Windows is loaded and the Windows Start screen or desktop appears, 
the more likely you will be able to solve a problem when Windows cannot start. Let’s begin 
by noting the differences between a hard boot and a soft boot.
A+  
220-902 
4.1
Different Ways to Boot
The term booting comes from the phrase “lifting yourself up by your bootstraps” and refers 
to the computer bringing itself up to a working state without the user having to do anything 
but press the on button. Two fundamental ways to boot a computer are:
	 A hard boot, or cold boot, involves turning on the power with the on/off switch.
	 A soft boot, or warm boot, involves using the operating system to reboot. In Windows, a soft boot 
is called a restart.
A hard boot takes more time than a soft boot because in a soft boot, the initial steps performed by 
UEFI/BIOS in a hard boot don’t happen. To save time in most circumstances, you should use a soft boot 
(Windows restart). A hard boot initializes the processor and clears memory. So if a restart doesn’t work 
or you want to make certain you get a fresh start, use a Windows shutdown followed by a hard boot.
Windows Shutdown and Restart
Windows shutdown orderly closes all open applications, user sessions, services, devices, and system 
processes and then powers down the computer. The Windows 8 Fast Startup feature speeds up startup by 
performing a partial hibernation at shutdown. At shutdown, Windows saves the drivers and kernel state 
in the Windows hibernate file, hiberfil.sys, and then reads from this file on the next cold boot. The feature 
is enabled by default and can be disabled in the Power Options applet in Control Panel. A shutdown from 
the Start screen (see Figure 13-1a) uses Fast Startup hibernation when the feature is enabled. Even when 
Fast Startup is enabled, a shutdown from the desktop always performs a full shutdown (see Figure 13-1b). 
A+  
220-902 
4.1
(a)
(b)
Figure 13-1  For a shutdown, Windows 8 uses Fast Startup on the Start screen, but not from the desktop
Notes Most techies use the terms boot and startup interchangeably. However, in general, the term boot refers to the 
hardware phase of starting up a computer. Microsoft consistently uses the term startup to refer to how its operating  
systems are booted, well, started, I mean.

Understanding the Boot Process
13
OS Differences Windows 7 doesn’t have the Fast Startup feature. A Windows 7 shutdown always performs a full 
shutdown and a Windows 7 restart always reloads the kernel and drivers.
A restart in Windows 8 does not use Fast Startup hibernation, which means the kernel and drivers are 
completely reloaded at startup as is done with a full shutdown.
Power Buttons and Switches on a Computer Case
If Windows is hung and you can’t use the OS to perform a restart or shutdown, look for power or reset 
buttons on the front or rear of the case. For example, one computer has three power switches: a power button 
and a reset button on the front of the case and a power switch on the rear of the case (see Figure 13-2).
Figure 13-2  This computer case has two power buttons on the front and one power switch on the  
rear of the case
They work like this:
	 The power button in front can be configured as a “soft” power button, causing a Windows restart.
	 The reset button initializes the CPU so that it restarts at the beginning of the UEFI/BIOS startup 
program. The computer behaves as though the power were turned off and back on and then goes 
through the entire boot process.
	 The switch on the rear of the case simply turns off the power abruptly and is a “hard” power button. 
If you use this switch, wait 30 seconds before you press the power button on the front of the case to 
boot the system. This method gives you the greatest assurance that memory will clear. However, if 
Windows is abruptly stopped, it might give an error message when you reboot.
How the front two buttons work can be controlled in UEFI/BIOS setup. Know, however, that different 
cases offer different options.
Startup UEFI/BIOS Controls the Beginning of the Boot
The startup UEFI/BIOS is programming contained on the firmware chip on the motherboard 
that is responsible for getting a system up and going and finding an OS to load. Recall that 
UEFI is a mini-operating system that is gradually replacing the legacy BIOS standards. UEFI 
improves on processes for booting, securing the boot, loading device drivers and applications 
before the OS loads, and handing over the boot to the OS.
If Secure Boot in UEFI is enabled, UEFI systems run security checks to protect against malware designed 
to attack during the boot. UEFI stores device drivers and information about Secure Boot on a nonvolatile 
RAM (NVRAM) chip and in a hidden partition on the hard drive called the EFI System Partition (ESP). 
Recall UEFI/BIOS searches for and then turns to a boot device to find an operating system to launch. During 
startup, you can change the boot device priority order used for this search by accessing UEFI/BIOS setup.

Next let’s see what happens during the boot, from the time power is turned on until Windows is started. 
In these steps, we assume the OS is loaded from the hard drive.
Steps to Boot the Computer and Start Windows
Before we get into the steps, check out Table 13-1. It lists the components and files stored 
on the hard drive that are necessary to start Windows. The table can serve as a guide as you 
study the steps.

BIOS systems using MBR partitioning
MBR
First sector of the hard drive is 
called the Master Boot Record 
(MBR)
BIOS looks to the partition table in the MBR to locate the 
active partition.
System partition
Also called the active partition 
or System Reserved partition
The system partition holds the Boot Manager, Boot Configuration 
Data (BCD) store, and other files and folders needed to begin 
Windows startup. For Windows, these files are stored in the root 
and \Boot directory of the hidden system partition.
Boot Manager
In the root of the system 
partition
Windows Boot Manager, bootmgr (with no file extension), 
accesses the BCD store and locates the Windows Boot 
Loader.
BCD store
\Boot directory on the system 
partition
The Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store is a database file 
named BCD (no file extension) and is organized the same 
as a registry hive. It contains boot settings that control 
the Boot Manager and can be viewed and edited with the 
bcdedit command.
UEFI systems using GPT partitioning

end of the drive
UEFI looks to the GPT partition table to locate the EFI 
System Partition.
System partition
EFI System Partition (ESP) is 
normally 100 MB to 200 MB 
in size.
The system partition holds the Windows Boot Manager, BCD, 
and other supporting files. For Windows, the Boot Manager 
is bootmgfw.efi and is stored in \EFI\Microsoft\Boot.
A backup copy of bootmgfw.efi is at \EFI\Boot\bootx64.efi.

Troubleshooting Windows Startup
Study these steps carefully because the better you understand startup, the more likely you’ll be able to 
solve startup problems:
1. Startup UEFI/BIOS is responsible for the early steps in the boot process. NVRAM or CMOS RAM on 
the motherboard holds an inventory of hardware devices, hardware settings, security passwords, date 
and time, and startup settings. Startup UEFI/BIOS reads this information and then surveys the hardware 
devices it finds present, comparing it with the list kept in its RAM.
2. Startup UEFI/BIOS runs POST (power-on self test), which is a series of tests to find out if the firmware 
can communicate correctly with essential hardware components required for a successful boot. Any 
errors are indicated as a series of beeps, recorded speech, or error messages on screen (after video is 
checked). If the key is pressed to request UEFI/BIOS setup, the UEFI/BIOS setup program is run.
3. Based on information kept in NVRAM, startup UEFI loads the UEFI boot manager and device drivers. 
UEFI/BIOS then turns to the hard drive or other boot device to locate and launch the Windows Boot 
Manager. If UEFI/BIOS cannot find a Windows Boot Manager or cannot turn over operation to it, one 
of these error messages appears:
Missing operating system
Error loading operating system
Windows failed to load
Invalid partition table
1. Activates HAL 
2. Reads more of registry
3. Builds into memory the registry key

4. Starts critical services and drivers
5. Starts Session Manager (Smss.exe) in user mode
1. Starts subsystem to display graphics and Windows flag
2. Starts Csrss.exe (subsystem that interacts with applications)
3. Starts Logon Manager (Winlogon.exe) 
4. Reads and executes other commands stored in registry
1. Starts Service Control Manager (Services.exe)
Starts services set with type = Automatic
2. Starts the Local Security Authority process (Lsass.exe)
Applies Group Policy setting and loads any program stored in registry keys and
folders (if not prevented by Group Policy)

4. The Windows Boot Manager does the following:
a.	It reads the settings in the BCD.
b.	The next step, one of three, depends on entries in the BCD and these other factors:

Troubleshooting Windows Startup
5. Windows Boot Loader (winload.exe or winload.efi) is responsible for loading Windows components. 
It does the following:
a.	For normal startups, Boot Loader loads into memory the OS kernel, Ntoskrnl.exe, but does not yet 
start it. Boot Loader also loads into memory the Hardware Abstraction Layer (Hal.dll), which will 
later be used by the kernel.
b. Boot Loader loads into memory the system registry hive (C:\Windows\System32\Config\System).
c.	 Boot Loader then reads the registry key just created, HKEY_LOCAL_ MACHINE\SYSTEM\Services, 
looking for and loading into memory device drivers that must be launched at startup. The drivers are 
not yet started.
d.	Boot Loader starts up the memory paging process and then turns over startup to the OS kernel 
(Ntoskrnl.exe).
6. The kernel (Ntoskrnl.exe) does the following:
a.	 It activates the HAL, reads more information from the registry, and builds into memory the registry key 
HKEY_LOCAL_ MACHINE\HARDWARE, using information that has been collected about the hardware.
b.	The kernel then starts critical services and drivers that are configured to be started by the kernel 
during the boot. Recall that drivers interact directly with hardware and run in kernel mode, while 
services interact with drivers. Most services and drivers are stored in C:\Windows\System32 or  
C:\Windows\System32\Drivers and have an .exe, .dll, or .sys file extension.
c.	 After the kernel starts all services and drivers configured to load during the boot, it starts the Session 
Manager (Smss.exe), which runs in user mode.
7. The Session Manager (Smss.exe) loads the graphical interface and starts the client/server run-time 
subsystem (csrss.exe), which also runs in user mode. Csrss.exe is the Win32 subsystem component 
that interacts with applications.
8. Smss.exe starts the Logon Manager (winlogon.exe) and reads and executes other commands stored in 
the registry, such as a command to replace system files placed there by Windows Update.
9. Winlogon.exe does the following:
a.	It starts the Service Control Manager (services.exe). Services.exe starts all services listed with the 
startup type of Automatic in the Services console.
Figure 13-7  Windows 8 sign-in screen
b.	Winlogon.exe starts the 
Local Security Authority 
process (lsass.exe). The 
sign-in screen appears (see 
Figure 13-7), and the user 
account and password 
are passed to the lsass.exe 
process for authenticating.
c.	 Winlogon.exe launches 
userinit.exe. For Windows 8, 
the Start screen or desktop 
(explorer.exe) is launched. 
For Windows 7, the desktop 
is launched.
10. Userinit.exe applies Group

Troubleshooting Windows Startup
Examine the System Partition Contents
Normally, you cannot see the contents of the system partition. However, if you first assign the partition a 
drive letter, you can view its contents. First, open the Folder Options applet in Control Panel and verify 
that system files and all file extensions are not hidden and can be viewed. Then open Disk Management 
and find out if the hard drive on which Windows is installed is using the MBR or GPT partitioning system.
Do the following if the hard drive is using the MBR system:
1.	 In Disk Management, right-click the System Reserved partition and click Change Drive Letter and Paths. 
Click Add and follow directions on screen to assign the partition a drive letter.
2.	 Open File Explorer or Windows Explorer and drill down into the new volume (see Figure 13-10). You should 
find bootmgr in the root and BCD in the \Boot folder on the volume.

Troubleshooting Windows Startup
As you learn to use each tool, keep in mind that you want to use the tool that makes as few changes 
to the system as possible to fix the problem. In this part of the chapter, the tools are divided into three 
groups: the least invasive and easy solutions, tools that can affect Windows system files and user settings, 
and tools to rebuild the Windows installation, even to the point of reinstalling Windows. Before we dig 
into these tools, let’s look at what you can do before a problem occurs in order to make troubleshooting 
easier and more effective.
What to Do before a Problem Occurs
Good preparation will make troubleshooting startup problems much simpler and more 
successful. When you are responsible for a computer and while the computer is still healthy, 
be sure to complete the following tasks:
	 Keep good backups. The chapter “Maintaining Windows” covers methods to back up data, applications, 
and user settings.
	 Create a Windows 8 custom refresh image. Windows 8 offers the option of creating a custom  
refresh image of the Windows 8 volume. As you learned in the chapter “Maintaining Windows,”  
this image should be created right after you’ve installed Windows, hardware, applications, and 
user accounts, and customized Windows settings. You can store the image on the hard drive so it’s  
easy for an end user to get to it when needed or copy it to a network drive, external drive, or some  
other safe location.
	 Configure Windows 8 to use the F8 key at startup. The F8 key gives you access to the Advanced  
Boot Options menu in Windows, which you’ll learn about later in this chapter. Windows 8 has the  
feature disabled by default, and Windows 7 has it enabled. In Windows 8, to enable the F8 key 
at startup, you’ll need an elevated command prompt window. Press Win+X, click Command Prompt 
(Admin), and respond to the UAC box. In the command prompt window, enter this command  
(see Figure 13-12):
bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy

Notes A recovery drive is bit-specific: Use a 32-bit recovery drive to repair a 32-bit Windows installation and a 
64-bit recovery drive to repair a 64-bit installation.
Caution
As you learn to troubleshoot Windows 8 startup, don’t depend on the F8 key to work during the boot 
because you never know when you’ll work on a computer that has it disabled.
	
Later, if you want to disable the use of F8 at startup, open an elevated command prompt window 
and enter this command:
bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy standard
Figure 13-13  Use the Advanced Boot Options menu to troubleshoot difficult startup problems
	 Create a recovery drive. Although it’s possible to use recovery media created on a different computer 
than the one you are troubleshooting, the process is simplified if you already have these tools on hand. 
Let’s learn how to do that now.
Create a Recovery Drive
If the computer won’t start up, you’ll need a bootable device with Windows repair tools on it to start 
the system and fix problems. Windows 8 provides two recovery device options, depending on the drive 
hardware available. Here are options for that device:
	 If the computer has an optical drive, you can boot from the Windows setup DVD and use Windows RE 
to fix problems, which is discussed later in this section.
	 You can use a tool new to Windows 8, called a recovery drive. A recovery drive is a bootable USB flash 
drive. Many mobile computers don’t have an optical drive, which can make a recovery drive an essential 
troubleshooting tool.

Troubleshooting Windows Startup
The key to optimal success with a recovery drive is to create it before it’s needed. You can use a recovery 
drive on a broken computer that was created on a different computer. However, if a computer has an OEM 
recovery partition put there by the manufacturer of a laptop, all-in-one, or other brand-name computer, you 
have the option to copy this partition to the recovery drive in order to retain OEM resources. If the drive is to 
hold the OEM recovery partition, it should be about 16 GB. Otherwise, an 8-GB flash drive is large enough.
Here are the steps to create the recovery drive:
1. Plug in a USB flash drive. Know that the entire drive will be formatted and everything on the drive 
will be lost.
2. Open the Control Panel in Classic view and click Recovery. In the Recovery window that appears 
(see Figure 13-14), click Create a recovery drive. Respond to the UAC box.
Figure 13-14  The Recovery window in Control Panel is used to create a recovery drive
3. The Recovery Drive dialog box 
appears (see Figure 13-15). If the 
computer doesn’t have an OEM 
recovery partition, the check box 
on this dialog box is gray and 
not available. If the computer has 
an OEM recovery partition, the 
check box is available and you 
can check it to copy the recovery 
partition to the recovery drive. 
Click Next to continue.
4. A list of installed drives appears 
(see Figure 13-16). Be careful 
to select the USB flash drive 
because everything on the drive 
will be lost. Click Next. A mes-
sage on the next screen warns 
you that everything on the drive 
will be deleted. Click Create. 
The drive is created, which takes 
some time. Then click Finish.

Be sure to label the flash 
drive well and put it in a safe 
place. For example, you can put 
it in an envelope and label it 
“Recovery drive for John Hawkins 
64-bit Windows 8 Sony laptop” 
and store it in the computer’s 
documentation file.
Figure 13-16  Select the USB flash drive that will become the recovery drive
Notes If you copied the OEM 
recovery partition to the USB flash 
drive and are short on hard drive 
space on the computer, you can 
use Disk Management to delete 
the recovery partition to free 
up some space and then expand 
the Windows volume.
Create a System Repair Disc
In Windows 7, you can create a Windows 7 system repair disc, which you can use to launch Windows 
RE. To create a Windows 7 system repair disc, click Create a system repair disc in the Windows 7 Backup 
and Restore window (see Figure 13-17). A 32-bit Windows 7 installation will create a 32-bit version of the 
repair disc, and a 64-bit Windows 7 installation will create a 64-bit version of the repair disc. A repair disc 
created on one computer can be used on a different computer even if they are using different editions of Windows 7, 
but be sure to use a 32-bit disc for a 32-bit installation and a 64-bit disc for a 64-bit Windows installation.

Troubleshooting Windows Startup
If the system hangs while diagnosing and repairing, try another restart. Windows will launch the Windows 
Recovery Environment (Windows RE). Windows RE is normally stored on a hidden partition on the hard 
drive and is a lean operating system that can be launched to solve Windows startup problems and provides 
a graphical and command-line interface. You can also launch Windows RE from the Windows setup DVD 
or a recovery drive. In Windows RE, first try startup repair.
Startup Repair
When addressing startup problems, the first tool to try is startup repair, which is a built-in diagnostic and 
repair tool in Windows 8/7. It can fix Windows system files without changing Windows settings, user data, 
or applications. You can’t cause additional problems with the tool and it’s easy to use. Figure 13-11 shows 
that startup repair can be launched from the Windows 8 Settings charm, by three or more restarts, or by 
booting from the Windows setup DVD or a recovery drive.
Follow these steps to use startup repair from the Settings charm:
1. On the Windows 8 charms bar, click Settings. In the Settings pane, click Change PC settings. In the left 
pane of the PC settings window, click Update and recovery. In the Update and recovery pane, click 
Recovery and click Restart now (see Figure 13-19).
Tools for Least Invasive Solutions
Looking back at the diagram in Figure 13-11, tools to repair Windows are shown in purple 
boxes. In this part of the chapter, we discuss several tools that are easy to use and don’t make 
major changes to Windows system files or user settings, including the Windows 8 self-healing 
feature and several options on the Windows advanced startup screens.
Use Windows 8’s Self-Healing Feature
If you restart the computer at least three times within a few minutes, Windows 8 automatically launches 
diagnostics (see Figure 13-18) and takes you through steps to attempt to repair the system. Sometimes a 
few restarts is all you need to do.

2. Windows restarts and launches Windows RE. The first screen provided by Windows RE is called the 
Windows Startup Menu and is shown in Figure 13-20. When you click Troubleshoot, the Troubleshoot 
screen in Figure 13-21 appears. Using this screen, notice you can refresh or reset the computer, which 
are more invasive solutions than startup repair. Click Advanced options.
Notes You must be signed in to Windows 8 with an administrator account to see all the options on the Recovery 
pane that are shown in Figure 13-19.

3. From the Advanced options screen (see Figure 13-22), you can perform a System Restore (apply a 
restore point), use a system image to recover the Windows volume (for backward compatibility with 
the Windows 7 system image), perform a startup repair, get to a command prompt, and change startup 
settings. Click Startup Repair. Windows RE examines the system, fixes problems, reports what it did, and 
might offer suggestions for further fixes. A log file of the process can be found at C:\Windows\System32\

Ntbtlog.txt (see Figure 13-27). Use this option to see what did and did not load during the boot. For instance, 
if you have a problem getting a device to work, check Ntbtlog.txt to see what driver files loaded. Boot logging 
is much more effective if you have a copy of Ntbtlog.txt that was made when everything worked as it should. 
Then you can compare the good load with the bad load, looking for differences.
Notes The Ntbtlog.txt file is also generated when you boot into Safe Mode.

Press 3 or F3: Enable 
­Low-Resolution Video  
(640 × 480) 
Use this option when the video 
settings don’t allow you to see 
the screen well enough to fix a 
bad setting (for example, black 
fonts on a black background). Booting in this mode gives you a very plain, standard VGA video. You can 
then go to the Display settings, correct the problem, and reboot normally. You can also use this option if 
your video drivers are corrupted and you need to update, roll back, or reinstall the video drivers.
Press 4 or F4: Enable Safe Mode 
After you sign in to Windows, the Safe Mode desktop appears (see Figure 13-28). Launching Safe Mode 
and then restarting the system can sometimes solve a startup problem. However, you can also go to the 
Start screen in Safe Mode to launch anti-malware software to scan the system for malware. You can open 
Event Viewer to find events helpful in troubleshooting the system, run the System File Checker command 
(sfc /scannow) to restore system files, use Device Manager to roll back a driver, use Memory Diagnostics 
to verify memory, use the chkdsk /r command to check for file system errors, configure Windows for a 
clean boot on the next restart, and perform other troubleshooting tasks.
Notes If Windows hangs 
during the boot, try booting using 
the option Enable Boot Logging. 
Then look at the last entry in the 
Ntbtlog.txt file. This entry might 
be the name of a device driver 
causing the system to hang.

Press 5 or F5: Enable Safe Mode with Networking 
Use this option when you need access to the network to solve the problem. For example, you might need to 
download updates to your anti-malware software. Also use this mode when the Windows installation files 
are available on the network, rather than the Windows setup DVD, and you need to access those files.
Press 6 or F6: Enable Safe Mode with Command Prompt 
If Safe Mode can’t start, try Safe Mode with Command Prompt, which doesn’t attempt to load the graphical 
interface. At the command prompt, use the sfc /scannow command to verify system files (see Figure 13-29). 
If the problem is still not solved, you can use this command to launch System Restore: C:\Windows\

Troubleshooting Windows Startup
Notes As you use these startup settings tools, be sure to reboot after each attempt to fix the problem to make sure 
the problem has not been resolved before you try another tool. To exit Windows RE and relaunch Windows, press Enter 
on the Startup Settings screen.
Press 7 or F7: Disable Driver Signature Enforcement 
All 64-bit editions of Windows require that kernel-mode drivers be digitally signed. Disabling driver 
signature enforcement is used by developers who are testing kernel-mode device drivers that are not yet 
digitally signed. Don’t use this option for troubleshooting Windows startup because doing so might allow 
malware drivers to load.
Press 8 or F8: Disable Early Launch Anti-Malware Driver 
Windows 8 allows anti-malware software to launch a driver before any third-party drivers are launched so 
it can scan these drivers for malware. Unless you’re sure a driver is the problem, don’t disable this security 
feature. (Windows 7 doesn’t offer this option on its Advanced Boot Options screen.)
Press 9 or F9: Disable Automatic Restart on System Failure 
By default, Windows automatically restarts immediately after a blue screen of death (BSOD) stop error, 
which is described in more detail later in this chapter. The error can cause the system to continually reboot 
rather than shut down. Press F9 to disable automatic restarts and stop the rebooting. To make this setting 
permanent, open the System window and click Advanced system settings. In the Startup and Recovery group 
of the System Properties box, click Settings, and on the Startup and Recovery box, uncheck Automatically 
restart (see Figure 13-31). Click OK twice and close the System window.

Last Known Good Configuration
One option available in the Advanced Boot Options menu for Windows 7 (refer back to Figure 13-9) 
that is no longer available for Windows 8 is the Last Known Good Configuration, which has been 
replaced by System Restore and a computer refresh for Windows 8. For Windows 7, registry settings 
collectively called the Last Known Good Configuration are saved in the registry each time the user 
successfully logs on to the system. If your problem is caused by a bad hardware or software installation and you 
get an error message the first time you restart the system after the installation, using the Last Known Good can, in 
effect, undo your installation and solve your problem.
Remember, the Last Known Good registry settings are saved each time a user logs on to Windows 7. Therefore, it’s 
important to try the Last Known Good early in the troubleshooting session before a good one is overwritten with a 
bad Last Known Good. (However, know that if you sign in to Safe Mode, the Last Known Good is not saved.)

Use Boot Logs and System Information 
to Research Startup
Boot logs can be used to generate a list of drivers that were loaded during a normal startup and during 
the Safe Mode startup. Do the following to use boot logs to research startup:

2.	 Reboot the system in Safe Mode, which also creates a boot log. Compare the two logs, identifying differences 
in drivers loaded during the two boots. To compare the files, you can print both files and lay them side by side 
for comparison. An easier method is to compare the files using the Compare tool in Microsoft Word.
3.	 Use the System Information utility or other methods to identify the hardware devices loaded during normal 
startup but not loaded in Safe Mode. Which devices on your system did not load in Safe Mode?
As you identify the drivers not loaded during Safe Mode, these registry keys might help with your research:
	 Lists drivers and services loaded during Safe Mode: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Minimal
	 Lists drivers and services loaded during Safe Mode with Networking: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\

Take Ownership and Replace a Windows 
System File
The System File Checker (SFC) tool can be used to find and replace corrupted Windows system files. 
The tool keeps a log of its actions (refer back to Figure 13-29), and, if it cannot replace a corrupted 
file, you can find that information in the log file. Then you can manually replace the file. To do so, 
you can use the takeown command to take ownership of a system file and the icacls command to get 
full access to the file. The Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 929833 at support.microsoft.com explains how to use 
these two commands.

Troubleshooting Windows Startup
Tools That Can Affect Windows System Files and Settings
Tools that affect Windows system files, Windows settings, user settings, and applications 
include System Restore and several commands that you can execute from a command prompt 
in Windows RE. These tools are discussed next.
System Restore
Windows gives you several opportunities during the startup troubleshooting process to use System Restore to 
restore the system to an earlier point in time when a restore point was made. You can select System Restore from 
the Windows 8 Advanced options screen (refer back to Figure 13-22) or the Windows 7 Advanced Boot Options 
screen (refer back to Figure 13-9). You can also perform System Restore in Safe Mode or from a command prompt.
System Restore can cause problems of its own because Windows updates and updates to anti-malware 
software can be lost and hardware devices and applications might need to be reinstalled. System Restore 
won’t help if the file system is corrupted or the registry is trashed. In these situations, the command 
prompt might help.
The Command Prompt Window in Windows RE
Use the command prompt window in Windows RE when the graphical interface is missing 
or corrupted or you want to use a specific command to fix a problem when Windows refuses 
to start. Using this command prompt, you have administrator privileges and full read and 
write access to all files on all drives. Many commands you learned about in the chapter, 
“Maintaining Windows,” can be used at this command prompt. To access the Windows RE command 
prompt, follow these steps:
1. Depending on the health of your Windows system, do one of the following:
	 If you can start Windows, launch Windows RE from the Settings charm as you learned to do earlier in 
the chapter. The system restarts and the Windows Startup Menu (refer back to Figure 13-6) appears.
	 If you cannot launch Windows, boot from the Windows setup DVD or a recovery drive. (You might 
need to first change the boot device priority order in UEFI/BIOS to boot first from the optical drive 
or USB device.) On the Windows Setup screen (see Figure 13-32), click Repair your computer. On the 
next screen, choose your keyboard. The Windows Startup Menu appears.
Do the following to practice manually replacing a system file:
1.	 Boot the computer into Safe Mode with Command Prompt.
2.	 Take ownership and gain full access to the C:\Windows\System32\jscript.dll file. What commands did you use?
3.	 Rename the jscript.dll file to jscript.dll.hold. Run the sfc /scannow command. Did SFC restore the jscript.dll 
file? What is the path and file name of the log file listing repairs?
4.	 SFC restores a file using files stored on the Windows setup DVD or other folders on the hard drive. If SFC cannot 
restore a file, you might find a fresh copy in the C:\Windows\winsxs folder or its subfolders. Search these 
folders. Did you find a version of jscript.dll that is the same file size as the one in C:\Windows\System32? Other 
than the C:\Windows\winsxs folder, where else can you find a known good copy of a corrupted system file?

2. On the Windows Startup Menu, click Troubleshoot. On the Troubleshoot screen (refer back to 
Figure 13-21), click Command Prompt (refer back to Figure 13-22).
3. If Windows RE is able to read registry entries on the hard drive, it will ask you to sign in using an 
administrator account.
Next are some examples of how to use the Windows RE command prompt to repair a system.
Manage Data Files and System Files 
Use the sfc /scannow command to restore critical Windows system files. Use the cd, copy, rename, and 
delete commands to manage data and system files. For example, if key registry files are corrupted or 
deleted, the system will not start. You can restore registry files using those saved in the C:\Windows\
System32\Config\RegBack folder. This RegBack folder contains partial backups of the registry files put 
there after a successful boot. Use the commands in Table 13-2 to restore the registry files. In the table, we 
assume Windows is installed on drive C:. However, know that Windows RE is likely to assign a different 
drive letter to the Windows volume.
Command Line
Description
1.	c:
Makes drive C: the current drive. The default directory is root.
2.	dir
Examines the contents of drive C:. If this is not your Windows 
volume, try a different drive letter.

Makes the Windows registry folder the current folder.
4.	ren default default.save
5.	ren sam sam.save
6.	ren security security.save
7.	ren software software.save
8.	ren system system.save
Renames the five registry files.
9.	cd regback
Makes the registry backup folder the current folder.

After you try each fix, reboot the system to see if the problem is solved before you do the next fix.
Repair and Manage a Hard Drive 
A corrupted file system or partition can cause a failure to boot. Use the chkdsk /r command to repair the file 
system. Use the format command to reformat the volume (all files will be lost). Use the diskpart command 
to manage hard drives, partitions, and volumes. When you enter diskpart at a command prompt, the 
DISKPART> prompt appears where you can enter diskpart commands. Some important diskpart commands 
are listed in Table 13-3; you have already learned to use several. Diskpart can also be used in a normal

Notes For a complete list of diskpart commands, go to the Microsoft support site (technet.microsoft.com) and search 
on “DiskPart Command-Line Options”.
Enable Networking 
Networking is not normally available from the Windows RE command prompt. Use the wpeinit command 
to enable networking. The wpeinit command initializes Windows PE. Recall from the chapter, “Installing 
Windows,” that Windows PE is the preinstallation-environment operating system that is launched prior to 
installing Windows in a clean install and includes networking components.
Although a startup repair should solve the problem when you get an error message at startup that 
“Bootmgr is missing,” rebuilding the BCD store should also be able to resolve the same problem on a BIOS 
and MBR system.
Use Bootrec and Bcdedit to Repair the File System  
and Key Boot Files 
A failure to boot can be caused by a corrupted BCD. Use the bootrec command to repair the BCD and 
boot sectors. Use the bcdedit command to manually edit the BCD. (Be sure to make a copy of the BCD 
before you edit it.) Use the bootsect command to repair a dual-boot system. To get helpful information 
about these commands, enter the command followed by /?, such as bcdedit /?. Some examples of the 
bootrec and bcdedit commands are listed in Table 13-4.

Tools for Reinstalling Windows
All of the startup troubleshooting tools so far in this chapter are designed to repair a Windows 
installation. However, sometimes Windows is beyond repair and you need to reinstall it. The 
following startup troubleshooting tools affect the entire Windows installation on a computer 
rather than a few files or settings. Let’s discuss your options for a reinstall, including an OEM 
recovery partition, Windows 8 refresh and reset, and Windows 8/7 system image.
OEM Recovery Partition
Laptops, all-in-one computers, and brand-name desktops come with the OS preinstalled at the factory. This 
OEM (original equipment manufacturer) build of the OS is likely to be customized, and, for laptops, the 
drivers might be specific to proprietary devices installed in the laptop.
The laptop or brand-name computer is likely to have a recovery partition on the hard drive that contains 
a copy of the OS build, device drivers, diagnostics programs, and preinstalled applications needed to restore

Notes When you first become responsible for a laptop, make a Windows 8 recovery drive to a USB flash drive that 
includes the OEM recovery partition in case you must replace the laptop’s hard drive. Know that, if the laptop is more 
than three years old, the manufacturer might no longer provide the recovery media.
the system to its factory state. This partition might or might not be hidden. For example, Figure 13-34 
shows the Disk Management information for a hard drive on one laptop that has a 14.75-GB recovery 
partition.
To know how to access the recovery tools stored on a recovery partition, see the manufacturer’s website 
or look for a message at the beginning of the boot, such as “Press ESC for diagnostics” or “Press F12 to 
recover the system.” For one Sony laptop, you press the red Assist button during the boot (see Figure 13-35). 
When you press the key or button, a menu appears giving you options to diagnose the problem, to repair 
the current OS installation, or to completely rebuild the entire hard drive to its factory state.
Recall that an OEM recovery partition can be saved when you create a recovery drive for Windows 8. Unless 
the recovery partition has been saved, it won’t be any help at all if the hard drive is broken or corrupted. In 
this situation, you’re dependent on other recovery media. Older laptops came bundled with the full recovery 
on CDs. For today’s laptops, you might have the option to use a working computer to download the recovery 
media from the manufacturer’s website and use it to create a bootable USB flash drive or DVD. You can then 
use the media to install Windows to its factory state on a new hard drive installed in the laptop.

Troubleshooting Windows Startup
Refresh a Windows 8 Computer
In the chapter, “Maintaining Windows,” you learned to create a Windows 8 custom refresh image of 
the Windows volume. To solve a problem with a corrupted Windows 8 installation, you can perform a 
Windows 8 refresh. The refresh can recover the installation from a custom refresh image that has been 
designated as the active recovery image, a hidden OEM recovery partition on the hard drive, or the 
Windows 8 setup DVD.
When you refresh a computer, the refresh saves installed apps that use the Windows 8 interface and 
current user settings and data. Unless you’re working with a custom refresh image, Windows settings and 
desktop applications are lost during a refresh. Here’s how to perform a refresh:
1. Because the system will restart a couple of times during the refresh, remove any discs in the optical 
drive and unplug any bootable external hard drive or USB flash drives. For a laptop, plug in the AC 
adapter so you don’t lose battery power during the refresh. If the computer doesn’t have a recovery 
partition and you haven’t made a custom refresh image, insert the Windows setup DVD in the optical 
drive, which the refresh will use to perform a partial in-place upgrade of Windows 8.
2. Do one of the following, depending on the health of the Windows installation:
	 If you can launch Windows, on the charms bar, click Settings, click Change PC settings, click 
Update and recovery, and click Recovery. Click Get started under Refresh your PC without 
affecting your files (refer back to Figure 13-19). A warning message appears (see Figure 13-36). 
Click Next. Click Refresh.
Research Laptop Online Resources
Suppose the hard drive in a laptop has failed and you must replace the hard drive with a new one and 
install Windows on the new drive. What online resources can help you? Do the following to find a service 
manual and recovery files for a laptop that you have access to, such as one you or a friend owns:
Hands-On  Project 13-5
1.	 What are the brand, model, and serial number of the laptop?
A+  
220-902 
4.1
2.	 What is the website of the laptop manufacturer? Print a webpage on that site that shows you what recovery 
files are available for download to install Windows on a new hard drive for this laptop.
3.	 If the website provides a service manual, download the manual and print the pages that show how to replace 
the hard drive.
4.	 Based on what you have learned about online support for this laptop, what backups or recovery media do you 
think need to be created now before a hard drive crash occurs.
Caution
Upgrading Windows on a laptop is not a good idea unless you have a good reason to do so. If you do 
decide to upgrade, upgrade the OS using an OS build purchased from the laptop manufacturer, which should include the OS 
and device drivers specific to your laptop. If you decide to upgrade the OS using an off-the-shelf version of Windows, be 
careful to determine that all components in the system are compatible with the upgrade.

	 If you cannot launch Windows, boot from the Windows setup DVD or a recovery drive. When 
booting from the Windows setup DVD, the Windows Setup screen appears, as shown earlier in 
Figure 13-32. Click Repair your computer. (When booting from a recovery drive, the Setup screen 
doesn’t show.) On the next screen, choose your keyboard. The Windows Startup Menu appears (refer 
back to Figure 13-20). Click Troubleshoot. On the Troubleshoot screen (refer back to Figure 13-21), 
click Refresh your PC.
3. Windows verifies there’s enough free space on the hard drive to perform the refresh. A lot of space 
(as much as half the space on the Windows volume) is needed because Windows will store the old 
Windows installation in a Windows.old folder and will also need space to back up apps and data. 
If there’s not enough space, an error occurs, and you’ll need to delete files or folders or move them to 
a different location to free up enough space and start the refresh again.
4. Another warning message appears. Click Refresh to continue. Next, user settings and data and 
Windows 8 apps are backed up, and Windows searches for media or an image to use to reinstall 
Windows. It uses this order for the search:
a.	It checks for a custom refresh image. If a custom refresh image was previously made and registered 
with the system, this image is used to refresh the system. (If desktop applications were included in the 
image, they are included in the refresh. Any desktop applications that were installed after the refresh 
image was created are lost and must be manually reinstalled.)
b. If no custom refresh image is found, it checks for an OEM recovery partition. If it finds an OEM 
recovery partition, the image on the partition is used to refresh the computer to its factory state.
c.	 If no image or recovery partition is found, it requests the Windows setup DVD if it’s not already 
available. The refresh process will use the Windows setup DVD to perform a partial in-place upgrade 
of Windows 8.
5. The system restarts and the refresh begins. Progress is reported on screen as a percentage of completion. 
The Windows volume is formatted, and Windows is reinstalled from an image or from the Windows 
setup files. User settings, data, and Windows 8 apps are restored from backup, and the system restarts.
6. The names of desktop applications lost during the refresh are stored in a file on the Windows desktop 
named Removed Apps.html (see Figure 13-37). Open the file to see the list of applications. You’ll need 
to reinstall these applications.

7. The refresh created a Windows.old folder containing the old Windows installation. After you’re sure you 
don’t need anything in it, you can delete the folder to free up the disk space.
Reset a Windows 8 Computer
You might want to reset a computer when you’re about to give it away or recycle it or totally want to start 
over. The Windows volume is formatted and Windows is reinstalled. If an OEM recovery partition is present, 
the system is reset to its factory state. If there’s no recovery partition, the process requests the Windows setup 
DVD, which it uses to reinstall Windows. All user data and settings and installed apps are lost. You can use 
the recovery methods provided by the manufacturer (for example, press F12 or F10 at startup) or you can 
use Windows 8 to reset the system.
Here are the Windows 8 steps to reset a computer:
1. If a recovery partition is present, it will be used for the reset. If there’s no recovery partition, insert the 
Windows setup DVD in the optical drive, which the reset process uses to perform a clean install of 
Windows.
2. Do one of the following:
	 If you can launch Windows, go to the Update and recovery screen and click Get started under 
Remove everything and reinstall Windows (refer back to Figure 13-19). A warning message appears. 
Click Next.
	 If you cannot launch Windows, boot from the Windows setup DVD or a recovery drive and make 
your way to the Troubleshoot screen shown earlier in Figure 13-21. Click Reset your PC.
3. If the system contains more than one volume or hard drive, Windows asks if you want to format all 
drives or just the Windows volume. Click a box to make your selection.
4. On the next screen (see Figure 13-38), you’re asked to decide between a quick format and a thorough 
format. A thorough format makes it less likely someone can recover data on the drive. Make your 
selection by clicking a box.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know how to use a preinstallation environment and a recovery 
image to help resolve a Windows startup problem.
5. On the next screen, another warning appears. Click Reset to start the process. The system restarts and 
resetting begins. After another restart, you can step through the process of preparing Windows for first use.
System Image
Recall from the chapter, “Maintaining Windows,” a Windows 7 system image is a backup of the entire 
Windows volume and Windows 8 allows you to create a system image for backward compatibility with 
Windows 7. For Windows 8, always use a custom refresh image over a system image because it’s more 
flexible and easier to use than a system image.
In Windows 7, to recover the system using a system image, launch Windows 7 from the Windows setup DVD or a 
recovery drive. When booting from a Windows setup DVD, on the Install Windows screen (refer back to Figure 13-24), 
click Repair your computer. Windows RE launches. On the following screens, select your language and enter an 
administrator user account and password.
The System Recovery Options box appears, listing a menu of Windows RE recovery tools (refer back to Figure 13-23). 
Click System Image Recovery and follow directions on screen to point to the location of the system image. Everything 
on the Windows volume is erased and replaced with the system image.

Install Windows Over the Network
Recall from the chapter “Installing Windows” that in an enterprise environment you can install Windows 
from a deployment image on the network. You must boot the computer to the network where it finds and 
loads Windows PE on the deployment server. For a legacy BIOS system, go into BIOS setup and set the first 
boot device to be Ethernet. For a UEFI system, look for an advanced setup screen in UEFI setup to enable 
PXE Support. The computer then boots to the Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE) and PXE then searches 
for a server on the network to provide Windows PE and the deployment image.

Troubleshooting Windows Startup
And now the fun begins! With your understanding of the boot process and Windows tools for 
troubleshooting startup in hand, let’s work through a bunch of errors and problems that can 
affect Windows startup and see what can be done about them. When troubleshooting a startup 
problem, follow procedures to interview the user, back up important data or verify you have 
current backups, research and identify any error messages, and determine what has just changed that might 
be the source of the problem.
When you know the source of the problem, decide which tool will be the least invasive to use, yet still 
will fix the problem. If that doesn’t work, move on to the next tool. Remember that tools are described 
earlier in the chapter from least to most invasive. Here’s a recap of some of the more important tools 
discussed earlier:
	 Multiple restarts of Windows 8
	 Startup repair
	 Boot logging to help you better understand the problem
	 From a command prompt, chkdsk and SFC
	 Memory Diagnostics
	 Safe Mode and then a clean boot
	 Use anti-malware software to scan for malware
	 System Restore
	 System Configuration and Task Manager to reduce startup programs and services
	 Refresh the computer
	 Reset the computer

Important Data on the Hard Drive
Troubleshooting a computer problem should always start with the most important 
question: Is there important data on the hard drive not backed up? Even if data is lost or 
corrupted, you might be able to recover it using Windows tools, third-party file recovery 
software, or commercial data recovery services. One good product is GetDataBack by 
Runtime Software (www.runtime.org), which can recover data and program files even when Windows 
cannot recognize the drive.
For less than $30, you can purchase a SATA-to-USB converter kit (see Figure 13-39) that includes a data 
cable and power adapter. You can use one of these kits to temporarily connect a desktop or laptop hard 
drive to a USB port on a working computer. Set the drive beside your computer and plug one end of the 
data cable into the drive and the other into the USB port. The AC adapter supplies power to the drive. 
While power is getting to the drive, be careful to not touch the circuit board on the drive.

Using File Explorer or Windows Explorer, you can browse the drive and copy data to other media. After 
you have saved the data, you can use diagnostic software from the hard drive manufacturer to examine the 
drive and possibly repair it or return the drive to its own computer and start troubleshooting there.
Error Messages and Problems
Table 13-5 summarizes some symptoms and error messages caused by hardware, device drivers, 
or Windows that prevent Windows from booting. Hardware errors can present as errors 
messages on a black screen or a Windows blue screen of death (BSOD) stop error. A stop error 
can be caused by a corrupted registry, a system file that is missing or damaged, a device driver 
that is missing or damaged, bad memory, or a corrupted or failing hard drive. Also, sometimes Windows 
hangs with the pinwheel spinning, continuously restarts, or does an abrupt and improper shutdown.
A+  
220-902 
4.1
Symptom or Error Message
Description and What to Do
A disk read error occurred
Nonsystem disk or disk error
Invalid boot disk
Hard drive not found
Disk boot failure
No boot device found
Startup UEFI/BIOS cannot communicate with the hard drive. Check UEFI/BIOS 
setup for the boot sequence and try to boot from another device. This is likely a 
hardware problem.
For Windows 8, try going into UEFI/BIOS setup and disabling any quick boot 
features. This causes UEFI/BIOS to do a more thorough job of POST and reports 
more information on the screen as it performs POST.
The drive might be failing. To recover data from the drive, move it to another 
computer and install it as a second hard drive.
Invalid partition table
Invalid drive specification
Error loading operating system
Missing operating system
Drive not recognized
MBR sector is damaged or the active partition is corrupt or missing. Use the 
repair commands from the Windows RE command prompt window.
Operating system not found
Missing operating system
Missing bootmgr
Windows system files are missing or corrupted. Boot to Windows RE and use tools 
there. First try startup repair. Use chkdsk to fix hard drive errors. Use System File 
Checker (SFC) to restore Windows system files. Try System Restore.
Automatically boots into  
Safe Mode
This action can occur when Windows recognizes a problem with the registry or other 
startup files. Attempt to use System Restore to apply a restore point. For Windows 7,  
use the Last Known Good Configuration on the Advanced Boot Options menu.

Troubleshooting Windows Startup
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know how to use System Information (msconfig.exe) to help 
you resolve a Windows startup problem.
Next, we give a few more details about several of the errors listed in Table 13-5.
BSOD or Stop Errors
A BSOD, or stop error, happens when processes running in kernel mode encounter a problem and Windows 
must stop the system. In such situations, a blue screen appears with a cryptic error message such as the one 
in Figure 13-40. Look on the blue screen for the stop error at the top and the specific number of the error 
near the bottom of the screen, as labeled in Figure 13-40.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know about the Windows XP Ntldr boot loader program, a 
repair disk, and the Recovery Console. When starting Windows XP, a “missing Ntldr” error message can be resolved by 
booting the system from a Windows XP repair disk. After booting from the floppy disk, you can launch the Windows XP 
Recovery Console and use commands in this console to copy the Ntldr program file on the floppy disk to the hard drive.
Symptom or Error Message
Description and What to Do
No graphics appear when  
Windows is started
A missing graphical interface or the graphical interface fails to load is caused by 
hardware or the Windows kernel failing to load. To solve problems with critical 
startup files that load the Windows kernel, use the tools in Windows RE. Begin 
with startup repair.
Missing Boot Configuration Data
The BCD store is corrupted or missing. Sometimes a virus can corrupt the BCD. 
Launch Windows RE and try a startup repair. If this doesn’t solve the problem, 
go to a Windows RE command prompt and rebuild the BCD, using the bootrec /
rebuildBCD command.
Stop error, or BSOD occurs  
during startup
Use the Microsoft website to research the exact error message and error code. Use 
the startup repair tool and then examine the log file it creates at C:\Windows\
System32\LogFiles\Srt\Srttrail.txt. If you can launch Windows, make sure all 
critical or important Windows updates are installed.
Improper shutdown
This problem can be caused by overheating, a hardware problem, or the Windows 
kernel. After a restart, check Event Viewer for clues, apply Windows updates, verify 
memory with Memory Diagnostics, and use chkdsk to check the hard drive for errors.
Spontaneous shutdowns  
and restarts
First, use the Startup Settings screen (refer back to Figure 13-26) to disable 
the automatic restarts so that you can view the error messages on screen and 
troubleshoot the underlying problem. Research the error messages on screen as 
you would a BSOD error. Use the startup repair tool and then examine the log file 
it creates at C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Srt\Srttrail.txt.
Device fails to start or is not 
detected
Address this issue first as a hardware problem. Check the device’s cable 
connections. Try the device in a working computer. Check Device Manager for 
errors reported. Use Device Manager to uninstall the device and restart Windows. 
Search the device manufacturer’s website for troubleshooting procedures and to 
download diagnostic software for the device. Restart the system and enable boot 
logging. Check the Ntbtlog.txt file to see if the correct driver files loaded.
Errors after the user has signed 
in to Windows
For application errors, use System Configuration (msconfig.exe) and Task 
Manager to perform a clean boot. If the error goes away, research each non-
Microsoft program or service to find the problem. Try to repair the application. 
If the error persists, uninstall and reinstall the application. For Windows errors, 
boot into Safe Mode and run System File Checker, System Restore, chkdsk /r, and 
Memory Diagnostics. Install all critical and important Windows updates. Check 
the Ntbtlog.txt log file for clues. Compare it with one made during a normal boot 
with Enable Boot Logging selected.

Stop errors can occur during or after startup. Here’s what to do when you get a stop error:
1. As for the tools useful in solving stop errors, put the web at the top of your list! (But don’t forget that 
some sites are unreliable and others mean you harm.) Search the Microsoft website on the two items 
labeled in Figure 13-40.
2. If the blue screen names the device driver or service that caused the problem, use File Explorer or 
Windows Explorer on a working computer to locate the program file. Driver files are stored in the  
C:\Windows\System32\drivers folder. Right-click the file and select Properties from the shortcut menu. 
The Details tab of the Properties box tells you the purpose of the file (see Figure 13-41). You can then 
reinstall the device or program that caused the problem.

Troubleshooting Windows Startup
A+ Exam Tip
The 220-902 exam expects you to know how to solve problems when the system shuts down improperly.
3. Reboot the system. Immediately after a reboot following a stop error, Windows displays an error 
message box or bubble with useful information. Follow the links in the box.
4. Check Event Viewer, which might provide events it has logged. Recall that critical errors and warnings 
are recorded in the Administrative Events log.
5. Also check Archived Messages in the Action Center for clues.
6. Use Windows Updates to apply all important and critical updates.
7. Undo any recent changes to the system. If you are not sure which changes to undo, consider using 
System Restore to restore the system to the point in time before the problem started.
8. Use the Memory Diagnostics tool to check memory and use chkdsk with the /r parameter to check 
the hard drive for errors. If the problem is still not resolved, you might need to repair Windows 
system files by using System File Checker, Safe Mode, or other Windows startup repair tools 
discussed in this chapter.
Dealing with Improper Shutdowns
Improper shutdowns and a system lockup that cause a computer to freeze and require that it be restarted are 
most likely caused by hardware. Hardware that can cause these errors include memory, the motherboard, CPU, 
video card, or the system overheating. I/O devices such as the keyboard, mouse, or monitor or application 
errors don’t usually cause these types of catastrophic problems.
When these types of errors occur, try and check these things:
1. Check Event Viewer to see if it has reported a hardware failure.
2. Apply any important or critical Windows updates.
3. Use Memory Diagnostics and chkdsk with the /r parameter to check memory and the hard drive 
for errors.
4. If you suspect overheating is a problem, immediately after the lockup, go into UEFI/BIOS setup and 
check the temperature of the CPU, which, for most CPUs, should not exceed 38 degrees C. Alternately, 
you can install a freeware utility, such as SpeedFan by Alfredo Comparetti (www.almico.com) to monitor 
the temperature of the motherboard or hard drive.
When solving problems with any kind of hardware, it’s important that you check for physical damage 
to the device. If you feel excessive heat coming from the computer case or a peripheral device, immediately 
unplug the device or power down the system. Don’t turn the device or system back on until the problem is 
solved; you don’t want to start a fire! Other symptoms that indicate potential danger are strong electrical 
odors, unusual noises, no noise (such as when the fan is not working to keep the system cool), liquid spills 
on a device, and visible damage such as a frayed cable, melted plastic, or smoke. In these situations, turn 
off the equipment immediately.
A Device or Service Fails to Start
After you believe you’ve identified a service or device preventing a normal boot, boot into Safe Mode  
and use Device Manager to disable the device or use the Services console to disable the service. Then 
reboot, and, if the problem goes away, replace the driver or service program file and then enable the 
driver or service.

Chapter Summary
If you cannot boot into Safe Mode, open the command prompt window in Windows RE. Then back up 
the registry and open the Registry Editor using the regedit command. Drill down to the service or device 
key. The key that loads services and drivers can be found in this location:
HKEY__LOCAL__MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
Disable the service or driver by changing the Start value to 0x4. Close the Registry Editor and reboot. If 
the problem goes away, use the copy command to replace the service or driver program file, and restart the 
service or driver.
Rebuild Pagefile.sys
If a stop error indicates that Pagefile.sys is corrupted, you can rebuild the file. Search the support.

Understanding the Boot Process
	 When you first turn on a system, startup UEFI/BIOS on the motherboard takes control to examine hardware 
components and find an operating system to load.
	 UEFI stores information, drivers, and applications used for the startup in NVRAM and the EFI System 
Partition (ESP).
	 Windows startup is managed by the Windows Boot Manager. For a BIOS system, the program is bootmgr. 
For a UEFI system, the program is bootmgfw.efi. The Windows Boot Loader is winload.exe or winload.efi. 
The Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store contains Windows startup settings.
Tools for Troubleshooting Windows Startup Problems
	 Before a problem occurs, make sure you have good backups of user data and a Windows 8 custom 
refresh image or a Windows 7 system image. You might also want to create a Windows 8 recovery drive 
and configure Windows 8 to use F8 at startup, which launches the Advanced Boot Options screen.
	 The Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE) can be started from within Windows, from the 
Windows setup DVD, or from a recovery drive. For Windows 7, press F8 at startup to launch Windows RE.
	 Tools for startup troubleshooting include startup repair, Memory Diagnostics, System Restore, Safe 
Mode, enabling boot logging, refresh, reset, and applying a Windows 7 system image.
	 Commands that might be useful when repairing Windows include bootrec, bcdedit, diskpart, chkdsk, and sfc.

Troubleshooting Windows Startup
	 If a hard drive contains valuable data but will not boot, you might be able to recover the data by 
installing the drive in another system as the second, nonbooting hard drive in the system.
	 Use the web to research stop errors on the error title and error number listed on the blue screen.
	 Improper shutdowns are most likely hardware related. Event Viewer might record failures. Use Memory 
Diagnostics and chkdsk to check memory and the hard drive. Consider overheating and monitor the 
system temperature.
	 When a device or service causes the system to hang during a normal boot, boot into Safe Mode and 
disable the device or service. Then you can replace the drivers or service program file.

Real Problem 13-1 Summarizing Windows Troubleshooting Tools
In the chapter “Supporting Customers and Troubleshooting Windows,” you started building a reference 
table of tools available in Windows for troubleshooting. In this project, you will expand your table to 
include new tools covered in this chapter.
1.		 Return to your tools reference table from the chapter “Supporting Customers and Troubleshooting 
Windows.” Under the Tool heading, add to your list all of the Windows tools covered in this chapter, 
such as Safe Mode and startup repair.
2.		 Complete the remainder of the table with the steps needed to access each tool and a brief, one- or  
two-sentence description of each. Be sure to include the program name of the utility if it can be 
launched from the command prompt. Also be sure to note whether a tool is available only for certain 
releases of Windows, such as “New with Windows 8.”
Real Problem 13-2 Sabotaging a Windows System
In a lab environment, follow these steps to find out if you can corrupt a Windows system so that it will 
not boot, and then repair the system. (This problem can be done using a Windows installation in a virtual 
machine.) Don’t forget about the takeown and icacls commands discussed in this chapter.
1.		 Rename or move one of the program files listed in Table 13-1. Which program file did you select? In 
what folder did you find it?
2.		 Restart your system. Did an error occur? Check in Explorer. Is the file restored? What Windows 
feature repaired the problem?
3.		 Try other methods of sabotaging the Windows system, but carefully record exactly what you did to 
sabotage the boot. Can you make the boot fail?
4.		 Now recover the Windows system. List the steps you took to get the system back to good 
working order.

Connecting To and Setting Up a Network
Understanding TCP/IP and Windows Networking
When two computers communicate using a local network or the Internet, communication 
happens at three levels (hardware, operating system, and application). The first step in 
communication is one computer must find the other computer. The second step is both 
computers must agree on the methods and rules for communication (called protocols). 
Then one computer takes on the role of making requests from the other computer. A computer making 
a request from another is called the client and the one answering the request is called the server. Most 
communication between computers on a network or the Internet uses this client/server model. For example, 
in Figure 14-1, someone uses a web browser on a client to request a webpage from a web server. To handle 
this request, the client computer must first find the web server, the protocols for communication are 
established, and then the request is made and answered. Hardware, the OS, and the applications on both 
computers are all involved in this process.

Let’s first look at the layers of communication that involve hardware, the OS, and applications and 
then see how computers are addressed and found on a network or the Internet. Then we’ll see how  
a client/server request is made by the client and answered by the server.
Layers of Network Communication
When your computer at home is connected to your Internet service provider (ISP) 
off somewhere in the distance, your computer and a computer on the Internet must be 
able to communicate. When two devices communicate, they must use the same protocols 
so that the communication makes sense. For almost all networks today, including the 
Internet, the group or suite of protocols used is called TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/
Internet Protocol).
Communication between two computers happens in layers. In Figure 14-2, you can see how 
communication starts with an application (browser) passing a request to the OS, which passes the 
request to the network card and then on to the network. When the request reaches the network card 
on the server, the network card passes it on to the OS and then the OS passes it on to the application 
(the web server).

Listed next is a description of each level of communication:
	Level 1: Hardware level. At the root level of communication is hardware. The hardware or physical 
connection might be wireless or might use network cables, phone lines (for DSL or dial-up), or TV 
cable lines (for a cable modem). For local wired or wireless networks, a network adapter (also called a 
network card, a network interface card, or a NIC) inside your computer is part of this physical 
network. Every network adapter (including a network card, network port on a motherboard, onboard 
wireless, or wireless NIC) has a 48-bit (6-byte) number hard-coded on the card by its manufacturer that 
is unique for that device (see Figure 14-3). The number is written in hexadecimal, and is called the 
MAC (Media Access Control) address, hardware address, physical address, adapter address, or Ethernet 
address. Part of the MAC address identifies the manufacturer that is responsible for making sure that 
no two network adapters have the same MAC address. MAC addresses are used to locate a computer 
on a local area network (LAN). A local area network (LAN) is a network bound by routers or other 
gateway devices. A router is a device that manages traffic between two or more networks and can help 
find the best path for traffic to get from one network to another. A gateway is any device or computer 
that network traffic can use to leave one network and go to a different network.

	Level 2: Operating system level. Operating systems use IP addresses to find other computers on a 
network. An IP address is a 32-bit or 128-bit string that is assigned to a network connection when the 
connection is first made. Whereas a MAC address is only used to find a computer on a local network, 
an IP address can be used to find a computer anywhere on the Internet (see Figure 14-4) or on an 
intranet. An intranet is any private network that uses TCP/IP protocols. A large enterprise might 
support an intranet that is made up of several local networks. A local network can further be divided 
into smaller networks and each of these smaller networks is called a subnetwork or subnet. IP addresses 
are used to find computers on subnets, an intranet, or the Internet.

	Level 3: Application level. Most applications used on the Internet or a local network are client/server 
applications. Client applications, such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or Outlook, communicate with 
server applications such as a web server or email server. Each client and server application installed on a 
computer listens at a predetermined address that uniquely identifies the application on the computer. This 
address is a number and is called a port number, port, or port address. For example, you can address a web 
server by entering into a browser address box an IP address followed by a colon and then 80, which is the port 
number for a web server application. Suppose a computer with an IP address of 136.60.30.5 is running both 
an email server, which listens at port 25, and a web server application listening at port 80. If a client computer 
sends a request to 136.60.30.5:25, the email server that is listening at that port responds. On the other hand, 
if a request is sent to 136.60.30.5:80, the web server listening at port 80 responds (see Figure 14-5).

Figure 14-6 shows how communication moves from a browser to the OS to the hardware on one 
computer and on to the hardware, OS, and web server on a remote computer. As you connect a computer 
to a network, keep in mind that the connection must work at all three levels. And when things don’t work 
right, it helps to understand that you must solve the problem at one or more levels. In other words, the 
problem might be with the physical equipment, with the OS, or with the application.

Connecting To and Setting Up a Network
Before a message is transmitted on a network, if it is too long, it’s broken up into segments. Also, header 
and trailer information are added, including the IP addresses of the source computer and destination computer, 
the application’s port number, and the protocols for communication the message uses on the network. When 
this information is added, the message is called a segment, datagram, packet, or frame depending on what 
information has been added to the header and trailer and which layer of communication added the information.
How IP Addresses Get Assigned
An IP address has 32 bits or 128 bits. When the Internet and TCP/IP were first invented, 
it seemed that 32 bits were more than enough to satisfy any needs we might have for IP 
addresses because this standard, called Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), created about four 
billion potential IP addresses. Today we need many more than four billion IP addresses over 
the world. Partly because of a shortage of 32-bit IP addresses, Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), which 
uses an IP address with 128 bits, was developed. Currently, the Internet uses a mix of 32-bit and 128-bit 
IP addresses. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA at iana.org) is responsible for keeping track 
of assigned IP addresses and has already released all its available 32-bit IP addresses. IP addresses leased 
from IANA today are all 128-bit addresses.
A MAC address is embedded on a network adapter at the factory, but IP addresses are assigned manually 
or by software. Recall that an IP address can be a dynamic IP address (IP address is assigned by a server 
each time the computer or device connects to the network) or a static IP address (IP address is permanently 
assigned to the computer or device).
A+  
220-901 
2.3, 2.4
For dynamic IP addresses, a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server gives an IP address 
to a computer when it first attempts to initiate a connection to the network and requests an IP address. 
A computer or other device (such as a network printer) that requests an address from a DHCP server is 
called a DHCP client. It is said that the client is leasing an IP address. A DHCP server that serves up IPv6 
addresses is often called a DHCPv6 server. How to configure a Windows computer to use dynamic or 
static IP addressing is covered later in the chapter.
Next, let’s see how IPv4 addresses are used, and then you’ll learn about IPv6 addresses.
How IPv4 Addresses Are Used
A 32-bit IP address is organized into four groups of 8 bits each, which are presented as four 
decimal numbers separated by periods, such as 72.56.105.12. The largest possible 8-bit 
number is 11111111, which is equal to 255 in decimal, so the largest possible IP address in 
decimal is 255.255.255.255, which in binary is 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111. 
Each of the four numbers separated by periods is called an octet (for 8 bits) and can be any number from 
0 to 255, making a total of about 4.3 billion IP addresses (256 × 256 × 256 × 256). Some IP addresses are 
reserved, so these numbers are approximations. IP addresses that are reserved for special use by TCP/IP 
and should not be assigned to a device on a network are listed in Table 14-1.

The first part of an IP address identifies the network, and the last part identifies the host. When 
messages are routed over the Internet, the network portion of the IP address is used to locate the right 
local network. After the message arrives at the local network, the host portion of the IP address is used 
to identify the one computer on the network that is to receive the message. How does a computer or other 
network device know what part of an IP address identifies the network and what part identifies the host? 
It relies on a subnet mask for this information.
Subnet Masks
The subnet mask identifies which part of an IP address is the network portion and which part is the host 
portion. A computer or other device can use its subnet mask to know if an IP address of another computer 
is on its network or another network (see Figure 14-7).

My IP address and subnet mask tell
me that the host is somewhere in my
network. Wait here until we find it.
Figure 14-7  A host (router, in this case) can always determine if an IP address is on its network
A subnet mask has 32 bits and is a string of 1s followed by a string of 0s, for example, 11111111.1111
1111.11110000.00000000. The 1s in a subnet mask say, “On our network, this part of an IP address is the 
network part,” and the group of 0s says, “On our network, this part of an IP address is the host part.” On 
Windows screens, a subnet mask is displayed in decimal, for example the subnet mask of 11111111.11111
111.00000000.00000000 is 255.255.0.0 in decimal.
Suppose the IP address of a computer on Network A is 201.18.20.160 and the subnet mask is 11111111
.11111111.00000000.00000000. The subnet mask tells Windows that the first 16 bits or two octets of the 
IP address is the network ID. Therefore, when Windows is deciding how to communicate with a computer 
that has an IP address of 201.18.20.208, it knows the computer is on its own network, but a computer 
with an IP address of 201.19.23.160 is on another network.

Let’s look at one more example. Suppose the IP address of a computer is 19.200.60.6 and its subnet 
mask is 255.255.240.0. Is a computer with the IP address 19.200.51.100 on its network? Here’s the logic 
to find out:
Sometimes an IP address and subnet mask are written using a shorthand notation like 15.50.212.59/20, 
where the /20 means that the first 20 bits in the IP address identify the network. This notation is sometimes 
called slash notation or CIDR notation (pronounced “cider notation”), named after the CIDR (Classless 
Interdomain Routing) standards that were written in 1993 about subnetting.
Question
Answer
1.	 What is my IP address in binary?
19.200.60.6 in binary is: 00010011.11001000.00111100.00000110.
2.	 What is the other IP address in binary?
19.200.51.100 in binary is: 00010011.11001000.00110011.01100100.
3.	 Based on my subnet mask, how many 
bits in my IP address identify my 
network?
255.255.240.0 in binary is: 11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000.
20 bits identify the network.
4.	 Do the first 20 bits in my IP address 
match the first 20 bits in the other  
IP address?
Compare the 20 red bits in the two IP addresses: 
00010011.11001000.00111100.00000110
00010011.11001000.00110011.01100100 
Yes, they match.
5.	 Is the other IP address on my network?
Yes.

Public, Private, and Automatic Private IP Addresses
IP addresses available to the Internet are called public IP addresses. To conserve the number of public IP 
addresses, some blocks of IP addresses have been designated as private IP addresses that are not allowed 
on the Internet. Private IP addresses are used within a company’s private network, and computers on this 
network can communicate with one another using these private IP addresses.
IEEE recommends that the following IP addresses be used for private networks:
	 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255
	 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.255.255
	 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255
If a computer first connects to the network that is using dynamic IP addressing and is unable to lease an 
IP address from the DHCP server, it generates its own Automatic Private IP Address (APIPA) in the address 
range 169.254.x.y.

NAT (Network Address Translation) is a technique designed to conserve the number of public 
IP addresses needed by a network. A router or other gateway device stands between a private network 
and the Internet and substitutes the private IP addresses used by computers on the private network 
with its own public IP address when these computers need access to the Internet. See Figure 14-9. Besides 
conserving public IP addresses, another advantage of NAT is security; the gateway hides the entire private 
network behind this one address.
Notes IEEE, a nonprofit organization, is responsible for many Internet standards. Standards are proposed to the 
networking community in the form of an RFC (Request for Comment). RFC 1918 outlines recommendations for private IP 
addresses. To view an RFC, visit the website www.rfc-editor.org.

How IPv6 Addresses Are Used
Using the IPv6 standards, more has changed than just the number of bits in an IP address. To 
improve routing capabilities and speed of communication, IPv6 changed the way IP addresses 
are used to find computers on the Internet. Let’s begin our discussion of IPv6 by looking at 
how IPv6 addresses are written and displayed:
	 An IPv6 address has 128 bits that are written as eight blocks of hexadecimal numbers separated by 
colons, like this: 2001:0000:0B80:0000:0000:00D3:9C5A:00CC.
	 Each block is 16 bits. For example, the first block in the address above is 2001 in hex, which can be 
written as 0010 0000 0000 0001 in binary.
	 Leading zeros in a four-character hex block can be eliminated. For example, the IP address above can be 
written as 2001:0000:B80:0000:0000:D3:9C5A:CC.

	 If blocks contain all zeros, they can be written as double colons (::). The IP address above can be written 
two ways:
	 2001::B80:0000:0000:D3:9C5A:CC
	 2001:0000:B80::D3:9C5A:CC
To avoid confusion, only one set of double colons is used in an IP address. In this example, the preferred 
method is the second one: 2001:0000:B80::D3:9C5A:CC because the address is written with the fewest zeros.
The way computers communicate using IPv6 has changed the terminology used to describe TCP/IP 
communication. Here are a few terms used in the IPv6 standards:
	 A link, sometimes called the local link, or local network, is a local area network (LAN) or wide area 
network (WAN) bounded by routers.
	 A node is any device that connects to the network, such as a computer, printer, or router. An interface 
is a node’s attachment to a link. The attachment can be a logical attachment, such as when a virtual 
machine connects to the network, or a physical attachment, such as when a network adapter connects 
to the wired network.
	 The last 64 bits or 4 blocks of an IP address identify the interface and are called the interface ID or interface 
identifier. These 64 bits uniquely identify an interface on the local network.
	 Neighbors are nodes on the same local network.
So far, very few networks solely use IPv6. Most networks, including the Internet, rely on IPv4 protocols. On 
IPv4 networks, tunnels are used to allow IPv6 messages to travel on the network. A tunnel works by encapsulating 
an IPv6 message inside an IPv4 message. Two common tunneling protocols are ISATAP (pronounced “eye-sa-tap” 
and stands for Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol) and Teredo (pronounced “ter-EE-do”), which is 
named after the Teredo worm that bores holes in wood. Teredo IPv6 addresses begin with 2001.
IPv6 supports these three types of IP addresses:
	 A unicast address is used to send messages to a single node on a network. Three types of unicast 
addresses are link-local addresses, unique local addresses, and global addresses.
	 A multicast address is used to deliver messages to all nodes in a targeted, multicast group, such as when 
video is streaming from a server to multiple nodes on a network.
	 An anycast address is used 
by routers and can identify 
multiple destinations and a 
message is delivered only to the 
closest destination.
Recall that with IPv4 
broadcasting, messages are 
sent to every node on a local 
network. However, IPv6 doesn’t 
use broadcasting, which reduces 
network traffic. The concepts 
of broadcasting, multicasting, 
anycasting, and unicasting are 
illustrated in Figure 14-11.
Table 14-3 lists the currently used 
address prefixes for these types of 
IP addresses. In the future, we can 
expect more prefixes to be assigned 
as they are needed.

Here is a description of the three types of unicast addresses:
	 A link-local unicast address, also called a link-local address or local address, can be used for communi-
cating with neighboring nodes in the same link (the local network). These local addresses are similar to 
IPv4 private IP addresses and most begin with FE80::/64. (This prefix notation means the address begins 
with FE80 followed by enough zeros to make 64 bits.) Link-local addresses are not allowed on the 
Internet or allowed to travel outside private networks. Look back at Figure 14-10 to see an example of 
a link-local address where the wireless interface has the IPv6 address of fe80::dcc8:2a19:e752:769f. The 
first 64 bits are fe80:: and the interface ID is dcc8:2a19:e752:769f.

	 A unique local address is a private address that can travel across subnets within the private network. 
These addresses are used by network administrators when subnetting a large network.
	 A global unicast address, also called a global address, can be routed on the Internet. These addresses 
are similar to IPv4 public IP addresses. The first 48 bits of the address is the Global Routing Prefix. 
When an ISP assigns a global address to a customer, it’s these 48 bits that it assigns. An organization 
that leases one Global Routing Prefix from its ISP can use it to generate many IPv6 global addresses.
Subnets
IPv6 uses subnetting but doesn’t need a subnet mask because the subnet ID that identifies a subnet is part 
of the IPv6 address. The subnet ID is the 16 bits following the first 48 bits of the address. When a large 
IPv6 network is subnetted, a DHCPv6 server assigns a node in a subnet a global address or unique local 
address that contains the correct subnet ID for the node’s subnet.

In summary, let’s use the ipconfig command to take a look at the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses

Notice in the figure the four IP addresses that have been assigned to the physical connections:
	 Windows has assigned the wireless connection two IP addresses, one IPv4 address and one IPv6 address.
	 The Ethernet LAN connection has also been assigned an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address.
The IPv6 addresses are followed by a % sign and a number; for example, %5 follows the first IP address. 
This number is called the zone ID or scope ID and is used to identify the interface in a list of interfaces for 
this computer.

Connecting To and Setting Up a Network
IPv6 addressing is designed so that a computer can self-configure its own link-local IP address, which is 
similar to how IPv4 uses an Automatic Private IP Address (APIPA). Here’s what happens when a computer 
using IPv6 first makes a network connection:
1. The computer creates its IPv6 address by using the FE80::/64 prefix and uses its MAC address 
to generate an interface ID for the last 64 bits.
2. It then performs a duplicate address detection process to make sure its IP address is unique on 
the network.
3. Next, it asks if a DHCPv6 server is present on the network to provide configuration information. If a 
server responds with DHCP information, the computer uses whatever information this might be, such 
as the IP addresses of DNS servers or its own IP address. Because a computer can generate its own 
link-local IP address, a DHCPv6 server usually serves up only global or unique local addresses.

Character-Based Names Identify Computers and Networks
Remembering an IP address is not always easy, so character-based names are used to substitute 
for IP addresses. Here are the possibilities:
A+  
220-901 
2.3, 2.4
	 A host name, also called a computer name, is the name of a computer and can be used in 
place of its IP address. The name can have up to 63 characters, including letters, numbers, 
and special characters. Examples of computer names are www, ftp, Jean’s Computer, TestBox3, and 
PinkLaptop. Recall you can assign a computer name while installing Windows. In addition, you can 
change the computer name at any time using the System window:
1. For Windows 8, press Win+X and click System. For Windows 7, open Control Panel in Classic view 
and click System. In the System window, click Advanced system settings.
2. In the System Properties box, on the Computer Name tab (see Figure 14-14), click Change. You will 
need to restart your computer for the change to take effect.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to be familiar with client-side DNS and the A+ 220-902 exam 
expects you to be able to configure DNS on a client computer.
Notes When you enter a fully qualified domain name such as www.cengage.com in a browser address bar, that name 
is translated into an IP address followed by a port number. It’s interesting to know that you can skip the translation step 
and enter the IP address and port number in the address box. See Figure 14-15.
	 Recall that a workgroup is a group of computers on a peer-to-peer network that are sharing resources. 
The workgroup name assigned to this group is only recognized within the local network.
	 A domain name identifies a network. Examples of domain names are the names that appear before 
the period in microsoft.com, course.com, and mycompany.com. The letters after the period are called 
the top-level domain and tell you something about the domain. Examples are .com (commercial), .org 
(nonprofit), .gov (government), and .info (general use).
	 A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) identifies a computer and the network to which it belongs. 
An example of an FQDN is www.cengage.com. The host name is www (a web server), cengage is 
the domain name, and com is the top-level domain name of the Cengage network. Another FQDN 
is joesmith.mycompany.com.
On the Internet, a fully qualified domain name must be associated with an IP address before this 
computer can be found. This process of associating a character-based name with an IP address is called 
name resolution. The DNS (Domain Name System or Domain Name Service) protocol is used by a DNS 
server to find an IP address for a computer when the fully qualified domain name is known. On home or 
small company networks, the ISP is responsible for providing access to one or more DNS servers as part 
of the service it provides for Internet access. Larger corporations have their own DNS servers to perform 
name resolution for the enterprise network. When an individual or organization, which has its own DNS 
servers, leases a public IP address and domain name and sets up a website, it is responsible for entering the 
name resolution information into its primary DNS server. This server can present the information to other 
DNS servers on the web and is called the authoritative name server for the website.
Figure 14-15  A website can be accessed by its IP address and port number: 
http://69.32.208.74:80
When Windows is trying to resolve a computer name to an IP address, it first looks in the DNS cache 
it holds in memory. If the computer name is not found in the cache, Windows then turns to a DNS server 
if it has the IP address of the server. When Windows queries the DNS server for a name resolution, it is 
called the DNS client.

Operating systems and client/server applications on the Internet all use protocols that are 
supported by TCP/IP. The left side of Figure 14-16 shows these different layers of protocols 
and how they relate to one another. As you read this section, this figure can serve as your

layers. In the OSI model, protocols used by hardware are divided into two layers (Data Link and Physical layers), and 
TCP/IP protocols used by the OS are divided into five layers (Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application 
layers). These seven layers are shown on the right side of Figure 14-16.

In the following sections, the more significant applications and operating system protocols are introduced. 
However, you should know that the TCP/IP protocol suite includes more protocols than just those mentioned 
in this chapter; only some of them are shown in Figure 14-16.
TCP/IP Protocols Used by the OS
Looking back at Figure 14-16, you can see three layers of protocols between the applications and the hardware 
protocols. These three layers make up the heart of TCP/IP communication. In the figure, TCP or UDP manages 
communication with the applications protocols above them as well as the protocols shown underneath TCP 
and UDP, which control communication on the network.
TCP Guarantees Delivery 
Remember that all communication on a network happens by way of messages delivered from one location 
on the network to another. In TCP/IP, the protocol that guarantees message delivery is TCP (Transmission 
Control Protocol). TCP makes a connection, sends the data, checks whether the data is received, and 
resends it if it is not. TCP is, therefore, called a connection-oriented protocol. TCP is used by applications 
such as web browsers and email. Guaranteed delivery takes longer and is used when it is important to 
know that the data reached its destination.
For TCP to guarantee delivery, it uses protocols at the IP layer to establish a session between client and server 
to verify that communication has taken place. When a TCP message reaches its destination, an acknowledgment 
is sent back to the source (see Figure 14-17). If the source TCP does not receive the acknowledgment, it resends 
the data or passes an error message back to the higher-level application protocol.

Figure 14-17  TCP guarantees delivery by requesting an acknowledgment
UDP Provides Fast Transmissions 
On the other hand, UDP (User 
Datagram Protocol) does not 
guarantee delivery by first connecting 
and checking whether data is received; 
thus, UDP is called a connectionless 
protocol or best-effort protocol. 
UDP is used for broadcasting, such 
as streaming video or sound over the 
web, where guaranteed delivery is not 
as important as fast transmission. UDP 
is also used to monitor network traffic.
TCP/IP Protocols Used by Applications
Some common applications that use the Internet are web browsers, email, chat, FTP, Telnet, Remote 
Desktop, and Remote Assistance. Here is a bit of information about several of the protocols used by these 
and other applications:
	 HTTP. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for the World Wide Web and  
used by web browsers and web servers to communicate. You can see when a browser is using this 
protocol by looking for http at the beginning of a URL in the address bar of a browser, such as  
http://www.microsoft.com.
	 HTTPS. HTTPS (HTTP secure) refers to the HTTP protocol working with a security protocol such 
as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS), which is better than SSL, to create

a secured socket. A socket is a connection between a browser and web server. HTTPS is used by web 
browsers and servers to secure the socket by encrypting the data before it is sent and then decrypting it 
before the data is processed. To know a secured protocol is being used, look for https in the URL, as in 
https://www.wellsfargo.com.
	 SMTP. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used to send an email message to its destination 
(see Figure 14-18). The email server that takes care of sending email messages (using the SMTP 
protocol) is often referred to as the SMTP server.

POP3 or IMAP4
Figure 14-18  The SMTP protocol is used to send email to a recipient’s mail server, and the POP3 or IMAP4 protocol is 
used by the client to receive email
	 POP and IMAP. After an email message arrives at the destination email server, it remains there until 
the recipient requests delivery. The recipient’s email server uses one of two protocols to deliver the 
message:  POP3 (Post Office Protocol, version 3) or IMAP4 (Internet Message Access Protocol, 
version 4). Using POP3, email is downloaded to the client computer and, unless the default setting 
is changed, the email is then deleted from the email server. Using IMAP, the client application manages 
the email stored on the server.
	 Telnet. The Telnet protocol is used by Telnet client/server applications to allow an administrator or 
other user to control a computer remotely. Telnet is not considered secure because transmissions in 
Telnet are not encrypted.
	 LDAP. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is used by various client applications when the 
application needs to query a database. For example, an email client on a corporate network might 
query a database that contains the email addresses for all employees or an application might query a 
database of printers looking for a printer on the corporate network or Internet. Data sent and received 
using the LDAP protocol is not encrypted; therefore, an encryption layer is sometimes added to LDAP 
transmissions.
	 SMB. Server Message Block (SMB) is a file access protocol originally developed by IBM and used 
by Windows to share files and printers on a network. The current release of the SMB protocol is CIFS, 
also called SMB2.
	 AFP. AFP (Apple Filing Protocol) is a file access protocol used by early editions of the Mac operating 
system by Apple and is one protocol in the suite of Apple networking protocols called AppleTalk. (TCP/
IP has replaced AppleTalk for most networking protocols in the Mac OS.) Current Mac OS releases use 
SMB2 for file access, and support AFP for backward compatibility with earlier versions of the Mac OS.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know about the following application protocols: FTP, SSH, 
Telnet, SMTP, DNS, HTTP, POP3, IMAP, HTTPS, RDP, SMB, AFP, DHCP, LDAP, SNMP, and CIFS.
	 CIFS. CIFS (Common Internet File System), also called SMB2, is a file access protocol and the  
cross-platform version of SMB used between Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and other operating systems.
	 FTP. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used to transfer files between two computers. Web browsers can use 
the protocol. Also, third-party FTP client software, such as CuteFTP by GlobalSCAPE (www.cuteftp.com) 
and others, offers more features for file transfer than does a browser. By default, FTP transmissions are 
not secure. Secure FTP (SFTP) uses SSH encryption.
	 SSH. The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol encrypts transmission so they cannot be intercepted by a hacker. 
SSH is used in various situations for encryption, such as SFTP. SSH is commonly used in Linux to pass 
sign-in information to a remote computer and control that computer over a network. Because it’s secure, 
SSH is preferred over Telnet on Linux systems.
	 SNMP. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is used to monitor network traffic. It is used by 
the Microsoft SNMP Agent application that monitors traffic on a network and helps balance that traffic.
	 RDP. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is used by the Windows Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance 
utilities to connect to and control a remote computer.
Internet Explorer and FTP
To use FTP in Internet Explorer, enter the address of an FTP site in the address box, for example,  
ftp.cengage.com. A logon dialog box appears where you can enter a user name and password 
(see Figure 14-19). When you click Log on, you can see folders on the FTP site and the FTP protocol 
displays in the address bar, as in ftp://ftp.cengage.com. It’s easier to use File Explorer or Windows 
Explorer to transfer files rather than Internet Explorer.
Applying  Concepts
Figure 14-19  Log on to an FTP site
After you have located the FTP site, to use Explorer for file transfers, press Alt, which causes the menu bar to 
appear. In the menu bar, click View, Open FTP site in File Explorer (see Figure 14-20). Explorer opens, showing 
files and folders on the FTP site. You can copy and paste files and folders from your computer to the site.

NetBIOS is a legacy suite of protocols used by Windows before TCP/IP. 
To support legacy NetBIOS applications on a TCP/IP network, TCP offers 
NetBIOS over TCP/IP. Earlier versions of SMB required NetBIOS over TCP/IP be 
enabled. Ports used on these networks are:
 SMB over UDP uses ports 137 and 138.
 SMB over TCP uses ports 137 and 139.
Current versions of SMB don’t require NetBIOS over TCP.

The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know how to connect to a wired, wireless, cellular, dial-up, or 
VPN network.
Now that you have an understanding of TCP/IP and Windows networking, let’s apply that knowledge to 
making network connections.
Connecting a Computer to a Network
Connecting a computer to a network is quick and easy in most situations. In the chapter, 
“Survey of Windows Features and Support Tools,” you learned to connect to a wired 
and wireless network. We begin with a summary of that information and then you learn 
to connect to a WWAN (cellular network), how to make a dial-up connection, and how 
to connect to a VPN.

2. Do one of the following to connect to the network:
	 For a wired network, plug in the network cable to the Ethernet port. The port is also called an  
RJ-45 port (RJ stands for registered jack) and looks like a large phone jack. Indicator lights near 
the network port should light up to indicate connectivity and activity. For Ethernet, Windows should 
automatically configure the connection.
	 For a wireless network, in Windows 8, you can use the charms bar or the Network icon in the 
taskbar on the Windows 8/7 desktop. On the desktop, click the Network icon in the taskbar and 
select a wireless network. Click Connect. If the network is secured, you must enter the security 
key to the wireless network to connect.
3. Open your browser and make sure you can access the web. For wireless connections, some hotspots 
provide a home page where you must enter a code or agree to the terms of use before you can use 
the network. On a private network, open File Explorer or Windows Explorer and drill down into the 
Network group to verify network resources are available (see Figure 14-21).

If you have a problem making a network connection, you can reset the connection. Open the Network 
Connections window and right-click the network connection. Select Disable from the shortcut menu as 
shown in Figure 14-25. Right-click the connection again and select Enable. The connection is reset. Try 
again to browse the web or access resources on the network. If you still don’t have local or Internet access, 
it’s time to dig a little deeper into the source of the problem. More networking troubleshooting tools and 
solutions are covered in the chapter, “Supporting Network Hardware.”
Notes For Windows 8, a shortcut to open the Network Connections window is to press Win+X and click Network 
Connections.

Connecting To and Setting Up a Network
Connect to a Wireless WAN (Cellular) Network
To connect a computer using mobile broadband to a wireless wide area network (WWAN), 
also called a cellular network, such as those provided by Verizon or AT&T, you need the 
hardware and software to connect and, for some networks, a SIM card. A cellular network 
can support both voice and data and currently uses one of two technologies: GSM (Global 
System for Mobile Communications) or CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access). Most carriers in the 
United States use CDMA, but GSM is more popular globally. Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Voice over 
LTE (VoLTE) provide data and voice transmissions and are expected to ultimately replace both GSM and 
CDMA. Many carriers use a combination of GSM and LTE or CDMA and LTE.
Those cellular devices that use GSM or LTE require a SIM (Subscriber Identification Module) card 
be installed in the device, which contains the information that identifies your device to the carrier 
(see Figure 14-26).

	 Use a USB broadband modem. 
For any computer, you can 
use a USB broadband modem 
(sometimes called an air card), 
such as the one shown in 
Figure 14-28. The device requires 
a contract with a cellular carrier.
When you purchase any of 
these devices from a carrier or 
manufacturer, most likely detailed 
instructions are included for 
connecting to the cellular network. 
Follow those instructions rather 
than the generic ones presented 
here. Generally, here’s how you can 
connect to a cellular network:
	 Use an embedded broadband 
modem. For laptops or other 
mobile devices that have an 
embedded modem, if a SIM card 
is required, insert the card in the 
device. For some laptops, the 
card slot might be in the battery 
bay, and you must remove the 
battery to find the slot. Then use 
Here are your options for software and hardware devices that can connect to a cellular network:
	 Use an embedded mobile broadband modem. A laptop or other mobile device might have an embedded 
broadband modem. In this situation, you still need to subscribe to a carrier.
	 Tether your cell phone to your computer. You can tether your cell phone to your computer. The cell 
phone connects to the cellular network and provides communication to your computer. The phone and 
computer can connect by way of a USB cable (see Figure 14-27), a proprietary cable provided by your 
cell phone manufacturer, or a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi wireless connection. Your contract with the carrier 
must allow tethering.

a program installed on the device to connect to the cellular network. In addition, the mobile operator 
might provide software for you to use.
	 Tether your cell phone. To tether your cell phone to your computer, your carrier is likely to provide you 
software to make the connection. If software is provided, install the software first and then tether your 
cell phone to your computer. Use the software to make the connection.
	 Use a USB broadband modem. When using a USB broadband modem, if needed, insert the SIM card in 
the modem (see Figure 14-29). When you insert the modem into a USB port, Windows finds the device, 
and the software stored on the device automatically installs and runs. A window then appears provided 
by the software that allows you to connect to the cellular network.

the modem. Figure 14-30 shows the software provided 
by one modem. Notice you can connect to the mobile 
network or the Wi-Fi network, but not both at the 
same time.

1. Install an internal or external dial-up modem. Make sure Device Manager recognizes 
the card without errors.
2. Plug the phone line into the modem port on your computer and into the wall jack.
3. Open the Network and Sharing Center window. In the Network and Sharing Center window 
(refer back to Figure 14-22), click Set up a new connection or network. In the dialog box that appears 
(see Figure 14-31), select Connect to the Internet - Set up a broadband or dial-up connection to the 
Internet and click Next.
Figure 14-31  Create a dial-up connection to an ISP
4. In the next box, click Dial-up. In the next box (see Figure 14-32), enter the phone number to your ISP, 
your ISP user name and password, and the name you decide to give the dial-up connection, such as the 
name and city of your ISP. Then click Create.

If the dial-up connection won’t work, here are some things you can try:
	 Is the phone line working? Plug in a regular phone and check for a dial tone. Is the phone cord securely 
connected to the computer and the wall jack?
	 Does the modem work? Check Device Manager for reported errors about the modem. Does the modem 
work when making a call to another phone number (not your ISP)?
	 Check the Dial-up Connection Properties box for errors. To do so, click Change adapter settings in the 
Network and Sharing Center, and then right-click the dial-up connection and select Properties from 
the shortcut menu. Is the phone number correct? Does the number need to include a 9 to get an outside 
line? Has a 1 been added in front of the number by mistake? If you need to add a 9, you can put a 
comma in the field like this “9,4045661200”, which causes a slight pause after the 9 is dialed.
	 Try dialing the number manually from a phone. Do you hear beeps on the other end? Try another 
phone number.
	 When you try to connect, do you hear the number being dialed? If so, the problem is most likely with 
the phone number, the phone line, or the user name and password.
	 Try removing and reinstalling the dial-up connection.
Create a VPN Connection
A virtual private network (VPN) is often used by employees when they telecommute to 
connect to the corporate network by way of the Internet. A VPN protects data by encrypting it 
from the time it leaves the remote computer until it reaches a server on the corporate network. 
The encryption technique is called a tunnel or tunneling (see Figure 14-34).
A+  
220-902 
1.6
A VPN can be managed by operating systems, routers, or third-party software such as OpenVPN 
(openvpn.net). A VPN connection is a virtual connection, which means you are really setting up the tunnel 
over an existing connection to the Internet. When creating a VPN connection on a personal computer, 
always follow directions given by the network administrator who set up the VPN. The company website 
might provide VPN client software to download and install on your computer.
Here are the general steps to use Windows to connect to a VPN:
1. In the Network and Sharing Center (refer back to Figure 14-22), click Set up a new connection or 
network. Then select Connect to a workplace - Set up a dial-up or VPN connection to your workplace 
(refer back to Figure 14-31) and click Next.

After the connection is made, you can use your browser to access the corporate secured intranet websites 
or other resources. The resources you can access depend on the permissions assigned the user account.
Problems connecting to a VPN can be caused by the wrong authentication protocols used when passing the 
user name and password to the VPN. To configure these settings, in the Network and Sharing Center, click 
Change adapter settings. In the Network Connections window, right-click VPN Connection and click Properties. 
In the Properties box, select the Security tab (see Figure 14-37). Here you can select the authentication 
protocols given to you by the network administrator.

Now let’s turn our attention to how to configure TCP/IP settings for a network connection, including 
dynamic, static, and alternate address configurations.
Figure 14-37  Select the VPN’s authentication protocol
Dynamic and Static IP Configurations
By default, Windows assumes dynamic IP addressing and automatically configures the network 
connection. However, some networks use static IP addresses.
To configure dynamic and static IP addresses, follow these steps:
1. Open the Network Connections window. Right-click the network connection and click Properties. In  
the Properties box, click the Networking tab, which is the middle box shown in Figure 14-38 for the 
Local Area Connection (Ethernet). Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and click Properties. 
The TCP/IPv4 Properties box appears (see the right side of Figure 14-38).

2. By default, dynamic IP addressing is used, which selects Obtain an IP address automatically and Obtain 
DNS server address automatically. To change the settings to static IP addressing, select Use the following 
IP address. Then enter the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. (A default gateway is the 
gateway a computer uses to access another network if it does not have a better option.)
3. If you have been given the IP addresses of DNS servers, select Use the following DNS server addresses 
and enter up to two IP addresses. If you have other DNS IP addresses, click Advanced and enter them 
on the DNS tab of the Advanced TCP/IP Settings box.
Alternate IP Address Configuration
Suppose an employee with a laptop often travels, and her work network uses static IP 
addressing, and, as you know, most public networks use dynamic IP addressing. How do you 
configure her computer’s TCP/IP settings? For travel, you would configure the computer to use 
dynamic IP addressing for public networks. However, when the computer attempts to connect 
to the corporate network, the computer won’t be able to find a DHCP server to get an IP address, subnet 
mask, default gateway, and DNS server 
addresses, and it will default to an 
Automatic Private IP Address (APIPA) 
and won’t have the information it needs 
to connect to the network or Internet. 
The solution is to create an alternate 
configuration that the computer will use 
if it cannot find a DHCP server.
To create an alternate configuration, 
on the TCP/IPv4 Properties box shown 
in Figure 14-38, click the Alternate 
Configuration tab. By default, the 
alternate configuration is Automatic 
private IP address. See Figure 14-39. 
Select User configured. Then enter a 
static IP address, subnet mask, default 
gateway, and DNS server addresses for 
the alternate configuration to be used 
on the company network. Click OK and 
close all boxes.

Figure 14-39  Create an alternate static IP address configuration
Notes Notice in Figure 14-38 that you can select Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) and click Properties to 
change IPv6 properties, including static and dynamic address configuration.
You can also uncheck Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) to disable it. For most situations, you need to leave it 
enabled. A bug in Windows 7 might prevent you from joining a homegroup if IPv6 is disabled.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know the features of a network adapter, including its speeds, 
half duplex, full duplex, Wake-on-LAN, QoS, and about UEFI/BIOS settings for onboard NICs.
Manage Network Adapters
A computer makes a direct connection to a local wired network by way of a network 
adapter, which might be a network port embedded on the motherboard or a network 
interface card (NIC) designed for installation in an expansion slot on the motherboard 
(refer back to Figure 14-3). In addition, the adapter might also be an external device 
plugged into a USB port (see Figure 14-40). The wired network adapter provides a network port. 
A network adapter is often called a NIC, even when it’s not really a card but a USB device or a 
network port embedded on the motherboard, which can be called an onboard NIC.
A+  
220-902 
1.6
Figure 14-40  USB device provides an Ethernet port
Here are the features you need to be aware of that might be included with a network adapter:
	 The drivers a NIC uses. A NIC usually comes bundled with drivers on CD and can be downloaded from 
the web. Windows has several embedded NIC drivers. After you install a NIC, you can install its drivers. 
Problems with the network adapter can sometimes be solved by using Device Manager to update the drivers 
or uninstall the drivers and then reinstall them.
	 Ethernet speeds. For wired networks, the four speeds for Ethernet are 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps (Fast Ethernet; 
technical name is 100BaseT), 1 Gbps (Gigabit Ethernet or 1000BaseT), and 10 Gbps (10-gigabit Ethernet 
or 10GBaseT). Most network adapters sold today for local networks use Gigabit Ethernet and also support 
the two slower speeds. To see the speeds supported, open the Ethernet network adapter’s Properties box 
in Device Manager. Select the Advanced tab. In the list of properties, select Speed & Duplex. You can 
then see available speeds in the Value dropdown list (see the right side of Figure 14-41). If the adapter 
connects with slower network devices on the network, the adapter works at the slower speed. Notice in the 
dropdown list choices for half duplex or full duplex. Full duplex sends and receives transmissions at the 
same time. Half duplex works in only one direction at a time. Select Auto Negotiation for Windows to use 
the best possible speed and duplex.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know how to configure an alternate IP address, including 
setting the static IP address, subnet mask, DNS addresses, and gateway address.

	 MAC address. Every network adapter (wired or wireless) has a 48-bit (6-byte) identification number, 
called the MAC address or physical address, hard-coded on the card by its manufacturer that is unique 
for that adapter, and this number is used to identify the adapter on the network. An example of a MAC 
address is 00-0C-6E-4E-AB-A5. Most likely, the MAC address is printed on the device. You can also 
have Windows tell you the MAC address by entering the ipconfig /all command in a command prompt 
window (see Figure 14-42).

Figure 14-42  Use the ipconfig /all command to show the MAC address of a network adapter
Notes The speed of a network depends on the speed of each device on the network and how well a router manages 
that traffic. Routers, switches, and network adapters currently run at three speeds: Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbps or 1 Gbps), 
Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps), or Ethernet (10 Mbps). If you want your entire network to run at the fastest speed, make sure 
all your devices are rated for Gigabit Ethernet.

	 Status indicator lights. A wired network adapter might provide indicator lights on the side of the RJ-45 
port that indicate connectivity and activity (see Figure 14-43). When you first discover you have a prob-
lem with a computer not connecting to a network, be sure to check the status indicator lights to verify 
you have connectivity and activity. If not, then the problem is related to hardware. Next, check the cable 
connections to make sure they are solid.

	 Wake-on-LAN. A network adapter 
might support Wake-on-LAN, 
which allows the adapter to wake up 
the computer when it receives certain 
communication on the network. To use 
the feature, it must be enabled on the 
network adapter. To do that, open the 
network adapter’s Properties box in 
Device Manager and click the Advanced 
tab. Make sure Wake on Magic Packet 
and Wake on pattern match are both 
enabled (see Figure 14-44a).
For an onboard NIC, you must also enable Wake-on-LAN in UEFI/BIOS setup. Reboot the computer 
and enter UEFI/BIOS setup and look for the option on a power-management screen in UEFI/BIOS setup. 
Figure 14-45 shows the BIOS screen for one onboard NIC. It is not recommended that you enable  
Wake-on-LAN for a wireless network adapter.
Notes Some network adapters provide a 
Power Management tab in the Properties box. 
To use the Power Management tab to enable 
Wake-on-LAN, check Allow this device to 
wake the computer (see Figure 14-44b).

ture must be enabled and configured 
on the router and also enabled on the 
network adapters and configured in 
Windows for every computer on the 
network using the high-priority appli-
cations. To enable Quality of Service 
(QoS) for a NIC, open the network 
adapter Properties box in Device 
Manager. On the Advanced tab, make 
sure Priority Enabled  is selected, as 
shown in Figure 14-46. (If the option 
is not listed, the adapter does not sup-
port QoS.) Later in this chapter, you 
learn how to configure a router to use 
QoS. To configure an application to 
use QoS, you can use Group Policy in 
professional and business editions of 
Windows. How to use Group Policy 
is covered in the chapter, “Windows 
Resources on a Network.”

Setting Up a Multifunction Router for a SOHO Network
An IT support technician is likely to be called on to set up a small office or home office (SOHO) 
network. As part of setting up a small network, you need to know how to configure a multipurpose 
router to stand between the network and the Internet. You also need to know how to set up and 
secure a wireless access point. Most SOHO routers are also a wireless access point.

Functions of a SOHO Router
Routers can range from small ones designed to manage a SOHO network connecting to an 
ISP (costing around $75 to $200) to those that manage multiple networks and extensive traffic 
(costing several thousand dollars). On a small office or home network, a router stands between 
the ISP network and the local network (see Figure 14-47), and the router is the gateway to the 
Internet. Note in the figure that computers can connect to the router using wired or wireless 
connections.

Figure 14-47  A router stands between a local network and the ISP network and manages 
traffic between them
A typical SOHO router is usually several devices in one:
	 Function 1: As a router, it stands between two networks, the ISP network and the local network, 
and routes traffic between the two networks.
	 Function 2: As a switch, it manages several network ports that can be connected to wired computers 
or to a switch that provides more ports for more computers.
	 Function 3: As a DHCP server, it can provide IP addresses to networked computers.
	 Function 4: As a wireless access point (WAP), it enables a wireless computer to connect to the network. 
This wireless connection can be secured using wireless security features.
	 Function 5: As a firewall, it blocks unwanted traffic initiated from the Internet and can restrict Internet 
access for local computers behind the firewall. Restrictions on local computers can apply to days of 
the week, time of day, keywords used, or certain websites. It can limit network and Internet access to 
only specified computers, based on their MAC addresses. It also provides Network Address Translation

(NAT) so that computers on the LAN can 
use private or link-local IP addresses.
	 Function 6: As an FTP server, you can 
connect an external hard drive to the router, 
and the FTP firmware on the router can be 
used to share files with network users.
An example of a multifunction router 
is the Nighthawk AC1900 by NETGEAR 
shown in Figures 14-48 and 14-49. It has 
one Internet port for the broadband modem 
(cable modem or DSL modem) and four 
ports for computers on the network. The USB 
port can be used to plug in a USB external 
hard drive for use by any computer on the 
network. The router is also a wireless access 
point having multiple antennas to increase 
speed and range.

Install and Configure a Router on the Local Network
When deciding where to physically place a router, consider the physical security of the router 
and, as a wireless access point, make sure the router is centrally located to create the best 
Wi-Fi hotspot for users. For physical security, don’t place the router in a public location in 
a small business, such as the lobby. For best security, place the router behind a locked door 
accessible only to authorized personnel in a location with access to network cabling. The 
indoor range for a Wi-Fi hotspot is up to 70 meters; the range is affected by many factors, 
including interference from walls, furniture, electrical equipment, and other nearby hotspots. 
For the best Wi-Fi strength, position your router or a stand-alone wireless access point in the 
center of where you want your hotspot and know that a higher position (near the ceiling) works better 
than a lower position (on the floor).

For routers that have external antennas, raise the antennas to vertical positions. Plug in the router and 
connect network cables to the local network. Connect the network cable from the ISP modem or other 
device to the uplink port on the router.
To configure a router for the first time or change its configuration, always follow the directions of the 
manufacturer rather than the general directions given here. You can use any computer on the network 
that uses a wired connection (it doesn’t matter which one) to configure the firmware on the router. You’ll 
need the IP address of the router and the default user name and password to the router setup. To find this 
information, look in the router documentation or search online for your model and brand of router.
Here are the general steps for one router, the Nighthawk AC1900 by NETGEAR, although the setup 
screens for your router may be different:
1. Open your browser and enter the IP address of the router in the address box. In our example, the 
address is 192.168.1.1. The Windows Security box appears (see Figure 14-50). For our router, the 
default user name and password is admin, although yours might be different.
Notes Some wireless access points are plenum rated, meaning that, according to fire codes, they can be installed in the 
plenum area between floors in a building or above a suspended ceiling. For these types of installation, network technicians 
are careful to follow local fire codes and must take into account how the device might affect airflow in the plenum.

2. The main setup page of the router firmware appears in your browser window. Figure 14-51 shows the 
main page for a router that has already been configured. Notice the BASIC tab is selected. Most of 
the settings you’ll need are on the ADVANCED tab. Begin by poking around to see what’s available 
and to find the setting you need. If you make changes, be sure to save your changes. When finished, 
click Logout and close the browser window.

Following are some changes that you might need to make to the router’s configuration. The first setting 
should always be done.
Change the Router Password
It’s extremely important to protect access to your network and prevent others from hijacking your router. 
If you have not already done so, change the default password to your router firmware. For our router, click 
the ADVANCED tab, click Administration, and click Set Password (see Figure 14-52). Change the password 
and click Apply. If the firmware offers the option, disable the ability to configure the router from over the

wireless network. Know that this password to configure the router firmware is different from the password 
needed to access the router’s wireless network.

Configure the DHCP Server
To configure the DHCP server for our sample router, click the ADVANCED tab and then LAN Setup in the Setup 
group (see Figure 14-53). On this page, you can enable or disable the DHCP server and set the IP address of the 
router and subnet mask for the network. For the DHCP server, set the starting and ending IP addresses, which 
determines the number of IP addresses DHCP can serve up. Be sure the router and all the IP addresses are on the 
same subnet, according to the subnet mask. After making changes on this page, click Apply to save your changes.

Caution
Changing the router password is especially important if the router is a wireless router. Unless you have 
disabled or secured the wireless access point, anyone outside your building can use your wireless network. If they guess 
the default password to the router, they can change the password to hijack your router. Also, your wireless network can 
be used for criminal activity. When you first install a router, before you do anything else, change your router password 
and disable the wireless network until you have time to set up and test the wireless security. And, to give even more 
security, change the default user name to another user name if the router utility allows that option.

Assign Static IP Addresses
A computer or network printer might require a static IP address, which is called address reservation. For 
example, when a computer is running a web server on the local network, it needs a static IP address so that 
other computers on the network that need access to this intranet website can find the web server. A network 
printer also needs a static IP address so computers will always be able to find the printer. Do the following:
1. To identify the computer or printer, you’ll need its MAC address. When the client is connected to the 
network, on the ADVANCED tab, click Attached Devices in the Administration group (see Figure 14-54). 
Copy the MAC address (select it and press CTRL+C) or write it down.
Figure 14-54  View the MAC addresses of devices connected to the network
Source: NETGEAR
2. To assign a static IP address to the client, on the LAN Setup page shown in Figure 14-53, click Add 
under Address Reservation. In the IP address field, enter the IP address to assign to the computer or 
printer. Be sure to use an IP address in the LAN’s subnet, such as 192.168.1.200 in our example. Select 
the MAC address from the list of attached devices or copy or type the MAC address in the field. Click 
Apply to save your changes. In Figure 14-55, a Canon network printer is set to receive the IP address 
192.168.1.200 each time it connects to the network.

Connecting To and Setting Up a Network
Notes If you are running a web server on the Internet, you will need a public IP address for your router and a static 
private IP address for the web server. For this situation, you can lease a public IP address from your ISP at an additional 
cost. You will also need to enable port forwarding to the server, which is discussed later in this chapter.
MAC Address Filtering
MAC address filtering allows you to control access to your network to only certain computers or devices. 
If a MAC address is not entered in a table of MAC addresses, the computer is not allowed to connect to 
the network. For our sample router, the MAC address table can be viewed and edited on the ADVANCED 
tab on the Access Control page in the Security group (see Figure 14-56). To turn on Access Control, check 
the box Turn on Access Control and then allow or block each MAC address in the table.

Improve QoS for an Application
As you use your network and notice that one application is not getting the best service, you can improve 
network performance for this application using the Quality of Service (QoS) feature discussed earlier 
in this chapter. For example, suppose you routinely use Skype to share your desktop with collaborators 
over the Internet. To assign a high priority to Skype for our sample router, do the following:
1. On the ADVANCED tab, select the QoS Setup page in the Setup group. This router configures both 
upstream QoS and downstream QoS. For Skype, click the Upstream QoS tab and then click Setup 
QoS rule.
2. Select Skype and click Apply (see Figure 14-57). If your application is not listed, scroll to the bottom 
of the list and click Add Priority Rule. On the page that appears, you can name the application and 
the port(s) it uses.

Universal Plug and Play
Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) helps computers on the local network automatically discover and 
communicate with services provided by other computers on the local network. Enable UPnP if computers 
on the network use applications, such as messaging, gaming, or Windows Remote Assistance, which run on 
other local computers and there is a problem establishing communication. Basically, a computer can use the 
router to advertise its service and automatically communicate with other computers on the network. UPnP 
is considered a security risk because shields between computers are dropped, which hackers might exploit. 
Therefore, use UPnP with caution.
For our sample router, UPnP is enabled on the UPnP page in the Advanced Setup group on the ADVANCED 
tab (see Figure 14-58). Any computers and their ports that are currently using UPnP are listed.

Update Router Firmware
As part of maintaining a router, know the router manufacturers often release updates to the router firmware. 
The router setup utility can be used to download and apply these updates. For our sample router, when 
you click A router firmware update is available on any of the setup screens (for example, see Figure 14-58), 
the Firmware Upgrade Assistant page appears (see Figure 14-59). Use this page to perform the upgrade.

Limit Internet Traffic on Your Network
A router’s firewall examines each message coming from the Internet and decides if the message 
is allowed onto the local network. Recall that a message is directed to a particular IP address 
(identifying a computer or other device’s connection to the network) and a port (identifying 
the application running on the computer). Routers offer the option to disable (close) all 
ports, which means that no activity initiated from the Internet can get in. For some routers, 
you must explicitly disable all ports. For the NETGEAR router in our example, all ports 
are disabled (closed) by default. You must specify exceptions to this firewall rule in order to 
allow unsolicited traffic from the Internet. Exceptions are allowed using port forwarding, port 
triggering, or a DMZ. In addition to managing ports, you can also limit Internet traffic by filtering content. 
All these techniques are discussed next.

Port Forwarding
Suppose you’re hosting an Internet game or website or want to use Remote Desktop to access your 
home computer from the Internet. In these situations, you need to enable (open) certain ports to certain 
computers so that activity initiated from the Internet can get past your firewall. This technique, called port 
forwarding or port mapping, means that when the firewall receives a request for communication from the 
Internet to the specific computer and port, the request will be allowed and forwarded to that computer on 
the network. The computer is defined to the router by its static IP address. For example, in Figure 14-60a, 
port 80 is open and requests to port 80 are forwarded to the web server that is listening at that port. This 
one computer on the network is the only one allowed to receive requests at port 80.

Service Name and enter the static IP address of the computer providing the service in the Server IP Address 
field and click Add. Notice in the figure that the Remote Desktop application outside the network can use 
port forwarding to communicate with the computer whose IP address is 192.168.1.90 using port 3389. 
The situation is illustrated in Figure 14-62. This computer is set to support the Remote Desktop server 
application. You will learn to use Remote Desktop in the chapter, “Windows Resources on a Network.”

Connecting To and Setting Up a Network
Also notice the IP address for the message in Figure 14-62 is directed to the router’s public IP address. 
The router is using NAT and computers on the local network are using private IP addresses. With port 
forwarding, the router forwards all traffic to port 3389 to the one computer with this open port even 
though traffic is directed to the router’s public IP address. For this reason, port forwarding is sometimes 
called Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT).

Notes By the way, if you want to use a domain name rather than an IP address to access a computer on your network 
from the Internet, you’ll need to purchase the domain name and register it in the Internet name space to associate it 
with your static IP address assigned by your ISP. Several websites on the Internet let you do both; one site is by Network 
Solutions at networksolutions.com.

Port Triggering
Port triggering opens a port when a computer on the network initiates communication through another 
port, and is often used with Internet gaming. For example, in Figure 14-60b, Computer C sends a message 
to port 50 to a computer on the Internet. The router is configured to open port 80 for communication 
from this remote computer. Port 80 is closed until this trigger occurs. Port triggering does not require a 
static IP address for the computer inside the network, and any computer can initiate port triggering. The 
router will leave port 80 open for a time. If no more data is received from port 50, then it closes port 80.
To configure port triggering on our sample router, select Port Triggering on the page shown in Figure 14-61. 
Click Add Service. In the Port Triggering page that appears (see Figure 14-63), type a descriptive name for the 
service. For Service User, selecting Any allows any computer to use the service or you can enter a specific IP 
address of a remote computer. Select the Service Type (TCP, UDP, or both) and enter the triggering port (the 
outbound traffic port that will open the inbound ports). Under Inbound Connection, select the Connection 
Type (TCP, UDP, or both) and the range of ports that will be open for inbound traffic. This information about 
types of service and ports should be available from the documentation for the application you are using.

Source: NETGEAR
Here are some tips to keep in mind when using port forwarding or port triggering:
	 You must lease a static IP address for your router from your ISP so that people on the Internet can 
find you. Most ISPs will provide you a static IP address for an additional monthly fee.
	 For port forwarding to work, the computer on your network must have a static IP address so that the 
router knows where to send the communication.
	 If the computer using port triggering stops sending data, the router might close the triggered port before 
communication is complete. Also, if two computers on the network attempt to trigger the same port, 
the router will not allow data to pass to either computer.
	 Using port forwarding, your computer and network are more vulnerable because you are allowing 
external users directly into your private network. For better security, turn on port forwarding only 
when you know it’s being used.
DMZ
A DMZ (demilitarized zone) in networking is a computer or network that is not protected by a firewall or 
has limited protection. You can drop all your shields protecting a computer by putting it in a DMZ and 
the firewall no longer protects it. If you are having problems getting port forwarding or port triggering

to work, putting a computer in a DMZ can free it to receive any communication from the Internet. All 
unsolicited traffic from the Internet that the router would normally drop is forwarded to the computer 
designated as the DMZ server.
To set up a DMZ server for our sample router, on the ADVANCED tab, select WAN Setup in the Setup 
group (see Figure 14-64). Check Default DMZ Server and enter the static IP address of the computer.

Content Filtering and Parental Controls
Routers normally provide a way for employers or parents to limit the content that computers on the local 
network can access on the Internet. Filtering can apply to specific computers, users, websites, categories 
of websites, keywords, services, time of day, and day of week. Filters can apply to black lists (lists what 
cannot be accessed) or white lists (lists what can be accessed).
For our sample router, content filtering and parental controls are managed in the Security group on the 
ADVANCED tab. Here are the options:
	 The Parental Controls page provides access to the Live Parental Controls application and website at 
www.netgear.com/lpc where parents can manage content allowed from the Internet and monitor websites 
and content accessed.
	 The Block Sites page (see Figure 14-65) allows you to enter keywords or websites to block. Notice 
you can also specify a trusted IP address of a computer on the network that is allowed access to this 
content.
Caution
If a DMZ computer is compromised, it can be used to attack other computers on the network. Use it only 
as a last resort when you cannot get port forwarding or port triggering to work. It goes without saying to not leave the 
DMZ enabled unless you are using it.

Set up a Wireless Network
A wireless network is created by a wireless access point (WAP). The standards for a local 
wireless network are called Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity), and their technical name is IEEE 802.11. 
The IEEE 802.11 standards, collectively known as the 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac standards, have 
evolved over the years and are summarized in Table 14-5.

	 The Block Services page can block services on the Internet. For example, you can block Internet 
gaming services or email services or allow the service based on a schedule. You will need to know 
the ports these services use. You can also specify the IP addresses of computers to which the 
block applies.
	 The Schedule page allows you to specify the schedule of time and day a blocked service can be used.
	 The E-mail page gives you the option for the router to email to you a log of router activities.
Now let’s turn our attention to configuring a wireless access point provided by a router.

Connecting To and Setting Up a Network
Wireless computers and other devices on the wireless LAN (WLAN) must support the latest wireless 
standard for it to be used. If not, the connection uses the latest standard both the WAP and client support. 
Figure 14-66 shows a wireless adapter that has two antennas and supports the 802.11n standard. Most 
new adapters, wireless computers, and mobile devices support 802.11ac and are backward compatible 
with older standards.
Figure 14-66  Wireless network adapter with two antennas supports 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi standards
Now let’s look at the various features and settings of a wireless access point and how to configure them.
Wi-Fi Standard
Speeds, Distances, and Frequencies
IEEE 802.11a
	Speeds up to 54 Mbps (megabits per second).
	Short range up to 50 meters with radio frequency of 5.0 GHz.
	802.11a is no longer used.
IEEE 802.11b
	Up to 11 Mbps with a range of up to 100 meters. (Indoor ranges are less than outdoor ranges.)
	The radio frequency of 2.4 GHz experiences interference from cordless phones and microwaves.
IEEE 802.11g
	Same as 802.11b, but with a speed up to 54 Mbps.
IEEE 802.11n
	Up to 600 Mbps depending on the configuration.
	Indoor range up to 70 meters and outdoor range up to 250 meters.
	Can use either 5.0-GHz or 2.4-GHz radio frequency.
	Uses multiple input/multiple output (MIMO), which means a WAP can have up to four antennas 
to improve performance.
IEEE 802.11ac
	Standard supports up to 7 Gbps, although current actual speeds are about 1300 Mbps.
	Same ranges as 802.11n except performance does not weaken at long range as does 802.11n.
	Uses the 5.0-GHz radio frequency.
	Supports up to eight antennas.
	Supports beamforming, which detects the locations of connected devices and increases signal 
strength in that direction.

Security Key
The most common and effective method of securing a wireless network is to require a security key before 
a client can connect to the network. By default, a network that uses a security key encrypts data on the 
network. Use the router firmware to set the security key. For best security, enter a security key that is 
different from the password you use to the router utility.
For our sample router, the security key can be set on the ADVANCED tab, Wireless Setup page in the Setup 
group (see Figure 14-67) and is called the Password or Network Key. Click Apply to save your changes.
Figure 14-67  Configure the router’s wireless access point

Notes To make the strongest passphrase or security key, use a random group of numbers, uppercase and lowercase 
letters, and, if allowed, at least one symbol. Also use at least eight characters in the passphrase.
Notes When configuring your wireless access point, it’s important you are connected to the router by way of a wired 
connection. If you change a wireless setting and you are connected wirelessly, your wireless connection will immediately 
be dropped and you cannot continue configuring the router until you connect again.

Connecting To and Setting Up a Network
Set Encryption
When you set a security key, routers by default encrypt wireless transmissions, and you can change the 
encryption protocols used or disable encryption. (Encrypting transmissions slows down the network; 
disabling encryption can improve performance and might be appropriate when you are not concerned about 
transmissions being hacked.) The three main protocols for encryption for 802.11 wireless networks are:
	 WEP. WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is no longer considered secure because the key used for 
encryption is static (it doesn’t change).
	 WPA. WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access), also called TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) encryption, 
is stronger than WEP and was designed to replace it. With WPA encryption, encryption keys are 
constantly changing.
	 WPA2. WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2), also called the 802.11i standard, is the latest and best wireless 
encryption standard. It is based on the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which improved on the 
way TKIP generated encryption keys. All wireless devices sold today support the WPA2 standard.
To configure encryption for our sample router, first, notice in Figure 14-67 that this router supports 
two wireless frequencies: 2.4 GHz used by 802.11 b/g/n standards and 5 GHz used by 802.11 a/n/ac. 
The security key applies to either band, but each band can have its own encryption type. For the best 
security, set both bands to WPA-PSK [TKIP] + WPA2-PSK [AES] encryption. This setting means a wireless 
connection will use WPA2 encryption unless an older device does not support it, in which case the 
connection reverts to WPA encryption. Click Apply to save your changes.
Change the Default SSID and Disable SSID Broadcasting
The Service Set Identifier (SSID) is the name of a wireless network. When you look at Figure 14-67, you 
can see that each frequency band has its own SSID and you can change that name. Each band is its own 
wireless network, which the access point (router) connects to the local wired network. When you give each 
band its own SSID and connect a wireless computer to your network, you can select the band by selecting 
the appropriate SSID. If your computer supports 802.11ac, you would want to select the SSID for the 
5-GHz band in order to get the faster speeds of the 802.11ac standard. If you selected the SSID for the  
2.4-GHz band, the connection would revert to the slower 802.11n standard.
Also notice in Figure 14-67 the option to Enable SSID Broadcast. When you disable SSID broadcasting, 
the wireless network will appear as Unnamed or Unknown Network. When a client selects this network, 
you are given the opportunity to enter the SSID. If you don’t enter the name correctly, you will not be able 
to connect. This security method is not considered strong security because software can be used to discover 
an SSID that is not broadcasted.
Select Channels for the WLAN
A channel is a specific radio frequency within a broader frequency. For example, two channels in the 
5-GHz band are 5.180-GHz and 5.200-GHz channels. In the United States, eleven channels are available 
for wireless communication in the 5-GHz or 2.4-GHz bands. In North America, the 5-GHz band uses 
channels 36, 40, 44, and 48, and the 2.4-GHz band uses channels 1 through 14 (preferred nonoverlapping 
channels are 1, 6, and 11). For most networks, you can allow auto channel selection so that any channel in 
the frequency range (5-GHz or 2.4-GHz) will work. The device scans for the least-busy channel. However, 
if you are trying to solve a problem with interference from a nearby wireless network, you can set each 
network to a different channel and make the channels far apart to reduce interference. For example, for the 
2.4-GHz band, set the network on one WAP to channel 1 and set the other WAP’s network to channel 11.
Notes Notice in Figure 14-67 the option to select the mode a wireless network will use, which determines the speed 
of the wireless network. Recall the 802.11ac standard currently supports the speed of 1300 Mbps. If you select a slower 
mode for the 5-GHz band, such as 600 Mbps, in effect you are preventing the 802.11ac standard from being used on the 
network and connections will revert to the 802.11n standard that uses the 600-Mbps speed. For best results, use the 
fastest mode the band supports.

Radio Power Levels
Some high-end access points allow you to adjust the radio power levels the wireless network can use. 
To reduce interference, limit the range of the network, or to save on electricity, reduce the power level.
Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)
You also need to know about Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), which is designed to make it easier for users to 
connect their computers to a wireless network when a hard-to-remember SSID and security key are used. 
WPS generates the SSID and security key using a random string of hard-to-guess letters and numbers. The 
SSID is not broadcasted, so both the SSID and security key must be entered to connect. Rather than having 
to enter these difficult strings, a user presses a button on a wireless computer or on the router or enters 
an eight-digit PIN assigned to the router (see Figure 14-68). All computers on the wireless network must 
support WPS for it to be used, and you must enable WPS on the router, as shown in the figure.
Figure 14-68  Enable WPS and decide how the router’s PIN is used
Source: NETGEAR
WPS might be a security risk if it’s not managed well. To improve WPS security, turn on auto disable so 
that WPS will disable after a few failed PIN entries. If routers don’t have the auto disable feature, don’t use 
WPS because an eight-digit PIN is easy to hack with repeated attempts. In addition, if the router has a WPS 
button to push, don’t use WPS unless the router is in a secured physical location. For improved security, 
turn on WPS only when you are working with a user to connect to the wireless network and then turn it off.

Connecting To and Setting Up a Network
>> Chapter Summary
Understanding TCP/IP and Windows Networking
	Networking communication happens at three levels: hardware, operating system, and application levels.
	At the hardware level, a network adapter has a MAC address that uniquely identifies it on the network.
	Using the TCP/IP protocols, the OS identifies a network connection by an IP address. At the application 
level, a port address identifies an application.
	IP addresses can be dynamic or static. A dynamic IP address is assigned by a DHCP server when the 
computer first connects to a network. A static IP address is manually assigned.
	An IP address using IPv4 has 32 bits, and an IP address using IPv6 has 128 bits. Some IP addresses are 
private IP addresses that can be used only on intranets.
	Using IPv4, a subnet mask determines the number of left most bits in an IP address that identify the 
local network. The remaining right most bits identify the host.
	Using IPv6, three types of IP addresses are a unicast address (used by a single node on a network), 
multicast address (used for one-to-many transmissions), and anycast address (used by routers).
	Types of unicast addresses are a global address (used on the Internet), a link-local address (used on a 
private network), and a unique local address (used on subnets in a large enterprise).
	A computer can be assigned a computer name (also called a host name), and a network can be assigned 
a domain name. A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) includes the computer name and the domain 
name. An FQDN can be used to find a computer on the Internet if this name is associated with an IP 
address kept by DNS servers.
	TCP/IP uses protocols at the application level (such as FTP, HTTP, and Telnet) and at the operating 
system level (such as TCP and UDP).
Research a Wireless LAN
Suppose you have a DSL connection to the Internet in your home and you want to connect two laptops 
and a desktop computer in a wireless network to the Internet. You need to purchase a multifunction 
wireless router like the one you learned to configure in this chapter. You also need a wireless adapter 
for the desktop computer. (The two laptops have built-in wireless networking.) Use the web to research 
the equipment needed to create the wireless LAN and answer the following:

Key Terms
Connecting a Computer to a Network
	An IT support person needs to know how to configure TCP/IP settings and make a wired or wireless 
connection to an existing network.
	To connect to a wireless WAN or cellular network, you need a mobile broadband modem and a 
subscription to the cellular network. For some carriers, a SIM card is also required.
	A dial-up connection uses a telephone modem to make a connection to an ISP.
Setting Up a Multifunction Router for a SOHO Network
	A multifunction router for a small office/home office network might serve several functions, including 
a router, a switch, a DHCP server, a wireless access point, a firewall using NAT, and an FTP server.
	It’s extremely important to change the password to configure your router as soon as you install it, 
especially if the router is also a wireless access point.
	To allow certain network traffic initiated on the Internet past your firewall, you can use port 
forwarding, port triggering, and a DMZ.
	To secure a wireless access point, you can require a security key, disable SSID broadcasting, and enable 
encryption (WPA2, WPA, or WEP). As with wired networks, you can also enable MAC address filtering.

Real Problem 14-1 Setting Up a Small Network
The simplest possible wired network is two computers connected together using a crossover cable. In a 
crossover cable, the send and receive wires are crossed so that one computer can send and the other computer 
receive on the same wire. At first glance, a crossover cable looks just like a regular network cable (also called 
a patch cable) except for the labeling (see Figure 14-69). (In the chapter, “Supporting Network Hardware,” 
you learn how to distinguish between the cables by examining their connectors.)
Figure 14-69  A patch cable and crossover cable look the same but are labeled differently
Do the following to set up and test the network:
1.		Connect two computers using a crossover cable. Using the Network and Sharing Center, verify your 
network is up. What is the IPv4 address of Computer A? Of Computer B?
2.		Join the two computers to the same homegroup. Then use File Explorer or Windows Explorer to view 
the files on the other computer shared with the homegroup.
3.		Convert the TCP/IP configuration to static IP addressing. Assign a private IP address to each computer. 
Make sure the two computers are in the same subnet. What is the subnet mask? What is the IP address 
of Computer A? Of Computer B?
4.		Verify you can still see files shared with the homegroup on each computer.
5.	Assign a new IP address to each computer so they are not in the same subnet. What are the two IP 
addresses? Can you still see files shared with the homegroup on each computer?
6.	Return the computers to the same subnet and verify each computer can find the other and its shared 
resources.
Real Problem 14-2 Using the Hosts File
The hosts file in the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc folder has no file extension and contains computer 
names and their associated IP addresses on the local network. An IT support technician can manually edit 
the hosts file when the association is needed for address resolution on the local network and a DNS server 
is not available on the local network.
Notes For an entry in the hosts file to work, the remote computer must always use the same IP address. One way 
to accomplish this is to assign a static IP address to the computer. Alternately, if your DHCP server supports this feature, 
you can configure it to assign the same IP address to this computer each time it connects to the network.

Real Problems, Real Solutions
Using your small network you set up in Real Problem 14-1, do the following to use the hosts file:
1.	The ping command sends a request to a remote computer and the computer responds to verify 
communication. On Computer A, open a command prompt window and ping Computer B using its IP 
address. For example, if the IP address is 192.168.10.10, use this command: ping 192.168.10.10.
2.	Try to ping Computer B, this time using its computer name. Did the ping work?
3.	Use Notepad to edit the hosts file on Computer A and add the entry that associates the IP address of

Types of Networks and the Internet Connections They Use
A computer network is created when two or more computers can communicate with each 
other. Networks can be categorized by several methods, including the technology used and the 
size of the network. When networks are categorized by size or physical area they cover, these 
are the categories used:
	 PAN. A PAN (personal area network) consists of personal devices communicating at close range such 
as a cell phone and laptop computer. PANs can use wired connections (such as USB or FireWire) or 
wireless connections (such as Bluetooth or Infrared).
	 LAN. A LAN (local area network) covers a small local area, such as a home, office, other building, or 
small group of buildings. LANs can use wired (most likely Ethernet) or wireless (most likely Wi-Fi, also 
called 802.11) technologies. A LAN is used for workstations, servers, printers, and other devices to 
communicate and share resources.
	 Wireless LAN. A wireless LAN (WLAN) covers a limited geographical area, and is used in businesses, 
homes, restaurants, public parks, airports, schools, and many other places where network cabling is 
inconvenient to install or use.
	 MAN. A MAN (metropolitan area network) covers a large campus or city. (A small MAN is sometimes 
called a CAN or campus area network.) Network technologies used can be wireless (most likely LTE) 
and/or wired (for example, Ethernet with fiber-optic cabling).
	 WAN. A WAN (wide area network) covers a large geographical area and is made up of many smaller 
networks. The best-known WAN is the Internet. Some technologies used to connect a single computer 
or LAN to the Internet include DSL, cable Internet, satellite, cellular WAN, and fiber optic.

The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know about a LAN, WAN, PAN, and MAN.
Now let’s look at network technologies used for Internet connections.
Network Technologies Used for Internet Connections
To connect to the Internet, a network first connects to an Internet service provider (ISP), such 
as Earthlink or Comcast. The most common types of connections are DSL and cable Internet 
(commonly called cable or cable modem). See Figure 15-1. When connecting to an ISP, know 
that upload speeds are generally slower than download speeds. These rates differ because users 
generally download more data than they upload. Therefore, an ISP devotes more of the available bandwidth 
to downloading and less of it to uploading.

Networks are built using one or more technologies that provide varying degrees of bandwidth. Bandwidth 
(the width of the band) is the theoretical number of bits that can be transmitted over a network at one time, 
similar to the number of lanes on a highway. In practice, however, the networking industry refers to bandwidth 
as a measure of the maximum rate of data transmission in bits per second (bps), thousands of bits per second 
(Kbps), millions of bits per second (Mbps), or billions of bits per second (Gbps). Bandwidth is the theoretical 
or potential speed of a network, whereas data throughput is the average of the actual speed. In practice, 
network transmissions experience delays, called latency, that result in slower network performance. For 
example, too many splitters can cause signal strength degradation, resulting in latency. Latency is measured by 
the round-trip time it takes for a data packet to travel from source to destination and back to source.
Table 15-1 lists network technologies used by local networks to connect to the Internet. The table is 
more or less ordered from slowest to fastest maximum bandwidth within each category, although latency 
can affect the actual bandwidth of a particular network.
Technology  
(Wireless or Wired)
Maximum Speed
Common Uses
Wireless Internet connection: Cellular
2G cellular  
(second-generation cellular)
Up to 50 Kbps
Uses the mobile phone service on a cellular network for 
voice and data (digital) transmissions. Most 2G networks 
use an improved version of the GSM mobile phone service, 
although some use CDMA, which is a competing service.
2G EDGE or 2G E cellular
Up to 384 Kbps
Improved over 2G and uses the GSM mobile phone service. 
(EDGE stands for Enhanced Data for GSM Evolution.)
3G cellular  
(third-generation cellular)
At least 200 Kbps, 
but can be up to 4 
Mbps
Improved over 2G EDGE and allows for transmitting 
data and video. Uses either CDMA or GSM mobile phone 
services. Speeds vary widely according to the revision 
standards used.
4G cellular  
(fourth-generation cellular)
100 Mbps to 1 Gbps
Higher speeds are achieved when the client stays in a 
fixed position. A 4G network uses either LTE (Long Term 
Evolution) or WiMAX technology. LTE is more popular 
and faster.
Wireless Internet connection: Satellite
Satellite
Up to 15 Mbps
Requires a dish to send and receive from a satellite, which 
is in a relative fixed position with the Earth.
Wired Internet connection: Telephone
Dial-up or regular telephone 
(POTS, for plain old 
telephone service)
Up to 56 Kbps
Slow access to an ISP using a modem and dial-up 
connection over phone lines.
ISDN
64 Kbps or 128 Kbps
ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) is an outdated 
business-use access to an ISP over dial-up phone lines.
SDSL (Symmetric Digital 
Subscriber Line)
Up to 22 Mbps
Equal bandwidth in both directions. SDSL is a type of 
broadband technology. (Broadband refers to a networking 
technology that carries more than one type of signal, 
such as DSL and telephone or cable Internet and TV.) DSL 
uses regular phone lines and is an always-up or always-on 
connection that does not require a dial-up.
ADSL (Asymmetric DSL)
640 Kbps upstream 
and up to 24 Mbps 
downstream
Most bandwidth is from ISP to user. Slower versions of 
ADSL are called ADSL Lite or DSL Lite. ISP customers pay 
according to a bandwidth scale.
VDSL (very-high-bit-rate DSL)
Up to 70 Mbps
A type of asymmetric DSL that works only a short distance.

Currently, cable Internet and DSL are the two most popular ways to make an Internet connection. Let’s 
first compare these two technologies and then we’ll look at satellite, fiber-optic dedicated lines, and 
cellular WANs.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to be able to compare these network types used for Internet 
connections: cable, dial-up, DSL, fiber, satellite, ISDN, and cellular (mobile hotspot).
Compare Cable Internet and DSL
Here are the important facts about cable Internet and DSL:
	 Cable Internet is a broadband technology that uses cable TV lines and is always connected (always up). 
With cable Internet, the TV signal to your television and the data signals to your computer or LAN 
share the same coaxial (coax) cable. The cable modem converts a computer’s digital signals to analog 
when sending them and converts incoming analog data to digital.
	 DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) is a group of broadband technologies that covers a wide range of speeds. 
DSL uses ordinary copper phone lines and a range of frequencies on the copper wire that are not used 
by voice, making it possible for you to use the same phone line for voice and DSL at the same time. 
When you make a regular phone call, you dial in as usual. However, the DSL part of the line is always 
connected (always up) for most DSL services.
When deciding between cable Internet and DSL, consider these points:
	 Both cable Internet and DSL can sometimes be purchased on a sliding scale, depending on the bandwidth 
you want to buy. Subscriptions offer residential and the more-expensive business plans. Business plans 
are likely to have increased bandwidth and better support when problems arise.
	 With cable Internet, you share the TV cable infrastructure with your neighbors, which can result in 
service becoming degraded if many people in your neighborhood are using cable Internet at the same 
time. I once used cable Internet in a neighborhood where I found I needed to avoid web surfing between 
5:00 and 7:00 p.m. when folks were just coming in from work and using the Internet. With DSL, you’re 
using a dedicated phone line, so your neighbors’ surfing habits are not important.

	 With DSL, static over phone lines in your house can be a problem. The DSL company provides filters 
to install at each phone jack (see Figure 15-2), but still the problem might not be fully solved. Also, your 
phone line must qualify for DSL; some lines are too dirty (too much static or noise) to support DSL. 
Figure 15-3 shows a DSL modem that can connect directly to a computer or to a router.

are needed on every phone jack except 
the one used by the DSL modem

Satellite
People who live in remote areas and want high-speed Internet connections often are limited in their 
choices. DSL and cable options might not be available where they live, but satellite access is available 
from pretty much anywhere. Internet access by satellite is available even on airplanes. Passengers can 
connect to the Internet using a wireless hotspot and satellite dish on the plane. A satellite dish mounted 
on top of your house or office building communicates with a satellite used by an ISP offering the satellite 
service (see Figure 15-4). One disadvantage of satellite is that it requires line-of-sight connectivity without 
obstruction from mountains, trees, and tall buildings. Another disadvantage is that it experiences delays 
in transmission (called latency), especially when uploading, and is, therefore, not a good solution for an 
Internet connection that is to be used for videoconferencing or voice over Internet.

Dedicated Line Using Fiber Optic
Another broadband technology used for Internet access is fiber optic. The technology uses a dedicated line 
from your ISP to your place of business or residence. This dedicated line is called a point-to-point (PTP) 
connection because no other business or residence shares the line with you. Television, Internet data, and 
voice communication all share the broadband fiber-optic cable. Verizon calls the technology FiOS (Fiber 
Optic Service), and the fiber-optic cabling is used all the way from the ISP to your home. A provider might 
provide fiber-optic cabling up to your neighborhood and then use coaxial cable (similar to that used in 
cable Internet connections) for the last leg of the connection to your business or residence. Upstream and 
downstream speeds and prices vary.
Cellular WAN
A cellular network or cellular WAN consists of cells, and each cell is controlled by a base station 
(see Figure 15-5). The base station might include more than one transceiver and antenna on the same 
tower to support multiple technologies (such as LTE and GSM). Cell phones are called that because they 
use a cellular network.
A laptop or tablet might have an embedded 
cellular adapter to connect to a cellular network. 
If not, you can use a USB broadband modem to 
make the connection, which is sometimes called 
an air card. Recall from the chapter, “Connecting 
To and Setting Up a Network,” that you can also 
tether (by cable or Bluetooth) your smart phone 
or other mobile device to your computer so that 
the computer can connect to the ISP. Some mobile 
devices can create a mobile hotspot that computers 
and other mobile devices can connect by Wi-Fi to 
your device and on to the Internet.
Figure 15-5  A cellular WAN is made up of many cells that 
provide coverage over a wide area
Investigate Verizon FiOS
Verizon (verizon.com) offers FiOS, an alternative to DSL and cable for wired broadband Internet access 
to a residence or small business. FiOS is a fiber-optic Internet service that uses fiber-optic cable all the 
way to your house or business for both your telephone service and Internet access. Search the web for 
answers to these questions about FiOS:
1.	 Give a brief description of FiOS and how it is used for Internet access.
2.	 What downstream and upstream speeds can FiOS support?
3.	 When using FiOS, does your telephone voice communication share the fiber-optic cable with Internet data?
4.	 What does Verizon say about FiOS cabling used for television?
5.	 Is FiOS available in your area?

Dial-up Modems
Of all the types of networking connections, dial-up or POTS (plain old telephone service) is 
the least expensive and slowest connection to the Internet. Dial-up connections are painfully 
slow, but you might still need them when traveling, and they’re good at home when your 
broadband connection is down or when you just plain want to save money.
Modem cards in desktop computers provide two phone jacks, called RJ-11 jacks, so that one can be 
used for dial-up networking and the other jack can be used to plug in an extension telephone. Figure 15-6 
shows a modem card that comes bundled with drivers on CD and a phone cord. Phone cords are a type of 
twisted-pair cable and use an RJ-11 connector. Twisted-pair cabling uses pairs of wires twisted together to 
reduce crosstalk. The RJ-11 jack has four connectors, and a phone cord can have one or two twisted pairs 
for a total of two or four wires in the cord. The cord carries power on the lines that can be used to power 
a simple telephone. Laptop computers that have embedded dial-up modem capability generally have only 
a single phone jack. Dial-up standards are no longer being revised, and the last dial-up modem standard is 
the V.92 standard.

the drivers on CD before you physically install the modem. How to configure a modem card and set up a 
dial-up connection are covered in the chapter, “Connecting To and Setting Up a Network.”
Switches and Hubs
Today’s Ethernet networks use a design called a star bus topology, which means that nodes are 
connected to one or more centralized devices, which are connected to each other (see Figure 15-7). 
A centralized device can be a switch or a hub. Each device handles a network message differently.

Here are the differences between a hub and a switch:
	 An Ethernet hub transmits the data frame to every device, except the device that sent the frame, as 
shown in Figure 15-8a. A hub is just a pass-through and distribution point for every device connected to 
it, without regard for what kind of data is passing through and where the data might be going. Hubs are 
outdated technology, having been replaced by switches. Figure 15-9 shows a hub that supports 10 Mbps 
and 100 Mbps Ethernet speeds.
Figure 15-7  A star bus network formed by nodes connected to multiple switches
Notes In the chapter, “Connecting To and Setting Up a Network,” you learned about packets, which are messages 
sent over a TCP/IP network with IP address header information added. Just before a packet is put on the network, the 
network adapter adds additional information to the beginning and end of the packet, and this information includes the 
source and destination MAC addresses. The packet, with this additional information, is now called a frame.

	 A switch (see Figure 15-10) is smarter and more efficient than a hub because it keeps a table of all the 
MAC addresses for devices connected to it. When the switch receives a frame, it searches its MAC address 
table for the destination MAC address of the frame and sends the frame only to the device or interface 
using this MAC address (see Figure 15-8b). At first, a switch does not know the MAC addresses of every 
device connected to it. It learns this information as it receives frames and records the source MAC 
addresses in its MAC address table. When it receives a frame destined to a MAC address not in its table, 
the switch acts like a hub and broadcasts the frame to all devices except the one that sent it.
Figure 15-7, shown earlier in the chapter, uses three switches in sequence. Physically, the network 
cables that run between two switches or a switch and a computer might be inside a building’s walls 
Figure 15-10  A five-port Gigabit Ethernet switch by Linksys
with a network jack on the wall 
providing an RJ-45 connector. You plug 
a network cable into the jack to make 
the connection. In practice, a small 
network might begin as one switch and 
three or four computers. As the need for 
more computers grows, new switches 
are added to provide these extra 
connections.
Another reason to add a switch to a 
network is to regenerate the network  
signal. An Ethernet cable should not 
exceed 100 meters (about 328 feet) in 
length. If you need to reach distances 
greater than that, you can add a switch 
in the line, which regenerates the signal.
Wireless Access Points and Bridges
In the chapter, “Connecting To and Setting Up a Network,” you learned that a router can also 
be a wireless access point. In addition, a wireless access point can be a dedicated device. The 
wireless access point, such as the one shown in Figure 15-11, can also be a bridge. A bridge is 
a device that stands between two segments of a network and manages network traffic between 
them. For example, one network segment might be a wireless network and the other segment 
might be a wired network; the wireless access point (AP) connects these two segments. Functioning as a

bridge, the AP helps to reduce the overall volume of network traffic by not allowing data frames across 
the bridge if it knows that the frame is addressed to a destination on its own segment. Figure 15-12 
demonstrates the concept of a network bridge. (Logically, you can think of a switch as a multiport bridge.)
Notes If your wireless access point does not reach the entire area you need to cover, you can add a repeater or 
an extender, which amplifies and retransmits the signal to a wider coverage area. Repeaters and extenders capture the 
Wi-Fi signal, boost it, and retransmit it to the new area. The difference between a repeater and an extender is that a 
repeater rebroadcasts the signal using a new network name, whereas an extender keeps the original network name.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know the details listed in Table 15-2.
As you can see from Table 15-2, the three main types of cabling used by Ethernet are twisted-pair, 
coaxial, and fiber optic. Coaxial cable is older and almost never used for current networking cable. Within 
each category, there are several variations discussed next.
Similar to a switch, a bridge at first doesn’t know which nodes are on each network segment. It learns 
that information by maintaining a table of MAC addresses from information it collects from each frame that 
arrives at the bridge. Eventually, it learns which nodes are on which network segment and becomes more 
efficient at preventing frames from getting on the wrong segment, which can bog down network traffic.

cable. UTP cable is the least expensive and is commonly used on LANs. UTP is rated by twisted-pair 
category as listed in Table 15-3.

Coaxial Cable
Coaxial cable has a single copper wire down the middle and a braided shield around it (see Figure 15-14). 
The cable is stiff and difficult to manage, and is no longer used for networking. RG-6 coaxial cable is used 
for cable TV, having replaced the older and thinner RG-59 coaxial cable once used for cable TV. RG-6 
cables use an F connector shown in Figure 15-15.
Figure 15-13 shows unshielded twisted-pair cables and the RJ-45 connector. Twisted-pair cable has four 
pairs of twisted wires for a total of eight wires. You learn more about how the eight wires are arranged 
later in the chapter.

STP cable uses a covering or shield around each pair of wires inside the cable that protects it from 
electromagnetic interference caused by electrical motors, transmitters, or high-tension lines. It costs more 
than unshielded cable, so it’s used only when the situation demands it.
Notes Normally, the plastic covering of a cable is made of PVC (polyvinyl chloride), which is not safe when used 
inside plenums (areas between the floors of buildings). In these situations, plenum cable covered with Teflon is used 
because it does not give off toxic fumes when burned. Plenum cable is two or three times more expensive than PVC 
cable. Figure 15-13 shows plenum cable and PVC cable, which are unshielded twisted-pair cables.

Fiber Optic
Fiber-optic cables transmit signals as pulses of light over glass or plastic strands inside protected tubing, 
as illustrated in Figure 15-16. Fiber-optic cable comes in two types: single-mode (thin, difficult to connect, 
expensive, and best performing) and multimode (most popular). A single-mode cable uses a single path 
for light to travel in the cable and multimode cable uses multiple paths for light. Both single-mode and 
multimode fiber-optic cables can be constructed as loose-tube cables for outdoor use or tight-buffered 
cables for indoor or outdoor use. Loose-tube cables are filled with gel to prevent water from soaking into 
the cable, and tight-buffered cables are filled with synthetic or glass yarn, called strength wires, to protect 
the fiber-optic strands, as shown in Figure 15-16.

Ethernet Standards and Cables
Recall that Ethernet can run at four speeds. Each version of Ethernet can use more than one cabling 
method. Here is a brief description of the transmission speeds and the cabling methods they use:
	 10-Mbps Ethernet. This first Ethernet specification was invented by Xerox Corporation in the 1970s, 
and later became known as Ethernet.
	 100-Mbps Ethernet or Fast Ethernet. This improved version of Ethernet (sometimes called 100BaseT 
or Fast Ethernet) operates at 100 Mbps and uses STP or UTP cabling rated CAT-5 or higher. 100BaseT 
networks can support slower speeds of 10 Mbps so that devices that run at either 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps 
can coexist on the same LAN. Two variations of 100BaseT are 100BaseTX and 100BaseFX. The most 
popular variation is 100BaseTX. 100BaseFX uses fiber-optic cable.
	 1000-Mbps Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet. This version of Ethernet operates at 1000 Mbps and uses 
twisted-pair cable and fiber-optic cable. Gigabit Ethernet is becoming the most popular choice for 
LAN technology. Because it can use the same cabling and connectors as Fast Ethernet, a company 
can upgrade from Fast Ethernet to Gigabit without rewiring the network.
	 10-Gigabit Ethernet. This version of Ethernet operates at 10 billion bits per second (10 Gbps) and 
uses fiber-optic cable. It can be used on LANs, MANs, and WANs, and is also a good choice for 
backbone networks. (A backbone network is a channel whereby local networks can connect to wide 
area networks or to each other.)
Powerline Networking or Ethernet Over Power (EoP)
If you need network access to a remote location in a building where network cabling and 
Wi-Fi cannot reach, you have another option. The HomePlug standard introduced in 2001, 
powerline networking or Ethernet over Power (EoP), uses the power lines in a building to 
transmit data. Powerline networking is simple to set up, inexpensive, and can run at Gigabit

To install powerline networking, follow these steps:
1. Connect a powerline adapter to your router using an Ethernet cable, then plug it directly into a wall outlet.
2. In the same room, connect a second adapter to your computer using an Ethernet cable and then plug it 
directly into a wall outlet.
3. To pair the two devices, press and hold the security button on the first adapter for a couple seconds. 
When the LED lights flash, you have less than two minutes to press and hold the security button on the 
second adapter until the LED lights flash. The two adapters are now paired using security encryption. 
For additional adapters, simply repeat this step with a new adapter one at a time.
4. You can now move the second adapter to its final destination in the building knowing that you have a 
secured connection.
Powerline networks are not without problems. Consider the following issues powerline networking presents:
	 Powerline adapters must be plugged directly into a wall outlet. Plugging a powerline adapter into a 
power strip or surge protector or sharing an outlet with an energy hog like a space heater hinders the 
function of the device.
	 Powerline adapters might be large and cover both outlets on a single wall plate. A few powerline adapt-
ers offer a pass-through outlet, but most do not.
	 Sometimes people forget to use the encryption options and end up with an unsecured network.
	 Distance degrades quality. If you have a map of the building’s circuits, try to keep the two adapters as 
close on the same circuit as possible. Jumping circuits decreases signal strength.

speeds. Like Wi-Fi, the data is sent out on a network that you cannot necessarily contain because power 
lines are not confined to a single building. If a building or apartment is sharing a phase (electrical signal) 
with another building or apartment, the data might leak and be intercepted by a neighbor. For this reason, 
powerline adapters offer encryption (128-bit AES encryption) that is activated by pairing the adapters to 
each other. Alternately, you can install the manufacturer’s utility on your computer to create a network key.
To use powerline networking, you need at least two powerline adapters (see Figure 15-18), which can be 
bought in pairs called a kit.

Supporting Network Hardware
Some devices, such as a webcam, are designed to receive both power and data from the Ethernet cable. 
For other devices, you must use a splitter that splits the data and power transmissions before connecting to 
the device. PoE can provide up to 25.5 W from a single Ethernet port. The amount of power that reaches 
a device degrades with the length of the cable. Figure 15-20 shows a PoE switch and a splitter used to 
provide power to a non-PoE access point. When setting up a device to receive power by PoE, make sure 
the device sending the power, the splitter, and the device receiving the power are all compatible. Pay special 
attention to the voltage and wattage requirements and the type of power connector of the receiving device.
When shopping for powerline adapters, consider these things:
	 Most powerline manufacturers belong to the Homeplug Alliance group (www.homeplug.org). Make sure 
the adapter you are considering is Homeplug certified.
	 Make sure the adapter is rated for the latest Homeplug AV2 speed standard for Gigabit-class data transfers.
	 If you have limited wall outlets, you might need a powerline adapter that offers a pass-through outlet.
Power Over Ethernet (PoE)
If you have the opposite problem of needing to get power where your network cabling has gone, 
you can use Power over Ethernet (PoE). Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a feature that might be 
available on high-end wired network adapters to allow power to be transmitted over Ethernet cable. 
Using this feature, you can place a wireless access point, webcam, IP phone, or other device that 
needs power in a position in a building where you don’t have an electrical outlet. The Ethernet cable to the device 
provides both power and data transmissions. Most high-quality switches provide PoE. If your NIC doesn’t offer 
PoE, you can add it using a PoE injector (see Figure 15-19). The PoE injector adds power to an Ethernet cable.

Research a Network Upgrade
An IT support technician is often called on to research equipment to maintain or improve a 
computer or network and make recommendations for purchase. Suppose you are asked to upgrade 
a small network that consists of one switch and four computers from 100BaseT to Gigabit Ethernet. 
The switch connects to a router that already supports Gigabit Ethernet. Do the following to price 
the hardware needed for this upgrade:
1.	 Find three switches by different manufacturers that support Gigabit Ethernet and have at least five ports. Save 
or print the webpages describing each switch.
2.	 Compare the features and prices of the three switches. What additional information might you want to know 
before you make your recommendation for a small business network?
3.	 Find three network adapters by different manufacturers to install in the desktop computers to support Gigabit 
Ethernet. Save or print webpages for each NIC.
4.	 Compare features of the three network adapters. What additional information do you need to know before you 
make your recommendation?
5.	 Make your recommendations based on the moderate (middle-of-the-road) choices. What is the total price of 
the upgrade, including one switch and four network adapters?
6.	 What is one more question you need to have answered about other equipment before you can complete the 
price of the upgrade? Explain how you would find the answer to your question.

Setting Up and Troubleshooting Network Wiring
To set up a small network, you’ll need computers, switches, network cables, a router, and 
whatever device (for example, a DSL or cable modem) that provides Internet access. Some 
network cables might be wired inside walls of your building with wall jacks that use RJ-45 
ports. These cables might converge in an electrical closet or server room. If network cables 
are lying on the floor, be sure to install them against the wall so they won’t be a trip hazard. Take care 
that cables don’t exceed the recommended length (100 meters for twisted pair). For best results, always 
use twisted-pair cables rated at CAT-5e or higher. (CAT-6 gives better performance than CAT-5e for 
Gigabit Ethernet, but it is a lot harder to wire and also more expensive.) To connect multiple computers, 
use switches rated at the same speed as your router and network adapters. For Gigabit speed on the entire 
network, you need to use all Gigabit switches and network adapters and a Gigabit router. However, if 
some devices run at slower speeds, most likely a switch or router can still support the higher speeds for 
other devices on the network.
If your router is also your wireless access point, take care in planning where to place it. Place the 
wireless access point near the center of the area where you want your wireless hotspot. The router also 
needs to have access to your cable modem or DSL modem. The modem needs access to the cable TV or 
phone jack where it receives service. Figure 15-21 shows a possible inexpensive wiring job where two 
switches and a router are used to wire two rooms for five workstations and a network printer. The only 
inside-wall wiring that is required is two back-to-back RJ-45 wall jacks on either side of the wall between 
the two rooms. The plan allows for all five desktop computers and a network printer to be wired with 
cabling neatly attached to the baseboards of the office without being a trip hazard.

	 Loopback plug. A loopback plug can be used to test a network cable or port. To test a port 
or cable, connect one end of the cable to a network port on a computer or other device, and 
connect the loopback plug to the other end of the cable (see Figure 15-22). If the LED light on the loopback 
plug lights up, the cable and port are good. Another way to use a loopback plug is to find out which port 
on a switch in an electrical closet matches up with a wall jack. Plug the loopback plug into the wall jack. 
The connecting port on the switch in the closet lights up. When buying a loopback plug, pay attention to 
the Ethernet speeds it supports. Some only support 100 Mbps; others support 100 Mbps and 1000 Mbps.

	 Cable tester. A cable tester is used to test a cable to find out if it is good or to find out what type of 
cable it is if the cable is not labeled. You can also use a cable tester to locate the ends of a network cable 
in a building. A cable tester has two components, the remote and the base (see Figure 15-23).
Figure 15-23  Use a cable tester pair to determine the type of cable and/or if the cable is good
To test a cable, connect each component to the ends of the cable and turn on the tester. Lights on the 
tester will show you if the cable is good and what type of cable you have. You’ll need to read the user 
manual that comes with the cable tester to know how to interpret the lights.
You can also use the cable tester to find the two ends of a network cable installed in a building. Suppose 
you see several network jacks on walls in a building, but you don’t know which jacks connect. Install a 
short cable in each of the two jacks or a jack and a port in a patch panel. Then use the cable tester base 
and remote to test the continuity, as shown in Figure 15-24. Whereas a loopback plug works with live 
cables and ports, a cable tester works on cables that are not live. You might damage a cable tester if you 
connect it to a live circuit, so before you start connecting the cable tester to wall jacks, be sure that you 
turn off all devices on the network.

	 Network multimeter. You learned about multimeters in the chapter, “First Look at Computer Parts and 
Tools.” A network multimeter (see Figure 15-25) is a multifunctional tool that can test cables, ports, and 
network adapters. When you connect it to your network, it can also detect the Ethernet speed, duplex 
status, default router on the network, length of a cable, voltage levels of PoE, and other network statistics 
and details. Many network multimeters can document test results and upload results to a computer. Good 
network multimeters can cost several hundred dollars.
	 Wi-Fi analyzer. A Wi-Fi analyzer is software that can find Wi-Fi networks, determine signal strengths, 
help optimize Wi-Fi signal settings, and help identify Wi-Fi security threats. For example, you can use a 
Wi-Fi analyzer to find out which Wi-Fi channels are being used before you pick your channels. You can 
turn your smart phone into a Wi-Fi analyzer by installing a free or inexpensive app through your 
phone’s app store (see Figure 15-26).
	 Toner probe. A toner probe, sometimes called a tone probe, is a two-part kit that is used to find cables in 
the walls of a building. See Figure 15-27. The toner connects to one end of the cable and puts out a continu-
ous or pulsating tone on the cable. While the toner is putting out the tone, you use the probe to search the 
walls for the tone. The probe amplifies the tone so you hear it as a continuous or pulsating beep. The beeps 
get louder when you are close to the cable and weaker when you move the probe away from the cable. With 
a little patience, you can trace the cable through the walls. Some toners can put out tones up to 10 miles on 
a cable and offer a variety of ways to connect to the cable, such as clips and RJ-45 and RJ-11 connectors.

	 Wire stripper. A wire stripper is used to build your own network cable or repair a cable. Use the wire 
stripper to cut away the plastic jacket or coating around the wires inside a twisted-pair cable so that you 
can install a connector on the end of the cable. How to use wire strippers is covered later in the chapter.
	 Crimper. A crimper is used to attach a terminator or connector to the end of a cable. It applies force to 
pinch the connector to the wires in the cable to securely make a solid connection. Figure 15-28 shows a 
multifunctional crimper that can crimp a RJ-45 or RJ-11 connector. It also serves double-duty as a wire 
cutter and wire stripper.

	 Punchdown tool. A punchdown tool, also called an impact tool (see Figure 15-29), is used to punch 
individual wires in a network cable into their slots in a keystone RJ-45 jack that is used in an RJ-45 
wall jack. Later in the chapter, you learn how to use the tool with a keystone jack.

Figure 15-29  A punchdown tool forces a wire into a slot and cuts off the wire
	
Another use of a punchdown tool is to terminate network cables in a patch panel. A patch panel 
(see Figure 15-30) provides multiple network ports for cables that converge in one location such as 
an electrical closet or server room. Each port is numbered on the front of the panel. On the back side, 
keystone jacks are color-coded for the wires to be inserted.
	
When terminating a cable in a keystone jack, you first gently push each wire down into the color-coded 
slot of the keystone jack and then you use the punchdown tool to punch the wire down all the way into 
the slot. A small blade on the tip of one prong cuts off the wire at the side of the slot.
Now that you know about the tools you’ll need to wire networks, let’s see how the cables and connectors 
are wired.

How Twisted-Pair Cables and Connectors Are Wired
Recall from the chapter, “Connecting To and Setting Up a Network,” that two types of 
network cables can be used when building a network: a straight-through cable and a crossover 
cable. A straight-through cable (also called a patch cable) is used to connect a computer to 
a switch or other network device. A crossover cable is used to connect two like devices such 
as a hub to a hub or a computer to a computer (to make the simplest network of all).
The difference between a straight-through cable and a crossover cable is the way the transmit and 
receive lines are wired in the connectors at each end of the cables. A crossover cable has the transmit 
and receive lines reversed so that one device receives off the line to which the other device transmits. Before 
the introduction of Gigabit Ethernet, 10BaseT and 100BaseT required that a crossover cable be used 
to connect two like devices such as a switch to a switch. Today’s devices that support Gigabit Ethernet 
use auto-uplinking, which means you can connect a switch to a switch using a straight-through cable. 
Crossover cables are seldom used today except to connect a computer to a computer to create this simple 
two-node network.
Twisted-pair copper wire cabling uses an RJ-45 connector that has eight pins, as shown in 
Figure 15-31. 10BaseT and 100BaseT Ethernet use only four of these pins: pins 1 and 2 for transmitting 
data and pins 3 and 6 for receiving data. The other pins can be used for phone lines or for power 
(using PoE). Gigabit Ethernet uses all eight pins to transmit and receive data and can also transmit power 
on these same lines.

Twisted-pair cabling used with RJ-45 connectors is color-coded in four pairs, as shown in Figure 15-31. 
Pair 1 is blue, pair 2 is orange, pair 3 is green, and pair 4 is brown. Each pair has one solid wire and one 
striped wire. Two standards have been established in the industry for wiring twisted-pair cabling and RJ-45 
connectors: T568A and T568B standards. Both are diagrammed in Figure 15-31 and listed in Table 15-4. 
The T568A standard has the green pair connected to pins 1 and 2 and the orange pair connected to pins 3 
and 6. The T568B standard has the orange pair using pins 1 and 2 and the green pair using pins 3 and 6, 
as shown in the diagram and the table. For both standards, the blue pair uses pins 4 and 5, and the brown 
pair uses pins 7 and 8.

It doesn’t matter which standard you use so long as you’re consistent. The important thing is that the 
wiring on one end of the cable match the wiring on the other end, be it T568A or T568B standards. Either 
way, you have a straight-through cable.

Notes The T568A and T568B standards as well as other network wiring standards and recommendations are overseen 
by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), Electronics Industries Alliance (EIA), and American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI).
For 10BaseT and 100BaseT networks, if you use T568A wiring on one end of the cable and T568B on 
the other end of the cable, you have a crossover cable (see the diagram on the left side of Figure 15-32). 
For Gigabit Ethernet (1000BaseT) that transmits data on all four pairs, you must not only cross the green 
and orange pairs but also cross the blue and brown pairs to make a crossover cable (see the diagram on 
the right side of Figure 15-32). Recall, however, that crossover cables are seldom used on Gigabit Ethernet. 
When you buy a crossover cable, most likely it is wired only for 10BaseT or 100BaseT networks. If you ever 
find yourself needing to make a crossover cable, be sure to cross all four pairs so the cable will work on 
10BaseT, 100BaseT, and 1000BaseT networks. You can also buy an adapter to convert a straight-through 
cable to a crossover cable. But most likely the adapter only crosses two pairs and works only for 10BaseT 
or 100BaseT networks, such as the adapter shown in Figure 15-33.

Setting Up and Troubleshooting Network Wiring

When you are wiring a network in a building 
that already has network wiring, be sure to 
find out if the wiring is using T568A or T568B. 
And then be sure you always use that standard. 
If you don’t know which to use, use T568B 
because it’s the most common, unless, however, 
you are working for the U.S. government, which 
requires T568A for all its networking needs.

Make a Straight-Through Cable Using 
T568B Wiring
It takes a little practice to make a good network straight-through cable, but you’ll get the hang of it 
after doing only a couple of cables. Figure 15-34 shows the materials and tools you’ll need to make a 
network cable.

Figure 15-34  Tools and materials to make a network cable
Here are the steps to make a straight-through cable using the T568B standard:
1.	 Use wire cutters to cut the twisted-pair cable the correct length plus a few extra inches.
2.	 If your RJ-45 connectors include boots, slide two boots onto the cable.
3.	 Use wire strippers to strip off about two inches of the plastic jacket from the end of the wire. To do that, put 
the wire in the stripper and rotate the stripper around the wire to score the jacket (see Figure 15-35). You 
can then pull off the jacket.

4.	 Use wire cutters to start a cut into the jacket, and then use the rip cord to pull the jacket back a couple of 
inches (see Figure 15-36). Next, cut off the rip cord and the jacket. You take this extra precaution of removing 
the jacket because you might have nicked the wires with the wire strippers.
Figure 15-35  Rotate a wire stripper around the jacket to score it so you can 
slide it off the wire
Figure 15-36  Rip back the jacket, and then cut off the extra jacket and rip cord
5.	 Untwist each pair of wires so you have the eight separate wires. Smooth each wire out, straightening out the 
kinks. Line up the wires in the T568B configuration (refer to Table 15-4).
6.	 Holding the tightly lined-up wires between your fingers, use wire cutters to cut the wires off evenly, leaving 
a little over an inch of wire. See Figure 15-37. To know how short to cut the wires, hold the RJ-45 connector 
up to the wires. The wires must go all the way to the front of the connector. The jacket must go far enough 
into the connector so that the crimp at the back of the connector will be able to solidly pinch the jacket.

7.	 Be sure you have pin 1 of the connector lined up with the orange and white wire. Then insert the eight 
wires in the RJ-45 connector. Guide the wires into the connector, making sure they reach all the way to the 
front. (It helps to push up a bit as you push the wires into the connector.) You can jam the jacket firmly 
into the connector. Look through the clear plastic connector to make sure the wires are lined up correctly 
and they all reach the front and that the jacket goes past the crimp.
8.	 Insert the connector into the crimper tool. Use one hand to push the connector firmly into the crimper as 
you use the other hand to crimp the connector. See Figure 15-38. Use plenty of force to crimp. The eight 
blades at the front of the connector must pierce through to each copper wire to complete each of the eight 
connections, and the crimp at the back of the connector must solidly crimp the cable jacket to secure the 
cable to the connector (see Figure 15-39). Remove the connector from the crimper and make sure you can’t 
pull the connector off the wire.

Notes Networking standards that apply to wiring a keystone RJ-45 jack and a straight-through panel say that, to 
avoid crosstalk, the cable jacket should be removed to expose no more than three inches of twisted-pair wires, and that 
exposed twisted-pair wires should be untwisted no more than a half inch.
Wire a Keystone Jack
A keystone RJ-45 jack is used in a network wall jack. Here are the instructions to wire one:
Applying  Concepts
A+ 
220-901 
2.1, 2.2, 
2.9, 4.4
1.	 Using a wire stripper and wire cutter, strip and trim back the jacket from the twisted-pair wire, 
leaving about two inches of wire exposed. Untwist the wires only so far as necessary so each 
wire can be inserted in the color-coded slot in the jack. The twists are needed to prevent crosstalk, and the 
untwisted wire should be no longer than a half inch. Figure 15-41 shows the wires in position for T568B 
wiring. Notice how the cable jacket goes into the keystone jack.
2.	 Using the punchdown tool, make sure the blade side of the tool is on the outside of the jack. (The punchdown 
tool has Cut embedded on the blade side of the tool.) Push down with force to punch each wire into its slot 
and cut off the wire on the outside edge of the slot. It might take a couple of punches to do the job. See the 
left side of Figure 15-42. Place the jack cover over the jack, as shown in the right side of Figure 15-42.
3.	 The jack can now be inserted into the back side of a wall faceplate (see Figure 15-43). Make sure the wires in 
the jack are at the top of the jack. If you look closely at the faceplate, you can see the arrow pointing up. 
It’s important the wires in the jack be at the top so that over the years dust doesn’t settle on these wires. 
Use screws to secure the faceplate to the wall receptacle. Be sure to use a cable tester to check the network 
cable from its jack to the other end to make sure the wiring is good. When wiring a building, testing the 
cable and its two connections is called certifying the cable.

Some guidelines to follow when troubleshooting a network problem related to hardware are outlined in 
Figure 15-44 and listed here:
Begin troubleshooting the network.
Can you browse the web and
access network resources?
You have network access.
Do you see the status indicator
lights on the network port lit?
Does a loopback plug indicate the
network port is good?
Does Device Manager report
errors with the network adapter?
Troubleshoot the
network adapter.
Run the diagnostics routine for
the network adapter.
Yes
Assume the problem is not
related to network hardware.
Try to repair the network
connection in Windows.
Does a loopback plug indicate the wall
jack port is good?
Try a known good
patch cable.
Does a cable tester indicate the cable from the wall
jack port to the patch panel port is good?
Rewire the keystone wall jack.
Check for connectivity. You
might need to also rewire the
keystone jack in the patch
panel.
The source of the problem
is some other device on
the network. A network
multimeter can help zero
in on the device.

1. First check the status indicator lights on the network ports for connectivity and activity.
2. Use a loopback plug to verify each port. The loopback plug can work on ports provided by a computer, 
wall jack, patch panel, switch, router, or other device that is turned on. If you find a bad port, try a 
different port on a switch, router, or patch panel. You might need to replace the device.

Supporting Network Hardware
3. For short straight-through cables connecting a computer to a wall jack or other nearby device, 
exchanging the straight-through cable for a known good one is easier and quicker than using a cable 
tester to test the cable.
4. Use a cable tester to verify a cable permanently installed alongside or inside a wall is good. To test the 
cable, you have to first disconnect it from a computer, patch panel, switch, or other device at both ends 
of the cable. Common problems with networks are poorly wired termination in patch panels and wall 
jacks. If the cable proves bad, first try reinstalling the two jacks before you replace the cable.
Research Network Tools
Use the web to research the features and prices for the network tools you learned about in this chapter 
that you can include among your computer and network repair tools. Suppose you have a budget of 
$200 to buy a wire stripper, wire cutter, crimper, cable tester, loopback plug, punchdown tool, toner 
probe, and/or network multimeter. Save or print webpages showing the features and price of each tool 
you select for your toolkit. Which, if any tools, did you decide to not purchase? Why?

TCP/IP Utilities Used for Troubleshooting
Windows includes several TCP/IP utilities you can use to troubleshoot networking problems. 
In this part of the chapter, you learn to use ping, ipconfig, ifconfig, nslookup, tracert, the net 
commands, nbtstat, netstat, and netcom. Most of these program files are found in the \Windows\
System32 folder.
A+  
220-901

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know about these TCP/IP utilities: ping, ipconfig, ifconfig, 
tracert, netstat, nbtstat, net, netdom, and nslookup. You need to know when and how to use each utility and how to 
interpret results.
Notes Only the more commonly used parameters or switches for each command are discussed. For several of these 
commands, you can use the /? or /help parameter to get more help with the command. And for even more information 
about each command, search the technet.microsoft.com site.
Now let’s see how to use each utility.
Ping [-a] [-t] [TargetName]
The ping (Packet InterNet Groper) command tests connectivity by sending an echo request to a remote 
computer. If the remote computer is online, detects the signal, and is configured to respond to a ping, 
it responds. (Responding to a ping is the default Windows setting.) Use ping to test for connectivity or to 
verify name resolution is working. A few examples of ping are shown in Table 15-5. Two examples are 
shown in Figure 15-45.
Table 15-5  Examples of the ping command
Ping Command
Description
ping 69.32.142.109
To test for connectivity using an IP address. If the remote computer responds, the 
round-trip times are displayed.
ping –a 69.32.142.109
The –a parameter tests for name resolution. Use it to display the host name and 
verify DNS is working.
ping –t 69.32.142.109
The –t parameter causes pinging to continue until interrupted. To display 
statistics, press Ctrl+Break. To stop pinging, press Ctrl+C.
ping 127.0.0.1
A loopback address test. The IP address 127.0.0.1 always refers to the local 
computer. If the local computer does not respond, you can assume there is a 
problem with the TCP/IP configuration.
ping www.cengage.com
Use a host name to find out the IP address of a remote computer. If the computer 
does not respond, assume there is a problem with DNS. On the other hand, some 
computers are not configured to respond to pings.

ipconfig /release
Releases the IP address when dynamic IP addressing is being used.
ipconfig /release6
Releases an IPv6 address.
ipconfig /renew
Leases a new IP address from a DHCP server. Make sure you release the IP address 
before you renew it.
ipconfig /renew6
Leases a new IPv6 address from a DHCP IPv6 server. Make sure you release the 
IPv6 address before you renew it.
ipconfig /displaydns
Displays information about name resolutions that Windows currently holds in the 
DNS resolver cache.
ipconfig /flushdns
Flushes the name resolver cache, which might solve a problem when the browser 
cannot find a host on the Internet.
Ifconfig [-a] [interface] [up] [down]
The ifconfig (interface configuration) command is similar to ipconfig, and is used on UNIX, Linux, and 
Mac OS X operating systems. Some examples of the command are listed in Table 15-7.
Notes Commands entered in Linux, UNIX, and OS X are case sensitive: Upper- and lowercase matter.

Nslookup [ComputerName]
The nslookup (namespace lookup) command lets you read information from the Internet namespace by 
requesting information about domain name resolutions from the DNS server’s zone data. Zone data is 
information about domain names and their corresponding IP addresses kept by a DNS server. For example, 
to find out what your DNS server knows about the domain name www.microsoft.com, use this command:
nslookup www.microsoft.com
Figure 15-46 shows the results. Notice in the figure that the DNS server reports one IPv4 address and 
two IPv6 addresses assigned to www.microsoft.com. It also reports that this information is nonauthoritative, 
meaning that it is not the authoritative, or final, name server for the www.microsoft.com computer name.
Notes You cannot use the ifconfig command to disable or enable the network interface without root access to the 
OS. In the chapter, “Virtualization, Linux, and Mac OS X,” you learn how to use the sudo command to run a command 
that requires root access.
Ifconfig Command
Description
ifconfig
Displays details of active interfaces and their assigned IP addresses. If a computer has 
only a single NIC, its interface name is most likely eth0.
ifconfig -a
Displays a list of active and inactive network interfaces.
ifconfig  
<interface name>
Displays details of a specific network interface. For example:
ifconfig eth0
ifconfig  
<interface name> up
Enables a network interface. For example:  
ifconfig eth0 up
ifconfig  
<interface name> 
down 
Disables a network interface. Disabling and enabling the network interface can 
sometimes solve a problem with network connectivity in Linux, UNIX, or OS X.

A reverse lookup is when you use the nslookup command to find the host name when you know a 
computer’s IP address, such as:
nslookup 192.168.1.102
To find out the default DNS server for a network, enter the nslookup command with no parameters.

Tracert [TargetName]
The tracert (trace route) command can be useful when you’re trying to resolve a problem reaching a 
destination host such as an FTP site or website. The command sends a series of requests to the destination 
computer and displays each hop to the destination. (A hop happens when a packet moves from one router 
to another.) For example, to trace the route to the www.cengage.com site, enter this command in a command 
prompt window:
tracert www.cengage.com
The results of this command are shown in Figure 15-47. A packet is assigned a Time to Live (TTL), which 
is the number of hop counts it can make before a router drops the packet and sends an ICMP message back 
to the host that sent the packet (see Figure 15-48). Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages are 
used by routers and hosts to communicate error messages and updates, and some routers don’t send this 
information. The tracert command creates its report from these messages. If a router doesn’t respond, the 
Request timed out message appears.

The Net Commands
The net command is several commands in one, and most of the net commands require an elevated command 
prompt window. In this section, you learn about the net use, net user, and net localgroup commands. The 
net use command connects or disconnects a computer from a shared resource or can display information 
about connections. For example, the following command makes a new connection to a remote computer 
and to a shared folder on that computer:
net use \\bluelight\Medical
Notes Other important net commands are net accounts, net config, net print, net share, and net view. You might 
want to do a Google search on these commands to find out how they work.
Use the following command to pass a user name and password to the \\bluelight remote computer and 
then map a network drive to the \Medical folder on that computer:
net use \\bluelight\Medical /user:”Jean Andrews” mypassword
net use z: \\bluelight\Medical
The double quotation marks are needed in the first command above because the user name has a space in it.
A persistent network connection is one that happens at each logon. To make the two commands persistent, 
add the /persistent parameter like this:
net use \\bluelight\Medical /user:”Jean Andrews” mypassword /persistent:yes
net use z: \\bluelight\Medical /persistent:yes
The net user command manages user accounts. For example, recall that the built-in administrator account 
is disabled by default. To activate the account, use this net user command:
net user administrator /active:yes
The net localgroup command adds, displays, or modifies local user groups. To display available local groups, 
use the following command:
net localgroup
To change a standard user account, Tom Jones, to an administrator account, use the following command:
net localgroup administrators “Tom Jones” /add
To change an administrator account, Tom Jones, to a standard account, use the following command:
net localgroup administrators “Tom Jones” /delete
Nbtstat [-n] [-r] [-RR]
The nbtstat (NetBIOS over TCP/IP statistics) command is used to display statistics about the NetBT 
(NetBIOS over TCP/IP) protocol. NetBIOS is an older network protocol suite used before TCP/IP. 
Occasionally, you find a legacy application still in use that relies on NetBIOS and NetBIOS computer names. 
The NetBT protocol was developed to allow NetBIOS to work over a TCP/IP network.
Whereas TCP/IP uses a Hosts file on the local computer and a DNS server to resolve computer names, 
NetBIOS uses an Lmhosts file on the local computer and a WINS (Windows Internet Name Service) server 
to resolve NetBIOS computer names. Table 15-8 lists some nbtstat commands that you might use when a 
legacy application cannot access resources on the network.

Netdom [add] [move] [resetpwd] [verify]
The netdom (network domain) command allows administrators to manage Active Directory domains and trust 
relationships for Windows Server from the command prompt on the server or remotely from a Windows 8/7 
workstation. The netdom command must be run using an elevated command prompt. Table 15-10 lists a few 
netdom commands.
A+ Exam Tip
Normally, the A+ exams don’t require you to know about commands that are used only in Windows 
Server. This one netdom command is an exception and the A+ 220-901 exam expects you to be familiar with the command.
Strategies for Troubleshooting Network Connections
With tools in hand, you’re now ready to tackle network troubleshooting, including problem 
solving when there is no connectivity and limited or intermittent connectivity. Here is how to 
find out the extent of the problem:
1. To check for local connectivity, use File Explorer in Windows 8 or Windows Explorer in Windows 7 to 
try to access shared folders on the network. No connectivity might be caused by the network cable or its 
connection, a wireless switch not turned on, a bad network adapter, or TCP/IP settings in Windows.
2. Determine whether other computers on the network are having trouble with their connections. If the entire 
network is down, the problem is not isolated to the computer you are working on.
3. If you can access some, but not all, shared resources on the network, this limited connectivity problem 
might be caused by cables or a switch on the network or a problem at the computer sharing the resources 
you’re trying to reach.
4. To test for Internet access, use a browser to surf the web. Problems with no Internet access can be caused 
by cables, a SOHO router, a broadband modem, or problems at the ISP.
5. To find out if a computer with limited or no connectivity was able to initially connect to a DHCP server 
on the network, check for an Automatic Private IP Address (APIPA). Recall from the chapter, “Connecting 
To and Setting Up a Network,” that a computer assigns itself an APIPA if it is unable to find a DHCP 
server at the time it first connects to the network. Use the ipconfig command to find out the IP address 
(see Figure 15-50). In the results, an APIPA presents itself as the Autoconfiguration IPv4 Address, and the 
address begins with 169.254.

Now let’s see how to handle problems with no or intermittent connectivity and then we’ll look at problems 
with Internet access.
Problems with No Connectivity or Intermittent Connectivity
When a computer has no network connectivity or intermittent connectivity, begin by checking hardware 
and then move on to checking Windows network settings.
Follow these steps to solve problems with hardware:
1. Check the status indicator lights on the NIC or the motherboard Ethernet port. A steady light indicates 
connectivity and a blinking light indicates activity (see Figure 15-51). Check the indicator lights on 
the router or switch at the other end. Try a different port on the device. If the router or switch is in a 
server closet and the ports are not well labeled, you can use a loopback plug to find out which port the 
computer is using. If you don’t see either light, this problem must be resolved before you consider OS 
or application problems.

2. Check the network cable connection at both ends. Is the cable connected to a port on the motherboard 
that is disabled? It might need to be connected to the network port provided by a network card. A cable 
tester can verify the cable is good or if it is the correct cable (patch cable or crossover cable). Try a 
different network cable.
3. For wireless networking, make sure the wireless switch on a laptop is turned on. If you have no 
connectivity, limited connectivity, or intermittent connectivity, move the laptop to a new position in 
the hotspot. Use a wireless locator to find the best position. Rebooting a laptop might solve the problem 
of not receiving a signal. Problems with a low RF signal can sometimes be solved by moving the laptop 
or connecting to a different wireless access point with a stronger RF signal.
4. After you’ve checked cable connections and the wireless switch and the problem still persists, turn to 
Windows to repair the network connection. Use one of these methods:
	 In an elevated command prompt window, use these two commands: ipconfig /release followed by 
ipconfig /renew.
	 In the Network and Sharing Center, click Troubleshoot problems to access a Windows network 
connectivity diagnostic tool (see Figure 15-52).
	 If that doesn’t work, return to the Network and Sharing Center, click Change adapter settings, right-click 
the connection, and click Disable. Then right-click the connection again and click Enable.
Figure 15-52  Windows indicates a network connectivity problem
If the problem is still not resolved, you need to dig deeper. Perhaps the problem is with the network adapter 
drivers. To solve problems with device drivers, which might also be related to a problem with the NIC, follow 
these steps:
1. Make sure the network adapter and its drivers are installed by checking for the adapter in Device 
Manager. Device Manager should report the device is working with no problems.
2. If errors are reported, try updating the device drivers. (Use another computer to download new drivers to 
a USB flash drive and then move the flash drive to this computer.) If the drivers still install with errors, 
look on the manufacturer’s website or installation CD that came bundled with the adapter for diagnostic 
software that might help diagnose the problem.

3. If Device Manager still reports errors, try running anti-malware software and updating Windows. Then 
try replacing your network adapter. If that does not work, the problem might be a corrupted Windows 
installation.
Intermittent connectivity on a wired network might happen when a network device such as a VoIP phone is 
sensitive to electrical interference. You can solve this problem by attaching a ferrite clamp (see Figure 15-53) 
on the network cable near the port. This clamp helps to eliminate electromagnetic interference (EMI). Some 
cables come with preinstalled clamps, and you can also buy ferrite clamps to attach to other cables.

yet installed

Problems with Internet Connectivity
If you have local connectivity, but not Internet access, do the following:
1. Try recycling the connection to the ISP. Follow these steps:
	 Unplug from the power source the cable modem, DSL modem, or other device that you use to connect 
to your ISP. Unplug the router. Wait about five minutes for the connection to break at the ISP.
	 Plug in the cable modem, DSL modem, or other ISP device. Wait until the lights settle. Then plug in 
your router.
	 On any computer on your network, use the Network and Sharing Center to repair the network 
connection. Open your browser and try to browse some websites.
2. For a cable modem, check to make sure your television works. The service might be down. For a DSL 
connection, check to make sure your phone gives a dial tone. The phone lines might be down.
3. To eliminate the router as the source of the problem, connect one computer directly to the broadband 
modem. If you can access the Internet, you have proven the problem is with the router or cables going 
to it. Connect the router back into the network and check all the router settings. The problem might be

with DHCP, the firewall settings, or port forwarding. Try updating the firmware on the router. If you are 
convinced all settings on the router are correct, but the connection to your ISP works without the router 
and does not work with the router, it’s time to replace the router.
4. To eliminate DNS as the problem, follow these steps:
	 Try substituting a domain name for the IP address in a ping command:
	 ping www.cengage.com
	
If this ping works, then you can conclude that DNS works. If an IP address works, but the domain 
name does not work, the problem lies with DNS.
	 Try pinging your DNS server. To find out the IP address of your DNS server, use the nslookup command 
with no parameters or open the firmware utility of your router and look on a status screen.
5. If you’re having a problem accessing a particular computer on the Internet, try using the tracert command, 
for example:
tracert www.cengage.com
 
The results show computers along the route that might be giving delays.
6. If one computer on the network cannot access the Internet but other computers can, make sure MAC 
address filtering on the router is disabled or this computer is allowed access.
7. Perhaps the problem is with your router firewall or Windows Firewall. How to verify router firewall 
settings is covered in the chapter, “Connecting To and Setting Up a Network.” Windows Firewall is 
covered in the chapter, “Security Strategies.”
8. If you still cannot access the Internet, contact your ISP.
If some computers on the network have both local and Internet connectivity, but one computer does not, 
move on to checking problems on that computer, which can include TCP/IP settings and problems with 
applications.
Use TCP/IP Utilities to Solve Connectivity Problems
No connectivity or no Internet access can be caused by Windows TCP/IP configuration and connectivity. 
Follow these steps to verify that the local computer is communicating over the network:
1. Using the Network and Sharing Center or the ipconfig command, try to release the current IP address 
and lease a new address. This process solves the problem of an IP conflict with other computers on the 
network or your computer’s failure to connect to the network.
2. To find out if you have local connectivity, try to ping another computer on the network. To find out if 
you have Internet connectivity and DNS is working, try to ping a computer on the Internet using its host 
address. Try ping www.cengage.com. If this last command does not work, try the tracert command to 
find out if the problem is outside or inside your local network. Try tracert www.cengage.com.
3. In a command prompt window, enter ipconfig /all. Verify the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. 
For dynamic IP addressing, if the computer cannot reach the DHCP server, it assigns itself an APIPA, which 
is listed as an Autoconfiguration IPv4 Address that begins with 169.254 (refer back to Figure 15-50). In 
this case, suspect that the computer is not able to reach the network or the DHCP server is down.
4. Next, try the loopback address test. Enter the command ping 127.0.0.1 (with no period after the final 
1). Your computer should respond. If you get an error, assume the problem is TCP/IP settings on your 
computer. Compare the configuration with that of a working computer on the same network.
5. If you’re having a problem with slow transfer speeds, suspect a process is hogging network resources. Use the 
netstat –b command to find out if the program you want to use to access the network is actually running.

6. Firewall settings might be wrong. Are port forwarding settings on the router and in Windows Firewall 
set correctly? You learn to configure Windows Firewall in the chapter, “Security Strategies.”
7. Two computers on the network might have the same computer name. This command reports the error:
net view \\computername
8. If the net view command using a computer name does not work, try the command using the remote 
computer’s IP address, as in:
net view 192.168.1.102
 
If this command works, the problem is likely with name resolution. Make sure the computer name you 
are using is correct.
9. If you’re having problems getting a network drive map to work, try making the connection with the net 
use command like this:
net use z: \\computername\folder
 
To disconnect a mapped network drive, use this command:
net use z: /delete
Now we move on to problems with wireless connectivity.
No Wireless Connectivity
In a laptop, an internal wireless adapter uses an internal antenna, and the laptop might have a switch to 
turn on the internal wireless adapter or might use a key combination for that purpose. Look for the switch 
near the keyboard or on the side of the laptop (see Figure 15-54). Make sure the switch is set to the on 
position when you want to use wireless. The internal antenna might be embedded in the lid of the laptop. 
Raising the lid to a vertical position can sometimes improve the signal and solve a problem with intermittent 
connectivity.
Wireless

Following is a list of more things you can try. After each step, see if you can connect to the wireless 
network; if not, continue on to the next step.
1. Make sure you are within range of the wireless access point.
2. Click your wireless icon in the system tray. Turn the wireless connection off, wait a few seconds, 
then turn it back on.
3. Using the Network and Sharing Center, disable and then enable the wireless network adapter.
4. Reboot the computer.
5. Update the device drivers for the wireless card.
6. Replace the wireless card (see Figure 15-55). For instructions on how to replace the Mini PCIe wireless 
card, refer to the chapter, “Supporting I/O Devices.”

Wi-Fi Network Not Found
Recall that a wireless access point broadcasts an SSID. Your computer typically will easily find the SSID 
of a Wi-Fi network and connect after entering the security key, if one is needed. If your computer does not 
detect an SSID that you know should be available, it might be because the SSID is hidden. If you know the 
SSID name and the security key, you can still connect to the network by following these steps:
1. Open the Network and Sharing Center.
2. Click Set up a new connection or network.
3. Select Manually connect to a wireless network (see Figure 15-56), and click Next.

5. Your wireless network is set up and you should be connected. Click Close.
No Bluetooth Connectivity
If your laptop supports Bluetooth, read the documentation for configuring the Bluetooth connection that 
came with the laptop because Bluetooth setups differ from one laptop to another. Following the directions 
for your laptop, turn on Bluetooth. After Bluetooth is turned on, set your Bluetooth device near the laptop 
and it should pair up with it. Pairing up is the term used when the two devices begin to communicate and 
a passcode is requested to complete the connection.
If you are having problems getting the Bluetooth connection to work, try the following:
	 Make sure Bluetooth is turned on (for some laptops, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi wireless are controlled by a 
function key or a wireless switch).
	 Verify that Windows sees Bluetooth enabled. You might do this by using an applet in Control Panel, by 
using a program on the Windows 8 Start screen or Windows 7 Start menu, or by using the Bluetooth 
icon in the notification area of the desktop taskbar.
Notes Be aware that a laptop might show the Bluetooth icon in the taskbar even when the laptop does not support 
Bluetooth.
	 Be sure you have downloaded and installed all Windows updates.
	 Look in Device Manager to make sure the Bluetooth component is recognized with no errors. For some 
laptops, even though the component is an internal device, it is seen in Device Manager as a USB device.
	 Make sure the other device has Bluetooth turned on. For example, when trying to communicate with a 
smart phone, you must use the menu on the phone to activate Bluetooth connections. Windows should 
see the Bluetooth device when you click the Bluetooth icon in the taskbar and then click Add a Bluetooth 
Device, as shown in Figure 15-57a. You can also manage Bluetooth devices from the PC and devices page 
in Windows 8, as shown in Figure 15-57b.

	 Try uninstalling and reinstalling the Bluetooth drivers that come bundled with your laptop.
	 Try uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers for your Bluetooth device. For example, if you are trying 
to connect to a printer using a Bluetooth wireless connection, try first turning on Bluetooth and then 
uninstalling and reinstalling the printer. During the printer installation, select the Bluetooth connection 
for the printer port, which might be called Bluetooth COM or something similar.
For more ideas for solving a Bluetooth problem, try the website of the laptop manufacturer or the website 
of the device you are trying to connect to your laptop using Bluetooth.

GPS Not Functioning
A Global Positioning System (GPS) allows your laptop to be used as a navigation device with mapping 
software. The advantages to using your laptop as a GPS device instead of a compact GPS device, like 
Garmin or TomTom, is a larger screen, more detailed routing, and better routing analysis. A GPS receiver 
connects to your laptop using a USB port. If your GPS is not working, try the following:
	 Sometimes the GPS receiver does not work well when plugged directly in to the USB port on a laptop. 
Instead, try using a short USB extension cable that is usually included with the GPS receiver. This gives 
the GPS receiver some distance from your laptop so there is less interference caused by the laptop.
	 Because a GPS uses satellites, a clear view of the sky is necessary for the GPS receiver to lock signal with 
the satellite. Make sure you are positioned so that the receiver is able to “see” a clear sky. Buildings, 
mountains, and trees can all be blocks.
Use a Port Scanner
Port scanning software can be used to find out how vulnerable a computer is with open ports. 
This project requires the use of two computers on the same network to practice using port scanning 
software. Do the following:
1.	 On Computer 1, download and install Advanced Port Scanner by Famatech at http://www.advanced-port-
scanner.com. (Be careful to not accept other software offered while downloading.)
2.	 On Computer 2, set the network location to Public network. (For Windows 8, open the Settings charms, click 
the Network icon, click View Connection Settings, click Connections, select the network connection, and 
turn off Find devices and content. For Windows 7, open the Network and Sharing Center and click the 
network location to change it.)
3.	 On Computer 1, start Advanced Port Scanner and make sure that the range of IP addresses includes the IP 
address of Computer 2. Change the default port list to 0 through 6000. Then click Scan.
4.	 Browse the list and find Computer 2. List the number and purpose of all open ports found on Computer 2.
5.	 On Computer 2, set the network location to Private for Windows 8 and Home for Windows 7. Open the 
System window, click Remote settings, and allow Remote Assistance connections to this computer. Close 
all windows.
6.	 On Computer 1, rescan and list the number and purpose of each port now open on Computer 2. Figure 15-58 
shows the results for one computer, but yours might be different.

Types of Networks and the Internet Connections They Use
	 Networks are categorized by size as a PAN, LAN, Wireless LAN, MAN, or WAN.
	 Performance of a network technology is measured in bandwidth and latency.
	 The two most popular ways to connect to the Internet are cable Internet and DSL. Other methods 
used include satellite, dedicated fiber optic, dial-up, and cellular wireless technologies (2G, 3G, 4G,  
and/or LTE).
Hardware Used by Local Networks
	 Networking hardware used on local networks can include dial-up modems, hubs, switches, routers, 
wireless access points, bridges, cables, and connectors.
	 The most popular Ethernet cable is twisted pair using an RJ-45 connector. Phone lines use an RJ-11 
connector.
	 Switches and older hubs are used as a centralized connection for devices on a wired network. A bridge 
stands between two network segments and controls traffic between them.
	 Most wired local networks use twisted-pair cabling that can be unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cable 
or shielded twisted-pair (STP) cable. UTP is rated by category: CAT-3, CAT-5, CAT-5e, CAT-6, CAT-6a, 
and CAT-7. CAT-6e is an unofficial name for CAT-6a.

Key Terms
	 Fiber-optic cables can use one of four connectors: ST, SC, LC, or MT-RJ. Any one of the four connectors 
can be used with single-mode or multimode fiber-optic cable.
	 Powerline networking, also called Ethernet over Power (EoP), sends Ethernet transmissions over the 
power lines of a building or house. Power over Ethernet (PoE) sends power over Ethernet cables.
Setting Up and Troubleshooting Network Wiring
	 Tools used to manage and troubleshoot network wiring and connectors are a loopback plug, cable tester, 
multimeter, toner probe, wire stripper, crimper, and punchdown tool.
	 The RJ-45 connector has eight pins. Four pins (pins 1, 2, 3, and 6) are used to transmit and send data 
using the 10BaseT and 100BaseT speeds. Using 1000BaseT speed, all eight pins are used for transmissions.
	 Two standards used to wire network cables are T568A and T568B. The difference between the T568A 
and T568B standards is the orange twisted-pair wires are reversed in the RJ-45 connector from the 
green twisted-pair wires.
	 A straight-through cable uses the T568A or T568B standard on both connectors. A crossover cable for 
10BaseT or 100BaseT uses T568A for one connector and T568B for the other connector. Crossover 
cables are generally not used on Gigabit Ethernet networks.
	 Either T568A or T568B can be used to wire a network. To avoid confusion, don’t mix the two standards 
in a building.
	 Use wire strippers, wire cutters, and a crimper to make network cables. A punchdown tool is used to 
terminate cables in a patch panel or keystone RJ-45 jack. Be sure to use a cable tester to test or certify 
a cable you have just made.
	 When troubleshooting network wiring, tools that can help are status indicator lights, loopback plugs, 
cable testers, Wi-Fi analyzers, toner probes, and network multimeters.
	 Useful Windows TCP/IP utilities for network troubleshooting are ping, ipconfig, nslookup, tracert, net 
use, net user, net localgroup, nbtstat, netstat, and netdom. The Linux ifconfig command is similar to the 
Windows ipconfig command.
	 When troubleshooting network problems, check hardware, device drivers, Windows, and the client 
or server application, in that order.

>> Thinking Critically
1.		 Linda has been assigned the job of connecting five computers to a network. The room holding the five 
computers has three network jacks that connect to a switch in an electrical closet down the hallway. 
Linda decides to install a second switch in the room. The new switch has four network ports. She uses 
one port to connect the switch to a wall jack. Now she has five ports available (two wall jacks and 
three switch ports). While installing and configuring the NICs in the five computers, she discovers that 
the PCs connected to the two wall jacks work fine, but the three connected to the switch refuse to 
communicate with the network. What could be wrong and what should she try next?
2.		 If a Gigabit Ethernet NIC is having a problem communicating with a 100BaseT switch that only 
supports half duplex, what steps can you take to manually set the NIC to the speed and duplex used 
by the switch? Which speed and duplex should you choose?
3.		 You connect a computer to an RJ-45 wall jack using a straight-through cable. When you first open the 
browser on the computer, you discover it does not have Internet access. Put the following steps in the 
correct order to troubleshoot the problem:
a.	Use a loopback plug to verify the network port on the computer.
b.	Rewire the keystone RJ-45 wall jack.
c.	 Use a loopback plug to verify the network port in the wall jack.
d.	Exchange the straight-through cable for a known good one.
e.	Verify the status indicator lights on the NIC.
f.	 Use a cable tester to test the network cable and termination from the switch in the electrical closet 
to the wall jack.

>> Real Problems, Real Solutions
Real Problem 15-1 Setting Up a Wireless Access Point
As a computer and networking consultant to small businesses, you are frequently asked to find solutions to 
increasing demands for network and Internet access at a business. One business rents offices in a historical 
building that has strict rules for wiring. They have come to you asking for a solution for providing Wi-Fi 
access to their guests in the lobby of the building. Research options for a solution and answer the following 
questions:
1.		 Print or save webpages showing two options for a Wi-Fi wireless access point that can mount on the 
wall or ceiling. For one option, select a device that can receive its power by PoE from the network cable 
run to the device. For the other option, select a device that requires an electrical cable to the device as 
well as a network cable.
2.		 Print or save two webpages for a splitter that can be mounted near the second wireless access point 
that splits the power from data on the network cable. Make sure the power connectors for the splitter 
and the access point can work together.
3.		 To provide PoE from the electrical closet on the network cable to the wireless access point, print or 
save the webpage for an injector that injects power into a network cable. Make sure the voltage and 
wattage output for the injector are compatible with the needs of both wireless access points.
4.		 You estimate the distance for network cabling from the switch to the wireless access point is about 
200 feet (61 meters). What is the cost of 200 feet of PVC CAT-6a cabling? For 200 feet of plenum 
CAT-6a cabling? For 200 feet of plenum CAT-7 cabling?
5.		 Of the options you researched, which option do you recommend? Using this option, what is the total 
cost of the Wi-Fi hotspot?

P
revious chapters have focused on supporting personal computers. 
This chapter deviates from this topic as we discuss operating 
systems on mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets. As mobile 
devices become more common, many people use them to surf the web, 
access email, and manage apps and data. As an IT support technician, 
you need to know about the operating systems and hardware used 
with mobile devices and how to help a user configure and troubleshoot 
these devices.
Because many employees expect to be able to use their mobile 
devices to access, synchronize, and edit data on the corporate 
network, data, settings, and apps stored on mobile devices need to be 
secured and synchronized to other storage locations. In this chapter, 
you learn how you can synchronize content on mobile devices to a 
personal computer or to storage in the cloud (on the Internet). Finally, 
in this chapter, you learn about tools and resources available for 
troubleshooting mobile operating systems.

Android by the Open Handset Alliance and Google
The Android operating system is based on the Linux OS and uses a Linux kernel. Linux and 
Android are open source, which means the source code for the operating system is available for 
free and anyone can modify and redistribute the source code. Open source software is typically 
developed as a community effort by many contributors. Android was originally developed by 
the Open Handset Alliance (www.openhandsetalliance.com), which is made up of many technology and 
mobile phone companies and led by Google, Inc.
In 2005, Google acquired this source code. Google does not own Android, but it has assumed a 
leadership role in development, quality control, and distributions of the Android OS and Android apps. 
Ongoing development of the Android OS code by Google and other contributors is released to the public 
as open source code.

	 Android OS by Google (android.com) is based on Linux and is used on various smart 
phones and tablets. Currently, Android is the most popular OS for smart phones. Nearly 
80 percent of the smart phones sold today use Android. Combining both smart phones and tablets, 
Android holds about 50 percent of the market.
	 iOS by Apple (apple.com) is based on Mac OS X and is currently used on the iPhone, iPad, and iPod 
touch by Apple. Almost 20 percent of smart phones sold today are made by Apple and use iOS. About 
40 percent of smart phones and tablets combined use iOS.
	 Windows Phone (WP) by Microsoft (microsoft.com) is based on Windows and is used on various 
smart phones (not on tablets). Less than 3 percent of smart phones sold today use Windows Phone. 
(Windows tablets use the 32-bit version of the same Windows operating system used on desktop 
and laptop systems.)
The remaining market share for smart phones and tablets in the United States is shared by these 
mobile OSs:
	 Java Micro Edition (ME) by Oracle (oracle.com) provides a basic platform for everything from smart 
phones to TV set-top boxes to printers. Most of these devices have limited computing power, and Java 
ME enables Java applications to run on these devices.
	 The Symbian OS from the Symbian Foundation (symbian.org) is popular outside the United States and 
is used on devices made by multiple manufacturers, including Nokia, Samsung, Sony, and others.
	 BlackBerry OS by BlackBerry Limited (blackberry.com) is a proprietary OS used on devices built by 
BlackBerry.
	 Kindle Fire by Amazon (amazon.com) runs the Fire OS, which is based on Android and is deeply 
customized to meet the needs of Amazon’s e-reader audience.
This chapter focuses on the Android, iOS, and Windows Phone operating systems used on smart phones 
and/or tablets.

Getting to Know an Android Device
Releases of Android are named after desserts and include Froyo (frozen yogurt; version 2.2.x), 
Gingerbread (version 2.3.x), Honeycomb (version 3.x), Ice Cream Sandwich (version 4.0.x), Jelly Bean 
(version 4.1-4.3.x), KitKat (version 4.4+), and Lollipop (version 5.0-5.1.1). (Future releases of Android 
will follow in alphabetic order: M, N, O, and P.) At the time of this writing, most new phones and tablets 
ship with KitKat or Lollipop installed.

Android’s launcher, or graphical user interface (GUI), starts with multiple home screens and supports 
windows, panes, and 3D graphics. The Android OS can use an embedded browser, manage a database using 
SQLite, and connect to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks. Most current Android mobile devices have 
no physical buttons on the front of the device. However, the user can configure up to five custom software 
buttons, called Home touch buttons, on the Action bar at the bottom of the screen, with the three default 
buttons typically being back, home, and overview (see Figure 16-1).
On Android phones, up to seven apps or groups of apps can be pinned to the Favorites tray just above the 
Action bar. The pinned apps shown in Figure 16-1 are the Dialer (for making phone calls), Contacts, the Apps 
Drawer (lists and manages all your apps), Android’s native Messaging app, and Google Chrome (web browser). 
Apps in the Favorites tray stay put as you move from home screen to home screen by swiping left or right. All 
but the Apps Drawer can be replaced by third-party apps.
Notifications provide alerts and related information about apps and social media. Notifications are 
accessed by swiping down from the top of the screen, as shown in Figure 16-2a. The Notifications shade 
provides access to the Quick Settings menu, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Volume, and Brightness. Tap the 
Settings (cog) icon in the upper-right corner to open the Settings app (see Figure 16-2b), or tap the back 
button in the Action bar to return to the home screen.
Notes Google has announced that Marshmallow is the next release of Android and will be released by the time this 
text is in print.

Android Apps
Android apps are sold or freely distributed from any source or vendor. However, the official source for 
apps, called the Android marketplace, is Google Play at play.google.com. To download content, you need a 
Google account, which you can set up using the website or your device. The account is associated with any 
valid email address. Associate a credit card with the account to make your purchases at Google Play. Then 
you can download free or purchased music, e-books, movies, and Android apps from Google Play to your 
mobile device.
To download an app, tap the Play Store app on the home screen of your device. (If you don’t see the 
app icon on your home screen, tap the Apps Drawer and then tap Play Store.) The app takes you to Google 
Play, where you can search for apps, games, movies, music, e-books, and magazines (see Figure 16-3a). 
In addition, you can get apps and data from other sources, such as the Amazon Appstore for Android 
at amazon.com or directly from a developer. You can also use the Play Store app to manage updates to 
installed apps, as shown in Figure 16-3b.

Google maintains the Android website at android.com where an app developer can download Android 
Studio, which includes Android SDK tools and an Android emulator, from developer.android.com. An SDK 
(Software Development Kit) is a group of tools that developers use to write apps. Android Studio is free 
and is released as open source. Most Android apps are written using the Java programming language. All 
the parts of an app are published as a package of files wrapped into one file with an .apk file extension 
using the APK (Android Application Package) package file format.
Now let’s see how Apple’s iOS differs from Android.
iOS by Apple
Apple, Inc. (www.apple.com) owns, manufactures, and sells the Apple iPhone (a smart phone), 
iPad (a handheld tablet), and iPod touch (a multimedia recorder and player and a game 
player). These devices all use the iOS operating system, also developed and owned by Apple. 
iOS is based on Mac OS X, the operating system used by Apple desktop and laptop computers. 
There have been eight major releases of the iOS with a ninth released in beta at the time of this writing; the 
latest full version is iOS version 8.

Getting to Know an iOS Device
Because Apple is the sole owner and distributor of iOS, the only devices that use it are Apple devices 
(currently the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch). Figure 16-4 shows an iPad, an iPad mini, and an iPhone 6 
Plus (the iPhone 6 Plus is larger than the iPhone 6). Each device has a physical Wake/sleep button at the 
top of the device and a Home button on the bottom front. Apps pinned to the bottom of the iPhone screen 
in Figure 16-4 are the Phone, Mail, Safari browser, and Music apps. (The Music app is also called the iPod 
app.) Apps pinned to the bottom of the iPad screens that show in the figure are the Safari browser, Mail, 
and Videos apps.
Also, because Apple is the sole developer and manufacturer, it can maintain strict standards on its 
products, which means iOS is extremely stable and bug free. Apple’s iOS is also a very easy and intuitive 
operating system to use. As with Mac OS X, iOS makes heavy use of icons.
Knowing a few simple navigation tips on an iOS device can help you get around a little more easily:
	 Swipe down from the top of the screen to see the Notifications screen. Slide a notification, such as an 
iMessage, up to remove it and slide it down to access options for responding to it, such as replying to an 
iMessage. The types of notifications shown and other notification settings can be customized in the Settings 
app. For example, on an iPhone you can turn on or off government alerts such as AMBER alerts and other 
emergency notifications.

OS Differences You can adjust settings for emergency notifications in Android, too, but the steps to accomplish 
this task vary by device. Many Android devices offer these options in the Settings menu of the default Messaging app. 
Look for an option such as Emergency alerts. On other devices, on the Settings app tap More, then tap Cell broadcasts.

	 To delete or move an app icon on the screen, press and hold the icon until all icons start to jiggle. As the 
icons jiggle, to delete an icon, press the X beside it. To move an icon, press and drag it to a new location. 
You can add new home screens by dragging an app icon off the screen to the right. To stop the jiggling, 
tap the Home button.
	 Double-click the Home button to show the app switcher. Tap an app to switch to that screen, or swipe 
an app to the top of the screen to close it. Closing apps you’re not using can save battery life.
	 Press and hold the Home button to open Siri, iOS’s virtual assistant service. A virtual assistant service or 
app, also called a personal assistant, responds to a user’s voice commands with a personable, conversational 
interaction to perform tasks and retrieve information. iOS’s Siri, as shown in Figure 16-5a, was the first of 
these virtual assistant services (Siri is more of a service than an app because of how deeply embedded it is 
within iOS), and has been around long enough to have become quite sophisticated. Siri uses information 
within the device to provide a customized experience.

web interface in addition to the installed app on the mobile device, and uses search histories and information collected 
during setup or later to customize a user’s experience. Windows Phone 8.1 has a virtual assistant called Cortana that also 
customizes the user’s experience.

iOS Apps
You can get Android apps from many sources, but the only place to go for an iOS app is Apple. Apple 
is the sole distributer of iOS apps at its App Store. Other developers can write apps for the iPhone, 
iPad, or iPod, but these apps must be sent to Apple for their close scrutiny. If they pass muster, they are 
distributed by Apple on its website. One requirement is that an app be written in the Objective-C, C, 
or C++ programming language. Apple offers app development tools, including the iOS SDK (Software 
Development Kit) at developer.apple.com.
When you first purchase an iPad or an iPod touch, you activate it by signing into the device with an 
Apple ID, or user account, using a valid email address and password, and associate this account with a 
credit card number. You can then go to the Settings app to download the latest updates to the iOS. Here 
are options for obtaining apps and other content:
	 Use the App Store app on your mobile device (see Figure 16-6 for an iPad example) to search, purchase, 
and download (or download for free) apps, games, e-books, periodical content such as newspapers and 
magazines, and iTunes U content. (iTunes U contains lectures and even complete courses from many 
schools, colleges, and universities.)
Figure 16-6  Use the App Store app to download content from the iTunes Store
Source: Apple iOS
	 Use the iTunes Store app to search, purchase, and download (or download for free) content, including 
music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, and iTunes U content. Download and install the iTunes software on 
a Mac or Windows personal computer. Then connect your mobile device to the computer by way of a 
USB port. iTunes can then sync the device to iOS updates downloaded from iTunes.com and to content 
on your computer, which can be a helpful troubleshooting option, as you’ll see later. You can also pur-
chase content that is downloaded to your device by way of iTunes on your computer. Figure 16-7 shows 
the iTunes window when an iPhone is connected to the computer. How to use iTunes to sync data and 
apps on your device is covered later in the chapter.

Recall that apps can be downloaded to an iOS device only from Apple. People have discovered that it 
is possible to break through this restriction in a process called jailbreaking. Jailbreaking gives you root 
or administrative privileges to the operating system and the entire file system (all files and folders) and 
complete access to all commands and features. Jailbreaking was once illegal, but in 2010, the U.S. Copyright 
Office and the Library of Congress made a copyright ruling that a user has the right to download and 
use software that will jailbreak his or her iPhone. Note, however, that this ruling applies only to iPhones 
(and other smart phones), not iPads (or other tablets), due to some ambiguity in the definition of the word 
tablet. Also, jailbreaking voids any manufacturer warranty on the device, violates the End User License 
Agreement (EULA) with Apple, and might violate BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies in an enterprise 
environment. This jailingbreaking ruling applies only in the United States; other countries have addressed 
this issue differently.
Android and iOS hold the lion’s share of the mobile operating system market. However, Microsoft offers 
some valid competition with its latest Windows  mobile OS developments.

The Windows Phone operating system by Microsoft is more or less a simplified version of the 
Windows operating system designed for desktop computers, laptops, and tablets. Windows Phone 
and Windows version numbers correspond: Windows Phone 8.1 corresponds to Windows 8.1. 
One of the biggest differences between Windows and Windows Phone is that Windows Phone 
does not have a desktop screen. Everything is accessed initially from the Start screen. As of the writing of this 
text, Microsoft has released its preview version of Windows 10 Mobile.

Getting to Know a Windows Phone Mobile Device
Most Windows phones have three buttons below the screen (see Figure 16-8). These buttons might be physical 
buttons or software buttons. The Start button accesses the Start screen; the Back button goes back one screen, 
and the Search button opens a Bing or Cortana Search box. Also, if you press and hold the Back button, it 
displays recent apps. For most phones, these buttons aren’t true software buttons, but they’re also not true 
physical buttons, because they might not work when the OS is malfunctioning.
Windows phones rely primarily on the Start screen for accessing apps. Just as with Windows 8, a tile 
icon on the Start screen represents an app. Here are some tips for getting around Windows Phone:
	 Tap a tile on the Start screen to open its app. Scroll up or down to see more tiles. Press and hold to 
resize or reposition tiles. On many smart phones, pressing and holding a link functions like right-clicking 
with a mouse on a Windows desktop computer.

Windows Phone Apps
The availability of apps for Windows mobile devices is much more limited than what can be found for 
Android or iOS. Windows apps are obtained through the Microsoft Store (microsoftstore.com). The number 
of apps for Windows smart phones should increase soon, as Microsoft has announced that Windows 10 
Mobile will be more compatible with both Android and iOS apps. This means app developers will more 
easily be able to adapt their existing apps for posting in the Microsoft Store. Additionally, like Android 
apps, Windows Phone apps can be obtained from third-party websites.

Comparing OPEN SOURCE AND CLOSED SOURCE Operating Systems
Open source operating systems (such as Android) and closed source, also called vendor-
specific or commercial license, operating systems (such as iOS) have their advantages 
and disadvantages. Here are some key points to consider about releasing or not releasing 
source code:
	 Apple carefully guards its iOS source code and internal functions of the OS. Third-party developers of 
apps have access only to APIs, which are calls to the OS. An app must be tested and approved by Apple 
before it can be sold in its online App Store. These policies assure users that apps are high quality. It also 
assures developers they have a central point of contact for users to buy their apps.
	 The Android source code and the development and sale of apps are not closely guarded. Apps can be 
purchased or downloaded from Google Play, but they can also be obtained from other sources such as 
Amazon.com or directly from a developer. This freedom comes with a cost because users are not always 
assured of high-quality, bug-free apps, and developers are not always assured of a convenient market 
for their apps.
	 Because any smart phone or tablet manufacturer can modify the Android source code, many variations 
of Android exist. These variations can make it difficult for developers to write apps that port to any 
Android platform. It can also make it difficult for users to learn to use new Android devices because 
of these inconsistencies.

Configure, Sync, and Troubleshoot iOS Devices
In this part of the chapter, you learn to configure network connections, and to update, secure, 
and back up data, content, and settings on an iOS device. Later in the chapter, you learn similar 
skills using Android and Windows devices. We begin with iOS because it’s so easy to use and 
understand.
This chapter is intended to show you how to support a device that you might not own or normally use. 
Technicians are often expected to do such things! If you don’t have an iPhone or iPad to use as you read 
through these sections, you can still follow along, paying careful attention to the screen shots taken on each 
device. Learning to use an iOS device is fun, and supporting one is equally easy.
Most of the settings you need to know to support an iOS device are contained in the Settings app, which 
you can find on the home screen (see Figure 16-11a). Basically, you can tap the Settings app and search 
through its menus and submenus until you find what you need. So let’s get started.

Configure iOS Network Connections
An iOS mobile device can contain up to four antennas (Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, and cellular). 
The device uses a Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular antenna to connect to each type of network, 
and settings on the device allow you to enable or disable each antenna. Let’s look at each type 
of connection.

Cellular Connection
Recall that a cellular network provided by a carrier (for example, AT&T or Verizon) is used for voice, text, 
and data communication. A cellular network uses GSM or CDMA for voice and another layer of technology 
for data transmissions. Options are 2G, EDGE (an earlier version of 3G), 3G, 4G, and 4G LTE. GSM and LTE 
require a SIM card installed in the device, and CDMA does not use a SIM card. (Although a CDMA and LTE 
carrier does require the SIM card for the LTE technology to work.) To make a cellular data connection, you 
must have a subscription with your carrier that includes a cellular data plan and then connect your device.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know how to configure Wi-Fi, cellular data, Bluetooth, and 
VPN connections using the iOS, Android, and Windows mobile operating systems.
Notes You can disable the three antennas in a mobile device that can transmit signals by enabling Airplane mode so 
that the device can neither transmit nor receive signals. To use Airplane mode, tap the Settings app and turn Airplane Mode 
on or off (see Figure 16-11b). It’s not necessary to disable the GPS antenna because it only receives and never transmits.

Here is information that might be used when a connection is first made to the network:
	 The IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) is a unique number that identifies each mobile 
phone or tablet device worldwide. It’s usually reported within the About menu in the OS, and it might 
also be printed on a sticker on the device, such as behind the battery.
	 The IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) is a unique number that identifies a cellular sub-
scription for a device or subscriber, along with its home country and mobile network. This number is 
stored on the SIM card for networks that use SIM cards. For networks that don’t use SIM cards, the 
number is kept in a database maintained by the carrier and is associated with the IMEI.
	 The ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card ID) identifies the SIM card if the card is used. To know if a device 
is using a SIM card, look in the Settings app on the About menu in the General group. An ICCID entry 
indicates a SIM card is present.
When a carrier uses a SIM card, you can move the card 
from one device to another and the new device can connect 
to the carrier’s network. When a carrier does not use a SIM 
card, you must contact the carrier and request permission 
to switch devices. If the carrier accepts the new device, the 
new IMEI will be entered in the carrier’s database.
To connect an iOS device to a cellular data network, tap 
Settings, Cellular Data, then Set Up Cellular Data. Select a 
carrier (see Figure 16-12a) and follow the on screen instruc-
tions. Also you can enable or disable Data Roaming and 
Cellular Data. Using data roaming might mean additional 
charges if you are in a different country, and disabling cel-
lular data might save on carrier charges in certain situations.

Notes The advantage of disabling cellular 
data and using Wi-Fi for data transmissions is 
that data transmissions over Wi-Fi are not charged 
against your cellular data subscription plan. 
Also, Wi-Fi is generally faster than most cellular 
connections.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects 
you to know how to identify and distinguish 
between the IMEI and the IMSI.

CDMA carriers are likely to require that a cellular device have a Removable User Identity Module 
(R-UIM), which is a small card similar to a SIM card. The card contains a database file called the PRL 
(Preferred Roaming List), which lists the preferred service providers or radio frequencies your carrier wants 
the device to use. You can reset or update the 
list in the Settings app. For example, for an 
iPad, tap Settings, General, then scroll down 
and tap Reset. Tap Subscriber Services, then 
tap Reprovision Account and tap OK. Tap OK 
again when the update is complete.
Bluetooth Connection
To configure an iOS Bluetooth connection, first turn on the other Bluetooth device you want to connect to. 
Then on your mobile device, tap Settings and turn on Bluetooth. The device searches for other Bluetooth 
devices. If it discovers a Bluetooth device, tap it to connect. The two Bluetooth devices now begin the 
pairing process. The devices might require a Bluetooth PIN code to complete the Bluetooth connection. 
For example, in Figure 16-12b, an iPad and Bluetooth keyboard are pairing. To complete the connection, 
enter the four-digit PIN on the keyboard. To test the connection, enter text on the keyboard and make sure 
the text appears on the iPad screen in the active app.
If you have a problem connecting to a Bluetooth device, try turning that device off and back on. The 
device might also offer a pairing button or combination of buttons to enable pairing. When you press this 
button, a pairing light blinks, indicating the device is ready to receive a Bluetooth connection.
Wi-Fi Connection
To configure an iOS Wi-Fi connection, tap Settings, Wi-Fi. On the Wi-Fi screen (Figure 16-13a), you can 
view available Wi-Fi hotspots, see which Wi-Fi network you are connected to, turn Wi-Fi off and on, and 
decide whether the device needs to ask before joining a Wi-Fi network. A Wi-Fi hotspot is an area where 
access to Wi-Fi Internet connectivity is made available, such as at a coffee shop, retail store, or airport.

When the device is within range of a Wi-Fi network, it displays the list of networks. Select one to connect. 
If the Wi-Fi network is secured, enter the security key to complete the connection. To change a network’s 
settings, tap the name of the network (see Figure 16-13b).
VPN Connection
Like desktop computers, a mobile device can be configured to communicate information securely over a 
virtual private network (VPN) connection. To create a VPN connection in iOS, tap Settings, General, then 
scroll down and tap VPN. Tap Add VPN Configuration. Follow directions to complete the connection, 
which will require you know the type of encryption protocol used (L2TP, PPTP, or IPsec), the IP address or 
domain name of the VPN server, and the user name and password to the corporate network.
Configure iOS Email
Using a personal computer or mobile device, email can be managed in one of two ways:
A+  
220-902 
2.6, 2.7
	 Use a browser. Using a browser, go to the website of your email provider and manage your 
email on the website. In this situation, your email is never downloaded to your computer or 
mobile device, and your messages remain on the email server until you delete them.
	 Use an email client. An email client, such as Microsoft Outlook, can be installed on your personal 
computer, and/or you can use an email app on your mobile device. The client or app can either 
download email messages to your device (using the POP3 protocol) or can manage email on the server 
(using the IMAP protocol). When the client or app downloads the email, you can configure the server 
to continue to store the email on the server for later use or delete the email from the server. The built-in 
Mail app for managing email is available on iPhones and iPads.
Here is the information you’ll need to configure the Mail app on an iOS device:
	 Your email address and password. If your email account is with iCloud, Microsoft Exchange, Google, 
Yahoo!, AOL, or Outlook, your email address and password are all you need because the iOS can 
automatically set up these accounts.
	 The names of your incoming and outgoing email servers. To find this information, check the support 
page of your email provider’s website. For example, the server you use for incoming mail might be  
pop.mycompany.com, and the server you use for outgoing mail might be smtp.mycompany.com.  
The two servers might have the same name.
	 The type of protocol your incoming server uses. The incoming server will use POP3 or IMAP. Using 
IMAP, you are managing your email on the server. For example, you can move a message from 
one folder to another and that change happens on the remote server. Using POP3, the messages are 
downloaded to your device where you manage them locally. Using POP3, the Mail app leaves the 
messages on the server (does not delete them), but you can change this setting if you want.
	 Security used. Most likely, if email is encrypted during transmission using the SSL protocol, the 
configuration will happen automatically without your involvement. However, if you have problems, 
you need to be aware of these possible settings:
	 An IMAP server uses port 143 unless it is secured and using SSL. IMAP over SSL (IMAPS) 
uses port 993.
	 A POP3 server uses port 110 unless it is secured and using SSL. POP3 over SSL uses port 995.
	 Outgoing email is normally sent using the protocol SMTP. A more secure alternative called S/MIME 
(Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is now available, however. S/MIME encrypts the 
email message and includes a digital signature, which validates the identity of the sender of the 
email message. This feature is enabled after the email account is set up on the device. The activation 
process is automated for accounts through Microsoft Exchange, and can be set up manually for 
other types of accounts. Look for this option on the Advanced settings screen, which you’ll soon 
see how to access.

However, sometimes the Mail app chooses the wrong default settings (such as assuming POP3 when you want 
IMAP). To force the Mail app to allow manual selection of these settings, first enter a bogus email address or 
password. The account connection will fail, and the screen in Figure 16-14b will appear. Tap IMAP or POP and

You need to know about an exception in how email is managed when using a Gmail account. Gmail is 
an email service provided by Google at mail.google.com. Normally, when you use the Mail app, you can 
delete a message by selecting it and tapping Delete (see Figure 16-17a). However, using Gmail, by default, 
you archive a message rather than delete it (see Figure 16-17b).
Using most email services, a message arrives in your Inbox, which is a folder on the email server. You 
organize these messages by moving them to other folders or deleting them. Deleted messages are placed 
in the Trash folder and permanently deleted after a period of time. Using Gmail, a message remains in the 
Inbox, and you organize these messages by assigning each message one or more labels. When you archive 
a message, you move the message from the Inbox to the All Mail folder out of sight but still accessible. 
Therefore, when using the Mail app on an Apple device with a Gmail account, the Delete button is 
replaced with the Archive button.
To change the Gmail account so that you can delete messages, go to the home screen and tap Settings 
and then tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars. Tap the Gmail account and go into Advanced settings. On the 
Advanced screen (refer to Figure 16-16b) under Move discarded messages into, tap to select Deleted 
Mailbox. Return to the Account screen and tap Done. The Mail app will now have a Delete button 
for Gmail, as shown in Figure 16-17a.

Microsoft Exchange is a server application that is popular with large corporations for handling employee 
email, contacts, and calendars. When you set up a Microsoft Exchange email account, the Mail app 
automatically enables ActiveSync, which causes all email, contacts, and calendar updates made on the 
Exchange server or on your mobile device to stay in sync. Any changes at either location are automatically 
and immediately transmitted to the other. You can change the ActiveSync settings by doing the following:
1. On the home screen, tap Settings, and tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars.
2. Select your Exchange email account. On the account screen, you can turn on or off the Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars, Reminders, and Notes settings. You can set the number of days, weeks, or months of email 
you want to stay in sync. You can also set up automatic out-of-office replies, and decide whether you 
want folders in addition to the Inbox folder to be pushed to you from the Exchange server.

Sync, Back Up, and Restore from Backup in iOS
For Apple devices, you can use iCloud or iTunes to sync, back up, and restore content on your 
device. iCloud backs up to storage on the Apple website at www.icloud.com, and iTunes backs 
up to your computer. Syncing and backing up are not the same thing. When you sync a computer 
to your device, the data and apps you purchased and/or downloaded to your computer are 
transferred to your device. In addition, you can transfer content purchased on your device to your computer.

The advantages of backing up to iCloud are your devices automatically back up to iCloud whenever 
your device is connected to Wi-Fi and Apple is responsible for protecting your backups. The advantages of 
backing up to iTunes are you have more control over your backups and the cost for storage is less; how-
ever, you are responsible for maintaining your backups on your computer. Next, let’s see how to sync and 
back up your content using iCloud and iTunes.
Use iCloud Drive to Sync Content
Your Apple ID gives you a free iCloud account at icloud.com that can hold your iCloud Backup, iCloud 
Drive, iCloud Photo Library, iCloud Mail (using your @icloud.com email addresss), and data from apps 
that can interface with iCloud. The first 5 GB of storage is free. Music, apps, books, TV shows, and My 
Photo Stream you purchase from the Apple Store don’t count against your 5 GB of storage.
You can sync files stored on iCloud Drive with any Apple mobile device or personal computer, and, 
when the iCloud Drive software is installed, you can sync content with a Windows computer. When 
you turn on iCloud Drive on an Apple device, content stored on your iCloud Drive is automatically 
synced with your device. To turn on iCloud Drive, open the Settings app, tap iCloud, and verify iCloud 
Drive is turned on. Now, any app on your device that can interact with iCloud Drive can use content 
at iCloud Drive.

1.	 To use the app to create a new document file, open the app, tap iCloud in the left pane to select 
the location where the file will be saved, then tap the “+” sign at the bottom of the screen. Select the type of 
document to create, as shown in Figure 16-19a.
2.	 After you’re finished creating the document, to save it, tap File in the upper-left corner of the app and 
tap Save (to use the app’s default name for the file) or Save As (to rename the file). To return to your 
Documents list, tap File and tap Don’t Save. The file is now available inside the app’s own folder in iCloud 
Drive at icloud.com and also on any device or computer that syncs with your iCloud Drive account.
	In Windows 8 on a personal computer, iCloud Drive is listed under Favorites in File Explorer, and there you 
can find the document file uploaded from your iPad, as shown in Figure 16-19b. (The app saves two copies of 
each file, one is an .rtf, or rich text format, file associated by default with Word, and one is a .txt, or text, file 
associated by default with WordPad.)
3.	 To download a document from iCloud Drive to the Documents Free app, on the Documents list screen, tap the 
menu icon in the upper-left corner. In the menu list that appears on the left side of the screen (see Figure 
16-19a), tap iCloud Drive. You can then drill down into folders on your iCloud Drive and tap a file you want to 
download. The file can then be viewed and edited in the app.

Use iCloud Backup to Back up Content
To use iCloud Backup to back up your content to the cloud, follow these steps:
1. iCloud Backup requires iOS 5 or higher. To verify your Apple device is updated to iOS 5 or higher, tap 
Settings, General, About (see Figure 16-20a for an iPad screen).
2. To turn on iCloud Backup, tap Settings, then iCloud. Tap Backup and make sure iCloud Backup is 
turned on (see Figure 16-20b).
3. Select the items you want to back up (see Figure 16-21a), such as Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, 
Safari bookmarks, and so forth. Note that iCloud does not back up content already stored in the cloud, 
including apps, movies, podcasts, audio books, or data stored on your iCloud Drive. It also does not 
back up content you did not obtain from the iTunes Store, such as imported MP3s, videos, or CDs. 
To monitor your storage, tap Storage. The Storage pane is shown in Figure 16-21b.

4. iCloud Backup normally backs up whenever your device is connected to Wi-Fi. To back up manually to 
iCloud at any time, on the Backup screen shown in Figure 16-20b, you can tap Back Up Now.
If you need to restore your data from iCloud Backup to your current device or to a new Apple device, 
here are your options:
	 When you are setting up a new iOS device, the Setup process provides a screen asking if you want 
to restore from backup. Tap Restore from iCloud Backup. If you don’t restore from backup during 
setup, the only way you can do it later is to erase everything on the new device and set up the 
device again.
	 If you lose the content and settings on a device, to restore from backup, tap Settings, then General.  
Scroll to the bottom and tap Reset, then tap Erase All Content and Settings (refer to Figure 16-22). 
You will be given the opportunity to select a backup from iCloud through the Setup Assistant.

Use iTunes to Back up and Sync Content
After you have installed iTunes software on your computer, you can use it to back up and sync content, 
transfer purchased content from your device to your computer, and update iOS on your device. Follow 
these steps:
1. Make sure your computer qualifies for iTunes. For a Windows computer, iTunes can install under 
Windows 8/7 and needs 400 MB of free hard drive space. Install a 64-bit version of iTunes on a 64-bit 
OS and a 32-bit version of iTunes on a 32-bit OS.
2. Go to apple.com/itunes/download and download and install the software. After the software is installed, 
restart your computer.
3. Connect your device to your computer by way of a USB port. iTunes automatically launches and displays 
the window shown in Figure 16-24.
To see your options for backups, syncing, and transferring, in the iTunes window, click File and click 
Devices. Notice the four options shown in Figure 16-25 are Sync (transfers apps and data from the computer 
to the device), Transfer Purchases (transfers apps and data purchased on the device to the computer), Back 
Up (backs up content from the device to the computer), and Restore from Backup (restores backups to the 
device). To back up the device to the computer, click Back Up.

You can also perform a backup by clicking Back Up Now on the Summary screen in the Backups group 
(refer back to Figure 16-7).
When you back up content with iTunes, the backup is stored on your computer at this location when 
using Windows 8/7:
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\
iTunes automatically syncs the contacts, app data and app settings, documents, calendar, call history, 
photos and videos taken by the device, Wi-Fi and email passwords, Microsoft Exchange information, 
bookmarks, text messages and pictures, and voice messages.
To verify and customize exactly what iTunes is syncing, do the following:
1. With your device connected to your computer, select your device in the upper-left corner of the iTunes 
window. The Summary page was shown in Figure 16-7.
2. Scroll down to see the lower part of the Summary page, where you can choose how to sync, including 
allowing to sync when the iPad is in the same Wi-Fi network as the computer, as shown in Figure 16-26. 
You can also control what to sync.
3. Select options from the Settings menu in the left pane of the iTunes window to choose what content to 
sync, such as apps, music, movies, photos. After you make your selections, click Sync to start the sync.
If you have more than one Apple device, the next time the second device is connected to iTunes, content 
is synced to it (unless it’s already set to sync over Wi-Fi). Using iTunes, any content on any device makes its 
way to the other devices and to your computer for backup.
Notes For best protection, be sure you make routine backups of the user profile folder on your computer. The user 
profile folder contains user settings and data, and part of this data is your iOS device backups.
Notes You can manage Wi-Fi syncs from your iPhone or iPad. To do this, go to the Settings app and tap General. Scroll 
down and tap iTunes Wi-Fi Sync. Recent syncs are shown on the screen, and a new sync can be initiated here as well.

Restore from an iTunes Backup
To restore from backup, connect the device to iTunes, select the device to show the Summary page, and in 
the Backups section, click Restore Backup in the shortcut menu (refer back to Figure 16-7). Also, when you 
are setting up a new device and you first connect it to iTunes on your computer, it will ask if you want to 
restore from backup or set up the device as a new device. You can also see in Figure 16-7 where you can 
update an iOS device through iTunes. From iOS version 5 and later, this is not necessary, as the device can 
receive updates automatically through a cellular or Wi-Fi connection.
Use AirDrop and Handoff to Sync Content
Beginning with iOS 7, iPhones and iPads can easily transfer files, such as photos, videos, and documents, 
between devices that belong to you or to someone else using a feature called AirDrop. Embedded in iOS, 
AirDrop uses Bluetooth to detect nearby compatible devices, then creates a peer-to-peer network using a Wi-Fi 
signal between the devices. The connections are protected by a firewall at each device, and transmissions are 
encrypted. AirDrop can be enabled for contacts only, or it can detect any compatible devices nearby regardless 
of who owns them, or it can be disabled completely. AirDrop settings are accessed through the Control Center, 
as shown in Figure 16-27a. To open the Control Center, swipe up from the bottom of the screen. To share files 
from within an app, open the app and tap Share. For example, Figure 16-27b shows the Maps app and the 
option to share the map location by AirDrop to a nearby MacBook.
Notes To check for and install updates on the device itself, open the Settings app, then tap General in the left 
pane. On the right side, tap Software Update. Any available updates will be reported here and can be installed.

Another synchronization tool designed to connect devices that all use the same Apple ID is Handoff. Handoff 
lets you start a task on one device, such as an iPad, then pick up that task on another device, such as a Mac 
desktop or laptop. To use Handoff, make sure that both devices are signed into iCloud with the same Apple ID, 
and that both devices have Bluetooth activated. To turn on Handoff on the iOS device, tap Settings, General, 
Handoff & Suggested Apps, and turn on Handoff (see Figure 16-28a). Now you’re ready to use Handoff. For 
example, open a supported app on the iOS device, such as Safari, and then look for that app’s icon on a Mac 
laptop. On the Mac computer, you’ll see a small mobile device icon appended to the app’s icon, as shown in 
Figure 16-28b. Click to open the app, and the app will pick up where you left off with the other device.
Troubleshoot iOS Devices
When learning to troubleshoot any OS or device, remember the web is a great source of 
information. Depend on the support.apple.com website to give you troubleshooting tips and 
procedures for its iOS and mobile devices. Let’s first look at some troubleshooting tools 
and then some common problems and their solutions.
Tools for Troubleshooting the iOS
For iPhones or iPads, you can sometimes solve a problem by restarting, resetting, updating, or restoring 
the device. Try the first step that follows and if that does not solve the problem, move on to the next step. 
The steps are ordered so as to solve the problem while making the least changes to the system (least intrusive 
solution). With each step, first make sure the device is plugged in or already has sufficient charge to complete 
the step. After you try one step, check to see if the problem is solved before you move on to the next step. 
Here are the tools in the order you should use them:
1. Close running apps. Press the Wake/sleep button twice and swipe each app up to close it. Reopen an 
app that you want to use. Too many open apps can shorten battery life.
2. Uninstall and reinstall an app. If an app is giving problems, uninstall it. (Press the app icon until it jiggles 
and then press the X beside the app icon.) Use the iTunes Store to download and reinstall the app.

3. Restart the device. To restart the device (perform a soft reset), press and hold the Wake/sleep button until 
the red slider bar appears and then drag the slider. Then press and hold the Wake/sleep button until the 
Apple logo appears. A soft reset puts the device in hibernation and does not clear memory.
 4.	 Reset the device. To reset the device (called a forced restart or hard reset), press and hold the Wake/
sleep button and the Home button at the same time for at least 10 seconds until the Apple logo 
appears. A hard reset is like a full shutdown in Windows and performs a full clean boot.
 5.	 Update iOS. To update iOS with the latest patches, first back up content and settings if possible. Then 
tap Settings and Software Update.
 6.	 Update from Recovery mode using iTunes. This process attempts to update iOS without losing data or 
settings. Follow these steps:
a.	Make sure the latest version of iTunes is installed on your computer (you can also use someone 
else’s computer and iTunes installation so long as iTunes is up to date).
b.	Connect the device to the computer and force it to restart by pressing and holding the Wake/sleep and 
Home buttons at the same time. Keep holding both buttons until the Recovery mode screen appears.
c.	 Tap Update to reinstall iOS without erasing personal data.
d.	Don’t unplug or interrupt the device during the update. If the device exits Recovery mode before the 
update is complete, force a restart again, and tap Update again.
 7.	 Reset all settings. If you have not already done so, back up the data and settings. Then to erase settings, 
tap Settings, General and Reset. On the Reset screen (refer back to Figure 16-22), tap Reset All Settings.
 8.	 Erase all data and settings. First, make every attempt to back up data and settings. Then to erase all 
data and settings, tap Settings, General and Reset. On the Reset screen (see Figure 16-22), tap Erase All 
Content and Settings.
 9.	 Restore the device. This process reinstalls iOS and you will lose all your data on the device. The device 
is restored to its factory default condition, but you can then apply a backup if you have one. Before 
you perform a restore, try to back up all your data and settings. Then follow these steps:
a.	Make sure the latest version of iTunes is installed on your computer (you can also use someone 
else’s computer and iTunes installation so long as iTunes is up to date). Also, if possible, make sure 
Find My iPhone or Find My iPad is turned off in the iCloud settings menu on the device.
b.	Connect the device to your computer and select it in iTunes. Click the Summary panel and click 
Restore. Click Restore again to confirm that you know all data and content will be deleted.
c.	 Don’t unplug or interrupt the device during the restore. iOS is reinstalled and all data and settings 
are lost.
d.	Next, restore your data and settings from backup. How to do that was covered earlier in the chapter.
10. Restore the device from Recovery mode using iTunes. This process might work to restore the device to its 
factory state when the restore process fails or when you cannot start the restore process, such as when the 
device restarts repeatedly, gets stuck during the startup process, or is frozen and not responding at all. The 
process does a firmware upgrade. All content and data are lost and the OS is refreshed. Follow these steps:
a.	Turn off the device and leave it off for a few minutes. If you have trouble turning off the device, 
press and hold the Wake/sleep button and the Home button at the same time.
OS Differences Each mobile OS defines a soft reset and hard reset differently. For iOS, a soft reset puts the device 
in hibernation and then restarts the device, and a hard reset is a hard boot, which involves a full shutdown of the device. 
For Android devices, a soft reset is a hard boot, and a hard reset, also called a factory reset, erases all data and restores 
the device to factory default state.

b.	While holding down the Home button, connect the device to your computer. If you see the device 
charging, wait a few minutes while it charges. Do not release the Home button while it is charging. 
When you see the Connect to iTunes screen, release the Home button.
c.	 iTunes should recognize the device and display a message saying the device is in Recovery mode and 
ask if you want to restore the device. Tap Restore and follow the directions on screen to restore the 
device to factory state.
d.	Restore data and settings using the most recent backup.
If the device is still not working properly, search for more troubleshooting tips on the Apple website at 
support.apple.com, review the list of common problems below, or take the device to an Apple store for repair.
Common Problems and Solutions
Some common problems with iOS devices can be addressed by checking specific settings or identifying  
particular malfunctions. If the suggestions listed here don’t work, then move on to perform a soft reset, 
hard reset, and more invasive tools discussed earlier. Here are some problems and their solutions:
	 Touch screen not responsive. Recall that Apple devices use a capacitive touch screen that does not get 
out of alignment unless there is a hardware problem. Here are some tips to try when a touch screen is 
giving you problems:
	 Clean the screen with a soft, damp cloth.
	 Don’t use the touch screen when your hands are wet or you are wearing gloves.
	 Remove any plastic sheet or film protecting the touch screen.
	 Dim display. When the display is dim, open the Control Center and adjust the screen brightness. 
To open the Control Center, swipe up from the bottom of the screen.
	 Weak cellular signal. If you have a weak cellular signal or just want to save your cellular minutes, you 
can use Wi-Fi to connect to the Internet for VoIP voice communication. In the United States, Sprint and 
T-Mobile offer a feature called Wi-Fi calling, which uses VoIP over a Wi-Fi connection to the Internet. To 
enable Wi-Fi calling on an iPhone that uses one of these two carriers, tap Settings and Phone, then turn 
on Wi-Fi Calling. You can also install an app, such as Skype or LINE, on your iPhone and use it to make 
VoIP phone calls on a Wi-Fi network, regardless of the carrier you are using.
	 No sound or distorted sound from speakers. First, make sure the volume is turned up by pressing the 
device’s physical Up volume button, or by checking Control Center, which you can access by swiping 
up from the bottom of the screen. Also, the problem could be that the sound output for the device is 
being misdirected. Check to see if Bluetooth is on, and if so, turn it off in order to make sure the device 
is not inadvertently connected to a Bluetooth headset or car stereo system. Also check Accessibility set-
tings by tapping Settings, General, Accessibility. Some of the Accessibility audio settings can interfere 
with normal operation of the device’s built-in speaker system. On iPhones, check that Phone Noise 
Cancellation is disabled.
	 Screen won’t rotate. A gyroscope is a device that contains a disc that is free to move and respond to 
gravity as the device is moved. An accelerometer is a type of gyroscope used in mobile devices to sense 
the physical position of the device, which helps the OS know when to adjust the screen orientation 
Caution
When using Wi-Fi calling on your iPhone, confirm your Emergency Address from the link on the Wi-Fi Calling 
screen so that 911 services can respond to an emergency call from your phone if needed. Federal law requires that your 
carrier have a validated home address on file before activating Wi-Fi calling on your account. Your actual location can be 
updated on your phone each time you switch to a different wireless network.

from portrait to landscape. In iPhones and iPads, the accelerometer also enables features such as shake, 
where the user literally shakes the device to perform actions such as undoing the deletion of an email. If 
the screen won’t rotate between portrait and landscape orientations, check to ensure the orientation isn’t 
locked. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to reveal the Control Center. The Orientation Lock icon 
is a padlock symbol with an arrow circling around it. Tap it to turn it on and off.
	 Bluetooth connectivity issues. Sometimes an iOS update will cause issues with Wi-Fi network connectivity 
or Bluetooth pairings. For Bluetooth issues, first delete all known devices by tapping Settings, Bluetooth, 
then tap the info icon for each device and tap Forget This Device. Then, in the left panel, tap General, 
and scroll down and tap Reset. Tap Reset Network Settings and tap Reset on the warning box. This 
restores network settings to factory defaults, then you can attempt to re-pair a Bluetooth device with 
the iPad or iPhone.
	 Wi-Fi connectivity issues. Lack of wireless connectivity or intermittent connectivity is often caused by 
problems with the signal that is being broadcast from the router or access point. First make sure the 
access point and router are working correctly, that the Wi-Fi network you want to connect to is visible to 
the device (not hidden), and that you’re using the correct security key. For Wi-Fi issues on the device side, 
first start with Wi-Fi settings (in the Settings app, tap Wi-Fi) for the network you’re trying to connect 
to. Tap the info icon, and try renewing the IP address (tap Renew Lease then tap Renew). If that doesn’t 
work, tap Forget This Network, then retry connecting to the network. Finally, try resetting the network 
settings, as described above for Bluetooth connectivity issues.
	 Overheating. For a true overheating problem, where the device is too hot to touch safely, power off 
and replace the device. However, all devices can get fairly warm if the display is left on for too long, if 
the surrounding environment is particularly hot, if the device is sitting on a soft surface, if the battery 
is going bad, or if the device remains plugged in to a power source for a long period of time. Don’t use 
a mobile device in direct sunlight for long periods of time, try to turn off the display when you’re not 
using it, and close apps that you’re not using. This will also help conserve battery power.
	 Location services not working in apps. A mobile device provides location-specific information by 
using Bluetooth and GPS information as well as crowd-sourced Wi-Fi and cellular databases built from 
anonymous, encrypted geo-tagged locations of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers. A GPS (Global Positioning 
System) receiver determines its position by using the GPS satellite data or data from the position of 
nearby cellular towers. Geotracking, which is the identification of a device’s location in order to track the 
device’s movements, relies heavily on location information. Many apps can only access this information if 
Location Services is enabled on the device (emergency calls can use location information even if Locations 
Services is not enabled). For example, Siri checks the device’s current location before recommending 
Italian restaurants in the area.
	
	 If an app is having trouble accessing location-specific information, check the Location Services 
settings by tapping Settings, Privacy, and then Location Services, which shows the screen in Figure 16-29. 
Tap Share My Location to determine whether apps like Messages and Find My Friends can share your 
location information with contacts. On the Location Services screen, tap the About Location Services 
& Privacy link to read more information about how your privacy is affected by sharing your location 
information.
Notes If you know where the battery is located inside a mobile device, check for heat originating from that area 
of the device. If so, replacing the battery might be your solution. For most mobile devices, you can find tear-down 
instructions, videos, tools, and replacement parts for purchase at ifixit.com. Be aware you might void the warranty 
when you open the case.

	 System lockout. If your iOS device is locked because of too many failed attempts at entering your 
passcode to sign in to the device, you can wait until the timer counts down on the screen and then 
attempt to enter the passcode again. If you have forgotten the passcode, Apple advises your only 
solution is to reset the device, which erases all data and settings, and then you can restore the device 
from backup. You have a few options for resetting the device:
	 If you set up Find My iPhone or Find My iPad, you can go to icloud.com/find, sign in with 
your Apple ID, select your device, and then erase it. The erase process resets the device to its 
factory state.
	 If you have previously synced the device with iTunes, connect the device to iTunes and allow it to

Research iOS Browser Apps
A smart phone or tablet comes with a built-in browser, but you can replace it with a third-party 
browser. Research browser apps and answer the following questions:

that makes it stand out.
2.	 The iPhone and iPad don’t use Adobe Flash, and many websites depend on Flash. What workaround app can be 
used with iOS so that the iPhone and iPad can view content on these websites?
Configure, Sync, and Troubleshoot Android Devices
Because the Android operating system is open source, manufacturers can customize the 
OS and how it works in many variations. Therefore, it is not always possible to give specific 
step-by-step directions similar to those given for iOS. In this part of the chapter, you learn 
about general procedures you can follow to support an Android device. We also give a few 
examples for specific Android devices so that you can see how the step-by-step directions might work on 
an Android device.
Most of the settings you need to support an Android device are found in the Settings app; however, 
settings options might not be in the Settings app and some settings options might rely on third-party apps.
On the other hand, Android is usually fun to use and support because it offers so much flexibility and 
the potential to customize. Once you get comfortable with Android, you can do amazing things with it. 
Technicians who love to tinker with devices tend to gravitate to Android, and those who just want a quick 
and easy tool to use without a hassle choose iOS.
When you are assigned responsibility for supporting an Android device, begin with the user guide for 
the device, which you can download from the device manufacturer’s website. The user guide is likely to tell 
you the detailed steps of how to connect to a network, configure email, update the OS, sync and back up 
settings and data, secure the device, and what to do when things go wrong.

Now let’s look at what to expect when supporting an Android device.
Notes Most of us rarely follow step-by-step directions when learning to use a new device until when “all else fails, 
read the directions.” This part of the chapter can give you an idea of what to look for on an Android device, and you can 
likely figure out the specific steps for yourself.

 Network connections are configured using the Settings screen. Available settings can include:
	 Turn Airplane mode on or off. Recall that Airplane mode disables all wireless network antennas and can 
help conserve data usage or battery power when your battery is low.
	 Turn Wi-Fi on or off and configure Wi-Fi access points. Tap Wi-Fi. On the Wi-Fi settings screen, as shown 
in Figure 16-31a, you can add a Wi-Fi connection, manage existing networks, access the Advanced Wi-Fi 
settings screen (see Figure 16-31b), or explore the tutorial. When you first attempt to connect to a secured 
Wi-Fi network, you need its security key.
	 Turn Wi-Fi calling on or off. Wi-Fi calling, available through certain carriers, allows you to make 
phone calls over a Wi-Fi network rather than needing a cellular network. Turn on Wi-Fi calling, 
then input 911 information, as shown in Figure 16-32a. You can also enable address notification 
(Figure 16-32b) so that you’re prompted to update your location each time you connect with a new 
Wi-Fi network. These addresses are saved so the information won’t have to be reentered the next 
time you visit that location.

	 NFC and Bluetooth technologies both provide options for transferring data directly between devices 
that are held in close proximity to each other (see Figure 16-33b).
	 Miracast is a wireless display-mirroring technology that requires a Miracast-capable screen or dongle 
in order to mirror the phone’s display to a TV, a wireless monitor, or a wireless projector. A VPN app 
on the device sometimes disables the Miracast feature because of the way Miracast seems to pose a 
threat to VPN security. It might be necessary to uninstall third-party VPN apps in order for Miracast 
to work properly.
	 Turn Bluetooth on or off. To configure Bluetooth settings, tap Bluetooth (refer back to Figure 16-30a). 
On the Bluetooth settings screen, you can make the device discoverable so it can pair with other 
Bluetooth devices.
	 Share and connect. The Share & connect screen in Figure 16-33a offers several options for network 
connections to share content:
	 Set up tethering. Figure 16-34 shows the Wireless & networks screen on an Android phone, which 
you can use to tether your phone to your computer. With tethering, your computer can use the phone’s 
cellular network connection to access the Internet. This feature must be enabled on your cellular plan

Configure Android Email
Because Google owns Gmail, Google makes it very easy to configure a Gmail account on an 
Android device. To set up a Gmail account, tap the Gmail app on the home screen and enter 
your Gmail account and password. (If you don’t see the app on your home screen, tap the 
Apps Drawer, and then tap Gmail.) You can change settings for this account later by going 
to the Settings app, tapping Accounts & sync, and selecting your Google account.
Here are the steps to set up email accounts other than Gmail or any other type of account such as Skype, 
YouTube, Photobucket, Dropbox, or Facebook accounts:
1. Tap Settings, Accounts & sync, Add account. On the Add account screen (see Figure 16-36a), Android 
can automatically configure several types of accounts. For an email account, tap Email. On the next 
screen, you might be given options for different email account types, such as Yahoo!. If none of these 
is correct, tap Other. Next, enter your email account and password and tap Next (see Figure 16-36b). 
The account is automatically set up.

2. If you get errors using automatic configuration, try again with a manual setup. Enter the email address 
and password and tap Manual setup (see Figure 16-36b). You can then select the type of account (POP3 
or IMAP4), enter incoming and outgoing mail server addresses, POP3 or IMAP4 protocols, port numbers, 
and email encryption.

Sync, Update, Back Up, and Restore from Backup with Android
Syncing, backing up, and restoring from backup with Android is much simpler now than 
it has been in the past. Additionally, Android offers more methods and options for these 
chores, and third-party apps can often be used. In this part of the chapter, you learn to sync 
with online accounts, sync all your apps to an app store, and back up any content to your 
personal computer.
Sync Using Online Accounts
Each Google product automatically syncs across devices when you’re signed in to your account on that 
device. For example, the Gmail app on your phone will show the same information and configuration 
settings as the Gmail interface in your Chrome browser on your computer. Google Drive makes documents 
available to all of your Google-connected devices, and Google Calendar syncs appointments and reminders 
across devices. All data is web-based, so everything is accessible through a web browser (Google products 
work best in Chrome, of course). You can also sync contacts, calendars, photos, newsfeeds, messages, 
games, and other data with social media accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, LinkedIn, and 
others. If you notice an account is not syncing correctly, re-sync information for the account through 
the same Accounts & sync menu used to create the account. On the Settings app, tap Accounts & sync. 
Select an existing account to turn on sync, force a re-sync, or adjust other account settings.
Use Third-Party Syncing Apps
For other content, such as pictures, music, and videos, third-party apps might better suit your needs. Some 
Android devices come preinstalled with sync apps. Some apps like OneDrive will sync entire folders in the 
background with no user intervention required, while others like Dropbox only sync files placed in the 
app’s own folder. Some apps sync between a mobile device and computer, while others maintain those files 
in the cloud and the service is linked to the user’s account.
Sync Apps with Your App Source
Google Play maintains records of all apps for a particular Google account. A Google account is associated 
with an email address (Gmail or some other email address). To tie a Google account to your device, tap 
Settings, Accounts & sync, Add account, Google Accounts, and follow the directions on screen. The process 
allows you to create a Google account if you don’t already have one.
You can sometimes solve a problem with an app by uninstalling it and then installing it again. To 
uninstall an app, open the Settings app and tap Apps. Press and hold the app you want to uninstall 
and then tap Uninstall.
To update an app or restore an app you uninstalled, follow these steps:
1. On the home screen, tap Play Store. The Google Play screen appears (see Figure 16-37a for an Android 
phone). Apps are tied to the Google account you used when you downloaded the app. Tap the menu 
icon, then tap My apps (see Figure 16-37b) to manage settings for your existing apps, including 
updates.

2. On the My apps screen, the INSTALLED tab shows a list of apps already installed on the device. 
To update an app, tap Update, then tap UPDATE again on the app’s screen and accept any access 
permission changes. To reinstall an app that has been uninstalled, tap ALL at the top of the screen. In 
the list of apps that you have previously downloaded or purchased from the Play Store, select the app 
and tap INSTALL. The app installs again. Notice on these screens that you’re given information on 
permissions assigned to each app, including how it can use storage, the network, GPS locator service, 
and other hardware controls.
You can control how an app is updated. To do so, return to the Google Play screen and tap the menu 
icon (refer back to Figure 16-37a). Then tap Settings. On the Settings screen, tap Auto-update apps and 
choose to not auto-update apps, which gives you manual control over updates, or Auto-update apps over 
Wi-Fi only to conserve battery charge and use of the cellular data network.
In addition to the Play Store, you can purchase apps from other sites like Amazon.com. When you 
purchase an app from a source other than the Play Store, make sure the site provides the opportunity to 
restore the app if that becomes necessary.
Update the Android OS
Updates to the Android OS are automatically pushed to the device from the manufacturer. Because 
each manufacturer maintains its own versions of Android, these updates might not come at the same 
time Google announces a major update. When the device receives notice of an update, it might display 
a message asking permission to install the update. With some devices, you can also manually check for 
updates at any time, although not all devices provide the option to perform a manual update of the 
Android OS. To see if manual updates can be performed on your device, go to the Settings app and tap

About. On the About screen, tap System updates or Software update or a similar item. The device turns 
to the manufacturer’s website for information and reports updates available.
Before installing an OS update, you might want to read on the website the release instructions about 
the update, called Product Release Instructions (PRI), such as new features or patches the update provides 
and how long the update will take. Later, if a device is giving problems after an OS update or after the 
device has been rooted, which is similar to the concept of jailbreaking an iOS phone, check the PRI for 
information that might help you understand the nature of the problem.
Back up and Restore Android
Syncing your emails, contacts, calendar, photos, and other data through online accounts serves as a useful 
backup for that data should something happen to your phone. On the other hand, your app data, Wi-Fi 
passwords, and other settings can be backed up directly through the Android OS. To do this, go to the 
Settings app, then tap Backup & reset. Make sure that Back up my data is checked and change the backup 
account if needed. Your backup data is stored on Google’s servers and is connected with your Google 
account. You can access much of this information directly through your account on the Google website, 
including recent browser searches, contacts, calendars, location history, alarms, and network connection 
settings like Wi-Fi passwords. On your mobile device, you can also choose to restore backed-up settings 
and data to an app that you reinstall after removing it.
You can back up the layout of your home screen and the wallpaper as well. In the Settings app, tap 
Home screen. Tap Home backup & restore, then Backup. Tap Yes to save the current home screen settings 
as a new backup file. To restore these settings later, return to the Home screen menu, tap Home backup & 
restore, and this time tap Restore. Tap Yes to confirm the restore request.
Research Apps for Mobile Payment Services
iPhone and Android phones both offer some kind of mobile payment service, which allows you to use 
your smart phone to pay for merchandise or services at a retail checkout counter. iPhone has Apple 
Pay. Android can use the Google Wallet app and Android Pay will soon be embedded in the newest 
Android phones. Microsoft has announced that Windows 10 phones will also have a similar service. 
Mobile payment services use NFC (near field communication) technology, a short-range, low-power wireless technol-
ogy, to exchange financial information between your phone and the reader at the checkout counter. You might want 
to pay with a credit card stored on your phone or get discounts with a store rewards account reported by your phone 
as you check out. But how secure is your sensitive financial information?
Research the following topics, then answer the following questions:
1.	 Research how mobile payment systems use NFC technology. How does NFC work? How can you activate NFC on 
an Android phone? An iPhone? A Windows phone?
2.	 Find and read some articles online or watch videos that describe the details of storing financial information 
for mobile payment systems, accessing the information when needed, and transmitting the information 
securely. What security measures are in place? Where is the data actually stored? What information is actually 
transmitted at the point of transaction?
3.	 List three third-party mobile payment apps available either in Apple’s App Store, in Android’s Play Store, or in 
Microsoft’s Store. On which mobile OS versions will the apps work? What are advantages and disadvantages of 
each app? How much do the apps cost? What security measures do the apps use?
4.	 If you were to purchase one of these apps, which one would it be? Why?

Troubleshoot Android Devices
Follow these general tips to solve problems with Android devices. For more specific instructions, 
search the website of the device manufacturer:
A+  
220-902 
2.5, 2.6, 
4.3
1. Force reboot or soft reset. You can forcefully reboot the device, which, for Android devices is 
called a soft reset, by pressing and holding the power button. Power cycling a smart phone 
every few days is a good idea anyway to keep the phone functioning at peak efficiency. If this doesn’t 
work, you can open the back cover of the device, remove the battery, and then reinstall the battery. Not 
all Android devices allow removal of the battery. In those cases, some devices offer a simulated battery 
pull. Research online to find out if this is an option.
2. Uninstall and reinstall an app. If you suspect an app is giving a problem, uninstall it and use the app 
store to reinstall it. How to do this was covered earlier in the chapter.
3. Update Android. Try installing Android updates, if available.
4. Use Safe Mode. Similar to Windows computers, Android offers a Safe Mode for troubleshooting OS and 
device issues. Be aware, however, that booting to Safe Mode might result in loss of some settings such as 
synchronization accounts. The combination of buttons to access Safe Mode varies by device, so consult the 
manufacturer’s website for specific instructions. For one LG smart phone, to access Safe Mode you hold 
down the power button until the power menu appears. Tap and hold the Power Off option until the pop-up 
shown in Figure 16-38a appears. Tap OK, and the phone restarts into Safe Mode, as shown in Figure 
16-38b. Notice the Safe mode flag at the bottom of the screen, and the default appearance of the home 
screen. In Safe Mode, only apps native to the Android installation can run, and troubleshooting tools can be 
accessed through the Settings app to back up data, test configuration issues, or reset the device. To exit Safe 
Mode, on the Notifications shade, tap the shield icon to restart the device and restore third-party apps.

5. Update firmware. Updating the device’s firmware can solve problems with network connections and other 
issues where the Android OS must interact with hardware. A firmware update, also called a baseband 
update, is distributed by the manufacturer of the device. Usually the firmware update is pushed out from 
the carrier along with an OS update, but not always. To determine the current baseband version of an 
Android device, on the Settings app, tap About, then Software info. You can take a screen shot to save the 
baseband version information before checking for an update. To update the firmware, on the Settings app, 
tap System updates, then Update Firmware (this menu might vary slightly between manufacturers). When 
the update is complete or it’s reported that no update is available, tap OK.
6. Use Recovery mode. Take the device into Recovery mode, which is somewhat similar in concept to 
UEFI/BIOS setup in Windows. To do so, look for instructions on the manufacturer’s website. Most likely, 
you need to hold down a combination of buttons. Once there, Android presents a menu where you can 
reboot the system, restore the system to factory state, and possibly other options. Try the reboot before 
you try the factory state, because this last option causes all your apps and data to be lost.
7. Factory reset or hard reset. As a last resort, you can perform a factory reset, which, for Android devices 
is also called a hard reset. The reset erases all data and settings and resets the device to its original factory 
default state. To do this, from the Settings app, tap Backup & reset, then tap Factory data reset.
Several issues commonly faced with Android devices can be addressed with a little understanding of what 
has gone wrong behind the scenes. Here’s a description of how to handle some common problems:
	 Dropped calls. Sometimes updating the device’s firmware can solve problems with dropped calls 
because the update might apply to the radio firmware, which manages the cellular, Wi-Fi, and 
Bluetooth radios.
	 Wireless connectivity problems. Intermittent connectivity problems might be caused by a weak Wi-Fi 
signal. By default, Android stops attempting to reconnect to a weak Wi-Fi signal in order to conserve 
battery power, but you can change this setting. On the Wi-Fi screen, tap the menu icon and then tap 
Advanced Wi-Fi. Uncheck Wi-Fi signal weak (see Figure 16-39a) so that the device will attempt to

maintain a connection even with a weak signal. Also check to make sure Keep Wi-Fi on when screen is 
off is set to Yes so the device won’t have to reconnect to Wi-Fi every time the screen is turned back on.
	
Some wireless networks are hidden and must be added manually. On the Settings app, tap Wi-Fi. 
Tap the menu icon in the upper-right corner of the screen (the three-dot ellipsis icon, as shown earlier in 
Figure 16-31a), then tap Add Wi-Fi. On the screen shown in Figure 16-39b, enter the SSID and security 
key for the hidden wireless network.
	 Bluetooth not connecting. Make sure that Bluetooth is turned on by tapping the Bluetooth icon on 
the Notifications shade or on the Settings app. Also check Bluetooth settings. To do this, on the Settings 
app, tap Bluetooth, then tap the menu icon in the upper-right corner. From this menu, you can edit 
the phone’s name, and most importantly, you can adjust the visibility time. Tap Visibility timeout and 
increase the visibility time so that the device you’re attempting to pair with will have more time to 
identify the Android device for pairing.
	 Apps not loading. You might find that there is insufficient space available on the device, especially if 
one app is taking up all of its allocated space, or memory is not available for the app you want to load. 
Uninstalling unused apps and deleting files no longer needed might solve the storage problem. You can 
download an app from the Play Store that can help clean up storage space, and other apps that report 
on how apps are using memory. You can also install a file manager app, such as ES File Explorer, to 
navigate through the directory and delete files or folders one at a time.
	
	 To view used and available storage space, go to the Settings app and tap Storage. You can see in 
Figure 16-40a where nearly 17 GB is still available on this device, apps are taking up almost 6 GB of 
the used space, and multimedia files (pictures, videos, and audio files) are taking up less than 100 MB 
total. From the Settings app, tap Smart cleaning for suggestions on files to delete and clear up space 
(see Figure 16-40b).

(see Figure-16-41a). Tap the overview button on the Action bar, and swipe off to the side as many 
apps as possible to close them. You can also force stop an app. To see all installed apps, go to the 
Settings app and tap Apps. Swipe to the left to see the Running tab, which shows all running apps 
(see Figure 16-41b). Tap an app to force stop the app.
	 Short battery life. Too many apps running in the background will drain the battery quickly, as will Wi-Fi, 
Bluetooth, or other wireless technologies. Disable wireless connections and close apps when you’re not 
using them to save battery juice. Many Android devices have replaceable batteries, so if a battery is 
performing poorly, consider replacing it.
	 Dim display. Swipe down from the top of any screen to open the Notifications shade, then slide the 
Brightness slider to the right to brighten the screen. Make sure the Auto option is not selected so 
that you have more control over the screen’s brightness level. This is especially helpful when trying 
to view the screen in bright daylight, but increasing the brightness level will also drain the battery 
more  quickly.
	 Inaccurate touch screen response. A cover on the screen can result in inaccurate touch screen responses. 
Also, accessibility settings can alter a touch screen’s performance. Check accessibility settings in the 
Settings app. Scroll down and tap Accessibility. Touch feedback time is a particular suspect, as is Touch

control areas and Auto-rotate screen. You can also perform a motion sensor calibration. In the Settings 
app, tap Gestures, then tap Motion sensor calibration. Tap Calibrate sensor and follow on screen 
instructions.
	 Overheating. Running several apps or keeping a smart phone’s screen on for more than just a few 
minutes can heat up the device. Try turning the screen off for a while, and close unneeded apps. 
If this doesn’t work, there might be something wrong with the device’s battery, which would need 
to be checked by a technician at a service center.
	 Unable to decrypt email. Email encryption is done using a public key and private key. You distribute 
your public key to those who want to send you encrypted email and you keep the private key on your 
device. If your device is unable to decrypt email, most likely you’ll need to generate a new public key 
and private key and distribute your new public key to those who send you encrypted email. Search the 
website of the email app that you are using for encryption to find instructions for setting up new public 
and private keys and for other tips on troubleshooting decrypting problems.
	 System lockout. If a device is locked because of too many failed attempts to sign in (such as when a child 
has attempted to unlock your device), you can do the following:
1.	Wait until the timer on the device counts down and gives you another opportunity to sign in. Enter 
your passcode or screen swipe.
2.	If the passcode or screen swipe doesn’t work, enter your Google account and password associated 
with your device. After you have entered the account and password, you must reset your passcode 
or screen swipe pattern.
3.	If you still can’t unlock the device, know that Google offers many solutions to this problem. Go to 
accounts.google.com and search for additional methods and tools to unlock your device.
If you find you are unable to do all you want to do with your Android device (such as install a powerful app 
or download the latest Android release before your device manufacturer makes it available), you can root your 
device. Rooting, similar to jailbreaking an iOS device, is the process of obtaining root or administrator privileges 
to an Android device, which then gives you complete access to the entire file system (all folders and files) and 
all commands and features. As with jailbreaking an iOS device, it’s legal in the United States to root only smart 
phones, not tablets.
To root a device, you download and use third-party software. The process takes some time and might 
even involve restoring the device to its factory state. The process of rooting might corrupt the OS, and after 
the device is rooted, installed apps that require root access can corrupt the OS. For some manufacturers, 
rooting will void your warranty, and some carriers refuse to provide technical support for a rooted device. 
In addition, BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies in enterprise environments might not allow rooting. 
Avoid rooting if you can; if you decide to root a device, do so with caution!
Configure, Sync, and Troubleshoot Windows Mobile Devices
Windows Phone tiles and menus are remarkably different from Android and iOS icon-based 
launchers. But the settings, options, and troubleshooting tools will feel familiar to you because 
they closely resemble those of Windows 8. Here’s a quick overview of settings and troubleshooting 
tools on a Windows Phone device.

The Action Center, by default, provides direct links to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection apps, 
as well as the Airplane mode app. You can access the Action Center by swiping down from 
the top of the Start screen. Note that buttons in the Action Center are links to their respective 
apps, not toggle switches. Tapping Wi-Fi, for example, opens the Wi-Fi app, as shown in Figure 
16-42a. The list of shortcuts in the Action Center can be customized by tapping notifications+actions in the 
Settings app, as shown in Figure 16-42b. Also use the Settings app to access cellular+SIM, NFC, Internet

Configure Windows Phone Email, Sync, and Backup
Windows Phone automatically syncs contacts, calendars, and email with an online email 
account such as a Microsoft account, and, similar to Windows on a desktop computer, 
documents can be automatically synced through OneDrive. The first Microsoft account used 
to set up the phone determines the apps and other benefits that will be available to that device, 
and is the account that will be associated with the device’s backup data. Other Microsoft accounts such 
as Outlook.com or Live.com can be added later, but photos in those accounts will not be synced with the 
phone, and certain Xbox features will not be available through those accounts.
To add a Microsoft account to a Windows Phone, open the Settings app, then tap email+accounts. Tap 
add an account, then Microsoft account. An information screen, as shown in Figure 16-43a, describes the 
importance of this first Microsoft account configured on the device. Tap sign in.

Troubleshoot Windows Mobile Devices
The following lists options for troubleshooting Windows mobile devices. Before you start 
troubleshooting, back up your phone’s data, and then attempt the following options, which 
are listed in order from least invasive to most invasive:
1. Power down and power up. As with troubleshooting other mobile devices, begin with restarting the 
phone. Press and hold the power button for about three seconds until slide down to power off appears 
Update and Restore Windows Phone from Backup
Check for Windows Phone updates by opening the Settings app, then tap phone update. If no 
updates are currently pending, tap check for updates. On the phone update screen, you can 
also set the phone to automatically download updates.
Microsoft occasionally issues a critical update for Windows Phone, which generates an 
update notification; the update should be installed right away. Prompts remind users to install the update 
if the phone is not configured to install updates automatically. Even when configured for manual updates, 
Windows Phone will automatically install a required update in three days if the user does not manually 
install the update sooner.
Restoring a Windows phone from backup, or installing a backup on a new device, requires that you use 
the same Microsoft account that was used to create the backup. First connect the phone to a Wi-Fi network 
so you don’t risk incurring charges for cellular data. When you first sign in with your Microsoft account, 
you’re given the opportunity to restore from backup. Select the correct backup, then tap next. Complete the 
two-factor authentication process if required, then tap next. After the restore process is complete, tap next. 
You can enter passwords for accounts that were restored to the phone, or you can tap skip to wait until 
later. Tap done to complete the process.

on the screen. Swipe down, wait several seconds, and then press the power button again to turn the 
phone back on.
2. Force a restart. You can force the phone to restart by pressing and holding the volume down button 
and the power button together for 10–15 seconds until the phone restarts. This option is not available 
on all Windows Phone devices. Check the manufacturer’s documentation for specific directions for these 
devices.
3. Remove the battery. If the battery can be removed, pull it out then put it back in. Press the power button 
to turn the phone back on. If removing power causes issues with signing in to your Microsoft account, 
go to Settings and tap Date+time to reset the time.
4. Update Windows Phone. Go to Settings and tap update. Check for updates and install any updates that 
are available.
5. Reset. Reset the phone to factory defaults. This wipes all user data and settings off the phone, so make 
sure you back up your data and settings first, if possible. On the Settings app, tap about, then tap reset 
your phone. A warning screen indicates that user content is about to be removed from the device. Tap 
yes to continue, and then tap yes on the second warning screen as well. Wait until the reset process is 
complete.
6. Force reset. Some Windows phones offer the ability to force a reset using the phone’s physical buttons. 
This is helpful if the phone is completely unresponsive and you can’t get to the Settings app. Check 
the manufacturer’s documentation for specific steps. For some phones, the following procedure forces 
a reset: Press and hold the volume down and power buttons until the phone vibrates. Immediately 
release the volume down and power buttons, then press and hold the volume down button again until 
a large exclamation mark appears on the screen. Finally, press these four buttons in this order: volume 
up, volume down, power, volume down. The phone resets.
7. Software Recovery Tool. Some Windows phones can be reset and recovered using the Software Recovery 
Tool on your computer. Check the manufacturer’s documentation for specific information on a particular 
model. The Software Recovery Tool erases all user content and settings on the phone. If you have a 
backup of this content, you can restore from backup after the reset. Complete the following steps to use 
your Windows computer to reset your Windows phone:
a.	First make sure the phone is fully charged.
b.	On a Windows 8/7 computer, download the Software Recovery Tool (search for article FA142987 on 
microsoft.com) that is designed for your device and install it.
c.	 Open the application. Then connect the phone to the computer via a USB cable. Once the phone is 
detected, follow the on screen instructions.

>> Chapter Summary
Operating Systems Used on Mobile Devices
	 The most popular operating systems used on mobile devices include Android by Google, iOS by Apple, 
and Windows and Windows Phone by Microsoft.
	 Android is an open source OS, and anyone can develop and sell Android apps or variations in 
the Android OS. Google is the major distributor of Android and Android apps from its Google Play 
website.
	 The iOS by Apple is used only on Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. Apps for 
the iOS are distributed solely by Apple.
	 Windows Phone by Microsoft works on smart phones and tracks version numbers alongside Windows 
for desktops, laptops, and tablets.
Configure, Sync, and Troubleshoot iOS Devices
	 A cellular network provided by a carrier is used by cell phones for voice communication and text mes-
saging. A smart phone or tablet might also contain the technology to connect to a cellular network for 
data transmission.
	 iCloud Backup can be used to back up your device’s content to the cloud and iCloud Drive can sync 
content to all of your iOS devices associated with an Apple ID.
	 iTunes installed on a personal computer can be used to back up iOS content, sync content from the 
computer to the device, update iOS, and restore iOS from backup or to its factory state.
	 To troubleshoot an iOS device, you can restart, reset, update, erase, restore, and recover iOS on 
the device.
Configure, Sync, and Troubleshoot Android Devices
	 The Settings app on an Android device can be used to manage network connections, email, online 
accounts, updates to Android, and security.
	 Each Google product, such as Gmail, Calendars, and Hangouts, syncs across devices when you’re signed 
in to your account on that device. All data is web-based, so everything is also accessible through a web 
browser.
	 Tools and techniques used to solve problems with Android devices include a forced reboot, uninstall 
and reinstall apps, update the Android OS, use Safe Mode, update firmware, use Recovery mode, and 
perform a factory reset.
Configure, Sync, and Troubleshoot Windows Mobile Devices
	 The buttons in the Windows Phone Action Center provide direct links to their respective apps, not 
toggle switches for features.
	 The first Microsoft account used to set up a phone determines the apps and other benefits that will be 
available to that device, and is the account that will be associated with the device’s backup data.
	 Even when configured for manual updates, Windows Phone will automatically install a required update 
in three days if the user does not manually install the update sooner.
	 Some Windows phones offer the ability to force a reset using the phone’s physical buttons. This is 
helpful if the phone is completely unresponsive and the Settings app is inaccessible.

Real Problem 16-1 Using the Microsoft Windows Phone Emulator
Microsoft offers a Windows Phone emulator embedded in its Visual Studio software, which can be used 
by developers of mobile apps for Windows Phone. You will need a Microsoft account to do this project. 
Follow these general directions to download, install, and run the emulator:
1.		 On a Windows 8.1 computer, go into UEFI/BIOS setup and verify that hardware-assisted virtualization 
is turned on. This UEFI/BIOS feature supports VMs running on the system and is required for the 
Windows emulator to work. You learned to use UEFI/BIOS setup earlier in the text.
2.		 Go to visualstudio.com and click the link Download Community 2015 to download Visual Studio 
Community 2015. The downloaded file is vs_community.exe. Double-click the file to install 
the software. Under Choose the type of installation, select Custom. On the next screen, check 
Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.0/8.1 Tools and continue with the installation, which can 
take some time.
3.		 After installation is complete, open Visual Studio 2015 and create a new project. You will be asked to 
sign in to your Microsoft account and the account will be given a free developer license.
4.		 For the project template, in the left pane, click Visual C#, click Windows, click Windows 8, and click 
Windows Phone. In the middle pane, click Blank App (Windows Phone). Click OK and the project is 
created.
5.		 To select the emulator for your project, click Device and select any of the emulator devices, as shown 
in Figure 16-47.
6.		 To start the emulator, click the Emulator button that replaces the Device button. The emulator tool 
opens (see Figure 16-48). Click the Start button at the bottom of the emulator to show the Start screen 
in the emulator. Explore the menus in the Windows Phone emulator.

someone with whom to discuss solutions and share the 
work. Go to Youtube.com and watch some videos on 
downloading and installing the Android SDK and using 
it to install a virtual Android device using the Android 
Emulator. Then do the work to use the Android SDK and 
the Android Emulator to emulate an Android device. To 
prove you have accomplished this feat, take a screen shot 
of your virtual Android device running on your computer 
and email it to your instructor. Write a one-page report of 
your experience and include in it five or six tips that you 
think would help a student through this project.

n the chapter, “Connecting To and Setting Up a Network,” you 
learned how to create and manage a network connection, and in 
the chapter, “Supporting Network Hardware,” you learned about 
networking hardware. This chapter focuses on using a network for 
client/server applications, for sharing files and folders with network 
users, and for providing cloud computing services.
Security is always a huge concern when dealing with networks. 
In this chapter, you learn how to share resources on the network and 
still protect these resources from those who should not have access. 
In the chapter, “Security Strategies,” we take security to a higher level 
and discuss many tools and techniques you can use to protect a  
computer or a SOHO network.

Windows Resources on a Network
Supporting Client/Server Applications
Resources available on a network might include network services, such as email or file storage, 
or applications hosted by a server and used by a client. Client/server applications you will 
likely be expected to support include Internet Explorer, Remote Desktop, and other remote 
applications. You also need to know how to use Group Policy to configure Quality of Service 
(QoS) for client/server applications and how to link a data source through a network to 
database applications. All of these skills are covered in this part of the chapter.
Network Servers
Recall from the chapter, “Connecting To and Setting Up a Network,” that a client computer 
contacts a server in order to request information or perform a task, such as when a web 
browser connects with a web server and requests a webpage. Many other types of server 
resources exist on a typical network. Some of these servers are standalone devices, but often 
multiple network services are provided by a single server computer, or servers might be embedded in 
other devices. For example, servers are sometimes embedded in router firmware (such as a SOHO router 
providing FTP services) or in an operating system (such as web server capabilities embedded in Windows 
Server 2012). Each time any of these components is updated, any legacy technology present on the network 
must be taken into consideration, which can result in a complex web of network server resources. Here’s a 
brief list of several popular client/server resources used on networks and the Internet:
	 Mail server. Email is a client/server application that involves two mail servers. Recall that SMTP is used 
to send email messages, and either POP3 or IMAP4 is used to deliver an email message to a client. An 
example of a popular email server application is Microsoft Exchange Server. Outlook, an application in 
the Microsoft Office suite of applications, is a popular email client application.
	 File server. A file server stores files and makes them available to other computers. A network 
administrator can make sure this data is backed up regularly and kept secure.
	 Print server. A print server manages network printers and makes them available to computers 
throughout the network. Expensive network printers can handle high-capacity print jobs from many 
sources, eliminating the need for a desktop printer at each workstation. If a network printer fails, a 
technician can sometimes diagnose and solve the problem from her workstation.
	 DHCP server. Recall from the chapter, “Connecting To and Setting Up a Network,” that a DHCP server leases 
an IP address to a computer when it first attempts to initiate a connection to the network and requests an IP 
address. The DHCP server is configured to pull from a range of IP addresses, which is called the DHCP scope.
	 DNS server. DNS servers, as you learned in the chapter, “Connecting To and Setting Up a Network,” 
store domain names and their associated IP addresses for computers on the Internet or a large enterprise 
network. DNS servers are responsible for name resolution, which happens when a client computer sends 
an FQDN (fully qualified domain name) to a DNS server and requests the IP address associated with 
this character-based name.

	 Proxy server. A proxy server is a computer that intercepts requests that a client, such as a browser, 
makes of another server, such as a web server. The proxy server substitutes its own IP address for the 
request using NAT protocols. An example of using a proxy server is when an ISP caches webpages 
to speed up requests for the same pages. After it caches a page, if another browser requests the same 
content, the proxy server can provide the content that it has cached. In addition, a proxy server 
sometimes acts as a gateway to the Internet, a firewall to protect the network, a filter for email, and to 
restrict Internet access by employees in order to force those employees to follow company policies.
Notes A telltale sign that the network’s DNS server is malfunctioning is when you can reach a website by its IP 
address, but not by its FQDN (fully qualified domain name).

	 Authentication server. An authentication server authenticates users or computers to the network so that 
they can access network resources. Active Directory, which is a directory service included in Windows 
Server, is often used for this purpose on a Windows domain. The authentication server stores user or device 
credentials, such as user names and passwords, validates an authentication request, and determines the 
permissions assigned to each user, device, or group.
	 Web server. A web server serves up webpages to clients. Many corporations have their own web 
servers, which are available privately on the corporate network. Other web servers are public, accessible 
from anywhere on the Internet. The most popular web server application is Apache (see apache.org), 
which primarily runs on UNIX or Linux systems and can also run on Windows. The second most 
popular web server is Internet Information Services (IIS), which is embedded in the Windows Server 
operating system.
Internet Explorer
By far, the most popular client/server applications on the Internet are a browser and web server. 
The latest release of Internet Explorer (IE) is version 11, although Windows 10 features a new 
browser called Microsoft Edge to replace Internet Explorer going forward. Windows 8.1 comes 
with IE version 11 installed, and earlier versions of Windows can upgrade to IE version 11 
using Windows Update. To upgrade, open Windows Update and find and install the Internet Explorer 11 
update. You can also go to the microsoft.com website and follow links to download and install IE11.
Here are some tips about using IE11:
	 Menu bar. Internet Explorer has a menu bar, which you can see by pressing the Alt key. The menu 
appears for a long enough time for you to make one selection from the menu. If you want the menu bar 
to be permanently visible, right-click a blank area in the title bar and check Menu bar in the shortcut 
menu (see Figure 17-1). Notice in Figure 17-1, you can also add the command bar to the IE window.
A+  
220-902 
1.5, 1.6
	 HTTP Secure. Some web servers use HTTP with the SSL or TLS protocols to secure transmissions 
to and from the web server. To find out if HTTP Secure (HTTPS) is being used in IE11, look for https 
and a padlock icon in the browser address box. Click the padlock to get information about the site 
security (see Figure 17-2).

	 Repair or disable. If you have a problem with IE11, use the same tools as you would for any 
Windows component to fix the problem, such as installing Windows updates, applying a restore point, 
or refreshing Windows 8. If you want to use a different browser, you can disable IE11. Open the 
Programs and Features window in Control Panel and click Turn Windows features on or off. In the 
Windows Features box, uncheck Internet Explorer 11 and click OK.
	 Internet Options box. Use the Internet Options box to manage Internet Explorer settings. To open the 
box, click the Tools icon on the right side of the IE title bar and click Internet options. Another method 
is to press Alt, which causes the menu bar to appear; then click Tools, Internet options. A third method 
is to click Internet Options in the Classic view of Control Panel. The Internet Options box appears. 
Whenever you make changes in the box, click Apply to apply these changes without closing the box. 
Alternately, you can click OK to save your changes and close the box.

Here’s what you can do using the General tab:
	 Change the home page or add a second home page tab. To add a second home page tab, insert the URL 
on a second line in the Home page area, as shown on the left side of Figure 17-3.
	 To protect your identity and surfing records, it’s a good idea to delete all your browsing history each 
time you use IE on a computer that is not your own. To delete this history, click Delete. In the Delete 
Browsing History box (see the right side of Figure 17-3), notice the item at the top. When you leave 
this item checked, any cookies used by websites in your Favorites list are not deleted. Select the items 
to delete and click Delete.
	 If you want to delete your browsing history each time you close Internet Explorer, check Delete 
browsing history on exit on the General tab.
	 Internet Explorer holds a cache containing previously downloaded content in case it is requested again. 
The cache is stored in several folders named Temporary Internet Files. To manage the IE cache, click 
Settings under Browsing history. The Website Data Settings box (called the Temporary Internet Files 
and History Settings box in Windows 7) appears, as shown in Figure 17-4. Use this box to change the 
maximum allowed space used for temporary Internet files and to control the location of these files.

Security Tab
Set the security level on the Security tab (see the left 
side of Figure 17-5). Medium-high is the default 
value, which prompts before downloading content 
and does not download ActiveX controls that are 
not signed by Microsoft. An ActiveX control is a 
small app or add-on that can be downloaded from 
a website along with a webpage and is executed 
by IE to enhance the webpage (for example, to 
add animation to the page). A virus can sometimes 
hide in an ActiveX control, but IE is designed to 
catch them by authenticating each ActiveX control 
it downloads. To customize security settings, click 
Custom level. In the Security Settings box (see the 
right side of Figure 17-5), you can decide exactly 
how you want to handle downloaded content. 
For example, you can disable file downloads.
Privacy Tab and Content Tab
Use the Privacy tab (see the left side of Figure 17-6) to block cookies that might invade your privacy or steal 
your identity. You can also use this tab to control the Pop-up Blocker, which prevents annoying pop-ups as 
you surf the web. To allow a pop-up from a particular website, click Settings and enter the URL of the website 
in the Pop-up Blocker Settings box (see the right side of Figure 17-6). Some pop-ups are useful, such as when 
you’re trying to download a file from a website and the site asks permission to complete the download.

The Content tab contains settings for Family Safety, certificates used by websites, and how AutoComplete

Connections Tab and Proxy Settings
The Connections tab allows you to configure proxy server settings and create a VPN connection. Many 
large corporations and ISPs use proxy servers to speed up Internet access. A web browser does not have 
to be aware that a proxy server is in use. However, one reason you might need to configure Internet 
Explorer to be aware of and use a proxy server is when you are on a corporate network and are having 
a problem connecting to a secured website (one using HTTP over SSL or another encryption protocol). 
The problem might be caused by Windows trying to connect using the wrong proxy server on the 
network. Check with your network administrator to find out if a specific proxy server should be used 
to manage secure website connections.
If you need to configure Internet Explorer to use a specific proxy server, on the Connections tab, click 
LAN settings. In the settings box, check Use a proxy server for your LAN and enter the IP address of the 
proxy server (see Figure 17-7). If your organization uses more than one proxy server, click Advanced and 
enter IP addresses for each type of proxy server on your network (see Figure 17-8). You can also enter a 
port address for each server. If you are trying to solve a problem of connecting to a server using HTTP 
over SSL or another secured protocol, enter the IP address of the proxy server that is used to manage 
secure connections in the Secure field of this box.

Find Lost Downloaded Files
Your friend is using Internet Explorer to send and receive email using her Hotmail account. She 
received a document attached to an email message from a business associate. She double-clicked the 
Word document listed as an attachment and spent a couple of hours editing it, saving the document 
as she worked. Then she closed the document. But where’s the document? When she later needed it, 
she searched her email account online and the Documents folder on her hard drive, but could not find the document. 
She called you in a panic asking you to help her find her lost document.
Internet Explorer keeps downloaded files in several folders named Temporary Internet Files. Search your hard 
drive and find as many of these folders as you can. How many Temporary Internet Files folders did you find and 
what is the exact path to each folder? One of these folders is certain to contain a lost downloaded document.

Remote Desktop Connection (RDC)
Remote Desktop Connection (RDC), commonly called Remote Desktop, gives a user access 
to a Windows desktop from anywhere on the Internet. As a software developer, I find Remote 
Desktop extremely useful when I work from a remote location (my home office) and need to 
access a corporate network to support software on that network. Using the Internet, I can access 
a file server on these secured networks to make my software changes. Remote Desktop is easy to use and 
relatively safe for the corporate network. To use Remote Desktop, the computer you want to remotely access 
(the server) must be running business or professional editions of Windows 8/7/Vista, but the computer you’re 
using to access it (the client) can be running any version of Windows.

In this section, you see how to set up Remote Desktop for first use, and then you learn how to use it.
How to Set Up Remote Desktop for First Use
The host or server computer is the computer that is serving up Remote Desktop to client computers 
that can remote in to the server. To prepare your host computer, you need to configure the computer 
for static IP addressing and also configure the Remote Desktop service. Here are the steps needed:
1.	 Configure the computer for static IP addressing. How to assign a static IP address is covered in the chapter, 
“Connecting to and Setting Up a Network.”
2.	 If your computer is behind a firewall, configure the router for port forwarding and allow incoming traffic on 
port 3389. Forward that traffic to the IP address of your desktop computer. You learned how to set up port 
forwarding in the chapter, “Connecting To and Setting Up a Network.”
3.	 To turn on the Remote Desktop service, open the System window and click Remote settings in the left pane. 
The System Properties box appears with the Remote tab selected (see the middle of Figure 17-12). In this 
window, you can control settings for Remote Assistance and Remote Desktop. In the Remote Desktop area,

You are now ready to test Remote Desktop.
How to Use Remote Desktop
Try to use Remote Desktop from another computer somewhere on your local network and make sure that works 
before testing the Remote Desktop connection from the Internet. On the client computer, you can start Remote 
Desktop to remote in to your host computer by using the command mstsc (which stands for Microsoft Terminal 
Services Client). Follow these steps to use Remote Desktop:
1.	 Enter the mstsc command in the Windows 8 Run box or the Windows 7 Search box. The Remote Desktop 
Connection box opens (see Figure 17-15).
2.	 Enter the IP address or the host name of the computer to which you want to connect. If you decide to use a 
host name, begin the host name with two backslashes, as in \\CompanyFileServer.
3.	 If you plan to transfer files from one computer to the other, click Show Options for Windows 8 or Options 
for Windows 7, and then click the Local Resources tab, as shown on the left side of Figure 17-16. Click More. 
The box on the right side of Figure 17-16 appears. Check Drives. Click OK. Click Connect to make the

Is your host computer as safe as it was before you set it to serve up Remote Desktop and enabled port 
forwarding to it? Actually, no, because a port has been opened, so take this into account when you decide 
to use Remote Desktop. In a project at the end of this chapter, you learn how you can take further steps 
to protect the security of your computer when using Remote Desktop. Alternately, you can consider using 
software that does not require you to open ports. Examples of this type of software, some of which are free, 
are TeamViewer (teamviewer.com), GoToMyPC by Citrix (gotomypc.com), and LogMeIn (logmein.com).

Remote Assistance
Remote Assistance differs from Remote Desktop in that a user on the server computer can 
remain signed in during the remote session, retains control of the session, and can see the 
screen. This is helpful when troubleshooting problems on a computer. The user who needs 
your help sends you an invitation by email or chat to connect to her computer using Remote 
Assistance. When you respond to the invitation, you can see the user’s desktop just as she sees it. And, if 
the user gives you permission, you can take control of her computer to change settings or do whatever else 
is needed to fix her problem or show her how to perform a task. Think of Remote Assistance as a way to 
provide virtual desk-side support.
There are several ways to initiate a Remote Assistance session:
	 The user saves an invitation file and then sends that file to the technician. The file can be sent by any 
method, including email, chat, or posting to a shared folder on the network.
	 The user can send an automated email through the Remote Assistance app. This option only works if 
the system is configured with a compatible email program.
	 The user can use Easy Connect, which is the easiest method to start a Remote Assistance connection but 
only works if both computers used for the connection support the Easy Connect feature. Easy Connect 
requires Windows 8/7. Also know that some routers don’t support the Peer Name Resolution Protocol 
(PNRP), which is the protocol Easy Connect uses to establish a Remote Assistance connection.
	 The technician can initiate a session. This method is the most difficult to use, requiring that Group 
Policies be applied on the technician’s computer.
To initiate a Remote Assistance connection from the host computer using Easy Connect, complete the 
following steps:
1. Open the System window and click Remote settings in the left pane. The System Properties box appears 
with the Remote tab selected (refer back to Figure 17-12).

assistance. (Alternately, you can press Win+S to open 
search and type Invite, then click Invite someone 
to connect to your PC and help you.) The Windows

4. Click Invite someone you trust to help you, then click Use Easy Connect. Remote Assistance provides a 
password for the user to give the technician in order to create the connection, as shown in Figure 17-22. 
If needed, the user can also create an invitation file using this window.
The technician can respond to the Easy Connect invitation 
by entering the password into Remote Assistance, as follows:
1. Launch Remote Assistance, as described in Step 3 above.
2. In the Windows Remote Assistance window (shown in 
Figure 17-21), click Help someone who has invited you, 
then click Use Easy Connect.
3. Enter the 12-character password (see Figure 17-23), which 
is not case sensitive, and click OK.
4. The user’s computer generates a warning box requesting 
permission for the technician’s computer to connect. The 
user clicks Yes to allow the connection. The user’s desktop 
turns black and the Remote Assistance management window 
appears. The technician’s computer opens the Windows

Here are some things you can do during a Remote Assistance session:
	 To open a chat session with the user, click the Chat icon. A chat pane appears in the Remote Assistance 
window on both desktops.
	 To ask the user if you can take control of her desktop, click Request control in the Remote Assistance 
control window. When the user accepts the request, you can control her computer. The user can stop 
sharing control by clicking Stop sharing.
	 The user can hide her desktop from you at any time by clicking Pause in the control window.
	 Either of you can disconnect the session by closing the control window.
	 A log file is kept of every Remote Assistance session in the C:\Users\username\Documents\Remote 
Assistance Logs folder. The file includes the chat session. If you type instructions during the chat session 
that will later help the user, she can use the log file to remind her of what was said and done.
	 If an invitation created by a user is not used within six hours, the invitation expires. This time frame 
can be changed by clicking Advanced in the Remote Assistance section on the Remote tab of the System 
Properties dialog box.
If you have problems making the connection, do the following:
1. Windows Firewall on the user’s computer might be blocking Remote Assistance. Verify that Remote 
Assistance is checked as an exception to blocked apps in the Windows Firewall window.
2. If you are outside the user’s local network, the hardware firewall protecting her network might be blocking 
Remote Assistance. Verify that port forwarding on that hardware firewall is enabled for Remote Assistance. 
Remote Assistance uses port 3389, the same port used by Remote Desktop.
Use Group Policy to Improve QoS for Applications
Group Policy (gpedit.msc) is a console available only in Windows professional and business 
editions (not home editions) that is used to control what users can do and how the system can 
be used. Group Policy works by making entries in the registry; applying scripts to Windows 
startup, shutdown, and sign-in processes; and affecting security settings. Policies can be applied 
to the computer or to a user. Computer-based policies are applied just before the sign-in screen appears, 
and user-based policies are applied after sign in.
Follow these steps to use Group Policy to set the QoS level for an application:
1. Enter the gpedit.msc command in the Windows 8 Run box or the Windows 7 Search box. The Group 
Policy console opens. On the left side of Figure 17-25, notice the two groups of policies are Computer 
Configuration and User Configuration. To apply a policy to all users, create it under Computer

Configuration. Also notice at the top of the list is Local Computer Policy, which means all policies 
apply only to the local computer.
2. In the Computer Configuration group, expand the Windows Settings group. Right-click Policy-based QoS 
and click Create new policy, as shown in Figure 17-25. A wizard opens to step you through the options 
for the policy (see Figure 17-26).
When creating a policy, here are important options that appear on different screens as you step through 
the wizard, but know you only need to use the ones that apply to your situation:
	 The priority level is determined by a DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) value, which is a number 
from 0 to 63. The higher the number, the higher the priority.
	 Outbound traffic can be throttled to limit the bandwidth assigned to an application.
	 The policy can apply to all applications or a specific program. (The program name must have an .exe 
file extension.)
	 You can specify the source IP address and/or destination IP address.
	 You can select the protocol (TCP or UDP) and port numbers for the policy.
	 When the wizard is finished, you are returned to the Group Policy console. Close the console. To apply 
the new policy, you can restart the computer or enter gpupdate.exe at a command prompt.
To get the most out of QoS, configure each router and computer on the network to use QoS.
ODBC Data Sources
As an IT technician, you might be called on to help set up a local computer on a corporate 
network to connect to a remote database stored on a company database server. For example, 
suppose Microsoft Access is installed on the local computer and you want to configure it 
to connect to a Microsoft SQL Server database on the server. Open Database Connectivity 
(ODBC) is the technology used to create the data source, which provides access to the database and 
includes the drivers required to interface between Access and the data (see Figure 17-27). Drivers for 
Microsoft SQL Server must be installed on the local computer (Windows has SQL drivers installed by 
default). Then you can use the ODBC Data Sources tool in the Administrative Tools group of Control 
Panel to configure the data source.

Controlling Access to Folders and Files
17
Now let’s turn our attention to managing another resource on the network: folders and files.
Controlling Access to Folders and Files
Responsibility for a small network can include controlling access to folders and files for 
users of a local computer and for remote users accessing shared resources over the network. 
Managing shared resources is accomplished by (1) assigning rights to user accounts and 
(2) assigning permissions to folders and files.

220-902 
1.2, 1.3, 
1.4, 1.5, 
1.6, 3.2, 
3.3, 3.4
Let’s first look at the strategies used for controlling rights to user accounts and controlling permissions 
to folders and files. Then you learn the procedures in Windows for assigning these rights and permissions.
Classify User Accounts and User Groups
Computer users should be classified to determine the rights they need to do their jobs. 
For example, some users need the right to sign in to a system remotely and others do 
not. Other rights granted to users might include the right to install software or hardware, 
change the system date and time, change Windows Firewall settings, and so forth. Generally, 
when a new employee begins work, that employee’s supervisor determines what rights the 
employee needs to perform his job. You, as the support technician, will be responsible to make sure the 
user account assigned to the employee has these rights and no more. This approach is called the principle 
of least privilege.
In Windows, the rights or privileges assigned to an account are established when you first create a user 
account, which is when you decide the account type. You can later change these rights by changing the user 
groups to which the account belongs. User accounts can be created from Control Panel (using any edition 
of Windows) or by using the Computer Management console (using business and professional editions of 
Windows). User accounts can be assigned to different user groups using the Computer Management console 
(using business and professional editions of Windows). (Home editions of Windows, therefore, cannot be 
used to manage user groups.)
Type of User Account
Recall from the chapter, “Survey of Windows Features and Support Tools,” that when you use Control 
Panel to manage user accounts, you can choose between two account types: Administrator or Standard. 
When you use Computer Management to create an account, the account type is automatically a 
standard user account. To create a user account using Computer Management, first open the Computer 
Management console (compmgmt.msc). Then right-click Users under Local Users and Groups and select

Notes If you don’t see the driver you need in the Create New Data Source box, close all windows and use Explorer 
to locate the C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Odbcad32.exe program file. When you double-click this file, the ODBC Data Source 
Administrator box appears and you can then access all ODBC drivers installed on the local computer.
Notes In Windows, the two terms, rights and permissions, have different meanings. Rights (also called privileges) 
refer to the tasks an account is allowed to do in the system (for example, installing software or changing the system 
date and time). Permissions refer to which user accounts or user groups are allowed access to data files and folders. 
Rights are assigned to an account, and permissions are assigned to data files and folders.

Built-in User Groups
A user account can belong to one or more user groups. Windows offers several built-in user groups and 
you can create your own. Here are important built-in user groups:
	 Administrators and Users groups. By default, administrator accounts belong to the Administrators 
group, and standard user accounts belong to the Users group. If you want to give administrator 
rights to a standard user account, use the Computer Management console to add the account to the 
Administrators group.
	 Guests group. The Guests group has limited rights on the system and is given a temporary profile that 
is deleted when the user signs out. Windows automatically creates one account in the Guests group 
named the Guest account, which is disabled by default.
	 Backup Operators group. An account in the Backup Operators group can back up and restore any files 
on the system regardless of its access permissions to these files.
	 Power Users group. Windows XP has a Power Users group that can read from and write to parts of the 
system other than its own user profile folders, install applications, and perform limited administrative 
tasks. Windows 8/7/Vista offers a Power Users group only for backward compatibility with XP to be 
used with legacy applications that were designed to work in XP.
To view user groups installed on a system, open the Computer Management console and click Groups 
under Local Users and Groups (see Figure 17-30).
New User in the shortcut menu. (Windows Home editions don’t include the Local Users and Groups 
option in the Computer Management console.) Enter information for the new user a nd click Create

To change the groups a user account is in, click Users. The list of user accounts appears in the right pane 
of the console window (see the left side of Figure 17-31). Right-click the user account and select Properties 
in the shortcut menu. On the user account Properties box, click the Member Of tab (see the middle of 
Figure 17-31). Click Add and enter the user group name. You must type the user group name exactly as it 
appears in the list of user groups that you saw earlier in the list of groups (see Figure 17-30). (Alternately, 
you can click Advanced, click Find Now, and select the group name from the list of groups that appears.) 
Click OK twice to close both boxes.
In addition to the groups you can assign to an account, Windows might automatically assign one of 
these built-in user groups to an account when it is determining permissions assigned to a file or folder:
	 The Authenticated Users group includes all user accounts that can access the system except the Guest 
account. These accounts include domain accounts (used to sign in to the domain) and local accounts 
(used to sign in to the local computer). The accounts might or might not require a password. When 
you create a folder or file that is not part of your user profile, by default, Windows gives access to all 
Authenticated Users.
	 The Everyone group includes the Authenticated Users group as well as the Guest account. When you share 
a file or folder on the network or to a homegroup, by default, Windows gives access to the Everyone group.

	 Anonymous users are those users who have not been authenticated on a remote computer. If you sign 
in to a computer using a local account and then attempt to access a remote computer, you must be 
authenticated on the remote computer. You will be authenticated if your user account and password 
match on both computers. If you signed in to your local computer with an account and password that 
do not match an account and password on the remote computer, you are considered an anonymous user 
on the remote computer. As an anonymous user, you might be allowed to use File Explorer or Windows 
Explorer to view shared folders and files on the remote computer, but you cannot access them.
Customized User Groups
Use the Computer Management console or the Local Users and Groups console (lusrmgr.msc) in business 
and professional editions of Windows to create and manage your own user groups. When managing several 
user accounts, it’s easier to assign permissions to user groups rather than to individual accounts. First create 
a user group and then assign permissions to this user group. Any user account that you put in this group 
then acquires these permissions.
User groups work especially well when several users need the same permissions. For example, you can set 
up an Accounting group and a Medical Records group for a small office. Users in the Accounting department 
and users in the Medical Records department go into their respective user groups. Then you only need to 
manage the permissions for two groups rather than multiple user accounts.
Methods to Assign Permissions to Folders and Files
There are three general strategies for managing shared files and folders, also called directories, 
in Windows:
A+  
220-902 
3.2, 3.3
	 Homegroup sharing. When all users on a network require the same access to all resources, 
you can use a Windows homegroup. Folders, libraries, files, and printers shared with the 
homegroup are available to all users on the network whose computers have joined the homegroup. You 
learned how to set up a homegroup in the chapter, “Survey of Windows Features and Support Tools.” 
After the homegroup is set up, to share a file or folder with the homegroup, use the Sharing Wizard. 
To do so, right-click the item and select Share with in the shortcut menu. The wizard lists three general 
options for sharing followed by a list of specific people (see Figure 17-32). Click Homegroup (view) 
or Homegroup (view and edit) to assign this permission to the homegroup.

To verify the item is shared, select the folder or file in Explorer and look for the two-person shared icon 
in the status bar (see Figure 17-33). Notice in the status bar the item is assigned to the Homegroup group.
Shared icon
Figure 17-33  A folder shared with the homegroup shows the two-person Shared icon in the 
status bar of File Explorer
	 Workgroup sharing. For better security than a homegroup, 
use workgroup sharing. With this method, you decide which 
users on the network have access to which shared folder 
and the type of access they have. All rights and permissions 
are set up on each local computer so that each computer 
manages access to its files, folders, and printers shared on 
this peer-to-peer network.
	 Domain controlling. If a Windows computer belongs to a 
domain instead of a workgroup or homegroup, all security 
is managed by the network administrator for the entire 
network.
In this chapter, we focus on workgroup sharing, which might 
use a file server. Here are some tips on which folders to use to 
hold shared data on a file server or personal computer:
	 Private data for individual users is best kept in the C:\Users folder for that user. User accounts with 
limited or standard privileges cannot normally access these folders belonging to another user account. 
However, accounts with administrative rights do have access.
	 The C:\Users\Public folder is intended to be used for folders and files that all users share. It is not 
recommended you use this folder for controlled access to data.
Figure 17-34  The Folder Options box shows 
the Sharing Wizard is enabled
Notes If the Sharing Wizard is disabled, the four sharing options shown in Figure 17-32 will not appear when you 
click Share with. To enable the Sharing Wizard, using Control Panel, open the Folder Options box and, on the View tab, 
select Use Sharing Wizard (Recommended). See Figure 17-34. If the Sharing Wizard is not used, you must use advanced 
sharing methods covered later in the chapter.

Windows Resources on a Network
	 For best security, create a folder not in the C:\Users folder and assign permissions to that folder and its 
subfolders. You can allow all users access or only certain users or user groups.
Some applications can be shared with others on the network. If you share a folder that has a program 
file in it, a user on another computer can double-click the program file and execute it remotely on his 
or her desktop. This is a handy way for several users to share an application that is installed on a single 
computer. However, know that not all applications are designed to work this way.
Using workgroup sharing, Windows offers two methods to share a folder over the network:
	 Share permissions. Share permissions grant permissions only to network users and these permissions do 
not apply to local users of a computer. Share permissions work on NTFS, FAT32, and exFAT volumes 
and are configured using the Sharing tab on a folder’s Properties box. Share permissions apply to a 
folder and its contents, but not to individual files.
	 NTFS permissions. NTFS permissions apply to local users and network users and apply to both folders 
and individual files. NTFS permissions work on NTFS volumes only and are configured using the Security 
tab on a file or folder Properties box. (The Security tab is missing on the Properties box of a folder or file 
on a FAT volume.)
Here are some tips when implementing share permissions and NTFS permissions:
	 If you use both share permissions and NTFS permissions on a folder, the most restrictive permission 
applies. For NTFS volumes, use only NTFS permissions because they can be customized better. For FAT 
volumes, your only option is share permissions.
	 If NTFS permissions are conflicting, for example, when a user account has been given one permission 
and the user group to which this user belongs has been given a different permission, the more liberal 
permission applies.
	 Permission propagation is when permissions are passed from parent to child. Inherited permissions 
are permissions that are attained from a parent object. For example, when you create a file or folder 
in a folder, the new object takes on the permissions of the parent folder.
	 When you move or copy an object to a folder, the object takes on the permissions of that folder. The 
exception to this rule is when you move (not copy) an object from one location to another on the same 
volume. In this case, the object retains its permissions from the original folder.

Create User Accounts with Data Access
Nicole is responsible for a peer-to-peer network for a medical doctor’s office. Four computers are 
connected to the small company network; one of these computers acts as the file server for the 
network. Nicole has created two classifications of data, Financial and Medical. Two workers (Nancy 
and Adam) require access to the Medical data, and two workers (Linda and Carlos) require access to 
the Financial folder. In addition, the doctor, Lucas, requires access to both categories of data. Here is what Nicole 
must do to set up the users and data:
1.	 Create folders named Financial and Medical on the file server. Create five user accounts, one each for Lucas, 
Nancy, Adam, Linda, and Carlos. All the accounts belong to the Windows standard user group. Create two user 
groups, Financial and Medical.
2.	 Using NTFS permissions, set the permissions on the Financial and Medical folders so that only the members of 
the appropriate group can access each folder.
3.	 Test access to both folders using test data and then copy all real data into the two folders and subfolders. 
Set up a backup plan for the two folders as you learned to do in the chapter, “Maintaining Windows.”
Let’s look at how each of these three steps is done.
Step 1: Create Folders, User Accounts, and User Groups
Follow these steps to create the folders, user accounts, and user groups on the file server computer that is using 
Windows 8/7 Professional:
1.	 Sign in to the system as an administrator.
2.	 Using an NTFS volume, create these two folders: C:\Medical and C:\Financial.
3.	 Open the Computer Management console or the Local Users and Groups console and create user accounts for 
Lucas, Nancy, Adam, Linda, and Carlos. The account types are automatically standard user accounts.
4.	 To create the Medical user group, right-click Groups under Local Users and Groups and select New Group in 
the shortcut menu. The New Group box appears. Enter the name of the group (Medical) and its description

Step 2: Set NTFS Folder Permissions for User Groups
Follow these steps to set the NTFS permissions for the two folders:
1.	 Open File Explorer or Windows Explorer, right-click the Medical folder, and select Properties in the shortcut 
menu. The Properties box for the folder appears.
2.	 Click the Security tab (see Figure 17-36). Notice in the box that Authenticated Users, SYSTEM, Administrators, 
and Users all have access to the C:\Medical folder. When you select a user group, the type of permissions 
assigned to that group appears in the Permissions area. Table 17-1 gives an explanation of the more significant 
types of permission. Note that the Administrators group has full control of the folder. Also notice the checks 
under Allow are dimmed. These permissions are dimmed because they have been inherited from the parent 
object. In this case, the parent object is Windows default settings.

4.	 Close the Advanced Security Settings box.
5.	 In the Medical Properties box, notice the permissions are now checked in black, indicating they are no longer 
inherited permissions and can be changed. Click Edit to change these permissions.
6.	 The Permissions box opens (see Figure 17-38). Select the Authenticated Users group and click Remove. Also 
remove the Users group. Don’t remove the SYSTEM group, which gives Windows the access it needs. Also, don’t 
remove the Administrators group. You need to leave that group as is so that administrators can access the data.
7.	 To add a new group, click Add. The Select Users or Groups 
box opens. Under Enter the object names to select, type 
Medical, as shown in Figure 17-39, and click OK. The 
Medical group is added to the list of groups and users for 
this folder.

Allow under Full control to give that permission to this 
user group. Click OK twice to close the Properties box.
9.	 Change the permissions of the C:\Financial folder so that 
Authenticated Users and Users are not allowed access and 
the Financial group is allowed full control.
Step 3: Test, Set Share Permissions, and Go Live
It’s now time to test your security measures. Do the following to 
test the NTFS permissions and implement your shared folders:
1.	 Test a user account in each user group to make sure the 
user can read, write, and delete in the folder he needs but 
cannot access the other folder. Put some test data in each 
folder. Then sign in to the system using an account you 
want to test and try to access each folder. Figure 17-40 
shows the box that appears when an unauthorized user 
attempts to access a local folder. When you click Continue, 
entering an administrator password in the resulting 
UAC box gives you access.
2.	 Now that NTFS permissions are set correctly for each local 
and network user, you are ready to allow access over the 
network. To do that, both NTFS and share permissions must 
allow network access. (Share permissions apply only to 
network access, not local access.) Best practice is to allow 
full access using share permissions and restrictive access 
using NTFS permissions. The most restrictive permissions 
apply. To allow full access using share permissions, click 
the Sharing tab of each folder’s properties box, and click 
Advanced Sharing.
3.	 In the Advanced Sharing box, if it is not already checked, 
check Share this folder. Then click Permissions. To add 
a new group, click Add. The Select Users or Groups box

opens. Under Enter the object names to select, type Everyone and click OK. The Everyone group is added to the 
list of groups and users for this folder.
4.	 With Everyone selected, check Allow under Full control to give that permission to the Everyone user group. 
Click OK twice and then close the Properties box.
5.	 Now that you have the security settings in place for one computer, go to each computer on the network and 
create the user accounts that will be using this computer. Then test the security and make sure each user 
can access or cannot access the \Financial and \Medical folders as you intend. Figure 17-41 shows the error 
message that appears when an unauthorized user attempts to access a network resource.
6.	 To access shared folders, you can drill down into the Network group in File Explorer or Windows Explorer. 
Another method is to type the computer name—as in \\Win8—in the address bar of the Explorer window  
(see Figure 17-42).
Figure 17-41  When a user is denied access to a network resource, there is no opportunity to

7.	 After you are convinced the security works as you want it to, copy all the company data to subfolders 
in these folders. Check a few subfolders and files to verify that each has the permissions that you expect. 
And don’t forget to put in place on the file server the backup procedures you learned about in the chapter, 
“Maintaining Windows.”

How to Use Share Permissions
Although you can mix NTFS permissions and share permissions on the same system, life is simpler if you use 
one or the other. For NTFS volumes, NTFS permissions are the way to go because they can be customized better 
than share permissions. However, you must use share permissions on FAT volumes. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Open the Properties box for the folder (Personnel in this case). Notice in Figure 17-45 the Security tab 
is missing because the folder is on a FAT volume. Select the Sharing tab and click Advanced Sharing. 
The Advanced Sharing box opens (see the right side of Figure 17-45).

2. Check Share this folder. Then click Permissions. The Permissions box opens (see the left side of 
Figure 17-46). Initially, the folder is shared with Everyone. Also notice that share permissions offer 
only three permission levels, Full Control, Change, and Read.
3. Click Add. The Select Users or Groups box appears (see the right side of Figure 17-46). Enter a user 
account or user group and click OK.
4. To delete the Everyone group, select it in the Permissions box and click Remove. Click OK to close each 
open box in turn.
Support and Troubleshoot Shared Folders and Files
You have just seen how to set up user groups and folder permissions assigned to these groups. If you have 
problems accessing a shared resource, follow these steps:
1. Windows might be able to solve the problem for you. In Control Panel, click Troubleshooting. 
The Troubleshooting window presents a list of troubleshooters for addressing problems in the 
categories of Programs, Hardware and Sound, Network and Internet, or System and Security. 
Click Access shared files and folders on other computers and walk through the Shared Folders 
troubleshooter.
2. Open the Network and Sharing Center. Make sure your network location is set to Private (Home or 
Work for Windows 7).
3. In the left pane, click Change advanced sharing settings. The Advanced sharing settings window opens 
(see Figure 17-47).

	 Select Turn on file and printer sharing.
	 If you want Windows to handle access to Homegroup resources, under HomeGroup connections, 
select Allow Windows to manage homegroup connections (recommended).
	 If you want to share the Public folder to the network, under All Networks, in the Public folder sharing 
section, select Turn on sharing so anyone with network access can read and write files in the Public folders.
	 If you want the added protection of requiring that all users on the network must have a valid user 
account and password on this computer, select Turn on password protected sharing.
After you have made your changes, click Save changes at the bottom of the window.

printer, which is accessed by each networked computer directly through the network.
Notes If you are using NTFS permissions along with less restrictive share permissions to share resources on a network, 
disable homegroup sharing, which can cause conflicts.

6. Verify the user account name and password on the remote computer match the user account and 
password on the host computer. If these accounts and passwords don’t match, the user is considered an 
anonymous user and is denied access to resources shared on the remote computer.
Here are a few tips about managing shared folders and files:
	 Use advanced permissions settings. If you need further control of the permissions assigned a user or 
group, click Advanced on the Security tab of a folder’s Properties box. The Advanced Security Settings 
box appears (see Figure 17-49a). You can see that the Medical user group was given full control. To 
change these permission details, double-click the user group. In this example, the Medical group is being 
edited. The Permission Entry box opens. On Windows 8 systems only, click Show advanced permissions 
(see Figure 17-49b).
	
Detailed permissions can now be changed. Notice that the right to delete subfolders and files has been 
set to Deny, and the right to delete the folder itself has been set to Deny. Click OK to close each box. 
The resulting change means that users of the Medical group cannot delete or move a file or folder. 
(They can, however, copy the file or folder.)

	 Manage permissions using the parent folder. When a subfolder is created, it is assigned the 
permissions of the parent folder. Recall that these inherited permissions appear dimmed, indicating 
they are inherited permissions. The best way to change inherited permissions is to change the 
permissions of the parent object. In other words, to change the permissions of the C:\Financial\
QuickBooks folder, change the permission of the C:\Financial folder. Changing permissions of a 
parent folder affects all subfolders in that folder.
	 Check the effective permissions. Permissions manually set for a subfolder or file can override 
inherited permissions. Permissions that are manually set are called explicit permissions. When a folder 
or file has inherited an explicit permission set, it might be confusing as to exactly which permissions are 
in effect. To know exactly which permissions for a file or folder are in effect, see the Advanced Security 
Settings box. (Look back at Figure 17-49a.) NTFS permissions are reported on the Permissions tab and 
share permissions are reported on the Share tab. Use the Effective Access tab (for Windows 7, the tab is 
called Effective Permissions) to get a detailed report of resources available to a particular user.
	 Take ownership of a folder. The owner of a folder always has full permissions for the folder. If you 
are having a problem changing permissions and you are not the folder owner, try taking ownership of 
the folder. To do that, click Advanced on the Security tab of the folder’s Properties box. The Advanced 
Security Settings box appears. Next to the name of the owner, click Change. The name of the new 
owner can then be entered (see Figure 17-50). Click Check Names to confirm the name is entered 
correctly and click OK twice.

	 Use only one workgroup. It is not necessary that all computers belong to the same workgroup in order 
to share resources. However, performance improves when they are all in the same workgroup.
	 Require passwords for all user accounts. Don’t forget that for best security, each user account needs 
a password. How to use Group Policy to require that all accounts have passwords is covered in the 
chapter, “Security Strategies.”
	 Use a mapped network drive. For the convenience of remote users, map network drives for shared 
folders that are heavily used. How to do that is coming up next.
How to Map a Network Drive or Network Printer
A network share is one of the most powerful and versatile methods of communicating over a 
network. A network share makes one computer (the client) appear to have a new hard drive, 
such as drive E, that is really hard drive space on another host computer (the server). The client 
computer creates and saves a shortcut associated with a drive letter that points to the host 
computer’s shared folder or drive. This is called mapping the drive. This client/server arrangement is managed 
by a Windows component, the Network File System (NFS), which makes it possible for files on the network 
to be accessed as easily as if they are stored on the local computer. NFS is a type of distributed file system 
(DFS), which is a system that shares files on a network. Even if the host computer uses a different OS, such 
as UNIX, the network share still functions. In addition to mapping a network drive, you can also map a 
network printer to a computer.

Notes When mapping a network drive, you can type the path to the host computer rather than clicking the 
Browse button to navigate to the host. To enter the path, in the Map Network Drive dialog box, use two backslashes, 
followed by the name of the host computer, followed by a backslash and the drive or folder to access on the host 
computer. For example, to access the Projects folder on the computer named Win8, enter \\Win8\Projects and then 
click Finish.
Notes A host computer might be in sleep mode or powered down when a remote computer attempts to make 
a mapped drive connection at startup. To solve this problem, configure the host computer for Wake-on-LAN.

Windows Resources on a Network
Recall from the chapter, “Optimizing Windows,” that you can connect a network printer to a server and the server 
can share the printer on the network. The Print Management console can be used to manage all shared printers on 
the network from a single workstation. You can also map a network printer directly to your computer, eliminating 
a print server or printer sharing from the process. Here’s how:
1.	 Open Control Panel in Classic view and click Devices and Printers. Click Add a printer and select the 
printer available on the network (see Figure 17-53). Make sure you select a printer that shows its IP address; 
otherwise, you are connecting to a computer that has shared the printer to the network. If the printer 
doesn’t show in the list, click The printer that I want isn’t listed, and enter the name of the printer or its 
IP address, and click Next.
Figure 17-53  Select a network printer identified by its IP address on the network
2.	 Select and download the printer drivers if necessary. Click Next. You can choose whether to make this your 
default printer, then click Finish.
If you have problems mapping to a network printer, download the printer drivers from the website of the printer 
manufacturer and follow the manufacturer’s directions to install the printer.
Hidden Network Resources and Administrative Shares
Sometimes your goal is to ensure that a folder or file is not accessible from the network or by 
other users, or is secretly shared on the network. When you need to protect confidential data 
from users on the network, you can do the following:
A+  
220-902 
1.6, 3.3
	 Disable File and Printer Sharing. If no resources on the computer are shared, use the 
Network and Sharing Center to disable File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks.
	 Hide a shared folder. If you want to share a folder, but don’t want others to see the shared folder in File 
Explorer or Windows Explorer, add a $ to the end of the share name in the Advanced Sharing box, as 
shown in Figure 17-54a. This shared and hidden folder is called a hidden share. Others on the network 
can access the folder only when they know its name. For example, if a folder’s share name is Projects$ 
on the computer named Fileserver, in order to access the folder, a user must enter \\Fileserver\Projects$

So far in this chapter, you have learned about folders and files on a computer that are shared with 
others on the network using local user accounts. These shares are called local shares. For computers that 
belong to a domain, you need to be aware of another way folders are shared, called administrative shares. 
Administrative shares are the folders that are shared by default that administrator accounts at the domain 
level can access. You don’t need to manually share these folders because Windows automatically does so 
by default. Two types of administrative shares are:
	 The %systemroot% folder. Enter the path \\computername\admin$ to access the %systemroot% folder 
(most likely the C:\Windows folder) on a remote computer in order to work with that computer’s system 
folders and files. For example, in Figure 17-55, the entry in the Explorer address bar is \\MJWestLenovo\
admin$. Windows requests that the user authenticate with an administrator account to access this 
administrative share. The admin$ administrative share is called the Remote Admin share.

1.	 Create a user account on Computer 1 named User1. In the My Documents folder for that account, 
create a folder named Folder1. Create a text file in the folder named File1. Edit the file and add the text 
Golden Egg.
2.	 On Computer 2, create a user account named User2. Try to read the Golden Egg text in File1 on Computer 1. 
What is the result?
3.	 Configure the computers so that User1 signed in to Computer2 can open File1 and edit the text Golden Egg, 
but User2 cannot view or access the contents of Folder1. List the steps you took to share and secure the folder 
and to test this scenario to make sure it works.
4.	 Now make the folder private so that it cannot be seen from Computer2 in File Explorer or Windows Explorer 
but it can be accessed if User1 knows the folder name. Describe how you did that.
Cloud Computing
At the beginning of this chapter, you learned about server resources available on a network, 
and throughout this chapter, you learned some ways of managing those resources. Not all of 
a network’s resources reside on the local network. Cloud computing is when a third-party

Caution
When supporting a workgroup, you might be tempted to share all the drives on all computers so that you 
can have easy access remotely. However, to use local shares in this way is not a good security practice. Don’t share the \
Windows folder or an entire drive or volume on the network. These local shares appear in everyone’s Explorer window. You 
don’t want your system files and folders exposed like this.

service or vendor makes computer resources available to its customers over the Internet. You’ve already 
learned about cloud storage services such as Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud Drive, and Google Drive. Cloud 
computing can also provide many other types of resources, including applications, network services, 
websites, database servers, specialized developer applications, or even entire operating systems.
Regardless of the service provided, all cloud computing service models incorporate the following elements:
	 Service at any time. On-demand service is available to users at any time. Cloud computing vendors 
often advertise uptime of their services, which is the percentage of time in any given year when their 
services were available online without disruption.
	 Elastic services and storage. Rapid elasticity refers to the service’s ability to be scaled up or down as the 
need level changes for a particular customer without requiring hardware changes that could be costly for 
the customer. Layers of services, such as applications, storage space, or number of users, can be added or 
removed upon request or automatically, depending upon the options made available by the service vendor.
	 Support for multiple client platforms. Platform refers to the operating system, the runtime libraries 
or modules the OS provides to applications, and the hardware on which the OS runs. Cloud resources 
are made available to clients through standardized access methods that can be used with a variety of 
platforms, such as Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X, on any number of devices, such as desktops, laptops, 
tablets, and smart phones from various manufacturers.
	 Resource pooling and consolidation. With resource pooling, services to multiple customers are hosted 
on shared physical resources, which are dynamically allocated to meet customer demand. Customers 
generally are not aware of where the physical devices providing cloud services are located geographically, 
which is called location independence.
	 Measured service. Resources offered by a cloud computing vendor, such as storage, applications, bandwidth, 
and other services, are measured, or metered, for billing purposes and/or for the purpose of limiting any 
particular customer’s use of that resource according to the service agreement. These measured services have 
reporting policies in place to ensure transparency between vendors and customers.
Cloud Computing Categories
Cloud computing service models are categorized by the types of services they provide. The 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a standard definition 
for each category, which varies by the division of labor implemented. For example, as shown 
on the left side of Figure 17-57, an organization is traditionally responsible for their entire 
network, top to bottom. 
In this arrangement, the 
organization has its own 
network infrastructure 
devices, manages its own 
network services and data 
storage, and purchases 
licenses for its own operating 
systems and applications. 
The other three cloud 
computing service models 
illustrated in Figure 17-57 
incrementally increase the 
amount of management 
responsibilities outsourced 
to cloud computing vendors. 
The following list describes 
these service models:

Windows Resources on a Network
	 IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). With IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), the customer rents hardware, 
including servers, storage, and networking, and can use these hardware services virtually. Customers are 
responsible for their own application installations, data management, and backup. In most situations, 
customers are also responsible for their own operating systems. For example, customers might install an 
OS on each virtual server provided by the vendor and use these servers to store data and host websites, 
email, DNS, or DHCP services, or install productivity software such as Microsoft Office for its employees. 
IaaS is ideal for fast-changing applications or to test software, or for startup businesses looking to 
save money by not having to invest in hardware. Examples of IaaS providers are Amazon Web Services  
(aws.amazon.com), Windows Azure (azure.windows.com), and Google Compute Engine (cloud.google.com).
	 PaaS (Platform as a Service). With PaaS (Platform as a Service), a customer rents hardware, operating 
systems, and some applications that might support other applications the customer may install. PaaS 
is popular with software developers who require access to multiple platforms during the development 
process. A developer can build and test an application on a PaaS virtual machine made available over 
the web and then throw out the machine and start over with a new one with a few clicks in his browser 
window. Applications a PaaS vendor might provide to a developer are tailored to the specific needs of 
the project, such as an application to manage a database of test data. Examples of PaaS services include 
Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure.
	 SaaS (Software as a Service). With SaaS (Software as a Service), customers rent hardware, operating 
systems, and applications specific to the customer’s needs. Applications are provided through an online 
user interface and are compatible with a multitude of devices and operating systems. Online email 
services, such as Gmail and Yahoo!, are good examples of SaaS. Google offers an entire suite of virtual 
software applications through Google Drive and their other embedded products. Except for the interface 
itself (the device and whatever browser software is required to access the website), the vendor provides 
every level of support from network infrastructure through data storage and application implementation.
	 XaaS (Anything as a Service or Everything as a Service). In the XaaS (Anything as a Service or 
Everything as a Service) model, the “X” represents an unknown, just as it does in algebra. Here, the 
cloud can provide any combination of functions depending on a customer’s exact needs.
Another SaaS implementation that doesn’t quite fit the official definition of SaaS is rentable software, 
or software by subscription. Many companies are moving toward this subscription model, such as Adobe 
and Microsoft. When you buy an annual subscription to Office 365, for example, you must still install 
the software on your own computer, which means you must provide your own hardware, including a 
functioning OS. However, the downloadable software is available in formats that are compatible with 
multiple OSs, and the license provides for installation on multiple devices. This particular SaaS also 
includes built-in data storage, if desired by the user, by connecting the licensed account with OneDrive, 
a virtual data storage service.
Use the Google Cloud Platform Service
Google Cloud Platform is an example of PaaS. To use the service, do the following:

Deployment Models for Cloud Computing
Cloud computing services are delivered by a variety of deployment models, depending on 
who manages the cloud and who has access to it. The main deployment models you are likely 
to encounter are:
A+  
220-902 
2.3
	 Public cloud. In a public cloud, services are provided over the Internet to the general public. 
Google or Yahoo! email services are examples of public cloud deployment.
	 Private cloud. In a private cloud, services are established on an organization’s own servers, or 
established virtually for a single organization’s private use. For example, an insurance company 
might have a centralized data center that provides cloud services in a private cloud to branch offices 
throughout the United States.
	 Community cloud. In a community cloud, services are shared between multiple organizations, but not 
available publicly. Organizations with common interests, such as government regulatory requirements, 
might share resources in this way. For example, a medical database might be made accessible to all 
hospitals in a geographic area. In that case, the community cloud could be hosted internally by one 
or more of the organizations involved, or hosted by a third-party provider.

	 Hybrid cloud. A hybrid cloud is a combination of public, private, and community clouds used by 
the same organization. For example, a company might store data in a private cloud, but use a public 
cloud email service.
In today’s world, cloud computing is deeply integrated into nearly every user’s experience of productivity 
or entertainment technology. With all its strengths and flexibility, privacy and security continue to be high-
priority concerns when using cloud computing resources. You’ll learn more about how to address security 
concerns in the chapter “Security Strategies.”
>> Chapter Summary
Supporting Client/Server Applications
	 A client computer contacts a server to request information or to perform a task. Examples of network 
servers are a mail server, file server, print server, DHCP server, DNS server, proxy server, authentication 
server, and web server.
	 The Internet Options dialog box is used to manage many Internet Explorer settings. Proxy settings are 
managed using the Connections tab, and add-ons are managed using the Programs tab.
	 Remote Desktop gives you access to your Windows desktop from anywhere on the Internet. Remote 
Assistance lets you provide remote support to users. To turn on Remote Desktop Services, use the 
Remote tab on the System Properties box. The service listens at port 3389.
	 A policy can be set using Group Policy to improve Quality of Service (QoS) for an application so that it 
gets a higher priority on the network.
	 Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) can create a data source, which provides a remote database 
and its drivers to a client computer.
Controlling Access to Folders and Files
	 Controlling access to folders and files on a network is done by assigning rights to user accounts and 
assigning permission to folders and files.
	 Apply the principle of least privilege when assigning rights to users. You can change the rights an 
account has by adding it to or removing it from a user group.
	 Customized user groups that you create make it easier to manage rights to multiple user accounts.
	 Three ways to share files and folders on the network are to use homegroup sharing, workgroup 
sharing, and domain controllers. With workgroup sharing, you can use share permissions and/or 
NTFS permissions.
	 A mapped network drive makes it easier for users to access drives and folders on the network.
	 Peer-to-peer networks use local shares, and a Windows domain supports administrative shares.  
You can also hide network resources so that a user must know the name of the resource to access it.
Cloud Computing
	 Cloud computing is providing computing resources over the Internet to customers.
	 Cloud computing service models, including IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and XaaS, are categorized by the types 
of services they provide and the degree that a third-party service or vendor is responsible for the 
resources.

Reviewing the Basics
	 A public cloud service is available to the public, and a private cloud service is kept on an organization’s 
own servers or made available by a vendor only for a single organization’s private use. A community 
cloud is shared between multiple organizations, and a hybrid cloud is any combination of these 
service models.

office computer as well as the entire corporate network are as safe as possible. One way you can help 
Jacob add more security is to change the port that Remote Desktop uses. Knowledgeable hackers know 
that Remote Desktop uses port 3389, but if you change this port to a secret port, hackers are less likely 
to find the open port. Search the Microsoft Knowledge Base articles (support.microsoft.com and technet.
microsoft.com) for a way to change the port that Remote Desktop uses. Practice implementing this 
change by doing the following:
1.		 Set up Remote Desktop on a computer using Windows 8 Professional or Windows 7 Professional or 
Ultimate. This computer is your host computer. Use another computer (the client computer) to create 
a Remote Desktop session to the host computer. Verify the session works by transferring files in both 
directions.
2.		 Next, change the port that Remote Desktop uses on the host computer to a secret port. Print a screen 
shot showing how you made the change. Use the client computer to create a Remote Desktop session 
to the host computer using the secret port. Print a screen shot showing how you made the connection 
using the secret port. Verify the session works by transferring files in both directions.
3.		 What secret port did you use? What two or more Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles gave you the 
information you needed?

Chrome Remote Desktop by Google lets users sign in to remote computers through a Chrome browser. 
This blend of cloud computing technology and remote desktop access can be handy when you need to 
support computers that use operating systems other than Windows. Complete the following steps to install 
and use Chrome Remote Desktop:
1.		 On Computer 1, download and install Google Chrome, and sign in. Then add the Chrome Remote 
Desktop add-in.
2.		 Configure Chrome Remote Desktop to allow access to your computer over the Internet. Run the Chrome 
Remote Desktop Host Installer after it is downloaded. Be sure to record your PIN in a safe place.
3.		 On Computer 2, download and install Google Chrome, and sign in. Then add the Chrome Remote 
Desktop add-in.
4.		 Configure Chrome Remote Desktop to allow access to your computer over the Internet. Run the Chrome 
Remote Desktop Host Installer after it is downloaded. Be sure to record your PIN in a safe place.
5.		 Use Chrome Remote Desktop to create a remote connection to Computer 2. Can you use the utility 
to view the desktop of Computer 2? Can you control Computer 2 from Computer 1? Can you control 
Computer 2 directly from its own desktop? What options are available from the Remote Desktop 
menu on Computer 1?
6.		 What other operating systems will Chrome Remote Desktop work with?
7.		 List three reasons why a user might find Chrome Remote Desktop useful. Be sure to consider the 
advantages of using it with Google Cloud Platform.

Security Strategies
I
n the chapter, “Windows Resources on a Network,” you learned 
the concepts and principles of classifying users and data and pro-
tecting that data by applying appropriate permissions to the data 
so that only the authorized users can access it. In this chapter, you 
learn about additional tools and techniques to secure the resources 
on a personal computer, mobile device, and small network. You also 
learn how to recognize that a personal computer or mobile device is 
infected with malware and how to clean an infected system and keep 
it clean. Finally, you learn about how your employer might expect you 
to deal with issues of software copyright infringement and when com-
pany policies are violated regarding prohibited content and activities.
This chapter gives you the basics of securing a personal computer, 
mobile device, or small network. Later in your career as a support 
technician, you can build on the skills of this chapter to implement even 
more security such as controlling how Windows stores its passwords. 
However, keep in mind that even the best security will eventually fail. 
As a thief once said, “Locks are for honest people,” and a thief will 
eventually find a way to break through. Security experts tell us that 
security measures basically make it more difficult and time consuming 
for a thief to break through so that she gets discouraged and moves on 
to easier targets.

Security Strategies
Securing a Windows Personal Computer
When you have a choice in the security measures that you use, keep in mind two goals, 
which are sometimes in conflict. One goal is to protect resources, and the other goal is to not 
interfere with the functions of the system. A computer or network can be so protected that 
no one can use it, or so accessible that anyone can do whatever they want with it. The trick is 
to provide enough security to protect resources while still allowing users to work unhindered 
(Figure 18-1). Also, too much security can sometimes force workers to find insecure alternatives. For 
example, if you require users to change their passwords weekly, more of them might start writing their 
passwords down to help remember them.

how users work

Notes The best protection 
against attacks is layered protection. 
If one security method fails, the 
next might stop an attacker. When 
securing a workstation, use as many 
layers of protection as is reasonable 
for the situation and are justified by 
the value of the resources you are 
protecting.
Use Windows to Authenticate Users
Recall from the chapter, “Windows Resources on a Network,” that controlling access to computer 
resources is done by authenticating and authorizing a user or process. A user is authenticated 
when he proves he is who he says he is. Recall that when a computer is on a Windows domain, 
the domain is responsible for authentication. For a peer-to-peer network, authentication must 
happen at the local computer. Normally, Windows authenticates a user with a Windows password.
As an administrator, when you first create an account, be sure to assign a password to that account. 
It’s best to give the user the ability to change the password at any time. As an administrator, you can 
control how a user signs in, require a workstation be locked when the user steps away, disable the guest 
account, and reset a password if a user forgets it. Now let’s see how to do all these chores to bring added 
security to a Windows computer.
Require Secure Sign-in
Normally, when a computer is first booted or comes back from a sleep state, Windows displays a lock 
screen that can be dismissed by pressing a key on the keyboard or clicking anywhere on the screen, which 
then takes the user to the sign-in screen showing all active user accounts (see Figure 18-2). From here, a 
user clicks his account name and enters his password. Malware can sometimes display a false sign-in screen 
to trick users into providing user account passwords. A more secure method of sign in, called secure sign in 
or secure logon, requires the user to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete to get to a sign-in screen.

Lock a Workstation
To keep a system secure, users need to practice the habit of locking down their workstation each time 
they step away from their desks. The quickest way to do this is to press Win+L. Another method is to 
press Ctrl+Alt+Delete. If the user is already signed in when she presses these keys, the security screen in 
Figure 18-5 appears. When the user clicks Lock (Lock this computer in Windows 7), Windows locks down. 
To unlock Windows, the user must enter her password. For this method to be effective, all user accounts 
need a password. Later in the chapter, you learn to use Group Policy to make passwords a requirement.

Require a Password to Wake a Computer
An unauthorized user might get access to a system when you step away from your workstation and 
forget to lock it. To better secure the workstation, you can activate the screen saver (turn off the 
display) after a short period of inactivity and require a password be used to turn on the display 
and wake up the computer. Follow these steps:
1.	 In Control Panel, click Power Options.
2.	 In the Power Options window (see Figure 18-6), set the power options so that the computer goes to sleep

Disable the Guest Account
The Guest account is disabled by default and should remain disabled. If you want to set up an account for 
visitors, create a standard account and name it Visitor. To make sure the Guest account is disabled, open 
Control Panel in Classic view, click User Accounts, and then click Manage another account. Respond to the 
UAC if necessary. In the list of accounts, verify the Guest account is turned off. If it is not, click it and click 
Turn off the guest account (see Figure 18-8).
Notes A user might forget a password and, as an administrator, you can reset the password. However, know that resetting 
a password locks the user out from encrypted files, email, or personal certificates saved on the computer and from using 
Internet or network passwords stored on the computer. For business editions of Windows, use the Local Users and Groups 
(lusrmgr.msc) utility to reset a password. For all editions of Windows, use the netplwiz command or Control Panel. 
Figure 18-8  For best security, turn off the Guest account
Create Strong Passwords
A password needs to be a strong password, which means it should not be easy to guess either by humans 
or by computer programs using various methods, including a simple brute force attack, which tries every 
single combination of characters until it discovers your password.
A strong password, such as y*3Q1693pEWJaTz1!, meets all of the following criteria:
	 Use 16 or more characters, which is the best protection against a password attack.
	 Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
	 Use at least one symbol in your password.
	 Don’t use consecutive letters or numbers, such as “abcdefg” or “12345.”
	 Don’t use adjacent keys on your keyboard, such as “qwerty.”
	 Don’t use your sign-in name in the password.
	 Don’t use words in any language. Don’t even use numbers or symbols for letters (as in “p@ssw0rd”) 
because programs can easily guess those as well.
	 Don’t use the same password for more than one system.
Studies have proven that the most secure technique of those listed above is the length of the password. 
Passwords of 16 characters or more that use letters, numbers, and symbols are the most difficult to crack.
Notes How secure is your password? Go to howsecureismypassword.net and find out how long it will take a computer 
to crack your password.

In some situations, a blank Windows password might be more secure than an easy-to-guess password such 
as “1234.” That’s because you cannot authenticate to a Windows computer from a remote computer unless 
the user account has a password. A criminal might be able to guess an easy password and authenticate 
remotely. For this reason, if your computer is always sitting in a protected room such as your home office 
and you don’t intend to access it remotely, you might choose to use no password. However, if you travel 
with a laptop, always use a strong password.
Although it’s not recommended you write your password down, if you do write it down, keep it 
in as safe a place as you would the data you are protecting. Don’t send your passwords over email 
or chat. Change your passwords regularly, and don’t type your passwords on a public computer. For 
example, computers in hotel lobbies or Internet cafés should only be used for web browsing—not 
for signing in to your email account or online banking account. These computers might be running 
keystroke-logging software put there by criminals to record each keystroke. Several years ago, while 
on vacation, I entered credit card information on a computer in a hotel lobby in a foreign country. 
Months later, I was still protesting $2 or $3 charges to my credit card from that country. Trust me. 
Don’t do it—I speak from experience.
Explore Password Management Software
Password management software, also called password vault software, such as KeePass (keepass.info), LastPass 
(­lastpass.com), and Dashlane (dashlane.com), can hold your passwords safely so that you don’t forget them or have 
to write them down. Choose two of these programs and a third of your own selection that interests you, then answer 
the following questions about each one:
1.	 Which platforms are supported?
2.	 Which web browsers are supported?
3.	 From how many competitors can the program import passwords?
4.	 What types of authentication are supported (e.g., master password, fingerprint, etc.)?
5.	 Where are the passwords stored? Are they synced across devices? How is the information protected?
6.	 What are some of the differences between the free edition of each program and the paid versions?
7.	 What happens to the user’s account if the user dies or is otherwise incapacitated?

File and Folder Encryption
In Windows, files and folders can be encrypted using the Windows Encrypted File System 
(EFS). This encryption works only with the NTFS file system and business and professional 
editions of Windows. If a folder is marked for encryption, every file created in the folder or 
copied to the folder will be encrypted. An encrypted file remains encrypted if you move it from 
an encrypted folder to an unencrypted folder on the same or another NTFS volume. To encrypt a folder or 
file, right-click it and open its Properties box (see Figure 18-9). On the General tab, click Advanced. In the 
Advanced Attributes box, check Encrypt contents to secure data and click OK. In File Explorer or Windows 
Explorer, encrypted file and folder names are displayed in green.

Windows Firewall Settings
Recall from the chapter, “Connecting To and Setting Up a Network,” that a SOHO router 
can serve as a hardware firewall to protect its network from attack over the Internet. Recall 
that the best protection from attack is layered protection (see Figure 18-10). In addition to 
a network hardware firewall, a large corporation might use a software firewall, also called a 
corporate firewall, installed on a computer that stands between the Internet and the network 
to protect the network. This computer has two network cards installed, and the installed software firewall 
filters the traffic between the two cards.

A personal firewall, also called a host firewall or application firewall, is software installed on a personal 
computer to protect this computer. A personal firewall provides redundant protection from attacks over the 
Internet and also filters inbound traffic to protect a computer from attack from other computers on the same 
network and filters outbound traffic to prevent attacks on other computers on the same network. When  
setting up a SOHO network or a personal computer, configure a personal firewall on each computer.
Windows Firewall is a personal firewall that protects a computer from intrusion and from attacking 
other computers, and is automatically configured when you set up your security level for a new network 
connection. (Recall that, for Windows 8, the options are private and public security, and for Windows 7, 
the options are home, work, and public security.) However, you might want to customize these settings. 
For example, recall from the chapter, “Windows Resources on a Network,” that you customized Windows 
Firewall to allow access through Remote Desktop connections.

220-902 
1.4, 3.4
1.	 Sign in to Windows using an administrator account on a system using Windows 8/8.1 Professional 
or Enterprise, or Windows 7 Professional, Ultimate, or Enterprise.
2.	 To start Group Policy, use the gpedit.msc command in the Windows 8 Run box or in the Windows 7 Search 
box. The Local Group Policy Editor console opens.
3.	 To change a policy, first use the left pane to drill down into the appropriate policy group and then use the 
right pane to view and edit a policy. Here are important security policies you might want to change:
	Change default user names. A hacker is less likely to hack into the built-in Administrator account or Guest 
account if you change the names of these default accounts. To change the name of the Administrator account, 
drill down in the Computer Configuration, Windows Settings, Security Settings, Local Policies, Security 
Options group (see the left side of Figure 18-15). In the right pane, double-click Accounts: Rename 
administrator account. In the Properties box for this policy (see the right side of Figure 18-15), change the 
name and click OK. To change the name of the Guest account, use the policy Accounts: Rename guest account.
Figure 18-15  Use Group Policy to rename a default user account
Notes The Properties box for many policies offers the Explain tab. Use this tab to read more about a policy 
and how it works.
	Require user passwords. To require that all user accounts have passwords, drill down to the Computer 
Configuration, Windows Settings, Security Settings, Account Policies, Password Policy group (see the left 
side of Figure 18-16). Use the Minimum password length policy and set the minimum length to six or eight 
characters (see the right side of Figure 18-16). Additionally, reduce the password expiration time frame so users 
must create new passwords frequently. Use the Maximum password age policy to require users to reset their 
password every 60 days. (Best practice is to set the Maximum password age in the range of 30 to 90 days.)

	Set failed logon restrictions. Windows can be configured to lock a user account if too many incorrect 
logons  are attempted. Drill down to the Computer Configuration, Windows Settings, Security Settings, 
Account Policies, Account Lockout Policy group. Use the Account lockout threshold to set the number of 
invalid logon attempts. When the number is exceeded, the account will be locked.
	Restrict logon hours. In many cases, users should only be allowed access to a workstation during specific 
hours, such as during office hours. Preventing access at other times of the day and throughout the weekend 
can increase a workstation’s security. The schedule for a user’s or group’s logon hours is set through Active 
Directory, but individual workstations can be configured to respond differently once a user’s logon hours 
have expired. To configure a workstation’s response to the expiration of a user’s logon hours, drill down to 
the User Configuration, Administrative Templates, Windows Components, Windows Logon Options 
group. Use the Set action to take when logon hours expire policy to choose Lock, Disconnect, or Logoff. 
If this policy is not enabled, the user’s session will continue, but the user will not be able to log on outside 
of the assigned logon hours once the current session has been terminated.
	Disable Microsoft account resources. Recall that a Microsoft account is a single sign-on (SSO) account, 
which means it provides authentication to multiple services and resources. When a user signs in to a Windows 
8 computer with a Microsoft account, she has access to online resources such as OneDrive and OneNote and 
can sync settings on this computer with other computers that use this same Microsoft account. Settings 
include Start screen tiles, desktop personalization, installed apps and app settings, web browser favorites, and 
passwords to apps, websites, and networks. (To see the settings you can sync when using a Microsoft account, 
in the charms bar, click Settings, click Change PC settings, click OneDrive, and click Sync settings.)
	
Depending on your company’s policy, you might need to restrict access to online resources and syncing 
settings that are linked to a user’s Microsoft account. To disable OneDrive, for example, drill down to 
Computer Configuration, Administrative Templates, Windows Components, OneDrive group. Use the 
Prevent the usage of OneDrive for file storage policy. Enable this policy to prevent users and programs 
from accessing OneDrive. Additionally, in the Windows Components submenu, click the Sync your 
settings group and use these policies to disable syncing apps, app settings, passwords, and other Windows 
settings (see Figure 18-17).

Security Strategies
	Audit logon failures. Group Policy offers several auditing policies that monitor and log security events. 
These Security logs can then be viewed using Event Viewer. For example, to set an audit policy to monitor 
a failed logon event, drill down to the Computer Configuration, Windows Settings, Security Settings, 
Local Policies, Audit Policy group. Use the Audit logon events policy. You can audit logon successes 
and failures. To keep the log from getting too big, you can select Failure to only log these events.
	Disable logon and shutdown scripts. Policies can run scripts for the computer or user during logon or 
shutdown. These scripts can contain programs, which might contain malware. To manage logon scripts, in 
the Computer Configuration or User Configuration group, drill down to the Administrative Templates, 
System, Logon group. Use the Run these programs at user logon policy. To manage shutdown scripts, 
drill down to the Administrative Templates, System, Scripts group. For a list of folders where Group Policy 
stores these scripts, see the appendix, “Entry Points for Windows Startup Processes.”
	Disable AutoRun and AutoPlay. When attaching a USB flash drive or external hard drive, or inserting a 
disc in the optical drive, Windows automatically accesses the storage media and then requests instructions 
on what to do next. Media files can be played automatically, which is called AutoPlay. Executable files can 
be run automatically, which is called AutoRun. You can disable both of these features to add yet another 
layer of security protection. To disable AutoPlay, drill down to Computer Configuration, Administrative 
Templates, Windows Components, AutoPlay Policies group. Enable the Turn off Autoplay policy. To 
disable AutoRun, enable the Set the default behavior for AutoRun and use the Disabled option.
4.	 When you finish setting your local security policies, close the Local Group Policy Editor console. To put into 
effect the changes you have made, reboot the system or enter the command gpupdate.exe in a command 
prompt window. The gpupdate command refreshes local group policies as well as group policies set in Active 
Directory on a Windows domain.
Figure 18-17  Restrict SSO authentication to online resources associated with a Microsoft account
Notes Sometimes policies overlap or conflict. To find out the resulting policies for the computer or user that are 
currently applied to the system, you can use the gpresult command in a command prompt window with parameters.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220–902 exam expects you to know about the features, benefits, and drawbacks of BitLocker 
Drive Encryption and BitLocker To Go.
The three ways you can use BitLocker Drive Encryption depend on the type of protection you need and 
the computer hardware available:
	Computer authentication. Many laptop computers have a chip on the motherboard called the TPM 
(Trusted Platform Module) chip. The TPM chip holds the BitLocker encryption key (also called the 
startup key). If the hard drive is stolen from the laptop and installed in another computer, the data 
would be safe because BitLocker would not allow access without the startup key stored on the TPM 
chip. Therefore, this method authenticates the computer. However, if the motherboard fails and is 
replaced, you’ll need a backup copy of the startup key to access data on the hard drive. (You cannot 
move the TPM chip from one motherboard to another.)
	User authentication. For computers that don’t have TPM, the startup key can be stored on a USB flash 
drive (or other storage device the computer reads before the OS is loaded), and the flash drive must be 
installed before the computer boots. This method authenticates the user. For this method to be the most 
secure, the user must never leave the flash drive stored with the computer. (Instead, the user might keep 
the USB startup key on his key ring.)
	Computer and user authentication. For best security, a password can be required at every startup in 
addition to TPM. Using this method, both the computer and the user are authenticated. This practice 
is an example of multifactor authentication (MFA), which uses more than one method to authenticate.

870
Security Strategies
BitLocker Drive Encryption provides great security, but security comes with a price. For instance, you 
risk the chance your TPM will fail or you will lose all copies of the startup key. In these events, recovering 
the data can be messy. Therefore, use BitLocker only if the risks of BitLocker giving problems outweigh the 
risks of stolen data. And, if you decide to use BitLocker, be sure to make extra copies of the startup key 
and/or password and keep them in a safe location.
For detailed instructions on how to set up BitLocker Drive Encryption, see the Microsoft Knowledge 
Base “BitLocker Overview” article hh831713 at technet.microsoft.com.
Use UEFI/BIOS Features to Protect the System
Many motherboards for desktop and laptop computers offer several UEFI/BIOS security 
features, including UEFI secure boot, power-on passwords, support for intrusion-detection 
devices, and support for a TPM chip. Power-on passwords include a supervisor password 
(required to change UEFI/BIOS setup), user password (required to use the system or view 
UEFI/BIOS setup), and a drive lock password (required to access the hard drive). The drive lock password 
does not require a TPM chip and is stored on the hard drive so that it will still control access to the drive

Securing a Mobile Device
Smart phones and tablets are with us everywhere, and most of us keep much personal and 
professional information on our smart phones. In the chapter, “Supporting Mobile Operating 
Systems,” you learned about a lot of the features on smart phones and tablets that make  
the data on them more accessible. In this chapter, you learn how to make that information 
more secure. Here’s a list of what might be stored on a smart phone or tablet that would be at risk if the 
device is lost, stolen, or damaged:
	Data kept by apps can reveal much about our lives. Consider data kept on these iPhone and Android 
apps: Email, calendar, call logs, voice mail, text messages, Dropbox, iCloud Drive, Google Maps, 
Hangouts, Gmail, QuickMemo, YouTube, Amazon, Facebook, Videos, Photos, Notes, Contacts, and 
web browsers (bookmarks and browsing history).
	Videos and photos we have taken might reveal private information and be tagged with date and time 
stamps and GPS locations.
	Network connection settings, including Wi-Fi security keys, email configuration settings, user names, and 
email addresses.
	Purchasing patterns and history as well as credit card information might be stored—or at least accessible 
for use—in mobile payment apps, apps developed by our favorite retailers, or through membership card 
databases.
To keep your data safe, consider controlling access to your devices and consider what apps you 
can use to protect the data. These methods are discussed in this part of the chapter along with BYOD 
(Bring Your Own Device) policies that might be used in an enterprise environment to secure corporate 
data stored on a device.

Device Access Controls
Because smart phones and tablets are so mobile, they get stolen more often than other types of 
computers. Therefore, protecting data on a mobile device is especially important. Consider the 
following lock methods to control access to the device:
	Android screen lock. A screen lock requires the correct input to unlock the device. Android devices 
provide a variety of options, as shown in Figure 18-19a. As the complexity of a lock code increases, 
so does the security of the device:
	Swipe. Swipe your finger across the screen to unlock the device (not very secure but will prevent a 
pocket dial).
	Knock code. Requires a pattern of taps on the screen.
	Pattern. Requires a pattern to be drawn along dots on the screen (see Figure 18-19b).
	PIN. Requires a numerical code, which is similar to iOS’s passcode.
	Password. Requires an alphanumeric code with letters and/or numbers.
	Face lock. Uses the device’s camera to perform facial recognition (this option is not available on the 
device shown in Figure 18-19a).
	
Some devices have different features that can still be accessed from the lock screen, such as emergency 
calls, weather information, a virtual assistant, or the camera app. A device might even let you post contact 
info, such as a friend’s phone number, on the lock screen in case the device is lost and someone tries to 
return it. Thankfully, not everyone is a bad guy. Don’t include the person’s name with their phone number. 
Make sure they’re informed and you have their permission to use their phone number for this purpose.

	 For best security, on the Touch ID & Passcode screen, turn off Simple Passcode so you can enter a 
strong password for your device and set Require Passcode to Immediately. Yes, both these features are 
annoying, but necessary for best security.
Notes In the chapter, “Supporting Mobile Operating Systems,” you learned how to recover from a system lockout 
when the screen lock prevents access to your device.
	Biometric authentication. A biometric device is an input device that collects biological data about a 
person, which can identify a person’s fingerprints, handprints, face, voice, retinal, iris, and handwritten 
signatures. Touch ID on an iPhone is one example of biometric authentication (see Figure 18-20b), as is 
the face lock on an Android phone. Iris scanners and voice recognition are other options for some devices.
	Full device encryption. Encrypting a device’s data makes the data essentially useless to a thief. However, 
encryption might slow down device performance and the data is only as safe as the strength of the 
password keeping the data encrypted. Both Android and iOS devices offer full device encryption. With 
iOS, data is automatically encrypted when you set a screen lock password. To verify encryption, open 
the Settings app, tap Passcode, and then enter your passcode. At the bottom of the screen, verify Data 
protection is enabled, as shown in Figure 18-20a.
	Restrict iOS failed login attempts. When you set a screen lock, you can specify that data be erased after 
so many failed login attempts. For example, look back at Figure 18-20a to see near the bottom of the 
screen that if Erase Data is turned on, 10 failed login attempts causes all data on the device to be erased.
	
After five failed logins, the system locks down temporarily, and 10 failed logins results in the system locking 
down completely. The only way to access the system is to connect the device to iTunes where the device has 
already been synced to that installation of iTunes. You’ll need to restore the device through iTunes using the 
latest backup, which you learned how to do in the chapter, “Supporting Mobile Operating Systems.”
	Restrict Android failed login attempts. For Android, five failed logins causes the system to temporarily 
lock down. To restore functionality, some Android devices offer the option to sign in with the 
device owner’s Google account credentials. For other devices, you can use Android Device Manager  
(google.com/android/devicemanager) to access a locked system, such as when the password has 
been ­forgotten.
	Multifactor authentication. Smart phones themselves can be used to authenticate to services and networks 
(for example, email, cloud services, corporate network accounts, VPNs, or even Facebook), as one of the 
two or more authentication techniques required for multifactor authentication. For example, you might 
first enter a password on a computer as the first authentication and then a code is sent as a text message 
to your smart phone and you must then enter the code in the computer as the second authentication. 
In another example, you enter a code in a computer that is at a certain location and the system you’re 
signing in to checks the GPS location of your smart phone to make sure it is near the computer. In 
addition, authenticator apps, such as Google Authenticator for Android or iOS, Microsoft Authenticator 
for Windows Phone, or an independent competitor like Authy, can be installed on your smart phone 
and configured to provide multifactor authentication support for a huge variety of account types.
Notes In some states, you cannot legally be forced to give your phone’s password to investigators. But you are 
required to give your fingerprint.
Caution
If you have Erase Data turned on, be sure to keep backups of your data and other content. A small child 
can pick up your smart phone and with a little finger tapping accidentally erase all your data.

Security Strategies
Software Security
In addition to controlling access to a device, you can use software to secure the data. Most of 
the methods discussed here require the user understand the importance of the security measure 
and how to use it:
	OS updates and patches. Android automatically pushes updates to many of its devices, but iOS devices 
and other mobile devices require manual updates. You learned how to update mobile device operating 
systems in the chapter, “Supporting Mobile Operating Systems.”
	Antivirus/anti-malware. Because Apple closely protects iOS and iOS apps, it’s unlikely an Apple device 
will need anti-malware software unless the device has been jailbroken. The Android OS and apps are 
not so closely guarded because apps can be downloaded from sources other than Google Play.  Before 
installing an Android anti-malware app, be sure to read reviews about it. Most of the major anti-malware 
software companies provide Android anti-malware apps.
	Trusted sources. iOS devices are limited to installing apps only from Apple’s App Store. Android and 
Windows devices can download and install apps from other sources, only some of which are trustworthy. 
Trusted sources generally include well-known app stores, such as Amazon Appstore for Android 
(amazon.com) or Slide ME (slideme.org). Look for lots of reviewer feedback as one measure of safety. 
Other trusted sources might include your bank’s website, your employer, or your school, although often 
these apps are posted in Google Play (play.google.com) as well.
	 Android allows you to limit app sources to only the Google Play Store, which can help reduce the threat 
of untrusted sources for apps. In the Settings app, tap Security and make sure that Unknown sources is 
unchecked, as shown in Figure 18-21a. If you do decide to use third-party app sources, be sure you already 
have a good anti-malware program and a firewall running on your device.

	Firewalls. As with Windows computers, a firewall on a mobile device helps control what connections can 
be made by which programs or services. When you install an app, you’re required to agree to the permis-
sions it requests in order to get the app. A firewall gives you more control over what network access an 
app can have. For example, a firewall can prevent the Facebook app from sending SMS messages. 
Facebook’s app might legitimately use SMS for two-factor authentication, but a firewall lets you decide if 
you’re comfortable with the app having that level of access in exchange for being able to use that feature. 
Most firewall apps for mobile devices use VPN technology to mimic a VPN connection, which forces all 
network communication to be routed through that connection so the app can emulate firewall-type pro-
tection on the device. Figure 18-21b shows an example of one firewall app on an Android smart phone.
	Android locator application and remote wipe. You can use Android Device Manager (ADM at  
google.com/android/devicemanager) to locate your phone on a map, force it to ring at its highest 
volume, change the device password, or remotely erase all data from the device to protect your privacy, 
which is called a remote wipe. All of these features are built in to Android and are available if location 
access services are turned on. Third-party locator applications are also available in the Play Store.
	
	 To turn on location access services on an Android smart phone, do the following:
1.	On the home screen, tap the Apps Launcher. Find and tap Google Settings. Note that this is not the 
same thing as the Settings app. The Google Settings app opens, as shown in Figure 18-22a.

2.	Scroll down and tap Security. On the Security screen, under Android Device Manager, make sure 
Remotely locate this device and Allow remote lock and erase sliders are turned on, as shown in

	iOS locator application and remote wipe. Similar to Android Device Manager, iCloud offers the ability to 
locate a lost iOS device if the feature is already enabled on the device. On an iPad or iPhone, turn on Find 
My iPhone or Find My iPad in the Settings app. How to do that is covered in the chapter, “Supporting

Mobile Operating Systems.” Besides using a browser on a computer to find your device, you can also 
download the free app, Find My iPhone or Find My iPad, to another Apple device and use it to locate your 
lost device. If you have given up on finding your device, you can use iCloud to perform a remote wipe.
Practice Locating Your iOS or Android Device
Whether you have an Android device or an iOS device, knowing how to locate it when it gets lost or 
stolen or how to perform a remote wipe can be crucial skills in an emergency. Do the following to find 
out how these tasks work:
1.	 If you have an iOS device, go to iCloud.com/#find. If you have an Android device, go to google.com/
android/devicemanager.
2.	 Sign in, and make sure the correct device is selected. Was the website able to locate your device? If not, check 
your device settings and make any adjustments necessary until the website successfully locates the device.
3.	 Explore the site to see how to make the device ring, how to lock the device by changing the passcode, and 
how to erase the device. What are the names of the three buttons that perform these tasks?
One potential snag in finding or remotely wiping your device would be relying on passwords stored in your device to 
access your Google or iCloud account. Be sure to store your sign-in information for these accounts in password vault 
software or memorize the information.

Mobile Security in Corporate Environments
Corporations and schools might provide corporate-owned devices, which are secured and 
managed by corporate policies and procedures, or the organization might have BYOD (Bring 
Your Own Device) policies and procedures. With BYOD, an employee or student is allowed 
to connect his own device to the corporate network. For security purposes, an organization 
configures a person’s device before allowing it to connect to the network in a process called on-boarding. 
The reverse process is call off-boarding. Here are important facts about both procedures:
	On-boarding might include installing an app on a device, which is required in order to access network 
resources such as email or file servers. Other on-boarding practices and apps might include apps that 
prevent the device from being jailbroken or rooted, anti-malware, encryption, PIN and password 
enforcement apps, and apps that control what other apps can be installed.
	On-boarding might install a remote backup application, which remotely backs up the device’s data to 
a company file server. For example, Canopy Remote Backup by Atos (canopy-cloud.com) provides 
cloud-based backups for laptops, tablets, and smart phones.
	Off-boarding might include the ability to perform a remote wipe on a device that is lost or stolen or 
when an employee is abruptly dismissed. The process might even include the ability to completely 
disable the device and make it unusable for any network access at all.
	Two examples of software that support on-boarding and off-boarding, including remote locks and 
wipes, are Microsoft Exchange Server and Google Apps Mobile Management software.
Regardless of who owns a device, any device allowed to connect to a secured corporate network must 
meet certain security configuration requirements, including encryption, firewalls, anti-malware measures, 
or use of VPN connections. These profile security requirements must be clearly outlined, and users must be 
educated on how to ensure their devices continue to meet the baseline requirements.

data before you toss out a storage device, and educate users to not unintentionally compromise 
the security measures you’ve put in place.

Authenticate Users for Large Networks
Normally, Windows authenticates a user with a Windows password. However, the best 
authentication happens when a user (1) knows something (such as a Windows password) and 
(2) possesses something, which is called a security token (such as a smart card or a fingerprint 
scan). In this part of the chapter, you learn about smart cards and biometric data used with 
multifactor authentication. One warning to keep in mind is a smart card or biometric data should be used 
in addition to, and not as a replacement for, a Windows password.
Security Tokens and Smart Cards
A security token provides an additional method of authentication in multifactor authentication scenarios 
or can serve as a replacement for a password. The most popular type of token used to authenticate a user 
is a smart card, which is typically a business-card sized card with embedded circuitry and contact points, 
although smart card technology can also be integrated into other security token form factors. (You also 
need to know that some people don’t consider a card to be a smart card unless it has an embedded 
microprocessor.)
The information on the smart card can be typed on a sign-in window by a user, read by a smart card 
reader (when the device is inserted into the reader), or transmitted wirelessly. See Figure 18-23. At the same 
time, some smart cards can receive information from the reader to confirm that the reader is authentic. This 
is called mutual authentication, which occurs any time authentication goes in both directions at the same 
time as both entities confirm the identity of the other.

Security Strategies
Here are some variations of security tokens:
	Key fob. A key fob is a security token that fits conveniently on a keychain, such as the one shown in 
Figure 18-24. The number on the key fob changes every 60 seconds. When a user signs in to the network, 
she must enter the number on the key fob, which is synchronized with the network authentication service. 
Entering the number proves that the user has the key fob in hand. Because the device doesn’t actually 
make physical contact with the system, it is called a contactless token or disconnected token.
Figure 18-23  Smart card is read by a smart card reader

Notes A common use 
of mutual authentication is 
sending a confirmation code by 
text to your smart phone using 
a phone number the server 
already has on file, which gives 
you reassurance that the server 
you’re authenticating to is who 
it says it is.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 
220-902 exam expects you to 
know about biometric data, 
badges, smart cards, tokens, 
key fobs, and RFID badges 
used to authenticate to a 
computer system or network.

	Wireless token. Another type of contactless token uses wireless technology to transmit information kept by 
the token to the computer system. A Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) token transmits authentication 
to the system when the token gets in range of a query device. For example, an RFID badge worn by an 
employee can allow the employee entrance into a locked area of a building.

	Memory stripe card. An example of a contact token is an employee ID badge or other smart card with a 
magnetic stripe that can be read by a smart card reader (see Figure 18-25a). Because these cards don’t 
contain a microchip, they are sometimes called memory cards. Some keyboards have an embedded smart 
card reader, and Figure 18-25b shows a reader that connects to a computer via a USB port. Used in this 
way, a memory stripe card is part of the authentication process into a network. The magnetic stripe can 
contain information about the user to indicate her rights on the system. The major disadvantage of this 
type of smart card is that each computer used for authentication must have one of these smart card 
reader machines installed. Also, in the industry, because a card with a magnetic stripe does not contain a 
microchip, some in the industry don’t consider it to fit into the category of a smart card, but rather 
simply call it a magnetic stripe card.

network, and (b) a USB reader for a magnetic stripe card

	Cell phone with token. An app installed on 
a cell phone can hold the user’s token, 
which includes a digital signature or digital 
certificate. A digital certificate is assigned by 
a Certification Authority (CA) (for example, 
VeriSign—www.verisign.com) and is used to 
prove you are who you say you are. The 
authentication can be sent to the network 
via a USB connection, text message, phone 
call, or Bluetooth connection. This method 
is sometimes used when an employee 
authenticates to a VPN connection to 
the corporate network.
Biometric Data
As part of the authentication process, some 
systems use biometric data to validate the person’s 
physical body, which, in effect, becomes the token. 
Figure 18-26 shows a biometric input device, a 
fingerprint scanner. Many mobile devices, such as 
iPads and some laptops, have fingerprint scanners 
built in. Other forms of biometric data include 
retinal scans (scans parts of the eye), handprints, 
face recognition, and voice recognition.

Physical Security Methods and Devices
Physically protecting a computer’s resources is often seen by security experts as more important 
than digital security. Here are some best practices for physical security:
A+  
220-902 
2.4, 3.2, 
3.6
	If the data is really private, keep it behind a locked door or under lock and key. You can 
use all kinds of security methods to encrypt, password protect, and hide data, but if it really 
is that important, one obvious thing you can do is to keep the computer behind a locked door. You can 
also store the data on a removable storage device such as an external hard drive and, when you’re not 
using the data, put the drive in a fireproof safe. And, of course, keep two copies. Sounds simple, but it 
works. Don’t forget that printouts of sensitive documents should also be kept under lock and key as 
well as any passwords you might have written down.
	Lock down the computer case. Some computer cases allow you to add a lock so that you can physically 
prevent others from opening the case (see Figure 18-27a). Some motherboards have a UEFI/BIOS feature 
that alerts you when an intrusion has been detected.
Figure 18-27  To physically secure a computer, (a) use a computer case lock and key for a desktop to 
prevent intrusion, or (b) use a cable lock system for a laptop to prevent theft
(a)
(b)
	Use a lock and chain. You can also use a lock and chain to physically tie a computer to a desk or other 
permanent fixture so someone can’t walk away with it. Figure 18-27b shows a cable lock system for a 
laptop. Most laptops have a security slot on the case to connect the cable lock.
	Use privacy filters. To keep other people from viewing a monitor screen, you can install a privacy filter 
that fits over the screen to prevent it from being read from a wide angle.
	Install a theft-prevention plate. As an added precaution, physically mark a computer case or laptop so it 
can be identified if it is later stolen. You embed a theft-prevention plate into the case or engrave your ID 
information into it. The numbers or bar code identify you, the owner, and can also clearly establish 
to police that the laptop has been stolen. Two sources of theft-prevention plates and cable locks are 
Computer Security Products, Inc., (computersecurity.com) and Flexguard Security System (flexguard 
.com). To further help you identify stolen equipment, record serial numbers and model numbers in  
a safe place separate from the equipment.
	Use a mantrap and security guard. The ultimate in physical security is a mantrap, which consists of two 
doors on either end of a small entryway where the first door must close before the second door can 
open. A separate form of identification might be required for each door, such as a badge for the first 
door and a fingerprint scan for the second door. A security guard might also maintain an entry control 
roster, which is a list of people allowed into the restricted area and a log of any approved visitors.

on databases of known scams and spammers. Corporations might route incoming and outgoing email 
through a proxy server for filtering. Incoming email is inspected for scams or spam to protect against 
social engineering that might trick an employee into introducing malware into the corporate network.
	
	 Outgoing email from employees might be filtered for inappropriate content. This lawful interception 
is intended to verify that an employee is complying with privacy laws (for example, laws that apply to 
confidential medical records) and is not accidentally or intentionally leaking corporate data and secrets. 
Email filtering software used in this way is an example of data loss prevention (DLP) software, which 
helps protect against leaking corporate data.
	Trusted software sources. It’s important to download software only from trusted publishers and 
providers. Even software from a trusted publisher can be filled with destructive extras if the software 
is obtained from an untrusted provider. Be careful which sites you use for software downloads even 
when you know the software is trusted.
	Access control lists. An access control list (ACL) determines what user, device, or program has access to a 
particular resource, whether that’s a printer, folder, file, or other resource on a corporate network, server, 
or workstation. Corporate networks manage ACLs through Active Directory on a Windows domain, but a 
single workstation can also be protected with properly configured permissions. In the chapter, “Windows 
Resources on a Network,” you learned to assign NTFS permissions and share permissions to user 
accounts in order to secure a workstation on a peer-to-peer network.
Unified Threat Management (UTM) Appliance
In the chapter, “Connecting To and Setting Up a Network,” you learned that a router stands 
between the Internet and a private network to route traffic between the two networks and can 
also serve as a firewall to protect the network. A next-generation firewall (NGFW) combines 
firewall software with antivirus/anti-malware software. In addition, a NGFW device can offer 
comprehensive Unified Threat Management (UTM) services. A UTM appliance, also called a security 
appliance, network appliance, or Internet appliance, stands between the Internet and a private network, 
as does a router, and protects the network (see Figure 18-28).

Security Strategies
A UTM appliance might offer these types of protections and services:
	Firewall. The firewall software filters incoming and outgoing network traffic according to IP addresses, 
ports, the type of messages the traffic contains, and how the message was initiated.
	Antivirus and anti-malware software. This software is usually much more advanced than what might be 
installed on a server or workstation.
	Identity-based access control lists. These lists control access of users or user groups and can log and 
report activity of these users and groups to reveal misuse, data leaks, or unauthorized access to resources. 
The company can use this feature to satisfy legal auditing requirements to detect and control data leaks.
	Intrusion detection system. An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors all network traffic and creates 
alerts when suspicious activity happens. IDS software can run on a UTM appliance, router, server, or 
workstation.
	Intrusion prevention system. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) not only monitors and logs suspicious 
activity, but it can also prevent the threatening traffic from burrowing into the system.
	VPN. The appliance can provide a VPN to remote users of the network.

Data Destruction 
and Disposal
On the flip side of 
protecting valuable data 
is safely destroying data 
that is no longer needed. 
Don’t throw out a hard drive, CD, 
DVD, tape, or other media that 
might have personal or corporate 
data on it unless you know the data 
can’t be stolen off the device. Trying 
to wipe a drive clean by deleting 
files or even by using Windows to 
format the drive does not completely 
destroy the data. Here are some 
ways to destroy printed documents 
and sanitize storage devices:
A+  
220-902 
3.6
	Use a paper shredder. Use a paper shredder to destroy all documents that contain sensitive data.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know about data-destruction techniques, including a low-level 
format, drive wipe, shredder, degausser, incineration, and drill, which can do physical damage to a hard drive.
	Overwrite data on the drive. To wipe a drive clean so that you can use it again, you can perform a low-
level format of a drive, which overwrites the data with zeroes. (A low-level format is different from a 
standard Windows format. A device receives a low-level format at the factory, which writes sector markings 
on the drive.) You can also use a zero-fill utility that also overwrites all data on the drive with zeroes. You 
can download a low-level format utility or zero-fill utility from many hard drive manufacturers.
	
	 Either method works for most low-security situations, but professional thieves know how to break 
through this type of destruction. If you use one of these utilities, run it multiple times to write zeroes on 
top of zeroes. Data recovery has been known to reach 14 levels of overwrites because each bit is slightly 
offset from the one under it.

883
Additional Methods to Protect Resources
18
	Physically destroy the storage media. Use a drill to drill many holes through the drive housing all the 
way through to the other side of the housing. Break CDs and DVDs in half and do similar physical 
damage with a hammer to flash drives or tapes, even to the point of setting them on fire to incinerate 
them. Again, expert thieves can still recover some of the data.
	For magnetic devices, use a degausser. A degausser exposes a storage device to a strong electromagnetic 
field to completely erase the data on a magnetic hard drive or tape drive (see Figure 18-30). 
A degaussed drive can’t be reused, but for the best destruction, use the degausser and also physically 
destroy the drive. Degaussing does not erase data on a solid-state hard drive or other flash media 
because these devices don’t use a magnetic surface to hold data.
Figure 18-30  Use a degausser to sanitize a magnetic hard drive or tape
	For solid-state devices, use a Secure Erase utility. As required by government regulations for personal 
data privacy, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) developed the ATA Secure Erase 
standards to wipe clean a solid-state device such as a USB flash drive or SSD drive. You can download 
a Secure Erase utility from the manufacturer of the device and run it to securely erase all data on the 
device and then reuse the drive.
	Use a secure data-destruction service. For the very best data destruction, consider a secure data-
destruction service. To find a service, search the web for “secure data destruction.” However, don’t use a 
service unless you have thoroughly checked its references and guarantees of legal compliance that your 
organization is required to meet. The service should provide you with a digital certificate of destruction, 
which verifies that the data has been destroyed beyond recovery. Paper certificates can be forged, but 
digital certificates produced by the software performing the destruction will provide auditable results 
of the destruction process.
Educate Users
Generally speaking, the weakest link in setting up security in a computer environment is 
people. That’s because people can often be tricked into giving out private information. Even 
with all the news and hype about identity theft and criminal websites, it’s amazing how well 
these techniques still work. Many users naively download a funny screen saver, open an email 
attachment, or enter credit card information on a website without regard to security. In the computer 
arena, social engineering is the practice of tricking people into giving out private information or allowing 
unsafe programs into the network or computer.

Security Strategies
A good support technician is aware of the criminal practices used, and is able to teach users how 
to recognize and avoid this mischief. A document that can help educate users is an acceptable use 
policy (AUP), which explains what users can and cannot do on the corporate network or with company 
data, and the penalties for violations. The AUP might also describe how these measures help protect 
the network’s security. Here is a list of important security measures that users need to follow to protect 
passwords and the computer system:
	Never give out your passwords to anyone, not even a supervisor or tech support person who calls and 
asks for it.
	Don’t store your passwords on a computer unless you use company-approved password vault software 
(for example, KeePass). Some organizations even forbid employees from writing down their passwords.
	Don’t use the same password on more than one system (computer, network, application, or website).
	Be aware of shoulder surfing, when other people secretly peek at your monitor screen as you work. 
A privacy filter can help.
	Lock down your workstation each time you step away from your desk.
	Users need to be on the alert for tailgating, which is when someone who is unauthorized follows the 
employee through a secured entrance to a room or building. Another form of tailgating is when a user 
steps away from her computer and another person continues to use the Windows session when the 
system is not properly locked.
Beware of online social engineering techniques. For example, don’t be fooled by scam email or an email 
hoax such as the one shown in Figure 18-31. When the user who received this email scanned the attached 
file using antivirus software, the software reported the file contained malware.
Figure 18-31  This phishing technique using an email message with an attached file is an 
example of social engineering 
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to be aware of social engineering situations such as tailgating, 
phishing, and shoulder surfing that might compromise security.

Dealing with Malicious Software on Personal Computers
18
Don’t forward an email hoax. When you get a hoax, if you know the person who sent it to you, do us all 
a favor and send that person some of these links!
Here are some other types of online social engineering situations:
	Phishing (pronounced “fishing”) is a type of identity theft in which the sender of an email message 
scams you into responding with personal data about yourself. Even more plausible is spear phishing, 
where the email appears to come from companies you already do business with. The scam artist baits 
you by asking you to verify personal data on your bank account, ISP account, credit card account, or 
something of that nature. Often you are tricked into clicking a link in the email message, which takes 
you to an official-looking site complete with corporate or bank logos, where you are asked to enter 
your user ID and password to enter the site. This tactic is called spoofing, which means the scam artist 
makes both the email and website look like the real thing.
	An email message might contain a link that leads to a malicious script. If you think an email is legitimate, 
to be on the safe side, still don’t click the link. To keep a script from running, type the website’s home 
page into your browser address bar and navigate to the relevant page on the website.
A study by Dell showed that 65 percent of business travelers have not secured the corporate data on their 
hard drives, and 42 percent don’t back up that data. Here are some commonsense rules to help protect a 
laptop when traveling:
	When traveling, always know where your laptop is. If you’re standing at an airport counter, tuck your 
laptop case securely between your ankles. At security checkpoints, pay attention to your belongings; tell 
yourself to stay focused. When flying, never check your laptop as baggage, and don’t store it in airplane 
overhead bins; keep it at your feet.
	Never leave a laptop in an unlocked car. If you leave your laptop in a hotel room, use a laptop cable 
lock to secure it to a table.
	When at work, lock your laptop in a secure place or use a laptop cable lock to secure it to your desk.
An IT support technician will most certainly be called on to help a user rid a system of malware. Let’s 
turn our attention to how to deal with that problem.
Dealing with Malicious Software on Personal Computers
Malicious software, also called malware, or a computer infestation, is any unwanted program 
that means you harm and is transmitted to your computer without your knowledge. Grayware 
is any annoying and unwanted program that might or might not mean you harm, for example 
adware that produces all those unwanted pop-up ads. In this part of the chapter, you learn 
about the different types of malware and grayware, what to do to clean up an infected system, 
and how to protect a system from infection.

What Are We up Against?
You need to know your enemy! Different categories of malicious software and scamming 
techniques are listed next:
A+  
220-902 
3.1, 4.2
	Viruses. A virus is a program that replicates by attaching itself to other programs. The 
infected program must be executed for a virus to run. The program might be an application, 
a macro in a document, a Windows system file, or a boot loader program.
	Spyware. Spyware spies on you to collect personal information about you that it transmits over the 
Internet to web-hosting sites. An example of spyware is a keylogger that tracks all your keystrokes and

can be used to steal a person’s identity, credit card numbers, Social Security number, bank information, 
passwords, email addresses, and so forth.
	Worms. A worm is a program that copies itself throughout a network or the Internet without a host 
program. A worm creates problems by overloading the network as it replicates and can even hijack or 
install a server program such as a web server.
	Trojans. A Trojan does not need a host program to work; rather, it substitutes itself for a legitimate 
program. In most cases, a user launches it thinking she is launching a legitimate program. A Trojan is 
often embedded in the files of legitimate software that is downloaded from an untrustworthy website, 
or a user is tricked into opening an email attachment (refer back to Figure 18-31).
	Rootkits. A rootkit loads itself before the OS boot is complete. It can hide in boot managers, boot loader 
programs, or kernel mode device drivers. UEFI secure boot is especially designed to catch rootkits that 
launch during the boot. Because it is already loaded when most anti-malware software loads, it is 
sometimes overlooked by the software. A rootkit can hide folders that contain software it has installed, 
cause Task Manager to display a different name for its process, hide registry keys, and can operate in user 
mode or kernel mode. This last trick helps it remain undetected (see Figure 18-32).
Figure 18-32  A rootkit can run in user mode or kernel mode
User-mode process (Task Manager, Explorer)
Kernel-mode process
Files stored on hard drive
User-mode rootkit intercepts data here
Kernel-mode rootkit intercepts data here
Caution
If anti-malware software reports a rootkit is present, but cannot delete it, the best solution is to immediately 
disconnect the computer from the network (if you have not already done so), back up your important data, format your hard 
drive, and reinstall Windows.
	
A rootkit running in user mode intercepts the API calls between the time when the API retrieves the 
data and when it is displayed in a window. A rootkit running in kernel mode actually interferes with the 
Windows kernel and substitutes its own information in place of the raw data read by the Windows kernel. 
Because most anti-malware software to one degree or another relies on Windows tools and components to 
work, the rootkit is not detected or cannot be deleted if the Windows tools themselves are infected.
	Ransomware. Ransomware holds your computer system hostage until you pay money. For example, the 
CryptoLocker Trojan program that did damage in 2014 was embedded in email attachments and was 
known to work on Windows, Android, and even some iOS systems. When the user clicked the attachment, 
the program encrypted the computer’s personal files. If the user didn’t pay within a 24-hour period, all the 
files were lost. Many users who did not have backups of their data chose to pay the ransom.

	Zero-day attack. A zero-day attack can happen when a hacker discovers a security hole in software 
that is unknown to the developer of the software. The race is on for the vendor to provide a patch 
to the software before hackers have even one day to use the hole to infect systems and steal user data. 
Microsoft normally publishes security patches on the second and fourth Tuesday of each month 
(known as patch Tuesday), but sometimes releases patches off schedule so that hackers have zero 
days to attack customers.
	Man-in-the-middle attack. In a man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker intercepts communication between 
two parties and reads and/or alters the content of messages. The attacker can pretend to be a legitimate 
website, network, FTP site, or person in a chat session. For example, a user might connect to an “evil 
twin” Wi-Fi hotspot, thinking it’s a legitimate hotspot, and attempt to start a chat session with a business 
associate. The attacker pretends to be the business associate and continues the chat with the intention of 
obtaining private information. The best protection against man-in-the-middle attacks is to use digital 
certificates to identify a person or service before transmitting sensitive information.
	Zombies and botnets. A zombie is a computer that has been hacked, and the hacker is using the computer 
to run repetitive software in the background without the knowledge of its user. For example, the zombie 
might be email spamming or performing denial-of-service attacks (attacks from multiple computers that 
overwhelm a server with requests until new connections can no longer be accepted). A hacker might build 
an entire network of zombies, which is called a botnet (a network of robots). The CryptoLocker Trojan 
program was distributed by a botnet and ultimately isolated when the botnet was taken down.
	Dictionary attack. A dictionary attack can be used to crack a password by trying words in a dictionary. 
Password cracker software might combine a brute force attack with a dictionary attack to use smarter 
guessing to guess the password.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to be able to compare and contrast viruses, Trojans, worms, spyware, 
ransomware, and rootkits. You also need to know about zero-day attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, zombies, botnets, 
dictionary attacks, brute force attacks, and noncompliant systems.
	Non compliant systems and violations of security best practices. Administrators who remotely manage 
many servers or workstations on a large network might use configuration management software, such 
as Microsoft System Center, to remotely configure computers and monitor these configurations. Agents 
are installed on each computer to be monitored that routinely report the configuration back to the 
management software. The administrator routinely receives and reviews these reports, comparing the 
reported configurations with the established configuration baseline. For security purposes, she 
specifically looks for non compliant systems that violate security best practices, such as out-of-date  
anti-malware software or no anti-malware software installed.
Step-by-Step Attack Plan
This section is a step-by-step attack plan to clean up an infected system. We use anti-malware 
software, also called antivirus software, to remove all types of general malware, including viruses, 
spyware, worms, and rootkits. Then we’ll use some Windows tools to check out the system to 
make sure all remnants of malware have been removed and the system is in tip-top order.

Caution
If a system is highly infected and will later hold sensitive data, a fresh start might be in order. In fact, 
Microsoft recommends reinstalling Windows as the safest way to deal with highly infected systems.
For Windows 8, a refresh can be an excellent option if you have a custom refresh image and current backups of user 
data. For Windows 7, consider using a system image to reinstall Windows and then restore data from recent backups.

Security Strategies
Step 1: Identify Malware Symptoms
An IT support technician needs to know how to recognize that a system is infected with malware and how 
to clean an infected system. Here are some warnings that suggest malicious software is at work:
	Pop-up ads and browser redirection. Basically, a user is losing control of his system. For example, 
Figure 18-33 shows the desktop immediately after a user signed in. Pop-up ads are randomly appearing 
and the browser home page has changed. A browser might also have an uninvited toolbar.
Figure 18-33  A hijacked home page, security alerts, and pop-up ads indicate an infected system
Source:  Ruiware, LLC
	Rogue antivirus software. When the user above tried to run Windows Defender (anti-malware software 
embedded in Windows 8), it refused to run. She opened the Action Center to find that Defender had 
been disabled because other antivirus software she did not install was running. See Figure 18-34.

	 Windows allows only one anti-malware product to run at a time. You can use Task Manager to stop 
the rogue antivirus software and then start Windows Defender.
	Slow performance or lockups. Generally, the system works much slower than it used to. Programs take 
longer than normal to load. Strange or bizarre error messages appear. Programs that once worked now 
give errors. Task Manager shows unfamiliar processes running. The system might even lock up.
	Internet connectivity issues, application crashes, and OS updates fail. These types of problems seem to 
plague the system with no reasonable explanation that is specific to the network, application, or 
Windows update. Remember that Event Viewer can be used to view logs of system crashes, application 
crashes, and failed OS updates.
	Problems with files. File names now have weird characters or their file sizes seem excessively large. 
Executable files have changed size or file extensions change without reason. Files mysteriously disappear 
or appear. Windows system files are renamed. Files constantly become corrupted. Files you could once 
access now give access denied messages, and file permissions change.
	Email problems. You receive email messages telling you that you have sent someone spam or an infected 
message, or you receive automated replies indicating you sent email you didn’t know about. This type of 
attack indicates your email address or email client software on your computer has been hijacked.
	Problems updating your anti-malware software. Even though you can browse to other websites, you 
cannot access anti-malware software sites such as www.symantec.com or www.mcafee.com, and you 
cannot update your anti-malware software.
	Invalid digital certificates. An OS is responsible for validating certificates used to secure communication. 
For Windows, Microsoft maintains a database of trusted root certificates issued by Certification Authorities 
(CAs). (A root certificate is the original certificate issued by the CA.) When a Windows system opens a 
secure email or visits a secure website and encounters a new digital certificate, it requests the trusted root 
certificate from Microsoft, which is downloaded to the computer. The download happens seamlessly 
without the user’s knowledge unless there’s a problem. If Windows cannot obtain the root certificate to 
validate the email or website, it displays an error (see Figure 18-35). Don’t trust websites or email whose 
certificates have expired or been revoked.
Figure 18-35  Windows reports a problem with a digital certificate
Notes If a computer gives invalid certificate errors, check that the Windows date is correct. A wrong Windows date 
before the certificate was issued can cause the problem.
You can use the Certificate Manager (certmgr.msc) to view and delete root certificates (see Figure 18-36). 
For example, the Superfish virus injects a rogue root certificate into the Microsoft store of trusted certificates

Security Strategies
Step 2: Quarantine an Infected System
If an infected computer is connected to a network (wired or wireless), immediately disconnect the network 
cable or turn off the wireless adapter. You don’t want to spread a virus or worm to other computers on your 
network. A quarantined computer is not allowed to use the regular network that other computers use. If 
you need to use the Internet to download anti-malware software or its updates, take some precautions first. 
Consider your options. Can you disconnect other computers from the network while this one computer 
is connected? Can you isolate the computer from your local network, connecting it directly to the ISP or 
a special quarantined network? If neither option is possible, try downloading the anti-malware software 
updates while the computer is booted into Safe Mode with Networking or after a clean boot. (Safe Mode 
doesn’t always allow downloads.) Malware might still be running in Safe Mode or after a clean boot, but 
is less likely to do so than when the system is started normally.
Always keep in mind that data might be on the hard drive that is not backed up. Before you begin cleaning 
up the system, back up data to another media.
Step 3: Disable System Restore
In Windows, some malware hides its program files in restore points stored in the System Volume Information 
folder maintained by System Protection. If System Protection is on, anti-malware software can’t clean this 
protected folder. To get rid of that malware, turn off System Protection so that anti-malware can clean the 
System Volume Information folder (see Figure 18-37). Realize that when you turn off System Protection, 
all your restore points are lost. To turn off System Protection, open the System window and click System 
protection. Later, when you are sure the system is clean, turn System Protection back on and create a new 
restore point that you can use in the future if problems arise.
on the local computer so that it can perform a man-in-the-middle attack to display adware on secure websites 
a user visits. If you see a Superfish certificate listed among trusted root certificates, be sure to delete it.
Figure 18-36  Windows Certificate Manager can be used to view and delete root certificates kept in the 
store of trusted certificates
A+ Exam Tip

and how to quarantine and remediate an infected system.
Notes Malicious software is designed to do varying degrees of damage to data and software, although it does not 
damage computer hardware. However, when partition table information is destroyed on a hard drive, the hard drive can 
appear to be physically damaged.

information about malware. Before selecting a product, be sure to read some reviews about it and check 
out some reliable websites that rate anti-malware software.

Caution
Some highly infected systems will not allow 
anti-malware software to run. In this situation, you can boot 
the computer into Safe Mode and use System Restore to apply 
a restore point that was taken before the infection. Applying 
a restore point cannot be counted on to completely remove 
an infection, but it might remove startup entries the malware 
is using, making it possible to run the anti-malware software 
from the normal Windows desktop or run the software in Safe 
Mode. Consider that you might need to apply a restore point 
before you disable System Protection, which deletes all your 
restore points.

Table 18-1  Anti-malware software and websites
OS Differences Windows Defender anti-malware software is embedded in Windows 8 and can be accessed through 
Control Panel. Windows 7 includes Windows Defender, but the Windows 7 version finds only spyware, not viruses and other 
malware. For Windows 7, you can download and install Microsoft Security Essentials, which is free anti-malware software.
Caution
Beware of websites that appear as sponsored links at the top of search results for anti-malware software. 
These sites might make you think they are the home site for the software, but are really trying to lure you into 
downloading adware or spyware.

Security Strategies
Now let’s look at different situations you might encounter when attempting to run anti-malware software.
When an Infected Computer Will Not Boot
If an infected computer will not boot, it might be that the boot manager, boot loaders, or kernel mode drivers 
launched at startup are infected or damaged. Launch the computer into Windows Recovery Environment 
(Windows RE) and use the Startup Repair process to repair the system. The chapter, “Troubleshooting 
Windows Startup,” gives more information about solving boot problems. You can also install the hard drive 
as a second drive in another system and use that system to scan the drive for malware.
Update and Run Anti-Malware Software Already Installed
If anti-malware software is already installed and you suspect an infection, update the software and perform 
a full scan on the system. Do the following:
1. Make sure the anti-malware software is up to date. These updates download the latest malware definitions, 
also called malware signatures, which the software uses to define or detect new malware as it gets into 
the wild.
2. Use the anti-malware software to perform a full scan of the system. As it scans, the software might ask you 
what to do with an infected program or it might log this event in an event viewer or history log it keeps. 
For example, Windows Defender reports a threat, as shown in Figure 18-38. When you click Clean PC, 
you can decide what to do with the threat. In most situations, select Remove to delete the program.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know about Windows Defender in Windows 8 and Windows 7.
Figure 18-38  Decide what to do with a program that Windows Defender has identified 
as a severe threat to the system
3. After the scan is complete and you have decided what to do with each suspicious file, reboot the system and 
allow the software to update itself again and then scan the system again. Most likely, some new malware 
will be discovered. Keep rebooting and rescanning until a scan comes up clean.

Run Anti-Malware Software from a Networked Computer
If anti-malware software is not already installed, the most effective way to clean the computer is to run the 
software from another computer. Follow these steps:
1. Make sure the remote computer has its software firewall set for maximum protection and its installed 
anti-malware software is up to date and running.
2. Network the two computers and share drive C: on the infected computer. (Don’t connect the infected 
computer to the entire network. If necessary, you can connect the two computers using a crossover cable 
or using a small switch and network cables.)
3. To make your work easier, you can map a network drive from the remote computer to drive C: on the 
infected computer.
4. Perform an anti-malware scan on the remote computer, pointing the scan to drive C: on the infected computer.
Install and Run Anti-Malware Software on the Infected Computer
If you don’t have another computer available on the network to scan the infected computer, you can use 
another computer to purchase and download the anti-malware software and copy the downloaded files 
to a CD or flash drive that you can insert in the infected computer. Don’t make the mistake of using the 
infected computer to purchase and download anti-malware software because keyloggers might be spying 
and collecting credit card information. During the installation process, the anti-malware software updates 
itself and performs a scan. You can also run free online anti-malware software without downloading and 
installing it, but be careful to use only reputable websites.
Install and Run Anti-Malware Software in Safe Mode
Some malware prevents anti-malware software from installing or running. In this situation, try booting 
the system in Safe Mode or performing a clean boot and installing the anti-malware software. Some viruses 
still load in Safe Mode or after a clean boot, and some anti-malware programs will not install in Safe Mode. 
Recall that to launch Windows 
in Safe Mode, enter the msconfig 
command in the Windows 8 Run 
box or Windows 7 Search box. In 
the System Configuration box, on 
the Boot tab, check Safe boot (see 
Figure 18-39). To launch Safe Mode 
with Networking so that you can 
update your anti-malware software, 
select Network in the list of options. 
Then restart the system.
Notes If you ever encounter a virus that your updated anti-malware software did not find, be sure to let the 
manufacturer of the software know so they can research the problem.

Security Strategies
Run the Anti-Malware Software from a Bootable  
Rescue CD or Flash Drive
Some anti-malware products, such as the AVG Rescue CD software, offer the option to create a bootable 
USB flash drive or CD. You can then use this device to boot the system and run the anti-malware software 
from the device in this preinstallation environment. Most of the products listed earlier in Table 18-1 offer 
the option on their website to download software to create a bootable CD or flash drive. Be sure to use 
a healthy computer to create the rescue CD or flash drive. In addition, you might need to create a 32-bit 
version to scan a 32-bit Windows system or a 64-bit version to scan a 64-bit system. When selecting a 
product to create a bootable device, find one that can store the latest updates on the CD or flash drive 
so you don’t need Internet access when you scan the infected system.
Run More than One Scan of Anti-Malware
After you’ve scanned the system using one of the methods just discussed, reboot and install anti-malware 
software on the hard drive. Update the software, and then keep scanning and rebooting until the scan 
report is clean.
If a second or third scan doesn’t remove all symptoms of malware, consider installing and running a 
second anti-malware program. What one anti-malware program cannot detect or remove, another one 
might. For example, Windows Defender on one system removed malware it detected, but did not detect 
or remove the downloader dnsatlantic.exe, which hijacks a browser and is still running in the background 
(see Figure 18-40).
Notes If viruses are launched even after you boot in Safe Mode and you cannot get the anti-malware software to 
work, try searching for suspicious entries in the Windows registry subkeys under HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\
SafeBoot. Subkeys under this key control what is launched when you boot into Safe Mode. How to edit the registry is 
covered in the chapter, “Optimizing Windows.”
Figure 18-40  The malware downloader dnsatlantic.exe is still running after multiple scans of anti-malware 
software
In this situation, try another anti-malware program. For example, Microsoft Safety Scanner  
(microsoft.com/security/scanner) is not designed for on going malware prevention but can sometimes 
remove malware that Windows Defender did not find.

Clean up What’s Left Over
Next, you’ll need to clean up anything the anti-malware software left behind. Sometimes anti-malware 
software tells you it is not able to delete a file, or it deletes an infected file but leaves behind an orphaned 
entry in the registry or startup folders. If the anti-malware software tells you it was not able to delete or 
clean a file, first check the anti-malware software website for any instructions you might find to manually 
clean things up. Here are some general actions you can take to clean up what the software left behind:
1. Respond to any startup errors. On the first boot after anti-malware software has declared a system 
clean, you might still find some startup errors caused by incomplete removal of the malware. Use System 
Configuration and/or Task Manager to find out how a startup program is launched. If the program 
is launched from the registry, you can back up and delete the registry key. If the program is launched 
from a startup folder, you can move or delete the shortcut or program in the folder. See the chapter, 
“Optimizing Windows,” for the details of how to remove unwanted startup programs.
2. Research malware types and program files. Your anti-malware software might alert you to a suspicious 
program file that it quarantines, and then ask you to decide if you want to delete it. Also, Task Manager 
and other tools might find processes you suspect are malware. The web is your best tool to use when 
making your decision about a program. Here are some websites that offer malware encyclopedias that 
are reliable and give you symptoms and solutions for malware:
	Process Library by Uniblue Systems Limited at www.processlibrary.com
	DLL Library by Uniblue Systems Limited at www.liutilities.com
	All the anti-malware software sites listed earlier in the chapter in Table 18-1
 
Beware of using other sites! Much information on the web is written by people who are just guessing, 
and some of the information is put there to purposefully deceive. Check things out carefully, and learn 
which sites you can rely on.
3. Delete files. For each program file the anti-malware software told you it could not delete, delete the 
program file yourself following these steps:
a.	First try File Explorer or Windows Explorer to locate a file and delete it. For peace of mind, don’t 
forget to empty the Recycle Bin when you’re done.
b.	If the file is hidden or access is denied, open an elevated command prompt window and use the commands 
listed in Table 18-2 to take control of a file so you can delete it. If the commands don’t work using an 
elevated command prompt window, use the commands in a command prompt window in Windows RE.
c.	 To get rid of other malware files, delete all Internet Explorer temporary Internet files. To do so, use the 
Disk Cleanup process in the Drive C: properties box, or delete the browsing history using the Internet 
Options box.
d.	Delete all subfolders and files in the C:\Windows\Temp folder. Figure 18-41 shows where Windows 
Defender lists potentially unwanted programs (PuPs) that a Trojan downloader put in this folder.

4. Clean the registry. The 
appendix, “Entry Points for 
Windows Startup Processes,” 
lists registry keys that can 
affect startup. You can search 
these keys and delete entries 
you don’t want. After you have 
finished cleaning the registry, 
don’t forget to restart the 
system to make sure all is well 
before you move on.
5. Clean up Internet Explorer and 
uninstall unwanted programs. 
Adware and spyware might 
install add-ons to Internet 
Explorer (including toolbars 
you didn’t ask for), install 
cookie trackers, and change 
your Internet Explorer security 
settings. Anti-malware software 
might have found all these items, 
but as a good defense, take 
a few minutes to find out for 
yourself. The chapter, “Windows 
Resources on a Network,” 
covers how to use the Internet

Step 5: Protect the System with Scheduled Scans and Updates
Once your system is clean, you’ll certainly want to keep it that way. The three best practices you need to 
follow to protect a system against malware are:
	Use anti-malware software. Install and run anti-malware software and keep it current. Configure the 
software so that it (1) runs in the background in real time to alert users of malware that attempts to run 
or install, (2) automatically scans incoming email attachments, and (3) performs scheduled scans of the 
system and automatically downloads updates to the software. To find out what anti-malware software 
is installed and turned on, open the Action Center.
	Always use a software firewall. Never, ever connect your computer to an unprotected network without 
using a firewall. Windows Firewall is turned on by default. Recall that you can configure Windows 
Firewall to allow no uninvited communication in or to allow in the exceptions that you specify.
	Keep Windows updates current. Windows updates are continually being released to plug up vulnerable 
entrances in Windows where malware might attack and to update Windows Defender and Microsoft 
Security Essentials. Recall you can verify Windows Update settings by clicking Windows Update in 
the System window.
Step 6: Enable System Protection and Create a Restore Point
Now that the system is clean, if System Protection is still turned off, turn it back on and create a 
restore point.
Step 7: Educate the End User
Now would be a good time to go over with the user some tips presented earlier in the chapter to keep 
the system free from malware. Sometimes the most overlooked step in preventing malware infections is 
to educate the user. Even with all your security measures in place, a user can still download and execute 
a Trojan, which can install more malware in the system.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know about the seven steps to remove malware. Memorize 
these seven steps and know how to use them.
Create and Use an Anti-Malware Software  
Rescue Disc
When an infected computer does not have anti-malware software installed, one method to clean the 
infection is to create and use an anti-malware rescue disc. Select anti-malware software that offers 
a free download to create a bootable USB flash drive or CD. For example, Windows Defender Offline 
or F-Secure Rescue CD can be used. Create a bootable USB flash drive or CD and use it to scan a 
computer. Answer the following questions:
1.	 What is the URL where you found the download to create a rescue disc or drive?
2.	 List the files in the root directory of the USB flash drive or CD that the software created.
3.	 Describe the menu or screen that appears when you booted from the rescue media.

We begin with how to recognize a device might be infected.

Common Mobile Device Malware Symptoms
Android and Windows Phone devices are more susceptible to malware than iOS devices 
because apps can be downloaded from other sites than Google or Microsoft. With iOS devices, 
apps can be obtained only from the Apple App Store and, therefore, are more strictly vetted. 
However, for any mobile device, malware can be introduced by a Trojan that a user accepts as 
an email attachment or by some other means or by macros embedded in shared documents.
Here are some symptoms that malware might be at work on an Android, iOS, or Windows Phone device:
	Battery drain, slow speeds, leaked data, strange text messages, and data transmission over limits. 
Battery power draining faster than normal or slow data upload or download speeds can indicate that 
apps are running in the background. For example, when the XAgent malware app installs on an Apple 
device with iOS version 7 or below, the app icon is hidden, and the app runs in the background. When 
you close the app, it restarts. The malware not only uses resources, it steals personal data and makes 
screen shots and sends them to a remote command-and-control (C&C) server.  A C&C server might

send coded text messages to your phone. If you receive strange text messages, suspect malware. Another 
indication of malware at work is a spike in your data usage charges on your phone bill.
	Dropped phone calls or weak signal. Dropped phone calls can happen when malware is interfering 
and trying to eavesdrop on your conversations or is performing other background activities.
	Unintended Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections. Malicious Wi-Fi hotspots and Bluetooth devices can 
hijack a device or inject it with malware. When your mobile device connects to a malicious Wi-Fi 
hotspot, the device can receive a malicious script that repeatedly reboots your device, which prevents 
you from using the device. To prevent this type of attack, avoid the free Wi-Fi hotspots. To prevent your 
device from pairing with a malicious Bluetooth device, turn off Bluetooth when you’re not using it.
	Unauthorized account access. A malicious app can steal passwords and data from other apps and can 
pretend to be a different app to get access to online accounts. If you suspect an online account has been 
hacked, consider malware might be on your mobile device that uses this account.
	Unauthorized location tracking. Spyware apps installed on a mobile device can report its location to a 
C&C server.
	Unauthorized use of camera or microphone. Unauthorized surveillance is a sure sign of malware. Stalker 
spyware apps have been known to take photos and send them to a C&C server; send a text alert to a 
hacker and then add the hacker to a live call; use the microphone to record live conversations and then 
send the recording to a C&C server; report Facebook, Skype, Viber, and iMessage activity, including 
passwords and location data; and upload all photos, videos, and text messages to a C&C server.
	Unauthorized root access. Malware is more likely to install on a jailbroken iOS device or rooted 
Android or Windows Phone device. Here’s what you need to know:
	Jailbroken iOS device. To find out if an iOS device has been jailbroken, look for an unusual app 
icon on the home screen, for example, the Installer app, Cydia app, or Icy app. If any of these apps 
is present, the device has been jailbroken. If you have any app icon on your home screen that is not 
available in the App Store, the app is most likely a jailbreak app or other malware. A jailbroken

device can download apps from sources other than the Apple 
App Store. When you update iOS using iTunes, the jailbreak 
will be removed.
	Rooted Android device. One way to find out if an Android 
device has been rooted is to download and run the Root 
Checker Basic free app. Figure 18-43 shows the report you 
get when Root Checker Basic reports a device is not rooted.
	
Another way to tell if a device is rooted is to download a 
terminal window app. (A terminal window in Linux is similar 
to a command prompt window in Windows.) When you open 
the app, look at the command prompt. If the prompt is a #, 
the device is rooted. If the prompt is a $, the device is likely 
not rooted. With the $ prompt showing, try the sudo su root 
command, which in Linux allows you root access. If the 
prompt changes to #, the device is rooted.
Notes In Linux, the # command prompt displays when a user has 
root access and the $ command prompt displays when a user does not 
have root access.
	Rooted Windows Phone. Although it was possible to root 
Windows Phone 7, as of this writing, there is currently no 
way to root Windows Phone 8.1.

Mobile Device Tools and Malware Removal
Here are general steps for removing malware from a mobile device, listed from least to most 
invasive:
A+  
220-902 
4.4
	Uninstall the offending app. If you can identify the malware app, uninstall it. If the app 
won’t uninstall, force stop it and try to uninstall again. Recall you can force stop Android apps using 
the Settings app. Tap Apps, swipe to the left to see running apps, and tap a running app to force stop it.
	Update the OS. For an iOS device, use iTunes on your computer to perform the update rather than 
updating the iOS directly from the device. For other devices, use the methods you learned about in the 
chapter, “Supporting Mobile Operating Systems.”
	Remove root access to the device. An Android device that has been rooted cannot receive an Android 
OS update. To unroot the device so you can update it, use one of these methods:
	Unroot with the app that was used to root the device. For example, if you find the SuperSU app 
installed on the device, most likely it was used to root the device. Open the app and tap Full unroot 
to unroot the device.
	Download a root removal app. Search online for reviews about root removal apps before you select one. 
One example is the Universal Unroot app–download and install it to remove root access from the device.
	Perform a factory reset. The most sure fire way to remove malware is to back up your data and other 
content, reset your device to its factory default state, which is also called a clean install, and then restore 
your content from backup. Here are the steps for an iPhone:
1.	Using iTunes on your computer, make sure iTunes is using the latest updates. Then connect your 
iPhone to your computer.
2.	Use iTunes to back up your iPhone to the computer. In the Backups group, select This computer and 
click Back Up Now (see Figure 18-44). To verify the backup is made, click Edit, Preferences, Device 
and look for the backup listed.
Figure 18-44  Use the Backups section in the iTunes window to manage backups to this computer
Source: Apple iOS
3.	If you have made purchases on the iPhone that have not yet been backed up to the computer, you can 
click File, Devices, and Transfer Purchased from “iPhone”.
4.	Click Restore iPhone to restore the device, which deletes all data and content and restores the device 
firmware to factory settings. After the restore, the device restarts and you are given the opportunity 
to select a previous backup to restore data and content. Select the backup you just made.

Dealing with Malicious Software on Mobile Devices

After you have removed malware on a mobile device, you will want to keep it clean. Here are a 
few tips:
	 Don’t jailbreak or root a device and keep OS updates current.
	Educate users about the importance of privacy settings (for example, disable cookies and turn off 
Bluetooth when it’s not in use) and of not opening email attachments or downloading shared files from 
untrusted sources.
	Consider installing an anti-malware app. Apple claims that an iOS device cannot be infected with malware 
and does not make anti-malware apps available in the App Store. However, you can get an app from the 
App Store that monitors your device and scans for malware that might be in stored files, but not installed. 
For Android and Windows Phone devices, search online reviews and consider the features offered before 
deciding on an anti-malware app. An anti-malware app can scan apps and files for malware, scan for 
unauthorized surveillance, monitor security and privacy settings, find the device when it’s lost and lock 
and remote wipe it, and maintain automatic updates.
In an enterprise environment, Wi-Fi analyzers and cellular network analyzers might be used to protect 
the network against intrusion. Next is a brief introduction to these tools.
Wi-Fi Analyzers
When you’re responsible for a Wi-Fi network, you might want to consider monitoring it for rogue 
devices that could be attempting to hack transmissions. Wi-Fi analyzer software and hardware can 
be used to detect devices not authorized to use the network, identify attempts made by connected 
devices to hack transmissions, and even identify their physical location. Wi-Fi analyzers can also detect 
performance vulnerabilities and identify bottlenecks. They can detect security vulnerabilities, which 
allow a device to connect to the wireless network using a configuration the network is not set up to use 
(for example, an authorized channel or nonencrypted transmissions). An example of a Wi-Fi analyzer 
device is the OptiView tablet by Fluke Networks (flukenetworks.com), shown in Figure 18-45. This 
tablet computer comes preinstalled with AirMagnet WiFi Analyzer software, also by Fluke Networks. 
Figure 18-46 shows a demo window of the software.

Cellular Network Analyzers
Large organizations that require cellular and Wi-Fi coverage over a large area (for example, a shopping 
mall or large hospital) might implement a distributed antenna system (DAS). Small antennas are installed 
over the facility to act as repeaters for cell tower and Wi-Fi access point (AP) coverage. In addition, 
with the trend toward BYOD (bring your own device), some organizations have found it necessary 
to closely monitor cellular connections to private networks to identify hackers performing tasks that 
appear malicious.
Cellular network analyzer software and hardware 
can be used to monitor cellular networks for signal 
strength of cell towers, WAPs, and repeaters, which 
can help technicians better position antennas in a 
DAS. The software can also monitor for interference, 
performance, and voice and data transmissions. 
Voice and data transmissions can be analyzed for how 
the network is used, with the intent of identifying 
malicious activity. An example of cellular network 
analyzer hardware is the RF spectrum analyzer shown 
in Figure 18-47. Data from the spectrum analyzer 
is input to the AirMagnet Spectrum ES software for 
analysis. A demo screen of the software is shown in 
Figure 18-48.

Software Licensing and Prohibited Content or Activity
Many organizations have documented a code of conduct in policies that apply to their employees 
and/or customers. As an employee, you need to be aware of these codes of conduct and the proce-
dures to follow when you believe these company policies have been broken. Examples of prohibited 
content or activity might be when an employee saves pornographic photos to company computers, 
uses company computers and time for personal shopping, or installs pirated software on these computers.

Software Licensing
As an IT support technician, you need to be especially aware of the issues surrounding software 
licensing. As you have learned, open source software can be freely distributed and installed, 
but closed source software is owned by a vendor and a license is required to use the software. 
When someone purchases software from a software vendor, that person or organization has only 
purchased a commercial license for 
the software, which is the right to use 
it. The buyer does not legally own the 
software and, therefore, does not have 
the right to distribute it. The right to 
copy the work, called a copyright, 
belongs to the creator of the work or 
others to whom the creator transfers 
this right. Copyrights are intended 
to legally protect the intellectual 
property rights of organizations 
or individuals to creative works, 
which include books, images, and 
software. Your rights to use or copy 
the software are clearly stated in the 
End User License Agreement (EULA) 
that you agree to when you install the 
software (see Figure 18-49).

Security Strategies
Making unauthorized copies of original software violates the Federal Copyright Act of 1976 and is 
called software piracy or, more officially, software copyright infringement. (This act allows for one backup 
copy of software to be made.) Making a copy of software and then selling it or giving it away is a violation 
of the law. Normally, only the employee who violated the copyright law is liable for infringement; however, 
in some cases, an employer or supervisor is also held responsible, even when the copies were made without 
the employer’s knowledge.
Notes When an individual or organization purchases the right to install one instance of software, the license is 
called a personal license. By purchasing a site license, also called an enterprise license, a company can obtain the 
right to multiple installations of software.
Many software companies, including Microsoft, have implemented measures to control the use of their 
software, which is called digital rights management (DRM). For example, the retail release of Windows 8.1 
must be activated with a valid product key before it will run and Microsoft carefully verifies and monitors 
that this product key is used only in one installation. 
Corporate Policies for Dealing with Prohibited Content or Activity
When you start a new job, find out from your employer how to deal with prohibited content 
or activity so that you can follow corporate policies and security best practices. Here are some 
things you need to know:
	When you identify what you believe to be an infringement of the law or the company’s code of conduct, 
where do you turn to report the issue? Make sure you go only through proper channels; don’t spread 
rumors or accusations with those who are not in these channels.
	What data or device should you immediately preserve as evidence for what you believe has happened? 
For example, if you believe you have witnessed a customer or employee using a company computer for 
a crime, should you remove and secure the hard drive from the computer, or should you remove and 
secure the entire computer?
	Proper documentation surrounding the evidence of a crime is crucial to a criminal investigation. What 
documentation are you expected to submit and to whom is it submitted? This documentation might 
track the chain of custody for the evidence, which includes exactly what, when, and from whom 
evidence was collected; the condition of this evidence; and how the evidence was secured while it was 
in your possession. It also includes a paper trail of exactly to whom the evidence has been passed on 
and when. For example, suppose you suspect that a criminal act has happened and you hold a CD 
that you believe contains evidence of this crime. You need to carefully document exactly when and 
how you received the CD. Also, don’t pass it on to someone else in your organization unless you have 
this person’s signature on a chain-of-custody document so that you can later prove you handled the 
evidence appropriately. You don’t want the evidence to be disallowed in a court of law because you 
have been accused of misconduct or there are allegations of tampering with the evidence. Also know 
that more information than a signature, such as copy of a driver’s license, might be required to 
identify persons in the chain of custody.

Chapter Summary
>> Chapter Summary
Securing a Windows Personal Computer
	The netplwiz command can be used to require the user to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete to sign in to Windows.
	Windows power settings can be used to lock down a computer after a short period of inactivity and to 
require a password to unlock the computer.
	A strong password is not easy to guess and contains uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and 
symbols. Using long passwords is the best protection against attack.
	The Encrypted File System (EFS) is used with an NTFS volume for Windows business and professional 
editions.
	Windows Firewall can block all communication initiated outside the computer and can allow exceptions 
for certain programs, protocols, ports, and remote computers.
	Local Security Policies in Group Policy are used in Windows professional and business editions to set 
policies that can secure the local computer.
	BitLocker Encryption with Windows professional or business editions can lock down the entire hard 
drive. It can be set to authenticate the computer, authenticate the user, or authenticate both the computer 
and the user.
	UEFI/BIOS security features include passwords, drive lock passwords, UEFI secure boot, and support for 
a TPM chip and an intrusion-detection device.
Securing a Mobile Device
	Controlling access to a mobile device can be accomplished by a screen lock, biometric authentication 
(for example, fingerprint or voice recognition), full device encryption, system lock after failed login 
attempts, and multifactor authentication.
	Software used to secure a mobile device includes OS updates and patches, anti-malware, downloading 
software from only trusted sources, firewalls, and locator and remote wipe apps. 
	In a corporate environment, on-boarding and off-boarding company policies for BYOD might include 
remote backup apps, remote wipes, encryption, firewalls, VPN connections, anti-malware, and apps that 
prevent jailbreaking and rooting.
Additional Methods to Protect Resources
	Large networks might use a security token or smart card in addition to a Windows password to authen-
ticate a user in multifactor and/or mutual authentication.
	Security tokens include a smart card (key fob, wireless token, RFID badge, or cell phone with token) and 
biometric data (iris scan, retinal scan, or fingerprint scan).
	Physical security can include a locked door, lock and chain, privacy filter, theft-prevention plate, and mantrap.
	A UTM appliance might include a firewall, anti-malware, access control lists, intrusion detection and 
prevention systems, and a VPN.
	Data can be partly or completely destroyed using a paper shredder, low-level format, zero-fill utility, 
drill, degausser, or Secure Erase utility.
	Security methods include educating users against social engineering and how to best protect a laptop 
when traveling.

Security Strategies
Dealing with Malicious Software on Personal Computers
	Malware includes a virus, spyware, keylogger, worm, Trojan, rootkit, ransomware, zero-day attack, 
man-in-the-middle attack, zombies, botnets, and dictionary attacks.
	Symptoms that malware is present include pop-up ads, slow performance, error messages, file errors, 
spam, and strange processes running.
	To protect against malware, (1) know how to identify common malware symptoms, (2) quarantine the 
infected system, (3) disable System Restore, (4) remediate the system, (5) protect the system with scheduled 
scans and updates, (6) enable System Protection and create a restore point, and (7) educate the end user. 
Some systems become so highly infected that the only solution is to reinstall Windows.
Dealing with Malicious Software on Mobile Devices
	Symptoms of malware on mobile devices include battery drain, slow speeds, leaked data, dropped calls, 
unintended Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections, location tracking, unauthorized use of camera or 
microphone, and root access.
	To remediate an infected device, uninstall the offending app, update the OS, factory reset the device, 
and/or restore data from backup.
	Wi-Fi and cellular network analyzers can help an organization monitor and protect Wi-Fi and cellular 
networks. 
Software Licensing and Prohibited Content or Activity
	Commercial licensing of software can be a personal license or enterprise license. Terms of the licensing 
agreement are found in the EULA.
	A chain-of-custody document provides a paper trail of the evidence in a criminal case and includes how, 
when, where, and by whom evidence was preserved and secured.

Notes For heavy business use, sometimes it’s best to purchase one machine for one purpose, instead of bundling 
many functions into a single machine. For example, if you need a scanner and a printer, purchase a good printer and a 
good scanner rather than a combo machine. Routine maintenance and troubleshooting are easier and less expensive on 
single-purpose machines, although the initial cost is higher. On the other hand, for home or small office use, a combo 
device can save money and counter space.
Laser Printers
A laser printer is a type of electro-photographic printer that can range from a small, personal 
desktop model to a large, network printer capable of handling and printing large volumes 
continuously. Figure 19-1 shows an example of a typical laser printer for a small office.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam 
expects you to be familiar with these types of 
printers: laser, inkjet, thermal, and impact. You 
also need to know about virtual printers.
Laser printers require the interaction 
of mechanical, electrical, and optical 
technologies. Laser printers work by placing 
toner on an electrically charged rotating 
drum (sometimes called the imaging drum) 
and then depositing the toner on paper as the 
paper moves through the system at the same 
speed the drum is turning. Figure 19-2 shows 
the seven steps of laser printing.

Note that Figure 19-2 shows only a cross-section of the drum, mechanisms, and paper. Remember that 
the drum is as wide as a sheet of paper. The mirror, blades, and rollers in the drawing are also as wide as 
paper. Also know that toner responds to a charge and moves from one surface to another if the second 
surface has a more positive charge than the first.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know the seven steps of laser printing.
The seven steps of laser printing are listed next:
1. Processing the image. A laser printer processes and prints an entire page at one time. The page comes 
to the printer encoded in a language the printer understands and the firmware inside the printer processes 
the incoming data to produce a bitmap (a bunch of bits in rows and columns) of the final page, which is 
stored in the printer’s memory. One bitmap image is produced for monochrome images. For color images, 
one bitmap is produced for each of four colors. (The colors are blue, red, yellow, and black, better known 
as cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, and sometimes written as CMYK.)
2. Charging or conditioning. During charging, the drum is conditioned by a roller that places a high 
uniform electrical charge of -600 V on the surface of the drum. The roller is called the primary charging 
roller or primary corona, which is charged by a high-voltage power supply assembly. For some printers, 
a corona wire is used instead of the charging roller to charge the drum.
3. Exposing or writing. A laser beam controlled by motors and a mirror scans across the drum until it 
completes the correct number of passes. The laser beam is turned on and off continually as it makes 
a single pass down the length of the drum, once for each raster line, so that dots are exposed only 
where toner should go to print the image. For example, for a 1200 dots per inch (dpi) printer, the beam 
makes 1200 passes for every one inch of the drum circumference. For a 1200-dpi printer, 1200 dots are 
exposed or not exposed along the drum for every inch of linear pass. The 1200 dots per inch down this 
single pass, combined with 1200 passes per inch of drum circumference, accomplish the resolution of 
1200 × 1200 dots per square inch of many laser printers. The laser beam writes an image to the drum 
surface as a -100 V charge. The -100 V charge on this image area will be used in the developing stage 
to transmit toner to the drum surface.
Notes A laser printer can produce better quality printouts than a dot matrix printer, even when printing at the same 
dpi, because it can vary the size of the dots it prints, creating a sharp, clear image. Hewlett-Packard (HP) calls this 
technology of varying the size of dots REt (Resolution Enhancement technology).
4. Developing. The developing cylinder applies toner to the surface of the drum. The toner is charged and 
sticks to the developing cylinder because of a magnet inside the cylinder. A control blade prevents too 
much toner from sticking to the cylinder surface. As the cylinder rotates very close to the drum, the 
toner is attracted to the part of the surface of the drum that has a -100 V charge and repelled from 
the -600 V part of the drum surface. The result is that toner sticks to the drum where the laser beam 
has hit and is repelled from the area where the laser beam has not hit.
5. Transferring. In the transferring step (shown in Figure 19-2), a strong electrical charge draws the toner 
off the drum onto the paper. This is the first step that takes place outside the cartridge and the first 
step that involves the paper. The soft, black transfer roller puts a positive charge on the paper to pull 
the toner from the drum onto the paper. Then the static charge eliminator (refer again to Figure 19-2) 
weakens the charges on both the paper and the drum so that the paper does not stick to the drum. The 
stiffness of the paper and the small radius of the drum also help the paper move away from the drum 
and toward the fusing assembly. Very thin paper can wrap around the drum, which is why printer 
manuals usually instruct you to use only paper designated for laser printers.

Supporting Printers and Customizing a System
6. Fusing. The fuser assembly uses heat and pressure to fuse the toner to the paper. Up to this point, the 
toner is merely sitting on the paper. The fusing rollers apply heat to the paper, which causes the toner 
to melt, and the rollers apply pressure to bond the melted toner into the paper. The temperature 
of the rollers is monitored by the printer. If the temperature exceeds an allowed maximum value 
(410 degrees F for some printers), the printer shuts down.
7. Cleaning. A sweeper strip cleans the drum of any residual toner, which is swept away by a sweeping 
blade. The charge left on the drum is then neutralized. Some printers use erase lamps in the top cover of 
the printer for this purpose. The lamps use red light so as not to damage the photosensitive drum.
For color laser printers, the writing process repeats four times, one for each toner color of cyan, magenta, 
yellow, and black. Each color requires a separate image drum. Then, the paper passes to the fusing stage, 
when the fuser bonds all toner to the paper and aids in blending the four tones to form specific colors.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to be familiar with these laser printer terms: imaging drum, fuser 
assembly, transfer belt, transfer roller, pickup roller, separate pads, and duplexing assembly.
Cartridges and Other Replaceable Parts
The charging, exposing, developing, and cleaning steps use the printer components that undergo the most 
wear. To make the printer last longer, these steps are done inside a removable cartridge that can be replaced. 
For older printers, all four steps were done inside one cartridge. For newer printers, the cleaning, charging, 
and exposing steps are done inside the image drum cartridge. The developing cylinder is located inside the 
toner cartridge. The transferring is done using a transfer belt that can be replaced, and the fusing is done 
inside a fuser cartridge.
By using these multiple cartridges inside laser printers, the cost of maintaining a printer is reduced. You 
can replace one cartridge without having to replace them all. The toner cartridge needs replacing the most 
often, followed by the image drum, the fuser cartridge, and the transfer assembly, in that order.
Other printer parts that might need replacing include the pickup roller that pushes forward a sheet of 
paper from the paper tray and the separation pad (also called separate pad) that keeps more than one 
sheet of paper from moving forward. If the pickup roller is worn, paper misfeeds into the printer. If the 
separation pad is worn, multiple sheets of paper will be drawn into the printer. Sometimes you can clean 
a pickup roller or separation pad to prolong its life before it needs replacing.
Notes Before replacing expensive parts in a printer, consider whether a new printer might be more cost effective 
than repairing the old one.
Duplexing Assembly
A printer that is able to print on both sides of the paper is called a duplex printer or a double-sided 
printer. Many laser printers and a few inkjet printers offer this feature. After the front of the paper is 
printed, a duplexing assembly, which contains several rollers, turns the paper around and draws it back 
through the print process to print on the back of the paper. Alternately, some high-end printers have two 
print engines so that both sides of the paper are printed at the same time.
Inkjet Printers
An inkjet printer (see Figure 19-3) uses a type of ink-dispersion printing and doesn’t normally 
provide the high-quality resolution of laser printers. Inkjet printers are popular because they 
are small and can print color inexpensively. Most inkjet printers today can print high-quality 
photos, especially when used with photo-quality paper.

An inkjet printer uses a print head 
that moves across the paper, creating 
one line of the image with each pass. 
The printer puts ink on the paper using 
a matrix of small dots. Different types 
of inkjet printers form their droplets 
of ink in different ways. Printer 
manufacturers use several technologies, 
but the most popular is the bubble-jet. 
Bubble-jet printers use tubes of ink that 
have tiny resistors near the end of each 
tube. These resistors heat up and cause 
the ink to boil. Then, a tiny air bubble 
of ionized ink (ink with an electrical 
charge) is ejected onto the paper. A 
typical bubble-jet print head has 64 or 
128 tiny nozzles, all of which can fire 
a droplet simultaneously. (High-end 
printers can have as many as 3,000 
nozzles.) Plates carrying a magnetic 
charge direct the path of ink onto the 
paper to form shapes.
Inkjet printers include one or more 
ink cartridges to hold the different colors 
of ink for the printer. Figure 19-4 shows 
two ink cartridges. A black cartridge is 
on the left and a three-color cartridge 
is on the right. For this printer, a print 
head is built into each ink cartridge.
A stepper motor moves the print 
head and ink cartridges across the 
paper using a carriage and belt to move 
the assembly and a stabilizing bar to 
control the movement (see Figure 19-5). 
A paper tray can hold a stack of paper, 
or a paper feeder on the back of the 
printer can hold a few sheets of paper. 
The sheets stand up in the feeder and 
are dispensed one at a time. Rollers pull

Figure 19-4  The ink cartridges of an inkjet printer
a single sheet into the printer from the paper tray or paper feeder. A motor powers these rollers and times 
the sheet going through the printer in the increments needed to print the image. When the printer is not in 
use, the assemblage sits in the far-right position shown in Figure 19-4, which is called the home position or 
parked position. This position helps protect the ink in the cartridges from drying out.
Some inkjet printers offer duplex printing. These printers are larger than normal inkjet printers because 
of the added space required for the duplexing assembly. For duplex printing, be sure to use heavy paper 
(rated at 24-pound paper or higher) so the ink doesn’t bleed through.

Supporting Printers and Customizing a System
When purchasing an inkjet printer, look for the kind that uses two or four separate cartridges. One 
cartridge is used for black ink. Three cartridges, one for each color, give better quality color than one 
cartridge that holds all three colors. Some low-end inkjet printers use a single three-color cartridge and 
don’t have a black ink cartridge. These printers must combine all colors of ink to produce a dull black. 
Having a separate cartridge for black ink means that it prints true black and, more important, does not use 
the more expensive colored ink. To save money, you should be able to replace an empty cartridge without 
having to replace all cartridges.

Notes Weight and brightness are the two primary ways of measuring paper quality. The rated weight of paper (for 
example, 20 pounds to 32 pounds) determines the thickness of the paper. Brightness is measured on a scale of 92 to 100.
Notes To save money, you can refill an ink cartridge, and many companies will sell you the tools and ink you 
need as well as show you how to do it. You can also purchase refilled cartridges at reduced prices. When you purchase 
ink cartridges, make sure you know if they are new or refilled. Also, for best results, don’t refill a cartridge more than 
three times.
Inkjet printers tend to smudge on inexpensive paper, and they are slower than laser printers. If a printed 
page later gets damp, the ink can run and get quite messy. The quality of the paper used with inkjet 
printers significantly affects the quality of printed output. You should use only paper that is designed for 
an inkjet printer, and you should use a high-grade paper to get the best results.
Notes Photos printed on an inkjet printer tend to fade over time, more so than photos produced professionally. 
To make your photos last longer, use high-quality paper (rated at high gloss or studio gloss) and use fade-resistant ink 
(such as Vivera ink by HP). Then protect these photos from exposure to light, heat, humidity, and polluted air. To best 
protect photos made by an inkjet printer, keep them in a photo album rather than displayed and exposed to light.

Impact Printers
An impact printer creates a printed page by using some mechanism that touches or hits the 
paper. The best-known impact printer is a dot matrix printer, which prints only text that 
it receives as raw data. It has a print head that moves across the width of the paper, using 
pins to print a matrix of dots on the page. The pins shoot against a cloth ribbon, which hits 
the paper, depositing the ink. The ribbon provides both the ink for printing and the lubrication for the 
pinheads. The quality of the print is poor compared with other printer types. However, three reasons you 
see impact printers still in use are: (1) They use continuous tractor feeds and fanfold paper (also called 
computer paper) rather than individual sheets of paper, making them useful for logging ongoing events 
or data, (2) they can use carbon paper to print multiple copies at the same time, and (3) they are extremely 
durable, give little trouble, and seem to last forever.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know about the print head, ribbon, and tractor feed in an 
impact printer and about impact paper used in the printer.
Maintaining a dot matrix impact 
printer is easy to do. The impact paper 
used by impact printers comes as a box 
of fanfold paper or in rolls (used with 
receipt printers). When the paper is 
nearing the end of the stack or roll, a 
color on the edge alerts you to replace 
the paper. Occasionally, you should 
replace the ribbon of a dot matrix 
printer. If the print head fails, check on 
the cost of replacing the head versus the 
cost of buying a new printer. Sometimes, 
the cost of the head is so high it’s best to 
just buy a new printer. Overheating can 
damage a print head (see Figure 19-6), 
so keep it as cool as possible to make it 
last longer. Keep the printer in a cool, 
well-ventilated area, and don’t use it to print  
more than 50 to 75 pages without allowing the  
head to cool down.
Print head

cool as possible so that it will last longer
Thermal Printers
Thermal printers use heat to create an image. 
Two types of thermal printers are a direct 
thermal printer and a thermal transfer printer. 
The older direct thermal printer burns dots onto 
special coated paper, called thermal paper, as was done by 
older fax machines. The process requires no ink and does not 
use a ribbon. Direct thermal printers are often used as receipt 
printers that use rolls of thermal paper (see Figure 19-7). The 
printed image can fade over time.
A thermal transfer printer uses a ribbon that contains wax-
based ink. The heating element melts the ribbon (also called

foil) onto special thermal paper so that it stays 
glued to the paper as the feed assembly moves 
the paper through the printer. Thermal transfer 
printers are used to print receipts, barcode labels, 
clothing labels, or container labels. Figure 19-8 
shows a thermal transfer printer used to make 
barcodes and other labels.
Thermal printers are reliable and easy to 
maintain. When you are responsible for a thermal 
printer, you know it’s time to replace the paper roll 
when the roll shows the color down one edge. It’s 
important to regularly clean the print head because 
build up can harden over time and permanently 
damage the head. Follow the printer manufacturer’s 
directions to clean the print head. Some thermal 
printer ribbons have a print head cleaning stripe 
at the end of the ribbon, and it’s a good idea to 
clean the head each time you replace the ribbon. 
Additionally, some manufacturers suggest cleaning 
the head with isopropyl alcohol wipes.
When cleaning, remove any dust and debris that gets 
down in the print head assembly. As you work, ground 
yourself to protect the sensitive heating element against 
static electricity. Don’t touch the heating element with 
your fingers. Also, to prolong the life of the print head, 
use the lowest heat setting for the heating element that  
still gives good printing results.
Table 19-1 lists some printer manufacturers.

Using Windows to Install, Share, and Manage Printers
In this part of the chapter, you learn to install local and network printers, share an installed 
printer, and remotely use a shared printer. You also learn about virtual printing and how 
to configure printer add-ons and features. We begin with learning about a local printer and 
network printer.

Local or Network Printer
A printer connects to a single computer or to the network. A local printer connects directly 
to a computer by way of a USB port, serial port, or wireless connection (Bluetooth or Wi-Fi). 
Some printers support more than one method. A network printer has an Ethernet port to 
connect directly to the network or uses Wi-Fi to connect to a wireless access point. Some 
printers have both an Ethernet port and a USB port (see Figure 19-9). These printers can be installed as 
either a network printer (connecting directly to the network) or a local printer (connecting directly to 
a computer).

The two ways to install a printer and make it available on a network are:
	 Local printer. A local printer can be attached to a computer using a port (for example, USB, serial, or 
wireless) on the computer (see Computer A in Figure 19-10). For some network printers, it is possible to 
set up a local printer by using an Ethernet cable connected to the Ethernet port on the network printer 
and the Ethernet port on the computer. The printer can be dedicated to only this one computer, or you can 
share the printer for network users. For a shared local printer to be available to other computers on the 
network, the host computer must be turned on and not in sleep or standby mode. For another computer 
on the network to use the shared printer, the printer drivers must be installed on the remote computer.

Wired or Wireless Printer Connections
Connecting a wired printer (USB or Ethernet) is easy:
A+ 
220-901 
1.12, 
1.13
	 USB. Plug the USB cable into the printer and computer and Windows installs the printer 
automatically.
	 Serial. For a printer with a serial port, plug the serial cable into the printer and computer 
and install the printer as a local printer.
	 Ethernet. Plug the Ethernet cable into the printer and network wall jack, switch, or router and install the 
printer as a network printer on any computer on the network.
Connecting a wireless printer is a little more complex:
	 Bluetooth. For a Bluetooth printer, which is installed as a local printer, turn on Bluetooth in Windows, 
move the printer within range of the computer, and watch as the two Bluetooth devices pair up.
	 Wi-Fi ad hoc network. For a Wi-Fi printer, you can connect the printer and computer directly to each 
other in a Wi-Fi ad hoc mode network. Put the printer within 30 feet of the computer. Then, in 
Windows 7, open the Network and Sharing Center, click Set up a new connection or network, click Set 
up a wireless ad hoc (computer-to-computer) network, and follow directions on screen. Windows 8 does 
not support ad hoc Wi-Fi; however, you can use third-party software to do the job. When using an ad 
hoc network, next, install the printer as a local printer. Some printers can handle up to four computers 
connected in an ad hoc Wi-Fi network.
	 Wi-Fi infrastructure network. In infrastructure mode, Wi-Fi devices connect to a Wi-Fi access point, 
such as a SOHO router. Put the Wi-Fi printer within range of the access point and use controls on the 
printer to select the Wi-Fi network and enter the security key to the network if one is required. All Wi-Fi 
printers support infrastructure connections and some Wi-Fi printers can handle ad hoc connections.

Notes Apple computers and mobile devices can print to AirPrint printers without having to first install the printer. 
For a Mac or iOS device to use an AirPrint printer, simply open the Print menu in any app. If an AirPrint printer is on 
the network, it will appear in the list of printers. An AirPrint printer is always capable of Wi-Fi connections to a wireless 
network and some have a USB or Ethernet port for wired connections. AirPrint printers are also capable of cloud printing, 
discussed later in this chapter.
Install a Local or Network Printer
When you install a printer, printer drivers are required that are compatible with the installed 
operating system. Be sure to use 32-bit drivers for a 32-bit OS and 64-bit drivers for a 64-bit 
OS. Windows has many printer drivers built in. The drivers also come on a CD bundled with 
the printer or you can download them from the printer manufacturer’s website.
Also, for some types of printers, you can launch the installation program that came bundled on CD with the 
printer or downloaded from the printer manufacturer’s website. On the other hand, you can use the Windows 8/7 
Devices and Printers window to install a printer. These windows are also used to manage and uninstall printers.

2.	 Select the printer and click Next. If your printer isn’t listed, click The printer that I want isn’t listed and 
select the printer from a list of printers for which Windows has drivers.
3.	 In the next box (see the left side of Figure 19-12), select the brand and model printer to use the drivers 
kept by Windows. To use drivers stored on CD or previously downloaded from the web, click Have Disk. 
The Install From Disk box appears (see the right side of Figure 19-12). Click Browse to locate the drivers; 
Windows is looking for an .inf file. Be sure to select 32-bit or 64-bit drivers, depending on which type of 
OS you are using.
Figure 19-12  Locate printer drivers on CD or downloaded from the web
4.	 Continue to follow the wizard to install the printer. Dialog boxes give you the opportunity to change the 
name of the printer and designate the printer as the default printer. You are also given the opportunity 
to test the printer. It’s always a good idea to print a test page when you install a printer to verify the 
installation works.
	
	 You can also send a test page to the printer at any time. To do so, right-click the printer in the Devices 
and Printers window and select Printer properties. On the General tab of the Properties box, click Print Test 
Page (see Figure 19-13).
	
	 Rather than using the Windows Devices and Printers window to start a printer installation, you can also 
start the installation using the setup program on the CD that came bundled with the printer or using the 
setup program downloaded from the printer manufacturer’s website. Figure 19-14 shows one such window 
in the setup process for a Canon printer. This method might work when the first method fails.
Notes Use the System window to find out if a 32-bit or 64-bit OS is installed. To open the System window 
in Windows 8, press Win+X and click System. In Windows 7, click Start, right-click Computer, and select 
Properties.

Supporting Printers and Customizing a System
Share a Printer on a Network
Each computer on a network can connect directly to a network printer. On the other hand, 
one computer or device can share the printer with other computers. Three general ways to 
share a printer on a network are to use a:
	 Computer as a print server. When your computer hosting a printer shares the printer with other 
computers on the network, the computer is called a print server. One reason to require that all computers 
connect to a shared network printer rather than mapping directly to the network printer is so that you can 
manage all print jobs from one centralized location. In this situation, you can use Print Management in 
the Administrative Tools group of Control Panel to monitor the printer and solve printer problems from 
a centralized location. You learned to use Print Management in the chapter, “Windows Resources on a 
Network.”
	 Hardware print server. To connect a USB, Bluetooth, or serial-port printer to the network, you can use 
a hardware print server, such as the one shown in Figure 19-15. This device has a USB port for a USB 
printer and can connect to a Wi-Fi or Ethernet network. Plug the USB cable from the printer into the 
USB port of the hardware print server and connect the device to the network, using either a wired 
or wireless connection. The printer appears as a network printer on the network, and any computer on 
the network can connect to it.

Figure 19-15  This hardware print server lets you connect a USB printer to the

	 Printer firmware print server. 
Some advanced printers have 
print server programs included 
in the printer firmware that 
allow you to manage print 
protocols, start or stop jobs in 
the print queue, reorder jobs 
in the queue, cancel specific 
jobs coming from a particular 
computer on the network, and 
set up your email address so 
the printer alerts you by email 
when it has a problem.
When using a computer as the print server, before you share an installed printer, verify these Windows 
settings for shared resources:
	 Security settings. To share resources on a network, make sure the Windows 8 network security is set to 
Private or the Windows 7 network security is set to Work or Home. In addition, in the Network and 
Sharing Center, you can click Change advanced sharing settings and verify Turn on file and printer sharing 
is selected, which is the default setting for a Windows 8 Private or Windows 7 Home or Work network.
	 Wake-on-LAN. Remote users will not be able to use a shared printer if the computer sharing the printer 
is asleep. You can configure Wake-on-LAN to cause network activity to wake up a sleeping computer. 
How to do that is covered in the chapter, “Connecting To and Setting Up a Network.”
Configure and Use a Shared Printer
To share an installed local or network printer with others on the network, follow these steps:

2.	 You can then change the share name of the printer. Notice in Figure 19-16 the option to control where print 
jobs are rendered. A print job can be prepared (rendered) on the remote computer (client computer) or this 
computer (print server). Your choice depends on which computer you think should carry this burden. You 
can test several print jobs on remote computers with rendering done at either location and see which method 
best uses computing resources on the network.
Figure 19-16  Share the printer and make decisions as to how printer sharing is handled
Notes Group Policy under Windows 7/Vista can be used to limit and control all kinds of printer-related tasks, 
including the number of printers that can be installed, how print jobs are sent to print servers (rendered or not 
rendered), which print servers the computer can use, and which printers on a network the computer can use.
3.	 If you want to make drivers for the printer available to remote users who are using an operating system 
other than the OS on this computer, click Additional Drivers.
4.	 The Additional Drivers box opens (see the right side of Figure 19-16). For 32-bit operating systems, select 
x86. For 64-bit operating systems, select x64. Click OK to close the box. You might be asked for the Windows 
setup DVD or other access to the installation files.
5.	 Click OK to close the Properties box. A shared printer shows a two-friends icon under it or in the status 
bar in the Devices and Printers window, and the printer is listed in the Network group in File Explorer or 
Windows Explorer of other computers on the network.
Secure a Shared Printer
Consider the security of your shared printer and the security of documents printed:
	 Secure the printer. On the printer’s Properties box (refer back to Figure 19-16), click the Security tab to 
manage who has access to the printer and permissions allowed. Notice in Figure 19-17 that the Everyone 
group can print but is not allowed to manage the printer or documents sent to it. Just as with shared 
files and folders, you can share the printer with specific users and/or set up a customized user group that 
is allowed to use a printer.

	 Secure the data. By default, documents sent to the printer are cached (spooled) to the hard drive of the 
print server and also cached on a hard drive that might be installed in a high-end printer. To prevent 
these print jobs from being hacked, don’t allow caching to either hard drive. In Windows, to change the 
default setting for spooling, click the Advanced tab of the printer’s Properties box (see Figure 19-18). 
Select Print directly to the printer. Not spooling to the hard drive slows down the printing process.

Use a Shared Printer
To install a shared printer on a remote computer, you can (1) Use the Devices and Printers window or 
(2) use File Explorer or Windows Explorer. Here are the general steps for both methods:
	 Devices and Printers window. On a remote computer, in the Devices and Printers window, click Add a 
printer and follow the directions on screen to add a network printer. Select the shared printer, which has 
a host name in the printer address column (refer back to Figure 19-11). Windows attempts to use printer 
drivers found on the host computer. If it doesn’t find the drivers, you will be given the opportunity to 
provide them on CD or another media.
	
	 If you don’t see a shared printer in the list of printers to add, the user account might not be authorized 
to access resources on the remote computer. In this situation, use the File Explorer or Windows Explorer 
method discussed next, which allows the user to authenticate to the remote computer.
Notes When print jobs are spooled and the printer is not working or is turned off, the documents can back up in 
the printer queue. To manage the printer queue, double-click the printer in the Devices and Printers window. Click the 
queue link and use the menu bar in the queue window to manage the printer’s queue.
Notes If you don’t see a shared printer in the list of printers, consider if the printer is shared by a Mac computer on 
the network and Bonjour is not running on your Windows computer. Bonjour is an Apple program that is used to interface 
between computers and devices and share content and services between them, and is used by Windows to discover a printer 
shared by a Mac computer. If you suspect a Mac is sharing a printer, open the Services tab of Task Manager in Windows 
and verify Bonjour is running. You can download the Bonjour Print Services for Windows from the Apple website at https://
support.apple.com/downloads/bonjour%20for%20windows.
	 File Explorer or Windows Explorer. In the Explorer window, drill down into the computer that is sharing 
the printer. If the Windows Security box appears, you need to authenticate to the remote computer with a 
valid user account and password on the remote computer, as shown in Figure 19-19a. (For the user name 
to work, the printer must be shared with this specific user or user group and the password much match 
the password of this user on the remote computer.) After authentication, you can see the shared printer. 
Right-click the printer and select Connect. A warning box appears (see Figure 19-19b). Click Install 
driver and follow directions on screen.

Virtual Printing
Printing to a file instead of producing a hard copy at a printer is called virtual printing. The types 
of files you can virtually print depends on the software installed on your system. To see your 
options for virtual printing, open the Print menu or dialog box for an application. For example, 
Figure 19-20 shows the results for one system.

1.13
Figure 19-20  The file types available for 
virtual printing depend on 
software installed in the system
The items of interest listed in the figure are these types 
of files:
	 PDF file. Because Adobe Acrobat is installed on this system, 
it is possible to virtually print to a PDF file.
	 Image file, also called a bitmap file. Snagit is imaging 
software normally used to take screen shots. When you 
print to Snagit, you create an image that appears in the 
Snagit window. Then, you can use Snagit to save the image 
as a PNG, GIF, JPG, BMP, TIF, or another image file 
format.
	 XPS file. Windows includes the Microsoft XPS Document 
Writer, which creates an XPS file. The file is similar to a 
PDF and can be viewed, edited, printed, faxed, emailed, or 
posted on websites. In Windows, the file is viewed in a 
browser window.
	 Print to file. When you check Print to file on a Print menu, 
the print job is created for the currently selected printer 
and saved to a PRN file. The file contains the information 
a printer needs to print the document. Saving a print job to 
a PRN file and later printing it worked with older printers, 
but doesn’t work with modern printers. Today, it’s better 
to create a PDF or XPS document.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know 
about virtual printing to PDF, XPS, and image files, and about the 
option, Print to file.
Cloud Printing
With cloud printing, you can print to a printer anywhere on the Internet from a personal 
computer or mobile device connected to the Internet. Cloud printing is a type of client/server 
application. Client software on a computer or mobile device sends a document (which might 
be encrypted) or a print job to server software on the local network that funnels the print 
jobs to a printer on its network. The computer or mobile device with the client software installed can be 
anywhere on the Internet. Examples of cloud printing software, also called web-based printing software 
or web-to-print software, are Web to Print by B2Cprint (b2cprint.com) and Print Manager Plus by Print 
Manager (printmanager.com). For best security, make sure your software can encrypt a document or print 
job sent over the Internet.

Print in the Cloud
To practice cloud printing using Google Cloud Print, you’ll need a computer with an installed printer 
and another computer somewhere on the Internet. For the easiest solution to using Google Cloud 
Print, both computers need Google Chrome installed. You’ll also need a Google account.
On the computer with an installed printer, do the following:
1.	 If you don’t already have Google Chrome, go to google.com/chrome/browser/desktop, download, and install it.
2.	 Open Google Chrome and enter chrome://devices in the address box. Click Add printers. Sign in to Google 
with your Google account. If you don’t already have an account, you can click Create account to create one.
3.	 The list of installed printers appears. Uncheck all printers except the one you want to use for cloud printing. 
Click Add Printer(s).
On a computer anywhere on the Internet, do the following:
4.	 If necessary, install Google Chrome.
5.	 Open Google Chrome and sign in with your Google account. Navigate to a webpage you want to print. Click 
the menu icon in the upper-right corner of the Chrome window and click Print.
6.	 On the Print page, click Change and select the printer, which is listed in the Google Cloud Print group. Click 
Print. The page prints over the web to your printer.

Printer Maintenance and Upgrades
Printers generally last for years if they are properly used and maintained. To get the most out 
of a printer, it’s important to follow the manufacturer’s directions when using the device and to 
perform the necessary routine maintenance. For example, the life of a printer can be shortened 
if you allow the printer to overheat, don’t use approved paper, or don’t install consumable 
maintenance kits when they are required.
A+ 
220-901

Online Support for Printers
The printer manufacturer’s website is an important resource when supporting printers. Here 
are some things to look for:
A+ 
220-901 
1.15, 4.6
	 Online documentation. Expect the printer manufacturer’s website to include documentation 
on installing, configuring, troubleshooting, using, upgrading, and maintaining the printer. 
Also look for information on printer parts and warranty, compatibility information, specifications and 
features of your printer, and how to recycle or dispose of a printer.
	 A knowledge base of common problems and what to do about them. Some websites offer a forum where 
you can communicate with others responsible for supporting a particular printer. Also look for an online 
chat link or email address for technical support.
	 Updated device drivers. Sometimes you can solve printer problems by downloading and installing the 
latest drivers. Also, a manufacturer makes new features and options available through these drivers. Be 
sure you download files for the correct printer and OS.
	 Replacement parts. When a printer part breaks, buy only parts made by or approved by the printer 
manufacturer. Manufacturers also sell consumable supplies such as toner and ink cartridges.
	 Printer maintenance kits. The best practice is to buy everything you need for routine maintenance either 
from the printer manufacturer or an approved vendor. If you buy from a nonapproved vendor, you risk 
damaging the printer, voiding its warranty, or shortening its life span.
	 Firmware updates. Some high-end printers have firmware that can be flashed to solve problems and add 
features. Be careful to download the correct update for your printer.
Here are a few safety tips when working with printers:
	 Hot to touch. Some laser printer parts can get hot enough to burn you while in operation. Before you 
work inside a laser printer, turn it off, unplug it, and wait about 30 minutes for it to cool down.
Now let’s turn our attention to tasks you might be called on to do when maintaining and upgrading 
a printer.

Supporting Printers and Customizing a System
	 Dangerous electricity. A printer might still keep power even when the printer on/off switch is turned off. 
To ensure that the printer has no power, unplug it. Even when a laser printer is unplugged, internal 
components might still hold a dangerous electrical charge for some time.
	 Laser beam. For your protection, laser printers use a laser beam that is always enclosed inside a protective 
case inside the printer. Therefore, when servicing a laser printer, you should never have to look at the laser 
beam, which can damage your eyes.
	 Static electricity. To protect memory modules and hard drives inside printers, be sure to use an ESD strap 
to protect these sensitive components when installing them. You don’t need to wear an ESD strap when 
exchanging consumables such as toner cartridges, fuser assembles, or image drums.
	 When no one is around. Here’s one more tip to stay safe, but I don’t want it to frighten you: When you 
work inside high-voltage equipment such as a laser printer, don’t do it when no one else is around. If you 
have an emergency, someone needs to be close by to help you.
Notes When working with laser printer toner cartridges, if you get toner dust on your clothes or hands while exchanging 
the cartridge, don’t use hot water to clean it up. Remember that heat sets the toner. Go outdoors and use a can of compressed 
air to blow off the toner. Then use cold water to clean your hands and clothes. It’s a good idea to wear a smock or apron 
when working on printers.
Figure 19-23 shows an ink cartridge being installed in an inkjet printer. To replace a cartridge, turn on 
the printer and open the front cover. The printer releases the cartridges. You can then open the latch on top 
of the cartridge and remove it. Install the new cartridge as shown in the figure.
Clean a Printer
A printer gets dirty inside and outside 
as stray toner, ink, dust, and bits of 
paper accumulate. As part of routine 
printer maintenance, you need to 
regularly clean the printer. How often depends 
on how much the printer is used and the work 
environment. Some manufacturers suggest a heavily 
used printer be cleaned weekly, and others suggest 
you clean it whenever you exchange the toner, ink 
cartridges, or ribbon.
Clean the outside of the printer with a damp 
cloth. Don’t use ammonia-based cleaners. Clean the 
inside of the printer with a dry cloth and remove 
dust, bits of paper, and stray toner. Picking up stray 
toner can be a problem. Don’t try to blow it out 
with compressed air because you don’t want the 
toner in the air. Also, don’t use an antistatic vacuum 
cleaner. You can, however, use a vacuum cleaner 
designed to pick up toner, called a toner vacuum. This type of vacuum does not allow the toner that it picks 
up to touch any conductive surface.
Some printer manufacturers also suggest you use an extension magnet brush. The long-handled brush 
is made of nylon fibers that are charged with static electricity and easily attract the toner like a magnet. 
For a laser printer, wipe the rollers from side to side with a dry cloth to remove loose dirt and toner. Don’t 
touch the soft black roller (the transfer roller), or you might affect the print quality. You can find specific 
instructions for cleaning a printer on the printer manufacturer’s website.

4. Hold the cartridge up to the light and make sure that no dust, dirt, ink, or cotton fibers are left around 
the face of the nozzle plate. Make sure the area is clean.
5. Clean all the ink cartridges the same way and replace the cartridges in the printer.
6. Print a test page. If print quality is still poor, try calibrating the printer again.
7. If you still have problems, you need to replace the ink cartridges.
Laser printers automatically calibrate themselves periodically. You can instruct a laser printer to calibrate 
at any time by using the controls on the front of the printer or the browser-based utility program that is 
included in the firmware of a network printer. To access the utility, enter the IP address of the printer in the 
browser address box.
Calibrate a Printer
An inkjet printer might require calibration to align and/or clean the inkjet nozzles, which can 
solve a problem when colors appear streaked or out of alignment. To calibrate the printer, 
you might use the menu on the control panel of the printer or use software that came bundled 
with the printer. How to access these tools differs from one printer to another. See the printer 
manual to learn how to perform the calibration. For some printers, a Services tab is added to the printer 
Properties window. Other printer installations might put utility programs in the Start menu. The first time 
you turn on a printer after installing ink cartridges, it’s a good idea to calibrate the printer.
If an inkjet printer still does not print after calibrating it, you can try to manually clean the cartridge 
nozzles. Check the printer manufacturer’s website for directions. For most inkjet printers, you are directed 
to use clean, distilled water and cotton swabs to clean the face of the ink cartridge, being careful not to 
touch the nozzle plate. To prevent the inkjet nozzles from drying out, don’t leave the ink cartridges out of 
their cradle for longer than 30 minutes. Here are some general directions:
1. Following the manufacturer’s directions, remove the inkjet cartridges from the printer and lay them on 
their sides on a paper towel.
2. Dip a cotton swab in distilled water (not tap water) and squeeze out any excess water.
3. Hold an ink cartridge so that the nozzle plate faces up and use the swab to wipe clean the area around 
the nozzle plate, as shown in Figure 19-24. Do not clean the plate itself.

Supporting Printers and Customizing a System
After you have performed the maintenance, be sure to reset the page count so it will be accurate to tell 
you when you need to do the next routine maintenance. Keep a written record of the maintenance and 
other service done.
Printer Maintenance Kits
Manufacturers of high-end printers provide printer maintenance kits, which include specific 
printer components, step-by-step instructions for performing maintenance, how often 
maintenance should be done, and any special tools or equipment you need to do maintenance. 
For example, the maintenance plan for the HP Color LaserJet 4600 printer says to replace the 
transfer roller assembly after printing 120,000 pages and replace the fusing assembly after 150,000 pages. 
The plan also says the black ink cartridge should last for about 9,000 pages and the color ink cartridge 
for about 8,000 pages. HP sells the image transfer kit, the image fuser kit, and the ink cartridges designed 
for this printer.
To find out how many pages a printer 
has printed so that you know if you need to 
do the maintenance, you need to have the 
printer give you the page count since the 
last maintenance. You can tell the printer 
to display the information or print a status 
report by using buttons on the front of the 
printer (see Figure 19-25) or you can use 
utility software from a computer connected 
to the printer. See the printer documentation 
to know how to get this report. For network 
printers that offer a browser-based utility, 
enter the IP address of the printer in your 
browser and use the utility to find the 
counters (Figure 19-26 shows such a utility 
for a Canon network printer).

4. Unpack the new fuser and place it in the printer. Push the two blue levers toward the back of the printer 
to lock the fuser in place.
Whenever you service the inside of this printer, as a last step always carefully clean the LED erase lamps 
on the inside of the top cover (see Figure 19-35). The printer maintenance kits you’ve just learned to use all 
include a wipe to clean these strips.
Upgrade the Printer Memory or Hard Drive
Some printers have internal hard drives to hold print jobs and fonts, and printers might also 
give you the option to install additional memory in the printer. Extra memory can speed up 
performance, reduce print errors, and prevent Out of Memory or Low Memory errors. Check 
the user guide to determine how much memory the printer can support and what kind of 
memory to buy or what kind of internal hard drive the printer might support.
As you work with printer hardware, be sure you turn off the printer and disconnect it from the power 
source. Also, use an antistatic ground bracelet to protect memory modules from static electricity. Most 
likely, you will use a screwdriver to remove a cover plate on the printer to expose a cavity where memory 
or a drive can be installed. To access memory on one printer, you remove thumbscrews on the back of 
the printer and then pull out the formatter board shown in Figure 19-36. Memory modules are installed 
on this board (see Figure 19-37). You can also install a hard drive in one of the two empty bays on the

As with all computer problems, begin troubleshooting by interviewing the user, finding out what works 
and doesn’t work, and making an initial determination of the problem. When you think the problem is 
solved, ask the user to check things out to make sure he is satisfied with your work. And, after the problem 
is solved, be sure to document the symptoms of the problem and what you did to solve it.
Printer Does Not Print
When a printer does not print, the problem can be caused by the printer, the computer hard-

Supporting Printers and Customizing a System
In addition, if this is the first time you have tried to print after installing the printer, the printer drivers or 
the printer installation might be the problem. The following sections address printer problems caused by all 
of these categories, starting with hardware.
Problems with the Printer Itself
To eliminate the printer as the problem, first check that the printer is on, and then print a printer self-test 
page by using controls at the printer. For directions to print a self-test page, see the printer’s user guide. 
For example, you might need to hold down a button or buttons on the printer’s front panel. If this test 
page prints correctly, then the printer is working.
A printer self-test page generally prints some text, some graphics, and some information about the 
printer, such as the printer resolution and how much memory is installed. Verify that the information on 
the test page is correct. For example, if you know that the printer should have 2 MB of onboard printer 
memory, but the test only reports 1 MB, then there is a problem with memory. If the information reported 
is not correct and the printer allows you to upgrade firmware on the printer, try doing that next.
If the self-test page does not print or prints incorrectly (for example, it has missing dots or smudged 
streaks through the page), then troubleshoot the printer until it prints correctly. When the printer self-test 
page does not print, check the following:
	 Does the printer have paper? Is the paper installed correctly? Are the printer cover and rear access doors 
properly closed and locked? Is there a paper jam?
	 If paper is jammed inside the printer, follow the directions in the printer documentation to remove the 
paper. Don’t jerk the paper from the printer mechanism, but pull evenly on the paper, with care. You 
don’t want to leave pieces of paper behind. Check for jammed paper from both the input tray and the 
output bin. Check both sides. An inkjet printer is likely to have a door in the back that you can open 
to gently remove the jammed paper, as shown in Figure 19-40.
Figure 19-40  Open the door on the back of an inkjet printer to remove 
jammed paper
	 Is the paper not feeding? Remove the 
paper tray and check the metal plate 
at the bottom of the tray. Can it move 
up and down freely? If not, replace 
the tray. When you insert the tray in 
the printer, does the printer lift the 
plate as the tray is inserted? If not, the 
lift mechanism might need repair.
	 Damp paper can cause paper jams or 
the printer to refuse to feed the paper 
or to wrinkle or crease the paper. Be 
sure to only use dry paper in a printer. 
Paper that is too thin can also crease 
or wrinkle in the printer.
	 Look for an error message or error 
code in the control panel on the front 
of the printer. You might need to 
search the printer documentation or 
website to find out the meaning of a 
code. For example, error codes in the 
79.xx range for HP printers can indicate a variety of problems from a print job with characters it does 
not understand to a failed memory module in the printer.
	 For some error codes, the problem might be with a print job the printer cannot process. Cancel all print 
jobs and disconnect the printer from the network. If the control panel reports “Ready” or “Online,” then 
you can assume the problem is with the network, computers, or print jobs, and not with the printer.

Troubleshooting Printers

If the error code is still displayed, the problem is with the printer. Follow the directions on the printer 
manufacturer’s website to address the error code.
	 Try resetting the printer (for some printers, press the Reset button on the printer). Try powering down 
or unplugging the printer and starting it again. Check that power is getting to the printer. Try another 
power source.
	 For an inkjet printer, check if nozzles are clogged. Sometimes, leaving the printer on for a while will heat 
up the ink nozzles and unclog them.
	 For an impact printer, if the print head moves back and forth but nothing prints, check the ribbon. Is it 
installed correctly between the plate and print head? Is it jammed? If the ribbon is dried out, it needs to 
be replaced.
	 Check the service documentation and printer page count to find out if routine maintenance is due or if 
the printer has a history of similar problems. Check the user guide for the printer and the printer manu-
facturer’s website for other troubleshooting suggestions.
If you still cannot get a printer to work, you might need to take the printer to a certified repair shop. 
Before you do, though, try contacting the manufacturer. You might also be able to open a chat session on 
the printer manufacturer’s website.
Now back to Jill and her company’s network printer problem. 
Generally, Jill should focus on finding out what works and what 
doesn’t work, always remembering to check the simple things first. Jill should first go to the printer 
and check that the printer is online and has no error messages, such as a Paper Out message. Then, 
Jill should ask, “Can anyone print to this printer?” To find out, she should go to the closest computer 
and try to print a Windows test page. If the test page prints, she should next go to one of the three 
computers that do not print and begin troubleshooting that computer’s connection to the network. If the test page 
did not print at the closest computer, the problem is still not necessarily the printer. To eliminate the printer as 
the problem, the next step is to print a self-test page at the printer. If that self-test page prints, then Jill should 
check other computers on the network. Is the entire network down? Can one computer see another computer on the 
network? Perhaps part of the network is down (maybe because of a switch serving one part of the network).

Problems with Connectivity for a Network Printer or Shared Printer
If the self-test page prints but the Windows test page does not print and the printer is a network printer 
or shared printer, the problem might be with connectivity between the computer and the network printer or 
with the host computer that is sharing the printer.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know how to determine if connectivity between the printer 
and the computer is the problem when troubleshooting printer issues.
Follow these steps to solve problems with network printers:
	 Is the printer online?
	 Turn the printer off and back on. Try rebooting the computer.
	 Verify that the correct default printer is selected.
	 Consider the IP address of the printer might have changed, which can happen if the printer is receiving 
a dynamic IP address. Using Windows, delete the printer, and then install the printer again. If this solves 
the problem, assign a static IP address to the printer to keep the problem from reoccurring.
	 Can you print to another network printer? If so, there might be a problem with the printer. Look at the 
printer’s configuration.
	 Try pinging the printer. To do that, open a command prompt window and enter ping 192.168.1.100 
(substitute the IP address of your printer). If the printer replies (see Figure 19-41), the problem is not 
network connectivity.

Supporting Printers and Customizing a System
	 If pinging doesn’t work, try using another network cable for the printer. Check status indicator lights on 
the printer network port and on the switch or router to which the printer connects.
	 Use the printer’s browser-based utility and check for status reports and error messages. Run diagnostic 
software that might be available on the utility menu.
	 Try flashing the network printer’s firmware.
Even though you are using a network printer, the printer might have been installed as a printer that 
has been shared on the network. Let’s look at an example of this situation. Figure 19-42 shows a Devices 
and Printers window with several installed printers. Notice the two installations of the Canon D1100 
Series UFRII LT printer. The first installation was done installing the Canon D1100 as a network printer 
addressed by its IP address. The second installation was done by using a shared printer that was shared 
by another computer on the network named WHITELAPTOP. When you print using the first installation 
of the Canon D1100, you print directly over the network to the printer. But when you print to the second 
installation of the Canon D1100, you print by way of the WHITELAPTOP computer. If this computer is 
offline, the print jobs back up in the print queue until the computer is available.

Troubleshooting Printers

When a computer has shared a local or network printer with others on the network, follow these steps 
to solve problems with these shared printers:
	 Check that you can print a test page from the computer that has the printer attached to it locally or is 
sharing a network printer. If you cannot print from the host computer, solve the problem there before 
attempting to print from other computers on the network.
	 Is enough hard drive space available on the client or host computer?
	 Did you get an “Access denied” message when you tried to print from the remote computer? If so, you 
might not have access to the host computer. On the remote computer, go to File Explorer or Windows 
Explorer and attempt to drill down into resources on the printer’s computer. Perhaps you have not entered 
a correct user account and password to access this computer; if so, you will be unable to use the computer’s 
resources. Make sure you have a matching Windows user account and password on each computer.
	 On the host computer, open the printer’s Properties box and click the Security tab. Select Everyone and 
make sure Permissions for Everyone includes permission to print (refer back to Figure 19-17).
	 Using Windows on the remote computer, delete the printer, and then install the printer again. Watch 
for and address any error messages that might appear.
Problems Printing from Windows
If a self-test page works and you have already stepped through checking the printer connectivity, but you 
still cannot print a test page from Windows, try the following:
	 The print spool might be stalled. Try deleting all print jobs in the printer’s queue. In the Devices and 
Printers window, double-click the printer and click document(s) in queue. To cancel one document, 
right-click it and click Cancel in the shortcut menu (see Figure 19-43). To cancel all documents, click 
Printer and click Cancel All Documents. If the printer is still hung, try using buttons on the front of the 
printer to cancel print jobs. You can also power cycle the printer (turn it off and back on). Some 
printers have a Reset button for this purpose.

	 Verify that the correct printer is used.
	 Verify that the printer is online. See the printer documentation for information on how to determine the 
status from the control panel of the printer. For many printers, “Ready” appears in this control panel.
	 Verify that the printer cable or cable connections are solid.
	 Stop and restart the Windows Print Spooler service. Windows uses the Services console to stop, start, 
and manage background services used by Windows and applications. Do the following:
1.	To stop the service, enter services.msc in the Windows 8 Run box or the Windows 7 Search box. 
In the Services console, select Print Spooler (see Figure 19-44). Click Stop to stop the service.
Figure 19-44  Use the Services console to stop and start the print spooler
2.	To delete any print jobs left in the queue, open File Explorer or Windows Explorer and delete all files 
in the C:\Windows\System32\spool\PRINTERS folder.
3.	Start the print spooler back up. To start up the print spooler, return to the Services console. With 
Print Spooler selected, click Start. Close the Services console window.
	 If you still cannot print, reboot the computer. Try deleting the printer and then reinstalling it.
	 Check the printer manufacturer’s website for an updated printer driver. Download and install the 
correct driver.
	 Try disabling printer spooling, which you learned to do earlier in the chapter, so that print jobs are not 
cached, but are sent directly to the printer.
	 If you have trouble printing from an application, try to print to a file. For example, you can print to an 
XPS document by selecting Microsoft XPS Document Writer in the list of installed printers. Then you can 
double-click the .xps file, which opens in the XPS Viewer window, and you can print from this window.
	 Verify that enough hard drive space is available for the OS to create temporary print files.
	 Boot Windows into Safe Mode and attempt to print. If this step works, there might be a conflict 
between the printer driver and another driver or application.

2.	 If the problem is still not solved, completely remove the printer drivers by using the printui command. The 
Printer User Interface command, printui, is used by administrators to manage printers and printer drivers on 
remote computers. You can also use it to delete drivers on the local computer. Follow these steps:
a.	 If the printer is listed in the Devices and Printers window, remove it. (Sometimes Windows automatically 
puts a printer there when it finds printer drivers are installed.)
b.	 Before you can delete printer drivers, you must stop the print spooler service. Open the Services console 
and use it to stop the Print Spooler (refer to Figure 19-44). To delete any print jobs left in the queue, open 
Explorer and delete all files in the C:\Windows\System32\spool\PRINTERS folder.
c.	 You can now start the print spooler back up. Because the printer is no longer listed in the Devices and 
Printers window, starting the spooler will not tie up these drivers.
d.	 Open an elevated command prompt window, which is a window used to enter commands that have 
administrator privileges. To open the window, in Windows 8, press Win+X and click Command Prompt 
(Admin). In Windows 7, click Start, All Programs, Accessories. Right-click Command Prompt and click 
Run as administrator. Respond to the UAC box.
e.	 At the command prompt (see the left side of Figure 19-45), enter the command: printui /s /t2
	
(In the command line, the /s causes the Print Server Properties box to open and the /t2 causes the Drivers 
tab to be the selected tab.)
f.	 The Print Server Properties box opens, as shown in the middle of Figure 19-45. Select the printer and click 
Remove. In the Remove Driver And Package box (see the right side of Figure 19-45), select Remove driver 
only and click OK. It is not necessary to remove the driver package. (This driver package, also called the driver 
store, can be installed on this computer or a remote computer and holds a backup of the printer drivers.)
g.	 When a warning box appears, click Yes. Close all windows.
3.	 Try to install the printer again. Start the installation from the CD that came bundled with the printer or by 
using the printer setup program downloaded from the printer manufacturer’s website.

Poor Print Quality
Poor print quality can be caused by the printer drivers, the application, Windows, or the printer. 
Let’s start by looking at what can cause poor print quality with laser printers and then move on 
to other problems that affect printouts.
A+ 
220-901 
1.15, 4.6
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know how to resolve problems with streaks, faded prints, 
ghost images, garbled characters on a page, vertical lines, low memory errors, and wrong print colors. All these problems 
are covered in this part of the chapter.
Poor Print Quality for Laser Printers
For laser printers, poor print quality, including faded, smeared, wavy, speckled, or streaked printouts, often 
indicates that the toner is low. All major mechanical printer components that normally create problems are 
conveniently contained within the replaceable toner cartridge. In most cases, the solution to poor-quality 
printing is to replace this cartridge.
Follow these general guidelines to fix poor print quality with laser printers:
	 If you suspect the printer is overheated, unplug it and allow it to cool for 30 minutes.
	 The toner cartridge might be low on toner or might not be installed correctly. Remove the toner cartridge 
and gently rock it from side to side to redistribute the toner. Replace the cartridge. To avoid flying toner, 
don’t shake the cartridge too hard.
	 If this doesn’t solve the problem, try replacing the toner cartridge immediately.
	 Econo Mode (a mode that uses less toner) might be on; turn it off.
	 The paper quality might not be high enough. Try a different brand of paper. Only use paper recom-
mended for use with a laser printer. Also, some types of paper can receive print only on one side.
	 The printer might need cleaning. Clean the inside of the printer with a dry, lint-free cloth. Don’t touch 
the transfer roller, which is the soft, spongy black roller.
	 If the transfer roller is dirty, the problem will probably correct itself after several sheets print. If not, take 
the printer to an authorized service center.
	 Does the printer require routine maintenance? Check the website of the printer’s manufacturer for how 
often to perform the maintenance and to purchase the required printer maintenance kit.
Notes Extreme humidity can cause the toner to clump in the cartridge and give a Toner Low message. If this is a 
consistent problem in your location, you might want to invest in a dehumidifier for the room where your printer is located.
	 Streaking is usually caused by a dirty developer unit or corona wire. The developer unit is contained in 
the toner cartridge. Replace the cartridge or check the printer documentation for directions on how to 
remove and clean the developer unit. Allow the corona wire to cool and clean it with a lint-free swab.
	 Speckled printouts can be caused by the laser drum. If cleaning the printer and replacing the toner 
cartridge don’t solve the problem, replace the laser drum.
Notes If loose toner comes out with your printout, the fuser is not reaching the proper temperature and toner is not 
being fused to the paper. Professional service is required.
	 Distorted images can be caused by foreign material inside the printer that might be interfering with the 
mechanical components. Check for debris that might be interfering with the printer operation.
	 If the page has a gray background or gray print, the image drum is worn out and needs to be replaced.

	 A ghosted image appears a few inches below the actual darker image on the page. Ghosted images are 
usually caused by a problem with the image drum or toner cartridge. The drum is not fully cleaned in the 
cleaning stage, and toner left on it causes the ghost image. If the printer utility installed with the printer 
offers the option to clean the drum, try that first. The next solution is to replace the less expensive toner 
cartridge. If the problem is still not solved, replace the image drum.
Poor Print Quality for Inkjet Printers
To troubleshoot poor print quality for an inkjet printer, check the following:
1. Is the correct paper for inkjet printers being used? The quality of paper determines the final print quality, 
especially with inkjet printers. In general, the better the quality of the paper used with an inkjet printer, 
the better the print quality. Don’t use less than 20-pound paper in any type of printer, unless the printer 
documentation specifically says that a lower weight is satisfactory.
2. Is the ink supply low, or is there a partially clogged nozzle?
3. Remove and reinstall the cartridge(s).
4. Follow the printer’s documentation to clean each nozzle. Is the print head too close to or too far 
from the paper?
5. There is a little sponge in some printers near the carriage rest that can become clogged with ink. 
It should be removed and cleaned.
6. If you are printing transparencies, try changing the fill pattern in your application.
7. Missing lines or dots on the printed page can be caused by the ink nozzles drying out, especially when 
the printer sits unused for a long time. Follow the directions given earlier in the chapter for cleaning 
inkjet nozzles.
8. Streaks or lines down the page can be caused by dust or dirt in the print head assemblage. Follow the 
manufacturer’s directions to clean the inkjet nozzles.
Garbled Characters on Paper
If scrambled or garbled characters print on all or part of a page, the problem can be caused by the document 
being printed, the application, connectivity between the computer and the printer, or the printer. Follow these 
steps to zero in on the problem:
1. First, cancel all print jobs in the print queue. Then try printing a different document from the same 
application. If the second document prints correctly, the problem is with the original document.
2. Try printing using a different application. If the problem is resolved, try repairing or reinstalling 
the application.
3. For a USB printer, the problem might be with a USB hub, port, or cable. Is the USB cable securely 
connected at both ends? If you are using a USB hub, remove the hub, connecting the printer directly 
to the computer. Try a different USB cable or USB port.
4. Recycle the printer by powering it down and back up or pressing a Reset button.
5. Update the printer drivers. To do that, go to the website of the printer manufacturer to find the latest 
drivers and follow their directions to install the drivers.
6. If the problem is still not solved, the printer might need servicing. Does the printer need maintenance? 
Search the website of the printer manufacturer for other solutions.
Low Memory Errors
For some printers, an error occurs if the printer does not have enough memory to hold the entire page. For 
other printers, only a part of the page prints. Some might signal this problem by flashing a light or displaying

an error message on their display panels, such as “20 Mem Overflow,” “Out of memory,” or “Low Memory.” 
The solution is to install more memory or to print only simple pages with few graphics. Print a self-test page 
to verify how much memory is installed. Some printers give you the option to install a hard drive in the 
printer to give additional printer storage space.
Wrong Print Colors
For a printer that is printing the wrong colors, do the following:
1. Some paper is designed to print on only one side. You might need to flip the paper in the printer.
2. Try adjusting the quality of print. How to do so varies by printer. For one color laser printer, open the 
Printing Preferences box and click the Quality tab (see the left side of Figure 19-46). You can try different 
selections on this box. To manually adjust the color, check Manual Color Settings and then click Color 
Settings. The box on the right side of Figure 19-46 appears.

3. For an inkjet printer, try cleaning the ink cartridges and calibrating the printer. One step in doing that 
prints a self-test page. If the self-test page shows missing or wrong colors, the problem is with the ink 
cartridges. Try cleaning the ink nozzles. If that doesn’t work, replace the ink cartridges.
4. For a laser printer, try calibrating the printer.
Now we wrap up the chapter with a discussion of customizing computer systems.
Customizing Computer Systems
Many computer vendors and manufacturers offer to build customized systems to meet 
specific needs of their customers. As a technical retail associate, you need to know how to 
recommend to a customer which computer components are needed for his or her specific 
needs. You also might be called on to select and purchase components for a customized 
system and perhaps even build this system from parts. In this part of the chapter, we focus on several 
types of customized systems you might be expected to know how to configure and what parts to consider 
when configuring these systems.

Customizing Computer Systems

Here are important principles to keep in mind when customizing a system to meet customer needs:
	 Meet applications requirements. Consider the applications the customer will use and make sure the hardware 
meets or exceeds the recommended requirements for these applications. Consider any special hardware the 
applications might require such as a joystick for gaming or a digital tablet for graphics applications.
	 Balance functionality and budget. When working with a customer’s budget, put the most money on 
the hardware components that are most needed for the primary intended purposes of the system. For 
example, if you are building a customized gaming PC, a RAID hard drive configuration is not nearly 
as important as the quality of the video subsystem.
	 Consider hardware compatibility. When selecting hardware, start with the motherboard and processor. 
Then select other components that are compatible with this motherboard.
Now let’s look at the components you need to consider when building these eight types of customized 
systems: graphics or CAD/CAM design workstation, audio and video editing workstation, virtualization 
workstation, gaming PC, home theater PC, home server PC, thick client, and thin client.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects you to know how to customize each of the eight types of computers 
covered in this part of the chapter.
Graphics or CAD/CAM Design Workstation
You might be called on to configure a graphics or CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/
computer-aided manufacturing) workstation. People who use these systems might be an 
engineer working with CAD software to design bridges, an architect who designs skyscrapers, 
a graphics designer who creates artistic pages for children’s books, or a landscape designer 
who creates lawn and garden plans. Examples of the applications these people might use include AutoCAD 
Design Suite by Autodesk (usa.autodesk.com) or Adobe Illustrator by Adobe Systems (www.adobe.com).
These graphics-intensive, advanced applications perform complex calculations, use large and complex files, 
and can benefit from the most powerful of workstations. Because rendering 3D graphics is a requirement, 
a high-end or ultra-high-end video card is needed. Figure 19-47 shows one ultra-high-end customized CAD 
workstation by CAD Computers (www.cadcomputers.com).

Supporting Printers and Customizing a System
Here is a breakdown of the requirements for these high-end workstations:
	 Use a motherboard that provides quad channels for memory and plenty of memory slots and install 
a generous amount of RAM. In the ad shown in Figure 19-47, the system has 64 GB of installed RAM. 
For best performance, you can install the maximum amount of RAM the board supports.
	 Use a powerful multicore processor with a large CPU cache. In the ad shown in Figure 19-47, the Intel 
Fourth Generation i7 processor, which is rated for high-end workstations and servers, has six cores and 
a 15-MB cache. This processor can handle the high demands of complex calculations performed by 
advanced software.
	 Use fast hard drives with plenty of capacity. Notice the system in Figure 19-47 has two hard drives. 
The solid-state drive holds the Windows installation. The moderately fast second hard drive has a 
capacity of 2 TB to accommodate large amounts of data. For best hard drive performance in any 
system, be sure the motherboard and hard drives are all using SATA III.
	 Use a high-end video card. To provide the best 3D graphics experience, use a high-end video card. Probably 
the best chipset manufacturer for high-end video cards is NVIDIA (www.nvidia.com). The ad in Figure 
19-47 mentions the Quadro 6000. The Quadro family of graphics processors has the best-performing GPUs 
on the market, and the Quadro 6000 is the best Quadro currently sold (see Figure 19-48). It uses a PCIe 
×16 slot and has 12 GB of GDDR5 video memory using a 384-bit video bus. The card has four HDMI 
ports and one DVI port. The card alone costs almost $4,000 and accounts for a major portion of the total 
system cost, which is almost $10,000.

Wouldn’t it be fun to build this system? However, not all graphics workstations need to be this powerful or 
this expensive. You can still get adequate performance in a system for less than half the cost if you drop the 
RAM down to 16 GB and use an NVIDIA Quadro 2000 GPU on the video card, along with a motherboard 
that supports dual-channel memory.

Audio and Video Editing Workstation
Examples of professional applications software used to edit music, audio, video, and movies 
include Camtasia by TechSmith (techsmith.com), Adobe Production Premium by Adobe Systems 
(adobe.com), Media Composer by Avid (avid.com), and Final Cut Pro by Apple Computers 
(apple.com). (Final Cut Pro is used only on Macs, which are popular computers in the  
video-editing industry.) Audio- and video-editing applications are not usually as power-hungry as CAD/
CAM and graphics applications. The major difference in requirements is that most audio and video editing 
does not require rendering 3D graphics; therefore, you can get by with a not-so-expensive graphics card and 
processor. Customers might require a Blu-ray drive and dual monitors. Recall that the best LCD monitors 
that provide the most accurate color are LED monitors with a class IPS rating. Figure 19-49 shows the 
specs for one customized video-editing workstation by ADK Media Group (adkvideoediting.com).

Source: www.adkvideoediting.com
Here is what you need for a mid range to high-end audio/video-editing workstation:
	 Use a motherboard that supports dual, triple, or quad channel memory running at least at 1600-MHz 
RAM speed.
	 Use a Core i7 or higher processor.
	 Install at least 16 GB of RAM; more is better.
	 Select a good video card that has a GeForce GTX graphics processor or better. GeForce is a family of 
graphics processors designed by NVIDIA that is not as high end as the Quadro graphics processors but 
still gives good video performance. Most users will require dual or triple monitors. You might need to 
consider dual video cards for optimum video performance or for more than two video ports.
	 Use a good sound card, such as the Creative Sound Blaster Zx sound card. This sound card uses a PCIe 
slot. Before you purchase, research reviews online for a good sound card.
	 Use a double-sided, dual-layer DVD burner and possibly a Blu-ray burner.
	 Install one or more fast and large hard drives, running at least 7200 RPM.

Virtualization Workstation
Virtualization is when one physical machine hosts multiple activities that are normally done on 
multiple machines. One way to implement virtualization is to use virtual machine management 
software, called a hypervisor, which creates and manages multiple virtual machines (VMs). 
Examples of hypervisors used on a desktop computer include VMware Workstation or Player, 
Windows Virtual PC by Microsoft, and Oracle VirtualBox. Each VM managed by a hypervisor has its 
own virtual hardware (virtual motherboard, processor, RAM, hard drive, and so forth) and can act like a 
physical computer. You can install an OS in each VM and then install applications in the VM. Figure 19-50 
shows a Windows 8.1 Professional desktop with two virtual machines running that were created by Oracle 
VirtualBox. One VM is running Windows 8.1 Pro, and the other VM is running Windows 7 Home Premium. 
In the “Installing Windows” chapter, you learned how to set up a VM and install Windows in it.

Figure 19-50  Two virtual machines running, each with its own virtual hardware and OS 
(Windows 8 and Windows 7) installed
Source: Oracle VirtualBox
Here are the requirements for a desktop computer that will be used to run multiple virtual machines:
	Each VM has its own virtual processor, so it’s important the processor is a multicore processor. All dual-core 
or higher processors and all motherboards sold today support hardware-assisted virtualization (HAV). This 
technology enhances the processor support for virtual machines and is enabled in UEFI/BIOS setup.
	Some virtual machine management programs are designed so that each VM that is running ties up 
all the RAM assigned to it. Therefore, you need extra amounts of RAM when a computer is running 
several VMs.
	Each VM must have an operating system installed, and it takes about 20 GB for a Windows 8/7/Vista 
installation. In addition, you need hard drive space for each application installed in each VM. Make 
sure you have adequate hard drive space for each VM.
When deciding how to use the overall budget for a virtualization workstation, maximize the number 
of CPU cores and the amount of installed RAM.
Gaming PC
Gaming computers benefit from a powerful multicore processor and a high-end video card and 
sound card. Gamers who are also computer hobbyists might want to overclock their CPUs or 
use dual video cards for extra video performance. Take extra care to make sure the cooling 
methods are adequate. Because of the heat generated by multiple video cards and overclocking, 
liquid cooling is sometimes preferred. Also recall that when using the LGA2011 socket, liquid cooling is a

Microsoft recommendation. Most gaming computers use onboard surround sound, or you can use a sound 
card to improve sound. A lighted case with a clear plastic side makes for a great look.
Figure 19-51 shows a group of gaming PCs built by iBUYPOWER (ibuypower.com). A couple of the PCs 
use liquid cooling, and all use a powerful processor with at least 8 GB of RAM. The video card uses a GeForce 
GTX or GT graphics processor or an AMD Radeon HD graphics processor. The Radeon line of graphics 
processors by AMD are comparable to the NVIDIA GeForce graphics processors.

Home Theater PC
A Home Theater PC (HTPC) is designed to play and possibly record music, photos, movies, 
and video on a television or extra-large monitor screen. Because these large screens are usually 
viewed from across the room, application software is used to control output display menus 
and other clickable items in fonts large enough to read at a distance of 10 feet. This interface 
is called a 10-foot user interface. An HTPC is also known as a media center appliance.
A custom-built HTPC needs to include these features:
	Application software. The application controls the user interface and plays and records music and video. 
Examples of HTPC software include Windows Media Center, which is a free upgrade for Windows 8 
Pro and integrated into Windows 7/Vista, Kodi (kodi.tv), and Plex (plex.tv).
	HDMI port to connect video output to television. And be sure to use a high-quality HDMI cable.
	Cable TV input. The best solution is to use a TV tuner card to connect the TV coax cable directly to 
the computer. Most TV tuner cards include a remote (see Figure 19-52). Some TV tuner cards are also

video capture cards that offer the 
ability to record video and audio 
input. If the customer plans to use 
a TV cable box between the TV 
coax cable and the HTPC, you 
need to provide a way to make the 
connection. Most TV cable boxes 
have an HDMI output port. 
Realize this won’t work with the 
HDMI port on a motherboard 
because these ports are output 
ports and you need an input port. 
To input to the computer using an 
HDMI port, you can use a video 
capture card that has an HDMI 
input port (see Figure 19-53).
	Satellite TV input. This setup 
requires a satellite set-top box 
supplied by the company providing 
the satellite TV service. The best 
solution is to use a TV tuner card to 
receive input from the satellite set-
top box. Make sure the types of 
ports on the computer and the box 
match up.
	Internet access. A way to receive 
streaming video from the Internet. 
To connect to the Internet, use a 
Gigabit Ethernet port or Wi-Fi 
connection.
	Remote control. A way to remotely 
control the HTPC because most 
likely the user will be sitting across 
the room from the computer. You 
can use a wireless keyboard and 
mouse, although the range for these 
devices might be too short. Some 
TV tuner cards include a remote. 
Also consider an app you can 
download to a smart phone to 
make it work as the remote.
	Low background noise. Because 
these computers don’t perform 
complex calculations, you don’t

need as much processor or RAM power as in other systems. For example, you can use the small Intel 
Atom processor with 4 GB of RAM. Therefore, you won’t need an extensive cooling system. You do, 
however, want a system that runs quietly. You can reduce noise by using SSD hard drives and low-speed 
fans or no fans at all.

Home Server PC
A home server PC is useful when you have several computers on a small home network and 
want to share files among them. You can use the computer to serve up these files and to stream 
video files and movies to client computers. One popular type of home server PC is Slingbox 
by Sling Media (slingbox.com). The device can serve up streaming media that you have stored 
on it not only to other computers in your home but also to a client computer anywhere on the Internet.
Here are the features and hardware you need to consider when customizing a home server computer:
	Use a processor with moderate power. The Intel Core i5 or Core i3 works well. A moderate amount 
of RAM is sufficient, for example, 6 to 8 GB.
	Storage speed and capacity need to be maximized. Use hardware RAID implemented on the motherboard 
to provide fault tolerance and high performance. Make sure the motherboard supports hardware RAID. 
Use fast hard drives (at least 7200 RPM) with plenty of storage capacity. Make sure the case has plenty 
of room for all the hard drives a customer might require.
A+  
220-901

	Surround sound. The system should 
support surround sound using at least 
six speakers located around the room. In 
Figure 19-54, you can see the preferred 
location for six speakers. Three popular 
variations of surround sound are 5.1 
(uses up to six channels and speakers), 
7.1 (uses up to eight channels and 
speakers), and 9.1 (uses up to 10 
channels and speakers). Most sound 
cards and motherboards support six 
channels or ports for sound.
	Case form factor. An HTPC should 
be small enough to fit on a shelf in 
an entertainment center, and several 
companies make HTPC cases 
specifically for this purpose. The 
HTPC case shown in Figure 19-55 
accommodates a MicroATX, mini-ITX, 
or mini-DTX motherboard and power 
supply. (A mini-DTX motherboard is 
slightly wider than the mini-ITX board.) 
The case has drive bays for 3.5-inch 
and 2.5-inch drives.
Alternatives to the HTPC are to use 
a smart TV or a set-top box. A smart 
TV is a television that has the ability to 
run apps, store data, and connect to the 
Internet. A set-top box offers a regular 
television the ability to be “smart.”

	Network transfers need to be fast, especially for streaming videos and movies. Make sure the network 
port is rated for Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbps). All other devices and computers on the LAN should 
also use Gigabit Ethernet.
	Printer sharing needs to be an available resource. A USB printer can be connected directly to the computer 
and then you can use Windows to share the printer with others on the network. How to share printers 
is covered later in the text. Alternately, some routers and switches provide a USB port that can be used to 
connect a USB printer to other computers on the network.
	Onboard video works well. Recall that onboard video is a video port embedded on the motherboard 
and does not perform as well as a good video card. Because the computer is not likely to be used as a 
workstation, you don’t need powerful video.
	Windows 7 can be used as the OS, but Windows 8 provides additional features. Windows 8 offers Storage 
Spaces, which can hold large multimedia files on multiple hard drives. In addition, if the customer plans to 
use the computer to back up files on client computers, know that Windows 8 File History is easier to 
implement and use than the Windows 7 Backup and Restore utility.
Thick Client and Thin Client
Recall that a desktop computer can use virtual machine management software (called a hypervisor) 
to provide one or more VMs, and in this situation the computer is called a virtualization 
workstation. In a corporate environment, the VM can also be provided by a virtualization server, 
which serves up a virtual machine to a client computer. The virtualization server provides a virtual 
desktop for users on multiple client machines. Most, if not all, processing is done on the server, which provides 
to the client the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). See Figure 19-56.

little more than an interface to the network with a keyboard, monitor, and mouse.) Here are the details 
for a thick client and thin client computer:
	A thick client, also called a fat client, is a regular desktop computer or laptop that is sometimes used as 
a client by a virtualization server. It can be a low-end or high-end desktop or laptop. It should meet the 
recommended requirements to run Windows 8/7 and any applications the user might require when it is 
being used as a stand-alone computer rather than a VM client.
	A thin client is a computer that has an operating system but has little computer power and might only 
need to support a browser used to communicate with the server. The server does most of the processing 
for the thin client. To reduce the cost of the computer, configure it to meet only the minimum 
requirements for Windows.

Printer Types and Features
	The two most popular types of printers are laser and inkjet. Other types of printers are thermal printers 
and impact printers (dot matrix). Laser printers produce the highest quality, followed by inkjet printers. 
Dot matrix printers have the advantage of being able to print multicopy documents.
	The seven steps that a laser printer performs to print are processing, charging, exposing, developing, 
transferring, fusing, and cleaning. The charging, exposing, developing, and cleaning steps take place 
inside removable cartridges, which makes the printer easier to maintain.
	Inkjet printers print by shooting ionized ink at a sheet of paper. The quality of the printout largely 
depends on the quality of paper used with the printer.
	Dot matrix printers are a type of impact printer. They print by projecting pins from the print head 
against an inked ribbon that deposits ink on the paper.
	Direct thermal printers use heat to burn dots into special paper, and thermal transfer printers melt the 
ribbon or foil during printing.

Supporting Printers and Customizing a System
Using Windows to Install, Share, and Manage Printers
	A printer is installed as a local printer connected directly to a computer or a network printer that works 
as a device on the network. Local printers can connect to a computer via a USB, serial, Bluetooth, or 
Wi-Fi connection. Network printers can connect to the network via an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. 
USB printers are installed automatically in Windows.
	Windows installs, manages, and removes a printer using the Devices and Printers windows. You can also 
install a printer using a setup program provided by the printer manufacturer. Always print a test page 
after installing a printer.
	A print server can be a computer on the network, a hardware device, or firmware embedded in a 
network printer.
	A printer can be shared in Windows so that others on the network can use it. To use a shared printer, 
the printer drivers must be installed on the remote computer.
	Network printers are identified on the network by their IP address.
	The Windows print queue is managed from the Devices and Printers window.
	Virtual printing prints to a file, and cloud printing prints to a printer via the Internet.
	Printer features, such as duplexing, collating, or page orientation, are managed in a printer 
properties box.
Printer Maintenance and Upgrades
	An inkjet or laser printer can be calibrated to align the color on the page. The nozzles of an inkjet 
printer tend to clog or dry out, especially when the printer remains unused. The nozzles can be cleaned 
automatically by means of printer software or buttons on the front panel of the printer.
	Check the page count of the printer to know when service is due and you need to order a printer 
maintenance kit. The page count can be reported on the printer panel or through a web-based utility 
in the printer firmware.
	Memory and a hard drive can be added to a printer to improve performance and prevent errors.
Troubleshooting Printers
	When troubleshooting printers, first isolate the problem. Narrow the source to the printer, connectivity 
between the computer and its local printer, the network, Windows, printer drivers, the application using 
the printer, or the printer installation. Test pages printed directly at the printer or within Windows can 
help narrow down the source of the problem.
	Poor print quality can be caused by the printer drivers, the application, Windows, or the printer. For a 
laser printer, consider that low toner can be the problem. For an inkjet printer, consider that the ink 
cartridges need cleaning or replacing. The quality of paper can also be a problem.
	A printer needs memory to render a print job. Low memory can cause part of the page not to print or a 
printer error.
Customizing Computer Systems
	As a technician, you might be called on to customize a system for a customer, including a graphics or 
CAD/CAM workstation, audio- and video-editing workstation, virtualization workstation, gaming PC, 
Home Theater PC (HTPC), home server PC, thick client, or thin client.
	A high-end video card is a requirement in a graphics, CAD/CAM, video-editing workstation, or a gaming 
PC. These systems also need powerful processors and ample RAM.

Virtualization, Linux, and Mac OS X 
Virtualization Basics
Virtualization is when one physical machine hosts multiple activities that are normally done 
on multiple machines. Two general types of virtualization are server-side virtualization and 
client-side virtualization. The basic difference between the two is where the virtualizing takes 
place. Let’s see how each can be implemented.
A+  
220-902 
2.2
Server-Side Virtualization
Server-side virtualization provides a virtual desktop for users on multiple client machines. 
Most, if not all, processing is done on the server, which provides to the client the Virtual 
Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). See Figure 20-1.

With server-side virtualization, three categories of clients might be used, based on the computing power 
of the client:
	 Thick client or fat client. The client computer can be a regular desktop computer or laptop. In this case, 
the client is called a thick client or fat client. The main advantage of using thick clients is the personal 
computer can be used for other purposes than server-side virtualization.
	 Thin client. Because the client does little or no processing with server-side virtualization, a thin client 
can be used. A thin client is a computer that has an operating system, but has little computing power 
and might only need to support a browser used to communicate with the server. The main advantage 
of using thin clients is the reduced cost of the client machine. A decent tablet can serve as a thin client.
	 Zero client. To even further reduce the cost of the client machine, a zero client, also called a dumb 
terminal or ultra-thin client, can be used. A zero client, such as a Wyse Zero Client, does not have an 
operating system and merely provides an interface between the user and the server. A zero client might 
contain little more than a keyboard, mouse, monitor, and network connection.

Virtualization Basics

Client-Side Virtualization
Using client-side virtualization, a personal computer provides multiple virtual environments 
for applications. Client-side virtualization can be implemented using several methods, 
including these three, which are presented from the least amount of computing done on 
the client machine to the most computing done on the client machine:
	 Presentation virtualization. Using presentation virtualization, a remote application running on a server 
is controlled by a local computer. Presentation virtualization is a form of SaaS cloud computing. The 
user remotely controls the application running on the server and the application data is also stored on 
the server (see Figure 20-2).

	 Application virtualization. Using application virtualization, an application can be made available to 
users without having to install the application on the user’s computer. For example, Application 
Virtualization (App-V) by Microsoft manages applications so they don’t install in Windows on the client 
computer. The App-V software is installed on the client computer. When a user selects an application 
from a list provided by App-V, App-V creates a virtual environment in memory for the application to 
install itself. The application doesn’t make changes to the Windows registry or install components on 
the hard drive; the entire installation happens in memory. An application managed by App-V can be 
permanently stored on the local hard drive or on an application server.
	 Client-side desktop virtualization. Using client-side desktop virtualization, software installed on a 
desktop or laptop manages virtual machines. Each VM has its own operating system installed. In the 
chapter, “Installing Windows,” you learned that Oracle VirtualBox and VMware Player are two 
examples of freeware that can be installed on a computer and used to manage virtual machines. 
This type of software is called a hypervisor or virtual machine manager (VMM).
Virtual Machines and Hypervisors
Let’s look at the different types of hypervisors, the hardware requirements needed for client-side 
virtualization, and how to secure a virtual machine.

Figure 20-3  Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors
Here is an explanation of the two types of hypervisors:
	 A Type 1 hypervisor installs on a computer before any operating system, and is, therefore, called a 
bare-metal hypervisor. After it installs, it partitions the hardware computing power into multiple 
VMs. An OS is installed in each VM. Examples of Type 1 hypervisors are XenServer by Citrix, ESXi 
by VMware, and Hyper-V by Microsoft. Most server-side desktop virtualization is done using a  
Type 1 hypervisor.
	
	 Some Type 1 hypervisors are designed for client-side desktop virtualization on personal computers. 
For example, XenClient by Citrix installs on a personal computer and then you can install Windows or 
other operating systems in the VMs provided by XenClient. One major advantage of a local computer 
running a Type 1 hypervisor is added security because each OS and its applications are isolated from 
the others. For example, employees can install one OS in a VM for business use and another OS in 
a VM for personal use. The VM used for business can be locked down for secured VPN connections, 
and the personal VM does not require so much security.
Notes To see some interesting videos of how XenClient by Citrix works and what it can do, go to citrix.com/xenclient.
	 A Type 2 hypervisor installs in a host operating system as an application. Client Hyper-V, VirtualBox, 
and VMware Player are examples of Type 2 hypervisors. A Type 2 hypervisor is not as powerful as a 
Type 1 hypervisor because it is dependent on the host OS to allot its computing power. A VM in a Type 
2 hypervisor is not as secure or as fast as a VM in a Type 1 hypervisor. Type 2 hypervisors are typically 
used on desktops and laptops when performance and security are not significant issues. Here are some 
ways that virtual machines provided by Type 2 hypervisors might be used:
	 Developers often use VMs to test applications. If you save a copy of a virtual hard drive (VHD) that 
has a fresh installation of Windows installed, you can easily build a new and fresh VM to test an 
application.
	 Help-desk technicians use VMs so they can easily switch from one OS to another when a user asks 
for help with a particular OS.
	 Honeypots are single computers or a network of computers that lure hackers to them so as to 
protect the real network. Virtual machines can be used to give the impression to a hacker that he 
has found a computer or entire network of computers. Administrators can monitor the honeypot 
for unauthorized activity.
	 Students use VMs to install and practice using and supporting different operating systems.

Virtualization Basics

	 Hard drive space. See the requirements provided by the hypervisor manufacturer for hard drive space 
for the hypervisor. Each VM has its own virtual hard drive (VHD), which is a file stored on the 
physical hard drive and acts like a hard drive complete with its own boot sectors and file systems. You 
can configure this VHD to be a fixed size or dynamically expanding. The fixed size takes up hard drive 
space whether the VM uses the space or not. An expanding VHD increases in capacity as the VM uses 
the space. Remember that about 20 GB is required for a Windows installation. Therefore, you’ll need 
at least 20 GB for each VM.
	 Processor and memory. Most processors sold today support hardware-assisted virtualization. Plan on 
using at least a dual-core processor or better. A system needs lots of RAM when running multiple virtual 
machines. Some hypervisors tie up all the memory you have configured for a VM from the time the VM 
is opened until the VM is closed. Other hypervisors support dynamic memory, which ties up only the 
memory the VM is actually using.
Hardware Requirements
When preparing to install a hypervisor and virtual machines, you need to be aware of the hardware 
requirements:
	 The motherboard UEFI/BIOS. The motherboard UEFI/BIOS and the processor should support hardware-
assisted virtualization (HAV). For Intel processors, this feature is called IntelVT. For AMD processors, the 
technology is called AMD-V. Most of today’s motherboards support the feature, and it must be enabled 
in UEFI/BIOS setup. Figure 20-4 shows the UEFI setup screen for one motherboard where the feature is 
called Intel® Virtualization Technology. When you enable the feature, also verify that all subcategories 
under the main category for hardware virtualization are enabled.

Virtualization, Linux, and Mac OS X 
When setting up a virtual machine, know that an emulator might be required. A hypervisor emulates 
hardware and presents this virtual hardware to each VM, which can include a virtual processor, memory, 
motherboard, hard drive, optical drive, keyboard, mouse, monitor, network adapter, SD card, USB device, 
smart phone, printer, and other components and peripherals. For example, recall from the chapter, 
“Supporting Mobile Operating Systems,” you used Visual Studio and Client Hyper-V to create a Windows 
Phone emulator (see Figure 20-5). The emulator not only includes the Windows Phone OS, but also 
emulates the hardware of a smart phone.
A hypervisor offers a way to configure each VM, including 
which virtual hardware is installed. For example, when you 
launch VirtualBox, the VirtualBox Manager window shown 
on the left side of Figure 20-6 appears. To configure a VM, 
select the VM in the left pane and click Settings. The Settings 
box appears. Click the Storage menu, shown on the right side 
of Figure 20-6, to install and uninstall virtual hard drives 
in the VM.
Notice in the Settings box in Figure 20-6 that this VM has 
three hard drives installed. JumpWin8.1 is connected to SATA 
port 0 and contains the Windows 8.1 installation. NewDisk1 and 
NewDisk2 are smaller and are connected through SATA ports 1 
and 2, respectively. The VM also has one optical drive with an 
.iso file mounted to it. Recall that an ISO file holds the image of 
a CD or DVD and can be used to hold Windows installation files. 
When you mount this file to the VM, you can install Windows in 
the VM from this virtual DVD, although many hypervisor pro-
grams will perform this step for you during setup of a new VM.
Click the System menu (see Figure 20-7) to configure 
motherboard settings, such as boot order and memory. Also 
consider network requirements for the VM. A VM can have one 
or more virtual network adapters. Click Network (see Figure 
20-8) to change adapter settings. A VM connects to a local 
network the same as other computers and can share and use 
shared resources on the network. On the right side of the 
Settings box, you can control the number and type of installed 
network adapters up to four adapters.

Secure a Virtual Machine
A virtual machine is susceptible to hackers and malware just as is a physical machine. When supporting a 
VM that holds sensitive data and has network and Internet connectivity or is located in a public area, keep 
these points in mind for securing the resources in the VM:
	 Secure the VM within the VM. Using Windows installed in the VM, follow all the security measures 
you have learned throughout this text. For example, be sure to configure Windows Firewall in the VM, 
keep Windows updates current, install and run anti-malware software, require passwords for all user 
accounts in the VM, and encrypt data folders.
	 VMs should be isolated for best security. One major advantage of using VMs on a desktop computer 
is that VMs running under a Type 1 hypervisor are isolated from each other. If one VM gets infected, 
the other VMs will not be affected.

Virtualization, Linux, and Mac OS X 
	 Secure permissions to the files that hold a VM. You can move a VM from one computer to another by 
moving the files that contain the VM. Be sure these files that hold the VM are secured with permissions 
that allow access only to specific local or network users.
	 Secure the host computer. Protect your VMs by applying security measures to protect the host computer 
that holds the VMs. For example, require password authentication to sign in to the host computer.

The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to be able to explain methods used to secure a virtual machine 
installed on a client computer.

In the “Installing Windows” chapter, you installed VirtualBox and used it to create a VM and install 
Windows 8. Install VirtualBox on a second computer and move the VM you created earlier to this 
second computer. What files did you have to move? How did you configure VirtualBox on the second 
computer to find and use the VM?

Next you’ll create a VM running a different operating system: Linux. But first, let’s learn a little about 
how Linux works.
Linux Operating System
UNIX is a popular OS used to control networks and to support server applications available 
on the Internet. A variation of UNIX is Linux (pronounced “Lih-nucks”), an OS created by 
Linus Torvalds when he was a student at the University of Helsinki in Finland. Basic versions 
of this OS are open source, and all the underlying programming instructions (called source 
code) are freely distributed. Linux can be used both as a server platform and a desktop platform, but its 
greatest popularity is in the server market. In addition, the Android operating system for mobile devices is 
based on Linux, and bootable CDs and flash drives that contain utility software often use Linux. Versions 
of Linux are called distributions or flavors; the more popular ones are listed in Table 20-1. Hardware 
requirements for Linux vary widely by distribution.

Linux Operating System
20
Linux is popular because it’s inexpensive, very stable (it seldom crashes), and is well suited to support 
various types of servers, such as a web server or email server. Linux itself is not a complete operating 
system, but is only the kernel for the OS. You also need a shell for user and application interfaces, and 
Linux shells vary widely by distributions. Many distributions of Linux include a GUI shell or desktop, 
which is called a windows manager. For example, Figure 20-9 shows the desktop or windows manager 
for Ubuntu Desktop.
Figure 20-9  Ubuntu Desktop with the Mozilla Firefox browser window open
Source: Canonical Ltd.
Some distributions of Linux don’t have a windows manager. For example, Ubuntu Server installs 
with only a command-line interface. In Linux, the terminal refers to the command-line interface for the 
OS and the default shell for the terminal is the Bash shell. The name stands for “Bourne Again Shell” 
and takes the best features from two previous shells, the Bourne and the Korn shells. In this chapter, 
we use Ubuntu Server and its default Bash shell. In Linux, a command prompt in the terminal is called 
a shell prompt.
Notes To find out what shell you’re using, at a Linux shell prompt, enter the echo $SHELL command.
As an IT support technician, you should know a little about Linux, including a few basic commands, 
which are covered in this chapter. You will learn about root and user accounts, file structure, some common 
commands, and how to use the vi text editor. As you work, be aware that the organization of files and 
directories and the way each command works might be slightly different with the distribution and version 
of Linux you are using.

Install Ubuntu Server in a VM
To practice Linux skills covered in this chapter, you need an installation of Ubuntu Server. Follow 
these steps to install Ubuntu Server in a VM on a Windows computer:
Hands-On  Project 20-2
A+  
220-902 
2.1
1.	 On a Windows computer that has a 64-bit version of Windows installed, go into UEFI/BIOS setup 
and verify that hardware-assisted virtualization is turned on.
Notes Ubuntu Server is only available as a 64-bit OS. To install a 64-bit guest OS in a VM, the host OS must 
also be 64-bit.
2.	 If you don’t already have a hypervisor installed, install one that you can use to manage VMs. For example, in 
64-bit Windows 8.1 Pro, you can use the Programs and Features window to enable Client Hyper-V, which comes 
embedded in the OS. Alternately, you can download and install one of these free hypervisors:
	 Oracle VirtualBox at virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
	 Windows Virtual PC at microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3702
	 VMware Workstation Player at my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_
workstation_player/12_0
3.	 Go to ubuntu.com/download/server and download the Ubuntu Server OS to your hard drive. The file that 
downloads is an .iso file.
4.	 Open the Hyper-V Manager, Oracle VM VirtualBox, Virtual PC Manager, or VMware Workstation Player manager 
and create a new VM named VM50. Mount the ISO file that contains the Ubuntu Server download to a virtual 
DVD in your VM.
Notes If you need help learning to use your hypervisor of choice, try searching for some tutorial videos at 
youtube.com or on the hypervisor manufacturer’s website.
5.	 Start up the VM and install Ubuntu Server, accepting all default settings. Be sure to write down your Ubuntu 
host name, Ubuntu user name, and password. When given the option, decline to install any extra software 
bundled with the OS. If needed, the software can be installed later.
6.	 During the installation, you might be asked whether you want to install the GRUB boot loader in the Master 
Boot Record on the hard drive (see Figure 20-10). GRUB (GR and Unified Bootloader) is a boot loader used

Notes As you learn to use Ubuntu, know that the help.ubuntu.com website contains a wealth of information about 
Ubuntu and links to even more help.
Directory and File Layout
Normally, the shell prompt includes the user name, host name, and the current directory, fol-
lowed by a $. For example, in Figure 20-11, the first shell prompt shows the user name is jean, 
the host name is VM50, and the ~ character indicates the user’s home directory, which for 
the jean account is /home/jean. When you first log in to Linux, the current directory is always 
the home directory of the logged-in user. (In Linux, directories in a path are separated with forward slashes, 
in contrast to the backward slashes used by Windows.)

to manage dual-boot systems and should not be installed if another OS is managing the dual boot. You can, 
however, choose to install it because Ubuntu Server is the only OS in your VM.
7.	 After the VM restarts, Ubuntu Server launches, and you should see the terminal shell, as shown in Figure 20-11.
8.	 Enter your user name and password and you’re logged in to Ubuntu Server. In the figure, the logged-in 
user is jean.
As you read along in the chapter learning about Linux commands, you can use your Ubuntu VM to practice these 
commands.

Virtualization, Linux, and Mac OS X 
Explore Directories and Files
Let’s explore a few directories and files. As shown in Figure 20-12, use these commands:
Applying  Concepts
A+  
220-902 
2.1
1.	 Use the pwd command (print working directory) to display the full path to the current directory, 
which is /home/jean in the figure.
2.	 Use the cd .. command to move up one directory to /home.
3.	 Use the ls command to display the list of files and subdirectories in the /home directory. Notice in the figure, 
the one subdirectory in the /home directory is jean.
4.	 Use the ls –l command to display the results using the long format. (A space must precede the –l 
parameter.)
	
Here is an explanation of the types of information in the list:
	 Attributes. The first 10 characters define the file or directory attributes. The first character identifies 
the type of item: A d is a directory; a – is a regular file, and an l indicates the item is a link to another 
location. The other nine characters define the read, write, and execute permissions assigned to the file 
or directory.
	 Links. The second column lists the number of links the item has. In Linux, a link is similar to a Windows 
shortcut to a file or directory.
	 Owners. The third column lists the user owner and the fourth column lists the group that owns the file or 
directory. In Figure 20-12, the owner is jean and the owner group is also jean.
	 Size, date, and name. The last columns list the size of the file or directory in bytes, the date the item was 
last modified, and the name of the file or directory.
5.	 When you use the cd .. command again, you move up to the main directory in Linux, called the root 
directory, which is indicated with a forward slash. The ls –l command lists the files and subdirectories 
in the root.

Linux Operating System
20
Table 20-2 lists some important directories that are created in the root during a typical Linux installation. 
(Some distributions of Linux modify the directory structure.) Not all directories in the root are listed in 
the table.
Directory
Description
/bin
Contains programs and commands necessary to boot the system and perform other system tasks 
not reserved for the administrator, such as shutdown and reboot.
/boot
Consists of components needed for the boot process, such as boot loaders.
/dev
Holds device names, which consist of the type of device and a number identifying the device. 
Actual device drivers are located in the /lib/modules /[kernel version]/ directory.
/etc
Contains system configuration data, including configuration files and settings and their 
subdirectories. These files are used for tasks such as configuring a user account, changing system 
settings, and configuring a domain name resolution service.
/home
Contains user data. Every user on the system has a directory in the /home directory, such as /
home/jean or /home/scott, and when a user logs in, that directory becomes the current working 
directory.
/lib
Stores common libraries used by applications so that more than one application can use the same 
library at one time. An example is the library of C programming code, without which only the 
kernel of the Linux system could run.
/lost+found
Stores data that is lost when files are truncated or when an attempt to fix system errors is 
unsuccessful.
/opt
Contains installations of third-party applications such as web browsers that do not come with the 
Linux OS distribution.
/root
The home directory for the root user; contains only files specific to the root user. Don’t confuse 
this directory with the root, which contains all the directories listed in this table.
/sbin
Stores commands required for system administration.
/tmp
Stores temporary files, such as the ones that applications use during installation and operation.
/usr
Constitutes the major section of the Linux file system and contains read-only data.
/var
Holds variable data such as logs, email, news, print spools, and administrative files.
Table 20-2  Important directories in a typical Linux root directory
Root Account and User Accounts
For a Linux server, the system administrator is the person who installs updates to the OS (called 
patches), manages backup processes, supports the installation of software and hardware, sets 
up user accounts, resets passwords, and generally supports users. The system administrator has 
root privileges, which means that he or she can access all the functions of the OS; the principal 
user account is called the root account. Notice in Figure 20-12 that all the directories and files in the root 
directory belong to the root account.
When logged in to the root account, the administrator is called the superuser. By default, Ubuntu disables 
login to the root account. Later in the chapter, you learn how to use the sudo command to execute any 
command that requires root access when you are logged in to the system with a regular user account that 
has root privileges.
A+  
220-902 
2.1
Notes The Linux command prompt for the root user is different from the command prompt for ordinary users. The root 
command prompt is #, and other users have the $ command prompt. See Figure 20-13. In the figure, the su command is 
used to change the currently logged-in user from root to jean.

Linux Commands
Table 20-3 describes some basic Linux commands, together with simple examples of how some 
are used. As you read along, be aware that all commands entered in Linux are case sensitive, 
meaning that uppercase and lowercase matter.
A+  
220-902 
2.1
Command
Description
adduser
Adds a user to a system:
adduser <username>
apt-get
Used to install and remove packages in Linux. When you first install Linux, it installs with only a 
bare-bones set of commands and utilities and includes a library of packages that you can install 
as needed. For example, to install the SSH (Secure Shell) package so you can remote in to your Linux 
server, use this command:
sudo apt-get install ssh
The apt-get command requires root access, which means you must precede the command with 
sudo. See sudo later in this table.
cat
Lets you view the contents of a file. Many Linux commands can use the redirection symbol > to 
redirect the output of the command. For example, use the redirection symbol with the cat command 
to copy a file:
cat /etc/shells > newfile
The contents of the shells file are written to newfile.
cd
Changes the directory. For example:
To change the directory to /etc: cd /etc
To move up one level in the directory tree: cd ..
To go to the root: cd /
chmod
Changes modes (or permissions) for a file or directory. You’ll see several examples of this command 
later in the chapter.
chown
Changes the owner of a file or directory.
clear
Clears the screen. This command is useful when the screen has become cluttered with commands and 
data that you no longer need to view.
cp
Copies a file:
cp <source> <destination>
dd
Copies and converts files, directories, partitions, and even entire DVDs or hard drives. It’s a powerful 
command with many practical uses and parameters, and only a superuser can use it. The basic format 
of the command is: dd if=<source> of=<destination>
For example, use this command to create an ISO file from the contents of a CD: dd if=/dev/
cdrom of=/tmp/cdimage.iso
deluser
Removes a user from a system:
deluser <username>
Remove the user and his home directory:
deluser –remove-home <username>
df
Stands for disk filesystem and displays the amount of free space on the hard drive.
To see the file system the drive is using: df –T

Command
Description
echo
Displays information on the screen. For example, to display which shell is currently being used, 
enter this command:
echo $SHELL
exit
Logs out; the login shell prompt appears, where you can log in again.
grep
Searches for a specific pattern in a file or in multiple files:
grep <pattern> <file>
ifconfig
Used to troubleshoot problems with network connections under TCP/IP. This command can disable 
and enable network adapters and assign a static IP address to an adapter. For example, to show all 
configuration information:
ifconfig –a
To enable or disable an adapter, use the up or down parameter. For example, to enable eth0, the 
first Ethernet interface:
sudo ifconfig eth0 up
To assign a static IP address to the eth0 interface: ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.90
iwconfig
Works similarly to ifconfig, but applies only to wireless networks. Use it to display information 
about the wireless adapter’s configuration or to change that configuration. Two examples:
To set the wireless NIC to Ad-Hoc mode so that other devices within range can connect directly to it, 
use this command, where wlan0 identifies the wireless adapter:
iwconfig wlan0 mode Ad-Hoc
To force the NIC to use channel 3: iwconfig wlan0 channel 3
kill
Kills a process instead of waiting for the process to terminate. Use the ps command to list process 
IDs. To end a process, use the kill command followed by the PID. For example, to kill the process 
with PID of 984: kill 984
The command sends a signal to the process to end itself orderly. If the process doesn’t die peacefully, 
you can get the kernel involved to forcefully end the process: kill –kill 984
ls
Functions similarly to the DOS Dir command, which displays a list of directories and files. 
For example:
To list files in the /etc directory, using the long parameter for a complete listing: ls -l /etc
To include hidden files in the list: ls –la /etc
(In Linux, hidden files begin with a . period.)
man
Displays the online help manual, called man pages. For example, to get information about the echo 
command:
man echo
The manual program displays information about the command. To exit the manual program, type q.
mkdir
Makes a new directory:
mkdir <directory>
mv
Moves a file or renames it, if the source and destination are the same directory:
mv <source> <destination>
parted
Manages partitions on a hard drive and works with MBR and GPT drives.
passwd
Changes your password. When a user enters the command, she is asked for the old password and then 
can change the password.
The superuser can change the password for any account and does not need to enter the account’s old 
password, making it possible to reset a forgotten password.
ping
Used to test network connections by sending a request packet to a host. If a connection is 
successful, the host will return a response packet. For example:
ping 192.168.1.100
The ping results continue until you manually stop the process. Press Ctrl+C to break out of the process.
To specify the number of pings: ping 192.168.1.100 –c 4
ps
Stands for process status and displays the process table so that you can identify process IDs for 
currently running processes (once you know the process ID, you can use the kill command to 
terminate a process):
To list processes of current user: ps
To list processes owned by all users: ps aux

Virtualization, Linux, and Mac OS X 
Here are a few tips when using commands at a shell prompt:
	 Retrieve previous commands. Press the arrow-up key to retrieve previously entered commands and then 
edit a command that appears.
	 Use wildcard characters. Linux can use the * and ? wildcard characters in command lines, similar to 
Windows. For example, the ls *.??? command lists all items with any file name and the file extension must 
have three characters. In addition, Linux provides a third wildcard: Brackets can give a choice of characters. 
For example, the ls *.[abc]* command lists all files whose file extension begins with a, b, or c.  
	 Redirect output. Normally output from a command displays on the screen. To redirect that output 
to a file, use the redirection symbol >. For example, to redirect output of ifconfig to myfile, use this 
command: ifconfig >myfile
	 Page the output. Append |more to the end of a command line to display the results of the command on 
the screen one page at a time. For example, to page the ls command: ls -l |more
	 Use Ctrl+C. To break out of a command or process, press Ctrl+C. Use it to recover after entering 
a wrong command or to stop a command that requires a manual halt.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to be familiar with these Linux commands: ls, grep, cd, shutdown, 
pwd, passwd, mv, cp, rm, mkdir, chmod, iwconfig, ifconfig, ps, q, su, sudo, apt-get, vi, and dd.
Command
Description
pwd
Shows the name of the current working directory: pwd
When you first log in to Linux, the directory is /home/username.
rm
Removes or deletes the file or files that are specified:
rm <file>
rmdir
Removes or deletes an empty directory:
rmdir <directory>
shutdown
Automated shut down to the system. Here are options:
To halt or shut down now: sudo shutdown –h now
To warn users and then shut down: sudo shutdown –h +10 “Everyone log out now. The 
system will shut down in 10 minutes for maintenance.”
To reboot now: sudo shutdown –r now
su
Stands for substitute user and opens a new terminal shell for a different user account. When 
switching to superuser, add sudo to the command.
To switch to the root account: sudo su root
To switch back to the jean account: su jean
sudo
Stands for substitute user to do the command and is pronounced “sue-doe” or “sue-doo”. When 
logged in as a normal user with an account that has the right to use root commands, you can start 
a command with sudo to run the command as the superuser. User password is required.  
For example: sudo shutdown –h now
touch
Creates a blank file in the current directory. For example:
touch myfile
vi
Launches a full-screen editor that can be used to edit a file:
vi <file>
who
Displays a list of users currently logged in:
who

Notes The current Linux file system is ext4 (fourth extended file system), which replaced the ext3 file system. 
The ext3 file system was the first file system to support journaling, which is a technique that tracks and stores 
changes to the hard drive and helps prevent file system corruption.
The vi Editor
The vi editor (visual editor) is a text editor that works in command mode (to enter commands) 
or in insert mode (to edit text). In this section, you learn how to create a text file in the vi edi-
tor, edit text, and save your changes. All vi commands are case sensitive.

Install FTP Server in Ubuntu
In this project, you set up an FTP server in Ubuntu. Follow these steps:
Hands-On  Project 20-4
A+  
220-902 
2.1
1.	 Using the same VM you created earlier, log in to Ubuntu Server with your user name and password.
2.	 To install the FTP program named vsftpd, enter this command:
	 sudo apt-get install vsftpd
3.	 Respond to the prompts and then wait for the package to install.
4.	 Now you need to configure the FTP program by editing the /etc/vsftpd.conf text file. But before you edit 
the file, go to the /etc directory and make a backup copy of the file just in case you need it later. The sudo 
command is needed because files in the /etc directory belong to root:
	 cd /etc
	
sudo cp vsftpd.conf vsftpd.backup

5.	 Use the vi editor to edit the FTP configuration file: sudo vi vsftpd.conf
6.	 Verify and/or change three lines in the file to create the settings listed. Part of the file, including the three 
lines, is shown in Figure 20-15.
anonymous_enable=NO
Disable anonymous logins.
local_enable=YES
If necessary, remove the # to uncomment the line and allow local users 
to log in.
write_enable=YES
If necessary, remove the # to uncomment the line and allow users to write 
to a directory.
7.	 Exit the vi editor, saving your changes. Restart the FTP service using this command: sudo restart vsftpd
8.	 To test your FTP server using the local machine, enter ftp 127.0.0.1. Then enter your user name and pass-
word. The ftp> prompt appears. Next use the dir command to see a list of directories and files. You should see 
the mydir directory and the mymemo file that you created in your /home/username directory earlier.
9.	 If you want to transfer files with FTP commands, use the get and put commands. To download the mymemo 
file, use the command get mymemo. Type bye to disconnect from the FTP server.
10.	To find out the IP address of the server, type ifconfig.
11.	Go to another computer on your local network, connect to your FTP server using the IP address of the server, 
and download the mymemo file to the local machine. See Figure 20-16. Your IP address might be different 
from the one shown in the figure.
12.	Return to Ubuntu Server and examine the FTP log file /var/log/vsftpd.log. Because the file is short, you can 
use the cat command to display the entire log. The sudo command is required because /var files belong to 
root: sudo cat /var/log/vsftpd.log

Assigning Permissions to Files or Directories
A file or directory can have read, write, and/or execute permissions assigned to it. Permissions 
can be assigned to (a) the owner, (b) other users in the same group as the owner, and (c) all 
users. The chmod command is used to manage permissions for files and directories. To see 
current permissions, examine the 10 characters in the left column that display when you use 
the ls –l command. Here is the explanation of these characters:
	 The first character identifies the type of item (d is a directory; - is a regular file).
	 Characters 2–4 show the permissions assigned the owner (for example, rwx says the owner has read, 
write, and execute permissions).
	 Characters 5–7 show the permissions assigned the group (for example, r-x says the group has read and 
execute permissions, but not write permission).
	 Characters 8–10 show the permissions for others (for example, --- says others don’t have read, write, 
or execute permission).
The chmod command changes these permissions. For example, suppose the output for the ls –l command 
on the /home/jean directory is that shown in Figure 20-18.

As labeled in the figure, the permissions for jean as owner is rwx (read, write, and execute). The permissions 
for the jean group are r-x (read and execute, but not write), and the permissions for others are also r-x. If the 
user jean wants to give read, write, and execute permissions to everyone (group and other), she can use this 
command:
chmod go+rwx /home/jean
The g assigns permission to the group and the o assigns permissions to others. (u can assign permissions 
to the owner.) A plus (+) gives permissions and a minus (–) removes permissions.

to your own home directory. For example, you can use this command to make a new copy of the mymemo file 
you created earlier:
	 cp mymemo mymemo.charlie
	
When you do so, permission is denied.
2.	 Log back in to Ubuntu Server with your own account.
3.	 To install the chmod command, use this command:

Dual-Boot Systems and a Live CD
When you installed Ubuntu Server, you installed the GRUB boot loader, which installs in the 
MBR for an MBR hard drive. An earlier Linux boot loader is LILO (LInux boot LOader), 
which is seldom used today. GRUB and LILO are used to manage dual-boot systems and to 
allow users to select different Linux kernels at the boot.
If Linux is already installed in a system and you install Windows in a dual boot, Windows setup might 
not recognize the Linux installation is present and overwrite GRUB. When you boot the system, it boots 
into Windows without a boot loader menu to select Linux or Windows. This problem of a missing GRUB 
can be solved by booting the system from a bootable Linux USB flash drive or CD, which is called a 
live CD. A live CD can boot up a live version of Linux, complete with Internet access and all the tools 
you normally have available in a hard drive installation of Linux, but without installing the OS on the hard 
drive. For example, when you start the Ubuntu Desktop installation, the first screen (see Figure 20-19) 
gives you the option to try Ubuntu without installing it on your hard drive. This live CD option installs 
Ubuntu only in memory.
A+  
220-902

Figure 20-19  Use a live CD to try Ubuntu Desktop without installing it on your hard drive

After booting from a live CD, you can reinstall GRUB and configure GRUB to manage the dual boot 
with Linux and Windows. The details of how to do that are beyond the scope of this chapter.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-902 exam expects you to know about GRUB and LILO and the problem of a missing GRUB.
Notes In a dual boot with Windows and Linux, you might want to access files in either volume from either OS. 
Know that Linux can access the NTFS file system on the Windows volume, but Windows cannot access the ext4 file 
system on the Linux volume. You can, however, install in Windows third-party software, such as Paragon ExtFS for 
Windows (paragon-software.com), to access the ext4 volume.

2.1, 2.2
1.	 Go to ubuntu.com/download/desktop and download the free Ubuntu Desktop OS to your hard drive. 
The file that downloads is an ISO file.
2.	 Open the Hyper-V Manager, Oracle VM VirtualBox, Virtual PC Manager, or VMware Workstation Player manager 
and create a new VM named VM60. Mount the ISO file that contains the Ubuntu Desktop download to a virtual 
DVD in your VM.
3.	 Start up the VM and install Ubuntu Desktop in the VM, accepting all default settings. Be sure to write down 
your Ubuntu host name, Ubuntu user name, and password. When given the option, decline to install any extra 
software bundled with the OS. If needed, the software can be installed later.
4.	 When asked to restart the VM, first dismount (remove) the ISO file from the optical drive so that the VM boots 
to the hard drive. After Ubuntu Desktop launches, log in with your user name and password. Figure 20-20 
shows the desktop with the System Settings window open and the System menu displayed.
5.	 Take a few minutes to poke around the desktop. For example, to open a Terminal window where you can 
enter Linux commands, click the Search icon to open the Search app and type terminal. Then click 
Terminal in the Applications group.
6.	 To shut down Ubuntu Desktop, click the System (cog) icon in the upper-right corner of the screen and click 
Shut Down in the System menu that appears.

Backups and Updates
When supporting a Linux system, an IT technician needs to know how to create and maintain 
scheduled backups and system updates. For Ubuntu, the tools you use depend on whether you 
plan to do these chores from the shell prompt in Ubuntu Server or the graphical user interface 
in Ubuntu Desktop.
Here is what you need to know to get you started with making backups:
	 What is a dump and clone? In Linux, a dump is a collection of data that is copied to backup media. 
For example, when Linux encounters a kernel panic (an error from which it cannot recover), it dumps 
an image of memory to a disk file for later examination. The image is called a core dump. You can dump 
the entire Linux volume to an external hard drive or dump a data folder to a location on the network. 
The first dump is called the initial dump and subsequent incremental dumps are called appended dumps 
or incremental dumps. A clone is an image of the entire partition on which Linux is installed.
	 Which backup program should I use? Before choosing a shell prompt command or graphical program 
for the desktop, research the program to find out what others are saying about it and how it works. 
Compare several programs to find the one right for you. Examples of backup programs include the 
dump and TAR commands used at a shell prompt and the graphical SimpleBackupSuite that works 
from the desktop.
A+  
220-902 
2.1
Notes For an overview of backup programs for Ubuntu, visit this page: help.ubuntu.com/community/
BackupYourSystem%20.
Also, the cron and crontab commands can be used to schedule any shell command in Linux, including cp commands 
for making backups to another media. The crontab (cron table) command is used to schedule jobs and the cron command 
executes these jobs.
Update Linux from the Shell Prompt
In general, Linux updates don’t come as often as Windows or OS X updates. The creator of your Linux 
distribution publishes updates to packages in the current release of a distribution and also publishes new 
releases of a distribution. When you first log in to the system, Linux reports the package updates available 
(see Figure 20-21).

At a shell prompt, use these commands to update the packages previously installed in your system:
1. To refresh the list of all available updates: 
	 sudo apt-get update
2. To update only the installed packages: 
	 sudo apt-get upgrade
A new release of a distribution contains all updates since the last release. As a Linux administrator, you 
need to stay aware of the latest release of the distribution you are using and decide when or if it’s appropriate 
to upgrade to that release.
Before you upgrade to a new release, be sure you have backups of your data and a clone of the entire 
Linux partition. Here’s how to upgrade to a new release for Ubuntu Server:
1. Follow the previous steps to update all packages installed in the system.
2. To make sure the latest update manager program is installed:
	 sudo apt-get install update-manager-core
3. To install the latest release of Ubuntu Server:
	 sudo do-release-upgrade
If a new release is available, the last command reports it and you can follow directions to install it.
Update Ubuntu Desktop
In Ubuntu Desktop, the Software Updater app manages updates to packages and new releases of Ubuntu 
Desktop. To open the updater, click the Search app and type updater in the Search box. Then click Software 
Updater (see Figure 20-22).
Figure 20-22  Find and launch Software Updater

The updater searches for updates. In the box that appears, click Details of updates to see a list of updates 
(see the left side of Figure 20-23). To install updates, select your updates and click Install Now. To change 
update settings, click Settings. In the Software & Updates box (see the right side of Figure 20-23), you can 
decide how updates are managed.

Now that you’re familiar with Linux, let’s move on to OS X.
Mac OS X Operating System
OS X is the latest version of the proprietary operating system only available for Macintosh 
computers by Apple Inc. (apple.com). Like Linux, OS X is built on a UNIX foundation. The 
first Mac OS was released in 1984, and the final “classic” Mac OS, called Mac OS 9, was 
released in 1999. The first iteration of the desktop version of Mac OS X, dubbed “Cheetah,” 
became available in 2001. From that point forward, the operating system continued to be called OS X 
(pronounced “O-S-ten”) and received a version number to track its progress. The most recent release at the 
time of this writing, Yosemite, is version 10.10. Version 10.11, El Capitan, is already available in beta and 
is expected to be released as a free upgrade by the end of 2015.

Get to Know the OS X Desktop
The OS X desktop, with its major components labeled, is shown in Figure 20-24. The Finder application, 
which can help you find applications and data files, is open and active. Because Finder is the currently 
active application, the menu bar for the Finder window is displayed at the top of the screen. The menu bar 
provides drop-down menus that contain options for working with applications, files, and the interface.
By default, the dock appears at the bottom of the desktop. It contains shortcut icons to access frequently 
used applications. To open an application from its icon in the dock, click it once. The icons in the dock that 
represent open applications have a small, black dot underneath them. The OS X desktop can also include 
shortcuts that provide quick access to files, folders, and applications.

Navigating OS X is made easier with a few, simple gestures, or finger movements, on the trackpad. Later 
in this chapter, you learn how to change the trackpad settings. In the meantime, here are a few of the most 
important default gestures:
	 Secondary click. A secondary click is similar in function to a right-click in Windows. To secondary click, tap 
the lower-right corner of the trackpad with one finger or right-click the mouse. (You can also configure a 
secondary click to tap the trackpad with two fingers.)
Notes Closing an app’s window does not close the app. To quit an app, secondary-click (tap two fingers on the 
trackpad or right-click the mouse) the app’s icon in the dock and click Quit in the menu that appears above the dock. 
Alternately, when the app’s window is active on the desktop, click the name of the app in the menu bar and click Quit 
at the bottom of the drop-down menu.

	 Scroll. Scroll bars are typically hidden from view in OS X because the page can be scrolled by swiping 
two fingers up or down on the trackpad.
	 Zoom. Similar to zoom on a mobile device, pinch two fingers together to zoom out and spread two 
fingers apart to zoom in.
	 Pinch. Pinch with three fingers and your thumb to show the Launchpad (see Figure 20-26), which 
is somewhat similar to the Start screen in Windows and shows all apps installed on the computer. 
Spread apart with three fingers and your thumb to return to the desktop. If you’re already on the

	 Swipe. The number of fingers, direction of the swipe, and location of the swipe can all cause different 
results. Some of the most useful are:
	 Swiping left or right with two fingers scrolls horizontally within an app (such as when scrolling 
through photos in the Photos app), and swiping left or right with three fingers switches between  
full-screen apps.
	 Swipe two fingers from the right edge of the trackpad to reveal the Notification Center, as shown 
in Figure 20-27.
	 Swipe up with three fingers to see Mission Control (see Figure 20-28), which gives an overview of 
all open windows and a thumbnail of Dashboard and the desktop. Dashboard (see Figure 20-29)

Multiple Desktops
Mission Control includes a feature called multiple desktops, which, as its name says, is several desktop 
screens each with its own collection of open windows. Suppose you’re working with several windows 
for a school project, and you have a few more windows open for a project at work. You can place 
the school project windows on one desktop, called a Space, and place the work project windows on 
a separate desktop or Space.
To accomplish this feat, first open Mission Control as described above. By default, a single desktop 
thumbnail shows at the top of the screen beside the Dashboard thumbnail (refer back to Figure 20-28), 
and all the open windows show in this one desktop. To create a second desktop, drag a window’s 
thumbnail to the right side of the default desktop thumbnail, and drop the window. A second 
desktop appears to hold that window. Repeat with another window for a third and fourth desktops, 
as shown in Figure 20-35.
Drag an

Switch between desktops by clicking the desktop you want in Mission Control. Alternately, you can 
press control + left arrow or control + right arrow to switch between desktop screens. When an app is 
in full-screen mode, it acts as a separate Space and will show up in the list of Spaces as do the multiple 
desktops. Desktop configurations remain in place even when the computer is rebooted.
You can customize each desktop with a different wallpaper and with different apps that appear only 
on that desktop or in all desktops. To set a desktop’s wallpaper, go to that desktop and secondary-click 
the desktop background, then click Change Desktop Background (see Figure 20-36a). The Desktop & 
Screen Saver window opens. (This window is one of the tools in System Preferences, which you learn 
about later in this chapter.) Select your wallpaper and close the window. Wallpaper settings in other, 
pre-existing desktops won’t be affected. To assign an app to a specific desktop, go to that desktop and 
secondary-click the app’s icon in the dock (see Figure 20-36b). Select Options then click This Desktop.

Notice in Figure 20-37 that iCloud Drive is listed in the sidebar along with other storage locations like 
Desktop, Documents, and Downloads. Files stored in iCloud Drive from any device connected with your 
Apple ID are automatically synced to your Mac in iCloud Drive. By default, files are stored inside folders 
titled by the application that created the file. For example, a spreadsheet created by the Numbers app is 
stored in the Numbers folder. However, you can create your own folders and move files to these folders.
Figure 20-38  Use Spotlight to search for files and folders
Source: Apple Inc.
Notes When you no longer need a file or folder, drag its icon to the Trash Can until the Trash Can is highlighted, 
and release. Note that this is the only way you can delete icons from the Finder window. When an item is in the Trash 
Can, you can recover it: Click Trash Can to open it and drag an item in the Trash Can to another location.
OS Differences Changes to the iCloud Drive folder tree can only be made in OS X, not in iOS. iPhone and iPad don’t 
have an iCloud Drive app or a Finder app that lets you manipulate the files and folders of iCloud Drive. So keep this limitation 
in mind when choosing between iCloud Drive or a third-party app, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, or OneDrive. These 
mobile apps all give you the ability to change the folder tree from a mobile device.
Keychain
Finder also gives access to the Utilities folder, which contains a whole collection of tools for customizing 
other features of OS X. In Finder, click Applications in the sidebar, then scroll down and double-click Utilities. 
Figure 20-39 shows the contents of the Utilities folder.
You’ll learn about several of these utilities through the rest of this chapter. For now, let’s look at Keychain, 
which is OS X’s built-in password manager utility. To open Keychain, double-click Keychain Access. From 
the Keychain Access window (see the left side of Figure 20-40), you can view, edit, and remove accounts 
for applications, websites, servers, and other accounts that you’ve added, such as credit card numbers and 
bank accounts.
If you have problems with Keychain, verify or repair the Keychain configuration. In the Keychain Access 
menu, click Keychain First Aid. In the Keychain First Aid window (see the right side of Figure 20-40), 
make sure Verify is selected, then click Start. If the verification process reports a problem, select Repair 
and click Start.

Sharing
In System Preferences, click Sharing to open the Sharing window where you can set up file and folder 
sharing on the network, printer sharing, remote access, and screen sharing. Screen Sharing (see Figure 20-44) 
works similarly to Remote Assistance in Windows. When you turn on Screen Sharing, you can then use the 
Messages app to remotely view and control another Mac computer.
Figure 20-44  Screen Sharing makes it easier to collaborate on projects or to help other users 
with their computers
Source: Apple Inc.
If your Mac has an optical drive, the Sharing window includes the option DVD or CD Sharing. This 
feature, called Remote Disc, gives other Mac computers on the network access to this computer’s optical 
drive. Remote Disc is especially useful when you need to install software or drivers from a disc on a Mac 
that doesn’t have an optical drive. After you turn on DVD or CD Sharing on the Mac that has an optical 
drive, go to the Mac that doesn’t have an optical drive and open Finder. In Finder, click Remote Disc in 
the sidebar under Devices (refer back to Figure 20-37).
OS Differences You can enable remote disc sharing on a Windows computer. To share a Windows computer’s optical 
drive with Macs on your network, download and install DVD or CD Sharing Update 1.0 for Windows, available at the 
following website: support.apple.com/kb/DL112?locale=en_US.
Terminal
Terminal in OS X works much the same way as does a terminal shell in Linux. This is because both 
operating systems are based on UNIX. To open Terminal, first open Finder, click Applications in the sidebar, 
then scroll down and double-click the Utilities folder. Scroll down and double-click Terminal. (Alternately, 
press  + spacebar to open Spotlight, type Terminal, and press return.) The Terminal window opens, as 
shown in Figure 20-45.

Practice OS X Commands
To practice using Terminal, repeat the steps in Hands-On Project 20-3 using the OS X Terminal 
window. (For the df –T command, don’t use the –T parameter.) In OS X, the final command of 
that project, exit, will not produce the same results as it does in Linux. Research online and 
answer the following questions about closing the Terminal window:
1.	 What does the command exit do in Terminal?
2.	 How can you adjust Terminal settings so that exit closes the Terminal window?
3.	 What keyboard shortcut can you use instead to close the Terminal window?

Notes Even if you don’t have a Mac computer to use for completing this project, you can still research the 
answers to the questions above. The information is readily available online.
Kill a Process
Terminal is a powerful tool and can be used to kill a hung process or to kill a process you suspect to 
be malware. First, try to use force quit to end the process. If that doesn’t work, use Terminal to end 
the process. Follow these general directions to practice this skill:
1.	 Once again, install the Evernote app, but don’t launch it.
2.	 Open Terminal. Use this command to list all running processes (the x option displays all processes, even 
those not started in this shell): ps x.
3.	 Leave Terminal open. Launch the Evernote app. Return to the Terminal window and list all running processes 
again. What are the Evernote app process IDs? Of the two process IDs, which one represents the application 
itself, and which one represents a login item?
4.	 The pgrep command combines the functionality of ps and grep. Research online to find the Apple man 
page for pgrep. What do the –f and –l options do?

5.	 Confirm the Evernote app’s process IDs with the command pgrep –f –l Evernote. (Be sure to capitalize 
the E in Evernote.) Do the process IDs match the information you found earlier?
6.	 Use Terminal to kill the Evernote app (not the login item).
7.	 Return to the desktop and uninstall Evernote.
Maintain and Support a Mac
In addition to working with files and applications, you will also need to know how to support 
and maintain OS X, including updates, backups, and hard drive maintenance. This section does 
not give you all you need to know to service Mac computers; it is simply intended to show you 
some important tools for working with the system. For more information specific to working 
with Macs, study books devoted specifically to the Mac, documentation and manuals that come with your 
system or its components, and the Apple website (support.apple.com).

Caution
Many Apple computers are covered by an Apple Care warranty, which provides excellent coverage for Mac 
computers. Always be absolutely certain a Mac is not covered by Apple Care before opening the case or doing anything 
else that might void the warranty.
Update OS X, Drivers, and Firmware
Just like Windows, OS X needs regular updates. Updates often address zero-day vulnerabilities, which 
makes these updates important to maintaining a healthy system. However, sometimes the updates 
themselves introduce bugs, which is why many Mac experts advise against setting OS X updates to install 
automatically. Instead, waiting a few days after an OS X update’s release before manually installing the 
update gives you a chance to see if the update introduces any significant issues.
OS X updates come 
from the App Store. To 
manually update OS X, 
click the App Store icon 
in the dock, then click 
Updates in the toolbar. Any 
available updates will show 
near the top of the screen, 
as shown in Figure 20-46. 
Additional updates to apps 
might also be available 
in this window, depending 
on whether you’ve 
configured the computer 
to automatically install 
app updates.

Virtualization, Linux, and Mac OS X 
To change the settings for automatic updates, open System Preferences and click App Store (see Figure 20-47). 
Here is an explanation of each option presented:
	 Automatically check for updates. This option must be checked for any of its sub options to be available.
	 Download newly available updates in the background. This option downloads updates without 
installing them.
	 Install app updates. This option installs all updates to App Store applications without first requiring 
user approval.
	 Install OS X updates. This option installs all updates to the operating system without first requiring user 
approval.
	 Install system data files and security updates. This option installs critical system patches that address 
known vulnerabilities.
	 Automatically download apps purchased on other Macs. This option installs apps purchased through 
the App Store on other Mac computers using the same Apple ID.
Notes Printer, scanner, and graphics driver updates are usually included in the OS X updates. Other devices that 
require drivers, if not included in OS X, can be downloaded from the manufacturer’s website and installed. These drivers 
will not be updated through OS X updates. If any problems are encountered with that device, you’ll need to check the 
manufacturer’s website for updates.
Figure 20-47  Click Check Now to check for requested updates

Usually any needed firmware updates are included in the OS X update. Occasionally, however, Apple has 
released a firmware update as a stand-alone installer. You can find a list of available firmware updates in 
the Apple Knowledge Base Article at support.apple.com/en-us/HT201518.
To determine whether a Mac computer needs a firmware update, first check the current firmware version 
on the computer. This and a great deal more information is available in the System Information app. Open 
Finder, navigate to the Utilities folder, and double-click System Information. In the System Information 
window (see Figure 20-48), select Hardware in the sidebar and look under Hardware Overview for the 
Model Identifier, Boot ROM Version, and SMC Version (system), as labeled in Figure 20-48. Compare 
the information in the System Information window with the information for the latest firmware update 
available on the support.apple.com website. Install a firmware update only if the version listed on Apple’s 
website is newer than what is currently installed on the computer.

Notes Many experts believe that antivirus/anti-malware software is not required on a Mac computer. Whether this is 
true or not is still hotly debated. If you do choose to use anti-malware, however, be sure to keep it updated. One example 
of anti-malware for a Mac is AdwareMedic (adwaremedic.com) by Malwarebytes, which works well to remove adware that 
has infected a system.

Virtualization, Linux, and Mac OS X 
Back up and Restore with Time Machine
Like iOS mobile devices, Mac computers can use iCloud Drive to store files and folders in the cloud and 
sync this content across all of your devices. Unlike the mobile devices you learned about in the chapter, 
“Supporting Mobile Operating Systems,” iCloud is not sufficient for backing up a Mac. For this purpose, 
OS X includes Time Machine, which is a built-in backup utility that automatically backs up user-created 
data, applications, and system files onto an external hard drive attached either directly to the computer 
or through the local network. Once Time Machine is set up, backups are updated in the background. 
Depending on the space available on the backup drive, Time Machine keeps hourly backups for 24 hours, 
daily backups for a month, and weekly backups until the disk is full. Oldest backups are deleted to make 
space for new backups.
To set up Time Machine in OS X, open System Preferences and click Time Machine. The Time Machine 
window appears, as shown in Figure 20-50.
Figure 20-50  Click Options to choose which content to include in a Time Machine backup
Source: Apple Inc.
Follow the on-screen directions to select a backup disk and configure backup options. Everything on the 
disk will be erased. The original backup will be at least 20 GB, includes the entire OS X volume, and takes 
some time to complete.
Notes When your Mac OS X computer is not connected to the backup disk, Time Machine stores backup copies, 
called local snapshots, of created, modified, or deleted files on the startup drive. When you reconnect the computer to 
the backup disk, the local snapshots are copied to the backup disk. Local snapshots stay on the startup drive as long as 
they don’t take up too much space, and can be restored from the startup drive if needed. Time Machine saves one daily 
snapshot each day and one weekly snapshot each week while the backup disk is disconnected.
To recover a file or folder from Time Machine, open Finder. In the Applications group, double-click 
Time Machine. The timeline and available backups in Finder appear (see Figure 20-51). Use the Finder 
window to locate the file or folder. Then go back though time to find the version of the file or folder you 
want to restore. To move through time, you can use the timeline on the right, the arrow buttons, or click 
a Finder window in the stack of available windows. Select the item and click Restore.

Clone the Startup Disk
The startup disk is the entire volume on which OS X is installed. In addition to a Time Machine backup 
of the entire startup disk, you can also clone the startup disk. The clone is a disk image and is stored in 
a DMG file.
Notes A DMG file is a disk image file for a Mac and is similar to WIM or ISO files in Windows. In addition to storing 
clones, they’re often used to hold app installers, as are EXE files in Windows.
To create a clone in OS X, follow these steps:
1. Boot into the Recovery System, which boots from a hidden volume on the startup disk. To do this, 
restart the computer and hold down  + r until the Apple logo appears.
2. When the OS X Utilities window appears (see Figure 20-52), click Disk Utility and click Continue.

Drive Maintenance Tools
Hard drives in Mac computers require very little maintenance. However, performing a few simple tasks on 
a regular basis can help keep things running smoothly:
	 Empty the trash. To empty the Trash Can, click the Trash Can icon in the dock. Trash Can contents 
appear in a Finder window (see Figure 20-54). Click Empty and then click Empty Trash in the warning 
box. Items are permanently deleted.
	 Free up space. Maintain at least 15–20% free space on the hard drive for optimal performance. To see 
how much free space is available on the drive, in the Apple menu click About This Mac, and then click 
the Storage tab, as shown in Figure 20-55.

	 Install updates. Regularly check for and install OS X and app updates, which you learned how to do 
earlier in this chapter.
	 Verify no startup items. Programs that automatically launch at startup are called startup items and 
programs that automatically launch after a user logs in are called login items. Apple discourages the use 
of startup items because they slow down the startup process and items in the startup folder might be 
malware. You can verify the system doesn’t have startup items by looking in two directories that can 
contain startup items: /Library/StartupItems and /System/Library/StartupItems. Open Terminal and 
navigate to these directories, which you should find empty (see Figure 20-56).

	 Uninstall unneeded apps. Uninstall apps you no longer need. Apps obtained from the App Store are 
uninstalled from Launchpad. For apps installed from other sources besides the App Store, locate the app 
in Finder and drag the app to the Trash Can. Empty the trash to complete the uninstallation.
Repairs Using the Disk Utility App
The Disk Utility app can be used to repair disk permissions and to repair hard drive corruptions. To open 
Disk Utility, open Finder and navigate to the Utilities folder. Double-click Disk Utility. The sidebar of the 
Disk Utility window (see Figure 20-58) shows attached drives with partitions listed below each drive. In 
Figure 20-58, the hard drive has a single partition, which can be changed on the Partition tab, and a USB 
flash drive is connected to the computer. Two disk maintenance tasks you can perform from Disk Utility 
include the following:
	 Repair disk permissions. This task can prevent problems if you’ve recently installed or uninstalled apps. 
Repairing disk permissions resets file associations for App Store apps, which are sometimes altered 
during installation of apps from third-party sources. In Disk Utility, select the partition in the sidebar. 
On the First Aid tab (see Figure 20-59), click Verify Disk Permissions to check for disk permissions 
issues, or click Repair Disk Permissions to both verify and repair disk permissions.

	 Verify disk. Repair Disk checks the hard drive for minor problems, such as corrupted directory entries, 
and repairs them if necessary. This is especially important to perform if the system has recently frozen or 
experienced a sudden power loss. Notice in Figure 20-59 that Verify Disk is available, but Repair Disk is 
grayed out. This is because the disk cannot be repaired if the system is currently booted from that disk. 
Click Verify Disk. If the process finds errors, it will tell you to repair the disk using the Recovery System.

Troubleshoot OS X Startup
When you have problems with OS X startup, you can try booting the computer in Safe 
Mode and using the Repair Disk utility. If neither tool solves your problem, you can move 
on to recovering the system from a backup or clone or reinstalling OS X. All these solutions 
are discussed next.
Start the Computer in Safe Mode
Starting the computer in Safe Mode can solve problems when the computer won’t start due to file system 
errors. Safe Mode in OS X loads essential kernel components, prevents startup items and login items from 
launching, and loads a minimum of user processes. It also verifies the startup disk and repairs any file 
system errors it finds.
To boot the computer in Safe Mode, immediately after you hear the startup sound, press and hold the 
shift key. The boot will take longer than normal. To verify the computer booted into Safe Mode, open 
System Information. In the Software group, look for Boot Mode, which should say Safe (see Figure 20-60). 
Restart the computer normally and see whether the problem is solved.

If Safe Mode didn’t solve your problem, the next tool to try is the Repair Disk utility. First, boot into the 
Recovery System, then open Disk Utility. On the First Aid tab, click Repair Disk (see Figure 20-61), then 
restart into normal mode.

Recovery from a Time Machine Backup
If you have made a Time Machine backup of your system, you can use it to recover the startup disk. If 
the hard drive has failed, replace the hard drive and then connect your Time Machine backup device, for 
example, connect an external hard drive. Boot into the Recovery System. On the OS X Utilities window 
(refer back to Figure 20-52), select Restore From a Time Machine Backup and click Continue. Point to 
the backup device and follow directions on screen.
OS X Recovery with a Clone or the Internet
You can also boot the system from a previously made clone. Any drive holding a clone DMG file can be 
used as a startup disk. Connect the drive to the computer, press and hold the option key during boot, and 
then select the drive that holds the clone DMG file to run the boot from that drive.
It’s also possible to store the clone DMG file on a server on the network and, using a technology called 
NetBoot, the clone can be used to boot a Mac on the network or deploy OS X to multiple machines.
The image recovery process can also be performed over the Internet. If the Mac computer doesn’t find a 
recovery image and is connected to the Internet, it will download and install OS X from the Apple website. 
However, obviously this will not be a customized image with your apps and settings already configured. You’ll 
be starting from scratch. The version of OS X that came originally installed on your Mac will be installed.

Notes Many of these same steps can also help when troubleshooting kernel panics. A kernel panic is similar to a BSOD 
in Windows. It might be caused by something simple, like a crashed app or a network communication issue, or it might 
result from a corrupted OS X installation. OS X restarts automatically when experiencing a kernel panic. If the kernel panic 
continues to prompt restarts, OS X will stop trying after five attempts and shut down the computer.

Virtualization, Linux, and Mac OS X 
Boot Camp
One more hard drive option you should be aware of is made possible by Boot Camp, a utility 
in OS X that allows you to install and run Windows on a Mac computer. You saw earlier in 
Figure 20-58 where the Macintosh HD in the figure held one partition. Boot Camp can split 
the partition and install Windows in the new partition for a dual boot. Access the Boot Camp 
Assistant through the Utilities folder; Figure 20-62 shows the first screen with options in the process of 
installing Windows on a Mac. After Windows is installed, you can choose which OS to use as your default 
for the computer, or press and hold the option key when starting the computer to reach the Startup Manager, 
which lets you choose from the installed operating systems.

Virtualization Basics
	 Server-side virtualization happens on the server, and client-side virtualization happens on the client 
machine.
	 Three ways to implement client-side virtualization include presentation virtualization, application 
virtualization, and client-side desktop virtualization.
	 Virtualization is done by creating multiple virtual machines on a physical machine using a hypervisor.
	 A Type 1 hypervisor installs before any OS is installed and is called a bare-metal hypervisor. A Type 2 
hypervisor is an application that installs in an OS. A Type 1 hypervisor is faster and more secure than 
a Type 2 hypervisor.
Linux Operating System
	 Distributions of Linux provide a shell prompt in the Linux terminal and might also provide a desktop 
with a GUI. The default command-line shell for Linux is the Bash shell.

Key Terms
	 The root account in Linux has access to all features of the OS. When logged in to the root account, the 
user is called the superuser.
	 Important Linux commands include ls, grep, cd, shutdown, pwd, passwd, mv, cp, rm, mkdir, chmod, 
iwconfig, ifconfig, ps, q, su, sudo, apt-get, vi, and dd.
	 A missing GRUB sometimes happens after installing Windows in a dual boot when Linux has been 
previously installed.
	 Linux can access NTFS volumes created by Windows, but Windows cannot access ext4 volumes created 
by Linux unless third-party software is installed.
Mac OS X Operating System
	 OS X is the latest version of the proprietary operating system available only for Macintosh computers 
by Apple Inc. Like Linux, OS X is built on a UNIX foundation.
	 The dock appears at the bottom of the desktop. The icons in the dock that represent open applications 
have a small, black circle underneath them.
	 Spotlight is Mac’s search app, and can be configured to search the local computer, Wikipedia, iTunes, 
the Maps app, the web, and more.
	 For IT technicians, the most important tools in System Preferences are accessed through Time Machine, 
Users & Groups, and Sharing. Screen Sharing, one of the Sharing tools, works similarly to Remote 
Assistance in Windows.
	 OS X updates often address zero-day vulnerabilities, which makes these updates important to 
maintaining a healthy system.
	 Time Machine is a built-in backup utility that automatically backs up user-created data, applications, and 
system files onto an external hard drive attached either directly to the computer or through the local network.
	 Disk Utility can be used to repair disk permissions and to repair hard drive corruptions.
	 A kernel panic is similar to a BSOD in Windows. It might be caused by something simple, like a crashed 
app or a network communication issue, or it might result from a corrupted OS X installation.
	 Boot Camp is an OS X utility that allows you to install Windows on a Mac computer in a dual boot 
with OS X.

Real Problem 20-1 Using the Google Cloud Platform to Create a Ubuntu VM
Recall that Google Cloud Platform is an example of PaaS that you can use to learn a new operating system 
or develop apps. To use the service to create an Ubuntu VM, do the following:
1.		 Go to cloud.google.com and click Free Trial. You will need to sign in using a Google account. If you 
don’t have an account, you can create one with any valid email address.
2.		 In the Developers Console, create a new project. Then drill down into Compute, Compute Engine, and 
VM instances. Create a VM instance with Ubuntu 15.04 installed as the OS. Then wait several minutes 
for Google to create the instance.
3.		 Click the VM instances listed in your project. Buttons appear at the top of the window to manage 
the instance. Also note the External IP assigned to the VM instance. Click SSH and remote in to your 
VM using the SSH utility. The VM opens in a separate window where you can use Ubuntu commands 
(see Figure 20-63).
2.		 You need to use Repair Disk to repair the hard drive of a Mac computer. How should you reboot the 
computer?
a.	Open the Apple menu, then hold the shift key while clicking Restart.
b.	Reboot the computer. Press and hold the ? + r keys during boot.
c.	 Reboot the computer. Immediately after you hear the startup sound, press and hold the shift key.
d.	Reboot the computer. Press and hold the option key during boot.
3.		 Explain why most Linux commands work about the same on a Mac computer as they do on a Linux 
system. Research online and find three examples of Linux commands other than the ones presented in 
this chapter that also work in OS X Yosemite.

Real Problem 20-2 Sharing a Folder on the Network from a Mac Computer and Mapping the Drive on a Windows Computer
In the chapter, “Windows Resources on a Network,” you shared a folder on the network and mapped a 
network drive. These tasks can also be done in OS X, which makes it easier to share files between computers 
of various operating systems. Complete the following steps to set up a network share from a Mac computer:
1.		 Create a folder to share. Use Finder to create a subfolder in the Documents folder, and name the new 
folder MeetingMinutes.
2.		 Set sharing options. Open System Preferences and click Sharing. Select File Sharing in the sidebar and 
make sure it’s turned on. Click the Options button and make sure that Share files and folders using SMB 
is checked. Under Windows File Sharing, check the box to turn on file sharing with Windows computers. 
Enter the Mac’s user account password if necessary. Click Done.
3.		 Share the folder. Under Shared Folders, click the + button. Double-click the MeetingMinutes folder. 
Under Users, make sure the Everyone group is set to Read Only. Return to the System Preferences 
main window.
4.		 Enable shared folders for the guest account. Click Users & Groups. Click the lock icon in the lower-
left corner of the window so you can make changes to user settings, and sign in. Click the Guest User 
account in the sidebar. Check Allow guest users to connect to shared folders and return to the main 
System Preferences window.
5.		 Set a static IP address. Click Network, and then click Advanced. Click the TCP/IP tab. Configure the 
IPv4 address with a manual address as directed by your instructor. Click OK.
Notes When you set up your Google Cloud account, your credit card information was required. If you’re now done 
with your Google Cloud 60-day free trial, close your billing account so that your credit card will not be accidentally 
charged at the end of your free trial period. To do that, in the Developers Console, click the Settings cog icon and 
click Billing. Then click Close billing account.
Figure 20-64  Folder information includes the IP address of the remote 
computer and folder name
6.		 Map the network share on a 
Windows computer. You learned 
how to map a network drive in the 
chapter, “Windows Resources on a 
Network.” In the Folder box on the 
Map Network Drive window, enter 
the Mac’s IP address and the name 
of the shared folder, as shown in 
Figure 20-64, adjusting the specific 
details to your situation. Check 
Connect using different credentials, 
and click Finish. When asked for 
a user name and password, enter 
Guest for the user name and leave 
the password blank. Explorer 
should open a new window showing 
the mapped drive.

Windows computer? If not, troubleshoot and fix the problem. Create a file on the Windows computer 
and save it to the shared folder. Does the file appear in the shared folder on the Mac computer? What 
do you think went wrong? What setting do you need to change so you can add files to the shared 
folder from the Windows computer? Did it work? If not, troubleshoot and fix the problem.
8.		 Change share permissions. Currently the folder is shared with anyone on the network. This is fine 
in certain situations, but it’s not a best practice for most corporate networks. What changes can you 
make to restrict the shared folder to a single user? To a group of users?
9.		 Create a new user and a new group. List the steps to create a new user and a new user group on the 
Mac computer. What types of user accounts are available? What did you name the new user account and 
the new user group? Add both the new user and your own user account to the new group. Change the 
share settings on the MeetingMinutes folder so that the new user group has read and write privileges, 
and the Everyone group has Read Only privileges.
10.	 Take a screen shot and share it. With the Sharing window showing these new settings, take a screen 
shot. To do this, press  + shift + 4, then press the spacebar. Click the Sharing window to capture 
a screen shot of the window. Drag the screen shot file from the desktop to the shared folder. Email 
this screen shot to your instructor.

Measures and Properties of Electricity
In our modern world, we take electricity for granted, and we miss it terribly when it’s cut off. 
Nearly everyone depends on it, but few really understand it. A successful hardware technician 
is not one who tends to encounter failed processors, fried motherboards, smoking monitors, 
or frizzed hair. To avoid these excitements, you need to understand how to measure electricity 
and how to protect computer equipment from its damaging power.
Let’s start with the basics. To most people, volts, ohms, joules, watts, and amps are vague terms that simply 
mean electricity. All these terms can be used to measure some characteristic of electricity, as listed in Table A-1.
A+ 
220-902 
5.1, 5.2
Unit
Definition
Computer Example
Volt  
(for example, 115 V)
A measure of electrical force 
measured in volts. The symbol 
for volts is V.
A power supply steps down the voltage from 
the 115 V house current to 3.3, 5, and 12 V 
that computer components can use.
Amp or ampere  
(for example, 1.5 A)
An amp is a measure of electrical 
current. The symbol for amps is A.
An LCD monitor requires about 5 A to operate. 
A small laser printer uses about 2 A. An optical 
drive uses about 1 A.
Ohm  
(for example, 20 Ω)
An ohm is a measure of resistance to 
electricity. The symbol for ohm is Ω.
Current can flow in typical computer cables and 
wires with a resistance of near zero Ω (ohm).
Joule  
(for example, 500 J)
A measure of work or energy. One 
joule (pronounced “jewel”) is the 
work required to push an electrical 
current of 1 A through a resistance 
of 1 Ω. The symbol for joule is J.
A surge suppressor (see Figure A-1) is rated 
in joules—the higher the better. The rating 
determines how much work it can expend 
before it can no longer protect the circuit 
from a power surge.
Watt  
(for example, 20 W)
A measure of electrical power. One 
watt is one joule per second and 
measures the total electrical power 
needed to operate a device. Watts 
can be calculated by multiplying volts 
by amps. The symbol for watts is W.
The power consumption of an LCD computer 
monitor is rated at about 14 W. A DVD burner 
uses about 25 W when burning a DVD.

Measures and Properties of Electricity
A
Now let’s look at how electricity gets from one place to another and how it is used in house circuits and 
computers.
AC and DC
Electricity can be either AC, alternating current, or DC, direct current. Alternating current (AC) 
goes back and forth, or oscillates, rather than traveling in only one direction. House current in 
the United States is AC and oscillates 60 times in one second (60 hertz). Voltage in the system 
is constantly alternating from positive to negative, which causes the electricity to flow first in 
one direction and then in the other. Voltage alternates from +115 V to 115 V. AC is the most economical 
way to transmit electricity to our homes and workplaces. By decreasing current and increasing voltage, we 
can force alternating current to travel great distances. When alternating current reaches its destination, it is 
made more suitable for driving our electrical devices by decreasing voltage and increasing current.
Direct current (DC) travels in only one direction and is the type of current that most electronic devices 
require, including computers. A rectifier is a device that converts AC to DC, and an inverter is a device 
that converts DC to AC. A transformer is a device that changes the ratio of voltage to current. The power 
supply used in computers is both a rectifier and a transformer.
Large transformers reduce the high voltage on power lines coming to your neighborhood to a lower 
voltage before the current enters your home. The transformer does not change the amount of power in this 
closed system; if it decreases voltage, it increases current. The overall power stays constant, but the ratio of 
voltage to current changes, as illustrated in Figure A-2.
Notes To learn more about how volts, amps, ohms, joules, and watts measure the properties of electricity, see the 
content “Electricity and Multimeters” in the online content that accompanies this text at cengagebrain.com. To find out 
how to access this content, see the Preface to this text.

Figure A-2  A transformer keeps power constant but changes the ratio of

Direct current flows in only one direction. Think of electrical current like a current of water that flows 
from a state of high pressure to a state of low pressure or rest. Electrical current flows from a high-pressure 
state (called hot) to a state of rest (called ground or neutral). For a power supply, a power line may be 
either +5 or -5 volts in one circuit, or +12 or -12 volts in another circuit. The positive or negative value 
is determined by how the circuit is oriented, either on one side of the power output or the other. Several 
circuits coming from the power supply accommodate different devices with different power requirements.
Hot, Neutral, and Ground
AC travels on a hot line from the power station to a building and returns to the power station 
on a neutral line. When the two lines reach the building and enter an electrical device, such as 
a lamp, the device controls the flow of electricity between the hot and neutral lines. If an easier 
path (one with less resistance) is available, the electricity follows that path. This can cause a

Safety Procedures and Environmental Concerns
To prevent uncontrolled electricity in a short, the neutral line is grounded. Grounding a line means that 
the line is connected directly to the earth, so that, in the event of a short, the electricity flows into the earth 
and not back to the power station. Grounding serves as an escape route for out-of-control electricity because 
the earth is always capable of accepting a flow of current. With computers, a surge suppressor can be used 
to protect a computer and its components against power surges.
short, a sudden increase in flow that can also create a sudden increase in temperature—enough to start a 
fire and injure both people and equipment. Never put yourself in a position where you are the path of least 
resistance between the hot line and ground!
Caution
It’s very important that PC components be properly grounded. Never connect a PC to an outlet or use an 
extension cord that doesn’t have the third ground plug. The third line can prevent a short from causing extreme damage. 
In addition, the bond between the neutral and ground helps eliminate electrical noise (stray electrical signals) within the 
PC that is sometimes caused by other electrical equipment sitting very close to the computer.
Caution
Beware of the different uses of black wire. In desktop computers and in DC circuits, black is used for ground, 
but in home wiring and in AC circuits, black is used for hot!
The neutral line to your house is grounded many times along its way (in fact, at each electrical pole) and 
is also grounded at the breaker box where the electricity enters your house. You can look at a three-prong 
plug and see the three lines: hot, neutral, and ground (see Figure A-3).

Protecting Yourself
A
Now that you know about electricity, let’s turn our attention to protecting yourself against the dangers 
of electricity and other factors that might harm you as you work around computers.
Protecting Yourself
To protect yourself against electrical shock, when working with any electrical device, including 
computers, printers, scanners, and network devices, disconnect the power if you notice a 
dangerous situation that might lead to electrical shock or fire. When you disconnect the power, 
do so by pulling on the plug at the AC outlet. To protect the power cord, don’t pull on the cord 
itself. Also, don’t just turn off the on/off switch on the device; you need to actually disconnect the power. 
Note that any of the following can indicate a potential danger:
	 The power cord is frayed or otherwise damaged in any way.
	 Water or other liquid is on the floor around the device or spilled on it.
	 The device has been exposed to excess moisture.
	 The device has been dropped or you notice physical damage.
	 You smell a strong electronics odor.
	 The power supply or fans are making a whining noise.
	 You notice smoke coming from the computer case or the case feels unusually warm.
Safely Work Inside Computers, Printers, and Other Electrical Devices
To personally stay safe, always do the following, before working inside computers, printers, 
and other electrical devices:
  Remove jewelry. Remove your jewelry that might come in contact with components. Jewelry 
is made of metal and might conduct electricity if it touches a component. It can also get caught 
in cables and cords inside computer cases.
	 Power down the system and unplug it. For a computer, unplug the power, monitor, mouse, and keyboard 
cables, and any other peripherals or cables attached and move them out of your way.
	 For a computer, press and hold down the power button for a moment. After you unplug the computer, 
press the power button for about three seconds to completely drain the power supply. Sometimes when 
you do so, you’ll hear the fans quickly start and go off as residual power is drained. Only then is it safe 
to work inside the case.
Electrical Fire Safety
Never use water to put out a fire fueled by electricity because water is a conductor and you 
might get a severe electrical shock. A computer lab needs a fire extinguisher that is rated to put 
out electrical fires. Fire extinguishers are rated by the type of fires they put out:
  Class A extinguishers can use water to put out fires caused by wood, paper, and other 
combustibles.
	 Class B extinguishers can put out fires caused by liquids such as gasoline, kerosene, and oil.
	 Class C fire extinguishers use nonconductive chemicals to put out a fire caused by electricity. 
See Figure A-4.
Notes House AC voltage in the United States is about 110–120 V, but know that in other countries, this is not 
always the case. In many other countries, the standard is 220 V. Outlet styles also vary from one country to the next.

Proper Use of Cleaning Pads and Solutions
As a support technician, you’ll find yourself collecting different cleaning solutions and cleaning 
pads to clean a variety of devices, including the mouse and keyboard, CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray 
discs and their drives, tapes and tape drives, and monitors. Figure A-5 shows a few of these 
products. For example, the contact cleaner in the figure is used to clean the contacts on the 
edge connectors of expansion cards; the cleaning can solve a problem with a faulty connection.

Protecting Yourself
A
Most of these cleaning solutions contain flammable and poisonous materials. Take care when using them 
so that they don’t get on your skin or in your eyes. To find out what to do if you are accidentally exposed 
to a dangerous solution, look on the instructions printed on the can or check out the material safety data 
sheet (see Figure A-6). A material safety data sheet (MSDS) explains how to properly handle substances 
such as chemical solvents and how to dispose of them.
An MSDS includes information such as 
physical data, toxicity, health effects, first aid, 
storage, shipping, disposal, and spill procedures. 
It comes packaged with the chemical; you can 
order one from the manufacturer, or you can find 
one on the Internet (see www.ilpi.com/msds).
If you have an accident with these or other 
dangerous products, your company or organization 
might require you to report the accident to your 
company and/or fill out an incident report. Check 
with your organization to find out how to handle 
reporting these types of incidents.
Figure A-6  Each chemical you use should have a material 
safety data sheet available
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam expects 
you to know how to use MSDS documentation to find 
out how to dispose of chemicals so as to help protect 
the environment. You also need to know that you 
must follow all local government regulations when 
disposing of chemicals and other materials dangerous 
to the environment.
Managing Cables
People can trip over cables or cords left on the floor, so be careful that cables are in a safe 
place. If you must run a cable across a path or where someone sits, use a cable or cord cover 
that can be nailed or screwed to the floor. Don’t leave loose cables or cords in a traffic area 
where people can trip over them (called a trip hazard).
Lifting Heavy Objects
Back injury, caused by lifting heavy objects, is one of the most common injuries that happen 
at work. Whenever possible, put heavy objects, such as a large laser printer, on a cart to move 
them. If you do need to lift a heavy object, follow these guidelines to keep from injuring your 
back:
1.	Looking at the object, decide which side of the object to face so that the load is the most balanced.
2.	Stand close to the object with your feet apart.
3.	Keeping your back straight, bend your knees and grip the load.
4.	Lift with your legs, arms, and shoulders, and not with your back or stomach.
5.	Keep the load close to your body and avoid twisting your body while you’re holding it.
6.	To put the object down, keep your back as straight as you can and lower the object by bending your knees.
Don’t try to lift an object that is too heavy for you. Because there are no exact guidelines for when heavy 
is too heavy, use your best judgment as to when to ask for help.

Safety Procedures and Environmental Concerns
Safety Goggles and Air Filter Mask
If you are required to work in an environment such as a factory where flying fragments, chips, or 
other particles are about, your employer might require you wear safety goggles to protect your 
eyes. In addition, if the air is filled with dust or other contaminants, your employer might require 
you to wear an air-purifying respirator, commonly called an air filter mask, which filters the dust 
and other contaminants from the air you breathe. If safety goggles or a mask is required, your employer is 
responsible for providing you one that is appropriate for the environment in which you are working.
Protecting the Equipment
As you learn to troubleshoot and solve computer problems, you gradually begin to realize 
that many problems you face could have been avoided by good computer maintenance that 
includes protecting the computer against environmental factors such as humidity, dust, and 
out-of-control electricity.
Protect the Equipment Against Static Electricity or ESD
Suppose you come indoors on a cold day, pick up a comb, and touch your hair. Sparks fly! 
What happened? Static electricity caused the sparks. Electrostatic discharge (ESD), commonly 
known as static electricity, is an electrical charge at rest. When you came indoors, this charge 
built up on your hair and had no place to go. An ungrounded conductor (such as wire that is 
not touching another wire) or a nonconductive surface (such as your hair) holds a charge until the charge 
is released. When two objects with dissimilar electrical charges touch, electricity passes between them until 
the dissimilar charges become equal.
To see static charges equalizing, turn off the lights in a room, scuff your feet on the carpet, and touch 
another person. Occasionally, you can see and feel the charge in your fingers. If you can feel the charge, 
you discharged at least 1500 volts of static electricity. If you hear the discharge, you released at least 
6000 volts. If you see the discharge, you released at least 8000 volts of ESD. A charge of only 10 volts 
can damage electronic components! You can touch a chip on an expansion card or motherboard, damage 
the chip with ESD, and never feel, hear, or see the electrical discharge.
ESD can cause two types of damage in an electronic component: catastrophic failure and upset failure. 
A catastrophic failure destroys the component beyond use. An upset failure damages the component so that 
it does not perform well, even though it may still function to some degree. Upset failures are more difficult 
to detect because they are not consistent and not easily observed. Both types of failures permanently affect 
the device. Components are easily damaged by ESD, but because the damage might not show up for weeks 
or months, a technician is likely to get careless and not realize the damage he or she is doing.
Caution
Unless you are measuring power levels with a multimeter or power supply tester, never, ever touch a component 
or cable inside a computer case while the power is on. The electrical voltage is not enough to seriously hurt you but more than 
enough to permanently damage the component.
Before touching or handling a component (for example, a hard drive, motherboard, expansion card, 
processor, or memory modules), to protect it against ESD, always ground yourself first. You can ground 
yourself and the computer parts by using one or more of the following static control devices or methods:
	 ESD strap. An ESD strap, also called a ground bracelet, antistatic wrist strap, or ESD bracelet, is a strap 
you wear around your wrist. The strap has a cord attached with an alligator clip on the end. Attach the clip 
to the computer case you’re working on, as shown in Figure A-7. Any static electricity between you and the 
case is now discharged. Therefore, as you work inside the case, you will not damage the components with 
static electricity. The bracelet also contains a resistor that prevents electricity from harming you.

	 Ground mats. A ground mat, also called an ESD mat, dissipates ESD and is commonly used by bench 
technicians (also called depot technicians) who repair and assemble computers at their workbenches or 
in an assembly line. Ground mats have a connector in one corner that you can use to connect the mat 
to the ground (see Figure A-8). If you lift a component off the mat, it is no longer grounded and is 
susceptible to ESD, so it’s important to use an ESD strap with a ground mat.
Figure A-7  A ground bracelet, which protects computer components from ESD, can clip to the 
side of the computer case and eliminate ESD between you and the case
Caution
When working on a laser printer, don’t wear the ESD strap because you don’t want to be the ground for 
these high-voltage devices.

	 Static shielding bags. New components come shipped in static shielding bags, also called antistatic 
bags. These bags are a type of Faraday cage, named after Michael Faraday, who built the first cage in 
1836. A Faraday cage is any device that protects against an electromagnetic field. Save the bags to store

other devices that are not currently installed in a computer. As you work on a computer, know that 
a device is not protected from ESD if you place it on top of the bag; the protection is inside the bag 
(see Figure A-9).
Figure A-9  An antistatic bag help protect components from ESD
Caution
A CRT monitor can also damage components with ESD. Don’t place or store expansion cards on top of or 
next to a CRT monitor, which can discharge as much as 29,000 volts onto the screen.
The best way to guard against ESD is to use an ESD strap together with a ground mat. Consider an ESD 
strap essential equipment when working on a computer. However, if you are in a situation in which you 
must work without one, touch the computer case or the power supply before you touch a component in 
the case, which is called self-grounding. Self-grounding dissipates any charge between you and whatever 
you touch. Here are some rules that can help protect computer parts against ESD:
	 Rule 1: When passing a circuit board, memory module, or other sensitive component to another person, 
ground yourself and then touch the other person before you pass the component.
	 Rule 2: Leave components inside their protective bags until you are ready to use them.
	 Rule 3: Work on hard floors, not carpet, or use antistatic spray on the carpets.
	 Rule 4: Don’t work on a computer if you or the computer have just come in from the cold because there 
is more danger of ESD when the atmosphere is cold and dry.
	 Rule 5: When unpacking hardware or software, remove the packing tape and cellophane from the work 
area as soon as possible because these materials attract ESD.
	 Rule 6: Keep components away from your hair and clothing.
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220-901 exam emphasizes that you should know how to protect computer equipment as you 
work on it, including how to protect components against damage from ESD.

Protecting the Equipment
A
Physically Protect Your Equipment from the Environment
When you protect equipment from ongoing problems with the environment, you are likely to 
have fewer problems later, and the less troubleshooting and repair you will have to do. Here is 
how you can physically protect a computer:
  Protect a computer against dust and other airborne particles. When a computer must sit in 
a dusty environment, around those who smoke, or where pets might leave hair, you can:
	 Use a plastic keyboard cover to protect the keyboard. When the computer is turned off, cover the 
entire system with a protective cover or enclosure.
	 Install air filters over the front or side vents of the case where air flows into the case. Put your 
hand over the case of a running computer to feel where the air flows in. For most systems, air 
flows in from the front vents or vents on the side of the case that is near the processor cooler. 
The air filter shown in Figure A-10 has magnets that hold the filter to the case when screw holes 
are not available.
Practice Handling Computer Components
Working with a partner, you’ll need some computer parts and the antistatic tools you learned about in this part 
of the chapter. Practice touching, picking up, and passing the parts between you. As you do so, follow the rules 
to protect the parts against ESD. Have a third person watch as you work and point out any ways you might have 
exposed a part to ESD. As you work, be careful to not touch components on circuit boards or the gold fingers on 
the edge connector of an expansion card. When you are finished, store the parts in antistatic bags.
Hands-On  Project A-1
Figure A-10  This air filter is designed to fit over a case fan, power 
supply fan, or panel vent on the case
	 Whenever you have the case cover open, be sure to use compressed air or an antistatic vacuum 
(see Figure A-11) to remove dust from inside the case. Figure A-12 shows a case fan that jammed 
because of dust and caused a system to overheat. And while you’re cleaning up dust, don’t forget 
to blow or vacuum out the keyboard.

Safety Procedures and Environmental Concerns
	 Allow for good ventilation inside and outside the system. Proper air circulation is essential to keeping 
a system cool. Don’t block air vents on the front and rear of the computer case or on the monitor. 
Inside the case, make sure cables are tied up and out of the way so as to allow for airflow and not 
obstruct fans from turning. Put covers on expansion slot openings on the rear of the case and put face-
plates over empty bays on the front of the case. Don’t set a tower case directly on thick carpet because 
the air vent on the bottom front of the case can be blocked. If you are concerned about overheating, 
monitor temperatures inside and outside the case.
Notes When working at a customer site, be sure to clean up any mess you created by blowing dust out of a computer 
case or keyboard.

Protecting the Equipment
A
A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220–901 exam expects you to know how to keep computers and monitors well ventilated 
and to use protective enclosures and air filters to protect the equipment from airborne particles.
	 High temperatures and humidity can be dangerous for hard drives. I once worked in a basement with 
PCs, and hard drives failed much too often. After we installed dehumidifiers, the hard drives became 
more reliable. If you suspect a problem with humidity, you can use a hygrometer to monitor the 
humidity in a room. High temperatures can also damage computer equipment, and you should take 
precautions to not allow a computer to overheat.
Notes A server room where computers stay and people generally don’t stay for long hours is set to balance what is 
good for the equipment and to conserve energy. Low temperature and moderate humidity are best for the equipment, 
although no set standards exist for either. Temperatures might be set from 65 to 70 degrees F, and humidity between 
30 percent and 50 percent, although some companies keep their server rooms at 80 degrees F to conserve energy. A data 
center where both computers and people stay is usually kept at a comfortable temperature and humidity for humans.
	 Protect electrical equipment from power surges. Lightning and other electrical power surges can destroy 
computers and other electrical equipment. If the house or office building does not have surge protection 
equipment installed at the breaker box, be sure to install a protective device at each computer. The least 
expensive device is a power strip that is also a surge suppressor, although you might want to use a UPS 
for added protection.
	
	
Lightning can also get to your equipment across network cabling coming in through an Internet 
connection. To protect against lightning, use a surge suppressor such as the one shown in Figure A-13 
in line between the ISP device (for example, a DSL modem or cable modem) and the computer or home 
router to protect it from spikes across the network cables. Notice the cord on the surge suppressor, 
which connects it to ground.
Figure A-13  Surge protector by APC for Ethernet lines
An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is a device that raises the voltage when it drops during brownouts 
or sags (temporary voltage reductions). A UPS also does double-duty as a surge suppressor to protect the 
system against power surges or spikes. In addition, a UPS can serve as a battery backup to provide power 
for a brief time during a total blackout long enough for you to save your work and shut down the system.

Appendix A
1034
Safety Procedures and Environmental Concerns
A UPS is not as essential for a laptop computer as it is for a desktop because a laptop has a battery that 
can sustain it during a blackout.
A common UPS device is a rather heavy box that plugs into an AC outlet and provides one or more 
outlets for the computer and the monitor (see Figure A-14). It has an on/off switch, requires no maintenance, 
and is very simple to install. Use it to provide uninterruptible power to your desktop computer and monitor. 
It’s best not to connect it to nonessential devices such as a laser printer or scanner.
Figure A-14  Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
Notes Whenever a power outage occurs, unless you have a reliable power conditioner installed at the breaker box 
in your house or building, unplug all power cords to the computers, printers, monitors, and the like. Sometimes when 
the power returns, sudden spikes are accompanied by another brief outage. You don’t want to subject your equipment 
to these surges. When buying a surge suppressor, look for those that guarantee against damage from lightning and that 
reimburse for equipment destroyed while the surge suppressor is in use.
Safely Clean Computer Equipment
Practice some preventive maintenance tasks by following these steps to clean a computer:
1.	 Shut down the computer and unplug it. Press the power button to drain power.
2.	 Clean the keyboard, monitor, and mouse. For a wheel mouse, remove the ball and clean the wheels. Clean the 
outside of the computer case. Don’t forget to clean the mouse pad.
3.	 Open the case and using a ground bracelet, clean the dust from the case. Make sure all fans move freely.
4.	 Verify the cables are out of the way of airflow. Use cable ties as necessary.
5.	 Check that each expansion card and memory module is securely seated in its slot.
6.	 Power up the system and make sure all is working.
7.	 Clean up around your work area. If you left dust on the floor as you blew it out of the computer case, 
be sure to clean it up.

Protecting the Environment
IT support technicians need to be aware that we can do damage to the environment if we 
carelessly dispose of used computer equipment improperly. As a support technician, one day 
you’re sure to face an assortment of useless equipment and consumables (see Figure A-15). 
Before you decide to trash it all, take a moment and ask yourself if some of the equipment can 
be donated or at least recycled. Think about fixing up an old computer and donating it to a needy middle 
school student. If you don’t have the time for that, consider donating to the local computer repair class. 
The class can fix the computers up as a class project and donate them to young students.
Figure A-15  Keep, trash, recycle, or donate?
When disposing of any type of equipment or consumables, make sure to comply with local government 
environmental regulations. Table A-2 lists some items and how to dispose of them.
Part
How to Dispose
Alkaline batteries, including AAA, 
AA, A, C, D, and 9-volt
Dispose of these batteries in the regular trash. First check to see if there are 
recycling facilities in your area.
Button batteries used in 
digital cameras and other small 
equipment; battery packs used in 
notebooks
These batteries can contain silver oxide, mercury, lithium, or cadmium and are 
considered toxic waste that require special toxic waste handling. Dispose of 
them by returning them to the original dealer or by taking them to a recycling 
center. To recycle, pack them separately from other items. If you don’t have a 
recycling center nearby, contact your county for local regulations for disposal.
Laser printer toner cartridges
Return these to the manufacturer or dealer to be recycled.
Ink-jet printer cartridges, 
computer cases, power supplies, 
and other computer parts, 
monitors, chemical solvents, and 
their containers
Check with local county or environmental officials for laws and regulations in 
your area for proper disposal of these items. The county might have a recycling 
center that will receive them. Discharge a CRT monitor before disposing of it. 
See the MSDS documents for chemicals to know how to dispose of them.
Storage media such as hard drives, 
CDs, DVDs, and BDs
Do physical damage to the device so it is not possible for sensitive data to be 
stolen. Then the device can be recycled or put in the trash. Your organization 
might be required to meet legal requirements to destroy data. If so, make sure 
you understand these requirements and how to comply with them.

A+ Exam Tip
The A+ 220–901 exam expects you to know to follow environmental guidelines to dispose of 
batteries, laser printer toner, and CRT monitors, chemical solvents, and containers. If you’re not certain how to dispose 
of a product, see its MSDS document.
Be sure a CRT monitor is discharged before you dispose of it. Most CRT monitors are designed to 
discharge after sitting unplugged for 60 minutes. It can be manually discharged by using a high-voltage 
probe with the monitor case opened. Ask a technician trained to service monitors to do this for you.
Notes Go to www.youtube.com and search on “discharge a CRT monitor” to see some interesting videos that demonstrate 
the charge inside a monitor long after the monitor is turned off and unplugged. As for proper procedures, I’m not endorsing 
all these videos; just watch for fun.
Research Disposal Rules
Research the laws and regulations in your community concerning the disposal of batteries and old computer parts. 
Answer these questions regarding your community:
1.	 How do you properly dispose of a monitor?
2.	 How do you properly dispose of a battery pack used by a notebook computer?
3.	 How do you properly dispose of a large box of assorted computer parts, including hard drives, optical drives, 
computer cases, and circuit boards?
