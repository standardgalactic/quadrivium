Introduction

1 Preface
This textbook provides you with an overview of the methods to analyse and
predict the dynamic motion of point masses and rigid bodies in the two-
dimensional plane based on Newton’s laws. The book is aimed at ﬁrst-year
bachelor students in science and engineering. The recommended prerequisite
knowledge for the textbook includes high-school physics, basic calculus (di↵er-
entiation and integration), vector algebra, linear ordinary di↵erential equations,
and knowledge of statics. Furthermore, the gradient is introduced from vector
calculus. Most concepts are brieﬂy introduced, such that this textbook might
in principle also be used by readers without this prerequisite knowledge.
In case you spot errors, inaccuracies or if you have other suggestions to
improve this textbook it would be highly appreciated if you send your feedback
to p.g.steeneken@tudelft.nl.
1.1 Guidelines for studying dynamics
This textbook aims to bring you basic understanding of dynamics and provide
an engineering toolbox by which you can solve many problems in dynamics,
both analytically and numerically. However, it is important to learn how to
use this toolbox to apply it in new situations. The only way to learn this
well is to solve problems. For this reason, it is very important, after having
studied a part of the textbook, to practice solving problems yourself. Always
ﬁrst try to solve the problem yourself before looking at the solution, since you
learn much more by ﬁnding the solution yourself, even if that costs more time.
Getting stuck in solving a problem is probably the experience from which you
learn the most. It points out what parts you don’t understand well enough,
encourages you to study those parts better by reading the book or looking at
similar examples, and after solving the problem the experience will ensure you
will not easily forget how to solve similar problems. So, don’t give up too early
or look at the solution, if you persist you often will manage.
Besides teaching you the basics of dynamics, an important aim of this
textbook is to teach you to get rid of ’bad habits’ you might have acquired in
high school by implementing the following guidelines:

14
1 PREFACE
1. Work with equations instead of ﬁlling in numerical values while
analysing a problem. The aim is to learn how to solve problems with
equations instead of ﬁlling in numbers at an early stage. Not only are you
more likely to make errors when ﬁlling in numbers, it is also much harder
to detect those errors afterwards (e.g. by checking units). Moreover,
when having an equation as solution, it has a larger degree of validity and
can be used to predict trends and optimise designs. Only ﬁll in numbers
after having reached the ﬁnal equation.
2. Work with vectors instead of scalars. A position, force, moment,
velocity or acceleration in 2 or 3 dimensional space is always a vector.
Therefore you should initially always use vector notation in 2D and 3D,
and only work with scalar values when appropriate, e.g. after having
projected the vectors on a coordinate axis. Correct vector usage and
notation will become increasingly important when you progress with your
studies, so best get used to it early. Note that most problems in this
book will focus on motion in the 2-dimensional xy-plane. Nevertheless,
even in that case moment and angular velocity vectors point along the
z direction. Moreover, most vector equations that are presented in this
textbook will still be valid in 3D, unless they have a subscript 2D.
3. Using a structured approach instead of jumping to conclusions
too soon. In the analysis of dynamic systems, we will not assume
anything, but use structured procedures to solve problems. For example,
if a mass moves over a surface, we will not jump to the conclusion that
the upward normal force equals the weight of the mass (which is not
always the case for a curved surface), but determine the normal force
from Newton’s laws.
4. Solve problems based on understanding, instead of by memoris-
ing example problems, and copying the methodology without
understanding how it works. Although this memorising and solving
many standard problems might seem e↵ective for passing exams, it will
leave you helpless when you encounter a problem that you did not see
before. Therefore, focus on building understanding and ask questions if
things are not clear.
This textbook aims to form a bridge between high-school physics and aca-
demic literature, providing more rigorousness and insight into the material.
Available textbooks are often either too advanced and complex, or do not o↵er
suﬃcient depth, insight or rigorousness in my view. This textbook provides a
solid basis in dynamics of which I hope that it will help you to bridge the gap
towards understanding more advanced academic books and articles.

1.2 TOPICS

1.2 Topics
The outline of the topics that will be discussed in this textbook is as follows:
1. Introduction, elemental concepts, forces, vectors and mathematics
2. Dynamics of point masses
a) Kinematics
b) Kinetics
c) Work and energy
d) Impulse and momentum
3. Dynamics of rigid bodies
a) Kinematics
b) Kinetics
c) Work and energy
d) Angular impulse and momentum
4. Vibrations
5. Solution strategy dynamics
Although all equations and theory will be derived and presented for motion
in 3D space (unless speciﬁcally indicated otherwise for special cases), most
examples and problems will focus on point masses and rigid bodies moving in a
2D plane. The dynamics of deformable objects will not be part of the textbook.
Several section headings are marked with a * at the end of the section title,
to indicate that the main text can be followed without reading these parts
because they contain derivations or background information. The following
introductory chapters might be skipped if they are already familiar. The core
of the textbook starts in Ch. 5.
1.3 Text structure
In this textbook, the techniques and models that scientists and engineers need
to design and analyse dynamical systems will be introduced step by step,
starting from Newton’s laws. Eventually at the end of the textbook we will
have discussed a toolbox of equations and techniques that can be valuable for
your future career.
The text consists of di↵erent parts:
1. Descriptions and explanations
2. Derivations of key equations and concepts

16
1 PREFACE
3. Concepts and techniques in dynamics
4. Practical examples, and sample problems that illustrate the use of these
techniques
Although derivations of equations might be skipped without following the
main line of the textbook, it is highly recommended to read them, since they do
provide more insight into the theory and demonstrate beautifully how Newton’s
laws, despite their simplicity, can account for a tremendous set of complex
phenomena in dynamics.
To highlight important concepts, they are introduced like this:
Concept. Principle of linear impulse and momentum
X
j
mj~vj (t1) +
X
i,j
Z t2
t1
~F i,jdt =
X
j
mj~vj (t2)
(1.1)
Similarly, derivations are marked like this:
Derivation. We will here derive the principle of impulse and momentum from
Newton’s laws.
Examples to illustrate how to apply the concepts and techniques are pro-
vided in an example environment, with the letter in front of the exam-
ple indicating the diﬃculty level (S: simple, M: medium and A: advanced).
S Example 1.1 We consider the following example situation.
Exemplary solution
The dynamics of this system can be solved as follows.
Problems are included in these notes as follows:

2 Notation, Math, and Engineering
Basics
This chapter will discuss notation conventions, unit usage, signiﬁcant digits
and repeat mathematical background knowledge that will be needed to follow
this textbook.
2.1 Notation
In this section we discuss the used notation, labelling and typesetting in this
textbook. Sec. 2.1 and Sec. 2.2 are an adaptation of the text of Vallery and
Schwab [9].
2.1.1 Typesetting of scalars, vectors, and matrices
There are several ways to typeset scalars, vectors, unit vectors, and matrices
as depicted in Table 2.1. In particular for vectors and unit vectors there are
multiple methods applied. Although in many works vectors are only written
with boldface italics, it is hard to clearly write a boldface letter in handwriting.
Therefore we here use a combination of boldface and vector arrow above
the letter for clarity and similarity to the handwritten vector. Similarly, for
unit vectors (vectors with a magnitude of 1), we use a boldface letter with
a hat ˆ above it. All variables are italics, also if they appear in subscripts
or superscripts. Matrices are non-italic and also names and texts in sub or
superscripts are non-italic except if they are single letters[8].

2 NOTATION, MATH, AND ENGINEERING BASICS
2.1.2 Quantities, labels and subscripts
In this textbook we generally follow the guidelines set out in the Red Book
[2]. To label objects or points we either use letters like A, B, . . ., numbers
i = 1, 2, . . . or short words like rope or ball. For adding extra information
and distinguishing quantities, we can add subscripts like in mrope and mball.
Multiple labels can be separated in the subscript by commas. Italic integer
variables, like i in Fi (with i = 1, 2, . . .) can indicate that multiple quantities
F1, F2, . . . exist, each with a di↵erent value of i. Although labels are not always
essential, make sure to always use suﬃcient labels to uniquely identify each
quantity. So, if there is only one mass in your problem, it is ﬁne to just m to
identify it. However, if there are two point-masses, subscripts mA and mB are
needed for unique identiﬁcation. With an axis coordinate as a subscript, like x
in Fx, we indicate a projection of a vector ~F along the x-axis.
A special notation for relative position, velocity and acceleration vectors is
used (see also Sec. 3.1.2). A position vector that points to a point A from a
point P will be denoted as ~rA/P = ~rA −~r/P , which reads: “position of A with
respect to P”. Analogous notation will be used for other relative quantities,
such as angles, velocities and accelerations (see Sec. 3.1).
For components of 3-dimensional vectors, there are three possible ways of
notation of which we will usually use the last one because it is the shortest to
write:
~r =
0
@
rx
ry
rz
1
A =
'
rx
ry
rz
(T = rxˆı + ryˆ| + rzˆk.
(2.1)
The superscript T indicates the transpose of the vector (or matrix), and is
sometimes used to convert the column vector to a row vector to save space.
For components of m-dimensional vectors, one can also use the index notation,
with unit vectors written like ˆe1 = ˆı, which has the advantage that it can be
written even more compactly as a sum:
~r =
0

2.2 WORKING WITH UNITS
21
Note that in dynamics, we use Newton’s notation (also called dot notation
or ﬂuxions) for time derivatives, indicating them by a dot above the variable:
˙x = dx
dt
(2.4)
¨x = d2x
dt2
(2.5)
In mathematics the prime symbol 0 is often used for derivatives like f0 = df
dx.
In dynamics it is advisable not to use the prime symbol to avoid confusion, and
instead clearly indicate with respect to what variable the derivative is taken e.g.
df
dx or df
ds . Also clearly indicate if it is a total derivative df
dx or partial derivative
@f
@x.
In this textbook the prime symbol 0 will not be used for derivatives
but is sometimes used as a label. Finally, when making multiplications of
scalar quantities, both · and ⇥are used, such that a · b = a ⇥b. For vectors
these symbols indicate the dot and cross product which clearly are di↵erent:
~a · ~b 6= ~a ⇥~b.
2.2 Working with units
There are several rules when working with units that are not always obvious,
and sometimes not correctly applied, even in standard textbooks. Errors
with units have led to serious confusions and accidents like the collapse of a
Mars orbiter and an aeroplane running out of fuel in mid-air. It is therefore
important for every engineer to be able to correctly work with units and we
repeat the most important rules here.
In mechanics, we often deal with scalar variables that represent physical
quantities that have a measurement unit, like forces, velocities, or positions.
Scalar variables consist of the product of two elements: a number and a
measurement unit.
S Example 2.1 Force can be expressed as the product of a numerical value and
the measurement unit newton: F = 3 · N = 3 N.
Following the ISO norm [5] and the “Red Book” [2], for quantities that have a
measurement unit, the numerical value of a scalar variable Q that represents
such quantities is denoted by {Q}, and the measurement unit is denoted by
[Q], such that
Q = {Q} · [Q].
(2.6)

22
2 NOTATION, MATH, AND ENGINEERING BASICS
S Example 2.2 A mass m = 3.5 kg has the numerical value {m} = 3.5 and the
unit [m] = kg. The same quantity value can be expressed as 3500 g. Then, the
numerical value is {m} = 3500, and [m] = g.
Note that square brackets only have meaning when placed around the physical
quantity. For axes labels one commonly uses round brackets [4, 8] around
the unit like for a time axis: t (s). Another option [1] is to use division: t/s.
Generally, the letters of units are printed in roman (upright), those of scalar
variables in italic.
S Example 2.3 For time t,
good use is: t = 4 s, t = 4 (s), t/s = 4, or [t] = s,
not good use is: ⇠⇠⇠⇠
XXXX
t = 4 [s], or ⇢⇢
ZZ
t [s]. Besides paying attention to the units, also you
need to make sure that if you have a vector on the left side of the = sign, you also
need to have a vector on the right side.
From Eq. (2.6) it can be seen that every scalar equation in mechanics can be
split into two equations, one for the numerical values, and one for the units.
For example, an equation like F = ma, with F = 1 N, m = 1 kg and a = 1 m/s2
can be split into:
F
=
m · a
(2.7)
{F}[F]
=
{m}[m] · {a}[a]
(2.8)
{F}
=
{m} · {a} ! 1 = 1 · 1
(2.9)
[F]
=
[m] · [a] ! N = kg · m/s2
(2.10)
When making a calculation it is important that in the end result both the
numerical values and the units are correct since obviously, in equations, the
units on both sides of the equal sign need to be identical, otherwise the equality
can never hold. Normally, the units automatically work out well if you work
with SI units. In some cases, one has to deal with equations like a = c1t2. In
that case the unit of the constant c1 is not given, but can be obtained from
the equation [a] = [c1][t2], which can be written as m/s2 = [c1] · s2, from which
it follows that the unit of c1 is: [c1] = m/s4.
A general advice is to work as long as possible with variables, and only to
substitute numbers and units in the ﬁnal solution. Units almost always help as
a part of plausibility checks for calculations. Moreover, writing the numerical
value and unit in each step of the derivation is much more work, and errors in
numerical values are harder to ﬁnd than in equations.
In this textbook we mostly work with the International System of Units,
also called SI units, the SI system, or metric units, which are the world’s most
widely used system of measurement. If you have to work with non-SI units, as

2.2 WORKING WITH UNITS
23
a habit ﬁrst convert it to the SI unit as a ﬁrst step to prevent problems later
on. Often this conversion is just a matter of multiplying the non-SI unit value
by a constant factor, e.g. 1.0 inch = 1.0 inch ⇥0.0254 m/inch, however in some
cases the conversion is more complex, like when converting temperature in
Fahrenheit to degrees Kelvin. Preferably also work in the base SI unit, remove
any factors related to preﬁxes (like converting mm to m by dividing by a factor
1000) before starting calculations, using scientiﬁc notation (e.g. 3.02 ⇥108) for
very large or small values.
There are 7 base SI units, and the only base SI units relevant in this textbook
are m, s and kg. There are 22 derived SI units of which we use 6 in this textbook:
the rad = m/m, Hz = 1/s, N = kg m/s2, Pa = N/m2, J = Nm, and W = J/s.
The unit to use for a certain quantity or parameter can often be determined by
evaluating known dynamics equations. As an example, since x has unit m and
t has unit s, we can use the equation for acceleration a = d2x
dt2 to determine that
acceleration a has the unit m/s2 (note how the square sign 2 is placed behind
the t but before the x in the second derivative notation). Similarly, one obtains
from F = m ⇥a that 1 N = 1 kg ⇥1 m/s2 = 1 kg m/s2. This method can often
help to ﬁnd the right unit by using a known equation, such that units don’t
have to be memorised. Keep in mind that the equations in this textbook only
work correctly if one uses SI units or units derived from SI units (like N or W).
In some cases the scalar variable represents a unitless quantity. Examples
of unitless quantities are integer numbers (for example the number of wheels
under a car) or ratios of quantities with the same unit (for example the ratio of
two distances). Most mathematical functions, like trigonometric or logarithmic
functions, only accept unitless quantities. For example there is no mathematical
way to calculate tan(1 m). So, always make sure only unitless numbers or ratios
are used. E.g. log(x2/x1) is ﬁne, but log(x2) cannot be calculated if [x2] = m.
It is important to note that additions and subtractions can only be performed
between scalar quantities of the same unit, while multiplications, divisions and
powers can be taken on quantities of di↵erent units as long as the operation is
also applied to the respective units.
A special case are angles, even though they usually have degrees ◦or rad
behind them, these angle designations are actually unitless numbers, which
measure e.g. the ratio of the length of a circular arc divided by the length of the
perimeter of a full circle. The degree or radian symbol only indicates how the
trigonometric function should be applied. When not otherwise speciﬁed in this
textbook we work with radians. Since angles are unitless, most mathematical
functions can accept angles as an argument.
When dealing with vectors, one also needs to specify the direction of the
vector using one or more unit vectors, so for specifying a vector one uses

24
2 NOTATION, MATH, AND ENGINEERING BASICS
the product of a number, a measurement unit and at least one unit vector.
Subtraction and addition is only possible for vectors with the same unit, scalar
products are possible as long as the units are also multiplied, so for instance
~v ⇥t = ∆~x is a correct equation, because m/s ⇥s = m and because quantities
on both sides of the = sign are vectors.
Expressions and equations may contain mixtures of quantities given with
their numerical value and quantities given as variables. In all cases one needs
to ensure that the units on both sides of the equal sign = are equal, and that
one cannot equate a scalar to a vector or matrix. If a vector quantity evaluates
to zero one we use the zero vector ~0, which is a vector with magnitude zero
and no direction.
S Example 2.4
For a particle of mass m = 3 kg having acceleration vector
~a = 1 m/s2ˆı, the resultant force vector ~F on the particle can be calculated as:
Correct is: ~F = m~a = 3 kg ⇥1 m/s2ˆı = 3 kg m/s2ˆı = 3 Nˆı.
Incorrect is: (((((
(
hhhhh
h
~F = 3 · ~a N, because the vector ~a has unit m/s2 such that the units on
both side of the equal sign are di↵erent.
S Problem 2.1 A particle performs a harmonic oscillation, such that its location
coordinate x is a function of amplitude x0, angular frequency ⌦, and time t:
x = x0 sin(⌦t).
(2.11)
Fill in suitable units for x, x0, ⌦, and t and check the equation for consistency.

2.3 Precision, signiﬁcant digits and errors
When designing new systems, it is essential to be sure that they satisfy the
required speciﬁcations. Therefore, when working with numerical values, it
is essential to be aware of the precision of these numbers. Neglecting the
consideration of the precision can lead to big problems, like parts of machines
that do not ﬁt together. Uncertainties in quantities with respect to the average
value can occur both due to actual variations (in time) in the quantity that is
measured and due to uncertainties in the measurement technique that is used
to determine the quantity.
2.3.1 Precision and signiﬁcant digits
The most common method to determine the uncertainty in a quantity is to
measure the quantity q a large number of times and determine the average
value qavg and standard deviation σq. For example we measure the diameter
of a 1 euro cent coin N times with a calliper, analyse the results and obtain
d = davg ± σd = (16.20 ± 0.05) mm. The standard deviation σd is a measure
of the uncertainty (imprecision) in a single measurement1 of the value of the
1Note that the uncertainty in the average value of all the N measurements is lower than the
uncertainty in a single measurement: σdavg ⇡σd/
p
N. So, taking more measurements of

26
2 NOTATION, MATH, AND ENGINEERING BASICS
coin diameter d. If many di↵erent euro cent coins are measured variations
between the euro cent coins can also increase the uncertainty, thus both
measurement uncertainty and object variations can contribute to the total
uncertainty. Assuming a Gaussian distribution of the measurement values, the
value of the standard deviation gives a probability of 68% that the diameter of
the coin is between 16.15 mm and 16.25 mm.
Signiﬁcant digits (also called signiﬁcant ﬁgures) are an approximate way
to indicate these kinds of uncertainties in a value. Since adding or removing
one signiﬁcant digit changes the precision of the value by a factor 10, it is a
quite rough indicator of the precision. Nevertheless, even this rough estimate
can protect you from making grave mistakes. For instance, you buy a piece of
wood with a width of w = 100 cm to ﬁx a door in your house. When installing
it you notice that it is only 99.6 cm such that you have an ugly gap of 0.4 cm
(or you might ﬁnd the door doesn’t close because w = 100.4 cm). If you go
back to the salesman you might not get your money back, since 100 cm means
that the width can have any value between 99.5 cm and 100.5 cm, instead you
should have bought a piece of wood with a width of w = 100.0 cm.
In the example of the euro cent coin, the diameter of the coin would be
indicated as d = 16.2 mm. The last digit indicates the uncertainty, showing
that with reasonable certainty the value will be between 16.3 mm and 16.1
mm. Alternatively you can continue working with the full expression (16.20 ±
0.05) mm, and use error analysis to determine the error and precision. These
methods also can be used to determine the error propagation, for instance in
case a quantity q is determined from d by a function q = f(d), an error in d will
also result in an error in q. If we determine the area of the euro cent coin using
the equation A(d) = f(d) = 1
4⇡d2 we ﬁnd, using the Taylor expansion for small
errors σd, that A = f(davg ± σd) ⇡f(davg) ± σd
@f
@d = 1
4⇡(d2
avg ± 2davgσd), such
that the error (standard deviation) in A can be determined by: σA ⇡σd
@f
@d.
However, although very important, further discussion of these methods is out
of the scope of this textbook.
When reporting measured quantities in engineering, the number of signif-
icant digits should always be estimated and reported2. In case estimating
precision is diﬃcult, a conservative estimate of the number of signiﬁcant digits
the same quantity is a way to reduce the uncertainty.
2Besides the precision, that indicates the variation of the quantity around the average value,
there can also be a deviation of the average measured value with respect to the actual
value. For instance the calliper might have an o↵set, such that it always measures 0.05
mm less than the actual value. that would be measured by a more accurate instrument.
This is called a systematic error, and its magnitude is related to the accuracy of the
quantity.

2.3 PRECISION, SIGNIFICANT DIGITS AND ERRORS
27
is recommended. Signiﬁcant digits can sometimes only be properly indicated
using scientiﬁc notation, which is notation of a number by a single digit before
the decimal point and an appropriate exponent. For example, if there are two
signiﬁcant digits, a mass should be written as 1.2 ⇥102 kg and not as 120
kg (which indicates three signiﬁcant digits). The most important point to
note is that trailing zeros, like in 1.000, right of the last non-zero digit are all
signiﬁcant, while the leading zeros like in 0.001, left of the ﬁrst non-zero digit,
are not signiﬁcant. Some examples:
• 1.2 ⇥102 kg 6= 120 kg
• 2.000 kg = 2000 g = 2.000 ⇥103 g
• 1.8⇥10−3 m = 0.0018 m = 1.8 mm
In the ﬁrst case the quantity on the left has two signiﬁcant digits, while the
quantity on the right has three signiﬁcant digits, because the zero is a trailing
zero, just like the zeros in the second case. In the third case, the zeros in 0.0018
m are not signiﬁcant, because they are leading zeros, such that there are only
two signiﬁcant digits.
2.3.2 Making calculations with signiﬁcant digits
When making calculations based on quantities with signiﬁcant digits, the
number of signiﬁcant digits can change. If the number of signiﬁcant digits
reduces, the value is calculated and rounded to the nearest number with the
determined number of signiﬁcant digits. The following rules are most important
to determine the number of signiﬁcant digits of a calculated value:
• There is no uncertainty in countable, integer numbers, or mathematical
quantities like ⇡. They should be treated as having an inﬁnite number of
signiﬁcant digits.
• To facilitate working with signiﬁcant digits, write the number in scientiﬁc
notation to remove all zeros on the left, but keep all trailing zeros on
the right of the value: d = 0.0162 m= 1.62 ⇥10−2 m. Then count the
number of signiﬁcant digits, in this case 3.
• In multiplication or divisions, the resulting number of signiﬁcant digits is
equal to the ﬁgure with the fewest signiﬁcant digits. E.g. in F = m · a =
1.0 kg ⇥3.124 m/s2 = 3.1 N, the resulting number of signiﬁcant digits is
two, equal to that of the mass, which has the lowest number of signiﬁcant
digits.
• In additions or subtractions, the last signiﬁcant digit of the calculated
result should be equal to the last (smallest) signiﬁcant digit of the least

28
2 NOTATION, MATH, AND ENGINEERING BASICS
signiﬁcant quantity from which it is determined. E.g. ∆x = x2 −x1 =
2.156 m −2.13 m = 0.03 m. The result of the calculation is 0.026 m, but
the last signiﬁcant digit in 2.13 m (the 3) is at two positions right of
the decimal point, such that only 1 signiﬁcant digit remains in the ﬁnal
rounded result.
• When applying functions to quantities, like tan x1
x2 = tan(0.988) = 1.52 ,
the number of signiﬁcant digits is kept the same as the argument. Note
that his rule, although often suﬃcient, is not always completely accurate,
e.g. when working with power functions. More advanced methods are
outside the scope of this textbook.
• Only determine signiﬁcant digits at the end of a calculation. For inter-
mediate results in the calculation one should keep a suﬃciently large
number of digits to prevent additional imprecision due to rounding.
S Example 2.6 Which of these expressions make correct use of signiﬁcant digits
and units, for mass m, time t, force F, angular velocity !, and angle ✓?
A.
F = 0.0020 kg · 300 m/s2 = 0.60 N
B.
t = 0.10 s −1.0 ms = 99 ms
C.
✓= ⇡⇥10−3.0 ms/(1.0 ms)rad = 3.1 ⇥10−3 rad
Exemplary solution
F = 0.60 N
correct! 2 signiﬁcant digits are kept in
multiplication.
t 6= 99 ms
t = 0.10 s. Most signiﬁcant ﬁgure in ﬁrst
value is 10 ms, same should hold for ﬁnal
result after subtraction.
✓= 3.1 ⇥10−3 rad
correct! 10−3.0 ⇡1.0 ⇥10−3.

2.4 SOLVING FIRST-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
29
2.4 Solving ﬁrst-order di↵erential equations
Several mathematical techniques are important in dynamics, and for that reason
we dedicate space to repeat them in this textbook. Here we discuss solving
di↵erential equations and in the next section we discuss complex numbers. In
the next chapter we discuss vectors and linear algebra methods.
In kinematics we will often encounter ordinary di↵erential equations (ODEs)
that need to be solved in order to analyse the motion of objects. Solving an
ODE always involves ﬁnding an unknown function y(x) based on a known
ODE. The function y(x) has a dependent variable y like the position s, speed
v or acceleration a of a point, and an independent variable x, which can be the
time t, position s or velocity v of the point. Realise that while in mathematics
courses you usually only deal with variables y and x, in dynamics di↵erent
variables are used, like s, v, a and t.
Although we will deal with second order ODEs in Ch. 13, in most of this
textbook we will deal with ﬁrst-order ODEs that contain a known function
f(x) (for instance a known position s(t)) and the unknown function y(x) that
we want to determine. The ODE can occur in either of these forms:
df(x)
dx
=
y(x)
(2.12)
dy(x)
dx
=
f(x)
(2.13)
The convenient aspect of these ﬁrst-order di↵erential equations is that they
can be solved using di↵erentiation and integration. In case of an ODE of the
form of Eq. (2.12), the solution can be found by taking the derivative of the
known function f(x) to ﬁnd the solution of the ODE y(x) = df(x)
dx . For the
second case shown in Eq. (2.13) solving the ODE requires integration, and can
either be carried out by using the indeﬁnite integral, or by using the deﬁnite
integral. We will outline both integration procedures. In the following three
subsections we discuss the basic di↵erentiation and integration techniques in
some more detail.
2.4.1 Di↵erentiation by chain and product rule
When dealing with an explicit function of time vs(t) taking the derivative is
straightforward, e.g. as(t) = dvs(t)
dt . However, when dealing with functions that
are implicit functions of time like vs(s), where the time dependence of the
position s is given by s(t), the chain rule is needed. In that case we use the

30
2 NOTATION, MATH, AND ENGINEERING BASICS
chain rule like this:
as(t) = dvs(s(t))
dt
= dvs(s)
ds
ds(t)
dt
(2.14)
Sometimes the product rule for di↵erentiation is also needed:
dF(t) · v(t)
dt
= dF
dt · v(t) + F(t) · dv
dt
(2.15)
2.4.2 Indeﬁnite integral
In case of Eq. (2.13) the ODE can be solved by integration using the indeﬁnite
integral to obtain y(x) as follows:
dy(x)
dx
=
f(x)
(2.16)
dy
=
f(x)dx
(2.17)
Z
dy
=
Z
f(x)dx
(2.18)
y(x)
=
F(x) + c1
(2.19)
Here, F(x) is a primitive function of f(x) such that dF
dx = f(x) and c1 is an
unknown integration constant. This constant can be determined if the value
of y is known for one value of x = x0. E.g. if y(x0) = y0, then we have
y0 = F(x0) + c1, from which we ﬁnd the value of the integration constant
c1 = y0 −F(x0) and by substituting this value of c1 in Eq. (2.19) the full
solution of the ODE is found to be y(x) = [F(x) −F(x0)] + y0.
2.4.3 Deﬁnite integral
Besides taking the indeﬁnite integral, one can also choose to use a deﬁnite
integral to solve the ODE, which is often a bit shorter, since the known
condition y(x0) = y0 can be directly taken as one of the boundaries of the
deﬁnite integral. The deﬁnite integral is obtained as follows:

2.5 COMPLEX NUMBERS
31
dy(x)
dx
=
f(x)
(2.20)
dy
=
f(x)dx
(2.21)
Z y(x)
y(x0)
dyi
=
Z x
x0
f(xi)dxi
(2.22)
[yi]y
y0
=
[F(xi)]x
x0
(2.23)
y −y0
=
F(x) −F(x0)
(2.24)
y(x)
=
[F(x) −F(x0)] + y0
(2.25)
Note that since the deﬁnite integral evaluates the di↵erence F(x) −F(x0),
any integration constant c1, that appeared in the indeﬁnite integral Eq. (2.19),
is automatically eliminated and does not need to be determined. Eventually the
result of both methods, indeﬁnite or deﬁnite integration, is of course identical.
When taking a deﬁnite integral, it is essential to ensure that the boundaries
of the integrals on the left and right side of the equation are corresponding
to identical points of the curve y(x): y0 = y(x0) and y = y(x). Note that we
have used the variable x as the upper boundary of the deﬁnite integral, which
allows us to ﬁnd the function y(x) for any value of x. Note also that for clarity
when taking the integral on both sides we have replaced the variables x and
y inside the integral by the variables xi and yi (the result of the integral is
of course independent of the symbol we choose to integrate over), to clearly
distinguish them from the integration boundaries x and y. We take the integral
of the function f(xi) over the variable xi, that runs from x0 up to x. Or, in
other words, with the deﬁnite integral we determine the area under the f(xi)
graph, for values of xi running from xi = x0 to xi = x. If the integral runs
from xi = x1 to xi = x2, Eq. (2.22) can also be written in the following form,
that we will use regularly:
y(x2) = y(x1) +
Z x2
x1
f(xi)dxi
(2.26)
From this equation it is clear that if the value of y is known at one value of
x1, then y(x1) can be determined such that evaluation of the integral enables
us to determine y(x2) at any other value x2.
2.5 Complex numbers
Working with complex numbers can simplify the analysis of the dynamics in
many cases. In particular when working with vibrations, we will use complex

32
2 NOTATION, MATH, AND ENGINEERING BASICS
numbers a lot to simplify solving di↵erential equations, see Ch. 13. When you
know how to work with complex numbers, it saves you remembering many
trigonometric equations. Here we will only summarise the most useful relations
for complex numbers that are part of most introductory mathematical analysis
courses.
A complex number y can be written as the sum of a real part yr and an
imaginary part yi multiplied by the imaginary unit i. We now summarise some
of the properties of complex numbers that you should be able to use. Especially
the ﬁrst three are important, since by using the normal rules for calculating
with scalars the rest of the properties can be proven from them.

S Example 2.7 If you can work well with complex numbers, there is no need
any more to memorise or look up trigonometric sum and product equations. As an
example, use complex numbers to show that:
<ei(a+b) = cos(a + b) = cos a cos b −sin a sin b
3When yr 0 use the atan2 function with ' = atan2(yi, yr), see https://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/atan2, or make a drawing and use trigonometry to determine '.
4This holds for all analytic functions, but not for all non-analytic functions.

cos(a + b) = <[eia ⇥eib]
<[eia ⇥eib]

cos a cos b −sin a sin b
(2.39)
So, if you can solve this problem, you don’t have to memorise any trigonometric
sum, di↵erence or double angle formula anymore, you can easily derive cosine and
sine functions with complex numbers, taking the real or imaginary parts of ei(a±b)
or e2a = ea+a.
Another useful property of complex numbers is that their real and imaginary
parts behave as the x and y components of a vector in the xy-plane, where ' is
the angle they make with the x axis. Thus complex numbers can be practical
for adding planar vectors.
A Example 2.8 Two force vectors ~F 1 and ~F 2 that both lie in the xy-plane act
on a point A. The angles that the vectors make with the x axis are '1 and '2.
Problem: Calculate the absolute value of the total force vector ~F tot = ~F 1 + ~F 2
acting on A.
Exemplary solution
We replace the vectors by the complex numbers Ftot, Fc1 and Fc2, where we use
that <Fc1 = F1,x and =Fc1 = F1,y. Then we have:
|~F tot|2
=
|Fc1 + Fc2|2 = (Fc1 + Fc2)(Fc1 + Fc2)⇤
=
Fc1F ⇤
c1 + Fc2F ⇤
c2 + Fc1F ⇤
c2 + Fc2F ⇤
c1
=
|Fc1|2 + |Fc2|2 + |Fc1|ei'1|Fc2|e−i'2 + |Fc2|ei'2|Fc1|e−i'1
=
|Fc1|2 + |Fc2|2 + |Fc1||Fc2|[ei('2−'1) + e−i('2−'1)]
=
|~F 1|2 + |~F 2|2 + 2|~F 1||~F 2| cos('2 −'1)
(2.40)
Taking the square root of this equation gives the absolute value of |~F tot|. Note that
the equation we have derived is called the ’Law of cosines’. With complex numbers
there is no need to memorise it.
A Example 2.9 An important application of complex numbers is for analysing
vibrations, as we will discuss in Ch. 13. A mass can vibrate at two angular frequencies
!1 and !2 simultaneously, in which case its motion is written as: xtot(t) = cos(!1t)+
cos(!2t).
Problem: Show that this sum of trigonometric functions can also be written as a
product of trigonometric functions: xtot(t) = 2 cos

2(!1 + !2)t

This mathematical result leads to an important phenomenon called beating where
the amplitude of vibrations, like sound, is modulated in time as shown in Fig. 2.1.

2.6 How to solve problems
In general you can use the following ﬂowchart [9] to solve problems in a
structured way. The steps will be outlined in more detail in Ch. 14.
Follow these steps to solve a problem:

2.6 HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS
35
1. Make sure you read the theory, at least up to the point needed to solve
the problem.
2. Read the entire problem description carefully, from beginning to end.
3. Write down a list of variables given and a second list of variables to be
calculated.
4. Determine the type of problem.
5. Determine for yourself whether this is a problem of kinematics, kinetics,
or other.
6. Break the problem down into sub-problems as appropriate and search
for the required theory subsection in the book. Read this part again if
needed.
7. Extract the general methods and formulae that need to be applied. Write
down the equation number(s) from the book. Make sure you use the
original, generic form of the formulae (not a similar-looking version from
an example or a problem solution).
8. Make drawings, such as FBDs, or kinematic diagrams of your system.
Use di↵erent views where needed. Clearly deﬁne at least one coordinate
system including unit vector directions and a coordinate origin. Specify
it if the coordinate system is moving or rotating.
9. Optionally create a table of variables where you clearly associate the
variables in the problem and in your drawings with the variables given
in the theoretic formulae.
10. Check all assumptions that need to hold for the formulae to be applicable
11. Write down all assumptions you made for your speciﬁc problem, and
highlight those that can only be checked later.
12. In many problems you have to solve for one or more scalar variables.
In general, you have E equations, and need to solve a system with U
unknowns. To check if you have suﬃcient information (E) to solve the
problem apply the following steps:
a) Count the number U of scalar unknowns. Be careful to include all
unique components of a vector or a matrix individually.
b) Count the number E of scalar equations given by the equations you
found.
c) Compare E and U.
• If E = U, continue.
• If E < U, do not start solving yet. Instead, ﬁnd more equations,
either in the theory or in the problem itself. Are there kinematic
relationships between variables that can reduce U or increase
E?

36
2 NOTATION, MATH, AND ENGINEERING BASICS
• If E > U, continue, but make a note to come back to check if
some of the equations do not contradict each other and if all of
them are correct.
d) Solve the system of equations. Do this symbolically as much as
possible, do not insert any numbers.
e) Check the original assumptions. Do they indeed hold? If not, go
back to step 11, make other assumptions and solve the problem
again.
f) Once you have found a result, conduct multiple plausibility checks.
Also re-insert your solution into your original equations, especially
if E > U. If in doubt about your result, start again at step 1.
g) If requested compute the numerical values of the U unknowns using
the E obtained equations and the given numerical quantities.
2.7 Plausibility checks
A plausibility check is a calculation or validation procedure that is performed
to verify if the obtained solution to a certain problem is correct.
The main takeaways from this section are the following:
• If your answer passes all plausibility checks, then the answer is probably
correct.
• If your answer does not pass a plausibility check, then the answer is
probably wrong and the failed check will likely provide you information
where the mistake is, such that you can ﬁx it.
• Therefore, if you learn properly to perform plausibility checks, you will
not need a solution anymore to check if your answer is correct.
• Note that you can also perform a plausibility check at every intermediate
step of the solution. This helps to ﬁnd the step with the mistake.
• For professional engineers there is no solution manual. To avoid making
mistakes, which can have a huge impact, they always need to check the
plausibility of their calculations, to be close to 100% sure of their answer.
• Therefore checking the correctness of answers (without solution manual)
is one of the most important skills an engineer should acquire.
• For this reason we do not give students answers to all problems, since
if one uses a solution manual to verify the correctness of answers, one
never learns how to properly perform plausibility checks.
• If you, despite the plausibility checks, do not manage to solve a problem,
always ask explanation from your professor, teacher or colleagues.

2.7 PLAUSIBILITY CHECKS
37
Here are some examples of questions you can ask yourself to check the
plausibility of an answer:
• Does the quantity in the answer have the right units?
• Are units on both sides of the equation equal? (Sec. 2.2)
• Is the sign of the answer correct when comparing it to the question? E.g.
in a problem where a ball is falling downward due to gravity, and the y
axis points upward, is vy negative?
• Does the value of the answer make sense? (not more than 10 times
smaller or larger than expected?). E.g. in a problem where a mass
is accelerating due to gravity over a surface, its acceleration can never
exceed the free fall value g.
• When you substitute the answer in the equations used, do you get back
the given values? E.g. if you have found the solution x(t) = c1t2, from the
initially given acceleration, check by twice di↵erentiating that a(t) = 2c1.
• When projecting forces on axes, does the length of the vector correspond
to that of the components? E.g. v2
x + v2
y + v2
z = |~v|2.
• Does the net force vector P ~F point in the same direction as the acceler-
ation ~a?
• Do the chosen axes form a right-handed coordinate system?
• Does P ~F = m~a and the other laws of Newton and Euler hold if you
substitute the ﬁnal answer back into them?
• Can methods of work and energy be used to double check the solution?
• Are all given constraint equations satisﬁed if you substitute the ﬁnal
answer into them?
• Is there any other information given that can be veriﬁed with the answer?
Of course there are many more plausibility checks that can be performed, which
really depend on the type of problem under consideration.

3 Vectors and Coordinates
Since vectors and coordinate systems are essential for the description of dy-
namics, we discuss the deﬁnitions, conventions and basic operations (linear
algebra and cross products) needed to deal with them in this chapter.
3.1 Vectors in mechanics
A vector (or Euclidean vector) is a unitless geometric object with a magnitude
and direction in three-dimensional space. In science and engineering a vector
can also have a unit. In this section we discuss several particular conventions
and methods that are important for using and drawing vectors in mechanics.
3.1.1 Position vector
Probably the most important vector in dynamics is the position vector ~rA
which represents the position of a point or point mass A in space by a straight
arrow that points from the origin of the coordinate system to point A. Usually,
a coordinate system is chosen such that the position vector of the origin has
zero magnitude, |~rO| = 0.
3.1.2 Relative position vector
A relative position vector ~rB/A (see Fig. 3.1) is a vector that indicates the
relative position of a point (or point mass) B with respect the position of
another point A and is deﬁned as:
~rB/A ⌘~rB −~rA
(3.1)
Note that the order of the objects in the subscript is important: ~rB/A
indicates the position of object B with respect to the position of A, and vice
versa ~rA/B indicates the position of object A with respect to the position of
B, inverting the direction of the vector, therefore ~rB/A = −~rA/B, as is also
seen from Eq. (3.1). A way to remember this is to replace the symbol / by
the words ’with respect to’. So, ~rB/A is ’the position vector of point B with

40
3 VECTORS AND COORDINATES
respect to point A’. A normal position vector (without / in the subscript) is
always measured with respect to the origin O of the coordinate system.
The relative position vector is convenient to determine the shortest distance
between two points in space. Relative velocity and acceleration vectors between
two points are deﬁned analogously:
~vB/A
⌘
~vB −~vA
(3.2)
~aB/A
⌘
~aB −~aA
(3.3)
Concept. Distance
The distance dB/A between two points A and B in space is given by the absolute
value of the relative position vector connecting these two points.
dB/A ⌘|~rB/A| =
q
~rB/A · ~rB/A

respect to the origin. Relative position vector ~rB/A, indicating the position of

S Example 3.1 Determine the distance between points A and B using the relative
position vectors.
Exemplary solution
From Fig. 3.1 we ﬁnd that: ~rA = (8ˆı + 2ˆ|)m and ~rB = (3ˆı + 4ˆ|)m. With Eq. (3.1)
we ﬁnd that ~rB/A = ([3 −8]ˆı + [4 −2]ˆ|)m. Then we obtain from Eq. (3.4) that the
distance between points A and B is: dB/A =
p
52 + 22 m =
p
29 m.

3.2 DRAWING VECTORS
41
3.1.3 Vectors and unit vectors
Besides position vectors, we will deal with many other types of vectors for
analysing dynamical systems, like velocity, angular velocity, force and torque
vectors. In all these cases the vector, for instance a force ~F , expresses a
magnitude and a direction.
The magnitude of the vector can always be
obtained by taking the absolute value (norm) of the vector:
|~F | =
p
~F · ~F
(3.5)
The magnitude |~F | is a scalar with the unit newton (N). The direction of the
force can be speciﬁed by a unit vector ˆF , which is a vector with magnitude 1
that points in the same direction as ~F . That unit vector is deﬁned as:
ˆF ⌘
~F
|~F |
(3.6)
Because they are a ratio of two quantities with the same unit, unit vectors,
despite their name, have no unit. They are called ’unit’ vector because they
have a magnitude of unity). With these deﬁnitions any vector can be written
as the product of a magnitude and a unit vector like in this example for the
force vector:
~F = |~F | ˆF
(3.7)
3.2 Drawing vectors
Although the motion of objects, can be fully expressed with mathematical equa-
tions, it is often much easier to visualise objects and mechanisms using drawings.
Moreover, it is common practice in engineering to not provide all information
in equation form, but provide part of it in the form of a drawing. Therefore,
correctly drawing vectors, and interpreting those drawings is important for a
correct analysis of dynamics. Analysing a problem in mechanics usually starts
by making a sketch of the system, and later one or more free-body diagrams
(FBDs), which are then translated into mathematical equations. To make sure
no errors or inconsistencies occur during this translation process from drawing
to mathematical equations, it is important to draw all vectors correctly and
to have clear deﬁnitions on the way vectors are drawn and converted into
equations.
A vector is always drawn as a straight arrow, with a label. Optionally, a dot
can be placed at the tail or head of the arrow to indicate the point of action
of the vector. If the arrow points perpendicular to the plane of the drawing,

42
3 VECTORS AND COORDINATES
its direction can be indicated by the symbols ⊙(pointing towards the reader
out of the page) and ⌦(pointing away from the reader into the page). The
meaning of these symbols can be easily memorised by imagining a dart arrow
that points in the same direction as the vector and realising that the symbols
resemble the tip (⊙), or ﬂight (⌦) of the dart arrow.

Figure 3.2: The three main ways of specifying vectors in a drawing. a) General vectors. b)
Vectors speciﬁed by a scalar signed magnitude. c) Vectors speciﬁed by scalar
magnitude and angle.
Figure 3.2 shows three main ways to specify vectors in a drawing:
1. Drawing general vectors ~F A, ~F B (Fig. 3.2a).
2. Drawing vectors as an arrow with ﬁxed direction and scalar signed
magnitude FA, FB (Fig. 3.2b).
3. Drawing vectors with scalar magnitude |FA|, |FB| and a direction speciﬁed
by an angle φA, φB (Fig. 3.2c).
Although the ﬁrst method of drawing without scalars can always be used, it
is important to get used to the second and third method of drawing vectors
as well, since they provide a way to use the drawing to provide part of the
relevant information with less equations needed, and are therefore regularly
used in engineering.
We note that in general, multiple 2D drawings, e.g. obtained by orthographic
projection, are needed to visualise a 3D system. However, since in this textbook
we will mainly deal with the dynamics in a single plane, one drawing is usually
suﬃcient.

3.2 DRAWING VECTORS
43
3.2.1 Drawing general vectors
General vectors are drawn by an arrow and a vector label like ~F A (Fig. 3.2a).
When using this type of vector notation, the most important thing is to draw
the vector with the right point of action in the drawing, to label it correctly
and to make sure each relevant vector is only drawn once. Although it is
convenient to draw the arrow in the direction in which the vector is expected
to point, drawing it in the wrong direction will not cause problems, since both
the direction and magnitude of the vector, and its conversion to scalars, are
dealt with by the mathematics and a suitably chosen coordinate system. This
means that in addition to the drawing an equation like ~F A = (3ˆı + 4ˆ|)N is
needed to fully specify the vector.
3.2.2 Drawing vectors with scalar signed magnitude
In some cases the direction of the line along which a vector operates is ﬁxed,
e.g. because a force operates along the line connecting two points in the
drawing, but the magnitude of the vector is not, for instance because it is
a time-dependent force vector or because it still needs to be calculated. In
that case the vector can be represented by drawing an arrow in the direction
the vector is known to act and adding a scalar label FA next to it (Fig. 3.2b).
In this case the correct drawing of the direction of the arrow is essential for
the further analysis, because it deﬁnes a unit vector ˆF A pointing in the same
direction as the drawn arrow. Normally this unit vector is not drawn, but in
this ﬁgure it is drawn to explain the concept of deﬁning vectors with signed
magnitudes. When using this method of drawing vectors, the scalar quantity
FA is deﬁned as the signed magnitude of the vector ~F A and the drawing deﬁnes
this vector by:
~F A ⌘FA ˆF A
(3.8)
Note that the scalar value FA can have a negative sign: that is the reason FA
is called a ’signed magnitude’. When FA is negative, the vector ~F A points
in the opposite direction as the drawn arrow and unit vector ˆF A. This also
means that FA can have a di↵erent sign than the vector’s magnitude which is
always positive (FA ± |~F A|). If the magnitude of the vector is known and ﬁxed,
then one can replace the label FA by the magnitude of the vector including
the unit, for instance by writing 3 N besides the arrow like in Fig. 3.2b).

44
3 VECTORS AND COORDINATES
3.2.3 Drawing vectors by magnitude and angle
A planar1 vector ~F A, can also be indicated by a magnitude |~F A| and an angle
φA (Fig. 3.2c). When specifying the angle φA, one also needs to specify the
reference direction at which φA = 0, which is indicated by a dashed line and
is usually taken to be the positive x-axis. One also draws a circular arrow
that points from the reference direction towards the drawn vector to indicate
the direction in which the angle φA increases. In this textbook we use the
convention that in the xy-plane such an angle has a positive scalar value if
it rotates in the same direction as given by the right-hand rule2. So in the
coordinate system drawn in Fig. 3.2 the angle increases in the counter-clockwise
direction. Then, in a Cartesian coordinate system in the xy-plane (see later in
this chapter) one ﬁnds that:
~F A = |~F A| cos φAˆı + |~F A| sin φAˆ|
(3.9)
An angle between two vectors can be speciﬁed as φB/A = φB −φA. If the
magnitude and/or angle of the vector are known and ﬁxed, then one can replace
the labels |~F A| and φA by the magnitude and angle of the vector including
the unit, for instance by writing ’3 N’ besides the arrow and replacing the
angle φA by 233◦, as can be seen in Fig. 3.2c). Inverting the direction of such
a vector is done by adding ⇡rad (=180◦) to the angle (φA ! φA + ⇡). This
is a di↵erence with the signed magnitude vector, for which the inversion is
performed by changing the sign of the signed magnitude (FA ! −FA).
S Example 3.2 Give the mathematical expressions for the following quantities
such that the corresponding vectors in Fig. 3.2 have identical magnitude and direction
as the vector in Fig. 3.2b) speciﬁed by label 3 N:
• ~F A and ~F B in Fig. 3.2a)
• FA and FB in Fig. 3.2b)
• The combination |~F A| and φA in Fig. 3.2c)
Exemplary solution
• ~F A = 3
5(3ˆı + 4ˆ|)N and ~F B = 3
5(3ˆı + 4ˆ|)N
• FA = 3 N and FB = −3 N
• |~F A| = 3 N and φA = arctan 4
3 ⇡53◦
1We only discuss in-plane vectors here, which can be speciﬁed with a single scalar angle. In
general at least two angles are needed to specify a vector in 3D.
2So by putting the thumb of one’s right-hand along the z-axis, the direction of positive
increasing angle is that in which the curved ﬁngers point.

3.2 DRAWING VECTORS
45
3.2.4 Drawing ﬁxed, sliding and free vectors
A vector only has a direction and magnitude. However, for vectors in mechanics,
the position at which vectors are drawn can be essential for the correct analysis.
For instance the position of the origin is essential for the interpretation of a
position vector, and the point of action of a force vector can be essential for its
e↵ect on a rigid body. For this reason, vectors can be complemented by a point
(reference point, or point of action), or by a line of points (line of action). The
combination of the vector and this point or line is then called a ﬁxed vector or
a sliding vector.
1. Fixed vectors: these are vectors which have to be drawn at a ﬁxed
point of action or reference point for the correct dynamic analysis. This
point of action or reference point should be indicated by a black dot on
the tail or tip of the arrow. Position vectors are ﬁxed vectors and always
have their point of reference at the tail of the arrow. The vector ~rA in
Fig. 3.3 is an example.
2. Sliding vectors: for sliding vectors, instead of a point of action, one
can use a line of action, that is shown as a dashed line in Fig. 3.3. The
line of action of a force vector ~F B is the line that passes through its
point of action B and is parallel to ~F B. For sliding vectors any point of
action that lies on the line of action can be chosen without a↵ecting the
dynamic analysis, so the vector can slide along the line. For example,
to determine the moment vector of force ~F B with respect to a reference
point P, one uses the cross product ~
M B/P = ~rB/P ⇥~F B. It can be
shown that replacing point B by any other point on the line of action,
results in the same moment vector ~
M B/P . This is visualised in Fig. 3.3
by showing that the area of the red rectangle and red parallelogram are
equal. When sliding a vector, the line of action should be drawn as a
dashed line that passes through the point of action or reference point,
which should still be indicated by a black dot, like point B in Fig. 3.3.
Sliding a vector along its line of action can be performed to facilitate or
clarify a drawing, but is in particular useful to facilitate determining a
cross product. As will be discussed in Sec. 3.4, the magnitude of such a
cross product ~rB/P ⇥~F B is equal to the area of the red parallelogram
Fig. 3.3. As shown by the red rectangle in Fig. 3.3, one can slide the tail
of the vector ~F B along the line of action to the point nearest to P at a
distance rmin. Then the cross product is simply proportional to the area
of the red rectangle, so | ~
M B/P | = rmin|~F B|.
3. Free vectors: There is no reference point for a free vector, so free
vectors can be drawn anywhere. However it is often clearer to draw them

46
3 VECTORS AND COORDINATES
on or near the object on which they act, like shown for the vector ~
M B/P
in Fig. 3.3. The moment, couple, and angular momentum vector are free
vectors. Also the angular velocity and angular acceleration vectors of a
rigid body are examples of free vectors.
4. Vector ﬁelds: vector ﬁelds consist of vectors at every position in space.
They are best drawn as vectors on the objects on which they act, while
their spatial dependence is given as equations. Alternatively vector ﬁelds
can be drawn and visualised at many points in space (similar to Fig. 5.6).
Since the gravitational acceleration vector ﬁeld on earth is approximately
constant, it can be drawn at a single position like shown in Fig. 3.3 using
signed magnitude notation ~g = −gˆ|, by which we indicate that it is
identical for all objects in the ﬁgure.

the red parallelogram and red rectangle are equal to the magnitude of the cross
product |~rB/P ⇥~F B|.
3.2.5 Projecting vectors and drawing components
After drawing the vectors and deﬁning the coordinate system, the vectors can
be projected on the coordinate axes to obtain and draw the vector components.
To obtain the components along each of the axes, we take the dot product
with the unit vectors. For example in Cartesian coordinates we get for the
projection of the vector ~F A on the coordinate system (CS) the following 3

components:

=
~F A · ˆı
(3.10)
FA,y
=
~F A · ˆ|
(3.11)
FA,z
=
~F A · ˆk
(3.12)
As a result we have ~F A = FA,xˆı + FA,yˆ| + FA,zˆk, and projected vector com-
ponents can be considered as vectors themselves, e.g.
~F A,x = FA,xˆı, with
axis subscripts x, y, z to indicate the projected components. Examples of
drawing projected vector components are shown in Fig. 3.4. Projected vector
components are in practice always drawn using signed magnitude notation (so
with scalar labels). If both the vector and its projected vector components
are drawn, one has to use dashed arrows for the drawn vector components, to
distinguish them from the original vector (see examples in Fig. 3.4). This is
needed to prevent errors from double counting of forces in an FBD. According
to the rules for drawing vectors with signed magnitude notation, a minus sign
is needed in front of the projected components when the arrow points in the
negative axis direction, like for −FB,x in Fig. 3.4.
3.2.6 Scaling of drawn vectors
If you want to use geometric techniques to make calculations with vectors,
then it is important to draw them with the correct magnitude. Euclidean
vectors are drawn in a coordinate system with axes with distance dimensions
and units in e.g. meters. Using these axes, the magnitude of a position vector
can be determined by measuring its length. However, the magnitude of other
vectors, like velocity or force (see e.g. vector ~F B in Fig. 3.3), that have units

48
3 VECTORS AND COORDINATES
of m/s or N cannot be determined from the axes. There is therefore always
a scale factor that can be chosen arbitrarily to convert the drawn length of
such a vector to its actual magnitude. For example a force vector ~F that has a
magnitude |~F | = 1 N can be drawn with a length of 1 m. In that case there is
a scale factor for force vectors γF = 1 m/N, but other scale factors might also
be chosen. After choosing a scale factor, the drawn length of all force vectors
should be determined from their magnitude using the equation γF |~F |. This
scaling is especially important when graphical methods are used that use the
drawn magnitudes of vectors.
3.2.7 Drawing points
Points are drawn as black dots with a label in a sketch or FBD. It is important
to realise that there are di↵erent types of points. There are points that are
ﬁxed3 in space, but also points that move along with a rigid body, like the
point B in Fig. 3.3. To clarify in a drawing which points move along with a
rigid body and which ones do not, we adopt the following conventions in this
textbook:
• Relevant points are always indicated by a black dot.
• If the black dot is not touching a rigid body, the point is assumed to be
ﬁxed space, like the point at (0, 0) in Fig. 3.3.
• If the black dot is touching a rigid body or its edge, the point is moving
along with the rigid body (like any mass inside the rigid body), like point
B and C in Fig. 3.3.
• In all other cases more information needs to be provided to clarify if
the point indicated by the drawn dot is ﬁxed in space or moving along
with one of the objects in the drawing. As an example see the caption of
Fig. 9.8, where the drawn dots touch 2 rigid bodies, and di↵erent labels
are used to indicate points that move along with di↵erent rigid bodies,
while being represented by the same black dot.
The main message is to be aware that there are di↵erent types of points in
dynamics: points ﬁxed in space, and points ﬁxed to rigid bodies or other
objects. Further clariﬁcation of the motion of points can be provided in a text
that accompanies the drawing.
3To be more precise, with the words ’ﬁxed in space’, we mean that it has zero velocity and
acceleration in the current reference frame. With ’move along with a rigid body’ we mean
that the point has zero velocity and acceleration in a reference frame for which all points
of the rigid body have zero velocity and acceleration. We will discuss reference frames in
more detail in Sec. 6.12.

3.3 COORDINATE SYSTEMS
49
3.2.8 Drawing distances and dimensions
Often dimensions and distances (see Sec. 3.1.2) between two points needs to
be drawn. Distances are always positive and drawn as a double sided arrow,
with arrow heads on both of its ends and/or small perpendicular end caps.
An example is shown in Fig. 3.3 for the distance L that characterises the side
length of the rectangle.
3.3 Coordinate systems
In this textbook we deal with two main types of coordinate systems for
determining position and analyse motion in three dimensional (3D) space:
Cartesian coordinates and cylindrical coordinates. We will not discuss spherical
coordinates.
3.3.1 Cartesian coordinates
In Cartesian coordinates, space is spanned by x, y and z coordinate axes,
which determine the position of objects with respect to the origin O, as is
shown in Fig. 3.5. Along each of the axes a unit vector with length 1 is deﬁned,
respectively ˆı, ˆ| and ˆk, which point in the positive axis directions.
Note. When drawing a coordinate system in 3 dimensions, the convention is
to always use right-handed axis system, since otherwise the vector rules for
taking cross-products will fail. For Cartesian coordinates this means that you
should make sure, e.g. using the right-hand rule, that for a ﬁxed choice of the
order of coordinates x, y, z, we have the relation ˆı⇥ˆ| = ˆk between the respective
unit vectors.
To describe the position vector ~rA of a point mass A with respect to the
origin in Cartesian coordinates you can use one of the following 3 notations:
~rA
=
xAˆı + yAˆ| + zAˆk
(3.13)
=
2
4
xA
yA
zA

5 =

⇤T
(3.14)
Where the superscript T in (3.14) stands for the transpose of the matrix,
converting the row vector to a column vector. We use square brackets and
no commas to indicate vectors, and round brackets with commas for the
coordinates (xA, yA, zA).

50
3 VECTORS AND COORDINATES
Figure 3.5: Point mass A, at position vector ~rA = xAˆı + yAˆ| + zAˆk, moving in a Cartesian
coordinate system.
3.3.2 Cylindrical coordinates
Cylindrical coordinates (⇢, φ, z) are often useful, for example to analyse the
dynamics of a point mass A that rotates around an axis (the z-axis). An
example of such a coordinate system in 2D is shown in Fig. 3.6 and in 3D
Fig. 3.7. Ideally the z-axis of the coordinate system is chosen parallel to the
rotation axis, and the origin of the coordinate system is chosen to be located
at a suitable position on the axis. Then the position of the point mass A can
be described by 3 coordinates: the radial coordinate ⇢A that determines the
shortest distance to the axis, the azimuthal angle φA with respect to a reference
line (polar axis) and the axial coordinate zA. The unit vectors ˆ⇢, ˆφ and ˆk,
which are shown in the ﬁgure, point in the direction the tip of the position
vector would move if you would increase 1 of the coordinate values by a small
amount. Mathematically the unit vector at the position ˆrA is ˆφA = @~rA
@φA /| @~rA
@φA |,
and similarly for ˆ⇢A and ˆkA. In contrast to Cartesian vectors, the direction
of unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates can depend on the position vector
~rA of the object. So if there are multiple objects it can be useful to label the
relevant unit vector with a subscript A.
Note. Like in Cartesian coordinates one should adhere to the convention
that a cylindrical coordinate system ⇢, φ, z is a right-handed axis system with
ˆ⇢⇥ˆφ = ˆk, by choosing φ to increase in the anticlockwise direction, as observed
when looking from the positive z-axis towards the origin. This is consistent

with the convention to take the anticlockwise direction as the positive direction
for measuring angles.

One needs to be careful when working with vectors in cylindrical coordinates,
because the vector component values depend on the coordinates (⇢A, φA, zA).
Standard vector operations, like addition, between multiple vectors in cylin-
drical coordinates can therefore only be carried out if the vectors refer to the
same coordinates, such that their unit vectors are identical. In other cases the
vectors should ﬁrst be converted to Cartesian coordinates, which can be done
using the following relation between the unit vectors:
ˆı

where we replaced the unit vectors ˆı, ˆ| and ˆk by Eq. (3.17)–(3.19).
3.3.3 Position vector in cylindrical coordinates
It is important to note that whereas in Cartesian coordinates the components
of the position vector ~rA = xAˆı+yAˆ|+zAˆk are identical to the coordinates xA,
yA, zA, the position vector in cylindrical coordinates is given by ~rA = ⇢Aˆ⇢+zAˆk
and does not provide information about the angle φA. Motion in cylindrical
coordinates can therefore better by expressed by giving the 3 coordinate
functions (⇢A(t), φA(t), zA(t)) than using the position vector.

It is incorrect to have φA in the vector notation as shown on the right side of
Eq. (3.22), as is also evident from the units which should be equal for every
vector component.
3.4 Vector products
To mathematically express the laws of dynamics, we will often need two types
of vector products: the dot product indicated by the symbol ·, and the cross
product, indicated by the symbol ⇥. Note that these symbols only represent
dot and cross products when they are placed between two vectors. If they
are placed between two scalars or a scalar and a vector they indicate scalar
multiplication.
3.4.1 Dot products using unit vector notation
Dot products or cross products of vectors can be evaluated using unit vector
notation, using the following relations for dot products between unit vectors,
that follow from their orthogonality:
ˆı · ˆı = ˆ| · ˆ| = ˆk · ˆk
=
1
(3.23)
ˆı · ˆ| = ˆ| · ˆk = ˆk · ˆı
=
0
(3.24)
All dot products can be evaluated using these relations between the unit
vectors. For example one now can take the dot product between two vectors
~v = vxˆı + vyˆ| and ~F = Fxˆı + Fyˆ| as follows:
~v · ~F
=
(vxˆı + vyˆ|) · (Fxˆı + Fyˆ|)
(3.25)

3 VECTORS AND COORDINATES
So you just multiply the scalar values by the dot products of the unit vectors.
Here we used Eq. (3.23) and Eq. (3.24) to determine the dot products between
the unit vectors like ˆı · ˆı.
3.4.2 Cross product using unit vector notation
For cross products the relations between unit vectors in a right-handed axes
system are as follows:
ˆı ⇥ˆı = ˆ| ⇥ˆ| = ˆk ⇥ˆk
=
~0
(3.29)
ˆı ⇥ˆ| = −ˆ| ⇥ˆı
=
ˆk
(3.30)
ˆ| ⇥ˆk = −ˆk ⇥ˆ|
=
ˆı
(3.31)
ˆk ⇥ˆı = −ˆı ⇥ˆk
=
ˆ|
(3.32)
Where we used that for every cross product it holds that ~A ⇥~B = −~B ⇥~A
(whereas for dot products ~A · ~B = ~B · ~A). With these relations all cross
products can be evaluated using the unit vectors. For example one now can
take the cross product between two vectors ~r = rxˆı + ryˆ| and ~F = Fxˆı + Fyˆ|
as follows:
~r ⇥~F
=
(rxˆı + ryˆ|) ⇥(Fxˆı + Fyˆ|)
=
rxFxˆı ⇥ˆı + ryFxˆ| ⇥ˆı + rxFyˆı ⇥ˆ| + ryFyˆ| ⇥ˆ|
=
rxFx · ~0 + ryFx · (−ˆk) + rxFy · (+ˆk) + ryFy · ~0
=
(rxFy −ryFx)ˆk
(3.33)
Where we used Eq. (3.29) and Eq. (3.30) to evaluate the cross products between
the unit vectors. Using unit vector notation has several advantages. You
only have to write down and evaluate those unit vectors that are non-zero,
the notation takes much less space and it is immediately clear what type of
coordinate system one is working in from the unit vectors. For these reasons
we will usually work with unit vector notation in this textbook.
3.4.3 Graphical analysis of dot and cross products
Dot and cross products can also be evaluated graphically as is shown in Fig. 3.8.
The two vectors are drawn such that their tails are at the same point in space
and the planar angle φB/C between them is determined. To obtain the dot
product one projects one of the vectors on the direction of the other, obtaining

the scalar |FB| cos φB/C, which is then multiplied by the magnitude of the
other vector |vC| giving the result:
~vC · ~F B = |~vC||~F B| cos φB/C.
(3.34)
The magnitude of this scalar value is proportional to the area of the pink
parallelogram shown in Fig. 3.8. Note that the direction of the distance |vC|
should be drawn at 90◦to the actual vector ~vC to construct this parallelogram
for the dot product.

Figure 3.8: Demonstration of how to graphically determine the dot product ~v · ~F B and the
cross product ~
M B/A = ~rA ⇥~F B. The areas of the light-red parallelograms
indicate the magnitude of the dot and cross product, note that a line |vC| is
drawn perpendicular to the vector ~vC to visualise its dot product with vector
~F B.
For graphically analysing the cross product of two vectors ~rA ⇥~F B (see
Fig. 3.8), one puts their tails together and draws a circular angle arrow φB/A,
that starts at the ﬁrst vector ~rA (left of the ⇥) and points anticlockwise towards
the second vector ~F B. Then if both vectors are in the xy-plane, their cross
product can be determined as:
~
M B/A = ~rA ⇥~F B = |~rA||~F B| sin φB/Aˆk
(3.35)
As can be seen in Fig. 3.8, the magnitude of the cross product vector is
equal to the red parallelogram whose sides are formed by the two vectors. The
angle φB/A is measured in the anticlockwise direction. Since φB/A > 180◦, we
have sin φB/A < 0 and the vector ~
M B/A points in the −ˆk direction, into the
plane as indicated by the ⌦sign.

3 VECTORS AND COORDINATES
Right-hand rule
The direction of the cross-product vector ~rA ⇥~F B can also conveniently be
determined using the right-hand rule. In that case it is important not to always
draw an anticlockwise angle, but to draw the smallest angle φ0
B/A from the
ﬁrst vector ~rA in the cross product to the second vector ~F B (see dashed arrow
φ0
B/A in Fig. 3.8). So, make sure φ0
B/A < 180◦. Then curve the ﬁngers of your
right hand parallel to that curved arrow, with ﬁngers pointing in the same
direction as the arrowhead. Your thumb will then point in the same direction as
~rA ⇥~F B in the −ˆk direction. It is recommended to always check the direction
of vectors resulting from cross-product calculations using the right-hand rule.
There are several alternative variations of right-hand and left-hand rules to
determine the direction of a cross-product. Feel free to choose and memorise
the one that you ﬁnd most easy to use.
S Example 3.3
a) Determine the values of the dot product ~vC · ~F B and the cross product ~rA ⇥~F B
using unit vector notation. Use that the length of the vectors in Fig. 3.8 is scaled
such that 1 m : 1 m/s : 1 N.
b) Determine the values of the dot product ~vC · ~F B and the cross product ~rA ⇥~F B
using graphical analysis.
Exemplary solution
a) Since all vectors are in the xy-plane we can reuse Eq. (3.28) and use Fig. 3.8 to
obtain:
~vC · ~F B
=
vC,xFB,x + vC,yFB,y
(3.36)
=
[(−3 ⇥−2) + (0 ⇥−4)] N · m/s
(3.37)
=
6 N · m/s
(3.38)
For the cross product between two vectors in the xy-plane we can use the result
from Eq. (3.33):
~rA ⇥~F B
=
(rA,xFB,y −rA,yFB,x) ˆk
(3.39)
=
(6 ⇥(−4) −2 ⇥(−2)) N · m ˆk
(3.40)
=
−20 N · m ˆk
(3.41)
b) First we determine the angles of the vectors with respect to the positive x-axis
direction. We have φA = arctan 2
6 = 18.4◦, φB = 180◦+ arctan −4
−2 = 243.4◦and
φC = arctan
0
−3 = 180◦. Then we ﬁnd φB/C = φB −φC = 63.4◦and φB/A = φB −
φA = 225◦. We determine the magnitude of the three vectors: |~rA| =

A,x + r2
A,y =

So, as it should be, both the unit vector and graphical method to determine dot and
cross-products give the same result.
3.5 Vector functions, ﬁelds and calculus
Vectors can be parametrized, such that their values depend on a scalar pa-
rameter like time t or position on a curve s. Such a parametrized vector,
like ~F (t) or ~F (s) is also called a vector function. If a coordinate system
is chosen, the vector function can be described by three scalar functions,
~F (t) = Fx(t)ˆı + Fy(t)ˆ| + Fz(t)ˆk.
3.5.1 Vector and scalar ﬁelds
Even though they do not play an important role in this textbook we brieﬂy
mention the concept of vector ﬁelds. A vector ﬁeld is a vector function that
is deﬁned at any point in (a region of) space. This is done by using the
coordinates as parameters of the vector function, like in ~F (x, y, z). Examples
of vector ﬁelds are the gravitational force ﬁeld ~F (x, y, z) acting on a planet
and the velocity ﬁeld ~v(x, y, z) describing the velocities of all point masses in
a rigid body. Instead of providing a single vector at one position, a vector ﬁeld
describes a ﬁeld of vectors that are present at every location in space. Vector
ﬁelds can also be time-dependent like in ~F (x, y, z, t). One can also deﬁne scalar
ﬁelds, like V (x, y, z) which deﬁne a scalar value at every position. We will
discuss scalar ﬁelds in more detail when dealing with potential energy in Ch. 7.
3.5.2 Calculus on vector functions
Vector calculus deals with methods to integrate or di↵erentiate vector functions
and ﬁelds. Although a complete discussion of vector calculus is outside the
scope of this textbook, we say a few words about it here. Di↵erentiation
and integration over a vector functions can be performed by separating the
vector into its components and then proceeding with each component like with
scalar functions, e.g. for a time integral
R ~F (t)dt =
R
Fx(t)ˆıdt +

Fy(t)ˆ|dt +

dtFx(t)ˆı +
d
dtFy(t)ˆ| + d
dtFz(t)ˆk. Often Cartesian coordinates are to be preferred, because
these operations become quite diﬃcult in e.g. cylindrical coordinates where
the unit vectors depend on position. However, when discussing kinematics we
will deal with time derivatives of vector functions in cylindrical coordinates.
3.5.3 Calculus on scalar and vector ﬁelds
The di↵erential operator, signiﬁed by the nabla symbol ~r, is important for
analysing scalar and vector ﬁelds. In Cartesian coordinates it is deﬁned as
~r =
@
@xˆı + @
@yˆ| + @
@z ˆk. The main operations that can be performed using ~r
are:
1. The gradient ~r, e.g. ~rV (x, y, z) = −~F (x, y, z), which converts a scalar
ﬁeld to a vector ﬁeld.
2. The divergence, a dot product with ~r, converts a vector ﬁeld to a scalar
ﬁeld: e.g. ~r · ~v(x, y, z) = f(x, y, z).
3. The curl, a cross product with ~r converts a vector ﬁeld to another vector
ﬁeld: e.g. ~r ⇥~v(x, y, z) = ~G(x, y, z).
Vector and scalar ﬁelds can be integrated over a line in space, over a surface in
space and over a volume in space using single, double or triple integrals. The
detailed discussion of the multivariable calculus is outside the scope of this
textbook, where we will only discuss the gradient and volume integrals over
scalar ﬁelds.

4 Introduction to Dynamics
In this chapter we will introduce the ﬁeld of dynamics, Newton’s laws and the
fundamental concepts of space, time, force and mass.
4.1 Dynamics and motion
Motion is all around you, the universe is full of moving matter and objects. This
motion is surprisingly predictable and can therefore accurately be described by
laws: Newton’s laws of motion. The ﬁeld of science and engineering studying
the time-dependent motion of matter in the presence of forces is called dynamics.
During several centuries dynamical models have been developed that enable
scientists to understand many time-dependent processes in nature and have
allowed engineers to use this understanding to design and control motion to an
extremely high degree. Examples include precise robots, fast formula one racing
cars and remotely controlled spacecrafts, all of which have been designed by
engineers by applying the concepts that are introduced in this textbook. And
who knows? Maybe you will design the next generation of dynamic machines
and devices in the future.
Since the early history of mankind people have been studying motion. As-
tronomers in ancient times were observing the trajectories of celestial objects
like moons and planets. Also, motion of objects on earth were being studied,
like in the experiment in 1586 where Simon Stevin dropped two balls with
di↵erent mass from the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft, providing evidence that they
fall at the same rate. In 1687 Newton introduced the famous laws of motion in
his Principia, which were based on the mathematics he had developed with
Leibniz for solving di↵erential and integral equations.
Newton’s laws, which are the building blocks for the ﬁeld of dynamics,
provide a mathematical model to describe the experimentally observed motion
of objects in our universe, which is accurate to a very high degree. Deviations
from the model occur only in the case where speeds become comparable to
the speed of light, such that Einstein’s theory of relativity is needed or if sizes
and energies and masses become very small, such that quantum mechanical
e↵ects start to play a role. These exceptions, which were only discovered in the
20th century, belong to the ﬁeld of modern physics and are outside the scope

60
4 INTRODUCTION TO DYNAMICS
of this course, which focuses on classical mechanics and dynamics. In this
textbook we will discuss the theoretical models of dynamics based on Newton’s
laws as if they represent a perfect description of experimental observations.
Nevertheless, it remains important to realise that there is a di↵erence between
these models and the experimental observations they attempt to describe,
since despite the high degree of accuracy of current physical models, there
are still experiments that cannot be captured by them and are subject of
thorough scientiﬁc investigations. For instance the model for describing the
dynamics of stars rotating around the centre of a galaxy is still debated (gravity
rotation problem) and the dynamics of particles that were observed to travel
upstream into a small waterfall still remains to be explained. See also https:
//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics.
We note here that Newton’s laws are not the only way to describe the
experimentally observed motion of objects. Alternative popular formulations
of dynamics are Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, which are dealt with
in more advanced textbooks in dynamics. These formulations, yield completely
identical results as Newton’s laws, but can in some cases be advantageous to
simplify the mathematical analysis.
4.2 Newton’s laws of motion
In his Principia Newton introduced three laws of motion that can mathemati-
cally be expressed in vector format as follows:
Concept. Newton’s Laws of Motion
1.
If
X
j
~F ij = ~0 then ~ai = ~0
(4.1)
2.
X
j
~F ij = mi~ai
(4.2)
3.
~F ij = −~F ji
(4.3)
These equations and the variables will be explained and deﬁned in more
detail in the next two chapters. It can be seen that Newton’s ﬁrst law is a direct
consequence of Newton’s second law when setting P ~F ij = ~0. Newton’s third
law (action=–reaction), describes a property of all known fundamental forces
of nature, which states that for every force ~F ij that acts on point mass i there
is another collinear force ~F ji that acts on another point mass j with equal
magnitude and opposite direction. In other words if point mass j generates a
force ~F ij on object i, then point mass i generates a force ~F ji = −~F ij on point

4.3 OUTLINE AND ELEMENTS OF DYNAMICS
61
mass j. The points of action of both forces coincide with the positions of the
corresponding point masses. The ﬁrst and third laws should be familiar if you
followed a course in statics. Newton’s second law P ~F = m~a is the essential
equation in dynamics.
Note. Newton’s laws are strictly only valid for objects that are point masses,
which are so small that they can be described by a single point (position vector)
in space. By applying Newton’s laws to each point mass in an object or system
that consists of many point masses, new laws can be derived for these larger
systems. Much of this textbook is dedicated to deriving and discussing these
new laws and using them to analyse more complex dynamical systems, like rigid
bodies.
4.3 Outline and elements of dynamics
Newton’s laws are based on the following elemental concepts.
Concept. Elements of dynamics
• Space
– Every location in space is identiﬁed by a position vector ~r.
• Time
– Position vectors can change in time t, such that there is motion.
• Mass
– Objects can consist of one or more point masses i, each having a
well deﬁned position vector ~ri and mass mi.
• Force
– On every point mass i one or more force vectors ~F ij(t) can act.
In the following chapters we will discuss these elemental concepts in more
detail to describe the dynamic motion of objects, and then continue to discuss
how this motion is related to mass and force. The subject of dynamics can be
described as follows.
Concept. Dynamics
Dynamics is the ﬁeld of science and engineering concerned with predicting and
analysing the motion ~ri(t) of point masses under the inﬂuence of forces and
constraints.

4 INTRODUCTION TO DYNAMICS
Figure 4.1: Determining the motion and forces in dynamics.
Since all matter in our universe consists of point masses, which are called
elementary particles and move in response to four fundamental forces of nature,
the ﬁeld of dynamics covers practically all science with subdisciplines like
classical dynamics, electrodynamics, quantum dynamics, and thermodynamics,
but also chemistry and biology. In this textbook we will only discuss the
dynamics that can be described by Newton’s laws, which is generally called
classical dynamics. The ﬁeld of dynamics can be split into two main domains:
1. Kinematics
• Study of the motion of objects in space and time without considering
the forces that cause this motion.
2. Kinetics
• Study of the motion of objects in relation to mass and forces.
Fig. 4.1 illustrates the roles of kinematics and kinetics in dynamics. Kinetics
is used to relate the forces to the accelerations and equation of motion, while
kinematics is used to relate the equations of motion (which are di↵erential
equations) and constraint equations to the actual motion. The ﬁgure illustrates
that one can predict the motion ~r(t) at all times if the forces and initial
conditions are known, and that it is also possible to determine the forces if the
motion is known.
Besides the division into kinematics and kinetics, there is also a division of
dynamics based on the types of objects that are being analysed:

4.3 OUTLINE AND ELEMENTS OF DYNAMICS
63
1. Point masses
Objects whose mass is located on a single point in space.
2. Rigid bodies
Objects whose mass distribution in space is rigid and undeformable.
3. Deformable bodies and ﬂuids
Objects whose mass distribution in space is deformable like in elastic
solids or can ﬂow like a liquid or gas.
In part II we will discuss the dynamics of point masses, while in part III
we will analyse the dynamics of rigid bodies. Deformable bodies are out of
the scope of this textbook. For both parts we will discuss kinematics, kinetics,
the method of work and energy and the method of impulse and momentum.
Finally we will conclude with the discussion of vibrations. This division leads
to the following outline of the rest of the chapters of this textbook:
• Kinematics of point masses: Ch. 5
• Kinetics of point masses: Ch. 6
• Work and energy of point masses: Ch. 7
• Impulse and momentum of point masses: Ch. 8
• Kinematics of rigid bodies: Ch. 9

• Work and energy of rigid bodies: Ch. 11
• Impulse and momentum of point masses: Ch. 12

5 Kinematics of Point Masses
In this chapter we will show how to describe and analyse the dynamic motion of
objects in space and time. We begin by deﬁning what we mean by space, time,
motion and kinematics in Sec. 5.1. Then we will describe what displacement,
velocity and acceleration vectors are in Secs. 5.3–5.5. Subsequently we introduce
the path coordinate, that allows simplifying motion in 3D to a 1D problem and
show how to determine position, velocity and accelerations along the path curve
in Secs. 5.7 and 5.8, and also show how to do this using various 3D coordinate
systems (Sec. 5.9). Finally we discuss kinematic analysis of segmented motion
in Sec. 5.10.
5.1 Space, time and motion
We start by introducing the concepts of space, time and motion, the building
blocks of kinematics.
Concept. Space
In space the position of each point mass i can be described by a position vector
~ri. Space can be parametrised by a three-dimensional (3D) coordinate system
as introduced in Sec. 3.3. This space, in which the shortest distance between
two points is a straight line, is also called Euclidean space.
Concept. Time
The position of objects in space can change1 in time t.
Concept. Motion
The motion ~ri(t) of a single point-like object i is a function that describes its
position coordinates at every time t (see Fig. 5.1). The motion of a system
of N point masses is represented by a set of vector functions ~r1(t),~r2(t), . . .
,~ri(t), . . . ,~rN(t) that describe the positions of all points i in the system at all
times.
1Note that without this change, it would be impossible to measure time, since devices to
measure time like pendulum clocks are also based on dynamics and change.

68
5 KINEMATICS OF POINT MASSES
Concept. Kinematics
Kinematics describes the motion of objects in time and space, irrespective of the
forces that cause them to move. Kinematic techniques allow one to determine
the relations between position, velocity and acceleration vectors, and to apply
constraint equations for motion analysis.
Kinematic information on a point mass is provided in two ways:
1. Full or partial information on the time dependence of the position, velocity
or acceleration vectors or its components.
2. Constraint equations that pose certain limitations on how the point mass
can move.
The goal of kinematics is to analyse the given information to obtain more
detailed information on the motion of the particle. The main challenges and
skills in kinematics we will address in this chapter are:
1. To describe the motion of a point mass using a time-dependent position
vector ~r(t) in a suitable coordinate system.
2. To relate and determine position, velocity and acceleration vectors from
each other.
3. To use constraint equations and equations of motion to determine and
predict the time-dependent motion ~r(t) of point masses.
5.2 Constrained and predetermined kinematics
In the next chapter on kinetics we will discuss how the motion of objects in
time and space can be described based on the knowledge of forces and masses.
However, often there is also di↵erent information about the motion available.
For example when a train is constrained by a rail-track, when a measurement
of the motion of a bird’s trajectory was made, or when it is assumed that a
rolling ball always touches a curved surface. This information can be cast in
the form of constraint equations.
5.2.1 Constraint equations
Although all dynamics is governed by Newton’s laws, rigorously applying these
laws for every atom can be very ineﬃcient. For instance, when a hockey puck is
sliding on ice, modelling the forces of all ice molecules would be a tremendous
task. Instead, we know that the ice molecules generate forces on the puck
that prevent it from entering the ice, while gravity prevents the puck from

function ~ri(t).

5 KINEMATICS OF POINT MASSES
moving above the ice surface, such that the puck will obey a constraint equation
z(t) = 0.
Thus in such cases, where we know the e↵ective properties of a number of
forces, it is much more eﬃcient to describe their combined e↵ect on the motion
by constraint equations instead of applying Newton’s laws. Remember however,
that such constraint equations always are the result of forces, and the accuracy
of the resulting dynamics will depend on the accuracy by which the constraint
equations represent these forces. In the next chapter we will also discuss how
constraint equations can be combined with Newton’s laws to determine the
forces generated by the constraints.
In other cases, information about the motion of an object has been obtained
from a measurement, or is assumed to be known, and a constraint equation
that describes the measured trajectory can be used to analyse the kinematics,
and determine velocities and accelerations.
Deﬁnition. Constraint equation
Equation that provides information on the motion and trajectories of objects
in time and space, without providing direct information on the forces and
mass. Constraint equations describe the kinematic constraints, which are the
constraints that limit the potential motion of a mechanical system.
A constraint equation f can often be written as a function of the position
vectors of the objects ~ri, and their time derivatives as:
f(~ri, ˙~ri, ¨~ri, . . . , t) = 0
(5.1)
Where ~ri, with i = 1, 2, . . . , N (or i = A, B, . . .) are the position vectors of
the objects in the system. By taking the time-derivative or time-integral of a
constraint equation, additional constraint equations can be derived. We will
now discuss several examples of constraint equations.
5.2.2 Spatially constrained kinematics
Although space is always three-dimensional, in some cases there are forces on
the object that constrain the motion to a certain part of space. The analysis of
the dynamics in these cases can be signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed. For instance, when
a hockey puck A slides over a ﬂat ice surface, and we know or assume that it
will not lift from the surface, this can be described by the constraint equation:
zA(t) = 0
(5.2)
Since in this case the puck will not move along the zA coordinate, its dynamics
can be fully dealt with in 2 dimensions (2D) using (x, y) coordinates or polar

5.2 CONSTRAINED AND PREDETERMINED KINEMATICS
71
(⇢, φ) coordinates, simply applying the Cartesian and cylindrical coordinate
systems from the previous sections with z = 0. In fact this textbook deals with
many examples of this 2D in-plane dynamics situation, the derived equations
and techniques are valid in 3D unless explicitly stated otherwise.
5.2.3 Path curve and path coordinate
Figure 5.2: A mass A moves along path coordinate curve ~rs(s) (blue). Its position, and
distance from point s = 0 along the path curve, is uniquely determined by its
scalar path coordinate sA, with ~rA = ~rs(sA). The unit vector ˆs points in the
direction of increasing s. Note that the mass can move in the opposite direction
if ˙sA < 0.
An even more constrained situation is when the motion of an object is limited
to a one-dimensional (1D) curvilinear path. This situation arises for instance
when a train, marble or other point mass i moves along a predeﬁned track,
guided by a rail or tube.
As shown in by the blue curve in Fig. 5.2 such a curvilinear path traces out
a 1D path in 3D space, and this path can be described by a parametrised
path curve ~rs(s), such that for every value of the scalar path coordinate s
there is 1 vector ~rs(s) that deﬁnes the position on the track. It is convenient
(although not always easy), to choose this function such that s is a measure
of the distance along the track with respect to a certain origin ~rs(s = 0), for
instance this can be done by taking a ﬂexible tape measure, and measuring
the distance s along the track. Since it is known that the point mass i always

resides on the path curve, we have the following constraint equation:
~ri(t) = ~rs(s).
(5.3)
At every time t, the path coordinate of object i has to obey equation (5.3),
such that: ~ri(t) = ~rs(si(t)). This has the advantage that, because the path
curve ~rs(s) is known, the motion of i in 3D can be described by a scalar
function si(t), instead of requiring a more complex 3D vector function ~ri(t).
Equation (5.3) and also the equation zi(t) = 0 from the previous subsection
are examples of constraint equations.
5.2.4 Relatively constrained kinematics and pulleys
Besides spatial constraints that limit the motion of a point mass to a certain
plane or curve in space discussed in the previous subsection 5.2, it is also
possible to have constraints that limit motion of a point mass with respect to
one or more other point masses. Consider for example two point masses A and
B with their motion described by separate path curves and path coordinates
sA(t) and sB(t), see Fig. 5.3. When making such a drawing, you are free to
choose for each path coordinate the positive direction of the path curve and
also the point at which the path coordinate is zero, which is called the datum.
It is important to indicate those in the drawing.
We can write down a relative constraint equation for the length Lrope of the
rope. From Fig. 5.3 we see that always:

5.2 CONSTRAINED AND PREDETERMINED KINEMATICS
73
sA(t) + sB(t) + R⇡= Lrope
(5.4)
The term R⇡comes from the part of the rope that touches the pulley with
radius R over half of its perimeter. By taking the time derivatives of this
equation and using that the length of the rope Lrope and the radius of the
pulley R is constant in time we ﬁnd:
sA(t) + sB(t)
=
c1 = constant
(5.5)
˙sA(t) + ˙sB(t)
=
0
(5.6)
¨sA(t) + ¨sB(t)
=
0
(5.7)
This shows that at all times the velocity and acceleration of the masses
are equal and in opposite directions (¨sA = −¨sB). These relative constraint
equations facilitate analysis of dynamic problems, since one does not need to
determine the force in the rope. Since one is usually only interested in the
constraint equation for the velocities, it is often not necessary to determine
the exact value of the constant c1 = Lrope −R⇡.
The shown procedure for obtaining the constraint equations is also quite
generally applicable:
• Determine the path coordinates of all moving objects and point masses
based on the geometry.
• Determine the constraint equations for the positions of the objects and
simplify them.
• Take two times the time derivative of the constraint equation to obtain
the constraint equations for the velocities, and for the accelerations.
S Example 5.1 Fig. 5.4 shows a more complicated pulley system. The question
is: ﬁnd the relative constraint equation that relates the velocities ˙sA, ˙sB of point
masses A and B.
Exemplary solution Since pulleys C and D are also moving, it is useful to also
monitor their path coordinates sC and sD, which have been indicated in Fig. 5.4.
Now we write down all constraint equations and combine them to obtain a single
equation relating sA and sB:
Lrope
=
sA + 2sC + sD + LCD + c1
(5.8)
sC
=
sB −(LCD + LB)
(5.9)
sD
=
sB −LB
(5.10)
Lrope
=
sA + 3sB + c2

Figure 5.4: Example 5.1: Two point masses A and B move in a complex pulley system. We
want to ﬁnd their relative constraint equation. Pulleys C and D are connected
by a rigid blue rod to keep their mutual distance at LCD.
The actual value of the constant c2 is not needed to solve the problem, since we now
take the time derivative to obtain the relative constraint equation for the velocities:
sA + 3sB

(5.12)
˙sA + 3 ˙sB

0
(5.13)

(5.14)
The three constraint equations (5.8-5.10) represent the e↵ect of the three
constraining elements in Fig. 5.4: the rope, the rigid rod between pulleys C
and D and the short rope between pulley D and point mass B. Initially there
are four unknown scalar variables: sA, sB, sC and sD. Generally each (scalar)
constraint equation eliminates one unknown, such that in the end we are left
with one constraint equation (with one unknown). Besides pulleys and ropes
there are of course many other elements that constrain motion, which will be
discussed later.
5.3 Displacement
After having discussed how the position of a point mass i can be described in
space using coordinate systems and vectors, we now turn to how its position
evolves in time, and introduce the important concepts of displacement, velocity

5.3 DISPLACEMENT
75
and acceleration that are essential for analysing dynamics. For this purpose
we compare the position ~ri(t1) at a ﬁrst time t1 to ~ri(t2) at a later time
t2 = t1 + ∆t, with ∆t > 0. The di↵erence between these vectors, the change in
position vector, is the displacement vector as can be seen in Fig. 5.1.
Concept. Displacement vector
The displacement vector ∆~ri,12 describes the displacement in space of a point
mass between times t1 and t2.
∆~ri,12 = ~ri(t2) −~ri(t1).
(5.15)
The initial and ﬁnal position are separated by a displaced distance ∆ri,12 =
|∆~ri,12|. The displaced path distance ∆si,12 of the mass, which is the displaced
distance as measured along the path (instead of along a straight line) can be
determined by the equation:
∆si,12 = si(t2) −si(t1),
(5.16)
when the trajectory of the mass is parametrised by a path curve as discussed
in the previous section 5.2.3.
The total travelled distance ∆sT,i,12 is not the distance between the initial
and ﬁnal positions, but depends on the path taken. The travelled distance
can be larger than the displaced distance ∆si,12| if the mass reverses direction
on its path and travels back and forth along the same path curve in multiple
segments, in which case the distances |∆si,12| along each of these segments
(with di↵erent sign ∆si,nm) should be summed up to determine ∆sT,i,12.
If the path is a straight line, the displaced path distance |∆si,12| is equal
to the displaced distance |∆~ri,12|, but when the path is curved, the displaced
path distance is always longer, because a straight line is the shortest distance
between two points: |∆si,12| ≥|∆~ri,12|.
The inﬁnitesimal displacement vector that corresponds to an inﬁnitesimally
small time di↵erence dt with t1 = t and t2 = t + dt is found to be:
d~ri = ~ri(t + dt) −~ri(t).
(5.17)
The closer you look at a small segment of a smooth trajectory, the more
it resembles a straight line. This can be seen in Fig. 5.1 by comparing the
dashed line and the straight arrow between ~ri(6s) and ~ri(7s). Therefore the
inﬁnitesimally travelled distance dsi = si(t + dt) −si(t) becomes equal to the
length of the inﬁnitesimal displacement vector: |dsi| = |d~ri|.

76
5 KINEMATICS OF POINT MASSES
5.4 Velocity
Velocity is displacement per unit of time. The average velocity of point mass i
between time t1 and t2, over path curve ~rs, over a time interval ∆t = t2 −t1 is:
vs,avg = ∆si,12
∆t
(5.18)
This average velocity can be positive or negative. In contrast, the average
speed, is deﬁned to be always positive:
vs,sp,avg = ∆sT,i,12
∆t
(5.19)
The average velocity and speed are determined over a large time interval, in
contrast the instantaneous velocity is measured over an inﬁnitesimally small
time interval.
Concept. Velocity vector
The (instantaneous) velocity vector ~vi is deﬁned as the time derivative of the
position vector:
~vi(t) ⌘d~ri
dt ⌘lim
dt!0
~ri(t + dt) −~ri(t)
dt
.
(5.20)
The determination of the velocity vector from the position vector is shown
graphically in Fig. 5.5, taking a relatively large timestep dt = 1 s. The speed
or absolute velocity vi(t) is deﬁned as the magnitude of the velocity vector,
vi(t) = |~vi(t)| which is always positive or zero.
Derivation. Velocity on the path curve
If a path curve has been deﬁned, it can be shown that the velocity vector is
always tangential to this path curve:
~vi = d~ri
dt = d~rs(si(t))
dt
= dsi
dt
d~rs(s)
ds
= vs,iˆs.
(5.21)
To derive this equation, we used the chain rule and used that the vector d~rs(s)
ds
has a magnitude of 1, since |ds| = |d~r| (see previous section). As can be seen
in Eq. (5.21), we deﬁne ˆs ⌘d~rs(s)
ds
as the unit vector tangential to the path
curve that points in the direction of the path curve in which s increases (see
Fig. 5.2) and we deﬁne the path velocity vs as:
vs,i ⌘dsi
dt = ˙si.

Figure 5.5: Based on the motion of the point mass in Fig. 5.1, the velocity vectors ~vi(t)
are determined at every time t, using a time-step dt = 1 s. On the right the
acceleration vectors ~ai(t) are determined from ~vi(t) in the same way as the
velocity vectors were determined from the position vectors. Note that the average
velocity vectors between the points with ∆t = 1 s are drawn.

78
5 KINEMATICS OF POINT MASSES
The subscript s indicates that vs,i is the velocity of object i along the path ~rs.
Equation (5.21) proves that the velocity vector of the point mass i is always
parallel (tangential) to the path curve unit vector ˆs. vs,i can be both positive
and negative, depending whether it is in the same or the opposite direction
as the positive s direction ˆs and its magnitude is equal to that of the velocity
vector vi ⌘|~vi| = |vs,i|.
5.5 Acceleration
Similarly to the way the velocity vector is determined from the position vector,
the acceleration vector can be determined from the velocity vector (see Fig. 5.5).
Concept. Acceleration vector
The (instantaneous) acceleration vector ~ai is deﬁned as the time derivative of
the velocity vector:
~ai(t) ⌘d~vi
dt ⌘lim
dt!0
~vi(t + dt) −~vi(t)
dt
.
(5.23)
The absolute acceleration is deﬁned as: ai = |~ai|.
By taking the time
derivative of equation (5.21) using the product rule it is found that:
~ai(t) = d~vi
dt = dvs,i
dt ˆs + vs,i
dˆs
dt
(5.24)
In contrast to the velocity vector, the acceleration vector is not tangential to
the path curve ˆs, except if the path is straight ( dˆs
dt = ~0), or if the speed is
zero. Since the magnitude of ˆs is constant, the vector dˆs
dt is perpendicular to ˆs.
For that reason we have for the acceleration component tangential to the path
curve ai,s,t:
as,i,t = ~ai · ˆs = dvs,i
dt
(5.25)
This tangential component of the acceleration vector is also called the path
acceleration as,i and can be di↵erent from the absolute value of the acceleration
vector (|as,i| 6= |~ai|). We will discuss later how the acceleration vector in
various coordinate systems can be determined, which will be very important
for applying Newton’s second law.
5.6 The equations of motion
When analysing dynamic systems we often want to determine the motion ~r(t)
from a known acceleration ~a(t), velocity ~v(t) or a more complicated di↵erential

5.7 KINEMATIC ANALYSIS AS A FUNCTION OF TIME T
79
equation that involves the position coordinates and their time-derivatives. Such
an equation is called an equation of motion (EoM). Often multiple equations
are needed to fully determine the time-dependent motion ~ri(t) of every point
in the system.
Concept. Equations of motion
The equations of motion of a system are a set of di↵erential equations of
the position vectors/coordinates and their time-derivatives, that can be used
to determine the motion ~ri(t) of every point i in the system for any initial
condition.
We also introduce the concepts initial condition and state:
Concept. Initial condition and state of a system
Initial conditions fully describe the state of a system at a single initial time t0.
The state of the system is deﬁned as the combination of the position ~ri(t0) and
velocity vectors ~vi(t0) of all points i in the system at a single time t0.
If the initial conditions, equations of motion and constraint equations are
known, the future and history of a system can be calculated by kinematic
techniques. As an example of an equation of motion let us consider the situation
where we know that the velocity along a path curve is given by the function
v(t) = c1t2. Then from the deﬁnition of velocity and Eq. (5.22) we ﬁnd the
following equation of motion:
ds
dt = c1t2
(5.26)
Such an equation of motion ﬁxes the slope of the motion s(t) at every (s, t)
coordinate as is graphically shown by the arrows in Fig. 5.6. A main challenge
in kinematic analysis is to determine the motion s(t) from the EoMs and initial
conditions as illustrated by the red lines in the ﬁgure. In this chapter we will
discuss EoMs that can be solved by integration. In Ch. 13 on vibrations we
will also deal with other solution methods.
5.7 Kinematic analysis as a function of time t
We will show how the motion, velocities and accelerations of a system can
be determined by solving equations of motion using time di↵erentiation and
integration.

the slope ds
dt at every value of s and t. For several initial conditions (black dots)
the solutions of this EoM are plotted as red lines. It can be seen that the lines
are everywhere tangent (have equal slope) to the arrows of the EoM.
5.7.1 Time di↵erentiation
We have already shown how the velocity and acceleration vectors can be
determined from the position vector by two time di↵erentiation steps that are
indicated by arrows:
~ri
!
(5.27)
~vi
=
˙~ri !
(5.28)
~ai
=
˙~vi
(5.29)
And the same can be done along the path coordinate s, simplifying the
problem to scalar di↵erentiation:
si(t)
!
(5.30)
vs,i(t)
=
˙si(t) !
(5.31)
as,i(t)
=
˙vs,i(t) = ¨si(t)
(5.32)
During each of these steps, an ordinary di↵erential equation (ODE) is solved,
which is of the form of Eq. (2.12), df(x)
dx
= y(x), where x is replaced by t, f(x)
is replaced by the known function s(t) or vs(t) and y(x) is replaced by the
unknown function vs(t) or as(t) that we would like to determine. The details

5.7 KINEMATIC ANALYSIS AS A FUNCTION OF TIME T
81
of the procedure to solve these ﬁrst order di↵erential equations using either
indeﬁnite or deﬁnite integrals is explained in Sec. 2.4.
5.7.2 Time integration
To go in the opposite way, from acceleration to velocity and position, an
equation of motion needs to be solved to obtain si(t) from as,i(t), which is of
the form:
¨si = as,i(t)
(5.33)
Because the function as,i(t) only depends on time, this di↵erential equation
can be solved by integrating twice over time. Here we show how that is done
by integration along the path curve, and in Eq. (5.57) it will be shown how
it can be done in free space. Although these integrals can become diﬃcult
analytically, they can always be performed using numerical methods as will be
discussed concisely in section 5.8.5.
If the path acceleration function as,i(t) is known, it is possible to determine
the path velocity and path position by integration of Eqs. (5.30)–(5.32) as
follows.

(5.36)
During each of the integration steps, an ODE is solved of the form of
Eq. (2.13). From equations like Eq. (5.35) it is noted that time integration to
obtain ﬁnal velocity and position can only be performed if the position si(t1)
and velocity vs,i(t1) are known at a certain instant t1. That is why one needs
to known the initial conditions to solve the equations of motion.
S Example 5.2 To illustrate the kinematic analysis in time, let’s consider the
motion of a car along a track (Fig. 5.7), with path curve ~rs(s) = sˆı and path
coordinate sA = xA. It is given that the position of the car A on the track is:
sA(t) = ↵t3
(5.37)
Then we can obtain the velocity and acceleration by di↵erentiation using Eqs. (5.30)–

Figure 5.8: Example 5.2: Relations between the path coordinate sA, path velocity vs,A and
path acceleration as,A of the car shown in Fig. 5.7 with ↵= 1 m/s3. The path
velocity vs,A(t) is the slope of the sA(t) curve and the path acceleration is the
slope of the vs,A(t) curve as indicated by the tangential arrows. The path velocity
vs,A(t) increase compared to vs,A(0) is the integral of the area under the as,A(t)
curve and the path coordinate sA(t) increase is the integral of the area under the
vs,A(t) curve as indicated by the red areas.

(5.32):
vs,A(t)

˙sA = ↵d
dtt3 = 3↵t2
(5.38)
as,A(t)
=
˙vs,A = ↵d
dt3t2 = 6↵t
(5.39)
So the velocity is the slope (=time-derivative) of the sA(t) graph and the acceleration
is the slope of the vs,A(t) graph, as is shown by the arrows in Fig. 5.8.
Suppose now that instead, the acceleration of the car as,A(t) = 6↵t is given and
we want to determine the distance travelled after a certain time. It is given that
the car starts at t1 = 0 from rest, such that initial velocity and position of the
car are both zero (vs,A(t1) = sA(t1) = 0). From the acceleration the functions
that describe velocity and position at an arbitrary time t2 can be obtained using
equations (5.34)–(5.36):
as,A(t)
=
6↵t
(5.40)
vs,A(t2)

vs,A(t1) +

Z t2

3↵t2dt = 0 +
⇥
↵t3⇤t2

(5.42)
So the velocity change is the area (=time-integral) under the as,A(t) graph and the
position change is the area (=time-integral) under the vs,A(t) graph, as is shown by
the red areas in Fig. 5.8.
Comparing the ﬁrst 3 equations of this example to the last 3 equations demon-
strates that the time di↵erentiation and integration results in the same equations
for position, velocity and acceleration, as expected.
5.8 Kinematic analysis with the path coordinate s
In some cases the velocity vs,i(s), acceleration as,i(s) or time ts(s) as a function
of path coordinate s is known, but the explicit time dependence is unknown.
In those cases it can be more convenient to choose s as an independent
di↵erentiation or integration variable than t.
Note well, the function vs,i(s) is mathematically di↵erent from the function
vs,i(t), and that also holds for and as,i(s) and as,i(t). These functions are
connected by the relations vs,i(s(t)) = vs,i(t) and as,i(s(t)) = as,i(t) that
should hold at any time. The di↵erence by these functions will be designated
by clearly indicating between brackets the variable on which they depend
(vs,i(t) or vs,i(s)).

84
5 KINEMATICS OF POINT MASSES
5.8.1 Path di↵erentiation
If we take the time derivative of the function vs,i(s) we obtain using the chain
rule:
as,i(s) = dvs,i(s)
dt
= dvs,i(s)
ds
dsi
dt = dvs,i(s)
ds
vs,i(s)
(5.43)
This equation can be used to obtain the acceleration function as,i(s) from
vs,i(s).
5.8.2 Path integration
When the acceleration as,i(s) is known as a function of the path coordinate s
instead of as a function of time, the following di↵erential equation needs to be
solved to obtain the velocity vs,i(s):
as,i(s) = dvs,i
dt
= ¨si
(5.44)
After multiplying the equation on both sides by ds, and using that dvs,i
dt ds =
dv dsi
dt = vs,idvs,i the di↵erential equation can be solved by integration:
Z s2
s1
as,ids =
Z v2
v1
vs,idvs,i =
1
2v2
s,i
2v2
v1
= 1
2(v2
2 −v2
1)
(5.45)
Where v1 and v2 are the velocity of the point mass at the positions s1 and s2,
v1 = vs,i(s1) and v2 = vs,i(s2). This equation can be rewritten in a form that
allows ﬁnding vs,i from as,i:
v2
s,i(s2) = v2
s,i(s1) + 2
Z s2
s1
as,i(s)ds
(5.46)
We note that the relation asds = vsdvs that appears under the integrals
in Eq. (5.45) is often useful to simplify expressions for di↵erentiation and
integration with the path coordinate s.
5.8.3 Velocity dependent acceleration
A ﬁnal case that can become of relevance, is when acceleration as,i(v) depends
on velocity. To obtain the velocity as a function of time vs,i(t) one needs to
solve this di↵erential equation:
dvs,i
dt
= as,i(v)
(5.47)

5.8 KINEMATIC ANALYSIS WITH THE PATH COORDINATE S
85
The strategy for solving this kind of ODE is to rearrange all terms such that
terms depending on t are on one side of the equal side and terms depending
on v are on the other side. Here that is done by multiplying both sides by dt
and dividing them by as,i and then integrating:
Z vs
v1
dvs,i
as,i(v) =
Z ts
t1
dt = ts −t1
(5.48)
By evaluating this integral and using the information on the initial condition
at t1, one obtains a function ts(vs), which can be inverted to give the velocity
as a function of time vs(ts). Alternatively, if one is looking for the function
vs(s) it is possible to multiply both sides of the di↵erential equation (5.47) by
ds, divide by as,i and integrate to obtain:
Z vs
v1
dvs,i
as,i(v)vs,i =
Z s
s1
ds0 = s −s1
(5.49)
Using the initial condition this gives s(vs) which can be inverted to obtain
vs(s).
5.8.4 Overview integration and di↵erentiation in kinematics
After having discussed several ways to di↵erentiate and integrate the kinematics
when motion is along a one-dimensional path curve, we provide here an overview
table with all equations for reference.
The equations for integrating and
di↵erentiating between the di↵erent kinematic variables a, v, s and t as a
function of each other are summarised in Table 5.1 below. Please note that the
cases with t as dependent variable are usually the most important. Moreover,
realise that it is better to learn how to properly derive these equations yourself
by integrating and di↵erentiation than to memorise equations.
5.8.5 Numerical di↵erentiation and integration
Often, expressions are too complicated to di↵erentiate or integrate using
analytical equations. However in those cases the integration can usually still
be performed numerically.
• Advantages of numerical methods:
– Can solve almost all problems
– No need to perform (diﬃcult) analytical integration or di↵erentiation
• Disadvantages of numerical methods:

– Gives less insight because only one speciﬁc solution is found, not
the dependence on variables
To numerically determine the time derivative of a known function sA(t),
you determine the position sA at two closely spaced points in time sA(t)
and sA(t + ∆t), with a small time di↵erence ∆t. The simplest numerical
di↵erentiation in formula form is then performed using this equation:
vs,A(t) ⇡sA(t + ∆t) −sA(t)
∆t
(5.50)
This equation can be applied for all values of t to obtain vs,A(t). According
to the deﬁnition of the derivative, this expression becomes exactly correct in
the limit ∆t ! 0 which allows improving the numerical accuracy as much as
needed by reducing the time step ∆t.
If instead the velocity vs,A(t) is known, the position sA can be determined
by numerical time integration by just rewriting the previous equation to:
sA(t + ∆t) = sA(t) + vs,A(t)∆t
(5.51)
This equation can be applied iteratively to obtain sA(t + ∆t) at a next time
from its value sA(t) at a previous time. For example the next step is:
sA(t + 2∆t) = sA(t + ∆t) + vs,A(t + ∆t)∆t
(5.52)
This integration procedure, which is called the Euler forward method, can be
iterated to get the complete numerical integral for sA for all times. Reducing

87
the time step ∆t helps to increase the accuracy. The method can also be
applied to integrate acceleration and velocity vectors, by performing scalar
integration along each of the axes in a Cartesian system like in eq. (5.57).
There are multiple methods for numerically solving integrals and obtaining
derivatives. An important integration method is Euler’s forward method, which
is the simplest but by far not the most eﬃcient and accurate method. To be
sure of a result, it can be a good strategy to solve a problem both analytically
and numerically. Then the numerical solution can function as a plausibility
check for the analytical solution or vice versa.
5.9 Kinematic analysis and coordinate systems
The kinematic analysis presented in the previous sections is valid for any
coordinate system or constraint curve ~rs. We now show how to obtain the 3
dimensional motion in a speciﬁc coordinate system or a speciﬁc path curve
~rs(s) that is expressed in Cartesian or cylindrical coordinates. An important
case is motion along a straight line.
5.9.1 Rectilinear motion
Motion along a straight 1D line is the most simple to analyse. If motion occurs
along the x-coordinate axis in Cartesian coordinates, the path curve pointing
in the positive x-coordinate direction is:
~rs(s) = sˆı
(5.53)
A certain point mass i with path coordinate si is located at position vector
~ri = ~rs(si) = siˆı. Projecting its position on the x-coordinate axis, we ﬁnd that
its x-coordinate is identical to its path coordinate xi = ~ri·ˆı = si. So, essentially
everything that we have derived for si(t) also holds for the x-coordinate xi(t)
of a point mass that moves on a rectilinear path along the x-coordinate axis,
with si = xi, vs,i = ˙xi and as,i = ¨xi, from Eqs. (5.30)–(5.32).
5.9.2 Kinematics in Cartesian coordinates
Cartesian coordinates have the advantage that the direction of the unit vectors
ˆı, ˆ| and ˆk is independent of the coordinates in the system. If the coordinate
system is not rotating (see also Sec. 6.12), the direction of the unit vectors
is also independent of time dˆı
dt = dˆ|
dt = dˆk
dt = ~0. This greatly simpliﬁes the
kinematic analysis and allows describing the motion of a point mass i using its
3 time-dependent coordinates xi, yi and zi and Eqs. (5.28)–(5.29) as follows:

88
5 KINEMATICS OF POINT MASSES
~ri(t)
=
xi(t) ˆı + yi(t) ˆ| + zi(t) ˆk
(5.54)
~vi(t)

˙xi(t) ˆı + ˙yi(t) ˆ| + ˙zi(t) ˆk
(5.55)
~ai(t)
=
¨xi(t) ˆı + ¨yi(t) ˆ| + ¨zi(t) ˆk
(5.56)
It is also possible to integrate the individual functions ¨xi(t), ¨yi(t), ¨zi(t) to
obtain the velocity and position of the point mass when the acceleration is
known, similar to the integrals shown in Eqs. (5.35), (5.36), for the velocity
and acceleration component along the x, y and z-axis:

S Example 5.3
Let us illustrate the kinematic analysis method in Cartesian
coordinates by determining the acceleration and velocity vector of the balloon B in
Fig. 5.9, that moves along a parabolic path curve with yB = c1x2
B in the xy-plane.
The motion of the balloon is described by:
xB(t)

c2t
yB(t)
=
c1c2
2t2
The position vector of the balloon can be di↵erentiated twice, like in Eq. (5.54)

5.9.3 Kinematics in cylindrical coordinates
Cylindrical coordinates, which were introduced in section 3.3.2 are often conve-
nient when the kinematics involves rotation around an axis, like in Fig. 5.10.
The position, velocity and acceleration vector in cylindrical coordinates can be
written as:
~ri
=
⇢i ˆ⇢+ zi ˆk
(5.60)
~vi
=
vi,⇢ˆ⇢+ vi,φ ˆφ + vi,z ˆk
(5.61)
~ai
=
ai,⇢ˆ⇢+ ai,φ ˆφ + ai,z ˆk
(5.62)
Concept. Kinematics in cylindrical coordinates
We will show that by taking the time derivatives of the position vector, the
components of the velocity vector and acceleration vector in Eqs. (5.60–5.62)
are found to be:
vi,⇢
=
˙⇢i
(5.63)
vi,φ
=
⇢i ˙φi
(5.64)
vi,z
=
˙zi
(5.65)
ai,⇢
=
¨⇢i −⇢i ˙φ2
i
(5.66)
ai,φ
=
2 ˙⇢i ˙φi + ⇢i ¨φi
(5.67)
ai,z
=
¨zi
(5.68)
Derivation.
The determination of these velocity and acceleration vectors in cylindrical
coordinates is more diﬃcult because the direction of the unit vectors ˆ⇢and ˆφ
is not constant. To determine their time derivatives, we use that the position
vector can also be expressed in Cartesian unit vectors as:
~ri = ⇢i cos φiˆı + ⇢i sin φiˆ| + ziˆk
(5.69)
From the directions of the unit vectors, as shown in Fig. 5.10, the cylindrical
unit vectors can be expressed in Cartesian unit vectors as:
ˆ⇢
=
cos φiˆı + sin φiˆ|
(5.70)
ˆφ
=
−sin φiˆı + cos φiˆ|
(5.71)

5.9 KINEMATIC ANALYSIS AND COORDINATE SYSTEMS
91
Now it can be seen that the time derivatives of the unit vectors obey (chain
rule):
dˆ⇢
dt
=
(−sin φiˆi + cos φiˆj) ˙φi = ˙φi ˆφ = ~! ⇥ˆ⇢
(5.72)
dˆφ
dt
=
(−cos φiˆi −sin φiˆj) ˙φi = −˙φi ˆ⇢= ~! ⇥ˆφ,
(5.73)
where the terms in brackets were replaced by ˆφ and ˆ⇢using Eqs. (5.70) and
(5.71), and the equations were further simpliﬁed using the vector ~! = ˙φiˆk. We
use these time derivatives of the unit vectors to ﬁnd the velocity and acceleration
in cylindrical coordinates, and the components given in Eqs. (5.63–5.68) by
di↵erentiating twice:
~ri
=
⇢i ˆ⇢+ zi ˆk
(5.74)
~vi
=
d~ri
dt = ˙⇢i ˆ⇢+ ⇢i
dˆ⇢
dt + ˙zi ˆk
(5.75)
=
˙⇢i ˆ⇢+ ⇢i ˙φi ˆφ + ˙zi ˆk
(5.76)
~ai
=
d~vi
dt = ¨⇢iˆ⇢+ ˙⇢i
dˆ⇢
dt + ˙⇢i ˙φi ˆφ + ⇢i ¨φi ˆφ + ⇢i ˙φi
dˆφ
dt + ¨ziˆk
(5.77)
=
(¨⇢i −⇢i ˙φ2
i )ˆ⇢+ (2 ˙⇢i ˙φi + ⇢i ¨φi)ˆφ + ¨ziˆk
(5.78)
The components of these vectors are identical to the equations (5.63–5.68) thus
proving the correctness of those equations.
5.9.4 Circular motion
A special important case of constrained motion on a path curve is motion on a
circle with constant radius ⇢. So, in Fig. 5.10 this means ⇢i = constant. The
components of the velocity and acceleration vector can be found by substituting
˙⇢i = 0 and ¨⇢i = 0 into Eqs. (5.75–5.78) to obtain:
vi,⇢
=
0
(5.79)
vi,φ
=
⇢˙φi = ˙si
(5.80)
ai,⇢
=
−⇢˙φ2
i = −
v2
s,i
⇢
(5.81)
ai,φ
=
⇢¨φi = ˙vs,i = ¨si
(5.82)
It can be seen that the velocity vector only has a component in the ˆφ direction,
tangential to the circle. The acceleration has both a tangential component ai,φ,

92
5 KINEMATICS OF POINT MASSES
and a radial or centripetal component ai,⇢that points towards the centre of
the circle. The time derivatives of the angle !o,i = ˙φi and ↵o,i = ¨φi are called
the orbital angular velocity and orbital angular acceleration of the point mass.
The word orbital is used to distinguish this angular velocity from the angular
velocity of a rigid body, which is sometimes called the spin angular velocity
and will be discussed later in Ch. 9.
5.9.5 Natural t,n,b coordinates for curvilinear motion
Natural coordinates make use of the fact that even if a curved trajectory is
not really a circle, it is possible to approximate it by a circle with radius ⇢
at every point of the trajectory, as shown in Fig. 5.11. Like in the previous
subsection, a cylindrical coordinate system can be chosen such that the centre
of that circle (the centre of curvature Oi) is at the origin and the point mass
position is determined by a path coordinate si = ⇢φi, where ⇢is called the
radius of curvature. The plane in which the instantaneous circle is positioned
is called the osculating plane. For an instantaneous moment, the motion of the
point mass can be described using natural coordinates or t, n, b coordinates,
that are deﬁned by a unit vector ˆt that is tangential to the curvilinear path2,
a normal unit vector ˆn that points towards the centre of the instantaneous
circle and a binormal unit vector ˆb = ˆt ⇥ˆn, that points perpendicular to
the osculating plane. At every instant of time the path curve can have a
di↵erent origin O and radius ⇢. Note that in Fig. 5.11 the origin changes from
point O1 to O2. As a consequence, at times t1 and times t3, the directions of
both the ˆn and ˆb unit vectors have ﬂipped because the motion changed from
anti-clockwise to clockwise, even though the tangential unit vector ˆt is the
same. In t,n,b coordinates, the components of the instantaneous velocity vector
are ~vi = vi,tˆt + vi,n ˆn and the acceleration vector is ~ai = ai,tˆt + ai,n ˆn. Note
the sign change ai,n = −ai,⇢compared to Eq. (5.81), because ˆn points inward,
while ˆ⇢points away from the rotation axis. The velocity and acceleration
components are:
vi,t
=
˙si
(5.83)
vi,n
=
0
(5.84)
ai,t
=
˙vs,i = ¨si
(5.85)
ai,n
=
v2
s,i/⇢
(5.86)
2The unit vector ˆt is identical to the unit vector ˆs in path coordinates. If the curvilinear
motion is a counterclockwise circle around the z-axis one also has ˆb = ˆk, ˆt = ˆ✓and
ˆn = −ˆ⇢in cylindrical coordinates.

5 KINEMATICS OF POINT MASSES
Velocity and acceleration along the ˆb direction are always zero. Note that these
equations are very similar to those for circular motion, except for the minus
sign in Eq. (5.81). The radius ⇢can change continuously along the curvilinear
path and needs to be determined at every point of the curve in order to use
these equations to determine the given velocity and acceleration components.
Furthermore, because they do not have a ﬁxed origin, natural coordinates
are not used for describing positions, and are therefore not a replacement for
Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates.
5.9.6 Summary parametrised motion and kinematics
After having discussed kinematics in di↵erent coordinate systems we conclude
by summarising the di↵erent ways these coordinates allow us to parametrise
motion in 3D and obtain the kinematics. Depending on the situation, the time
dependent motion ~r(t) can be fully described either using 3 time dependent
coordinate functions x(t), y(t), z(t), or using the path curve ~rs(s) = x(s)ˆı +
y(s)ˆ| + z(s)ˆk and a single time dependent coordinate function s(t):
Parametrisations of motion and determination of ~v and ~a
• The time dependent coordinate functions
1. Cartesian coordinate functions x(t) and y(t).
–Use methods from Sec. 5.9.2 to obtain ~v and ~a.
2. Cylindrical coordinate functions ⇢(t) and φ(t).
–Use methods from Sec. 5.9.3 to obtain ~v and ~a.
–First convert to Cartesian coordinates using x(t) = ⇢(t) cos φ(t) and
y(t) = ⇢(t) sin φ(t), and proceed like in 1.
• The path curve and one coordinate function of time
3. Cartesian path curve x(s), y(s), and path coordinate s(t).
–Use methods from Sec. 5.8 to determine the path velocity vs, and tan-
gential component of acceleration as from s(t).
–Use t, n, b coordinates (Sec. 5.9.5) to obtain the normal component of
acceleration an by ﬁrst determining the local path radius ⇢.
–Alternatively one can determine x(t) = x(s(t)), y(t) = y(s(t)) and
proceed like in 1.
4. Cartesian path curve y(x) and coordinate function x(t).
–Determine the function y(t) = y(x(t)) and use method 1.
5. Cylindrical path curve ⇢(s), φ(s) and path coordinate s(t).
–Proceed using s(t) and t, n, b coordinates like in 3.
–Use x(t) = ⇢(s(t)) cos φ(s(t)) and y(t) = ⇢(s(t)) sin φ(s(t)), and proceed

5.9 KINEMATIC ANALYSIS AND COORDINATE SYSTEMS
95
like in 1.
6. Cylindrical path curve ⇢(φ) and coordinate function φ(t).
–Determine the function ⇢(t) = ⇢(φ(t)) and use method 2.
As becomes clear from this list, there are often multiple methods to determine
the velocity and acceleration from given kinematic information. However,
some methods might be much more mathematically complex than others. It
is therefore useful to become familiar with the di↵erent methods, and get
experience in choosing the easiest one in a certain situation.
5.9.7 Determining the path coordinate*
We note that it is also possible to determine the path coordinate s(t) by going
from parametrisation 4 to 3. For that purpose you use that it holds from
Pythagoras’ theorem that the distance ds along a straight inﬁnitesimal line
element obeys ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2, such that s(t) can be determined using
the integral:
s(t) =
Z s(t)
0
ds =
Z x(t)
0
s

✓dy
dx
◆2

(5.87)
For example if we deal with motion at constant speed along a straight tilted
line, y = ↵x, and x(t) = vxt then we have:
s(t) =
Z vxt
0
p
1 + ↵2dx =
p
1 + ↵2 ⇥vxt
(5.88)
Noting that the y velocity component is vy = ˙y = dy
dx ˙x = ↵vx, we see that the
path velocity vs = ˙s =
p
1 + ↵2 ⇥vx =
q
v2x + v2y as expected.
5.9.8 Determining ⇢, the radius of curvature*
When working with natural t, n, b coordinates, one needs to know the local
radius of curvature ⇢at each position to determine the velocity and acceleration
components using (5.83-5.86). However, determining the radius of curvature ⇢
is not always easy. For a path curve in the xy-plane that can be written in the
form y(x), the instantaneous radius ⇢can be determined using this convenient
function:

5.10 Segmented kinematics
Sometimes motion occurs in di↵erent time segments or space segments. For
example a car might accelerate, and at a certain time t1 it brakes and continues
at a constant velocity (see Fig. 5.12). This kind of motion is called segmented
motion and can be described by segmented or piece-wise functions like this:
sA(t) =
(
f1(t)
t t1
f2(t)
t > t1
(5.98)
The velocity and acceleration can be found by di↵erentiation on the di↵erent
segments as follows:
vs,A(t) = ˙sA(t) =
( ˙f1(t)
t t1
˙f2(t)
t > t1
(5.99)
as,A(t) = ¨sA(t) =

98
5 KINEMATICS OF POINT MASSES
The procedure is similar if the motion is segmented along the path coordinate
s instead of time t, using functions f1(s) and f2(s).
When integrating the segmented motion, one proceeds by integrating of the
ﬁrst segment, and then taking the end position and velocity of the ﬁrst segment
as initial condition for the integration of the next segment. It is important to
note that it is impossible for a point mass to instantaneously ’jump’ or ’teleport’
in space. For that reason f1(t1) = f2(t1) needs to be obeyed. Moreover, from
Newton’s second law and the inertia of mass, we know that it also takes time
to change the velocity of an object. Therefore often also ˙f1(t1) = ˙f2(t1) holds
for the velocities to be equal at the interface between the segments. There are
exceptions in cases like collisions, where very high forces occur, such that the
accelerations are so high that a substantial velocity change can occur suddenly.

di↵erentiation.
In the next chapter we will discuss the kinetics of point masses, deriving
their dynamics from the e↵ect of forces via Newton’s second law.

6 Kinetics of Point Masses
In the previous chapter we have discussed and developed a toolbox to analyse the
kinematics of point masses, determining their motion, velocity and acceleration
in various coordinate systems.
In this chapter we extend our toolbox by
determining the e↵ect of forces on acceleration, thus analysing the kinetics of
point masses.
The outline of this chapter is as follows. We ﬁrst introduce Newton’s second
law (Sec. 6.1) and use it to deﬁne mass (Sec. 6.2). We deﬁne force vectors
and their properties governed by Newton’s third law (Sec. 6.3). Then we
describe in detail the step-by-step procedure (Sec. 6.4) to determine and solve
the equations of motion. The procedure starts from a sketch (Sec. 6.5) and
choosing the coordinate system (Sec. 6.6).
Then constraint equations are
determined, free body diagrams are used to determine the resultant forces, and
Newton’s second law is used to determine the equations of motion along each
coordinate axis (Sec. 6.7-6.10), which are then solved (Sec. 6.11.1) to obtain
the motion or forces (Sec. 6.11.2). Inertial reference frames are introduced
(Sec. 6.12) and ﬁnally we discuss the properties of various forces (Sec. 6.13).
6.1 Newton’s second law
Almost all motion and dynamics you see around you can be derived from
Newton’s second law and the characteristics of the four fundamental forces
of nature. It is amazing that so many phenomena in our daily life can be
described by such a deceptively simple equation. There are several reasons for
this. First of all, Newton’s laws are not as simple as they seem, and require
careful use of vectors, mathematics and kinematic techniques. Secondly, the
force term can have many di↵erent appearances, leading to a wide variety of
motion, and thirdly, most importantly, dynamics can become very complex
and diﬃcult to predict when many point masses are present.
Let us have a closer look at Newton’s second law, Eq. (4.2):
X
j
~F ij = mi~ai
(6.1)

102
6 KINETICS OF POINT MASSES
We know from the previous chapter how to interpret the acceleration vector
~ai, however what is the precise meaning of the scalar mass mi and the force
vectors ~F ij?
6.2 Deﬁning mass
Deﬁnition. Mass
What is the mass of an object? Newton’s second law tells us that if there is a
constant force ~F ref acting on the object, and we measure an acceleration vector
~ai, the object’s mass is given by:
mi ⌘|~F ref|
|~ai| ,
(6.2)
where we used the ⌘sign to indicate that this is the deﬁnition of the mass,
or inertial mass, of the object. The object’s mass obeys Eq. (6.2) irrespective
of the properties of the force ~F ref, and is thus an intrinsic property of the
object that normally does not change. To assign a value to the mass we use
the international systems of units, the SI units. The previous equation tells us
that if we apply a force of 1 N and observe an acceleration of 1 m/s2, the mass
of the object is 1 kg.

6.2.1 Weight of a mass
Since measuring accelerations is not always easy, in practice we often determine
the mass of an object via the gravitational force acting on the object, e.g.
by using a weighing scale. This is possible because it was experimentally
determined that the gravitational force on earth is proportional to the mass of
the object: ~F i,g = mi~g. The magnitude of the gravitational force on the object
on earth’s surface is deﬁned as the weight W of the object, so we can write:

6.3 WHAT IS FORCE?
103
Wi ⌘mi|~g|
(6.3)
Here, the gravitational acceleration vector ~g has a magnitude of approxi-
mately 9.8 m/s2 on earth and points towards the center of the earth. The grav-
itational mass of an object can be determined using the equation mi = Wi/|~g|
and has experimentally been found to be equal to its inertial mass as determined
from Newton’s second law.
6.2.2 Point mass
Concept. Point mass
A point mass i is an object that behaves like a mathematical point in space at
position vector ~ri and has mass mi.
Since it is located at a single point, a point mass can only have a single
position, velocity and acceleration vector. The point mass is an important
concept, because Newton’s laws strictly only hold for point masses. Moreover,
the smallest known particles, the elementary particles, behave very similar
to point masses, and all larger objects are made out of elementary particles.
Also, as we will see, the dynamics of larger objects can often still be well
approximated by treating them as a point mass, therefore the term point mass
is also used for larger objects that move like a point mass, e.g. because they
do not rotate.
6.3 What is force?
6.3.1 Force and Newton’s second law
Deﬁnition. Force
Just like mass, the concept of force can be deﬁned1 via Newton’s second law:
X
j
~F ij ⌘mi~ai
(6.4)
So if an object with mass mi is observed to accelerate with an acceleration
vector ~ai, Newton’s second law tells us that the sum of the force vectors acting
1One might ask how it is possible to deﬁne both mass and force from Newton’s second law.
The answer is that mass is a property of the object that accelerates, whereas forces are
due to interactions between objects. By properly designed experiments the characteristics
of the force and mass can be determined independently in most cases.

104
6 KINETICS OF POINT MASSES
on the object is P
i ~F ij. To determine individual force vectors ~F ij (instead of
their sum) one should perform experiments where only one force is acting on
mi.
6.3.2 Force and Newton’s third law
Newton’s third law gives us information on the way forces act, since it holds
for all known forces. It states that all (fundamental) forces act between two
point masses. If there are two point masses mi and mj, the force vector ~F ij
generated on mass mi by mass mj is always equal in magnitude and opposite
in direction to another force vector ~F ji that is generated on mj by mass mi.
In vector notation, as shown in Fig. 6.2:
~F ij = −~F ji
(6.5)
Moreover, these two force vectors are collinear (i.e. have the same line of action)
to the relative position vector ~rj/i = ~rj −~ri connecting the two point masses.
Newton’s third law, Eq. (6.5), also shows us that a force ~F ij can never exist
alone, and is always accompanied by a reaction force ~F ji acting on another
point mass, which sometimes can be left out of the analysis for simplicity. In
words Newton’s third law is often stated as ‘action force is equal and opposite
to reaction force’.

Figure 6.2: The third law of Newton states that for every force vector ~F ij that acts on a
point mass i, there is another force ~F ji that acts on another point mass. These
two force vectors have equal magnitude, are collinear and have opposite direction
(~F ji = −~F ij)
.

6.4 PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINING THE EOM
105
6.3.3 Properties of forces
Newton’s third law tells us something about the properties of forces between
point masses. There are only four known fundamental forces, which are the
gravitational force, the Coulomb force, the weak nuclear force and the strong
nuclear force. Furthermore, there are many mechanisms and phenomena, which
can result in a variety of forces and force characteristics like spring forces and
contact forces. Some of these forces will be discussed in Sec. 6.13.
6.4 Procedure for determining the EoM
After obtaining a thorough understanding of kinematics, Newton’s laws, mass
and force, we are now in the position to predict the motion of point masses under
the inﬂuence of forces, the essence of kinetics. The procedure to determine and
solve the equations of motion can be subdivided in the following steps:
1. Sketch the point masses, massless mechanisms, force vectors and con-
straints
2. Choose and draw a suitable coordinate system (CS)
3. Determine the constraint equations
4. Draw the free-body diagram (FBD) for each object
5. Determine the equations of motion per object using Newton’s second law
6. Solve the equations of motion (EoM) in the presence of constraints
We will discuss these steps in more detail in the following sections.
6.5 Sketch of the dynamic system
Before analysing the dynamics, it is important to make a sketch for a good
overview of the dynamic system and the interactions between the di↵erent
objects. Such a sketch, like shown in Fig. 6.3, should include the following
elements:
• Constraining objects
• Massless mechanisms
• Objects with mass
• Forces vectors with points of action
• Labels
• Direction of the gravitational acceleration vector ~g (if present)
• Distances, angles and position vectors

106
6 KINETICS OF POINT MASSES
• Coordinate systems and unit vectors
We will now discuss these di↵erent elements, starting with three di↵erent
types of objects: constraining objects (like walls), objects with mass (like point
masses) and massless mechanisms.

Figure 6.3: Sketch of a point mass A sliding along a slope.
6.5.1 Constraining objects
In the sketch, ﬁrst draw all the constraining objects. These are the objects or
structures that constrain the motion of other objects in the system. Constrain-
ing objects can either have a constant position, like walls, ground, ceiling and
rails, but can also move, like elevators, drive shafts and carousels. In Fig. 6.3,
the grey sloped surface is a constraining object. Since the time dependent mo-
tion of these constraining objects is fully known, Newton’s second law doesn’t
have to be applied to them. This is normally also not possible since the mass
of the constraining objects is usually not given. The e↵ect of constraining
objects can be described by constraint equations (Sec. 5.2).
6.5.2 Objects with mass
Secondly draw the masses at an arbitrarily chosen position and angle that
satisﬁes the constraints.
Important: when choosing such an arbitrary position, make sure to select
a generic, non-trivial position, for which all relevant forces are non-zero and
have, if possible, non-zero components along the coordinate axes. For example,
when drawing a pendulum, a mass suspended by a string, do not draw it in

6.5 SKETCH OF THE DYNAMIC SYSTEM
107
the lowest position, since then there will be no horizontal component of the
string force.
6.5.3 Massless mechanisms
Finally draw the massless mechanisms, these are mechanisms with zero or
negligible mass, which can generate non-zero forces on point masses and
constraining objects via mechanical connections. Examples include massless
ropes, springs, rods, wheels, pulleys, gears and crankshafts and will be discussed
in Sec. 6.13.6.
6.5.4 Force vectors
After all objects and mechanisms have been sketched, the force vectors can be
sketched according to the guidelines in Sec. 3.2.4. We distinguish 3 types of
force vectors:
1. Force vectors at contact points. Newton’s third law holds for all forces,
such that 2 force vectors should be drawn at each contact point between
2 objects and/or mechanisms: The force vector exerted by object 1 on
object 2, and the (equal and opposite) force vector from object 2 on
object 1. In Fig. 6.3 the forces ~F A,N and ~F A,f are force vectors that act
on A at contact point C. Note that we often only draw the force vectors
acting on objects for which we want to apply Newton’s second law.
2. Contactless forces acting at a distance. Certain forces, like the gravi-
tational force and the Coulomb force can act between 2 objects over a
distance, without requiring mechanical contact. In Fig. 6.3 the gravita-
tional force ~F A,g is a force with as point-of-action G, the center-of-mass
of A.
6.5.5 Labelling objects and vectors
After drawing all objects and vectors, it is important to label them uniquely,
since these labels link the sketch to the mathematics that you will use to solve
the dynamics. Either letters, numbers or combinations of letters and numbers
can be used as labels (see Sec. 10.7.2). For instance in Fig. 6.3 you have point
mass A with mass mA. Force vectors can be labelled with two subscripts, the
ﬁrst indicates the object on which the force acts and the second indicates the
object or type of force which generates the force, e.g. ~F A,N is the normal force
on A, ~F A,g the gravitational force and ~F A,f the friction force.

108
6 KINETICS OF POINT MASSES
6.6 Choose and draw coordinate systems
After and while sketching the objects and forces, one or more relevant coordinate
systems should be chosen. The choice of the coordinate system (CS) and its
orientation is important, since a smart choice can signiﬁcantly simplify the
analysis. In most cases Cartesian coordinates are preferred. If you know
the direction of a force (like the gravitational force or the contact force with
the ground), it is often smart to align one of the coordinate axes with that
force. Cylindrical coordinates are useful when objects rotate about a ﬁxed
rotation axis and t, n, b coordinates can be useful when point masses move
along a constrained path, e.g. via a constraining rail object. In some cases
a combination of coordinate systems can be used. In Fig. 6.3 one can use
Cartesian coordinates and align the y-axis with the gravitational acceleration
vector, however one can also choose to use natural t, n, b coordinates with
path coordinate s. For demonstration, both are shown in the ﬁgure. It will
become clear that in this situation t, n, b coordinates are easier to use2. After
having chosen the CS it is drawn in the sketch with unit vectors according the
guidelines from Sec. 3.3.
6.7 Determine the constraint equations
From the sketch and the coordinate system the constraint equations can be
determined, like discussed in Sec. 5.2. In Fig. 6.3 we know that block A always
touches the slope with angle ↵at point A = C. Since we have tan ↵=
yA
xA,0−xA ,
where xA,0 is the coordinate at which the slope crosses the x-axis, we can
determine the constraint equation and its time derivatives as:
yA
=
(xA,0 −xA) tan ↵
(6.6)
˙yA
=
−˙xA tan ↵
(6.7)
¨yA
=
−¨xA tan ↵
(6.8)
We can also use natural coordinates to express the constraint equations. It
follows from Eq. (5.84) and Eq. (5.86) with radius of curvature ⇢= 1 because
the slope is a straight line that the constraint equations then become:
vA,n
=
0
(6.9)
aA,n
=
0
(6.10)
2Drawing the x-axis parallel to the slope would also have simpliﬁed the problem, so also
consider rotating your coordinate system to facilitate calculations.

6.8 DRAWING THE FREE-BODY DIAGRAM
109
6.8 Drawing the free-body diagram
The free-body diagram (FBD) is a drawing of an object (=body) or a set of
objects, isolated from their surroundings and all force vectors and moment
vectors that act on it.
Its main purpose is to determine the sum of the
force vectors P ~F . The word free indicates that the object is cut free from
surrounding objects, and all e↵ects of the surroundings are represented by
force and moment vectors. A key purpose of an FBD is to deﬁne the di↵erence
between internal and external forces, since all objects drawn in the FBD can
be considered to be internal and their forces should not be drawn, whereas all
drawn forces are external forces generated by objects that are external and
not drawn. Although we will focus on the FBD for single point masses in this
chapter, we will later also consider FBDs of objects and rigid bodies consisting
of many point masses.
If a good sketch has been made in the previous steps, drawing the FBD is
straightforward: draw the object, and draw all force vectors that act on the
object just like they were drawn in the sketch. An example is given in Fig. 6.4.
Also provide the unit vectors, which are used to obtain the force components
by projection.

6.8.1 Drawing the FBD
To draw the FBD we follow the methodology as described in Vallery and
Schwab [9]. This description already includes the elements in the FBD needed
for rigid bodies in the presence of moments that will be introduced in Ch. 10.

110
6 KINETICS OF POINT MASSES
• Draw the system in a free state, i.e. ”cut” the system at convenient
locations. Don’t draw objects that do not belong to the system. Draw
outlined shapes of the separate pieces belonging to the system. Each cut
at a contact point can introduce new external action-reaction forces at
the system boundaries. Some helpful guidelines:
a) Always draw the system in a generic state. So, for example, if you
draw the FBD of a pendulum, do not draw it in the vertical position,
since in that position the horizontal component of the force in the rope
is zero, while it is not always zero.
b) Whenever possible, choose your system boundaries such that you
expose only action-reaction forces that you are actually interested in
calculating, or that are easily determined from the information you have.
Otherwise, extra equations and unknowns are introduced, complicating
calculations.
• Draw a 3D coordinate system with a clearly deﬁned position for the
origin O. Check if rotating and/or translating the coordinate system can
make things easier, and if Cartesian or cylindrical coordinate systems
makes the analysis simplest. Consider drawing the three unit vectors. If
the coordinate system is already clear from the sketch it may be omitted
in the FBD.
• Some rules for drawing forces and moments in a FBD:
a) Do not show internal forces or moments.
b) If a connection prevents movement or rotation in a particular
direction, then forces/moments are drawn to represent that restriction.
c) If a rigid segment is split in two, the forces and moments acting
on the two segments in the separated FBDs are equal in magnitude and
opposite in direction.
d) Forces acting on a rigid body may be shifted along their lines of
action (see sliding vectors in Ch. 3).
e) Couple moments acting on a rigid body may be placed anywhere
(they are free vectors).
f) Only draw moment vectors if the forces that generate them are
not drawn to prevent double counting of forces or moments.
g) Projections of forces on the coordinate axes can be drawn in a
FBD, but should be uniquely labelled as such (e.g. Fg,x and Fg,y), and
use dashed arrows to distinguish them from the original force.
h) Draw the arrows of the force vector in the expected direction of
the force.
• Indicate and label all known and unknown external force vectors and
moment vectors that act on the system uniquely, and place dots at the

6.8 DRAWING THE FREE-BODY DIAGRAM
111
correct points of action and reference points. Decide on the preferred
vector notation method Sec. 3.2.4.
• Label relevant dimensions, distances, angles and relative position vectors.
The main goal of these guidelines is that an FBD should include all relevant
information needed to correctly establish the sums of forces and moments that
will later be used to determine the equations of motion.
6.8.2 Common errors in drawing FBDs
To help you generate proper FBDs, we list errors that often occur in drawing
FBDs.
• Drawing internal forces.
• Drawing forces generated by the free body (e.g. on the constraints). Only
the external forces acting on the free body should be drawn.
• Drawing the same force twice.
Both drawing the force and its moment (can lead to double counting).
Drawing both the vector and its projection on the axes without
clearly di↵erentiating them, e.g. with dashed lines (can lead to double
counting).
• Drawing velocity or acceleration vectors in an FBD without clearly
distinguishing them from the forces.
• Drawing objects that do not belong to the free body in the FBD.
• Forgetting to draw forces generated by constraints on the body.
• Forgetting gravity or other forces.
• Forgetting to draw or indicate a coordinate system or unit vector direc-
tions.
• Drawing the FBD in a non-generic (=trivial) state or equilibrium position
(see previous subsection), such that certain force components or angles
become zero, while they are not always zero.
• Using scalar unsigned magnitude notation (e.g. FA see Ch. 3), for a force
of which the direction is unknown or time-dependent.
• Drawing resultant or sums of vectors like ~F tot (leads to double counting).
Each individual physical force vector needs to be drawn as a separate
vector.
• Already using Newton’s laws to determine the value of forces, e.g. writing
mgˆ| for the normal force, instead of keeping it as an unknown and
determining it from Newton’s laws.
• Drawing a vector m~a. Acceleration is a result of force, but is not the
force itself. An FBD should only contain the physical forces acting on

112
6 KINETICS OF POINT MASSES
the free body.
• Drawing virtual or pseudo force vectors, based on assumed motions like
the centrifugal (or centripetal) force in rotations. Only forces resulting
from physical interactions between objects can be drawn in the FBD,
since it is the purpose of the FBD to determine the sum of forces and
use that to determine the motion.
6.9 Force expressions and projections
Now we express the forces drawn in the FBD in the form of equations. For the
forces in Fig. 6.4, assuming a kinetic friction coeﬃcient µk during the sliding
motion we get:
~F A,g
=
−mAgˆ|
(6.11)
~F A,N
=
FN ˆn
(6.12)
~F A,f
=
−µkFNˆt
(6.13)
Projecting the force vectors
After having drawn the object and force vectors in the FBD, we need their
scalar components to evaluate Newton’s second law along each axis. We thus
project the forces on the coordinate system (CS) that was selected in the
previous section and was drawn in the sketch and/or FBD. This is done using
the method described in Sec. 3.2.5, and shown in Fig. 6.5. For example we get
the x component of the vector ~F A,f using FA,f,x = ~F A,f · ˆı.
As projected components of ~F g we obtain:
FA,g,t
=
mAg sin ↵
(6.14)
FA,g,n
=
−mAg cos ↵
(6.15)
6.10 Obtaining the equations of motion
After thorough preparation, we are now in the position to fully evaluate
Newton’s second law to obtain the equations of motion using the following
steps.
1. Add the force components from the FBD along each of the axes.
2. Apply ~F = m~a along each of the axes.
3. Express the components of the acceleration vector in terms of the position
coordinates and their time derivatives using kinematics (see Sec. 5.9).

are put in front of the labels of dashed arrows that point in the negative axis
direction to conform to the conventions of drawing vectors with a scalar label in
Sec. 3.2.2.
4. Simplify the EoM by using the constraint equations and combining the
scalar equations along the axes directions.
S Example 6.1 As an example of this procedure we apply it to obtain the EoM
of the block A in Fig. 6.4 using natural coordinates, and the projected forces from
the previous section. We obtain three scalar equations of motion.

(6.18)
where we used Eq. (5.85) and Eq. (5.86) to obtain the acceleration components in
t, n, b coordinates. We see that the sum of forces in the ˆb direction is zero, such that
¨zA is zero. We uses the constraint equation Eq. (6.10) to ﬁnd that aA,n = 0, which
implies that the sum of the forces in that direction is also zero. From that condition
we ﬁnd the equation for the normal forcea to be FN = mAg cos ↵. By substituting
this equation into Eq. (6.16) we obtain the EoM along the ˆt direction:

6 KINETICS OF POINT MASSES
where we deﬁne a0 as the constant acceleration along the path coordinate. The same
result could have been obtained by using Cartesian coordinates, but this would have
been more complicated mathematically.
aIt is very important that in dynamics the normal forces are determined from the
combination of EoM and constraint equations.
6.11 Equations of motion in kinetics
6.11.1 Solving the equations of motion
The goal of solving the equations of motion is to obtain the position vectors
~ri(t) of all objects i at all times t for given initial conditions. Solving these
equations is part of kinematics and was already discussed in Ch. 5. We will
brieﬂy repeat the procedure here for the example from the previous section.
Since Newton’s second law gives us an expression for the acceleration ~a(t),
the main challenge in solving the EoMs is to determine the time dependent
position vector ~r(t) of an object from the acceleration ~a(t). Often this can
be done using the kinematic integration techniques that we have discussed in
the previous chapter. In some cases more complex di↵erential equations, that
cannot be solved by integration appear, as will be discussed in Ch. 13.
As an example we consider the block A in Fig. 6.4. We know from the
constraint equations that aA,n = 0 and aA,b = 0. So, we only need to determine
the motion sA(t) along the path coordinate. For a certain initial condition
sA(0) = s0 and ˙sA(0) = v0, we integrate the equation of motion twice to obtain
the motion as follows 6.21:
vA(t)
=
v0 +
Z t
0
a0dt = v0 + a0t
(6.22)
sA(t)
=
s0 +
Z t
0
(v0 + a0t)dt = 1
2a0t2 + v0t,
(6.23)
where a0 was obtained from the EoM in Eq. (6.21).
6.11.2 Determining forces from the EoM
Besides using the EoM to determine the motion from known forces, it is also
possible to substitute knowledge of the motion into the equation of motion,
to determine unknown forces using the EoM. Essentially, this method follows
directly from Newton’s second law P ~F = m~a, where the sum of forces can be
determined if the mass m and acceleration ~a are known. Note that since the

6.12 RELATIVE MOTION AND INERTIAL REFERENCE FRAMES
115
sum of forces is obtained, if more than one force acts on the mass, this equation
allows only obtaining one unknown force vector or 3 scalar force components.
An example of how forces can be determined from knowledge of the acceler-
ation was already given in Example 6.1, where we determined in Eq. (6.17) the
contact force FN by combining the knowledge that the acceleration component
perpendicular to the slope was zero (aA,n = 0) and the knowledge of the mass
and gravitational force. This is a powerful way to study and quantify forces.
6.12 Relative motion and inertial reference frames
We will now discuss what happens if two persons (observers), that move relative
to each other, both apply Newton’s laws. We ﬁrst introduce the concept of a
reference frame.
Concept. Reference frame
The points that are chosen to have zero velocity and acceleration are called the
reference frame of an observer. Velocities and accelerations of objects can be
measured with respect to the reference frame by choosing a coordinate system
that is ﬁxed with respect to the reference frame.
To illustrate the situation of two observers using di↵erent reference frames,
consider two boats A and B that move with position vectors ~rA(t) and ~rB(t)
relative to an origin O that is ﬁxed to the quay reference system (see Fig. 6.6).
Observer O stands on the quay and uses an x, y, z coordinate system that
is ﬁxed in the quay reference frame. A second observer A on boat A uses
coordinate system x0, y0, z0 with origin A, that is ﬁxed to boat A’s reference
frame. While the position of boat B in O’s reference system is ~rB(t), in A’s
reference system it is given by:
~r0
B(t) = ~rB/A(t) = ~rB(t) −~rA(t)
(6.24)
By taking the time derivatives of Eq. (6.24), the velocity and acceleration of
boat B in A’s reference frame can be determined:
~v0
B(t)
=
~vB/A(t) = ~vB(t) −~vA(t)
(6.25)
~a0
B(t)
=
~aB/A(t) = ~aB(t) −~aA(t)
(6.26)
So observer O will conclude that the acceleration of boat B is ~aB, and observer
A will conclude that the acceleration of boat B is ~a0
B = ~aB/A. When both
observers apply Newton’s laws to boat B observer O will ﬁnd that the total
force acting on boat B is ~F B = ~aB/mB and observer A ﬁnds that the force is

Figure 6.6: Newton’s laws do not hold for an accelerating reference frame (~aA 6= 0) because
one ﬁnds di↵erent acceleration vectors for boat B using such a system: ~aB 6=
~a0
B = ~aB/A. Such a frame ﬁxed to an accelerating boat A is therefore not an
IRF.
~F B = ~a0
B/mB. Of course the force acting on boat B cannot depend on the
acceleration of boat A. Both observers should therefore ﬁnd the same value for
~F B, which is only true if ~aB = ~a0
B = ~aB/A. This only holds if the acceleration
of boat A in O’s reference system is zero: ~aA = ~0.
Inertial reference frames and pseudo forces
From this argumentation we conclude that Newton’s second law cannot be
valid in all reference frames, but only in special reference frames that we call
inertial reference frames.
Concept. Inertial reference frame (IRF)
An inertial reference frame is a reference frame in which Newton’s second law
is valid. It is a reference frame which does not accelerate or rotate substantially
(relative to distant stars).
One might ask, how can observer A check if she is in an IRF? She can do so
by testing if Newton’s second law holds in her reference frame, by positioning
a point mass at a ﬁxed position in the boat without any forces acting on it. If
the mass accelerates in the absence of forces, the observer knows that she is not
in an IRF. From the observed acceleration, observer A might conclude, based
on Newton’s second law, that a kind of force is acting on the mass. However,
since there are no interactions this force is not a real force, instead it is a
ﬁctitious force that is called a pseudo force, since it is only observed because

6.13 FORCES AND CONSTRAINTS
117
the experiment is performed in an accelerating reference frame instead of an
IRF. Examples of such pseudo forces are the e↵ect pulling you forward when a
car brakes and the centrifugal ’force’ that pulls you radially when a car takes a
turn. Unless explicitly mentioned, for the rest of this textbook we only deal
with dynamics in inertial reference frames (IRFs).
6.13 Forces and constraints
In this section we discuss the properties of some of the most relevant forces
and constraints that can occur in dynamics, as have been experimentally
approximately determined using Newton’s laws.
6.13.1 Gravitational force
The gravitational force is important, because it acts on every point mass,
and because it is the most prominent force that acts over a distance. In this
textbook we focus on the dynamics of objects on or near the surface of the
earth, and therefore we can often assume a constant distance to the earth’s
centre. In this case the gravitational force vector on a mass mi can be described
by
~F i,g = mi~g,
(6.27)
where ~g is the gravitational acceleration vector with magnitude g = |~g| ⇡
9.8 m/s2 that points downward in the direction of the centre of the earth.
6.13.2 Contact force
At a point C where the surfaces of two objects touch, the atoms in the objects
can generate a contact force vector ~F C. One can deﬁne a contact plane through
C that is tangential to the surface of the objects. Then, like shown in Fig. 6.3,
the component of the contact force ~F C perpendicular to this plane is called
the normal force ~F N, and the component parallel to the contact plane is the
called the friction force ~F f. So, it always holds that ~F C = ~F N + ~F f, and it is
allowed to draw and treat the contact force as a single vector ~F C. However,
since the expressions for ~F N and ~F f are di↵erent, it can be useful to split
them. Let us now discuss the normal forces and friction forces separately.

6.13.3 Normal force
Normal forces are the result of repulsive Coulomb forces and quantum mechan-
ical e↵ects. By deﬁnition, the normal force vector ~F N points perpendicular to
the contact plane. Normal forces can be calculated by combining Newton’s
laws with constraint equations. If the contact surface is ﬂat, the constraint
equations for the motion components normal to the surface simplify to vn = 0
and an = 0, otherwise one needs to use Eq. (5.86). An example of how to
determine the normal force FN from the EoM was given in Eq. (6.10) and
Eq. (6.17), where the movement of block A was constrained by the slope.
6.13.4 Friction force
The friction force is the component of the contact force tangential to the contact
plane. We distinguish static or kinetic friction forces, which are characterised
by a static µs and kinetic µk friction coeﬃcient with µs ≥µk > 0. We now
consider the friction force between two points A and B on di↵erent objects
that are in contact.
Static friction
The static friction acting on point A is best described by this constraint
equation:
(
aA/B,t = 0
if |~F A,fs| µs|FA,N| and ~vA/B = ~0
otherwise use kinetic friction
(6.28)
The ﬁrst condition for static friction is that the points A and B are not
moving relative to each other ~vA/B = 0. In that case Eq. (6.28) states that the
tangential component of acceleration of point A is zero (aA/B,t = 0) as long as
the friction force |~F A,fs| needed to satisfy that constraint equation does not
exceed the maximum static friction force FA,fs,max = µs|FA,N|, where FA,N is
the normal force on A. In practice the EoM in the presence of the constraint
aA/B,t = 0 needs to be solved to determine the friction force ~F A,fs after which
it is checked if the static friction condition holds. If it does not hold, point A
will accelerate and kinetic friction can be used.
Kinetic friction
When the points A and B slide or slip along each other, a kinetic friction force
acts on A. The kinetic friction force vector ~F A,fk is tangential to the plane of

6.13 FORCES AND CONSTRAINTS
119
contact and points opposite to the direction of the relative velocity vector:
~F A,fk =
(
−µk|~F A,N|ˆvA/B
if ~vA/B 6= 0 or |~F A,fs| > µs|FA,N|
otherwise use static friction
(6.29)
Solving problems with friction
If it is not known whether one should deal with static or kinetic friction, and/or
if the direction of the velocity is not known in a kinetic friction situation, the
following procedure can be used to solve the problem step by step:
1. Determine the normal contact force FN using constraint equations and
the EoMs, like in Eq. (6.17).
2. Assume that the relative velocity is zero ~vA/B = ~0 and use the constraint
equation aA/B,t = 0 to determine the static friction force ~F A,fs from the
EoMs.
3. Check if |~F A,fs| µsFN. If that is true, the static friction assumption is
correct.
4. Otherwise use kinetic friction. Guess a direction for the velocity ˆvA/B
and use it to determine ~F A,fk using Eq. (6.29).
5. Then solve the EoMs to determine if the direction of the velocity ~vA/B
matches the guessed direction of ˆvA/B.
6. If not, repeat from step 4 for the other direction of ˆvA/B.
For friction of a rolling wheel with the ground two conditions can occur. If
there is no slip, only static friction is present and aA/B,t = 0. While in the
case of slip or sliding, one deals with kinetic friction forces. Gearwheels always
behave according to the no slip condition, since their teeth prevent slipping.
Finally, a special situation are so-called frictionless contact problems, which
have µs = µk = 0. For these cases the friction force is always zero ~F f = ~0, and
the contact force is always normal to the contact plane.
6.13.5 Constraint equations on points
Some examples of common constraint equations that limit the motion of a
point A in 3, 2 or 1 dimensions are:
• A joint that ﬁxes a point A to a certain other point P, ﬁxing it along all
3 coordinate directions:
~rA = ~rP

120
6 KINETICS OF POINT MASSES
• A point A is constrained to move along a slider joint, collar or rail with
path curve ~rs(s), constraining it along 2 coordinate axes:
~rA = ~rs(s).
• Motion over a surface, for instance because the gravitational force ensures
object A does not move in the z direction, constraining motion along 1
coordinate direction:
zA(t) = 0
• Angular constraints can ﬁx certain rotation angles, e.g. φ(t) = φ0, they
can result in moments on the constrained object.
The contact forces and moments resulting from these constraint equations can
be analyzed by combining them with the EoMs.
6.13.6 Dynamics of massless mechanisms
When a mechanism m has zero mass, so mm = 0, application of Newton’s
second law tells us that the sum of external forces that act on the mechanism
is zero, since otherwise its acceleration would be inﬁnite:
X ~F ext = mm~am = ~0
(6.30)
This means that the sum of the forces on the mechanism is always zero, just
like in statics. Therefore you can use all methods you have learned in statics
courses to determine the positions and forces of the massless elements in the
mechanism. Unless it is explicitly mentioned they have mass, you may assume
all mechanisms in this textbook to be massless.
6.13.7 Two-force members
A massless mechanism on which only two external forces ~F A and ~F B are acting
is called a two-force member. Then we get from Eq. (6.30) that ~F A + ~F B = ~0
and:
~F A = −~F B
(6.31)
We see from Eq. (6.30) that because the mass of the mechanism is zero
(mm = 0), its acceleration ~am can take any value, which means that the
mechanism can translate extremely fast, such that it will instantaneously
assume a position that ensures P ~F = ~0. Note that, as will become clearer
later, the same argumentation holds for rotations, such that the mechanism
also instantaneously assumes a state where the sum of external moments is zero
P ~
M = ~0, which is only possible if the two forces ~F A and ~F B are collinear.
We will now discuss a few important massless mechanisms, show in Fig. 6.7.

Figure 6.7: FBDs of various mechanisms: a rod, a rope with mass, a relaxed spring with
length L0, a spring with length L0 + ∆L and a damper.
6.13.8 Rods and ropes
Probably the simplest two-force members are rods and ropes. Since these
mechanisms have a ﬁxed length L their operation is governed by this constraint
equation:
|~rA −~rB| = L
(6.32)
Ropes are ﬂexible, therefore they can only handle tensile (’pulling’) forces
that are parallel to the rope. The absolute value of those force vectors is called
the tension in the rope and Eq. (6.32) only holds if the rope is experiencing
tensile force. If ropes are bent (e.g. by pulleys) they can be dealt with as
discussed in 5.2.4. Since rods are rigid, they can handle also compressive forces
and can transfer moments.
As shown in second FBD in Fig. 6.7 the sum of the forces on a rope is
not zero anymore (~F A + ~F B 6= 0) if there is mass connected to the rope,
because part of the force ~F A is needed to accelerate the mass. So, be careful,
~F A = −~F B can only be applied when no masses are accelerated by the forces.
6.13.9 Spring
A linear spring is a mechanism whose length extends by a distance ∆L that
is proportional to the external pulling force (see Fig. 6.7). When there is no
external force (~F A = ~F B = ~0), it has a relaxed length L = L0, and when a
force is applied its length increases by a distance ∆L = L −L0:
~F k = k∆Lˆs
(6.33)

122
6 KINETICS OF POINT MASSES
Here k is the sti↵ness or spring constant of the spring, with unit N/m, which
normally has a positive value. The direction of the force can be indicated using
a unit vector ˆs that points outward parallel to the spring at point A.
6.13.10 Damper
A linear damper is a mechanism whose length changes at a rate that is
proportional to the externally applied pulling force (see Fig. 6.7).
~F c = cdL
dt ˆs
(6.34)
where c is the damping constant (unit N·s/m), which is always positive. If
point B is ﬁxed, the velocity of point A is in the same direction as the applied
force vector.
It is important to note that besides extending, springs and dampers can
also be compressed, such that the distance ∆L and time derivative ˙L become
negative and the forces change sign. Secondly we note that we have discussed in
Fig. 6.7 the e↵ect of external forces ~F A and ~F B generated on the mechanisms.
But if one e.g. connects a point mass m at point A to a spring, the force
generated by the mechanism is of opposite sign ~F m,k = −k∆Lˆs, where the
minus sign arises from Newton’s third law.
6.13.11 Other forces
There are many other types of forces, like thermodynamic, aerodynamic, ﬂuid
dynamic, electromagnetic, electrostatic and material forces. It carries too far
here to discuss them all, and the methodology discussed in this chapter can be
applied for all types of forces once the functional form is known.

6.14 SUMMARY
123
6.14 Summary
In this chapter we have formulated a complete methodology to derive the
kinetics of systems of one or more point masses under the inﬂuence of forces
and constraints generated by constraining objects and massless mechanisms.
Here we have made use of the kinematics from the previous chapter, introduced
the important concepts force and mass, and discussed the procedure of sketching
the problem and the FBDs to obtain and solve the EoMs. Let us summarise
the main topics and equations in this chapter:
• Mass and force
– Mass and force are deﬁned by Newton’s laws
– P ~F = m~a
– ~F action = −~F reaction
• Procedure for solving the EoMs
– Sketch, CS, FBD, projecting forces, determining the EoM
– Solving the EoM using kinematics and constraints
– Relative motion and IRF
• Forces, mechanisms and constraints
– Gravity: ~F g = m~g
– Friction: Eqs. (6.28,6.29)
– Massless mechanisms: P ~F ext = ~0
– Rods and ropes: |~rA −~rB| = L
– Spring: ~F k = k∆Lˆs
– Damper: ~F c = c dL
dt ˆs
Although all kinetic problems can be solved using the general method outlined
in this chapter, certain problems, in particular those where the forces only
depend on position, are easier to solve using the concepts of work and energy,
which will be discussed in the next chapter. If the forces only depend on time,
or have a very short duration, the principle of impulse and momentum is useful,
which will be discussed in chapter 8.

7 Work and Energy
In the previous chapters we have outlined a methodology to fully analyse the
dynamics of point masses from their kinetics and kinematics. However, in
certain situations information about the motion can be obtained via an easier
route, using the methods of work and energy. The methods of work and energy
are particularly useful if:
• The forces depend on position and not explicitly on time
• One only needs to determine changes in speed
• It is not needed to fully determine the motion ~r(t)
7.1 Principle of work and energy
We start by introducing the most important principle of this chapter.
Concept. Principle of work and energy
The principle of work and energy states that the work W done by a force ~F ij on
a point mass i, while it moves along a path curve from position s1 to position
s2, is equal to the change in its kinetic energy Ti.
Wij,s1!s2 = ∆Ts1!s2,
(7.1)
where ∆Ts1!s2 = Ti(s2) −Ti(s1) is the change in kinetic energy. To use the
principle in Eq. (7.1) we ﬁrst need to deﬁne the work Wij,s1!s2 done by a force
and the kinetic energy Ti of the point mass.
7.1.1 Work
Concept. Work
The work Wij performed by a force ~F ij on a point mass i, while it moves from
path coordinate s1 to s2 along a path curve ~rs(s) is deﬁned as:
Wij,s1!s2 ⌘
Z ~rs(s2)
~rs(s1)
~F ij · d~r
(7.2)

126
7 WORK AND ENERGY
This expression can be simpliﬁed by using that d~r = ˆsds (see Eq. (5.21)).
We can project the force vector on the path curve, obtaining its tangential
component using:
Fij,t = ~F ij · ˆs
(7.3)
Thus we obtain the following scalar expression for the work:
Wij,s1!s2 =
Z s2
s1
Fij,tds
(7.4)
7.1.2 Kinetic energy
Concept. Kinetic energy of a point mass
The kinetic energy of a point mass i is deﬁned as one half its mass times its
speed squared (v2
i = |~vi|2), and is indicated by the letter T.
Ti ⌘1
2miv2

(7.5)
S Example 7.1 As an example of the principle of work and energy we determine
the change in kinetic energy of a ball that is launched at an initial velocity ~v0 =
vx,0ˆı + vy,0ˆ| and experiences constant force ~F g = −mgˆ| of gravity.
The trajectory of the ball is shown in Fig. 7.1. We ﬁrst determine the work done
by the force on the ball using Eq. (7.2). By using that d~r = dxˆı + dyˆ|, such that
~F g · d~r = −mgdy we ﬁnd:
Ws1!s2 =
Z y2
y1
−mgdy = −mg(y2 −y1)
(7.6)
So, as shown in Fig. 7.2, the work done by the gravitational energy is negative and
has the same parabolic shape as the trajectory of the ball shown in Fig. 7.1. The
work is negative because the tangential component of the force initially reduces the
speed. After the ball has passed its highest point, the work increases again, because
the tangential component of gravity is in the same direction as the velocity vector.
From the principle of work and energy Eq. (7.1) we see that the change in kinetic
energy ∆T12 equals Ws1!s2, and follows the same curve in Fig. 7.2. Note that the
work could also have been determined by projecting the force on the path curve
using angle ↵and using the scalar equation Eq. (7.4) but this would have been more
diﬃcult.

7.1.3 Derivation of the principle
Here we present the derivation of the principle of work and energy. For a force
~F ij acting on a point mass i we have from Newton’s second law that:
~F ij = mi~ai

We see directly that the left side of this equation is equal to Eq. (7.2) and
can be replaced by the work Wij,s1!s2. To prove the principle in Eq. (7.1) we
still have to show that the right side is equal to the change in kinetic energy.

over Newton’s second law Eq. (7.8) leads to the principle of work and energy
Eq. (7.1).
7.1.4 Work and energy for a system
To analyse a system of point masses, on which multiple forces Fj are working,
the principle of work and energy can be extended by summing the work Eq.(7.1)
over all point masses i and forces j to obtain:
Wtot =

Thus the sum of the work of all forces on all point masses equals the total

Figure 7.3: A ball in a frictionless half pipe reaches the same height on both sides.
For certain forces, so called conservative forces, conservation of energy holds.
To understand what is meant by conservation of energy, consider a ball i rolling
back and forth in a half pipe under the inﬂuence of gravity like in Fig. 7.3.
The ball rolls up one of the ramps, stops at a maximum height, rolls downward
and gains its maximum speed at the lowest point after which this sequence
repeats itself. If there is no friction, the ball will continue rolling back and forth
indeﬁnitely. Apparently the system has a kind of ’memory’, represented by a
quantity that is always constant. Let us assume that there is a quantity called
the internal energy Ui,tot which is constant (conserved) and can be deﬁned as
the sum of the kinetic energy and a potential energy function Vi(~r).
Ti + Vi(~r) ⌘Ui,tot = constant
(7.12)
This equation is called the law of conservation of energy. We now need to
derive when it holds and what are the properties of the potential energy.
If the total internal energy Ui,tot is constant, then always ∆Ui,tot = 0. When
the point mass i moves from position ~r1 to position ~r2 under the inﬂuence of a
force ~F ij, this implies that the change in its kinetic and potential energy are:
∆Ti,~r1!~r2 + ∆Vij,~r1!~r2 = ∆Ui,tot ⌘0
(7.13)

130
7 WORK AND ENERGY
From the principle of work and energy, Eq. (7.1), we have ∆Ti,~r1!~r2 =
Wij,~r1!~r2. By combining this with Eq. (7.13) we ﬁnd the equation for potential
energy.
Concept. Potential energy
The change in the potential energy of a point mass i is the negative of the work
done by a conservative force ~F ij,c on the point mass.
∆Vij,~r1!~r2 = −Wij,~r1!~r2
(7.14)
By combining Eq. (7.14) with the deﬁnition of work Eq. (7.2) we ﬁnd that
the potential energy obeys:
Vij(~r2) −Vij(~r1) = −
Z
~r2
~r1
~F ij,c(~r) · d~r
(7.15)
However, not all forces obey Eq. (7.15). If the point mass moves along a closed
path, we have ~r2 = ~r1. If we substitute this in Eq. (7.15) we ﬁnd that only
forces that satisfy the following equation are conservative forces:
Concept. Conservative force
The work done by a conservative force ~F ij,c on a point mass along any closed
path is zero.
Wij,s1!s1 =
I
~r1
~r1
~F ij,c(~r) · d~r = 0
(7.16)
According to this deﬁnition, the gravitational force is conservative, since
it follows from Eq. (7.6) that if ~r2 = ~r1, we have y2 = y1 and Wij,s1!s1 = 0,
irrespective of the path.
7.2.1 Force from potential energy
Interestingly, once the potential energy function Vij(~ri) of a conservative force
is known, it can be used to determine the force ﬁeld vector by taking its
gradient as follows:
~F ij,c(~r) = −~rVij(~r)
(7.17)
Derivation. Here we will show how the conservative force vector can be
obtained from the potential energy.

7.2 CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
131
By combining Eq. (7.4) and (7.14), we obtain for the change in potential
energy when the point mass moves from ~r1 to ~r2:
∆Vij,~r1!~r2 = −
Z s2
s1
Fij,tds
(7.18)
If one chooses the path curve to be parallel to the x axis, ds becomes dx
and by substituting s1 = x and s2=x + ∆x in Eq. (7.18), in the limit ∆x ! 0
we obtain:
Vij(x + ∆x) −Vij(x)

(7.20)

(7.21)
A similar procedure as in Eq. (7.21) can be used to obtain the other components
of the force vector, by taking the path curve parallel to y and z axes, such that
the total force vector at position ~r can be constructed:
~F ij,c(~r)

Here we used that the del or nabla operator ~r in Cartesian coordinates is
~r =
@
@xˆı+ @
@yˆ|+ @
@z ˆk. ~rV is the gradient of the scalar potential energy function.
Essentially, this gradient shows that the force on a point mass always points
downward along the steepest ’downhill’ potential direction, with a magnitude
equal to the slope of the potential energy function along that direction.
7.2.2 Heat and energy conservation*
Interestingly, all fundamental forces of nature are conservative forces, which
means that energy can never be lost and remains constant. Nevertheless,
besides increasing the kinetic energy of large point-masses, forces like friction
can also increase the random velocity of the atoms in a material. The energy
associated with this random motion of the atoms is called heat Q, and leads
to temperature increases. Unfortunately, since the motion is random, it is
not possible to fully reuse heat to perform work, and can thus be considered

132
7 WORK AND ENERGY
Figure 7.4: The law of conservation of internal energy (T + V = const) does not hold when
kinetic or potential energy is converted into heat Q or used to perform work Wext
on an external system by non-conservative forces.
as (partly) lost energy. Forces that generate heat are therefore also called
non-conservative forces or dissipative forces.
For example when a block slides o↵a ramp while friction forces act on it,
the temperature of the block and the ramp increase due to the higher average
velocity of the atoms in the materials. Non-conservative forces like friction
usually generate heat (∆Q > 0). To distinguish the potential and kinetic
energy stored in a closed system from heat energy and external sources or
sinks of energy, the sum of kinetic and potential energy T + V = Ui of a point
mass or system of point masses is called its internal energy. Internal energy
can reduce via generation of heat Q, and can also reduce by net work Wext
performed by the internal system on an external system. If the e↵ect of heat
and work is included, the energy conservation equation becomes:
T + V + Q + Wext = Etot = constant
(7.25)
This equation, that is depicted schematically in Fig. 7.4 is also called the
ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, and is discussed in more detail in thermodynamics
textbooks. If we only look at changes in energy, the law can be reformulated
into:
∆T + ∆V + ∆Q + ∆Wext = 0
(7.26)

7.2 CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
133
The equation states that total energy Etot is conserved and can be inter-
changed between kinetic and potential energy, or heat energy Q or work Wext
on external systems. We note that there are always dissipative, frictional forces,
which will continue to convert internal energy into heat as long as the system
keeps moving. Therefore, unless there are external sources of work or heat
(∆Q + ∆Wext < 0), the system will eventually stop moving once the internal
energy is all converted into heat. As a consequence it is impossible to create
so-called perpetuum mobiles: mechanisms that continue moving forever without
energy supply.
7.2.3 Power
Concept. Power
The work W of a force on a point mass can be divided by the time interval
over which this work is done to obtain the average power generated by the force.
When the time interval tends to zero we obtain that the (instantaneous) power
generated by a force is:
P = dW
dt
(7.27)
From Eq. (7.2) it can be seen that dW = ~F · d~r, from which we ﬁnd that
the rate at which power is generated equals the inner product of the force and
velocity vectors:
P = dW
dt = ~F · d~r
dt = ~F · ~v
(7.28)
Inversely, the total work done by a force can be obtained by integrating the
power over time:
W =
Z
Pdt =
Z
~F · ~vdt
(7.29)
7.2.4 Eﬃciency
Let’s say we want to determine the eﬃciency of a car engine. The external
input energy is the fuel consumed by the car engine which is converted into
kinetic, potential and heat energy and is thus equal to ∆Win = ∆T +∆V +∆Q.
The useful output energy is the kinetic energy and potential energy increase of
the car ∆T + ∆V , that it uses to accelerate or to drive uphill. The non-useful
energy is the heat that is generated in the car ∆Q.
The eﬃciency of the car engine is then deﬁned as:

7 WORK AND ENERGY
⌘= Useful output energy
Total input energy
⇥100% =
∆T + ∆V
∆T + ∆V + ∆Q ⇥100%

equation one obtains the instantaneous eﬃciency:
⌘= Pout

The equation for eﬃciency can depend on the type of application. In a car,

S Example 7.2 A block with mass m slides from a hill. It starts from rest at a
height y = h and reaches a ﬁnal velocity v2 at height y = 0. Determine the eﬃciency
of the conversion from potential to kinetic energy of the block.
This problem is similar to the example in the previous chapter, see Fig. 7.5. In
this case, the input energy is equal to the reduction in potential energy of the block
−∆V = mgh. The change in kinetic energy ∆T = 1

7.3 POTENTIAL ENERGY OF SPECIFIC FORCE FIELDS

7.2.5 Conservation of energy for a system
Let us now consider the situation when there are multiple point masses i in
a system, each with a potential energy function Vi. Instead of considering
them separately, it is sometimes useful to treat them together, e.g. when the
forces they exert on each other are not well known. In that case we can sum
all kinetic and potential energies from Eq. (7.12) at times t = t1 and t = t2 to
obtain:

Ti(t1) +
X
i
Vi(t1) =
X
i
Ti(t2) +

Vi(t2) =

(7.34)
The total energy of the system of point masses is conserved, and is equal to
P
i Ei,tot at all times.
7.3 Potential energy of speciﬁc force ﬁelds
The concept of potential energy is mainly useful for conservative forces. These
forces can ’store’ energy and return it later. As examples we determine the
potential energy of a gravitational force ﬁeld and of a spring, which are both
conservative forces.
7.3.1 Gravitational energy
The gravitational force ~F ig = mi~g is given by Eq. (6.27). If the gravitational
force acts along the y-axis, with ~g = −gˆ|, it follows from Eq. (7.22) that:
~F ig = −migˆ| = −@Vig
@y ˆ|
(7.35)
By integrating this equation over y we obtain the potential energy function
for a mass in a constant gravitational ﬁeld:
Vig(yi) =
Z yi
y0
migdy = [migy]yi
y0 = migyi + C
(7.36)
The integration constant C = −migy0 can be arbitrarily chosen by selecting
a height y0 at which the potential energy is zero. Its choice does not a↵ect the
dynamics.

7 WORK AND ENERGY
7.3.2 Centre of mass and gravity
To determine the gravitational energy of objects that consist of many point
masses mi with position vectors ~rj, we deﬁne the centre of mass (CoM) and
its position vector ~rG for such a system.
Deﬁnition. Centre of mass vector
The centre-of-mass position vector ~rG of a system of point masses mi, with
a total mass mtot, is the mass weighted average of all position vectors ~ri, as
deﬁned by the following equations.
~rG

(7.39)
mtot~rG

~r⇢dV
(7.40)
If the object has a mass density ⇢(in kg/m3) that is distributed over a certain
volume V , then the last equation gives the volume integral that determines the
centre of mass. By taking the time derivatives of Eq. (7.39) we obtain useful
expressions for the velocity ~vG and the acceleration vector ~aG of the CoM:
mtot~vG
=
X
i
mi~vi
(7.41)
mtot~aG
=
X
i
mi~ai
(7.42)
When the gravitational force ~F ig = −migˆ| acts on the system, the y
coordinate of every point mass is given by yi = ~ri · ˆ|, such that the potential
energy of the whole system of point masses is given by:
Vg,tot =
X
i
Vig =
X
i
migyi = g
X
i
mi~ri · ˆ| = mtot~rG · ˆ| = mtotyG,
(7.43)
where we used Eq. (7.39). This equation shows that the gravitational potential
energy of a system of point masses is identical to the potential energy that the
system would have if all point masses would be located at its centre of mass at
a height yG. The centre of mass is therefore also sometimes called the centre
of gravity. We use the subscript G to indicate the centre of mass.

7.4 SOLVING PROBLEMS WITH WORK AND ENERGY
137
7.3.3 Spring energy
The properties of a spring that is aligned along the positive x-axis and connected
at the origin can be analysed in a similar way. When the spring is displaced
by a distance xke from its relaxed length, the spring force of the spring on a
mass i (Eq. 6.33) is related to the potential energy:
~F ik(xke) = −kxkeˆı = −@Vik
@x ˆı
(7.44)
By integrating this equation over x we obtain:
Vik(xke) =
Z xke
0
kxdx =
1
2kx2
2xke
0
= 1
2kx2
ke
(7.45)
If the length of the spring equals its rest length, xke = (xi −L0) = 0, its
potential energy is chosen to be zero by starting the integral from x = 0.
7.3.4 Other conservative forces
Another important example of conservative forces are contact forces. Very
often these forces act on objects that have zero velocity, or have a velocity
perpendicular to the contact force, such that the power from the contace force
is zero (P = ~F · ~v = 0). In these cases the work done, and therefore the
potential energy of these forces is zero. Thus, contact forces are conservative
forces, since they do not change the total energy in the system.
7.4 Solving problems with work and energy
In this chapter two methods to solve dynamics problems using the concepts of
work and energy have been described: the principle of work and energy and
the concept of energy conservation. Both methods provide one scalar equation,
Eq. (7.11) and Eq. (7.34), that can be used to determine one unknown scalar
variable. For example, this unknown scalar variable can be:
• The magnitude of a ﬁnal or initial velocity
• A ﬁnal or initial position coordinate
• The work of a force, which can sometimes also be used to determine the
magnitude of the force
The advantage of energy methods is that they allow solving a dynamics
problems, without requiring one to solve di↵erential equations. Moreover,
under certain conditions (energy conservation) they provide solutions even if

138
7 WORK AND ENERGY
the path between the initial and ﬁnal state is unknown, making the solutions
also more generally valid.
Solving the problem then proceeds along the following steps:
1. Sketch the point masses, massless mechanisms, force vectors and con-
straints.
2. Choose and draw a suitable coordinate system (CS).
3. Determine the constraint equations.
4. Determine the kinetic energy function of all point masses in terms of the
velocities.
5. Determine the work or potential energy function for all forces.
6. Determine the change in kinetic energy, change in potential energy, and/or
the work done on masses by forces between the initial and ﬁnal condition.
7. Write down the equation for the principle of work and energy, or the
conservation of energy equation.
8. Determine the unknown scalar variable by solving the energy equation.
Energy methods only give the scalar values of the positions and velocity and
not their directions. For instance, a mass with velocity v has the same kinetic
energy as a mass with velocity −v, such that the direction of the velocity
cannot be determined from the kinetic energy. Similarly, if the potential energy
of a spring is calculated by energy methods, it cannot be determined if it is
compressed or extended. Careful evaluation of the problem is needed, based on
considerations other than energy, to determine those directions and to select
the right solution.

7.5 Summary
In this chapter we have introduced the concepts of work, kinetic energy and
potential energy and shown how they can provide a simpler route for solving
certain problems in dynamics. The law of conservation of energy provides
insight in the source of forces, and shows that if work is done, this drains other
energy resources. We summarise the most important concepts and equations
from this chapter:

• Conservation of energy
– A force ~F c(~r) is conservative if it does not perform work along a
closed path.
– For a system on which only conservative forces act, the internal
energy is conserved: U = T + V = constant.
– The change in potential energy is the negative of the work done by
a conservative force: ∆V = −W12.

8 Impulse and Momentum
In this chapter we will introduce the concepts of impulse and momentum, and
show how they can be used to simplify the analysis of the kinetics of point
masses. These concepts are particularly useful to analyse changes in velocity
during short events, like collisions, where the position of the point masses are
approximately constant.
8.1 Principle of impulse and momentum
We ﬁrst deﬁne the concepts impulse and momentum, then introduce the
principle of impulse and momentum and ﬁnally present the derivation of it.
These concepts are also illustrated in Fig. 8.1.

8 IMPULSE AND MOMENTUM
Concept. Momentum
The momentum vector ~pi is deﬁned as the product of a mass and its velocity
vector:
~pi ⌘mi~vi
(8.2)
The unit of momentum is kg·m/s.
Concept. Principle of impulse and momentum
The impulse acting on a mass mi equals its change in momentum.
~pi(t1) + ~Ji,12 = ~pi(t2)
(8.3)
Since this is a vector equation, it can be projected on the three coordinate
axes to obtain three scalar equations along each of the axes. The principle of
impulse and momentum is mainly useful to calculate velocity changes if the
impulse is known.
Derivation. Principle of impulse and momentum
The principle of impulse and momentum can be derived by integrating Newton’s
second law over time:
X

~F ijdt =

~F ijdt =
Z t2
t1
md~vi
dt dt = m~vi(t2) −m~vi(t1)
(8.5)
From Eq. (8.1) and Eq. (8.2) it follows that this equation is identical to Eq. (8.3).
8.2 Analysing problems with impulse
Although the principle of impulse and momentum is generally valid, it is
particularly useful for analysing the dynamics under these conditions:
1. The time interval ∆t = t2 −t1 during which a force acts on a point mass
is very short.
2. The force ~F ij acting on the point mass i is very high compared to all
other forces.

8.3 IMPULSE AND MOMENTUM OF A SYSTEM
143
When these two conditions hold, e.g. during the short instance when a ball
is hit by a baseball bat, we can apply 2 assumptions:
1. The distance the point mass travels during the short time ∆t is approxi-
mately zero.
2. The impulse of all other forces can be neglected because they are much
smaller than the force ~F ij.
As a consequence of point 1, we retain information on the position of the
mass without having to determine (integrate) the motion during the application
of the impulse because the mass does not move. As a consequence of point 2,
we can determine the impulse by integrating only force ~F ij during the time
interval ∆t and neglect all other forces.
Often segmented motion (see Sec. 5.10) is used to analyse problems with
impulse and momentum. The motion in the segments before and after the
impulse is analysed with the methods from the previous chapters, and only
the short segment where the large force is exerted is analysed with impulse
and momentum.
8.3 Impulse and momentum of a system
To extend the principle of impulse and momentum to a system of point masses,
it is convenient to simplify the expression of the total momentum of such a
system, by using its centre of mass.
Concept. Momentum of a system of point masses
The total momentum of a system of point masses P
i ~pi is identical to the
momentum ~pG of a single point mass mtot = P
i mi that moves along with the
centre of mass of the system:
X
i
~pi =
X
i
mi~vi = d
dt
X
i
mi~ri = d
dtmtot~rG = mtot~vG = ~pG
(8.6)
Here Eq. (7.39) was used for the CoM: P
i mi~ri = mtot~rG. Let us now analyse
the forces that generate impulse on the system in more detail. We can subdivide
them into two groups, as shown in Fig. 8.2: the external forces ~F i,ext acting on
the masses in the system and the internal forces ~F ij,int that the point masses
generate on each other. For this second group of forces, we know from Newton’s
third law, that the force vector of mass mj on mass mi is equal and opposite
to the force vector of mi on mass mj: ~F ij,int = −~F ji,int.

144
8 IMPULSE AND MOMENTUM
Figure 8.2: The internal and external forces on a system of point masses.
Derivation. We are now going to derive that the sum of all internal force
vectors that act between point masses in a system is zero, as can intuitively be
understood from Fig. 8.2.
To determine the total impulse on a system, we sum ﬁrst over all forces
j that act on a point mass to determine the total force on that point mass:
~F i,tot = P
j6=i ~F ij,int + ~F i,ext. Then we sum over all point masses i in the
system: ~F sys,tot = P
i ~F i,tot. Finally we integrate over time and obtain the
total impulse on the system:
~Jsys,tot,12 =
Z t2
t1

@~F i,ext +

j6=i
~F ij,int

(8.7)
Now we note that the sum P
i
P
j6=i ~F ij,int includes for each term ij also a
term ji with the inverted indices. Since we know from Newton’s third law that
~F ij,int + ~F ji,int = ~0, the sum of internal forces in a system is always zero:
X
i,j6=i
~F ij,int = ~0
(8.8)
Therefore, only the impulse due to external forces contributes to the change
of the total momentum. By summing Eq. (8.3) over all particles i in a system
we obtain:

8.3 IMPULSE AND MOMENTUM OF A SYSTEM
145
Concept. Principle of impulse and momentum for a system

(8.10)
where we used Eq. (8.1) and Eq. (8.6) to obtain an expression for the e↵ect
of an impulse on the momentum of the centre of mass of a system of point
masses.
We can now derive1 Euler’s ﬁrst law by taking the time derivative of Eq. (8.9)
and using Eq. (8.6):
Concept. Euler’s ﬁrst law
Euler’s ﬁrst law states that the total mass mtot times the acceleration ~aG of
the CoM of a system of point masses equals the sum of external forces acting
on the system:
X
i
~F i,ext = mtot~aG
(8.11)
This is an important equation, since it states that the acceleration of the CoM
of a system of point masses only depends on the sum of the external forces
on it. Interestingly, the points of action of the forces do not matter, and also
internal forces can fully be neglected, which can signiﬁcantly simplify analysis.
1We note that Euler’s ﬁrst law, Eq. (8.11) can also be derived by adding Newton’s second
law for all point masses (P
ij ~F ij = P
i mi~ai), and using Eqs. (8.8) and (7.42).

146
8 IMPULSE AND MOMENTUM
8.4 Law of conservation of momentum
If there are no external forces acting on the system, and no masses leave or
enter the system, the system is called a closed system. Since ~Ji,ext,12 = ~0 in
such a system, it follows from Eq. 8.10 that we have:
Concept. Momentum conservation
The total momentum of a closed system is conserved. This means that the total
momentum is constant, equal to the momentum of the centre of mass ~pG, and
does not change in time.
~pG =
X
i
~pi = constant
(8.12)
Because ~pG = mtot~vG, momentum conservation also implies that the velocity
~vG of the centre of mass of the system is constant. Since Eq. (8.12) is a vector
equation it can be applied along each of the coordinate axes:
X
i
pi,x
=
constant
(8.13)
X
i
pi,y
=
constant
(8.14)
X
i
pi,z
=
constant
(8.15)
Note that if external forces only operate along one of the coordinate axes,
conservation of momentum along that axis does not hold anymore, but along
the other two axes momentum will still be conserved.
8.5 Collisions
An important application of the law of momentum conservation is the dynamic
analysis of collisions between two objects, like the collision between two billiard
balls (see Fig. 8.3). We note that methods from previous chapters often cannot
be easily applied because the forces and accelerations during a collision are
often not accurately known. This inaccuracy is caused by the fast dynamics
and high forces during collisions, that are hard to measure. During such a
short collision, other forces can usually be neglected, because they are much
smaller than the very high collision forces that provide the high accelerations
which change the velocity vectors in a short time. As a consequence of the

8.5 COLLISIONS
147
absence of substantial external forces, the law of conservation of momentum
Eq. (8.12) holds for the system containing both balls. We will now discuss step
by step how the dynamics of the collision of two balls can be analysed using
momentum conservation and the CoM-frame.
8.5.1 Plane of contact and line of impact
Let us consider two smooth spherical balls A, B with identical radius, with
masses mA, mB and velocity vectors ~vA and ~vB that move in the xy-plane
and collide, as shown in Fig. 8.3. The motion of the balls consists of 3 phases:
1. before the collision at time t0, 2. during the collision at time t1 and 3. after
the collision at time t2.
We can then choose our Cartesian coordinate system such that the origin O
is at the point of contact. The y-axis is chosen to be tangential to the surface
of the circular disks at the point where they make contact, this surface is called
the plane of contact. The x-axis is chosen perpendicular to the plane of contact
and is called the line of impact. The balls A and B and velocity vectors ~vA,
~vB can be drawn as shown in Fig. 8.3).
The analysis of collisions becomes easier if it is performed in a CoM-frame.
Concept. CoM-frame
A CoM-frame is a reference frame that is chosen such that the velocity and
acceleration of the CoM of the objects is zero.
The analysis process then proceeds along the following steps:
1. Determining the velocity vector ~vG of the CoM.
2. Transforming to the CoM-frame by subtracting the velocity of the centre
of mass ~vG from all velocity vectors.
3. Analysing the system in the centre of mass system.
4. Transforming back to the original system by adding ~vG to all velocity
vectors.
8.5.2 Transformation to the CoM-frame
Since there are no external forces acting on the balls (we neglect gravity), it is
a closed system in which momentum conservation holds, such that the velocity
~vG of the centre of mass (CoM) is constant. The analysis can be signiﬁcantly
simpliﬁed by choosing a coordinate system x0, y0, z0 that moves along with
the CoM-frame, such that, measured in these coordinates, the velocity of the
CoM is zero ~v0
G = ~0. A transformation to a di↵erent coordinate system like
shown in Fig. 8.5 was already discussed in Eq. (6.24) and is often useful for

used to analyse the dynamics. To simplify the analysis of collisions, we choose
the velocity of boat A to be equal to the constant velocity (~aA = ~0) of the CoM
of the system of point masses (~vA = ~vG) and use coordinates x0 and y0.
simplifying the analysis of problems, and therefore an important technique
to become familiar with (see Sec. 6.12). The position and velocity vectors in
the CoM-frame are found by ﬁrst determining ~vG (using Eq. (7.41)) and then
calculating the velocities ~v0 in the CoM-frame by subtracting ~vG:

8.5.3 Analysing the collision in the CoM-frame

always parallel, pointing in opposite directions, as can be derived from ~v0

8.5 COLLISIONS

Now we can analyse the collision in the CoM-frame in three steps that are
illustrated in Figs. 8.4):
1. Before the impact, at time t = t0 the velocity vectors ~v0
A0, ~v0
B0 point
toward each other.
2. During the impact both balls exert forces ~F AB = −~F BA = FABˆı on each
other along the x-axis and slightly deform at the contact point. At the
time of maximal deformation t = t1, the velocity x-components of both
balls are zero2 v0
A1,x = v0
B1,x = 0.
3. After the collision, the energy that was stored in the deformation is
converted back to kinetic energy, at t = t2 the velocity vectors ~v0
A2, ~v0
B2
point away from each other.
The subscripts 0, 1, 2 are used to designate the velocities of the balls at
times t0, t1 and t2. To analyse the change in momentum during the impact,
we apply the principle of impulse and momentum Eq. (8.9) along the y and x
axes. Because the balls are smooth and frictionless, there are no forces in the
y-direction tangential to the plane of contact, such that all forces act along
the line of impact and are parallel to the x-axis. Since the forces and impulses
along the y-axis are zero, the momentum and velocity components of both
balls are conserved ∆p0
y = m∆v0
y = 0 along that axis:
v0
A2,y
=
v0
A0,y
(8.23)
v0
B2,y
=
v0
B0,y
(8.24)
Along the x-axis it is more diﬃcult to analyse the collision, since the contact
forces along this axis are unknown, and can depend on the material properties
of the balls and other conditions that a↵ect the collision. These properties
are conveniently captured by the coeﬃcient of restitution e, that relates the
velocity of the ball in the CoM at time t2 to that at t0:
v0
A2,x
=
−ev0
A0,x
(8.25)
v0
B2,x
=
−ev0
B0,x
(8.26)
Note that these equations follow from momentum conservation, ensuring
that Eq. (8.21) still holds after the collision. The coeﬃcient e, that can have
2For a collision to occur in the CoM-frame, the velocity component along the line of impact
has to change sign. Therefore, there has to exist a time t = t1 at which the x component
of velocity is zero, and because ~v0
G = ~0 this occurs at the same time for both balls.

152
8 IMPULSE AND MOMENTUM
any value between 0 and 1, is closely related to the energy loss during the
collision as we will discuss later. Combining Eqs. (8.23)–(8.26) we have:
~v0

A0,xˆı + v0
A0,yˆ|
(8.27)
~v0
B2
=
−ev0
B0,xˆı + v0

(8.28)
Finally, we transform back to the original coordinate system (Fig. 8.3 at t2)
by adding the CoM velocity ~vG to all velocity vectors:
~vA2
=
~v0
A2 + ~vG
(8.29)

(8.31)

(8.32)
Thus we have analysed the dynamics of collisions with oblique impact (impact
at an angle) by only using the conservation of momentum principle, without
knowing any details about the forces, except the restitution coeﬃcient e. In
the special case that the balls both move parallel to the line of impact (x-axis)
they experience central impact, where all previous equations still hold with all
velocity components along the y-axis being zero (vA0,y = vB0,y = 0). Note that
since we are dealing with spherical balls, the centres of mass of both objects
always coincide with the line of impact. For non-circular objects, this is not
always the case, and the impact can become eccentric such that the objects
can start rotating after the collision. Also if the surface of the objects is not
smooth, friction forces might generate rotations under oblique impact. Impact
with rotations will be discussed in chapter Ch. 12.
S Example 8.1 Let us analyse a numerical example of the situation sketched in
Fig. 8.3 and Fig. 8.4 with e = 0.6, mA = 3 kg and mB = 5 kg. First we determine
the velocity vector ~vG of the centre of mass:
~vA0
=
[3.5ˆı −1.5ˆ|] m/s
(8.33)
~vB0
=
[−0.5ˆı + 2.5ˆ|] m/s
(8.34)

ˆ|
2
m/s
(8.35)
=
[1ˆı + 1ˆ|] m/s
(8.36)

8.5 COLLISIONS

Then we transform to the centre of mass system:
~v0
A0
=
~vA0 −~vG = [(3.5 −1)ˆı + (−1.5 −1)ˆ|] m/s
(8.37)
=
[2.5ˆı −2.5ˆ|] m/s
(8.38)
~v0
B0
=
~vB0 −~vG = [(−0.5 −1)ˆı + (2.5 −1)ˆ|] m/s
(8.39)
=
[−1.5ˆı + 1.5ˆ|] m/s
(8.40)
We multiply the x-components by −e = −0.6 to obtain the velocities in the
CoM-frame after the collision:
~v0
A2
=
[−e · 2.5ˆı −2.5ˆ|] m/s = [−1.5ˆı −2.5ˆ|] m/s
(8.41)
~v0
B2
=
[−e · −1.5ˆı + 1.5ˆ|] m/s = [0.9ˆı + 1.5ˆ|] m/s
(8.42)
Finally we add again the centre of mass velocity vector to obtain the velocities in
the original system after the impact:
~vA2
=
~v0
A2 + ~vG = [(−1.5 + 1)ˆı + (−2.5 + 1)ˆ|] m/s
(8.43)
=
[−0.5ˆı −1.5ˆ|] m/s
(8.44)
~vB2
=
~v0
B2 + ~vG = [(0.9 + 1)ˆı + (1.5 + 1)ˆ|] m/s
(8.45)
=
[1.9ˆı + 2.5ˆ|] m/s
(8.46)
As an excercise, you can check if there is momentum conservation during this
collision.
8.5.4 Coeﬃcient of restitution
The coeﬃcient of restitution e, that was introduced to capture the e↵ect of the
forces during impact, can be used as a measure for the kinetic energy that is
lost during the collision in the CoM-frame. To analyse this energy loss, we use
that the kinetic energy of ball A is given by:
T 0
A = 1
2mA(v0
A,x
2 + v0
A,y
2)
(8.47)
If we only consider the kinetic energy T 0
A,x contributed by the x-component
of the velocity vector, we ﬁnd, using Eq. (8.25) that the kinetic energy after
the collision is:
T 0
A2,x = 1
2mAv0
A2,x
2 = 1
2mAe2v0
A0,x
2 = e2T 0
A0,x
(8.48)
And the same equation holds for ball B. So, the x-axis kinetic energy T 0
A,x

154
8 IMPULSE AND MOMENTUM
reduces by a factor e2 during the collision, while the y-axis contribution remains
constant T 0
A2,y = T 0
A0,y. The largest energy reduction occurs for e = 0, which
is called a plastic or perfectly inelastic collision. Kinetic energy is conserved
(T 0
A2,x = T 0
A0,x) for e = 1, which is called an elastic collision. The restitution
coeﬃcient can have any value between 0 and 1 (0 e 1). Thus the coeﬃcient
of restitution provides information on energy conservation during collisions.
8.6 Collision against a wall
A special case is if a ball A collides against a wall. In that case there is normally
no momentum conservation, because the wall is connected to the ground, which
can exert external forces on the system. Let us consider a reference frame in
which the wall has zero velocity ~vW = ~0. Because the mass of the wall mW
is very large compared to the mass of the ball (mW ≫mA) and ~vW = ~0 the
chosen reference frame is a CoM-frame as can be shown as follows:
~vG = mA~vA + mW~vW
mA + mW
⇡mA~vA
mW
⇡~0
(8.49)
This shows that ball A is in a CoM-frame and therefore collides against the
wall just like in Figs. 8.4. From Eq. (8.27), we ﬁnd that the ﬁnal velocity of ball
A with initial velocity ~vA0, after colliding with a wall parallel to the y-axis is:
~vA2 = −evA0,xˆı + vA0,yˆ|
(8.50)
8.7 Summary
In this chapter the concepts of impulse and momentum have been introduced.
An impulse is the time integral of a force vector and is related to the momentum
change of a point mass during a certain time interval. The change in momentum
equals the impulse generated by external forces, this also holds for systems
of many point masses.
If the impulse, or sum of external forces is zero,
the momentum of the system does not change and the law of momentum
conservation applies. These principles can be applied to determine velocity
changes e.g. during collisions. We summarise the most important concepts
and equations from this chapter:
• Impulse and momentum
– Impulse vector: ~J12 = P
j
R t2
t1 ~F ijdt
– Momentum vector: ~pi = mi~vi

8.7 SUMMARY
155
– Principle of impulse and momentum: ~pi(t1) + ~J12 = ~pi(t2)
– Important assumptions during impulse: 1. Force is very high and
2. time duration of impulse is very short. This allows assuming: 1.
point mass is not moving during impulse. 2. impulse of other forces
can be neglected during impulse.
– Use segmented motion to analyse momentum and impulse.
• Impulse and momentum of a system of point masses
– Impulse of CoM: ~pG = mtot~vG = P
i ~pi
– The sum of all internal forces in a system is zero: P
i,j6=i ~F ij,int = ~0
– Principle of impulse and momentum for a system:
~pG(t1) +
X
i
~Ji,ext,12 = ~pG(t2)
– Euler’s ﬁrst law: P
i ~F i,ext = mtot~aG
• Momentum conservation
– Law of conservation of momentum: If ~Ji,ext,12 = ~0, then ~pG(t1) =
~pG(t2).
– And: ~vG = constant.
• Collisions
– Plane of contact, line of impact, draw CS.
– Method for analysing collisions: determine ~vG, transform to the
CoM-frame, v0
x2 = −ev0
x0 and v0
y2 = v0

system.
– Coeﬃcient of restitution e is a measure of kinetic energy loss in the

Rigid Body Dynamics

9 Kinematics of Rigid Bodies
9.1 Rigid bodies
After having discussed dynamics of point masses, we now turn to the analysis
of rigid bodies. In this textbook we focus on the planar kinematics of rigid
bodies in the xy-plane. That means that the point masses in the rigid body all
move in the xy-plane with z = 0. However, we note that much of the presented
theory is also applicable in 3D and unless explicitly indicated, e.g. with a
subscript 2D, the equations in this textbook are also valid in 3D.
Concept. Rigid body
A rigid body F is a set of point masses (atoms) mi which have the special
property that their relative position vectors are ﬁxed in time, such that the body
is undeformable.
Every point mass mi in the rigid body can be identiﬁed by a position vector
~ri. Since the body is rigid and undeformable, the distance between every two
point masses in the rigid body is constant which relates their dynamics by the
following relative constraint equation (see Sec. 5.2.4):
|~ri/j| = |~ri −~rj| = constant
(9.1)
In the next section we discuss how the orientation and position of a rigid body
can be speciﬁed.
9.2 Orientation and position
The ﬁrst step in the kinematic analysis of a rigid body is to have a unique
description of its position and orientation. In planar kinematics, we fully
determine the position of a rigid body by ﬁxing the position vectors of 2 points
in the rigid body that can be freely chosen, like points A and B of the rectangle
in Fig. 9.1.
If we know position vectors ~rA and ~rB the position and orientation of the
rigid body is fully determined. This requires four coordinates: xA, yA, xB and
yB. However, because we know the distance between the points, we can use

constraint equation 9.1 to reduce this to 3 coordinates, namely xA, yA and
φB/A, where φB/A is the angle the relative position vector ~rB/A makes with
the x-axis. With xA, yA we can determine ~rA, and with φB/A and knowledge
of the distance |~rB/A| we can determine ~rB/A:
~rA,2D
=
xAˆı + yAˆ|
(9.2)
~rB/A,2D
=
|~rB/A| cos φB/Aˆı + |~rB/A| sin φB/Aˆ|
(9.3)
Now we determine ~rB from the 3 coordinates by adding these two vectors as
shown in Fig. 9.1.
~rB
=
~rA + ~rB/A
(9.4)
~rB,2D
=
(xA + |~rB/A| cos φB/A)ˆı + (yA + |~rB/A| sin φB/A)ˆ|
(9.5)
9.3 Velocities in a rigid body
Derivation. Velocity of a point B in a rigid body
By taking the time derivative of the position vector ~rB in Eq. (9.4), we can
determine the velocity vector of point B in the rigid body as follows:
~vB,2D
=
d
dt~rB = d
dt~rA + d
dt~rB/A
(9.6)
=
~vA + ˙φB/A|~rB/A|
'
−sin φB/Aˆı + cos φB/Aˆ|
(
(9.7)
=
~vA + ˙φB/A|~rB/A|ˆφA
(9.8)
In the last step we used Eq. (5.71) to replace the terms in brackets by ˆφA,
which represents the unit vector at point B of a cylindrical coordinate system
with origin A, which is why we add the subscript A to the unit vector. The
velocity of point B in Eq. (9.8) can be split up in two parts: a vector ~vB,trans
related to translation and a vector ~vB,rot related to rotation:
~vB
=
~vB,trans + ~vB,rot
(9.9)
~vB,trans
=
~vA
(9.10)
~vB,rot,2D
=
˙φB/A|~rB/A|ˆφA
(9.11)
In Figs. 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4 we show these three velocity vectors ~vB,trans, ~vB,rot
and ~vB. Let us ﬁrst discuss two special types of rigid body motion: pure
translation and pure rotation.

Figure 9.4: General motion of a rigid body: a combination of rotation and translation.
9.3.1 Pure translation
When the angle φB/A is kept constant, like in Fig. 9.2, all points in the rigid
body move with the same velocity vector:
~vB = ~vB,trans = ~vA
(9.12)
This type of motion is called pure translation. The rotational component of
velocity is zero, as follows from Eq. (9.11) and ˙φB/A=0. It is important to note
that pure translation can happen along any path curve ~rA(s), even a circular
path. The word translation thus only means that the shape of the path is
identical for all points in the rigid body because φB/A is constant.
9.3.2 Pure rotation
When the position vector of a point in the rigid body is constant in time, and
all other points make circular paths around it, e.g. because it rotates around
an axle at that position, the motion of the rigid body is a pure rotation. We
choose point A to be the point with constant position vector ~rA, as shown in
Fig. 9.3. Then according to Eq. (9.11) the velocity vector of point B is given

164
9 KINEMATICS OF RIGID BODIES
by:
~vB = ~vB,rot,2D = ˙φB/A|~rB/A|ˆφA
(9.13)
To facilitate the analysis of rotations and generalise it to 3D, we now deﬁne
the angular velocity ! and angular velocity vector ~!.
9.3.3 Angular velocity of a rigid body
The kinematics of a rigid body is closely linked to the time derivative ˙φB/A(t),
which is deﬁned as its angular velocity.
Deﬁnition. Angular velocity of a rigid body
The time derivative ˙φB/A is the angular velocity ! of the rigid body:
! ⌘˙φB/A
(9.14)
The unit of angular velocity is rad/s. Interestingly, the angular velocity ! of
the rigid body is independent of the choice of the points A and B on the rigid
body and is therefore a general property of a rigid body as can be shown as
follows.
Concept. Independency of angular velocity
The angular velocity ! of a rigid body is independent of the choice of points A
and B on the rigid body.
Derivation. This can be proven by drawing two relative position vectors
between points A −D on the rigid body, ~rB/A and ~rD/C. Then the angular
velocities of these straight lines ˙φB/A and ˙φD/C has to be the same, otherwise
the rigid body would deform. This can be demonstrated by rotating the rigid
body by a full 360 ◦circle: then all points need to make a circle in the same
time and therefore have the same angular velocity.
Note that the angular velocity ! of a rigid body is di↵erent from the orbital
angular velocity !o of a single point mass around an axis. Orbital angular
velocity can depend on the position of the rotation axis or origin (Sec. 5.9.4).
To distinguish angular velocity of a rigid body from orbital angular velocity, the
angular velocity of a rigid body is therefore sometimes called its spin angular
velocity.

9.3 VELOCITIES IN A RIGID BODY
165
9.3.4 Angular velocity vector
It can be seen in Fig. 9.3 that for pure rotation all points in the rigid body
move in circular paths around point A. The velocity vector ~vB and all other
points in the rigid body, lie in the plane of those circles. To describe that plane
we deﬁne the angular velocity vector to be perpendicular to that plane.
Concept. Angular velocity vector
The angular velocity vector ~! of a rigid body is a vector with magnitude
|!| = | ˙φB/A| and a direction that is perpendicular to the plane in which the
rigid body rotates. Its direction can be determined using the right hand rule.
The angular velocity vector (unit rad/s) of a rigid body that rotates in the
xy plane is:
~!2D = !ˆk = ˙φB/Aˆk
(9.15)
The direction of the vector can be determined using the right-hand rule by
curving the ﬁngers of your right-hand around the curved arrow in Fig. 9.3,
which indicates the direction of rotational motion. Then your thumb points in
the ˆk direction, in agreement with Eq. (9.15).
9.3.5 Determining velocities with the angular velocity vector
From Fig. 9.3 we see that the velocity vector ~vB,rot lies in the plane in which the
rigid body moves. It is therefore perpendicular to ~!. It is also perpendicular
to the vector ~rB/A, since this vector is the radius of the circular motion. To
obtain a vector that is perpendicular to two other vectors we take the cross
product of these vectors:
Concept. Rotational velocity equation
The rotational velocity of a point B in a rigid body is given by:
~vB,rot = ~! ⇥~rB/A
(9.16)
For the 2D case, where ~!2D = ˙φB/Aˆk and ~rB/A = |~rB/A|ˆ⇢A, it is straightfor-
ward to check the correctness of this equation by comparison with Eq. (9.11)
and by using that ˆk ⇥ˆ⇢A = ˆφA as follows from the right-hand rule.
9.3.6 General motion
In general, as shown in Fig. 9.4, the motion of a point in a rigid body is a sum
of translational and rotational motion. By combining Eqs. (9.9) and (9.16) we

166
9 KINEMATICS OF RIGID BODIES
obtain the most general equation and important equation for the velocity in a
rigid body:
~vB = ~vA + ~! ⇥~rB/A
(9.17)
We note that this equation is valid in 3D and for any choice of the points A
and B as long as both points move along with the rigid body. However, a smart
choice of point A can simplify the analysis.
9.4 Angular acceleration of a rigid body
After having determined the velocity vector of a point in a rigid body, it is
now of interest to also determine the acceleration vector of the points in the
rigid body. We take the time derivative of Eq. (9.17), and use the product rule
on the vector cross product to determine the acceleration vector ~aB in a rigid
body.

angular velocity vector.

We note that in planar kinematics this expression can be simpliﬁed:

Eq. (9.19) and obtain the general expression for the acceleration.

~aB,cptl = −!2~rB/A acceleration vectors.

168
9 KINEMATICS OF RIGID BODIES
Concept. Acceleration vector in a rigid body
The general vector expression for the acceleration vector of a point B in a rigid
body that has translational and rotational acceleration:
~aB = ~aA + ~↵⇥~rB/A + ~! ⇥(~! ⇥~rB/A)
(9.22)
This equation shows that the acceleration of a point B on a rigid body
consists of three contributions that are shown in Fig. 9.5.
1. The translational acceleration ~aB,trans = ~aA due to the acceleration of
point A.
2. The angular acceleration ~aB,ang = ~↵⇥~rB/A due to the angular accelera-
tion vector.
3. The centripetal acceleration ~aB,cptl = ~! ⇥(~! ⇥~rB/A), due to the angular
velocity vector ~!.
Acceleration in planar kinematics
In planar kinematics we can simplify the expressions for the angular acceleration
somewhat. By using that ~↵= ↵ˆk we ﬁnd:
~aB,ang,2D = ~↵⇥~rB/A = ↵ˆk ⇥|~rB/A|ˆ⇢A = ↵|~rB/A|ˆφA
(9.23)
The vector ~! is always perpendicular to the xy-plane, such that ~! ⇥~rB/A =
!|~rB/A|ˆφA and:
~aB,cptl,2D = ~! ⇥(~! ⇥~rB/A) = −!2~rB/A
(9.24)
This shows that the centripetal component of acceleration always points
towards point A, the centre of rotation. Note that a similar result for the
centripetal acceleration term was obtained in Eq. (5.81). Combining the three
terms we obtain for the planar kinematics of a rigid body the following equation:
~aB,2D = ~aA + ↵|~rB/A|ˆφ −!2~rB/A
(9.25)

kinematics of a rigid body:

S Example 9.1 As an example of the kinematic methods for rigid bodies, consider
the square F in Fig. 9.6. The CoM of the square falls with a velocity ~vG = −1 ˆ| m/s
and acceleration ~aG = −1 ˆ| m/s2. At the same time the angular velocity and
acceleration of the square are ~! = 1 ˆk rad/s and ~↵= 1 ˆk rad/s2. The question is:
Determine the velocity and acceleration vectors of point B.
To solve this problem, we can use Eqs. (9.36) and (9.37). Instead of point A
we choose point G as reference point, because we have a lot of information on G.
Then we determine the vector ~rB/G = (3.5ˆı −0.5ˆ|)m from the ﬁgure. Now we use
Eq. (9.36) to obtain:
~vB
=
[−1ˆ| + 1ˆk ⇥(3.5ˆı −0.5ˆ|)] m/s
(9.38)
=
(0.5ˆı + 2.5ˆ|) m/s
(9.39)
And using Eq. (9.37) we obtain:
~aB
=
[−1ˆ| + 1ˆk ⇥(3.5ˆı −0.5ˆ|) −12(3.5ˆı −0.5ˆ|)] m/s2
(9.40)
=
[(0.5ˆı + 2.5ˆ|) −1(3.5ˆı −0.5ˆ|)] m/s2

9.5.1 Instantaneous centre of rotation
Concept. Instantaneous centre of rotation (IC)
In 2D kinematics it can be shown that at every instance there is always a single
point in space, the instantaneous centre of rotation IC, around which all points
in the rigid body move in a circular path (pure rotation). The velocity of the
rigid body at ~rIC is zero.
Using the position vector ~rIC, the velocity of all points i in the rigid body
can be determined using the equation for pure rotation:
~vi = ~! ⇥~ri/IC
(9.43)
Let us illustrate the use of the IC with an example.
S Example 9.2 In Fig. 9.7 a wheel F with radius R rolls at an angular velocity ~!
without slip over a horizontal surface. Find the expressions for the velocity vectors
of its CoM G and point B.
This problem can be solved by realising that the point at which the wheel touches
the ground has zero velocity and is therefore the instantaneous centre of rotation
IC. Now Eq. (9.43) is used to determine the velocity vector of point G and B. We
have ~rG/IC = Rˆ| and ~rB/IC = R(ˆı + ˆ|) and ~! = !ˆk. Then we have:

the negative x direction.

IC is an axis of rotation instead of a point. Let us now describe how to ﬁnd
the IC.
9.5.2 Finding the instantaneous centre of rotation
If a point with zero velocity is not known or present in the rigid body one can
try to ﬁnd the IC by utilising that all points in the rigid body move along
concentric circles around point ~rIC. This allows three methods to ﬁnd the IC
for planar kinematics:
1. If the angular velocity, and the velocity of a point i are known, determine
the distance of that point, using the equation |~ri/IC| = |~vi|/|!|. Project
this distance perpendicular to the vector ~vi to determine ~rIC.

172
9 KINEMATICS OF RIGID BODIES
2. Use two known velocity vectors ~vi and ~vj of di↵erent points i and j
on the rigid body. Determine the location ~rIC by drawing the lines
perpendicular to these two vectors, which are parallel to the radii of the
two concentric circles along which i and j move. These two lines intersect
at the common centre of rotation ~rIC.
3. If two known velocity vectors ~vi and ~vj are parallel, determine the angular
velocity by using the rate at which the speed increases at larger distance
from the IC: |!| = (||~vi| −|~vj||)/|~ri/j| and continue like in point 1.
9.5.3 Choosing the reference point for rotation
As we have seen from the previous examples, multiple choices are possible for
the point A that is used to analyse the kinematics of a rigid body. Ideally the
expressions for the translation and rotation of the rigid body are as simple as
possible.
Depending on the situation several choices for the reference point ~rA on
the rigid body are possible. Often a point that is ﬁxed in space, or does not
accelerate is a good choice. Otherwise a point with zero velocity, like an IC
can make the analysis simpler. Later we will see that a point where the e↵ects
of forces and moments can be easily calculated can also be good choice. In all
cases, it is important to carefully consider the reference point of the rigid body,
before starting to analyse its dynamics.
As illustrated in the next example, the kinematic equations discussed in this
chapter can also be used to analyse the kinematics of multiple rigid bodies
with relative motion that is described by constraint equations, similar to the
relatively constrained kinematics for point masses discussed in Sec. 5.2.4.
S Example 9.3 Problem: Fig. 9.8 shows three gearwheels A, B and C, that rotate
without slip. The angular velocity ~!A = !Aˆk and angular acceleration ~↵A = ↵Aˆk
of gearwheel A are known. Determine !B, !C, ↵B and ↵C.
To solve this problem ﬁrst determine the constraint equations. Since the gearwheels
rotate without slip, there is static friction and we know from Eq. (6.28) that for
the no slip condition, the tangential components of acceleration and velocity of the
surfaces at the points where they touch are equal (aPAB,t = aPBA,t). It is important
to realise that at a contact point there are points of two objects that have the same
position, and one should label and distinguish those separately, like PAB and PBA

(9.53)
We have 4 constraint equations and 4 unknown scalars that need to be determined,
so the problem is solvable. There is pure rotation, since the gearwheels rotate around
ﬁxed axes, so we have the following kinematic equations for gearwheel A:
~vPAB
=
~!A ⇥~rPAB/A
(9.54)
=
!Aˆk ⇥RAˆı

(9.59)
In the last step we separated the component of acceleration tangential to the
contact surface, since that is the only direction in which the friction constrains the
acceleration.
Since we know the velocity and acceleration of point PAB, we can combine it
with the constraint and kinematic equations to determine the angular velocity and
acceleration of gearwheel B:
~vPAB

(9.65)
After having obtained the angular velocity and acceleration of gearwheel B, we can
follow the same procedure for wheel C.
9.6 Integration and di↵erentiation over angles
The vector equations from the previous sections are very useful for determining
the kinematics of points in the rigid body at a certain time instant. However,
to predict the motion at all times, the coordinate functions xA(t), yA(t) and

9.6 INTEGRATION AND DIFFERENTIATION OVER ANGLES
175
φB/A(t) need to be determined. Using Eq. (9.5) we can then describe the planar
time-dependent motion of a point B as follows:
~rB,2D(t) = ~rA(t) + |~rB/A| cos φB/A(t)ˆı + |~rB/A| sin φB/A(t)ˆ|
(9.66)
The kinematics to describe the motion ~rA(t) of point A is exactly the same as
for the kinematics of point masses that were described in Ch. 5, using di↵erent
coordinate systems and path curves. The new aspect is that for rigid bodies
we also have to describe the time dependent angle φ(t) ⌘φB/A(t).
Luckily, for planar kinematics in 2D the required mathematics is completely
the same as that for the path coordinate sA, such that the methods we discussed
in Sec. 5.7 and Sec. 5.8 can be directly applied to the angle φ(t). This thus
just requires replacing s by φ, v by ! and a by ↵. For completeness we provide
all the resulting equations for angles here. For time di↵erentiation we get:
φ(t)
!
(9.67)
!(t)
=
˙φ(t) !
(9.68)
↵(t)
=
˙!(t) = ¨φ(t)
(9.69)
For time integration we obtain:

(9.72)
Similar to having functions along the path curve like as(s) and vs(s), we
can have functions for angle dependent angular velocity !φ(φ) and angular
acceleration ↵φ(φ). Di↵erentiation and integration over these functions is
similar to that over the path coordinate s:
↵φ(φ) = d!φ

9.7 Motion in rotating reference frames
We will now discuss methods for analysing motion of point masses in rotating
and accelerating reference frames. These methods can for instance be used to
analyse mechanisms with rotating parts, and can help to predict the e↵ect of
earth’s rotation on the motion of aircraft, vehicles and weather systems.

Figure 9.9: The velocity and acceleration of a ball B that rolls over the deck of a ship S can
be described in the ﬁxed coordinate system xyz, but also in the coordinate system
x0y0z0 that is moving along with ship that is itself translating and rotating.

9.7 MOTION IN ROTATING REFERENCE FRAMES
177
9.7.1 Rotating reference frame
The challenge we will deal with is illustrated in Fig. 9.9. A ball B, a point
mass, rolls over the deck of a ship S and the captain of the ship measures
its velocity ~v0
B/O0 and acceleration ~a0
B/O0 using the x0y0z0 system that moves
along with the ship. An observer O on the shore also measures the velocity
and acceleration of the ball and ﬁnds values ~vB and ~aB, which are di↵erent
from the values of the captain because the ship moves and rotates. In this
section we will discuss how to relate the velocity and acceleration of the ball B
as measured by the captain (~v0
B, ~a0
B) to those measured by the observer O on
the shore (~vB, ~aB), if we know the motion of the ship. So we know both its
translation (~vO0 and ~aO0), and its angular velocity and acceleration ~!S and
~↵S.
Since the mathematics to obtain the kinematic equations is rather involved,
we directly present the equations here, and then derive them at the end of this
chapter for interested readers.
9.7.2 Equations relating kinematics in rotating and ﬁxed CS
With the following equations one can determine the velocity and acceleration
vector of a point mass B as measured by the observer O if its velocity and
acceleration as measured by the captain in the rotating and translating ship S
are known:
~vB

We provide both the 3D version of the equations and the planar 2D version.
Note that ˆ⇢O0 and ˆφO0 are the unit vectors in a cylindrical coordinate system
with O0 as its origin. Let us now discuss the di↵erent components of these
equations.
9.7.3 Object at rest in rotating reference frame
We ﬁrst consider the situation where the ball is at rest on the deck of the ship at
ﬁxed position coordinate ~rB/O0, with zero velocity ~v0
B/O0 = ~0 and acceleration

178
9 KINEMATICS OF RIGID BODIES
~a0
B/O0 = ~0 in the reference frame of the ship. Substituting this in Eq. (9.77)
and Eq. (9.78) we ﬁnd:
~vB,rest
=
~vO0 + ~! ⇥~rB/O0
(9.81)
~aB,rest
=
~aO0 + ~↵⇥~rB/O0 + ~! ⇥(~! ⇥~rB/O0)
(9.82)
Despite the fact that the ball is at rest on the ship, these equations show us
that according to the observer on the shore it can have a substantial velocity
and acceleration ~vB,rest and ~aB,rest. Note also that the obtained equations are
identical to those for a ﬁxed point on a rigid body, Eq. (9.26) and Eq. (9.27) as
might be expected.
9.7.4 Coriolis acceleration
Now let’s consider what happens when the ball B is given a velocity ~v0
B/O0 and
acceleration ~a0
B/O0 on the ship deck. If we compare Eq. (9.81) and Eq. (9.77)
we see that these vectors are added to vectors in rest:
~vB
=
~vB,rest + ~v0
B/O0
(9.83)
~aB
=
~aB,rest + ~a0
B/O0 + ~aB,Cor
(9.84)
We see that a new acceleration term is added to the acceleration equation,
which is called the Coriolis acceleration.
Concept. Coriolis acceleration
If a point mass has a non-zero velocity ~v0
B/O0 in a reference frame that rotates
with angular velocity ~!, this results in a Coriolis acceleration term that appears
when the point mass is observed in a ﬁxed reference frame:
~aB,Cor = 2~! ⇥~v0
B/O0
(9.85)
It follows from the cross product, that the direction of the Coriolis acceleration
is perpendicular to the velocity of the point mass and will therefore cause it to
follow a curved circular path in the xy-plane. This rotational motion (Coriolis
e↵ect) can for instance be observed in the winds near a low pressure area as a
consequence of the rotation of the earth.

9.7 MOTION IN ROTATING REFERENCE FRAMES
179
9.7.5 Acceleration components in a rotating reference frame
Eq. (9.78) can be subdivided in ﬁve components, let us discuss each of them:
~aB = ~a0
B/O0 + ~aB,trans + ~aB,ang + ~aB,cptl + ~aB,Cor
(9.86)
1. The acceleration ~a0
B/O0 of the ball inside the rotating ship.
2. The translational acceleration ~aB,trans = ~aO0 due to the acceleration of
the ship.
3. The angular acceleration ~aB,ang = ~↵⇥~rB/O0 due to angular acceleration
of the ship.
4. The centripetal acceleration ~aB,cptl = ~! ⇥(~! ⇥~rB/O0).
5. The Coriolis acceleration that is a consequence of the velocity ~v0
B/O0 the
ball has inside the rotating ship: ~aB,Cor = 2~! ⇥~v0
B/O0.
The equations up to now determine the acceleration ~aB the observer on
the shore measures. If one would like to determine the acceleration that the
captain in the ship measures, this equation can be rewritten to:
~a0
B/O0 = ~aB −~aB,trans −~aB,ang −~aB,cptl −~aB,Cor
(9.87)
Note that even if there are no forces acting on the ball, such that ~aB = ~0,
the captain will measure an acceleration at a rate ~a0
B/O0 given by Eq. (9.87).
If the captain would not know the ship is accelerating and rotating, the
acceleration might be attributed to forces acting on the ball. Such forces due
to measurements in a non-inertial reference frame are called pseudo-forces.
Examples of such pseudo-forces are the centrifugal ’force’ −m~aB,cptl and the
Coriolis ’force’ −m~aB,Cor.
A Example 9.5 In Fig. 9.9 a ship S is making a pure rotation in the harbour with
a constant angular velocity ~!S = !Sˆk and ~↵S = ~0 around ﬁxed position ~rO0. A ball
B rolls over the deck of the ship with constant velocity ~v0B/O0 = v0
Bˆı0 as measured
by the captain in the x0y0z0 coordinate system that moves along with the ship. A
second ball C is thrown over the ship at constant velocity ~vC = vCˆ| as measured
by an observer O on the shore. Both the captain and observer O determine the
velocities and accelerations of the balls. Determine the expressions for the velocity
and and acceleration vectors that the observer and captain measure for balls B and
C.

To determine ~vB we use Eq. (9.77) with ~vO0 = ~0:

Note that you can either use the unit vectors from the x0y0z0 or the xyz-system, as
long as you make sure not to take cross or dot products between them, since the
relations like Eq. (3.32) do not hold if the unit vectors are not perpendicular to each
other.
To determine ~aB we use Eq. (9.78) with ~aO0 = ~0, ~aB/O0 = ~0 and ~↵S = ~0:
~aB

(9.94)
We see that the acceleration consists of a Coriolis contribution perpendicular to
the velocity in the moving frame and a centripetal contribution pointing towards
the moving origin O0. For the observer on the shore it is easier if we transform these
vectors to the unit vectors in the xyz-system that she is using. We use the angle
φS = arctan(3/4) or the properties of a 3:4:5 triangle for this projection:
ˆı0
=
cos(φS)ˆı + sin(φS)ˆ|
(9.95)
=

(9.96)

(9.97)
=
−3/5ˆı + 4/5ˆ|
(9.98)
ˆk

(9.99)
However, an easier solution is to rotate the xyz-axes that the observer on the wall is
using, since then we can directly set ˆı0 = ˆı,ˆ|0 = ˆ| and ˆk
0 = ˆk.
Now we are going to determine the kinematics of ball C and vectors ~v0
C/O0 and
~a0

(9.105)

S~rC/O0
(9.106)
In the second step we used Eq. (9.103). Again the acceleration consists of a Coriolis
contribution perpendicular to the velocity vector in the IRF and a centripetal
component that points towards the origin of the moving frame.
9.7.6 Transport theorem*
To derive Eq.(9.77)and Eq.(9.78), we will ﬁrst introduce the transport theorem.
The transport theorem relates the time derivative of a vector
d
dt~f in a ﬁxed
system xyz to its time derivative d
dt~f
0 as measured in a reference frame x0y0z0
that rotates with angular velocity vector ~! with respect to the ﬁxed frame.
Concept. Transport theorem
The time derivative of a vector function ~f(t) described in an IRF is related to
the time derivative of the same vector function ~f(t) as measured in a reference
frame S that is rotating with angular velocity vector ~!, by the transport equation:
d~f
dt =
 
d~f
dt
!0
+ ~! ⇥~f
(9.107)
Let us explain why the transport theorem tells us that time derivatives of
vectors are di↵erent in a rotating reference frame than in a ﬁxed reference
frame. A vector represents a certain magnitude and direction in space that
is independent of the coordinate system in which it is measured. However,
when taking a time derivative of such a vector one actually takes the di↵erence
between two vectors measured at two di↵erent times t and t + dt, e.g. for
~v(t) = limdt!0(~r(t + dt) −~r(t))/dt. If the coordinate system is rotating, the
vector ~r(t+dt) is measured with respect to coordinate axes that have a di↵erent
orientation than those for which ~r(t) was measured. As a consequence, vectors
that are time derivatives of other vectors, in particular ~v(t) and ~a(t), can
be di↵erent (~v0 6= ~v) if they are measured in di↵erent, relatively rotating or
translating, coordinate systems and the transport theorem provides a way to
relate them. In this context it is important to note that Newton’s second

182
9 KINEMATICS OF RIGID BODIES
law deﬁnes forces in terms of an acceleration vector in a non-rotating inertial
reference frame (IRF). By this deﬁnition it is ensured that force vectors (and
moment vectors, see Ch. 10) are independent of the coordinate system and do
not need to be transformed using the transport theorem.
Derivation. Transport theorem
Let us derive the transport theorem for the speciﬁc case of the vector function
~f(t) that is measured both in a ﬁxed reference frame xyz and in a rotating
coordinate system x0y0z0 that has constant angular velocity ~!.
At every time, the vector can be described as ~f = fx(t)ˆı0(t) + fj(t)ˆ|0(t) +
fz(t)ˆk
0(t). The main point in the derivation is that for an observer that moves
(and rotates) along with the rotating system x0y0z0 the unit vectors ˆı0, ˆ|0 and
ˆk
0 do not depend on time, whereas for an observer in a ﬁxed reference frame
their direction is time-dependent. The observer that moves along with the
rotating coordinate system measures the time derivative of ~f to be:
 
d~f
dt
!0
= ˙fxˆı0 + ˙fyˆ|0 + ˙fzˆk
0
(9.108)
The observer that is at rest in the ﬁxed system xyz also measures the time
derivative and ﬁnds, using the product rule:
d~f
dt = ( ˙fxˆı0 + ˙fyˆ|0 + ˙fzˆk
0) + (fx
dˆı0
dt + fy
dˆ|0
dt + fz
dˆk
0
dt )
(9.109)
When analysing the time derivatives of unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates
we found in Eq. (5.72) relations like dˆ⇢
dt = ~! ⇥ˆ⇢, and it can be shown that
these relations hold for any unit vector in a rotating frame that is observed
from a ﬁxed reference frame like dˆı0
dt = ~! ⇥ˆı0, such that Eq. (9.108) and (9.109)
result in the transport theorem:

9.7.7 Derivation kinematics in a rotating reference frame*

9.8 Summary
In this chapter we have analysed the kinematics of rotating rigid bodies. The
motion of a rigid body can be considered as the combination of a translation
of a certain reference point on the rigid body, and the rotation of the rigid
body around an axis through that point. Velocity and acceleration vectors
of the reference point can change in time, and so can the angular velocity
and acceleration vectors of the rotation around the axis. In this textbook we
mainly focus on the planar kinematics where the point masses move in the
two-dimensional xy-plane and angular velocity and acceleration vectors point
in the z-axis direction. We present the expressions for the velocities ~vB and ~aB
for points in the rigid body, or point masses moving inside a rotating reference
frame.

10 Kinetics of Rigid Bodies
In the previous chapter we have derived methods for analysing the kinematics
of rigid bodies. Now we will use Newton’s laws to evaluate how rigid bodies
move in the presence of forces and derive their equations of motion. Whereas
point masses can only translate, rigid bodies can also rotate, the key challenge
we will therefore address is how rigid bodies rotate under the inﬂuence of forces.
10.1 E↵ect of a force on a rigid body
A rigid body is nothing else than a collection of many point masses that are
rigidly connected and relatively constrained. So it can be analysed by the
techniques we discussed earlier in Ch. 6. In this chapter we will introduce
new techniques to facilitate such analysis, but before introducing these new
techniques, let us give an example where we analyse the kinetics of a rigid
body using the techniques from Ch. 6.

10 KINETICS OF RIGID BODIES
M Example 10.1 Problem: Consider the rigid body C in Fig. 10.1 that consists
of 2 point masses A and B connected by a rod of length L. A force ~F B = −FBˆ|
acts on mass B.
• Determine the angular acceleration of C if the horizontal rigid body, with
φ = 0 is released from rest.
To solve this problem we ﬁrst consider the constraint equation of the rod (constant
length L) and take its time derivative twice:
|~rB/A|2
=
L2
(10.1)
x2
B/A + y2
B/A
=
L2
(10.2)
2xB/A ˙xB/A + 2yB/A ˙yB/A
=
0
(10.3)
˙x2
B/A + xB/A¨x2
B/A + ˙y2
B/A + yB/A¨y2
B/A
=
0
(10.4)
xB(¨xB −¨xA)2
=
0
(10.5)
¨xB
=
¨xA = 0
(10.6)
In the last steps we used that for the current position and at zero velocity the
constants yB/A = xA = ˙xB/A = ˙yB/A = 0 are zero. The last equation shows that if
the rod is horizontal and has zero velocity, then the constraint equalises accelerations
of the point masses in the x direction, but not in the y direction. Since there are no
forces acting in the x-direction, we conclude that the masses don’t accelerate in that
direction.
Now we write down the equation of motion in the y direction for mass A and
mass B:
X
FA,y
=
0 = mA¨yA
(10.7)
X
FB,y
=
−FB = mB ¨yB
(10.8)
Now the ﬁnal step is to determine the angular acceleration ↵C using the kinematic
equations from the previous chapter. Using that ~aA = ~0, !C = 0 and ˆφA = ˆ| we
get:
~aB,2D
=
~aA + ↵C|~rB/A|ˆφA −!2
C~rB/A
(10.9)
−FB/mB ˆ|
=
↵CL ˆ|
(10.10)
↵C
=
−FB/(mBL)
(10.11)
Although this example demonstrates that it is possible to analyse the the e↵ect of
forces on the dynamics of rigid bodies with Newton’s laws, both translation and
rotation, it becomes very elaborate for rigid bodies consisting out of many point
masses. In this chapter we will derive a simpler method to do this.

10.2 KINETICS OF THE COM AND EULER’S FIRST LAW
187
10.2 Kinetics of the CoM and Euler’s ﬁrst law
In the previous chapter we saw that only 3 coordinates are needed to determine
the position and orientation of a rigid body F: xA, yA and φF . If we set
point A at the CoM (A = G) and apply Euler’s ﬁrst law Eq. (8.11) to the rigid
body, we can directly obtain the equations of motion for the coordinates of the
CoM xG and yG:
X ~F ext
=
mtot~aG
(10.12)
X
Fext,x
=
mtot¨xG
(10.13)
X
Fext,y
=
mtot¨yG
(10.14)
Since we can use these equations (Euler’s ﬁrst law) to determine the trajectory
~rG of the centre of mass G of a rigid body using kinematics, we now only have
to determine the angular motion φ(t) to fully analyse the motion of the rigid
body and determine its position and orientation at every time using kinematic
equations like Eq. (9.4). Determining the e↵ect of forces on the time dependent
rotation angles φ(t) will be the main objective of this chapter.
10.3 Rotation analysis in kinetics
Since the derivation of the key equations governing rotations in rigid body
dynamics is quite elaborate, we start by introducing the equations in this
section without deriving them. Then we explain how they should be used in
kinetic analysis of rigid bodies and ﬁnally present the derivations in sections
10.8–10.10.
10.3.1 Moments
The use of moments is a technique to facilitate the analysis of the e↵ect of forces
on the rotations of rigid bodies and other systems of point masses. Moments
are deﬁned as follows (see Fig. 10.2).
Deﬁnition. Moment
The moment vector ~
M B/P of a force ~F B (with point of action ~rB) with respect
to a reference point ~rP is deﬁned as the cross product ~rB/P ⇥~F B.
~
M B/P ⌘~rB/P ⇥~F B

Figure 10.2: A force ~F B acts on point B of rigid body C. A reference point P is chosen.
The moment of force B on C with respect to P is: ~
M B/P = ~rB/P ⇥~F B. The
magnitude of the moment is indicated by the area of the red parallelogram. If
P lies on the line of action of ~F B the moment is zero.
When using moments to analyse rigid body dynamics, for example with
an FBD it is essential that all moments are determined with respect to the
same reference point P. Furthermore, it can be shown that the sum of all
internal moments on the rigid body is always zero (see Fig. 10.3), such that the
resultant moment on the system is equal to the sum of all external moments,
i.e. moments generated by external forces, as will be derived in Eq. (10.63).
Concept. Moment on a system or rigid body
The resultant moment vector ~
M C/P,ext acting on a system of point masses C
with respect to a reference point P is the sum over the moments of the external
forces with respect to P.
~
M C/P,ext =
X
i
~
M i/P,ext =
X
i
~ri/P ⇥~F i,ext
(10.16)
Because the sums of internal moments and forces on a system or rigid body
are zero, they do not a↵ect the kinetics. For that reason only external moments
and external forces ~F ext should be drawn in an FBD. In fact, a key purpose
of an FBD is to deﬁne the di↵erence between internal and external forces,
since all objects drawn in the FBD can be considered to be internal and their
forces should not be drawn, whereas all drawn forces are generated by external
objects that are not drawn.

10.3 ROTATION ANALYSIS IN KINETICS
189
Figure 10.3: One external force ~F 2,ext acts on a system of 2 point masses that is bounded
by the dashed circle. The sum of the internal forces and internal moments is
always zero, independent of the choice of reference point P. So, the resultant
moment on the system is equal to the sum of the external moments.
10.3.2 Angular momentum
We now deﬁne the angular momentum vector ~L of a point mass (see Fig. 10.17),
which is used to analyse rotating motion, similar to the way momentum ~p is
used for translational motion as described in Ch. 8.
Deﬁnition. Angular momentum of a point mass
The angular momentum vector ~Li/P of a point mass at position ~ri with mo-
mentum vector ~pi, is deﬁned as the cross product ~ri/P ⇥~pi.
~Li/P ⌘~ri/P ⇥~pi = ~ri/P ⇥(mi~vi)
(10.17)
Concept. Angular momentum of a system or rigid body
The total angular momentum ~LC/P of a system of point masses C, with respect
to reference point P is equal to the sum of the angular momentum vectors of
its individual point masses.
~LC/P =

~Li/P =

10.3.3 Euler’s second law
We now introduce Euler’s second law that will be derived in Sec. 10.10.
Concept. Euler’s second law
Euler’s second law for a system or rigid body C states that the time derivative
of the total angular momentum of C is equal to the total moment from external
forces acting on C. The total angular momentum should be determined with
respect to the same reference point P that is ﬁxed in an IRF or is the CoM of
C.

(10.21)
Euler’s ﬁrst law, and Euler’s second law together provide the full equations
of motion for a rigid body and are therefore very useful and important for
analysing their dynamics. For planar kinetics of rigid bodies Euler’s second
law can be simpliﬁed:

(10.22)

10.4 SOLVING THE PLANAR EOM FOR RIGID BODIES
191
10.4 Solving the planar EoM for rigid bodies
After having discussed Euler’s second law, we will now show how it is used
to predict rotational motion of rigid bodies. Together with Euler’s ﬁrst law
(P
i ~F i,ext = mtot~aG, Eq. (8.11)), it provides three scalar equations of motion
(EoM) to analyse the planar dynamics of rigid bodies.
With Euler’s laws, the translation and rotation of rigid bodies can be solved
for, using very similar methods as were outlined in Sec. 6.4 for the kinetic
analysis of point masses. The main novel aspect is the determination and
solution of the rotational EoM that follows from Euler’s second law, including
the moments and angular accelerations. Let us summarise the procedure
for solving the equations of motion for the planar kinetics of a rigid body,
step-by-step:
1. Sketch the rigid bodies, massless mechanisms, force vectors, moments,
distances, dimensions and constraints.
2. Choose and draw a suitable coordinate system (CS) and reference point
P for moments.
3. Determine the constraint equations.
4. Determine the CoM ~rG and moment of inertia IG for each rigid body.
5. Draw the free-body diagram (FBD) for each rigid body. Add both forces
and moments1.
6. Project force, moment and kinematic vectors onto the CS to obtain scalar
components (like Fx, aG,x, Mz and ↵z).
7. Determine the 3 equations of motion per rigid body. Two equations, for
aG,x and aG,y from Euler’s ﬁrst law, and one from Euler’s second law to
determine ↵z.
8. Simplify the EoM by combining them and using constraint equations.
9. Solve the simpliﬁed (di↵erential) equations of motion (EoM), determining
velocity and motion using integration or other methods.
This procedure follows to a large extent the methodologies for point masses
that were discussed in Ch. 6. Nevertheless, there are some new aspects that
need to be considered for rotating rigid bodies like:
• Selecting the easiest point of reference P for analysing the problem. In
principle every point can be chosen, but the analysis can be facilitated if
it allows simplifying moment or kinematic expressions (Sec. 9.5.3). The
1Don’t draw items double, only draw moments explicitly if they are not represented as a
force.

192
10 KINETICS OF RIGID BODIES
choice of the point P will not a↵ect the dynamics, a smart choice can
however simplify the calculation.
• For Euler’s second law to hold, the reference point P should be a ﬁxed
point in an IRF, any ﬁxed point P in an IRF can be chosen. Alternatively
the point G that moves along with the CoM of the rigid body, or system
of point masses, can be chosen.
• It is important to use the same reference point P both for the moment
and the angular momentum.
• Often, one ﬁrst needs to use Euler’s ﬁrst law and solve the corresponding
EoMs to determine ~aG, before the term ~rG/P ⇥(m~aG) in Euler’s second
law Eq. (10.22) can be evaluated to solve for the angular acceleration.

Euler’s laws.
• Determine the angular acceleration of the dumbbell-shaped rigid body C in
Fig. 10.5.
We assume that the two masses are identical mA = mB = m and follow the steps
introduced in this chapter.
• Step 1 and 2: First we use the sketch in Fig. 10.5 and also indicate the
Cartesian coordinate system and corresponding unit vectors in it.
• Step 3 and 4: The motion is unconstrained and the equation for the CoM is:
~rG = mA~rA + mB~rB
mA + mB

2Lˆı
(10.23)

10.5 MOMENT OF INERTIA
193
The moment of inertia with respect to the CoM can be shown to be IG = 1
2mL2.
We choose the CoM as the reference point for rotations, so P = G.
• Step 5: Now we draw the FBD in Fig. 10.6 according to the guidelines given
in Sec. 6.8. It is important not to draw it in the ’trivial’ horizontal position,
but at an angle φ.
• Step 6: We project the forces, moments and kinematic vectors: ~F B = −FBˆ|,
~
M B/G = ~rB/G ⇥~F B = −rB/G,xFBˆk = −L
2 cos(φ)FBˆk. Furthermore we have
~aG = aG,xˆı + aG,yˆ| and ~↵C = ↵C ˆk.
• Step 7: We ﬁrst apply Euler’s ﬁrst law P ~F = mtot~aG.
X
Fx = 0
=
2maG,x
(10.24)

Fy = −FB

(10.25)
Now we apply Euler’s second law MGˆk = ~rG/P ⇥(mtot~aG) + IG↵ˆk. Since
P = G the vector ~rG/G = ~0. Thus we have:
−L
2 cos(φ)FBˆk = IG↵C ˆk
(10.26)
• Step 8: By rewriting the last 3 equations, the simpliﬁed EoMs become:
aG,x = ¨xG

(10.27)
aG,y = ¨yG

↵C = ¨φ

(10.29)
where we used in the last step that IG = 1
2mL2 and φ = 0 in our case. Note
that the result for ↵C is identical to that in Eq. (10.11), as expected.
• Step 9: In step 8 we have determined ↵C as requested. To obtain the full
time dependence of xG(t), yG(t) and φC(t) we would have to solve the EoMs
di↵erential equations.
10.5 Moment of inertia
10.5.1 Inertia tensor
In Sec. 10.3.2 we have introduced the moment of inertia to simplify the de-
scription of the angular momentum of rigid bodies. Let’s discuss it in more
detail now.
Deﬁnition. Inertia tensor

(10.30)
The diagonal components of the inertia tensor are called the moments of
inertia, and as will be derived later in Eq. (10.79) they can be calculated as
follows:
IG,zz =
X
i
mi⇢2
i/G
(10.31)
The o↵-diagonal terms of the inertia tensor are called products of inertia. As
an example IG,zz can be written as:
IG,xz = −
X
i
mixi/Gzi/G
(10.32)
It can be seen that if the rigid body has mirror symmetry in the zi/G = 0
plane, or if it is axisymmetric around the z-axis, the products of inertia IG,zx
and IG,zy are zero. E.g. because the contributions for zi/G and −zi/G cancel
each other. In this textbook we focus only on rigid bodies with either of those
properties, such that we only need to calculate the moment of inertia Izz.

10.5 MOMENT OF INERTIA
195
10.5.2 Calculation of the moment of inertia
The moment inertia of a rigid body can be calculated by summing the contribu-
tion mi⇢2
i/G of every point mass i, however often we are dealing with continuous
materials with a constant mass density ⇢m in kg/m3. In those cases the body
can be subdivided into inﬁnitesimal volumes dV with mass dm = ⇢mdV and
contribution to the moment of inertia ⇢2
i/Gdm. The moment of inertia can
then be calculated by integration over the total volume V of the rigid body.
IG,zz =

i
mi⇢2
i/G =

⇢m⇢2
i/GdV
(10.33)
Note that ⇢i/G is the distance of a point i from the axis parallel to the z-axis
that goes through G. Let us give a few examples of how this integral can be
performed, where the CoM is positioned in the origin of the coordinate system.
S Example 10.3 Moment of inertia of a block
For a block with dimensions Lx, Ly, Lz along the three axes, we use ⇢2 = x2 + y2
to determine its moment of inertia by integrating over its volume along each of the
three axes:

Note that the triple integral is solved in 3 steps, starting with the innermost
integral going from right to left, ﬁrst integrate over z, then over x and ﬁnally over
y. Multiplicative terms over which we don’t integrate can be moved to the left,
out of the integral. In the last step we used that mass is density times volume
m = ⇢mLzLxLy.
Moment of inertia of axisymmetric bodies
When an object is axisymmetric, it is easiest to determine its moment of inertia
by using cylindrical coordinates. An inﬁnitesimal volume element in these
coordinates has a volume dV = ⇢dφd⇢dz, where the size in the ˆφ direction
is given by the inﬁnitesimal circle segment ⇢dφ.
The outer surface of an

196

axisymmetric object can be described by a function ⇢d(z) or alternatively by
zh(⇢). We will show two examples to illustrate integration of ⇢m⇢i/G over
either volume to obtain the moment of inertia of a cone with radius R and
total height h.

rigid bodies is a good practice in volume integration skills.
10.5.3 Parallel axis theorem
We have now a method to calculate the moment of inertia of a rigid body with
respect to its CoM. But often a reference point P is chosen that is di↵erent
from G. In that case one can redo the integrals again and obtain IP,zz, but
there is an easier way to determine IP,zz from IG,zz, because as will be shown in
Eq. (10.72), the angular momentum with respect to a point P can be written as

10.5 MOMENT OF INERTIA

Now from the last two equations we can determine IP,zz, this method is
called the parallel axis theorem or Steiner’s theorem.
Concept. Parallel axis theorem
The moment of inertia of a rigid body around an axis through a point P, at
a distance ⇢G/P from its CoM, equals the moment of inertia mtot⇢2
G/P of its

its CoM.

Determine the moment inertia Izz,P of the rectangular rigid

Since the rigid body lies in the xy-plane we have ⇢G/P = |~rG/P |. The moment of
inertia IG,zz of a rectangle can be determined using Eq. (10.37). Then with the

for every point mass, the moment of inertia of a rigid body C that is made up
out of two (or more) other rigid bodies A and B can be calculated by summing
the moments of inertia around the same axis P:
IC,P,zz = IA,P,zz + IB,P,zz
(10.46)
Make sure you use the same reference point P when making such additions.
Similarly, it is also possible to subtract moments of inertia from one another,
for instance to determine the moment of inertia of objects that have a hole.

axis P that is not the CoM of the rigid body can be determined.
10.6 Euler’s second law for special cases
We now discuss a few special types of motion that can be analysed with Euler’s
second law.
10.6.1 Pure translation
In the case of pure translation, we have no angular acceleration ~↵= ~0, which
is the case if the moment of all external forces with respect to the CoM is zero
( ~
M C,G = ~0). This situation is for instance valid for the moments generated in
a constant gravitational ﬁeld, or when constraint equations prevent rotations.
Then Eq. (10.22) becomes:
If :
X
i
~
M C,i/G
=
IG,zz↵C ˆk = ~0
(10.47)
X
i
MC,i/P,2Dˆk
=
~rG/P ⇥(mtot~aG) = ~rG/P ⇥
 X
i
~F i,ext
!
It can be seen that once it is known that ~↵C = ~0, Euler’s second law on
the moments does not provide additional useful information beyond Euler’s
ﬁrst law that determines the acceleration of the CoM of the rigid body via
P
i ~F i,ext = mtot~aG.

10.6 EULER’S SECOND LAW FOR SPECIAL CASES
199
10.6.2 Pure rotation around the centre of mass
It is interesting to consider the situation where the term mtot~aG = ~0 is zero
because the sum of forces on the rigid body is zero, since it signiﬁcantly
simpliﬁes Eq. (10.22), with the disappearance of the term ~rG/P ⇥(mtot~aG).
If :
X
i
~F i,ext
=
mtot~aG = ~0
(10.48)
Then :
X
i
MC,i/P,2Dˆk
=
IG,zz↵C ˆk
(10.49)
We thus ﬁnd in Eq.(10.49)that the CoM of the rigid body does not accelerate
and the acting moments purely cause an angular acceleration ↵C of the rigid
body.
10.6.3 Couple
We saw in the previous subsection that a special situation arises if the sum of
the forces acting on a system is zero, since then ~aG = ~0. Such a combination
of forces is called a couple, and if there are only two forces it is called a simple
couple.
Concept. Simple couple
A simple couple consists of two forces ~F A = −~F B that are equal in magnitude,
and opposite in direction such that ~F A + ~F B = ~0, while the forces have di↵erent
points of action, such that their resultant moment is not zero.
Besides simple couples, that consist of two forces, there is also a more general
deﬁnition of a couple, that can consist of more than two forces.
Concept. Couple
A couple consists of a number of N forces for which the sum of forces is zero,
that generate a resultant moment on a system. So PN
i=1 ~F i,ext = ~0.
According to Euler’s second law, a couple only inﬂuences the angular accel-
eration ↵of a rigid body, it does not contribute to the acceleration ~aG of the
CoM because the sum of the forces is zero. The e↵ect of a couple is therefore
also called a pure moment or couple moment.
Another useful property of a couple is that its resultant pure moment is
independent of the choice of the location of the reference point P, as we will
derive now.

200
10 KINETICS OF RIGID BODIES
Derivation. Moment of a couple
Consider a simple couple generated by two force vectors with ~F A = −~F B acting
on points A and B. The moment of this couple with respect to a reference point
P is given by:
~
M couple
=
~rA/P ⇥~F A + ~rB/P ⇥~F B
(10.50)
=
~rA/P ⇥~F A −~rB/P ⇥~F A
(10.51)
=
((~rA −~rP ) −(~rB −~rP )) ⇥~F A
(10.52)
=
~rA/B ⇥~F A
(10.53)
From this equation we see that the couple vector ~
M couple is independent of
the choice of the reference point P and only depends on the force vectors of
the couple and their points of action ~rA and ~rB.
10.6.4 Pure rotation around a ﬁxed axis
Let us now consider pure rotation of a rigid body C about a ﬁxed axis P
parallel to the z-axis, which does not translate (~aP = ~vP = ~0). We choose
point P as reference point. There is no translation of this point, only the
angular acceleration of the rigid body ↵. As a consequence we have from
Eq. (9.29) that ~aG = ~↵⇥~rG/P −!2~rG/P . Substituting this into Eq. (10.22)
we obtain:
If : ~aP = ~vP = ~0
(10.54)
X
i
MC,i/P,2Dˆk
=
mtot~rG/P ⇥(~↵⇥~rG/P −!2~rG/P ) + IG,zz↵C ˆk

=
(mtot⇢2
G/P + IG,zz)↵ˆk
(10.55)
=
IP,zz↵ˆk
(10.56)
In the last step we used the parallel axes theorem Izz,P = mtot⇢2
G/P + IG,zz,
where ⇢G/P is the smallest distance between the parallel axes through G and
P. The conclusion from Eq. (10.56) is that for a rigid body C that rotates
in-plane around a ﬁxed axis P: the sum of the moments with respect to the
ﬁxed axis P equals the product of the moment of inertia Izz,P and the angular
acceleration ↵C of the rigid body C.

10.7 VECTORS IN DYNAMICS

10.7 Vectors in dynamics
In this textbook many di↵erent kinetic and kinematic vectors are introduced.
We summarise these vectors, their labelling and their dependence on reference
points.
10.7.1 Dependencies of vectors on reference points
When a single force ~F A acts on a rigid body C with point of action ~rA and
reference point ~rP for rotations, a variety of vectors are used to analyse the
dynamics. These vectors and their dependence on position vectors ~rA and ~rP
are summarised in Table 10.1.
Table 10.1: Dependencies of the vectors used to analyse the dynamics of a rigid body C with
CoM G, on the point of action A of force ~F A and the choice of reference point P.

Note that the subscript P is added to the vectors ~
M A/P and ~LC/P because
they depend on ~rP . It might seem strange that a moment vector can depend
on the choice of the reference point P, while the dynamics of the system (i.e.
the acceleration ~aG and angular acceleration ~↵C) do not depend on it. To
understand this, we repeat Euler’s second law for planar motion Eq. (10.22):
MC/P,2Dˆk = ~rG/P ⇥(mtot~aG) + IC/G,zz↵C ˆk
(10.57)
It can be seen that changing P only results in a change in the relative position
~rG/P , such that even for identical dynamics (~aG and ↵C both constant), the
moment vector ~
M C/P,2D acting on the system C can change. Another way to
look at is to realise that Eq. (10.22) shows that a moment vector ~
M C/P , that
originates from a force ~F A = mtot~aG, has two e↵ects: 1. Linear acceleration
of the CoM of the system, such that the angular momentum ~LC/P of G with
respect to P changes. 2. Generate an angular acceleration ~↵C. Only the ﬁrst

202
10 KINETICS OF RIGID BODIES
e↵ect depends on the choice of P. Remember that the reference point P should
either be chosen as a ﬁxed point in an IRF, or as the (accelerating) point
P = G that moves along with the CoM of the system C. It is not allowed to
choose another accelerating or rotating point as reference point P, since then
Euler’s second law does not hold anymore. Finally note that the dependence
of ~↵C and
d
dt ~LC/P on the point of action A of the force in Table 10.1 is not
a direct dependence, since you can calculate these vectors from kinematics
without knowing what A is (there is only a dependence on the point of action
via Euler’s second law), therefore A is not needed as subscript in these cases.
10.7.2 Labelling scalars and vectors in dynamics
As discussed in the previous subsection, the magnitude and direction of vectors
can depend on the point of reference and point of action, and therefore these
points have to be clearly identiﬁed to prevent making mistakes. Here we will
describe how to provide this kind of important information via labels (see also
Sec. 2.1.2). Labelling can save time, since it avoids having to writing for each
symbol a sentence like: ” ~
M A/P is the moment vector generated by force ~F A
(with point of action A) with respect to reference point P”. Labels reduce the
risk that confusion can occur about the meaning of a symbol. Here we provide
a few conventions we recommend for using labels in dynamics:
1. Every mathematical quantity (e.g. scalar, vector, tensor) should get a
unique symbol to identify it, conventions are:
• ~r, ~v, ~a are symbols for position, velocity and acceleration vectors.
• ~!, ~↵are symbols for angular velocity and acceleration vectors.
• m, I, ~p and ~L are mass, moment of inertia, momentum and angular
momentum vectors.
• ~F and ~
M are force and moment vectors (so e.g. don’t use ~N for a
normal force but instead use ~F N).
• W, V and T are work, potential energy and kinetic energy.
• ~J and ~H are impulse and angular impulse.
2. If the problem deals with multiple objects, each object should get a
unique label (letter, number, word), that is indicated in the sketch.
3. Every relevant point (e.g. position, CoM, point of action, reference point)
in the sketch should get a unique label.
4. Every quantity should get suﬃcient subscripts to deﬁne it uniquely. We
will use the following conventions for these deﬁnitions:
• ~rA, ~vA, ~aA get a subscript A to indicate the point or point mass A
to which they refer.

10.7 VECTORS IN DYNAMICS
203
• ~!C, ~↵C get subscripts C to indicate the system/rigid body C they
refer to.
• Each mass mC gets a subscript to identify the object C it refers to,
while a moment of inertia IC/P,zz also refers to the reference point
P. The component zz of the inertia tensor can be left out if it is
clear that one deals with planar motion in the xy-plane.
• ~pC = mC~vC,G is the momentum of object C with total mass mC
and ~LC/P is its angular momentum vector with respect to reference
point P.
• ~F A is a force that acts on point of action A. A label to indicate
the source of the force can be added, like ~F rope,A. If two objects i
and j generate forces on each other, then ~F ij is the force acting on
i and ~F ji is the force acting on j, with ~F ij = −~F ji according to
Newton’s third law.
•
~
M A/P is the moment vector as a result of the force ~F A with respect
to reference point P. Note that we use the slash / with the meaning
’with respect to’ or ’relative to’ similar as in relative position vectors.
• ~JA,12 is the impulse vector of a force A on the time interval between
t1 and t2 and ~HA/P,12 is the angular impulse vector of a force A
with respect to reference point P between t1 and t2.
• WA,12 is the work done by a force A between two states (times or
positions), VA is the potential energy of a force (ﬁeld) A and TC is
the kinetic energy of an object C.
5. In some cases quantities can be labelled uniquely with fewer subscripts.
E.g. if there is only one object with mass in the problem, that mass can
be given the label m without subscript, but it is never allowed to leave
out the reference point labels P for moments ~
M A/P , moments of inertia
IP,zz, angular momentum ~LP , and impulse vectors ~HA/P,12, since the
whole meaning of those quantities is tied to the choice of reference point
P.
6. The use of labels according to the conventions above is a replacement for
clearly deﬁning every symbol in words or equations separately. Providing
such a deﬁnition is also a valid approach.

10 KINETICS OF RIGID BODIES
10.8 Derivation moment on a system*
In this section we will derive and prove that the resultant moment of internal
forces on a system of point masses is zero, such that we only need to add the
moments of external forces to analyse the kinetics with Euler’s second law.
Derivation. Resultant moment on a system of many point masses.
If many forces are acting on a system C consisting of many point masses,
we can calculate the resultant moment ~
M C,P on the system with respect to a
single reference point P, by adding Eq. (10.15) for all point masses.
~
M C,P =
X
i
~
M i/P =
X
i
~ri/P ⇥~F i
(10.58)
Note that we always use the same reference point P for every moment in
the sum. The forces acting can be separated into external and internal forces,
where each point mass i experiences a moment due to the sum of external
forces ~F i,ext and due to the internal force vectors ~F ij acting on it by the other
point masses for which index j 6= i:
~
M C,P =
X
i
~
M i/P =
X
i
~ri/P ⇥~F i,ext +
X
i
X
j6=i
~ri/P ⇥~F ij
(10.59)
We know from Newton’s third law that the internal forces always come in
pairs, such that we have both moments ~ri/P ⇥~F ij and ~rj/P ⇥~F ji contributing
to ~
M C,P . When adding these, as illustrated for ~F 12,int and ~F 21,int in Fig. 10.3,
we get:
~ri/P ⇥~F ij + ~rj/P ⇥~F ji
=
(10.60)
~ri/P ⇥~F ij + ~rj/P ⇥(−~F ij)
=
(10.61)
(~ri/P −~rj/P ) ⇥~F ij
=
(10.62)
~ri/j ⇥~F ij
=
~0
(10.63)
Where we used that ~F ji = −~F ji from Newton’s third law and use that
~ri/j ⇥~F ij = ~0 because of the collinearity of the forces along the line connecting
the point masses, that is parallel to ~ri/j. From Eq. (10.63) we conclude that
every contribution to the resultant moment by an internal force ~F ij is cancelled
by another contribution by a force ~F ji. Therefore, the internal forces do not
contribute to the resultant moment acting on the system and Eq. (10.59) can
be simpliﬁed by only considering external forces.

10.9 Angular momentum of a rigid body*
10.9.1 Angular momentum of a point mass
Similar to the momentum ~pi = mi~vi (which is also called the linear momentum),
we deﬁned in Eq. (10.17) the angular momentum of a point mass as:
~Li/P ⌘~ri/P ⇥~pi = ~ri/P ⇥(mi~vi)
(10.65)
10.9.2 Angular momentum of a system
Using Eq. (10.65), we can now determine the angular momentum of a system
of point masses, by summing the angular momentum of all point masses, for
the same reference point P:
~LC,P =
X
i
~Li/P =
X
i
~ri/P ⇥(mi~vi)
(10.66)
Derivation. Angular momentum of a system using the CoM
Eq. (10.66) can be simpliﬁed, as we will derive below, by utilising the properties
of the CoM and these kinematic equations:
~ri/P
=
~rG/P + ~ri/G
(10.67)
~vi
=
~vG + ~vi/G
(10.68)
We substitute these two equations into Eq. (10.66), and use that the terms
that do not contain the index i can be taken outside of the sums:

206

X
i
mi~ri/G ⇥~vi/G
(10.71)
=
~LG/P +
X
i
~Li/G
(10.72)
We obtained four terms in Eq.(10.70), of which the middle two are zero, because
it follows from the deﬁnition of the CoM Eq. (7.37) that if P = G we have
P
i mi~ri/G = (P
i mi)~rG/G = ~0, and the same holds for its time derivative
P
i mi~vi/G = ~0.
We have thus derived with Eq. (10.72) that the angular momentum of a
system of point masses with respect to an arbitrary point P is identical to the
sum of the angular momentum of a point mass equal to the total mass mtot of
the system at the CoM with respect to point P, and the angular momentum
of the system with respect to point G, its CoM.
10.9.3 Angular momentum of a rigid body
The term P
i ~Li/G in the angular momentum expression Eq. (10.72) is still a
bit diﬃcult to evaluate, since it is a sum over many point masses. It can be
simpliﬁed for rigid bodies by making use of the property that we derived in
the previous chapter that all point masses in a rigid body C have the same
angular velocity !C.
Derivation. Angular momentum of a rigid body with respect to its CoM.
From Eq. (9.26) we have the kinematic equation that holds for all point
masses i in the rigid body:
~vi/G = ~! ⇥~ri/G
(10.73)
We substitute this equation in Eq. (10.71) for the angular momentum ~LC,G =
P
i ~Li/G for a rigid body with respect to its CoM:

In this derivation we used this vector identity for a triple product to obtain
Eq. (10.76): ~a ⇥(~b ⇥~c) = (~a · ~c)~b −(~a · ~b)~c. In Eq. (10.77) we introduced a
Cartesian coordinate system with origin G and z-axis in the direction ~! = !ˆk,
such that ~ri/G = xi/Gˆı + yi/Gˆ| + zi/Gˆk. In Eq. (10.78) we write the expression
in terms of the distance ⇢i/G to the z-axis with ⇢2
i/G = x2
i/G +y2
i/G. We also ﬁnd
that in 3D the angular momentum vector P
i ~Li/G is not necessarily parallel
to the angular velocity vector ~! since it also contains a term along the ˆı and
ˆ| directions. In the last equation Eq. (10.79) we simplify the expression by
introducing the components Izz, Ixz and Iyz of the inertia tensor IC of the
rigid body C, that follow from the equation ~L = I~!. The two subscripts, e.g.
in Izz, indicate the relation between the Lz and !z vector component.
10.9.4 Derivation of the inertia tensor
Note that a similar equation to the parallel axis theorem can be derived for
the products of inertia by substituting ~ri/P = ~ri/G + ~rG/P in Eq. (10.76) and
Eq. (10.79), while using the properties of the CoM:
IP,xz = −mtotxG/P zG/P + IG,xz
(10.80)
The full inertia tensor with respect to an arbitrary point P can thus be
written as the sum of an inertia tensor of the CoM IG,P and an inertia tensor
IC,G of object C with respect to the CoM:
IC,P = IG,P + IC,G

10.10 Derivation of Euler’s second law*
After having introduced the equations for angular momentum and moment
of inertia, we are now ready to analyse the e↵ect of moments on the rotation
of rigid bodies, and will show how Euler’s second law that was introduced in
Eq. (10.21), can be derived.
10.10.1 Euler’s second law
We ﬁrst extend Eq. (10.15) to a system of point masses C, with respect to the
same reference point P. The resultant moment ~
M C/P on C is then given by:
~
M C/P =
X
i
~
M i/P =
X
i
~ri/P ⇥(mi~ai)
(10.84)
To see how the right term of this equation is related to the properties of the
total angular momentum ~LC/P of C, we compare it to the time derivative of
Eq. (10.66):
d
dt
~LC/P
=
d

~Li/P = d
dt
X
i
~ri/P ⇥(mi~vi)
(10.85)
=
X
i
[mi~vi/P ⇥~vi + ~ri/P ⇥(mi~ai)]
(10.86)
To simplify this equation further, we would like to eliminate the terms
~vi/P ⇥~vi. There are two ways to ensure this:
1. Use a ﬁxed reference point P that has zero velocity and acceleration ~vP =
~aP = ~0 with respect to the origin of an IRF. Then ~vi = ~vi/P +~vP = ~vi/P .

10.10 DERIVATION OF EULER’S SECOND LAW*
209
Substitution into Eq. (10.85) results in a term ~vi/P ⇥~vi/P = ~0. Thus for
a ﬁxed point P we obtain from Eq. (10.86):
d
dt
X
i
~Li/P =
X
i
~ri/P ⇥(mi~ai)
(10.87)
2. Choose the CoM as the reference point. Then we substitute ~vi = ~vi/G+~vG
and get P
i mi~vi/G ⇥(~vi/G + ~vG) , where the terms ~vi/G ⇥~vi/G = ~0
are zero and where the term [P
i mi(~vi −~vG)] ⇥~vG is also zero because
P
i mi~vi = mtot~vG. Then we obtain from Eq. (10.86) and that equation
is even valid if G has a nonzero velocity or acceleration:
d
dt
X
i
~Li/G =
X
i
~ri/G ⇥(mi~ai)
(10.88)
Since the right side of Eq. (10.84) is identical to that of Eq. (10.87) and
Eq. (10.88), we obtain Euler’s second law.
Concept. Euler’s second law
Euler’s second law states that the total external moment acting on C equals
the time derivative of the total angular momentum of C, as long as a reference
point P is chosen that is ﬁxed in an IRF or the CoM G is used as reference
point.

=
d
dt
~LC/P
(10.89)
~
M C/G,ext

(10.90)
This equation relates moment and angular momentum in a similar way
as Newton’s second law ~F = d~p
dt = m~a relates force and momentum. The
subscript ext indicates that only external moments contribute to the resultant
moment on the rigid body.
10.10.2 Euler’s second law for a rigid body
Euler’s second law can be applied to rigid bodies by using the properties of the
angular momentum of rigid bodies that we have derived earlier in this chapter
in Eq. (10.71) and the inertia tensor Eq. (10.30), which can be combined to
obtain the total angular momentum of a rigid body C:
~LC,P = ~rG/P ⇥(mtot~vG/P ) + IC,G~!C
(10.91)

210
10 KINETICS OF RIGID BODIES
This equation is substituted in Eq. (10.89). By taking the time derivative of
Eq. (10.91), using that ~aP = ~0 in an IRF and using that ~vG/P ⇥~vG/P = ~0 we
obtain:

Eq. (10.92) shows that the resultant moment acting on a rigid body equals
the sum of the of three components. We will discuss all three of them, in
particular their relevance for the analysis of the planar kinetics of rigid bodies.
First there is the term ~rG/P ⇥(mtot~aG), which is due to the angular mo-
mentum of the centre of mass ~LG/P and becomes zero if the CoM is chosen
as a reference point because ~rG/G = ~0. Note that from Eq. (8.11) we have
P
i ~F i,ext = mtot~aG, which can help to evaluate ~aG and the contribution of
this term. Note that if we are dealing with point masses, we only have this
ﬁrst term.
The second term is d
dtIC,G~!C is relevant when the inertia tensor changes in
time. In the previous section we calculated IC,G with respect to a Cartesian
coordinate system. When an object changes orientation with respect to that
system, its inertia tensor can change because the moment and product of
inertia integrals change. However, in 2D planar kinetics all objects move in the
xy-plane and all forces are tangential to the xy-plane, such that all angular
velocity and angular acceleration acceleration vectors point in the z-direction,
and the same holds for the moment vectors. In planar kinetics, which is the
focus of this textbook, the orientation of the rigid body therefore does not
change such that we always have that the time derivative of the inertia tensor
d
dtIC,G is zero, which substantially simpliﬁes the dynamics, but eliminates
the occurrence of special dynamic e↵ects like precession that will be dealt
with when treating 3D dynamics. Note that another way to ensure that the
orientation of the rigid body with respect to the coordinate system does not
change is to ﬁx the coordinate system to the rigid body, and have it rotate
along with it. This is often the method of choice for analysing more advanced
rigid body dynamics problems but the drawback of that is that you are not in
an IRF anymore.
Finally we have the term IC,G~↵C. As discussed in the previous section, in
planar kinetics we only deal with rigid bodies with diagonal inertia tensors,
with both ~
M C,P and ~↵C pointing along the z axis, such that Izz is the only
relevant term in the inertia tensor, such that this term becomes Izz↵C ˆk. From

can be used to analyse many dynamic systems, as long as we keep in mind
that it is only valid for 2D planar systems.
10.11 Summary
In this chapter we have introduced the concepts needed to analyse the planar
kinetics of rigid bodies. The moments of forces were introduced, the angular
momentum of rigid bodies was calculated. The moment of inertia was deﬁned
and methods to determine it for solid continuous bodies were introduced.
Finally, this allowed us to determine Euler’s second law, and the equation
of motion for rotations of rigid bodies. In essence our toolbox to analyse
the planar dynamics of rigid bodies and point masses is quite complete now.
However, in some cases the principles of work and energy, and that of impulse
and momentum, can facilitate the analysis of the kinetics of rigid bodies. We
will extend these concepts and apply them to rotations in the next two chapters.

11 Work and Energy of Rigid Bodies
In the previous two chapters we have outlined the methodology for analysing
the kinematics and kinetics of rigid bodies. However, solving their equations of
motion by integration or other means is not always necessary. In this chapter
we introduce energy methods to analyse their dynamics, similar to what we
did for point masses in Ch. 7 but now also including moments and rotational
motion. In the ﬁrst sections we will derive the concepts of work and kinetic
energy for rigid bodies.
11.1 Work on a rigid body
11.1.1 Work of a force on a rigid body
If an external force ~F B acts on a rigid body on a single point of action, then
the work it does is equal to the work it would do on a point mass that is
located on the point of action ~rB. So, we can just use Eq. (7.2) to evaluate the
work done by such a force.
Concept. Work of a force on a rigid body
WB,1!2 =
Z ~r2
~r1
~F B,ext · d~rB
(11.1)
It is important to note that because a rigid body is not deformable, the
work done by internal forces on the rigid body is zero. This is obvious when
evaluating the work done in a reference frame where the rigid body is at rest,
since there all displacements d~r are zero, and is still valid when the rigid body
moves as a consequence of Newton’s third law. Since it is not deformable, a rigid
body also cannot store potential energy. Forces from deformable structures,
like springs, can perform work, even if they are internal components in a system.
So, if you have a system consisting of multiple elements, e.g. two rigid bodies
connected by a spring, then you do have to consider the internal forces of that
system when determining the work done on the system.

11 WORK AND ENERGY OF RIGID BODIES
11.1.2 Work of a couple on a rigid body
Concept. Work of a couple
The work done by a pure moment or couple on a rigid body is given by the
integral over the dot product between the moment vector and the inﬁnitesimal
angular displacement vector d~φ = dφˆk.

M couple · d~φ
(11.2)
Derivation. Work of a couple
A simple couple ~
M couple is generated by 2 equal and opposite external forces
~F A = −~F B that act on points A and B on the rigid body. We derive the work
done by the couple when the rigid body purely rotates around ﬁxed point A
(e.g. because the point is chosen to be at the CoM: A = G) such that the work
done by ~F A is zero and we only need to consider the work done by ~F B.

Here we used the vector identity ~a · (~b ⇥~c) = (~c ⇥~a) · ~b and used Eq. (10.53).
Note that the moment of the couple, and the resulting expression for the work
of a couple are independent of the reference point for rotations.
11.1.3 Work of a force ﬁeld
The situation becomes more complicated when the rigid body moves in a force
ﬁeld. Then the total work of the force ﬁeld can be determined by integrating or
summing the work over all point masses in the rigid body. This can sometimes
be quite complex if the force ﬁeld changes with position. But it is easier for

11.2 KINETIC ENERGY OF A RIGID BODY
215
a constant gravitational force ﬁeld which we already analysed in Eq. (7.43),
where we found that:
Wg,1!2 = −∆Vg = −mtot∆~rG · ˆ| = −mtot∆hG
(11.8)
So the work done on the whole rigid body by the gravitational force is equal to
the height reduction of the CoM times the total mass of the rigid body. Note
that the moment of the gravitational force on a rigid body is zero when the
CoM is taken as reference point, therefore it does no work when the rigid body
rotates around its CoM. This can be derived as follows.
Derivation. The moment of gravity on a system or rigid body is zero with
respect to its CoM.

11.2 Kinetic energy of a rigid body
As will be derived in Sec. 11.6, the kinetic energy of a rigid body C can be
written as a sum of a translational component TC,trans due to the speed ~vG of
the CoM and a rotational component TC,rot due to its angular velocity !C.

11 WORK AND ENERGY OF RIGID BODIES
11.3 Principle of work and energy
The principle of work and energy is the same for rigid bodies and rotations as
for point masses discussed in Ch. 7. The main di↵erence when working with
rigid bodies is that we include the work of moments and the kinetic energy
due to rotation of the rigid body. A second important point to consider is that
internal forces inside the rigid body do not perform work. So, we sum over all
work done by forces and all kinetic energies to obtain:
Concept. Principle of work and energy for rigid bodies
Wtot =

W1!2 =

T2 −
X
T1 = ∆Ttot
(11.15)
11.4 Conservation of energy and potential energy
Like in Sec. 7.2, the analysis of rigid bodies using work and energy principles
is facilitated when only conservative forces are acting on the system. For this
situation, the work done can be described in terms of the change in potential
energy since:
Wtot,cons = −∆Vtot
(11.16)
Combining this with Eq. (11.15) we obtain, just like in Eq. (7.13) that the total
energy does not change:
Concept. Law of energy conservation for rigid bodies
∆Vtot + ∆Ttot = 0
(11.17)
And for a large number of objects, the conservation of energy equation
between two times t1 and t2 is like Eq. (7.34):
X
i
Ti(t1) +
X
i
Vi(t1) =
X

(11.18)
We can still use the potential energy expression of forces derived in Sec. 7.3.

11.4 CONSERVATION OF ENERGY AND POTENTIAL ENERGY
217
S Example 11.1 Determine the speed of the yo-yo with radius R in Fig. 11.1 after
falling a distance ∆h from rest.
We ﬁrst note that the kinetic T1 and potential energy V1 are zero at t = t1, since the
yo-yo starts from rest. Then at t = t2 its gravitational potential energy has reduced
to a value V2 = −mg∆h. Since the force of the rope and the gravitational force are
conservative forces, we can apply the law of energy conservation to determine the
kinetic energy of the yo-yo at t2:
T1 + V1
=
T2 + V2
(11.19)
0 + 0
=
T2 −mg∆h
(11.20)
T2
=
mg∆h
(11.21)
To solve the problem we need the constraint equation set by the rope. If the angle φ
increases, the rope releases from the yo-yo and the y-coordinate of the CoM of the
yo-yo decreases:
−yG
=
∆h = φR + L0
(11.22)
vG,y
=
˙yG = −!R,
(11.23)
where we took the time derivative of the constraint equation set by the rope of the
yo-yo to relate it CoM velocity to its angular velocity. Now we write the equation
for the kinetic energy of the yo-yo T2, which is the sum of the translational and
rotational kinetic energy:

(11.27)
where we used that for a solid disk IG = 1
2mR2. Thus we obtain the velocity of the
CoM of the yo-yo. Note that the energy method does not give us the direction of the
velocity. But in this case, no forces act in the x direction and it is straightforward
to determine that it is downward ~vG = −
q

3g∆hˆ|. Note that this velocity is lower
than that of a free falling disk because part of the gravitational work is converted to
rotational kinetic energy.

11.5 Potential energy of a torsion spring
A special type of couple is a torsion spring which generates a couple proportional
to the angle by which it is rotated. For rotation of the torsion spring by an angle
φ with respect to its zero angle at φ = 0 around the z-axis, its angle-dependent
moment is:
~

In this chapter we have extended the energy methods from Ch. 7 to rigid
bodies. It was derived how moments contribute to the work on the rigid body
and how the angular velocity of rigid bodies increases their kinetic energy.

conservation concepts can also be applied to systems that include rigid bodies.

12 Angular Impulse and Angular
Momentum
In Ch. 8 we have introduced the principle of impulse and momentum and the
law of momentum conservation that hold for systems of point masses and for
rigid bodies. However, these laws do not provide information on the rotations,
or changes in the angular velocity of rigid bodies. In this chapter we will
extend these concepts to rotation of rigid bodies, thus providing a method
to analyse both the changes in velocity of the CoM and the changes in the
angular velocity ~!, when external forces and moments act on rigid bodies.
12.1 Principle of angular impulse and angular
momentum
Derivation.
To derive the principle of angular momentum and angular impulse, we start
from Euler’s second law that was found in Ch. 10, Eq. (10.89):
X
i
~
M i/P,ext = d
dt
X
i
~Li/P
(12.1)
This equation holds for the angular momentum of a system of point masses
with respect to a reference point P that is ﬁxed in space in an inertial reference
frame. The equation can be rewritten by multiplying both sides by dt and
integrating over a time interval from t1 to t2:
Z t2

~Li/P =

~Li/P (t1)
(12.2)
The integral on the left of Eq. (12.2) is deﬁned as the total angular impulse
acting on the system ~Hang,P,12:

(12.3)
Note that only external moments contribute to the angular impulse, since
internal moments sum to zero just like in Euler’s second law.
By rewriting Eq.(12.2)we obtain the principle of angular impulse and angular
momentum, which states that the change in the angular momentum of the
system is equal to the impulse generated by external moments on the system:

The change in angular momentum is equal to the angular impulse by external
moments acting on the system.

~Li/P (t1) + ~Hang,P,12 =

~Li/P (t2)
(12.4)
Since we are mainly concerned with the analysis of kinetics of rigid bodies,
we use Eq. (10.91) to derive the principle of angular impulse and angular
momentum of a rigid body for the case of 2D planar kinetics:
Concept. Principle of angular impulse and angular momentum for the planar
2D kinetics of a rigid body C
~rG/P,1 ⇥(mtot~vG,1) + IG!1ˆk +
Z t2
t1
MC/P ˆkdt
= ~rG/P,2 ⇥(mtot~vG,2) + IG!2ˆk
(12.5)
If we choose P = G this principle simpliﬁes to:
IG!1ˆk +
Z t2
t1
MC/Gˆkdt = IG!2ˆk
(12.6)
12.2 Choosing a convenient reference point
Although the principle of angular impulse and angular momentum equation
Eq. (12.5) can be used for any reference point P it can often be signiﬁcantly
simpliﬁed by a smart choice of the reference point P. Let us discuss some
convenient choices:

12.3 CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM
223
1. The centre of mass G of the system of point masses. This causes all the
cross products in Eq. (12.5) to disappear because ~rG/G = ~0 and results in
Eq. (12.6). Moreover, this is the only option for choosing an accelerating
reference point.
2. Since the moment of an external force is ~
M i/P = ~ri/P ⇥~F i, choosing
the point of action of that force as a reference point P = i will result in
the angular impulse of that point becoming zero because ~ri/i = ~0. This
is especially useful if the actual force ~F i is unknown.
3. In some cases the reference point P can be chosen such that either ~vG is
parallel to ~rG/P , or that one or more of the external forces ~F i is parallel
to ~ri/P , which can simplify the situation because either ~rG/P ⇥~vG = ~0
or ~ri/P ⇥~F i = ~0.
12.3 Conservation of angular momentum
A special situation is the case where the external angular impulse ~Hang,P
is zero. We substitute this condition in Eq. (12.4) and obtain that angular
momentum does not change in this situation:
Concept. Law of conservation of angular momentum
If the total angular impulse generated by external moments on a system with
respect to a ﬁxed reference point P is zero ( ~Hang,P = ~0), then the total angular
momentum of the system is conserved, and does not change in time.
X
i
~Li/P (t1) =
X
i
~Li/P (t2)
(12.7)
Whether or not conservation of angular momentum occurs can depend on the
choice of the reference point P. For example when a single external force ~F i
acts at a ﬁxed point of action i on a system, the reference point P can be
chosen at point i, or at any other point on the line of action of force ~F i, to
ensure that ~Hang,P = ~0 and the law of conservation of angular momentum
holds.
An important case for conservation of angular momentum are systems on
which there are no external moments and forces acting because in those systems
the law of conservation of angular momentum holds for any choice of reference
point P.
It is important to note that when analysing systems, the boundaries of the
system can be chosen arbitrarily. By expanding the system boundaries to
include all objects that generate forces, all forces will become internal forces,

224
12 ANGULAR IMPULSE AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM
and conservation of (angular) momentum for this expanded system will hold.
In the extreme case, the momentum and angular momentum of our whole
universe are expected to be constant, since there are no external forces and
moments acting on it, such that the law of conservation of momentum and
angular momentum hold.
12.4 Using angular impulse and angular momentum
In contrast to a point mass, a rigid body has both translational and rotational
degrees of freedom. By combining the methods from this chapter with those
from Ch. 8, we can fully analyse the changes in both the velocities and angular
velocities of rigid bodies. There are however two important limitations to these
methods:
1. Changes in position are not determined by this method, so the motion
needs to be known in advance, or the impulse needs to be so short that
the change in position can be neglected.
2. Suﬃcient information about the forces and their points of action is needed
to evaluate the angular impulse ~Hang,P,12. This is substantially easier if
the position of the point of action of the forces is approximately constant
(e.g. in short collisions) or if only pure couples are acting for which the
point of action is irrelevant.
Finally we note that in cases where (angular) impulse and momentum do
not provide enough information, it can sometimes be combined with energy
methods to solve a problem, e.g.
by combining conservation of (angular)
momentum with conservation of energy. Let us discuss an example.
S Example 12.1
Fig. 12.1 shows a ball A (a point mass), with mass m that
collides elastically with a dumbbell at rest BC that consists of two point masses B
and C with identical mass m.
Determine the velocities and angular velocities of the objects after the collision.
To solve this problem we ﬁrst note that because the collision is elastic, all forces
are conservative forces. Also we note that there are no external moments or forces
acting on the system (gravity is not indicated and can thus be neglected).
Secondly, we need to choose a reference point for analysing the rotations of the
system. A logical choice is to use the point ~rB as reference point. Since there
are no external forces or moments acting on the system we have conservation of
momentum and angular momentum, also we have conservation of energy. All forces
and velocities are in the x direction, so we only need to consider their x components.
This gives 3 equations, with three scalar unknowns after the collision: the velocity
of mass A vA,2,x, the velocity of the center of gravity of dumbbell BC vG,2,x and its

12 ANGULAR IMPULSE AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM
12.5 Summary
In this section we have extended the principles of momentum and impulse
to rigid bodies. This involved introducing the angular impulse and angular
momentum, and the principle relating them. In addition we discussed the law
of conservation of angular momentum, which holds when the total external
angular impulse on a system is zero.

13 Vibrations
13.1 Introduction
In our daily life there are many types of periodic phenomena. The day-night
rhythm, the waves on the sea, the trees swaying in the wind, a child going
back and forth on a swing and the beating of our heart. Any type of periodic
motion is called an oscillation. If an oscillation is of a mechanical nature, it is
called a vibration.
Vibrations can be very useful, for example in a pendulum or quartz clock to
keep track of time, or for generating sound tones with a speaker or musical
instrument. Vibrations can also be very detrimental in the case of shaking
buildings excited by earthquakes or in the uncontrolled resonant amplitude
increase (ﬂutter) of aircraft wings. It is therefore important for engineers to
have good models for vibrations, both to use them for engineering vibrating
devices, and for engineering methods to prevent their detrimental e↵ects.
In this chapter we will discuss several types of vibrations that are a direct
consequence of the combination of Newton’s second law and the properties of a
position or velocity dependent restoring force like that of a spring or a damper.
When writing down the equation of motion for such a system, according to the
methods discussed in Ch. 6, a second-order di↵erential equation arises that we
have not yet encountered before. It should be noted that analysis of vibrations
can be performed using the methods of kinetics that we have already dealt
with before, the main challenge in this chapter is solving the special types of
di↵erential equations that arise in vibration problems.
13.2 Free undamped vibrations
A mass-spring system is one of the simplest systems in which vibrations can
occur. It consists of a point mass A, at position coordinate yA,tot that is
hanging from the ceiling by a spring with spring constant k. Such a system
is a type of mechanical resonator. The motion of such a system is called
free undamped vibration. It is free or undriven because there is no external
periodic or time-dependent driving force, and it is undamped because there is

Figure 13.1: A mass A is suspended by a spring. When the spring is relaxed it has a length
L0. When it is in static equilibrium with the gravitational force, the spring has
a length L0 + yA,st. The displacement of the mass with respect to this static
equilibrium position is measured by position coordinate yA(t).
no damping force acting on the mass.
Fig. 13.1 shows a sketch of what happens if a mass is suspended by a spring.
First of all the spring has a relaxed length L0 even if there are no forces acting
on it. Then if the mass A is released it moves down by a distance yA,st to a
static equilibrium position for which the sum of forces is zero. Finally, if the
mass is displaced from that position by an amount yA the sum of forces is not
zero such that the mass accelerates.
We determine the free vibrating motion of a mechanical resonator similarly
to other kinetic problems, using the methods of Ch. 6. First we determine
the EoMs and then we solve them. The sketch and coordinate system are in
Fig. 13.1 and we draw the FBD in Fig. 13.2 to obtain the EoM:
X
Fy = mAg −k(yA,tot −L0) = mA¨yA,tot
(13.1)
This EoM is a so-called second-order ordinary di↵erential equation because
it contains the second time-derivative ¨yA,tot. In contrast to ODEs that we
encountered in Ch. 5 it cannot easily be solved by integration. Instead, we
solve the ODE by ﬁrst ﬁnding its particular solution and then its homogeneous
solutions.
Conveniently, an undriven mechanical resonator always has a static solution
with ¨yA,tot = 0 and yA,tot = constant as particular solution. Therefore, to solve

13.2 FREE UNDAMPED VIBRATIONS
231

free vibration problems, we always ﬁrst ﬁnd this static particular solution and
then determine the dynamic part of the motion by solving the homogeneous
ODE. This proceeds along the following steps:
1. Set the acceleration, velocity and other terms to zero and solve the EoM
for the static equilibrium position yA,tot = yA,st. This particular solution
is identical to the statics solution. If there are time-dependent functions
set them to their time-averaged value (so a term cos !t becomes zero).
2. Introduce a new coordinate yA(t) which has its datum (zero point) at
the static equilibrium point.
3. Substitute yA,tot = yA,st + yA(t) into the EoM. Then all static terms will
cancel out, and you obtain a ’dynamic’ homogeneous ODE which only
contains yA(t) and can be solved.
4. If you already know the equilibrium position, you can skip steps 1-3
above and deﬁne the coordinate yA with respect to that position, and
directly write down the dynamic EoM without the constant terms, since
you know that they will cancel out.
Let us illustrate this procedure.

232
13 VIBRATIONS
13.2.1 Determining the static equilibrium position
We ﬁrst solve for the particular static solution yA,tot(t) = yA,st for which
¨yA,tot = 0 and yA,st is a constant. Substitution in Eq. (13.1) results in:
mAg −k(yA,st −L0)
=
0
(13.2)
yA,st
=
mAg
k
+ L0
(13.3)
Thus we have found the static, time-independent solution yA,tot(t) = yA,st
of the ODE for which the y-coordinate of the mass is yA,st at all times. This
position is called the static equilibrium, equilibrium or rest position of the mass.
In this case, the static y-coordinate is the sum of the distance mAg
k
the spring
is elongated by the gravitational force and the relaxed length L0 of the spring.
13.2.2 Equation of motion with respect to equilibrium
The static solution with ¨yA,tot = 0, is a particular solution of the ODE.
However, it is not the only solution of the EoM, so let us now look for
time-dependent solutions of the ODE. We deﬁne a time-dependent function
yA(t) which represents the displacement of the mass with respect to the static
equilibrium position. The function yA(t) is added to the found static solution
such that the total displacement can be written as:
yA,tot = yA(t) + yA,st
(13.4)
If we substitute this function yA,tot into equation Eq. (13.1), we ﬁnd:
mAg −k(yA + yA,st −L0)
=
mA¨yA
(13.5)
−kyA
=
mA¨yA
(13.6)
Here we used Eq. (13.2) to eliminate yA,st. All constant, time-independent,
terms in the equation always sum up to zero, like they do in static equilibrium.
By rewriting Eq. (13.6) we ﬁnd the equation of motion for free undamped
vibrations in the form of the following ordinary di↵erential equation (ODE):
Concept. Equation of motion for free undamped vibrations
The equation of motion is a homogeneous second order linear ODE, that holds
at all times.
mA¨yA + kyA = 0.
(13.7)

13.2.3 Solving the equation of motion
In Ch. 5 we discussed how ﬁrst-order ordinary di↵erential equations (ODE)
can be solved by integration. The ODE in Eq. (13.7) can however cannot be
easily solved by integration. Instead the strategy1 to solve this ODE is to ﬁnd
a trial solution xA(t) of the right form with unknown parameters, substitute
it into the ODE and use the ODE and initial conditions to determine the
parameters. Since the ODE in Eq. (13.7) contains yA and its second derivative
¨yA it is logical to look for a trial solution that is a constant times its own
second derivative, like cos(!nt) or eλt.
Before starting with the solution, it is important to note that Eq. (13.7) is a
homogeneous linear di↵erential equation, because it only sums linear functions
of yA and its time-derivatives, which are equal to zero. These homogeneous
linear ODE have the following useful property: if we ﬁnd two di↵erent solutions
of this ODE, yA,1(t) and yA,2(t), then substituting each of them individually in
Eq. (13.7) gives zero, so their sum yA = yA,1 +yA,2 will also be a solution of the
ODE, and summing many times is the same as multiplying, so yA = c1 ⇥yA,1 is
also a solution. These summative and multiplicative properties of the solutions
of the ODE simplify the analysis of the motion signiﬁcantly. Moreover, they
allow solving the EoM with complex numbers, since if a complex function
yA = yA,r +iyA,i is a solution of the ODE, the functions yA,r and yA,i, which are
the real and imaginary part of yA, are also solutions of the ODE individually.
These ODEs can either be solved by trigonometric functions, or by complex
functions. If you are familiar with working with complex numbers, they often
make it simpler to solve the ODE. However, to make the reader familiar with
both methodologies, we provide both the trigonometric and complex solutions
in the derivation.
Derivation. Free undamped vibration of a mass spring system
Since we look for a function that is proportional to its own second derivative,
we use a trial solution of the form yA(t) = A cos(!nt + '0) = <Acei!nt where
< stands for the real part of the function and Ac = Aei'0. The value of the
parameters A, '0 and !n are unknown at this stage. Substituting this trial
solution into the ODE Eq. (13.1) we obtain:
1Although solving this kind of second-order ODE is part of most introductory calculus
courses, we discuss the procedure here for clarity.

that we derived before, so we now ﬁnd the solution of the EoM.

number A = |Ac| is the amplitude or magnitude of the vibration and the real
number '0 is its phase at t = 0. In some cases it is more convenient to write
the solution as a sum of a cosine and sine function with prefactors A1 and A2
as follows:
yA(t) = A1 cos(!nt) + A2 sin(!nt)
(13.17)
It can be shown that this equation is identical to that found in Eq. (13.12)
by substituting Ac = ei'0 and using Euler’s equation eix = cos x + i sin x and
taking the real part of the complex function:

vice versa. In Fig. 13.4 the relations between the motion yA(t) and these four
constants are visualised by a point moving along a circle with radius A.

13.2.5 Initial conditions
In the previous section we have found the solution of the ODE, however there
are still two unknown constants A and '0 (or A1 and A2) that need to be
found to know yA(t) at all times. Similar to the time integration in Eq. (5.34),
we now also need initial conditions yA(t1) = y1 and ˙yA(t1) = v1 to determine
the unknown constants as follows:
1. Determine the function yA(t) and its time derivative ˙yA.
2. Substitute t1 and write down the two equations yA(t1) = y1 and ˙yA(t1) =
v1.
3. Solve the two equations for the two unknowns, A1 and A2 or A and '0.
S Example 13.1 As an example let us consider the case where the initial conditions,
position yA(0) = y0 and velocity ˙yA(0) = v0 at t1 = 0 are known. We choose to use
Eq. (13.17), yA(t) = A1 cos !nt + A2 sin !nt and obtain the constants A1 and A2 as

!nA2 = v0
(13.25)
A2
=
v0/!n
(13.26)
By combining this with Eq. (13.4) and Eq. (13.17) we ﬁnd for the case that the
initial position y0 and velocity v0 are known that:
yA,tot(t)
=
A1 cos(!nt) + A2 sin(!nt) + yA,st
(13.27)
yA,tot(t)
=
y0 cos (!nt) + v0/!n sin (!nt) + yA,st
(13.28)
If required A and φ0 can be determined using Eq. (13.21) and Eq. (13.22)
13.3 Free damped vibrations
In practice a vibration is never completely undamped, since there are always
small practical imperfections that cause some kind of dissipation due to non-
conservative forces. The most common type of damping, that is also most
easily analysed, is by a velocity proportional force ~F c = −c~v, that is generated
by a piston or other linear damper element. The force points in the opposite
direction from the velocity vector of the mass, and thus the power done by such
a force on the mass is given by P = ~F c · ~v = −c|~v|2, which is always negative.
This causes the kinetic and potential energy of the mass-spring system to
reduce to zero.
When connecting a linear damper to the mass, in parallel to the spring, as
shown in Fig. 13.5, we obtain a mass-spring-damper system, we have from
Newton’s second law that ~F k + ~F c = mA~aA, which when projected along the
y-axis, results in the following equation of motion:

not a↵ect yA,st.

Derivation. Solving the EoM for free damped vibrations
To solve this equation of motion we propose the following complex trial
function:
yA(t) = <Aceλt.
(13.31)
In this equation both Ac and λ are complex numbers with a nonzero real and
imaginary part. Note that we only use a complex trial function and don’t
use a trial function with trigonometric equations since working with complex
numbers is a lot easier when working with damped vibrations. Substitution in
Eq. (13.30) results in:

(13.32)
Since this equation has to hold for all times t, the quadratic equation in the
square brackets has to be zero, and can be solved, to determine λ, using the
quadratic formula or ’ABC formula’, with A = mA, B = c and C = k:

The term ∆= c2 −4mAk is called the discriminant and depending on the
sign of ∆, we obtain three di↵erent values of λ that correspond to three quite
di↵erent types of solutions:
1. ∆> 0: Overdamped vibration, the values of λ are both real and negative

small damping c, this damped resonance frequency is almost equal to
the natural angular resonance frequency (!d ⇡!n). We then obtain two
values for λ that solve the EoM: λu,± =

2mA ± i!d.

3. ∆= 0: Critically damped vibration. In this case there is only one value
λ = −c/(2mA). The value of the damping coeﬃcient that belongs to this
situation ∆= c2
c −4mAk = 0 is called the critical damping coeﬃcient
cc = 2pmAk. For c > cc we have overdamped vibrations and for c < cc
we get underdamped vibrations.
Let us now determine the di↵erent solutions Eq. (13.31) of the EoM with these
values of λ.
13.3.1 Overdamped motion
Since λ is a real number for ∆> 0, we need to add the solutions of the EoM
for both values λo,± = −c±

to get a function that satisﬁes the equation of

For the case ∆< 0, the complex number Ac = Aei'0 can be substituted in
Eq. (13.31). Using the positive value2 λu,+ =

yA,u(t) = Ae−

2mA t<ei(!dt+'0) = Ae−

(13.39)
The motion consists of a fast oscillating cosine function with a slowly decaying
amplitude given by the exponential function. Just like in Sec. 13.2.4 one might
also choose to replace cos(!dt + '0) by the sum of a cosine and sine function,
in which case the solution is written as:
yA,u(t) = e−
c
2mA t [A1 cos(!dt) + A2 sin(!dt)]
(13.40)
13.3.3 Critically damped motion⇤
For the general solution of critically damped motion we have a problem,
since we have found only one value of λ that corresponds to the real solution
2Note that we could just as well have chosen λu,−, but that would have had the same
e↵ect as inverting the sign of '0 because cos x = cos(−x). For consistency with earlier
deﬁnitions we choose the positive sign.

13.3 FREE DAMPED VIBRATIONS
241
yA = A0e−c/(2mA)t. For this speciﬁc case it can by shown, as can be checked by
substitution in Eq. (13.30), that the function yA = Atte−c/(2mA)t also obeys the
EoM, such that the general solution for critically damped vibrations becomes:
yA,c(t) = A0e−
c
2mA t + Atte−
c
2mA t
(13.41)
As can be seen in Fig. 13.5 the critically damped vibrations approach zero
faster than the overdamped vibrations with the same damping c/mA.
13.3.4 More complex free vibrations
Up to now we only dealt with mass-spring and mass-spring-damper systems.
However, more complex systems can also result in the same equation of motion.
For instance, applying Euler’s second law to rotating rigid bodies connected
to springs leads to an EoM that is similar to that of the free vibration of a
mass-spring-damper system. Even though the constants and variables in that
EoM are di↵erent from yA, mA, k and c, the EoM can be written similarly by
introducing e↵ective functions ye, me, ke and ce, such that the EoM becomes:
me¨ye + ce ˙ye + keye = 0.
(13.42)
Here, the function ye(t) can represent a position coordinate but can also be an
angle, or any generalised coordinate that uniquely describes the position or
orientation of the system. Mathematically, the motion of these more complex
systems can be derived in exactly the same way as a mass-spring-damper
system, like discussed in previous sections. Only the constants me, ce and ke
and function name ye(t) are di↵erent. So, everything we have derived for the
mass-spring-damper system remains valid for these more complex systems.
13.3.5 Free vibrations: solution procedure
Finally, we discuss step-by-step the procedure for analysing free vibrations
discussed in this section and the previous one.
1. Sketch the system and coordinate system.
2. Draw the free-body diagram and project the force and/or moment vectors
on the coordinate axes. Determine the relevant constraint equations.
3. Use Newton’s second law and Euler’s ﬁrst law for translations and Euler’s
second law for rotations to determine the scalar equation of motion along
the relevant translation or rotation coordinate.
4. Determine the static equilibrium position yA,st by setting all time deriva-
tives in the EoM to zero ¨yA,tot = ˙yA,tot = 0 and solving for yA.

242
13 VIBRATIONS
5. Deﬁne the time dependent part of the motion as yA(t) = yA,tot −yA,st.
6. The system will only show free vibration if at least one of the EoMs can
be written in the form me¨ye + ce ˙ye + keye = 0.
7. Determine the equations for the variable ye and constants me, ce and ke.
Now one can either solve the ODE, like in the next step 8, or directly go
to step 9 and use the known solutions.
8. To solve the ODE, substitute the trial function ye = <Aceλt and its
time-derivatives into the EoM to obtain −meλ2 + ceλ + ke = 0. Solve for
λ and substitute it back into the trial function to ﬁnd the motion ye(t)
like explained in the previous sections.
9. If ce = 0, then we are dealing with free undamped vibration. In that case
the solution of the EoM is ye(t) = <Aei!nt+'0 = A cos(!nt + '0), with
natural resonance frequency !n =

ke/me.
10. If ce 6= 0 we are dealing with free damped vibration.

• If ∆= 0 we are dealing with critically damped free vibration with

11. Two initial conditions of the form ye(t1) = y1 or ˙ye(t2) = v2 need to be
solved to determine the two unknown constants in the solution (A & '0,
A+ & A−or A0 & At). See Sec. 13.2.5.
12. In some cases it is convenient to rewrite the cosine with phase-shift '0
into a sum of a cosine and sine using the mathematical equation:
A cos(!t + '0) = A1 cos(!t) + A2 sin(!t),
(13.43)
where A2 = A2
1 + A2
2 and tan('0) = −A2/A1.
S Example 13.2 Consider the car A, in Fig. 13.6 with a mass of m=1000 kg that
can be considered as a point mass. It has a spring sti↵ness of k=50000 N/m and a
damping constant of c = 1000 N·s/m. The car drops from a small height, such that
it reaches its equilibrium position yA(0) = 0 with a speed of v0 = −1 m/s at t = 0.
• Determine the motion yA(t) of the car.
We follow the steps from this section. The sketch and FBD are given in Fig. 13.6.

13.3 FREE DAMPED VIBRATIONS
243
Figure 13.6: Free damped vibration of a car suspension.
So, we project the forces and write down the equation of motion along the y-axis:
X
Fy = Fk,y + Fc,y + Fg,y
=
mA¨yA,tot
(13.44)
−k(yA,tot −L0) −c ˙yA,tot −mAg
=
mA¨yA,tot
(13.45)
−kyA −c ˙yA
=
mA¨yA
(13.46)
mA¨yA + kyA + c ˙yA
=
0
(13.47)
Here we used that yA,st = −mAg
k
+ L0 like in Eq. (13.2), and yA,tot = yA + yA,st
to eliminate the static particular solution. Although, since we are only asked for
the motion with respect to the equilibrium position, we could also have skipped
this step, and directly eliminate the static terms. Now we see that the equation of
motion Eq. (13.47) can be written in the form of Eq. (13.42), with ye = yA, me = mA,
ce = c and ke = k (we will encounter more complex cases later). Now we can
solve this EoM, like in Sec. 13.3. We will not repeat the derivation and directly
substitute the values of me, ce and ke in the solution. We ﬁrst determine that the
discriminant ∆= c2 −4mAk = −199⇥106 kg2/s2 is negative, such that we deal with
an underdamped vibration. Then we determine the damped resonance frequency as
!d =
p
ke/me −ce/(4m2e). The solution can then be written as:
yA(t) = Ae−(ce/2me)t cos(!dt + '0)
(13.48)
Finally we need to determine the constants A and '0 from the initial conditions.
Since yA(t = 0) = 0, we ﬁnd that '0 = ⇡/2. By taking the time derivative of yA,
with the product rule and using that ˙yA(0) = v0 we ﬁnd:
˙yA(0)
=
[−(ce/2me) cos(!d0 + ⇡/2) −!d sin(!d0 + ⇡/2)] Ae−(ce/2me)0 = v0
=
−!dA = v0 = −1 m/s,
(13.49)
from which we ﬁnd A. Thus we have fully determined all constants in Eq. (13.48),
and fully determined the motion yA(t).

13 VIBRATIONS
A Example 13.3 For the car in the previous example we now design the optimal
damping, that reduces the time for the amplitude to go to zero. The initial speed v0
and kinetic energy of the car is kept constant and the damping coeﬃcient c is varied
from underdamped c = 1
2cc, to critically damped c = cc to overdamped c = 2cc.
Plot the motion of the car for these three situations, and determine the optimal value
of c.
First we determine the constants !d =
q
k
m −
c2
4m2 , cc = 2
p
km and ∆= c2 −4mk,
and deﬁne !do =
p
∆/(2m). Then we use the initial conditions yA(0) = 0 and
˙yA(0) = v0 = −1 m/s, to determine the constants A⇤and '0 for the underdamped,
critically damped and overdamped motion. Check with some math that φ0 = ⇧/2
this results in:
yA,u(t)
=
v0te−
c
2m t sin(!dt)
!dt
(13.50)
yA,c(t)
=
v0te−
c
2m t
(13.51)
yA,o(t)
=
v0te−
c
2m t sinh(!dot)
!dot
(13.52)
We see that for a damping coeﬃcient c = cc the frequencies !d and !do approach
zero and because for small x we have sin x ⇡x and sinh x ⇡x, the three expressions
become equal. In Fig. 13.7 it can be seen the that the solution approaches zero fastest
when the damper is chosen to be critically damped with c = cc. The underdamped
motion damps slower because of the smaller value of c in the exponent, and the
overdamped motion is slower due to the slow decay of the A+ term in Eq. (13.38).
13.4 Forced vibrations
After having considered free vibrations we now turn to forced vibrations. In
a forced vibration there is an additional time-dependent external force ~F (t)
acting on the mass. These forced vibrations are important in examples like
clocks, vibrations in cars driving over a bumpy road, the beating of your
heart, audio speakers, and electromechanical frequency generators for data
transmission in your mobile phone.
Fig. 13.8 shows a sketch and FBD of a mass-spring-damper system driven
by a time-dependent force F(t) in the y-direction:
~F (t) = F0<ei!tˆ| = F0 cos(!t)ˆ|
(13.53)
Similar to Eq. (13.1) we obtain the equation of motion by projection of the
forces on the y-axis and using Newton’s second law:
X
Fy = mAg −k(yA,tot −L0) −c ˙yA,tot + F0<ei!t = mA¨yA,tot

13 VIBRATIONS
13.4.1 Determining the equilibrium position
Like for the free vibration we ﬁrst determine the static equilibrium position
by setting all time derivatives to zero: ¨yA,tot = ˙yA,tot = 0. Note, that if the
average value of the external force Favg is not zero, it needs to be included
in the determination of the static equilibrium position. However, for a cosine
function Favg = 0. We ﬁnd for the static equilibrium position in the presence
of vibrations:
mAg −k(yA,st −L0) + Favg
=
0
(13.55)
yA,st
=
mAg
k
+ L0 + Favg
k
(13.56)
So for F(t) = F0 cos !t, the static equilibrium position yA,st is identical to
that found for free vibrations.
13.4.2 Equation of motion with respect to equilibrium
Similar to the case of free vibrations, we substitute yA,tot(t) = yA(t) + yA,st
into Eq. (13.54), such that all static terms cancel and we obtain the EoM for
the displacement yA(t) of the mass with respect to the equilibrium position:
Concept. Equation of motion for forced damped vibrations
<
⇥
mA¨yA + c ˙yA + kyA = F0ei!t⇤
(13.57)
We see that the only di↵erence between the EoM for forced and free vibrations
is the forcing term F0<ei!t.
13.4.3 Particular and homogeneous solutions of the EoM
Let us assume we ﬁnd a particular solution yA,f(t) of the di↵erential equation
(13.57). Then we can add a solution yA,h(t) of the corresponding homogeneous
EoM, mA¨yA + c ˙yA + kyA = 0.
And then the resulting function yA(t) =
yA,f(t) + yA,h(t) is still a solution of the EoM Eq. (13.57) as can be seen here:
<
⇥
mA(¨yA,f + ¨yA,h) + c( ˙yA,f + ˙yA,h) + k(yA,f + yA,h) = F0ei!t⇤
(13.58)
The terms with yA,f(t) add up to F0ei!t and the terms with yA,h add up
to zero. The function yA,f(t) is called the particular solution of the ODE

13.4 FORCED VIBRATIONS
247
and yA,h(t) is the homogeneous (or complementary) solution of the EoM for
forced vibrations. We see that the di↵erential equation for yA,h(t) is identical
to that of a free damped vibration. So, we can just use the methods from the
previous section to analyse these solutions. Moreover, due to the damping,
these vibrations damp out after waiting for a suﬃciently long time after which
we are left with yA,f(t), which is therefore also called the steady-state solution of
the forced damped vibration EoM, while yA,h(t) is called the transient (part of
the) solution. We note that yA,h(t) has two free constants Ah and '0,h that still
need to be determined using the initial conditions. The procedure to determine
these constants using the initial conditions is identical to that explained in
section Sec. 13.2.5, although the equations for position and velocity are longer,
since they contain both the steady-state and transient part of the solution.
Figure 13.9: The general solution yA(t) of forced vibration is a sum of a steady-state solution
yA,f and a transient solution yA,h. Note that since the driving frequency !
can be di↵erent from the resonance frequency !d, beating e↵ects (Fig. 2.1) are
observed in the initial transient phase of the motion.
13.4.4 Solving the EoM for forced vibrations
Since the transient solutions yA,h(t) were already found from the free vibration
analysis, we only need to solve the particular, steady-state solution yA,f(t).

248
13 VIBRATIONS
Derivation. Forced damped vibration
To solve the EoM we are looking for an equation that is proportional to its
own time-derivatives and also proportional to the forcing function. Therefore
we attempt using a trial solution of the following form:
yA(t) = <Acei!t
(13.59)
Note that in contrast to the case of free vibrations, we do not solve for an
exponent λ that gives us a (damped) natural frequency, but instead we take the
forcing frequency ! directly into the trial function yA. Let us now show that
this trial function is indeed a solution of the di↵erential equation and determine
the complex amplitude Ac by substituting it into the EoM Eq. (13.57):
<
⇥
Acei!t '
−!2mA + i!c + k
(
= F0ei!t⇤
(13.60)
We see from this equation that our choice to choose ei!t as exponential function
was correct, since we can now divide both sides of this equation by ei!t to
eliminate it. Then the complex amplitude Ac needs to obey this equation to
ensure yA(t) is a solution at all times:
Ac(k −!2mA + i!c) = F0
(13.61)
By dividing both sides by the term between brackets we ﬁnd the complex
amplitude Ac of the vibration:
Ac =
F0
k −!2mA + i!c
(13.62)
Now we would like to express the complex amplitude as a product of a real
amplitude A and phase '0, such that Ac = Aei'0. We ﬁnd for the amplitude:

(13.65)
where we used Eq. (2.34) and Q = k/(!nc).
From this equation, that is
plotted in Fig. 13.10 we see that for small values of damping c, the amplitude
approximately has a maximum if the driving frequency ! is equal to the natural
frequency !n =
p
k/mA, in this situation the system is driven at resonance.

13.4 FORCED VIBRATIONS
249
The amplitude when driving at its natural frequency ! = !n is A = F0Q/k,
while it is A = F0/k at low frequencies. The ratio between these two numbers
is called the quality factor Q = k/(!nc) and is a measure of how many periods
it takes for the resonant vibrations to dampen out if the driving force is
removed. At critical damping Qc = pkmA/cc = 1
2 and for the undamped
system with c = 0 the amplitude and Q-factor becomes inﬁnite when it is
driven at resonance. At very high driving frequencies ! the amplitude tends to
zero because the inertia of the mass prevents its motion to follow the driving
force.
Near and above the resonance frequency !n, a phase di↵erence '0 develops,
such that the motion is delayed with respect to the driving force, as indicated
in Fig. 13.8 and Fig. 13.11. The value of this phase shift can be found by
taking the ratio of the imaginary and real parts of Ac = Aei'0 and Eq. (13.62):
tan('0) = =Ac
<Ac
=
−!c
k −!2mA
(13.66)
We see that at low driving frequencies ! the motion is in phase with the force
because the phase di↵erence '0 = 0. At larger driving frequencies the phase
di↵erence '0 becomes negative, indicating that the motion lags behind the force.
This continues up to the natural resonance frequency, where !2 = !2
n = k/mA
and '0 = −⇡/2, for which the motion is −90 degrees out of phase, and the
velocity is in phase with the force. At even higher frequencies, the phase lag
between motion and force increases more, until it reaches a phase di↵erence
close to −180 degrees with '0 = −⇡at very high driving frequencies ! ≫!n.
Steady-state solution for damped forced vibrations
We have now fully determined the complex amplitude Ac = Aei'0, with A
being given by Eq. (13.65) and '0 by Eq. (13.66), and thus we have found the
function yA,f(t) in Eq. (13.59) and proven that it is a solution of the EoM in
Eq. (13.57).

13.4 FORCED VIBRATIONS
251
In contrast to free damped vibrations, the steady-state solution Eq. (13.67)
is the same for underdamped, overdamped and critically damped systems.
Steady state solution for forced undamped vibrations
An important special case is the situation in which there is no damper connected
to the mass, such that c = 0. In this situation, the system will exhibit undamped
forced vibrations. The solution of this EoM can be easily obtained from our
previous analysis by just setting c = 0.
It is seen from Eq. (13.65) and
Eq. (13.66), that then A = F0
mA |!2
n −!2|−1 and '0 = 0 for ! < !n and '0 = −⇡
for ! > !n. We therefore have for the solution of the EoM for forced undamped
vibrations:
yA,fu(t) =
F0
mA(!2n −!2) cos(!t)
(13.70)
A special feature of undamped vibration is that its amplitude goes to inﬁnity
if the driving frequency equals the natural resonance frequency (! = !n), see
Fig. 13.10 for Q = 1. In practice such inﬁnite amplitudes never occur and a
small damping constant c is always present.
13.4.5 More complex systems involving forced vibrations
The same methodology we have just derived for mass-spring-damper systems,
can be extended to rigid bodies and other more complex systems for which the
kinetic analysis yields an EoM that has the form of Eq. (13.57):
<
⇥
me¨ye + ce ˙ye + keye = F0,eei!t⇤
(13.71)
For analyzing such systems one ﬁrst determines the equations for ye, F0,e,
me, ce and ke by comparing Eq. (13.71) to the EoM and then analyses the
vibrations in an exactly identical way as for the mass-spring-damper system
(see also Sec. 13.3.4).
13.4.6 Forced vibration: solution procedure
Based on the previous analysis, let us summarise the step-by-step procedure
for analysing forced vibrations and obtaining their motion.
1. Sketch the system and coordinate system.
2. Draw the free-body diagram and project the force and/or moment vectors
on the coordinate axes. Determine the relevant constraint equations.

252
13 VIBRATIONS
3. Use Newton’s second law and Euler’s ﬁrst law for translations and Euler’s
second law for rotations to determine and simplify the scalar equations
of motion, reducing it to a single scalar EoM.
4. Determine the static equilibrium position yA,st by setting all time deriva-
tives in the EoM to zero ¨yA,tot = ˙yA,tot = 0, setting the forcing term F(t)
to its time-averaged value Favg and solving for yA.
5. Deﬁne the time dependent part of the motion as yA(t) = yA,tot −yA,st.
6. The system will show forced vibration if the EoM can be written in the
form me¨ye + ce ˙ye + keye = F0,e cos(!t).
7. Determine the equations for ye, F0,e, me, ce and ke in terms of the given
variables, constants or numerical values.
8. Substitute a trial function of the form ye = <Acei!t into the EoM by
taking the ﬁrst and second derivative.
9. Obtain the equation Ac(−me!2 + ice! + ke) = F0,e and determine the
complex steady-state amplitude Ac.
10. Use Ac = Aei'0 to convert the complex prefactor to a real amplitude A
and phase '0.
11. If ce = 0, then we are dealing with forced undamped vibration.
In
that case '0 = 0 such that the steady-state solution of the EoM is
ye(t) = A cos(!t), with A = F0,e/(ke −me!2).
12. If ce 6= 0 we are dealing with forced damped vibration. The complex
amplitude can be converted into a real amplitude A and phase '0 using
the relation Ac = Aei'0.
The steady-state solution of the EoM is: ye,f(t) = A cos(!t + '0).
The amplitude of the steady-state solution is:
A = F0,e/
p
m2e(!2n −!2)2 + !2c2e.
The phase di↵erence between force and motion is:
'0 = arctan[−!ce/(ke −!2me)].
13. Solutions ye,h(t) of the homogeneous EoM
me¨ye,h + ce ˙yA,h + keyA,h = 0 for free vibrations can be summed to the
steady state solution yA,f(t) to obtain new solutions of the EoM. For
damped vibrations (c > 0), the function yA,h(t) reduces to zero after
suﬃcient time, it is therefore called the transient part of the solution.
In general, any solution of the forced EoM can always be expressed as
yA(t) = yA,f(t) + yA,h(t).
14. Two initial conditions of the form yA(t1) = y1 or ˙yA(t2) = v2 need to
be solved to determine the two unknown constants in the transient part
of the solution yA,h(t) (see Sec. 13.2.5). Note that for forced vibrations
the full motion yA(t) including both the steady-state and transient parts
needs to be used to determine these constants.

13.4 FORCED VIBRATIONS
253
13.4.7 More complex driving forces⇤
Up to now we have only dealt with a single cosine shaped forcing function.
However, in practice more complex periodic forcing functions can act, which
are a sum of multiple cosine functions, each with a di↵erent driving frequency
!j and a di↵erent complex amplitude Fj, and with the total forcing function
F(t) = < Pj=N
j=1 Fjei!jt, where there are N terms such that j runs from
j = 1 . . . N. The methodology derived in this section can be used to ﬁnd a
solution yA,j for each of these driving frequencies and then add all solutions to
ﬁnd a solution for the full EoM. To satisfy the EoM each of these functions
yA,j needs to satisfy an ODE of the form:
mA¨yA,j + c ˙yA,j + kyA,j = Fjei!jt
(13.72)
From each of these N ODEs, with yA,j = Ac,jei!jt we determine the complex
motion amplitude Ac,j using the corresponding complex force amplitude Fj
and frequency !j with Eq. (13.62), Ac,j = Fj/(k −!2
j mA + i!jc). By summing
we ﬁnd a steady-state solution of the form:
yA,f(t) = <
2
4X
j
Ac,jei!jt
3
5
(13.73)
Since, according to Fourier analysis, any periodic time-dependent function
can be written as F(t) = < P
j Fjei!jt, this procedure allows to analyse the
vibrations and motion of a system in response to any periodic force. Note
that driving with two or more frequencies can result in beating, like shown in
Fig. 2.1.
13.4.8 Vibrations of rotating rigid bodies
As mentioned in Sec. 13.4.5, everything discussed in this chapter can also be
used to analyse vibrations of rotating rigid bodies. We illustrate this by an
example which includes a massive pulley as rigid body and also shows how to
reduce the equation of motion of multiple objects to a single one by constraint
equations.
A Example 13.4 Description:
The sketch of the problem is given in Fig. 13.12. A point mass B with mass mB
is suspended by a rope via a pulley A that has moment of inertia IG, radius R and
mass mA (so it is di↵erent from the massless pulleys we have considered earlier).
The other side of the rope is connected to a spring with sti↵ness k. The rope does
not slip and is always tight under tension. When the system is in static equilibrium,

254
13 VIBRATIONS

Figure 13.13: FBD belonging to Example 13.4.

13.4 FORCED VIBRATIONS
255
the mass B is at height yB = he. We deﬁne ye = yB −he as the displacement of
B with respect to this equilibrium position. ✓e is the angular displacement of the
pulley with respect to the equilibrium position. yC is the displacement of point C
with respect to the equilibrium position.
Question: Determine the rotational motion ✓e(t) of the pulley A with respect to
the equilibrium position when the system is released from rest at ✓e = ✓e0.
Solution:
• Draw the FBD of A and B shown in Fig. 13.13. Don’t forget the normal
force ~F N and gravitational force ~F g on the pulley. The rope generates forces
~F rB and ~F rC on points B and C respectively and by Newton’s third law
the opposite forces act on the pulley. Ask yourself: why are the forces ~F rB
and ~F rC di↵erent? The answer is: they are di↵erent because a moment is
needed to provide the angular acceleration of the disk of the pulley according
to Euler’s second law, since the pulley is not massless. If the forces would be
equal this moment would be zero. This angular acceleration is provided via
the static friction force between the disk and the rope, which does not slip. In
the FBD we directly provide the equations to expand the vectors into their
scalar components along the y-axis.
• Determine the constraint equations from the rope. Since the motion with
respect to the equilibrium position is asked, we do not have to determine the
static equilibrium position anymore. Since the rope has constant length and
does not slip, and because in equilibrium all coordinates are zero ye = yC =
✓e = 0, we have 2 constraint equations. We also write down the equation for
the spring force FrC of the rope on point C:
ye
=
−✓eR
(13.74)
yC
=
+✓eR
(13.75)
FrC

kyC
(13.76)
• Now we write down the equation of motion for mass B along the y-axis, with
respect to equilibrium:
X
FBy = FrB = mB ¨ye
(13.77)
Note that the gravitational force is excluded, since it does not contribute to
the time-dependent part of the force.
• It is seen that the motion of the pulley is a pure rotation around its centre.
Due to the pin around which it rotates, there is no translation of its CoM, such
that we only need to consider the rotational EoM of the pulley, i.e. Euler’s

13.5 Summary
In this chapter we have analysed vibrations, a periodic type of motion that is
important in many ﬁelds of science and engineering. Vibrations originate when
a position dependent restoring force, like that generated by a spring, acts on a
mass. When there are no external forces one obtains free vibrations, while if
there are periodic external forces acting, we have forced vibrations. If a velocity
dependent force from a damper acts on the mass, the vibrations are damped.
There are two main challenges in analysing vibrations: 1. Deriving the correct
EoM using the FBD and Newton’s or Euler’s second law. 2. Solving the EoM,
which is mainly the mathematical challenge of solving a second order linear
ODE.
• For systems with a restoring force, like mass-spring systems, the EoM
as determined using Newton’s second law has a special form that causes
the motion to exhibit vibrations.
• First determine the static equilibrium position and then determine vibra-
tional motion y(t) with respect to this position.
• Free vibrations
If there are no time dependent external driving forces, we deal with free
vibrations and the following EoM:
me¨ye + ce ˙ye + keye = 0
(13.87)
• If ce = 0, then we are dealing with free undamped vibration. In that case
the solution of the EoM is ye(t) = <Aei!nt+'0 = A cos(!nt + '0), with
natural resonance frequency !n =
p
ke/me.
• If ce 6= 0 we are dealing with free damped vibration.
Determine the discriminant ∆= c2
e −4meke.
– If ∆> 0 we are dealing with overdamped free vibration with
yA = A+eλ+t + A−eλ−t and λ± = −ce±
p
∆
2me
.
– If ∆< 0 we are dealing with underdamped free vibration with
yA = Ae−ce
2me t cos(!dt + '0) and !d =
p
!2n −c2e/(4m2e).
– If ∆= 0 we are dealing with critically damped free vibration with
yA = A0e−ce
2me t + Atte−ce
2me t.
• The system will show forced vibration if the EoM can be written in the
form:
me¨ye + ce ˙ye + keye = F0,e cos(!t)
(13.88)
• If ce = 0, then we are dealing with forced undamped vibration.
In
that case '0 = 0 such that the steady-state solution of the EoM is
ye(t) = A cos(!t), with A = F0,e/(ke −me!2).

258
13 VIBRATIONS
• If ce 6= 0 we are dealing with forced damped vibration.
The steady-state solution of the EoM is:
ye,f(t) = A cos(!t + '0).
The amplitude of the steady-state solution is:
A = F0,e/
p
m2e(!2n −!2)2 + !2c2e.
The phase di↵erence between force and motion is:
'0 = arctan[−!c/(k −!2mA)].
• Solutions ye,h(t) of the homogeneous EoM
me¨ye,h + ce ˙ye,h + keye,h = 0 for free vibrations can be added to the
steady-state solution ye,f(t) to obtain new solutions of the EoM. For
damped vibrations (c > 0), the function ye,h(t) reduces to zero after
suﬃcient time, it is therefore called the transient part of the solution.
In general, any solution of the forced EoM can always be expressed as
ye(t) = ye,f(t) + ye,h(t).

14 Solution Strategy Dynamics
In this textbook we have discussed a wide range of dynamical methods that
can be used to solve problems. In order to provide the reader a strategy for
solving problem and choosing the right methods we present in this chapter a
solution strategy and ﬂow-charts. For each number in the ﬂow-charts a short
description is presented. The strategy consists of three ﬂow-charts: preparation,
kinematics and kinetics.
14.1 Flowchart preparation
Before starting with the kinematic and kinetic analysis, it is very important to
collect all relevant information, simplify it and choose the coordinate systems
to analyse the problem along the following steps that are also shown below in
the ﬂow-chart preparation:
1. Can the problem be segmented in time?
2. If yes, then split the problem in segments and analyse each segment
separately. The initial conditions of a segment (initial positions and
velocities) are determined from the end conditions of the preceding
segment.
3. Choose one or more coordinate systems (CS) to analyse the kinematics.
Use the provided information to choose the system(s) which makes the
analysis simplest.
4. Make a sketch of the problem that contains all relevant objects, constraints
and coordinate systems.
5. Write down all variables, given values and other relevant equations and
information.
6. Determine all degrees of freedom (DOFs) needed to uniquely determine
the positions and orientations of all objects. E.g. xP , yP for every point
mass P and xG, yG and φ for every rigid body.
7. Determine the constraint equations and count the number of DOFs.
8. Reduce the number of DOF: using constraint equations, e.g. from ﬁxed
points, joints, path curves.

260
14 SOLUTION STRATEGY DYNAMICS
9. Determine the position vectors ~r and components of all relevant points
using the CS.
10. Determine if a kinematic or kinetic analysis is needed. If there is enough
information to solve the problem without considering the e↵ect of forces
the problem can be solved with kinematics (go to step 11). Otherwise,
ﬁrst the e↵ect of forces should be determined using kinetics (go to step
18) and then the EoM is solved.

15. Rotations & translations
16. Determine kine-

17. Determine ~r(t), ~v, ~a, ~!
and ~↵by solving constraint
and kinematic equations
Go to 18: determine forces and moments from ~a and ~↵
11. This ﬂowchart shows the strategy for dealing with kinematics problems.
12. First determine if we deal with a rigid body or point mass, since the
kinematics of point masses is signiﬁcantly simpler.
13. Kinematics translation: the goal is to determine position ~r, velocity ~v
and acceleration ~a if only one of the three is known. This is done by
solving the ODE, e.g. by di↵erentiation and integration over time t, or
along the path s or angle φ coordinate (see Table 5.1). In 3D we have
derived equations to di↵erentiate along Cartesian, natural or cylindrical
coordinates (see Sec. 5.9).
14. Rotating coordinate systems: the goal is to determine ~vB, ~aB of point
B in an IRF if ~v0
B and ~a0
B are known in a CS that rotates with angular
velocity ~⌦, or vice versa (see Sec. 9.7).

262
14 SOLUTION STRATEGY DYNAMICS
15. Rotating rigid bodies: the goal is to determine ~vB, ~aB of a point B that
is ﬁxed on a rigid body if ~! and ~↵are known or vice versa. Translation
of a point is dealt with similar as in step 13. The kinematic equations for
rotation of rigid body are discussed in Ch. 9. In particular the instanta-
neous centre of rotation (IC, see Sec. 9.5.1) can facilitate determination
of velocities.
16. The kinematic equations are determined using steps 13-15.
17. Finally the motion ~r(t), ~v, ~a, ~!, ~↵is determined by solving the kinematic
and constraint (di↵erential) equations. In case one needs to determine
forces: go to step 18 to achieve this with kinetics.

14.3 FLOWCHART KINETICS
263
18. Kinetics is used to determine the equation of motion from the forces and
Newton’s and Euler’s laws.
19. The ﬁrst step is to cut objects with mass loose and draw an FBD for
each of them (see Sec. 6.8).
20. Use the FBD to determine the sum of forces and sum of moments, and
project them on the coordinate system.
21. Determine the centre of mass CoM (see Sec. 7.3.2) and moment of inertia
IG of each object (see Sec. 10.5).
22. The kinetic analysis can be signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed by using the method
of work and energy or the method of (angular) impulse and momentum,
so carefully choose the right method.
23. Work and energy can be used if (see Ch. 7 and Ch. 11)
• Forces as a function of position ~F (~r) or moments as function of
angle are known.
• The trajectory/path is known or does not need to be determined.
• There is only 1 unknown scalar (e.g. the ﬁnal speed).
Conservation of energy can further simplify the analysis if all forces are
conservative forces.
24. (Angular) impulse and momentum can be used if (see Ch. 8 and Ch. 12):
• Impulse and/or angular impulse by external forces can be deter-
mined.
• Only changes in (angular) velocity need to be determined, while the
positions are approximately constant.
• In case the sum of external forces and/or moments is zero the
analysis can be further simpliﬁed using conservation of momentum
and/or angular momentum.
• Besides (angular) momentum conservation, energy conservation or
coeﬃcients of restitution can be used to solve e.g. collision problems.
25. Equations of motion. Determine the equations of motion for transla-
tion and rotation using Euler’s laws and project them on the CS to
obtain scalar equations (see Ch. 6 and Ch. 10). Combine them with
the constraint equations. Note that solving these equations is mostly a
mathematical and kinematics challenge.
26. Solve the (di↵erential) equations of motion to obtain the motion ~r(t).
Go to step 11 to determine motion of all points using kinematics.
27. Vibrations are special EoMs that are solved by special means for driven
and free vibrations that can be damped or undamped (see Ch. 13).

Motion is all around us, the universe is full of moving matter and 
engineering that studies time-dependent motion in the presence of 
forces is called dynamics. In this book we will introduce the core 
concepts in dynamics and provide a comprehensive toolset to predict 
and analyse planar 2D motion of point masses and rigid bodies. The 
material includes kinematic analysis, Newton’s laws, Euler’s laws, the 
equations of motion, work, energy, impulse and momentum. Vector-
based methods are discussed for systematically solving essentially 
any problem in 2D dynamics. The book provides an introduction at 
bachelor level for science and engineering students, that serves as a 
basis for more advanced courses in dynamics.
