Mutating Objects
Mutating an object means changing the object's state without creating a new object
names = ['Eric', 'John']
Eric
John
0xFF255
names
names.append('Michael')
Eric
John
Michael
names = ['Eric', 'John']
Eric
John
names
names = names + ['Michael']
0xFF255
Eric
John
Michael
0xAA2345
This is NOT mutation!

Mutating Using []
s[i] = x
s[i:j] = s2
element at index i is replaced with x
slice is replaced by the contents of the iterable s2
del s[i]
removes element at index i
We will come back to mutating using slicing in a lot more detail in an 
upcoming video
We can even assign to extended slices:
s[i:j:k] = s2
del s[i:j]
removes entire slice

Some methods supported by mutable sequence types such as lists
s.append(x)
appends x to the end of s
s.clear()
removes all items from s
s.insert(i, x)
inserts x at index i
s.pop(i)
removes and returns element at index i
s.remove(x)
removes the first occurrence of x in s
s.reverse()
does an in-place reversal of elements of s
s.copy()
returns a shallow copy
s.extend(iterable)
appends contents of iterable to the end of s
and moreâ€¦
