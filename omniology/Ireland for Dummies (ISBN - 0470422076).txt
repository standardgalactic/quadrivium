About the Author
Liz Albertson worked as an editor for Frommer’s Travel Guides for
four years before making the leap to the other side of the com-
puter as the author of Ireland For Dummies. When she isn’t
researching and writing, Liz spends much of her time in Ireland sit-
ting in on traditional music sessions, fiddle in hand. She currently
teaches sixth grade in Northampton, Massachusetts, where she
lives with her fiancé, Hugh, and her adopted African cichlid fish,
Rocky. Liz welcomes feedback and suggestions for the next edition
of the book at ejalbertson@yahoo.com.

Introduction
R
elatively tiny Ireland (84,434 sq. km/32,600 sq. miles) offers travel-
ers a diverse range of experiences. You find landscapes that range
from those famed rolling green hills to stark, rugged cliffs; restaurants
that serve the best in modern fusion cuisine and pubs that serve Irish
stew made from a recipe that’s hundreds of years old; theaters showcas-
ing the best in contemporary dance and festivals devoted to traditional
Irish music. This guide highlights the best of Ireland’s diverse offerings
so that you can plan the trip of your dreams.
About This Book
This guide is designed to help you travel smarter, with a concise, savvy
approach that helps you get to the heart of what you’re looking for. It’s a
quick reference guide that includes need-to-know information, from the
best online bargains and package deals to helpful tips on how to organ-
ize and maximize your time in a destination. Each destination features a
selective, streamlined choice of hotels and restaurants in all price
ranges. I weeded out the clunkers to focus on the best choices, whether
you’re looking to splurge on a luxury resort or find an affordable place
for a family of four.
I tried to anticipate every question you may have about traveling to
Ireland and provide the answers. If you’ve never been to the country
before, I show you what to expect and how to plan for it. If you’re an old
Ireland hand, you probably bought this book because you don’t want to
waste a lot of time sorting through a billion different hotels, restaurants,
and attractions trying to find the absolute best ones. You want a quick
and easy, yet comprehensive, source of information, and that’s exactly
what I give you here.
Of course, you don’t have to read the whole book. And you don’t have 
to start at the beginning, either. This is a reference book. Check out the
table of contents, and then read the parts that answer your specific
questions.
Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — this is especially true of prices. You may want to write or call
ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans.

Conventions Used in This Book
In this book, I include descriptions of the best sights in Ireland; reviews
of the best hotels, restaurants, shops, pubs, and more; and all sorts of
tips for planning your visit to the Emerald Isle. I employ a few conven-
tions designed to convey critical information in a simple, straightfor-
ward manner.
Money matters
For this edition of Ireland For Dummies, I used the currency exchange
rates of $1.60 to every 1 and $2 to every £1. Exchange rates fluctuate
all the time; check www.xe.com for up-to-date exchange rates.
All prices given here over ten euro, dollars, or pounds are rounded to
the nearest euro, dollar, or pound. All prices are, of course, subject to
change.
In the accommodations sections, the listed price is a rack rate (the offi-
cial rate published by the hotel) for one night in a double room (one
room accommodating two people); the actual prices you’ll pay are often
less than the rack rate.
Each accommodation and dining review is accompanied by a dollar-sign
designation designed to help you get a sense of the price category of the
lodging or restaurant at a glance. The following table gives you the key
to the dollar-sign designations for accommodations and restaurants.

Other matters
I provide an entry called Suggested visit at the end of each attraction list-
ing. This is my estimate of how much time you should budget to do and
Ireland For Dummies, 5th Edition 
2

see most of what’s available at each attraction. This length of time is just
a suggestion — you may find you need more or less time, depending on
your interests.
The following is a list of the credit card abbreviations used in the listings
in this book:
AE
American Express
DC
Diners Club
MC
MasterCard
V
Visa
In the dining sections, the listed prices are the range of prices for dinner
main courses, unless otherwise noted.
And just in case you’re not familiar with the term en suite, it means a
room with a bathroom connected. In some B&Bs especially, you may be
expected to share a bathroom with other guests, so ask for a room en
suite if a private bathroom is important to you.
My Assumptions
In this book, I make some assumptions about you and your needs as a
traveler. I assume you are one of the following:
 An inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when determining
whether to travel to Ireland and how to plan for it
 An experienced traveler who hasn’t yet visited Ireland and wants
expert advice on where to go and what to see
 A traveler looking for a book that focuses on only the best and
most essential Irish sights, tastes, and experiences
If you fit any of these criteria, Ireland For Dummies, 5th Edition, gives
you the information you’re looking for.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into seven parts. Parts I and II whet your palate and
get you ready to go, and Parts III through VII deal with what you can see
and do while you’re there. Each section in the regional chapters has a
Fast Facts portion at the end, listing addresses and contact information
for visitors’ bureaus and tourism offices, Internet cafes, hospitals, local
genealogical resources, and post offices.
Introduction 3

Part I: Introducing Ireland
This part introduces you to the splendor of Ireland and helps you get 
an idea of what you’d like to see and where you’d like to go. The book
starts with a chapter devoted to the very best that Ireland has to offer.
Chapter 2 includes all sorts of information about Ireland, from a look at
the island’s history to translations of local lingo to culinary information.
Chapter 3 provides brief descriptions of the regions covered in this
guide so that you get a sense of where you’d like to go. In Chapter 3, I
also discuss various approaches to touring the country, and hash out
the pros and cons of visiting during different seasons. I also give you a
rundown of the many festivals, events, and celebrations held in Ireland
throughout the year. In case you’d like some guidance on how to plan
your itinerary, I offer outlines for four different suggested itineraries in
Chapter 4.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Ireland
Part II answers all your practical questions about planning and getting
ready for a trip to Ireland. Chapter 5 deals with money, providing rough
guidelines on what things cost, helping you decide how to carry your
money, and listing 20 (count ’em: 20) money-saving tips. Chapter 6 out-
lines the different ways to get to Ireland, and Chapter 7 deals with the
various options for getting around the island. After you plan how to get
there, you can turn to Chapter 8, which gives you the lowdown on the
different types of accommodations in Ireland, plus tips on how to save
on lodging costs. Chapter 9 includes tips for travelers with special needs
and interests, including seniors, travelers with disabilities, gay and les-
bian travelers, outdoorsy travelers, and more. Before you go out and
start buying your travel-size toothpaste, check out Chapter 10 for infor-
mation on getting a passport, figuring out your insurance, packing your
bags, and staying in touch once you get to Ireland.
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast
Part III is dedicated to Dublin and the surrounding counties: Meath and
Louth to the north and Wicklow, Wexford, Waterford, Kilkenny, and
Tipperary to the south.
Chapter 11 covers Dublin, the Republic of Ireland’s bustling, vibrant 
capital city. This fat chapter is packed with information on the best
restaurants, hotels, attractions, shopping, and nightlife in the city. If the
choices overwhelm you, check out the one-, two-, and three-day itiner-
ary suggestions I provide.
Counties Meath and Louth, just north of Dublin, are home to a treasure
trove of prehistoric sights, including the remarkable burial mounds at
Knowth and Newgrange, and the storied Hill of Tara, ancient seat of 
the Irish high kings. You’ll find more information about these areas in
Chapter 12. Chapters 13 and 14 cover the beautiful southeastern coun-
ties of Wicklow, Kildare, Wexford, Waterford, Kilkenny, and Tipperary.
Ireland For Dummies, 5th Edition

These counties offer a diverse array of attractions, including some of
Ireland’s most beautiful gardens, medieval towns, stunning mountain
and coastal scenery, and the popular Waterford Crystal Factory.
Part V: Counties Cork and Kerry
Part IV covers only two counties, Cork and Kerry, which together attract
the lion’s share of visitors to Ireland, who come for the stunning moun-
tain and coastal scenery in these parts. Bustling Cork City; and the gor-
geous sea- and landscapes, and cute towns of West Cork are covered in
Chapter 15, while Chapter 16 features the best of beautiful Killarney
National Park and the breathtaking Ring of Kerry and Dingle Peninsula.
Part V: The West and the Northwest
This part bundles the entire western and northwestern areas of Ireland
into one neat package that incorporates a tremendous variety of land-
scapes and towns. Chapters 17 through 20 are filled with information on
gorgeous natural wonders, including the sheer Cliffs of Moher and Slieve
League cliffs; the rocky, wildflower-studded Burren; the beautiful Aran
Islands; the wild landscape of Connemara; and much more. You get the
lowdown on some of the best cities and towns in this area, including the
sweet Mayo town of Westport, artsy Sligo Town, and the “it’s-so-great-
why-doesn’t-everyone-live-here” city of Galway.
Part VI: Northern Ireland
Part VI covers the separate country of Northern Ireland, which may be
last in this book but is not least in terms of natural beauty and interest-
ing cities. Chapters 21, 22, and 23 guide you to the most beautiful natural
wonders, including the Mourne Mountains and the hexagonal basalt
columns of the Giant’s Causeway. They also give you all the information
you need to explore the hot-and-happening city of Belfast and the up-
and-coming historic city of Derry.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens chapters feature some fun extras, such as Irish food
and drink that you shouldn’t miss during your trip, and my top ten sug-
gestions of what to buy in Ireland.
You also find another element near the back of this book. I include an
appendix — your “Quick Concierge” — containing lots of handy informa-
tion you may need when planning your trip.

T
his chapter gives you the lowdown on the very best that Ireland has

The Best Travel Experiences
With all that Ireland has to offer, it’s tough to come up with a list of
favorite experiences. But here are some of the adventures I keep day-
dreaming about long after I’m home.
 Listening to traditional Irish music: What could be better (or more
Irish) than relaxing to live traditional music in an atmospheric pub?
The Traditional Irish Musical Pub Crawl (see Chapter 11) is a ter-
rific introduction to the musical style. If you’re in the groove after
the pub crawl, head to the Cobblestone (also in Chapter 11), which
hosts exceptional musicians.
 Taking in the Book of Kells: This ninth-century book of the four
gospels glows with ornate Latin script and stunning Celtic knots
and designs. The exhibit about the making of the book is fascinat-
ing. See Chapter 11.
 Filing into Newgrange Tomb: You’ll feel like a lucky explorer as
you descend into the cool, dim chamber of this 5,000-year-old pas-
sage tomb (an underground chamber thought to have religious or
ceremonial importance), where you’ll find ancient geometric rock
carvings. See Chapter 12.

 Strolling through Powerscourt Gardens: These gardens have
many facets, including a mossy grotto, a formal garden with an
impressive fountain and statuary, a rose garden that bursts into a
riot of color in season, and peaceful woodlands. See Chapter 13.
 Touring the Waterford Crystal Factory: A fascinating tour takes
you behind the scenes to watch the evolution of Waterford Crystal
pieces, from their beginnings as molten crystal to the finished prod-
uct. Naturally, there is a giant retail space on site. See Chapter 14.
 Eating your way through Kinsale: Not only is Kinsale the picture of
charm, with a beautiful harbor and an adorable town center, but it’s
also Ireland’s gourmet capital; you’ll find loads of excellent restau-
rants here. See Chapter 15.
 Exploring Killarney National Park: Use a bike, horse, jaunting car,
or your own two feet to explore the silver streams, sapphire lakes,
dense woodlands, and heather-covered mountains here. See
Chapter 16.
 Driving the Ring of Kerry and the Dingle Peninsula: Driving along
both of these peninsulas, you’ll encounter vista after vista, each
more spectacular than the one before it. Seascapes, cliffs, and moun-
tain views are the order of the day on the Ring of Kerry, while the
Dingle Peninsula is all hills, covered in a patchwork of farms, plus
sandy beaches, craggy cliffs, and more seascapes. See Chapter 16.
 Walking through the Burren: Walking is the ultimate way to see
this strange and gorgeous rocky plateau, filled with wildflowers
that poke up through cracks in the rock, shallow lakes and rivers
that spring up from below, and ruins from the Stone Age through
medieval times. See Chapter 17.
 Exploring Ireland’s Islands: Taking the ferry out to Ireland’s
islands is part of the adventure. The other part is exploring these
peaceful islands, with their different ruins and cultures, by bike or
by foot. See Chapter 18 for information on the Aran Islands.
 Taking a hike: There’s nothing like wandering through the country-
side to really experience Ireland. One of my new favorite hikes is
out of Port, on the peninsula north of Donegal Bay. See Chapter 20.
 Gazing awestruck at the Cliffs of Moher: Tuck extra rolls of film
into your backpack before you head up to these breathtaking cliffs,
which plummet down to the Atlantic 288m (760 ft.) below. The
vistas are stunning — you can see all the way to the Aran Islands in
Galway Bay when the weather is clear. See Chapter 17.
 Seeing the Derry or Belfast political murals: These murals are
moving testaments of the Troubles. See Chapters 21 and 22.
 Clambering around the Giant’s Causeway: You can climb around
this natural wonder — a stretch of tightly packed six-sided basalt
columns of varying heights — like you’re on a StairMaster gone
crazy. See Chapter 22.

The Best Hotels
The following hotels made my list of favorites because they offer a unique 
atmosphere, outstanding service, uncommon luxury, a particularly Irish
flavor, or perhaps all of the above.
 Number 31 (Dublin): A country-chic oasis with gorgeous modern
accents, this small hotel is a calm retreat in the middle of Georgian
Dublin. Good luck pulling yourself away from the delicious break-
fast. See Chapter 11.
 Waterford Castle (Waterford): Don your crown and head to this
castle on its own island, with an interior featuring tapestries,
antiques, and stone fireplaces. See Chapter 14.
 Butler House (Kilkenny): The décor here is a gorgeous marriage of
old and new; service is spot-on; and many of the spacious rooms
have views of Kilkenny Castle that are so beautiful, they look like
storybook illustrations. See Chapter 14.
 Killarney Park Hotel (Kerry): Luxury, luxury, and more luxury are
on tap at this hotel, with a gorgeous Victorian-style lobby and spa-
cious guest rooms furnished with antiques and lush fabrics. See
Chapter 16.
 Adare Manor Hotel & Golf Resort (Limerick): You’ll want for nothing
at this castlelike manor house. The public rooms are grand and luxu-
rious, and the bedrooms are filled with opulent fabrics and carved
wood and stone. The grounds feature a trout-filled river, sweeping
parklands, and a Trent Jones–designed golf course. See Chapter 17.
 The G (Galway): Okay, so it’s expensive (really, really expensive),
but this place boasts theatrical surroundings, a wonderful spa,
friendly staff, and possibly the most comfortable beds on the
Emerald Isle. See Chapter 18.
 Ashford Castle (Mayo): Live out a fairy tale with a stay in this luxuri-
ous castle. Public rooms hold large gilt-framed oil paintings, medieval
coats of armor, and oak paneling, while antiques and carved wood
furniture are the order of the day in guest rooms. The hotel offers all
sorts of activities, from horseback riding to fishing. See Chapter 19.
 Malmaison (Antrim): I challenge even the grouchiest traveler to
find fault with this trendy boutique hotel, where service is extraor-
dinarily friendly, and the warm, spacious rooms are designed to
cater to every need. See Chapter 22.
The Best B&Bs
I love bed-and-breakfasts because you get the company and advice of a
friendly local along with a homey, comfortable room — and often a good
bargain to boot. Here are some of my favorites.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Ireland 13

 McMenamins Townhouse (Wexford): Kind hosts, soothing rooms,
a central location, and a spectacular breakfast make this place one
of Ireland’s best B&Bs. See Chapter 14.

or lady of this manor as you stroll the stunningly landscaped grounds
and settle down in your cozy, elegant room. See Chapter 14.
 Ballymakeigh House (Cork): Dine on a five-course meal made from
the freshest of produce before stumbling upstairs to your comfort-
able room that overlooks the surrounding dairy farm. See Chapter 15.
 The Old Presbytery (Cork): The only way that this place could be
more relaxing would be if a masseuse came with each room. The
huge beds are filled with snow-white blankets and pillows, many
rooms have tubs or Jacuzzis, and the staff is among the friendliest
and most helpful around. See Chapter 15.
 Milestone B&B (Kerry): Owners Barbara and Michael Carroll make
this B&B a standout, helping every guest to plan his or her perfect
Dingle Peninsula itinerary. See Chapter 16.
 Berry Lodge (Clare): The views of farmland and sea are gorgeous,
and the bedrooms are comfy and bright, but the real reason to stay
here is the unbelievably delicious cuisine served at dinner. See
Chapter 17.
 Devondell House (Galway): This sweet B&B is a slice of home (with
a terrific breakfast) right outside of Galway City. See chapter 18.
 SeaMist (Galway): Peace and tranquility are the words that come
to mind at this B&B in the middle of the bustling little town of
Clifden. See Chapter 18.
 Templehouse (Sligo): A stay at Templehouse is what life would be
like if you had a close relative who just happened to own a sprawl-
ing manor house on 400 hectares (1,000 acres). See Chapter 19.

The best of the Irish awards
As you make your way around Ireland, you discover that the Irish absolutely love
awards. Almost every restaurant and lodging has some sort of sign or sticker indicat-
ing that the place is lauded by one organization or other. In fact, there are even awards
for the best public bathrooms in each county. You heard it here first: One of Ireland’s
top toilets is in Lismore, in County Cork. The esteemed public bathroom is located at
the foot of the road leading toward the castle. As you enter towns and villages in each
county in the Republic, you often see awards for the Tidiest Town, presented by the
environmental council. If you feel like planning an itinerary through Ireland’s tidiest
towns, check out www.tidytowns.ie.

 The Merchant’s House (Derry): Slip back in time with a stay at this
beautifully restored Georgian B&B, featuring high ceilings, intricate
plasterwork, and a museum-quality Georgian-style dining room. See
Chapter 21.
 Ash-Rowan Town House (Antrim): This serene B&B is a welcome
oasis after a long night in Belfast’s pubs or a long day exploring the
city. Rooms are decorated with country-style furniture, Victorian
antiques, and fresh flowers from the garden in back. See Chapter 22.

fortable inn, nestled in rolling green hills a few minutes away from
the Mourne Mountains. Walking trails start practically at the front
door. See Chapter 23.

Feel like sitting down to an elegantly prepared seafood entree? Or is
meat-and-potatoes comfort food more your style? Perhaps you’d like a
fusion meal, featuring ingredients and cooking techniques from all over
the world? No matter what you’re craving, you won’t go hungry in
Ireland. Following are my favorite places to dig in.
 Mermaid Café (Dublin): Fresh Irish ingredients and innovative
dishes characterize the menu at this buzzy, warm, modern restau-
rant. See Chapter 11.
 L’Gueulton (Dublin): Come at some obscure time (Tues night at
6:17 p.m., say) to ensure yourself a seat at this casually elegant
restaurant, where the friendly staff serves up perfectly prepared
dishes made with excellent fresh ingredients. See Chapter 11.
 The Winding Stair (Dublin): Set aside an evening to enjoy the 
New Irish delights at this recently-opened Dublin restaurant. See
Chapter 11.

Florence at this romantic Italian restaurant with its excellent home-
made pasta. See Chapter 14.
 Fishy Fishy Café (Cork): Come here for sparkling fresh fish pre-
pared beautifully and served in a bright, sea- and sky-blue room.
See Chapter 15.
 Man Friday (Cork): There’s no fancy footwork at this seafood-and-
meat restaurant, just excellent ingredients cooked in a way that
allows their flavor to shine, such as the black sole cooked on the
bone. The interior is warm, romantic, and cozy, lit by lantern-style
lamps. See Chapter 15.
 Packies (Kerry): You can’t go wrong with any of the dishes at this
hip and lively restaurant, from the simple crab claws in garlic
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Ireland 15

butter to the adventurous plaice with orange, lime, and cilantro.
See Chapter 16.
 Out of the Blue (Kerry): In a sea of seafood restaurants, Out of the
Blue stands out, offering some of the freshest fish in town in a
cheerful, Mediterranean-style restaurant. See Chapter 16.
 The Lighthouse Café (Kerry): The view from the picnic benches will
knock your socks off before you’ve even begun to dig in to the unbe-
lievable seafood chowder and other casual dishes. See Chapter 16.
 The Wild Geese (Limerick): Dishes at this candlelit restaurant, all
made with local ingredients, are daring, modern, and absolutely
delicious. Case in point: the onion-and-Parmesan tartlet studded
with raisins. In addition, service is some of the most gracious and
attentive in Ireland. See Chapter 17.
 Zucchini (Clare): Fantastic service, beautifully-prepared inventive
dishes, and stylish surroundings should make this Ennis newcomer
a star. See Chapter 17.
 Nimmo’s Wine Bar (Galway): The inventive dishes here make use
of herbs and spices from all over the world, which complement the
flavors of the fresh main ingredients. The restaurant overlooks the
River Corrib and has a cozy, eclectically decorated interior with a
nautical bent. See Chapter 18.
 Brown’s Bar and Brasserie (Derry): How does honey-glazed lamb
with mint jus and a tomato, mint, and mozzarella tart sound? This
sleek, modern restaurant has a menu full of dishes like these —
imaginative creations that take advantage of local ingredients. See
Chapter 21.
 Cayenne (Antrim): There’s a reason that all those decked-out folks
are crowded into the entranceway of this restaurant: The fusion
cuisine here is daring and luscious, featuring bold dishes such as
an appetizer of cinnamon quail with carrot, honey, and ginger
salad. See Chapter 22.
 Zen (Antrim): Though I’ve tried to rein myself in, you’ll probably
notice my passion for sushi as you read this guide. Boy, was I
happy to find this excellent restaurant, where delicious Japanese
dishes (sushi and others) are served in ultradramatic surround-
ings. See Chapter 22.
The Best Castles
You can step back in time and unleash your inner lord or lady at any of
the following castles.
 Dublin Castle (Dublin): Art and history lovers alike will appreciate
a tour of Dublin’s castle, which has been used in various capacities
for the past 800 years. See Chapter 11.
Part I: Introducing Ireland 
16

 Cahir Castle (Tipperary): This 13th- to 15th-century defensive
castle, the setting for the movie Excalibur, is one of the best-pre-
served medieval castles in Ireland. See Chapter 14.
 Kilkenny Castle (Kilkenny): A storybook-castle exterior, a beautiful
interior boasting 1830s furnishings, and expansive grounds are the
charms of this medieval castle. See Chapter 14.
 Blarney Castle and Stone (Cork): Does this place really need an
introduction? You can explore the impressive grounds and well-pre-
served ruins of this 15th-century castle. And, of course, you can
kiss the famed hunk of rock. See Chapter 15.
 King John’s Castle (Limerick): One of the finest examples of a forti-
fied Norman structure in Ireland, King John’s Castle boasts
weapons of defense in the courtyard and a fully restored interior
that’s open to the public. See Chapter 17.
 Bunratty Castle and Folk Park (Clare): Built in 1425, and featuring
an interior that’s furnished as it was in the 15th century, Bunratty
Castle is one of Ireland’s most popular attractions. For the full
castle experience, book a seat at one of the medieval banquets held
here. See Chapter 17.
 Dunguaire Castle (Galway): Each floor of 16th-century Dunguaire
Castle is furnished to reflect a different era in its history. The view
of Connemara and Galway Bay from the top of the battlements is
incredible. See Chapter 18.
 Dunluce Castle (Antrim): Perched over the crashing waves of the
ocean, the stone ruins of 17th-century Dunluce Castle are some of
the most picturesque in Ireland. Window openings and doors frame
the sea and sky, and you can still see the remains of the giant stone
fireplaces. See Chapter 22.
The Best Ruins and Archeological Sites
History buffs will have a field day at any of the following attractions.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Ireland 17
Travel: A study in serendipity
This is probably the most difficult chapter to write, because some of my Ireland “bests”
are one-of-a-kind moments, which lack admission fees and open hours — a late-night
Irish music session, a great conversation with a Dublin taxi driver, the sun breaking
out of the clouds to illuminate a faraway hill. You will have these “bests” too, experi-
ences unique to your trip. Dog-ear this book, mark off everything you want to experi-
ence, and make reservations for the best restaurants, but don’t forget to be open to
those serendipitous experiences that make travel so magical.

 Newgrange (Meath): Check out the stones carved with geometric
designs before entering the passageway of this 5,000-year-old burial
chamber. See Chapter 12.
 Glendalough (Wicklow): A monastic community founded in the
sixth century, Glendalough functioned as a community of learning
for almost 900 years. As you gaze at the remains of a cathedral,
graveyard, and remarkably well-preserved round tower, you can
almost hear the passionate exchange of ideas. See Chapter 13.
 Jerpoint Abbey (Kilkenny): One of the best-preserved monastic
ruins in the country, this 15th-century Cistercian Abbey is home to
Celtic crosses and stone carvings of knights and dragons. See
Chapter 14.
 Rock of Cashel (Tipperary): Once the province of the high kings of
Munster, many of the ruins on this limestone outcropping are tied
to St. Patrick, who is said to have explained the Holy Trinity to
pagans on this site. See Chapter 14.
 Gallarus Oratory (Kerry): This tiny seventh-century church, built
without any sort of mortar, is one of the Dingle Peninsula’s many
interesting archaeological sites. See Chapter 14.
 Lough Gur (Limerick): Evidence shows that this Stone Age settle-
ment was occupied from Neolithic times to medieval times. You can
explore diverse ruins here: burial mounds, a wedge tomb, and an
impressive 4,000-year-old great stone circle. See Chapter 17.
 Dún Aengus (Galway): Set on a sheer cliff overlooking the Atlantic
Ocean, this giant, well-preserved prehistoric stone fort stretches
over 4.4 hectares (11 acres). See Chapter 18.
 Carrowmore Megalithic Cemetery (Sligo): A tour of this site, the
largest collection of megalithic tombs in Ireland, paints a vivid pic-
ture of life on the island thousands of years ago. See Chapter 19.
The Best Scenic Drives
Ireland’s landscape is so stunning that almost every drive is a scenic
drive. Here’s a list of my favorite excursions.
 Cooley Peninsula Drive: This drive, along the rough Irish Sea and
pretty Carlingford Lough, travels past dolmen (Neolithic tombs),
forests, mountains, rivers, and quaint fishing villages. See Chapter 12.
 South East Coastal Drive: Fishing villages, seaside towns, and
coastal vistas are the highlights of this drive. See Chapter 14.
 The Vee: This drive provides panoramas of lush mountains and
farmland laid out like a quilt below. See Chapter 14.
Part I: Introducing Ireland 
18

 The Coastal Drive from Skibbereen to Mizen Head: Cliffs and
seascapes are the stars of this drive, which ends at wild-and-wooly
Mizen Head, where the Atlantic waves crash on Ireland’s south-
westernmost point. See Chapter 15.
 The Ring of Kerry: Give yourself at least a whole day for this wind-
ing drive, because you’ll be pulling over every couple of minutes to
take pictures of the ever-changing seascapes, mountain views, and
charming villages along the way. I recommend getting off the Ring
drive at some point to explore the beautiful mountains in the inte-
rior. See Chapter 16.
 Slea Head tour on the Dingle Peninsula: This round-trip circuit
will make your jaw drop. Highlights include the towering cliffs of
Slea Head, incredible views of the Atlantic Ocean and the nearby
Blasket islands, and hills covered in a patchwork of small fields. See
Chapter 16.
 The Connemara Drive: The spectacular drive west from Galway,
tracing the Galway Bay Coast, features amazing views of the Aran
Islands and passes through some adorable seaside towns. Join up
with N59 in Maam Cross, and head out to the west, making a big
half-circle on your way up to Leenane. This part of your journey
affords picture-perfect views of the silent bogs, lush woodlands,
and glistening lakes of Connemara. See Chapter 18.
 Drive around Lough Gill: Take along a book of Yeats’s poems as
you make the drive around this peaceful blue lake. The lake itself
and its many islands (including the famed Lake Isle of Innisfree) fea-
ture prominently in the poet’s works. See Chapter 19.
 Clew Bay Drive: This dazzling drive (one of my absolute favorites
in Ireland) takes you past the pyramid-shaped peak of Croagh
Patrick, through moody bogland, and along glassy Killary Fjord. See
Chapter 19.
 The Peninsula north of Donegal Bay: Make sure that you find the
twisty little road to Port as you cruise around the peninsula north
of Donegal Bay. See Chapter 20.
 The A2 along the Antrim coast: The A2 winds along the Antrim
coast, past cliffs, beautiful seascapes, and small seaside towns. See
Chapter 22.
The Best Golf Courses
Ireland likes to take credit for starting the sport of golf and boasts over
250 courses within its borders (not bad for such a small country).
Following are some of the best.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Ireland 19

 Portmarnock (Dublin): A rugged natural course, Portmarnock has
been home to a number of championships. See Chapter 11.
 The K Club (Kildare): This tough (and expensive) course was
designed by Arnold Palmer himself. See Chapter 13.
 Old Head Golf Links (Cork): This challenging course has breath-
taking views of the surrounding Atlantic Ocean. See Chapter 15.
 Ballybunion Golf Club (Kerry): This seaside club features two
excellent 18-hole, par-71 courses. See Chapter 16.
 Royal County Down Golf Club (Down): The two tough courses
here are full of sand dunes, but if you get frustrated with how your
game is going, you can distract yourself with the surrounding views
of the Mourne Mountains. See Chapter 23.
The Best Natural Wonders
The whole of Ireland seems to me to be a natural wonder, but for this list
I’ve tried to pick out the most extraordinary sights on the island.
 The Wicklow Mountains (Wicklow): If you want green, point your-
self towards the lush and rolling Wicklow Mountains. You find leafy
woodlands, shimmering lakes, verdant fields, and plenty of walking
trails on which to enjoy the surroundings. See Chapter 13.
 The Skelligs (Kerry): A boat ride is the best way to appreciate
these rocks, which jut dramatically from the frothing sea below. See
Chapter 16.
 The Burren (Clare): This vast expanse of cracked limestone is a
strange and stunning place. Though it looks like a forbidding habi-
tat, the Burren supports a wide variety of flora and fauna. A daz-
zling rainbow of wildflowers pushes up through the cracks, and the
diverse array of plants includes species that are usually seen only
in the Arctic or Mediterranean. Twenty-six species of butterfly —
plus lizards, badgers, frogs, and birds — call this place home. See
Chapter 17.
 The Cliffs of Moher (Clare): These sheer cliffs rise more than 213m
(700 ft.) above the crashing Atlantic, providing spectacular views of
the Clare coast, the Aran Islands, and, on a clear day, mountains as
far away as Kerry and Connemara. See Chapter 17.
 Connemara (Galway): Still glacial lakes, stands of evergreens, tow-
ering mountains, quiet boglands, and granite moorlands compose
the hauntingly beautiful area of Connemara, populated by rugged
Connemara ponies. See Chapter 18.
 Slieve League (Donegal): The cliffs of Slieve League are the highest
in all of Europe, towering over the turbulent Atlantic. You can take
Part I: Introducing Ireland 
20

in their grandeur from a viewing area or experience it yourself with
a walk along the ridge. See Chapter 20.
 The Giant’s Causeway (Antrim): This place practically defines the
term natural wonder. The landscape is made up of natural six-sided
basalt column of varying heights, cascading down into the sea. See
Chapter 22.
The Best Pubs
It’s no secret that the Irish have a bit of a reputation for being enthusias-
tic drinkers. Check out a few of these inviting pubs, and maybe you’ll
understand why.
 Cobblestone (Dublin): This is the real deal — a cozy pub filled with
locals and ringing to the rafters with traditional Irish music played
by excellent musicians. See Chapter 11.
 Jack Meade’s (Waterford): Crackling fires, loud laughter, a warren
of small rooms, and terrific pub food conspire to make Jack
Meade’s a gem in the Waterford countryside. See Chapter 14.
 The Long Valley (Cork): Belly up to the long bar here to drink
pints, munch on giant sandwiches, and shoot the breeze with the
friendly regulars. See Chapter 15.
 The Bulman (Cork): This pub has it all — crackling fires, good com-
pany, live traditional Irish music, great seafood dishes, and a view
of beautiful Kenmare Bay. See Chapter 15.
 Dick Mack’s (Kerry): One of Ireland’s quaintest pubs, Dick Mack’s
used to double as a cobbler’s shop, and one side of the place still
holds the leatherworking tools of the trade. The interior hasn’t
changed in years, which pleases the many locals who frequent this
place. See Chapter 16.
 The Poet’s Corner (Clare): A warm, always-humming bar located in
the Old Ground Hotel, this place offers some of the best traditional
Irish music in Ennis, a town known for its formidable traditional
music scene. See Chapter 17.
 Crane Bar (Galway): In a city full of excellent traditional Irish
music, this is the place to go for the very best. See Chapter 18.
 Nancy’s (Donegal): Cozy and welcoming, Nancy’s fulfills all my fan-
tasies of stepping into Middle Earth for an evening at a Shire pub.
See Chapter 20.
 Crown Liquor Saloon (Antrim): This is one of the most beautiful
pubs in all of Ireland, outfitted with carved wood, brass fittings, and
gas lamps. You’ll be drooling into your Guinness. See Chapter 22.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Ireland 21

The Best Literary Sights
Bring a journal and some nice pens, because you’re sure to be inspired
by the sights associated with Yeats, Joyce, and the other literary stars of
Ireland.

ing intriguing facts and presenting snippets of literature and con-
versations read by actors. See Chapter 11.
 Abbey Theater (Dublin): Founded by writers and literature-lovers
W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory, the Abbey Theater presents some of
the finest in Irish drama. There are frequent productions of the
works of Sean O’Casey and John Millington Synge, two pillars of the
Irish theater. See Chapter 11.
 Joyce Tower and Museum (Dublin): This round tower is the set-
ting for the first scene of Ulysses; it features Joyce’s walking stick,
cigar case, and some correspondence, among other objects. See
Chapter 11.
 Blasket Centre (Kerry): The Blasket Islands, located a few miles
out from the Dingle Peninsula, were home to a hearty, close-knit
community of farmers and fisherfolk until the 1950s. This fascinat-
ing heritage center explores all the facets of Blasket Island life, with
particular attention paid to the storytelling traditions of the
Islanders and the published authors who emerged from this com-
munity. See Chapter 16.
 Angela’s Ashes Walking Tour (Limerick): Fans of Frank McCourt’s
beautiful and harrowing tale of growing up poor in Limerick City
will want to tour the Limerick sites mentioned in the book. See

Gregory, a writer and literary patron who co-founded the Abbey
Theater. Be sure to check out the Autograph Tree, where you find

forests. The house contains a museum devoted to Yeats’s life and
work. See Chapter 18.

(including the well-known “Lake Isle of Innisfree”). You can take in
the poet’s words as you cruise the lake. See Chapter 19.

the history and culture of your destination. This chapter gives you the
lowdown on Irish history, language, food and drink, music, sports, and
other facets of Irish culture.
History 101: The Main Events
Ireland has one of the most intriguing and complex histories of any
nation, stretching back to the prehistoric period, and fraught with inva-
sions, battles, and rebellion.
Invaders welcome
From the beginning, Ireland put out a doormat welcoming invaders, or
so it seems. Ireland was first inhabited by Mesolithic hunters and fisher-
men who appeared in the country around 7500 B.C., most likely hailing
from Scotland. They were followed by a wave of Neolithic farmers, also
from Scotland, who arrived 4,000 years later, around 3500 B.C. Around
450 B.C., or perhaps even earlier, the Celts arrived from Europe, conquer-
ing the earlier settlers and spreading the Gaelic culture and language
that still thrives today. Nine hundred years later, in the fifth century A.D.,
Christian missionaries arrived on the shores of Ireland from various
parts of Europe and converted much of the Irish population to
Christianity. It was at this time that famed missionary St. Patrick con-
verted thousands of Irish; legend says that he explained the Holy Trinity
using a shamrock as a visual aid.

The eighth century saw the graceful longboats of the Norse Vikings land-
ing on several Irish coasts. The Vikings raided and plundered their way
through Ireland, setting up coastal bases that evolved into the country’s
first cities — Dublin, Wexford, Waterford, Cork, and Limerick. After
almost three centuries of plundering, the Vikings were routed in 1014 by
the armies of high king Brian Boru, who was the first leader to preside
over all of Ireland. Upon the defeat of the Vikings, Ireland experienced a
period of relative peace.
But that peace only lasted a little more than 150 years. In 1169, Diarmuid
MacMurrough, the dethroned king of Leinster (the southeastern portion
of Ireland) called on the Anglo-Normans, under the leadership of
Strongbow, to help him seize back his kingdom. The Anglo-Normans
were Vikings who had settled in Normandy and had control over most of
Britain. With their superior military, they had no trouble capturing much
of Ireland for themselves. Strongbow’s prize for his troubles was the
hand of MacMurrough’s fair-haired daughter, Aoife, in marriage.
Rebels with a cause
In the 14th and 15th centuries, the Celts (also called the Gaels) rose up
against both the British and the Anglo-Norman invaders. They suc-
ceeded in containing the British in an area around Dublin known as The
Pale, but they had no luck in ridding the island of the powerful Norman
overlords. In fact, through intermarriage and the adoption of Irish lan-
guage and culture, the Normans were becoming as Irish as the Irish
themselves. Some of the most popular surnames in Ireland today —
Fitzgerald, Burke, Joyce — are actually Norman.
In the 16th century, the British launched a reconquest of Ireland under
Henry VIII, who declared himself king of Ireland and forced the Irish
chieftains to acknowledge his sovereignty. Though Henry VIII did not
introduce British colonists to Ireland, his daughter Mary encouraged
colonialism after his death, and her sister, Queen Elizabeth I, sent a
steady flow of British settlers into Ireland. Due to Henry VIII’s split with
the church in Rome, Catholic persecution began in Ireland.
In 1601, Gaelic troops joined with a Spanish army to try to squelch the
English army, but the English forces triumphed under Lord Mountjoy,
and English law was introduced to much of the island, including Ulster,
previously the most Gaelic part of Ireland. Defeated, many of the O’Neills
and O’Donnells, the most powerful Gaelic clans in Ulster, fled from
Ireland. The English government pronounced the O’Neill and O’Donnell
lands forfeit to the crown and sent Protestant English and Scottish set-
tlers to develop farms and towns in the area. Naturally, the Irish Catholic
inhabitants of Ulster strongly resented the imposition of these
Protestant settlers, and thousands were massacred when the Catholic
rebelled in 1641. The 17th-century bitterness between the Protestant set-
tlers and the Catholic natives is one of the roots of the modern Troubles
in Northern Ireland.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Ireland 25

In 1649, eight years after the Catholic rebellion, the ruthless Puritan
English leader Oliver Cromwell arrived in Ireland with the goal of taking
the whole of Ireland under English control. Cromwell’s army raged
through Ireland, butchering thousands, and by 1652, three years later,
controlled the country. Cromwell dispossessed every Catholic
landowner east of the River Shannon, whether Irish or Old English.
Connacht and County Clare, west of the Shannon, were used as a “reser-
vation” for Catholics who had not fled the country. Though Catholics
caught a glimpse of hope when Catholic King James II came to the
throne, it was a brief peek that ended as the Glorious Revolution
brought Protestant William of Orange to the throne. James struck back
in Ireland, launching the unsuccessful siege of the Protestant walled city
of Derry, during which the inhabitants of Derry slammed the city gates
shut and remained inside for 105 days, subsisting on rats and other
vermin. In what is arguably the most important battle in Irish history,
James was trounced by William at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, giving
Protestant England complete control over Ireland.
Penal Laws were enacted that forbade Gaelic and Old English Catholics
alike from owning land, practicing law, holding public office, bearing
arms, and even practicing Catholicism (though this last tenet was not
strictly enforced). These laws were in effect for almost 100 years. They
were finally repealed in 1783 as a result of the combination of unrest in
rural areas of the country, the need for Irish Catholic recruits to fight in
the American War of Independence, and the liberal philosophies of the
European Enlightenment.
The French Revolution in 1789 threw kindling on the fire of rebellious
feelings that were already smoldering among the Catholics; and, in 1798,
war between Britain and France gave Ireland a window of opportunity
for another rebellion. Irishman Wolfe Tone conspired with the French to
drive the British out of Ireland, but his rebellion failed, claiming more
that 30,000 Irish lives. Captured by British forces, Tone slit his own
throat rather than face execution by his enemies.
In 1828, 30 years after Tone’s rebellion, Daniel O’Connell ran for a
Member of Parliament position, even though, as a Catholic, he would not
be able to sit as part of the Parliament. O’Connell was elected by a land-
slide, and the British Prime Minister, striving to avoid a civil war in
Ireland, passed the Catholic Emancipation Act, allowing Catholics to sit
as members of Parliament. O’Connell spent his time in Parliament fight-
ing tooth and nail for the rights of Catholics, earning him the nickname
“The Great Liberator.” O’Connell also strove to dissolve the union
between Ireland and Britain. O’Connell’s progress was stopped in its
tracks when the Great Famine struck in 1845, and O’Connell died in 1847.
The population of Ireland, over eight million in 1841, depended on the
potato as their main diet staple. When a fungus killed off potato crops
for five successive years, beginning in 1845, the island was thrown into
turmoil, as previous healthy children dwindled into wraiths and the
Part I: Introducing Ireland

Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Ireland 27
dead were left unburied because their families were not able to afford
coffins. More than one million people died as a result of starvation and
another million abandoned Ireland for the shores of the United States,
beginning a stretch of Irish emigration that would keep up until the
1930s. While famine tore through the rest of Ireland, Protestant Ulster
began to experience an Industrial Revolution, and Belfast blossomed
from a small town into an industrial city. Catholics and Protestants both
joined the working class in Belfast, and riots between the two groups,
spurred by their rancorous history, were common.
Exhausted by the famine, Ireland didn’t see a new leader for almost 30
years, until the 1870s and 1880s, when Charles Stewart Parnell emerged
on the scene. Parnell, Ireland’s representative to the British Parliament,
succeeded in uniting different factions of Irish Nationalists, and began
the legislative struggle for home rule (Ireland would have its own parlia-
ment while still being part of Britain). Parnell was well on his way to real-
izing this goal when the news broke in 1890 that he was living with the
estranged wife of one of his followers. The Irish Catholic hierarchy
turned against him as an adulterer, as did his fellow Nationalist members
of Parliament. Parnell never regained his popularity and died in 1891.
In the 1900s, Nationalists reunited under leader John Redmond, who
managed to pass a Home Rule bill in 1914. However, Redmond promised
that Nationalist Ireland would support the English in World War I. While
some of his followers agreed with this plan, others did not and broke
away to create the separatist Irish Volunteers. The Volunteers staged
Ireland’s most famous rebellion: On Easter Monday in 1916, 1,500 free-
dom fighters, led by Patrick Pearse and James Connolly, seized Dublin’s
General Post Office. They hoisted the tricolor flag from the roof of the
post office and Pearse read the Proclamation of the Irish Republic from
the front steps. This rebellion led to swift retaliation by the British, who
sailed gunboats up the River Liffey and heavily shelled the city. After six
days of battle, the rebels were overwhelmed. Connolly, Pearse, and 13
other leaders of the Rising (as the rebellion was called) were taken to
Kilmainham Gaol (jail), tried, and shot. The Irish were outraged at the
savage executions, especially that of Connolly, who had been so badly
injured in the fighting that he couldn’t stand and had to be tied to a
chair to face the firing squad. The murdered patriots became martyrs in
Ireland, and the Irish commitment to fight for freedom was bolstered.
The Irish flag
Ireland’s flag — three thick vertical strips of green, white, and orange — was first
used by Irish Nationalists in 1848. The green represents Ireland’s Nationalist majority
(mostly Catholic), the orange represents the Unionist minority (mostly Protestant), and
the white stands for the hoped-for peace between them.

In 1918, two years after the Easter Rising, the Nationalist party of Sinn
Fein (pronounced shin fane) won the General Election in Ireland. Rather
than taking their seats in the British Parliament, they declared an inde-
pendent Irish parliament. The British were not pleased with this turn of
events, and Ireland plummeted into a civil war for independence, led by
Michael Collins. A truce was reached in 1921, followed by the Anglo-Irish
Treaty, which gave autonomy to 26 of Ireland’s 32 counties. The remain-
ing six counties continued on as part of the United Kingdom and became
known as Northern Ireland. Many Irish, eager to finally reach peace,
accepted the accord for the Irish Free State, even though it kept parts of
Ireland in the British Commonwealth. Others, led by Eamon de Valera,
refused to accept the treaty. A civil war broke out in 1922 between the
pro-treaty and anti-treaty factions. The pro-treaty side emerged victori-
ous in May 1923. The 26 counties officially cut all ties with Britain when
the Republic of Ireland Act was passed in 1948.
There was a nervous peace in Northern Ireland for the first half of the
20th century. However, in the late 1960s, Catholics in Northern Ireland
began to campaign against religious discrimination in jobs, politics, and
housing. Civil rights meetings spiraled into violence, paving the way for
the Irish Republican Army (IRA), a Nationalist paramilitary group that
organized several terror attacks. Violence continued on both sides up
until the Belfast Agreement (also known as the Good Friday Agreement)
of 1998, when the Irish voted to make a fresh start with a new govern-
ment in Belfast. Unfortunately, the new government was suspended in
2000 because paramilitary groups did not disarm by the deadline. In July
2005, the prospects for a lasting peace were strengthened when the
paramilitary PIRA (Provisional Irish Republican Army) announced that it
had decommissioned all weapons. Though other paramilitary groups
have not yet decommissioned their weapons, the past few years have
been peaceful, and hopes are running high that the violent conflict has
truly come to an end.
The Celtic Tiger and immigration
As you travel throughout Ireland, you will likely notice that many people
in the service industry are emigrants from Eastern Europe (especially
Poland). Ireland’s economy has been quite strong since the mid-1990s,
raising living standards dramatically. Many Eastern European workers
are taking advantage of the healthy Irish economy and their EU member-
ship and are coming to Ireland to work for more money than they would
make at home. Irish citizens have been reacting to this wave of immigra-
tion with attitudes ranging from outright xenophobia to warm acceptance.
Who’s Who in Irish Mythology
Some of the folks I describe in this section lived more verifiably real lives
than others, but all have entered the mythology to such an extent that
you’re almost sure to hear them mentioned at some point in your trip.
Part I: Introducing Ireland 
28

Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Ireland 29
 Children of Lir: In this legend, the wicked new wife of King Lir
(leer) puts a spell on his children to turn them into swans for 900
years. She later regrets her evil deed but can’t reverse the spell, so
she gives the birds the gift of song. A beautiful sculpture depicting
the Children of Lir is the centerpiece of Dublin’s Garden of
Remembrance, and today it is illegal to kill a swan in Ireland.
 Cuchulainn (coo-cul-in): The famous Celtic warrior of ancient
myth, Cuchulainn can grow to such enormous size and strength
that he can kill scores of men with one swing of a sword. Many leg-
endary stories are told of his feats. A statue stands in Dublin’s
General Post Office depicting Cuchulainn in bloody action.
 Queen Medb or Maeve (mave): Cuchulainn’s enemy, whom legend
credits with stealing the prize bull of Ulster and killing Cuchulainn,
among other exploits. Is she real or a myth? See the box “The
Mystery of Queen Maeve,” in chapter 19.
 Finn MacCool: An Irish hero immortalized in poems by his son
Osian and in many Fenian ballads, named after the Fenians (or
Fianna), professional fighters whom Finn was said to have led in
the third century. Finn and his men defended the country from for-
eign aggressors and hunted for food; these two activities are the
main subjects of the stories about him. He is often portrayed as a
giant with supernatural powers and is frequently accompanied by
his pet hound, Bran.
 Osian (o-sheen): Finn MacCool’s son, a great leader and warrior, as
well as a talented poet. The name means “fawn,” and legend says
that his mother spent part of her life as a deer.
Who’s Who among Irish Saints
Getting your Patricks and your Brigids mixed up? Here’s a primer on
three of Ireland’s most important saints:
 St. Brigid: Known for her compassion and generosity, Brigid is
probably the best-known saint in Ireland after Patrick. She founded
a convent in Kildare and became an abbess there, holding the same
rank as a bishop. Her convent became a monastic city of learning,
home to a famous school of metalwork and manuscript illumina-
tion. Brigid is renowned for her miracles, especially in the realm of
healing. Her feast day is February 1.
 St. Columcille (St. Columba): This saint’s pious nature as a young
boy earned him the nickname Columcille, which means “dove of the
church.” Columcille was a busy guy, founding dozens of monaster-
ies, including the monastery in Derry and the monastery on the
island of Iona, in Scotland, and converting many of the inhabitants
of Northern Scotland to Christianity. A great lover of books and a
bard himself, Columcille copied hundreds of manuscripts. His feast
day is June 9.

 St. Patrick: The patron saint of Ireland. Brought to the country as a
teenage slave, Patrick later escaped, only to return to Ireland with
the goal of converting the Irish to Christianity. Though he was not
the first Christian missionary, Patrick was perhaps the most influ-
ential. In addition to converting a large percentage of the Irish popu-
lace, Patrick succeeded in converting several of the Celtic high
kings. His feast day is March 17 (sound familiar?).
Who’s Who in Irish Literature
The Irish are fiercely proud of their rich literary tradition, and many
writers have places of honor around the country. You can’t go to County
Sligo without tripping over sights related to poet W. B. Yeats; and repeated
references to the novels of James Joyce fill Dublin. The walls of theaters
around Ireland resonate with the words of playwrights O’Casey, Shaw,
Synge, Beckett, and other Irish wordsmiths.
Contemporary Irish literary luminaries include poet Seamus Heaney;
playwrights Brian Friel, Conor McPherson, and Martin McDonough; and
writer Roddy Doyle, among many, many others.
Following are some bite-size bios of the literary wonders you’re most
likely to hear about.
 Samuel Beckett (1906–1989): Most of playwright and novelist
Beckett’s work deals with lonely and bewildered people in search
of an unknown something. The best-known and most performed of
his plays is Waiting for Godot, which centers on two men waiting
endlessly for the arrival of a mysterious character named Godot.
 Brendan Behan (1923–1964): Behan’s youth was full of run-ins
with the law, including a stint with the Irish Republican Army in his
teens. The playwright, columnist, and novelist is perhaps most
famous for The Borstal Boy, a novel based on his experiences in jail
and reform school; The Quare Fellow, a play that draws on his expe-
riences in prison; and The Hostage, a play about the events sur-
rounding an IRA member’s execution.
 James Joyce (1882–1941): Though he moved to Continental
Europe at age 22, Joyce’s four major works — Portrait of the Artist as
a Young Man, Dubliners, Finnegan’s Wake, and Ulysses — are all set
in Dublin. Joyce is known for his experimentation with language,
and his books are rich in puns, metaphor, and wordplay.
 Sean O’Casey (1880–1964): This famous playwright shocked the-
atergoers with controversial plays based on his early, poverty-
stricken days and the fight for Irish home rule. Best known are Juno
and the Paycock, the story of a poor family during the 1916 Rising,
and The Plough and the Stars, which deals with different perspec-
tives on the 1916 Rising.
Part I: Introducing Ireland 
30

 George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950): In his works, Socialist Shaw
explored moral and social problems with wit and intellect. His most
famous plays include Pygmalion, the story of plucky Eliza Doolittle;
Major Barbara, which centers on a Salvation Army major question-
ing charity and capitalism; and St. Joan, about Joan of Arc.
 John Millington Synge (1871–1909): A noted Abbey Theatre play-
wright, Synge is best remembered for plays that explore the rural
life of western Ireland. Riders to the Sea focuses on life in a fishing
community on the Aran Islands, where the threat of drowning
looms over all residents; in Shadow of the Glen, a man fakes his
death in order to find out if his wife is cheating on him; and in
Playboy of the Western World, a man is celebrated as a hero for
killing his father.
 Oscar Wilde (1854–1900): Wilde is best known for his plays, includ-
ing An Ideal Husband, a political melodrama, and The Importance of
Being Earnest, a hilarious comedy of manners.
 W. B. Yeats (1865–1939): Poet and playwright Yeats co-founded
Dublin’s Abbey Theatre. Many of his poems take the landscapes
and mythology of Ireland as their themes, while others riff on the
struggle for Irish home rule and on love and romance.
Word to the Wise: The Local Lingo
Sure, English is the main language in use in Ireland, but between slang
words and the accent, it can sound like a foreign language at times. Read
these handy glossaries so that you don’t have to have one of those
polite but puzzled smiles on your face while talking with locals.
Getting the lingo
Some of the following terms are slang or just Irish usage, and some are
authentic Irish Gaelic:
 An Lar: City center (Gaelic)
 Bonnet: Car hood

The Irish language in 
contemporary Ireland
Irish Gaelic (usually called “Irish” in Ireland) and English are the official languages of
Ireland. Almost the entire population speaks English, and about 95 percent of the popu-
lation uses English as their primary language. About a million and a half of Ireland’s five
million residents can speak at least a few words of Irish Gaelic (the language is now
taught in all public schools), and about 600,000 people use Gaelic as their first lan-
guage. Gaelic-speaking areas are called Gaeltacht (pronounced gale-tokt) and are
concentrated in the west of Ireland, though they are found all over the island.

Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Ireland 33
 Slainte! (slon-cha): Cheers! (Gaelic)
 Take-away: Fast food, to go
 Till: Cash register
 Tins: Canned goods
 Windscreen: Windshield
Avoiding misunderstandings
In Ireland (especially Northern Ireland), holding your pointer and middle
fingers up in a V with your palm facing inward is the same as raising
your middle finger to someone. Careful when ordering two pints!
Curses are used rather liberally in Ireland, and you’ll probably
encounter people saying “shite” as they drop something or “for feck’s
sake” (the equivalent of “for God’s sake”) when their favorite football
team misses a goal.
The following words and phrases have definitions that are quite different
in Ireland than they are in other parts of the world.
 Cute hoor (pronounced like whore): Boy, does this one have a dif-
ferent meaning than it does in many other countries. In Ireland, cute
is often used to mean someone who is sly or devious, and a cute
hoor is a devious person. The phrase is almost always used to
describe a man, rather than a woman, and is often used to describe
politicians.
 Fag: Cigarette.
 Fanny: Female genitalia.
 Flaming: Drunk.
 Ride: Sex or an attractive person. So ask for a lift if you’re looking
for someone to drive you somewhere.
 Take the piss out of (as in, “We were just taking the piss out of
him.”): Messing with or teasing; another phrase for this is 
“slagging you.”
Irish slang translation: Yer man
If you tour around Ireland for a while, you’ll probably hear people referring to yer man
(as in, “I was talking to yer man the other day . . .”). You may well wonder who this
incredibly popular person is. Well, he’s the fella Americans call this guy (for example,
“I was talking to this guy the other day . . .”) and British call “this bloke.” You may also
hear yer man’s feminine counterpart, yer won.

Taste of Ireland: Irish Cuisine and Dining
If you think of shepherd’s pie, Irish stew, and mashed potatoes when you
think of Irish cuisine, you’re right. But that’s only half the story: In the
past few decades, Ireland has seen huge changes in the food scene. A
stroll down a row of restaurants is like paging through a book about the
world’s cuisines. Especially in larger towns and cities, you can find
everything from Italian restaurants that would make the Sopranos
proud, to Indian restaurants serving fiery curries, to sushi.
Along with these ethnic eateries is a bevy of restaurants creating New
Irish cuisine — innovative dishes that showcase the best of Ireland’s
fresh produce and incorporate international influences. Typical dishes?
How about fresh Irish salmon served with wasabi-infused mashed pota-
toes or local free-range beef with a Thai curry sauce?
If you’re in the market for traditional Irish dishes, your best bet is a pub,
where you find hearty offerings such as Irish stew, thick vegetable
soups, and ploughman’s lunches (cheese, pickles, and bread). But even
pub grub reflects the influences of the last few decades. The dishes are
better than ever, many chefs use as much local produce as possible, and
international twists are found in many dishes (who knew that chile jam
would go so well with Gubbeen, a West Cork cheese?). And you’d better
sit down for what I’m going to say next: Many traditional pubs now
squeeze salads and other healthy options onto the menu.
If you want something quick and inexpensive, try a pub or head for one
of the loads of small cafes and lunch counters that offer soups and sand-
wiches. Even more plentiful are chippers and take-aways, fast-food places
where you can get, among other things, traditional fish and chips.
If you have your heart set on eating at a posh restaurant in one of the
larger cities during the summer or on a weekend (or on a summer week-
end!), make reservations. For the poshest of the posh restaurants, it’s a
good idea to make reservations no matter what time of year it is.
See Chapter 24 for my top ten traditional Irish meal and beverage 
suggestions.
Checking out meal prices
You probably won’t have to pay for breakfast, which comes standard
with almost every hotel and B&B room and is often quite comprehen-
sive. Lunch typically sets you back around 12 ($19) if you eat in a
restaurant or as little as 6 ($9.60) if you have fast food or carry-out, like
the ubiquitous fish and chips.
Dinner is more expensive, with entrees ranging from 14 ($22) to 17
($27) on the low end to 29 ($46) and way up on the high end. After you
factor in wine and service, the tab can get rather high. See the introduc-
tion for the price scale used in this book.
Part I: Introducing Ireland 
34

Many restaurants offer early-bird (usually about 5:30–7:30 p.m.) fixed-
price multicourse dinners that are terrific bargains; and several top-of-
the-line restaurants offer great fixed-price lunch deals as well. In both
cases, the dishes are often the same as those you’ll see for much higher
prices on the a la carte dinner menu. I include other dining-related
money-saving tips in Chapter 5.
Minding your manners: Irish meal times 
and dining customs
The lowdown on Irish dining habits: You may notice that the Irish, like
many Europeans, keep the knife in their right hand and lift food on the
fork with the left hand. Table settings are the same, except that a large
soup spoon often lies across the top of your place setting.
In Ireland, breakfast begins around 7 a.m. and finishes at 10 or 11 a.m.
Lunch goes from noon to about 3 p.m., with 1 to 2 p.m. being the busiest
time. Dinner is usually served from about 6 to 10 p.m., sometimes going
until 11 p.m. on weekends.
Your server won’t bring the check until you ask for it.
For information on tipping, see Chapter 5.

Living the Pub Life
Visiting Ireland without stepping foot into a pub would be like going to
Egypt and missing the pyramids. Pubs serve as the beating heart of com-
munities around Ireland, offering witty conversation, laughter, fabulous
music (often traditional Irish), great pub food, and, of course, drinks. If
you want to find out who’s dating who, you go to the pub. If you’re upset
and need a shoulder to cry on, drag yourself to the pub. If you are keen
to discuss current politics, existential philosophy, or anything in between, 
get thee to a pub. And if you want groceries? Well, in the past (and still
today in some tiny towns), many pubs had two or even three extra func-
tions on top of providing liquor: serving as grocery stores, post offices,
blacksmith shops, undertakers, and so on.
Pubs originated centuries ago, when groups of friends would gather in
someone’s living room or kitchen to chat and perhaps play some music,
dance, and drink some home-brewed liquor. Word of the friendliest
places spread, attracting more and more people, and the houses gradu-
ally became known as public houses, shortened to pubs.
There is as wide a variety of pubs as there are folks who drink in them:
music pubs; literary pubs (both those that appear in literature and those
Part I: Introducing Ireland 
36

Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Ireland 37
that writers frequented and still frequent); sports pubs; actors’ pubs;
even political pubs, where revolutionaries met in secret to plan uprisings.
Pub designs also run the gamut. Most familiar are those shiny Victorian
dark-wood pubs that show up in cities around the world. But there are
also pubs that look like someone’s well-loved living room, with tattered,
mismatched furniture and dusty books; and, on the other end of the
spectrum, modern, streamlined pubs that look an awful lot like clubs.
In many pubs, you may notice small partitioned areas called snugs.
These small compartments are great places for quiet conversation or to
get away from the crowd. But that’s not what they were for originally.
Until the late 1960s, it was impolite for women to drink in public, so they
were confined to the snugs. The barman would pass drinks (only half-
pint glasses, of course!) through a small opening.
Figuring out pub hours and drink prices
Pubs can now make their own hours, which means that many are staying
open later than they used to. Most pubs are open all day, closing between 
midnight and 2 a.m.
Wondering what a night in a pub will run you? Ballpark figures are about
4 ($4.80) for a pint in a small town to as much as 5 ($6) in the city.
The price for a glass of liquor (called a short) ranges from 3 ($3.60) on
the low end to 4 ($4.80) for the more expensive areas. Nondrinkers
may be shocked to discover that a small bottle of soda costs nearly the
same as a pint of Guinness.
Paying attention to pub etiquette
If you’re drinking with a group, think rounds. Everyone (including
guests) takes turns buying drinks for the group, even if “the group” is a
bunch of people you’ve just met.
The larger size glass is called a pint, and the smaller one (which meas-
ures a half-pint) is called a glass. If you’re ordering hard cider, you may
be asked if you want a glass of ice with it. Contrary to what I first thought,
this is not a joke and actually makes the drink even more refreshing.
Bartenders do not expect a tip unless they have provided table service.
Instead, it is customary to buy the bartender a drink every once in a while.
The Irish version of “cheers” is slainte — pronounced slon-cha and
meaning “health.”
If you’re hanging out in a traditional music session and someone asks
you to perform, they usually really mean it. If you’re up for it, recite a
poem or sing a song — doesn’t matter if it’s not Irish.
Finally, if you order a mixed drink (a vodka tonic, for instance), don’t be
surprised if the barkeep hands you a glass with ice and liquor and a
bottle of tonic.

Savoring the black stuff: Guinness
The pints of Guinness in Ireland taste nothing like Guinness elsewhere.
Call it the home-court advantage, or credit the fact that the stuff is as
fresh as all get-out in Ireland, but it’s a fact that the Guinness you drink
in Ireland is a high cut above the Guinness anywhere else.
When Arthur Guinness took over a small brewery in Dublin, he had fan-
tastic foresight. He may not have known then that his brew would
account for one of every two pints sold in Ireland or would be sold in
more than 150 countries, but he definitely was going for longevity — in
1759, he signed a 9,000-year lease on the brewery’s site!
I want to clear up a few misconceptions about Guinness. One miscon-
ception is that it has a huge number of calories. Actually, a pint of
Guinness has about as many calories as a pint of orange juice — around
260. Another misconception is that Guinness is a particularly heavy
drink, an idea that probably comes from the look of it. Really, Guinness
is very easy to drink and refreshing — don’t let the thick head scare you.
Finally, five words to live by: A good pint takes time. Barkeeps draw the
pint about three-quarters and let it sit for about two minutes. Then, by
pushing the tap forward so the stout comes out even more slowly than
the first draw, they fill the glass the rest of the way (some fill the glass in
a three-step process). This slowness isn’t cruel taunting; it’s how a real
pint is pulled and is how you get the best creamy, white head on top.
Even when you finally get the pint in your hands, don’t drink just yet.
Wait until it has settled completely and has turned a deep ruby, almost
black. A good test is to take a coin and tap it against the glass, working
upward. When the coin makes a heavy thud throughout the glass, rather
than a tinny tap, your brew is ready. You can also tell a good pint of
Guinness by the circle of foam that it leaves on the inside of the glass
with each sip.
There are worse things than 
being locked in a pub
Very occasionally, a publican decides to allow patrons to stay in a pub after closing
hours. This is called a lock-in because the doors are locked and the curtains pulled
(and the lights are sometimes dimmed) so that no one else can come in and allegedly
so that the gardaí (police) will not think that anyone is in the pub. Locks-ins are great
fun and an excellent way to get to know locals, as the wee hours are filled with lively
conversation, laughter, and often rollicking traditional Irish music. One of my best
nights (mornings?) in Ireland was spent in pub in a tiny Clare town, learning new Irish
tunes from several fantastic musicians until about 5 a.m. Lock-ins are much more
common in small towns and rural pubs than in big-city pubs.

Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Ireland 39
Sampling other Irish brews
As hard is it may be to believe, Guinness doesn’t have a complete
monopoly on Irish beer. Some of the other popular Irish brews are Harp,
a light lager that’s good for people who aren’t into dark beers; Caffrey’s,
an ale that settles like a stout; Smithwick’s, a dark ale; Kilkenny, a red ale
with a sweet malty taste and a creamy head like Guinness; Murphy’s
Amber, a light ale; Murphy’s Stout, which is a bit sweeter than Guinness;
and Bulmers Cider, a sweet, entirely too drinkable hard cider.
Sipping some Irish whiskey
Monks did a lot for Ireland. They painstakingly crafted the Book of Kells.
They protected Irish antiquities in their round towers during invasions.
But ask your average man on an Irish street, and he may say that the
best thing monks did for Ireland was invent whiskey.
You read that right — monks invented whiskey. In about the sixth cen-
tury, missionary monks brought the secret of distillation home from the
Middle East, forever changing the face of Ireland. Irish whiskey is known
all over the world for its smoothness and quality, and it has brought
Ireland huge revenues over the centuries. The original Gaelic term for
whiskey, uisce beatha (ish-ka ba-ha) means “water of life.” Even today,
every European country that distills a native spirit refers to theirs as the
water of life: eau de vie in France, akvavit in Scandinavia, Lebenswasser
in Germany, agua de la vida in Spain, and aqua della vita in Italy.
Whiskey became more than just a home brew in 1608, when the world’s
first distillery license was given to Old Bushmills Distillery. Next came
John Jameson & Son in 1780 and John Powers & Son in 1791. These
licenses blew open the whiskey export trade in Ireland, and the world’s
love affair with Irish whiskey began. By the end of the 19th century,
more than 400 brands were available in America alone.
The money stopped rolling in when Prohibition was introduced in the
United States in 1919. Bootleggers began distributing lousy liquor under
the respected name of Irish whiskey, destroying its reputation. Meanwhile, 
Ireland and England were engaged in an economic war and stopped
buying each other’s products completely. With Irish whiskey out of the
Guinness versus Murphy’s
Wondering what the difference is between Guinness and Murphy’s Stout? Well,
employees at St. James’s Gate, where Guinness is brewed, have an idea. According
to rumor, a drawing inside the brewery shows a donkey drinking from a trough labeled
“Guinness.” Behind the donkey is another trough, into which the animal is urinating.
This trough, of course, is labeled “Murphy’s.” I assume Murphy’s has its own ideas
about its rival.

picture, Scotch jumped in to fill the void. Only recently has Irish whiskey
become internationally popular again.
Irish whiskey has a distinctive smoothness, which results from triple-dis-
tillation (American whiskey is distilled only once and Scotch, twice).
If you’re interested in the distillation of Irish whiskey, three historic and
popular distilleries are open for tours: The Old Bushmills Distillery,
County Antrim (% 028-2073-3218); The Old Jameson Distillery,
Dublin (% 01-872-5566); and The Old Midleton Distillery, Cork 
(% 021-461-3594).
Sampling poteen
You may have heard of a potent potable called poteen and wondered
just what it is. Well, poteen (or potcheen or poitín) is unlawfully distilled
clear whiskey, banned since 1661. Basically, it’s the Irish equivalent of
moonshine, originally made from potatoes. Recently, some companies
have started to produce a legal poteen (which still contains a huge
amount of alcohol), so you may see it around Ireland.
Appreciating Irish Music
This should say something about the importance of music in Ireland: It’s
the only nation in the world with a musical instrument as a national
symbol. The Tara Harp appears on all official documents of the Irish gov-
ernment. You can see the oldest harp in Ireland on display in the Old
Library of Trinity College in Dublin (see Chapter 11).
Traditional Irish music (often called trad) has been around for centuries
and is an integral part of Irish culture, woven into the daily lives of many
Irish people. In fact, you’d be hard-pressed to find an Irish person who
doesn’t know at least a few tunes or songs. Irish traditional music is a
living tradition, and new tunes and songs are constantly incorporated
into the repertoire, from a snappy new fiddle tune called “Millennium
Eve” to a song about the war in Iraq. Trad has been enjoying a huge
surge in international popularity since the late 1960s and the 1970s,
when traditional groups such as the Clancy Brothers, the Dubliners, and
Turlough O’Carolan
Turlough O’Carolan (1670–1738) is a famous harper and composer (sometimes referred
to simply as “Carolan”). After smallpox blinded him in his teens, he learned to play the
harp; and for the rest of his years, he traveled throughout Ireland as an itinerant musi-
cian and bard, composing tunes for patrons across Ireland. He wrote more than 200
compositions that are still played today, more than 300 years later.

Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Ireland 41
the Wolfe Tones began to tour. The music has become hotter and hotter,
with international superstars like Solas, Altan, and the Corrs playing to
sold-out audiences all over the world.
The best place to hear Irish music is in a pub. Offerings range from
scheduled ballad singers to pick-up traditional instrumental sessions,
sometimes open to anyone who shows up. Ballad singers sing a range of
Irish songs, accompanying themselves on guitar, from upbeat tunes
about a night of boisterous drinking to slow songs about the death of an
Irish freedom fighter. Instrumental sessions can range from small,
planned, miked sessions to giant acoustic sessions open to anyone who
wants to play. In instrumental sessions, you often find tin whistles (also
called penny whistles — thin, recorder-type instruments), wooden Irish
flutes, fiddles (the same as violins; just played differently), bodhráns
(handheld goatskin drums; pronounced bow-rons), mandolins, uilleann
pipes (the Irish version of bagpipes; pronounced ill-un), concertinas
(small accordion-type instruments), and accordions. Other instruments
Starting your Irish music collection
The following six CDs are a great beginning — or addition — to your Irish musical
library:
 From the Beginning: The Chieftains 1 to 4 (1999): Along with several other groups,
The Chieftains are responsible for popularizing traditional Irish music. The musi-
cians are top-notch, playing a gorgeous collection of tunes on these four compi-
lation CDs.
 Live in Seattle: Martin Hayes & Dennis Cahill (1999): Fiddler Martin Hayes and
guitar player Dennis Cahill are an unbelievable pair. Hayes is a virtuoso known for
his breathtaking improvisations and ornaments on traditional tunes, and Cahill
provides the perfect back-up.
 Lake Effect: Liz Carroll (2002): Chicago-born Liz Carroll is one of my favorite fiddle
players. She uses stunning ornamentation and variations in her playing, and com-
poses fabulous new tunes.
 Music at Matt Molloy’s (1992): This CD is as close as you can get to an Irish music
session in your living room without inviting a bunch of musicians over. Crack open
a can of Guinness and listen to the wild reels, jigs, and songs, all recorded live in
Chieftain musician Matt Molloy’s Pub in Westport, County Mayo.
 Solas (1996): This CD features some of the most beautiful and spirited playing of
Irish supergroup Solas. Singer Karan Casey’s voice is as clear and pure as spring
water, giving life to the English and Gaelic songs that pop up between the instru-
mental tunes.
 The Well-Tempered Bow: Liz and Yvonne Kane (2002): I swear that I also like musi-
cians who don’t play the fiddle and aren’t named Liz! That said, this CD, by fiddle-
playing sisters from Connemara, contains lovely tunes played with grace and style.

that show up include bones (animal bones used for rhythmic accompa-
niment), guitars, banjos, harmonicas, bouzuki, and harps.

Background Check: Recommended 
Books and Movies
Ireland has produced a wealth of wonderful literary figures and has its
share of great filmmakers. The books and movies in the following sec-
tions should enhance your appreciation and understanding of the island.
Also see “Who’s Who in Irish Literature,” earlier in this chapter.
Fiction
For a look at Dublin in the beginning of the 20th century, wrap your mind
around the works of James Joyce, including his famous novels A
Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man, Finnegan’s Wake, and Ulysses,
and his short story collection, Dubliners.
Roddy Doyle offers a funny and sometimes poignant look at contempo-
rary Ireland in his novels, which include Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, A
Star Called Henry, and the trilogy The Commitments (the basis of the
movie), The Snapper, and The Van.
Other novels to check out include:
 Finbar’s Hotel, edited by Dermot Bolger, is composed of seven
intertwining short stories by seven well-known Irish novelists.
 Niall Williams’ Four Letters of Love is a mystical, poetic, romantic
novel set in Galway.
 Juno and Juliet, by Julian Gough, is a beautifully written contem-
porary novel about a pair of twins away for college in Galway.
Autobiography
If you haven’t read it yet, pick up Angela’s Ashes, Frank McCourt’s
wrenching novel about growing up in poverty in Limerick.
Written by former IRA member Ernie O’Malley, On Another Man’s
Wound: A Personal History of Ireland’s War of Independence is a
fascinating collection of memoirs about Ireland’s fight for independence
between 1916 and 1921.
Great Blasket Island, off the coast of the Dingle Peninsula, was home to 
a small and very traditional Irish community up until the 1950s. This
island of storytellers produced several excellent writers. In Peig: The

Autobiography of Peig Sayers of the Great Blasket Island, the epony-
mous author relates the hardships and joys of life on the island. Twenty
Years A-Growing, by Maurice O’Sullivan, is a beautifully written, inno-
cent book about growing up on Great Blasket.
McCarthy’s Bar: A Journey of Discovery in the West of Ireland, by
Pete McCarthy, is a hilarious travelogue about journalist Pete
McCarthy’s ramblings around Ireland.
Also in the humorous vein, Round Ireland With a Fridge, by Tony
Hawks, is about . . . well . . . a guy who travels around Ireland with a
refrigerator.
Poetry
Poetry is where you hit the jackpot in Ireland. The gorgeous, mystical
poems of W. B. Yeats are a wonderful introduction to the mythology, his-
tory, and landscapes of Ireland. Collected Poems: 1909–1962 is the best
anthology.
For beautifully spun poems about farming, rural life, and the Irish land-
scape, pick up Patrick Kavanagh’s Collected Poems.
Seamus Heaney’s poems about the land are rhythmic and powerful,
sounding like music when read aloud. Opened Ground: Selected Poems
1966–1996 is a great sampler of his poems, and The Haw Lantern,
Death of A Naturalist, The Spirit Level, and District and Circle — all
collections — are gems.
History and politics
A Short History of Ireland, by John O’Beirne Ranelagh, gives an
overview of Irish history from pre-Christian times to 1998. If you’d like
something more comprehensive, pick up the Oxford History of Ireland
by R. F. Foster. For a look at Irish nationalism, check out The Green Flag
by Robert Kee.
There are quite a few books out about the political situation in Northern
Ireland. Among the best are We Wrecked The Place, by Jonathan
Stevenson, which features interviews with both Loyalist and Unionist
militants, and The Troubles: Ireland’s Ordeal 1966–1996 and the
Search for Peace, by Tim Pat Coogan, a history with a Republican slant.
How the Irish Saved Civilization, by Thomas Cahill, is a lively history
of how Irish monks and scribes preserved the great written works of the
West when the rest of Europe was immersed in the Dark Ages.
Movies
The Quiet Man (1952) is a version of The Taming of the Shrew, set in a
small Irish village. John Wayne plays a boxer returning to the village to
woo beautiful Maureen O’Hara. In Ryan’s Daughter (1970), filmed on
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Ireland 43

the Dingle Peninsula, a married woman grapples with her love for a
World War I British officer.
On the comedy front, The Commitments (1990) is the often-humorous
story of a motley crew of working-class Dubliners who form a soul band.
You’ll laugh through Waking Ned Devine (1998), which captures a tiny
Irish village turned upside down when one of their own wins the lottery
and then promptly dies. The Boys and Girls of County Clare (2003) is a
funny, quirky, and sweet film about two brothers competing against each
other in a traditional Irish music competition. All the great traditional
music featured is reason enough to watch the movie.
The Secret of Roan Inish (1996), a magical film that both kids and
adults enjoy, centers on a selkie — a half-woman–half-seal creature from
Celtic mythology — and her impact on an Irish family. In the same magi-
cal realism vein, Into the West (1992) tells the story of two Irish gypsy
boys who travel from the slums of Dublin to the west of Ireland in pur-
suit of their lost horse.
For a realistic and sweet look at Dublin today, rent Once (2006), a
modern-day realistic musical (with a gorgeous soundtrack) about two
young Dubliners who build a relationship through music.
Quite a few excellent movies have been made about Irish politics.
Michael Collins (1996) depicts the life of Collins, leader of the Irish
Republican Army (IRA), from the Easter Uprising of 1916 to his assassi-
nation six years later. In The Name of the Father (1993) deals with a
man wrongly convicted for an IRA bombing. The Boxer (1997) is the
story of an ex-IRA man and former boxer building a new life in Belfast.
The Wind That Shakes The Barley (2006) is an excellent film about two
brothers during the Irish War of Independence (from 1921–22) and the
subsequent Civil War (from 1922–23).

Deciding When and
Where to Go
In This Chapter
 Discovering the Emerald Isle, region by region
 Deciding how to spend your time in Ireland
 Choosing a time of year to visit
 Experiencing Ireland’s best festivals and events
W
ould you rather gaze at the rainbows that show up during the
spring in Ireland or enjoy the solitude of the countryside during
the winter? Do you want to experience Galway’s Arts Festival in July or
Cork City’s Jazz Festival in October? Should you base yourself in one
place and take daytrips or go the nomadic route? This chapter can help
you decide when to visit Ireland and gives you tips for planning your
itinerary.
Going Everywhere You Want to Be
Should you fly into Shannon or Dublin? Do you want to see the Ring of
Kerry or Donegal? Is Northern Ireland worth a visit? The information in
this section is a quick primer on the various regions of the island so you
can make informed choices about where to spend your precious vaca-
tion time. The “Ireland’s Regions” map shows the breakdown of the
areas I talk about in the following sections.
Experiencing the vibrant Dublin area
People often fly into Dublin airport and set off for the western part of the
country, with its dramatic scenery, before their plane even comes to a
complete stop. Unless you know there’s an honest-to-goodness pot o’
gold waiting for you out west, there’s no reason to rush away. Dublin,
with its big-time hotels, restaurants, shops, clubs, pubs, and museums,
is a vibrant city with plenty to hold your attention (Chapter 11 covers
this city). South of the city, the counties Wicklow and Kildare (see
Chapter 13) offer green hills, loads of outdoor activities, and some of the

most beautiful gardens in Ireland. And just north of Dublin are counties
Meath and Louth, which contain magnificent prehistoric ruins (see
Chapter 12).
Touring the southeastern counties
The southeastern counties of Wexford, Waterford, Kilkenny, and
Tipperary offer the famous Waterford Crystal Factory, the bustling
harbor town of Wexford, the medieval streets and storybook castle of
Kilkenny Town, verdant farmland, the historic Rock of Cashel, and more.
Sound good? It is — read Chapter 14 to find out more.
Swinging by the southern and southwestern counties
Cork City is a bustling place, with terrific restaurants and a healthy arts
scene, plus an array of diverse attractions nearby, including a wildlife
park and the Blarney Stone. West Cork County offers quaint towns,
including Kinsale, the gourmet capital of Ireland, plus stunning cliff,
beach, and island scenery.
If the southern counties of Ireland were a high school, County Kerry
would be the prom queen. It’s long been Ireland’s hottest tourist spot,
offering awe-inspiring vistas of the sea, cliffs, and green mountains (most
commonly viewed on a drive around the Ring of Kerry or the Dingle
Peninsula), plus a number of lively towns and a rich offering of Gaelic
culture.
Wandering the western counties
The west of Ireland offers the wonderful city of Galway, with its great
restaurants, excellent pubs (including plenty with traditional Irish
music), and hot arts scene. Then there’s the incredible scenery of the
West, including the beaches and sheer Cliffs of Moher in Clare; the wild,
mountain-filled landscape of Connemara; the woods, lakes, and beaches
of Sligo; and the craggy coastline of Donegal.
Rambling through Northern Ireland
When you cross that invisible border between the Republic and
Northern Ireland, the first thing you’re likely to notice is that you don’t
notice anything different. The landscape is as green, and the people are
as friendly. Highlights are the rolling Mourne Mountains, the spectacu-
lar North Antrim coast, the hopping city of Belfast, and the history-rich
city of Derry.
Scheduling Your Time
You can put together your own custom trip in numerous ways, but the
two easiest methods for seeing Ireland on your own are the base-camp
approach and the nomadic approach. Check out Chapter 4 for some sug-
gested itineraries.
Part I: Introducing Ireland 
46

Settling on the base-camp approach
For this approach, pick two or three cities or towns, and make daytrips
out from them. Base yourself in lovely cities like Kinsale or Kenmare (to
explore the South), Galway (for the West), Dublin (for Dublin City and
the areas south and north), and Belfast (for the North). If you have only
one week, and you’ve never been to Ireland before, you may want to
plant yourself in Dublin for a couple of days and then move out to the
West of Ireland.
Many top sights are within an easy drive of these base-camp towns. By
staying a couple of nights in the same place, you save the time and
hassle of switching hotels every day and worrying about check-in and
check-out times.
Self-catering accommodations (lodgings with kitchens and laundry facili-
ties) are a cost-efficient option that families and groups choosing the
base-camp approach may want to consider. For more information, check
out Chapter 8.
Opting for the nomadic approach
I recommend touring Ireland with a car and moving from place to place
over the course of your vacation. I’ve laid out this guidebook to intro-
duce areas in a counterclockwise direction from Dublin City. If you take
the nomadic approach, plan your itinerary so that you make some sort
of circuit, starting and then finishing in the city where you arrive and
depart Ireland.
If you want to see both the East and the West of Ireland and you have
limited time, I highly recommend flying into Dublin and out of Shannon,
or vice versa. It won’t cost you any more than booking a round-trip to
and from the same airport, and it’s a great time-saver.
It’s sometimes better to forgo seeing a few places entirely than to try to
fit too much in. Ireland is a country that invites lingering over meals,
spending late nights in the pub, and just parking the car and taking an
impromptu ramble.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
This section presents the highlights and drawbacks of the four seasons.
Summer
The most popular and arguably the best time to tour Ireland is the
summer.
Chapter 3: Deciding When and Where to Go 47

Summer is great because
 Ireland is just plain gorgeous during this time of year. Try to think
of your hotel’s high-season rates as a cover charge for the great
weather. Temperatures often stay comfortably warm and breezy
during the day and drop to that perfect light-sweater temperature
at night. Don’t hold me to this forecast — you’ll still get caught in
the rain, but it will be a bearable, if not pleasant and refreshing,
experience.
 Summer is when all attractions are open and offer the longest
hours; some attractions (mostly in smaller towns) abbreviate their
hours or close completely during the off season.
 Daylight lasts seemingly forever (until at least 11 p.m. at the height
of summer), giving you extra time for sightseeing.
But keep in mind that
 Every major attraction, hotel, and restaurant is likely to be jam-
packed. If you’d rather escape crowds, this is not the time to go.
 Lodging prices are at their highest during this time.
Fall
Fall is probably the most underrated time to visit Ireland — days are
mild, with not too much rain, and daylight lasts until nearly 9 p.m.,
which is great for marathon sightseeing.
Fall is great because
 In late September or early October, hotel prices start to drop. Even
some restaurants offer menus with lower prices.
 You won’t find the overwhelming crowds you do in summer, but
there are still enough people traveling the country that the smaller
towns don’t feel desolate. Plus you’re more likely to have the
chance to hang out with the Irish folks, because they’re back from
their summer holidays.
But keep in mind that
 Weather can be a little dicey sometimes, with cold temperatures
and rain beginning to settle in.
Winter
Although winter is not the ideal time to travel to Ireland, there are a few
benefits to going in this harsh season.
Part I: Introducing Ireland 
48

Winter is great because
 Prices are at their lowest all across the country, and you’re likely to
find the cheapest fares of the year to get to the country.
 You’re liable to have the run of the country. And the landscape is
still beautiful — winter doesn’t take as hard a toll on Ireland’s
plants and trees as it does in many areas of North America.
But keep in mind that
 Ireland is spared snow, for the most part, and the temperature
doesn’t dip to extreme lows; but the forecast is often cold, rainy,
and windy.
 Lots of places close for the season, including many attractions and
some small hotels and B&Bs. If they don’t close, attractions often
have much shorter hours.
Spring
Spring is a fantastic time to travel in Ireland.
Spring is great because
 The warmer temperatures, flower-filled scenery, and longer days
combine to make wonderful circumstances for touring the country.
 The locals are fresh from their own break from tourists and are
ready to start playing host.
But keep in mind that
 This is the beginning of the high season, so prices go up starting
around March and popular attractions start to get busy (though it’s
not as crowded as in the summer).
 The weather’s pretty rainy in the spring (though rain showers usu-
ally last only part of the day).
 A few attractions are not open yet, and some still have abbreviated
hours.
Walking on Sunshine and Singing
in the Rain: Ireland’s Climate
Ireland has a pretty moderate climate; it’s rare to get a scorching
summer day or a bitterly cold winter day. Table 3-1 lists the average tem-
perature of each month.
The key to dressing for Ireland is layers because, as the Irish like to say,
you often end up getting all four seasons in one day.
Chapter 3: Deciding When and Where to Go 49

From the true-stereotypes file: It rains often. No matter what time of the
year you go, chances are slim that you’ll make it back without having an
encounter with a shower, so pack a raincoat or umbrella.
Rain falls heavier and more often during certain times of the year —
winter especially. Also, certain places on the island see more rain than
others. The southwest of the country (Counties Limerick, Clare, and
Kerry) tends to get more rain all year round.

Weather and temperature aren’t the only factors involved in deciding
when to go. The amount of daylight varies greatly from season to
season. Ireland is situated at such a high latitude that summer days are
blissfully long (sunset as late as 11 p.m.), but winter days are short
(sunset as early as 4:30 p.m.). Remember, the more daylight there is, the
more sights you get to see.

Perusing a Calendar of
Festivals and Events
Just about any time you visit Ireland, some sort of event or festival is
sure to be going on. About a zillion events are held each year, of all
kinds. I’ve sorted through and picked the highlights. You may notice the
absence of January and February on the list below. These two months
are the slowest in Ireland in terms of festivals and events.
Dates often fluctuate from year to year, so I generally list roughly the
time of the month when the event occurs, rather than the specific dates.
For dates, call the event’s number or visit its Web site.
Also, check the months before and after the one that you will be in
Ireland, as many festivals are on the cusp of two months, and some
events (such as the Wicklow Gardens Festival) stretch over several
months.
Attention, sports fans: Check out the golf, horse-racing, hiking, and fish-
ing sections in Chapter 9 for events of particular interest to you.
March
The feast day of the patron saint of Ireland is celebrated at the 
St. Patrick’s Day Dublin Festival (% 01-676-3205; www.stpatricks
day.ie), a six-day festival of music, street theater, and fireworks, with a
huge parade down O’Connell Street. Usually begins on March 12, with
the parade falling on March 17.
Irish dancers from around the world compete in the World Irish
Dancing Championships (% 01-475-2220; www.worldirishdancing.
com). Location varies. Late March or Early April.
April
The Pan-Celtic Festival (% 074-912-1160; www.panceltic.ie) in
Letterkenny, County Donegal, celebrates all the Celtic nations and fea-
tures music, dancing, sports, parades, and more. Early to mid-April.

December
On St. Stephen’s Day, people all over Ireland have been reviving the old
tradition of “Hunting the Wren.” In past centuries, groups of boys would
chase down and kill a wren, then parade it from house to house while
singing songs and collecting money and treats. The money would usu-
ally be used to hold a large dance for the whole village. Nowadays, kids
and adults, both male and female, travel from house to house with a fake
or a caged wren, playing music, singing, and collecting money for chari-
ties or community projects. December 26.

Ireland: Home of Halloween
Many of the traditions that exist around Halloween originated among the Celts thou-
sands of years ago. The Celts marked the beginning of winter on November 1 and they
believed that the boundaries between the spirit world and the living world were more
permeable than usual at this time. In order to scare off the spirits, many Celts wore
masks (the roots of our contemporary tradition of wearing costumes). And in order to
satisfy the spirits, many would leave an offering of food by the entrance to their home
(the origin of today’s treats).

reland is a jewel box, filled with vibrant cities, charming towns, and
stunning landscapes and seascapes. If you’re overwhelmed by the
bounty of choices and the different routes around the country, the four
itineraries in this chapter may help provide some structure.
These itineraries are intended for travelers with a car, but the first three
can be followed by bus as long as you keep on top of the schedules.
Seeing Ireland’s Highlights in One Week
This tour guides you to many of the Ireland’s most popular highlights. If
you don’t like the idea of switching hotels or B&Bs every night, I recom-
mend skipping some destinations and extending your stay in the places
that appeal to you the most. This itinerary takes you through many
places that are on the beaten visitor track, so if you’d prefer to visit
remote, untouched places, this isn’t the route for you.
Day 1: Dublin
Fly into Dublin (most flights arrive in the morning). Get settled in your
hotel or B&B, and then visit the Dublin Tourism Centre if you’d like to
scope out some free literature on daytrips, tours, and so on. Head over
to Trinity College to see the Book of Kells and explore the campus. If
you like, take the Historical Walking Tour that leaves from the front
gates of Trinity. Grab a quick lunch, and then catch the Hop On Hop Off
bus, a bus tour with narration that hits the top sights in Dublin. As the
name implies, you can hop off the bus to explore an attraction and then

Suggested Itineraries
Part I: Introducing Ireland 
56
Part I: Introducing Ireland 

continue your journey on a later bus. Highlights of the bus tour include
the Guinness Brewery, the National Museum, and St. Stephen’s Green.
After your bus tour, have dinner before heading to Oliver St. John
Gogarty’s Pub for the Musical Pub Crawl or to Duke’s Bar to begin the
Literary Pub Crawl. See Chapter 11 for more information on Dublin.
Day 2: Dublin to Kilkenny
Walk off your traditional Irish breakfast by visiting some of the Dublin
landmarks you missed yesterday, such as Merrion Square or the
Grafton Street area for shopping. Then pick up your rental car and head
south through Wicklow, perhaps stopping to take in beautiful Powers-
court Gardens and peaceful Glendalough. Make your way to the
medieval city of Kilkenny, check into your hotel (Butler House is a great
choice), explore the town if it’s still early, and treat yourself to a nice
dinner after a long drive. See Chapter 13 for more information on
Wicklow and Chapter 14 for more on Kilkenny.
Day 3: Kilkenny to Kinsale
If you didn’t get to look around much yesterday, spend the first part of
the day visiting the highlights of Kilkenny, including Kilkenny Castle and
the Design Centre. Then head south toward Waterford City to take the
tour of the Waterford Crystal Factory. After that, drive west along the
coast towards Kinsale, stopping at the quaint harbor town of Cobh.
Definitely plan to be in Kinsale for dinner so that you can enjoy one of
the town’s fabulous restaurants. You can read up on Waterford in
Chapter 14; I cover Kinsale in Chapter 15.
Day 4: Kinsale to Killarney
Head off to Killarney in the morning, possibly spending some time on
the Beara Peninsula along the way. Check into your hotel, and then set
out to explore gorgeous Killarney National Park. Back in the town of
Killarney, you may want to finish your day with a visit to The Laurels,
where you can always hear someone singing an Irish ballad. For more on
County Kerry, including Killarney, turn to Chapter 16.
Day 5: Killarney to Ennis
Get up really early so that you can drive at least part of the Dingle
Peninsula, County Kerry’s lesser-known (and therefore less crowded)
driving tour. (Competing with the tour buses that drive the popular Ring
of Kerry is not for the faint of heart.) Plan on a late lunch in Dingle Town.
Set out toward Ennis, stopping in Adare, with its thatched-roof cottages,
for an early dinner (The Wild Geese is excellent) before heading on to
Ennis to spend the night. Before flopping into bed, check out the tradi-
tional music scene in town; Poet’s Corner in the Old Ground Hotel is
always a good bet. For information on Ennis and the rest of County
Clare, see Chapter 17.
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 57

Day 6: Ennis to Galway City
Right after breakfast, make your way west, and hold onto your hat (it’s
really windy!) at the Cliffs of Moher. Then drive up through the Burren
to Galway City, stopping perhaps for a walking tour of the Burren with
Shane Connolly. Get into Galway City in time for dinner at one of the
city’s fabulous restaurants (Nimmo’s is my favorite) and some excellent
traditional Irish music at the Crane Bar. Find out more about Galway in
Chapter 18.
Day 7: Galway City to Shannon or Dublin
Head back to Dublin or Shannon today. If your flight leaves from Dublin,
drive north of the city to see Newgrange, a prehistoric burial site, on
your way back (I cover Newgrange in Chapter 12). After you check into
your hotel, treat yourself to dinner at the Mermaid Café or the Winding
Stair, and then pub-crawl through trendy Temple Bar. If you are leaving
from Shannon, you might explore beautiful Connemara during the day
(see Chapter 18), and then spend your last night like royalty at Bunratty
Castle (see Chapter 17).
Touring the Best of Ireland in
Two Weeks: A Whirlwind Tour
This tour is for those who want to cram in visits to as many places as
possible and don’t mind spending significant chunks of time in the car
each day. If this doesn’t describe you, check out this tour and then cut
out a few destinations so that you can spend longer in those destina-
tions that appeal to you.
Part I: Introducing Ireland 
58
Discovering the magic of Ireland
off the beaten path
Some of the most magical moments of your trip to Ireland may be those times when you
turn down that little road toward a tiny farming village or when you happen into a road-
side pub, where fires are roaring and fiddles are tuning up for an evening of music, or
when you spontaneously decide to take a stroll down to a glimmering lake for a picnic.
This book can help you discover the highlights of the country, but I can’t emphasize
enough the wonderful rewards that often result from following your instincts in getting
off the well-trod path.

For the first ten days, follow the itinerary for a week in Ireland, which I
lay out in the preceding section, adding a second day to take in more of
Dublin’s sights and adding two days between Days 5 and 6 to see the
Ring of Kerry or the Dingle Peninsula — or spend one day on each (I
would spend my two extra nights on the Dingle Peninsula). Ignore Day 7,
because it outlines the trip back to Dublin or Shannon from Galway.
Day 10: Galway City to Westport
Have a leisurely morning in Galway City, and then set out to drive around
Connemara, visiting Connemara National Park and taking the gorgeous
R335 route. Make your way up to the cute and bustling town of Westport
in County Mayo for the night. Drop in to Matt Molloy’s for traditional Irish
music. Read up on Connemara in Chapter 18 and Mayo in Chapter 19.
Day 11: Connemara to Sligo
Spend some more time exploring Connemara before meandering up to
County Sligo today. You many want to book in Temple House, arriving
early enough to tromp around the grounds before dinner. I cover County
Sligo in Chapter 19.
Day 12: Sligo to Derry
Head up through Donegal today, exploring the peninsula north of
Donegal Bay. End your day by crossing the border into Northern Ireland
and staying in Derry for the night. The Merchant’s House and the
Saddler’s House are great places to stay, and you can’t go wrong with a
meal at Brown’s Bar and Brasserie or Spice. See Chapter 20 for more on
Donegal and Chapter 21 for information on Derry.
Day 13: Derry to Belfast
Leave Derry early to head up to Antrim, where stops at Dunluce Castle,
Giant’s Causeway, and the Carrick-A-Rede Rope Bridge are musts.
Trace the gorgeous coast down to Belfast, where you may want to
indulge in a gourmet dinner at Cayenne, and then check out the hot 
club scene. I cover County Antrim, including Belfast, in Chapter 21.
Day 14: Belfast to Dublin
Head back toward Dublin today, stopping at the prehistoric tomb of
Newgrange before you hit the city (see Chapter 12). Treat yourself to
dinner at the Mermaid Café or the Winding Stair in Dublin and then hit
the pubs for your last night in Ireland.
Discovering Ireland with Kids
Ireland is a family-friendly place, and with a little planning, you can have
a terrific time with your children. In this itinerary, I pulled together some
of the most kid-friendly sights, hotels, and restaurants.
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 59

Day 1: Dublin
Fly into Dublin (most flights arrive in the morning), and head to your
hotel or B&B. Your best option for a hotel is Jurys Christchurch Inn,
which has family-friendly rates and is within walking distance of most
sites and restaurants. Kids will love Dublinia, a hands-on museum about
Dublin during medieval times. For lunch, head to Elephant & Castle,
with its great burgers and omelets. In the afternoon, explore Phoenix
Park and Zoo if it’s nice out, or hit the National Museum. A fun dinner
pick is the Bad Ass Café. Turn to Chapter 11 for more information on
these and other kid-friendly picks in Dublin.
Day 2: Dublin to Kilkenny
Get rid of excess energy before your car trip with a good walk around
Dublin, visiting some of the city’s landmarks such as the Ha’Penny
Bridge and St. Stephen’s Green. As you make your way to Kilkenny,
play some good car games, such as “Count the Sheep!”, and stop to stroll
around Powerscourt Gardens. Get your bearings in Kilkenny with a
short walk before dinner. You can find more on Kilkenny in Chapter 14.
Day 3: Kilkenny to Cork City
Next stop: Cork City. You’ll have plenty of time to visit Blarney Castle
on the way, as well as the exotic animals at Fota Wildlife Park. In Cork,
Red Pepper is a cute spot with a tremendous selection of pizzas. See
Chapter 15 for more on Cork.
Day 4: Cork to Killarney
Head out to Killarney National Park for lakes, waterfalls, and plenty of
scenery to keep young travelers happy. Be sure to visit the Muckross
Traditional Farm. Back in town, your little princes or princesses will
likely enjoy eating at the Killarney Manor Banquet. Read up on
Killarney and the rest of County Kerry in Chapter 16.
Day 5: Killarney to Limerick City
Stick around County Kerry for an excursion to the Dingle Peninsula.
Kids (and parents) shouldn’t miss a visit with Fungie, Dingle Bay’s resi-
dent dolphin. After a full day exploring the Dingle Peninsula, head north
to spend the night in Limerick City or picture-perfect Adare. See Chapter
17 for more on Limerick City and Adare.
Day 6: Limerick City to Galway City
On the way to Galway City, drive through the Burren. If your kids are
old enough, a walk is a great idea. Get into Galway City early enough for
dinner at Couch Potatas, an all-baked-potato eatery. Your best bet for a
hotel is the Jurys Galway. I cover Galway in Chapter 18.
Part I: Introducing Ireland 
60

Day 7: Galway City to Dublin or Shannon
If you’re flying home from Dublin, you’ll have to hit the road early. Try to
take a walk around Galway before you go, and make a fun stop in the
nearby resort and amusement park town of Salthill. If you still have the
stamina after you reach Dublin, drive a little north of the city to see the
ancient burial site of Newgrange (see Chapter 12 for more information).
By the time you get back to Dublin, the whole family will be tuckered
out. If you’re leaving from Shannon, treat your family to a night at
Bunratty Castle (see Chapter 17).

Part II
Planning Your Trip 
to Ireland

In this part . . . 
B
efore you can start planning your trip to Ireland, you’ll
want to do some legwork. How much will it cost? What
are your options for getting there? What about your choices
for getting around? What kinds of accommodations are avail-
able? The chapters in this part give you the answers to all
these questions and more.
Of course, there’s the bottom line. Chapter 5 features informa-
tion on currency in Ireland, planning your budget, what things
cost, and how to save money. 
Chapter 6 gives you the lowdown on how to get to Ireland,

C
an you visit Ireland for $5 a day? Maybe in 1965, but not now. How
about $40 a day? Perhaps, if you don’t mind hostel bunk beds and
grocery-store dinners. If you want hotels or B&Bs and restaurant meals,
you should figure on spending at least $130 to $175 per person per 
day — not including a rental car and airfare. Ireland has become much
more expensive in the past few years. In fact, even a simple pub dinner
may cost you $18 to $25. And you should expect to pay top price in
Dublin. But fret not, because this guide — this chapter in particular —
gives you lots of money-saving tips, and subsequent chapters offer
accommodation and dining selections that won’t tap your wallet like a
keg of Guinness on St. Patrick’s Day. Read on for tips on creating a
budget and cutting costs.
Planning Your Budget
Generally speaking, you should factor the following into your budget:
 Airfare: Airfare to and from Ireland varies depending on where
you’re flying from, the time of year, and the totally arbitrary whims
of the airline gods. On average, airfare from New York to Ireland
and back runs about $800. See Chapter 6 for tips on getting the best
airfare deals.
 Transportation: Transportation costs vary depending on whether
you’re busing or training it or renting a car. Driving — the trans-
portation choice for most tourists — costs around $150 a week for
a small car, plus gas, which can be anywhere between double and
triple the cost of gas in the U.S. Bus fares can cost anywhere from
$2 to $25 per person, depending on your destination. The train is
slightly more expensive. See Chapter 7 for more information.

 Lodging: An average double room runs about $160. Rooms on the
low end go for about $120, and those on the high end about $400.
 Meals: This is one area where it’s difficult to save money; even a
simple pub lunch can cost about $15. A good per-person allowance
for lunch is $15, and for dinner, between $20 and $35. Breakfast is
included with most accommodations, so you don’t have to figure
that into your daily costs.
 Attractions: A fair amount to budget for sights is $25 per day.
Buying a Heritage Card is worth it if you’re planning to see a lot of
sights (for more information on the Heritage Card, see “Cutting
Costs — But Not the Fun,” later in this chapter).
 Shopping: Are you planning to buy clothes, jewelry, Waterford crys-
tal, and antiques or just a few postcards, a snow globe, and some
other inexpensive souvenirs? A modest piece of Waterford crystal
can set you back $100; a nice Guinness sweatshirt is about $60.
Gauge your buying tendencies and factor them in. A perk of buying
in Ireland: You can get the value-added tax (VAT) on your purchases
refunded (I explain how under “Taking Taxes into Account,” later in
this chapter).
 Nightlife: Pubs are the most popular place to spend the evening,
and they are as free as the air you breathe, except for all those
pints of Guinness (about $6.50).
Table 5-1 offers the average costs of some common items.

Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
Worried you won’t be able to afford your trip? Well, you can rent Far and
Away, read Angela’s Ashes, listen to a Chieftains CD, and just pretend
you’re in Ireland, but what fun is that? Instead, make your vacation a
bargain by cutting a few corners. I scatter various money-saving tips
throughout this book, but I also present a list of 21 general money-savers
here, organized by category.
 Accommodations: Cut some corners in the lodging department
with these tips.
• Stay in B&Bs. I can’t emphasize enough how wonderful the
bed-and-breakfast experience is. Not only do B&Bs usually
cost less than staying in a hotel in the same area, but you also
frequently get a friendly insider perspective from the folks
running these places.
• Check out self-catering accommodations. By renting an
apartment or house (called self-catering accommodations in
this guide) for a week or more, you can save money overall
on accommodations (especially if you’re traveling with a
group) and on food because you can prepare your own meals
in the kitchen. (See Chapter 8.)
• Get out of town. In many places, hotels just outside the most
popular areas can be a great bargain. You may be able to find
a great deal just a short cab, bus, car ride, or walk away. And
as an extra bonus, hotels that are off the beaten path may
even offer free parking.
• Ask if your kids can stay in your room with you. Although
many accommodations in Ireland charge by the head, some
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 69
The ins and outs of tipping
Some restaurants include a service charge (tip) of 10 percent to 15 percent in their
bill, while others leave the tip up to you. The service charge is different from the VAT
(13.5 percent in the Republic of Ireland and 17.5 percent in Northern Ireland), which is
always included. Many restaurants note their service-charge policies on the menu; if
you can’t figure out whether the service charge has been included, just ask. If no serv-
ice charge has been added, tip up to 15 percent. If a service charge has been added,
but it is less than 15 percent, it is customary to leave a tip that rounds the charge up
to 15 percent. Bartenders do not expect a tip for dispensing drinks.

allow kids to stay for free. Even if you have to pay $10 or $15
for a rollaway bed, in the long run you’ll save hundreds by
not booking two rooms.
• Skip the fantabulous views. Rooms with great views are the
most expensive rooms in any hotel, but you probably won’t
be hanging out in your room all day, so why pay the price?
• Never make a phone call from a hotel. The marked-up fees
that hotels charge are scandalous. Walk to the nearest coin-
or card-operated phone for calls in and out of the country, or
rent or buy a cellphone.
 Attractions: Save money as you tour Ireland’s sights.
• Get your hands on a Heritage Card. A Heritage Card gives
you free admission to more than 65 attractions throughout
Ireland. You can buy the card at any participating attraction,
purchase it over the phone with a Visa or MasterCard 
(% 1-850-600-601 in Ireland, or % 01-647-6000 outside of
Ireland), or purchase it on the Internet at www.heritage
ireland.com.
• Pick up those free, coupon-packed visitor pamphlets and
magazines. Detailed maps, feature articles, dining and shop-
ping directories, and discount and freebie coupons give these
pocket-size giveaways a good wallop. Especially popular and
reliable are Discover Ireland and Ireland Guidebook. Each
tourist office should have an up-to-date magazine with infor-
mation about the surrounding area. Just ask.
 Food: Grab your grub for less with these suggestions.
• Take advantage of free breakfasts. Most accommodations
include a substantial free Irish breakfast, so don’t oversleep.
If you have a big breakfast and then wait to have a late lunch
or early dinner, you’ll save the cost of a meal a day. If the
breakfast is buffet-style, stash away a piece of fruit for an
afternoon snack.
• Try expensive restaurants at lunch or pre-theater times.
Lunch and early-bird menu prices are usually a fraction of
prices during regular dinner hours, and the menu often
boasts many of the same specialties. Early-bird fixed-price
meals are usually offered between 5:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.
• Look before you tip. Some restaurants in Ireland add a serv-
ice fee (gratuity) to the bill. Always check, or you may pay a
double tip by mistake (see the sidebar “The ins and outs of
tipping,” earlier in this chapter).
• Picnic. A fancy restaurant may have an indoor waterfall, but
can that beat dining near a real waterfall on a warm day?
Grab some food from a market or grocery store, and set up
camp outside.

 Special prices: Taking advantage of discounts and group rates can
cut your costs substantially.
• Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-
flier plans, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify
you for savings on car rentals, plane tickets, hotel rooms, and
even meals. Students, teachers, youths, and seniors are also
often entitled to discounts (see Chapter 9). Ask about dis-
counts; you may be pleasantly surprised.
• Take advantage of group and family prices. For travel pack-
ages and admission to individual attractions, group rates are
a fantastic way to save money, and you don’t necessarily
have to travel with a busload of other people to get them.
Sometimes, a group is as few as three people, so always ask.
You and the folks behind you may even be able to form a
makeshift group to get the discounted price. Most attractions
in Ireland offer significantly reduced family rates for parents
and up to four kids. Look for family prices on the rate board
at attractions, or just ask.
• Try a package tour. For many destinations, you can book air-
fare, hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightseeing
just by making one call to a travel agent or packager for a
much lower price than if you put the trip together yourself.
(See Chapter 6 for more on package tours.)
 Ground transportation: Getting around Ireland can be cheaper
than you think.
• Book your rental car at weekly rates, when possible. Doing
so often saves you money over daily rates.
• Don’t rent a gas-guzzler. Renting a smaller car is cheaper,
and you save on gas to boot. For more on car rentals, see
Chapter 7.
• Walk in cities and towns. You can easily explore all the cities
in Ireland and Northern Ireland by foot, even Dublin and
Belfast. So save the bus and cab fare and hoof it to save a few
extra pounds or euro. As a bonus, you’ll get to know your
destination more intimately, because you’ll be exploring at a
slower pace.
 Travel costs: Getting to Ireland can eat up a large chunk of change,
but planning ahead can ease the financial bite.
• Go in the off season. Traveling between November and April
saves you a lot on your airfare and the cost of accommoda-
tions. Christmas week is the exception, when many Irish in
other countries come home to visit, and the airlines cash in.
(See Chapter 6 for more information on airfares.)
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 71

• Travel midweek. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday,
or Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to your destination.
When you ask about airfares, see if you can get a cheaper rate
by flying on a different day.
Making Sense of the Currency in Ireland
The Republic of Ireland uses the euro currency, which is the currency of
many countries across Europe. Euro notes come in denominations of 5,
10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500. The euro is divided into 100 cents.
The coins come in 1¢, 2¢, 5¢, 10¢, 20¢, 50¢, 1, and 2 pieces. The word
euro is usually used in the singular, so 30 is 30 euro.
Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, which uses the pound
sterling as its currency. Pounds used in Northern Ireland are found in
notes of £5, £10, £20, £50, and £100. The pound is divisible by 100 pence
(abbreviated as p). Coins in circulation are 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1,
and £2.
The exchange rate fluctuates daily by small amounts, but Tables 5-2 and
5-3 give you an idea of what to expect. For up-to-the-minute currency
conversions, visit www.xe.com.

Handling Money
Credit cards, bank cards, and cash are all easy to use in Ireland. The
very best way to get cash in Ireland is from ATMs, which are available in
all but the tiniest villages. You may want to change $100 or so before
departing for Ireland just so you have enough money to tide you over.
All the airports have ATMs, though, so you can take out money as soon
as you land.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM,
called a “cash point” in Ireland. The Cirrus (% 800-622-7747; www.
mastercard.com) and PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) net-
works span the globe and are all over Ireland; look at the back of your
bank card to see which network you’re on and then call or check online
for ATM locations at your destination. Be sure you know your personal
identification number (PIN) before you leave home; almost all Irish ATMs
accept four- to six-digit PINs, but the keys sometimes lack letters, so
make sure you know your PIN as a number. In addition, be sure to find
out your daily withdrawal limit. Also, remember to transfer the money
that you think you’ll need during your vacation to your checking account,
since most Irish ATMs don’t let you access your savings account. Finally,
keep in mind that many banks impose a fee every time your card is used
at a different bank’s ATM, and that fee can be higher for international
transactions (up to $5 or more) than for domestic ones (where they’re
rarely more than $2). On top of this, the bank from which you withdraw
cash may charge its own fee. Some banks in the U.S. have partner banks
in Ireland or the U.K. at which no service charge is assessed (for exam-
ple, Bank of America in the U.S. is partnered with Barclay’s in the U.K.).
Check your bank’s website or call your bank to find out if this is the
case. Otherwise, you can ask your bank for its international withdrawal
fees. The best way to beat the system is to take out a lot of cash at each
ATM visit, so that you reduce the number of fees over the course of your
vacation.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money. They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit
cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you forgot
yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on the back of
your credit card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes five
to seven business days, though some banks will provide the number
over the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or some
other personal, identifying information.
Keep in mind that when you use your credit card abroad, many banks
now assess a 1 percent to 3 percent “transaction fee” on all charges you
incur abroad (whether you’re using the local currency or your native
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 73

currency). But credit cards still may be the smart way to go when you
factor in such things as exorbitant ATM fees and higher traveler’s check
exchange rates (and service fees).
Some credit card companies recommend that you notify them of any
impending trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious and block
your charges when the card is used numerous times in a foreign destina-
tion. Even if you don’t call your credit card company in advance, you
can always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is
refused — a good reason to carry the phone number with you. But per-
haps the most important lesson here is to carry more than one card with
you on your trip; a card may not work for any number of reasons, so
having a backup is the smart way to go.
Visa and MasterCard are the most widely accepted credit cards in
Ireland, with American Express coming in at a distant second place, and
Diner’s Club following at a very distant third (you rarely find a B&B that
accepts Diner’s Club). Discover is accepted very rarely in Ireland.
Some restaurants and hotels put your credit card transaction through in
your home currency. This may result in an unfavorable exchange rate, so
ask establishments to put your charges through in euro in the Republic
of Ireland and pounds in Northern Ireland.
Exchanging money
You get the best exchange rates by using an ATM, though exchanging
cash is also easy in Ireland. You can exchange money anywhere you see
a Bureau de Change sign, but you get the best rates and the most inex-
pensive exchange fees at banks. The major banks to look for in Ireland
are the Allied Irish Bank, the Bank of Ireland, National Irish Bank, and
Ulster Bank.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most towns
and cities have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw cash as
needed. However, keep in mind that you will likely be charged an ATM
withdrawal fee if the bank is not your own, so if you’re withdrawing
money every day, you may be better off with traveler’s checks — 
provided that you don’t mind showing identification every time you
want to cash one. You can cash traveler’s checks at the Bureau de
Change counter in banks all over Ireland. The vast majority of merchants,
restaurants, and lodgings do not accept traveler’s checks as payment.
You can buy traveler’s checks at most banks. They are offered in denom-
inations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and sometimes $1,000. Generally, you’ll
pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent. The most popu-
lar traveler’s checks are offered by American Express (% 800-807-6233
or % 800-221-7282 for card holders — this number accepts collect calls,
offers service in several foreign languages, and exempts Amex gold and
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Ireland 
74

platinum cardholders from the 1 percent fee.); Visa (% 800-732-1322);
and MasterCard (% 800-223-9920).
American Express, Thomas Cook, Visa, and MasterCard offer foreign cur-
rency traveler’s checks, useful if you’re traveling to one country or to the
euro zone; they’re accepted at locations where dollar checks may not be.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of 
their serial numbers separate from the checks themselves in the event
that they are stolen or lost. You’ll get a refund faster if you know the
numbers.
Taking Taxes into Account
All prices for consumer items in Ireland (except books and children’s
clothing) include a value-added tax (VAT) of about 17 percent. Happily,
travelers from the U.S. and Canada are entitled to a refund of this tax.
Here’s how it works: Many stores have stickers reading “Tax Free for
Tourists,” indicating that they are part of the Global Refund network
(www.globalrefund.com). When you make a purchase in one of these
stores, get a refund check, fill it out, and then hand in your completed
checks at the VAT-refund counter in the airport (in the departure hall in
Dublin and the arrivals hall in Shannon). If you are running late, you can
get the checks stamped by customs officials and then send them in to
Global Refund. If you forget to get your checks stamped while in Ireland,
a notary public or police officer can stamp them for you when you get
home. Some stores will give you the VAT refund at the register. In this
case, you’ll be given papers to mail before you leave the county. You can
also get the VAT refunded by stores that aren’t part of the Global Refund
network; just get a full receipt that shows the shop’s name, the address,
and the VAT paid, and then get the receipt stamped at the Customs
Office when you are leaving Ireland. You can then mail the receipts back
to the store where you made the purchase, and it will refund your VAT
with a check sent to your home.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 75
Chip and PIN: Cool New 
Credit Card Machines
If you are paying with a credit card at a restaurant, chances are that a credit card
reader will be brought to your table. In the Republic and Northern Ireland, most people
have credit cards with an embedded microchip that is activated by the reader when
they enter their 4-digit PIN. Most U.S. and Canadian cards do not have a microchip as
of this writing, so you must swipe your card, enter the tip (if needed) on the machine,
press Enter, and then sign your receipt just like you did back in the good old days.

Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Be sure to contact all of your credit card companies the minute you dis-
cover your wallet is gone, and file a report at the nearest police precinct.
Your credit card company or insurer may require a police report number
or record of the loss.
Most credit card companies have an emergency toll-free number to 
call if your card is lost or stolen; they may be able to wire you a cash
advance immediately or deliver an emergency credit card in a day or
two. Call the following emergency numbers in Ireland.
 American Express: % 1-336-393-1111 (call collect) in the Republic
and Northern Ireland.
 Diner’s Club: % 303-799-1504 (call collect) from the Republic of
Ireland, or % 0-870-1900-011 in Northern Ireland
 MasterCard: % 1-800-55-7378 in the Republic, or % 0800-96-4767
in Northern Ireland.
 Visa: % 1-800-55-8002 in the Republic, or 0800-89-1725 in
Northern Ireland.
If you need emergency cash over the weekend, when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft or fraud is a potential complication of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 877-322-8228; www.
transunion.com).
Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your airline and explain
the situation; they may allow you to board the plane if you have a copy
of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the police report you
filed.

B
ecause those jet-packs that we’ve been promised still haven’t mate-
rialized, you need to begin your vacation to Ireland with a flight or
a ferry crossing. This chapter explores the ins and outs of selecting a
flight or a ferry trip. In addition, I cover package and escorted tour
options.
Flying to Ireland
The sections here offer tips on winging your way over to the Emerald
Isle.
When you book your flight, let the ticket agent know the ages of any chil-
dren coming along. Some airlines offer child-companion fares and have a
special kids’ menu upon request. Flight attendants are usually happy to
warm up baby food and milk if you ask.
Picking an arrival airport
Your options for major international airports in the Republic of Ireland
are Dublin Airport (% 01-814-1111; www.dublin-airport.com),
located 11km (7 miles) outside Dublin on the East Coast of Ireland (via
the N1), and Shannon Airport (% 061-71-2000; www.shannonairport.
com), located 24km (15 miles) west of Limerick, on the West Coast (via
the N18).
In Northern Ireland, Belfast International Airport (% 028-9448-4848;
www.belfastairport.com) is located 31km (19 miles) west of the city.
Choose your arrival airport based on fares and on the proximity of the
airport to the starting point of your itinerary.

If you want to see both the East and the West of Ireland and you have
limited time, I highly recommend flying into Dublin and out of Shannon,
or vice versa. It won’t cost you any more than booking a round-trip to
and from the same airport, and it’s a great time-saver.
Finding out which airlines fly to Ireland
In addition to Aer Lingus (which is Gaelic for — guess what? — airline),
a few U.S. airlines fly to Shannon and Dublin airports. Getting fares from
more than one airline to compare prices is a good idea.
Here’s a list of the major airlines that fly direct to Ireland from North
America. Airline destinations change, so check the Web sites below to
find the departure and arrival points that are most convenient for you.
 Aer Lingus (% 800-474-7424 in the U.S. and Canada, % 0870-876-
5000 in the U.K., and % 0818-365-000 in Ireland; www.aerlingus.
com): There are direct flights from Boston to Shannon and Dublin;
from Chicago to Shannon and Dublin; from New York to Shannon
and Dublin; from Orlando to Dublin; from San Francisco to Dublin;
from Washington D.C. to Dublin; and from L.A. to Dublin. Flights
with layovers are available from several other cities.
 Air Canada (% 1-888-247-2262 in the U.S. and Canada; www.air
canada.com): Direct flights from Toronto to Dublin and Shannon.
 American Airlines (% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com): Flights out of
New York, Newark, Boston, and Chicago to Dublin and/or Shannon
(many of these flights make at least one stop).
 Continental (% 800-231-0856; www.continental.com): Out of
Newark, New Jersey, to Shannon and Dublin.
 Delta Air Lines (% 800-221-1212; www.delta.com): Out of Atlanta,
New York, and Orlando (one stop) to Shannon and Dublin, and out
of L.A. to Dublin (one stop).
Many U.S. airlines fly to England, where you can catch a connecting
flight to Ireland (see the list of airlines with flights from England to
Ireland later in this section). Some North American travelers take advan-
tage of this option because a flight to England and a connecting flight to
Ireland are sometimes cheaper than a direct flight to Ireland.
The major airlines that fly from the United States and Canada to 
England are:

Getting the Best Deal on Your Airfare
Competition among major airlines is unlike that of any other industry.
Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a coach seat is
a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their companies
pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book your
ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, and are willing to travel
midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can qualify for the least expensive
price — usually a fraction of the full fare. Obviously, planning ahead pays.
Search the Internet for cheap fares. The most popular online travel
agencies are Travelocity.com (www.travelocity.co.uk), Expedia.com
(www.expedia.co.uk and www.expedia.ca), and Orbitz.com. In 
the U.K., go to Travelsupermarket (% 0845-345-5708; www.travel
supermarket.com), a flight search engine that offers flight comparisons
for the budget airlines whose seats often end up in bucket-shop sales.
Other Web sites for booking airline tickets online include Cheapflights.
com, SmarterTravel.com, Priceline.com, and Opodo (www.opodo.co.uk).
Chapter 6: Getting to Ireland 79

Meta search sites (which find and then direct you to airline and hotel
Web sites for booking) include Sidestep.com and Kayak.com — the
latter includes fares for such budget carriers as JetBlue and Spirit as
well as the major airlines. Site59.com is a great source for last-minute
flights and getaways, and UKAIR.com (% 1-800-577-2900; www.ukair.
com) is known for offering discounted tickets to Ireland on already-
scheduled major flights. In addition, most airlines offer online-only fares
that even their phone agents know nothing about.
Watch local newspapers for promotional specials or fare wars, when
airlines lower prices on their most popular routes. Also keep an eye on
price fluctuations and deals at Web sites such as Airfarewatchdog.com
and Farecast.com.
Frequent-flier membership doesn’t cost a cent, but membership may
entitle you to better seats, faster response to phone inquiries, and
prompter service if your luggage is stolen or your flight is canceled or
delayed, or if you want to change your seat (especially once you’ve
racked up some miles). And you don’t have to fly to earn points; 
frequent-flier credit cards can earn you thousands of miles for doing
your everyday shopping. With more than 70 mileage awards programs
on the market, consumers have never had more options. Investigate the
program details of your favorite airlines before you sink points into any
one. Consider which airlines have hubs in the airport nearest you, and,
of those carriers, which have the most advantageous alliances, given
your most common routes. To play the frequent-flier game to your best
advantage, consult the community bulletin boards on FlyerTalk (www.
flyertalk.com) or go to Randy Petersen’s Inside Flyer (www.inside
flyer.com). Petersen and friends review all the programs in detail and
post regular updates on changes in policies and trends.
Getting to Ireland by Ferry
Ferries are not the fastest or cheapest way to get to Ireland, but they’re
still popular because they can be a more interesting and relaxing way to
travel than by air — getting there becomes part of the adventure. Ferry
service to Ireland leaves from the U.K. and France and brings you within
striking distance of Cork, Dublin, or Belfast. When you arrive, public
transportation is available from the ferry terminals to the city. You can
bring a car onto all of these ferries.
Note that the Irish Sea can be rough, so you should take a pill or patch if
you’re prone to seasickness.
For the best fares and availability on all ferries traveling to and from
Ireland and Northern Ireland, contact or search on Direct Ferries
(% 0871-222-3312 in the U.K and % 1-800-932-151 in Ireland; www.
directferries.ie). Irish Ferries (% 08705-171717 in the U.K. or 
% 0818-300-400 in Ireland; www.irishferries.com) travels to Dublin
from Holyhead, Wales, and to Rosslare in County Wexford from

(% 08705-83-83-83 in Britain and % 01-204-7777 in Ireland; www.stena
line.ie) travels from Holyhead, Wales, to Dun Laoghaire (pronounced
dun leer-ee) and to Dublin Port; from Fishguard, Wales, to Rosslare; from
Fleetwood, England to Larne, Northern Ireland; and from Stranraer,
Scotland, to Belfast. P& O Ferries (% 08716-645-645 in Britain; www.
poferries.com) travels from Liverpool to Dublin and from Cairnryan
and Troon, Scotland, to Larne, Northern Ireland. Norfolkline Irish Sea
Ferry Service (% 0870-870-1020 in Britain or % 01-819-2999 in Ireland;
www.norfolkline.com) travels from Liverpool to Dublin and Belfast.
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details, and tells you what to expect at
each leg of your journey. You know your costs up front and, in the case
of the tame ones, you don’t get many surprises. Escorted tours can take
you to the maximum number of sights in the minimum amount of time
with the least amount of hassle.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks to you pay up
front. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour opera-
tor doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you paid
for, there’s no reason to think that they’ll fulfill their insurance obliga-
tions either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency. (I tell
you more about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 10.)
Depending on your recreational passions, I recommend one of the fol-
lowing tour companies. For companies that run escorted golf tours, see
Chapter 2.
 Brian Moore International Tours (% 800-982-2299; www.bmit.
com): Many of these tours take in Ireland’s most popular attrac-
tions. The nine-day Best of Ireland Tour features voyages to
Killarney, Waterford, Dublin, Galway, and the Ring of Kerry and 
cost $1,199 to $1,529 (airfare not included) at press time.
 CIE Tours International (% 800-243-8687; www.cietours.com):
CIE offers a large selection of tours. The 12-day Irish Classic makes
a circuit around the country; it cost $2,048 to $2,498 (airfare not
included) at press time.
 Cosmos (% 800-276-1241; www.cosmosvacations.com). The
budget arm of Globus offers a slightly less upscale and less expen-
sive version of Globus trips. As we went to press, the nine-day Irish
Explorer tour cost $1,020 to $1,155 (airfare not included).
 Destinations Ireland (% 800-832-1848; www.destinations-
ireland.com) offers at ten-day trip to Ireland for $3,785 to $4,389
Chapter 6: Getting to Ireland 81

(airfare not included). The company also offers an eight-day guided
pony trek across Connemara ($2,559–$3,009 without airfare).
 Globus (% 866-755-8581; www.globusjourneys.com). Globus
offers a variety of upscale tours. The seven-day Introduction to
Ireland tour cost $1,099 to $1,149 (airfare not included) in 2008.
 Tauck World Discovery (% 800-788-7885; www.tauck.com) offers
deluxe tours of Ireland that house you in the finest hotels in the
Emerald Isle. The eight-day A Week In Ireland tour cost $3,360 in
2008 (airfare not included).

tions to ask before booking your trip, see www.frommers.com/planning.
Choosing A Package Tour
In many cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and trans-
portation to and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a
tour you book yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour
operators, who resell them to the public. It’s kind of like buying your
vacation at a buy-in-bulk store — except the tour operator is the one
who buys the 1,000-count box of garbage bags and resells them ten at a
time at a cost that undercuts the local supermarket.
Package tours can vary widely. Some offer a better class of hotels than
others; others provide the same hotels for lower prices. Some book
flights on scheduled airlines; others sell charters. In some packages,
your choice of accommodations and travel days may be limited. Some
let you choose between escorted vacations and independent vacations;
others allow you to add on just a few excursions or escorted day trips
(also at discounted prices) without booking an entirely escorted tour.
Most package tours in Ireland are of the self-drive, B&B or hotel variety;
airfare and a rental car are included, as are vouchers good at some
B&Bs. Note that many B&B owners in Ireland are frustrated by the
voucher system and choose not to accept vouchers, so your options will
be more limited than if you are traveling independently. The length of
the car rental and number of vouchers are usually not flexible (most of
the package tours cover seven or eight days), but your itinerary is com-
pletely up to you.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you;
www.libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the
Northeast, and usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.

82

Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Aer
Lingus (% 800-495-1632; www.aerpackages.com) offers some excellent
air/land packages, as do most major airlines, including American
Airlines Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com), Delta
Vacations (% 800-654-6559; www.deltavacations.com), Continental
Airlines Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.covacations.com), and
United Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com). In
addition, several big online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity,
Orbitz, Site59, and Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in pack-
ages. If you’re unsure about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check
with the Better Business Bureau in the city where the company is based,
or go online at www.bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s
based, don’t fly with it.
The following operators offer the best package tours in the business:
 Brendan Worldwide Vacations (% 800-421-8446; www.brendan
vacations.com): Brendan’s Self-Drive tours included car rental
and B&B vouchers for $65 a day (per person) at press time.
 Brian Moore International Tours (% 800-982-2299; www.bmit.
com): Brian Moore’s Amazing Ireland Tour included car rental and
five nights of B&B vouchers for $399 to $449 at press time.
 CIE Tours International (% 800-CIE-TOUR; www.cietours.com):
CIE’s Go-As-You-Please tours included car rental and six nights of
B&B vouchers starting at $51 a day per person at press time.

Chapter 7
Getting around Ireland
In This Chapter
 Renting a car in Ireland
 Taking the bus
 Traveling by train
Your choices for transportation around Ireland are trains, buses, or a
car. For most trips, I recommend renting a car, because you can get
to the less-accessible areas of Ireland (which are, of course, often the
most untouched areas in the country), and you can tour at your own
pace. In addition, if you are traveling in a group, renting a car can be the
most economical option. For those who would rather not drive the wind-
ing roads, buses are a great option — they’re cheap, run frequently, and
have big windows so you can see the country rolling by.
Seeing Ireland by Car
I think the best way to see Ireland is by car. However, I want to mention
that driving in Ireland can be harrowing at times, due to the narrow
width of some roads (in some cases two-way roads will only be one 
car-width wide) and the fact that the Irish drive on the left side of the
road, which can take some getting used to.
When planning your car trips, check out the handy mileage chart I pro-
vide on the tear-out card in the front of this book. Check out www.
aaireland.ie (click on “Menu,” and then “Route Planning”) for route-
planning help and specific driving directions. I find that the best driving
maps are the Ordnance Survey Ireland maps, available at some book-
stores or travel shops, online at www.osi.ie, and at % 01-802-5300.
Booking a rental car
In the off-season (Oct–Mar), you should have little difficulty getting a car
on short (or even no) notice. Booking anything during the summer, how-
ever, is a different story. To stay on the safe side, book any time from a
few weeks to a few months in advance.

Because prices are bound to increase based on demand, the earlier you
book your car, the better your chance of getting a deal. Some of the
major rental-car companies operating in Ireland are Auto-Europe,
Alamo, Argus, Avis, Budget, Dan Dooley, Hertz, Murray’s Europcar,
and National. The toll-free numbers and Web sites for these companies
are listed in the appendix.
If you fly into Dublin and plan to spend some time there, wait to get a car
until you’re ready to head out to the countryside. Dublin is relatively
walkable, and the bus system in the city is excellent, so you don’t need a
car — and with the lack of parking, you won’t want one. However, if
you’re planning to leave town straightaway, or if you fly into Shannon
airport, getting a car upon arrival is a good idea.
Most rental-car companies allow you to drop cars off at places other
than where you picked them up, and most do not charge a drop-off fee
(but some do, so be sure to ask). However, some companies don’t allow
you to pick up a car in the Republic and drop it off in Northern Ireland,
or vice versa.
Saving money on your rental
Car rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and when you
pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors.
Asking a few key questions may save you hundreds of dollars.
 Weekend rates may be lower than weekday rates. If you’re keeping
the car five or more days, a weekly rate may be cheaper than the
daily rate. Ask if the rate is the same for pickup Friday morning as it
is Thursday night.
 Some companies may assess a drop-off charge if you don’t return
the car to the same rental location; others, notably National, don’t.
 Check whether the rate is cheaper if you pick up the car at a loca-
tion in town rather than at the airport.
 Find out whether age is an issue. Many car rental companies add
on a fee for drivers under 25, while some don’t rent to them at all.
 If you see an advertised price in your local newspaper, be sure to
ask for that specific rate, otherwise you may be charged the stan-
dard (higher) rate. Don’t forget to mention membership in AAA,
AARP, and trade unions. These memberships usually entitle you to
discounts ranging from 5 percent to 30 percent.
 Check your frequent-flier accounts. Not only are your favorite (or at
least most-used) airlines likely to have sent you discount coupons,
but most car rentals add at least 500 miles to your account.
 As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can
make comparison shopping for a car rental much easier. You can
check rates at most of the major agencies’ Web sites. Plus, all the
Chapter 7: Getting around Ireland 85

major travel sites — Travelocity (www.travelocity.com),
Expedia (www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and
Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.com), for example — have
search engines that can dig up discounted car-rental rates. Just
enter the car size you want, the pickup and return dates, and loca-
tion, and the server returns a price. You can even make the reserva-
tion through any of these sites.
In addition to the standard rental prices, other optional charges apply to
most car rentals (and some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes). The
Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), which requires you to pay for damage
to the car in a collision, is covered by many credit card companies.
Check with your credit card company before you go so you can avoid
paying this hefty fee (as much as $20 a day).
The car rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you
harm others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your lug-
gage is stolen from your car). Your insurance policy on your car at home
probably covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, if your
own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have auto
insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your car
rental agent for more information). Unless you’re toting around the Hope
diamond, and you don’t want to leave that in your car trunk anyway, you
can probably skip the personal effects insurance, but driving around
without liability or personal accident coverage is never a good idea.
Even if you’re a good driver, other people may not be, and liability
claims can be complicated.
Some companies also offer refueling packages, in which you pay for your
initial full tank of gas up front and return the car with an empty gas tank.
The prices can be competitive with local gas prices, but you don’t get
credit for any gas remaining in the tank. If you reject this option, you pay
only for the gas you use, but you have to return the car with a full tank
or face high charges for any shortfall. If you usually run late and a fueling
stop may make you miss your plane, you’re a perfect candidate for the
fuel-purchase option.
Considering your rental options
You may think you want a larger vehicle, but keep in mind that most
roads are nail-bitingly narrow; winding down a street lined with cars and
filled with oncoming traffic, you’ll appreciate driving a minimobile. So
try to get the smallest car you think you’ll be comfortable in. Another
thought: Smaller is cheaper.
Unlike the United States, where it’s standard for rental cars to have an
automatic transmission, the standard in Ireland is a manual transmission
(stick shift). You can get an automatic — but it will cost you at least 50
percent more than a manual. Prices vary widely, so if you’re sure you
want an automatic, shop around for the best deal.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Ireland 
86

Because the driver’s side is on the right side of cars in Ireland, the stick
shift is controlled by your left hand, not your right. Sounds wacky and
hard to do, but you should get the hang of it in no time.
Paying for a rental car
Some companies require a deposit when you make your reservation,
generally on a credit card. If you book by phone, you may be asked for a
deposit.
Don’t be shocked if the rental company charges you a gas deposit on
your card, too. Just be sure to fill the tank before drop-off, and the
deposit will be taken off (good thing, because the deposit is always way
higher than the actual cost of the gas).
Gas, called petrol in Ireland, is costly. The prices that petrol stations
advertise may seem decent to U.S. citizens unaware that they’re priced
per liter, not gallon. Generally you pay twice what you would in the
United States. This is another good reason to get a smaller car: better
gas mileage.
Chapter 7: Getting around Ireland 87
Boots, bonnets, and other brouhaha
To save you confusion about the words and phrases that the Irish have for car-related
and driving-related things, here’s a list of the most commonly used (and most com-
monly confused):
 An Lar: city center
 Bonnet: Hood
 Boot: Trunk
 Carpark: Parking lot
 Dual carriageway: Divided Highway
 Footpath or path: Sidewalk
 Gear stick: Stick shift
 Lay-by: breakdown lane or pullout lane
 Motorways: Highways
 Petrol: Gasoline
 Roundabout: Traffic circle (or a rotary, if you’re from New England). These are
common, especially entering and leaving cities. Make sure you go left and yield
to the right!
 Windscreen: Windshield

Getting the scoop on driver’s licenses and insurance
If you are from the United States, Canada, the U.K., Australia, New
Zealand, or an EU country, all you need to legally drive a car in Ireland is
a valid driver’s license from your country of residence.
Your personal auto insurance most likely doesn’t extend to rental cars in
Ireland. If you have a MasterCard Platinum or Gold card in the U.S. or a
Visa Gold in Canada, check with your credit card company to find out if
they will cover auto insurance in Ireland. You must get a Collision
Damage Waiver (CDW) with your rental car (this is usually included in
the price quoted). This insurance reduces the renter’s financial responsi-
bility in the case of an accident. The car rental companies also offer
additional liability insurance (if you harm others in an accident), per-
sonal accident insurance (if you harm yourself or your passengers), and
personal effects insurance (if your luggage is stolen from your car).
Definitely consider the additional coverage of the liability insurance and
the personal accident insurance (ask your car rental agent for more
information). Unless you’re toting around the Hope diamond (and you
don’t want to leave that in your car trunk anyway), you can probably
skip the personal effects insurance.
If you plan on taking the car into Northern Ireland, be sure to inform the
rental company, and ask whether additional insurance is required.
Figuring out the rules of the road
Here are some important traffic rules and laws that will help you get
around safely and legally.
 Speed limits throughout the Republic of Ireland are listed in kilo-
meters per hour, while speed limits in Northern Ireland are in
miles per hour. In the Republic, the speed limit on local and
regional roads is 80 kmph, while the speed limit on national roads
(indicated by an N in front of a number) is 100 kmph. Standard 80-
or 100-kmph signs are indicated only by a black circle with a slash
through it (with no numbers). When the speed limit is other than
80 kmph on local and regional roads, and 100 kmph on national
roads, there’ll be a sign with a red circle and the limit written inside
in black. You often see these signs when entering small towns,
where you should always reduce speed to 50 kmph. On large
motorways (highways), the speed limit is generally 120 kmph. In
Northern Ireland, the speed limit on motorways is 70 mph, while
the speed limit on other roads is 60 mph, going down to 30 mph in
cities and towns.
 A sign that is a red circle with a red X through the middle means no
stopping or parking during posted hours.
 A flashing yellow light means yield to pedestrian traffic, but pro-
ceed with caution if it’s clear.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Ireland 
88

 When entering a roundabout (traffic circle), yield to traffic coming
from your right.
 Seat belts must be worn by drivers and front-seat passengers. If
your car has back seat belts, they must be worn as well.
 It is illegal to use a cellphone while driving in Ireland.
 Drinking and driving is a serious offense and is dealt with harshly.
Do not drink and drive under any circumstances.
If you have any further questions about traffic laws, you can call the
National Safety Council at % 096-25-000, or visit their Web site at
www.nsc.ie.
Driving on the left side of the road
To get an idea of what driving in Ireland is like, simply imagine driving in
North America and then turn that image upside down. The steering
wheel is on the right side, and the gearshift is on the left (the positions
of the gas, clutch, and brake are the same).
In highway traffic, you merge to the right while slower traffic stays on
the left. Roundabouts are tricky, and you’ll probably pop a few curbs
while making sharp lefts, but don’t get discouraged. Driving in Ireland
just takes practice, practice, practice.
Understanding parking rules and regulations
First, there’s no law that prohibits you from parking a car facing into traf-
fic. You will often see cars on one side of the road parked in both direc-
tions, which makes it tough to tell if you’re going the wrong way on a
Chapter 7: Getting around Ireland 89
How do I find a place when there’s 
no #&@*$! address!?
Welcome to one of the facts of life in Ireland: Outside of the major cities, American-
style street names and addresses simply aren’t used. As you leaf through this book,
you’ll often see the name of a B&B listed with just the town name after it. This is just
the way it works. In fact, if you were to write a letter to the place, you’d address it the
very same way, with just its name and the town.
I know what you’re thinking: “How am I supposed to find any of these places?!” Fear
not: It’s not as hard as it seems. Often, these places are right on the town’s main thor-
oughfare (such as R236 or the Dublin-Waterford road), and in these cases, if you drive
into the town, you can’t miss them. Other places are near the town’s main street and
have signs directing you toward them from the center of town. Of course, there are
also several places that are nowhere near the main part of town. In these cases, I
include specific directions.

one-way street. In larger towns, there are some, but not many, parking
garages. Street parking is fine, but instead of meters, you often have to
buy parking disks, which are paper disks that indicate how long you’ve
been in the spot. You can buy disks at machines marked P and some-
times at local shops. Purchase a disk and then display it in the window.
Residential neighborhoods and some towns require disks but have no
parking-disk machines. In those cases, local convenience stores usually
sell the disks.
Traveling by Bus
Buses are a pretty great way to see Ireland for a variety of reasons: They
make many more stops than trains, you get a great view of the country-
side from the huge windows, they’re comfortable, and they’re pretty
inexpensive. On the other hand, you’re not free to stop whenever you
want, and most buses don’t have bathrooms.
Getting to know the major bus companies
Bus Éireann is the country’s principal public coach line, with a vast net-
work of routes that web through all the major towns of Ireland and into
Northern Ireland. Bus Éireann is pretty much a tool of transportation
rather than tourism, so it doesn’t always stop right near popular sights.
The trick is to get to a town near the attraction that you want to see and
then take local transportation from there. Prices, schedules, routes, and
other information can be found at Bus Éireann on Store Street, Dublin 1
(% 01-836-6111; www.buseireann.ie).
In Northern Ireland, Ulsterbus is the area bus service, with routes that
include stops at or near the region’s attractions. You can call the
timetable hot line at % 028-9066-6630, or find information online at
www.ulsterbus.co.uk.
Finding bus packages and tours
Bus Éireann offers guided sightseeing tours that cover a number of 
top attractions. Routes become more limited in the off-season, so call
ahead to find out when each tour is offered. The major daytrips out of
Dublin are:
 Glendalough, Wicklow, and Powerscourt Gardens (see Chapter 13)
 Newgrange and Boyne Valley (see Chapter 12)
 Kilkenny City and the Nore Valley (see Chapter 14)
 Waterford Crystal and River Barrow Cruise (see Chapter 14)
 The Mountains of Mourne (see Chapter 23)
You can also book seasonal trips out from Cork, Galway, and Sligo. For
more information, visit www.buseireann.ie or call % 01-836-6111.

Riding the Rails
Ireland has an excellent rail system that connects the major cities of the
Republic and Northern Ireland; the “Irish Rail Routes” map shows the
system. The advantages of train travel are that it’s fast and very comfort-
able. On the downside, trains are more expensive and travel to fewer
destinations than buses, and you have to be ready to jump off with all
your luggage, because trains pull into the station and stop for half a
second before flying on to the next stop.
Trains between major cities run three to five times daily and are reliable.
During low season, you should have no problem buying tickets a half-
hour before departure, but during the high season, calling the day
before to confirm availability is advisable. For information about desti-
nations, times, and fares, call Iarnród Éireann (Irish Rail) at % 1850-
366-222 or visit www.irishrail.ie. In Northern Ireland, NI Railways
information is available at % 028-90-66-66-30 or www.nirailways.co.uk.
Finding train packages and tours
Excellent packages combine train travel to a destination with bus 
tours that explore non-rail-accessible destinations such as the Burren,
Connemara, and the Ring of Kerry. Some of these offerings include 
hotel accommodations. Railtours Ireland (% 01-856-0045; www.rail

re B&Bs the best value? Where can you find discounts on lodging?
How much does a swanky hotel cost? Read on for answers to all
your burning accommodations questions.
Knowing Your Options
From grand manor houses to cute and charming B&Bs, Ireland has
accommodations for a range of budgets and tastes. Anywhere you stay,
you’re likely to encounter the warmth and friendliness that are so much
a part of Irish culture. People here take a lot of pride in their hospitality.
Two of the best places to find and book hotels and guesthouses online are
at www.irelandhotels.com and www.goireland.com. Gulliver (% 066-
979-2030; www.gulliver.ie) also has a tremendous database of lodg-
ings and allows you to reserve with a credit card. The tourist boards of the
Republic of Ireland (% 1-850-230-330; www.discoverireland.ie) and
Northern Ireland (% 028-9023-1221; www.discovernorthernireland.
com) are also great sources for finding and booking accommodations.
If you’re looking for fancy manor houses and castles, check out Ireland’s
Blue Book (% 1-800-323-5463 in the U.S., or % 01-676-9914 in Ireland;
www.irelands-blue-book.com). For upscale manor houses and guest-
houses, including some of the most beautiful and oldest houses in Ireland, 
contact Hidden Ireland (% 01-662-7166; www.hidden-ireland.com).

Opting for hotels
Among hotels, the range of accommodations is wide — from castles on
down to small family-run lodges. Though you can assume that many of
the larger and chain hotels provide fitness equipment, room service, and
in-house pubs and restaurants, don’t count on these amenities in smaller
independent hotels.
The Irish Hotel Federation’s guide to hotels, manor houses, inns, and
castles is a great resource. Contact the Irish Tourist Board for a copy
(% 1-800-233-6470; www.tourismireland.com) or check it out online
at www.irelandhotels.com.
The Irish Tourist Board and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board rank
hotels from one to five stars based on the amenities and facilities
offered. These ratings give you a rough idea of what you can expect in
terms of room service, dataports, and so on, but they don’t say much
about the character of the places or about the owners and staff.
The following chains have quality hotels in major cities throughout the
country. I list them here, starting with the most upscale.
 Jurys: % 01-607-0070; www.jurys.com (locations in Dublin,
Waterford, Cork, Galway, Limerick, and Belfast)
 Tower: % 01-428-2400; fax 01-428-2411; www.towerhotelgroup.
com (locations in Dublin, Waterford, and Derry)
 Travelodge: www.travelodge.ie (locations in Dublin, Waterford,
Cork, Limerick, Galway, Derry, and Belfast)
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accomodations 95
Getting the best room
After you make your reservation, asking one or two questions can go a long way
toward making sure you get the best room in the house.
 Always ask for a corner room. These rooms are usually larger, quieter, and have
more windows and light than standard rooms, and they don’t always cost more.
 Ask if the hotel is renovating. If it is, request a room away from the renovation
work.
 Inquire, too, about the location of the restaurants, bars, and discos in the hotel —
all sources of annoying noise.
And if you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to the front desk. If they
have another room, they should be happy to accommodate you, within reason.

Staying in casual comfort: Choosing B&Bs
Though they’re not for everyone, I think that bed-and-breakfasts (B&Bs)
are the best lodging option in Ireland. Because they’re small, they give
you an opportunity to get to know the owners, who much more often
than not are friendly and knowledgeable about the area. Another big
advantage of choosing a B&B over a hotel is the price. The cost of a
double room is usually much lower than at a hotel, averaging between
80 ($52) and 120 ($104).
Keep in mind that some B&Bs don’t accept credit cards, so make sure
you have enough cash on hand when it’s time to check out.
Most B&Bs have between four and ten rooms only, so the better ones fill
up quickly during the high season. You should book at least a week in
advance of your trip — even sooner if possible.
Some B&B rooms are not en suite, meaning that they don’t have a private
bathroom. If you don’t want to share facilities with other guests, make
sure you ask for a room with its own bathroom, keeping in mind that
you’ll probably pay more for privacy.
If you’d like a booklet of the 2,000 or so B&Bs in Ireland, write to or 
call the Irish Tourist Board (% 1-850-230-330; www.ireland.ie). For
Northern Ireland, ask the Northern Ireland Tourist Board (% 028-
9023-1221; www.discovernorthernireland.com) for the free Bed &
Breakfasts guide (on the Web site, click on the “Maps & Brochures” link,
in the menu on the main page). For upscale B&Bs, including some of 
the oldest and most beautiful houses in Ireland, contact Hidden Ireland
(% 01-662-7166; www.hidden-ireland.com).
Enjoying self-catering accommodations
Self-catering accommodations are a place for you to drop your bags,
settle in, and do things family-style, including cooking your own meals
and making your own beds. If you’re making the trip with children, this
may be a perfect option, both in terms of convenience and cost.
With self-catering, you pay one price, generally for the week. (Some 
rent for two to three days.) Compared to the amount of money you pay
for hotels and B&Bs on a nightly basis, the price is usually a bargain.
Plus, food costs decrease when you’re buying your own and cooking it
yourself.
The drawback is location. Although some self-catering cottages and
apartments are in great locations, the trouble is that they don’t move:
Rent one and you’re in one place for the whole week; to see the sights
around the country, you have to drive to them and then drive “home”
again. Of course, this is fine if you intend to spend all your time in one
area. But making day trips to sights in far-flung parts of the country may
be tough.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Ireland 
96

The variety of self-catering options is as diverse as types of hotels. You
can stay in actual thatched-roof cottages or completely modernized
units. All of these accommodations are registered with the tourism
authorities and are rated from one to four stars (four being the best).
As with any place to stay, all you have to do is call the tourist board in
the area you want to visit, and the staff there will help you with book-
ings. To get you started, the following organizations deal solely with self-
catering accommodations.
 Cottages in Ireland (% 0870-236-1630; www.cottagesinireland.
com) has properties in gorgeous locations in Northern Ireland.
 Irish Cottage Holiday Homes Association (% 01-205-2777; www.
irishcottageholidays.com) rents vacation cottages in the
Republic of Ireland.
 The Irish Landmark Trust (% 01-670-4733; www.irishlandmark.
com) restores historic properties to provide some of the coolest
self-catering options in Ireland — think staying in a lighthouse
keeper’s cottage.
 Northern Ireland Self-Catering Holidays Association (% 028-
9043-6632; www.nischa.com) rents cottages in Northern Ireland.
 Rent an Irish Cottage (% 061-41-1109; www.rentacottage.ie)
organizes self-catering in cottages all over Ireland.
 Self-Catering Ireland (% 053-913-3999; www.selfcatering-
ireland.com) is the most comprehensive reservation service,
offering three- and four-star self-catering apartments throughout
Ireland and Northern Ireland.
 Trident Holiday Homes (% 01-201-8440; www.thh.ie) offers a
good selection of rentals all over Ireland.
Staying at a hostel
Hostels have a reputation for being the accommodation of choice for the
micro-budgeted, and if you have an image in your head of hostels full of
young, tireless travelers who don’t mind going long stretches without
showers or food, you’re partly right — though only partly. Today, hostels
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accomodations 97
Spas!
Ireland has an exploding spa industry. Spas with accommodations are occasionally
called “health farms” (which always makes me picture a cow in a bubble bath), and
offer all sorts of therapies and treatments in addition to delicious, healthy food. For
options, check out Health Farms of Ireland (% 091-794-959; www.healthfarms
ofireland.com).

serve all kinds of independent travelers who cherish flexibility, and many
hostels are adding more facilities to accommodate couples and families.
Some Irish hostels offer community kitchens, and many sleep people dorm-
style, with anywhere from four to dozens of people per room (some have
single-sex dorm rooms while others are co-ed). However, more and more
Irish hostels have been adding double and family rooms, and even private
single rooms, so you may not need to share a room with other travelers.
Hostels provide a blanket and pillow, and some beds have sheets, but to
be safe, bring your own sleep-sack — two twin sheets sewn together.
Because your personal belongings most likely sit at the foot of the bed,
you may wonder how safe your luggage will be in a hostel. Theft is not a
major problem, but it is something to consider. Many hostels provide
security lockers (ask when you reserve if it’s important to you), but if
not, take some precautions: Make your luggage as difficult to get into as
possible by, for instance, stacking bags on top of one another, with the
most valuable at the bottom. Also, bring your wallet, passport, and
other important personal belongings to bed with you, and under no cir-
cumstances leave important documents or money in your room.
As for bathrooms, think of high-school gym restrooms — cold tiles, a
row of small sinks and toilets, and shower stalls. You may not love it, but
you can get the job done in it.
I can’t vouch for every hostel in Ireland, but if there’s one undeniable
fact, it’s that they’re cheap. You can get a warm bed in a dorm for under
$35. And you meet people from all over the world doing the same thing
as you. Sure, you run into your share of hostels that don’t exactly disin-
fect the toilet daily, but on the whole, Irish hostels are the cleanest I’ve
seen anywhere.
Some hostels take reservations. Others are first-come, first-sleep. If
you’re planning to do a hostel tour of Ireland, you’ll really benefit from
joining Hostelling International (www.hihostels.com) before you
depart. Fees are about $28 a year for adults. With a membership card,
you get discounts at places affiliated with the group.
To find hostels in the Republic of Ireland, check out An Óige, the Irish
Youth Hostel Association (% 01-830-4555; fax 01-830-5808; www.
anoige.ie). For hostels in Northern Ireland, contact or visit YHANI
(Youth Hostels Association of Northern Ireland), also called HINI 
(% 028-9032-4733; fax 028-9031-5889; www.hini.org.uk).
Frolicking at Farmhouse accommodations
For information on staying on a farm, check out the Irish Farm Holidays
Association (% 061-309-955; www.irishfarmholidays.com).
If you are interested in working on a farm in Ireland, visit the World-
Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms site (www.wwoof.org).

Seeking out alternatives
If you’re looking for something a little different from the usual hotel or
B&B, try one of these options:
 Caravans (trailers/motorhomes): For information on renting or
buying a caravan or trailer, contact Irish Caravan & Camping
Council (fax 098-28237; www.camping-ireland.ie).
 University housing: Check with local tourist boards or directly
with universities to find out whether they have unused dorm space
in campus housing to rent. Cities with large universities include
Dublin, Galway, Cork, and Limerick. Housing is usually available
only during the summer and Christmas holidays.
Figuring Out Accommodation Prices
To make it easy for you to quickly gauge the price of each lodging in this
guide, in Table 8.1, I list the cost of a double room for each option — the
cost for two people to stay in one room together. The range given typi-
cally indicates the lowest price for the room during the low season up 
to the highest price during the high season. The range also takes into
account (no pun intended) the difference in price for a room with a view,
a larger room, and so on. If you’re traveling alone, count on paying a bit
more than half the price listed for a double.
Almost every accommodation I list in the book includes a full Irish
breakfast.

Small bed-and-breakfasts often fall into this

$110–$160
B&Bs and hotels both fall into this price
range. The more expensive B&Bs are often a
bit classier and refined than those in the pre-
ceding category, with gourmet breakfasts,
prime locations, antiques-filled rooms, and so
on. Hotels in this range are usually stylish and
offer extras such as hair dryers, irons, and
microwaves.

These top-rated accommodations (most often

Finding the Best Room Rate at Hotels
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency exit dia-
grams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always
do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is surpris-
ingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be
pleasantly surprised.
In hotels and larger guesthouses, the rate you pay for a room depends
on many factors — chief among them being how you make your reserva-
tion. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with certain
hotels than you can get by yourself. (That’s because the hotel often
gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering business to that
hotel.)
Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number may also result in
a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the cen-
tral reservations number may not know about discount rates at specific
locations. For example, local franchises may offer a special group rate
for a wedding or family reunion, but they may neglect to tell the central
booking line. Your best bet is to call both the local number and the toll-
free number, and see which one gives you a better deal.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy
rates rise and fall. In most of Ireland, hotels charge the highest rate
during the high season of June through August and the lowest during the
low season of November through March. In Dublin, all bets are off
because the city receives a high volume of visitors all year, and most
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Ireland 
100

rates don’t go down during the winter. See Chapter 3 for more on the
seasons in Ireland. Know that even within a given season, room prices
are subject to change without notice, so the rates quoted in this book
may be different from the actual rate you receive when you make your
reservation.
Be sure to mention membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier programs,
or any other corporate rewards programs you can think of when you call
to book. You never know when an affiliation may be worth a few dollars
off your room rate.
See Chapter 6 for information on package tours, which often include air-
fare and accommodations sold together for a discounted price.
Surfing the Web for Hotel Deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own website or through an independent booking
agency (or a fare-service agency such as Priceline). These Internet hotel
agencies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late, competing
for the business of millions of consumers surfing for accommodations
around the world. This competitiveness can be a boon to consumers
who have the patience and time to shop and compare the online sites
for good deals — but shop they must, for prices can vary considerably
from site to site. And keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing
may be there for no other reason than that they paid money to get the
placement.
In addition to the online travel booking sites Travelocity, Expedia,
Orbitz, Priceline, and Hotwire, you can book hotels through Hotels.
com, Quikbook (www.quikbook.com), and Travelaxe (www.travel
axe.net).
HotelChatter.com is a daily webzine offering smart coverage and critiques
of hotels worldwide. Go to TripAdvisor.com or HotelShark.com for help-
ful independent consumer reviews of hotels and resort properties.
It’s a good idea to get a confirmation number and make a printout of
any online booking transaction.

Traveling with the Brood: 
Advice for Families
Ireland is a wonderful place to travel with a family; the language, food,
and culture is familiar enough to be comforting, while it’s different
enough to be exciting. As a general rule, children are more than welcome
at attractions, accommodations, and restaurants.
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet from
sites such as the Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com),
a comprehensive site that offers customized trip planning; Family
Travel Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com), an award-winning
site that offers travel features, deals, and tips; Traveling Internationally
with Your Kids (www.travelwithyourkids.com), a comprehensive site
offering sound advice for long-distance and international travel with chil-
dren; and Family Travel Files (www.thefamilytravelfiles.com),

which offers an online magazine and a directory of off-the-beaten-path
tours and tour operators for families.
Most attractions and some public transportation companies in Ireland
and Northern Ireland offer reduced fees for children. And most attrac-
tions have family group prices (usually for two adults and two or three
children) that are a great bargain. Be sure to ask. (See more money-
saving tips in Chapter 5.)
Car rental companies provide necessary car seats, and all vehicles have
rear seatbelts. The law requires that children always buckle up.
For a small additional fee, you can sometimes add a cot to your room at
a hotel, guest house, or B&B so that your child can stay in the same
room as you. Check with the concierge or manager.
Throughout this book, I point out kid-friendly accommodations, dining
options, and attractions — just look for the Kid Friendly icon.
To find more kid-friendly hotels and B&Bs, go to www.irelandhotels.
com, click on “Detailed Search,” and specify the child-friendly facilities
that you are looking for. Note that a daycare facility in Ireland is called 
a creche.
Making Age Work for You: 
Advice for Seniors
Mention the fact that you’re a senior citizen when you make your travel
reservations — many hotels offer discounts for seniors. The Irish Tourist 
Board (% 1-850-230-330; www.ireland.ie) publishes a list of discount
hotel packages for seniors, called Golden Holidays/For the Over 55s.
In Ireland, people over the age of 60 qualify for reduced admission to
theaters, museums, and other attractions, as well as discounted fares on
public transportation.
Senior discounts will usually be listed under the term “OAP,” which
means Old Age Pensioner and means that exact same thing that “senior”
does in the United States.
Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277;
www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels, airfares, and car rentals. AARP
offers members a wide range of benefits, including AARP: The Magazine
and a monthly newsletter. Anyone over 50 can join.
Many reliable agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market.
Elderhostel (% 800-454-5768; www.elderhostel.org) arranges study

programs for those ages 55 and older (and a spouse or companion of
any age) in the United States and in more than 80 countries around the
world. American tour operator CIE Tours (% 800-CIE-TOUR; www.
cietours.com) gives discounts to seniors on some of its tours.
Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts 
for seniors include the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.

Accessing Ireland: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Ireland has accessibility regulations for public areas, though they’re not
as comprehensive as in the United States. Most sidewalks have ramps,
and many accommodations are wheelchair-accessible. Getting around in
cities and towns isn’t hard, but some of Ireland’s attractions are not very
accessible. Not every museum has closed captions for video presenta-
tions, and not every castle has an entrance ramp. Calling ahead to find
out about accessibility at attractions and at B&Bs (many of which 
aren’t wheelchair-friendly) is always a good idea, but you can feel fairly
confident that most restaurants and newer hotels are entirely accessi-
ble. For further information, the Access Department of the National
Disability Authority, 24–25 Clyde Rd., Dublin 4 (% 01-608-0400), can
connect you with information on wheelchair-friendly attractions, restau-
rants, and accommodations. For tips on travel in the North, contact
Disability Action (% 028-9029-7880; www.disabilityaction.org).
The Northern Ireland Tourist Board (% 028-9023-1221; www.discover

Studying Up on Ireland: 
Advice for Students
With half of its population under 30, Ireland is accustomed to catering to
students. Most attractions have student admission prices that are signif-
icantly lower than the usual prices, and many transportation companies
offer students discounts. Usually you just need to present your university 
ID card. A few attractions and companies require the presentation of an
official student ID card (instead of your regular university ID), so check
out the ISE Card (International Student Exchange Card) at www.isecard.
com or the ISIC (International Student Identity Card) at www.isiccard.com
if you want to make sure you get every last bargain.
In the United States, STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.
com) offers information on all sorts of student travel discounts. In
Canada, Travel CUTS (% 866-246-9762; www.travelcuts.com) does
the same.
Also check out youth travel company USIT (% 01-602-1904 in the
Republic of Ireland, % 028-9032-7111 in Northern Ireland; www.usit
now.ie), especially if you are thinking of studying or working in Ireland.
Following the Rainbow: Advice 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Ireland is becoming more and more gay-friendly. Though some of the
smaller towns may still have a negative reaction to homosexuality, 
the larger towns and cities — especially Dublin, Cork, and Galway —
actively support their gay population and make gay visitors feel espe-
cially welcome.
Dublin in particular has a pretty thriving gay scene, with hotels, pubs,
and clubs geared toward gay men and lesbians. George, 89 S. Great
George’s St. (% 01-478-2983), a huge pub and nightclub, is the place for
gay men to gather.
Chapter 9: Catering to Special Travel Needs and Interests 105

Your guide to all things gay and lesbian is the Gay Community News
(www.gcn.ie), a free monthly newspaper devoted to the gay community. 
The paper is available in gay-oriented venues, especially bookshops, all
over Ireland. In Dublin, the city’s Event Guide (www.eventguide.ie)
has several pages listing gay events, organization, clubs, and the like. In
addition, Queer ID (www.queerid.com) has a great listing of gay events,
clubs, and more, mostly in Dublin. Finally, see www.gaydublin.com for
information on gay-friendly hotels, pubs, and more in Dublin. Outhouse,
105 Capel St., Dublin 1 (% 01-873-4932; www.outhouse.ie), offer all
sorts of information for gay men and lesbians.
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; % 954-
630-1637; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for the gay and les-
bian travel industry, and offers an online directory of gay- and lesbian-
friendly travel businesses.
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically for gay and
lesbian travelers. Among them are Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-
2681; www.abovebeyondtours.com); Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951;
www.nowvoyager.com); and Olivia Cruises & Resorts (% 800-631-6277;
www.olivia.com).
Gay.com Travel (% 800-929-2268 or 415-644-8044; www.gay.com/travel
or www.outandabout.com) is an excellent online successor to the popu-
lar Out & About print magazine. It provides regularly updated informa-
tion about gay-owned, gay-oriented, and gay-friendly lodging, dining,
sightseeing, nightlife, and shopping establishments in every important
destination worldwide.
The following travel guides are available at many bookstores, or you 
can order them from any online bookseller: Frommer’s Gay & Lesbian
Europe, an excellent travel resource (www.frommers.com); Spartacus
International Gay Guide (Bruno Gmünder Verlag; www.spartacus
world.com/gayguide) and Odysseus, both good, annual English-
language guidebooks focused on gay men; and the Damron guides
(www.damron.com), with separate, annual books for gay men and 
lesbians.
Exploring Your Special Interests
Whether your tastes run to tracing family history or casting a line for
salmon, here are some suggestions for travelers with special interests.
Doing genealogy research
The Ireland Tourist Board publishes a book called Tracing Your
Ancestors in Ireland, which is available free from any Irish Tourist
Board office. The best online sites to begin your search for records per-
taining to your Irish ancestors are Ancestry.com (www.ancestry.com);
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Ireland 
106

the Irish National Archives (www.nationalarchives.ie), which has a
database of many of Ireland’s records; and Irish Ancestors (www.
ireland.com/ancestor), where you can begin your search with any
information that you currently have (surnames, place of birth, and so
on). Most services on the Irish Ancestors Web site require payment.
First-time ancestor-hunters may want to get started by contacting the
free genealogy advisory service at the National Library, Kildare St.,
Dublin 2 (% 01-603-0200; www.nli.ie). The Manuscripts Reading
Room at the library has many documents and records. Another terrific
resource is the National Archives, Bishop Street, Dublin 8 (% 01-407-
2300; www.nationalarchives.ie). In Northern Ireland, hit the Public
Record Office of Northern Ireland, 66 Balmoral Ave., Belfast BT9 6NY
(% 028-9025-5905; www.proni.gov.uk).
Chapter 9: Catering to Special Travel Needs and Interests 107
Connecting names and counties
Here are just a few popular Irish surnames and the counties or provinces where they
originated. Many of these families later spread throughout the island and beyond. Each
name has plenty of variations; for instance, Fitzgerald has derivations of Fitzpatrick,
Flanagan, Flynn, Fogarty, Foley, and Gaffney.
Ahearne: Clare, Limerick
Butler: Kilkenny
Donoghue: Cork, Kerry
Fitzgerald: Cork, Kerry, Kildare
MacCarthy: Munster
Maguire: Ulster
Martin: Connaught
Murphy: Sligo, Tyrone, Wexford
O’Brien: Clare, Limerick
O’Donnell: Donegal
O’Keeffe: Cork
O’Kelly: Galway
O’Neill: Ulster
O’Sullivan: Tipperary
Power: Waterford, Wicklow
Regan: Dublin, Meath
Ryan: Limerick, Tipperary
Walsh: Dublin, Kilkenny, Leitrim,
Waterford, Wicklow
What’s in a name? Ages ago, the prefixes of Irish last names signified a great deal.
Mc or Fitz meant “son of,” and O before a name meant “grandson of” or “from the
family of.” So the name O’Brien means “ancestors of the Brien family” (in this case,
the ancestors of Brian Boru, the most famous of the high kings of Ireland). You also
occasionally see a name with a Ní prefix (such as Ní Dhomhnaill), but this configura-
tion is, for the most part, archaic. Literally, it means “formerly of,” as in Triona Butler
Ní Dhomnaill, the name Triona may go by if she were a proud Dhomnaill who married
a Butler.

You can also hire someone to research your roots for you. The 
National Library maintains a list of independent genealogy researchers
(go to www.nli.ie and click on “Family History Research,” and then
“Commissioning Research”). ENECLANN, Unit 1b, Trinity College
Enterprise Center, Pearse Street, Dublin 2 (% 01-671-0338; www.
eneclann.ie), is one of the finest family-research agencies.
See the Fast Facts listings in each chapter for genealogy services specific
to that region.
Rambling your way around Ireland by foot
Hiking (usually called walking or hill-walking in Ireland) is one of the
very best ways to soak up the beauty of Ireland, whether you take off on
a weeklong trek or go for an afternoon stroll. Check out www.walking.
ireland.ie for information on trails, events, festivals, and tour opera-
tors. The best way to get information on the various hikes in an area is
to visit the local tourist information office (information on the location
of the tourist information office is included in the “Fast Facts” section of
each chapter).
Failte Ireland, in conjunction with community leaders across the coun-
try, has developed a series of looped walks that will make exploring the
countryside easy even for casual walkers and hikers. Just drive your car
to the start point and follow the well-marked paths, which take you right
back where you started. Loops range from casual strolls through open
farmland to scenic coastal hikes to more challenging routes along
rugged cliffs. There are loops available near most major tourist hotspots
(Dublin, Waterford, Killarney, Westport, and Galway, to name a few), so
you don’t have to go far to get off the beaten path. The brochure
“Walking Ireland: A selection of looped walks and walking information”
details these loops, as does the Web site www.walking.ireland.ie.
For detailed information on Ireland’s long-distance marked trails 
(many of which are composed of a series of day hikes), visit or contact
Waymarked Ways of Ireland (% 01-860-8800; www.walkireland.ie).
The company puts out a different collection of maps and walking guides
for all of the waymarked ways in each province in Ireland. Waymarked
Ways’ Selected Day Walks publication (available as a PDF online) high-
lights a selection of fabulous day walks all over Ireland. You can usually
pick these guidebooks up at the Dublin Tourism Centre and other
tourism offices, or order them directly from EastWest Mapping (% 053-
937-7835; eastwestmapping.ie).
For information on walking and hiking in Northern Ireland, visit Northern 
Ireland’s Tourist Board Web site (www.discovernorthernireland.
com), and enter “Walking” in the search bar. The Tourist Board’s publica-
tion Walk Northern Ireland is a great resource, available at the Tourist
Board Web site as a PDF and as a hard copy from most major tourist
offices in Northern Ireland. Also available at major tourist offices (and in
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Ireland 
108

a shortened format online) are detailed guides to all of Northern
Ireland’s Waymarked Ways.
You can also get a hold of a number of excellent walking guidebooks,
including Walking in Ireland (Lonely Planet), Northern Ireland: A Walking
Guide (Collins Press) and Best Irish Walks (McGraw-Hill). Good guides
are also available from An Óige, the Irish Youth Hostel Organization, 61
Mountjoy St., Dublin 1 (% 01-830-4555; www.anoige.ie), and YHANI,
Northern Ireland’s Youth Hostel Association, 22 Donegal Rd., Belfast
BT12 5JN (% 028-9032-4733).
A number of companies offer hiking vacation packages; you can find a
list at www.walking.ireland.ie. Hidden Trails (% 888-9-TRAILS;
www.hiddentrails.com) offers weeklong self-guided hiking tours in
several regions in Ireland, while Backroads (% 800-462-2848;
www.backroads.com) offers guided hiking trips. Another option is
Wonderful Ireland (% 087-761-3344; www.walkinginireland.ie),
which arranges tours in several areas of Ireland.
Teeing off on the greenest greens
Golf is the biggest sporting attraction in Ireland. For detailed information
on many of Ireland’s golf courses, visit www.golfcourse.com. You can
find more golfing information at the Golfing Union of Ireland’s Web site,
www.gui.ie. (For an itinerary of nothing but golf, see Chapter 4.)
Specialty Ireland (% 052-70-630; www.specialtyireland.com) can
help you plan and arrange itineraries that include visits to almost any of
Ireland’s many courses.
Many U.S. companies plan golf packages, including AtlanticGolf
Company (% 800-542-6224 or 203-363-1003; www.atlanticgolf.
com); Golf International (% 800-833-1389 or 212-986-9176; www.golf
international.com), and Wide World of Golf (% 800-214-4653 or
831-521-1336; www.wideworldofgolf.com).
Bicycling around Ireland
Stunning scenery, short distances between towns, and many flat 
roads make Ireland a wonderful place for cycling. Backroads (% 800-
GO-ACTIVE [% 800-462-2848]; www.backroads.com) and VBT (% 800-
245-3868; www.vbt.com) — both based in the United States — offer
package bike vacations that include bikes, gear, luggage transportation,
food, and accommodations. Irish Cycling Safaris (% 01-260-0749;
www.cyclingsafaris.com) plans and outfits trips all over Ireland. Irish
Cycling Tours (% 095-42-276; www.irishcyclingtours.com) offers
both guided and self-guided tours in the West of Ireland. For semi-inde-
pendent cycling in southeast Ireland (transfer between B&Bs is included,
but you will be cycling on your own) contact Celtic Cycling (% 051-850-
228; www.celticcycling.com).
Chapter 9: Catering to Special Travel Needs and Interests 109

If you want to create your own itinerary, you can rent a bike from an
Irish company that permits one-way rentals. Eurotrek Raleigh, Longmile
Road, Dublin 12 (% 01-465-9659; www.raleigh.ie), and Rent-A-Bike
Ireland, 1 Patrick St., Limerick (% 061-416-983; www.irelandrenta
bike.com), are two reliable options.
Fishing Ireland’s waters
Ireland may be the best place in Europe to cast your line for salmon, sea
trout, and brown trout. There are a few exceptions to the dates listed
here, but in most cases salmon season is January 1 to September 30,
brown-trout season is February 15 to September 30, and sea-trout
season is January 1 to September 30. Coarse fishing and sea angling take
place all year. Find details about fishing in Ireland from the Central
Fisheries Board (% 01-884-2600; www.cfb.ie), which also has informa-
tion about fishing licenses. Check out the Great Fishing Houses of
Ireland (www.irelandfishing.com) for information on hotels that have
private lakes and ponds and offer fishing equipment and guides.
For information on fishing in Northern Ireland, click “Angling,” under
“View All Activities,” on the Northern Ireland Tourist Board Web site
(www.discovernorthernireland.com). In Northern Ireland, you must
get a rod license and often need a permit: Contact the Fisheries
Conservancy Board (% 028-3833-4666; www.fcbni.com) to get a
license and permit.
Sailing the Irish seas and cruising the Irish rivers
Ireland’s clear waters and Gulf Stream winds rival the Caribbean, so if
you want to do some sailing, you’re in luck. Contact or visit the Web site
of the Irish Sailing Association (% 01-280-0239; www.sailing.ie), for
all sorts of information on sailing in Ireland, including a list of approved
teaching schools that rent boats.
For information on renting a boat to cruise the Shannon-Erne
Waterways, call % 1-877-298-7205 in the U.S., or % 069-77-686 in
Ireland. For information on taking a multiday cruise along the Shannon
and Erne waterways, I recommend checking out the Shannon Princess
barge at % 087-251-4809 or www.shannonprincess.com.
The charming fishing village of Kinvarra, County Galway, hosts Cruinniú
na mBad (literally, “Gathering of the Boats”) in August. The festival focuses
on races among the majestic hooker sailboats that used to carry turf
from port to port. Contact the Galway Tourist Office for information
(% 091-53-77-00; www.irelandwest.ie), or visit www.kinvara.com.
Horseback riding
What could be more romantic than clip-clopping through the Irish coun-
tryside on horseback? For a list of horseback-riding outfitters, contact or
visit the Web site of the Association of Irish Riding Establishments, 11
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Ireland

Moore Park, Newbridge, County Kildare (% 045-850-800; www.aire.ie),
in the Republic, or the British Horse Society (www.bhs.co.uk), in
Northern Ireland. For a selection of horseback-riding vacation outfitters,
visit the Web site of Equestrian Holidays Ireland at www.ehi.ie.
Spectator sports
Spectator sports are hugely popular in Ireland. Many pubs, especially in
larger cities, have the local game on — whether it’s football (soccer),
Gaelic football, rugby, hurling, or horse racing. Seeing a live sporting
event is a quintessential Irish experience.
Horse racing
Steeplechases are run year-round. The flat season (races without hur-
dles) is from mid-March to early November. The Irish Tourist Board
draws up an Irish Racing Calendar every year, and you can visit Horse
Racing Ireland (www.hri.ie) for information. Here are some of the
highlights.
 The Dublin Horse Show: The Horse Show is held during the 
first or second week in August at the Royal Dublin Society (RDS)
Showgrounds, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4. One of the biggest social and
sporting events in the country, this show features the best show
horses, riders, and jumpers in Ireland and awards the prestigious
Aga Khan Trophy. See www.dublinhorseshow.com for more 
information.
 Christmas Horse Racing Festival: This late-December festival
encompasses three days of Thoroughbred racing at Leopardstown
Racetrack, in Dublin. Call % 01-289-0500 for information, or visit
www.leopardstown.com.
 Irish Grand National: Three days of racing take place at Fairyhouse
in County Meath, starting on Easter Sunday. For information, call
% 01-825-6167 or visit www.fairyhouseracecourse.ie.
 The Budweiser Irish Derby: Three days of races are held in the
Curragh, County Kildare, on the last Sunday in June or the first
weekend in July. For information, contact the Curragh Racecourse
Office at % 045-441-205 or visit www.curragh.ie.
Greyhound racing
Greyhound racing takes place around the country, usually Monday through
Saturday at 8 and 10 p.m. The largest racetracks are the Shelbourne
Park Stadium, in Dublin, and Kingdom Greyhound Stadium, in Tralee.
For more information, visit the Irish Greyhound Board (www.igb.ie).
Rugby, soccer, hurling, and Gaelic football
These four sports are played throughout the country. Gaelic football is a
rough-and-tumble sport that combines the best aspects of American
Chapter 9: Catering to Special Travel Needs and Interests 111

football, soccer, and rugby. Hurling is a fast-paced and thrilling game akin
to field hockey or lacrosse played with a stick called a hurley stick. The
game is traced to the pre-Christian folk hero Cuchulainn.
Big matches are played in Croke Park in Dublin City (north of O’Connell
Street). You can get Gaelic-football and hurling schedule information
from the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) at % 01-836-3222 (www.
gaa.ie). You can get schedules and information for soccer from the

Remaining Details
In This Chapter
 Figuring out passports
 Looking at travel and health insurance
 Keeping in touch with friends and family at home
 Bringing the correct electrical adapters
 Knowing what to expect regarding airline security
N
ow that you’re all excited to go to Ireland, here are some final tips
on such things as passports, insurance, calling home, and bringing
the right electrical adapters.
Getting a Passport
Applying for a U.S. passport
The Web sites listed provide downloadable passport applications as 
well as the current fees for processing applications. For an up-to-date,
country-by-country listing of passport requirements around the world,
go to the “International Travel” tab of the U.S. Department of State at
http://travel.state.gov. Note: Children are required to present a passport
when entering the United States at airports. More information on obtain-
ing a passport for a minor can be found at http://travel.state.gov.
Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; processing
normally takes four to six weeks (three weeks for expedited service) but
can take longer during busy periods (especially spring). And keep in
mind that if you need a passport in a hurry, you’ll pay a higher process-
ing fee.
Applying for other passports
The following list offers more information for citizens of Australia,
Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

 Australians can pick up an application from any post office or any
branch of Passports Australia, but you must schedule an interview
at the passport office to present your application materials. Call
the Australian Passport Information Service at % 131-232, or
visit the government Web site at www.passports.gov.au.
 Canadians can pick up applications at travel agencies throughout
Canada or from the central Passport Office, Department of Foreign
Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G3 (% 800-567-
6868; www.ppt.gc.ca). Note: Canadian children who travel must
have their own passport. However, if you hold a valid Canadian
passport issued before December 11, 2001, that bears the name 
of your child, the passport remains valid for you and your child
until it expires.
 New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New
Zealand Passports Office or download it from their Web site.
Contact the Passports Office at % 0800-225-050 in New Zealand or
04-474-8100, or log on to www.passports.govt.nz.
 United Kingdom residents can pick up applications for a standard
ten-year passport (five-year passport for children under 16) at
passport offices, major post offices, or a travel agency. For informa-
tion, contact the United Kingdom Passport Service (% 0870-521-
0410; www.ukpa.gov.uk).
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
The types of insurance travelers are most likely to need are trip-
cancellation insurance and medical insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking. You can get estimates
from various providers through InsureMyTrip.com. Enter your trip cost
and dates, your age, and other information, for prices from more than a
dozen companies.
U.K. citizens and their families who make more than one trip abroad 
per year may find an annual travel insurance policy works out cheaper.
Check www.moneysupermarket.com, which compares prices across a
wide range of providers for single- and multitrip policies.
Most big travel agencies offer their own insurance and will probably try
to sell you their package when you book a holiday. Think before you sign. 
Britain’s Consumers’ Association recommends that you insist on seeing
the policy and reading the fine print before buying travel insurance. The
Association of British Insurers (% 020/7600-3333; www.abi.org.uk)
gives advice by phone and publishes Holiday Insurance, a free guide to
policy provisions and prices. You might also shop around for better deals:
Try Columbus Direct (% 0870/033-9988; www.columbusdirect.net).

114

Here is my advice on trip-cancellation and medical insurance:
 Trip-cancellation insurance will help retrieve your money if you
have to back out of a trip or depart early, or if your travel supplier
goes bankrupt. Trip cancellation traditionally covers such events
as sickness, natural disasters, and Department of State advisories.
The latest news in trip-cancellation insurance is the availability of
expanded hurricane coverage and the “any-reason” cancellation
coverage — which costs more but covers cancellations made for
any reason. You won’t get back 100 percent of your prepaid trip
cost, but you’ll be refunded a substantial portion. TravelSafe
(% 888-885-7233; www.travelsafe.com) offers both types of 
coverage. Expedia also offers any-reason cancellation coverage 
for its air-hotel packages. For details, contact one of the following
recommended insurers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.
accessamerica.com); Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919; 
www.travelguard.com); Travel Insured International (% 800-243-
3174; www.travelinsured.com); and Travelex Insurance Services
(% 888-457-4602; www.travelex-insurance.com).
If you’re ever hospitalized more than 150 miles from home, Medjet
Assist (% 800-527-7478; www.medjetassistance.com) will pick
you up and fly you to the hospital of your choice in a medically
equipped and staffed aircraft 24 hours day, seven days a week.
Annual memberships are $225 individual, $350 family; you can also
purchase short-term memberships.
Canadians should check with their provincial health plan offices or
call Health Canada (% 866-225-0709; www.hc-sc.gc.ca) to find
out the extent of their coverage and what documentation and
receipts they must take home in case they are treated in the United
States.
Travelers from the U.K. should carry their European Health
Insurance Card (EHIC), which replaced the E111 form as proof of
entitlement to free or reduced-cost medical treatment abroad 
(% 0845 606 2030; www.ehic.org.uk). Note, however, that the
EHIC only covers “necessary medical treatment,” and for repatria-
tion costs, lost money, baggage, or cancellation, travel insurance
from a reputable company should always be sought (www.travel
insuranceweb.com).
 For travel overseas, you may want to look into medical insurance.
Most U.S. health plans (including Medicare and Medicaid) do not
provide coverage, and the ones that do often require you to pay for
services up front and reimburse you only after you return home.
If you require additional medical insurance, try MEDEX Assistance
(% 410-453-6300; www.medexassist.com) or Travel Assistance
International (% 800-821-2828; www.travelassistance.com; for
general information on services, call the company’s Worldwide
Assistance Services, Inc., at % 800-777-8710).
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 115

Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it (of
course, last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any more
than they probably listen to you).
For information on purchasing additional medical insurance for your
trip, see the previous section.
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/
or chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through Medic Alert’s 24-hour
hotline. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance to
Travelers (IAMAT) (% 716-754-4883 or, in Canada, % 416-652-0137;
www.iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries
you’re visiting, and lists of local, English-speaking doctors. The United
States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-311-3435;
www.cdc.gov) provides up-to-date information on health hazards by
region or country and offers tips on food safety. The Web site www.
tripprep.com, sponsored by a consortium of travel medicine practi-
tioners, may also offer helpful advice on traveling abroad. You can find
listings of reliable clinics overseas at the International Society of Travel
Medicine (www.istm.org).
Calling the Folks Back Home
This section helps you figure out the best ways to stay in touch while
you’re away from home.
Using a cellphone outside the U.S.
For many, renting a phone is a good idea. While you can rent a phone
from any number of overseas sites, including kiosks at airports and at
car rental agencies, we suggest renting the phone before you leave home. 
North Americans can rent a phone before they depart from InTouch USA
(% 800-872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com) or RoadPost (% 888-290-
1616 or 905-272-5665; www.roadpost.com). InTouch will also, for free,
advise you on whether your existing phone will work overseas; simply
call % 703-222-7161 between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. EST, or go to http://

experiences renting from Rent A Phone Ireland (www.rentaphone-
ireland.com). You can pick up your rented phone at Dublin or Shannon
airports or at a local post office, or the company can mail the phone to
the first B&B or hotel that you stay in.
Buying a phone can be economically attractive, as many nations have
cheap prepaid phone systems. Once you arrive in Ireland, stop by a local
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Ireland 
116

cellphone shop and get the cheapest package; you’ll probably pay less
than $75 for a phone and a starter calling card. Local calls may be as low
as 10¢ per minute, and incoming calls are free on most services in
Ireland. The staff at the Vodafone store on Grafton Street in Dublin 
(% 01-670-5205) can help you pick out a phone and plan that will suit
your needs.
Using pay phones
You can find two types of pay phones in Ireland: coin-operated phones
and card-operated phones. Both kinds of phones are spread throughout
the country, and you may even see them side by side.
If you use a coin-operated phone, read the directions before you start
feeding in coins. Some phones require putting the coins in before you
dial; others have you put in the coins after the other party answers.
Have change in hand while you’re on your call — the phone gives an
extremely short warning before disconnecting.
Got no calling card? Got no change? Got no problem. The Irish have
phone cards that work the same as those in the United States, similar to
a debit card, and you can get one in many shops or at a post office.
Phone cards come in varying denominations. What’s different about the
Irish version is that you use the phone card in its own phone booth, des-
ignated by the sign Cardphone. When you enter the booth, slide the card
in the slot like you would a credit card. There’s a screen on the phone
that says how many units the card has left. The units decrease while
you’re on the phone, so you know how much time is left.
Numbers beginning with 800 or 850 within Ireland are called Freephone
numbers and are toll-free, but calling a toll-free number in the United
States from Ireland is not free. In fact, doing so costs the same as a regu-
lar overseas call.
Using a U.S. calling card
AT&T, MCI, and Sprint calling cards all operate worldwide, so using any
of them in Ireland is no problem (though hotel rooms sometimes block
these numbers, so you may need to call via pay phone). Each card has 
a local access number, which saves you the cost of dialing directly to 
the United States. When you want to use your card in the Republic of
Ireland, just call % 1800-55-0000 for AT&T, % 1800-55-1001 for MCI, and
% 1800-55-2001 for Sprint. In Northern Ireland, call % 0500-89-0011 for
AT&T, % 0800-279-5088 for MCI, and % 0800-89-0877 for Sprint. The
operator will then explain how to make the call.
If you have a calling card with a company other than one of the three I
named, contact the company before you go on the trip to see whether it
has a local access number in Ireland. Whatever card you have, call the
company before you go on your trip to see whether it has a discount
plan for calling overseas.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 117

Using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
If you have Web access while traveling, consider a broadband-based
telephone service (in technical terms, Voice over Internet Protocol, or
VoIP) such as Skype (www.skype.com) or Vonage (www.vonage.com),
which allow you to make free international calls from your laptop or in a
cybercafe. Neither service requires the people you’re calling to also
have that service (though there are fees if they do not). Check the Web
sites for details.
Accessing the Internet Away from Home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop, PDA (personal
digital assistant), or electronic organizer with a modem gives you the
most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer with you, you can
easily find computer access in Ireland.
Without your own computer
You will have no trouble finding Internet cafes in most towns (even the
small ones) in Ireland. I’ve listed the address and telephone number of
an Internet cafe for many of the destinations discussed in the book in
the “Fast Facts” sections in each chapter. Tourist Information centers
and your hotel information desk or B&B proprietor will almost always be
able to help you locate an Internet cafe.
If you are staying in a hotel that serves business travelers, you will often
find a business center with computers. Computer use in business cen-
ters is almost always much more expensive than computer use at an
Internet cafe.
With your own computer
Many hotels and B&Bs in Ireland now offer wireless access for their
guests, usually free of charge. Cafes and some of the larger hotels offer
wireless on a pay-as-you-go basis; you open your browser, pay the wire-
less service by credit card, and then have access to the Internet through
the wireless service for the amount of time that you’ve paid for.
Sending and receiving snail mail in 
the Republic and Northern Ireland
You do know you’ll be hard-pressed to get someone to pick you up at the
airport if you don’t send home any postcards, right? Post offices in the
Republic are called An Post (www.letterpost.ie for general informa-
tion) and are easy to spot: Look for a bright green storefront with the
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Ireland 
118

name across it. Ireland’s main postal branch, the General Post Office
(GPO), on O’Connell Street, Dublin 1 (% 01-872-6666), is in the heart 
of Dublin and is the hub of all mail activity (Mon–Sat 8 a.m.–8 p.m.).
Major branches, located in the bigger towns and cities, are usually 
open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Saturday 9 a.m. to 
1 p.m. Minor branches, which are in every small town, are open Monday
through Friday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 or 2:30 to 5:30 p.m., and Saturday 
9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Irish post offices sell phone cards and lottery tickets,
and you can even change money at main branches.
From the Republic, mailing an air-mail letter or postcard costs 82p
($1.30). It usually takes mail about a week to get to the United States. If
you plan to mail packages, you can save money by sending them econ-
omy, or surface, mail.
In Northern Ireland, the post offices and post boxes are bright red. The
general hours are the same as those of An Post. The cost to send a letter
or a postcard is 50p ($1).
If you need mail sent to you while on your trip in Ireland, have the sender
address the mail with your name, care of the General Post Office, Restante
Office, and the town name (for instance, Joe Smith, c/o General Post Office,
Restante Office, Galway, Ireland). Your mail will be held there for you to
pick up for 30 days. Only larger post office branches provide this service.
Figuring Out Electricity in Ireland
Electricity in the Republic of Ireland operates on 220 volts with a three-
pronged plug, and electricity in Northern Ireland operates on 250 volts.
To use American 110-volt appliances, you need a transformer and a
three-pronged plug adapter.
Some travel appliances, such as shavers and irons, have a nice feature
called dual voltage that adapts to the change, but unless your appliance
gives a voltage range (such as 110v–220v), don’t chance it. Most laptop
computers have this feature, but always check with the manufacturer as
a precaution. Plug adapters are not hard to find; your local hardware
store or even the airport should have what you need. For more informa-
tion, check out www.walkabouttravelgear.com.
Keeping Up with Airline Security
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an air-
line employee and she’ll probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 119

Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the TSA phased out gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And e-tick-
ets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. Passengers with e-tickets
can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic kiosks or
even online check-in from your home computer. Online check-in
involves logging on to your airlines’ Web site, accessing your reserva-
tion, and printing out your boarding pass — and the airline may even
offer you bonus miles to do so! If you’re using a kiosk at the airport,
bring the credit card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier
card. Print out your boarding pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to
the security checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. Curbside check-
in is also a good way to avoid lines, although a few airlines still ban
curbside check-in; call before you go.
Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt buck-
les. If you’ve got metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can pre-
vent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only
ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting
disabled passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you
can’t. Travelers in the U.S. are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “per-
sonal item” such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders
can stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in
it, it’s still considered a personal item. The Transportation Security
Administration (TSA) has issued a list of restricted items; check its Web
site (www.tsa.gov/public/index.jsp) for details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow
screeners to open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching is neces-
sary. Look for Travel Sentry certified locks at luggage or travel shops
and Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.
com). For more information on the locks, visit www.travelsentry.org.

D
ublin City and the surrounding areas offer attractions
that run from quiet mountain towns to hot, trendy
clubs. Vibrant Dublin City is home to several excellent mu-
seums, an array of fabulous restaurants serving everything
from ﬁsh and chips to gourmet fusion meals, and a varied and
hopping nightlife scene. Just north of the city are Counties
Meath and Louth, where you ﬁnd some of Ireland’s most mag-
niﬁcent ancient ruins (see Chapter 12). To the south are
Wicklow and Kildare, two counties ﬁlled with gardens and
estates, mountains, horses (especially in Kildare), and loads
of that gorgeous Irish green. You won’t want for outdoor
activities in these parts. See Chapter 13 for details.
The southeastern counties of Wexford, Waterford, Tipperary,
and Kilkenny offer an array of places to see and things to do.
Some highlights are driving along the coast and through
sweet ﬁshing villages in Wexford; watching Waterford Crystal
being created; exploring the Rock of Cashel in Tipperary; and
wandering the medieval streets of Kilkenny. See Chapter 14
for more information.

W
alking down a street in Dublin filled with hip young things heading
for an after-work pub visit, you could be in any cosmopolitan city
in the world. Dublin has undergone major changes in the past 15 years or
so. The strong software and communications economy (dubbed the
Celtic Tiger by locals) pumped money into the city, and the European
Economic Community (now the European Union) showered grants on
Ireland and on Dublin in particular. Though the Celtic Tiger’s roar has
died down to a purr, Dublin remains one of Europe’s trendiest cities.
Dublin’s population has gotten younger and much more ethnically
diverse, and the 20- and 30-something Dubs are helping create and sup-
port vibrant, cutting-edge arts, dining, clubbing, and shopping scenes.
Many of the hot restaurants, hotels, pubs, theaters, galleries, and clubs
that opened in the ’90s and early naughts are still going strong, the
streets are bustling, and the city continues to change, though the pace of
change has slowed down a bit from the breakneck speed that character-
ized the late ’90s and the first few years of the millennium.
But Dublin is not all new, new, new. Spend a few hours strolling the heart
of Dublin, and you start to get a sense of the city’s 1,000-year history.
Those hip young things are crowding into pubs that natives from two
centuries ago would recognize, and walking down cobblestone streets as
they talk on their cellphones.
This coexistence of old and new is part of Dublin’s appeal. You can
explore some of the city’s many historical attractions — the Book of
Kells, Trinity College, Christ Church Cathedral, and many more — by
day, and then sit down to a fusion cuisine meal at a hot restaurant before
joining the hordes of glittery pub- and club-crawlers.

Getting to Dublin
Dublin is one of Ireland’s two main international gateways, so if you’re
flying to the country, there’s a good chance you’ll be touching down
here. Dublin is also well connected to the rest of the country by bus,
train, and ferry routes.
By plane
Dublin International Airport (% 01-814-1111; www.dublin-airport.
com) is 11km (7 miles) north of the city, about a 25- to 45-minute drive
from the city center (An Lar in Gaelic). Aer Lingus, American Airlines
(operated by Aer Lingus), Continental, and Delta fly directly into Dublin
from the United States. Aer Lingus, British Midlands, Aer Lingus, CityJet
(operated by Air France), Lufthansa, and Ryanair have regular flights
from England. See Chapter 6 for more on flights into Ireland.
In the arrivals concourse, you’ll find an excellent travel information desk
that can help you figure out how to get to your destination, desks for the
major car-rental companies listed in Chapter 7, and ATMs.
Taxis are available outside the arrival terminal’s main entrance — just
look for the signs. The fare to downtown Dublin is about 16 to 30
($26–$35), and the trip takes 20 to 40 minutes, depending on traffic. You
should tip between 10 percent and 15 percent.
AirCoach (% 01-844-7118; www.aircoach.ie) runs 24 hours a day, at
10- to 20-minute intervals (one hour intervals between 12:30 and 4:30
a.m.), from Dublin Airport to various stops in Dublin’s city center and
south side. The one-way fare is 7 ($11) adults, 1 ($1.60) kids 5 to 12,
and free for kids under age 5. Dublin Bus (% 01-873-4222; www.dublin
bus.ie) has several routes between the airport and the city center;
check with the travel information desk in the arrivals concourse to
figure out which one to use. If you are looking to catch a bus or train out
of Dublin immediately, you can take the Airlink Express Coach (% 01-
873-4222) to the city bus station or either of the two city train stations.
Airlink also stops on O’Connell Street. The Airlink runs every 10 to 20
minutes daily from about 6 a.m. to about 11 p.m. and costs 5 ($8)
adults, and 2 ($3.20) children under age 12. Finally, some of the larger
hotels offer an airport pickup service for guests.
By ferry
A number of ferry companies have routes to Dublin from harbors in
Wales and England. See “Getting to Ireland by Ferry,” in Chapter 6, for a
listing of ferry companies and the ports that they serve. Ferries dock at
Dublin Ferryport (% 01-855-2222) or at Dun Laoghaire (pronounced
dun leer-ee) Ferryport, less than 13km (8 miles) from Dublin. Public
transportation into the city is available from both ports.
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
124

By train
Iarnród Éireann (pronounced ee-arn-rod air-an), or Irish Rail (% 1-850-
366-222; www.irishrail.ie), runs between Dublin and the major towns
and cities of Ireland, including Belfast in Northern Ireland. Trains arrive
at one of three stations: Connolly Station on Amiens Street (serving
trains from the North and Northwest, including Northern Ireland);
Heuston Station on Kingsbridge, off St. John’s Road (serving trains from
the South, Southwest, and West); and Pearse Station on Westland Row,
Tara Street (serving trains from the Southeast). The DART (Dublin Area
Rapid Transit) (% 1-850-366-222; www.irishrail.ie) commuter trains
connect the city to the suburban towns north (as far as Dundalk) and
south of the city (as far as Arklow).
By bus
Ireland’s bus system, Bus Éireann (% 01-836-6111; www.buseireann.ie),
runs between Dublin and most cities and towns in the Republic. The
city’s bus terminal, called Busaras, is on Store Street, 3 blocks east of
O’Connell Street, north of the river behind the Trading House building.
By car
N1, M1, N2, and N3 lead into Dublin from the North; N4, M4, M7, and N7
lead in from the West, and M11/N11 leads into the city from the South.
The M50 is Dublin’s beltway, surrounding three sides of the city and link-
ing most major routes into and out of town. Once you get into Dublin,
you should return your rental car or leave it in your hotel parking lot,
and use your feet, public transportation, and taxis to see the city. If you
have to bring a car into the city, there are several car parks available. On
the north side of the Liffey, parking choices include a lot off Marlbo-
rough Street (at Sean Mac Dermot Street) and one off Jervis Street (at
Lower Ormond Quay), among others. There are even more choices on
the south side of the Liffey, including one at Trinity Street (off Dame
Street), and one on Drury Street (off Stephens Street).
Orienting Yourself in Dublin
The thin ribbon of the River Liffey divides Dublin into north and south
sides. On the north side, the main thoroughfare is wide O’Connell Street,
which leads up to Parnell Square. Along the river on the south side is
hopping Temple Bar, which is filled with pubs, arts venues, and restau-
rants. Nearby Nassau Street runs along the Trinity College campus and
intersects with Grafton Street, a bustling pedestrian street that leads up
to St. Stephen’s Green, a popular park. See the neighborhood breakdown
in this section for more details.
A few words on street names: They have a tendency to change when you
least expect it. One minute, you’re on Aungiers Street; the next, you’re on
South Great George’s Street. Did you make a turn without knowing it? No,
that’s just how the streets are in Dublin, so trust your sense of direction.
Chapter 11: Dublin 125

All Dublin addresses include a digit after the word Dublin, as in General
Post Office, O’Connell Street, Dublin 1. These numbers are postal codes,
similar to American zip codes. Most of central Dublin is located within
postal codes 1, 2, and 8. Odd numbers are north of the River Liffey, and
even numbers are south of it.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Here is a breakdown of Dublin’s central city neighborhoods, from trendy
Temple Bar to posh Merrion and Fitzwilliam squares.
 O’Connell Street Area (north side of the Liffey): Although this
area once thrived as the most fashionable part of the city, it’s now
something of an aging starlet. However, efforts are being made to
restore buildings and generally rejuvenate the locale. Though you’ll
still find fast-food joints and tacky souvenir shops between stately
buildings, such as the General Post Office and Gresham Hotel, the
silvery sky-scraping Millennium Spire (affectionately called “the
stiletto in the ghetto”) is a reminder that things are changing.
O’Connell Street’s center median is home to impressive statues of
noted Irishmen, and at the top of the street, you find the serene
Garden of Remembrance, the excellent Dublin City Gallery the
Hugh Lane, and the interesting Dublin Writers Museum. A few
blocks to the east of O’Connell Street are the famous Abbey
Theatre and the James Joyce Centre; to the west are the bustling
shopping streets of Henry, Moore, and Abbey.
 Quartier Bloom/The Italian Quarter/Millennium Walk (north
side): You only thought you booked your ticket to Ireland. This area
of the north side, just over the Millennium Bridge, is Dublin’s own
Little Italy, featuring Italian wine bars, restaurants, and gelato pur-
veyors in addition to a few new non-Italian restaurants.
 Trinity College Area (south side): Across O’Connell Bridge on 
the south side of the River Liffey stands Trinity College, home 
to the Book of Kells. This sprawling campus of green lawns and
Hogwarts-style old buildings sits in the heart of the city and is sur-
rounded by classy bookstores and shops.
 Temple Bar (south side): Tucked into a spot between Trinity and
Dublin Castle is the funky and fashionable Temple Bar, where you
find pubs, hip shops, restaurants, and arts venues along cobbled
alleys. This area is always bustling and hosts a number of excellent
weekend markets, including a book market, a fashion market, a fur-
niture market, and an organic food market. In the past few years,
the area has been known for a lack of locals and countless rowdy
stag and hen (bachelor and bachelorette) parties, but cultural
offerings are luring Dubs back to Temple Bar.
 Old City–Historical Area (south side): This historical area boasts
narrow streets and ancient buildings, some dating as far back as
Viking and medieval times. Some highlights are Dublin Castle,
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
126

Christ Church Cathedral, St. Patrick’s Cathedral, and the old city
walls. A bit farther on is the Guinness Storehouse (described later
in this chapter in the “Exploring Dublin” section).
 St. Stephen’s Green and Grafton Street (south side): This area
begins at the bottom of the pedestrian Grafton Street, with its many
trendy clothing stores and its variety of street performers, and fin-
ishes up in St. Stephen’s Green — Dublin’s favorite park. This pretty
part of town has plenty of upscale shops and cafes, and is always
teeming with people.
 Merrion and Fitzwilliam squares (south side): These two square
parks are surrounded by some of Dublin’s most beautiful Georgian
townhouses, each with a distinctive, brightly colored door. Some
were once the homes of Dublin’s most famous citizens, but 
today, many of them house professional offices. Some big names
from Dublin’s past lived on Merrion Square, including the poet 
W. B. Yeats, Irish nationalist leader Daniel O’Connell, and writer
Oscar Wilde.
Finding information after you arrive
Dublin Tourism (% 01-605-7700; www.visitdublin.com) runs two
walk-in visitor centers around the center of the city and one at the air-
port. The largest and best visitor center is in the Church of St. Andrew
on Suffolk Street, Dublin 2, and is open October through May Monday
through Saturday 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., and Sunday 10:30 to 3 p.m.; June
and September Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday
10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.; and July and August Monday through Saturday 9
a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The others are at the
Arrivals Hall, at the Dublin Airport (daily 8 a.m.–8 p.m.), and at 14
O’Connell St., Dublin 1 (Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m.).
For information on events once you get to Dublin, pick up a copy of the
InDublin magazine or the Event Guide newspaper, available at the visi-
tors’ centers and around Dublin.
Getting Around Dublin
The best way to see Dublin is to lace up a good pair of shoes and hoof it.
The center of the city is compact and easily walkable. For attractions
that are not within walking distance, take advantage of the excellent bus
network. Even if you ignore the rest of this book, heed these words:
Don’t explore Dublin by car. The slow traffic and confusing streets are a
study in frustration, and parking is expensive and out of the way.
Remember that the Irish drive on the left side of the road, so look right
first before stepping into the street.
Chapter 11: Dublin 127

By bus
Dublin Bus, 59 Upper O’Connell St., Dublin 1 (% 01-873-4222; www.
dublinbus.ie), operates double-decker buses, regular buses, and imps
(minibuses) throughout Dublin city and its suburbs, with fares under 3
($4.80). The destination and bus number are posted in the windshield;
buses going towards the city center read An Lar, which is Irish Gaelic for
“center city.” You find bus stops every 2 or 3 blocks, and most bus
routes pass down O’Connell Street, Abbey Street, and Eden Quay on the
north side of the river and down Westmoreland Street, Nassau Street,
and Aston Quay on the south side. Most buses run every 10 to 15 min-
utes Monday through Saturday from about 6 a.m. to about 11:30 p.m.
and Sunday from around 10 a.m. to about 11:30 p.m. A late-night bus
service runs on a limited route Monday through Thursday from mid-
night to 2 a.m., and Friday and Saturday from midnight to 4:30 a.m. You
can check out routes and fares online.
Discount one-day, three-day, five-day, and seven-day passes are available
at convenience stores and supermarkets all over the city center, online
at www.dublinbus.ie, and at Dublin Bus headquarters (59 Upper
O’Connell St.). If you don’t have a bus pass, the buses accept exact
change only. If you pay more than the required amount, you get a coupon
for a refund that you can redeem at the Dublin Bus headquarters at 59
Upper O’Connell St.
By taxi
To get a taxi in Dublin, go to a taxi rank, where cabs line up along the
street, or hail a cab by sticking out your arm. If the cab’s roof light is on,
it means that the cab is unoccupied and ready to pick up passengers. If
possible, take a cab with a meter and a roof sign; unmarked cabs may
overcharge you. Ask for the estimated fare before you begin your jour-
ney. There are taxi ranks at large hotels, train stations, the bus station,
the O’Connell Street median near the General Post Office, opposite St.
Stephen’s Green shopping center, and near Trinity College on Dame
Street. You can also call a cab; reliable companies include Castle Cabs
(% 01-802-2222), Co-op (% 01-676-6666), and VIP Taxis (% 01-478-
3333).
In Ireland, passengers usually sit up front with the driver, rather than in
the back seat chauffeur-style.
By train
The DART commuter train (% 1-850-366-222; www.irishrail.ie) con-
nects the city to suburbs and coastal towns both north (as far as
Balbriggan) and south (as far as Greystones), and is quite a bargain for a
daytrip to a nearby town. The three stops in Dublin’s city center are
Connolly Station, Pearse Street Station, and Tara Street Station. It’s not
usually worth it to take the DART within the city center, because the
three stops are within such easy walking distance of one another. Most
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
128

DART trains runs every 5 to 20 minutes Monday through Saturday from
about 6 a.m. to about 11:45 p.m., and from about 9 a.m. to between 6
p.m. and 11 p.m. Sunday (depending on the station). Tickets are on sale
in each station and online. See the Cheat Sheet at the beginning of this
book for a DART map. The shortest journeys come in at 1.45 ($2.30)
each way, with trips to nearby seaside towns costing around 3.60
($5.80) each way.
By car
If you are completely ignoring my advice and driving in Dublin, remem-
ber to avoid parking in bus lanes or along curbs with double yellow 
lines — these are easy ways to get your tires clamped by parking offi-
cials. To park on the streets in Dublin, buy parking discs at one of the
black vending machines along the street, and display a disc in the
window of your car. See p. 125 for information on parking lots (called 
car parks here).
By Luas (tram)
Luas (% 1-800-300-604; www.luas.ie) is Dublin’s sleek, shiny tram
system. You probably won’t need it if you are spending time in the
center of the city, which is easily walkable. However, check out the map
if you are traveling outside of the city center. It is also useful for moving
between Connolly and Heuston stations. One-way fares run between
1.50 (2.40) and 2.20 ($3.50) depending on your destination.
Spending the Night in Dublin
There’s no denying it: Dublin is a hip and cosmopolitan city, and a hip
and cosmopolitan city breeds trendy (and expensive) hotels. If you’re
looking for luxury, Dublin offers an embarrassment of riches. If that trust
fund hasn’t turned up yet, your accommodation options are more lim-
ited, because central Dublin lacks the cozy, inexpensive B&Bs found in
abundance across the rest of Ireland. But fear not: This section includes
accommodation options ranging from deals for budget travelers to
extravagant hotels, where penthouse accommodations cost 1,000 or
more. See Chapter 8 for more tips and information on finding and book-
ing various types of accommodations.
Unlike accommodations in the rest of the country, some Dublin hotels
don’t significantly lower prices during the off-season (Oct–Apr).
However, many lodgings offer weekend or midweek packages, so ask.
Some of the accommodations listed here have free or discounted park-
ing, and all include breakfast in their prices unless otherwise noted.

Chapter 11: Dublin 131

Ariel House
$$–$$$$
Ballsbridge, Dublin 4
Sure, it’s located in a leafy residential area that’s about a 20-minute walk
from the center of the city (or a super-quick ride on the DART), but this
romantic hotel is worth any tradeoff in convenience. Rooms in the 1850s
house are high-ceilinged, spacious, and gorgeously furnished with Victorian
and Georgian antiques and period-style wallpaper and fabrics. Picture
velvet drapes, canopy beds (in many of the rooms), and lovely framed
prints and portraits. Don’t come expecting museum quality surroundings,
however; furnishings have a well-worn quality that you may expect in a rich
Irish great-aunt’s house. The drawing room is elegant and welcoming — you
may be inspired to take out your quill pen and write some postcards in
front of the crackling fire. If e-mail is more your style, take advantage of the
free wireless Internet connection. Ariel House’s beauty is more than skin
deep; the staff are some of the friendliest and most knowledgeable in
Dublin, making this hotel, like Kilronan House (reviewed later in this sec-
tion), one of the best choices for first-time Dublin visitors.
52 Lansdowne Rd. % 01-688-5512. Fax: 01-688-5845. www.ariel-house.net.
DART: Lansdowne Road. Rates: 89–190 ($142–$304). MC, V.
Avalon House
$
Old City, Dublin 2
This funky hostel, which plays host to a mix of travelers from teens to young
families to older groups of friends, is legendary among backpackers for its
friendliness, clean rooms, and sense of community. The atmosphere of the
hostel can be summed up in the fact that you can rent an acoustic guitar at
the front desk with a 20 ($32) deposit. Avalon House offers singles, twins,
quads, and dorm-style rooms, some with private bathrooms and some with-
out. Rooms are pretty cramped and get a zero on the décor scale (they’re
pretty sparse), but that probably won’t matter, because you can chill out in
the self-catering kitchen or in the airy Avalon Café, which offers hot drinks
and pastries and often hosts free live entertainment (Note to performers:
If you agree to put on a show, your stay is free). Be aware that the halls here
are often filled with chatter and laughter until the wee hours of the morning,
and as with any hostel, you never know if you’ll be sharing a dorm room
with early-to-bed early-to-rise travelers or those whose bedtime falls around
4 a.m. The young staff can tell you about the hottest and hippest places in
Dublin, and can arrange all sorts of excursions and tours.

The Clarence
$$$$
Temple Bar, Dublin 2
This high-class hotel has a lot to offer, including a terrific location at the
doorstep of the lively Temple Bar area, an elegant modern look, and supe-
rior service. It’s even touched by fame: The hotel is partly owned by Bono
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
132

and The Edge of the Irish rock band U2. You may not want to leave your
enormous bed (featuring Egyptian linens), where you can bliss out to CDs
on the room’s stereo. Décor is simple and chic, and each room is deco-
rated in one of the hotel’s five signature colors: crimson, royal blue,
amethyst, gold, or chocolate. The classy Octagon bar, the wonderful Tea
Room restaurant (reviewed later in this chapter), and the full-service
Therapy Spa are downstairs. The Clarence is the Jackie O of the city’s top
hotels — just plain classy.

Grafton Guesthouse
$$$
Old City, Dublin 2
This guesthouse is an incredible value, offering exceptionally neat, cute
rooms at ridiculously low prices (for Dublin, anyway). Rooms (which range
from tiny to average) are simply decorated with kitschy touches, such as
wallpaper with bright flowers and mod lamp, and there is free Wi-Fi for
those who can’t live without their Internet. The kicker is that this place is
in a central location, on hip Great George’s Street, right near Grafton Street
and Trinity College. Service is a little rushed but still friendly. Start your
day with the traditional full Irish breakfast, or try the vegetarian version,
complete with nonmeat sausages. Try to get a room on one of the upper
floors if possible, as some of the rooms on the lower floor can be noisy.

145 ($184–$232) double. AE, MC, V.
Jurys Inn Christchurch
$$$
Old City (near Temple Bar), Dublin 8
You can’t beat Jurys for value if you’re traveling as a family: This hotel
group is one of the few in Ireland that doesn’t charge extra if more than
two people share a room. Rooms here are rather uninspiring standard
hotel fare, with modern wood furnishings and white-tiled bathrooms.
However, any lack of character is compensated for by the friendly and
helpful staff and the hotel’s central location at the top of Dame Street, right
near Christ Church Cathedral and Dublin Castle (ask for a room with a view
of the cathedral). There is a restaurant and a casual cafe downstairs, and
the hotel can arrange babysitting services.
See map p. 130. Christ Church Place. % 800-44-UTELL from the U.S., or 01-454-0000.

and 2 children. Breakfast not included (full Irish breakfast 12/$19). AE, DC, MC, V.
Chapter 11: Dublin 133

Kilronan House
$$$
St. Stephen’s Green, Dublin 2
This small family-run hotel, with only 15 rooms, is one of the best places
to stay if this is your first visit to Dublin. Terry Masterson, the hotel’s
friendly proprietor, makes a point to sit down with each guest to help plan
an itinerary and to field questions about the city. Located on a quiet street
within a ten-minute walk of St. Stephen’s Green, the Georgian townhouse
features many original details, such as beautiful ceiling molding, large bay
windows, Waterford chandeliers, and hardwood floors in the public areas.
The spacious bedrooms are modern, brightly painted, and filled with nat-
ural light — ask for one with a skylight. An excellent full Irish breakfast is
served in the elegant dining room.
See map p. 130. 70 Adelaide Rd. % 01-475-5266. Fax: 01-478-2841. www.dublinn.

The Morgan
$$$
Temple Bar, Dublin 2
You know those people whose houses are the opposite of cluttered? Well,
you can pretend you’re in one of them in the Morgan’s soothing bedrooms,
which feature the whitest of bed linens, beechwood furnishings, and
abstract paintings. The staff is well aware that simplicity and luxury are
not mutually exclusive; they do their best to cater to your every need,
whether you are ordering a drink in the stylish bar, choosing music from
the CD collection, or setting up an on-site massage appointment.

122, 150, 746. Rates: 120–160 ($192–$256) double. AE, DC, MC, V.
The Morrison
$$$$
North Liffey, Dublin 1
This top-notch hotel, in league with the Clarence, is a utopia for those who
love modern, minimalist style. Public spaces are a visually pleasing mix of
high ceilings, stone floors, and modern art. The elegant, uncluttered bed-
rooms are decorated in cream, black, and cocoa, and are filled with ameni-
ties, including a state-of-the-art sound system. A recent expansion has
added rooms with all sorts of additional features including sunken tubs
with leather headrests and footrest. If all this doesn’t sound relaxing
enough, consider a treatment at the hotel’s new spa. Service throughout
the hotel is pampering and flawless. Halo, the hotel’s stylishly rustic
restaurant (reviewed later in this chapter), serves fabulous food made
with fresh Irish ingredients. Though the Morrison is located on the less-
happening north side of the Liffey, it is within easy walking distance of
Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, and many other top attractions.

Mt. Herbert Hotel
$$–$$$
Ballsbridge, Dublin 4
Family pride may play a part in the excellent maintenance of this hotel:
John Loughran, the director, grew up here when his parents were in
charge, and he seems to take pleasure in providing guests with a com-
fortable stay. Located in a residential section of Dublin, only a short DART
ride away from the heart of the city, Mt. Herbert offers sleek, slightly Asian-
influenced public areas that retain some of their original architectural fea-
tures. Bedrooms are contemporary and bright, with pine wall units and
tomato-colored carpeting. Service is friendly and helpful.

Number 31
$$$–$$$$
St. Stephen’s Green, Dublin 2
Designed by Sam Stephenson, one of Ireland’s most famous modern archi-
tects, this guesthouse is tucked away behind a vined wall on a peaceful
little lane about a ten-minute walk from St. Stephen’s Green. The style
inside is a marriage of modern design and country chic. The spacious
rooms have intentionally weathered white-wood country furniture and
cozy quilts, plus little modern surprises such as a burnished gray mirrored
wall or a sunken bathtub created with turquoise mosaic tiles. After sitting
in the glass-walled conservatory, munching on fresh-made granola and
delightful hot breakfast dishes (I loved the eggs with salmon), and chat-
ting with Deirdre and Noel Comer, your warm hosts, you may want to move
in permanently. Be sure to say hi to Homer, the resident Golden Labrador.

Shelbourne Hotel
$$$$
St. Stephen’s Green, Dublin 2
Fingers were crossed when this grande dame of Dublin was taken over by
the Marriott chain and closed for a renovation. Happily, the Shelbourne’s
stately character is still intact. Rooms are large and traditionally furnished,
and now boast all sorts of luxury amenities, including 300-thread count
sheets and LCD flat-screen TVs. Peek into Room 121, where history was
made when the Irish constitution was drafted here in 1922.

Temple Bar Hotel
$$$–$$$$
Temple Bar, Dublin 2
This hotel has everything: a terrific location in the heart of Temple Bar, a
welcoming and helpful staff, Wi-Fi, an airy Art Deco lobby, and a pleasant
restaurant serving light fare under the glow of skylights. In fact, the only
Chapter 11: Dublin 135

drawback to the hotel is the small size of the bedrooms, which feature
mahogany furniture, deep green and burgundy colors, and firm double
beds. Ask for a room away from the street if you’re a light sleeper.

Dining in Dublin
You can’t swing a cat in Dublin (not that you’d want to) without hitting a
pleasant place to eat. The city is chock-full of great restaurants for all
budgets and tastes. The trend now in Dublin (as in the rest of the coun-
try) is towards creative dishes made with the freshest Irish products
(think Irish free-range chicken served with a sauce made from local heir-
loom tomatoes). Being a diverse city, Ireland’s capital is also home to
eateries that offer cuisines from across the globe. Looking for Indian or
Mediterranean? You’ve got it. Or is it French, Tex-Mex, or Creole that’s
tempting your taste buds? No problem. And, of course, there are
Dublin’s myriad pubs, many of which offer tasty Irish fare — stew, sand-
wiches, shepherd’s pie — for low prices.
You don’t usually need reservations to dine out in Dublin, especially
during the off-season or during the week. However, if you plan on dining
somewhere posh and popular, phone ahead a couple of days, especially
on weekends or during the summer. I indicate when reservations are
necessary in the following listings.
Dublin diners tend to dress in smart casual clothes when going out to a
fancy restaurant. At all but the most chi-chi places, even a nice pair of
jeans is fine.
Lunch on the move: quick, delicious, 
inexpensive options
Need to grab a bite between attractions? Hit O’Brien’s Irish Sandwich
Bar, which offers prepackaged sandwiches, beverages, and salads; or
Nude, which sells delicious pasta, salads, sandwiches, and other quick
bites made with organic ingredients. You find branches of O’Brien’s all
over town; some of the most popular locations are 23 Dawson St., 34B
Grafton St., and St. Stephen’s Green Shopping Centre. The two Nudes in
Dublin are at 38 Upper Baggot St. and 21 Suffolk St. Meals from Nude
tend to taste best when eaten on the cricket pitch (field) or in the garden
at Trinity College (walk straight through the Trinity gate, walk past the
Old Library, and make a right at the pretty little garden with benches).
On the north side of the Liffey, Panem, Ha’penny Bridge House, 21
Ormond Quay Lower (% 01-872-8510), is a popular spot for a lunch of
soup or pasta of the day. The baked goods are a big draw, and the coffee
and hot chocolate are delicious. Kid-friendly Apache Pizza, 58 Dame St.,
at Eustace Street (% 01-677-8888) is a perfect stop for some quick chow

or a postbar bite. You can get pizza by the pie or slice, or try a famous
Totem Roll: pizza ingredients stuffed into a hoagie bun and baked. The
new cafebardeli, in the former location of Bewley’s Oriental Café, on 12
South Great Georges St. (% 01-677-1646), serves up simple, inexpensive
fare in sumptuous surroundings of stained glass, dark wood, marble
tables, and crystal chandeliers.
Finally, I can’t think of a better sightseeing pick-me-up than a freshly
made crepe folded around banana slices and Nutella. Follow the crowds
to the incredibly popular Lemon Crepe & Coffee Co., 68 South William
St., Dublin 2 (% 01-672-9044). Lemon Jelly, 10–11 Essex St. (% 01-677-
6297), in Temple Bar, is another spot where you can satisfy your crepe
cravings.
Pub grub
Pubs are a great place to get a good, relatively cheap lunch or dinner.
Most serve real stick-to-the-ribs Irish options, such as stew or shep-
herd’s pie, along with a few lighter options such as salads and sand-
wiches. Some of your best bets for good food are:
 Brazen Head, 20 Lower Bridge St. Dublin 8 (% 01-679-5186)
 Davy Byrne’s, 21 Duke St., Dublin 2 (% 01-677-5217)

Dublin’s Top Restaurants A to Z

closed due to a fire, but is planning to reopen.

JAPANESE
This place bears a striking resemblance to my idea of heaven, with an end-
less parade of sushi and other Japanese treats traveling before your eyes,
courtesy of a refrigerated conveyor belt. Here’s how it works: You take a
seat at the conveyor belt, and grab whatever looks good. The five differ-
ent colors of the plates correspond to different prices, and your server cal-
culates your bill based on the number and colors of the plates that you
stack up. The restaurant offers a number of deals, including the popular 55
Time special (Sun–Wed and Fri from 5 p.m. on), which allows you to eat
all you can from the conveyor belt in 55 minutes for 25 ($40; drink and
miso soup included). Prices are also slashed half an hour before closing —
to 1.25 ($2) per plate Sunday through Thursday, and 1.75 ($2.80) on
Chapter 11: Dublin 139

Friday and Saturday. I particularly recommend the eel sushi, the shrimp
tempura maki rolls, the edamame (steamed soybeans), and the rich
caramel-and-banana dessert. The modern décor is simple and chic, but it
probably won’t matter, because you’ll be hypnotized by the conveyor belt.
The restaurant also offers fine pan-Asian sit-down meals such as a chile-
and-lemon beef udon dish.

Temple Bar, Dublin 2
AMERICAN
No, you don’t have to be tough to come here (the name refers to the
restaurant’s donkey mascot), but you do have to be hungry. This Dublin
institution occupies an old warehouse and has a fun, casual, airy look and
feel, with cash shuttles that whisk your money across the room to the
cashier, bright colors, and windows looking out onto the teeming streets
of Temple Bar. Some of the best pizza in the city is served here, including
the delicious Kitchensinkio, which sports every topping you can think of.
Pastas, burgers, and other basic dishes round out the menu, and the salads
are fresh and delicious. The whole menu is kid-friendly, especially the
bottom portion, which lists the sundaes and other desserts.

ITALIAN
This isn’t the place for a romantic dinner; the restaurant is so noisy with
chatter and laughter that your companion may mistake your sweet noth-
ings for “Please pass the peas.” However, the buzz doesn’t distract diners
from digging into such delicious classic southern Italian dishes as delicate
gnocchi in marinara sauce and an out-of-this-world bruschetta with garlic,
tomatoes, and basil. The setting is classy, with white walls, candles, and
light wood, and the service is good. Most dishes are at the lower end of
the price range listed below.

Beshoff

O’Connell Street area, Dublin 2
FISH AND CHIPS
If there were an Olympic category for best chipper (fish-and-chips shop),
and I were the judge, Beshoff would get the gold. The fish here is as fresh
as can be, its juices sealed in by a fried golden-brown crust; the chips (fries)
are cut fresh each day and are thick and deliciously dense. If you like salt
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
140

and vinegar to begin with, you’ll love how they complement fish and chips,
so ask for them. If you feel the same way about fish that my friend Shannon
does — “If it comes from the sea, let it be” — take heart and order the
chicken option. Beshoff’s rival is Leo Burdocks, at 2 Werburgh St., Dublin
8 (% 01-454-0306). I think Beshoff is better, but let me know your vote.

ITALIAN/PIZZA
This restaurant, run by Italians, serves food for people who know and love
their Italian cuisine. It’s frequented by groups of locals, making it hard to get
into on weekends, but the gnocchi, huge variety of pizzas, and tiramisu make
it worth the wait. The interior is casual, with warm lighting and blue table-
cloths. Save room for the delicious gelato served up at the storefront next
door, run by the same folks. Come here for a casual Italian meal if you are in
the Temple Bar area; if you’re looking for something more formal, try Il Posto

choices for a casual lunch. The kitchen works to accommodate people

plucked randomly from Dublin’s sidewalks (Jesus is an Indian student at Trinity

AMERICAN
Locals and visitors alike pile into this immensely popular, buzzing joint in
the heart of Temple Bar, which serves exceptional burgers, salads, omelets,
and other American diner fare. Burger-slingers around the world should
cross their fingers that Elephant & Castle doesn’t open a branch in their
town, because these juicy, flavorful burgers are some of the best I’ve ever
tasted. Garlic-philes must try the garlic burger, with roasted garlic cloves,
garlic butter, and aioli; another winner is the burger with horseradish, black
pepper, and sour cream. Or go for a tasty omelet or a fresh, generous salad.
And don’t miss the beverage list, which offers everything from elderflower
soda to fresh limeade. This warm, relaxed restaurant, with its wood booths
and funky paintings and photos (my favorite is a painting of a sign shop,
reading “Advertise with SIGNS. We make them.”), is the perfect place to
watch the crowds of people who parade down Temple Bar.

tandoori, Fitzer’s menu features a variety of delicious, simply prepared
dishes from around the world. The surroundings are casual and airy, the
atmosphere is classy without being unapproachable, and the staff is
friendly. Fitzer’s is a chain, though each of the three locations has a dif-
ferent menu and prices. The one located on Dawson Street, just blocks

“Please sir, may I have some more?” I’m sure the friendly staff at gruel
would happily accommodate little Oliver Twist’s appeal, though after
seeing the gigantic portions here he may reconsider his request. Every city
should have a place like gruel — a bright, casual restaurant that serves
inexpensive, hearty, creative dishes. Groups of friends and couples chat
over fresh salads, homemade soups, and main courses that change daily
but may include the likes of vegetable tagine served with couscous and
mint yogurt, and bangers and mash with onion jam. As you wait for your
food, check out the art exhibits on one wall, the posters for upcoming con-
certs on another wall, and the funky pink fireplace graced with Campbell’s

just adds to the general feeling of ease and comfort. The menu features
many creatively put-together “nouveau” Italian dishes, such as the duo of
duck breast and lamb’s liver with braised balsamic lentils and walnuts,
served with a red-wine-and-cinnamon poached pear and a toffee jus. The

You know you’re in for a delicious Indian meal as soon as you take a bite
of the complimentary airy pappadum, which are served with a trio of
sauces: sweet pineapple chutney, tangy cilantro sauce, and a spicy red
sauce. The atmosphere is refined and romantic, with exotic fresh flowers
on each table and candlelight casting a golden glow on the faces of the
couples and small groups of friends dining here. The menu is filled with
great options, from traditional Indian favorites such as Chicken Tikka
Masala to more unusual choices such as Nalli Gosht — tender roast lamb
in a hot broth with the chef’s special spices. Be sure to order the Pulao
Rice — fluffy, spiced basmati rice — to complement your main dish.

Old City, Dublin 2
GLOBAL/VEGETARIAN
Juice is a casual, friendly little slice of health-conscious California in the
heart of Dublin. Small groups of friends and solo diners drop in to chat, flip
through the newspaper, or write in their journals over generous portions of
vegetarian and vegan dishes that take their inspiration from cuisines all
over the planet. You find everything from miso soup to spicy bean burgers
to crepelike pancakes served with organic maple syrup shot through with
mango puree. And as the name not-very-subtly suggests, you also find all
kinds of juices, which are so fresh, they taste like you just inserted a straw
directly into the fruit or vegetable. High ceilings, curved walls, a metal panel
covered with Christmas lights, and candy-colored glass flower vases and
votive holders give this place a warm, funky air that invites lingering, espe-
cially on a cool, rainy day (not that Dublin has any of those).

single dish from the inventive offerings can be difficult. The menu changes
often, but dishes on a recent night included Asian braised pork belly with
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
144

wilted greens and pear-and-watercress salad; duck with potatoes, sweet-
ened chicory and green peppercorns; and Bayonne ham with watermelon,
arugula, and feta cheese. Everything is prepared with an eye to preserving
the character and flavor of the ingredients; I was especially happy that the
vegetables were not cooked into submission. The atmosphere is a happy
marriage of stylish and casual; groups of friends pull up mismatched chairs
to tables adorned with tea lights and small bowls filled with cracked
pepper and sea salt, and there is a cute garden in the back for warm-
weather dining. A kind of strange thing: They don’t serve any soda.

The Mermaid Café
$$$$
Dublin 2
NEW IRISH
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Dublin, because it serves innova-
tive dishes made with some of the freshest, most flavorful ingredients
around. The menu changes seasonally, offering the likes of Irish Angus rib-
eye steak with sage-and-mustard mashed potatoes and garlicky beans; yel-
lowfin tuna with plum tomatoes, capers, mint, and wasabi mayonnaise;
and a salad of asparagus and quail eggs with shaved parmesan and greens.
The crowd is always buzzy and chic; businesspeople descend on the
restaurant at lunch, while dinner sees more couples and small groups. The
surroundings are cozy and modern, featuring contemporary art, white
wood walls, high-backed pine chairs, and solid pine tables. Save room for
the unbelievable desserts, including pecan pie served with maple ice
cream. The two- and three-course lunch deals are excellent.

Grafton Street Area, Dublin 2
CONTINENTAL-NEW IRISH
This is my number-one pick for sealing a business deal in Dublin. A classy
crowd (including quite a few businesspeople) fills this elegant restaurant,
decorated with browns and golds, to sample star chef Eamonn O’Reilly’s
creations. Like the chefs at the Tea Room, Halo, the Winding Stair, and
Mermaid Café (all reviewed in this section), O’Reilly creates adventurous
dishes with fresh Irish produce, though his menu seems to have more of
a French influence than the menus at those four restaurants. The menu
changes often, featuring such delights as a starter of seared rare tuna with
black sesame seeds, coriander (cilantro) puree, and red onion crème
fraiche, served alongside a fennel, pear, and cucumber salad, and an Irish
Angus beef filet with artichoke puree, boiled asparagus, Pomme Anna
(thinly sliced potatoes layered with butter), and cabernet sauvignon
sauce. Whatever you do, be sure to try the desserts; Cookies & Cream, a
haute re-creation of some of the world’s most beloved cookies, was one of
my recent favorites. The prix-fixe lunch and pretheater deals are excellent,

pretheater dinner.

BAKERY/CAFE
If I lived near this bakery and cafe, I’d weigh about 900 pounds, and that
would be tragic, because then I may not be able to fit through the door to
sample more of their incredible desserts. Savory lunch tarts (such as a
goat cheese, tomato, olive, and pesto combo), salads, sandwiches, and
toothsome homemade soups attended by a thick slice of brown bread are
served in a cheerful, casual yellow room. But the excellent lunch fare is
just the opening act for the glorious desserts, including a tangy blackberry-
and-apple crumble offset by sweet cream that I could eat every day.

Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud
$$$$
Dublin 2
FRENCH
Some of the finest cuisine in Dublin is served in this bright, cream-colored
room, which sports abstract paintings. Dishes combine fresh Irish and
French ingredients with French cooking techniques and pure creativity for
some real stunners, such as the caramelized veal sweetbread glazed with
licorice sauce and parsnip sauce, and served with a lemon confit; and the
roast black sole with Moroccan lemon and curd. Desserts are appropri-
ately complex and impressive; a recent menu listed a plate of five different
cold and hot dark-chocolate confections. The 50 ($80) three-course lunch
is a great deal (relatively speaking of course).

The Tea Room
$$$$
Temple Bar, Dublin 2
NEW IRISH
This is the place in Dublin to try out New Irish cuisine, which uses Ireland’s
bounty of fresh ingredients in imaginative dishes. Expect intriguing options
such as the roast rack of Wicklow lamb marinated in Indian spices and pre-
served lemon, and served with a mixture of natural lamb juices and curry
oil. Housed in the fabulous Clarence Hotel (reviewed earlier in this chap-
ter), the Tea Room has an airy feel, with soaring ceilings, large windows
and blond wood. The new slightly-less-fancy 39 ($62) market menu is

Winding Stair
$$$$
Dublin 2
NEW IRISH
The Winding Stair is the best new restaurant in Dublin, giving you the best
of both worlds: traditional Irish ingredients presented with impeccable
modern cooking skills. The chefs are obsessed with finding the top sources
for their local ingredients, from the Irish Aberdeen beef (which is accom-
panied by sticky onions, garlic butter, and homemade French fries) to the
fromage heaven that greets you on the Irish Cheese Board. And don’t miss
the desserts, especially the unbelievable sticky pear and ginger cake. The
setting is casual and airy, with views over the Liffey River through ceiling-
high windows. You may find yourself elbow-to-elbow with your fellow
patrons, but with the good spirits, laughter, and transcendent food you
should hardly mind.

Yamamori Noodles
$$$
Old City, Dublin 2
NOODLES/JAPANESE
If you’re craving Japanese noodle dishes and soups and a boisterous
atmosphere, Yamamori is your place. In a large, simply furnished space
decorated with white lanterns and a glass panel sandwiching delicate
cherry-blossom-shaped lights, groups of friends talk and laugh over super-
fresh sushi, bowls of delectable ramen big enough to drown in, and other
Japanese dishes, such as wok-fried noodles; rare tuna loin served with a
trio of soba, rice, and green tea noodles; and various teriyaki plates. Try
the sushi hand rolls — cones of delicate seaweed wrapped around warm
vinegary rice and the fresh filling of your choice.

Exploring Dublin
Dublin is packed with things to see and do. An exploration of the city 
is like a journey through history as you discover medieval churches,
Viking ruins, an 18th-century college campus, and museums containing
artifacts such as 3,000-year-old Celtic gold jewelry. Modern Dublin is

evident in sights ranging from a recent portrait of U2 singer Bono in the
National Gallery to a slew of über-trendy shops.
As you explore Dublin, keep an eye out for brass plaques laid into the
ground with passages from James Joyce’s Ulysses that relate to that site.
If you’re in Dublin for a short time, one of the best ways to take in as
many attractions as possible is to use the Hop On Hop Off tour bus. The
bus visits 23 of Dublin’s most popular attractions, and as the name indi-
cates, you can hop off the bus to see an attraction and then pick up
another bus when you’re finished. See the review in “Seeing Dublin by
Guided Tour,” later in this chapter, for more details.
Dublin is relatively compact, but it still makes sense to look at a map and
plan to see attractions in the same area in the same day.
No need to break the bank sightseeing; all the parks in Dublin are free, as
are many other attractions listed here. You can also get combined tick-
ets to some attractions, which could save a few euro (see reviews for
further information).
The Dublin Pass offers a terrific deal. You pay a flat price and get free
admission to tons of Dublin and Dublin-area attractions, plus discounts
on several tours and at some restaurants, shops, and entertainment
venues. The pass even includes a free ride from Dublin Airport to the
center of Dublin City on Aircoach. The one-day pass is 29 ($46) adults
and 17 ($27) for kids younger than 16; a two-day pass is 49 ($78)
adults and 29 ($46) kids younger than 16; a three-day pass is 59 
($94) adults and 34 ($54) kids under age 16; and a six-day pass is 89
($142) adults and 44 ($70) kids under age 16. The pass is available at
any Dublin tourism office (% 01-605-7700), including the office at the
arrivals concourse at Dublin Airport, or at www.dublinpass.com. If you
know that you’re going to do a lot of sightseeing, the Dublin Pass may be
perfect for you.
Families should be aware that most attractions in Dublin and the rest of
Ireland offer family rates — low flat rates that usually cover two adults
and up to four children.
The top attractions
Chester Beatty Library
Dublin 2
The Chester Beatty Library is one of those gems that often gets overlooked
in favor of the more flashy attractions of Dublin. But this extensive col-
lection of books, artwork, manuscripts, and religious objects from around
the world is worth at least a few hours of precious vacation time. On the
first floor, you find an exhibit called Arts of the Book, an awe-inspiring and
diverse collection of ancient books, from Egyptian Books of the Dead to
medieval illuminated manuscripts Narrated videos of craftspeople at work
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
150

are found throughout the gallery, illuminating crafts such as bookbinding,
papermaking, and printmaking. The second floor is dedicated to books
and objects from many of the world’s religious traditions. A beautifully crea-
ted audiovisual explores religious practices and belief systems around 
the world. The treasures on this floor are numerous, including a Hindu cos-
mological painting from 18th-century Nepal; a standing Tibetan Buddha;
and some of the earliest New Testament and Gospel texts, including the
Gospel of St. John, written on Greek papyrus, circa 150 to 200. If you are
spiritually satiated but physically hungry, the Silk Road Café is excellent.

Christ Church Cathedral
Dublin 8
Christ Church Cathedral, an Anglican/Episcopal church, has existed in vari-
ous forms in this spot for almost a thousand years. The Vikings built a
simple wood church at this location in 1038. In the 1180s, the original foun-
dation was expanded into a cruciform, and the Romanesque cathedral was
built in stone. The church you see today is the result of restoration and
rebuilding on the 1180s building during the 1870s. The cathedral provides
an informative self-guided tour brochure when you enter, or you can call to
make reservations for a guided tour. Don’t let all the soaring architecture
and intricate stonework above you distract you from the beautiful 13th-cen-
tury tile floor. On your way to the Peace Chapel of Saint Laud, check out the
mummified rat and cat found in a pipe of the organ in the late 1860s. Also
take time to see the tomb of Strongbow, the Viking leader who captured
Dublin in 1170. Your ticket covers admission to the medieval crypt, which
houses the cathedral’s Treasury. Visitors are welcome at services; just call
ahead for times. Choral services (Wed and Thurs at 6 p.m., Sat at 5 p.m., and
Sun at 11 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.) are especially beautiful. Note that admission is
reduced if you visit Dublinia (reviewed later in this section) first.
See map p. 148. Christ Church Place. % 01-677-8099. www.cccdub.ie. DART: Tara
Street Station. Bus: 49, 50, 65, 77. Admission: 6 ($9.60) adults, 4 ($6.40) students
and seniors, free for children accompanied by a parent. Open: June–Aug daily 9
a.m.–6 p.m. (last admission at 5:30 p.m., and access is limited during services);
Sept–May daily 9:45 a.m.–5 p.m. Suggested visit: 45 minutes.
Dublin Castle
Dublin 2
This is not your typical storybook castle. Originally, it was built in the 13th
century, but many additions were made over the following 800 years.
Today, the castle looks like an encyclopedia of European architectural
styles, from the 13th-century Norman Record Tower to the Church of the
Holy Trinity, designed in 1814 in Gothic style. The castle now hosts official
state functions, such as the president’s inauguration, and the clock tower
Chapter 11: Dublin 151

is home to the excellent Chester Beatty Library (reviewed earlier in this sec-
tion). Guided tours (listed as 50 minutes long, but often extended) take you
through many of the impressively furnished State Apartments, including the
Drawing Room, which features a breathtaking Waterford Crystal chandelier;
the Throne Room, where Queen Victoria ordered servants to lop several
inches off the legs of the throne so that her feet wouldn’t dangle as she spoke
to her subjects; and Patrick’s Hall, which boasts the banners of the Knights
of St. Patrick and historical ceiling paintings. You’ll end up in the moat, gazing
at the original city and castle walls. Art and history lovers alike should appre-
ciate the tour, which focuses on both the aesthetics of the castle and its his-
tory. It would be ideal to read the “History 101” section in Chapter 2 before
your tour if you need to brush up on your Irish history. Don’t miss the
Church of the Holy Trinity, with its beautiful carved oak panels and stained-
glass windows. Note the statue of Justice in the courtyard. See how she faces
away from the city? Cynical Dubliners will tell you that was intentional.
During state occasions, the State Apartments may be closed.

Guinness Storehouse
Dublin 8
Though the actual Guinness Brewery is closed to the public, the Guinness
Storehouse will fill you in on everything you’ve ever wanted to know about
“black gold.” This temple to Guinness is housed in a 1904 building that was
used for the fermentation process — when yeast is added to beer. The core
of the building is a seven-level, pint-shaped structure that could hold
approximately 14.3 million pints of Guinness. The Storehouse explores
every facet of Ireland’s favorite beverage, from the ingredients that go into
each batch to the company’s advertising campaigns to the role of Guinness
in Irish culture. Though there is a sense of unabashed propaganda to the
whole attraction, the exhibits are beautifully done in a cool, modern
design. There is a lot to see, but you’ll definitely want to make time for the
ingredients exhibit, which features a veritable beach of barley and a water-
fall of Irish water; the intriguing audiovisual journey through the Guinness
brewing process; the tasting laboratory (where you get to sample several
different brews); and the fun display of Guinness advertisements through
the years. And don’t bypass the “Start the Brew” section on the first floor,
where 100 lucky visitors per week get to press a button that initiates the
brewing process at the actual Brew House. The top-floor Gravity Bar is (lit-
erally) the Storehouse’s crowning glory, offering 360-degree views of
Dublin through floor-to-ceiling glass walls, and dispensing a free pint of
black stuff to every visitor over the age of 18.

The Ha’Penny Bridge
Dublin 1 and 2
This famous footbridge has connected the north side of the river directly
to Temple Bar since 1816. Its name comes from the half-penny toll that it
once cost to cross the bridge. (The poet W. B. Yeats and others were not
fans of the toll and walked down to O’Connell Bridge to avoid it.) You can’t
miss the bridge — it’s bright white and arches high over the River Liffey,
and at night, it’s festooned with cheerful lights. The bridge offers views up
and down the River Liffey. If you want a view of the Ha’Penny Bridge
stretching over the Liffey, walk to the Millennium Bridge, a shimmery little
Chapter 11: Dublin 153
Exploring Temple Bar
In the 1970s, artists of all kinds began setting up shop in Temple Bar, and the area,
which had hitherto been in decline, became a hotbed for cutting-edge visual and per-
forming arts. Though the 1980s were rough for Temple Bar, the area rallied during the
economic boom of the early 1990s. The result of this boom money is that Temple Bar
is now both bohemian and upscale, much like Manhattan’s SoHo — you can get a gor-
geous one-of-a-kind handmade dress, but it certainly won’t be a bargain.
Temple Bar is especially fun to visit when the Food Market, Book Market, Craft &
Furniture Market, and Cow’s Lane Fashion & Design Market are taking place (see the
“This little traveler went to market” sidebar in the “Shopping in Dublin” section, later
in this chapter).
Check out a few of my favorite spots in Temple Bar (shown in the “Temple Bar” map).

The Gallery of Photography, Meeting House Square (% 01-671-4654), has
a great permanent exhibit of early-20th-century Irish photography and
also puts on excellent temporary exhibits by contemporary Irish and inter-
national photographers.

The Irish Film Institute, 6 Eustace St. (% 01-679-5744), is one of the
hippest places in Dublin, showing a terrific selection of old and inde-
pendent films. The cute cafe there serves the best nachos in Dublin.
During the summer, they project films on an outdoor screen in
Meetinghouse Square on Saturday nights.

Temple Bar Gallery, 5–9 Temple Bar (% 01-671-0073), exhibits new works
by up-and-coming artists.

Project Arts Centre, 39 East Essex St. (% 01-881-9613), presents new and
often avant-garde art exhibits, theater, and dance.
Drop into the Temple Bar Information Centre, 12 East Essex St. (% 01-677-2255;
www.visit-templebar.com) for all sorts of information on Temple Bar, including
the lowdown on the area’s many free outdoor events. The information center is open

and Sunday noon to 3 p.m.

wisp of a bridge directly west of the Ha’Penny. You’ll find a peaceful board-
walk along the north side of the river.
See map p. 138 and 148. Over the River Liffey between O’Connell and Millennium
bridges, across from Liffey Street Lower on the north side. Suggested visit: 
5 minutes.
Kilmainham Gaol
Dublin 8
From the 1780s to the 1920s, many Irish rebels against the British crown
were imprisoned at Kilmainham Gaol (pronounced jail), some for years
and others only for the short period before they met the firing squad. Used
as the set for the 1993 Daniel Day Lewis film In the Name of the Father, the
jail has been restored and offers excellent tours, plus intriguing exhibits
about the political history of Ireland and the fascinating history of the jail.
Peering into the dank cells, you can practically see the figures of the
famous patriots who were imprisoned here, among them Charles Stewart
Parnell, Joseph Plunkett, and James Connolly. A short audiovisual about
the jail and Irish political history is shown in the chapel where Plunkett
was allowed to marry Grace Gifford just hours before being shot for his
part in the 1916 Rising. Perhaps the most haunting part of the tour is the
visit to the stark courtyard where firing squads executed many of the
rebels from the 1916 Rising, including Connolly, who was so badly injured
during the fighting that he couldn’t stand up by himself and had to be
strapped into a chair to be shot.

Merrion Square
Dublin 2
This is my favorite of Dublin’s parks. Thick with old trees and brilliant,
splashy flowers during the warm months, Merrion Square’s park is filled
with little nooks and paths that make it seem many times larger than it is.
Take one path, and you’re walking in a lush, dense forest filled with bird-
song; make a turn, and there’s a sun-dappled field with school kids kicking
around a soccer ball; turn again, and you’re greeted by a couple picnick-
ing on a bench in a formal garden area. Lining the square are textbook
Georgian row houses, characterized by their brightly painted doors, ele-
gant brass door knockers, and fanlights — half-moon-shaped windows over
the doors. Around the square are plaques that identify the former homes
of poet W. B. Yeats (no. 82), playwright Oscar Wilde (no. 1), and Catholic
liberator Daniel O’Connell (no. 58). On Sundays, some of the city’s top
artists hang their works for sale from the rails surrounding the square.

Gallery. Take Nassau Street on the south side of Trinity College and continue east

The National Gallery
Dublin 2
This fine collection of Western European art (mostly paintings) from the
Middle Ages through the 20th century is often overlooked by visitors plan-
ning their itineraries in Dublin, which is a shame, because the collection is
varied and interesting. The museum has an extensive collection of Irish
works from the 18th century through today and boasts 17th-century treas-
ures such as Caravaggio’s The Taking of Christ, Vermeer’s Lady Writing a
Letter, and Rembrandt’s Rest on a Flight Into Egypt. A gem of the museum is
a large room (no. 21) devoted to the works of the Yeats family, with a focus
on the mystical, vivid paintings of Jack Yeats (brother of W. B.). The star of
the Portrait Gallery just may be a recent portrait of U2 singer Bono, by
Louis le Brocquy. The minimalist cafe is a great spot to rest your museum-
weary feet and indulge in a cup of sweet hot chocolate. If you’re in the
museum on Saturday or Sunday, take advantage of the free guided tours.

National Museum of Archaeology & History
Dublin 2
This grand museum, featuring a huge rotunda and beautiful mosaics, is
home to many of Ireland’s most dazzling and important artifacts from 7000
B.C. through the medieval period. The stars of the museum’s collection are
in The Treasury, where you find the gorgeous Tara Brooch and Ardagh
Chalice, plus masterpieces of craftsmanship from Ireland’s Iron Age; and
in Ireland’s Gold, where elegant gold ornaments dating from 7000 to 2000
B.C. are displayed. The ancient gold torque necklaces are especially stun-
ning. The other exhibits, including Prehistoric Ireland, The Road to
Independence (featuring uniforms and other objects from the nationalist
struggle of the early 20th century), Viking Ireland, Medieval Ireland, and
the somewhat-out-of-place Ancient Egypt also boast interesting and beau-
tifully presented objects. Be sure to check out the well-preserved human
bodies from the Iron Age unearthed in 2003.

Chapter 11: Dublin 155

St. Patrick’s Cathedral
Dublin 8
St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the national cathedral of the Church of Ireland,
derives its name from the belief that in the fifth century, St. Patrick bap-
tized converts to Christianity in a well that once existed on this land.
Though there have been churches on this spot since the fifth century, the
glorious church that stands today was built in the early 13th century, with
restorations to the west tower in 1370 and the addition of a spire in 1749.
Volunteers provide an informative map pamphlet that guides you through
the church, explaining the highlights of the interior. You can visit the
moving memorial of author and social critic Jonathan Swift, who served
as the dean of the cathedral and is buried next to his beloved friend Stella;
and pay your respects to the monument of Turlough O’Carolan (1670–
1738), one of Ireland’s finest and most prolific harpers and bards, who
composed many tunes that are still played by Irish musicians today. Don’t
miss the choir, which is adorned with colorful medieval banners and hel-
mets. Beautiful matins (Sept–June Mon–Fri 9:40 a.m.) and evensongs
(Mon–Fri 5:45 p.m. and Sun 3:15 p.m.) are sung here. Your ticket includes
admission to Living Stones, an exhibit that uses objects to explore the
cathedral’s place in history and in the world today.

St. Stephen’s Green and Newman House
Dublin 2
Sitting in this beautiful, centrally located park on a sunny Saturday, you’ll
probably see about half of Dublin’s population promenading by, pushing
strollers, lugging shopping bags, munching on sandwiches, and so on. The
11 hectare (27-acre) park encompasses several different landscapes, from
a large duck pond shaded by the trailing leaves of a weeping willow to for-
mally laid-out flower gardens to open green spaces that beg you to settle
down for a picnic. During the summer months, you can enjoy the frequent
lunchtime concerts. Newman House, on the south side of the green, was
once home to the Catholic University of Ireland. You can take a guided tour
of the house, which is filled with some gorgeous examples of Georgian fur-
niture and interior design, including the finest in 18th-century plasterwork.
See map p. 148. St. Stephen’s Green takes up the block at the top of Grafton Street;
Newman House is located at 85–86 St. Stephen’s Green, between Harcourt Street
and Earlsfort Terrace. Take Grafton Street away from Trinity College. % 01-716-7422.

Trinity College and the Book of Kells
Dublin 2
Trinity College, founded in 1592 by Elizabeth I, looks like the ideal of an
impressive, refined, old-world college, with Georgian stone buildings and
perfectly manicured green lawns. The campus sits in the middle of the
busy city, but within its gates, everything is composed and quiet. As you
enter the main gate, look to your left to see the cross-denominational
Christian chapel. Directly opposite, on your right, is the college exam hall.
If you’re passing through during exam time, you may see students sprint-
ing from chapel to exam hall, having just offered up a prayer for a good
mark. On your left, next to the chapel, is the dining hall. As you wander
the cobbled paths around Trinity, you can imagine the days when former
students Oscar Wilde, Samuel Beckett, Jonathan Swift, and Bram Stoker (a
great athlete at Trinity) pounded the same pavement on their way to class.
During nice weather, students lounge on the well-kept greens or on
benches for picnics or studying. There is nothing finer than taking a picnic
lunch (try fish and chips from Beshoff, reviewed earlier in this chapter, in
the “Dining in Dublin” section) to Trinity’s little hidden garden or cricket
and rugby pitch (walk past the Old Library, and make a right at the pretty
little garden with benches).
The jewel in Trinity College’s crown is the Book of Kells along with its
attending exhibit, housed in the Old Library. This manuscript of the four
gospels of the Bible was painstakingly crafted by monks around A.D. 800.
The gospels are written in ornate Latin script, and the book is filled with
stunning, vivid illustrations, including intricate Celtic knots and fantastical
animals. The engaging exhibit that leads to the Book of Kells (and three
other ancient Irish religious texts) explains the historical context in which
the books were created and reveals the techniques used in the creation of
the books. You get to see only one page of the Book of Kells on each visit
(they turn a page each day).
You may be tempted to turn around and leave the exhibit after you’ve seen
the Book of Kells. Don’t. Instead, go upstairs to the Long Room, which has
gallery bookcases filled with Trinity’s oldest books and is lined with
marble busts of dead white men (I mean that in the most affectionate way),
from Shakespeare to Swift. This room, used as a model for the Hogwarts
dining hall in the Harry Potter movies, also boasts the oldest known harp
in Ireland, made of oak and willow.
Finally, if you’re a science lover, check out the new Science Gallery (see
description on p. 162 while you’re on the Trinity campus.

More cool things to see and do
The following sections list other great attractions in Dublin, including
churches, museums, and historic buildings.
More landmarks and historic buildings
 General Post Office: The bullet holes scarring the pillars of the
General Post Office (GPO) testify to the violent battle between Irish
patriots (also called Republicans) and English forces during the
Easter Rising of 1916. The Republicans commandeered the build-
ing, and leader Pádraig Pearse read the Proclamation of the Irish
Republic from the front steps. The patriots held their ground for a
week before shelling from the British forces drove them to surren-
der. Thirteen of the Republican leaders were executed shortly
thereafter, and the interior of the post office was burned to the
ground. Rebuilt in 1929, this is now Dublin’s main post office.
Inside, an evocative series of paintings depicting the 1916 Rising —
a visual history lesson — used to grace the walls. The paintings
have been taken down for cleaning and the post office staff is not
sure if they will be rehung or if they will be moved to a new loca-
tion. However, you will still find a statue of the ancient mythic Irish
hero Cuchulainn, dedicated to those who died during the Rising.
Location: North of the River Liffey, halfway up the left side of
O’Connell Street, Dublin 1 (see map p. 148). % 01-705-8600.
Admission: Free. Open: Monday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 
8 p.m. Suggested visit: Ten minutes.
 Glasnevin Cemetery: This primarily Catholic cemetery, founded in
1832, is the final resting place of many famous Irish citizens, includ-
ing political heroes Michael Collins and Charles Stewart Parnell and
playwright Brendan Behan. There are many stunning Celtic crosses
throughout the cemetery. There’s a heritage map that lists who is
buried where (pick one up at the visitor center), and the guided
walking tour is filled with interesting information that gives a face
to many parts of Irish history.
Location: Finglas Road (see map p. 165). % 01-830-1133. www.
glasnevin-cemetery.ie. Bus: 19, 19A, or 13 (from O’Connell
Street to Harts Corner, a five-minute walk from the cemetery) or 40,
40A, 40B, or 40C (from Parnell Street to the main cemetery entrance).
Admission: Free entry and tours. Open: Daily from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Tours meet at the main entrance of the cemetery at 2:30 p.m. on
Wednesday and Friday. Suggested visit: An hour or two.
 James Joyce Statue: This statue pays homage to the wiry, bespec-
tacled man whose inspired words have become the essence of
Dublin in the “auld times.”
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
158

Location: Halfway up O’Connell Street, just at the top of Earl Street
North, Dublin 1 (see map p. 148). Suggested visit: A few seconds,
unless you decide to recite a sentence or two from Finnegan’s
Wake, which could take a month.
 The Millennium Spire: This 120m (394-ft.) high spike of stainless
steel is meant to represent 21st-century Dublin. The spire replaces
Nelson’s Pillar, which was erected during the British occupation of
Ireland.
Location: O’Connell Street, Dublin 1 (in front of the main post
office; see map p. 148). Suggested visit: Time enough to gaze up in
vertiginous awe and snap a photo.
 Molly Malone Statue: Sing along, now: “In Dublin’s fair city, where
the girls are so pretty, there once was a girl named sweet Molly
Malone . . .” Inspired by the traditional song “Cockles and Mussels,”
this statue is a tribute to the fictional Molly Malone, who repre-
sents all the women who hawked their wares on Dublin’s busy
streets in the past. Affectionately known as “The Tart with the
Cart,” Molly welcomes shoppers at the head of Grafton Street.
Location: Corner of Nassau and Grafton streets (see map p. 148).
Suggested visit: About 30 seconds, unless you take time to sing the
whole song.
More museums
 Dublinia & Viking World: Try on some chain mail, rummage
through the apothecary’s drawers to find a cure for what ails you,
and sniff through the spice merchant’s wares at the Medieval Fayre,
one of several exhibits at Dublinia, a hands-on museum that illus-
trates life in medieval Dublin from 1170 to 1540. Though the wall
text is comprehensive and geared to adults, kids older than 4 or 5
should enjoy the activities and the walk-through scenes. Kids and
adults alike will likely be intrigued by the medieval artifacts found
during excavations in Dublin. A recently opened exhibit on the top
floor explores the life and history of the Vikings through objects and
text. Be warned that the museum is a bit tattered around the edges
(parts are missing from some exhibits and so on), and that overlap-
ping audio explanations can make the experience a loud one.
Location: St. Michael’s Hill, High Street (next to Christ Church; see
map p. 148). % 01-679-4611. www.dublinia.ie. Bus: 49, 50, 65, 77.
Admission: 6.25 ($10) adults, 5.25 ($8.40) students, 5 ($8) sen-
iors, 3.75 ($6) children 5 and over, free for children under 5. Open:
April through September daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (last admission is
4:15 p.m.), October through March Monday to Friday 11 a.m. to 4
p.m. (last admission 3:15 p.m.), Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (last
admission at 3:15 p.m.). Suggested visit: One and a half hours.
 Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane: Travelers who enjoy contem-
porary and modern art should pay a visit to this recently renovated
and expanded museum. The museum features an interesting and
Chapter 11: Dublin 159

varied collection, including many works by Irish artists. Some of
my favorite pieces are Eve of Saint Agnes, a stained glass master-
piece with more shades of blue than I thought possible, Renoir’s
Les Parapluies, and paintings by Jack B. Yeats and Louis le Brocquy.
Check to see if the museum is hosting any temporary exhibits, and
don’t miss Francis Bacon’s studio, which has been reconstructed
on-site in the museum.

Tuesday through Thursday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Friday and Saturday
10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Suggested visit:
Forty-five minutes.
 Dublin’s City Hall: The Story of the Capital: Located in Dublin’s
beautiful city hall, this exhibit gives a good overview of Dublin his-
tory through audiovisuals, text, and objects. Even if you decide not
to go to the exhibit, the rotunda, featuring frescoes representing
the early history of Dublin, is worth a peek.
Location: Dame Street near Dublin Castle (see map p. 148). % 01-
222-2204. Bus: 56A, 77, 77A, 123. Admission: 4 ($6.40) adults, 2
($3.20) seniors and students, 1.50 ($2.40) children. Open: Monday
to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5:15 p.m., Sunday from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.
Suggested visit: Forty-five minutes.
 Dublin Writers Museum: Who said to U.S. Customs officials: “I have
nothing to declare — except my genius?” That would be witty
Oscar Wilde. Wilde’s life and literature are presented at this
museum, along with the biographies, works, personal effects, let-
ters, and portraits and photographs of Ireland’s literary luminaries
from ancient times through the 20th century. Exhaustive and inter-
esting text on the walls relates the biographies of the writers and
explains Ireland’s literary movements. If you’re lacking time, you
can just read the two- or three-line summary posted at the bottom
of the text panel. The audio tour gives brief descriptions of the
writers and includes snippets of text read by actors and music
appropriate to the display that you’re looking at (don’t be cowed
by the listening device; it takes everyone a few minutes to master
it). Lectures, actors portraying writers, readings, and children’s
programs are on offer (call for details). You can contemplate the
words of the literary giants over a snack in the tranquil Zen Garden
or have a complete meal at the museum’s restaurant (see Chapter
1), which was recently named the best restaurant in Dublin by the
hip magazine The Dubliner. Kids under 14 or so will probably be
bored at this museum. If you’d like to hear the words of the great
writers spoken by an Irish actor, get tickets at the museum for The
Writers Entertain, a one-man performance. Shows start at 1:10 p.m.
every day during July and August.

Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; September to
May, Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from
11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Suggested visit: Two hours if you want to read all
the text, 45 minutes if you want to zip through.
 Irish Museum of Modern Art: Sitting grandly at the end of a tree-
lined lane, this is one of Ireland’s most magnificent 17th-century
buildings, built in 1680 as a hospital for injured soldiers. The build-
ing is so impressive that when it was finished, many lobbied to use
it as the campus for Trinity College. Be sure to check out the
Baroque chapel, with its wood carvings and stained glass. The per-
manent collection includes an exciting array of Irish and interna-
tional works, and the museum hosts frequent temporary
exhibitions.
Location: Military Road, Kilmainham, Dublin 8 (see map p. 148). 
% 01-612-9900. www.modernart.ie. Bus: 26, 51, 79, 123. Admission:
Free. Open: Tuesday and Thursday through Saturday from 10 a.m.
to 5:30 p.m., Wednesday from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Sunday from
noon to 5:30 p.m. Suggested visit: One hour.
 James Joyce Centre: “The supreme question about a work of art is
out of how deep a life does it spring?” writes James Joyce in
Ulysses. Joyce fans can begin to plumb the depths of the writer’s
life at this museum, which features a recreation of Joyce’s bed-
room, the original door from Joyce’s Dublin home, portraits of the
Joyce family, interactive displays about each of the writer’s books,
and a comprehensive library and archives. Walking tours of Joyce’s
Dublin are offered Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday at 11 a.m. and
2 p.m. (10/$16 adults; 8/$13 students and seniors). Though I
enjoy many of the displays, this museum often leaves me wanting
more — more exhibits, more depth in the exhibits, and more ways
to know about Joyce’s life and works.
Location: 35 N. Great George’s St., Dublin 1 (see map p. 148). 
% 01-878-8547. www.jamesjoyce.ie. Bus: 123. Admission: 5 ($8)
adults, 4 ($6.40) seniors, students, and children under 10. Open:
Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Suggested visit:
One hour.
 The National Museum of Decorative Arts and History (Collins
Barracks): This well-designed museum, housed in 18th-century
army barracks, exhibits some of Ireland’s finest decorative objects.
Galleries are organized by theme — Scientific Instruments, Irish
Period Furniture, Irish Silver, and so on — and feature engaging
descriptions of the history of the various items. My favorite exhibit
is the Curator’s Choice, which comprises 25 diverse objects chosen
by the museum’s curators because of the intriguing stories that
they tell. Fashion buffs won’t want to miss “The Way We Wore,” an
exhibit displaying Irish fashions over the past 250 years.
Chapter 11: Dublin 161

 Old Jameson Distillery: Take an interesting guided tour through
part of Jameson’s now-unused Bow Street distillery. You can watch
a short film about Irish whiskey and follow the life of this spirit
from raw materials through distillation to finished product. The
tour finishes off with a blind whiskey tasting for a lucky handful of
volunteers and a dram of Jameson’s for all other visitors of legal
age. On the bottom floor of the distillery, keep an eye out for
Smithy the cat, who kept the distillery mouse-free. The Distillery
store sells all kinds of Jameson whiskeys and whiskey products,
including some addictive whiskey fudge.

Admission: Free. Open: Tues–Sun noon to 6 p.m.
More parks (And a zoo!)
 Garden of Remembrance: This small, peaceful park is dedicated to
the men and women who died in pursuit of Irish freedom from
British rule during the 1916 uprising. Near the entrance is a still
reflecting pool with a mosaic at its bottom depicting broken
weapons — symbols of peace. Farther back, the large statue near
the fountain portrays the myth of the Children of Lir, who were
turned into swans by their selfish and cruel stepmother. The park’s
location is significant — it is where several leaders of the 1916
Easter rebellion were held overnight before being taken to
Kilmainham Gaol and put to death.
Location: The north end of Parnell Square at the top of O’Connell
Street, Dublin 1 (see map p. 148). Open: Daily during daylight
hours. Admission: Free. Suggested visit: Fifteen minutes.
 Phoenix Park and Dublin Zoo: This is Europe’s largest enclosed
city park — five times the size of London’s Hyde Park. You can
drive through it, but if the weather’s nice, don’t pass up the chance
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
162

to walk, because Phoenix Park is more than just a green spot for
picnic lunches: Enclosed within it are the homes of Ireland’s presi-
dent and the U.S. ambassador. The Zoological Gardens is the
world’s third-oldest zoo and houses a wide variety of animals, from
lions to red pandas. Other sights include the Papal Cross, where
Pope John Paul II said Mass to a million Irish in 1979, and Ashton
Castle, a 17th-century tower house that’s now the visitors’ center.
Originally a deer park, the area is still home to many deer.
Location: Park Gate, Conyngham Road; Phoenix Park Visitor Centre,
Dublin 8 (see map p. 148). Visitor Centre % 01-677-0095; Zoological
Park % 01-677-1425. To the Park: Bus 37, 38, or 39 to Ashtown
Cross Gate. To the Zoo: Bus 10, 10A, 25, 26, or 66. Admission: Free to

under 16, free for kids under 3. The park is open all day every day.
The zoo is open Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Closes at sunset in winter. Last
admission is one hour before closing. Suggested visit: Two and a
half hours.
More cathedrals and churches
 St. Ann’s Anglican Church: In this church, the writer of the creepy
novel Dracula, Bram Stoker, married Florence Balcombe, witty play-
wright and Oscar Wilde’s first love. Wolfe Tone, the famous rebel,
was also married here. Highlights are the gorgeous stained-glass
windows and ornate plasterwork.
Location: Dawson Street, Dublin 2 (see map p. 148). % 01-676-
7727. www.stannschurch.ie. DART: Tara Street Station. Bus: 10,
11A, 11B, 13, 20B. Admission: Free. Open: Monday through Friday
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Suggested visit: Thirty minutes.
 St. Audoen’s Church: There are actually two churches of the same
name off of Cook Street, but you’re looking for the smaller and
older of the two. St. Audoen’s is situated right next to the only
remaining gate of the Old City, which was built in 1214. The only
surviving medieval church in Dublin, St. Audoen’s features a door-
way from 1190; a 13th-century nave; and three of the oldest church
bells in Ireland, cast in 1423. A nicely done exhibit explains the his-
tory of the church, and tour guides who take you through the
church itself really know their stuff.
Location: Cornmarket (off High Street; see map p. 148). % 01-677-
0088. Admission: Free. Open: June through October daily from 9:30
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (last entry and tour at 4:45 p.m.). Suggested visit:
Forty minutes.
 St. Michan’s Church: Unless you plan to make your next vacation a
tour of the ancient pyramids, this may be your best chance to see
actual mummies. It’s hard to believe, but the combination of cool
temperatures, dry air, and methane gas at this location preserves
bodies, and the vaults below the church contain the remains of
Chapter 11: Dublin 163

such people as Henry and John Sheares, leaders of the Rebellion of
1798, and a crusader. The church itself is also worth a look, boast-
ing an organ believed to have been played by Handel, and detailed
wood carvings of instruments above the choir area. Call before
going, as the church can occasionally be closed without notice.
Location: Church Street, Dublin 7 (see map p. 148). % 01-872-4154.
DART: Tara Street Station. Bus: 34, 70, or 80. Admission: 4 ($6.40)
adults, 3.50 ($5.60) seniors and students, 3 ($4.80) children

through Friday from 12:30 to 3:30 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to
12:45 p.m.. Suggested visit: Thirty minutes.
Green on green: Dublin’s top golfing spots
Check out Chapter 4 for a countrywide golf itinerary, or enjoy these
courses near Dublin. Try to reserve your tee time at least one day in
advance.
 Portmarnock: This links course has been home to several major
championships. It’s a natural golf course, incorporating the rugged
landscape of the region rather than being purpose-built.
Location: Portmarnock, County Dublin (see map p. 165). % 01-
846-2968. www.portmarnockgolfclub.ie. Par: 72. Fees: 180
($288) weekdays, 215 ($344) weekends. Visitors welcome every
day except Wednesday.
 Royal Dublin: Situated on manmade North Bull Island in Dublin
Bay, only 6.4km (4 miles) from the center of Dublin, this is a cham-
pionship course that has offered exciting play amid great scenery
for more than 100 years. The links are located along the seaside.
Location: North Bull Island, Doillymount, Dublin 3 (see map p. 165).
% 01-833-6346. www.theroyaldublingolfclub.com. Par: 72.
Fees: 170 ($272) every day. Visitors welcome every day except
Wednesday.
 St. Margaret’s: One of the hosts of the Irish Open, this is a rela-
tively new, challenging, and exciting inland course of the highest
standard, with an infamously difficult finishing hole.
Location: Stephubble, St. Margaret’s, County Dublin (see map 
p. 165). % 01-864-0400. www.stmargaretsgolf.com. Par: 73. Fees:
50 ($80) Monday, 60 ($96) Tuesday through Thursday, and 80
($128) Friday through Sunday. There is an early-bird special of 35

Attractions around County Dublin
Chapter 11: Dublin 165

Attractions a little out of town
Dublin Bus (% 01-873-4222) runs two great tours that cover the outly-
ing areas of Dublin. The North Coast and Castle Tour travels north and
covers the fishing villages of Dublin Bay, the coastline, and Malahide
Castle. It leaves at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. daily. The South Coast & Gardens
Tour covers the port towns of Dun Laoghaire and beautiful Dalkey,
Killiney Bay, Powerscourt Gardens, and the Wicklow Mountains. It leaves
at 11 a.m. daily. Tours depart from 59 Upper O’Connell St., Dublin 1.
Prices for both are 25 ($40) adult, 12 ($19) children 5 to 14, free for
children under 5. Call for reservations.
Wild Wicklow Tours (p. 203) and Mary Gibbons tours (p. 192) are excel-
lent ways to see Wicklow and Meath, respectively.
Check the “Attractions Around County Dublin” map for the location of
these sights.
 James Joyce Tower and Museum: This tower was made famous in
the first scene of Ulysses, in which Joyce has his main character,
Stephen Dedalus, stay here with the character Buck Mulligan.
Located on a rocky beach in the quaint town of Sandycove, the
tower was built, along with 11 others, in 1804 as protection against
a possible invasion by Napoleon. Joyce actually did stay in the
tower with his friend Oliver St. John Gogarty (who inspired the fic-
tional Mulligan) at the start of the century, and now the place is
officially known as Joyce Tower. It houses such Joycean effects as
letters, a walking stick, and a cigar case. Lovers of Joyce and
Ulysses will have a great time here; less enthusiastic fans may be
disappointed by the small size of the exhibit and may want to stick
to the James Joyce Centre (reviewed in “More cool things to see
and do,” earlier in this chapter).
Location: Sandycove (see map p. 165). % 01-280-9265. DART:
Sandycove Station. Bus: 8. Admission: 7.25 ($12) adults, 6.10
($9.80) students and seniors, 4.55 ($7.30) children under 12.
Open: April through September Monday through Saturday from 
10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from 2 to 6 p.m.
Other times by arrangement. Suggested visit: One hour.
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
166
DART out of town
I love the DART train (see p. 128). It’s inexpensive, runs very frequently, and takes you
through the pretty countryside surrounding Dublin. In the mood for a little seaside
jaunt? Spend a handful of euro and end up in the charming town of Greystones. Want
to have a look at Ireland’s finest racing horses? Hop on the DART and head out to
Kildare. See Chapters 12 and 13 for more about the areas surrounding Dublin City.

 Malahide Castle: This castle was witness to the longevity of one of
Ireland’s great and wealthy families, the Talbots, who resided here
from 1185 to 1973. The architecture of the house is varied, and
period furniture adorns the rooms. There’s a large collection of
Irish portraits, many from the National Gallery. The Great Hall
chronicles the Talbots with portraits of family members. One tragic
legend tells of the morning of the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, when
14 members of the family shared a last meal; by the end of the
battle, all had been killed. The grounds are spectacular; be sure to
check out the Botanic Gardens. Kids will have a great time at the
Fry Model Railway Museum (see the next review), located on the
castle grounds.
Location: Malahide (see map p. 165). % 01-846-2184. Irish Rail:
Malahide Station from Connolly Station. Bus: 42. Admission: 7.25
($12) adults, 6.10 ($9.80) seniors and students, 4.55 ($7.30) chil-
dren under 12; combined tickets available with Fry Model Railway
Museum (see next review). Open: April through September, Monday 
through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from 10 a.m. to 
6 p.m.; October through March, Monday through Friday from 
10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Suggested visit: 
One and a half hours.
 Fry Model Railway Museum: Located on the grounds of Malahide
Castle (see the previous review), the Fry Model Railway Museum
will entertain kids of all ages. This unique collection of handmade
trains spans the history of train travel in Ireland and runs over an
area covering over 230 sq. m (2,500 sq. ft.), with stations, bridges,
trams, buses, and a mini representation of the River Liffey. The col-
lection was assembled by railway engineer Cyril Fry during the
1920s and 1930s.
Location: Malahide Castle (see map p. 165). % 01-846-3779. Irish
Rail: Malahide Station from Connolly Station. Bus: 42. Admission:
7.25 ($12) adults, 6.10 ($9.80) seniors and students, 4.55
($7.30) children under 12; combined tickets available for castle and
museum. Open: April through September, Monday through Tuesday
and Thursday and Saturday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.,
Sunday from 1 to 5 p.m. Suggested visit: One hour.
 National Botanic Gardens: With a huge plant collection (more than
20,000 species) this is a must for anyone who has a green thumb
(or aspires to have one). Highlights include a rose garden, an alpine
area, and an arboretum. The huge greenhouses (called glass houses
in Ireland) shelter tropical plants and other exotic species.
Location: Glasnevin, Dublin 9 (see map p. 165). % 01-837-7596.
Bus: 13, 19, 134. Admission: Free. Open: Mid-February through 
mid-November daily 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; mid-November through mid-
February daily 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Suggested visit: Forty-five 
minutes.
Chapter 11: Dublin 167

 Newbridge House and Park: Walking around Dublin, you see
plenty of examples of Georgian exteriors, but here’s your chance to
see a fine Georgian interior. Each gorgeous room in the manor
house features original furniture and objects. The extensive park
grounds are home to a kid-friendly animal farm.
Location: Donabate (see map p. 165). % 01-843-6534. Irish Rail:

Sunday from noon to 6 p.m.; October through March, Saturday and
Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. Suggested visit: One and a half hours.
Seeing Dublin by guided tour
If you want something more independent than the guided tours listed
below, check out one of the Dublin Tourism Board’s many self-guided
tours of the city. Examples include the Georgian Trail, which covers five
18th-century squares, surrounded by period homes; the Viking and
Medieval Trail, concentrating on the medieval area of Dublin; and the In
the Steps of Ulysses route, which follows the steps of Joyce’s famous
character. Maps and guides are available at the Dublin Tourism Board
on Suffolk Street, and online at www.visitdublin.com (enter “self-
guided tours” in the search feature). Tours are also available from the
tourism board as iWalks, free podcasts for your iPod. Download by visit-
ing www.visitdublin.com (enter “Podcasts” in the search feature).
Give yourself an afternoon for each tour.
Dublin Literary Pub Crawl
Literature has never been more fun! Two excellent Irish actors perform
humorous tidbits by Dublin’s best-known writers as they guide you to pubs
of literary fame and other interesting stops. You’ll be laughing hysterically
by the end of the tour — and not just because of the numerous pints
you’ve consumed. Yes, there will be a quiz at the end (with prizes), so pay
attention. If you haven’t gotten your tickets at the tourist office on Suffolk
Street, you should arrive at the Duke Pub at least half an hour before the
tour begins to ensure a spot. For small groups who want more literature
and less libations, a new Literary Walk (without the pubs) is being offered
by advance reservation (call % 01-87-263-0270).
Tours leave from Duke Pub, at 9 Duke St., off Grafton. Purchase tickets at the tourist
office on Suffolk Street (% 01-670-5602). www.dublinpubcrawl.com. Price: 12
($19) adults, 10 ($16) students. Tours run Apr–Oct every evening at 7:30 p.m., plus Sun
at noon; Nov–Mar Thurs–Sun at 7:30 p.m., Sun noon. The crawl lasts just over 2 hours.
Historical Walking Tours of Dublin
Walk this way for an interesting historical look at the city and at Ireland at
large. On the Original Tour, nicknamed the “Seminar on the Street,” Trinity
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
168

history students and graduates give a relatively in-depth account of Irish
history as they guide you to some of the city’s most famous sites, includ-
ing Trinity, the Old Parliament House, Dublin Castle, City Hall, Christ
Church, and Temple Bar. This tour is likely to thrill history buffs and
anyone interested in the details of Irish history, but it may bore anyone
looking for short anecdotes. During the summer, the company adds 
several special tours, including Piety, Penance & Potatoes, a sexual his-
tory of Ireland; The Gorgeous Mask, a look at architecture and society; 
and A Terrible Beauty, a tour focusing on the birth of the Irish state
(1916–1923).
Leaves from the front gate of Trinity College on College Street, Dublin. Information:
% 01-878-0227. www.historicalinsights.ie. Price: 12 ($19) adults, 10
($16) students, seniors, and children. Original Tours: May–Sept daily at 11 a.m. and
3 p.m.; Apr and Oct daily at 11 a.m.; Nov–Mar Fri–Sun at 11 a.m. Special tours:
May–Sept daily (call to see which days and at what time each special tour runs).
Hop On Hop Off Bus Tours
I highly recommend this tour, which is perfect if you want some guidance
but also want the freedom to take as much time as you want checking out
the sights. Pretty much every attraction the city has to offer is at one of the
bus stops, and there’s commentary throughout. The tour takes one and a
quarter hours if you just ride the bus straight through, but your bus ticket
is valid for 24 hours and you can (and should!), as the name says, hop on
and hop off, stretching the tour out to a whole day. Some attractions offer
discounts for people taking this tour.
All tours leave from Dublin Bus, 59 Upper O’Connell St., Dublin 1, but you can join the
tour at any stop. % 01-873-4222. www.dublinbus.ie. Price: 15 ($24) adults, 13
($21) students and seniors, 6 ($9.60) children under 14. Bus runs daily 9:30 a.m.–6:30
p.m. (A bus stops at each stop every 10 minutes from 9:30 a.m.–3 p.m., every 15 min-
utes from 3–5:30 p.m., and every 30 minutes from 5–6:30 p.m.)
Traditional Irish Musical Pub Crawl
This pub crawl is a fabulous experience for anyone even remotely inter-
ested in Irish music. Two excellent musicians guide you from pub to pub,
regaling you with Irish tunes and songs; cracking many a joke; and filling
you in on the instruments used in Irish music, the history of the music,
and the various types of tunes and songs. The musicians who present this
tour care deeply about Irish music and create an experience that is as
authentic as possible. Get thee to the Temple Bar Information Centre (12
E. Essex St.), the phone, or the Internet to order tickets, or show up early
at the pub to assure yourself of a spot on the tour.

Viking Splash Tours
Two things make this 75-minute tour stand out from the competition: First,
you’re riding around in a World War II amphibious vehicle (called a duck)
that at one point leaves the normal tourist trail to sail along the Grand
Canal. Second, the Viking theme doesn’t just color the historical informa-
tion related along the tour; all riders are given Viking helmets and encour-
aged to roar at “rival” tour groups. Kids, I promise, will not be bored.
Half of the tours leave from Bull Alley beside the gardens of St. Patrick’s Cathedral,
around the corner from the tour’s ticket office and gift store at 64–65 Patrick St, Dublin
8. The other half of the tours leave from St. Stephen’s Green. % 01-707-6000.
www.vikingsplash.com. Price: 20 ($32) adult, 18 ($29) students and seniors,
10 ($16) children under 13 (higher prices apply June–Aug). Runs daily every 11⁄2
hours 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Call if you wish to take a tour Nov–Mar, as times will vary.
Suggested one-, two-, and three-day 
sightseeing itineraries
If you just have one day and really want to pack the sightseeing in, I rec-
ommend taking the Hop On Hop Off Bus Tour (see the preceding sec-
tion with that title) so that you can see as many attractions as possible
in the most efficient way.
Take in Trinity College and the Book of Kells (see the listing in the “The
top attractions” section, earlier in the chapter) first, and then wander
around the excellent shopping areas of Grafton Street and Nassau Street.
Grab lunch at Beshoff (see the previous “Dublin’s Top Restaurants A to
Z”) or Nude (covered in the earlier “Lunch on the move” section), and
picnic in Merrion Square or St. Stephen’s Green (see “The top attrac-
tions”). In the afternoon, visit the nearby National Museum and National
Gallery (both in the preceding “The top attractions” section).
Treat yourself to a delicious dinner at the Winding Stair (listed in
“Dublin’s Top Restaurants A to Z,” earlier in the chapter) before meeting
up with the Traditional Irish Musical Pub Crawl, outlined in the previ-
ous “Seeing Dublin by guided tour” section. If you’re still craving more
traditional music after the pub crawl, end your day at the Cobblestone
(see the “Traditional Irish music venues” section, later in the chapter).
If you have two days, follow the itinerary for day one. On the morning of
the second day, take the Historical Walking Tour (see the earlier
“Seeing Dublin by guided tour” section). Then head over to the Chester
Beatty Library (in the preceding “The top attractions” section) to gaze
at the gorgeous books and art housed within.
Eat lunch in one of the pubs recommended in the “Pub grub” section
and then head out to see St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Dublin Castle, and the
Guinness Storehouse (all outlined in the “The top attractions” section).
Drop into the Queen of Tarts (see the listing in “Dublin’s Top Restaurants 
A to Z”) for an afternoon treat on your way back to Temple Bar.
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
170

Stroll the Grafton Street area, and have dinner at L’Gueuleton (listed in
the “Dublin’s Top Restaurants A to Z” section) before joining up with 
the Literary Pub Crawl (outlined in the “Seeing Dublin by guided tour”
section).
If you have three days, follow the itineraries for days one and two. On your
third day, after breakfast, make your way to the north side of the River
Liffey, and walk up O’Connell Street., stopping to take pictures of the monu-
ments lining the street and picking up a few pieces of fruit on Moore Street.
Get your fill of literary Dublin with a visit to the James Joyce Centre
and the Dublin Writers Museum, which has a great little cafe for lunch.
(Both are listed in the “More museums” section.)
After lunch, head over the Ha’Penny Bridge to take the guided tour of
Dublin Castle (both described in “The top attractions”), then walk over
to Temple Bar to leisurely explore the shops, galleries, and pubs. You
may want to indulge in dinner at the Tea Room (listed in the “Dublin’s
Top Restaurants A to Z” section) before heading off to see a show at the
famous Abbey Theatre, described in the upcoming “Checking out
Dublin’s excellent theater scene” section.
Shopping in Dublin
Dublin is the shopping capital of Ireland. Within the city limits, you can
easily find all sorts of famous Irish items, including Donegal tweed,
Waterford Crystal, Belleek china, and Claddagh rings. The nearby map
locates the shopping meccas.
Locating the best shopping areas
There are three main shopping areas in Dublin. The first, on the north side
of the River Liffey, is the Henry Street–Mary Street area, off O’Connell
Street. You can find reasonably priced goods, especially clothing, at the
malls and stores in this area. Moore Street, just off the main shopping
drag, offers a daily open-air market with plenty of the freshest (and
cheapest) fruits and vegetables in the city. This is where you’ll hear the
perfected lilt of the vendors hawking their wares — a Dublin attraction
in its own right.
The Grafton Street area (including Duke, Dawson, Nassua, Wicklow, 
and other nearby streets) on the south side of the River Liffey offers 
a variety of shopping options. Bustling Grafton Street itself is lined 
with trendy big-name clothing stores and is home to Brown Thomas,
Ireland’s ultrafashionable department store. The side streets off Grafton
are home to upscale and funky boutiques and stores. Nearby Nassau
Street is the place to find the best in Irish crafts, from sweaters to 
crystal.

If you’re looking for the funkiest fashions, jewelry, art, and music, head
to the Temple Bar area. The hottest new places to shop in these parts
are on Cow’s Lane.
Teenagers: You may want to drag your parents to the Market Arcade, on
South Great George’s Street, between Exchequer Street and Fade Street,
for music, fun clothes, a grungy coffee shop, and stalls selling jewelry
and ephemera such as a sign that says, “Tired of being harassed by your
parents?”
If your idea of shopping consists mostly of pampering yourself, the
Powerscourt Townhouse Shopping Centre, 59 S. William St., Dublin 2
(% 01-679-4144), is for you. This restored Georgian townhouse is home
to a variety of shops, ranging from clothes boutiques to antiques stores.
Finally, Dubliners are in love with the new Dundrum Town Centre
(www.dundrum.ie), a sprawling mall outside of the city. You can get
there by bus nos. 17, 44, 44C, 48A, 48N, or 75, and by Luas to Balally.
Finding Ireland’s best wares
Ireland is known the world over for its handmade products and fine
craftsmanship, and Dublin, as Ireland’s commercial center, is a one-stop
source for the best of Irish products.
Antiques
Dublin offers two main areas of concentration for antiques dealers:
Francis Street (between Thomas Street West and the Coombe) and
Dawson and Molesworth streets (between St. Stephen’s Green and
Trinity College). The following places are some of your best bets for
quality and value.
Also see Cathach Books in the next section and John Farrington in the
Crafts and Jewelry section.
 The Irish Historical Picture Company, 5 Lower Ormond Quay,
Dublin 1 (% 01-872-0144), is a vast treasure trove of photographs
documenting the life of Ireland since the invention of the camera in
every region and theme you can imagine.
Books
Like any section of a city that surrounds a college campus, there are
loads of good bookstores near Trinity College. You can find works of
Irish writers here that may be hard to find at home.
 Books Upstairs, 36 College Green and Dame Street, across from the
Trinity College front entrance, Dublin 2 (% 01-679-6687), has a
comprehensive collection of Irish fiction and nonfiction, a sizable
gay and lesbian selection, and some fiction bargains.
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
174

 Cathach Books, 10 Duke St., off Grafton Street, Dublin 2 (% 01-671-
8676), sells rare editions of Irish literature, plus old maps of Ireland.
 Greene’s, 16 Clare St., Dublin 2 (% 01-676-2554), was mentioned in
Joyce’s Ulysses and boasts a huge Irish literature section and a
giant secondhand selection.
 Hodges Figgis, 56–58 Dawson St., Dublin 2 (% 01-677-4754), is
Ireland’s top independent bookstore, offering a wide selection of
books. There’s a nice cafe on the first floor.
 Waterstone’s, Jervis Centre, Mary Street, Dublin 1 (% 01-679-
1415), is pretty much the Barnes & Noble of the Emerald Isle.
Clothes
You don’t have to go all the way to the Aran Islands or Donegal for
authentic Irish knitwear. Here are some Dublin shops where you can find
the real deal, plus a few places for less traditional items.
 Avoca, 11–13 Suffolk St. (% 01-677-4215), sells the Irish-designed
and -made Anthology line of clothes, with all the vivid colors and
funky lace, beads, and ribbons that a 20- or 30-something girl could
want, plus it offers all sorts of household goods and clothes for hip
babies (such as a onesie that says It girl).
 Claire Garvey Designs, 6 Cow’s Lane, Dublin 2 (% 01-671-7287), is
where fairy queens would buy their clothes. Garvey creates shim-
mery, sheer pieces, many with lace-up bodices and beads. Looking
like a goddess doesn’t come cheap, though.
 Enable Ireland, South Great George’s Street, Dublin 2 (next to
Juice; % 01-478-2763), sells used clothes from silver vinyl pants to
girls’ flowery dresses. All profits go to Enable Ireland, which helps
people with disabilities lead independent lives.
 Kevin & Howlin, 31 Nassau St., Dublin 2 (% 01-677-0257), sells
authentic hand-woven tweed jackets and hats for men and women.
Crafts and jewelry
If you’re in the market for Irish crafts and jewelry, point yourself in the
direction of Nassau Street, on the edge of Trinity College, which is lined
with shops selling Irish items. Also see “Souvenirs and gifts,” later in this
chapter.
 Brown Thomas, 88–95 Grafton St., Dublin 2 (% 01-605-6666),
stocks Irish fashion and giftware.
 College House Jewellers, 44 Nassau St., Dublin 2 (% 01-677-7597),
stocks gorgeous Celtic-style jewelry and has a comprehensive col-
lection of Claddagh jewelry, from classic to modern.
Chapter 11: Dublin 175

 DESIGNyard Retail Gallery, 48–49 Nassau St., Dublin 2, along
Temple Bar’s main thoroughfare (% 01-670-9371), stocks exquisite
and generally affordable contemporary Irish-designed jewelry, tex-
tiles, glass, sculpture, and earthenware.
 John Farrington, 32 Drury St., Dublin 2 (% 01-679-1899), is a good
bet for vintage jewelry, from Georgian silver earrings to Victorian
lockets.
 Weir and Sons, 96 Grafton St., at Wicklow Street, Dublin 2 (% 01-
677-9678), sells fine jewelry, Waterford Crystal, silver, leather, and
watches in elegant showcases.
Irish music and musical instruments
If you fell in love with the sounds of the traditional session you heard at
the pub last night, head to one of these stores to pick up a CD, or even a
tin whistle or bodhrán (bow-rahn; a goatskin drum) of your very own.
 Celtic Note Music Shop, 12 Nassau St., Dublin 2 (% 01-670-4157),
is a great place to find any type of Irish music, from traditional to
contemporary rock. Prices here are slightly lower than at Claddagh
Records. They occasionally host free midday in-store concerts by
hot traditional Irish bands.
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
176
This little traveler went to market
One of the best ways to experience Dublin is to hit the markets. Here are some of the best.
 Cow’s Lane Fashion & Design Market, Cow’s Lane, Old City, Temple Bar, is a
heaven for those who love hip, handmade clothing and jewelry. Every Saturday
from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
 Moore Street Market, Moore Street, is a bustling market full of vendors selling
fresh vegetables, fruits, and flowers. Many vendors still hawk their wares in a lilt-
ing, singsong voice reminiscent of the Molly Malones of the past. Monday through
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Temple Bar Book Market, Temple Bar Square, is a smallish outdoor used-book
market. Grab some lunch at the outdoor food market, and browse through the
offerings. Every Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
 Temple Bar Craft and Furniture Market, Meeting House Square, showcases orig-
inal crafts and furniture from Irish and international designers and artists. Every
Sunday from noon to 6 p.m.
 Temple Bar Outdoor Food Market, Meetinghouse Square in Temple Bar, with
entrances on East Essex and Eustace streets, Dublin 2 is an orgy of Irish gourmet
and organic food, including delicacies such as Chez Emily’s chocolates, artisanal
breads and cheeses, and gorgeous produce. Every Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

 Claddagh Records, 2 Cecilia St., Temple Bar (% 01-677-0262), sells
the best traditional Irish and world-music CDs. The staff here is
exceedingly knowledgeable, so this is the place to go if you’re not
sure what you’re looking for.
 McCullough Piggott, 11 S. William St., Dublin 2 (% 01-677-3138),
sells all sorts of instruments and the tutorial books and CDs that
help you play them.
Souvenirs and gifts
Also see the recommendations in “Crafts and jewelry,” earlier in this
chapter.
 Celtic Whiskey Shop, 27–28 Dawson St., Dublin 2 (% 01-675-9744),
sells everything from the best-known brands of whiskey, such as
Bushmills, to rare bottlings from distilleries that have closed their
doors. They host tastings in the store each day to whet your palate.
 Guinness Storehouse, St. James’s Gate, Dublin 8 (% 01-408-4800;
www.guinness-storehouse.com), stocks all things Guinness, from
posters and slippers to clocks and candles.
 House of Ireland, 37 Nassau St., at the corner of Dawson Street,
Dublin 2 (% 01-671-1111), is one-stop shopping for authentic Irish
goods such as Waterford Crystal, china, hand-knit Aran sweaters,
and more.
 House of Names, 26 Nassau St. (% 01-679-7287), creates and sells
wall shields and plaques; clothing; and jewelry with the crest, coat
of arms, and motto of most European family names. Here’s hoping
you have one of those cool dragons on your coat of arms.
 Kilkenny, 5–6 Nassau St. (% 01-677-7066), boasts original Irish
designs, including glass, knitwear, jewelry, and a large selection of
gorgeous pottery.
 Lush, 166 Grafton St., near the entrance to Trinity College (% 01-
677-0392), is not particularly Irish, but when your giftees open
their packages of colorful homemade soaps, bubble baths, sham-
poos, and more, they won’t care. All the items here look good
enough to eat, and you probably could eat them, because they’re all
made with as many natural ingredients as possible. And who can
resist a store that hacks individual slices of soap off huge slabs?
Hitting the Pubs and Enjoying 
Dublin’s Nightlife
James Joyce put it best in Ulysses: “Good puzzle would be cross Dublin
without passing a pub.” With more than 1,000 pubs in the city (the
“Dublin Nightlife” map helps locate them), there’s something to suit

everyone, whether your taste runs to Victorian pubs with globe lights

couches and clocks that read the wrong time.
Hitting the pubs
The Brazen Head
Dublin 8
The Brazen Head claims to be the oldest pub in Dublin. That may or may
not be true, but certainly many a pint has been pulled here since its open-
ing in 1661 (an older pub, from 1198, stood on this site before the “new”
pub was built). The unusual name comes from a story about a bold woman
who was so curious during one of the country’s many rebellions that she
stuck her head out of the window — only to have it chopped off! Though
it’s a bit touristy, it’s a beautiful pub, lit by lanterns. There’s music every
night beginning at 9:30 p.m.
20 Lower Bridge St. % 01-677-9549. Bus: 78A, 79, 90.
Doheny & Nesbitt
Dublin 2
A poster-child of Victorian pubs, “Nesbitt’s” boasts snugs (cozy compart-
ments), dark wood, and bartenders full of wisdom. The clientele is heavy
on lawyers, economists, and politicians.
5 Lower Baggott St. % 01-676-2945. Bus: 10, 11, 11A.
Grogan’s
Dublin 2
This small, unpretentious pub is filled with artists, writers, and assorted
characters. The walls are covered with works by local artists. You’re sure
to meet some interesting folks here.
15 S. William St. % 01-677-9320. Bus: 16, 16A, 19, 19A, 65, 65B, 83, 112.
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
180
Café-en-Seine: The anti-pub?
Though it’s called a pub, Café-en-Seine, 40 Dawson St., Dublin 2 (% 01-677-4567),
looks like it was flown over intact from 19th-century Paris. This incredibly popular spot
has a gorgeous Art Deco interior, with a glass atrium, brass chandeliers, murals, 
and large mirrors. You can get light bites, pastries, and coffees by day and wine, beer,
and cocktails by night. The crowd can be a bit snooty, making for excellent people-
watching.

The Long Hall
Dublin 2
Rumored to have the longest bar in the city, The Long Hall is a gorgeous,
ornate specimen of a pub. There’s a vast array of antique clocks, Victorian
lamps, a mahogany bar, and plenty of snugs to get lost in. It backs up to
Dublin Castle, so stop in on your way.
51 S. Great George’s St. % 01-475-1590. Bus: 50, 50A, 54, 56, 77.
McDaid’s
Dublin 2
Attention, writers and literature-lovers: This was bad-boy playwright
Brendan Behan’s favorite watering hole, and the pub is still known as the
place to go for the latest on literary news in Dublin.
3 Harry St., off Grafton Street. % 01-679-4395. Bus: 10, 11, 13B, 14, 14A, 15, 15A, 
15B, 15C.
Mulligan’s
Dublin 2
This is an authentic old Dublin pub and favorite watering hole for the jour-
nalists of the nearby Irish Times newspaper. JFK drank here as a young
European correspondent for the Hearst newspapers in 1945 and again
when he visited as president. It’s mentioned in Ulysses, and locals say it
serves one of the best pints of Guinness in town.
8 Poolbeg St. (off south quays near O’Connell Bridge). % 01-677-5582. Bus: 5, 7, 7A,
7X, 8.
Scholar’s
Dublin 8
The spacious bar at Scholar’s, a restored all-boys National School, has a
giant screen that offers a perfect view from any seat of the latest football
(read: soccer), rugby, hurling, or Gaelic football matches.
Donovan’s Lane, off Clanbrassil Street, below St. Patrick’s Cathedral. % 01-453-2000.
Bus: 49, 49a, 49x, 54a, 54n.
The Stag’s Head
Dublin 2
The Stag’s Head is a Victorian classic, with gleaming rich auburn wood,
frosted globe lamps, and stained-glass windows. It’s popular with Trinity
students, journalists, and theater folk. Try to score a seat in the small, 
Chapter 11: Dublin 181

opulent room on the right in the rear. And stick around if you get hungry — 
the food here is terrific.
1 Dame Ct. (look for the mosaic stag head inlaid into the sidewalk on Dame Street
pointing the way). % 01-679-3701. Bus: 21A, 50, 50A, 78, 78A, 78B.
Toner’s
Dublin 2
This is a great, old, authentic Dublin pub with a high craic (fun) factor.
You’ll find everyone from older folks enjoying a drink to boisterous rugby
fans celebrating their team’s victory.
139 Lower Baggott St. % 01-676-3090. Bus: 10.
Pulling an all-nighter: Late-night bars
Still up for some partying after last call? I recommend the following
extended-hours pubs, plus Café-en-Seine (see the box earlier in this
chapter).
 Bleeding Horse, 24–25 Camden St., Dublin 2 (% 01-475-2705).
 The Foggy Dew, 1 Upper Fownes St., Temple Bar, Dublin 2 
(% 01-677-9328).
 Turk’s Head Chop House, Parliament Street, Temple Bar, Dublin 2
(% 01-679-9701).
 Whelan’s Pub, 25 Wexford St., Dublin 2 (% 01-478-0766).
Taking in some music
Dublin has a hot music scene, featuring everything from jazz to rock to
traditional Irish music.
Traditional Irish music venues
In addition to visiting the pubs below, I suggest the Traditional Irish
Music Pub Crawl (listed in “Seeing Dublin by guided tour,” earlier in this
chapter). Also, see The Brazen Head (reviewed earlier in this chapter).
 The Cobblestone, 77 North King St., at Red Cow Lane (% 01-872-
1799), a dark pub filled with instruments and photographs of 
traditional Irish musicians, hosts a lively, mostly Irish crowd and
friendly sessions each night, with some exceptional musicians. No
fuss, no show, no hip location — just the best traditional Irish
music in Dublin. This is the real thing.
 O’Donoghues, 15 Merrion Row, Dublin 2 (% 01-676-2807), 
mostly hosts traditional Irish ballad singers. The dark pub is a 
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
182

bit touristy, but you’ll also find a good many locals enjoying 
themselves.
 Oliver St. John Gogarty, 58 Fleet St., Temple Bar, Dublin 2 (% 01-
671-1822), is a popular pub named for surgeon, wit, and writer
Oliver St. John Gogarty, who was the model for Buck Mulligan, a flip
character in Ulysses. The interior screams Irish pub, with its décor
of old books and bottles and portraits of traditional Irish music
greats. The pub is always packed with travelers from all over the
world, and you find live Irish music seven nights a week starting at
9 p.m., plus Saturdays at 4:30 p.m. and Sundays from noon to 2 p.m.
Check out the great lunch buffet.
Rock, jazz, and other music venues
Dublin is by no means all jigs and reels all the time. The hopping live-
music scene encompasses rock, jazz, country, folk, blues, classical, and
more. The venues listed here consistently offer fantastic concerts.
 The Contemporary Music Centre, 19 Fishamble St., Temple Bar,
Dublin 8 (% 01-673-1922; www.cmc.ie) brings the very best new
music from Irish composers.
 The National Concert Hall, Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin 2 (% 01-
417-0000; www.nch.ie), is Dublin’s best venue for classical music
performances.
 The O2, Eastlink Bridge, North Wall Quay (% 818-719-391; www.
thepoint.ie), is Dublin’s gorgeous new top venue for internation-
ally known rock and folk acts, seating up to 6,000 people in arena
seating.
 Vicar Street, 58–59 Thomas St., Dublin 8 (% 01-454-5533; www.
vicarstreet.com), is a small concert venue with seating. It hosts
excellent (and often well-known) rock, jazz, folk, and traditional
music.
 Whelan’s, 25 Wexford St., Dublin 2 (% 01-478-0766), has a cozy
wooden interior; a nice atmosphere; and a great lineup of well-
known rock, folk, and traditional musicians.
Clubbing your way through Dublin
As in most European capitals, clubbing is taken seriously in Dublin, 
and dress is pretty important, especially at the trendiest, most popular
clubs — don’t be surprised it you’re turned away because you’re wear-
ing jeans or sneakers. Often, there are cover charges (usually between
5/$8 and 25/$40), and you may need to show an ID. Clubs usually
open just when buses stop running (about 11:30 p.m.), so expect to take
a cab back to your hotel.
Chapter 11: Dublin 183

Here are some of the best clubs in Dublin.
 Club M, Blooms Hotel, Angelsea Street (% 01-671-5274), packs ’em
in Tuesday through Sunday for sweaty, all-night DJ dance parties.
This place has a reputation as a pickup joint.
 Lillie’s Bordello, Adam Court off Grafton Street (% 01-679-9204), is 
still one of the hottest Dublin clubs after ten years, with a lipstick-red 
interior and the members-only (you can pay to be a member)
“Library” room.
 Renards, 35–37 S. Frederick St. (% 01-677-5876), pulls in celebri-
ties and locals alike with three floors of bars, dancing, and frequent
live jazz.
 Ri-Rá, 1 Exchequer St. (% 01-671-1220), fills up every night with
dancers getting down to funk, jazz, and other grooves.
 Rogue, 64 Dame St. (% 01-675-3971) is a hot, newly renovated spot
for house and techno.
Checking out Dublin’s excellent theater scene
Dubliners have long held theater in high reverence, and the city has a
thriving theater scene that encompasses everything from the plays of
Synge to new multimedia projects.
Ireland’s most famous playhouse, the Abbey Theatre, 26 Lower Abbey
St., Dublin 1 (% 01-878-7222; www.abbeytheatre.ie), is best known for
staging superb productions of works by some of Ireland’s best-loved
playwrights, including Sean O’Casey and J. M. Synge. The Abbey’s sister
theater, The Peacock, 26 Lower Abbey St., Dublin 1 (% 01-878-7222;
www.abbeytheatre.ie), boasts excellent productions of new plays. The
Gate, 1 Cavendish Row, Dublin 1 (% 01-874-4045; www.gate-theatre.
ie), does a beautiful job with European, Irish, and American classics 
and new plays. The theater is particularly lauded for its productions of
Samuel Beckett’s work. Project Arts Centre, 39 E. Essex St., Dublin 2 
(% 01-881-9613), is the place to go for new and experimental theater.
Call the theaters or check the Irish Times newspaper for details about
shows.
Going to the movies
Or, as the Irish say, “the cinema.” There are lots of places to catch a flick
in Dublin. UCG Multiplex, midway down Parnell Street in Parnell Center,
Dublin 1 (% 01-872-8444), is a streamlined and very modern multiplex,
with 12 screens showing the latest commercial movies. The Irish Film
Institute (IFI), 6 Eustace St., Temple Bar, Dublin 2 (% 01-679-5744),
shows up-and-coming Irish independent cinema, European exclusives,
and classics. A place for true film buffs, the IFI is as hip as it gets. There
is a cafe, a lively bar, and a book and video/DVD shop on the premises
(note that Irish videos and DVDs come in a different format than in the
U.S., and most American VCRs and DVD players can’t play them).

Chapter 12
Easy Trips North of Dublin:
Counties Meath and Louth
In This Chapter
 Exploring a 5,000-year-old tomb
 Checking out Celtic high crosses
 Biking or walking a trail rich in history and mythology
 Hanging out on a working farm
C
ollectively, Counties Meath and Louth are known as the ancient
land of the Celts. They’re the country’s hot spots for visiting prehis-
toric and mythical sites, including ancient sacred burial mounds, areas
where the old Irish high kings held court, and Celtic high crosses.
County Meath has some of the most important ancient religious and
political attractions in Ireland — the prehistoric tombs of Newgrange
and Knowth, and the Hill of Tara, long the seat of Irish kings. The heart
of the area is the River Boyne, home of the famous Battle of the Boyne,
in which Protestant William of Orange defeated Catholic King James II,
changing the course of Irish history. This region has been fought over by
the country’s many invaders, and all of those invaders, from the Normans
to the English, have left their mark here. The history-rich towns of Kells,
Slane, and Trim (with minor attractions including Slane Castle and Trim
Castle) are the best places to stay in Meath. My favorite town in the
area, Carlingford, in Louth, is not far from the major attractions).
What County Louth lacks in big tourist attractions it makes up for in his-
tory and in the charm of small towns such as Carlingford, Dundalk, and
Drogheda (pronounced dragh-da). These towns are the stomping grounds
of legends such as Cuchulainn (pronounced coo-cul-in), Queen Maeve, and
the great warrior Finn MacCool (see Chapter 2 for more information on
these mythical characters). The most beautiful area of Louth is the far
northern area, encompassing the Cooley Mountains and Peninsula, and
the delightful heritage town of Carlingford, which overlooks the Irish Sea.
You can easily take day trips from Dublin to both counties, which you
may well think of as one destination because they’re so complementary.
But I encourage you to set up camp for a night, especially in Carlingford.

Dublin. Take the M1 north toward Dundalk and follow the signs for most
of the major towns and attractions mentioned in this chapter. To get to
the Cooley Peninsula from Dundalk, take the R173, which loops to the
town of Newry.
Irish Rail (% 1-850-366-222; www.irishrail.ie) has stops in the
County Louth towns of Drogheda and Dundalk from Dublin.

modations. For locations, see the “Counties Meath and Louth” map.

Bellinter House
$$$$
Navan, County Meath
Let’s see . . . What would a typical day at the grand Bellinter House be like?
You could sleep late in your room, featuring lovely Georgian details, and
then head down to the well-appointed breakfast room. Perhaps read for a
while in one of the lounges, which marry traditional Georgian elements
with hip modern design. Then walk the extensive grounds of the property,
heading to either the indoor or outdoor infinity pools (the outdoor option
overlooks a herd of horses munching in a field). You wouldn’t want to
forget your appointment at the spa, which offers a complete menu of treat-
ments, from head massages to full body wraps. Then will it be cocktails, an
excellent dinner of fresh Irish produce, a dip in the hot tub, or watching a
video on your large, flat-screen TV? In short, this is a luxurious destina-
tion perfect for those looking for relaxation.

Exploring Meath and Louth:
The Top Attractions
The knowledgeable Mary Gibbons narrates superb bus tours of Meath,
which include visits to Newgrange and the Hill of Tara, and a drive along
the beautiful and historical Boyne River and through the village of Slane.
For information and reservations, call Newgrange Tours at % 01-283-
9973, or visit www.newgrangetours.com. Tours cost 35 ($56) for
adults, 30 ($48) for students and older children, and 20 ($32) for
younger children. Tours last about seven hours, and leave Monday
through Saturday from Dublin (there are pick-ups between 9:30 and
10:30 a.m. at several Dublin hotels).
Newgrange and Knowth (via 
Brú na Bóinne Visitor Centre)
Donore, County Meath
The Brú na Bóinne Visitor Centre provides access to the wondrous pre-
historic passage-tombs of Newgrange and Knowth. Newgrange is a huge,
impressively intact round mound — 200,000 tons of earth and stone cov-
ering a magnificent and well-preserved 5,000-year-old burial chamber.
Take a walk around the tomb to see the ancient stone carvings — spi-
rals, diamonds, and other designs. No one knows what these carvings
symbolize, but there are numerous theories, from the conjecture that
they are mathematic symbols to the theory that they may have been
produced under the effects of hallucinogenic drugs. Over the entrance
stone to Newgrange is an opening that allows light to slowly creep into
the burial chamber during the five days surrounding the winter solstice,
filling the room with a warm, golden glow for about 15 minutes. You enter 
the tomb through a low arch and make your way Indiana Jones–style
down the long and narrow stone passage to the cool, dark central burial
chamber, where you see more stone carvings and may be party to a very
special surprise (no hints; you have to go see for yourself).
Knowth is a tomb of similar size to Newgrange, used from the Stone Age
through the 1400s. The main tomb is attended by many smaller satellite
tombs, and the stones surrounding the tomb sport beautiful designs.
You can’t enter the chambers at Knowth, though you can gaze down the
long entry passageway. Be sure to take the opportunity to climb on top
of the tomb to see the Boyne Valley laid out before you.
If you have to choose between Newgrange and Knowth, I recommend
Newgrange — there’s more to see, and you can actually enter the cham-
bers. But if you can, see both.
You can only access Newgrange and Knowth through the visitor center;
purchase tickets there and take the minibus shuttle to the sites. If you
have extra time, check out the offerings in the visitor center, which
include interpretive displays about the society that created the tombs,
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
192

as well as an audiovisual that provides an interesting introduction to the
tombs. Arrive early to ensure a ticket — this is a very popular site, and
tickets are limited. Also, be aware that the last shuttle bus for the tombs
leaves one and three-quarter hours before the visitor center closes.

Other Cool Things to See and Do
 Biking all or part of the Táin Trail Cycling Route: This cycling
route, 589km (365 miles) long in total, goes past some major histor-
ical sights in Louth, including castles, ruins, Celtic crosses, and
areas associated with the ancient Irish epic of the Cattle-Raid of
Cooley. For more information, call the Dundalk Tourist Office
(% 042-933-5484).

3100. www.carlingfordadventure.com. Open: Year-round.
 Causey Farm: Want to get your hands dirty while having some old-
fashioned Irish fun? The Causey Farm gives you the opportunity 
to make your own brown bread, munch on scones, cut up some turf
in a bog, learn some set dancing and Irish drumming, see a sheep-
dog demonstration, have a traditional dinner, and end the day with
a traditional music session Note: The experience runs only for
groups, so it is essential that you call in advance to find out when a
group is coming and then join with them. Bring lunch if you don’t
want to buy it at the farm. Dinner is included during the long-day

Chapter 12: Easy Trips North of Dublin: Counties Meath and Louth 193

 Driving the Cooley Peninsula, Louth: This peninsula offers a 
gorgeous scenic drive with impressive views of the Irish Sea and
Carlingford Lough (pronounced lock). At one point, the road actu-
ally passes through the mountainside. The peninsula is the mythic
home of legendary heroes, namely Cuchulainn and Finn MacCool.
Dotted along the drive are dolmen (Neolithic tombs), forests, moun-
tains, rivers, ruins, and quaint fishing villages. The largest village,
Carlingford, is a good place to stop for a stretch or a night. Walk
around the ruins of King John’s Castle (especially impressive in 
the evening), and stroll along Carlingford Lough, a natural fjord
from the Ice Age that separates the Republic and Northern Ireland
in this area.
Location: Outside Dundalk, County Louth. By car: R173 loops around 
the Peninsula, off N1 outside Dundalk. Suggested visit: three hours.
 Hill of Tara: The hill of Tara is known as the royal seat of the Irish
high kings, who presided over a lively national assembly held every
three years to pass laws and resolve disputes. The last assembly
was held in A.D. 560, and it is said that 242 kings were crowned on
the hill. This site takes some imagination to enjoy, because the only
remnants of this pre-Christian political center are mounds and
depressions where buildings once stood, plus a few old building
stones. A late–Stone Age passage tomb also exists on the site. Take
advantage of a guided tour (available on request, so just ask) and
the audiovisual in the visitor center to get a better feel for the site.
There are dazzling views from the hill.
Location: South of Navan off the main Dublin road (N3), County
Meath. % 046-90-25-903 May through mid-September, or % 041-
988-0300 mid-September through April. From Dublin, take the N3
toward Navan, and look for signs beginning about 15km (9 miles)
before reaching Navan. Near the village of Kilmessan. Admission:
2.10 ($3.40) adults, 1.30 ($2.10) seniors, 1.10 ($1.80) students
and children. Open: Mid-May to mid-September daily 10 a.m. to 
6 p.m. Last admission 45 minutes before closing. Suggested visit:
Forty-five minutes.
 Monasterboice: Two remarkable tenth-century decorated High
Crosses keep a solemn watch over the ruins of a sixth-century
monastery and a graveyard. High Crosses combine Celtic and
Christian symbols and designs and were often decorated with bibli-
cal scenes so that they could be used as teaching tools to help the
illiterate to better understand the bible. The first cross that you
encounter, known as Muiredach’s Cross, depicts the Last Judgment
and many Old Testament scenes (check out the interpretive panel
opposite the Cross). The other cross (sometimes called the West
Cross) is one of the largest in Ireland. The remains of a round tower
and church ruins are other highlights.
Location: Off the main Dublin road (M1) near Collon, County Louth.
By car: M1 from Dublin. Admission: Free. Open: Daylight hours.
Suggested visit: Thirty minutes.
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
194

 Newgrange Farm: This is your average Irish working-farm turned
tourist attraction. The friendly Redhouse family gives a tour of the
farm, livestock, garden, and 17th-century buildings. You may get to
hold a baby chick, watch a threshing machine in action, see a horse
get a new pair of shoes, pet a donkey, and more. This attraction is
definitely one for the kids, but adults can enjoy themselves as well
and may learn a few pointers for the garden at home. If you can, try
to be here for the Sheep Race (the jockeys are teddy bears), held
every Sunday afternoon. Try to book your visit as far in advance as
possible.
Location: Off N51, Slane, County Meath. % 041-982-4119. www.
newgrangefarm.com. Admission: 8 ($13) per person, 6 ($9.60)
per person in a family. Open: Easter through September daily 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. Suggested visit: One and a half hours.
 Old Mellifont Abbey: Founded by St. Malachy in 1142, Mellifont
was the first Cistercian monastery in Ireland. This historic house 
of worship was suppressed by Henry VIII, then became a pigsty 
(literally), and later was the headquarters for William III during 
the Battle of the Boyne. The site is a peaceful and tranquil place.
The unique octagonal lavabo (a washing trough for religious cere-
monies) remains intact, along with several of the abbey’s arches, all
set along the River Mattock. The visitor center contains examples
of masonry from the Middle Ages. You can visit the site for free at
any time.
Location: Tullyallen, Drogheda, County Louth. % 041-982-6459

As part-grocery, part-pub, O’Hare’s is a dying breed of places that combine
a local watering hole with a neighborhood convenience store. But this popu-
lar place brings in the tourists for another unique attraction: the lep-
rechaun in a glass case. (Judge its authenticity for yourself.) The pub also
features traditional music on Tuesdays. The pub grub is good, but you’ve
gotta try the house specialty — oysters. Simply scrumptious. This is Irish
folk-rock band The Corrs’ favorite Louth pub.

Easy Trips South of Dublin:
Counties Wicklow 
and Kildare
In This Chapter
 Wandering through some of Ireland’s most beautiful gardens
 Hiking the Wicklow Mountains
 Making a pilgrimage to the home of Irish racing
I
mmediately south of bustling Dublin, you find the beginnings of all
that famous Irish green. County Wicklow’s people trim all that lush
greenery into beautiful gardens (many with gorgeous manor houses
crowning the properties), and hike through the verdant hills and valleys
in the delightful Wicklow Mountains. County Kildare’s citizens tend to
feed their greenery to the horses — the county is home to dozens upon
dozens of horse farms, as well as many racetracks, including Ireland’s
best, the Curragh.
County Wicklow
County Wicklow is known as “The Garden of Ireland,” and it’s easy to see
why. The county begins just barely out of Dublin’s limits, and almost
immediately the cityscape gives way to rural roads and delightful hill and
coastal scenery. Wicklow’s eastern coast is studded with resort areas and
harbor towns, where you can have a fine seafood dinner (Greystones, a
peaceful little hamlet, is my favorite of these towns). Then, there are the
famed gardens and manor houses of the area, including the must-see
Powerscourt Gardens. Inland, the velvety valleys and wooded glens of
the Wicklow Mountains beckon. To really get a feel for the area, take a
walk on a stretch of the Wicklow Way, a signposted walking path that fol-
lows forest trails, sheep paths, and county roads from just outside Dublin
all the way to Clonegal (a total of about 130km/80 miles), passing through

This hotel, beautifully situated between the Irish Sea and the Wicklow

on-site. If you’re a golfer, you’ll appreciate the location — on the 160
hectare (400-acre) Druid’s Glen Golf Resort.

bedrooms are nothing to write home about, but you’ll probably be explor-
ing the area the whole day anyway. The traditional Irish dishes served in
the dining room are excellent and fresh, and the Glendalough Tavern has
some of the best pub food you’ll find in a hotel, including a wonderful lamb
stew. Check the Web site for special offers and discounts, which run often.

If you thought this little eatery was just a decent place to get some tea and
baked goods while blowing your budget on Avoca’s beautiful woven items,
think again. Located in the back of the shop, this cheerful cafe serves some
divine lunch choices, from salads, soups, and sandwiches to main courses
such as smoked trout and honey-glazed ham. The low lunch prices make
it easy to justify buying that extra woolen throw.

Greystones
ECLECTIC
Local families and groups of friends fill this casual, modern spot for
lunches, leisurely after-work drinks and snacks, and dinners. This is the
kind of menu that you don’t have to think too hard about — no tomato
foams or tapenades; just simple, well-prepared food such as burgers,
blackened-chicken pasta, fish and chips, and Thai chicken curry, along
with a great wine list. I’m a big fan of the mushroom tart with leek-and-
garlic sauce. The bright interior is stylishly decorated with high-backed
pine chairs and small contemporary paintings, but the patio out front is
the place to be on a nice day.

Clink your wineglasses over plates of simply prepared fish, stew, or per-

herbs and topped with gherkins. Keep your eyes peeled for the various
works of art with monks as their subject. Groups may want to reserve early
in order to snag the large, candelabra-lit table. If you feel like a more formal
meal, head upstairs to the Hungry Monk’s fancier restaurant, where steaks
are a favorite.

Continental dishes, from a succulent steak to Irish stew. If you want a
cheaper meal or a bite to tide you over between meals, check out the ter-
rific pub grub in the bar. The inn was built in the 18th century and is fur-

Exploring County Wicklow
Here are some of the best ways to enjoy the emerald landscape of
County Wicklow.
Organized tours
Because Wicklow is so close to Dublin, a number of operators offer bus
tours, and others take advantage of the area’s beauty to offer such inter-
esting options as horseback tours.
Bus Éireann (% 01-836-6111; www.buseireann.ie) offers day tours of
the Wicklow area from Dublin. The Glendalough and Powerscourt
Gardens Tour (33/$56 adults, 27/$43 students and seniors, 23/$37
children, not including attraction admission) runs from mid-March
through November, covering the south coast of Dublin, the Wicklow
Mountains, Powerscourt, Roundwood, Laragh, and Glendalough. Tours
leave from Busaras, on Store Street, at 10 a.m. daily.
The Wild Wicklow Tour (% 01-280-1899; www.DiscoverDublin.ie),
which uses a small Mercedes coach that goes where the big and bulky
buses can’t, packs in many of the highlights of Wicklow. First, you visit
the beautiful seaside town of Dalkey, home to Bono, Enya, and many of
Ireland’s other rich and famous; then move on to Avoca Handweavers,
which sells colorful woolen items and funky clothing, as well as delicious
lunches. Next, you hit Wicklow’s top attraction, the enchanting sixth-
century monastic settlement of Glendalough, before stopping for a pub
lunch. Your day ends with a visit to Sally Gap, which has stunning views
of the surrounding mountains, and Lough Tay, a quietly magnificent
mountain lake. I particularly recommend this tour because the guides
are friendly, fun, and informative, and allow you time to explore a bit on
your own. The full-day tour leaves from the Dublin tourist office and
picks up passengers at various hotels around Dublin (tell them where
you’re staying, and they’ll tell you the closest pickup point). Prices are
28 ($44) adults, and 25 ($40) student or child. The same company
also runs a half-day Wild Powerscourt Tour, touring the famous gar-
dens. Advance reservations are required.
The top attractions
Glendalough Round Tower and Monastery
Glendalough
This secluded, leafy site, centered on two peaceful lakes, has been a sacred
one since the sixth century, when St. Kevin founded a monastery here. The
area flourished as a community of learning for almost 900 years, with the
sounds of theories and ideas bouncing off the majestic trees and stone
Chapter 13: Easy Trips South of Dublin: Wicklow and Kildare 203

buildings. The entire complex was sacked by Anglo-Norman invaders in
the 14th century, and most of the buildings were destroyed. However, you
can still explore many ruins around the Upper and Lower lakes, including
the remnants of a seventh- to ninth-century cathedral; a graveyard full of
beautifully designed Celtic crosses; and the highlight, a stunningly pre-
served 31m (103-ft.) round tower capped with a belfry. Drop into the well-
done visitor center to get a sense of the context of this site. I highly
recommend the peaceful walk from the Lower Lake to the less-visited
Upper Lake.
Glendalough. % 0404-45-325. Take N11 to R755 from Dublin, R752 to R755 from
Wicklow. Admission: 2.90 ($4.70) adults, 2.10 ($3.40) seniors, 1.30 ($2.10) chil-
dren and students. Open: Mid-Oct to mid-Mar daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.; mid-Mar to mid-
Oct daily 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m. Last admission 45 minutes before closing. Suggested visit:
11⁄2 hours.
Mt. Usher Gardens
Ashford
More than 5,000 species of plants from all over the world populate these
informal gardens, located along the River Vartry. These 8 hectares (20
acres), which started as a humble potato patch in 1860, have blossomed
into a wild ocean of flowers, trees, meadows, and waterfalls, with small
suspension bridges crossing the river, and birds and wildlife flitting above
and through the exotic greenery. The spot where a mini suspension bridge
spans a little waterfall just may be one of the most romantic spots in
Ireland. Also on the premises are a tearoom and a courtyard filled with
shops.
Off the main Dublin-Wicklow Road (N11); look for the signs. % 0404-40-205.
Admission: 7 ($11) adults, 6 ($9.60) seniors and students, 3 ($4.80) children 5–12.
Open: Mar 10–Oct daily 10:30 a.m.–6 p.m. (last entry 5 p.m.). Suggested visit: 11⁄2 hours.
National Sea Life Centre
Bray
This highly interactive aquarium follows the route of a river from its origin
to its ocean destination, bringing you face to face with thousands of sea-
water and freshwater creatures along the way. Kids will have a ball fol-
lowing an adventure trail with puzzles and games, using touch screens,
picking up ocean dwellers at the touch tank, and hanging out at the new
shark nursery. It’s worth planning your visit around the feedings, talks,
and demonstrations by the aquarium’s staff.

Powerscourt Estate Gardens
Enniskerry
These gardens are the finest in Wicklow County, which is saying a lot,
because the county is known for its abundance of exceptionally beautiful
gardens. First laid out from 1745 to 1767, the gardens were redesigned in
Victorian style from 1843 to 1875. The gardens have many different facets,
among them a wooded glen graced with a stone round tower that was
modeled on Lord Powerscourt’s dining-room pepper pot, a magical moss-
covered grotto, a formal Italianate area with a circular pond and fountain
presided over by sculptures of winged horses, and a walled garden where
blazing roses cling to the stone. Don’t miss the moving pet cemetery, with
sweet monuments to various pets owned by the Powerscourt family, from
faithful dogs to a particularly prolific dairy cow. I recommend following
the route around the entire estate, which should take you a good hour to
two hours. Skip the tour of the house; it’s not very interesting.
Powerscourt Waterfall is down the road (see “Other cool things to see and
do,” later in this chapter).
Off the main Dublin-Wicklow Road (N11). By car: Take the N11 out of Dublin (it
becomes the new motorway M11), and follow signs for the garden. By bus: 44 from
Dublin to Enniskerry, or Alpine Coach (% 01-286-2547) from the Bray DART station
to the gardens. % 01-204-6000. Admission: Garden 8 ($13) adults, 7 ($11) students
and seniors, 5 ($8) children under 16, free for children under 5. Open: House and
gardens daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m. (gardens close at dusk in winter). Suggested visit:
2–3 hours.
Wicklow Mountains National Park
Glendalough
This park, covering nearly 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres), encompasses
forest, hills, and large mountain bogs, and protects such wildlife as the
rare peregrine falcon. The park centers on beautiful Glendalough
(reviewed earlier in this section) and includes Glendalough Valley and the
Glendalough Wood Nature Reserve. An information office (open daily at
the Upper Lake during the summer and on weekends from about
September through about June) offers information on hiking in the park,
including route descriptions and maps, and organizes free nature walks
(call or check the Web site for the schedule). A tough stretch of the
Wicklow Way (described in the next section, “Outdoor activities”), runs
through the park. In May and October, the park hosts two-day walking fes-
tivals. The best maps of trails are available from Harvey Maps in England
(% 01786-841202; www.harveymaps.co.uk).
Take the N11 to R755 from Dublin; the R752 to R755 from Wicklow. The Information
Point is located by Upper Lake, R756 off R755. % 0404-45-425 or 0404-45-656.

The ideal picnic spot
Just beyond Avondale House is the famed Meeting of the Waters, where the
Avonmore and Avonbeg rivers come together. This spot is so beautiful, it inspired
Thomas Moore to write: “There is not in the wide world a valley so sweet / as the vale
in whose bosom the bright waters meet.” Pack some fruit, bread, and cheese and
head to this spot, 5km (3 miles) south of Rathdrum heading toward Arklow on the R752

Other cool things to see and do

forest valley, this house was the birthplace and home of one of
Ireland’s great leaders, Charles Stewart Parnell (1846–1891), who
fought for Irish home rule and for land reform. The Georgian house
has been restored beautifully and features original furniture and a
museum illustrating Parnell’s life and career. The grounds are
lovely, and you’re free to explore along a number of well-marked
nature trails, including a pretty 51⁄2km (31⁄2-mile) walk along the river.
Avondale is a center of Irish forestry, and its grounds have served
as a model of forest preservation for the country.

Hitting the Pubs
Cartoon Inn
Rathdrum
Make sure you don’t snort Guinness through your nose as you laugh at the
cartoons on the wall of this pub, many of which were drawn by famous
cartoonists. Ireland’s annual Cartoon Festival is held in Rathdrum in early
summer. You can get lunch here too.
28 Main St. % 0404-46-774.
The Meetings
Vale of Avoca
Nestled in the beautiful Vale of Avoca, The Meetings is a Tudor-style pub
that’s popular with visitors to Wicklow. You can get good pub grub all day
and listen to traditional music on weekend nights. Plus, when the
weather’s warm, you can sit outside on the patio and take in the view. It’s
clearly geared to tourists, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. After all,
how many pubs provide a Bureau de Change and a crafts shop?

County Kildare
Welcome to horse country. A land of gentle hills and open grasslands,
County Kildare is home to hundreds of stud farms. And, of course, one
needs a place to race all these fine horses, so the county boasts three
large racetracks, including the Curragh, where the Irish Derby is held
each year.

The top attractions
Castletown House
Celbridge
This stately house was built in the early part of the 18th century for
William Connolly, the then Speaker of the Irish House of Commons. Its
grandeur is staggering, and it remains a standout in Irish architecture. The
mansion was built in the Palladian style, a Renaissance style meant to copy
the classicism of ancient Rome. The interior is decorated with Georgian
furnishings, and the main hall and staircase are covered with intricate plas-
terwork. Run by the state and open to the public, the house is worth the
drive — about 16km (10 miles) northeast of Naas. Access is by guided tour
only.
From Dublin, take the N4 west, picking up the R403 several miles out of the city.
Located on the R403 just before you reach the village of Celbridge. By bus: 67 and 67A

Irish National Stud and Japanese Gardens

One of the foremost horse breeding grounds in the country, the National
Stud is consistently ranked as one of Ireland’s top-20 tourist attractions.
You can see the majestic horses being groomed and exercised, and during
spring, you can ooh and aah over the mares with their foals. Check out the
Horse Museum, with exhibits on racing, hunting, and show jumping, plus
the skeleton of the famed horse Arkle, who won several racing victories in
the 1960s.
On the same grounds are the striking Japanese Gardens, which boast

exford, Waterford, Tipperary, and Kilkenny are among Ireland’s
Southeast counties, and are often referred to as the sunny
Southeast because they generally enjoy more sunshine than the rest of
the country. This area is not full of Ireland’s greatest hits; instead, the
region offers many lesser-known but just as intriguing attractions and
activities — such as strolling through tiny fishing villages in Wexford,
watching the famous Waterford Crystal being created in Waterford, wan-
dering the medieval streets of Kilkenny, or exploring the Rock of Cashel
in Tipperary, to name a few.
County Wexford
County Wexford is one of the unsung treasures of Ireland, offering
myriad peaceful beaches, rolling hills, winding rivers, great traditional
music, and, in my opinion, some of the friendliest people in all of Ireland.
If you’re looking for don’t-miss attractions, you may find Wexford disap-
pointing, but if you’re interested in wandering along beaches and down
the streets of fishing villages, chatting with locals, hearing excellent
impromptu Irish music, and visiting a number of very well-done muse-
ums, such as the Irish National Heritage Park, you’re in for a treat.

The county’s largest town is Wexford Town (see the map of the same
name), a sweet and pretty harbor town that attracts Ireland’s yuppies
for weekend trips (lots of chi-chi clothing stores stand amidst the main
street’s cute bakeries and pubs). Along with Enniscorthy, Wexford Town
is a great base for exploring the county.
County Wexford was the heartbeat of the 1798 rebellion, when Irish
rebels took a brave stand against the strong arm of the Brits, and it was
at Vinegar Hill, near Enniscorthy, where 20,000 rebels were massacred
by English cannons, effectively ending that rebellion. As a result, you
may encounter a ferocious pride in Irish freedom in these parts.

You’ll feel at home immediately at this welcoming Victorian B&B, run by
sweet and charming Kay and Seamus McMenamin, who offer what just may
be Ireland’s best breakfast. The good-size bedrooms are furnished eclec-
tically, with some antiques and some modern touches. The linens are
scented with lavender, and the beds are so comfortable that you’d be
tempted to sleep in each morning if it weren’t for the scent of Kay’s gour-
met breakfast wafting up the stairs. A former restaurant owner and chef,
Kay treats her guests to an array of breakfast choices, from fresh-caught
fish to light-as-a-cloud pancakes dusted with sugar. Sides, such as home-
made marmalade made with whiskey, oranges, and brown sugar and thick,
tangy homemade yogurt, accompany your breakfast. The B&B is in
Wexford Town, about a five-minute walk from the bus and train station, so
it’s perfect for those without a car.

extends to the menu, which offers local meats and produce with interest-
ing modern twists, such as a potato side dish folded into a spring-roll wrap-
per. Menu standouts include salmon wrapped in seaweed with white wine
sauce, crab beignets, chicken cakes with ginger and garlic, and a steak filet
with a brie fritter. Service is attentive and unobtrusive.

century, is closed for renovations right now but should be open in 
2010 (call the Enniscorthy Tourist Information Centre for information:
% 053-923-4699).
Driving the Hook Peninsula
There’s so much to see on this small foot of land in southwest County
Wexford that it’s worth spending the afternoon driving and walking parts
of the lovely 201km (125-mile) Slí Charman (Wexford’s Coastal Pathway).
Highlights include the richly ornamented ruins of Tintern Abbey (% 051-
56-2650; daily mid-June to Sept), near Saltmills, with its walled gardens,
fortified bridge, and maze of ancient paths; Ballyhack Castle (% 051-
38-9468; Apr–Sept), with displays on the Crusades; Slade Castle, an amaz-
ing fortress ruin near the Hook Lighthouse (% 051-39-7055; year-round),
one of the oldest lighthouses in Europe; Duncannon Fort (% 051-38-9454;
June–Sept), built to fend off attacks from the Spanish Armada; and the mag-
nificent ruins of Dunbrody Abbey (3km/4 miles beyond Duncannon; May
through mid-Sept). All of the sites listed here have minimal admissions
fees, usually about 1.50 to 3 ($2.40–$4.80) per adult.

Selskar Abbey
Wexford Town
The story behind this ruined abbey is oddly romantic: Our tale begins
when Alexander de la Roche left his fiancée behind to join the Crusades.
Hearing that he had been killed, his fiancée became a nun. However, de 
la Roche was very much alive and was so grieved at the state of affairs
upon his return that he joined an Augustinian order, and founded and
endowed the abbey at Selskar. If only they’d had cellphones! It is said that
Henry II did penance at the abbey for having Thomas à Becket beheaded.
Near the abbey are the ruins of a Church of Ireland church from the 1800s.
When the congregation at this church merged with a nearby congregation,
the church roof was removed so that no rent would be required on the
building.
Westgate Street. You are free to roam around the site when the gates are unlocked.
If gates are locked, let someone at the Westgate Heritage Center know, and they will

tor center with an audiovisual show and exhibits.

More cool things to see and do
 The Bullring: The first declaration of an Irish Republic was made
here in 1798, and a statue memorializes the men who fought for
Irish independence at that time. The name of the area comes from
the bloody sport of bull-baiting that took place here in the 17th cen-
tury. There is a weekly outdoor market here on Friday mornings.
Location: Off Quay Street, Wexford Town. Suggested visit: A few
minutes.
 Curracloe Beach and a Cycling Trip: This beach is where the
opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan were filmed. It is home to
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast

many migratory birds and is a popular swimming destination
during the summer. A nature trail leads you through the sand dunes
here. From Wexford, the road up through Curracloe to Blackwater
makes an excellent day-long bike trip. Visit Hayes Cycle Shop, 108
S. Main St. (% 053-912-2462), to rent a bike and get directions.
Location: The beach is 11km (7 miles) northeast of Wexford Town
on the R742. Suggested visit: A couple hours to swim or a full day if
you bike here.
 John Barry Monument: “Who’s John Barry?” you ask. No less than
the father of the American Navy! Barry bravely went to the colonies
and signed up for the Revolutionary War to fight against the British.
He was captain of the famous ship the Lexington and, in 1797, was
appointed by George Washington as commander-in-chief of the
brand-spanking-new U.S. Navy.
Location: Crescent Quay, Wexford Town. Suggested visit: Enough
time to give him a salute and snap a photo.
 The National 1798 Visitor Centre: The story of the United
Irishmen’s first rebellion against the British is told in multimedia
pomp at this small but interesting museum. The museum engages
visitors with objects, an audiovisual presentation, and interactive
computer programs. If it’s nice outside, this is a great place for a
picnic.

 Westgate Heritage Tower: Before exploring Wexford Town, you
may want to stop by this heritage center, housed in one of the five
original gate towers along the Viking city walls. A well-done film, In
Selskar’s Shadow, relates the rich history of Wexford Town, and a
gallery on the first floor sells beautiful handcrafted gifts made by
Wexford artisans. Craftspeople work in the tower, and you may be
able to visit their workshops.

mostly, but also accessories such as scarves and hats. Westgate Design,
22 N. Main St., Wexford Town (% 053-912-3787), offers a large selection of 
Irish crafts, from wool clothing to pottery to jewelry. A family of silver- and

Antique Tavern
Enniscorthy
A black-and-white Tudor-style exterior makes this place easy to find.
Inside, the dark and cozy pub is full of antiques (hence the name). Check

Macken’s, The Cape of Good Hope
Wexford Town
As you venture into Wexford’s famous Bullring area, you’re sure to do a
double-take when you see Macken’s: The awning over the entrance adver-
tises a bar, undertaker, and grocery. And it’s no joke — you can have a pint,
pick up a loaf of bread, and make funeral arrangements in one convenient
stop! Irish rebels made Macken’s a popular meeting place over the cen-
turies, and mementos from their struggles line the walls. Definitely a place
like no other.

This simply decorated, homey pub, which was the winner of Les Routiers’

Visiting County Waterford 
and Waterford City
Waterford City is the oldest town in Ireland, founded by Viking invaders
in the ninth century. It’s a cute town to explore, but aside from the
Waterford Treasures museum and the historic area surrounding
Reginald’s Tower, there isn’t a whole lot to see in the city (the Waterford
Crystal Factory is outside the city).
The main reasons to come to this county are to take the superb tour of
the Waterford Crystal Factory and to ramble around the county’s lovely
coastal villages and ethereal inland mountains.
Getting to and around Waterford City
If you’re driving, take N25 from Cork and the south, N24 from the west,
N19 from Kilkenny and points north, the N11 to the N30 to the N25 from
Dublin, or N25 from Wexford. Lismore is off the N72. A fast and cost-
effective route across Waterford Harbour, between Passage East, County
Waterford (16km/10 miles east of Waterford), and Ballyhack, County
Wexford (32km/20 miles west of Wexford), is provided by Passenger East
Car Ferry (% 051-38-2480). See “Getting to and around County
Wexford,” near the beginning of this chapter, for more details.

Waterford is an easily walkable city. Stroll up the Quays toward
Reginald’s Tower, take a right, and you’re in the heart of town. You need
a car to get out to the Waterford Crystal Factory, though, unless you take
a taxi; you can catch at Plunkett Station on the Quay (call Rapid Cabs at
% 051-85-8585 if you need one to pick you up). The fare should be
around 10 ($16). If you’re parking your car here, buy parking disks at
local shops near the block you’re parking on or at the tourist office.
Hotels in the city center generally have their own parking areas.

Days Hotel Waterford
$$
Waterford City
This large hotel overlooking the River Suir is one of the oldest in Waterford,
but it has been updated to provide every modern comfort. It’s run like a

tight ship by the Treacy family but has a friendly, jovial atmosphere.
Bedrooms are spacious and bright, and two in-house restaurants are reli-
able places to get a good meal.
1 The Quay. Take The Quay to the foot of the Ignatius Rice Bridge. % 051-87-7222.

Dooley’s Hotel
$$$
Waterford City
This family-run hotel offers bright, generic hotel rooms right in the center
of Waterford City. Service is top-notch. The hotel’s pub serves tasty,
budget-friendly meals, and the Continental cuisine at the hotel’s New Ship
restaurant is filling and well-prepared.

Foxmount Country House
$$
Passage East
This 17th-century B&B is only 15 minutes away from Waterford City, but
you’ll feel as though you’re in the middle of nowhere — in a good way. The
imposing ivy-covered house sits on a large stretch of stunningly land-
scaped grounds with grand trees, flowers, and a paddock where four
horses and a donkey reside. The house is located on a working dairy farm,
so you may catch a glimpse of a herd of cows. Want to relax? Head out to
the peaceful herb garden at the back of the house. Looking to stretch your
legs? Ramble down one of the dirt roads, past emerald pastures. Rooms
have beautiful views and are spacious and elegantly furnished with
antiques, and the large bathrooms feature comfortable tubs. Cordial host-
ess Margaret Kent serves a bang-up breakfast; I especially enjoyed the por-
ridge with honey, brown sugar, and exceptionally fresh cream, and the
tasty scrambled eggs. Head down the road for a pint at Jack Meade’s pub
(reviewed in “Hitting the pubs in County Waterford,” later in this section),
which looks as if it was transplanted from Middle Earth.
Passage East Road. Take Dunmore East Road from Waterford City for 6km (31⁄2 miles)
until you reach a fork where you see a garage. Take the left fork toward Passage
East, and keep right at the next junction. Turn right just before Jack Meade’s pub,
beside the bridge. % 051-87-4308. Fax: 051-87-4906. www.foxmountcountry
house.com. Rates: 130 ($208) double. No credit cards.
Waterford Castle Hotel & Golf Club
$$$$
Balinakill
Staying in this castle is like living a fairytale. Located on a private island in
the River Suir (accessible only by the castle’s car ferry), only 3.2km (2
miles) from Waterford City, the Norman castle and its Elizabethan-style
Chapter 14: Counties Wexford, Waterford, Tipperary, and Kilkenny 229

wings are filled with tapestries, large stone fireplaces, antiques, and oak-
paneled walls. All of the richly decorated rooms have stunning views. The
staff is warm and friendly, and golf lovers will appreciate having a course
right in their backyard.

Dining locally in County Waterford
In addition to the places I list in this section, you can combine your
dinner with a river cruise aboard The Galley Cruising Restaurant.
Although you catch the boat on the River Barrow in New Ross, County
Wexford (see the review in “Dining locally in County Wexford,” earlier in
this chapter), the trip takes you down to the River Suir and through
County Waterford.
Bodega
$$
Waterford City
NEW IRISH
A Spanish wine bar vibe defines this new Waterford restaurant, which is
decorated with patio stone, warm amber lighting, built-in wooden wine
racks, and strings of lanterns and Christmas lights. The sounds of jazz and
Latin music are just audible against the buzz of laughter and clinking
glasses. The menu focuses on casual New Irish cuisine, including the excel-
lent lamb burger with mint crème fraiche, the superb mussels with french
fries, and the succulent duck served with berries and red wine sauce. The
raspberry sabayon, with crushed berries, mascarpone cheese, raspberry
sorbet, and crunchy anisette cookies, has to be one of the best desserts in
Ireland.
54 John St. % 051-844-177. Main courses: 16–27 ($26–$43). AE, MC, V. Open:
Mon–Wed noon to 5 p.m. and 5:30–10 p.m., Thurs–Sat noon to 5 p.m. and 5:30–

Café Goa
$$
Waterford City
INDIAN
This is a great place to people-watch in Waterford, with a cross-section of
the city, from families to club-going friends, passing through. The look here
is casual, with abstract paintings in red, black, and gold, and bistro tables
and chairs. The restaurant does a top-notch job with the Indian classics,
from a mild but delicious tikka masala to the toothsome aloo gobi (a chick
pea and potato dish) to the outstanding shrimp bhuna, with tomato, garlic,
ginger, and spices.

Jade Palace
$$–$$$$
Waterford City
CHINESE
Jade Palace offers authentic, mouthwatering Cantonese and Szechuan in
downtown Waterford. This is the kind of place where you tell the manager
what you think you’d like, let him decide for you, and then stuff yourself
silly. The steamed fish with ginger is excellent, and the early-bird menu,
served from 5 to 7 p.m. every night (17/$20), is quite a bargain. If you are
not ravenously hungry, you may want to get some pub food downstairs.
3 The Mall, next to Reginald’s Tower in the city center. % 051-85-5611. Main courses:
13–28 ($21–$45). AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri 12:30–2:30 p.m. and 5–11 p.m., Sat
5–11:30 p.m., Sun 12:30–10:30 p.m.
The Tannery
$$$–$$$$
Dungarvan
NEW EUROPEAN
This stylish, contemporary restaurant was an operating tannery until 1995.
The kitchen is wide open so that patrons can watch innovative chef Paul
Flynn in action. Flynn adds unique twists to whatever dish he’s cooking,
such as roast rump of lamb with spiced carrot, tomato, and chickpea
risotto or hot smoked duck served with spiced lentil sauce, chili, pineap-
ple, and buttered cabbage. The interior is minimalist — white dishes on
unadorned light-wood tables. The early-bird dinner (30/$32), served
Tuesday through Friday from 6 to 7:30 p.m., is a great deal.
10 Quay St. From Waterford or Cork, take the N25 to Dungarvan. % 058-45-420.

Treasures Museum at 11:45 a.m. and 1:45 p.m. and from the Granville

For self-guided hikes and walks, visit Waterford City’s tourist office (see
“Fast Facts: County Waterford,” at the end of this section) to pick up
route maps.
Lismore Castle Gardens
Lismore
The two gardens here (upper and lower) are wonderfully varied, with
riotously bright blossoms, apple trees, and a kaleidoscope of roses, all set
against the backdrop of a still-occupied 12th-century castle. Because this
Chapter 14: Counties Wexford, Waterford, Tipperary, and Kilkenny 231

is an inhabited castle, you can’t tour the inside (however, if you’ve come
into some money, you can stay in the castle when the duke is not in resi-
dence). The magical yew tree walk in the lower garden is where Edmund
Spenser is said to have written the Faerie Queen. Be sure to budget enough
time to see the upper garden, which is bigger than the lower garden and
boasts a thriving vegetable plot. This is a lovely place for a picnic.
Lismore. % 058-54-424. Admission: 6 ($7.20) adults, 3 ($3.60) kids 16 and under.
Open: Apr–May and Sept–Oct daily 1:45–4:45 p.m., and St Patrick’s Day–September
30 11 a.m.–4:45 p.m. Suggested visit: 11⁄2 hours.
Reginald’s Tower
Waterford City
Restored to its medieval appearance and furnished with appropriate
medieval artifacts, this small but significant landmark in the heart of
Waterford City is worth the three-story climb to the top. The tower was
built by a Viking governor in 1003 and is Ireland’s oldest standing building
in continuous use. It has been used in many different capacities — as a
mint, a fortress, a prison, and an air-raid shelter. It is said that Norman
leader Strongbow married Celtic Aoife (Eva) here, beginning a bond
between the Norman invaders and the native Irish. Guided tours are avail-
able on request.
The Quay. % 051-30-4220. Admission: 2.10 ($3.40) adults, 1.30 ($2.10) seniors,
1.10 ($1.80) students and children. Open: Easter–May and Oct 10 a.m.–5 p.m.,
June–Sept 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Nov–Easter Wed–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Suggested visit: 1
hour.
South East Coastal Drive
This well-marked drive takes you along the coast through the beautiful
seaside towns of Tramore, Dunmore, and Passage East. Along the way, you
encounter meandering rivers and tiny fishing villages. If you’d like to bike
this route, rent a bike from May to September from Altitudes Bike Store,
Part III: Dublin and the East Coast 
232
By Hook or by Crooke
Waterford is the only city in Ireland that was spared Oliver Cromwell’s brutal and
bloody 1649 attack, though not through lack of effort. He attempted to invade Waterford
from two routes, through Hook Head and Crooke Village — neither of which is a direct
or easy way to enter Waterford. Both attempts failed. This event was the genesis of
the phrase “by hook or by crook” — when one resorts to unconventional and extreme
tactics to get something done.

Ballybricken Green, Waterford (% 051-87-0356). The route, about 80km
(50 miles), begins as you cross the bridge from Youghal on the N25 and
ends in Tramore.
The end points of the route are Youghal and Tramore. Out of Youghal, take the N25;
out of Tramore, take the R675.
The Vee Drive
This winding 18km (11-mile) drive leads you through the lush
Knockmealdown Mountains up to a stunning viewpoint of the farmland
laid out like a quilt below and the glowing Galtee Mountains beckoning in
the distance. The Vee Gap viewpoint, at the highest point of the drive,
opens onto a variety of walking trails. Look for the parking lot and a sign
mapping out the trails.
The endpoints of the signposted Vee drive are Lismore and Clogheen. From Lismore,
take the R668 or the R669 (hook up to the R669 via the N72). From Clogheen, take the
R668.
Waterford Crystal Factory
Kilbarry
What makes crystal shine brighter than regular glass? It’s a lead oxite
called litharge. You’ll be able to spout off this fact and many more after a
fascinating tour of the Waterford Crystal Factory, where you can watch the
factory’s craftspeople as they go about their daily work. You’ll be shown
every step of the meticulous process that goes into the creation of world-
renowned Waterford Crystal, from the blowing of the molten glass to the
engraving, which is done using a rotating copper wheel. You also get the
opportunity to ask questions and get up close to the action as a master
craftsperson cuts or engraves a piece. Talk about a stressful job: The
Waterford Crystal Factory has a six-step screening process for every piece
that’s made, and the glass blowers and craftspeople get paid only for per-
fect pieces. About 45 percent of pieces are destroyed for minor flaws, and
only perfect pieces of crystal make it out of the factory, which is why you’ll
never see Waterford seconds. Along the tour, you have a chance to see
some unique crystal pieces, including hefty sports trophies. Don’t leave
your camera in the car: you are welcome to take pictures on the tour. After
the tour, stop in the Waterford Crystal Gallery to stock up; pieces cost
about the same here as they do in most stores, so the main attraction is
the vast selection.
From Waterford, take the main road to Cork (N25); the factory is 8km (5 miles) outside
town on the right. % 051-33-2500. Tours: 10 ($16) adults, 7.50 ($12) seniors, 7
($11) students, free for kids under 12. Open: Mar–Oct tours daily 8:30 a.m.–4 p.m.,
showroom daily 8:30 a.m.–6 p.m.; Nov–Feb tours Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–3:15 p.m., showroom
daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Suggested visit: 2 hours.

Waterford Treasures Museum
Waterford City
This exceedingly well-done museum, housed in a gorgeously restored gran-
ary, presents artifacts that illustrate the history of Waterford from the
arrival of the Vikings almost 1,000 years ago up to the present. High-tech
interactive audiovisuals, including a ride on a Viking ship, are engaging
and entertaining, and the objects here are true treasures, from the sword
of King Edward IV to a variety of crystal items.
Merchant’s Quay. % 051-30-4500. Admission: 4 ($6.40) adults, 3 ($4.80) seniors

daily 9:30 a.m.–9 p.m., Apr–May and Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m., Oct–Mar daily 10
a.m.–5 p.m. Suggested visit: 2–3 hours.
Shopping in Waterford City
In addition to the choices listed here, you may want to pay a visit to the
Waterford Crystal Factory store (reviewed in the previous section). At
150 years old, Kelly’s, 75–76 The Quay, Waterford City (% 051-87-3557),
is one of the oldest businesses in town, selling crafts, linens, Aran
sweaters, Waterford Crystal, and Belleek pottery.
Hitting the pubs in County Waterford
Jack Meade’s
Ballycanavan
This cozy, low-ceilinged pub with crackling fireplaces is located under a
stone bridge a few miles out of town and is well worth the drive. Locals
tell stories in the bar, and the pub serves great food. During the summer,
point yourself in the direction of the banner reading “BBQ,” where you’ll
find excellent steaks, garlicky mushrooms, and other treats, all cheerfully
served at picnic tables.
Checkpoint Road, Halfway House. % 051-85-0950.

The Munster (also known as Fitzgerald’s) is superbly decorated with
Waterford Crystal, antique mirrors, and wood walls taken from the old
Waterford toll bridge. This place is a favorite with Waterford locals.

Roaming in County Tipperary
County Tipperary and its towns are certainly not bustling in any way
whatsoever, but that’s what makes this place so special: It’s the fantasy
of a quiet, rolling, green Ireland come true. Because there are a limited
number of attractions, one or two days should suffice here, unless
you’re looking for a long getaway retreat.
Quite a long way to Tipperary
While you’re moseying around and hitting the pubs, you’re likely to hear the song “It’s a
Long Way to Tipperary,” a happy yet plaintive tune about an Irishman in England miss-
ing his home. The song was actually composed by Englishman Jack Judge — a man
who’d never been to Ireland in his life! He chose the town’s name for his song simply
because it rhymed well. The song is perhaps best known by Americans as the tune that
the cast of The Mary Tyler Moore Show sang as they left the station for the last time.

Getting to and around County Tipperary
If you’re coming by car, take the N8 from Cork or Dublin (via N7) to

Exploring County Tipperary: The top attractions
The Cashel Heritage Centre (% 062-62-511) has a model of the city of
Cashel in 1640, accompanied by an audio tape describing what you are
seeing. Entrance is free and the center is open June through September
daily 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., and October through May Monday to
Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
The Rock of Cashel
Cashel
The word “rock” doesn’t really do justice to this giant limestone outcrop-
ping crowned with spectacular medieval ruins.
The Rock of Cashel was the seat of the kings of Munster from about A.D.
360 to 1101 and was probably also a center of Druidic worship at this time.
Legend places St. Patrick in Cashel in about A.D. 432 for his famous expla-
nation of the Holy Trinity. He is said to have shown the pagans a shamrock
to illustrate the relationship of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Legend
also has it that this is the place where St. Patrick converted the local king,
King Aenghus, and baptized him. In the 11th century, Ireland’s most impor-
tant high king, Brian Boru, was crowned king of Ireland here (which
explains the presence of the Brú Ború Heritage Centre nearby — see the
next listing).
At the summit of the rock, you can explore the shell of the 13th-century
St. Patrick’s Cathedral, which was gutted in a fire set by Cromwell’s troops.
You can also visit the 28m-high (92-ft.) round tower, which is well-pre-
served. Don’t miss the Romanesque Cormacs Chapel, located on a dra-
matic outcrop, which is decorated with carved beasts and human figures.
The unique St. Patrick’s Cross (a replica — the original is in the museum)
has the carved figure of St. Patrick on one side and Jesus on the other. The
roofless cathedral is the largest building on the Rock; it was never restored
after Cromwell’s men set fire to it (along with the villagers hiding inside).
An interpretive center, housed in the beautifully restored Vicar’s Choral, has
great views for photos, contains stone carvings and silver religious artifacts,
and offers a 15-minute audiovisual display. I highly recommend joining one
of the tours, which really helps you to envision the life of the buildings.

Brú Ború Heritage Centre & Theatre

Located next to the Rock of Cashel, the Heritage Centre’s central attrac-
tion is its theater, which resonates with the sounds of well-played tradi-
tional Irish music on most nights. An exhibit relates the intriguing history
of Irish music (the connection between this place and Brian Ború is that
Ború was a harper). In addition to the theater and exhibit (5/$8 adults,

Cahir Castle
Cahir
This was a defensive castle from the 13th to 15th centuries and is one of
Ireland’s largest and best preserved castles. It sits on an island in the
middle of the River Suir. The walls and towers are in excellent condition,
and the interior is fully restored. The 20-minute audiovisual presentation
is interesting and covers the history of the castle and of the region’s other
historic sites. Engaging guided tours of the castle grounds are available
(the tour does not enter the castle, so be sure to see the inside of the castle
either before or after your tour). Attention, movie buffs: The castle was
used as the set for John Boorman’s film Excalibur.

Holy Trinity Church and Medieval Walls
Fethard
Sitting along the River Clashawley, the small town of Fethard (population:
under 1,000) claims the most complete circuit of medieval town walls in
Ireland. Enter the walled inner city at the cast-iron gateway on Abbey
Street, which opens into the pretty churchyard of Holy Trinity. The views
of the heather-strewn valley are best from the top of one of the towers,
and the castlelike church itself is a fine example of medieval construction.
Take the small road connecting Cashel and Windgap east from Cashel, or go north
off the N24 to Fethard. No telephone. Admission: Free. Open: No official hours, but the

Abbey Street gate of the town wall is often locked. During normal business hours,
you can get a key from Whytes grocery store, just a few doors down on Main Street.
And, if the church is closed and you want to enter, you can get a key from Dr. Stoke’s
office at the eastern end of Main Street. Suggested visit: 1 hour.
Shopping in County Tipperary
A band of rebel craftsmen left Waterford Crystal in 1988 to start Tipperary
Crystal Designs, Carrick-on-Suir (% 051-64-0543), where they produce
top-quality items, just as they did under their former label. These folks are
so good that they’re the only Irish crystal producer to supply prestigious
Tiffany & Co. The shop is located off N24, next to the Dovehill Castle.

city (see the “Kilkenny City” map) overflows with tourists during the
high season, but you can always get a breath of fresh air in the Kilkenny
countryside. Save some space in your luggage, because Kilkenny County
is one of the craft capitals of Ireland, with stores selling everything from
one-of-a-kind gold bracelets to richly colored pottery.

$$ Kilkenny City
I have a whole stack of accolades for Yvonne and John Dalton, who are
hailed as some of the most helpful and genial hosts in Ireland. The Daltons
can help you plan your itinerary in Kilkenny City (the center of the
medieval town is a ten-minute walk away from the guesthouse) and the
surrounding area. Rooms are modern, comfortable, and cheerful, and the
continental breakfast (which you’ll find in the room) makes a nice break
from the usual Irish fry-up.

Carriglea House

Kilkenny City
This B&B has everything: It’s a 5-minute walk from Kilkenny Castle and the
center of town, has one of the nicest and most helpful proprietors this side
of the Atlantic, and is a beautiful house. Bedrooms are comfortable, airy,
and homey, and furnished with antiques. Owner Josephine O’Reilly greets
you with tea and cookies in the lovely sitting room. The breakfast is one
to write home about, with the usual offerings, plus homemade scones,
omelets, and pancakes with maple syrup.

Butler House
$$$
Kilkenny City
Not many places could pull off modern abstract artwork alongside
Georgian-era designs on plastered ceilings, but ivy-covered Butler House
does it with style. Built in the 1770s as part of the Kilkenny Castle Estate,
Butler House effortlessly blends the traditional elements of the building
with contemporary design. Rooms are spacious, soothing, and airy; each
is decorated uniquely, and many feature cream and deep orange colors.
Bathrooms are sparkling and up-to-date. Try to book a room overlooking
the formal courtyard gardens, with a view of the castle, which is lit up at
night. The thoughtful and friendly staff will happily recommend an area
restaurant or attraction to suit you. The excellent location puts you right
next to the castle and Kilkenny Design Centre, and a short walk from most
other Kilkenny City attractions.

Kilkenny
If you’re overdosed on ornate, cluttered Victorian bedrooms, rush your-
self to Zuni for an antidote of clean, Asian-inspired minimalist décor. The
13 guest rooms here are simply furnished in black, white, and deep red,
with beds that make you want to sleep late. The location is fabulous —
less than a five-minute walk to Kilkenny’s main thoroughfare. The hotel’s
sleek restaurant, one of the hottest eateries in Kilkenny, serves lively
dishes from all over the world, from tempura to Moroccan lamb. The
friendly, helpful staff goes above and beyond to make your stay pleasant — 
when I left my globetrotting stuffed elephant in one of the rooms, they sent
it out to me in Dublin the very next day.

Pordylos Restaurant
$$$
Kilkenny City
INTERNATIONAL
A concierge at a Kilkenny hotel told me that two of the hotel’s guests loved
Pordylos so much that they ate dinner there all eight nights of their stay.
And I believe it. Warm and romantic, with wood-beamed ceilings, 16th-cen-
tury stone walls, and hanging plants, Pordylos invites long, lingering meals
and rambling conversation. You can discourse over dishes that draw from
cuisines all over the world, such as plump mussels bathed in a lemongrass,
coconut, and green curry brew; tagliatelli pasta with blackened Cajun
chicken, bacon, and a spicy tomato-and-basil cream sauce; and vanilla
risotto with spinach, butternut squash, green peas, and citrus crème
fraiche.

Kilkenny City
ITALIAN
Two large Renaissance portraits dominate this restaurant’s romantically-

racks add to the ambience. Service is formal, and guests dress up. The
Italian fare is fresh and full of flavor, and the homemade pasta puts dried
pasta to shame. The menu runs from traditional pasta dishes to fish and
meat offerings such as calf’s liver in a cream sauce with brandy. I recom-
mend the baked bruschetta (served hot); the well-spiced, generous meat-
balls; and the Tortelloni al Pomodoro: crescent-shaped pasta stuffed with
ricotta cheese and spinach, served with a chopped tomato, basil, garlic,
and white wine sauce.

Exploring County Kilkenny
Pat Tynan leads walking tours through the medieval streets of Kilkenny,
relating the history of the area and some local lore. A highlight is a little
visit to one of the city’s old jail cells. This is a great way to get a sense of
the layout of Kilkenny City and a grasp of this region’s history. Tours leave
from the Kilkenny Tourist Office, located in the Tourist Information Shee
Alms House in Rose Street. Departure times are mid-March through Octo-
ber Monday through Saturday at 10:30 a.m., 12:15 p.m., 3 p.m., and 4:30
p.m.; Sunday at 11:15 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. Pat will set up tours November

The best attractions
If you’re lucky enough to be in Kilkenny on a Tuesday, swing by the

An underground river formed these large limestone caverns, which con-
tain some of the most beautiful formations in Ireland. The cave was the

site of a Viking massacre in A.D. 928, and Viking artifacts are on display.

verse the caverns.

utes before closing time). Inaccessible for wheelchairs. Suggested visit: About 
1 hour.
Kilkenny Castle
Kilkenny City
This 12th-century medieval castle, which was remodeled in Victorian
times, cuts quite the storybook-castle profile and is the principal attraction
in the town of Kilkenny. Surrounded by 20 hectares (50 acres) of grounds,
including rolling parklands, a riverside walk, and formal gardens, the castle
was home to the distinguished Butler family from the late 14th century to
the mid-20th century. Guided tours of the castle take you through restored
rooms, where you learn a bit about the Butler dynasty as you admire the
period furnishings (rooms are decorated as they were in the 1830s). A
highlight of the tours is a visit to the 45m-long (150-ft) Long Gallery, which
houses portraits of the Butler family and has a beam ceiling gorgeously
decorated with painted Celtic knots. The castle’s Butler Gallery hosts
modern art exhibits. Tours fill up fast, so get to the castle early to sign up
for one. And be sure to stop by the play area if you have kids.

Jerpoint Abbey
Thomastown
This Cistercian abbey is considered one of the best-preserved monastic
ruins in the country. It houses Celtic crosses and unique stone carvings of
knights and dragons. There’s a ton to see as you tiptoe through the grave-
yard and 15th-century cloister grounds. The small visitors’ center provides
information about the history of the carvings and abbey. I highly recom-
mend taking a tour if possible.

St. Canice’s Cathedral
Kilkenny
This 13th-century church has a beautiful Gothic interior, restored after
Cromwell stabled his horses here and destroyed many of the windows,
tombs, and monuments in 1650. Check out the four colors of marble used
on the floor (green from Connemara, red from Cork, gray from Tyrone, and
black from Kilkenny) and the sculpted knight-and-lady effigies on the
memorials that pepper the cathedral. The round tower on this site was
built around A.D. 849, and you can climb the 167 steps that lead to the top
of the tower; it’s worth some huffing and puffing for the phenomenal views.

Shopping in County Kilkenny
County Kilkenny is a center for crafts and design, and the town of
Bennettsbridge (6km/4 miles south of Kilkenny City on the R700) is a
focal point. Here and in surrounding locations, you find the workshops
of potters, woodworkers, glassblowers, and other craftspeople. If this
interests you, be sure to pick up the Kilkenny Craft Trail brochure from
the tourist office, which will give you details for and directions to a
number of workshops.
One of the most popular workshops you’ll find in Bennettsbridge is
Nicholas Mosse Pottery (% 056-77-27-505; www.nicholasmosse.com).
Expert potter Mosse uses the River Nore to produce the electricity to
fire his pots, and each piece is hand-thrown. The earthenware clay pot-
tery, sold as individual pieces or in sets, is hand-painted with charming
country themes such as flowers, fruits and vegetables, and farm animals.
The shop also sells Nicholas Mosse glassware and linens, plus furniture,
jewelry, and other items from some of Ireland’s best craftspeople. Be
sure to check out the seconds (slightly imperfect works) upstairs for
good deals.
In Kilkenny Town, Faller’s Sweater Shop, 75 High St. (% 056-77-70-599),
stocks all sorts of tasteful knitwear, from fishermen sweaters to cloaks.
And ladies and gentlemen, hold on to your credit cards, because
Kilkenny Design Centre, Castle Yard, Kilkenny (% 056-77-22-118),
stocks a large selection of Ireland’s best handcrafted items, including
pottery, linen, jewelry, glassware, clothing, fine art, and leatherwork. Be

browse.

Kyteler’s Inn
Kilkenny City
This 650-year-old coaching inn is named for Dame Alice Kyteler, who ran
the place in the 17th century. Kyteler, who buried four husbands, was
accused of witchcraft. She fled to England, but her maid was not so lucky — 
she was burned at the stake. The cozy upstairs bar buzzes with conver-
sation and live music. Downstairs, enjoy some good pub grub in a medieval
cellar featuring the original stone walls and columns. You may be graced
by the presence of Ms. Kyteler herself — she’s rumored to haunt the place,
so make sure she doesn’t slip anything into your stew.

ork City (Chapter 15) is a happening big city with the
soul of a small town. It has a nice selection of restau-
rants, an interesting arts scene, proximity to many attrac-
tions, and some very friendly locals.
The south and southwest counties certainly have their share
of natural beauty, with the gorgeous beaches, seascapes, and
hills of West Cork (Chapter 15), the peaceful woodlands and
lakes of Killarney National Park (Chapter 16), and the stun-
ning mountains, cliffs, beaches, and sea views of the popular
Ring of Kerry and Dingle Peninsula (both in Chapter 16).

ounty Cork (see the nearby map) occupies the eastern half of
Southern Ireland and encompasses the country’s second-largest
city (Cork City); one of its most beautiful golf courses (at the Old Head
of Kinsale); a host of historical sights; and, bar none, the most famous
rock on the island: the Blarney Stone. Pucker up!
Many travelers breeze into Cork City, look around, stop at Blarney Castle
on the way out for a quick smooch, and then head right for Killarney. Big
mistake. The stretch of coast from the lovely seaside town of Kinsale to
the tip of the Beara Peninsula is just too beautiful to pass up. More and
more people are finding out about West Cork’s unspoiled beauty, so
come now before the real crowds start showing up. East Cork is a gentle
land that boasts several wonderful guesthouses; the pretty harbor town
of Cobh; and some great attractions, including Fota Wildlife Park. Stick
around a while.
Cork City and East County Cork
The first thing you notice about Corkonians is that they have a fierce
pride in their city, which they have nicknamed “The People’s Republic of
Cork.” And they should be proud of Cork; it manages to have a small-
town, friendly feel while offering many things that a large city should,
including a lively arts scene and quite a few great restaurants. That said,
there aren’t a whole lot of attractions in the city itself, and Cork City is
better used as an urban base for visiting the surrounding areas than as
multiday destination in itself (you can take in the highlights of the city in
a day). East County Cork is home to popular attractions such as the
Blarney Stone and Castle and Fota Wildlife Park, and the sweet seaside
town of Cobh.

Cork City
Chapter 15: County Cork 253

Getting to Cork City and East County Cork
To get to Cork City by car, take the N25 west from Waterford, the N20
south from Limerick, or the N22 east from Kilkenny. The towns of east
County Cork are located off the N25. If you’re coming to Cork City from
the east, you can save lots of time by taking the Carrigaloe-Glenbrook
Ferry (% 021-481-1485) between Cobh on the east side of the bay and
Ringaskiddy (16km/10 miles south of Cork) on the west side. The scenic
trip takes only about five minutes and runs year-round, 7:15 a.m. to 12:05
a.m. daily. The cost is 6 ($9.60) round-trip or 4 ($6.40) one-way.
Irish Rail (% 1850-366-222; www.irishrail.ie) serves Cork City, Fota,
and Cobh regularly; and Bus Éireann (% 01-836-6111; www.buseireann.
ie) serves Cork City, Cobh, Youghal, and other cities throughout County
Cork daily. The main bus depot in Cork City is located at the Travel
Centre, Parnell Place, Cork, and the rail station is located at Lower
Glanmire Road, about a 20-minute walk northeast of the city center.
Getting around Cork City
Cork City is best seen by foot, because most of the smaller roads and
alleys are open exclusively to pedestrian traffic. In addition, the city can
be confusing to find your way around in by car, because the city’s River
Lee forks and winds, and creates two sets of quays (wharves or piers).
Although roads are not as narrow as in most towns, the one-way streets
can be frustrating when you’re carried across a bridge you didn’t mean
to cross, or you see where you want to go but can’t quite seem to get
there.
If you do have a car, either park at your hotel if it’s convenient or park
when you get downtown, and see the city by foot. Parking in Cork City
runs on a disc system. You can purchase discs at convenience stores all
over the city. Or you can make use of one of the city’s eight multistory
parking garages (some central ones are on Lavitt’s Quay (near Paul
Lane) or North Main Street (near Bachelor’s Quay), and off Grand
Parade). St. Patrick’s Street is the city’s hub for shopping, and Oliver
Plunkett Street is the main place for a Cork City pub-crawl. If you need a
taxi in town, call Taxi Co-Op (% 021-427-2222).
It’s best to have a car for getting to and from attractions and towns in
east County Cork. All the major car-rental companies have offices at
Cork Airport (see p. 457 for car-rental contact information). Bus Éireann
(% 01-836-6111) operates local service around Cork City to neighboring
towns such as Blarney, Cobh, and Fota. Most buses leave from the
Parnell Place Bus Station. If you need a taxi in the outlying towns, call
Castle Cabs (% 021-438-2222) in Blarney and Harbour Cabs (% 021-
481-4444) in Cobh.

Spending the night in Cork City and East County Cork
Ballymakeigh House
$$$
Killeagh
This is one of my favorite accommodations in all of Ireland. A quiet, casual,
beautifully managed farmhouse, it’s the kind of place that makes you feel
that all is right with the world, especially as you gaze at the blue dusk set-
tling on the dairy cows in the field. The soothing, comfortable bedrooms
feature knotty-pine furniture, luxurious comforters, and well-chosen, eclec-
tic art — my room had a painting of the tropics and a large photograph of
the Golden Gate Bridge. And then there’s the food. Oh, wow. Your warm
and friendly hostess, Margaret Browne, happens to be a professional gour-
met cook. Her breakfasts are delicious, and if you book before 5 p.m., she
will create a glorious six-course dinner for you, using the freshest of local
ingredients, including flowers from around her property. Don’t miss the
dinner — it may turn out to be the best meal of your whole trip. This is a
fantastic place for couples looking for a romantic escape.
Killeagh. The house is 9.5km (6 miles) west of Youghal off the N25; look for the signs.

Fernroyd House
$$
Cork City
This recently opened B&B just may give Garnish House (see below) some
serious competition. Located on a quiet street about a ten-minute walk
from the center of the city, Fernroyd House offers rooms that are simplic-
ity itself, with pretty white quilts on the bed and bright little reading lamps.
Hosts Avril and Tony Lyons couldn’t be more helpful and welcoming, and
their breakfasts (with many choices, including Avril’s homemade scones)
will get you right out of bed in the morning.

Cork City
This townhouse B&B is the best in the city. The large rooms are sweet,
soothing, and stylish, boasting brightly painted walls, beds that are an
ocean of white sheets and blankets, a bowl filled with fresh fruit, and
another bowl with flowers floating in it. Breakfasts are legendary — you’d
need a full year of mornings to sample every single treat that friendly host-
ess Hansi Lucey offers, and I’m willing to bet that you’ll make multiple trips
to the buffet. The B&B is about a 20-minute walk from the heart of Cork
City. Check out the beautiful wood-framed photos of Ireland that decorate
the house.

A great location, a fabulous restaurant, and a courtyard garden featuring

are large and comfortable, and the two- and three-bedroom apartments
are an excellent deal if you’re traveling with several people.

Cork City
As at all the jewels in the Jurys Hotel crown, the service here is profes-
sional and efficient; and the rooms, refurbished in 2006, are modern and
attractive, with dark woods, quality fabrics, and luxury amenities such as
LCD TVs, air-conditioning (quite rare in Ireland), pillow-top beds, and
down duvets. As at most Jurys Hotels, the clientele are often business-
people. The enclosed grounds, featuring a walking path and pool, the new
spa, and a fully equipped gym make this hotel a standout.

Jurys Inn
$$–$$$
Cork City
The service is good, and the modern rooms are comfortable, but there’s
nothing exceptional about Jurys Inn — except the low price and the excel-
lent location, within a few minutes of the city center. A flat rate for up to
three adults or two adults and two children in a room makes this a good
deal for traveling families. Ask for a room away from the street if you’re a
light sleeper.

Aherne’s

SEAFOOD
This port-town restaurant has a reputation for serving the freshest and
tastiest seafood in this part of the country. New Englanders may never
order cod back home again after having it at Aherne’s. The seafood chow-
der is unmatched as well. If you’re really hungry, go for the award-winning
fish and shellfish platter. Aherne’s also has a luxurious hotel. If you don’t

want to shell out (pun intended) for the restaurant, the pub food, ranging
from lamb burgers to fresh fish platters, is also a great choice.
163 N. Main St. Take the main road to Waterford (N25), then turn off onto Main Street.

Café Paradiso
$$$$
Cork City
VEGETARIAN
Before you even sit down, you feel the vibe. This bright and electric restau-
rant is filled with books and toys and a certain . . . energy. Then there’s the
food: a vegetarian’s nirvana with an eclectic and fresh menu offering
dishes such as feta, pistachio, and couscous cakes with sweet-and-hot-
pepper relish, sweet-spiced kale, coriander yogurt, and chickpeas with
fresh chili and tomato; artichoke and sheep’s cheese mezzaluna with sage
butter and broad beans; and vegetable sushi with pickled ginger, wasabi,
and a dipping sauce, served with eggplant and cauliflower tempura. For
dessert, try the honey-roasted peaches with lavender ice cream and pis-
tachio biscotti. Is your mouth watering yet? After you dine, you can pur-
chase the Café Paradiso Cookbook and try out the recipes at home.

CAFE
Looking for a cute place to pop into as you explore Cobh? Check out El
Bistro, a bright spot that’s always buzzing with families and groups of
friends. Food is simple and delicious, from pasta to open-faced sand-
wiches. I highly recommend the Thai chicken curry.

IRISH
This casual little cafe is located on an indoor balcony overlooking the
bustling English Market (reviewed in the following section, “The top attrac-
tions”). It serves up excellent, rib-sticking traditional Irish food, made with
fresh local ingredients from the market below. This is the place to try tripe
and drisheen (blood sausages), specialties specific to County Cork. The
Irish stew is wonderful, as are the lighter dishes, such as quiches and sand-
wiches. This is a great place to get a taste of Cork food, and to get a taste
of Corkonians themselves, as locals frequent the place.

INTERNATIONAL/PIZZA
An informal restaurant that’s trendy but doesn’t act like it, Isaacs is an
amalgam of contemporary and traditional — much like Cork City itself.
Located in a converted Victorian warehouse with a vaulted ceiling, Isaacs
has redbrick walls adorned with local art pieces, as well as a chatty
evening crowd. The international cuisine, from salads to burgers to pizzas,
is reliably delicious.

shine. The chef takes advantage of seasonal local produce, so choosing a
dish that’s in season (such as wild salmon from mid-June through July) is
an excellent idea. The restaurant is located in the former Turkish baths,
giving it a chic and airy feel.

Cork City
CAFE
It was a dark and stormy day. I had just wandered all over the city, and was
craving some banoffee pie (that wonderful symphony of bananas and
toffee on a crumbled cookie crust). And lo and behold, I discovered this
casual cafe, home to not only an excellent banoffee pie, but other luscious
light dishes including salads, pizzas, baked potatoes, pastas, and soups.
The cafe also offers a tapas menu featuring such tasty bites as roasted pep-
pers with feta, garlic mussels, and spicy chorizo. The atmosphere is
relaxed, with small groups of friends chatting at the burnished copper
tables, and newspaper-readers relaxing on the comfy couches.

The Cork City Hop On/Hop Off Bus Tour (% 021-430-9090) is an open-
topped bus with a route that goes to most of Cork City’s major sights.
You can get on and off the bus at your leisure, joining the next bus after

(and every 30 minutes in July and Aug) from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., from the
end of March through the end of October. You can board at any of the

and 5 ($8) for seniors, students, and children. Call to confirm times
and meeting place, as they change each year.
The top attractions
Blarney Castle and Stone
Blarney
To kiss or not to kiss, that is the question. Yes, it’s touristy, but there is a
satisfaction that comes from kissing a hunk of rock that’s famous across
the world, and there is a fun camaraderie with your fellow smoochers as
you wait in line. The Blarney Stone, located at the top of the ruins of a 15th-
century castle (after a fair amount of climbing up narrow, twisting stair-
ways), allegedly imparts eloquence, or the gift of gab, to those daring
enough to contort upside down from the parapet walk and kiss it. It’s a
real feat to lean back into nothing and tip your head to kiss the smooth
rock — it may even be a little frightening to people afraid of heights (or
germs). It’s customary to tip the guy who holds your legs, and you may
want to give it over before he holds you over the faraway courtyard.
Blarney is one of the most fortified castles in Ireland — its walls are 5.5m
(18 ft.) thick in some parts. You can climb through the ruins of the castle,
exploring various rooms (including the “murder holes”) along the way.
Don’t leave Blarney without seeing the castle grounds, with their pretty
gardens. If you have no intention of puckering up and have explored 
(or will explore) other castle ruins, a trip out here is probably not worth
the time.
Off the N20 north of Cork City, heading toward Limerick. % 021-438-5252. By bus:
You can catch a Bus Éireann round trip to the castle from the bus station in Cork, at
Parnell Place. Admission: 10 ($16) adults, 8 ($13) students and seniors, 3.50

Cobh and Cobh Heritage Centre
Cobh
Cobh (pronounced cove) is a lovely seaside town, and a ramble by the
harbor and through the streets, with their vividly colored buildings, is a
great way to spend a morning or afternoon.
Cobh Harbor was the main point of departure for thousands of starving
Irish on their way to the United States during the Great Famine and for con-
victs being sent to Australia. It was also the last port of call for the ill-fated
Titanic and Lusitania. The heritage center, located in a beautiful restored
railway station, uses objects, dioramas, text, and sound to relate the sto-
ries of these ships and their connections with Cobh. The highlight is the
life-size replica of the inside of a ship full of convicts. You can almost feel
the waves battering the hull. This whole exhibit will be particularly inter-
esting to those whose relatives emigrated through Cobh.
If you want to know more about Cobh’s maritime history, book yourself
onto one of Michael Martin’s superb Titanic Trail Walking Tours (% 021-
481-5211), which will take you to locations connected to the doomed ship
as well as sites linked with the three million emigrants who left from Cobh.
Tours leave from the Commodore Hotel, in Cobh, at 11 a.m. daily from June
through August (call for times during the rest of the year). Tours cost
9.50 ($15) for adults and 4.75 ($7.60) for children under age 12.
Heritage Centre: Cobh Railway Station. % 021-481-3591. Admission: 7.10 ($11)
adults, 6 ($9.60) seniors and students, 4 ($6.40) children. Open: May–Oct daily 9:30
a.m.–6 p.m. (last admission 5 p.m.), Nov–Apr daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m. (last admission 4
p.m.). Suggested visit: 1 hour.
Crawford Art Gallery
Cork City
Recently renovated and expanded, the Crawford Art Gallery displays a
broad array of art, and hosts interesting and varied temporary exhibits.
Highlights of the museum include an extensive collection of classical Greek
and Roman sculpture casts, and many 19th- and early-20th-century Irish
works, including some gems by Jack B. Yeats.
Emmet Place. % 021-490-7855. Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
English Market
Cork City
This pretty, old-world, stone-floored food market, dating from 1786, is one
of the best in Ireland. The market was damaged by fire in 1980, but it has
been beautifully renovated, featuring the original cast-iron fountain,
columns, and railings. All sorts of meat, vegetables, fruits, sweets, breads,
and prepared foods are sold here, and the market is famous for its alley
full of sparkling fresh fish. Of the many stalls, locals recommend Arbutus
and the Alternative Bread Co. for bread, Kay O’Connell’s Fish Stall for fish,

On the Pig’s Back for sausages and meats, and O’Reilly’s for Cork special-
ties such as tripe and drisheen. This is the perfect place to get the makings
of a picnic, and Bishop Lucey Park, a little green park at Grand Parade, is
a great spot to enjoy your meal. If the weather gods are not cooperating
with your picnic plans, the Farmgate Café (reviewed in the previous sec-
tion, “Dining in Cork City and East County Cork”) is the next-best thing.
Between Grand Parade and Princes Street. Entrances on Patrick Street, Grand
Parade, Oliver Plunkett Street, and Princes Street. Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
Suggested visit: 45 minutes.
Fota Wildlife Park
Carrigtwohill
This place is not Irish in the least, but it’s a fascinating attraction, where
more than 70 species of exotic wildlife roam relatively freely (except the
cheetahs — for both your safety and theirs). Giraffes nibble on leaves, pea-
cocks strut their stuff, zebras nuzzle one another, and maras (guinea-pig-
type animals from Argentina) bounce along everywhere. Highlights are the
families of monkeys, who love to hoot and show off their amazing acro-
batics on rope “vines.” Panels with text explain where the animals came
from and how they live, always with an eye to conservation (the park does
a lot of breeding for conservation), and excellent talks are offered each
day. If you can, try to catch the Cheetah Run, during which the park’s chee-
tahs run with incredible speed to catch their dinner. An open-air train cir-
cles the park, but you’ll see more by walking. Admission to the wildlife
park also includes free admission to the Fota Arboretum, with its collec-
tion of temperate and subtropical plants and trees.
Cork Harbour. 16km (10 miles) from Cork City toward Cobh off the N25. % 021-81-2678.
Admission: 13 ($21) adults, 8.50 ($14) students, seniors, and children under 16.
Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (last admission 5 p.m.), Sun 11 a.m.–5 p.m. (last admis-
sion 4 p.m.) Suggested visit: 2 hours.
Chapter 15: County Cork 261
This is no blarney: The origins of blarney
Wondering just where the old “gift of gab” lore stems from? Well, we’ve all heard some
blarney in our lives, but the person who did it best (and first) was the charismatic Lord
of Blarney, Cormac McDermot McCarthy. When Queen Elizabeth asked all Irish lords
to effectively sign over their land to the crown, McCarthy was determined not to. For
every demand the queen made, he responded with eloquent letters that claimed undy-
ing loyalty and dripped with flattery, although he had no intention of giving in to her
demands. After receiving yet another crafty letter, the queen, exasperated, proclaimed,
“This is all Blarney. What he says, he rarely means.” So today, anyone who uses a lot
of eloquence and empty phrases and playfully deceives or exaggerates is said to be
talking blarney.

St. Anne’s (Shandon Church)
Cork City
Until 1986, when they were repaired, each of the four clock faces on the
tower of St. Ann Shandon, on Church Street, gave a different time, earning
it the nickname “The Four-Faced Liar.” You can climb the bell tower for the
city’s best view. And there’s an added attraction: You get to ring the church
bells yourself with the help of some tune cards. The church has a small
display of old books (including an Irish-language bible) on the left as you
enter. Visitors are welcome to come to Sunday services (Anglican) at 9 and
10 a.m.
Church Street. % 021-450-5906. Admission: 6 ($9.60) adults, 5 ($8) seniors and
students. Open: Easter–Nov Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; Nov–Easter 10 a.m.–3 p.m.
Suggested visit: 20 minutes.
St. Fin Barre’s Cathedral
Cork City
This cathedral was built on the site of a monastery and university created
by St. Fin Barre, Cork City’s founder, around A.D. 650. Interesting highlights
of the cruciform (cross-shaped) cathedral include the one-of-a-kind under-
ground church organ, zodiac symbols on the stained glass, and gilded ceil-
ings. You’ll get more out of your visit to this French Gothic–style Protestant
cathedral if you take the short informative tour.
Dean Street. % 021-496-3387. Admission: 3 ($4.80) adults, 1.50 ($2.40) students
and children. Open: Apr–Sept 30 Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5:20 p.m., Sun 1–5 p.m.; Oct–Mar
Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–12:45 p.m. and 2–5 p.m. Suggested visit: 30 minutes.
Other cool things to see and do
 Butter Museum: You’ll never look at a package of Kerrygold (or
Land O’Lakes) the same way after you visit this museum, which
traces the history of butter-making and the butter trade (Cork had
a booming butter market until the early 20th century) from ancient
times to today. The exhibit comprises audiovisuals, wall text, and
butter-related artifacts. If you’re one of those people who enjoy
museums on quirky subjects (I am one of those people), you will
probably like this place; if not, you will likely be bored.
Location: O’Connell Square, Shandon, Cork City. % 021-430-0600.
Admission: 3.50 ($5.60) for adults, 2.50 ($4) for seniors and stu-
dents, 1.50 ($2.40) children. Open: July and August daily 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m. March to June and September and October daily from 
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Suggested visit: One hour.
 Cork City Gaol: The history of Cork’s City’s old jail, operational
from 1824 to 1923, is brought to life with wax figures, recreations 
of the cells, and an audio tape telling the stories of the jail and its
prisoners.
Part IV: Counties Cork and Kerry

Location: Convent Avenue, in the Sunday’s Well neighborhood of
Cork City. % 021-430-5022. Admission: 7.50 ($12) for adults,
6.50 ($10) for students and seniors, 4 ($6.40) for children. Open:
March through October 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., and November through
February 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Suggested visit: One hour.
 Lusitania Memorial: This is an impressive and sobering memorial
to the 1,195 people who died aboard the Lusitania when it was hit
by a German torpedo off the Irish coast in 1915. The sinking of the
boat was one of the events that prompted the U.S. to enter into
World War I.
Location: Cobh Harbour, on the square right by the water.
Suggested visit: A couple of minutes.
 Old Midleton Distillery/Jameson Heritage Centre: Journey
through the history of Irish whiskey. You’ll see an interesting audio-
visual presentation and parts of this restored 18th-century distill-
ery, including the largest pot still in the world, able to hold an
intoxicating 30,000 gallons. The modern distillery here (entrance is
not permitted) is the largest in Ireland, producing many different
whiskies, including Jameson and Tullamore Dew. At the end of the
tour, you get to sample some of the smoothest whiskey ever made.
The souvenir shop sells everything from shot glasses to bottles of
the Water of Life.
Location: Distillery Road, off Main Street, Midleton. Off the N25,
east of Cork City and west from Youghal. % 021-461-3594.
Admission: 13 ($20) adults, 9 ($14) seniors and students over
age 18, 6 ($9.60) children and students under age 18. Open: March
through October daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., from November through
February tours are conducted daily at 11:30 a.m. and 1, 2:30 and 4
p.m. Suggested visit: One and a quarter hours.
 Youghal (Medieval Walls): This lovely little port town is worth a
stop to get out, stretch your legs, and see what Dublin may have
looked like if it hadn’t become the capital of the country. Like
Dublin, Youghal (pronounced yawl) was settled by the Vikings and
later fortified by the Normans, who built a wall around the city, half
of which still stands. As you make your way from the main Water
Gate along the old wall, you see several towers (originally built
close enough to allow guards to shout to one another) and the
main arched gate, called Cromwell’s Arch because it’s believed that
Oliver Cromwell ended his bloody English campaign here. Don’t
miss the restored Clock Gate (formerly Trinity Gate) at the south-
ern entrance to the town, once an execution site and prison. The
guided tours of the walls and town are excellent.
You may want to top off your stop in Youghal with a trip to the
town’s long, sandy stretch of beach, located right past the town
center.

Shopping in Cork City and East County Cork
Cork is a diverse city for shopping. From the highbrow stores on
Patrick’s Street to the eclectic mix of small retail shops along Oliver
Plunkett Street, you can find everything from designer clothing and linen
to gourmet cheeses and homemade crafts. The Merchants Quay
Shopping Centre, home to 40 shops and the upscale department stores
Roches and Marks & Spencer, is on Patrick’s Street. For all sorts of tasty
edibles see the English Market, reviewed in “The top attractions,” earlier
in this chapter.
The Blarney Woollen Mills, near Blarney Castle, off the N20, Blarney 
(% 021-451-6111), is the original in a string of famous stores, which sell
everything from crystal to tweed to, of course, sweaters. Stephen
Pearce Pottery, on the R629, Shanagarry (% 021-464-6807), is the place
to go for the popular and unique handmade white-and-terra-cotta earth-
enware that you see all over. The Courtyard Craft & Exhibition Centre,
in Midleton (% 021-463-4644) sells Irish-made pottery, stained glass,
linens, and many other crafts.
Nightlife and pubs

An Spailpin Fanac
Open fireplaces, plenty of brickwork, and traditional music Sunday
through Thursday make An Spailpin one of the best pubs in town. It’s also
one of the oldest pubs in Cork and is located opposite the Beamish
Brewery, which should give you a good idea what you should order.

coffee is legendary.

Kinsale and West County Cork
You can feast on some of the finest cuisine in Ireland (especially
seafood) in the charming and popular port city of Kinsale, which is
known as the Gourmet Capital of Ireland. Between meals, wander the
winding streets, browse through some terrific little shops, and stroll
around the sheltered harbor.
Past Kinsale, West County Cork looks like a magazine advertisement for
Ireland, with fishing villages, cozy pubs (many with excellent music), and
awe-inspiring cliffs and craggy coastline. If you are looking for Ireland
without the crowds, this is one of the places (along with parts of County
Donegal and Mayo, and much of the North) that I would recommend. In
fact, due to its proximity to many other gorgeous (but more well-known)
parts of the West, this would be my first choice for an off-the-beaten-path
adventure. Be aware, however, that there is less tourism infrastructure in
West Cork than in most parts of Ireland because there has not been as
much demand for attractions, restaurants, and hotels . . . yet.
Getting to Kinsale and West County Cork
To get to Kinsale by car, take the R600 south from Cork or the R605
south from Inishannon. The N71 links Cork to most of the major towns in
west County Cork. Bus Éireann (% 01-836-6111) travels year-round to
Kinsale, Bantry, and other major towns in West County Cork.
Bus Éireann also runs a tour along the source of the river Lee to the
scenic towns of Bantry and Schull, where you depart for a cruise to
craggy Cape Clear Island, a stunningly rugged island with a population of
about 120 (most of whom speak Irish as a first language), loads of birds
and sea life, and several ancient sites (including at 5,000-year-old pas-
sage tomb). Tours are offered on Saturdays from late June to late
September and leave Parnell Place in Cork City at 9:30 a.m., returning at
9:45 p.m. The price is 26 ($42) adults, 23 ($36) seniors and students,
and 17 ($27) children.
Easy Tours Cork (% 021-454-5328; www.easytourscork.com) offers
two tours of West Cork. The first tour takes you to Kinsale and several
charming small towns before returning to Cork via the lovely coastal
route. The second tour takes you first to a peaceful lakeside spot that
was once home to a sixth-century monastery, before bringing you to the
pretty little town of Glengariff, where you’ll have the option of sailing to
Garinish Island (see p. 275). Both tours run about eight hours, leaving
from the Cork City Tourist Office, 42 Grand Parade (near Oliver Plunkett
St.). Tours run from May through September. The first tour leaves at 9:30
a.m. Tuesdays and Friday, while the second tour leaves at 9:30 a.m. on
Wednesdays and Saturdays. Tours are 30 ($48) for adults, 28 ($45) for
students and seniors, and 15 ($24) for children.

Three-story Actons Hotel has exceptional amenities, including an indoor
heated pool, a gym, a sauna, a steam room, an outdoor hot tub, a Jacuzzi,
a children’s pool, a solarium, and spa treatments. The modern rooms boast
giant beds. Pay the extra cash for a sea view overlooking Kinsale’s beauti-
ful harbor and yachting marina — it’s worth it. The outdoor breakfast is
another nice feature.

Ballylickey (outside of Bantry)
Cross your fingers for clear weather, because the views of the surrounding
hills and valleys from this simple B&B are delightful. This place feels like
a real family home; Joe and Deirdre O’Connell’s four kids laugh and play
outside, and the cozy rooms are furnished in a down-to-earth country
style. Deirdre caters to all tastes and appetites at breakfast, offering every-
thing from a full Irish fried breakfast to pancakes to vegetarian options
such as quiche. Families will appreciate the large grounds (great for run-

It was inevitable. As Bantry becomes part of more and more peoples’ travel

Perhaps roasted chicken with a parsley stuffing on cauliflower puree with

by the baked hake with crispy shrimp and chorizo on creamed leeks with
a red pepper and watercress sauce? Chandeliers, beautiful paintings,
antique mirrors, gorgeous crockery, and the golden glow of candlelight

Fishy Fishy Café
$$$–$$$$
Kinsale
SEAFOOD
Looking for the freshest seafood in town? Fishy Fishy has become so popu-
lar for their sparkling fresh seafood and fish that they recently opened a
new 150-seat restaurant on O’Connell Street. At both locations, the chef
handpicks the best of the day’s catch each morning and then serves it up
in classy but simple dishes that let the flavor of the fish shine. The open-
face crab sandwich and the chowder are excellent, but I recommend going
for it and polishing off the seafood platter, a banquet of smoked and fresh
salmon, mussels, oysters, crab, and langoustines. Don’t miss the chickpea
spread served with the bread. The secret is out, and they don’t take reser-
vations, so come early or late to avoid the crowds. The large new restau-
rant is on O’Connell Street, though I prefer the original because it has a
great fish counter that’s fun to browse.

This cozy bar, with polished wood and nautical décor, serves up mouth-
watering, uncomplicated dishes such as rack of lamb, seafood chowder,

Maybe it’s the lantern-style lamps casting a warm glow on the wood-and-

you want to linger over dinner at this buzzing, romantic restaurant. Maybe
it’s just that you want to keep eating the fresh, skillfully prepared dishes.
The black sole, cooked on the bone, melts in your mouth, and the steak
au poivre is juicy and full of flavor. You’ll be licking the shells if you order
the mussels stuffed with buttered breadcrumbs and garlic for starters. But
then you’d be missing out on the deep-fried brie with plum and port sauce.

Kinsale
SEAFOOD/NEW IRISH
A meal in this small townhouse restaurant, located in the heart of Kinsale,
is one of the best gourmet dining experiences you’ll have in the area — as
a columnist in the Irish Independent wrote, “No visit to Kinsale is complete
without a visit to Max’s.” The menu changes all the time, featuring such
dishes as heavenly scallops poached in vermouth and cream and an unfor-
gettable rack of lamb with red wine and rosemary sauce. Seafood is defi-
nitely the restaurant’s strongest point — they serve at least six different
catches of the day, and their “symphony of oysters,” an array of oysters
prepared in different styles, is fantastic.

Blues and whites, plus small paintings of Italy, set the scene in one of my
favorite Italian restaurants in all of Ireland (though top honors still go to
Ristorante Rinuccini [see p. 243]). They’ve got all the classics down to a
science, from penne all’arrabiata, with tomato, garlic, and fresh chilies, to
tagliatelle with chicken and mushrooms. But the menu doesn’t stop there.
The restaurant also aces more daring dishes such as risotto with fresh
mussels, fresh asparagus, and saffron sauce. Service here is gracious in a
way that my grandfather (a career waiter at the Algonquin Hotel in New
York) would have appreciated.

Bantry House and Gardens
Bantry
If I had to choose to visit only one of Ireland’s many great houses, Bantry
House, built for the earls of Bantry in 1750, would be my pick. This sump-
tuously furnished house is unique in that there are no velvet ropes guard-
ing the rooms; you are free to wander through the house at will with a
written guide that identifies the origins and history of each work of art,
decoration, or piece of furniture. There are many treasures within the
house, including several tapestries created to celebrate Marie Antoinette’s
wedding; The Fruit Market, a massive painting by Snyders and Rubens; and
a rosewood grand piano in the 18m (60-ft.) long library. Set aside time to
explore the vast grounds and gardens, which offer stunning views of
Bantry Bay below. The most magnificent panorama of the house, gardens,
and bay is afforded by climbing the steep stairs in the garden behind the
house. You can recover from your climb with a cup of tea and a piece of
cake at the tearoom. If you have fallen in love with Bantry House, you may
want to consider staying here for a few nights. B&B rates run from 200 to
300 ($320–$480) per night.

Charles Fort
Kinsale
Military history buffs and view-lovers will both be pleased here. One of
Ireland’s largest forts, Charles Fort is a star-shaped fortification con-
structed in the late 17th-century. There is a small museum, but the high-
light is wandering through the rooms of the fort and along the ramparts,
where you are afforded superb views of Kinsale’s harbor. To get here, you
can take the Scilly Walk, a path that curves along the harbor and through
woodlands from Kinsale, offering beautiful views of the water. James Fort
(1602) is across the river.

Driving, biking, or hiking the Beara Peninsula
When you get home, don’t forget to tell your friends that the Beara penin-
sula was terribly ugly and boring. That way, the peninsula will remain the
wild and unspoiled place that it is now, with many ruins (both ancient and
more recent), magnificent seascapes, and sweeping hills. If you want a
peninsula drive like those on the Ring of Kerry or the Dingle peninsula, but
with fewer crowds, the Beara is for you. Be aware that the Beara peninsula
has much less tourist infrastructure than the other two peninsulas (fewer
restaurants, hotels, and built-up attractions). The drive around the penin-
sula (begin your loop around the peninsula either at Kenmare [take R571]
or at Glengariff [take R572], making sure to take the cut-off leading to Healy
Pass from either Adrigole or Lauragh) takes a whole day, if you do it at a
leisurely pace. A stop in the cute town of Ahillies is a great way to break
up your journey. Beara Tourism (www.bearatourism.com) provides all
the information you need to plan a hike or bicycle trip on the peninsula.
Garinish Island (Ilnacullin Island)
This little island is an amazing sight — an Italian garden of rare trees, vivid
flowers, and shrubs set along walkways and pools, all sitting out in the sea
on an uninhabited 18-hectare (37-acre) island. Before the owner brought
over hundreds of tons of topsoil to grow the exotic plants, the island was
bare rock. Half the fun is the short journey getting there on one of the small
ferries that serve the island (keep an eye out for basking seals!)
The Blue Pool Ferry (% 027-63-333) leaves from the harbor in Glengarriff every half-
hour or so and takes 15 minutes to reach the island. Round-trip is 10 ($16) adults,
8 ($13) students, 5 ($8) children under 12. % 027-63-040. Admission: 3.70 ($5.90)

Mizen Head
The Visitor Centre and the Fog Signal Station on the very tip of this point
are exciting additions to an already popular spot, where you get priceless
views of the wild Atlantic waves and the jagged rocks of Ireland’s south-
western-most point. You can traverse the famous suspension bridge over
craggy cliffs and sea, and climb to the top of Mizen Head. The lightkeeper’s
house and engine room have been converted into a museum about light-
keepers and the flora and fauna of Mizen Head; the video about light-
keeping is interesting, but the museum itself is a little down at the heels.
Set down as far as you can go on the Bantry Peninsula, Mizen Head seems
a little out of the way, but the drive from the east is gorgeous, all beautiful
beaches and green hills.

really know you’re on the R591. You begin seeing signs for Mizen back in Skibbereen,
and you basically just follow the signs to get there.) % 028-35-115 or 028-35-591.

Visiting the West Cork Islands
In addition to the must-see Garinish Island (described above), West Cork
has several other islands that are worth a visit. Rugged Cape Clear Island
offers cliffs, bogland, and lakes, and is home to about 120 year-round res-
idents (most of whom speak Irish as a first language). This is arguably the
best place to go birding in Ireland, and you may also spot sea life includ-
ing whales and dolphins. To get to Cape Clear Island, contact Cape Clear
Island Ferry Service (% 086-346-5110), which sails from Baltimore
Harbour. Though Dursey Island is striking in its own right, with a craggy
landscape, great birding, and gorgeous seascapes, getting there is half the
fun. You’ll take an old cable car (% 027-73017) from the tip of the Beara
Peninsula (the end of R572) over the sea to the island (don’t worry about
plunging into the waters below — the car is licensed to hold a cow).
Walking the Sheep’s Head Way
This 89km (55-mile) route was voted the best walk in Ireland by Country
Walking Magazine. The marked route makes a loop out of the town of
Bantry, traveling through vast moorland and along craggy cliffs. Most
hikers take four days to complete the entire hike. Of course, you can hike
smaller sections of the route. For more information on the Sheep’s 
Head Way, contact the Waymarked Ways of Ireland (% 01-860-8823;

ing. Granny’s Bottom Drawer, 53 Main St., Kinsale (% 021-477-4839),

more, all handweaved with delicate care. Heather Mountain, 15 Market

purchased an old Guinness sign, homemade goat cheese, and some fresh
vegetables.

C
ounty Kerry is not nicknamed The Kingdom for nothing. The county
encompasses some of the most famous and stunning natural sights
in Ireland, including the Ring of Kerry, the Dingle Peninsula, and Killarney
National Park. You’ll find sea cliffs, rolling green hills, charming seaside
villages, and aquamarine lakes. This area has long been one of the cen-
ters of Gaelic culture — many people speak Gaelic as their first language
here, and the traditional Irish music and crafts scenes are thriving. Sound
like a place you’d like to go? A lot of other people think so, too, making
County Kerry one of the most-visited areas in Ireland. During the summer,
the town of Killarney (and to a lesser extent Kenmare) swarms with visi-
tors. If this is not your thing, my advice is to plan your vacation for the
spring or fall — or, even better, take some turns off the well-trodden
tourist trails. I provide some off-the-beaten-track options in this chapter,
such as a mountain drive on the Dingle Peninsula and a hidden farm-
house off the Ring of Kerry.
The brochure Kerry Gems, which you can pick up at any Tourist
Information office, has many excellent suggestions for exploring this
region. 
Killarney and Killarney National Park
Killarney National Park is a must-see in this area — a gorgeous park with
velvety valleys and deep blue lakes. Killarney Town itself doesn’t have a
ton of attractions, but it makes an excellent base for visiting the park
and for beginning or ending your tour of the Ring of Kerry. The town
swarms with visitors in the summer, meaning that you can get every-
thing you need, but you’ll need to wait in line with everyone else visiting
the area.

Getting to Killarney
To get to Killarney by car, take the N21 southwest from Limerick or the
N22 northwest from Cork. From the Ring of Kerry and West Cork, take
the N70. To get to Tralee from Killarney, take the N22 north. To continue
on to Dingle, take the N86 from Tralee. The tip of the Dingle Peninsula
can be driven via the R559, beginning and ending in Dingle. Irish Rail
(% 1-850-366-222; www.irishrail.ie) serves Killarney from Dublin,
Limerick, Cork, Galway, and smaller towns on those routes. Trains arrive
daily at the Killarney Railway Station, Railway Road, off East Avenue
Road. Bus Éireann (% 01-836-6111; www.buseireann.ie) comes into
Killarney from all over Ireland. The bus depot is next to the train station.
Getting around Killarney
This compact town is entirely walkable. The Tourist Trail takes you past
the highlights of the town: Just follow the signs, or get a pamphlet about
the trail at the tourist office (see “Fast Facts: Killarney,” later in this
chapter, for the address). If you have a rental car with you, I recommend
just parking it at your hotel until you’re ready for a daytrip to Killarney
National Park. Most accommodations offer free parking for guests, but
there’s also street parking and parking lots. During the day you need to
display a parking disc in your car; discs are available at shops and
hotels. There’s no bus service within the town, but you can get a taxi at
the taxi rank on College Square. For taxi pick-up, call Dero’s Taxi
Service (% 064-66-31-251) or O’Connell Taxi (% 064-66-31-654). For
information on getting around Killarney National Park, see “Exploring
Killarney National Park,” later in this chapter.
Spending the night in Killarney
In addition to the options listed below, you may also like to check out
The Ross, Town Centre (% 064-35-555), a swanky new hotel in the
center of Killarney.
Aghadoe Heights
$$$$
Killarney
Located far from the crowds of Killarney Town, Aghadoe Heights is all
about hip luxury. Rooms are meant to be hideaways, with freestanding
tubs, plasma screen TVs, cushy beds, Frette linens, and stunning views
of Killarney’s lakes and mountains. And then there is the spa, which
recently won Best Resort Spa of the Year, and offers all sorts of treat-
ments in slick surroundings (check out the Zen relaxation suite). Service
is friendly and helpful.

Arbutus Hotel
$$$–$$$$
Killarney
This hotel in the center of town has a traditional Irish feel to it, with cozy
chairs arranged around a turf fire in the lobby. Rooms (especially those
on the second floor) are large and tastefully furnished with beautiful fab-
rics and furniture. The downstairs Buckley’s Pub has an oak-paneled bar,
and local opinion says that the bartenders there pull the best pints of
Guinness in town. Good traditional music fills the air nightly. The Arbutus
is a family-run hotel (three generations of the Buckley family have pitched
in since the hotel was opened), and the entire staff is friendly and willing
to help with anything.
College Street. From Main Street, turn onto Plunkett Street (it only goes one way).
Plunkett becomes College, and the hotel is at the roundabout where College meets
Lewis Road. % 064-66-31-037. Fax: 064-34-033. www.arbutuskillarney.com.

Friar’s Glen
$$–$$$
Killarney
Everything at this bed and breakfast is about comfort, from the peat fire
that blazes in the lovely sitting room to the soothing guest rooms. Mary
Fuller welcomes you to her grand country home with tea and cookies, and
will happily sit down with you to help plan your visit to Killarney National
Park. The house is located right in the park, with the entrance to Muckross
House and Gardens (see p. 288) less than a five-minute drive away. Rooms
are large, decorated with light yellow walls, watercolors, and windows look-
ing out on the surrounding mountains. Breakfasts are exceptional; be sure
to try the banana “fritters,” which are actually more like delicate crepes. 
Mangerton Rd. Coming from Killarney Town, turn left a Molly Darcy’s Pub.

Kathleen’s Country House
$$$
Killarney
This B&B and Friar’s Glen are the top choices for those who are country
mice rather than city mice. Kathleen’s is located about 1.6km (1 mile) out
of Killarney, on large grounds filled with gardens. The bright, recently ren-
ovated rooms are furnished with antique furniture and original contem-
porary art. Kathleen herself is warm, friendly, and always willing to help.

Killarney Park Hotel
$$$$
Killarney
Every inch of this luxurious hotel is a study in old-world elegance. This is
the place for people who want comfort, class, and refinement. The
Chapter 16: County Kerry 283

Victorian-style lobby has plush couches and armchairs surrounding open
fires, and there’s a fully stocked library where you can plan out your day
over a cup of tea. The Garden Bar maintains the country-house style, with
wood everywhere and strategically placed fireplaces and snugs, and break-
fast is served in a vaulted dining room complete with large oil portraits
and plush, high-backed chairs. Guest rooms are spacious and tastefully
furnished with antiques and attractive fabrics. This hotel is definitely
worth a splurge. Kids are welcome, and a few family rooms are available.

$$$$
Killarney
This hotel has true manor-house style. The Victorian décor in the public
rooms is polished and ornate, with detailed plasterwork, chandeliers, and
inviting fireplaces. The rooms are large and traditionally furnished, and
overlook the hotel’s lush, gorgeously landscaped 8-hectare (20-acre)
grounds. The hotel has an abundance of amenities, including a leisure
center with pool and Jacuzzi, a cocktail bar, 24-hour room service, and a
new full-service spa. You’ll feel completely isolated from the world, even
though the hotel’s just a short walk from the center of town.

Murphy’s Guesthouse
$$
Killarney
The rooms here, though clean and large, are pretty generic. But you’re not
paying for top-of-the-line interior design here; you’re paying for a superb
location. The hotel is in the heart of town and is conveniently located right
above an excellent pub; so at the end of the night, after a few pints and
some traditional music, you can crawl upstairs to your bed. Service is help-
ful and professional.

wash it all down.

IRISH
If you’re hankering for some hearty, well-made Irish food, you’ll definitely
want to try this cozy place, with dark wood furniture, raspberry walls, and
stained glass windows. The restaurant specializes in boxty, traditional Irish
potato pancakes filled with the meat or vegetable filling of your choice.
Other options are delicious versions of such tried-and-true Irish restau-
rant dishes as lamb with rosemary, and beef medallions with pepper
sauce.

Foley’s Seafood & Steak Restaurant
$$$–$$$$
Killarney
SEAFOOD-IRISH
The elegant black-and-white exterior of Foley’s is a good indicator of the
classy interior. Though it’s primarily a seafood restaurant, the meat dishes
are very good too. The menu changes all the time, but look for the duck or
pheasant and the steak with garlic butter. Foley’s also serves several excel-
lent vegetarian dishes. Whatever you choose, be sure to take advantage
of the homemade brown bread. The wine list here boasts more than 200
selections.

Gaby’s Seafood Restaurant
$$$$
Killarney
SEAFOOD
The finest seafood in Killarney is served here. Gaby’s is well known for its
lobster dishes, but the Kerry shellfish platter takes the cake (or maybe the
crab cake?), with prawns, mussels, lobster, scallops, and oysters. The
rustic brickwork and wooden floors make for pleasant surroundings.
Gaby’s diverse wine list complements the excellent food well. You’re prac-
tically guaranteed a great meal — in fact, you may be so satisfied that you
won’t mind what it costs you.
27 High St. % 064-66-32-519. Main courses: 25–50 ($40–$80). AE, DC, MC, V. Open:

Exploring Killarney
Killarney Town is a fine place to sleep and eat while absorbing the
majestic beauty of nearby Killarney National Park, but be forewarned:
The town is thronged with visitors. There are a few interesting attrac-
tions in Killarney Town, including St. Mary’s Cathedral on Cathedral
Place, off Port Road and St. Mary’s Church on Church Place, across from
the tourist office, but mostly you find good restaurants, lodgings, pubs,
and an assortment of shops selling souvenirs of the leprechaun-sitting-
on-a-horseshoe-holding-a-shamrock variety.
The Killarney Tourist Trail takes you to the highlights, keeping you on
track through a series of signposts. The tour begins at the Killarney of
the Welcomes Tourist Office at the Town Centre Car Park on Beech Road 
(% 064-31-633) and takes about two hours, if you walk at a leisurely pace.
Exploring Killarney National Park
Killarney National Park is a place of sapphire lakes studded with grass-
covered islands, heather-blanketed mountains towering above bogs,
lush forests filled with rhododendron, and paths leading through rocky
gaps threaded with ribbons of stream. A well-defined (but occasionally
dippy and curvy) road winds through part of the park past the three
main lakes, but much of the land is accessible only by hiking, biking,
horseback-riding, or riding in a horse-drawn jaunting car. If you decide
to drive along the road, make time to stop at the various viewpoints, and
park your car to take some short walks into the park. Without stopping,
the drive takes just over an hour, but you should give it at least half a
day, because there’s so much to see. Biking, hiking, boating, or taking a
jaunting car are the best options for exploring the park (see “Exploring
the park by foot, bicycle, or horseback,” below). The main entrance and
visitor center is at Muckross House (% 064-66-31-440; www.muckross-
house.ie), where you can find maps and guides detailing hikes and
other activities in the park. I definitely recommend stopping here to get
your bearings and plan your day out. Admission to the park is free, and
the park is open during daylight hours.
Gap of Dunloe
This breathtaking valley is bound on either side by craggy glacial rocks
and soaring cliffs and passes streams and lakes of a deep blue. The gap is
accessible only by horse-and-cart, by foot, on horseback, or by bicycle
(see the following section, “Exploring the park by foot, bicycle, or horse-
back,” for more information). The best time to take the journey is during
the off-season, when a quiet peace descends on an area that can be over-
crowded during July and August. If you are visiting during the high season,
I recommend either going as early or as late in the day as possible.
Ladies View
Ladies View looks out on an exhilarating panorama of the surrounding
mountains and the three lakes. How did it get its name? In the 1800s, Queen

Killarney National Park
Chapter 16: County Kerry 287

Victoria of England made a trip to Killarney and took her entourage
through what is now the National Park. The queen’s ladies-in-waiting were
particularly thrilled with the view from this spot.
Off N71, near the Upper Lake.
Muckross House and Gardens
This Victorian mansion is one of Ireland’s finest stately manors. The décor
and furnishings of the upper part of the home illustrate the lifestyle of the
mid–19th-century gentry, while the basement surroundings give you an
idea of the harsher environment that the domestic servants endured. A
craft center here houses artisans working at traditional crafts such as
weaving, bookbinding, and pottery making. The beautiful gardens are
known for their rhododendrons and azaleas, and their recently restored
Edwardian greenhouses; and the grand lawns are enough to make any sub-
urban homeowner drool with jealousy. Unfortunately, there is restricted
accessibility for the disabled.
Take Kenmare Road (N71) out of Killarney. % 064-66-31-440. www.muckross-
house.ie. Admission: Muckross House and Gardens alone are 5.75 ($9.20) adults,
4.50 ($7.20) seniors, 2.35 ($3.80) children and students. Combined ticket for house,
gardens, and traditional farms (see the next review) are 10 ($16) adults, 8 ($13)
seniors, 5 ($8) children and students. Open: July–Aug 9 a.m.–7 p.m., Sept–June 9
a.m.–5:30 p.m. Last admission 1 hour before closing. Suggested visit: 1
1⁄2 hours.
Muckross Traditional Farms
Turn off your cellphone, forget that you stayed in a hotel with electric light-
ing last night, and immerse yourself in the world of 19th-century rural
Ireland. Farms of three sizes (small, medium, and large) occupy the pretty
grounds and are populated by folks in period dress who go about their
daily tasks: milking cows, cutting hay, gathering eggs from the chickens,
harvesting potatoes, baking bread, and so on. You also find a carpenter’s
workshop, a saddler’s workshop, and a blacksmith’s forge, all in operation.
You are invited to step inside the farmhouses to enjoy home baking in front
of the turf fires, to join the farmers in their tasks, and to watch the crafts-
men at work. And of course, you are welcome to ask the farmers and work-
ers any questions you may have.
Take Kenmare Road (N71) out of Killarney. % 064-66-31-440. www.muckross-
house.ie. Admission: Farm admission alone is 6.50 ($10) adults, 5 ($8) seniors,
3 ($4.80) children and students. Combination tickets for traditional farms with the
house and gardens also available (see the previous review). Open: June–Sept daily
10 a.m.–6 p.m.; May daily 1–6 p.m.; Mar–Apr and Oct Sat–Sun 1–6 p.m. Suggested
visit: 1–2 hours.
Ross Castle
This fortified castle was built by the O’Donoghue chieftains, probably during
the 15th century, and was the last stronghold in the province of Munster to
surrender to Cromwell in 1652. What remains today is a huge tower house,
Part IV: Counties Cork and Kerry
288

surrounded by a wall with four smaller towers at each corner — 
clearly, fortification was a priority. Inside the tower is an admirable collec-
tion of furniture from the 16th and 17th centuries. The castle sits on a penin-
sula projecting into Lough Leane, Killarney’s largest lake. The M.V. Pride of
the Lakes (see “Joining an organized tour,” later in this chapter) and other
boats leave to explore the lake from the castle. The boat tour to Innisfallen
Island, where you can see monastery ruins, is particularly magnificent. You
can also take a pretty lakeside walk between Killarney Town and the castle.
Ross Road. % 064-35-851. Head south from town on Ross Road. Admission: 5.30
($8.50) adults, 3.70 ($5.90) seniors, 2.10 ($3.40) children and students. Open: Mid-
Mar to May and Sept to mid-Oct daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m., June–Aug daily 9 a.m.–6:30
p.m., mid-Oct to mid-Nov daily 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m. Suggested visit: 1 hour.
Torc Waterfall
This crashing waterfall is just off N71, near Muckross House and Gardens.
You can see the waterfall after a short walk on the lower path, but climb
the stone stairs for an even better view of the falls and the surrounding
mountains.
Take the lower path from Muckross House.
Exploring the park by foot, bicycle, or horseback
If you’re looking to explore on your own, pick up Simple Pocket Maps
for Walkers and Cyclists in Killarney, at the Killarney of the Welcomes
office or the Killarney tourist office at Town Hall (see “Fast Facts:
Killarney,” later in this chapter). These concise color maps guide you
into some of the area’s delightful hidden scenery.
 By foot: There are several signposted trails in the park, including
the 2.4km (1.5-mile) Blue Pool Nature trail, which winds through
woodlands and past a small lake; the Old Boat House Nature Trail,
which travels half a mile near Muckross Lake; the 2.4km (1.5-mile)
Mossy Woods Nature Trail, which takes you through woods along
low cliffs; and the 4.8km (3-mile) Arthur Young’s Walk, which takes
you through forest and along the Muckross Peninsula. 
My favorite hike involves getting a boat from the Old Boathouse
across Muckross Lake to Dinas Cottage (a cute tearoom with beau-
tiful views), and then hiking back along the Muckross Peninsula
until you join up with the Arthur Young Trail. This hike should take
most people about 2 hours. The visitor center at Muckross House
can provide maps of the trails.
 By bicycle: Killarney National Park is a cyclist’s paradise, with
many marked bike trails. Biking through the Gap of Dunloe is a
breathtaking experience (in both senses of the word). You can rent
a bicycle at the Bike Shop and Outdoor Store Killarney, Bishops
Lane, off New Street in Killarney Town (% 064-66-31-282).
Chapter 16: County Kerry 289

 By horseback: You take a guided one- two- or three-hour ride
through the park with Killarney Riding Stables, N72, Ballydowney
(% 064-31-686). The company also offers multiday horseback
adventures that travel the Iveragh Peninsula (home to the Ring 
of Kerry). Muckross Riding Stables, Mangerton Road, Muckross
(% 064-32-238), also leads horse treks through the national park.
Joining an organized tour
If you want to add some structure to your explorations, check out the
organized tours in the following list.
 Dero’s Killarney National Park Tours: These two tours are terrific,
though touristy, ways to see the spectacular Kerry Mountains up
close and personal. Killarney Highlights is a three-hour bus tour
that takes you to all the highlights of Killarney National Park,
including Ross Castle, Muckross House and Gardens, Torc
Waterfall, Aghadoe, and the Gap of Dunloe. The five-and-a-half-hour
Gap of Dunloe tour takes you by bus to Kate Kearney’s Cottage, a
craft shop that was once an inn run by famed local beauty Kate
Kearney. From there, you can either take a horse cart or hike
through the breathtaking Gap of Dunloe. Once you’ve emerged on
the other side of the gap, you will take a boat down a river to Ross
Castle, where the bus will meet you for your journey back to
Killarney Town.
Where and when: May to September daily at 2:30 p.m. (call to con-
firm). Killarney Highlights tours depart from Dero’s Tours office at
22 Main St., Killarney at 2:30 p.m.; The Gap of Dunloe tours leave
from the tour office daily at 10:30 a.m. Information: % 064-66-31-
251. Price: Killarney Highlights 18 ($29); Gap of Dunloe tour 50
($80) with the horse cart ride, 30 ($48) without the horse cart
ride.
 Jaunting-Car Tour: These horse-drawn buggies are as much a part
of Killarney as the lakes and mountains. The drivers will take you
through the town or as far as the Gap of Dunloe, and they go into
Killarney National Park as far as Muckross House and Torc
Waterfall. The drivers are characters, and pretty persuasive — even
if you had no intention of taking one, you could find yourself bounc-
ing in the back of a buggy with a blanket snug around your legs.
This adventure is best undertaken in the off season or towards the
end of the day, when the Gap of Dunloe is quieter and, thus, much
more magical.
Where and when: You can find jaunting cars all over town — or,
rather, they’ll find you. If you want to book in advance, contact
Tangney Tours at % 064-66-33-358, though you won’t have a prob-
lem finding a car in town on a moment’s notice. Price: It’s not as
though the carts have cab meters, so ask the tourist office or your
hotel what to expect. The going rate for a one-hour tour is about 
Part IV: Counties Cork and Kerry
290

25 ($40) per person (up to four people can be taken in one car). To
be on the safe side, have the driver quote a price before heading out.
 M.V. Lily of Killarney Waterbus Tour: This tour leaves from Ross
Castle and takes you around Lough Leane, Killarney’s largest lake,
in a luxurious passenger cruiser.
Where and when: Tours leave from the pier at Ross Castle, from
March to October (call for times). % 064-66-31-633 or
087-253-5895. Price: 10 ($16) adults, 5 ($8) children.
If you get a yen to do the golf thing while you’re in the midst of all this
green, visit the Killarney Golf and Fishing Club. This course is nestled
among the beautiful Lakes of Killarney and below the majestic
Macgillycuddy’s Reeks Mountains. It’s on Mahony’s Point, Killarney 
(% 064-66-31-034; www.killarney-golf.com). The greens fees are
120 ($192) to 130 ($208) on the Killeen course, 90 to 100
($144–$160) on the Mahony’s course, and 60 to 70 ($96–$112) on the
Lackbane course. Visitors are welcome every day and should make
reservations ahead of time.
Shopping in Killarney
Avoca Handweavers, Molls Gap (in Killarney National Park off the N71;
% 064-66-34-720), has a huge selection of sweaters and tweeds for men
and women. You also find unique pottery, jewelry, and crafts, as well as
plenty of souvenirs. The handcrafted jewelry at Brian de Staic, 18 High
St. (% 064-33-822), ranks among the most respected in Ireland, and
focuses on Celtic designs. De Courcy Dodd, 68 New St. (% 064-31-351)
sells antiques of all kinds, for everyone from serious collectors to hob-
byists. Mucros Craft Centre, Muckross House (% 064-66-31-440), fea-
tures all sorts of Irish crafts. If you’re in the market for sweaters and
handknits, Quills Woollen Market, 3 New St. (% 064-66-32-277), is the
place for you. From cardigans to pullovers, you find the finest Irish
knitwear here.
Hitting the pubs
Buckley’s
Killarney
Locals say this pub pulls the best pint of Guinness in town. The interior is
oak-paneled, and turf fires burn, making it cozy and welcoming. As the
story goes, publican Tim Buckley spent some time in New York but, in the
1920s, returned to Ireland because he deeply missed his hometown. He
created this pub to combine all the great things he missed about Ireland
while in the United States; maybe that’s why it exudes such Irish comfort.
Pub grub is served all day, and you can find traditional music frequently
during the summer.

The Ring of Kerry and the Iveragh Peninsula
The Ring of Kerry, a 176km (110-mile) circuit around the Iveragh
Peninsula, is one of the most popular routes in Ireland. And there are
good reasons for its renown: The winding route provides thrilling, dra-
matic views of the sea and the high inland mountains, and passes
through a succession of charming villages, each with its own unique
points of interest.
See the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book for a map of the Ring of
Kerry.
Getting to and around the Ring of Kerry
By car, take the N70 south from Tralee or the N71 southwest from
Killarney. A car is the best way to get to the Ring of Kerry and the best
way to see it all. Bus Éireann (% 01-836-6111) has limited service from
Killarney to Cahersiveen, Waterville, Kenmare, and a few other towns on
the Ring.
Railtours Ireland (% 01-856-0045; www.railtoursireland.com) runs
a one-day tour that leaves from Dublin. You’ll take a train to Killarney
and then board a bus for your tour of the Ring of Kerry. Tours cost 109
($174) and leave daily at 7 a.m., returning at 9:15 p.m. You can also
explore the area on Bus Éireann Ring of Kerry Day Tour (% 021-450-
8188; www.buseireann.ie). Unfortunately, the buses don’t stop very
often, but you still get the incredible views. Tours leave from the Cork
Bus Station at 10 a.m. and return at 9:30 p.m. They operate May through
September on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays (call to con-
firm the schedule), and cost 26 ($42) for adults, 23 ($37) for seniors
and students, and 17 ($27) for children.
The Ring of Kerry is short enough to drive in a single day, but there are
lots of things to see and do throughout the peninsula, and there are
many places to spend the night, so I recommend taking two days for the
drive. See “Exploring the Iveragh Peninsula and the Ring of Kerry,”
below, for information on how to drive the Ring.

colors. All rooms have spectacular views of the swift river that runs
through the property (fishing equipment is available at the house), backed

The selling point of this spacious farmhouse is the unbelievable view of
the luminous Bay of Kenmare and the mountains of the Beara Peninsula

rooms. The style of the spacious, uncluttered rooms is sort of a country
twist on standard modern hotel décor, with flowery quilts and antique-
style furniture. The house is a five- or ten-minute drive from the town of
Kenmare, but it feels much more secluded, especially when you ramble
down to the empty seashore. Hosts Mary Patricia and Owen O’Sullivan are
friendly, helpful, and full of tips about the area.

smoked salmon to crab claws tossed with olive oil, garlic, and chile pep-
pers. O’Neill’s owns its own fleet of fishing boats, so you can be sure that
your dish was just swimming (or scuttling, in the case of the crabs) that
morning. My favorite dish is the hot and cold seafood selection, a sampler

and smoked salmon.

Exploring the Iveragh Peninsula and the Ring of Kerry
In addition to taking in the glorious views the Ring of Kerry offers
around every bend, history and natural history buffs should enjoy the
sights in these sections.
The top attractions
The draw of the Ring of Kerry and the Iveragh Peninsula is the breath-
taking mountain, cliff, and coastal scenery, best seen by driving or
biking, with frequent stops for hikes and walks. I highly recommend driv-
ing the Ring yourself if you don’t mind a lot of twists and turns and the
occasional monster tour bus hogging the road.
The Ring is usually driven counterclockwise, beginning in Killarney or
Killorglin and going around to Kenmare. During the peak tourist season,
you’ll encounter a good number of other drivers along this route. So if
you want to avoid the crowds, begin in Kenmare and go clockwise —
that way, you’ll be going against the traffic. Another way to beat the tour
buses is to hit the road before they do — buses leave Killarney and
Killorglin at 9 or 10 a.m.
If you don’t think you’re up for driving yourself around the Ring, check
out the Bus Éireann Ring of Kerry Day Tour (% 01-836-6111) or the
Railtours Ireland Ring of Kerry Tour (see “Getting to and around the
Ring of Kerry,” earlier in this chapter).
If you take the standard counterclockwise route and start in Killorglin,
known as the gateway to the Ring, the next town you come to is
Glenbeigh, which is partially surrounded by mountains. At Rossbeigh,
you first catch sight of the Atlantic. You’ll hit the town of Cahirciveen
before arriving at Portmagee, a pretty fishing harbor where you cross
the bridge to Valentia Island. You’ll find interesting sights on the island,
including tetrapod footprints left more than 350 million years ago, the
Skellig Experience (see the review below), and a recently reopened slate
quarry. This is the place to depart for a boat tour of the Skellig rocks,
which rise like cathedrals from the Atlantics. I also highly recommend
taking the Bray Head hike to an overlook of the Skelligs. To get to Bray
Head, start at the Skellig Experience (see p. 300), then continue on R565
Part IV: Counties Cork and Kerry
298

until it hits a T, then make a left and park in the small parking lot at the
beginning of the hike. Ballinskelligs is a Gaeltacht, or Irish-speaking area,
that has an Irish college where children can attend summer classes to
learn the language. If the weather is good, you may be able to see the
Skelligs from here.
Waterville, the next town on the Ring, is known as a fishing resort but
has plenty of other sporting attractions to divert you from the drive. In
beautiful Caherdaniel, you can see the home of Daniel “The Liberator”
O’Connell, and nearby Castlecove is loaded with sandy beaches. The
lovely village of Sneem, filled with vividly colored buildings, has moun-
tain and river scenery and is a haven of peace and quiet. Parknasilla
benefits from the Gulf Stream and has a (comparably) warm climate and
even subtropical plants. Finally, the Ring of Kerry ends in the charming,
picturesque town of Kenmare, where you’ll enjoy fine hotels, restau-
rants, shopping, and pubs.
Now, some insider advice: Yes, the Ring is spectacular, but it is only a
small part of the Iveragh Peninsula. I highly recommend taking some of
the local interior roads through the mountains and hills that make up
the center of the peninsula, particularly in the area around gorgeous
Caragh Lake. It’s amazing how untouched this area is. Instead of tour
buses, you may encounter a farmer leading his herd of cows down the
road to a different pasture. And you’ll certainly encounter incredible
mountain scenery. All you need is a good driving map.
Derrynane House National Historic Park
Caherdaniel
This home was where early-19th-century political figure Daniel O’Connell,
often called “The Liberator,” lived for most of his life. O’Connell was a
lawyer and politician who fought for the repeal of anti-Catholic laws, and
for the separation of Ireland from Great Britain. O’Connell’s former home
is now a museum displaying many personal artifacts; don’t miss the inter-
esting 25-minute video on his life. The house sits on gorgeous grounds
along the coast and boasts extensive gardens.

Seafari Ecotours
A two-hour cruise aboard this boat, which holds up to 150 people and has
both covered and uncovered areas, is the best way to get up close and per-
sonal with the many gray seals that call this area home. The cruise is also a
great way to see the castles, ruins, and megalithic monuments that line 
the shores of the bay. Captain Ross is both hilarious and knowledgeable,

providing interesting commentary on local geology and history, and expertly
spotting the dolphins, sea otters, and water birds that often frequent the
bay along with the seals. If you’d prefer to cruise with a smaller group of
travelers, a smaller cruise (% 087-259-2209; www.kenmareanglingand

The Skellig Experience
Valentia Island
The two Skellig rock islands, Skellig Michael and Little Skellig, jut steeply
out of the sea about 14km (8 miles) from the Iveragh Peninsula. This heri-
tage center, located on beautiful Valentia Island, has excellent exhibits and
audiovisuals explaining the natural and human history of the Skelligs. You
find out about the lives and work of the early Christian monks who crea-
ted their monastery on Skellig Michael, discover the history of the Skellig
lighthouse and its keepers, and find out about the intriguing bird and plant
life of the Skelligs. The highlight of the visit is the two-hour cruise around
the islands. Note that the water is often very choppy, so if you left your
sea legs at the hotel, you can visit the Skelligs virtually through a 15-minute
audiovisual tour. If you’d like a chance to climb on the Skelligs, check out
the Skellig Michael boat trip, reviewed below.

Oct–Nov Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (call to confirm during these months). Closed:
Dec–Mar. Suggested visit: 2 hours.
Skellig Michael Boat Trip and Exploration
This fabulous adventure begins with a 45-minute boat ride to the larger of
the Skellig Islands, Skellig Michael. Once there, you can ascend the steep
steps that lead up to the monastery, which was founded in the sixth or
seventh century and flourished until the 12th or 13th century. Among the
ruins of the monastery complex, you’ll find a church, a number of small
beehive-style huts, and two oratories. The thousands of nesting gannets on
Little Skellig and the many puffins on nearby Puffin Island are quite a sight.
Most trips depart from Portmagee and takes about 45 minutes. Price: Currently about
40 ($64) per person. Ferries usually run only in the high season (Apr–Sept) and
depart between 9 a.m. and noon. For a trip from Portmagee, contact Des Lavelle

tages illustrates life in Kerry in the 1800s. It has a blacksmith’s
forge and house, a stable, a dairy house, a laborer’s house, a turf-
cutter’s house, a thatcher’s house, and a tradesman’s house. Plenty
of freshly cut turf is lying about. Dug out from bogs, turf was once
the main fuel for heating houses. Inside the dwellings are authentic
furnishings from across County Kerry.

Shopping
Plenty of small crafts shops dot the Ring of Kerry, but the best shopping
is in the town of Kenmare. You find a variety of specialty shops and sou-
venir stores and plenty of what the town is known for — Kenmare lace.
Cleo, 2 Shelbourne St., Kenmare (% 064-41-410), sells stylish women’s
clothes and is noted for its colorful tweed and linen items. The White
Room, Main Street, Kenmare (% 064-34-447), stocks a fine collection of
tablecloths, sheets, nightgowns, and more made with linen and the
famed Kenmare lace. Quills Woolen Market, corner of Market and Main
streets, Kenmare (% 064-32-277), has a fine selection of Irish crafts such
as Aran sweaters, Donegal tweeds, and Irish linen. If you’re a bargain-
hunter, check out the Quills outlet store (% 064-32-277) at South
Square in Sneem, which is about 20km (12 miles) from Kenmare along
the Ring of Kerry.

Tralee and the Dingle Peninsula
Don’t tell the Irish Tourism Board, but I think that the Dingle Peninsula is
even more beautiful than the Iveragh Peninsula and the Ring of Kerry.
While the Ring is dramatic, the Dingle Peninsula has a gentler beauty
(though, like the Iveragh Peninsula, it also boasts awe-inspiring views of
wave-pounded cliffs) and is less clogged with visitors. Long sandy
beaches, hills of a thousand different stunning shades of green divided
into a patchwork by old stone walls and hedges, extraordinary pre-
Christian ruins, craggy cliffs, and a large Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking 
area) — what more could you want? I also have a special place in my
heart for the sweet and funky town of Dingle (also known as An
Daingean, the town’s Irish name), with its many shops, restaurants, and
galleries, and its beautiful views of Dingle Harbor. The town is a busy
place in July and August, but it still manages to retain its friendly, artsy,
small-town character.
You may want to begin your exploration of the Dingle Peninsula (just
north of the Ring of Kerry) in Tralee, the little town known as the
Gateway to Kerry. Tralee is the capital town of County Kerry; it’s a pleas-
ant place to stay overnight, but there is not a lot to see or do in the
town. However, it is home of the world-famous Rose of Tralee Pageant,
the highlight of the annual Festival of Kerry. The festival lasts for five
days at the end of August and includes concerts, street entertainment,
and horse races leading up to the beauty and talent contest that names
the Rose (call the festival office at % 066-712-1322, or visit www.rose
oftralee.ie for more information).
If you are traveling without a car, Deros Tours (% 064-31-251;
www.derostours.com) runs a bus tour that takes you from Killarney
along the rugged Dingle coastline, past many of the prehistoric high-
lights of the peninsula. See p. 310 for more information on tours of the
Dingle Peninsula.
Chapter 16: County Kerry 303
The Puck Fair
For three days during the second week of August, Killorglin explodes into a fiesta of
music, drinking, storytelling, and general merrymaking during the Puck Fair. A billy goat
is crowned King Puck, and the ribbon-bedecked goat presides over the festivities from
a high pedestal. The origins of this celebration stretch far back — it is thought to have
originated as a pagan festival in honor of Lugh, the Celtic sun god. When I asked a
Killorglin gent whether he had taken part in the festivities for all three days, he replied
“Aye, and three nights.”

Alpine House

Dingle Town/An Daingean
People rave about this guesthouse. The sizable, bright rooms offer all sorts
of perks, such as tea- and coffeemaking facilities, hair dryers, direct-dial
phones, and central heating (sure beats huddling next to a radiator on
chilly days!). Plus you have use of a roomy guest lounge and can enjoy the
hospitality of Paul O’Shea. The heart of Dingle Town is just a two-minute
walk away, and the views of Dingle Bay are splendid.

The Captain’s House
$$
Dingle Town
I grew up in a turn-of-the-century house, with rooms of all different sizes,
and my stay in this late-19th-century former sea captain’s house, with its
nooks and crannies, reminded me of my childhood home. The bedrooms
are cozy, with warm lighting and lovely quilts, and there is an enchanting
garden outside. Your hosts, Mary and Jim Milhench, have decorated the
living rooms (you have three to choose from) with antiques, interesting
nautical objects (Jim is a Master Mariner), and souvenirs from their world
travels. The effect is at once homey and elegant. Breakfasts, served in the
conservatory, are an experience in themselves, as Mary offers everything
from fresh smoked kippers to homemade scones to eggs with local salmon.
The house has a fantastic location on a quiet side street right near the
heart of Dingle Town.

A 1790s manor house accommodation at these rates? Nope, you’re not
dreaming. Rooms here are clean and large, furnished with reproduction
antique furniture, but it’s the hosts that really make the place. Tony and
Ciara Fields are more than willing to help with plans, directions, and any-
thing else that you might need. The breakfasts are excellent, and the loca-
tion is superb: a ten-minute walk from downtown Tralee and perfect for
launching your visit to the Dingle Peninsula.

Tralee
This hotel is a winner in all categories. The staff is warm and helpful, and
the public rooms have that great old world hotel look, with lots of
mahogany and ornate plasterwork. Rooms are comfortable and up-to-date.
The hotel restaurant, Samuels, is a destination in itself, serving fresh, well-
prepared dishes. End your night in the lovely bar, where you will likely find
a convivial mix of locals and visitors.

Greenmount House
$$–$$$$
Dingle
Beware: The views of Dingle Bay and Dingle Town from this modern lodg-
ing may cause you to delay your day’s plans in favor of lingering over
breakfast or relaxing in the sitting room. Though the house doesn’t have
many rooms, it feels more like a small hotel than a B&B, with spacious
rooms (those in the bungalow building have sitting areas and balconies),
large bathrooms, upscale modern furniture, and extremely comfortable
beds. Service is kind and professional, but if you’re looking for a lot of
warmth and helpful hints from your hosts, you may be better off at
Milestone House or Alpine House. Breakfast is amazing in both scope and
quality — be sure to try some of the mouthwatering cheeses from the
buffet. The main streets of Dingle Town are about a 10- or 15-minute walk
away.

Milestone B&B

Dingle Town
It’s hard to do anything but gush about the Milestone, which is located
about a 15-minute walk from Dingle Town. The rooms are simple, impec-
cably clean, and bright, furnished with IKEA-style furniture; the views of
Dingle Bay are dazzling; and the breakfasts are excellent. But what sets
this B&B apart from the pack are your hosts, Michael and Barbara Carroll.
The Carrolls love the Dingle Peninsula, and they know it inside and out
(despite having moved here only about five years ago). Happily, they make
it their mission to share their knowledge with their guests, spending at
least 20 minutes helping visitors to plan an itinerary that suits their needs.
If this is your first time in Dingle, definitely book a room here.

Located on a working farm, this cozy B&B is situated in a rural area

maze of old stone walls creeping up a gentle hill, and a ruined stone house
next door. And the finest views are reserved for travelers whose bedroom
windows look out onto the nearby sea and the famed Blasket Islands.
Rooms are cozy and cute, with homey touches such as stuffed animals
perched on the furniture. The Irish-speaking family who runs the B&B is
warm and welcoming.

NEW IRISH
This place is like the restaurant equivalent of a spa treatment, with every-
thing from the country décor to the warm service conspiring to create a
relaxing atmosphere. The freshest of Irish ingredients are used in the
inventive dishes, which on my last visit included such gems as herb-
crusted skate with a leek and parmesan risotto, served with aged balsamic
vinegar; and a seared filet of Kerry beef with dauphinoise potatoes,
caramelized shallots, and port wine jus. The room is inviting, with stone
walls, stained glass windows, and pine tables set with a blue-and-orange
runner and mismatched pottery. It would be a shame to leave this restau-
rant without ordering their warm sticky toffee pudding.

If you’re looking for lobster, look no further — Doyle’s won’t disappoint.
Here, when you have lobster, you pick it out of a tank in the bar. Or you can
go for some variety with the popular seafood platter, a plate brimming with
sole, lobster, salmon, oysters, and crab claws. The menu depends on the
fresh seafood caught daily by local fishermen, so although you can’t
always depend on a certain dish, you can be sure whatever you get will be
fresh. The dining room is cozy, with plenty of brick and stone — you may
feel like you’re eating in someone’s wide-open kitchen.

The walls are a sunshine yellow, graced with contemporary oil paintings,
and (more importantly) the food is terrific. The chef is creative in prepar-

horseradish mashed potatoes and red wine jus, and my dad had pan-friend
mackerel in an oatmeal crust with a warm potato, butter bean, and orange
salad. Check out the early-bird specials, which include two or three

Unbeatable ice cream & amazing pastries
I would consider moving to Dingle Town just for Murphy’s Ice Cream, Strand Street,
Dingle (% 066-915-2644). The Murphy brothers opened their store in 2000 with a quest
to create the perfect ice cream, and I’d say they’re well on their way to attaining their
goal. The smooth ice cream is made with top-quality ingredients: Kerry cream and milk
(thank those cows the next time you drive past them), and the best natural flavorings,
such as Madagascar and Organic Mexican Vanilla in the vanilla ice cream, real
Champagne and peaches in the Bellini sorbet, Jamaican rum in the rum raisin, and so
on. You may want to go for one of the distinctly Irish flavors, such as Irish-cream ice
cream, black-currant-and-Guinness sorbet, or brown-bread ice cream. After intense
menu research, the delicious, caramel-tinged honeycomb ice cream has emerged as
my favorite.
O’Curnain’s Bakery (% 066-915-1583), located in the courtyard next to Dick Mack’s Pub
on Green St., sells divine pastries. Their fresh cream and apple pastry is perfection.

This bright little cafe draws its influences from around the world, with

The Old Pier
$$$–$$$$
Ballydavid
For me, there’s something about eating seafood with a view of the sea that
makes it taste even better, so I find the Old Pier’s view of Smerwick
Harbour very satisfying. Though the meat dishes are excellent, it’s the
seafood dishes — featuring locally caught fish and shellfish — that keep
bringing people back. Choices range from monkfish, brill, and salmon with
prawn sauce to black sole served in a butter, lemon, and parsley sauce.

Out of the Blue
$$$$
Dingle Town
SEAFOOD
The official name of this place is Out of the Blue Fresh Fish Seafood Only
Restaurant, because it serves only dishes that once swam or crawled
through the nearby briny deep (though it also offered a vegetarian plate
while I was there). A little pompous, maybe, but Out of the Blue is allowed
to be egotistical, because it serves the best seafood in Dingle Town. The
chalkboard menu changes daily depending on the catches of the day.
Preparations, such as skate (ray wings) with caper butter and haddock on
tomato sauce, are relatively simple and allow the flavor of the fish to
sparkle. The garlic crab claws are unbelievable. The restaurant itself has
Chapter 16: County Kerry 309

a Mediterranean feel, with simple pine tables; bright blue, yellow, and red
walls and ceiling; and oil paintings of fish and the sea gracing the walls.
Lunch here is much less expensive than dinner.

A dazzling tour of the Dingle Peninsula
Like the Ring of Kerry, the big attraction of the Dingle Peninsula is driv-
ing, biking, or hiking your way around, taking in all the scenery as well
as the many prehistoric ruins. I recommend starting in Castlemaine and
taking the coastal road (R561 or R559) toward Dingle Town. Along the
way, you may want to pay a visit to Inch Beach, a long sandy beach with
the Atlantic waves on one side and curvy, sea-grass-covered dunes on
the other. It’s a strange sight to stand on the dunes looking at the vast
Atlantic in one direction and grazing cows and sheep in the other. Move
on toward Dingle Town, which is a great place to spend a night or two
before driving the Slea Head Tour.
From Dingle Town, take the gorgeous 48km (33-mile) Slea Head Tour, a
round-trip circuit that takes you along the south coast, past miles and
miles of small patchwork fields, up the west end of the peninsula and
then back to Dingle Town. You may want to make your first stop at
pretty Ventry Beach, before visiting the remains of Dunbeg Fort, crea-
ted in 800 B.C. Right near Dunbeg Fort, look out for signs indicating the
location of beehive huts (known as clocháin in Irish), small stone struc-
tures that are thought to date from around 1000 B.C. The highlight of the
route is Slea Head, which features towering cliffs with incredible views
of the Atlantic ocean and the Blasket Islands (described later in this sec-
tion), sandy beaches (be aware the waters are not safe for swimming),
and several trail heads. Visit the village of Dún Chaoin (Dunquin), the
heart of the Dingle Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking area), with its striking views
of the Blasket Islands, before checking out the Blasket Centre and possi-
bly taking a boat trip to Great Blasket Island. You may want to have
lunch at Tig Áine and then move on to visit Clogher Strand, a small
beach with beautiful stones that look like they’re decorated with maps
from some undiscovered land (the beach is located off the second turn
after the Louis Mulcahy pottery shop). Next stop: Gallarus Oratory, an
astoundingly intact seventh-century Christian church built without any
sort of mortar. Adventurers will want to depart from the Slea Head Drive
at Feothanagh, driving east (and up) on narrow mountain roads through
Conor Pass, where you have a thrilling panoramic view of the entire
peninsula, plus views of several peaceful glacial lakes, and then down to
Part IV: Counties Cork and Kerry

the picture-postcard fishing villages of Cloghane and Brandon. From
there, you can drive east past unspoiled sandy beaches, cute fishing vil-
lages, and farmland. Note: Only confident drivers should attempt the
Conor Pass route, as it’s winding and steep.
This route will take you a whole day. I recommend staying in Dingle
Town or west of Dingle Town on the nights before and after your drive or
bike ride.
If you are visiting Dingle Peninsula without a car (and even if you have a
car) Sciuird Tours Bus and Walking Tour (% 066-915-1606) offers a
great three- or four-hour expert-led bus tour along the Slea Head drive,
with stops to enjoy the scenery and to explore four or five monuments
from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages (including Gallarus Oratory).
You’ll do some light walking. Tours leave daily at 10:30 a.m. and/or 2
p.m., as long as at least six people have booked (14 is the maximum).
Tours are 20 ($32) per person. Call for information on departure loca-
tion; pick-up is often available from Dingle Town accommodations. If you
want to take a personalized guided tour, contact Denis Ryan (% 086-
325-2996; www.dingletours.com), who takes travelers out to explore
the peninsula in his cab. Tours start at 20 ($32) per person.
The Slea Head route is superb for biking. You can rent bikes from Foxy
John’s, Main Street, Dingle (% 066-915-1316).
The Dingle Peninsula is also a wonderful place for hiking. See “Hiking,”
later in this section.
The Aqua Dome
Tralee
If your kids don’t think they’ve been on vacation if they haven’t gotten a
chance to submerge themselves in water, this indoor water park is the
place to go. Kids can splash around in the kiddie pools, fly down sky-high
slides, and battle raging rapids — all under one roof. Meanwhile, adults
can relax in the sauna dome, which has two saunas, a steam room, a cool
pool, and a sun bed. The main pool is for the whole family, and next door
is an over-16-only health suite (which is really just a spot with hot tubs
Chapter 16: County Kerry 311
The Sleeping Giant?
As you tour the Dingle Peninsula on the Slea Head Drive, keep an eye out for an island
that looks like a giant taking a snooze on his back. From most parts of the peninsula
he looks like he is slumbering peacefully. However, on other parts of the peninsula it
appears that he has a dagger embedded in his neck. In those parts, he is known as The
Murdered Bishop rather than the Sleeping Giant. 

and saunas). If you or your kids get sick of the water, there’s also a minigolf
course, remote-controlled trucks and boats, and a giant trampoline.
Dingle Road (next to the steam railway heading out of town). % 066-712-8899.
Admission: 12 ($19) adults, 10 ($16) children, and free for children under 2. Open:
July–Aug daily 10 a.m.–10 p.m.; Sept–June Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–10 p.m., Sat–Sun 10
a.m.–8 p.m. Suggested visit: As long as you like! 
Blasket Centre (Ionad an Bhlascaoid Mhoir)
Dunquin
This heritage center, on the tip of the Dingle Peninsula, celebrates the
Blasket Islands, which lie a few miles from the mainland. Great Blasket, the
largest of the islands, was home to a Gaelic-speaking community until the
1950s. Photographs, a video presentation, and other exhibits illustrate the
lives of the Blasket Islanders, who farmed and fished for sustenance and
have a rich storytelling and musical tradition. Much of the museum
focuses on the literary achievements of the Blasket Islanders — several
autobiographies and collections of Blasket Island tales were published
with great success. The exhibits, while very well done, are heavy on text,
so younger children may be bored. There are incredible views of the
islands through the large windows in the center. If you are interested in
visiting the Blasket Islands, see the information in the next review.
Village of Dunquin (right off the R559). % 066-915-6444. Admission: 3.70 ($5.90)
adults, 2.60 ($4.20) seniors, 1.30 ($2.10) children and students. Open: Easter–June
daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.; July–Aug daily 10 a.m.–7 p.m.; Sept–Oct daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m. Last
admission is 45 minutes before closing time. Closed: Nov–Easter. Suggested visit: 11⁄2
hours.
Blasket Islands
Intrigued by what you’ve seen and heard at the Blasket Centre? There’s
only one thing to do: Book a trip to peaceful Great Blasket Island, where
you can walk amongst the ruins of the village, hike the “green roads”
(roads that have been reclaimed by grass), and watch seals (and some-
times dolphins, porpoises, shark, and whales) from the white sand beach.
The Blasket Island Ferry departs from Dunquin Harbour. % 066-915-6422. Ferries
depart daily Apr–Sept 30 starting at 10:30 a.m. Reservations recommended. Tickets:
30 ($48) adults, 15 ($24) children under 12.
Corn Maze
Every year, a different maze is created in this 2.4-hectare (6-acre) field of
corn. Your mission (if you choose to accept it) is to actually make your
way through this labyrinth. Last year the maze theme was Harry Potter;
this year it is Fungie the Dingle Dolphin. Leave yourself at least an hour. 
Upper Main St. % 087-610-9563. 6 ($9.60), under 5 free. Mid-July to Aug daily 11–6

Harry Clarke stained glass windows at Díseart
Dingle
This Irish Cultural Centre contains a treasure of Irish art — six magnificent
stained glass windows created by master stained glass artist Harry Clarke
in 1922. The windows depict scenes from the Bible, with glowing colors
and tremendous detail, especially in the animated faces of the subjects.
An audio tour gives you the details on the history of Clarke and the win-
dows, and explains the scene portrayed in each window. On your way in
or out of Díseart, check to see if the center is holding any of their frequent
cultural events.
Off Green Street, behind St. Mary’s Church. % 066-915-2476. Admission: 3.50
($5.60). Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
Fungie the Dolphin
Dingle
Dingle’s most famous resident, Fungie the Dolphin, is a friendly, playful
dolphin who has been hanging out around the waters of Dingle Bay since
1984. He’s not in captivity, so theoretically, he could take off for bluer
waters at any time, but he’s stuck around for more than two decades, so
odds are good that he’s in Dingle to stay. Fungie seems to love playing with
humans, and if you take boat tour to see him (there are separate trips for
swimmers and nonswimmers), you will likely be treated to a display of
arcing jumps and up-close encounters as Fungie swims alongside the boat.
Plus you’ll have wonderful views of serene Dingle Bay. If you’re up for it, I
recommend going whole-hog and renting a wetsuit and snorkel gear so
that you can play with Fungie in the water. Floating peacefully in the blue
water of Dingle Bay and seeing this winsome creature eye-to-eye are worth
the initial shock of climbing into the cool water.
The Pier. % 066-915-2626 for boat trips; % 066-915-1967 for wetsuit hire and swim-
ming trips. Call to pick up a wetsuit and make reservations the day before for swim-
ming trips. Cost: Boat trip 16 ($26) adults, 8 ($13) children 2–12, and free for
children under 2; swimming trip 25 ($40); wetsuit 25 ($40) adults, 15 ($24) chil-
dren under 12. You can buy tickets for the boat ride at a kiosk at the pier. Call for times
and to reserve a spot.
Kerry County Museum
Tralee
Kerry’s history, starting 7,000 years ago, unfolds before you at this well-
done heritage center. Exhibits cover everything from myths and legends of
the county to local music to Gaelic football. The highlight just may be the
theme-park-style ride that takes you through a life-size exhibit of Tralee of
the Middle Ages, enhanced with sounds and even smells of the time.
Ashe Memorial Hall, Denny Street. % 066-712-7777. Admission: 8 ($13) adults,
6.50 ($10) students, 5 ($8) children. Open: May–Oct daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.;
Nov–Apr Tues–Sat 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m. Suggested visit: 11⁄2–2 hours.

More outdoor activities
Try some of these activities to get you out into the bracing Dingle air.
 Golfing: On Sandhill Road, you find Ballybunion Golf Club (% 068-
27-146; www.ballybuniongolfclub.ie), a seaside club with two
excellent 18-hole, par-71 courses. The newer course was fashioned
by the legendary Robert Trent Jones, though the Old Course is the
more challenging of the two. Greens fees are 180 ($288) for the
old course and 110 ($176) for the new, or 265 ($424) to play
both on the same day. Visitors are welcome, provided you call to
book in advance. The par-71 Tralee Golf Club, located at West
Barrow, Ardfert, in Tralee (% 066-713-6379; www.traleegolf
club.com), is the original European Arnold Palmer–designed
course. This course is set against an amazing backdrop, boxed in
by river, the sea, and the crumbling castles of Ardfert. Greens fees
are 180 ($288). Visitors are welcome from May to October every
day except Sunday. Visitors are not permitted on Wednesdays in
June, July, and August. You must book in advance either over the
phone or on the website.
 Hiking: The Dingle Way leaves from Tralee and makes a 153km (95-
mile) circuit of the peninsula. The trail winds through beaches and
farmland and along cliffs. For day-hikers, there is a beautiful stretch
between Dunquin and Ballyferriter, and another going northeast
out of Féohanagh. Get your hands on the Dingle Way Map Guide
(available at tourist offices and shops in the area) before you begin
the trail.
Another hiking trail, the Pilgrim’s Route (48km/30 miles), meanders
through the fields of the peninsula, connecting many of the penin-
sula’s interesting early Christian sites. The ascent to Mount
Brandon’s summit, located at the end of the Route, is difficult but
spectacular. Pick up a Pilgrim’s Route map (available at tourist
offices and shops in the area) before you begin the trail.
 Horseback riding: Mountain and beach rides are available through
Dingle Horse Riding (% 066-915-2199; www.dinglehorseriding.
com), located a mile outside of Dingle Town.
Shopping
Dingle Town is home to many artists, making it a fabulous place to buy
contemporary fine art as well as crafts. In addition, there are some great
pottery shops along roadsides throughout the Dingle Peninsula; just
drop in when you come across them.
Brian de Staic, Green Street, Dingle (% 066-915-1298), offers unique
handcrafted gold jewelry. Many of his pieces incorporate Celtic designs.
West Kerry Craft Gallery, Main Street (% 066-915-2976), features
works by an assortment of wonderful Dingle craftspeople. Dingle
Part IV: Counties Cork and Kerry

Record Shop, Green Street (across from St. Mary’s Church; % 087-
298-4550), is a great place to buy traditional music recordings. Out on
the peninsula, well-known craftsman Louis Mulcahy (% 066-915-6229)
creates lustrous pieces of pottery. Mulcahy’s workshop is located about
4km (2.5 miles) west of Ballyferriter.
Hitting the pubs
The Dingle Peninsula, and Dingle Town in particular, is a great place for
music. Drop into most any pub during the summer, and you’ll hear tin
whistles, fiddles, pipes, and other instruments going strong.
Dick Mack’s
Dingle Town
Undoubtedly one of Ireland’s quaintest pubs, Dick Mack’s retains an aura
of times gone by — years ago, pubs often doubled as providers of other
essential services; this one doubled as a cobbler’s shop, and one side of
the place still holds the leatherworking tools of the late owner. There is a
great little snug at the end of the bar side and an authentic back room that
once served as the kitchen. Apparently, when Tom Cruise and Nicole
Kidman stayed in Dingle while filming Far and Away, they fell in love with
the place. Many other stars have stopped in for a pint — there’s even a
little walk of fame outside.
Green Street. % 066-915-1960.
The Dingle Pub
Dingle Town
Facing the harbor and easily distinguished by the green-and-white sham-
rock outside, this place is just what it sounds like: the pub that represents
Dingle. The inside of the pub is much like Dingle itself: It seems as though
nothing’s changed in generations, and you can relax in the laid-back atmos-
phere. Stop in for a pint and a talk with the locals.
Main Street, at the harbor. % 066-915-1370.
Chapter 16: County Kerry 315
Irish folk theater
Siamsa Tire: The National Folk Theatre of Ireland, Town Park, Tralee (% 066-712-3055;
www.siamsatire.com), performs theater that celebrates the rich dance, music,
and folklore traditions of Ireland.
Past performances have included beautiful theatrical and musical retellings of the
Irish myths of the Children of Lir and Oisín’s Return to Tír na nÓg (the land of eternal
youth), a production about the people of the Blasket Islands, and a show celebrating
life on a small Irish farm a century ago.

Kirby’s Old Brogue Inn
Tralee
This bright-yellow alehouse has dubbed itself “your landmark in Tralee.”
Given the great atmosphere and food, it probably will be. Its quaint exte-
rior gives way to a wonderful old pub inside, where you’ll hear traditional
Irish music and jazz in the summers, and where you can nosh on glorified
pub grub all day — steaks and seafood barside are quite a treat.
Rock Street. % 066-712-3357.
Natterjack
Castlegregory
This old pub, which concentrates more on great traditional music and food
than on the latest trend in décor, is a perfect place to stop in for a bite and
a refreshing pint after the drive to the north end of the peninsula. The pub
offers a children’s menu and a beer garden in summertime.
The West End. % 066-713-9491.
O’Flaherty’s
Dingle Town
You can count on the music in O’Flaherty’s to be good — the owner fre-
quently performs. Check out the posters and clippings that line the walls
to get a real feel for Dingle Town. Everything about this place screams
authentic, and the locals who frequent it often chat in Irish Gaelic. It’s big
and open, and because of the stone-flagged floor, it doesn’t exactly get
cozy until it gets full.

Part V
The West and the
Northwest

In this part . . . 
You can’t beat the West and Northwest for their sheer
diversity of landscapes. In Clare (Chapter 17), take in
the steep Cliffs of Moher, plummeting down to the sea; the
rocky moonscape of the Burren, studded with a rainbow of
wildﬂowers; and the county’s sandy beaches. Up in County
Galway (Chapter 18), explore the wild lakes, bogs, mountains,
and beaches of Connemara, and gaze out at peaceful Galway
Bay. Mayo (Chapter 19) offers gorgeous heather-covered
islands, beaches, and a continuation of the Connemara land-
scape of bogs, cliffs, and mountains, while travelers to Sligo
(Chapter 19) will ﬁnd lakes, beaches, and woodlands, many
connected in some way with poet W.B. Yeats. If you want to
get way off the well-trodden track, head up to wild, sparsely
populated County Donegal (Chapter 20) and explore the
craggy coastline, towering cliffs, sandy beaches, and impres-
sive mountains of the region.
And I haven’t even mentioned the cities and towns in these
parts. Westport in County Mayo (Chapter 19) is one of the
most charming, bustling, and picturesque towns in Ireland.
Sligo Town (Chapter 19), a friendly town with a healthy arts
scene, is an ideal base for exploring sights associated with
Yeats. Limerick (Chapter 17) has shed its image of dilapida-
tion, and offers some excellent historic sights, restaurants,
and pubs, while Ennis is a small town with winding medieval
streets and a fair share of traditional Irish music. And Galway
City (Chapter 18) may turn out to be your favorite city in
Ireland, with its beautiful location on the shores of Galway
Bay and Lough Corrib, its tremendous selection of excellent
restaurants, and its thriving pubs and traditional Irish music
scenes.

S
ure, County Clare is famous for the sheer, breathtaking Cliffs of
Moher. But this county is no one-trick pony. In the north, you’ll find
the rocky moonscape of The Burren, with its diversity of plant species
poking up through cracks in the rocks (where else can you find Arctic
and tropical plants flowering side by side?). In the south are long sandy
stretches of beach backed by rolling green hills. And throughout the
county are charming towns and villages whose pubs ring to the rafters
with some of the best traditional music in all of Ireland.
Many people know County Limerick through Frank McCourt’s Angela’s
Ashes, in which Limerick City is depicted as a sodden and sullen place.
Yes, it rains in Limerick (as it does all over the West of Ireland), but you
may be surprised at the new restaurants, shops, and attractions that are
popping up all over the city. Though it’s still not a destination city, it is
worth a stop if you are interested in any of the attractions in the area,
including Adare, a sweet little village of thatched-roof cottages with
some excellent restaurants.
County Limerick: Limerick City and Adare
County Limerick has never exactly been the tourist hub of the country,
but many visitors to Ireland pass through at some point. Those who
have read Frank McCourt’s Angela’s Ashes often picture Limerick City as
a town wracked with poverty, unemployment, alcoholism, and rain —
lots of rain. “Out in the Atlantic Ocean,” McCourt writes, “great sheets of

our only dry place. . . . Limerick gained a reputation for piety, but we
knew it was only the rain.”
The whole west of Ireland does get its fair share of rain, but you’ll be sur-
prised to see how different in all other respects the Limerick of today is
from the Limerick McCourt remembers from his youth. In recent years,
the city has been pulling itself up from near dilapidation and is becom-
ing a bustling place with a crop of great restaurants and good shopping,
plus an excellent museum and several historic sights. Some places in the
city still fit McCourt’s description, but these are becoming fewer and
fewer, as funky cafes open up in previously boarded-up buildings, and so
on. A stroll along the River Shannon offers a striking vista of the city, and
the imposing sight of King John’s Castle is never far from view. Limerick
City still isn’t a destination city, like Dublin, Cork, Belfast, and Galway
are, but it is worth a stop if you are in the area and are interested in any
of the attractions listed in this section.

With its main street of thatched-roof cottages sporting window boxes
full of flowers, narrow streets, and ruined ivy-covered churches, the
pretty little town of Adare looks like a set for a movie about old Ireland.
The town is clearly geared for tourism, and you find no lack of fellow
travelers enjoying the little shops, excellent restaurants, and handful of
historic sights. You don’t need more than a day at most to explore.
Getting to County Limerick
Shannon International Airport (% 061-71-2000; www.shannonairport.
com), located on the N19, off the N18, south of Ennis and 24km (15 miles)
west of Limerick City, receives direct flights from North America,
Europe, and Britain (see Chapter 6 for more information), as well as
flights from within Ireland. Rental-car company desks are located at
Shannon Airport’s Arrivals Hall. All the major car-rental companies
listed in Chapter 7 are represented there. Bus Éireann (% 01-836-6111;
www.buseireann.ie) offers service from Shannon to the Limerick Bus
and Rail Station and other destinations.
Getting to and around Limerick City
If you’re coming by car, Limerick City can be reached by the N20 from
Cork, N21 from Tralee, N24 from Tipperary, N7 from Dublin, or N18 from
Ennis and Galway.
Irish Rail (% 1-850-366-222; www.irishrail.ie) services Limerick City
from Dublin, Cork, Killarney, and other cities throughout Ireland. Trains
arrive at Colbert Station, Parnell Street, and Limerick. Bus Éireann 
(% 01-836-6111; www.buseireann.ie) has daily service to Limerick
City (Colbert Station, Parnell St.) and most towns in County Limerick.
Limerick City is best seen on foot. Park near King John’s Castle (for
free!), and hoof it from sight to sight. (Parking elsewhere in Limerick City
requires discs that can be purchased at local shops.) A car is your best
way of getting to the major attractions throughout the county, though
Limerick has local bus service that covers the city’s suburbs — running
from Colbert Station on Parnell Street — and Bus Éireann has service to
other parts of the county. You can also catch a cab at Colbert Station
(the train and bus station) or call Top Cabs (% 061-41-7417).
Getting to and around Adare
By car, take N21 southwest from Limerick City. Bus Éireann (% 01-836-
6111) runs through Adare. The town itself is completely walkable.

Adare Manor Hotel and Golf Resort
$$$$
Adare
If nothing but the very best will do, this is the place for you. This tremen-
dous castlelike manor house is one of the most beautiful properties in
Ireland. There is nothing subtle about it — the structure was designed to
reflect a variety of Irish and English homes admired by the first owners,
the Lord and Lady Dunraven. It is an amalgam of styles, with turrets, 52
chimneys, and stone gargoyles gracing its exterior. The public rooms are
breathtaking, especially the giant hall inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at
Versailles. Opulent fabrics, hand-carved woodwork and stone, and gor-
geous views of a river characterize the private rooms. And I haven’t even
mentioned the 226-hectare (840-acre) grounds. The perfectly groomed
emerald grounds boast a Robert Trent Jones–designed golf course (home
to the Irish Open in 2007, 2008, and 2009), a trout-filled river, formal French
gardens, sweeping parklands, and majestic trees. A spa on the premises
provides all sorts of relaxing treatments.

Carrabawn House

Adare
Attention to detail and warm hospitality are the cornerstones of this lux-

roomy house that you’re sure to feel welcome in. It’s right on Adare’s main
road, putting all of County Limerick’s attractions within easy reach. Rooms
are simply and tastefully decorated and are fully equipped with conven-
iences: television, phone, hair dryer, and a tea and coffeemaker. Be sure

Other hotels are going to seem like roughing it after you stay in the luxu-

into the hotel, where rooms are decorated with antique furniture. Modern-
day does seep into some parts, though: There is a pool, a steam room, and
a gym for guests’ use, and many of the rooms have Wi-Fi access. Service
can run from cool to welcoming and friendly.

Jurys Inn Limerick
$$
Limerick City
This hotel is your standard, comfortable place to stay, and though the
rooms are rather nondescript, the location is great — in the heart of the
city. Best of all, though, kids stay free. This is one of the few places in
Ireland that charges a flat room rate for up to three adults or two adults
and two children, so if there are more than two of you, it’s a great value.
There is an informal restaurant and a pub on the premises, and a nearby
public parking lot is convenient for those with a car.

This cool, modern restaurant does a bang-up job with both Thai and Indian
standards and novel twists on these dishes, such as the monkfish curry
with tandoori-roasted eggplant, tomatoes, and onions. The chef uses
spices boldly to complement the flavors of the meat, fish, or vegetables.
Large abstract paintings with fiery colors hang on the wall, small teardrop-
shaped lamps dangle from the ceiling, and hammered-copper glasses and
pitchers grace the tables. There are a number of excellent vegetarian
options here, including the okra with crunchy spiced onions. The 25

CHINESE
This place is widely acknowledged as the best spot for Chinese food in the
Limerick area, with a menu that ranges from standard North American/
European Chinese dishes, such as General Tso’s chicken, to an excellent
roast duck Cantonese-style. Not only is the food fantastic, but the crisp
table linens and warm lighting also make for a nice atmosphere. A word 
to the wise: If you’re really hungry, get some soup as a starter, because
service can be slow.

The Mustard Seed at Echo Lodge
$$$$
Ballingarry
NEW IRISH
The surroundings are gorgeous enough to distract your attention, but even
endless gardens, a splashing fountain, and a beautiful country manor can’t
take away the impact of the food at the Mustard Seed. You’ll spend a bit
more than at many other places mentioned in this book, but you’ll get a
true gourmet meal in return. Organic vegetables (from the restaurant’s
own garden), fruits, and cheeses, combined with local meats and fish, are
the foundation of the adventurous dishes. The menu changes all the time.
Recently, some of the gems included pan-fried filets of sea bass with
caramelized endive, onion veloute, and an avocado and sweet corn salsa;
and the imaginative breast of Barbary duck on a bed of buttered greens,
served with lime and vanilla mashed potatoes and chocolate oil. The
atmosphere is calm and gracious. Early in the week a special two-course
early bird menu is available from 7 to 8 p.m.

The Wild Geese
$$$$
Adare
NEW IRISH
Just to give you an idea of the kind of restaurant this is, when the gracious
server came around with the bread basket, in addition to the usual white
and wheat rolls, we were offered banana rolls, which turned out to be
excellent. The chef here is not afraid to use his locally sourced ingredients
with a sense of fun and daring. The menu changes, but expect main
courses such as a breast of corn-fed chicken stuffed with brie and sun-
dried tomatoes, wrapped in pancetta and served with a wild-mushroom
risotto, and appetizers such as the onion-and-parmesan tartlet studded
with raisins. The interior is simple and candlelit, and the mood is convivial.
An early-bird menu, served Sunday to Friday from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m., is a
terrific deal at 35 ($56) for three courses.

Exploring Limerick City and Adare
Limerick City has enough interesting sights to make a full day of sightsee-
ing. Adare really only has one major attraction — the Heritage Centre —
but it’s a lovely place to wander for a few hours.
Joining an organized tour
The popular two-hour Angela’s Ashes Walking Tour covers many sights
mentioned in Frank McCourt’s book. Tours leave daily at 2:30 p.m. from
the tourist office at Arthur’s Quay. Book by calling % 061-32-7108 or
087-635-3648. Tours cost 10 ($16).
Join experienced tour guides for an informative and interesting 90-
minute historical walking tour, covering many of Limerick’s most inter-
esting historical sights. Tours leave from the tourist office on Arthur’s
Quay daily at 11 a.m. Price is 10 ($16) per person. You can book at 
% 061-31-7522, or just show up.
If you’d rather see the town on your own, pick up the well-done Tourist
Trail walking-tour map at the visitor center.
If you are interested in a longer cruise on the Shannon, check out the
seven-day barge cruises offered on the Shannon Princess (% 087-251-

and cities while sleeping and eating (gourmet meals) on the barge.
Seeing the top attractions
Adare Heritage Centre
Adare
This museum does a nice job of presenting the tumultuous history of
Adare through displays, text, and audiovisuals. The highlight is the model
of Adare during the Middle Ages; various areas light up in sync with a 20-
minute narration. A 20-minute video also presents the town as it is today,
which is interesting, but I suggest you spend the time seeing the real thing
instead. The Heritage Centre is also the starting point for tours of Adare
Castle, a handsome example of a medieval fortified castle (6/$9.60 adults,
5/$8 students, children over 10, and seniors). Stop into the craft and
knitwear shops on the premises, and pop into the cafe for some fresh-
baked bread. Books are available if you want to know more about the area,
and there is a tourist information desk on-site. This place should give you
a sense of what else you want to see in and around town.

Hunt Museum
Limerick City
Located in Limerick’s beautifully refurbished Custom House, this
museum’s art collection was generously donated by the Hunt family and
includes many world-class pieces that occasionally go out on loan to inter-
national exhibitions. The range of art is extremely wide, with Picasso and
da Vinci sculptures; medieval paintings, jewelry, and crystal; ancient
Egyptian, Greek, and Roman pieces; and a great deal of Irish art and arti-
facts from as far back as prehistoric times. Highlights include a gold cross
once owned by Mary Queen of Scots, and a menu designed by Picasso.
The fabulous shop in the lobby sells classy souvenirs, and the museum
restaurant serves light meals.

King John’s Castle
Limerick City
This impressive fortress, on the banks of the River Shannon, was the brain-
child of King John, who commissioned it in 1210, and whose name will for-
ever be linked with it in the public mind (even though its real name is
Limerick Castle). Clearly a place built to keep people out rather than hold
court or host lavish parties, this castle is one of the finest examples of a
fortified Norman structure in Ireland. Fierce war defenses sit in the court-
yard (how often do you get to manhandle a real battering ram?), and you
can get a great view of the city from the corner towers. The interior has
been completely restored. To get a complete understanding of the castle’s
function over the centuries, check out the interpretive center. Models, dis-
plays, and graphics combine to explain the past, and the show The Story
of Limerick explains the turbulent history of this city in an interesting way.
Nicholas Street (east of the Thomond Bridge, at the corner of Nicholas and Castle
streets). % 061-41-1201. Admission: 8.35 ($13) adults, 6.25 ($10) seniors and stu-

sion at 4 p.m.); May–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m. (last admission at 4:30 p.m.);
Nov–Feb daily 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m. (last admission at 3:30 p.m.). Suggested visit: 11⁄2 hours.
Lough Gur
Southeast of Limerick City
Burial mounds, a wedge tomb, a dwelling built between 500 and 1000 A.D.,
a 4,000-year-old stone circle (the largest in Ireland), and other treasures
surround a glittering lake at this rich archeological site, which was con-
tinuously inhabited from prehistoric to late medieval times. An interpre-
tive center, housed in authentic-looking Stone Age huts right on the
location of the original settlement, features models of unearthed tools,
weapons, and pottery, plus audiovisual displays and text about different
aspects of the site. There are regular walking tours of the area, but I rec-
ommend exploring on your own with a map from the visitor center.

Shopping
Limerick, like nearly all of Ireland’s major cities, is a hub of shopping for
the surrounding region. The main city thoroughfares, O’Connell Street
and William Street, are lined with small shops and department stores.
You won’t find a load of places that sell souvenirs; the shopping here is
vast and varied, but it mainly suits the needs of the people who live here.
Limerick City has two major shopping areas — one old and one new. The
Milk Market (corner of Wickham and Ellen streets) is a restored
medieval marketplace. Bordered by the original city walls, this quaint
area offers country produce and arts and crafts on Saturdays. From
Monday to Saturday, stalls and open-fronted shops make up the market,
selling all sorts of products, including secondhand clothes and books.
Most of city’s real shopping gets done at the Arthur’s Quay Centre, a
modern mall in the heart of town. Inside this open, multistoried mall are
30 stores and places to eat. Locals also shop at Cruises Street Shopping
Center, a complex of more than 50 retail outlets. O’Mahony’s, 120
O’Connell St., Limerick (% 061-41-8155), has a great selection of books,
maps, and stationery. You can catch up on your Joyce or write friends
back home in style.
In Adare, on the main street, Michelina and George Stacpoole sell
sophisticated, brightly colored knitwear; great old Irish prints and post-
cards; old and rare books; and a vast selection of antiques in George
Stacpoole Antiques (% 061-39-6409; www.stacpooleantiques.com).

Castle Lane Tavern
Limerick City
This beautiful tavern’s décor (a medieval re-creation, in sort of a Disney
way) is so detailed and authentic-looking, you may be tempted to summon
the barmaid with a hearty “Beer, wench!” — but I don’t recommend it. I do
suggest you grab a drink and maybe some soup or a sandwich and settle
into one of the comfortable sunken benches or stools. The tavern is right
next to King John’s Castle and just down a cobbled alleyway. The whole
area gives the pleasant feeling of being in a time warp.

Hunt Museum) and the Old Court House. When weather permits, there’s

city). Of course, there are also those who consider McCourt the local boy

County Clare
County Clare sometimes gets lost somewhere between the dazzle of
Counties Galway and Kerry, but people who skip this county are missing
out on some of Ireland’s finest scenery and several interesting historic
(and prehistoric) attractions. They are also missing out on great little
towns and villages that are less heavily visited than those in Counties
Galway and Kerry. In the north, The Burren is a strange and breathtaking
sea of cracked rocks that is home to several archeological sights and an
incredible range of plant life, including species that normally thrive only
in Arctic or tropical climates. To the south, there are the famed sheer
Cliffs of Moher, and a stretch of long sandy beaches backed by gently

rolling farmland. Main attractions include two completely restored and
furnished castles from the Middle Ages, and a sprinkling of ancient
sights. Clare doesn’t have any large cities, but it’s dotted with quaint
towns and villages, such as Doolin, Lahinch, and Milltown Malbay, that
boast terrific traditional music (Doolin in particular). Ennis, the main
town in the county, is one of my favorite towns in Ireland. Its medieval
streets are bustling and lively with a mix of locals and visitors, and there
is excellent traditional music every night.

Annagh, Miltown Malbay
This is a must-stay for any serious gourmet. Originally a well-known cook-

colorfully decorated, but the real draw of the place is the food, grown and

consider taking one of the cooking classes — special weekend rates com-
bine rooms with classes. Views of farmlands and sea are spectacular.

This bright-yellow Georgian hotel is in the center of Bunratty village, with
the famed pub Durty Nelly’s and the castle (home of the celebrated
medieval banquets) just across the street. Rooms are tastefully decorated

Dromoland Castle
$$$
Newmarket-on-Fergus
If you have ever had fantasies of living in a castle, this place is calling your
name. The 19th-century building (built to replace the original 16th-century
structure) has all the round and square towers and crenellations that fairy-
tales have embedded in the collective Western subconscious. Public
spaces and rooms are magnificently decked out with crystal chandeliers,
portraits, and oak paneling, and rooms are luxuriously furnished. Ask for
a room in the main wing, as rooms in the newer wings, though still beau-
tiful, feel more like standard hotel rooms than castle suites. The hotel and
picturesque grounds have everything that modern royalty could require,
including a spa, an excellent golf course, fishing, boating, gardens, restau-
rants, and a gracious and helpful staff. Dromoland is located near Shannon
Airport, making it the perfect first or last night’s stop in Ireland.

tours, call or visit the Galway Tourist Office (also known as Ireland West
Tourism or Aras Fáilte) on Forster Street, just off Eyre Square, Galway
City (% 091-53-77-00; www.irelandwest.ie). Healy Tours (% 091-77-

tours depart from the Galway tourist office daily during the summer and
a few times a week during the off-season (call for schedules).
The top attractions
Aillwee Cave
The Burren
A guide takes you down into this vast cave, where you see ancient stalag-
mites and stalactites, cross bridges that span frighteningly deep chasms,
and get wet standing near the crashing underground waterfall. You’ll also
be taken into the eerie hibernation chamber of the brown bear that inhab-
ited this area 10,000 years ago. Back above ground, you can shop for min-
erals and fossils, watch as cheese is being made in the on-site dairy (an
odd attraction at a cave, but an interesting one nonetheless), and have a
light snack in the tearoom.

Bunratty Castle and Folk Park
Bunratty
This formidable castle, built in 1425 and pillaged many times, is one of
Ireland’s biggest attractions. It’s one of the most authentic medieval cas-
tles in the country, and great care has been taken to ensure that the inte-
rior is as it was in the 15th century, with furnishings and tapestries that
reflect the era. Great halls and tiny stairways characterize the castle, and
the dungeon is quite eerie. On the castle grounds is the Bunratty Folk Park,
an excellent re-creation of a 19th-century Irish village. You can poke your
head into farmhouses, a blacksmith’s forge, and a watermill, and go down
a typical village street that has it all: post office, school, pawn shop,
doctor’s house, printers, hardware shop, and a real pub where you can
stop in for a bite and a drink. At night, Bunratty Castle hosts huge medieval
banquets (see the nearby sidebar “Feasting at a castle!”).

The Burren
Northwest County Clare
Don’t miss this awesome phenomenon — a vast expanse of cracked lime-
stone, as far as the eye can see, that’s home to a variety of unique plants
and animals. The name Burren comes from the Irish bhoireann, for “a rocky
place,” and the “rocky” designation is totally accurate. You find expansive
fields of broken stone, interrupted every so often by a small river or pond.
Because the limestone covers a maze of underground caves, water seeps
up through cracks in the rock, supporting a wide and spectacular variety
of flowers and plants, including species that usually thrive only in the
Arctic or Mediterranean. Lizards, badgers, frogs, and numerous birds call
The Burren home. In addition, 26 species of butterflies have been seen
here, including one that’s indigenous to the area: the lovely Burren Green.
Despite the lack of soil, humans lived in the area from the Neolithic period
through medieval times, leaving behind a variety of structures from dol-
mens (burial monuments) to ancient cooking sites to churches. Though
there is much to be enamored with at ground level, don’t forget to look up
at the glorious views of Clare and Galway Bay.
The best way to explore The Burren is by walking. You can either set off on
foot or bicycle on part (or all) of the 42km (26-mile) Burren Way, which
leads from Ballyvaughan to the Cliffs of Moher (you can get an informa-
tion sheet on the trail from any tourist office in the area), or join a guided
tour. I recommend the latter choice, as the terrain is rough and a guide can
help you to truly understand the history, geology, and biology of this amaz-
ing place. The hands-down best guided tours are those by Shane Connolly
(% 065-707-7168; call ahead to book and find out details), a scholar of
Chapter 17: Counties Limerick and Clare 337

The Burren who covers the history, folklore, animal and plant life, and geol-
ogy of the area. The Burren is at its most colorful, with tons of wildflowers,
in May and June, but you’ll find a variety of flora year-round. You may want
to begin your exploration of The Burren at The Burren Centre (see the next
review). It is worth packing a pair of hiking shoes with ankle support for
your visit to The Burren.
Burren Centre
Kilfenora
This excellent center presents a fascinating and clear introduction to the
natural and social history of The Burren through audiovisuals and
exhibits. I recommend visiting if you’re planning to explore the area.
Kilfenora. % 065-708-8030. Admission: 6 ($9.60) adults, 5 ($8) seniors and stu-
dents, 4 ($4.80) children under 16, free for children under 6. Open: July–Aug 9:30
a.m.–6 p.m. mid-Mar to May and Sept–Nov 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (last admission 30 minutes
before closing time).
The Cliffs of Moher
Spectacular doesn’t begin to describe the view from these breathtaking
sheer cliffs. At places, they rise more than 213m (700 ft.) above the crash-
ing Atlantic and stretch for miles in both directions. On the highest cliff is
O’Brien’s Tower, which was built in the 1800s as a viewing point for
tourists. From the tower, you can see the Clare coast, the Aran Islands,
and, on a clear day, mountains as far away as Kerry and Connemara. When
it’s sunny, the cliffs take on a purple hue (hence, the Purple Cliffs of Moher,
of story and song), and when the wind and rain blow in, it can be a bit har-
rowing up there. The cliffs can be very touristy during the high season, so
be prepared for Irish fiddlers in the parking lot and so on. If you are look-
ing for cliffs that are almost as spectacular but don’t draw as many visi-
tors, head up to the towering cliffs of Slieve League (p. 394).
A flashy new visitor center has just opened at the Cliffs with a permanent
interpretative exhibit called the Atlantic Edge. The exhibit is relatively
small, featuring a 3-D movie that makes you feel as if you’re soaring over
the Cliffs, pictures of and quotations from people associated with this area,
and some interactive pieces dealing with the science of the Cliffs. The 4
($6.40) for adult admission price is a little steep for such a small display,
so I would only go if you know that you usually enjoy this type of exhibit.
One of the best ways to appreciate the grandeur of the Cliffs of Moher is
to see them from the ocean. Cliffs of Moher Cruises (% 065-707-5949;
www.cliffs-of-moher-cruises.com) makes one-hour trips to the Cliffs
daily between April 1 and October 31 (weather-permitting). During the

Knappogue Castle
Quinn
This imposing 15th-century castle has seen its share of history. Built by
the McNamaras, it was the pride of the tribe, which dominated the area
for 1,000 years. But the stronghold had its troubles. In the 1700s,
Cromwell’s troops occupied the castle for ten years; and during the War of
Independence in the 1920s, revolutionary forces camped within its walls.
The castle has been extraordinarily refurbished, and the interior is over-

Feasting at a castle
Bunratty and Knappogue castles both stage fun (albeit touristy) medieval banquets,
complete with a feast of food and lively entertainment.
Both castles feature a delicious feast (eaten with your hands, of course) and period
music and song (including harp and fiddle music and medieval choral singing), and
both are presided over by the “earl,” who will fill you in on the history of the castle.
Generally, people seem to prefer the Knappogue banquet, which feels slightly less
touristy.
The Corn Barn in Bunratty Folk Park hosts Traditional Irish Nights, which aim to repli-
cate a night of celebration in old Ireland. You’ll dine on Irish stew, brown bread, and
apple pie with cream, and then listen to live foot-tapping Irish music.
Reservations are required for all of these events; call % 061-36-0788. The Bunratty
banquet costs 58 ($93) per adult, the Knappogue banquet costs 55 ($88) per adult,
and the Traditional Irish Night costs 48 ($77) per adult. Children ages 12 and under
get discounted rates.

McGann’s
Doolin
This Doolin pub has excellent traditional Irish music and well-pulled pints
of Guinness, and is often less packed than O’Connor’s (reviewed later in
this section).
Lisdoonvarna Road. % 065-707-4133.
Monk’s Pub
Ballyvaughan
Peat fires burn and rustic furnishings invite you to take a seat at this pub.
It’s right on the water, and good pub grub is served all day (the seafood
chowder is unbelievable). Music fills the air on many nights.
Main Street. % 065-707-7059.
O’Briens
Miltown Malbay
This is the cutest pub in all of Ireland. It is just larger than a walk-in-
closet — room enough for one bench, two bar stools, a 4-foot bar, and a
single Guinness tap (don’t worry — the pints are full-size). Joe Murray runs
the place and keeps things shipshape.
Main Street. No phone.
O’Connor’s
Doolin
This is one of the premier spots in the country for traditional sessions,
and fans travel from all over to hear them. The same family has run this
combination pub and market for more than 150 years. The pub sits amid

a row of thatched fisherman cottages and really comes to life at night. If
this proves too packed (it seems everyone knows about O’Connor’s), head
up to McGann’s (reviewed earlier in this section).
Off the N67, west of Lisdoonvarna. % 065-707-4168.

This welcoming pub, in the Old Ground Hotel, plays host to locals and visi-

reckoned with.

Chapter 18
County Galway: 
Galway City, the Aran
Islands, and Connemara
In This Chapter
 Hearing some great traditional Irish music in Galway City
 Dining in the best restaurants in the West
 Visiting the peaceful Aran Islands, bastions of tradition
 Exploring the vast boglands, mountains, and coastlines of Connemara 
(and meeting some sweet Connemara ponies!)
C
ounty Galway is a winning combination of the fun and bustle of
Galway City with its great music, pubs, restaurants, and shops; the
wild and breathtaking mountain-and-bog landscape of Connemara; the
peaceful Aran Islands; picturesque small towns; and one of the largest
Gaeltachts (Irish-speaking regions) in the country.
Galway City
Buzzing Galway City serves as a gateway to the rest of the county. It’s a
fabulous city to explore, with a youthful university population; constant
street entertainment; a robust arts scene; loads of traditional Irish
music; and a great variety of both trendy and traditional places to eat,
sleep, drink, and shop. One gets the sense that the city caters to visitors
and locals equally — they certainly don’t roll up the sidewalk when the
visitors go home. The city also has a gorgeous location, set on peaceful
Galway Bay, which is home to a number of swans, and the River Corrib, a
favored fishing location. The only thing that Galway City doesn’t have is
major sights within the city; there are places to visit, but there aren’t any
must-see attractions. The medieval center of the city is so tiny that
you’ll know your way around in no time.

County Galway
Chapter 18: County Galway 345
I would spend just one day exploring Galway City itself, but it is a great
place to base yourself for daytrips to Connemara, the Aran Islands, The
Burren, and other County Galway and County Clare attractions.
Getting to and around Galway City
Aer Lingus (% 0818-365-000; www.aerlingus.com) has daily service
from Dublin into Galway Airport, in Carnmore (% 091-75-5569; www.
galwayairport.com). The best way to get into town from the airport is
by taxi, which should cost about 16 ($26).
If you’re driving to Galway City, take the N4 and N6 from Dublin, or the
N17 from Sligo. If you’d like to rent a car in Galway, try Budget (% 091-
566-376), on Eyre Square.
Irish Rail (% 1-850-366-222; www.irishrail.ie) pulls into Ceannt
Station, near Eyre Square, in the center of Galway, from Dublin and other

points. Bus Éireann (% 01-836-6111; www.buseireann.ie) also travels
to Ceannt Station. The private coach service CityLink (% 1-890-28-08-08;
www.citylink.ie) travels between Galway and Dublin. The rail trip
takes about two and a half hours and the bus trip takes three and a half.
Galway City is best seen on foot. The town is compact, and the heart is
pedestrian-only, so a car wouldn’t do you much good. If you do take a
car into the city, know that parking in Galway City requires discs that
you can purchase at local shops. Galway has a great local bus service
that covers the city’s suburbs, running from the city center (many
routes start at Roches Store on Eyre St. near Eyre Square) out to Salthill
and the coastal towns. Contact Galway City Direct Bus Company
(% 091-860-814; www.citydirectgalway.com) for schedules and fares.
You can pick up a taxi on Eyre Square or by calling a taxi company such
as Abby Taxi (% 091-533-333) or Cara Cabs (% 091-563-939).
Anchored by Eyre Square (Eyre is pronounced air), the city’s picturesque
main streets stretch down to the harbor.

Devondell House

Galway City
Berna Kelly should run a school for aspiring B&B hosts and hostesses.
Warm and welcoming, she greets every guest with a tea tray filled with
home-baked treats and is happy to help you plan your days in Galway and
the surrounding area. Her home is cozy and sparkling clean, and rooms
are homey and comfortable, with patchwork quilts and crisp Irish linens.
You may not want to make any sightseeing plans for the morning because
Berna’s incredible breakfast, which is served at two tables so that you can
chat with your fellow guests, invites lingering. The options are endless,
from delicious stewed pears, plums, rhubarb, and other fruits to a com-
prehensive cheese plate to fruit smoothies. And that’s just the preamble
to the main course! The house is about a 20-minute walk from the heart of
Galway City and is within walking distance of the seafront.

Okay, you already know that this has to be a hip hotel, because the name
of the place is in lowercase letters. “But just how hip is it?” you ask. Well,
you enter the dramatic black-glass lobby to find a wall-length aquarium
filled with Connemara seahorses and a huge neon sign reading: “This must
be the place”. And indeed it is. Dreamt up by couture hat designer Philip
Treacy (Camilla Parker Bowles is just one of his famous clients), the hotel
is luxurious and theatrical, like the set of a glamorous avant-garde film.
Treacy blends ultramodern design elements, such as movie scenes

projected silently on the wall of the Grand Salon, with unexpected baroque
and natural touches (many inspired by the coast of Connemara). The effect
is dazzling. Set aside time to spend in all of the public rooms, from the
Grand Salon, with its impossibly high ceilings, glass-and-silver sphere instal-
lation, and tables filled with Swarovski crystal bits; to the Blue Room, which
has rich purple and amber velvet couches and chairs. The spa offers all
sorts of treatments and is another beauty, with a flock of origami fabric
cranes gliding over the hot tub, which is lit in green. The bedrooms are sim-
pler than the rest of the hotel, decorated in cool whites and creams, with a
space-age-style lamp that looks like it could cook breakfast for you and a
bed that feels like a cloud. Service is exceptional. Though the rack rates are
ridiculous, the hotel often has special offers available on its Web site.

Located about 3.2km (2 miles) outside Galway, this 1740s manor house is
the picture of gracious living. The hotel is surrounded by peaceful
grounds, including its own 9-hole golf course, and the interior is furnished
with luxurious fabrics, antiques, and hand-carved furniture. The spacious
guestrooms boast Georgian furnishings, marble bathrooms, and pastoral

Galway City
Location, location, location. This hotel, part of the excellent Jurys chain,
is situated in a terrific spot, right on the edge of the hopping heart of the
city, near pretty Lough Corrib (the lake that separates the city center from
the surrounding areas). Rooms are of the standard hotel variety, with pine
furnishings and warm colors. A restaurant downstairs serves full meals,
and the hotel’s pub is a jovial place to chat over a drink (and perhaps listen
to some live music). If you are a light sleeper, ask for a room away from
the main street.

there is parking for those who have a car. Owners Joan and Frank Maher
are perfect B&B hosts — friendly and helpful without being intrusive.

Galway City
Who could pass up a bed and breakfast where you are greeted at breakfast
by a plump Corgi named Tubbs? Tubbs and your kind hostess Mary will
give you a warm welcome and help you plan your Galway visit. If stylish
room décor is important to you, try Devondell or Petra House instead (it’s
comfortable and cozy, but pretty Plain Jane here); if a central location is
what you’re seeking, this is your place. St. Martin’s is located on a quiet
street that’s less than a five-minute walk from the hustle and bustle of
downtown Galway.

This place has two different personalities. At lunch artsy types fill the
bright and casual restaurant, chatting over giant pots of tea and tasty
dishes such as a pear, walnut, and mixed leaf salad with blue cheese
dressing, or a toasted sandwich with chorizo, gubeen (a Cork cheese),
and onion marmalade. At dinner things get a bit more sophisticated as
the restaurant serves up inventive New Irish dishes such as Irish beef
filet with a root vegetable and thyme gratin, stout-braised shallots, and
Port jus; or pan-fried Monkfish with fondant potatoes, cider-braised
leeks, and lemon-roasted fennel.

30-somethings. Sit down at one of the wood tables in the white-walled,

wood-ceilinged restaurant, and select your spud. There is something to
please everyone (as long as you like potatoes), from the Venice By Night,
a potato filled with tuna, corn, peppers, tomato sauce, onions, mushrooms
and mozzarella cheese, to the Nora Barnacle, a potato stuffed with strips
of chicken breast and served with a creamy garlic sauce. There are a few
non-potato appetizers and salads if you are feeling starched out. Be sure
to check out the paintings of spuds as famous movie characters (the
intrepid-looking Batman potato is my favorite) while you wait for your
order. The casual atmosphere and fun meal choices make this a great place
for families.

CONTINENTAL-NEW IRISH
Not only do I recommend this upscale, candlelit restaurant, but so does
the entire group who sat next to me: They couldn’t stop raving about the
food and proclaimed their meal the best they had eaten in Ireland. The
décor on the lower floor is modern and Scandinavian-looking, while the
upper floor is painted with vivid reds and yellows. Dishes use the freshest
of ingredients, and a few successfully borrow Indian, African, and Asian
spices, condiments, and cooking techniques, such as the sautéed tiger
prawns with Madras-scented cream, broccoli, and mushrooms, served
with sweet chile rice. Other dishes are straight-up New Irish; I recommend
the melt-in-your-mouth Connemara lamb with braised garlic potatoes and
a rosemary jus. The several vegetarian dishes are very classy, including
such treats as a spicy chickpea, cauliflower, and date tagine with wild
Tunisian-style pilaf rice. Finish up with the heavenly French-chocolate cake
served with pistachio ice cream if it’s on the menu.

CREPES
Crepes are an ideal walking food, and Galway an ideal walking city, so this
new creperie is a welcome addition to the city. The scrumptious crepes
run the gamut from savory (try the Tantalizing Tikka, with chicken, bell
peppers, spring onions, a cheese mix, and Dijon mustard) to the sweet
(just try to resist the Bananarama, with sliced banana, melted chocolate
and homemade banana ice cream). Take your crepe on the go or sit at one
of the cafe tables outside. Yum.

This Galway institution has just undergone a massive overhaul. Gone are
the carpets and other trappings of Old World Continental dining. In their
place is an airy modern restaurant with a relaxed feel. The mission of the
Malt House is to serve locally sourced, in-season dishes, and the chef and
owner have worked hard to find the best producers in the region. These
local ingredients are highlighted in dishes such as the Galway Bay mus-
sels (served with either garlic and white wine or Asian style), and the
spiced lamb tagine with couscous and mint tzatziki.

Galway City
SEAFOOD
Fish doesn’t get fresher or better than at this popular place, where rope
ladders twist across the ceiling and murals of old fish markets in Galway
decorate the walls. The McDonaghs, who’ve been at it for four generations,
have had plenty of practice in the trade. The day’s catch is personally
inspected and chosen before it comes in the door. In the restaurant, you
can decide exactly how you’d like your fish cooked, whether it’s salmon,
trout, sole, or one of many other options. Shrimp and lobsters come the
way the sea made them: in the shell. If you’re looking for something simple
and quick, stop by the top-notch fish-and-chips shop in the front of the
restaurant, grab a bench outside, and watch the world pass by as you dig
into your moist and delicious cutlet of fish. If you are curious about curry
chips (French fries with curry sauce) this is the place to try them.

Nimmo’s Wine Bar
$$$
Galway City
NEW IRISH
This atmospheric restaurant serves some of the best food in Ireland.
Though I’ve never had dinner at an eccentric sea captain’s home, I imagine
that it would be a lot like dining at Nimmo’s. Located on the fast-flowing
River Corrib, Nimmo’s is cozy and romantic, with worn wooden floors and
plaster walls, weathered glass bottles and nautical objects, faded black-
and-white photographs of ships, and brightly colored candles gracing the
tables. The menu uses fresh, local ingredients and complements them with
inventive preparations, spicing, and sauces inspired by cuisines all over
the world. The dishes change all the time, but if it’s on the menu, try the
salmon and brill with a veil of creamy Thai curry sauce, served with per-
fectly steamed vegetables. I also loved the goat cheese in phyllo with sweet
chile-and-lime dressing.

Exploring Galway City: The top attractions
Galway doesn’t have any don’t-leave-Ireland-without-seeing-it attrac-
tions; it’s more of a place to wander around, enjoy the excellent street
performers who flock to the city in the summer, shop a little, and take
advantage of the fabulous restaurant and nightlife scenes. It is also an
excellent place to base yourself for explorations of Connemara, The
Burren (see Chapter 17), and the Aran Islands.
The compact heart of Galway is a pedestrian area that begins west of
Eyre Square. The main street here starts as William Street at Eyre Square
and then changes names many times before hitting the River Corrib.
If you’d like to take a walking tour of Galway City’s sights, check out
Galway Tours (% 086-402-1819). If you are looking for a darker per-
spective on the city, try Galway Gore (% 093-43611). All tours depart
from the tourist information office on Foster Street, just off Eyre Square
(call for times and prices, as they change each season).
Here are some attractions that you may want to look out for as you
wander the city.
Browne Doorway
Looking pretty odd at the head of Eyre Square, the Browne Doorway is a
towering stone archway that’s connected to nothing. Dating from 1627, the
doorway comes from an old mansion on Lower Abbeygate Street, and it
has the coats of arms of the families Browne and Lynch, two of the origi-
nal fourteen families who founded Galway City.
Located on the northwest side of Eyre Square.
Cruising Lough Corrib
Want to get away from the buzz of the city? Celtic Boat Safaris offers a 90-
minute guided cruise along vast, scenic Lough Corrib in a traditional West
of Ireland lake boat. You’ll pass peaceful uninhabited islands, see all sorts of
birds, and get a real sense of the geography and history of the area. If you’re
feeling more adventurous, you may want to take the company’s one- or two-
day journeys. The one-day journey takes you to charming Cong village,
where you’ll pick up a mountain bike and tour the surrounding forest, home
to caves and old castles. The two-day journey adds a scenic hike and a stop
on beautiful Inchagoil Island, where you’ll find the ruins of a fifth-century
church. Corrib Ferries (see “Exploring Connemara,” later in this chapter)
offers similar cruises on standard boats, leaving from Cong and Oughterard.
Cruises depart from Woodquay, behind Court House and the Town Hall Theatre.

Collegiate Church of St. Nicholas
Columbus is rumored to have prayed in this well-preserved medieval
church, built in 1320, before setting sail for the New World. You’ll find beau-
tiful stone carvings, gargoyles, and the tomb of a Crusader here.
Lombard Street. % 091-564-648. Admission: Free. Apr–Nov 9 a.m.–7 p.m.; Dec–Mar
9 a.m. to sunset.
Eyre Square
This giant grassy square has recently been restored and is a hangout for
locals and travelers alike. There is nothing particularly special about the
square itself, though Eamon O’Doherty’s modern sculpture of an old sail-
ing ship is spectacular.
Galway City Museum
It’s a rainy day and you want to hang out somewhere dry. Spend an hour
or so in the Galway City Museum, which has several nice exhibits on the
history of the area. Be sure to check out the model of a Galway hooker
boat on the ground floor.
Spanish Arch. % 091-532-460. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–7 p.m.
Lynch’s Castle (now AIB Bank)
If this isn’t the first castle you’ve seen in Ireland, you may expect some-
thing . . . well, larger. This 14th-century home of the legendary Lynch family
was restored and now houses a bank, though you can still marvel at the
coats of arms and the Spanish-style stonework on the exterior.
Upper Abbeygate Street (between Shop and Market streets).
Lynch Memorial Window

earned his place in dictionaries when he condemned and executed his own
son (convicted of murder) in 1493 as a demonstration that the law does

Searching for Galway’s mermaids
Mermaids show up frequently in Irish folklore, often representing something alluring
but dangerous. According to legend, if you happen to see a mermaid sitting on a rock,
it means bad luck is coming your way. So don’t stare out at the rocks too long!
You can look as long as you like at the mermaid depictions around town, though.
Galway supposedly has more representations of mermaids than any other place in
Ireland. Check out the mermaids in the window of the Collegiate Church of St.
Nicholas, in the center of town.

Lynch Memorial Window commemorates this event and is set into a wall
just above an ornate Gothic doorway on Market Street.
Market Street (1 block northwest of Eyre Square).
Salthill
This fun little resort strip is Ireland’s closest thing to the United States’
Coney Island in its heyday. It makes for a fun day with the family. Walk
along the boardwalk, eat fast food, play arcade games, and visit the
Leisureland amusement park.
Take the R336 west from Galway for about 3km (2 miles).
Spanish Arch
The Spanish Arch was built in 1584 to protect ships from looting. It earns
its name from the Spanish galleons that used to dock under its protection.
Between Wolfe Tone Bridge and the Long Walk, at the mouth of the River Corrib.
Taking short side trips from Galway City
Coole Park
Gort
The house and grounds here were once home to Lady Gregory — writer,
friend of many an Irish luminary, and cofounder of Dublin’s Abbey Theatre.
The grounds are now a park, with red deer, red squirrels, and badgers,
among others animals. There are beautiful nature trails, a lake, and lush
gardens. One of the most interesting parts of the park is the Autograph
Tree, which bears the carved initials of such famous people as George
Bernard Shaw; Oliver St. John Gogarty; Sean O’Casey; and W. B. Yeats, Lady
Gregory’s friend and partner in the Abbey. In the restored courtyard you’ll
find a visitor center, which shows two interesting presentations on the his-
tory of Coole Park. An on-site restaurant serves filling main courses and
great desserts.
Take the N6 out of Galway to the N18; north of Gort, follow the signs. % 091-63-1804.
Admission: Free. Open: Park year-round; visitor center Mar 22–May and Sept daily
10 a.m.–5 p.m., June–Aug daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m. Suggested visit: 1–2 hours.

The swans of the River Corrib
The waters of Lough Corrib, the largest lake in the Republic of Ireland, run through the
River Corrib to join the sea at the edge of Galway City. Go down to the pier, near the
Spanish Arch, to see the huge flock of mute swans who make their home here.

Dunguaire Castle
Kinvarra
How better to tell the story of a castle’s rich history than to show it? Each
floor of Dunguaire (dun-gware) Castle reflects a different and very colorful
time in its history. It’s been perfectly restored, and the interior is one of the
finest in its class, with furnishings that mirror the time. According to legend,
the castle was built on the site of the Palace of Guaire, sixth-century king
of Connaught, and that’s where the name comes from. Later, it was owned
by Oliver St. John Gogarty, poet, surgeon, and satirical model for Buck
Mulligan, one the characters of James Joyce’s Ulysses. Although born in
Dublin, Gogarty lived mostly in Connemara. The view of Connemara and
Galway Bay from the top of the battlements is awe-inspiring. The castle is
also the setting for excellent medieval-style banquets (book in advance).
From Galway City, take the N6 to N18; turn right on the N67 and follow it to Kinvarra.
% 061-360-788. Admission: 5.50 ($8.80) adults; 3.15 ($5) seniors, children, and
students. Open: Mid-Apr to Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m. (last admission at 4:30 p.m.).
Suggested visit: 11⁄2 hours.
Thoor Ballylee (W. B. Yeats’s Summer Home)
Gort
This stone tower was poet W. B. Yeats’s summer home. Yeats wrote many
works here, including “The Winding Stair” and “The Tower,” both inspired
by this building. The view from the battlements takes in Galway’s lush
fields and forests. An audiovisual tour and museum are dedicated to
Yeats’s life and work, and the tower has been restored to look just like it
did when the poet lived there in the 1920s. The gardens and a picnic area
make for a gorgeous lunch stop when the weather’s nice.
Off the Limerick-Galway road (N18) in Gort. % 091-63-1436. Admission: 6 ($9.60)
adults, 5.50 ($8.80) seniors and students, 2.50 ($4) children. Open: June–Sept

Shopping in Galway City
Galway City is home to lot of shops, and you’re bound to find items to
suit your taste as you stroll around the heart of the city. Eyre Square
Shopping Centre, lined by old stone walls, has more than 50 shops and
an antiques market under one glass roof. A great item to buy in Galway
is a Claddagh ring — you know, the ones with two hands clasping a heart
below a crown. The design originated in the Galway area, and you find
numerous stores selling these rings. Thomas Dillon’s, 1 Quay St., near
the Spanish Arch (% 091-566-365), claims to be the original maker and
is worth a stop for its small homemade Claddagh museum (a little rough
around the edges but interesting all the same), even if you aren’t in the
market for a ring.
Chapter 18: County Galway 355

MacEocagain/Galway Woollen Market, 21 High St. (% 091-56-2491),
specializes in Aran handknits and other knitwear, linen, lace, sheepskins,
and jewelry. Kennys Bookshop and Galleries, a Galway institution, has
closed the bookstore portion of its offerings (though it still does a brisk
business online at www.kennys.ie), and has expanded its outstanding
gallery of art, antiquarian maps, and prints. The store is now called The
Kenny Gallery, High Street (% 091-56-4760). The Treasure Chest,
31–33 William St. (% 091-563-862), has just about every Irish gift item
you could want under one roof — Waterford Crystal, Royal Tara china,
Belleek china, Claddagh rings, Aran knitwear, linen, and more.
Enjoying Galway City nightlife
Galway has some excellent theater and live music that you can take in
before hitting one of the pubs listed in this section. Róisín Dubh,
Dominick Street (% 091-586-540; www.roisindubh.net) books spectac-
ular bands and singers, from traditional Irish musicians to singer-
songwriters to alternative country bands to jazz groups to rock groups. 
The Druid Theatre Company, Flood St. (% 091-568-660; www.druid
theatre.com), presents inventive performances of 20th-century and
new Irish and European plays.
For information on what’s going on in pubs, clubs, theaters, and more,
pick up a free copy of XPOSED Weekly Entertainment Guide (available
around town and online at www.irelandxposed.com). This is the best
place to figure out which of Galway’s several clubs are hot at the
moment.
Crane Bar
This is arguably the best place in Galway City for traditional Irish music.
Casual sessions take place every night with some of the best musicians in
town. The décor is nothing special, but it won’t matter once you get car-
ried along on the current of jigs and reels.
2 Sea Rd., Salthill (less than a mile out of Galway City). % 091-587-419.
The Kings Head
The Middle Ages live on in The Kings Head, with original medieval fire-
places and windows. It’s all or nothing here, and every bit of the place
looks the part of a pub from the 1500s. There’s history galore associated
with this place, and a chat with the barkeep will reveal some of its stories.
This isn’t a cramped, elbow-room pub, either: It’s spread over three floors,
and has a rock or pop band, or a DJ, every night. Take your picture sitting
on the throne next to the downstairs fireplace and enjoy some of the great
pub grub or pizza.

Monroe’s Tavern
Feeling footloose? Monroe’s regularly packs the place every Tuesday night
(after 9:30 p.m.) for set dancing — a partnered form of Irish dance that
resembles American square dancing. And every night features live tradi-
tional Irish music — whirling reels keeping a fast, sweaty pace as onlook-
ers shout out in a frenzy of good craic (fun). And the crowd isn’t all
tour-bus shutterbugs; the tavern is most popular with locals. Set in an old
house with low ceilings and timber floors, it may seem large for a pub, but
it needs the room so that you can get your jig on. During the day, you
should stop in for a bite: Monroe’s actually has excellent pub food.
Dominick Street. % 091-58-3397.
The Quays
No trip to Galway is complete without a stop at this lively pub, a city insti-
tution since the 1600s. The stone interior was once the inside of a medieval
French church and boasts beautiful details such as stained glass and
carved wood. Good music, sometimes of the traditional Irish ilk, is on tap
every night. The pub grub is quite tasty.
Quay Street and Chapel Lane. % 091-56-8347.
Skeff Bar
This pub is a good place for conversation. It incorporates all different
kinds of décor: Some parts look like an upper-class drawing room, with
elegant couches, coffee tables, and Persian rugs; other parts are distinctly
Irish pub, with low stools or tall booths. Fireplaces, intricate ceiling work,
and stained glass give the place a posh feel. Staircases throughout lead to
more bars upstairs. The American food (burgers, chicken fingers, and so
on) is good, and there’s often a DJ on weekends.

The Claddagh ring
Claddagh rings feature two hands holding a heart, which is topped by a crown. 
The hands symbolize friendship, the crown symbolizes loyalty, and the heart repre-
sents love.
According to tradition, the wearer wears the ring on the ring finger of the left hand
with the crown pointing toward the fingertips to show he or she is in love or married.
If, on the other hand, the heart is pointing toward the fingertips the wearer is said to
be unattached. Traditionally, the ring serves as an engagement or wedding ring.
The name comes from Claddagh, the oldest fishing village in Ireland, located on the
west bank of the Corrib Estuary right across from Galway City. In Gaelic, An Cladach
means “flat, stony shore.”

Tíg Neachtain
This is the real deal. This cozy pub, in a building that dates from the Middle
Ages, is filled with old snugs that have seen infinite pints of Guinness and
been party to countless late-night conversations. There is music here most
nights, ranging from traditional Irish to Cajun to jazz and blues.
17 Cross St. % 091-568-820.
The Aran Islands
The Aran Islands — Inishmore, Inishmaan, and Inisheer — are havens of
traditional Irish culture: Islanders speak Irish Gaelic as a first language,
and many still don traditional Aran sweaters with their jeans. The islands
have a moody kind of beauty — they are flat and rocky, with small human-
made farms divided by stone walls, and cliffs plunging into the sea below.
Visitors arrive at Inishmore, the largest and most developed of islands, by
the boatload during the summer. Dún Aengus, a prehistoric stone fort, is
the main attraction on the island. Visitors can get around by bicycle or by
using the minibuses and horse-and-pony carts that meet you at the ferry
pier. Those craving a bit more solitude should visit Inishmaan, the second-
largest island, which also has several prehistoric ruins; or Inisheer, the
smallest of the islands, which is filled with farms and, from June to August,
meadows of wildflowers; it also has several sandy beaches.
If you are going to come to the Aran Islands, I highly recommend spending
the night. The true personality of the islands (and the islanders) seems to
emerge only after the day-trippers have gone back to the mainland.
For more information on the islands, check out www.visitaran
islands.com.
Getting to and around the Aran Islands
The most common way to get to the Arans is by ferry. Aran Island
Ferries (% 091-56-8903; www.aranislandferries.com), located at the
Galway Tourist Office off Eyre Square, operates ferries that depart from
Rossaveal Pier in Connemara (the bus trip from Galway to Rossaveal is
included in the price). Prices are 25 ($40) for adults, 20 ($32) for sen-
iors and students, and 13 ($21) for children. The ferries call at each of
the islands, with the most popular (and busiest) port being Kilronan, on
Inishmore. Aran Islands Ferries travels between Inisheer and Inishmaan;
if you want to travel between other combinations of islands, you need to
travel back to Rossaveal first. If you’d rather fly, Aer Arann Islands
(% 091-59-3034; www.aerarannislands.ie) takes off from Connemara
airport, about 29km (18 miles) west of Galway City (a bus from the city
is available to the airport; just ask when you book), and flies to all three
islands; its most popular flights land in Kilronan, on Inishmore. The ten-
minute flight is the shortest scheduled flight in the world. Prices are cur-
rently around 45 ($72) round-trip for adults, 37 ($59) for students,
and 25 ($40) round-trip for children.

You can’t bring your car to the Arans, and there are no car rentals, so
when you reach the islands, you have a couple of choices: You can rent
a bike at Aran Bike Hire at Frenchman’s Beach in Kilronan (% 099-61-
132), which is what I recommend, or you can hire a driver and minibus
or a bumpy horse and cart (there will be a bunch waiting when you
arrive at the islands).
You can also tour the Arans by foot. Walking-tour maps are available at
the tourist office in Kilronan (% 099-61-263). Each route takes a
couple of hours.
Spending the night on the Aran Islands
Each island has several B&Bs; for information, contact the Galway
Tourist Office at % 091-53-77-00. In addition to Pier House (listed
below), other favorites are Man of Aran, on Inishmore (% 099-61-

Pier House

Lower Kilronan, Inishmore
On a small island, you’re pretty much guaranteed a view of the water from
anywhere, but from a room in the Pier House, you get that and more. It’s
only feet from the harbor; sandy beaches, pubs, and restaurants are all a
short walk away; and the ocean breeze makes its way into your room’s
open window at night. Rooms are quite nice, and it’s obvious that great
care goes into ensuring a guest’s comfort. Plus it’s a great value for the
price.

Exploring the Aran Islands
The Arans are attractions in and of themselves. Rent a bike (my top rec-
ommendation), flag a pony cart or minivan, or lace up your sneakers,
and then poke around these beautiful islands. The heritage center, Ionad
Arann, Kilronan, Inishmore (% 099-61-355), is a good place to begin
your visit to the islands. The center offers exhibits and a film investigat-
ing the culture, history, and geography of the islands. Admission is 4
($6.40) for adults, 2.50 ($4) for students, and 2 ($3.20) for seniors and
children. It’s open daily April, May, September, and October from 11 a.m.
to 5 p.m., and June through August 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Dún Aengus
Kilmurvey, Inishmore
This well-preserved immense prehistoric stone fort stretches over 4.4
hectares (11 acres) and is set on a sheer cliff overlooking the Atlantic
Ocean. The fort is composed of three dry-stone walls, set one inside the
other. The former use of the fort is still unknown. Views of Connemara,
Galway Bay, and the Burren are superb from the innermost wall. Be sure
to enter the area through the visitor center.

The origins of the Aran sweater
Aran sweaters may be one of Ireland’s biggest exports today, but they came from
humble beginnings. Originally, the almost-waterproof wool sweaters were knit by the
women of the Aran Islands to ensure that the islands’ fishermen stayed warm and dry
(the waterproofing comes from natural oils from the sheep’s skin, which remain on the
wool). The various stitches on the sweater signify different ideas and objects, from a
“honeycomb” stitch that symbolizes abundance to a “tree of life” stitch that repre-
sents the stages of life.

Shopping
If you’ve held out long enough, now’s your chance to buy an authentic,
often-copied-but-never-reproduced, hand-knit fisherman’s sweater on
the Aran Islands. Numerous shops sell these sweaters.
Connemara
The area west of Galway City, known as Connemara, offers some of the
most stunning and varied scenery in Ireland. It’s a wild and untamed
place of still glacial lakes, stands of evergreens, 12 towering mountains
(called the Twelve Bens or Twelve Pins), endless quiet boglands,
beaches, and granite moorlands. In addition, it is home to Killary Harbor,
a dazzling fjord that reflects mirror-images of the surrounding mountains.
A large part of Connemara is a Gaeltacht — an area where you may hear
Irish Gaelic being spoken. You also may encounter the rugged little
Connemara ponies, the only purebred horses native to Ireland. There are
only a few towns of any size in this region. The roughly 1,100-person town
of Clifden is the unofficial capital of Connemara. Nestled in a valley at the
foot of the Twelve Bens mountain range, the town’s lively center and
excellent location make it a popular base for visitors, who throng the
town streets in the summer. A slightly quieter option is Roundstone, a
bustling and charming little fishing village.
Getting to and around Connemara
The best way to see Connemara is by driving or biking. Take either N59,
the inland route (you’ll see signs for the road on Galway City’s ring
road), or R340 and R341, the coastal routes.
Bus Éireann (% 011-836-6111; www.buseireann.ie) serves Clifden
and other towns in Connemara.

location for touring the spectacular landscape of Connemara. Rooms are
of the typical large hotel variety — clean, spacious, and bright but lacking
in any real character. The bar, which often hosts traditional Irish music
and dance, is a lively and cozy place to relax after a day of sightseeing, and

Ocean, both of which are close at hand. Nature-lovers take note: The B&B
has a vast amount of land (as proprietors Jack and Shirley King like to say,
“We have a national park in our backyard”). You can wander through the
wildflower garden, encountering the Kings’ sweet Connemara ponies and
donkey; stroll and shell-hunt on the nearby smooth, sandy beaches (Dogs
Bay is especially beautiful); and climb Errisbeg Mountain for panoramic
views of the area. Rooms are simple and airy, with pine furnishings, king-
sized beds, and colorful comforters. The Kings are incredibly friendly and
enthusiastic about sharing this beautiful location with their guests. Kids
will love running around the grounds and playing with the ponies.

site Gurteen Beach. % 095-35-807. www.errisbeglodge.com. Rates: 85–110

Faul House
$$
Ballyconneely
About half of the Faul House’s guests are return visitors, which makes com-
plete sense given the warmth and friendliness of owners Kathleen and
Michael Conneely. Kathleen and Michael are a compendium of Connemara
knowledge (Michael grew up on this land), and are genuinely happy to help
visitors develop an itinerary that suits their individual needs and inter-
ests. The house is located on a peaceful country lane and has miles of land,
where you’ll find the Conneely’s donkeys and sweet Connemara ponies.
You’ll definitely want to make time to explore the property, visit the ani-
mals, and walk down to the sea. The house has a gentle, welcoming feel
about it, with a turf fire burning in the living room and bedrooms that are

simple and airy, decorated with hand-painted watercolors and sporting
king-sized beds. Breakfast is fantastic, particularly the scrambled eggs
blanketed with fresh smoked salmon.

SeaMist Guesthouse
$$
Clifden
This place has a serene and homey feel that you may not expect in the
middle of the bustling town of Clifden. The bedrooms are furnished in a
modern country style, with a chic combination of burgundies, creams, and
golds, and you’ll find original art and interesting furnishings throughout
the house. Plan extra time in the morning to linger over the excellent
breakfasts (including such treats as pancakes and scrambled eggs with
feta cheese) in the glass-walled conservatory.

The Quay House
$$$$
Clifden
The décor here is certainly not your run-of-the-mill prints of Ireland and
Victorian-reproduction tables. Owners Paddy and Julia Foyle have fur-
nished this grand restored harbormaster’s house with bold, artistic
choices, including zebra, tiger, and other animal skins; dramatic paintings
in gilded frames; and glass chandeliers. One wall of the airy conservatory
breakfast room is decorated with the lids of silver serving platters.
Bedrooms are spacious and individually furnished, running from ornate
Victorian-style quarters to rooms that look like they belong in a chic hunt-
ing lodge in Africa. Birders many want to ask for the Bird Room, featuring
several stuffed parrots. Seven suites have balconies and small kitchens.
Paddy and Julia have a deep knowledge of the area and are always happy
to advise visitors on outdoor activities, dining, drives, and so on. The
house is located a ten-minute walk from the town of Clifden.

SEAFOOD-IRISH
Warm and cozy is the name of the game here. Candles in cast-iron 
holders cast a golden glow on the dark, shiny wood tables and benches,

and weathered signs decorate the walls. The restaurant buzzes with con-
versation and laughter from a convivial crowd that runs from couples to
large families. Dishes are made with the freshest ingredients, simply pre-
pared and boasting some inspired sauces and spices. My tagliatelle with
olive oil, cherry tomatoes, and herbs was delicious, and the couple next to
me was enjoying their braised Connemara lamb shank au jus. Enjoy veg-
etables, such as buttery creamed carrots and perfectly steamed broccoli,
with your meal.

SEAFOOD/IRISH
Seafood is the staple of this stylish restaurant. Expect dishes such as
baked filet of salmon with parsley mashed potatoes and creamed leeks,
and pan-fried brill with sun-dried tomato champ (mashed potatoes) and
chive sauce. Steaks and stews (including a luscious Connemara lamb stew)
are also on offer, and noteworthy lighter meals, including pastas, quiche,
and salads, are served during the day. The interior juxtaposes contempo-
rary sleekness with ornate and rustic touches — contemporary paintings
hang right next to an elaborately carved altar.

Moran’s Oyster Cottage

Kilcolgan
SEAFOOD
This is possibly the best place in Ireland for oysters. Moran’s has been run
by the same family for six generations and is dedicated to serving the very
best oysters along with a well-pulled pint. If you are not a friend of the
bivalve, there are other options on the menu, from chile-spiced prawns to
baked salmon. All of these treats are served overlooking the weir, which is
frequented by swans.

Clifden
This cute, casual, bright cafe serves up teas and coffees, plus enticing

premises without sampling something from the selection of homemade
cakes, cookies, and scones (and if not, it should be). The cafe has com-
prehensive Internet service upstairs.

Exploring Connemara
If you are carless, you can choose among several guided bus tours of
Connemara. I suggest hitting Galway City’s tourist office (see “Fast Facts:
County Galway,” at the end of this chapter), either in person or virtually,
to figure out which one suits you. Bus Éireann’s (% 01-836-6111;
www.buseireann.ie) Connemara Bus Tour includes a stop at Kylemore
Abbey, but the tour focuses on the beautiful mountain and coastal
scenery and the stunning views of Killary Fjord. The bus leaves Galway
Bus Station, in Eyre Square, at 10 a.m. daily, May 4 through September
27, and returns at 5:50 p.m. It costs 23 ($36) adults, 16 ($26) students
and seniors, and 12 ($19) for children.
Corrib Ferries (% 092-46-029; www.corribcruises.com) offers round-
trip cruises on lovely Lough Corrib, Ireland’s largest lake. You cruise
from Oughterard, in County Galway, to Cong Village, in County Mayo,
where you can gaze upon the exterior of the beautiful 13th-century
Ashford Castle. Along the way, you stop on Inchagoill Island for a guided
tour of the fifth-century ruins there. The cruise options range from a
one-hour cruise to a five-and-a-half-hour cruise. If you have the time, go
for the longer cruise, which gives you ample time to explore quaint Cong
village. Also see Celtic Boat Safaris (see “Cruising Lough Corrib” in the
Galway City section, earlier in this chapter), which does similar trips out
of Galway City.
Connemara Walking Center, the Island House, Market Street, Clifden
(% 095-21-379), offers a number of well-done guided walks of
Connemara. Call for a schedule and prices (closed in winter). Hikers
should also consider a visit to Connemara National Park (see below).
Bicycling is a great way to explore this area; you can rent bikes from
John Mannion, Bridge Street, Clifden (% 095-211-60). The following
routes also make good driving tours.
Tour 1: The N59 out of Clifden connects up with R344, which in turn con-
nects again with N59 as you reenter Clifden, making a loop that takes
you past shimmering lakes and bays and along the Twelve Bens —
twelve mountains that stand like proud sentries in the wild landscape.
You’ll also travel through the moody boglands around Connemara
National Park, and catch a glimpse of Kylemore Abbey (reviewed below)
perched above a lake. You many want to stop to visit the Abbey and
Gardens. If you are driving, allow about two to three hours for the tour.
Tour 2: Use the N59 south out of Clifden to get to the R341, which will
trace the coastline and hook up with the R344 to take you back to the
N59 into Clifden. If you are going counterclockwise from Clifden, you will
pass the site where the first transatlantic flight landed in a bog (the
pilots didn’t realize that the soft green grass covered soggy land). Stop
at Dogs Bay (see earlier in this chapter) and Gorteen Bay, two pristine
beaches (both signposted off R341, at the most southerly point). You
may want to get lunch or a snack in the cute fishing village of
Chapter 18: County Galway 365

Roundstone before joining up with R344, which will take you through
some subtly beautiful bogland.
Tour 3: The Sky Road, signposted out of Clifden, is aptly named. I felt
like I was flying as the road climbed higher and higher over farmland and
sea cliffs.
Finally, there are several pony trekking outfitters in Connemara, and
Errislannan Manor (% 095-21-134) is one of the finest, offering guided
rides across Connemara’s moors and coastland. To get there, take the
Ballyconneely Road out of Clifden. The Errislannan Manor is signposted
on the road about 3.2km (2 miles) outside of Clifden. Rates are 35 ($56)
per hour; call to arrange times (closed Sun).
Connemara National Park and Visitor Centre
Letterfrack
Some of most beautiful scenery in Connemara is contained in this 2,000-
hectare (5,000-acre) park. Vast bogland cloaks this area, and four of the
mountains in the impressive Twelve Bens range are within its boundaries,
including Benbaun, the highest of the 12, which reaches 720m (2,400 ft.).
There are 4,000-year-old prehistoric structures, flowers that grow only
here (look for the carnivorous sundew), and a contained herd of sturdy
Connemara ponies. The clearly marked trails take you up through the bog-
lands, revealing beautiful panoramas of the sea and the undulating hills.
This is the kind of beauty that many find to be subtle rather than striking —
the bogland reveals its splendor to those who walk slowly and look care-
fully. There are three loop walks within the park (easy, moderate, and
hard), making it a good stop for a group of varying abilities — you can all
meet up for tea in the Visitor Centre when you’re done. Those who take
the challenging Diamond loop will be rewarded with splendid views of the
land and sea. The Visitor Centre (on the N59) has fascinating exhibits on
the history of the area and on all things bog-related, and an audiovisual
show on the park, and organizes nature trail walks (call in advance to see
when they’re being offered). I recommend wearing sturdy shoes and socks
that you don’t mind getting dirty (bogland is quite soggy).
Off the Clifden-Westport road (N59). % 095-41-054 or 095-41-006. Free Admission.
Open: Park year-round; Visitor Centre June–Aug 9:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m.; Mar–May and
Sept–Oct 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m. Suggested visit: Several hours.
Dogs Bay
Roundstone
You will certainly see dogs taking their owners for walks on this perfect
crescent of a beach. You will also find lovely shells and some of the finest
and softest white sand in Ireland here.
Off R341, west of Roundstone village. Suggested visit: 45 minutes.

Kylemore Benedictine Abbey & Gardens
Kylemore
Sitting in a stunning setting at the base of the mountains and on the shores
of a lake, this abbey looks like a storybook castle — and it is, in a way. An
English tycoon had the gorgeous neo-Gothic building constructed for his
adored wife and sold it to the duke and duchess of Manchester upon her
death. Several owners later, a group of nuns escaping the horrors of World
War I in Belgium took up residence and converted it into an abbey. Today,
the nuns also run a girls’ boarding school here (though the school is being
phased out; the current students will be the last to graduate from the
school here, in 2010). You can visit the striking main hall and reception
rooms, and walk along the lake to the restored neo-Gothic chapel. The star
of the abbey is the magnificent walled Victorian garden, which slopes up
on either side like an open book and contains an astounding assortment
of vegetables, fruits, and flowers. Have a look inside the greenhouse, a
restored version of one in a series of connecting greenhouses that origi-
nally stood in the garden (in Victorian times, the lady of the house and her
friends were treated to the unique pleasure of eating a fresh banana in the
dead of winter — quite an unusual delicacy at that time). The Abbey is
also known for its pottery; you can watch it being created and can pur-
chase some in the craft shop.

Shopping in Connemara
Owner Malachy Kearns and his staff at Roundstone Music Craft &
Fashion in Roundstone (off Route 59; % 095-35-808; www.bodhran.
com) make and sell a large and high-quality selection of bodhráns (Irish
drums). Malachy Kearns is something of a celebrity: He made the drums
for the Riverdance ensemble and is even featured on an Irish postage
stamp. The Spiddal Craft and Design Studios, Spiddal (% 091-553-376),
houses craftspeople who make and sell a variety of crafts, from musical
instruments to candles. Millar’s, on Main Street, Clifden (% 095-21-038),
sells beautiful trendy handmade clothing, tweeds, and interesting jew-
elry and knickknacks. Avoca, in Letterfrack (% 095-41-058), sells all
sorts of beautiful Irish crafts, furnishings, and clothing.

ike Donegal, sparsely populated Mayo is one of the unsung beauties
of Ireland, boasting stunning mountains and coastlines, a glassy
fjord, and pretty green fields. A drive, walk, or bike through parts of the
county could be one of the highlights of your trip. Westport, a charming
little town that’s popular with Irish and international travelers alike, is a
great place to base yourself.
In general, Sligo has a gentler look than Mayo, with rolling farmland
punctuated by pretty beaches, meadows, and mountains. This is the
county that W.B. Yeats so loved, and many of his poems are based on
places in the area. You will find no shortage of Yeats-related sights here.
Sligo Town is in the throes of a renaissance right now, with new restau-
rants and shops popping up by the month.
Both counties are known for their remarkable megalithic and Neolithic
sights, including Carrowmore, in Sligo, and Ceide Fields in Mayo.
Getting to and around Counties 
Mayo and Sligo
If you’re driving from Dublin, take the N4 to Sligo Town or the N5 to
Castlebar and Westport in County Mayo. From Galway, take the N17 to
meet the N5 in County Mayo or straight to Sligo. From Donegal, go south
on the N15 to Sligo. Irish Rail (% 1-850-366-222; www.irishrail.ie)
serves Sligo Town (at Lord Edward Street), Collooney, Ballymote, and
Boyle in County Sligo. In County Mayo, the rail service serves Westport,
Foxford, Ballina, and Castlebar. Bus Éireann (% 01-836-6111; www.
buseireann.ie) travels year-round to Sligo, Strandhill, Drumcliffe, and
other major towns in County Sligo, and to Westport, Cong, Ballina, and
other towns in County Mayo. Bus Éireann also has local service between
Sligo and Rosses Point in July and August.

Ashford Castle
$$$$
Cong, County Mayo
Okay, time for a quiz: What do Fred Astaire, Joan Baez, and Jerry Springer
have in common? If you answered that they’ve all stayed at luxurious
Ashford Castle, you are correct. Perched on the banks of sapphire Lough
Corrib and surrounded by 140 hectares (350 acres) of woodlands and gar-
dens, this place feels like a resort, with golf, fishing, tennis, horseback
riding, spa treatments, and many other offerings (including an on-site
school of falconry). The castle is a mélange of architectural styles: The
original building dates from 1228, with a French chateau–style addition
added in the 18th century and two Victorian wings added in the 19th cen-
tury. The interior is sumptuously decked out with carved oak paneling,
crystal chandeliers, gorgeous oil paintings hanging in gilt frames, and lush
fabrics. The spacious, bright bedrooms are less extravagant than the
public rooms but are still beautifully furnished, with designer fabrics and
lovely furniture. Two restaurants serve gourmet menus in opulent period
surroundings.
Take the R346 to Cross, and turn left at the church, going towards Cong. Ashford
Castle is on the left side of the road before you reach the village of Cong. % 094-

Could this place be more pleasant? My favorite B&B in Westport, the
Boulevard is located right near the center of town. Each of the homey,
bright, uncluttered rooms is artistically decorated in different shades of
one color (I really like the green room) and graced with a framed picture
that complement the hues. White country-style furniture rounds out the
look. You are invited to spend time in the simple and pretty common areas,
including a delightful little courtyard where you may have a chance to chat
with Sadie Moran, your kind and friendly host.

Clonalis House
$$$$
Castlrea, County Roscommon
Just over the County Mayo border is the Victorian Italianate mansion and
ancestral home of the O’Conors of Connacht, descendants of Ireland’s high
kings. If you’re an O’Conor (or O’Connor) yourself, you’ll find the library
and historical heirlooms of particular interest (don’t miss famous Irish
bard Turlough Carolan’s harp). O’Conor or not, you will likely enjoy the
four-poster beds, beautiful estate grounds, and nearby woods. The care-
taker, Pyers O’Conor-Nash, will gladly chat over whiskey by the fireplace
about his family’s history or the area attractions. The expansive grounds
are heaven for kids who like to run and explore, and the house dinner is
excellent.

Temple House
$$$$
Ballymote, County Sligo
I am trying to figure out if there is any possible way that I could be related
to the Percevals, who have lived on these breathtaking 400 hectares (1,000
acres) of land since 1665. If I was, say, a second-cousin twice-removed, per-
haps I could return regularly to their expansive 1825 manor and again
experience the kind of warmth that makes one feel like a member of the
family. The splendor of the grounds and the house alone would make this
one of the finest places to stay in Ireland, but it is the feeling that you are
an honored guest of your hosts, Roderick and Helena Perceval, and their
family (including the past generations, who look out from portraits and
photographs throughout the house) that draws me so strongly to the
place. A perfect day at Temple House: Wake up in your canopy bed in your
vast room (most are bigger than my entire Brooklyn apartment was), sur-
rounded by rich brocade draperies, gilt mirrors, gleaming mahogany fur-
nishings, and family heirlooms. Head down to breakfast in the grand dining
room, and then take a stroll with Fudge, Tara, and Treacle (the house dogs)
around the gorgeous property, checking out the ruins of a 12th-century
Knights Templar castle, rowing a boat on the lake (and perhaps trying your
luck with the giant pike), and wandering miles of forest trails. Finish your
day with a delicious three-course dinner (available on request), served at
the immense table in the dining room (45/$72); gatherings have the feel
of a dinner party.

The top attractions
Achill Island
County Mayo
At 22km (13 miles) long and 19km (12 miles) wide, Achill is Ireland’s largest
offshore island. The island has stunning coastal and cliff scenery, which is
best seen by taking the twisty Atlantic Drive (signposted off the bridge
that connects the mainland to the island). Golfing, fishing, and scuba
diving are popular activities on and around the island. Hikers and walkers
will be in paradise here, tromping along the sandy beaches or hill trails.
For more information about Achill Island, contact Achill Tourism at 
% 098-47-353 or www.achilltourism.com. If you’d like to spend the
night on the island, The Bervie (% 098-43-114; www.bervieachill.com),
a guesthouse on the sea, gets rave reviews.
Carrowmore Megalithic Cemetery
Carrowmore, County Sligo
You may imagine that you hear the whispers and see the ritual fires of gen-
erations past as you tour this ancient group of passage tombs (burial
mounds with entrance passageways) and dolmen (tombs composed of one
rock lying flat across other standing rocks), which are spread out over a
great grassy field ringed by mountains. This is the largest collection of
megalithic tombs in Ireland, and some of the oldest tombs in the country
are found here, including one that’s estimated to be more than 7,000 years
old. The Carrowmore area is only a small portion of a vast local group of
such tombs; look at the bumps at the tops of the surrounding mountains
to locate other tombs. Definitely take the free guided tour; the exception-
ally knowledgeable guides bring the site to life, painting a picture of the
activities that may have taken place here thousands of years ago, and dis-
cussing various theories surrounding the creation and use of these tombs.
A restored cottage houses exhibits and information related to the site.
Located off the R292, going west out of Sligo Town. % 071-916-1534. Admission:
2.10 ($3.40) adults, 1.30 ($2.10) seniors, 1.10 ($1.80) children and students. Open:

Ceide Fields
Ballycastle, County Mayo
This is the world’s most extensive Stone Age monument, with a dwelling
area, grazing grounds, planting fields, and megalithic tombs from 5,000
years ago. Tools and pottery have been uncovered and are on display in
the interpretive center, where films and exhibits do a nice job of explain-
ing the history of the area and the lives of the people who lived here.
Although a bog now covers most of the fields (and you can admire the
bog’s wild plants and flowers), portions have been cut out to show where
the fields were partitioned by stone walls for growing food and grazing ani-
mals. The fields back up to some of the most captivating cliffs and rock
formations in the country.

Croagh Patrick
Murrisk, County Mayo
According to legend, St. Patrick achieved divine inspiration on this pyra-
mid-shaped mountain after praying and fasting for 40 days — although I
don’t suggest staying up there that long, no matter how beautiful the view.
On the last Sunday of July, more than 25,000 devout Catholics climb the
762m (2,500-ft.) mountain (some barefoot) in honor of their patron saint.
There are stunning views of Mayo and Clew Bay from the mountaintop.
The climb takes two to three hours and is tough work but not impossible.

The mystery of Queen Maeve
Legend has it that the great Celtic warrior Queen Maeve (first century A.D.) ordered
her followers to bring her body to Sligo and bury her standing up and facing down her
enemies to the north. She is said to stand within a tomb atop Knocknarea Mountain,
one of the impressive ring of mountains that surround Carrowmore (see the descrip-
tion of Carrowmore above). The unmistakable loaf-shaped outline of the passage tomb
can be seen from almost every location in Sligo. Some say Queen Maeve was a mythic
goddess, some say she was a very real and ruthless Celtic queen. Archaeologists
speculate that the Knocknarea tomb contains much older megalithic remains. But still,
the tomb remains undisturbed in respect for the legend of Maeve, and thus far, there
are no plans to excavate it. In Sligo there is a custom of adding a stone to the tomb,
ostensibly to “keep away the fairies,” though many say the custom may have origi-
nated as a way to make sure that Maeve stays put in her resting place. You can hike
up to the tomb in about 45 minutes; park at the base of the mountain, accessible off
R292, southwest of Sligo Town. You’ll need good shoes, as there is a bit of a scramble
towards the top.

you’ll be rewarded with spectacular panoramic views and still avoid the
most difficult part of the climb.) A visitor center on the Pilgrim’s trail in
Murrisk sells crafts and mementos and offers information on the moun-
tain, a restaurant, and hot showers.
Between Louisburgh and Westport, off the R395. Admission: Free. Open: Daylight
hours. Suggested visit: A few hours.
Drive around Lough Gill
Drumcliffe, County Sligo
Serene, azure Lough Gill makes many appearances in Yeats’s poems. You
may be inspired to jot down a few lines of poetry yourself as you make the
42km (26-mile) drive around this gorgeous lake, stopping to ramble along
the nature trails and gaze at the island of Innisfree, made famous in Yeats’s
poem “The Lake Isle of Innisfree.” On the north side of the lake drive, you
may want to stop to take a guided tour of the beautiful 17th-century
Parke’s Castle. The lakeside Hazelwood Sculpture Trail is a splendid walk,
passing by a number of large wood sculptures. Take along some food for
the ducks and swans.
Go south from Sligo Town 1.6km (1 mile). Take Stephen Street in Sligo Town, which
turns into N16; turn right onto R286, and follow the signs. Suggested visit: 11⁄2 hours
or more, depending on how often you stop.
Eagles Flying: Irish Raptor Research Centre
Ballymote, County Sligo
If having a flying falcon’s wing graze your hair isn’t an amazing experience,
I don’t know what is. The highlights of this beautiful sanctuary for birds of
prey are the daily hour-long free-flying demonstrations (at 11 a.m. and 3
p.m.), when falconers fly eagles, hawks, owls, and falcons over your head
as they explain the behaviors and characteristics of each bird. You’ll get a
chance to pet an owl during the demonstration, and you can wander the
grounds before or after the show, getting another look at the birds or pet-
ting and feeding some of the other animals, including ferrets, donkeys,
chicks, a pig, and a friendly hedgehog.

Lissadell House
Drumcliffe, County Sligo
W. B. Yeats called Lissadell House “that old Georgian mansion,” which is
quite the understatement. This grand square stone house was owned by
the Gore-Booth family, friends of Yeats. One of the Gore-Booth daughters
was Countess Markievicz (she married a Polish count), who took part in
Chapter 19: Counties Mayo and Sligo 379

the Easter Rising of 1916; she was the first woman elected to the British
House of Commons and the first woman cabinet member in the Irish Dáil.
Her sister, Eva, was a poet. Highlights of the house include a grand marble
staircase; paintings and engravings by Countess Markievicz, John Butler
Yeats (father to William and Jack), and Percy French; and a collection of
Regency books. The restored upper walled garden (a kitchen garden) is a
treat. Parts of the property will be undergoing restoration over the next
few years, though this shouldn’t affect visitors.

Sligo Abbey
Sligo Town, County Sligo
This is the city’s only surviving medieval building, constructed in the mid-
13th century for Dominican monks. Inside are carvings and tomb sculp-
tures. The highlight is the superbly carved high altar from the 15th
century, the only one of its kind in a monastic church in Ireland. The abbey
burned down in 1414 and was damaged again in the 1641 Rebellion.
According to local legend, worshippers saved the abbey’s silver bell from
thieves by putting it in Lough Gill; it was retrieved later and is back in the
abbey. Some say that those free from sin can hear its toll. The abbey is
always cool inside, even in warm weather, so you may want to grab a
jacket.

Westport House & Country Park
Westport, County Mayo
Fans of Georgian architecture will appreciate this limestone house, which
sits at the head of Clew Bay. For many years, the house belonged to the
Browne family, descendents of 16th-century pirate queen Grace O’Malley.
It’s a grand residence, featuring beautiful original furnishings and archi-
tectural details from the late 18th and 19th centuries. You’ll find high ceil-
ings, an extraordinary white marble staircase, portraits of the Brownes,
and a dining room full of antiques, including Irish silver and Waterford
crystal. The extensive grounds are (somewhat incongruously) a kid’s para-
dise, offering log flume rides, swan pedal boats, two giant slides, an animal
and bird park, and more.

Two splendid drives
In County Sligo, hook up with the N17, south of Sligo Town, and take it in the direction
of Ballinacarrow. After you’ve gone through Ballinacarrow, look out for the sign for
Temple House. At the sign, make a right in the direction of Killoran, taking the road
through the unspoiled Ox Mountains (keep following signs pointing towards Ladies’
Brae). The road will open onto a panoramic view of patchwork fields rippling down to
Sligo Bay, with the distinctive Ben Bulben Mountain rising at the far end of the bay.
Take a left when you reach N59, and then a right onto the Coast Road, following signs
for Aughris Head. Your destination is Maggie Maye’s Beach Bar, at Aughris Strand,
where you can have a pint on an unspoiled rocky beach with gorgeous views of Ben
Bulben and Knocknarea (see “The mystery of Queen Maeve” box, above). To get back
to the main roads, leave the Coast Road for N59, which is much simpler to follow.
The following scenic route takes you from County Mayo to Connemara. Take the R335
out of Westport. You’ll drive past Clew Bay, studded with tiny grass-green islands, and
the bottom of the pyramid-shaped Croagh Patrick (described above). Continue through
the steep and windswept bogland of Doolough Pass, and along glassy Killary Fjord,
which reflects the surrounding mountains. You may want to stop at powerful Aasleagh
Falls. From here, you can either continue on into Connemara on N59 or retrace the
route back to Westport.

 The Quiet Man Heritage Cottage: In the movie The Quiet Man,
American John Wayne comes back to his birthplace in Ireland and
falls in love with Maureen O’Hara. In the movie, Wayne’s character
tells a local that he was born in a thatched-roof cottage, just like
the seven generations of his family before him, and the local makes
a wisecrack about Wayne’s buying the place to turn it into a tourist
attraction. Ironically, you can now visit a replica of the original
house — and yes, they do charge a small fee to the tourists.
Unfortunately, no movie memorabilia remains, so all there is to see
is the house. If you are a die-hard Quiet Man fan, you can take a
tour of locations in which the movie was filmed every day at noon
from June to August.
Location: Circular Road, Cong, County Mayo. % 094-954-6089.
Admission: 5 ($8) adult, 3 ($4.80) children, 4.50 ($7.20). Open:
Daily 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. April to October. Suggested visit:
Thirty minutes.
 Sligo County Museum: Arise and go now, W.B. Yeats fans and
Countess Constance Markievicz fans, to see this collection of pho-
tographs, letters, prints, portraits, drawings, and broadsheets that
relate to Yeats and Markievicz.
Location: Stephen Street, County Sligo. % 071-914-1623.
www.sligolibrary.ie. Admission: Free. Open: June through
September Tuesday through Saturday 10 a.m. to noon; year-round
Tuesday through Saturday 2 to 4:50 p.m.
 W. B. Yeats’s Grave: Yeats died in France, but, in 1948, his remains
were brought to rest in Sligo — the place he always considered
home. His grave in the Drumcliffe churchyard is near a beautiful
Celtic high cross. On the grave is an epitaph Yeats wrote: “Cast a
cold eye on life, on death. Horseman pass by.” Look out for an
installation in front of the church incorporating Yeats’s poem He
Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven.
Location: 8km (5 miles) north of Sligo on the main Donegal road
(N15). Suggested visit: A few minutes.
 The Yeats Statue: One of the more interesting statues in Ireland is a
cartoonish likeness of Sligo’s famous poet near the banks of the
Garavogue River, in Sligo Town. Scrawled over his entire figure are
the words of his own verse.
Location: On Stephen Street, just across Hyde Bridge in Sligo Town.
Suggested visit: A few minutes.
Shopping
The locally famous Foxford wool tweeds, rugs, blankets, and much more
are all at Foxford Woolen Mills Visitor Centre, Foxford, County Mayo
(from Westport N5 northeast to N58 north; % 094-925-6104). As the
Chapter 19: Counties Mayo and Sligo 383

name implies, you can tour the working mill. Pat Sweeny and Son, Achill
Sound, Achill Island, County Mayo (follow signs from Louisburgh off the
R335; % 098-45-211), is a fascinating example of a local trading store,
dating back to 1870. It has “everything from a needle to an anchor” and
all the gifts, clothing, fishing gear, food, and petrol in between. The Cat
and The Moon, 4 Castle St., Sligo Town (% 071-914-3686), sells gor-
geous Irish handcrafted jewelry, contemporary art, Celtic-inspired home
furnishings, and more. Check out the connected art gallery. Stop into
Kate’s Kitchen, 3 Castle St., Sligo Town (% 071-914-3022), for picnic
food: meats, cheeses, salads, pâté, homemade bread, Irish chocolates,
and preserves. The store also has soaps and potpourri.
Hitting the Pubs
Before a Sligo Town pub crawl, you may want to take in a performance at
The Factory (% 071-917-0431; www.blueraincoat.com) or at Hawk’s
Well Theatre (% 071-916-1518; www.hawkswell.com). The perform-
ance schedule at The Factory is diverse, offering everything from West
African music to the excellent production of the Sligo-based Blue
Raincoat Theatre. At the Hawk’s Well, you’ll find professional and local
drama, ranging from classic Irish plays to new dance works.
Furey’s (Sheela na gig)
Sligo Town, County Sligo
Created by members of the traditional Irish music supergroup Dervish,
this pub has great craic (fun) and music every night of the week.
Bridge Street. % 071-914-3825.
Matt Molloy’s
Westport, County Mayo
If you like traditional Irish music, this traditionally decorated pub is worth
visiting. It was started by the flutist from the famous band The Chieftains,
who are often credited with the revival in Irish folk music. The back room
features music nearly every night — Molloy himself sometimes stops in
for a session when he’s in town.
Bridge Street. % 098-26-655.
Yeats Tavern
Drumcliffe Bridge, County Sligo
Just a short walk from the grave of poet W. B. Yeats, this pub is a popular
watering hole for locals and visitors alike. Inside, you find plenty of Yeats
memorabilia and quotes from his works. This place features good pub
grub as well as a restaurant for more formal dining.

ounty Donegal is often ignored by visitors, which is a shame
because the county has natural beauty in spades, plus several areas
where Gaelic culture thrives (especially the Atlantic Peninsula and the
peninsula north of Donegal Bay). The county has many different faces.
The peninsula north of Donegal Bay is stunning, with mountains,
rolling pastureland, charming little towns, and the towering sea cliffs of
Slieve League. The towns on the south side of Donegal Bay are seaside
resorts frequented mostly by Irish vacationers, and some, such as
Bundoran, are pretty tacky. Glenveagh National Park boasts forests,
several sparkling lakes, a castle, and a whole herd of red deer. The
Atlantic Highlands (in the north) and the Inishowen Peninsula are wild
landscapes, vast and breathtaking, with mountains, woodland, cliffs, and
the ever-present crashing of the ocean.
There isn’t one specific area known for human-made sights; instead,
you’ll come across a variety of attractions, including a prehistoric fort
and a house packed with art treasures, as you explore this little-visited
corner of the country.
The largest town in the county, Donegal Town, is a nice, walkable village
along the River Eske. There are no big attractions in town (other than
the castle), so it is not worth spending more than a morning or after-
noon exploring, but it makes a good point of departure for touring the
coast clockwise.
Getting to and around County Donegal
Local flights come into Donegal airport, Carrickfinn, Kincasslagh 
(% 075-954-8284; www.donegalairport.ie), located 65km (40 miles)
from Donegal Town. If you come by car, you can take the N15 north from
Sligo. Bus Éireann (% 1-850-366-222; www.buseireann.ie) travels

County Donegal

year-round to Donegal Town, Ballyshannon, Ardara, Letterkenny, and
other towns in County Donegal.
There’s no local bus service in Donegal Town, but you can easily walk
through and around the town if you don’t have a car. It is best to explore
County Donegal with a car (or a bike if you are a strong biker) because
one of the biggest draws is traveling through the natural scenery.
Spending the Night
For total luxury, check out the new Solis Lough Eske Castle (% 074-
972-5100; www.solislougheskecastle.ie), which opened as this book
went to press. If you are staying right in Donegal Town, the Central
Hotel (% 074-972-1027; www.centralhoteldonegal.com) is a fine (if
overpriced) place to stay. Doubles run from 95 to 160 ($152–$256).
However, if possible I encourage you stay outside town, where you will
find a great assortment of charming and often inexpensive B&Bs. If you
are interested in renting a cottage, house or apartment, call % 087-619-
0240 or visit www.donegalselfcatering.ie.
Ardeevin Bed & Breakfast
$
Lough Eske (outside of Donegal Town)
Perhaps angsty teens should be required to spend a night at Ardeevin,
where it seems impossible not to be cheerful. The spacious, airy rooms
are furnished in a bright, sweet country style with Victorian touches such
as an antique vanity sporting a Victorian-era brush, comb, and mirror set.
Your friendly, very professional hosts serve breakfast (one of the tastiest
Irish breakfasts I’ve ever had) in a dining room decorated with polished
dark-wood furniture, small sparkling chandeliers, and pink glassware. Be
sure to check out the views of Lough Eske from the front of the house.
Take the N15 from Donegal Town, towards Letterkenny and Derry, for 4km (2.5 miles).
Take the 2nd left turn after the Skoda car dealership, and then follow the signs 
for Ardeevin. % 074-972-1790. http://ardeevin.tripod.com. Rates:
65–70 ($104–$112) double. No credit cards.
The Green Gate
$$–$$$
Ardara
If you want Jacuzzi bathtubs, 800 thread count sheets, and bright reading
lamps, this is not the place for you. However, if you are interested in a truly
unusual, bohemian lodging, with stunning views of green hills and ocean,
this just may be your kind of place. Follow the slightly enigmatic symbols
of a green gate from the town of Ardara to the remote hilltop location,
where you’ll be warmly greeted by Paul Chatenoud, an eccentric, kind,
sometimes flirtatious character who was drawn to Donegal from Paris 20
years ago. Meeting Paul, who is full of stories and tips on the best-kept
secrets of Donegal, is half of the reason to come here. The other half of the

roof and one with an old slate roof), and to appreciate the spare but artis-

and a haikulike note on the mirror in the bathroom reading: “The water is

Harvey’s Point Country Hotel

Lough Eske (outside of Donegal Town)
Mention Harvey’s Point to anyone around these parts and they’ll answer
with a smile. This well-known hotel is beautifully situated right on the
shores of Lough Eske, with water views in abundance. Rooms remind me
of those that you see on tours of manor houses, with gorgeous wallpaper,
four-poster beds, and opulent furnishings. And everything is kept in tip-
top condition (I dare you to find a chip in the paint). There is a great atten-
tion to detail — turndown service leaves a small box of chocolates on your
pillow, and the service is exceptional.

Stranorlar/Ballybofey
This charming historic coaching inn is in a great location for exploring
Donegal. The staff is warm and friendly, and the rooms are big and com-
fortable, with views of the grand Blue Stack Mountains. Guests can use the
gym and the pool, and then relax in front of one of the hotel’s open fire-
places. The restaurant serves excellent food, and bikes are available for
rent. The hotel often runs special deals, so check the Web site. Be aware
that the towns of Stranorlar and Ballybofey are small and quiet, so you’ll
definitely want a car or bike for transportation.

This oceanside fishing lodge-turned-four-star hotel boasts a marine spa,

the cliffs, play some golf at one of the three nearby courses, or just take in
comforts of the hotel itself — the rooftop garden, warm fires, fresh flowers,
and homemade scones and pies. It’s worth it to splurge on a room with a
view of the Atlantic Ocean and Donegal Bay.

Decorated with plates and teapots, this cute and cozy restaurant has the
feel of a cottage tearoom out in the countryside. Dishes are simple and
fresh, and the menu runs the gamut from a grilled goat-cheese salad to a
sandwich of turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce on brown bread. For the
very hungry, hearty specials such as a roast beef dinner with Yorkshire
pudding are served.

Mirabeau Steak House
$$
Ramelton
STEAK
With the most courteous of service, and a setting that feels as if you are in
someone’s dining room, this restaurant seems to be a portal to a kinder,
more decorous time. The menu includes nice dishes such as duck á l’or-
ange and grilled lamb cutlets, but it’s the juicy, perfectly cooked steaks
that are the real stars here. I particularly recommend the peppered fillet
with garlic butter, grilled medium-rare. Sides (which are big enough to feed
at least two) are terrific versions of dishes that you’d find in many
American households circa 1950: Waldorf salad, dauphine potatoes, cau-
liflower mornay, and the like. Everything is served at a leisurely pace in a
burgundy room featuring a richly colored tapestry, a fire in the hearth, can-
dlelight, and a wall-to-wall Persian carpet.

SEAFOOD/IRISH
The view itself is enough to make a meal at Smuggler’s Creek memorable.
From the conservatory dining room, which sits atop a cliff, you can look out
at Donegal Bay, and if your timing’s good, you may catch a fantastic sunset.
Inside, the stone building is decorated with wooden stools, lobster pots,
and porthole windows. Not surprisingly, seafood is a specialty here. The
fish specials change depending on what’s fresh, but lobster is almost always

available (and very popular). Landlubbers will find many options, includ-
ing the excellent steak with mushrooms, onions, and a creamy pepper
sauce. Even the bar menu is a notch above, with Atlantic seafood chowder
and a Donegal seafood platter amid the usual soup and sandwiches.
About .5km (1⁄4 mile) off the R231, off the main Sligo-Donegal road (N15). Take the little,
no-name side road from the R231 to get closer to the water. Signs won’t let you miss

Donegal Town
Donegal Town tends to have a plethora of expensive, decent restaurants
for dinner, but doesn’t do very well in the less expensive realm. If you’re
looking for filling, inexpensive food, head down Main Street to Toni’s for
sandwiches, soups, burgers and salads. A cross between a coffee house
and a diner, this place has exposed stone walls and features photos of
Ireland.

Donegal Castle
Donegal Town
Built in the 15th century by the O’Donnell chieftain, this impressive castle
sits beside the River Eske. Inside, lovely furnishings include Persian rugs
and French tapestries — 17th-century additions from the last owner, Sir
Basil Brooke, who also added an extension with ten gables and a large bay
window. Free half-hour guided tours are available.
Off the Diamond in Donegal Town. % 074-732-2405. Admission: 3.70 ($5.90) adult,
2.60 ($4.20) seniors, 1.30 ($2.10) children and students. Open: Mid-Mar to Oct daily
10 a.m.–6 p.m. (last admission at 5:15 p.m.); Nov to mid-Mar Thurs–Mon 9:30–4:30
p.m. (last admission 3:45 p.m.). Suggested visit: 1 hour.
Exploring the Donegal Bay coastline
The peninsula north of Donegal Bay is one of my very favorite places in
all of Ireland. It has gorgeous rolling green pastures, wild mountains,
thatched roof cottages, stunning sea cliffs, sweet and friendly little towns,
Part V: The West and the Northwest 
392

and excellent traditional music. What more could one want? I recommend
taking the N56 west from Donegal Town, and then linking up with the R263
to loop around the peninsula. Though the roads are very narrow (one car-
width only) and twisty, you’ll be rewarded with splendid panoramas and
a real feel for rural Irish culture. For stops along the way, definitely check
out Slieve League, the highest sea cliffs in Europe. The town of
Glencolumbkille, way out on the peninsula, has an atmosphere infused
with Gaelic culture. Most people here speak both Gaelic and English, and
the traditional music is fabulous. At the Glencolumbkille Folk Village
Museum (% 074-973-0017), you can live life as it was in the rural Ireland
of centuries past. For my money, the best-kept secret in Ireland is Port, a
small abandoned farm town perched on green hills overlooking the sea.
To get to Port from Glencolumbkille, go to the top of the main street, and
turn left. When you get to a T-junction, turn right, and start to look for the
signs for Port. You can also get to Port by taking N56 south of Ardara, and
the taking a right turn after Bracky Bridge. A nonlooping coastal walk at
Port provides dazzling views of small cliffs and waves crashing against
rock formations. You could end your day in the cute town of Ardara, which
has many craft and tweed shops, and Nancy’s, a cozy little specimen of a
pub (reviewed later in this chapter).
Though you could drive the peninsula in one day, I’d recommend two. If
you are an experienced hiker, you can also hike around the perimeter of
the peninsula in two days. If you prefer a shorter walk you can join up with
the coastal trail at several places along the coast, including
Glencolumbkille, Port, and Magheera. Another option for the strong-legged
is to explore the peninsula by bicycle (you can rent bikes at Byrne’s in
Ardara; % 074-954-1658).
Glebe House and Gallery
Churchill, Letterkenny
This house was the pride of artist, art collector, and world traveler Derek
Hill, who filled his space with over 300 works of art. The collection is eclec-
tic, ranging from paintings of Mt. Fuji by famed Japanese painter Hokusai,
to Tiffany lamps, and from costume designs by Cecil Beatton to a Renoir
painting. Decorative details, including William Morris wallpaper and cur-
tains, pull the collection together. Don’t miss the paintings by James Dixon,
a celebrated self-taught painter from Ireland’s remote Tory Island, and
check out the call bells in the kitchen, left over from the time when the
house was a hotel. If the weather is nice, you many want to explore the
surrounding grounds. You can only see the house on guided tours, which
leave every half hour. Across from the house is a gallery that features tem-
porary exhibitions.
Off the R251, about 18km (11 miles) west of Letterkenny. % 074-913-7071. Admission:
2.90 ($4.60) adult, 2.10 ($3.40) seniors, 1.30 ($2.10) children and students. Open:
June–Sept daily 11 a.m.–6:30 p.m. (last tour leaves at 5:30 p.m.). Suggested visit: 
11⁄2 hours.

Glenveagh National Park and Castle
Churchill, Letterkenny
This National Park is a beauty, with more than 16,000 hectares of wilder-
ness encompassing valleys and glens, lakes, dense woodlands, bogland,
and the highest mountain in Donegal: Mount Errigal. Encounters with flora
and fauna are often highlights of a visit; keep an eye out for a herd of red
deer, an array of plant life, and all sorts of birds, including golden eagles.
The park is centered on an impressive castle built in 1870 by John George
Adair, who obnoxiously decided to kick 224 tenants off the land to create
his estate. Tours take you through the grand rooms, which contain the fur-
nishings left by the last owner, Henry McIlhenny, an American philanthro-
pist and art collector. Near the castle is an assortment of well-designed,
themed gardens, some featuring exotic plants and flowers. The tea room
at the castle is a charming spot for a warm drink and some light food.
The visitor center has an audiovisual show about the park and informa-
tion on the various trails. If you only have time for one trail, I recommend
the View Point Trail, which goes through forest and opens onto a pictur-
esque panorama of the castle and sparking Lough Veagh. If you are visit-
ing in the summer months, either take bug spray or purchase some from
one of the machines in the archway leading to the gardens.
Northwest from Letterkenny, on the main road to Kilmacrennan (N56). % 074-
913-7090. Admission: Park free; shuttle bus to castle 2 ($3.20) adults, 1 ($1.60) chil-
dren and students. Tours of the castle cost 3 ($4.80) adults, 2 ($3.20) seniors, and
1.50 ($2.40) children and students. Open: Park year-round daily; visitor center and
castle Mar–Oct daily 10 a.m.–6:30 p.m. (last admission at 5 p.m., Nov–Feb daily 9
a.m.–5 p.m. (last admission at 4 p.m.). Suggested visit: 3–4 hours.
Slieve League
Southwest County Donegal
The movie poster slogan for the cliffs of Slieve League (pronounced
sleevleeg) would read: “If you liked the Cliffs of Moher, you’ll love the cliffs
of Slieve League.” These are the highest sea cliffs in Europe. At Carrick,
you can turn off to gaze at their immensity from the Bunglas viewing point
and decide if you want to take the challenge and walk the ridge. The hike,
which starts at the Bunglas viewing point, is narrow and steep, and
requires good balance and good hiking boots. It takes about four to five
hours round-trip. If you’d like to see the cliffs from the ocean, call 
% 087-628-4688 to arrange a boat trip with Nuala Star Teelin. Boats
depart from Teelin pier every two hours from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and at other
times by appointment.
View point is off N56 in Carrick. Admission: Free. Suggested visit: A few minutes for
the view; the walk takes at least 4–5 hours.

pots, and an eclectic assortment of tables, benches, stools, and chairs (my
favorite being the old sewing-machine table). Pub ownership has passed
through seven generations of the same family, and the crowd is always a
jovial, talkative mix of locals and visitors. Excellent seafood is served here,
including oysters, crab claws in garlic butter, and Charlie’s Supper, a dish
of shrimp and smoked salmon in a chile, garlic, and lemon sauce.

N
orthern Ireland has as much splendor and beauty as
the Republic with a fraction of the visitors, making it an
excellent choice for travelers who don’t like crowds. The
green folds of the Mourne Mountains (Chapter 23) beg to be
hiked, and travelers from all over the world come to clamber
over the strange six-sided columns of basalt at the Giant’s
Causeway (Chapter 22). The North Antrim coast (Chapter 22)
is a dramatic landscape of cliffs, beaches, and sea. Farther
south, County Fermanagh (Chapter 21) boasts a giant lake
with many islands.
In addition to natural beauty, Northern Ireland offers two
exciting cities, Belfast (Chapter 22) and Derry (Chapter 21).
Belfast has a burgeoning arts scene, a bunch of excellent
restaurants, and some gorgeous architecture. Being a univer-
sity town, Belfast also has no lack of places to party, from old-
world pubs to trendy clubs. After many years of religious
strife, Derry is enjoying peace and is emerging as a city with a
lot to offer, including quite a few historical sights, a burgeon-
ing nightlife scene, and a growing calendar of theatrical, liter-
ary, and musical events.

It’s a very exciting time to be in Derry/Londonderry City, as the city is
experiencing a rebirth after the Troubles. You’ll find many historical
sights, great pubs, and an up-and-coming arts scene. The pretty county
of Tyrone, with its farmlands, cottages, and gentle mountains, is known
mainly for the excellent Ulster American Folk Park. County Fermanagh
offers a huge and peaceful lake with 154 islands, and the bustling little
town of Enniskillen.
Getting to Counties Derry, 
Fermanagh, and Tyrone
The City of Derry (Eglinton) Airport (% 028-7181-0784; www.cityof

British Airways (% 0844-493-0787 in the U.K., and % 1-890-626-747 in
Ireland; www.britishairways.com) and Ryanair (% 01-249-7791 from
outside of Ireland; www.ryanair.com). The easiest way to get to Derry
from the airport is to take a cab. The fare is £12 ($24) to the city center.

County Derry
Inhabited since the sixth century, Derry/Londonderry City is one of the
oldest cities in Ireland. This small city has seen its share of turmoil and
heartbreak, from the siege led by Catholic King James’ army in 1688, to
the many Irish emigrants who set out from Derry for America in the 18th
and 19th centuries, to the horrors and violence of the Troubles in the
20th century. Things have been peaceful in Derry for a while now, and
the city is becoming a fun and vibrant place on its way up, with burgeon-
ing nightlife, a cultural scene that’s getting more and more vibrant, and
many restored historical sights.
Spending the night in County Derry

tions in Derry/Londonderry City as there are in cities in the South, so be
sure to book as far in advance as possible.

Derry or Londonderry?
During the Troubles, what you called the city depended on where you stood politically.
Unionists (who wish to remain under the English crown) called it Londonderry, while
Nationalists (who want to become part of the Republic of Ireland) called it Derry. You’ll
notice that Derry is usually the name used for the city in the Republic of Ireland, while
Londonderry is more commonly used in Northern Ireland. Newscasters often try to
avert trouble by calling the city “Derry/Londonderry” (said as “Derry-stroke-
Londonderry” since the slash sign is known as a “stroke” here). Recently, many people
have taken to calling the city “Stroke City.”

This well-named restaurant weaves Asian flavors seamlessly into dishes
made with the best in Irish meats, fish, and vegetables. The chile and

coriander lamb shank has a great depth of flavor, and the kick of the
Szechuan chicken is offset by the leeks and roasted beets that accompany
the dish. Even the mashed potatoes get an Asian twist, with cilantro and
coconut milk turning them into an addictive side dish. The atmosphere is
elegant and unpretentious, and the service is excellent. Couples and
groups of friends relax in the dusky-purple room, which is graced with con-
temporary art and oversized vases of dried flowers. If it’s on the menu, the
Malteser Hot Toffee Meringue is a must-try mess of sugary goodness!

Exploring County Derry
Most of the attractions to be seen in County Derry are in Derry/
Londonderry City. Walking and bus tours are the best way to get to
know the city and its complicated background. In my opinion the best
tour of the city walls and the Bogside murals is offered by Derry City
Tours (% 028-7127-1996 or 077-129-37997; try to get Martin as your
guide). Tours leave at 10 a.m., noon, and 2 p.m. every day from the
Tourist Information Centre at 44 Foyle St., and cost £4 ($8) Another great
walking-tour option is McNamara’s Famous Guided Walking Tours
(% 028-7134-5335 for schedules, prices, and meeting spots). Finally,
Open Top Tours (% 077-4024-9998; www.opentoptour.com) takes you
to sights throughout the city, March through October daily, every hour
between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Departures are from the Tourist Information
Centre located at 44 Foyle St. (% 028-7137-7577); and tours cost £8
($16) for adults and £7 ($14) for seniors, students, and children.

Digging into an Ulster Fry
What’s the difference between a traditional Irish breakfast in the Republic and an Ulster
Fry? Well, along with your fried egg, sausage, bacon, black pudding, fried tomatoes,
and toast, you often get soda farls and potato cakes. Soda farls are pieces of soft bread,
fluffed with soda and buttermilk; potato cakes are made with mashed potatoes, flour,
and butter. They’re both fried up with the rest of the breakfast and are delicious.

Apprentice Boys Memorial Hall
Derry/Londonderry
During the Siege of Derry in 1689, thirteen young apprentice boys locked
the gates of the Derry walls, keeping King James II’s army at bay for more
than one hundred days. The Apprentice Boys has become a worldwide
organization with over 10,000 members who commemorate this historic
event. History buffs should be intrigued by this small museum, which tells
the story of the Apprentice Boys and the Siege, from the point of view of
the organization, through text, pictures, and a few objects.
13 Society St. (right off the walls). % 028-7126-3571. Admission: Free. Open:
June–Aug Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Derry City Walls
Derry/Londonderry City
Derry is one of the few European cities that still has intact city walls. The
walls, 7.9m (26 ft.) high and about 9.1m (30 ft.) thick, were built in 1618
and succeeded in keeping Derry safe from many attacks. In fact, the walls
have never been breached, earning Derry the cheeky nickname “The
Maiden City.” I highly recommend walking the city walls. You can walk the
parapet on your own (a few staircases at different points along the walls
take you to the top), or you can take one of the excellent tours described
in the preceding “Exploring County Derry” section.
Free Derry Corner and the Bogside Murals
Derry/Londonderry City
Bogside is one of the Catholic neighborhoods in Derry that has seen the
worst of the Catholic–Protestant conflict. In 1969, a local man painted the
words “You are now entering Free Derry” on a wall at the corner of Fahan
and Rossville streets. This act and the slogan became a symbol of resist-
ance to British Rule. The Bogside Murals (also known as the People’s
Gallery) were created by a collective of three artists who began working
together in 1993. These murals depict events in Derry/Londonderry since
1968, and include, among others, a mural of Annette McGavigan, the first
child victim of the Troubles; a mural of a young petrol bomber; and mural
depicting the events of Bloody Sunday, when 13 civil-rights marchers were
shot by British soldiers.
Bogside area. The best way to see the murals is with the artists who painted them.
The artists give tours and talks about the murals from their studio at 7 Meenan Sq.
Call % 028-7137-3842 to arrange a tour or talk. Tour companies that give tours of the
city walls also cover the murals. Suggested visit: 30–60 minutes.
St. Columb’s Cathedral and Chapter House Museum
Derry/Londonderry City
This Gothic Protestant cathedral — named for Saint Columb, founder
of Derry — towers above the city walls. It houses many memorials and
relics from the 1688 to 1689 siege of Derry, when the city’s Protestant 
Part VI: Northern Ireland 
406

population held out against the forces of Catholic King James I for 105
days, helping secure the throne for Protestant King William III. Points of
interest include the stained glass that tells the story of the siege, and the
tremendous mortar ball that King James fired over the city walls embed-
ded with a note asking the people of Derry to surrender (they refused).
The Chapter House Museum displays artifacts of the city’s history, includ-
ing the original keys to the city gates, and shows an audiovisual presen-
tation relating the history of the city.
London Street. % 028-7126-7313. Admission: £2 ($4) per person. Open: Apr–Sept daily
9 a.m.–5 p.m.; Oct–Mar daily 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 2–4 p.m. Suggested visit: 45 minutes.
Tower Museum
Derry/Londonderry City
This well-done museum really gets at the heart of Derry history, covering
events and daily life from prehistoric times to the present day. You’ll find
everything from Stone Age tools recovered in the area, to a life-size dio-
rama of a woman creating the shirt collars — a task that kept many fami-
lies financially afloat during the early 20th century. In addition, the
museum has added an excellent exhibit focused on artifacts recovered
from a Spanish Armada ship that wrecked nearby. Part of a cittern, olive
oil jugs, and ship fittings are just some of the objects that you’ll find in the
display. The museum is housed in the O’Doherty Tower, a replica of the
16th-century medieval fort that stood on this spot.
Union Hall Place. % 028-7137-2411. Admission: £4 ($8) adults, £2.50 ($5) children and
seniors. Open: July and Aug Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m. and Sun 10 a.m.–2 p.m.,
Sept–June Tues–Fri 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Suggested visit: 1 hour.
Shopping in Derry/Londonderry City
The best shopping is found in the inner city, in the Richmond Centre, a
modern mall facing the Diamond in the center of town and featuring
more than 30 shops and boutiques.
The Victorian-style department store Austin & Co. Ltd., The Diamond
(% 028-7126-1817), is a city landmark, specializing in clothes, perfume,
china, crystal, and linens. The coffee shop on the third floor has a great
view of the city.
Chapter 21: Counties Derry, Fermanagh, and Tyrone 407
A story of hope
For many years, the mural depicting Annette McGavigan, the first child victim of the
Troubles, had a black and white butterfly representing the unsure future of the peace
process. In the summer of 2006, the artists decided to add vivid colors to the butterfly
to symbolize their confidence in the continuing success of the process and their delight
in the city’s revitalization.

Nightlife in Derry/Londonderry City
The Playhouse, 5–7 Artillery St. (% 028-7126-8027; www.derryplay

dance. The Verbal Arts Centre, Mall Wall and Stable Lane, Bishop Street
(% 028-7126-6946; www.verbalartscentre.co.uk), is an incredible
place, dedicated to literature in all of its forms. It hosts all sorts of read-
ings, classes, and storytelling events. The Millennium Forum, Newmarket

gram of plays, dance, and musicals, including children’s shows.
Hitting the pubs
Want to hear traditional Irish music in Derry/Londonderry? Head to
Waterloo Street, just outside the city walls in front of Butcher and Castle
Gates. Some of the best pubs for informal sessions lie along this route. 
In particular, the Dungloe Bar (% 028-7126-7716), Bound for Boston
(% 028-7127-1315), Castle Bar (% 028-7126-6018), and Peadar

places to have a pint.

such things in this setting, which is incredibly peaceful. The house is

are bright and clean, combining contemporary pine furnishings with
Victorian and country-style touches, and many have beautiful views of the

Oh, the porridge. Perhaps half of the reason to stay at this grand former

heavenly concoction is made with Bushmills whiskey, heavy cream, and a

too shabby either: kind and professional hosts, beautiful grounds, the

Horse lovers will delight at the equestrian décor here. The food is hearty,
delicious, and varied at both the restaurant and the pub, but I recommend
dining in the pub, which is a real locals’ place, with groups of friends dis-
cussing the news, older men who seem to live on their bar stools, and kids
running around. Steaks are the specialty at both the pub and the restau-
rant, and with good reason — their filet with garlic butter could give Peter
Luger a run for their money. At the pub, you’ll find lasagna; chicken, fish,
and lamb dishes; and salads. The restaurant serves standards plus more
adventurous dishes such as a pork filet pan-fried in cream sauce with
peaches and caramelized apples; and monkfish with a vanilla dressing. A
new wine bar and bistro is open daily from 5 p.m. until late and on Sunday

Marble Arch Caves
Florencecourt, County Fermanagh
Exploring the Marble Arch Caves is like traveling to another world. Guides
lead you on foot through the winding passages and echoing chambers of
the caves, pointing out stalactites, stalagmites, curtains, and all sorts of
other mineral formations, and offering detailed information on the natu-
ral history of the caves. For much of the way you’ll follow the bends of an
underground river; my favorite part of the tour is seeing a collection of sta-
lactites reflected perfectly in the still water below like a lost city. The short
boat ride at the beginning of the tour is another highlight, as you glide
silently through some of the smaller chambers.
Part VI: Northern Ireland 
412

The Marble Arch Caves are very popular, so it’s wise to book ahead.
Also, it gets pretty chilly down under, so bring a sweater. If there’s been
heavy rain, the caves occasionally close for safety reasons, so call if
there’s been bad weather. Finally, it’s important to wear comfortable
shoes and to be in decent shape, as you will be walking and climbing
stairs for the bulk of the tour.
Marlbank Scenic Loop. Off the A35, 19km (12 miles) south of Enniskillen. When you’re
in the village of Florencecourt, near the border of Northern Ireland and the Republic,
there is a loop road that takes you out to the caves, with plenty of signs to point the
way. % 028-6634-8855. Admission: £8 ($16) adults, £5.25 ($11) students and seniors,
£5 ($10) children under 18. Open: Mid-Mar to June and Sept daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (last
tour leaves at 4:30 p.m.); July–Aug daily 10 a.m.–6:30 p.m. (last tour leaves at 5 p.m.).
Suggested visit: About 21⁄2 hours.
Ulster American Folk Park
Castletown, County Tyrone
This immensely interesting outdoor folk park features actual rebuilt 18th-
and 19th-century buildings from Ireland and America, from a Pennsylvania
log farmhouse to an Irish-Catholic mass house (a home used as a church).
Costumed interpreters are stationed throughout to illustrate and explain
life during these times. You begin your tour in Ireland and then board a
replica of a 19th-century ship bound for America. When you exit, you’re in
the America of the 18th and 19th centuries. I recommend tagging along
with a school group so that you can watch the interpreters role-play every-
one from a 19th-century Irish schoolteacher to an American saddler.
The Folk Park has an excellent lineup of events, including American
Independence Day celebrations in July, an Appalachian and Bluegrass
music festival in September, and a Halloween Festival in October.

Chapter 22: Belfast and County Antrim 417
If you’re coming by car from Dublin, take the M1 to the N1 (which
becomes the A1) north to Belfast. To get to the Antrim Coast from
Belfast, take the A2, which runs along the entire coast. If you’re driving
from the Republic into Northern Ireland, make sure you notify your
rental-car company, because extra insurance may be required.
Irish Rail (% 1850-366-222; www.irishrail.ie) and Northern Ireland
Railway (% 888-BRITRAIL or 028-90-66-66-30; www.nirailways.co.uk)
trains travel from Dublin’s Connolly Station to Belfast’s Central Station
daily and connect many towns in Northern Ireland.
Ulsterbus (% 028-9066-6630; www.translink.co.uk) runs buses to
and from towns all over Northern Ireland, including Belfast, Larne,
Ballycastle, Bushmills, and several other towns. Ulsterbus also provides
service between Belfast and Dublin.
Getting around Belfast and the surrounding area
You can easily navigate Belfast by bus and on foot, so you may want to
park your car while you explore or forgo a car altogether. A bus service,
Metro (% 028-9066-6630; www.translink.co.uk/Metro.asp), oper-
ates throughout the city. Most buses depart from Donegall Square in the
city center. Smartlink multijourney tickets are available at most
newsagents (look for the Smartlink sign). If you’re going to be moving
around the city a lot, it makes sense to buy an all-day ticket. See
“Exploring Belfast and the surrounding area,” later in this chapter, for
information on bus tours in Belfast.
You can also get around Belfast and the area by bike. Life Cycles, 36–37
Smithfield Market (% 028-9043-9959; www.lifecycles.co.uk), rents
bikes and provides helmets, locks, and maps.
If you need a cab, look for the taxi ranks at Central Station, both bus sta-
tions, and at City Hall. The metered cabs in Northern Ireland are stan-
dardized London-style black taxis with yellow discs on the windshield. I
recommend that you take the standard cabs rather than nonmetered
cabs. If you do take a nonmetered cab, ask for the price of the journey
when you first enter the cab so that you don’t get taken for a monetary
ride in addition to a taxi ride. If you need a cab, try Gransha Taxis
(% 028-9060-2092).

Belfast
Funky, trendy Benedicts is at the center of everything, near some of
Belfast’s top attractions and hottest eateries and nightspots. Rooms on

sleekly minimalist. The beds are unbelievably comfortable. The staff is
friendly, and the Gothic-style bar and restaurant serve up excellent
Continental fare in a lively atmosphere.

Culloden Hotel
$$$$
Holywood, County Down
The Culloden, located near the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, is a
government-rated five-star hotel — and it deserves every point on those
stars. A former 19th-century mansion, the hotel is surrounded by almost
5 hectares (12 acres) of beautiful, secluded gardens and the picturesque
Holywood Hills. Bedrooms are nicely decorated with modern furnishings,
and public rooms are filled with stunning antiques, Louis XV chandeliers,
and decorative plasterwork. A terrific spa offers all sorts of treatments.
Service is impeccable. Would British Prime Ministers Tony Blair and John
Major have stayed here if it wasn’t?

Europa Hotel
$$$$
Belfast
The spacious rooms in this world-class high-rise hotel are decked to the
nines — huge beds and sofas, luxurious fabrics, and beautiful mahogany
furnishings. But you probably won’t be spending much time in your room,
given the hotel’s fabulous location. It’s in the heart of Belfast, right next 
to the Grand Opera House and near the bustling Golden Mile, which is
lined with historic buildings. The guests here tend to be cosmopolitan and
elegant.

Step right up, folks, for one of the best deals in town. The seven good-size
rooms here are decorated in cozy Victorian style and get a lot of light
through their large windows. You can’t beat the location: near the univer-
sity, the Botanic Gardens, and loads of funky restaurants and hopping clubs.
Proprietor Kate Boyd will fortify you for the day with her “heart attack on
a plate” breakfast and help you plan an itinerary for exploring the city.

Killead Lodge
$
Belfast
Craving a country hideaway while you explore Belfast? Located about 20
minutes from Belfast and right near Belfast International Airport, Killead
Lodge could be summed up in the word “cheerful.” Rooms, painted lemon
yellow, feature comfortable beds and flat-screen TVs, and several cats fre-
quent the back garden. Breakfast is ample and satisfying, and your hosts
are willing to help with anything. If you stay here, definitely check out
Spice, an excellent Indian restaurant down the road.

Malmaison
$$$–$$$$
Belfast
This trendy, sophisticated lodging is the definition of a boutique hotel. It’s
housed in converted 1867 grain warehouses that retain gorgeous archi-
tectural details, and it offers incredibly friendly, professional, and personal
service. The spacious rooms are decorated with warm tones in a hip,
modern style (the hotel calls it “rock-and-roll” style), and are designed to
anticipate every need, with height-of-comfort beds, minibars (rare in these
parts), and heated towel racks. The city center is a five-minute walk away.
34–38 Victoria St. From the M3, take the Queen’s Bridge across the river, and make
a right onto Victoria Street. % 028-9022-0200. Bus: 8, 13, 13B, 21, 155, 160, 161, or
Centrelink (100). Rates: £150–£170 ($300–$340). AE, DC, MC, V.
Ten Square
$$$$
Belfast
The designers of this Asian-style, minimalist hotel in central Belfast wouldn’t
know the meaning of the word “clutter.” Rooms are a study in simple ele-
gance, with vases of fresh flowers, and low beds covered with white com-
forters. I must admit, however, that the hotel is resting on its laurels a bit;
a few minor facelifts would put it back in the big leagues. You don’t have to
go far for nourishment; the hotel restaurant, The Grill, serves up great food.

FUSION
This wonderful restaurant was one of the first stars in Belfast’s constella-
tion of excellent fusion eateries. It’s still going strong, serving dishes that
combine ingredients in unexpectedly delicious ways, such as the appetizer
of cinnamon quail with carrot, honey, and ginger salad. You can’t go wrong
with any of the main courses, from rabbit with fresh pasta, black olives,
rosemary, and pancetta to lobster with black-bean vinaigrette and steamed
basmati rice. Service is friendly and professional, and the decked-out
crowd is always in high spirits.

Come to Copperfields for a satisfying meal at a good price. The hearty

rowing Mexican and Asian influences, and all ingredients are fresh and
local. What makes this place so popular, in addition to the food, are the
comfy sofas and cozy booths.

NEW IRISH
This baroque-looking restaurant is a temple to upscale Irish cuisine, with
dishes that make use of local ingredients. The menu changes all the time;
the last time I visited choices included local lamb with vine tomatoes, rata-
touille, rosemary crumble, and niçoise jus; and veal with sage-and-apple
risotto, crushed organic carrots and horseradish, and a bordelaise sauce.
If you want to experience Michael Deane’s recipes without having to take
out a second mortgage, try the casual Deane’s Deli, at 44 Bedford St.

INTERNATIONAL
Set in an old warehouse, this restaurant exudes charm; and, despite the
size of the place, it feels quite intimate. The service is wonderful (I rec-
ommend letting the staff choose something for you if you can’t decide).
The menu changes frequently and gathers inspiration from cuisines all
over the world, but you won’t be disappointed with the options, from
grilled tuna with sweet-pepper-and-chile sauce to a butternut squash
risotto with Jerusalem artichokes and toasted cashews.

Calling all sushi-holics: This hip spot is the place to get your raw-fish-and-
vinegared-rice fix in Belfast. Bartenders shake martinis behind the glass
bar, lit with blue lights, and club-gear-clad 20-somethings strut through the
high-ceilinged, dramatic space, which is decorated with carved Japanese
wooden screens, black lacquer tables, and a large shiny Buddha. I always
order sushi here, but the menu also features an array of cooked Japanese
dishes, from vegetable curry to chicken teriyaki.

Exploring Belfast and the surrounding area
City Sightseeing Belfast (% 028-9045-9035; www.belfastcitysight
seeing.com) operates one-and-a-half-hour hop-on/hop-off history tours
of Belfast that stop at Belfast’s top attractions (you can hop off the bus
and join another bus later at each attraction). Knowledgeable guides do
an excellent job of explaining the city’s history from the 18th century up
until the present day. From May through September, tours depart daily
every half-hour between 9:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. From October through
April, tours depart daily every hour between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. All tours
leave from Castle Place (across from McDonald’s) in Belfast’s city center.
Prices are £11 ($22) adults, £9 ($18) seniors and students, and £5 ($10)
children ages 4 to 12.
Local experts lead two terrific 90-minute walking tours that depart from
the Belfast Welcome Centre (the main tourist information office), at 47
Donegall Place. On the Historic Belfast Walking Tour your guide will

Chapter 22: Belfast and County Antrim 423
relate over 300 years of Belfast history as he or she takes you through the
city, pointing out everything from Titanic-related sights to the extravagant
Victorian city hall. The tour departs on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays,
and Sundays at 2 p.m. year-round. To book in advance, call % 028-9024-
6609. The Blackstaff Way Tour is the best introduction to the heart of
Belfast, taking in most of the city’s main streets, including Great Victoria
Street, the main thoroughfare. The tour departs at 11 a.m. every Saturday.
To book in advance, call % 028-9029-2631. Both tours cost £6 ($12).
The Belfast Black Taxi Tours (% 028-9064-2264; www.belfasttours.
com) or Belfast’s Original Political Tours (% 080-8127-1125) are the
best way to get a sense of the rocky history of the city, which saw much
of the violence during the height of The Troubles in the 1970s, ’80s, and
early ’90s. Your guide will explain ins and outs of The Troubles as you
view the many political murals found in the hearts of the sectarian
neighborhoods, including Protestant Shankill Road and Catholic Falls
Road. Tours cost £25 ($50) for one or two passengers, or £ 8 ($16) each
for three or more passengers.
The top attractions
Belfast’s Murals
Belfast
Northern Ireland has a tradition of public mural painting that dates to the
early 1970s. Though some murals are not political or religious in nature,
most depict Republican or Loyalist political beliefs. The most compelling
of Belfast’s murals are found along Republican (and primarily Catholic)
Falls Road and along Loyalist (and primarily Protestant) Shankill Road and
Sandy Row. Both of these areas are currently quite safe for visitors; in fact,
residents are used to the interested sightseers who come to visit these
areas. If you’d like to view the murals with a guide, contact Belfast Black
Taxi Tours or Belfast’s Original Political Tours (see earlier in this chapter).
To reach Falls Road from the center of the city, head north on Donegall Place, turn
left on Castle Street, go straight ahead down Divis Road and cross Westlink to Falls
Road. To find Shankill Road, head north on Donegall Place and Royal Avenue, turn left
on Peter’s Hill and cross Westlink Road. To find Sandy Row, go south on Great Victoria
Street, make a right on Donegall Pass Road, and then another right up Sandy Row.
Belfast Wheel
Belfast
What could be a better introduction to Belfast than sailing high over the
city in the pod of a giant Ferris wheel? The Belfast wheel trip lasts about
12 minutes and gives you a running commentary on what you are seeing.
Those who are feeling extravagant can indulge in the VIP car, complete
with tinted windows and champagne service.

Belfast
This excellent zoo, which boasts a fantastic view of Belfast Lough, features
many endangered animals, a Children’s Farm, an island of spider monkeys,

City Hall
Belfast
Modeled on St. Paul’s Cathedral in London, Belfast’s City Hall was built in
1888 after Queen Victoria conferred city status on Belfast. The building is
made of Portland stone, with a central copper dome that rises 52m (173 ft.)
into the sky and is visible for miles. In front, there are a statue of the queen
and a memorial to the victims of the Titanic, which was built in a Belfast
shipyard.
Donegall Square. % 028-9027-0456, ext. 2618. Bus: 58, 59, 69, 69A, 70, 71, 89, 90, 91,

given throughout the week; call for exact times. Other times by appointment.
Reservations required for all tours. Suggested visit: 45 minutes.
Mount Stewart House and Gardens
Newtownards, County Down
Though its interior is just grand, with a fabulous entrance hall and the
famous George Stubbs painting Hambletonian, this impressive 18th-cen-
tury mansion almost pales in comparison with the spectacular gardens
surrounding it. There’s a fabulous Shamrock Garden, which has an Irish
harp–shaped topiary and a flowerbed shaped like a red hand (the emblem
of Ulster) enclosed in a hedge shaped like a shamrock. Spanish and Italian
gardens are in the back, and a colorful sunken garden sits in the east yard.
On the A2, 5km (3 miles) southeast of Newtownards, along the Ards Peninsula. % 028-
4278-8387. Admission: House and garden £7 ($14) adults, £3.50 ($5) children; gardens
only £5.35 ($8.70) adults, £2.70 ($5.40) children. Open: House and garden hours vary
throughout the year, so definitely call to confirm. Generally, the house is open
May–Sept Wed–Mon 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Sept–Oct and Mar–Apr weekends noon to 6
p.m. Closed: Nov to mid-Mar. Garden open daily year-round at 10 a.m.; closing time
varies from 8 p.m. in summer to 4 p.m. in winter. Suggested visit: 1 hour.

Ulster Folk and Transport Museum
Holywood, County Down
This is one of those attractions that kids and adults both love. This truly
excellent museum is composed of two very different parts: In the giant
Transport Galleries is a stunning collection of trains, cars, buses, trams,
motorcycles, and bicycles, featuring all sorts of gems from a Victorian bicy-
cle to a section of the first railway in Ireland to a DeLorean car (that famous
Back to the Future vehicle), along with interesting text and displays about
the various forms of transportation. A highlight is climbing inside to
explore some of the buses, trams, and trains. An exciting recent addition
to the transport section of the museum is a flight exhibit, which explores
the history and science of flight using interactive science displays, arti-
facts related to the history of flight (including some actual aircraft), and a
popular eight-person flight simulator.
The other half of this attraction is an extremely well-done living museum of
Ireland in the early 1900s. The museum has re-created a town and a rural
area, rebuilding actual period buildings from all over Ireland on this site.
Costumed interpreters carry out the tasks of daily life in these buildings —
you can watch them cook over an open hearth, spin wool, work metal, print
the town newspaper, make lace, and so on; and often, you can try your hand
at these activities with them. Don’t miss the sweet (in both senses of the
word) candy store in the town area. The museum hosts all sorts of events
year-round.
Off the A2, 11km (7 miles) east of Belfast. % 028-9242-8428. Admission: Folk museum
and transport museum individually £5.50 ($11) adults, £3.50 ($7) seniors, students, and
children, free for children under 5; combined admission £7 ($14) adults, £4 ($8) sen-
iors, students, and children, free for children under 5. Open: Mar–June Mon–Fri

Shopping in Belfast
Belfast’s City Hall is a perfect landmark for the shopping district, which
is just across the street. There, you’ll find posh (and expensive) British
department stores, Irish shops, and some North American chains.
The Steensons, in Bedford House, Bedford Street (% 028-9024-8269),
sells celebrated contemporary gold and silver jewelry made by Christina
and Bill Steenson. Smyth’s Irish Linens, 65 Royal Ave. (% 028-9024-
2232), sells a full stock of Irish linens. Much more than just a shop, the
Irish Linen Centre, Market Square, Lisburn (about 16km/10 miles from
Belfast; % 028-9266-3377), exhibits the history of the famous Ulster
linen and conducts hand-weaving demonstrations — and, of course,
sells plenty of Irish linen, from coats to clothes.
Enjoying nightlife in Belfast
Belfast has a hot and happening nightlife, with lots of club action in addi-
tion to the usual pubs.

Chapter 22: Belfast and County Antrim 427
Hitting the pubs
Belfast has some of Ireland’s finest pubs, many authentically Victorian.
The company that produces the famed Bailey’s Irish Cream hosts a good
Belfast Pub Tour that covers six of the best pubs in the city, most with
traditional music. The tour lasts about two hours and meets May
through October Thursdays at 7 p.m. and Saturdays at 4 p.m., above The
Crown Liquor Saloon, at 46 Great Victoria St. To ensure a spot on the
tour, call % 028-9268-3665 in advance. Tours cost £6 ($11).
Crown Liquor Saloon
Unquestionably the most famous pub in Belfast, and perhaps the most
beautiful in Ireland, the Crown is owned by the state (by the National
Trust, to be exact). The traditional interior is gorgeous, with hand-painted
tiles, carved wood, brass fittings, and gas lamps — truly a perfect Irish
watering hole. The local Strangford Lough oysters are excellent. You may
want to find a seat early — The Crown fills up most evenings.
46 Great Victoria St. % 028-9027-9901. Bus: 82, 83, 84, 85, or Centrelink (100).
Kelly’s Cellars
Not only is this the oldest continuously used licensed pub in Belfast, but
Kelly’s was also the popular meeting place for the United Irishmen, who
organized the 1798 Rebellion. The name is misleading; Kelly’s Cellars is a
two-storied building with a stone-floored bar downstairs, decorated with
all sorts of memorabilia, and a restaurant upstairs. Despite its popularity,
Kelly’s remains a locals place, filled with interesting characters and often
featuring great traditional music. If you get hungry, try the incredible Black
Velvet Steak Pie.
30 Bank St. % 028-9024-6058. Bus: 80, 81, or Centrelink (100).
Madison’s Café Bar
One of the city’s newest and most stunning bars, Madison’s is named for
the modern hotel in which it’s housed. Featuring an Art Nouveau theme
and sporting a striking copper-and-ceramic bar top, it’s a sophisticated
and hip gathering place for young professionals and students. There’s an
over-25 club downstairs that’s great for dancing.
59–63 Botanic Ave. % 028-9050-9800. Bus: 82, 83, 85, 89, 90, 91, or 92.
The Morning Star
You have to go down an alley between High and Ann streets to find this
historic pub, but you can’t miss its striking green-and-red facade, and
anyway, it’s worth the hunt. The Star serves up the best pint of Caffrey’s
(Belfast’s hometown brew) in town. That’s reason enough to go, but the
comfortable interior and unique horseshoe bar are attractions as well.
17–19 Pottingers Entry. % 028-9032-3976. Bus: 8, 13, 13B, 21, 155, 160, 161, or

10–14 Tomb St. % 028-9027-8876. Bus: 8, 13, 13B, 21, 155, 160, or 161.
North Antrim
North Antrim is a place of dramatic beauty, with sheer sea-pounded
cliffs, pristine green valleys, and the spectacular weirdness of the Giant’s
Causeway. Outdoorsy folks will have a ball. I recommend driving the
coastal route along the Antrim Glens, starting at the town of Larne and
heading north. The drive takes you along sleepy seaside towns, pictur-
esque crescents of sand, and stunningly green fields, and deposits you at
most of the top sights in this area.
If you don’t have a car, take advantage of the Antrim tour run by
CitySightseeing Belfast (% 028-9031-5333; www.belfastcitysight
seeing.com). The tour takes you to the Giant’s Causeway, Carrick-A-
Rede Rope Bridge, Dunluce Castle, and the Bushmills Distillery. Tours
depart daily at 9:15 a.m., returning at 6 p.m., and cost £18 ($36) for
adults, £12 ($24) for children.
If you are interested in taking a guided overnight bike tour of Antrim,
check out the offerings at Irish Cycle Tours (% 066-712-8733 [number
is in the Republic]; www.irishcycletours.com).
Best pubs for traditional music
Some of the best pubs in Belfast to get those toes a-tappin’ include Madden’s Bar,
Berry Street (% 028-9024-4114; music Thurs–Fri and Mon–Tues); the Duke of York, 11
Commercial Court, off Lower Donegall Street (% 028-9024-1062; traditional music on
Thurs); Front Page, 106–110 Donegall St. (% 028-9032-4924; schedule changes, so call
to find out what’s on); Kelly’s Cellars (see earlier in this chapter), and Kitchen Bar, 16
Victoria Sq. (% 028-9032-4901; traditional music Sat afternoon).

Adelphi Portrush
$$
Portrush
The Adelphi is located in the center of bustling Portrush, a vacation town
if there ever was one, with amusement centers and a semi-permanent
amusement park. The Adelphi itself is calm and composed, with every
detail well thought out by its proprietors, who are passionate not only
about giving guests a great experience but also about making their hotel
ecofriendly. This attention to detail is evidenced in the heated stones on
the floor of the Jacuzzi area, the laden breakfast table, the extensive menu
of treatments at the spa, and the earth-friendly LEDs that light much of the
hotel. The rooms have the feel of a business hotel, with plush red carpet-
ing and finely crafted pine furniture, and many have great views of either
town or sea. Try to score a room on the fourth floor, where several rooms
showcase the hotel’s original oak beams. The Giant’s Causeway, Dunluce
Castle, Carrick-A-Read Rope Bridge, and several golf courses are easily
accessible by car from the hotel.

The Bushmills Inn

Bushmills
The warm glow of a turf fire greets you when you enter this fantastic inn,
with its grand staircase, gas lamps, and many antiques. You have a choice
between the quaint, individually decorated rooms in the Coaching Inn and
the much larger and newer rooms in the Mill House. The cozy library and
the oak-beamed loft living room may tempt you to skip sightseeing for a
day and curl up by the fire with one of the inn’s excellent Irish coffees
(made, of course, with premium Bushmills whiskey). Tasty Irish and New
Irish cuisine is served in the restaurant (see p. 430).
Located on the A2 (called Main St. in Bushmills), on the banks of the Bush River.

The Causeway Hotel
$$
Bushmills
Located right next to the famed Giant’s Causeway, this hotel’s view of the
spectacular coast cannot be beaten. This old, family-run hotel dates back
to 1836, and although it’s been restored and has modern conveniences
(rooms have just been outfitted with flat-screen HD TVs), it hasn’t lost its
old-fashioned feel and sense of hospitality. The rooms are large and clean,
but generally unremarkable. That won’t matter, though, because you’ll be
spending all your time gazing at the amazing scenery rather than the
draperies.

Bushmills
IRISH
Located in the venerable Bushmills Inn, this restaurant has an elegant feel,
with whitewashed walls, garnet tablecloths, and warm lighting. Maybe
you’ll go for the maple-glazed filet of salmon, served with savory cabbage,
bacon, and a chestnut-mushroom cream sauce; or perhaps you’re more in
the mood for the grilled sirloin steak served with red-onion marmalade
and blue-cheese butter. You can’t go wrong; every dish is beautifully pre-
pared. For dessert, the sticky toffee pudding is legendary.

Ballygarry
IRISH
Situated on the southern end of the Glens of Antrim, this restaurant prob-
ably has the best view of any restaurant on the Northern Coast. The staff
is friendly and chatty, and the wine list is as good as it is long. Regional
dishes such as duck, pheasant, and salmon fill the menu, and everything’s
made with as many fresh local ingredients as possible. This is a wonder-
ful stop for anyone driving the coast road, both for a delicious meal and a
chance to see the view at leisure. Try the John Dory if it’s on the menu.

burgers, a lamb kabob with peppers and onions, and an excellent Thai
green curry. Try to get a seat at one of the large windows, which overlook
the hustle and bustle of the oceanfront and harbor. And don’t miss the

Chapter 22: Belfast and County Antrim 431
Exploring North Antrim
I highly recommend taking the A2, a spectacular coastal drive along sea-
splashed cliffs and by small coastal towns with picturesque harbors.
Major attractions along the road include the Giant’s Causeway, the
Dunluce Castle ruins, and the Carrick-A-Rede Rope Bridge (all reviewed
later in this section).
Walkers will want to check out the Ulster Way, the Moyle Way, and the
Causeway Coast Path; all three are long-distance hikes, but of course
you can do part of any as a day- or half-day hike. Check out Walk
Northern Ireland, available at most tourist offices and as a PDF on
www.discovernorthernireland.com (click on Walking, under the
“Things to See & Do” tab, for trail maps and details).
Ardclinis Activity Center, 11 High St., Cushendall (% 028-2177-1340;
www.ardclinis.com), offers outdoor activities from rock-climbing to
rafting. Their programs can be as short as a half-day to as long as a week.
Golfers will certainly want to try Royal Portrush, Dunluce Road,
Portrush, County Antrim (% 028-7082-2311; www.royalportrushgolf
club.com). The excellent 18-hole Dunluce Course offers amazing sea-
side views of the northern Antrim Coast, while the underrated Valley
Course has beautiful inland views. To get there from Belfast, take the M2
north to Ballymena and then the A26 to Ballymoney. At the roundabout,
follow the sign to Portrush (about 16km/10 miles down the road). Par is
72 on both courses. From April through October, fees for the Dunluce
Course are £120 ($240) during the week and £135 ($270) weekends;
November through March, they’re £60 ($120) from Sunday through
Friday. From April to October, fees for the Valley Course are £35 ($70)
during the week and £40 ($80) on the weekend; November through
March they’re £25 ($45) Monday through Friday. The courses are open
daily from 9:30 a.m. to noon and 2 p.m. onward. Guests are welcome
daily except for mornings on Mondays and afternoons on Wednesdays,
Fridays, and Saturdays. Book in advance.
Carrick-A-Rede Rope Bridge
Larrybane
Here’s one for the Indiana Jones in all of us! This heart-stopping rope
bridge, spanning a chasm 18m (60 ft.) wide, is not for the fainthearted: It
wiggles and shakes underfoot as the sea crashes 24m (80 ft.) below; and,
no matter how brave you are, you’re in for a scare. It’s worth it though —
the views of coastal cliffs and the sea from the area are dazzling, and on a
clear day you can see all the way to the coast of Scotland! Seabirds nest on
the cliffs of the island, and you can often see them hovering in the wind.
There is a 1km (0.62 mile) walk to the bridge.
Off the B15 (look for the signs). % 028-2076-9839. Admission: £3.70 ($7.40) adults, £2

Dunluce Castle
Bushmills
These gorgeous castle ruins, mostly dating from the late 16th century,
perch precariously over the sea (so precariously, in fact, that part of the
main house plunged into the sea below in 1639). You can explore at will,
discovering ruined fireplaces, round towers, and picture windows that
frame the sea and sky, and imagining the lives of the powerful Scottish
family that lived in this dramatic place. I recommend getting an informa-
tion sheet from the visitor center before entering the ruins; it’s full of inter-
esting details about the different areas of the ruins. Guided tours of the
castle can be arranged with advance notice.
Dunluce Road. Take the A2 about 5.6km (31⁄2 miles) east of Portrush. % 028-2073-1938.
Admission: £2 ($4) adults, £1 ($2) seniors and children over 4. Open: Apr–Sept daily

Giant’s Causeway
Bushmills
This is one of Ireland’s strangest and most awesome sights. The Giant’s
Causeway is a 4.8km (3-mile) stretch of roughly 40,000 tightly packed,
mostly hexagonal basalt rock columns of varying heights — some up to
12m (40 ft.) tall — that jut up from the foot of a cliff and eventually disap-
pear under the sea. Experts will tell you the causeway was formed by the
quick cooling of an ancient volcanic eruption, but according to legend,
Finn MacCool built the causeway as a path across the sea to reach his girl-
friend on a Scottish island. (An aside: In 1842, the writer William Thackeray
noted in his Irish Sketch Book, “Mon Dieu! And I have traveled a hundred
and fifty miles to see that?” Just goes to show, even the eighth wonder of
the world can’t please everybody!) You can either walk or take the shuttle
bus to the biggest concentration of columns.
Off the A2 along the North Antrim Coast. % 028-2073-1855. Parking £5 ($10), shuttle
bus £1 ($2). Open: Visitor center July–Sept daily 10 a.m.–7 p.m.; Oct–June daily 10 a.m.–

1–11⁄2 hours.
The Old Bushmills Distillery
Bushmills
A thorough and well-guided tour of the world’s oldest distillery, which still
produces whiskey, awaits you at Bushmills. One highlight: a room so heady
with whiskey fumes that the workers have to get a ride home at the end of
the day because they’ve inhaled so much alcohol. (No fear; a couple of
minutes won’t affect you.) The shop has every Bushmills product you can
imagine, from fudge to golf towels and, of course, every kind of whiskey
the distillery makes. The tour ends with a taste test.

Rathlin’s strategic position between Ireland and Scotland made it the site of many bat-
tles over time.
Today, the tiny, boomerang-shaped island off the coast of Ballycastle is a peaceful
place and the home of thousands of seabirds, including puffins, and only about 100
people. Storytelling, song, and music flourish here, and islanders are always happy to
welcome visitors.
On the eastern end of the island is Bruce’s Cave, where the Scottish King Robert the
Bruce hid after being defeated by the English. For information on the ferry schedule,

 Exploring St. Patrick’s old haunts
T
he stars of County Down are the velvety green and purple Mourne
Mountains. The Mournes are the highest mountains in Northern
Ireland, their rounded peaks reaching over 610m (2,000 ft.). They are a
hiking and walking paradise — the mostly uninhabited mountains are
threaded with trails that run from easy riverside strolls to strenuous
boulder scrambles. This just may be the Irish and Northern Irish coun-
try landscape that you pictured before you got here, with weathered
stone walls and farmhouses, sheep gamboling in the folds of the hills,
lazy cows, windswept mountain gaps, and winding rivers. The stone
Mourne Wall, built between 1904 and 1922, connects the 15 mountain
peaks, snaking gracefully over rocky cliffs and up heather-covered
crests.
The mountains roll down to the coastal area, where tacky-though-
charming seaside towns, such as Newcastle, invite lolling on the sandy
beaches, sauntering down the street with an ice cream cone, and rattling
the bones of your traveling companions in bumper cars at the many
amusement complexes.
Northeast of the Mourne Mountains is the land of St. Patrick, the patron
saint of Ireland and Northern Ireland, who planted the first seeds of Irish
Christianity here in the fifth century. Born in Britain around A.D. 389 and
brought to Ireland as a slave, Patrick spent four years as a shepherd for
a Druid. During that time, his spiritual life flourished, and after escaping
slavery, Patrick trained for the priesthood, probably in France. He
returned to Ireland as a missionary, sure that God was directing him to
spread Christianity in the pagan land, and began the task of converting
the Irish and establishing churches. St. Patrick’s Day (Mar 17) is a holy

Counties Down and Armagh

day in much of Ireland. People attend Mass; businesses and schools
are closed; and until recently, pubs were closed, too.
South and west of County Down is little County Armagh, where the city
of Armagh is also heavily associated with St. Patrick, who built a stone
church and preached Christianity here. The city is still a religious
center, home to the seats of both the Catholic and Anglican archbish-
ops. A visit to Armagh City makes a good daytrip from County Down.

Getting to Counties Down and Armagh
The nearest airports are in Belfast, which is also the destination for fer-
ries from England and Scotland: See Chapter 22 for information on those
methods.
If you’re coming by car from Dublin, take the M1 to the N1 north to
Newry (N1 becomes the A1 in Northern Ireland). From Newry, take the
A28 to Armagh. To get to the coast from Newry, take the A2 southeast
(the A2 runs along the entire coast). If you’re driving from Ireland into
Northern Ireland, make sure you notify your rental-car company because
extra insurance may be required.
Irish Rail (% 1850-366-222; www.irishrail.ie) and Northern Ireland
Railways (% 028-90-66-66-30; www.nirailways.co.uk) serve Newry,
Portadown, Lurgan, Lisburn, Bangor, and other towns year-round.
Ulsterbus (% 028-90-66-66-30; www.ulsterbus.co.uk) travels year-
round to Newry, Portadown, Armagh City, and other major towns in
Counties Armagh and Down.
County Down
I include the reviews for Culloden Hotel, Mount Stewart House &
Gardens, and the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, which are actually
in County Down, in Chapter 22 because they are easy side trips from
Belfast, so check that chapter also.
Spending the night in County Down
Burrendale Hotel & Country Club
$$$$
Newcastle
This modern hotel is great for families. The clean, up-to-date rooms are
nothing special in the décor department, but the amenities and location
are perfect for kids. There is a nice restaurant with plenty of kid-friendly
dishes, a large indoor pool, and a hot tub. The town of Newcastle seems
made for families, with plenty of ice cream shops and amusement com-
plexes. Work off that ice cream while hiking the Mourne Mountains, walk-
ing along the sandy beaches, and visiting the two nearby parks. Golfers
will also be thrilled with the location: There are 15 courses nearby —
including one of the best on the island, Royal County Down. Check online
for the hotel’s frequent packages and deals.

Killyleagh
This charming inn is located in the shadow of Killyleagh Castle in the little
town of Killyleagh, on the road between Downpatrick and Belfast. It has
bright, comfortable rooms with beautiful wooden furniture — some rooms
even have four-poster beds. The inn is much larger than it looks from the
outside, with three pubs, a library, and a guest lounge, plus a restaurant
that features Irish cooking and occasionally hosts medieval feasts. Service
is warm and friendly.

Castlewellan
If you aren’t stirred by the setting of this lodging, restaurant, and bar com-
plex, surrounded by verdant rolling hills, you need to check your pulse.
Located where an old farmhouse used to stand, the modern inn has a
simple mountain-lodge look to it, with pine furniture, landscape prints, and
doors painted forest green. Rooms and bathrooms are ample and sparkling
clean. But it doesn’t really matter what the rooms look like when there are
trails and lanes that virtually begin at the front door, some leading to vistas
of Newcastle Bay. The cozy bar and restaurant has gorgeous views; the
food is fine as hiking fuel, but it’s nothing special. They do, however, make
a mean poached egg for breakfast.

Dining in County Down
The Duke Restaurant
$$–$$$

INTERNATIONAL/NEW IRISH
Fresh, flavorful produce is at the root of the zingy dishes served at this
busy, jovial restaurant. Main courses range from meat dishes to vegetar-
ian options, and the seafood choices, such as grilled turbot with wilted
bok choy and prawn bisque cream, are especially delicious.
Above the Duke Bar, 7 Duke St. Warrenpoint is 9.7km (6 miles) southeast of Newry,

SEAFOOD-IRISH-EUROPEAN
Lobster is, not surprisingly, the house specialty here, served three differ-
ent ways. Plenty of excellent Irish and classic European dishes are served,

but seafood is the highlight of the menu. The interior is comfortable and
casual, furnished with blond wood and warm recessed lighting. When the
weather’s nice, you can drink your aperitif in the lovely beer garden.
9–11 The Square. % 028-4488-1288. Main courses: £17–£20 ($34–$40); lobster £30/$60.
MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon to 9 p.m., Sat noon to 9:30 p.m., Sun noon to 8:30 p.m.
Mourne Seafood
$$
Newcastle
SEAFOOD-IRISH
Being by the sea always puts me in the mood for fresh seafood, and this
restaurant proved the perfect answer to my cravings. Seafood dishes
abound, from the simple (divine mussels in a white wine sauce) to the
more complex (a caramelized filet of salmon with fried crab linguini, chile,
and chorizo oil). Those who are not seafood fans should be pleased with
the steak and chicken options. The restaurant has a casually elegant feel,
with contemporary art gracing the walls and spherical red paper lamps
hanging from the ceiling. The service is exceptional.
107 Central Promenade. % 028-4372-6401. Main courses: £12–£14 ($24–
$28). MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri 11:30 a.m.–8:30 p.m., Sat–Sun 9:30 a.m.–10 p.m.
Exploring County Down
Be sure to lace those walking shoes tightly, because County Down is a
playground for nature lovers, with myriad hiking trails, all sorts of out-
door activities, and a dreamy setting of rivers, woods, and purple-green
mountains. The Down Cathedral and the Aquarium are good rainy-day
options.
The Mourne Mountains
In my opinion, the finest way to see this beautiful area is to take a hike
along one of the many trails. You can access the Mourne Mountains
along the A2, getting off at Newcastle, Kilkeel, Rostrevor, Warrenpoint, or
any other town in the area. There is also a road that passes the 15 sum-
mits of the mountains.
Be aware that the word walk is used instead of hike in Ireland and
Northern Ireland. Anything from a gentle ramble to a tough scramble
over boulders may be called a walk, so ask for specifics.
Stop by the Mourne Heritage Trust, 87 Central Promenade, Newcastle,
County Down (% 028-4372-4059; www.mournelive.com); it’s open
Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Check out their terrific Web site
before exploring the mountains. They offer all sorts of maps and infor-
mation, present a series of talks on various facets of the area, and run
guided weekend hikes. I recommend picking up the Mourne Country
Outdoor Pursuits Map, published by the Ordnance Survey of Northern
Ireland, which is a detailed topographical map that has many trails
marked. I also recommend purchasing Mourne Mountain Walks, a
packet of ten laminated cards featuring maps and detailed instructions
for ten of the area’s best hikes.
Part VI: Northern Ireland 
438

One of my favorite routes is the hike to Hare’s Gap, which takes you on
a gentle, winding path uphill, with a scramble over large boulders before
you reach the gap and a section of the graceful Mourne Wall. There are
breathtaking views of the countryside as you ascend, and Hare’s Gap is
the starting point for a number of other excellent trails that take you
higher and deeper into the mountains. Find the route at the parking lot
along Trassey Road at the northern foot of Clonachullion Hill. Turn left
upon exiting the parking lot, and you see the gate and stile that mark the
beginning of the hike. The round-trip hike should take about three and a
half hours; good shoes are essential.
Another popular trail leads from the fishing village of Kilkeel to the
parking lot at the Silent Valley Information Centre to Silent Valley, where
a section of the Mourne Wall encloses the reservoir that provides water
for the residents of County Down. You can pick the route up in Kilkeel or
join up at the parking lot in Silent Valley. The walk is easy, leading you
through woodlands and moorlands between two giant granite peaks. If
you don’t wish to walk, you can catch the shuttle bus that travels the
route between the Silent Valley Information Centre and the peak of
nearby Ben Crom Mountain daily in July and August and on weekends
May, June, and September (£1.50/$3). To get to Kilkeel, take the A2. To
get to the Information Centre parking lot, drive 6.5km (4 miles) north of
Kilkeel on Head Road. The Silent Valley Information Centre number is
% 028-9074-1166, and the center and grounds are open daily Easter
through September from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and October through
Easter from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Castlewellan
This 460-hectare (1,137-acre) wooded park just begs you to stroll around,

Don’t miss the Peace Maze, the longest and largest hedge maze in the
world. Give yourself lots of time — I was in there for a couple of hours.
The Grange Coffee House is a sweet little spot for a light lunch and sells
heavenly bite-size apple tarts. There is an area for tent campers and for

St. Patrick’s Grave and Down Cathedral
Downpatrick
Sitting atop the Hill of Down is Down Cathedral, a small and austere church
built in the 18th and 19th centuries in the style of its 13th- and 16th-century
predecessors (buildings of religious significance have stood here for the
past 1,800 years). Legend has it that the little churchyard here contains the
remains of Ireland’s patron saint, St. Patrick. A rock slab with the word Patric
across it marks the spot. To find out more about St. Patrick and the inter-
esting history of this area, walk over to the Down County Museum, on the
Mall in Downpatrick (% 028-4461-5218), open Monday through Friday from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 1 to 5 p.m. (free admission).

Grace Neill’s Inn
Donaghadee
Many pubs claim to be the oldest in Ireland, but this one really is. Don’t
believe me? The Guinness Book of World Records says so, and those people
know their pubs. The old part of the tavern practically defines what an
Irish pub should look like, and even though it’s been extended to include
a lounge and conservatory, the whole place keeps the old-school style.
The pub grub here is great.

County Armagh
Tiny County Armagh packs a historical punch, containing the royal, pre-
Christian Navan Fort as well as several sights associated with St. Patrick.
The attractions in Armagh City are easily seen in a morning or afternoon,
so I don’t include accommodations or dining options.
Exploring County Armagh
Navan Fort
Armagh
Located just outside the city of Armagh, Navan Fort once pulsed with pre-
Christian religious and royal activity. In myth, it is said that legendary
Queen Macha had her palace here and that the great warrior Cuchulainn
housed his armies here. Only mounds remain today.
The Navan Centre, 81 Killylea Rd., 3km (2 miles) west of Armagh on A28. % 028-90-
56-9584. There is open access to the site year-round (the visitor center is open
June–Aug Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun noon to 5 p.m.; Apr–May and Sept Sat 10
a.m.–5 p.m., Sun noon to 5 p.m. Suggested visit: 30 minutes.
St. Patrick’s Trian
Armagh
This attraction presents the rich religious and secular history of Armagh.
Engaging exhibits relate the story of Armagh’s earliest roots; the history
of St. Patrick, who chose to base himself in Armagh while preaching
Christianity; and the tale of Gulliver’s Travels, featuring a giant figure of
Gulliver among tiny Lilliputians (this part of the display may seem a little
random until you know that Jonathan Swift spent time in Armagh). The
museum also displays the Book of Armagh, written in A.D. 807 and linked
with St. Patrick. This is a good place to get a sense of what you’d like to see
in town, including St. Patrick’s Cathedral (Church of Ireland), located in
Cathedral Close (% 028-3752-3142) and St. Patrick’s Cathedral (Roman
Catholic), located on Cathedral Rd. (% 028-3752-2802).

that you shouldn’t miss, from home-baked brown bread to
Guinness.

T
hough most Irish cities now offer everything from sushi to margaritas,
you’ll have no trouble finding these quintessential delicious Irish
dishes and beverages.
Apple and Rhubarb Tarts
The world would be a happier (and plumper) place if everyone sat down
a few days a week to a rhubarb or apple tart, served with a cool dollop
of fresh cream.
Brown Bread
Earthy wheaten brown bread is the perfect vehicle for creamy fresh Irish
butter, as well as the ideal implement for scooping up the dregs of your
soup or stew.
Guinness
Does the thick black stuff really need an introduction? See Chapter 2 for
more about the lifeblood of Ireland.
Hard Cider
Sweet and refreshing, a glass or pint of cider is the perfect way to cool
down on a warm, lazy evening.

Irish Breakfast
You won’t need lunch after chowing down on a traditional Irish breakfast.
In its most complete form, the Irish breakfast in the Republic features
bacon, eggs, sausages, fried tomatoes, fried mushrooms, black pudding
(a sausage that gets its color from pig’s or cow’s blood), and white pud-
ding (another sausage, but without the blood). You may also find baked
beans staring up at you from the plate. In the North, the traditional break-
fast plate (called an Ulster Fry) boasts two kinds of breads — soda bread
and potato bread — in addition to everything else.
Irish Farmhouse Cheeses
Smoky Gubbeen cheese from County Cork, creamy Cashel blue cheese,
all kinds of goat cheese (many pubs serve it fried — yum!) — I could go
on and on. . . .
Irish Stew
The cornerstones of hearty, stick-to-your-ribs Irish stew are juicy pieces
of lamb, cubed potatoes, and onions, but you could spend a lifetime cata-
loging the subtle variations in recipes across the country — a sprinkling
of parsley in this pub, a handful of carrots in that restaurant, and so on.
Irish Whiskey
Irish whiskey is different from Scotch whisky in several ways. The malt
barley for Scotch is dried using peat smoke, but the malt barley used in
Irish whiskey is dried in a warm closed oven, preserving the integrity of
the barley flavor. In addition, Irish whiskey is distilled three times, giving
it a smoothness that connoisseurs claim is unrivaled.
Potatoes (and Curry Chips)
It wouldn’t be a book about Ireland without mention of the humble tuber
that served as a staple on the island for centuries. The Irish have crea-
ted a number of delicious potato-based dishes, including champ (pota-
toes mashed with milk and green onions or leeks) and boxty (grilled
potato pancakes). My favorite potato-related dish is chips (french fries)
dipped in curry sauce, available at many fish and chip shops.
Seafood
The Irish have embraced the fact that they are surrounded by waters
rife with delicious creatures. The shellfish is spectacular, and the catch
of the day is sure to be delicious (I have developed a love for brill). A
standout is Irish salmon — you can find it in a variety of forms, from
simple smoked slices to moist filets bathed in dazzling sauces.

The Top Ten Items
to Buy in Ireland
In This Chapter
 Warming up with an Irish sweater
 Figuring out Irish clothing and shoe sizes
 Purchasing an Irish musical instrument
 Discovering Ireland’s vast pottery offerings
S
ure, a handful of travelers come back from their trip with nothing
more than a few rolls of film and a notebook full of observations and
sketches, but most people are a bit more acquisitive than that. Ireland is
a wonderful place to indulge your inner shopper, offering a plethora of
items (many handmade) that are uniquely Irish.
China
The Belleek Factory, in Northern Ireland, produces wafer-thin porcelain
pieces, often decorated with small painted shamrocks or flowers. You
can find Belleek pottery all over Ireland, but the Belleek Factory is a
force to be reckoned with, selling the entire line of pottery and some
unique factory-only items (see Chapter 21).
Crystal
Ireland makes some of the world’s finest crystal — pieces that seem to
glow and sparkle from within. If Waterford Crystal is on your to-buy list,
head to the Waterford Crystal Factory (see Chapter 14) for the widest
selection. Don’t dismiss the lesser-know crystal factories; some of them
produce crystal that is just as beautiful as Waterford.

Irish Whiskey
Just think: You can sit back and sip the smooth water of life while recall-
ing your trip to Ireland. If you get to the Old Jameson Distillery (see
Chapter 11), you can even have a bottle personalized. Whiskey fudge
makes the perfect thank-you present for dog-sitters and plant-waterers.
Jewelry
Ireland is home to numerous talented silversmiths and goldsmiths, many
of whom incorporate ancient Celtic motifs into their designs. One of the
most popular souvenirs from Ireland is the Claddagh ring — a ring with
two hands clasping a heart that’s topped with a crown. Thomas Dillon’s,
in Galway (see Chapter 18), is one of the best places to find one.
Lace
In the 1860s, poor Clare nuns in Kenmare began teaching local girls to
make lace in hopes of helping the struggling economy. The beautiful
needlepoint lace is now famous worldwide. In Kenmare, hit The White
Room for a huge selection (see Chapter 16).
Linen
You can find the famous snow-white Irish linen in all sorts of forms, from
tablecloths to bed sheets to summer dresses.
Musical Instruments
I can’t think of a better souvenir from Ireland than a tin whistle. It’s inex-
pensive, truly Irish, easy to bring home on the airplane, and relatively
easy to play (buy a tutor book or tape along with it). If you are more of
the percussive type, you may want to look into buying a bodhrán, the
ancient goatskin frame drum. Roundstone Musical Instruments (in
Chapter 18) is the place for bodhrán-hunters, while Custy’s Traditional
Music Shop (in Chapter 17) sells all sorts of instruments, from fiddles to
concertinas.
Pottery
It seems that every road in Ireland bears a sign pointing to a pottery
studio. And the amazing thing is that the pieces at most of these places
are of the highest quality. Design runs the gamut from the country-style
painted pottery of Nicholas Mosse (see Chapter 14) to unglazed modern
pieces.
Part VII: The Part of Tens

Sweaters
You can thank all those sheep for Ireland’s beautiful sweaters. There is a
breathtaking range of offerings, from chic cashmere turtlenecks to thick
oatmeal-colored Aran sweaters. Check the label to determine whether
the sweater was handweaved.
Tweed
Like those battered tweed hats that many farmers wear? You can find
them all over Ireland, along with tweed jackets and suits. If you’re
searching for the perfect tweed, you may want to head up to County
Donegal, the birthplace of the famous Donegal tweed, where you’ll find
tweed-heaven at Magee of Donegal (see Chapter 20).
Chapter 25: The Top Ten Items to Buy in Ireland 451
Irish clothing sizes
The United States and Ireland have different systems for measurements (except for
men’s shirt and suit sizes, which are the same in both countries). Use the following
charts only as guides to steer you toward a near fit — sizes can vary among manu-
facturers and from store to store.

Dentists and Doctors
If you need to see a dentist or physician,
ask the concierge or host at your hotel or
guesthouse for a recommendation.

Otherwise, consult the Golden Pages of
the Irish telephone book or the Yellow
Pages of the Northern Ireland telephone
book, or contact your local consulate for a
recommendation. Many emergency rooms
have walk-in clinics. Expect to pay for
treatment up front and to be reimbursed by
your insurance company after the fact.
Driving
You must have a valid driver’s license from
your home country to drive in Ireland. The
speed limit in the Republic is 120kmph (75
mph) on motorways and 100kmph (60 mph)
on open nonurban roads. Speed-limit signs
have a red circle with the limit written
inside in black. In Northern Ireland, the
speed limit on motorways is 113kmph (70
mph) while the speed limit on other roads
is 100kmph (60 mph).
The Irish drive on the left side of the road.
For more on driving in Ireland, turn to
Chapter 7.
Drugstores
Drugstores are usually called chemists or
pharmacies. Look under “Chemists —
Pharmaceutical” in the Golden Pages of
the Irish telephone book or “Chemists —
Dispensing” in the Yellow Pages of the
Northern Ireland telephone book.
Pack prescription medications (in their
original-label vials) in your carry-on lug-
gage. Bring along copies of your prescrip-
tions, in generic form rather than under a
brand name, in case you need to get a refill.
Electricity
The standard electrical current is 220 volts
in the Republic of Ireland and 250 volts in
Northern Ireland. The Republic and
Northern Ireland use three-pronged plugs.
If you bring non-Irish appliances, you need
both a transformer and a plug adapter
(available at many hardware stores and 
sometimes airports). Many new laptops
have built-in transformers, so check before
you buy one.
Embassies and Consulates
The American Embassy is at 42 Elgin Rd.,
Ballsbridge, Dublin 4 (% 01-668-8777); the
American Consulate is at 14 Queen St.,
Belfast BT1 6EQ (% 028-9032-8239). The
Canadian Embassy is at 7–8 Wilton Terrace,
Dublin 2 (% 01-234-4000); the British
Embassy is at 29 Merrion Rd., Dublin 4 
(% 01-205-3700); and you can find the
Australian Embassy at Fitzwilton House,
Wilton Terrace, Dublin 2 (% 01-664-5300).
Emergencies
For the Garda (police), fire, ambulance, or
other emergencies, dial % 999.
Information
See “Where to Get More Information,”
later in this appendix.
Internet Access and Cybercafes
Cybercafes and library Internet access, in
addition to Wi-Fi access, are all over
Ireland. Check the Fast Facts section of
each destination chapter.
Liquor Laws
You must be 18 or older to be served alco-
holic beverages. You can purchase alco-
holic beverages by the bottle at liquor
stores, pubs displaying off-license signs,
and most supermarkets. Ireland has very
severe laws and penalties regarding driv-
ing while intoxicated.
Maps
If you’re driving, a good driving map is
essential. My favorite is the Ordnance
Survey Ireland’s Ireland Touring Map.
Other great choices are Collins Maps, AA
Maps, and Philip’s Maps. For local maps,
the tourism or visitors’ offices in each area
are your best bet.
Ireland For Dummies, 5th Edition 
454

Police
A law enforcement officer is called a garda
or guard; in the plural, it’s gardai (pro-
nounced gar-dee) or simply the guards.
Dial % 999 in an emergency in both the
Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Post Office
Post offices in the Republic are called An
Post (www.anpost.ie for general infor-
mation) and are easy to spot: Look for a
bright-green storefront with the name
across it. Ireland’s main postal branch, the
General Post Office (GPO), is on O’Connell
Street (% 01-705-8600), in the heart of
Dublin. From the Republic, mailing an air-
mail letter or postcard to North America
costs .82 ($1.30).
In Northern Ireland, post offices are called
Post Offices, and the offices and post
boxes are bright red. The main post office
in Belfast is located at Castle Junction, at
the top of High Street (% 08457-223344 for
information). The cost to send a letter to
North America starts at 50p ($1).
Restrooms
Public restrooms are usually called toilets
and marked with international symbols.
Some toilets use the Gaelic words fir (men)
and mna (women). Gas stations normally
do not have public toilets.
Safety
For many years, violent crimes in Ireland
were rare. Unfortunately, that seems to be
changing. Though Ireland’s large cities are
still generally safer than those in the
United States, reasonable precautions are
needed. It is a good idea to take a taxi
back to your hotel after pubs close, espe-
cially in Dublin, and be on the alert in
deserted areas at night. In addition, leave
your passport and other important docu-
ments in your hotel room, always lock car
doors, and don’t carry loads of cash. If you
want more detailed information on safety,
pick up the brochure A Short Guide to
Tourist Security, published by the Garda
(police) and available at most tourist
offices in the Republic. Thankfully, political
violence has been on the wane in Northern
Ireland since the Good Friday Agreement
in 1998 and has practically ceased since
the IRA (Irish Republican Army) decommis-
sioned their weapons in 2005. For up-to-
date safety recommendations for Northern
Ireland, check the U.S. Department of
State Travel Warning section at
http://travel.state.gov.
Smoking
In the Republic and in Northern Ireland
smoking is banned in pubs, restaurants,
clubs, stores, public transportation, and
taxis. Some B&Bs and smaller guest-
houses do not allow smoking; check
before making a reservation.
Taxes
Sales tax is called value-added tax (VAT)
and is often already included in the price
quoted to you or shown on price tags. In
the Republic, VAT rates vary — for hotels,
restaurants, and car rentals, it’s 13.5 per-
cent; for souvenirs and gifts, it’s 21 per-
cent. In Northern Ireland, the VAT is 17.5
percent across the board.
Travelers can have their VAT refunded for
souvenir purchases. For information on
VAT refunds, see Chapter 5. If you choose
to ship items directly home from the store,
your purchase is automatically VAT-free.
Telephone
To call Ireland from anywhere in the world,
dial the international access code (011
from the United States and Canada, 0011
from Australia, and 00 from the United
Kingdom and New Zealand) and then the
country code (Ireland is 353; Northern
Ireland is 44), followed by the city code
Appendix: Quick Concierge 455

without the initial zero (for example, you
dial 1 for the Dublin city code, even though
it is listed in this book as 01) and the
number. Two exceptions: When calling
Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom,
dial 028 and the local eight-digit number.
When calling Northern Ireland from the
Republic, replace the 028 prefix with 048.
Public phones in Ireland take coins or
cards. To make a phone call from a card
phone, you must purchase a callcard in the
Republic or a phonecard in Northern
Ireland. Both types of cards are available
at post offices and newsagents.
To call locally in the Republic of Ireland
and Northern Ireland, just dial the number
direct. You need to include the city code
when calling from town to town in the
Republic; in Northern Ireland, you can just
dial the eight-digit local number.
As mentioned before, to call Northern
Ireland from the Republic, omit the country
code and dial 048 and then the local eight-
digit number. To call the Republic from
Northern Ireland, dial 00-353 and then the
city code and number.
To make international direct calls from the
Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland,
dial the international access code (00), fol-
lowed by the country code (1 for the United
States and Canada, 44 for the United
Kingdom, 61 for Australia, and 64 for New
Zealand), the area or city code, and then
the local number. So, to call the U.S.
number 718-000-0000, you’d dial 00-1-
718-000-0000.
From the Republic of Ireland, dial % 11818
for international directory assistance and
% 114 for operator assistance with inter-
national calls. From Northern Ireland, dial
% 153 for international directory assis-
tance and % 155 for operator assistance
with international calls. For local operator
assistance in Ireland, dial % 10 in the
Republic and % 100 in Northern Ireland.
From the United States, the (toll) number to
call for directory assistance is % 00353-
91-770220.
Calling-card access phone numbers are as
follows: In the Republic of Ireland, call 
% 1800-55-0000 for AT&T, % 1800-55-1001
for MCI, and % 1800-55-2001 for Sprint. In
Northern Ireland, call % 0500-89-0011 for
AT&T, % 0800-279-5088 for MCI, and 
% 0800-89-0877 for Sprint.
If you plan to call home a lot while in
Ireland, you may want to open an account
with Swiftcall (toll-free in Ireland % 0800-
929-224; www.swiftcall.com). Its rates
offer you considerable savings, not only
from Ireland to the United States but vice
versa.
If you know that you will have Internet
access, you may also want to check out
SKYPE (www.skype.com), an Internet-
based phone service.
Time Zone
Ireland is five time zones ahead of the
eastern United States (when it’s noon in
New York, it’s 5 p.m. in Ireland). Ireland
observes daylight saving time.
Tipping
For porters or bellhops, tip 1 ($1.20) per
piece of luggage. For taxi drivers, hair-
dressers, and other providers of service,
tip an average of 10 percent to 15 percent.
Tip at least 10 percent or 15 percent at a
restaurant. However, check to see
whether a service charge (10 percent) has
been added to the bill before paying. If the
service charge has been added, you may
want to round up the amount to 15 percent
if you received good service.
Ireland For Dummies, 5th Edition 
456

It is not customary to tip bartenders at
pubs. For waiter service at a bar, leave
about 1 ($1.20).
