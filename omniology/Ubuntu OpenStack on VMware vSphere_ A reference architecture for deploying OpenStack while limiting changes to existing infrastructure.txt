TECHNICAL WHITE PAPER
Ubuntu OpenStack on VMware vSphere:
A reference architecture for deploying 
OpenStack while limiting changes 
to existing infrastructure
A collaboration between Canonical and VMware
March 2014

01  09
Summary

Canonical, the Ubuntu and OpenStack experts, and VMware, the virtualization 
experts, have combined their collective experience in customer facing 
deployments. The team has built a series of reference architectures to help 
customers explore the benefits of OpenStack within their data centers. 
The reference architecture in this paper is intended for organizations with 
existing VMware data center deployments or expertise who want to limit 
changes to their underlying VMware infrastructure, but see benefits in 
a common abstraction and orchestration layer via OpenStack open APIs 
and Dashboard to control compute workloads.

UBUNTU OPENSTACK PLUS VMWARE – A PERFECT MATCH IN THE EVOLUTION 
OF THE DATA CENTER
Organizations strive for increased operational efficiency and agility within their 
data centers which is why the old methodology of a single server per application 
evolved into server virtualization. This technology helped reduce data center 
hardware sprawl by consolidating multiple workloads per server resulting 
in higher hardware utilization. Prior to virtualization, the procurement, racking, 
stacking, provisioning, and networking of hardware generated overhead and 
took time. VMware quickly established itself as the leader in this space with 
a range of solutions to suit different organizations’ needs. 
As the server virtualization footprint grew, organizations began to segregate 
and tailor deployments to various hypervisor stacks depending on cost, test 
and development workloads versus production deployments, compliance, etc. 
This led to virtual machine (VM) sprawl and it became difficult to manage and 
scale applications running across the different hypervisors, servers, brands, etc. 
The advent of “cloud computing”, especially private clouds, promised to alleviate 
this problem by creating a coherent environment that is easier to manage and 
scale. The OpenStack project is one of the prime examples in this area.
OpenStack is an open source computing platform for public and private clouds. 
It is one of the largest and fastest growing open source projects to date. 
OpenStack takes a set of heterogenous and isolated hypervisors (i.e. KVM, ESXi, 
Xen, LXC), storage and networks across a data center or multiple data centers 
and turns them into pools of resources. All managed and consumed via open 
APIs and a web-based dashboard. Ubuntu quickly established itself as the 
reference platform to develop and deploy OpenStack. And Canonical, 
the commercial sponsor of Ubuntu and platinum member of the OpenStack 
project, became the leader in helping organizations adopt and deploy 
Ubuntu OpenStack as their public or private cloud technology. VMware joined 
the OpenStack project as a gold member in 2012 and announced a collaborative 
partnership with Canonical in 2013. The goal of this partnership was to aid 
organizations in their adoption of OpenStack, especially in combining it with 
their existing VMware infrastructure. 
OpenStack as a control layer above pools of resources in the data center has 
benefits; however, organizations have heavy investments both financially and 
in staff technical competency with established VMware technologies, so how 
can they reap the benefits of a next generation cloud platform in OpenStack, 
while still getting the best out of their existing VMware hypervisor base? 
What’s the best approach to educate their staff on OpenStack? OpenStack APIs 
allow users to customize and configure down to the network level and VMware 
NSX is one of the most advanced and feature rich SDN solutions available today 
working seamlessly with OpenStack, ESXi and KVM, but how can this be done 
without major disruptions? What changes are needed to applications to achieve 
an “open cloud” using multiple hypervisors i.e. KVM for web tier apps and 
VMware ESXi for more heavyweight backend applications?

03  09
Given the above pressures and scenarios organizations face in their adoption of 
OpenStack, VMware and Canonical created a collection of OpenStack migration 
best practices based on our experiences together in the field. A high-level overview 
of OpenStack migration options is given below, from the least to most “invasive”:
1.  Maintain the existing VMware vCenter technology stack and deploy 
OpenStack services as VMs running on top of VMware’s ESXi hypervisor. 
To minimize changes to the established VMware infrastructure even further, 
deploy OpenStack nova-network rather than OpenStack Neutron with 
an SDN. This allows organizations to familiarize and educate themselves 
on OpenStack (APIs) while maintaining a consistent and known infrastructure. 
This environment is for proof of concept only.
2.  Run OpenStack control services as hosts within VMware vCenter, but offer 
OpenStack compute options on multiple hypervisors, e.g. KVM and ESXi. 
Implement VMware NSX as the SDN for a richer network topology. Use 
OpenStack regions or host aggregates to allow users the choose which 
compute hypervisor to deploy their workload on. In this approach, developers 
learn to make their workloads/applications hypervisor-agnostic by moving 
from failover to fault resistant “cloud oriented” designs. The data center 
infrastructure changes are minimally invasive. 
3.  Deploy OpenStack control services on bare-metal hardware or on an open 
source hypervisor such as KVM. Allow for multiple hypervisors (KVM, VMware 
ESXi, Xen, etc.) for OpenStack compute services and run VMware NSX as the 
SDN solution. This design encourages vendor diversity within the data center 
and turns a heterogeneous set of hypervisors, storage and network options 
into pools of resources available and configured on-demand.     
In the next sections, we will outline the reference architecture specific to 
migration option number one. This migration option contains our recommended 
configuration, design, and implementation path matching real-world deployments

KEY ELEMENTS OF REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE

VMware vSphere Design 
OVERVIEW
The OpenStack components are installed as Virtual Machines in a vSphere Cluster. 
This approach provides the following benefits:
• High availability via vSphere HA
• Better use of the hardware
• Flexibility to scale up and scale out easily as required
• Flexibility to adjust the specifications of each component ( RAM, Disk, vCPU, etc. )
• Faster deployment times

Design Notes:
• A floating network (not shown) is optional
• Each vSphere cluster is associated with a nova-compute. One cannot map 
multiple clusters to the same nova-compute, otherwise the clusters would get 
merged to look like a single hypervisor thereby removing the option of having 
clusters in different OpenStack availability zones
• This setup allows for one nova service and one nova.conf for both clusters 
and each is represented as a separate nova-compute hypervisor instance 
to the OpenStack Nova scheduler
• As of this writing, using one nova.conf for both clusters is not recommended 
since there is no established method to define clusters into individual 
OpenStack availability zones.
• OpenStack component HA is achieved via Juju and Metal-as-a-Service (MAAS) 
• OpenStack services shown in the Management Cluster can be distributed 
to other clusters depending on resource availability (not shown)

VMWARE ESXI HYPERVISORS
Network 
OVERVIEW
Virtual networks exist to attach the VMs vNICs to the right physical networks. 
These are the vSphere networks for the environment:
In this design, OpenStack Havana is implemented with nova-network. 
OpenStack Neutron plus VMware NSX would be a recommended next step, 
but was not selected in this design.

DHCP AND DNS FOR THE OPENSTACK COMPONENTS
MAAS dynamically manages DHCP and DNS for all the OpenStack nodes using 
the Management Network.
The MAAS node will also provide the Ubuntu Precise 12.04 LTS base images 
to the VMs in the Ubuntu Cloud via PXE boot through the same network.

MANAGEMENT NETWORK ISOLATION
This design consists of one main network called the Management Network. 
Depending on your network configuration, you can connect a cloud portal 
or clients to this network to access the OpenStack APIs from other networks 
via routing. 
For security reasons this network should be isolated and only accessible 
from trusted services like a portal or a management client machine.
Because this design is entirely on top of VMware vSphere running nova-
network, OpenStack security groups are not available. As of this writing, 
OpenStack compute security group functionality is only achievable 
on vSphere when used in combination with VMware NSX SDN solution.

Storage 
Each availability zone should have a Tier 2 SAN with sufficient resources for the 
planned workload available to be distributed via vSphere datastores to each 
vSphere cluster.
Notes:
• The vSphere datastores used for the instances should not be used for any 
other purpose
• Disconnect any other datastore from the ESXi hosts not to be used for the 
instances: http://docs.openstack.org/havana/config-reference/content/
vmware.html

OPENSTACK INSTANCES STORAGE
The OpenStack Instances are stored in a dedicated vSphere datastore. 

BLOCK STORAGE WITH CINDER USING THE VMWARE DRIVER
OpenStack Cinder is handled using the VMware driver released with OpenStack 
Havana. Note: The current Cinder Juju Charm needs manual configuration after 
deployment to set up the VMware driver. 

OBJECT STORAGE WITH CEPH RADOS GATEWAY
A minimal configuration of Object Storage is needed to deploy OpenStack 
instances via Juju. For that purpose Ceph RADOS Gateway will be deployed 
with a default configuration in 3 VMs.
Ceph RADOS Gateway will frontend the stored images and OpenStack Glance 
will point to it.

08  09
VM Specification
The recommended specs for the Ceph VMs:

VM IMAGE STORAGE
The storage of the VM templates (images) is handled by the OpenStack Glance. 
Glance provides multi-tenant image storage services for an OpenStack deployment.
In this design, to maximise availability of the images, Object Storage with 
Ceph RADOS Gateway will be used.

CONCLUSION
This OpenStack reference architecture provides a common abstraction and 
orchestration layer via OpenStack open APIs and Dashboard to control compute 
workloads while limiting changes to pre-existing VMware infrastructure. 
This approach allows organizations to extend the ROI of their infrastructure 
investment while developing and enhancing employees’ skills around a next 
generation platform in OpenStack. The cost saving extends further as teams 
understand the OpenStack paradigm enough to determine which workloads/
applications should remain legacy and which ones be upgraded to cloud centric 
fault tolerant designs early in the infrastructure migration process.
