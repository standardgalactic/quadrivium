Introduction
“Contribution Metrics” evolved from a consulting outreach to a printing 
business experiencing problems. As a professor of management accounting 
with a consulting background, I thought it would provide an excellent case 
study for third-year students. The successful outcome, the extent of which 
surprised both the business owner and myself, led to a new and startlingly 
simple way of improving profitability.  
Recognizing the benefits of this new concept, which over time became known 
as Contribution-Based Activity (CBA), accounting practices attended my 
short courses and conducted client-seminars and client workshops to get the 
message across. Clients ranged from sole proprietorships to multinationals, 
and size made little difference to the outcomes. 
“I can see that I am really in the business of selling time, and product happens 
to be the output,” exclaimed one proprietor following a pricing review of his 
product range. He was right. The review showed that although he paid for 
20,000 hours of potential activity, only 10,000 hours or 50% could be traced 
to output. Quite clearly, the leakage was adversely affecting the bottom line.
Lying at the core of any business, small or large, retail or nonretail, units 
of time-related output are inextricably linked to the financial outcome. Yet 
financial statements make no reference to units of output such as the number 
of billed production hours in manufacturing, or the number of sales in retail, 
or the meals (covers) in a restaurant, and so forth. 
As this book goes to print, there is still no seamless connection between a 
sale and its related units of activity as recorded in financial accounts. As a 
result, while some decision-makers may be confident of a profit when pricing 
or quoting a job or a product, comparatively few will know the cumulative 
extent of gaps between jobs or the resulting impact on their bottom line. 
It is extraordinary to realize that despite the latest available software 
technology, few businesses can seamlessly compare output with input to 
identify their level of productivity without time-consuming analysis. And as 
we all know, what isn’t known is unlikely to be improved.
The dynamic change that boosted the bottom line in the printing business 
flowed from linking the gross profit contribution of a sale to the relevant 
units of activity and tracking the cumulative results against target. Simple 
though the concept was and still is, my experience over the ensuing years

Introduction 
has shown that its very simplicity can inhibit comprehension and obscure the 
dynamism of its impact. In particular, for those who specialize in financial and 
management accounting, the concept invariably needs time to sink in. 
One public accountant in particular comes to mind. He arranged a seminar 
at which I addressed about 100 of his clients. This was followed by a several 
days of interviews to get his clients up and running with CBA. Two years 
later, he suddenly appeared out of the blue shouting, “I’ve got it, damn it, 
I’ve got it!”
This book has been written in the hope that businesses everywhere will 
“get it” and in doing so relieve a sizable chunk of the stress on owners, 
management, and staff that presses unceasingly from all sides.

Background to 
Contribution-
Based Activity 
(CBA)
CBA grew out of the need for business to keep 
the forest in view while working “flat-out” 
down in the trees.
The accounting section of ABCo finalizes an $8,000 invoice for Job 143. 
Because the job has taken longer than expected, management discounts the 
bill 5% before sending an invoice for $7,600 to the customer.
Unknown to management, which considers the business to be running “flat-
out,” productivity is running at the rate of 15,000 billable hours and not the 
planned 20,000 hours required to achieve the output upon which so much 
depends. The business is heading for a shortfall of $250,000.

That ignorance of such key positional information can come about in a com-
pany equipped with the latest commercial software and professionally quali-
fied personnel is the story underlying the struggle for survival and growth that 
pervades all categories of business, whether it be manufacturing, service, retail, 
hospitality, transport, and not least, the professions.
My early belief that all a business needed to stay on track was a monthly finan-
cial and management report, a cash-flow report, and a few Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs) turned out to be the great deception.
It is also the story underlying Contribution-Based Activity.1
The Problem
In the decade following the late 1960s, small and medium-sized businesses,2 
known collectively as SMEs, represented over 94% of all businesses and con-
tributed over 50% of the gross domestic product. However, references to 
SMEs in management literature, which flowed mainly from the United States, 
were embryonic and sparse.
Academia, attempting to pinpoint the nature and extent of this “new phe-
nomenon,” attended national and international conferences, presented papers, 
made observations, claimed sightings, extrapolated data from voluminous 
surveys, and hypothesized about perceived needs. Despite opposition from 
within, a few brave university faculties grudgingly permitted the inclusion of an 
SME subject or two as part of a business or economics course.
Government interest also gathered momentum, and international missions 
were established to define the problems and prescribe solutions. Extensive 
reports revealed that in essence, SMEs wanted cheaper, more readily avail-
able finance by way of loan or equity, less union interference and government 
regulation, and a restriction on monopoly competition.
Accepting the findings as the real rather than perceived needs, and recognizing 
the importance of the SMEs to the economy, business advisory agencies were 
established to address the needs of this sector.
Textbooks on SMEs filtered into the marketplace covering the same func-
tional areas of business that applied to large corporations, such as marketing, 
production, personnel, and finance, the essential difference being they were 
slimmer publications. The needs of SMEs were considered to be the same as 
big business, but smaller.
1Contribution-Based Activity (CBA) has application for all segments of industry and 
commerce, including manufacturing, service, professions, wholesale/retail, hospitality, 
transport, construction, and primary industry.
2Reference to small and medium enterprises is not intended to exclude large enterprises, 
which invariably commence as SMEs.

Improving Profit

Nowhere was this more the case than with subjects related to accounting, 
where a sole-proprietor firm employing a staff of five would be advised to 
establish and monitor costs and prices along precisely the same principles as 
a multi-staffed, multi-departmentalized, publicly listed corporate firm.
So ingrained was this attitude, that in the early 1980s, those in the accounting 
profession aware of the existence of SMEs advocated the solution as requiring 
more profit-and-loss statements to back up the annual statutory return for 
tax purposes.3
Monthly or quarterly profit-and-loss statements, however, were presented 
in exactly the same format as the annual statement. There were no budget 
columns against which actual results could be compared; no gross profit or 
expense percentages against sales, and no useful ratios or KPIs.
As the 1980s progressed, budget columns made their appearance, and in the 
1990s certain ratios and other statistical data were added. Little else has 
changed except the sheer volume of information output, which had multiplied 
a hundredfold in computer printouts.
Even so, for the cash-driven proprietor of a typical SME, struggling to pay 
wages, contain the demands of creditors, appease the bank manager, balance 
the inventory, handle complaints, improve market share, impart direction, and 
sustain morale at work and at home, the monthly or quarterly profit-and-loss 
statement went unread into the same drawer as the annual statement.
For accountants, consultants, and others involved at the coalface, shop floor, 
or office working with SMEs, it became increasingly obvious that there had to 
be a better way of serving their needs than by simply providing smaller doses 
of the medicine prescribed for large corporates.
The traditional accounting approach to diagnosis called for an in-depth analy-
sis of historical data as a basis for prescribing improvement or change. Yet the 
historical data of most SMEs, if available at all, was fragmentary, unreliable, and 
out of date. There was also the question of costs, coupled with a defensive 
attitude about using “management advisers” prevalent in all businesses, small 
or large.4
The solution to tackling the needs of SMEs of necessity had to be different 
from that applicable to their big brothers. Diagnosis of problems would need 
to flow from data extracted in such a way that the very process of extraction 
would itself provide insight for proprietor and staff.
3I confess to being one of the leading advocates of such an approach at the time!
4The defensive attitude toward using consultants was largely broken down in the corporates 
after decades of marketing by the McKinseys of the world, to the point where the first call 
by CEOs needing to resolve a burdensome problem is now to a consultant.

For those seriously involved in the search for a workable solution, there 
were many times when it seemed as elusive as the proverbial needle in the 
haystack.
The Solution
A breakthrough came when the manager of a printing firm asked for help. 
He couldn’t understand why, after he marked up every job by 25% to make a 
profit, the business never made more than 5% at the end of a year.
He was pricing jobs in line with traditional accounting methodology contained 
in the Printing and Allied Trades Manual, where all expenses are distributed to 
“cost centers” according to a well-established procedure.
For example, the cost of printing carried out on, say, the Heidelberg printing 
press would include a cost to cover the need for future replacement, a cost 
to cover its share of the rent of the building based on the space allocated for 
its use, a cost to cover the electric power to run it, and a cost for wages of 
the printer operating the unit.
These costs were referred to as “direct” costs because they could be traced 
to the machine itself; they would make up around 40% of the eventual cost 
for work carried out on the Heidelberg. The remaining 60%, known as “indi-
rect” costs, were added to cover “overhead” costs involved in supervision, 
marketing, distribution, administration, and finance. Both direct and indirect 
costs would be allocated in proportion to the planned operating hours of the 
machine, a process repeated for other cost centers such as compositing, bind-
ing, cutting, packaging, and shipping.
A similar methodology with minor variations applied across businesses 
engaged in manufacturing, trades, and service, where percentages were added 
to the cost of purchases and wages to cover indirect overheads, plus another 
percentage to cover profit. Whatever the method, the final outcome theoreti-
cally depended on the level of billable activity.5
This system of costing and pricing, although correct in theory, failed in  
practice. Individual jobs, priced in the office, routed into production, and  
eventually invoiced out, were captured in the financial accounting system as 
sales and printed out as such in the period profit-and-loss statements. While 
in theory the production hours underpinning the sales were accumulated in  
5While the focus here is on production-hours, billable units of activity can refer to a 
production-hour, an invoiced sale, a cash ring-up in retailing, a bed-night in a hotel/motel, 
a meal in a restaurant (called a cover in the industry), a ton/mile in transport, and so forth. 
Of the numerous activities occurring in business, the billable unit is fundamental to the 
activity of the rest.

“management accounts,” there was—and is—no seamless connection between 
hours billed and invoiced sales.
Pricing on the basis that 10,000 hours would be billable, when the actual billing 
was closer to 5,000 hours, meant the business was unknowingly heading for 
the rocks, unhelped by financial statements arriving two or three weeks into 
the following period and providing no information about the units of activity 
billed or planned, upon which pricing was based.
This was the reason the printer ended up with the equivalent of 3 hours of 
output for every 8-hour day.
As far as the printer was concerned, the noise of one or more printing 
machines chattering away in the distance, in conjunction with multiple phone 
calls, questions to be resolved, wages to be paid, cash to be collected, and any 
number of decisions required, meant the business was flat-out.6
At the time of the printer’s cry for help, we were unaware of any fast-track 
approach to determining the level of output, so we put time checks on the 
machines and found they were operating for less than 3 hours a day, compared 
with a planned 5.5 hours.
It was at that point I came to realize that what I had been teaching and advocat-
ing, in line with an accounting profession of teachers, lecturers, and practitio-
ners, was missing the mark as far as meeting the real and vital decision-making 
needs of business.
Focusing on how the billable production-hour could be seamlessly connected 
and tracked with the invoiced sale, I wondered what would happen if we 
lumped all the annual expenses together, added a target profit, and came up 
with one total amount that needed to be recovered?
If the total were divided by the planned billable hours, the result would give a 
target average gross profit contribution per hour, while the cost of purchases, 
which varied from job to job, would be left out of the equation to be added 
at the time of invoicing. (“Target average gross profit contribution per hour” 
became known as “target average rate index” or “TARI®,” to emphasize its 
benchmark status, and its applicability to any type of business.)
6At the time this book went to print, financial statements made no mention of productivity, 
nor were they legally required to do so; neither was there any seamless connection between 
billed units of activity and the invoiced sale in any major commercial software. This is 
driven largely by the regulatory demands of government bureaucracies interested only in 
the bottom line for tax purposes, which places pressure on the practicing accountant.

In theory at least, such tracking would provide:
1. A target average contribution per unit (TARI) as a bench-
mark against which the actual contribution per unit of 
a quote or a price could be compared and adjusted as 
required to improve profitability.
2. A means of tracking and comparing total billed units 
and gross profit contribution with target weekly and 
accumulatively. 
3. An immediate awareness of the impact of either Item 1 
or 2 on the bottom line. 
Over the ensuing months, the business began to hum with the printer’s grow-
ing awareness of how to gain a competitive advantage in acquiring new cus-
tomers. Cash flow improved and profits began to flow.7
Thinking we might have freakishly tapped into a one-off vein of gold, I made 
sure the printer kept up his traditional pricing system—just in case. However, 
as time passed, it became obvious that it was what the business needed: a 
clear view of the forest while working flat-out down in the trees.
I eventually called the simple methodology I employed “Contribution-Based 
Activity” or CBA, occasionally referred to as the flip side of the traditionally 
oriented Activity-Based Costing,8 which had taken root in a profession favor-
ing pinpoint accuracy over practical reality.
TARI became the key derivative of CBA. For example, a business with a gross 
profit of $1 million9 and an output of 1 million cans of beans has an aver-
age gross profit of $1.00 per can. If the business targets a gross profit of 
$1,200,000 and 1 million cans of beans for the next period, it can be said to 
have a TARI of $1.20 per can.
The TARI of $1.20 provides a benchmark against which the gross profit per 
can is measured. Too many cans sold for a gross profit less than $1.20 will 
adversely impact the bottom line. The key to avoiding that is to track both the 
number of cans and the average gross profit per can, weekly and accumula-
tively, for comparison with target.
7Chapter 3 has more detail about this business.
8A methodology now discredited as being too expensively time consuming by its founders, 
and since replaced with “Time-Based ABC.”
9Gross profit is the amount left over to cover expenses and profit after deducting the cost 
of goods or materials purchased. It is referred to as gross profit, gross profit contribution, or 
contribution throughout the book. It equates to (sales – cost of goods/materials), or (total 
overheads ÷ expenses + profit).

Improving Profit
7
With the help of practicing accountants, CBA was applied to an increasing 
number of businesses across the spectrum of commerce and industry, including 
wholesale and retail, hospitality and transport, construction, and agriculture.
It became possible to seamlessly connect the underlying units driving activity 
with the gross profit contribution by means of a sample invoice analysis that 
teased out the contribution per unit. It was a process of enlightenment that 
invariably surprised and often shocked management as the range of gross 
profit contributions became evident.
The same analysis, taken a step further, provided a close approximation of 
overall productivity, which in turn became instrumental in getting the impor-
tance of the message through to the managers of companies small, medium, 
and large, opening the door to looking ahead and developing a TARI.10
Simple though the concept turned out to be, it was not easy for those steeped 
in the accounting mind-set to accept. How could direct costs be mixed up 
with indirect costs? How could wages, power, insurance, phones, and the like 
be so fixed that you could get an average unit rate across the board? How 
could a markup on the cost of purchases be left out of the equation?
I understood those questions and the traditional teaching that lay behind 
them. However, practical reality indicated that the attempt to achieve pinpoint 
accuracy in the distribution of expenses only served to clutter a clear view of 
the forest. From both the customer and owner’s viewpoint, it was the qual-
ity of the output in conjunction with the price that mattered, not how it was 
made up or by whom.
CBA is based on the assumption that all in-house expenses remain “fixed,” like 
the rent, on the understanding that any significant change in expenses will be 
reflected in adjustments to TARI11 on a monthly or quarterly basis.
As long as there is consistency in defining “contribution,” whatever costing 
system is in use, comparison of the contribution per unit of activity with TARI 
in conjunction with the number of billed units remains the key to survival and 
profitability. The more sophisticated the costing system, the greater the neces-
sity for a clear view of the forest.
Whatever the business, the level of activity can be targeted12 and broken down 
into “units” of activity that are then divided into the target contribution.
10Readers will find several examples of invoice analysis demonstrating a range of 
contributions per unit and identifying productivity in the ensuing case studies, especially 
in Chapter 23.
11That expenses could in any way be “fixed” like the rent is an anathema to certain members 
of the accounting profession, who have tended to lead the way in the opposite direction.
12Such as “75% or 6 out of 8 available hours” in manufacturing/service sectors, or “XX 
number of sales” in retail.

Chapter 1 | Background to Contribution-Based Activity (CBA)

There are times when the selected key activity driver doesn’t work as  
well as it should and may need a trial with another activity—for example, a 
sheep-leather tanning business, where the contribution per skin proved more 
workable than contribution per man-hour.
As will be demonstrated in Chapter 5, units of activity and contribution can be 
likened to two levers: a reduction in one can lead to an increase in the other 
and vice versa.
Finally, it begs the question: “Why don’t current financial and management 
software systems provide this information?” In the case of manufacturing 
and service companies, current commercial software is not programmed to 
extract the unit contribution of an invoiced transaction. The reasons for that 
include:
1.	 No regulatory requirement for financial statements to 
refer to unit input or output;13  
2.	 Management accounts emphasize unit cost rather than 
unit contribution;14
3.	 No overt demand to compare “actual” with “target” unit 
contribution or knowledge of the benefits of doing so.
Given these limitations, important information relating to an improved  
bottom-line performance is absent from decision making from the time of 
quoting or pricing through to the point of sale.
Action Sheets 
Achieving a clear view of the forest is one thing, but sustaining a clear view 
is another. My consulting days with an international group had drilled in  
the need for follow-through, without which the most highly regarded and 
well-intentioned plans fall down.
The weekly or fortnightly action meeting, with actions needed noted by whom 
and by when, is a vital tool in the CBA tool kit. Used correctly, an action meet-
ing of no more than an hour in length will cut through the clutter of talk 
and pinpoint what is to be done. When a matter is raised and uncertainty 
exists, responsibility for clarification by way of a summary feedback report 
13In other words, no reference to productivity.
14For those looking to compare CBA with systems such as Absorption Costing, Marginal 
Costing, Time-Based, or Activity-Based Costing, the key difference lies in CBA’s focus 
on tracking the individual unit-contribution in conjunction with the target number of 
unit-contributions required to cover expenses plus profit. Costing systems focus on the 
accuracy of the unit cost, and assume management will apply a markup percentage to 
cover profit.

is accepted—usually by the person raising the subject—for presentation at a 
subsequent meeting.15
The key is achieving the agreement of the person who will undertake the 
action. Failure to carry out the action becomes apparent at the next meeting; 
there is no recrimination, merely the question, “When will you do it?” and a 
date noted. The pressure is subtle and highly effective.

Here’s a rundown of this chapter’s important points:
Sample invoice analysis identifies productivity, establishes 
• 
a basis for planning ahead, and eliminates the need for 
time- and expense-consuming analyses of unreliable and 
fragmentary historical data.
The process of planning and targeting improved perfor-
• 
mance leads to the development of a benchmark known 
as TARI (Target Average Rate Index).
Comparison of unit contribution with TARI when quoting 
• 
or pricing provides the opportunity for adjustment up or 
down prior to commitment.
Used in conjunction with a knowledge of the bottom 
• 
line gained by weekly and accumulative feedback, the  
comparison provides an unique competitive advantage.
Weekly and accumulative summary of contribution per 
• 
unit of key activity is a cost-effective means of comparing 
real-time performance with potential performance.
A weekly review of results held in an action meeting  
• 
format underpins and ensures effective follow-through.
In the words of the financial director of a major consult-
• 
ing group who based his MBA thesis on a wholesale/retail 
chain with $12 billion in annual turnover.
“Movement of profitability analysis to the invoice level 
• 
provides management with on-line tools for benchmark-
ing and productivity control. Combined with an appro-
priate IT solution, it lets management identify potentially 
poor as well as outstanding performance prior to the 
activity occurring.”

I had just finished speaking to a group of business executives and was packing 
my computer prior to catching a taxi to the airport when one of the CEOs, 
Brian, tapped me on the shoulder.
“Would you have time to speak with the accountant at my plant?” he asked.
The time was 11:30 a.m. “I really need to be at the airport by 12:30 to catch

“Well, the plant is on the way. If you could just spare 20 minutes, I could get 
you to the airport in good time.” There was such a sense of need in his tone 
that I agreed to go with him.
On the way, he told me his plant manufactured kitchen utensils for nationwide  
distribution, and that they had recently upgraded all their information  
systems with new hardware and software at a cost of $500,000. The 
upgrades were designed to improve overall control of inventory, production,  
and pricing.
Although the system was designed and installed by one of the Big Four account-
ing firms, in whom he had complete trust, the information pouring out was so 
extensive he felt he had lost his grip on the business. That, in conjunction with 
a slowing down of cash flow, told him things were not as they should be.
While he was talking, I was trying to focus on what lay ahead.
Experience had taught me various ways of getting to the heart of a business 
without spending too much time on analysis. In the case of Brian’s business,  
I assumed it would be a matter of either
1.	 comparing production hours billed with production hours 
available for billing,1 or
2.	 comparing the company’s planned average gross profit2 
per production hour with the actual gross profit per hour 
in sales to one or more major customers.3
Either way, given the limited time available, I would have to play it by ear.
At the plant, I was ushered into a conference room where, to my surprise, the 
accountant sat waiting, together with the consultant responsible for designing 
and installing the software. To suggest the atmosphere was distinctly chilly 
would be an understatement.
I went straight to the whiteboard. “Can you give me budgeted sales, materials 
at cost, and production hours for the year?” I asked the accountant, wondering  
how long it would take to get the information.
He had no trouble locating the figures and I wrote them on the board 
(Table 2-1).
1Table 2-1 makes this clear.
2Throughout this book, gross profit is defined as the contribution toward covering in-house 
expenses and profit. It is the amount left over from a sale, after deducting the cost price of 
materials used. It can be referred to as gross profit, gross profit contribution, or contribution.
3Table 2-2 provides an example.

“That’s not how we calculate gross profit,” the accountant snapped. “We add 
factory wages and costs to the materials before deducting from sales.”
I understood where he was coming from: it was a traditionally accepted 
approach to add factory wages and expenses to materials before working out 
gross profit.
“Well, let’s face it,” I replied, “the days of hire and fire from job queues have 
faded, and factory wages and expenses are about as fixed as most other 
expenses. However, the costs of materials used can and do vary considerably 
from job to job.” The accountant frowned.
I continued, “In any event, what we are looking for here is a benchmark based 
on the average contribution of all the production hours. It happens to be $80. 
Depending on the job, the customer, and the sale price, some hours will result 
in higher contribution, and some lower.”
I pressed for a response. “Would you accept the company needs an average  
gross profit contribution per production hour of $80?” I asked the accountant.
Several seconds passed before he nodded agreement.
“Would you also agree that knowing the planned average of $80 provides a 
benchmark for comparing the gross profit per hour of a quote or a sale?”
“I guess so,” he said, clearly wondering where it was all heading.
I said, “I refer to the $80 benchmark as TARI, short for Target Average Rate 
Index, to avoid confusing it with a cost or a price. It is probably one of the 
most important—if not the most important—of KPIs.”5
“Never heard of it!” he said.
“Well, let’s see why I say that,” I continued. “Who’s your biggest customer?”

The accountant mentioned the household name of the country’s largest 
distributer of kitchen utensils.
“How much of your output do they take?” I asked.
The accountant shrugged. “No idea off the top of my head,” he said.
“Fifty-five percent,” Brian interjected.
“Can we access three or four typical invoices for this customer together with 
the cost of materials used and production hours involved?” I asked.
“Sure,” he said, gesturing to the accountant to comply.
While the accountant left the room to locate the invoices, the consultant 
broke the silence to drive home his credentials, pointing out that in addition 
to his role as a senior consultant with one of the Big Four, with extensive 
involvement with major companies in the region, he lectured on management 
accounting part time at the university.
The accountant returned. With three invoices in hand, it took less than five 
minutes to demonstrate the average gross profit per production hour for this 
customer (Table 2-2).

I pointed out, “It seems you are getting an average gross profit contribution of 
$33 per hour from a customer taking 55% of output when you really need an 
average of $80!” There was dead silence.
“What does it mean then?” Brian’s query had an anxious tone.
“It means your best customer is absorbing 55% of 250,000 production hours,” 
I went back to whiteboard (Table 2-3).

Improving Profit
15
“The bad news is that from the balance of the 112,500 hours in the year, you 
will need to achieve a total contribution of $15,462,500—at an average of 
$137+ per hour—if you are going to achieve your planned gross profit con-
tribution of $20 million.”
Brian looked shell-shocked. “What do you suggest, then?” he queried, grasping 
for a ray of light.
“Well, any reduction in the number of production hours scheduled for your 
best customer would help ease the burden. It’s a matter of thinking outside 
the box about ways and means of improving efficiency in production to get 
the hours down. A reduction of 10% in the 137,500 hours currently absorbed 
by your best customer would make additional hours available for other cus-
tomers and help reduce the required hourly contribution.”
I continued, “You can also look at ways and means of reducing material costs 
through buying better and cutting back on waste. A 5% reduction in the $40 
million material costs would improve the overall contribution by $2 million; 
10% would be better!”
I told the group I would carry out a sample invoice analysis on the other 45% 
of customers to see what they were getting by way of contribution. I knew 
they would be surprised!6
“I really think it’s time to get going to the airport,” I said, placing the white-
board marker back in its slot.
Reaching for his car keys on the table, Brian gave a loud sigh. “I knew I was 
being screwed,” he said, “I just didn’t know how much!”
As we left the room, the eyes of both the accountant and the consultant were 
fixed on the whiteboard, struggling to come to terms with the findings.

range of gross profit contributions per hour.

As we drove off, Brian said, “They threatened to take their business offshore if 
we didn’t lower our prices,” said Brian, referring to his best customer. “I knew 
something was wrong but couldn’t put my finger on it. Guess I allowed myself 
to be persuaded by all the calculations the accountant came up with about the 
deal making a marginal contribution.”
Case Comment
I leaned back in my seat as the flight took off, thinking of Brian and the half-
million he had spent installing hardware and software to get control of his 
business, only to find he was unable to see the forest for the trees. More to 
the point, the installation had failed to provide the key information that he 
needed when making decisions vital to the future viability of the company.
I wondered why it should be so difficult to identify that the best customer is 
contributing $33 an hour compared with a, TARI of $80.
The fact is, whatever the category of business, be it manufacturing or retailing, 
trucking or construction, most businesses do not analyze invoices to highlight 
gross profit per unit7 along the lines demonstrated in Table 2-2.
What’s more, a cornerstone of the accounting profession proclaims the need 
for information to be timely and relevant. In Brian’s situation, as with 95% of 
businesses, the feedback was neither timely nor relevant.
Such feedback is not relevant when it fails to indicate the level of productivity,8 
nor is it timely when it arrives two or three weeks into the following month.  
A problem that could have been resolved at the outset can become increasingly 
difficult to remedy some weeks later. Thus the need for weekly feedback.9
The following real-life case history of a printing business highlights the problem 
of identifying the levels of output activity—normally referred to as productivity. 
The case happens to be the printer who sparked my original involvement with 
the CBA concepts underlying TARI.
7A unit of activity is an hour in manufacturing, an invoiced sale, a cash ring-up in wholesale/
retail, a “cover” in restaurants/cafes, a minute in the rag trade, and so forth.
8Financial statements such as the profit and loss and balance sheet make no mention of 
productivity.
9See Table 1-2 for a useful weekly and accumulative tracking format. Following traditional 
accounting methodology, commercial software is not programmed to seamlessly connect 
production hours in the job ledger with relevant data in the financial accounts and is 
normally geared to providing monthly feedback.

Unable to see a connection between adding 25% 
profit to every job and ending up with 5%, the 
printer is instrumental in giving birth to TARI
“I don’t understand it at all: I put 25 percent profit on every job and never get 
more than 5 percent by the end of the year. What am I doing wrong?” asked 
the printer.
“I don’t know,” I replied, “but we can soon find out.” After 12 years as 
a professor of accounting and business studies, specializing in management 
accounting, I had yet to learn how to pinpoint the cause of such problems 
without extensive, time-consuming analysis. Nevertheless, I was confident we 
would find the solution.

Chapter 3 | Printing Business Multiplies Net Profit by 500%
18
Seeing the exercise as a potential hands-on challenge for final-year students,  
I sent three of them to the printing firm to collect a sample of jobs for analysis. 
When they came back with 3,000 job envelopes selected at random from the 
previous three years, I was not entirely unhappy to note the task would last 
for several tutorials.
Eventually the analysis was completed. “Just as he said, he puts an average of  
25 percent profit on every job,” they reported, “and ends up with 5 percent.”
“So what’s the conclusion?” I asked.
“Well, he’s right!” they answered with a smile.
I mentally questioned the value of three years of conventional accounting 
studies.
Sensing the problem was connected with too many gaps between jobs, 
and lacking any other information, we decided to check the length of time 
each printing machine operated. Gaining the cooperation of very skeptical  
employees, we ran the check for five days, only to find the six printing 
machines operated for less than two hours each out of an eight-hour day.
In the face of the printer’s refusal to accept the findings, we ran the check for 
another week with much the same result.
While the time check was underway, I spent time observing the routine. 
It went something like this: a customer would ask for 10,000 letterheads 
“the same as last time.” The work envelope for the previous occasion was 
located and a new job card inserted. The foreman looked at the job and wrote 
down the estimated times for compositing, printing, guillotining, and binding.
The job card was forwarded in the envelope to the person graced with 
the title of cost accountant. He in turn reached for a plastic-covered A4 
sheet containing the costs for every category of work. Taking account of 
the foreman’s times, he jotted down the costs on the job card in pencil.
At the completion of the job, the owner took the job envelope home along 
with 30 or so other envelopes in order to finalize the pricing over a weekend. 
This process involved reviewing the proposed prices on the job card, then 
adjusting them as he considered would be in line with previous billings, adding 
to—or subtracting from—the prices according to his best knowledge of the 
client and his “feelings” for an appropriate fit.
I recall being mildly shocked to realize that the exact, if not exacting, science1 
of cost accounting, which occupies a significant portion of an undergraduate 
degree, had but passing relevance to the realities of pricing in practice.
1“Art” may be more apt.

Improving Profit
19
The Printing and Allied Trades Manual for association members set out the 
complete rationale of costing and pricing precisely as would be found in any 
management accounting textbook. Nevertheless, having established various 
costs according to accepted theory, the owner’s interest appeared to 
terminate at that point. Each job was seen to be contributing to profit, but in 
absence of the company’s tracking the accumulated total of all jobs completed 
and billed, the theory broke down. Monthly financial statements, appearing 
weeks after the events to which their contents referred, did not refer to gaps 
between jobs or identify productivity by comparing hours billed with hours 
available for billing.
Driven to find cash to meet the weekly wage bill and satisfy demanding suppliers  
as well as an anxious bank manager, the owner’s prime target was cash, not 
profit, for as far as he was concerned, the two were identical. Cash in the bank 
meant wages and anxious suppliers could be paid without too much stress.
“As I see it,” I said to him, following several weeks of reviewing the whole pro-
cess of theory and practice, “excluding paper, ink, negatives, and outsourced 
work, you need to cover $350,000 in expenses for the year. If you add a 
further $100,000 to cover net profit, you need a gross profit contribution of 
$450,000.”
In view of a record profit of $35,000 achieved five years earlier, his look of 
disbelief at the $100,000 profit was palpable.
I pressed on. “You have 10 staff engaged in hands-on production with 1,800 
hours each available for billing, or 18,000 hours in total. Assuming 50% of 
those hours can be charged to jobs—bearing in mind last year was a lot less 
according to the checks we made—then you have 9,000 hours to achieve 
$450,000, or an average of $50 contribution2 per hour.”
He threw up his hands. “Our hourly charge rates are $20. We’d go out of 
business in a month.”
I picked up an invoice for $900 lying on his desk. “What was the cost of materials  
used in this job?” I asked.
He seemed to know the answer without referring to the work envelope. 
“Three hundred dollars,” he said.
“How many hours did you estimate the job would take when you quoted?”
“Ten hours.”
2Contribution refers to what is commonly referred to as gross profit contribution, being 
the amount left over after deducting the cost of goods or materials used; it “contributes” 
to covering overhead expenses plus any net profit. In other words, contribution = 
(overheads + net profit). Alternatively, contribution = (sales – cost of goods or materials); 
or net profit = (contribution – overheads).

Chapter 3 | Printing Business Multiplies Net Profit by 500%
20
I deducted $300 from the $900 and divided the remaining $600 contribution 
by 10 hours.
“Well,” I said, “that works out at $60 an hour.” I showed him the figures 
appearing in Table 3-1.

552 weeks less 7 weeks (4 weeks annual holiday + 10 days public holidays + 5 days sick leave).
He stared in disbelief. “How come?” he asked.
“Well, you applied a markup percentage to materials followed by a markup 
percentage to labor to cover overheads and a further 25% to cover profit, 
plus a little extra to cover your ‘feelings.’ All of which brings a contribution 
toward covering expenses and profit of $60 an hour.”
“But that includes profit and markup and everything,” he observed.
“That’s right, and that’s what the overall target average contribution rate of 
$50 includes.4 The key is to make sure that in addition to the average of $50 
per hour, you bill the target chargeable hours of 9,000 a year, or an average of 
200 hours a week for a 45-week year.”5
He shook his head slowly, intrigued yet mystified.
“Let’s run it alongside the existing system for a month or two,” I suggested. 
“We can’t go too far off track.”
I was even more tentative than the printer, wondering if my efforts at  
simplification had missed something important. The idea of running it as a trial 
appealed to me as much as to him.

Improving Profit
21
We met every week and checked progress by simply listing billings for the 
week, deducting the materials from the sale price, and dividing by the quoted 
or estimated hours. If the contribution of a quote came in at less than $50, he 
would review ways and means to do the job in less time in order to get closer 
to or exceed $50.
Billings were tracked weekly and accumulatively to compare hours and contri-
bution with the average weekly target of 200 hours × $50.
As his confidence increased, he began to target jobs showing a higher contribu-
tion than $50, as well as fine-tuning the hours of jobs with lower contribution.
It was this step-by-step, quote-by-quote, job-by-job decision making at the 
shop that began to make the difference.
After 10 weeks, the hours charged to jobs totaled 1,800 hours, or 200 hours 
below target, but the contribution rate was averaging $60 an hour, or $10 
above the $50 benchmark. The business was running $8,000 ahead of targeted 
net profit. Table 3-2 illustrates a simple format for tracking weekly results for 
comparison with target.

Encouraged, we pressed on, and after 20 weeks found that 3,600 billed hours 
were 400 hours below target, but the average hourly rate had escalated to

Being well ahead of target, we discussed the possibility of getting a foot in the 
door of one or two larger companies in order to quote for long-run jobs that 
could keep the machines running in the down times.
With his growing awareness of where the bottom line was located, the owner 
was in a position to underquote any competitor if he wished and still make a 
contribution to the bottom line, providing he left some margin on materials.
Keen to follow up on getting long-run orders that could be tackled over a 
period of weeks, he asked me if I would join him in visiting a major mining 
group to see if he could secure an initial order. As he offered to pay the airfare,  
I agreed to go with him.
It proved to be an interesting experience. After querying the whereabouts 
of the printing company’s regional location, the purchasing manager politely 
indicated that all printing requirements were met out of two major cities.
Noting the disconsolate look on the printer’s face, I spoke up. “It would be 
great if you could manage a small order. It’s just that we have students looking  
at the costing structure of this printing firm, and they believe they have 
worked out a new way of pricing that really works and would like to try it 
out on a large company. You will no doubt save money.”
He looked at me for a long time before saying, “Well, you’ve come a long way. 
I’ll see what we can do.”
Digging into a pile of files, he pulled out a purchase requisition for an interim 
report to shareholders. “Can you give a quote on 50,000?”
The printer flicked through the report and asked for a calculator.
“I don’t expect a quote here and now,” said the purchasing manager. “Take it 
away with you, and let me have a price next week!”
“I can give a price now if you wish,” said the owner.
“No—take it away and let me have it next week.” It was obvious he had no 
desire to take advantage of what was in his eyes a small-time printing firm in 
a country location he had never heard of.
The printer forwarded a quote within two days and received an order by the 
end of the week. In time, he went on to secure long-term contracts from the 
three major mining companies in the state.
Following his election as state president of the Printing and Allied Trades 
Association, he was nominated to chair the National Conference for Printers. 
I suggested it might be a good idea to prepare a joint paper for presenta-
tion to the participants on what had obviously proved to be a significant 
breakthrough.

23
“Great idea,” he said, “I did think about asking you to speak, but on second 
thought decided it could wait until the next national conference.”
“Any particular reason?” I asked.
“Well, I’ll be retired by then!” he said with a big smile.
Some years later, after taking up a new position in another city about four 
hours’ drive from the printer, I received a call from the proprietor of the local 
newspaper, asking if we could meet. When I asked him what he had in mind, 
he said, “Do I understand correctly that you were instrumental in helping XYZ 
printing firm with their pricing system some time ago?”
I replied in the affirmative.
“Well,” he said, “I was wondering if you could do the same for us. It’s just that 
XYZ is down here taking a lot of our business.”
Case Comment
Some years later, I was consulting with an accounting practice that had been 
attempting to improve the performance of one of their clients, which oper-
ated a medium-sized printing firm.
The accounting firm had been working with the printer to develop an improved 
costing system. After six months of analyzing past performance and calculating 
costs at various productivity levels across 10 cost centers, they had accumu-
lated a mass of data but were at a loss to see the way forward.
Listening to my story of the printer who had done so well, the owner of this 
printing firm, which had a $12 million turnover, wondered what relevance the 
story had for his much larger business.
I explained that just as the principle of gravity applies regardless of size, so 
it is with the concept of contribution-based activity that underlies TARI. It is 
universally applicable regardless of size.
Like the printer, a business may have planned for a certain level of sales and 
profit, but only finds out along the way, usually as cash flow falters, that the 
plan has fallen by the wayside.
The case history of the printer highlights a key problem facing business in gen-
eral, retail and nonretail, large and small: chasing sales based on the traditional 
approach to pricing jobs or products while overlooking the basis upon which 
pricing is established—the level of billable output.
For example, if a target contribution covering expenses and profit of $450,000 
is allocated to a planned 15,000 units of output activity which fades over time 
to 9,000 units, then the required contribution will rise from $30 to $50 per 
unit (Tables 3-4a and 3-4b).

Chapter 3 | Printing Business Multiplies Net Profit by 500%
24
Obviously, pricing on the basis of 15,000 units, when you’re only doing 9,000, 
would be heading for trouble.
In summary, of the numerous activities taking place at any one time, there is 
one key unit of activity fundamental to and driving the rest. In the case of the 
printer, the key unit is a billable production-hour.
So for the printer, dividing the overall target contribution by the target billable 
number of units results in a target average unit contribution, referred to as a 
Target Average Rate Index or TARI. The word Index is used to emphasize its 
statistical or benchmark status to distinguish it from a cost or price.
No matter the company, once TARI is established, the business is in a position 
to do the following:
1.	 Compare each quote, job, or sale (in the case of retail) 
with a benchmark that reflects the aim of the business to 
achieve a particular profit.
2.	 Track progress weekly and accumulatively by comparing 
actual billings with targeted billings as in Table 3-3.
If the real-time level of billings for the business—calculated by comparing 
actual with target billings for the period to date—is not considered on a 
week-by-week basis, the connection between billings and the targeted bottom 
line will remain in limbo. It is possible to catch up on a bad week, but not on 
a bad month, especially if the feedback arrives two or three weeks into the 
following month. Normally, weekly and accumulative feedback will be enough 
to sustain the connection.
TARI can be used to advantage in several ways, one of which will be explored 
in the following case history.

Six months of fine-tuning by a leading consulting 
group failed to stem the slide, despite a new 
product sending the plant into overdrive.
While in the UK, I contacted an old friend, Peter, who was working as a 
senior consultant with a widely respected international consulting group. 
He was at that time applying his skills to a major furniture manufacturer on 
the outskirts of London.
He said he had been on the assignment for the past six months, focusing 
on improving throughput in the factory and achieving a measure of success.  
Output was on track and the plant was working overtime to keep up with 
orders.

He had recently turned his attention to streamlining marketing procedures,

ing at ways and means of establishing a more effective promotional campaign.
Even so, he admitted he had been unable to stem the downward slide in the 
bottom line.
Knowing he had a grasp of the concepts of CBA and the TARI benchmark,  
I queried whether he was using them on the assignment. He said that his 
client employed over 750 people, of whom 26 were in the accounting office 
and 32 in IT, all highly qualified and providing up-to-date feedback from 
state-of-the-art software. Given the exponential changes that had taken  
place in production due to robotic machinery, he considered production-
hours of minimal consequence in matters of costing and pricing, and that TARI 
appeared to him to be focused on production-hours as the key activity driver.
I reminded him that the key production activity in any business, large or small, 
could vary from business to business and department to department within a 
business and may be person-hours or robot-hours.1
For the sake of friendship, if nothing else, he agreed to carry out a preliminary 
product analysis along CBA lines, but without mentioning it to his client at the 
risk of losing face.
As it turned out, despite the extensive use of robotic equipment for cutting, 
turning, and finishing, the costing was clearly based on production-hours as 
the common denominator.
It was a simple matter to divide the overall planned gross profit contribution 
by the planned production-hours to arrive at a TARI of ₤57 (Table 4-1).

2Normally referred to as gross profit contribution, unless specified otherwise, the term is 
used throughout this book to covers total expenses and profit, inclusive of all wages and 
overheads. It is the amount left after deducting the cost of material purchases.

Improving Profit
27
From there it became a matter of comparing the actual contribution per hour 
of each of the 120 products with the TARI of ₤57.
However, because the existing software was programmed to provide 
feedback in a standard management-accounts format that combined material 
costs with factory costs such as wages and overheads, the comparison could 
not be made.
It took Peter a day to explain to the finance director why he wanted to extract 
the contribution per production-hour per product, and a further day to get 
the IT manager to understand why the project should be given priority.
Once underway, it took a further three days for a system analyst and two 
programmers to pinpoint the gross profit contribution per production-hour 
of each of the 120 products.
“I must say what surprises me is the range of contributions per production-
hour,” Peter explained when we finally sat down at my sister’s home in 
London to review the results. “I would have expected a much greater 
consistency than is shown here,” he said pointing to contributions ranging 
from ₤96 to ₤22 (Table 4-2).

3A sample extracted from the list of 120 products identifies the average contribution 
rate per hour per suite. The hourly rate would have been calculated on the basis of 
manufacturing multiple numbers of the suite.

“I assumed the 50% markup on factory cost to cover overheads and profit 
would have resulted in a more even pattern of hourly rates,” he said, “yet 
only 19 of the 120 products contributed more than ₤57 per man-hour, and of 
the 19, at least 4 are discontinued lines,” pointing to a discontinued product 
contributing ₤96.
It was then his eyes settled on a product contributing ₤36 per hour.
“Goodness!” he exclaimed. “This is the product they are all excited about. It’s 
selling into Europe like hotcakes and pushing production into overtime!”
He jumped up from his chair. “There’s obviously been an error in pricing and 
it hasn’t been picked up!”
“What are you going to do about it?" I asked.
“Take it in and let them see it,” he replied, stuffing the papers in his briefcase 
in a hurried exit to his car.
When we spoke a week or so later, I asked about his progress.
He said, “The finance director wants to start tracking results using the TARI 
benchmark. He was a bit defensive at first, but I think once he realized it 
would be better tackled sooner than later, he was happy to get on with it. 
Interestingly enough, he said he had something similar in mind a year ago but 
didn’t follow through!”
“And the managing director?” I asked.
“A bit early yet. He needs time to let it sink in. He leaves all the figuring to the 
financial director. Right now, we are checking the gross profit contribution to 
flow from the products planned for next year.”
Another week passed before we met again to discuss progress.
“It would have been a disaster to have continued the way we were going,” Peter 
said. “As I mentioned, we had planned sales by multiplying out the sale price of 
each product by the number we estimated we would sell and merely applied 
the estimated gross profit margin based on our 50% markup to arrive at the 
gross profit contribution. When we reworked the exercise using the TARI 
approach, the margin worked out far less than our estimates.” He showed me 
an example (Table 4-3).

Improving Profit
29
It took the managing director two weeks or so to grasp the concept. He had 
started work with the company as a boy of 14 and worked his way up through 
production. Now close to retirement age, he found himself confronting a 
situation that challenged his comprehension: how could a finance department  
staffed with 26 accountants, several of them professionally qualified, and 
32 systems analysts and programmers, all graduates with some postgraduates, 
have gotten it so wrong?
Calling the department heads together, he got Peter to explain why the 
company had been experiencing a downward trend in profitability and what 
was needed to reverse it. This was followed by a brainstorming session 
focused on improving method and efficiency to reduce production times and 
determine ways and means of cutting material costs.
Starting with the suite currently in demand and requiring overtime in 
production, they worked their way through the top-selling suites contributing 
less than ₤57, being careful to avoid any change in basic design or quality of 
appearance.
Over a three-week period, the sessions proved to be effective in gaining 
additional contribution per production-hour across 25 of the top-selling 
products, with the contribution from the best-selling product rising from 
₤36 to ₤48 initially, and eventually, with more fine-tuning, to ₤56 (Tables 4-4a 
and 4-4b).

The accounts department commenced tracking production-hours and unit-
contributions of invoiced products singly and accumulatively against target. 
Within three months, improvements in unit-contributions began to show up 
with the first sign of an upward trend in the bottom line.5
Knowing he needed an average unit-contribution of $57, the managing 
director lost no time in applying the concept to the design section of the 
marketing department. New furniture designs calling for his approval were  
now reviewed in light of their proposed unit-contribution. Any that delivered 
a contribution of less than ₤57 were sent back for redesign.6
With results proving to be so positive, the managing director considered that 
he finally had a grip on the business. So much so, that after walking around 
the factory one Friday afternoon and noting the hours the employees used to 
clean up before going home—an event that had gone on for as many years as 
he could recall—he went back to his office and multiplied the hours by ₤57.
Peter told me he found him with head in hands late that Friday evening, having 
discovered the cleanup process was depleting the bottom line to the tune of 
₤2 million a year.

In the belief that in-house labor was cheaper than outsourcing, he had consis-
tently turned down offers by contractors to do all the cleaning for less than 
₤150,000. However, his previous calculation of in-house versus outsourcing 
costs was based on an in-house cost of ₤12 an hour, not the potential ₤57 that 
was dependent on the input of that hour.
Before I left the UK, some months later, the bottom line was showing a 
definite upward trend into profit. Peter was asked to extend his assignment 
for a further six months.
Case Comment
One can only feel for the managing director in such a situation, surrounded as 
he was by professionally well-qualified finance and IT departments, including  
an financial director upon whom he relied completely. His background and 
focus from the time he started with the business as a boy of 14 had been 
production. It is not surprising that it took him several days to understand 
the essence of the matter, only to realize that both the diagnosis and the 
prescription for resolving the problem were so simple.
It was not as though he lacked information about the business. Along with all 
directors, he received a 125-page monthly “board pack” covering every aspect 
of the business, including a detailed list of where performance varied from 
target. If anything, he suffered from information overload.
Awareness of the direct relationship between the target gross profit and the 
production-hour gave him a grip on the business that he had never previously 
enjoyed.
Whereas the printer in the Chapter 3 was unaware that he was getting close 
to two hours’ output for eight hours’ pay, in this case, the output was known 
to be close to 75%, or six hours per eight-hour day.
Even so, no connection had been made between the actual gross profit 
contribution of a product and its overall targeted contribution.
Assuming the costing had been carried out in line with the costing of all 
products, how could it happen that a product so much in demand returned 
such a low contribution per production-hour unit of input?
It could be the time to make and assemble had been miscalculated, or the 
price of materials had risen without being noticed, reducing the desired 
margin available.
It could also mean that retailer resistance or competition in the marketplace 
had caused a price cut or involved discounting.

The point is that none of these possibilities were detected in the midst 
of numerous activities taking place at the same time, and it was only the 
fortuitous intervention of my meeting up with Peter7 that restored focus 
to what really mattered.
The following case study illustrates theinteraction between output activity 
and the contribution per unit of that activity.
7At the conclusion of his consulting assignment, Peter stayed on as a head of operations, 
reporting directly to the managing director for another two years or so, before he was 
headhunted by a pipe-manufacturing group with plants in the US and UK. In March 2013,  
I had the pleasure of visiting the UK plant and speaking with key personnel. CBA and TARI 
concepts were clearly in evidence throughout the plant. From the plant manager to the 
apprentice sweeping the floors, all were aware of the value of their contribution to the 
bottom line. The employees in each section engaged with different operations, met weekly 
for an hour to review results for the past week, and established targets for the week 
ahead. In a plant that worked around the clock in three shifts, the need for supervision was 
minimal. It was an uplifting experience!

The contractor was 1 of 10 people I nominated for an interview following  
a seminar at which I had spoken on “How to Detect and Eradicate Malignant

As an electrical contractor, he employed 20 technicians installing electrical 
circuits in high-rise buildings and had struggled to make a profit during the 
past year.
Following a brief review of his situation, in conjunction with his accounting 
adviser, we projected a target contribution by adding the anticipated expenses 
of the business to a healthy net profit for the year ahead and dividing the 
result by an estimated number of billable hours.1 We arrived at a target aver-
age contribution2 per hour of $46 (Table 5-1).

He understood that in order to achieve the planned contribution for the year, 
he would need to track an average of 600 hours a week (20 technicians × 
30 hours each) for 45 weeks at an average contribution of $46 an hour.
We completed an Action Sheet (Table 5-2). It set out the key points, and it 
noted the start dates and the persons responsible.5
1Based on charging out 6 hours a day, 5 days a week, and 45 weeks of the year.
2Contribution, invariably labeled “gross profit contribution,” refers to the amount left over 
after deducting the cost of materials payable to a supplier.
3When used as a benchmark, the target average contribution is referred to as the target 
average rate index, or TARI, to avoid confusion with a cost or a price.
420 technicians × 30 hours a week × 45 weeks.
5Bearing in mind that “genius is 20%, implementation 80%,” Chapter 22 contains examples 
of the vital role of Action Sheets when implementing change.

Pleased with the projected profit and simplified approach to tracking, the con-
tractor was smiling as he left the accountant’s office.
It was six months before I had an opportunity to respond to the accountant’s 
request for a follow-up interview. It seems the contractor was not achieving 
his target and was deeply concerned about where to go and what to do.
“It’s too competitive,” he said. “I can’t win quotes at $46 an hour and my order 
book is down to three weeks’ work at most.”
“At what rate can you win quotes?” I asked
“No more than $40,” he replied.
Standing with my back to the whiteboard, I looked at him intently. To drop his 
TARI from $46 to $40 would negate most if not all of his profit.
I mentally reviewed the two levers within our reach:
1.	 Billable units of activity
2.	 TARI of $46 per hour
If the TARI of $46 couldn’t be achieved, billed output or productivity had to 
be increased.
However, the tracking data indicated that target billable hours were being 
achieved. Seventy-five percent productivity, or six hours a day, was optimal 
without going into overtime. In any event, overtime would only add to over-
head and increase the contribution required.
I experienced a fleeting sense of failure, with all its consequences for the  
contractor and the loss of face for the accountant, who had gone out on  
a limb to involve me with his clients.
I recall standing there as the seconds ticked away, wondering what the solu-
tion could be. To gain more time, I put out a feeler: “Are you achieving your 
quoted times, or are you running over?”
“Some run over, some run under, but on average they match up,” he replied.
“Who does the quoting?” I asked
“The estimator,” he replied.
“How does he work out his times?”
“He has a pretty sophisticated software package that he works from.”
“How does he track actual times against target?” I queried.
“All the time sheets are fed to him. He records the times taken and uses them 
to update or develop times for all types of work.”

Chapter 5 | Contractor Overcomes Competition to Make a Profit
36
“Does he carry out any work or method study of the jobs to check if they are 
being done efficiently or otherwise?”
He laughed at the thought. “He hasn’t been out of the office for the past five 
years to my knowledge. He’s too flat-out running his neck of the woods. No, 
he relies on the time sheets, and that is sensible enough. The men are fairly 
good with their times; we keep an eye on them.”
“Do you remember me talking about HCL—Human Comfort Level—at the 
seminar?” I asked.
“Yes I do, but I don’t think it applies in our case,” he replied.
I reminded him of this important point. “Where no plan or target or budget 
has been established, there is a tendency for effort to sink to human comfort 
level, or HCL. If there has been no reassessment of times for jobs, the ten-
dency will inevitably lead to an expansion of those times. Imperceptible maybe, 
but inevitable!” My confidence surged as I glimpsed a potential solution.
“What are you saying?” he queried.
“Well, if your estimator has been relying on time sheets to update times per 
job and using them in the quoting, those times will have blown out over the 
years. It is characteristic of time sheets.”
He asked, “You mean we are overquoting the time a job should take?”
“Exactly!”
“Well, what do we do? We don’t have time to work- or method-study the 
jobs. We would be out of business before we got started!”
I wrote $6 on the whiteboard and divided by $46 to get 13%.
“I suggest that for the moment, you get the estimator to take 13 percent off  
all times quoted and leave the target contribution or TARI at $46. For example, 
if you have job estimated to take 100 hours, cut the estimate to 87 hours.”
“But why 13 percent?”
“Because that’s the difference between getting a contribution of $40 com-
pared with $46 an hour. You believe you can win quotes at $40 an hour based 
on current time estimates. For example, a job estimated to take 100 hours at 
$40 an hour will amount to $4,000. But the job will also amount to $4,000 if 
you complete it in 87 hours at $46 an hour.”
I wrote on the whiteboard:
100 hours × $40    =    $4,000
87 hours × $46    =    $4,002

Improving Profit
37
For a moment or two, he was nonplussed. “I don’t know if we can do it. After 
all, the men have a good idea of how long a job should take.”
“I’d be surprised if they track the times against the quote,” I replied. “How 
much do they know about the quoted hours at the outset of a job?”
He shook his head. “I guess they don’t. They just go to a job pretty much 
according to the schedule we put out at the beginning of each week.”
“So if you want this to work for you, the men need to be aware of the  
targeted times.”
“I guess that will lead to designing some sort of incentive system?” he queried 
with raised eyebrows.
“Whatever happens, don’t even think of an incentive system until you get 
everyone to accept the idea of completing a job in the targeted hours. And 
even then, any incentive should be based on what comes in over and above 
targeted net profit.”6
When speaking with the accountant some months later, he told me his client 
was on track to meet the targeted net profit. It appeared the owner had taken 
a more active role, splitting the 20 technicians into four teams of five each to 
hold weekly action meetings at which they reviewed results of the previous 
week, discussed the scheduled work for the week ahead, and noted their 
responses on Action Sheets for review and follow-up by the owner.7
Regular contact with the owner, as well as the estimator and accountant, had 
the effect of melding a disparate group of individuals into a team with a clear 
focus on the target they were aiming to achieve.
Case Comment
The two keys of activity and gross profit contribution at the heart of every 
business are clearly demonstrated in this case study. If the desired contribu-
tion rate is unachievable, the alternative is to review the level of billable or 
output activity.
If the level of billable activity cannot be achieved, the alternative is to review the 
contribution rate, bearing in mind it is also possible to improve net profit by 
reducing the cost of materials or parts used as per the example in Table 5-3.
6Table 1-2 illustrates a simple format for tracking weekly results for comparison  
with target.
7The owner made a point of sitting in with each team for 10 minutes or so, and he ensured 
the estimator and accountant did the same from time to time—not so long that individual 
members of the team would be inhibited in freely expressing their views, but long enough 
to make them realize he was there to help and not hinder.

As an instrument for reviewing activity, time sheets are potentially useful but 
only if maintained accurately and compared with times quoted for a job. What 
really matters is what goes on between the time of signing on and signing off.
Our research shows that time sheets are notoriously inaccurate as a guide to 
productivity and efficiency. With few exceptions, times are seldom compared 
with times quoted.
Work-study covers the overall method as well as the timing of jobs. This case 
study is typical of businesses developed from one-person startups where pro-
prietors work for themselves and awareness of how long a job should take is 
based primarily on their own input.
As a business grows, taking on more personnel and generating more activity, 
the proprietor becomes increasingly distanced from the shop floor or field-
work, and times inevitably blow out.
In the case of this business, it was one thing to point the way by cutting 
back on estimated times, but it was quite another to make it work. Without 
the week-by-week discipline of action meetings in conjunction with Action 
Sheets, implementing the desired change would have fallen by the wayside. It 
bears out the well-worn saying of “20% genius, 80% implementation,” and is 
something that the following real-life case study illustrates.

Proprietor’s 
Moment of Truth
Struggling to repay the bank, the proprietor 
blamed himself for going into debt against his 
better instincts. However, the debt was not the 
cause of his problem at all.
“I borrowed from the bank to buy a steel guillotine to save me having to take 
the steel across town every time I wanted to get it cut. And now I can’t make 
the payments.”1 Max was a man who hated the thought of borrowing because 
of the very problem he now found himself facing. The specter of potential 
disaster loomed large on his horizon.

Chapter 6 | Horticultural Equipment Proprietor’s Moment of Truth

He was making a variety of horticultural machines for polishing and packing 
fruit. The business had developed after he retired from a career in tool mak-
ing in order to purchase an avocado orchard. At the end of his first year on 
the orchard, when the time came to wash, polish, and pack the fruit, he was 
unable to hire the necessary equipment or gain access to the local horticul-
tural cooperative plant.
So he bought, cut, and welded steel, and mechanized his own plant. It was 
compact and highly efficient—so much so, that demand for like models began 
to flow, to the point where he built a large shed and hired labor. At the time 
of our meeting, the business was several years down the track, employing nine 
people in production with overseas exports well under way.
“Are your people busy?” I asked.
“Flat out,” he responded, giving an answer I had come to expect 9 times out 
of 10.
“How do you know?” I pressed.
“They are good men. They like to live and work in the countryside; their  
children go to school here; their wives want to stay here; they don’t belong 
to a union.”
It was not difficult to see why they liked living in the area: it was bathed with 
bright sunshine and refreshed by adequate rainfall; was rich in volcanic soils 
that enabled flowers, fruit, and lush pastures to proliferate; and was a short 
drive from endless miles of golden sands and rolling Pacific Ocean surf.
“I can understand they like living here, Max, but how do you know they are 
working productively?”
“What do you mean?”
“I mean, how do you know they are flat out?”
“The window in my office looks over the factory and I can see them at work 
every time I look out.” He omitted to mention he was away much of the time 
attending trade exhibitions, servicing customers, and spearheading a thrust 
into overseas markets.
“Can we look at the output for the past year?” I asked, getting away from what 
threatened to be a talkfest in order to glance at the financial statements. They 
revealed no more than conventional sales and expenses and made no refer-
ence to productivity.
In response to my request for something more helpful, he produced a pile of 
well-thumbed invoice books containing handwritten carbon copies of invoices.
We laboriously extracted each product sold, noting the cost of materials used 
and the estimated hours on a sheet of paper (Table 6-1).

“You have nine in full-time production, working how many hours?” I asked
“Forty hours a week each,” he said.
“Any overtime?”
“Yes, about four hours a week each. It gives them a bit of extra.”
“And would they get four weeks’ annual leave plus a week’s sick leave on full 
pay?” I asked.
“Yes, plus 10 days public holidays,” he replied.
“So with 4 weeks’ holiday plus the equivalent of 2 weeks of public holidays 
plus a week’s sick leave, they would work 45 weeks for 52 weeks’ pay?”
Max nodded in agreement.
“Well 44 hours a week works out at roughly 1,980 hours per full-time 
employee in production hours, or 17,820 total for nine employees.” I noted 
the figures on a whiteboard (Table 6-2).

“Yes, I see that,” he said. “But so what?”
“Well, it means that you are paying some 20,592 hours for the production 
team to work 17,820 hours, of which you bill 4,560 hours.”
That works out as close to 25% or two hours charged out on a typical eight-
hour day (Table 6-3).3

Max jumped up and exclaimed, “There must be more invoice books some-
where!” He went off to check desks, drawers, and filing cabinets.
However, there were no more invoices and the invoiced prices for the products 
listed added up very close to the year’s sales as spelled out in the financials.
“How is this possible?” he asked when he had settled down again. “None of 
them are slackers.”
He picked up the financial statements, which compared last year with the pre-
vious year. “How come the sales have not dropped?” he asked with a twinge 
of doubt about the prognosis creeping into his voice.
“You mentioned you had raised your prices, and the high returns flowing from 
the new punnet seeder have been masking low productivity. The combination 
of falling output and increased expenses has put pressure on your ability to 
repay the loan.”
“I don’t understand it,” he reiterated.
“It’s fairly normal, I assure you. You got things started; you worked out the 
times for each type of unit produced and you priced the jobs accordingly. The 
business grew and you found yourself attending trade shows and exhibitions, 
installing the units on properties, servicing the breakdowns, hiring new staff, 
interviewing sales reps, collecting debts, paying bills, and spending hours on 
new developments. Regardless of how hard you tried, you lost touch with 
production throughput.
3Based on a 44-hour week, the production team was at work 8.8 hours a day. However, 
8.8 hours a day at the workplace does not mean they are all available for working on 
products. There will be time set aside for cleanup, equipment maintenance, and inevitable 
downtimes. Billable hours for this type of business should be closer to 70% of available 
hours. In this case, 70% × 17,820 hours  = 12,474 hours.

43
“And it’s not that the men are slacking, either,” I continued. “They are pacing 
themselves. Maybe the job that can be done in ten minutes is now done in 
twenty or more. You look around and they are all busy, but they have slowed 
down, knowing they will run out of work by the end of the day or week. Bring 
the work in and they’ll speed up.”4
Max said, “How is it that my accountant doesn’t tell me these things? He told 
me if he gives me regular figures, I could not go wrong. Now I see the position 
is serious even though sales dollars are up on last year. What use are these 
figures to me?” He threw the statements back into the bottom drawer.
“I’m sorry to have to say it, Max, but if there is a textbook written that teaches 
how to identify levels of productive activity and relate it to a financial contribution 
in a practical sense, the accounting profession hasn’t advertised it.” I explained 
that current financial statements are simply not geared to point out that his 
production team achieved two hours of output for eight hours of pay. I then told 
him that quarterly statements such as those he was getting were more helpful 
than annual statements, but they arrived a month after the period to which they 
referred, and the management information they provide was extremely limited.
“In any event,” I said, “by the time they arrive, it is a bit late to remedy what 
has already occurred. That’s why you need to track progress weekly. That way, 
you can be in a position to make corrections before small problems become 
big ones.”
“How would I get them weekly?” he asked, “The accountant’s on my back 
enough as it is to get information every three months.”
“Collecting the information necessary to give you the focus you need is not dif-
ficult,” I said. “All you need is complete a summary sheet of invoices once a week. 
After all, you only have one, two, or three invoices at the most to make out.”
I instructed him to note the invoice number of the sale, the sale price, the cost 
price of materials, and the hours quoted or established for the unit or units 
sold. I concluded, “You make sure it is filled in every Friday and add the total 
onto the previous totals so you keep a running check.”
I sketched out a format to give him the idea, (Table 6-4).
4During a break, I went into the plant and spoke with the foreman. He said he was well 
aware of the order book and what work lay ahead. He admitted that when the order 
book showed few if any orders were lined up, the production team slowed down so 
they didn’t run out of work completely. Obviously, Max was overstaffed for the output 
being generated, but he didn’t know it. The question thus becomes, “Why not adjust staff 
numbers to meet the level of work flowing through the factory?” It had taken Max several 
years to build a loyal and dedicated team able to cope with a variety of machines, some of 
them highly technical. The last thought in his mind would be to lay one or more people off. 
The demand for his products went through highs and lows with seasonal weather playing 
a significant role. When harvests were poor, demand faded and vice versa.

5Table 6-4 is purely an example for Max. However, it illustrates a case where the average 
contribution per hour exceeds the TARI benchmark, and where billed hours fall hours 
behind target, suggesting the products are profitable enough in themselves, but not enough 
of them are heading out the door.
6Gross Profit Contribution:  After deducting the cost of materials purchased from a supplier, 
the amount left over is the contribution toward covering expenses and profit. Sometimes 
this is referred to as “added value.”
Max said, “But I’ve got orders that take several weeks to put together.”
“That’s no problem,” I said. “You only note the sales made. Work in progress 
is going on all the time and eventually translates into sales.”
“What about the time spent on research and development of new machines 
and so on?”
“Do you use the production team to help you?”
“No, not really,” said Max. “I might use the foreman occasionally. I usually wait 
until they have knocked off for the day before I get down to it.”
“In that case, there is no need to allocate some of their hours to R&D. So let’s 
look ahead at the likely expenses for next year.”
We worked our way down the list using his guesstimates. Excluding the cost 
of materials and outsourced work, the expenses totaled $630,000.
“What shall we put down for profit, bearing in mind you broke even and 
covered expenses on 4,560 hours charged out? Just think of the potential if 
you can charge out 9,000 hours, which is close to 50% of 17,820 hours!”
The thought seemed to cheer him up, and we targeted $270,000 net profit to 
arrive at a gross profit target of $900,000. We divided this by the targeted 9,000 
chargeable hours to get a target average gross profit contribution of $100.

“Assuming a 45-week year and a target of 9,000 chargeable hours, you need 
200 hours per week charged into product at an average gross contribution  
of $100 an hour,” I said (Table 6-5). “We refer to that average as the target 
average rate index or TARI, so it will not be confused with a cost or a price. It is  
a benchmark against which you can compare the gross profit contribution per 
hour from any product or job.”

Eight years passed, and apart from an occasional phone call, we lost touch. 
Then Max’s wife rang to ask for help. She said profit had steadily increased 
over the years to $400,000, but that had fallen to a loss of $150,000 during 
the past year.
It seemed that when Max had semi-retired and handed control to a newly 
appointed general manager, the business began to decline, reaching the point 
where Max needed to borrow heavily against the security of his house and 
property in order to pay suppliers demanding cash payment for materials.
It did not take long to find out that comparison of invoices with TARI along 
with weekly feedback had been discarded in favor of software the general 
manager had used during previous employment with a major corporation.
The process of monitoring performance weekly and accumulatively in the 
CBA format recommenced, and 12 months down the track, the business was 
slowly correcting the situation.
The key to achieving the turnaround lay in comparing invoices with the TARI 
benchmark at the time of quoting as well as comparing actual results with 
target each week—on the grounds that it was possible to catch up on a bad 
week but much more difficult to catch up on a bad month. Table 6-7 presents 
a format to capture data for the week as well as the weeks to date.

Case Comment
Max was no ordinary toolmaker turned manufacturer. His machines became a 
byword for quality and durability. His computerized punnet filling and seeding 
lines, supplemented by robotic arms to transfer embryonic plants from small 
to larger punnets, were sought after by countries as far apart as China, Saudi 
Arabia, Germany, and the United States.
His production manager was a highly intelligent engineer who synchronized 
the purchase orders for just-in-time delivery of materials and parts fully item-
ized at the completion of the design and coordinated the workflow through 
the plant. He was a cheerful and cooperative team member.
The marketing manager, who had an engineering background, specialized in 
quotations for the larger, highly computerized seeding units in demand by 
nurseries, and followed through with arrangements for on-site establishment 
and support by the in-house team.
The accounts were handled by a skilled bookkeeper under the supervision of 
the firm’s external accounting practice.
For several years running, Max’s business was awarded “Export Business of 
the Year” in the state’s small and medium-sized business category.
It was a talented team working creatively and in harmony with one another, but 
a team that nevertheless felt the need to employ a general manager who, in the 
words of Max, “would bring the loose ends together and provide direction.”
As it turned out, the general manager’s experience was gained in the corpo-
rate world, from which he had retired early to enjoy a more relaxed lifestyle 
away from the city.
He introduced methods and systems that cost money and created information 
overkill. Over the subsequent years, the firm started to lose heavily. Max mort-
gaged his home and land to provide cash to continue. By the time I responded 
to the cry for help from Max’s wife, the GM had gracefully retired.
For a business to sustain the rigors involved with survival and growth, it 
needs a focal point upon which management can agree, and around which 
the functioning departments are able to operate, like spokes in a wheel—a 
business wheel.
I saw that a business can be likened to a wheel turning according to the level 
of billable units of activity at the hub, with the spokes representing various 
functions such as personnel, production, marketing administration, finance, IT 
systems, and so forth.10
10For an illustration of how 12 senior managers viewed their businesses in a wheel format, 
see Appendix D.

Chapter 6 | Horticultural Equipment Proprietor’s Moment of Truth
48
For a wheel to operate in a balanced way with a minimum of friction, the 
spokes need to be of equal length. Should one or more of the spokes pro-
trude ahead of the others, the impact is transmitted to the hub.
If the wheel is targeted to move at an agreed speed (units of output) matching 
available resources (contribution), the extent of any change in speed will be 
reflected at the hub by
1.	 comparing actual unit-contribution with TARI on an 
invoice-by-invoice basis and
2.	 comparison with the overall weekly and accumulative 
target.
Max has now retired but the business continues, closely attuned to the need 
for a sustained focus on the hub.
It is the sustained focus on movement at the hub (output and gross profit 
contribution per unit of output) that tends to become self-fulfilling, not only 
for manufacturing or service-oriented sectors, but for wholesale and retail 
business as well, as the following real-life case study in Chapter 7 illustrates.

Wholesaler

A management buyout of a company, being 
sold for lack of profitable performance, 
illustrates what can happen when targets are 
broken into digestible proportions
During a daylong workshop with 20 clients of a coastal accounting practice,  
I came across a business supplying ships with provisions ranging from ancho-
vies to anchors. The proprietor, himself an ex–seagoing captain, responded 
warmly to the concept underlying CBA1 and asked if I would run a workshop 
for his five branch managers.
Over the next year or so, I conducted workshops every four months. We 
analyzed past results and planned ongoing performance, giving managers an 
opportunity to explain their successes as well as their failures.

By year’s end, while the improvement in overall performance was apparent, 
it was not until the business was taken over by a major corporate group, and 
another 21 branches joined the 5 existing branches, that the extent of change 
became obvious. The managers of the existing branches were far ahead of 
their peers in grasping the essentials of what made a business tick.
The takeover represented but 1 of 300 or more takeovers by the major cor-
poration, which specialized in improving business performance by demanding 
improved accounting systems and reporting procedures that filled 150 pages 
of a monthly report for the board.
Three years subsequent to the takeover, the corporation went belly-up. The 
CEO of the enlarged provisioning group, the ex-captain, approached me to 
help with a management buyout from the bankruptcy administrators. Upon 
successful completion of the buyout, I agreed to take on the role of chairman 
until the company settled into its stride.
Sales were around $50 million, with gross profit contribution running at a low 
20% of sales and a net profit of nil.
Calling a meeting of senior executives to work out a strategy for the year 
ahead, I asked, “What is the average sale?” and looked around the table. There 
was silence and a shuffling of feet.
Finally the general manager spoke up. “There’s no such thing in this business,” 
he said, somewhat indulgently.
“Why do you say that?” I asked.
“Well, a major customer like one of the Queens might order $150,000 worth 
at once, or we’ll get a tug boat ordering bread and milk for $50. No way can 
there be an average sale in this business.”
“Well, there’s one thing for sure,” I replied, “if we don’t know the average sale, 
we certainly can’t improve it.”
I recounted an example of a typical hardware store with some 7,000 product 
lines, ranging from $1,000 chainsaws to 50-cent packets of screws. The con-
tribution2 per average sale was $20 and once it had been identified, the daily 
average achieved would be noted in large characters on the whiteboard in the 
employee’s staff room. It provided a daily update and helped sustain focus on 
where the rubber meets the road.
I said, “As we don’t even have a record of the number of sales made, we  
need to start tracking the sales and gross profit contribution per sale for 
every vessel supplied. In time, that will build up a more accurate picture.”
2Contribution, normally known as gross profit contribution, refers to the amount left over 
after deducting the cost of goods obtained from a supplier.

As the weeks passed, information from branches was processed and sent 
back to each branch in a format that could be pinned up on lunchroom 
notice boards. The results for each representative were highlighted showing 
the number of sales made and the average contribution achieved, both for  
the preceding week and accumulatively for the weeks to date (Table 7-1).

Analysis of past sales quickly established the average sale had been in the 
region of $5,000, and focus shifted from vague generalizations about how 
to improve an existing overall 20% contribution for $50 million in sales, to 
a contribution of 25% on a $5,000 sale.
In reality the $5,000 was a statistical average and actual sales ranged widely. By 
refocusing on a manageable average sale of $5,000, it was possible for manage-
ment and representatives to target the real objective, which was to improve the 
contribution margin from the equivalent of $1,000 to $1,250 per average sale.3
I pressed for a target of 25% contribution per sale with recording to  
commence immediately.
It was a question that became the focus of subsequent management meet-
ings, resulting in simple and achievable objectives that could be carried out 
in each branch.
Within two months, reports filtered back from branches revealing different 
methods adopted to improve the gross profit per sale.
One northern branch, handling coal vessels, took brochures from the local 
jeweler on board the ships and sold opals to the crew, increasing the average 
contribution by $300 a sale.
320% of $5,000 = $1,000, 25% = $1,250. In other words, it represented an improved 
contribution of $250 per sale.

Chapter 7 | Wholesaler Nets $2.5M in 10+ Months  
52
Another branch made a deal with the local video outlet and sold videos to the 
crew, increasing the average contribution by $200 per sale.
The previous ordering system, in which 60 representatives wrote out the 
order and the head office completed the invoice, with no one in between 
identifying the contribution margin, was changed so that each representative 
worked out the contribution margin at the time the order was made out.
This in turn called for lessons on how to ensure a minimum contribution of 
25%—while still taking account of a possible 5% discount for early settlement. 
Table 7-2 provides an illustration.
The change for improved contributions flowed once each branch pinned up 
the weekly and cumulative results of each representative, resulting in a focus 
on contribution rather than sale volume as had previously been the case.
With the increased gross profit contribution flowing directly to the bottom 
line, and gross profit contribution margins continuing to climb with the sup-
port of improved buying and focusing on items that attracted higher margins, 
net profit rose steeply, in turn strengthening the cash flow.
Quarterly management workshops imparted additional input, training branch 
management in planning, targeting, and monitoring performance; providing a 
means of sharing marketing skills; developing more effective and timely collec-
tion of the proceeds; and sharpening techniques of purchasing to reduce costs 
and control inventory.
4A 25% contribution margin on the sale price equates to a 33% markup on cost price. For 
example, 25% on a sale price of $100 = $25; a 33% markup of $75 = $100.
5A discount of 5% on the sale price requires a markup of 5.264%.

From the time of the management buyout to the end of the financial year—a 
period covering 10.5 months—the average gross profit per sale increased by 
$250, which on 10,000 sales, resulted in a net profit of $2.5 million.
The success attracted the attention of stockbrokers, and within 18 months 
from the time of buyout, the company was listed on the stock exchange, pro-
viding a handsome paper gain for the shareholders as well as additional cash 
for funding expansion.
Case Comment
It was at this point that I stepped down from the chairman’s role, handing the 
job over to one of the three newly appointed nonexecutive directors.
Given the need to report to the stock exchange and deal with the more 
burdensome regulatory matters of a listed company, the board in its wisdom 
replaced the existing chief accountant with a more sophisticated company 
secretary from a major accounting firm.
Unfamiliar with the software that had been introduced to handle the week-by-
week reports to and from the branches, he dispensed with them and reverted 
to the traditional monthly reporting practice contained in a 120-page Board 
Pack, completed three weeks after the month to which the contents referred.
The branches continued to send in their weekly reports, but the head office 
merely filed them without providing any feedback of results for posting on 
the branch notice board. Within six months, the gross profit margin fell from  
a high of 28% to a terminal 20%.
Lack of focus on where the rubber meets the road brought the company 
close to negative profit, and within a year of listing, I was asked to return  
as chairman.
Chasing an annual target of, say, $50 million can only be achieved by small 
steps, with each day taking care of itself. Thus the importance of focusing on 
gross profit contribution sale by sale and the number of sales week by week.
The average sale of $5,000 was purely a statistic. It is unlikely there ever was 
such a sale, but it was eminently more digestible than focusing on $50 million.
The point is that $5,000 could be comprehended and focused on by the 
branch managers, although each branch had a different average sale depending 
on the size of the vessel loading at the port.
The simple objectives called for each branch to target a number of sales 
together with an average gross profit per sale. It then became a matter of 
developing ways and means of achieving increased added value per sale, a pro-
cess that drew on the combined input of branch personnel, who responded 
accordingly to achieve outstanding results.

Chapter 7 | Wholesaler Nets $2.5M in 10+ Months

It was also revealing to hear from the branch managers at the quarterly work-
shops the different methods reps used to boost the added value per sale, 
knowing their results would be published on the notice board and promul-
gated in the company newsletter.
An interesting aspect of this case was the extensive monthly reporting system 
that had been established under the previous owners, a multinational group 
with several hundred subsidiaries, each providing a monthly Board Pack cov-
ering traditional financial statements, aging of accounts receivables, details of 
staffing, pertinent comments from each branch, and so forth. But there was 
nothing about number of sales made, average sale, or gross profit per sale, 
whether overall or by branch or representative.6
Following my return as chairman, the system of weekly feedback of number 
of sales and average gross profit per sale was reinstated, much to the initial 
skepticism of some board members. However, the time came when one of the 
first questions at the commencement of board meetings was, “How are we 
going with TARI?”
The following real-life case study of a small retailer illustrates what can happen 
when focus is sustained day by day on the two key drivers of activity—number 
of sales and $ rate (gross profit contribution per sale).
6Table 1-2 in Chapter 1 illustrates a simple format for tracking weekly results for 
comparison with a target.

Jeweler’s 
Changed Focus 
Turns Red into 
Black
Dependent on passing-tourist trade, this jeweler 
found it impossible to do more than cover 
costs, let alone make a profit
I was conducting interviews with clients of a well-established accounting 
­practice, following a client seminar the previous day. The owner of a jewelry 
shop had requested an interview session.
He was having trouble. Sales volume was up last year, but the bottom line 
showed a loss. Discounting had been too high. Given its location on a ­20-minute 
tourist stopover, it was perhaps understandable that the focus tended to be 
on a sale at any price. Nevertheless, it was thought that next year, things would 
be better because of a potential pickup in tourism.

“I don’t know why I put my name down for an interview, really,” he said. “Our 
problem can only be solved by more tourist buses. So how can you help us?”
“I can’t help you with the jewelry side of the business,” I replied, “but I can help 
you with the management side if you care to cooperate in the TARI process 
that I spoke about yesterday.”
“What’s that?” the husband and wife said in unison, despite the fact I had 
explained it at length during the client seminar the previous evening.
“It’s essentially a matter of focusing on two key performance indicators that 
have been found to make all the difference between success and mediocre 
performance in business.”
“Tell us more,” said the husband.
“Well,” I asked, “as a first step, perhaps you can tell me your average sale?”
“Average sale?” He turned to his wife. “What do you reckon?” She shook her 
head. “I guess about $30, more or less.”
“What about the average gross profit contribution per sale?”
“Well,” the jeweler said, “I suppose if the average sale is $30 and the markup 
is 100%, the average gross profit would be $15. But why ask?”
“Because the $15 gross profit is the contribution toward covering your 
expenses and profit,” I replied. “The other $15 covers the cost of purchases 
and, as you are in business for yourself and not for your suppliers, it’s what’s 
left over after the cost of purchases that matters.”
“I don’t get the drift,” said the wife. “What’s the point of knowing the average 
gross profit?”1
“Because,” I replied, “it’s difficult to improve on an amount that you don’t know.”
“Hmmm,” she murmured.
“You can get a close approximation by looking at the cash register sales and 
markups per day, for a selection of, say, six days that you believe to be repre-
sentative of sales and contribution,” I suggested.2
1Gross profit, gross profit contribution, or simply contribution all refer to the amount left 
over from a sale after deducting the cost of goods. It is a “contribution” toward covering 
expenses and profit. Obviously, contribution will be impacted by discounting and/or low 
numbers of sales.
2Markup refers to the amount added on to the cost price to get the sales price. As 
a percentage on cost, it is referred to as markup. Gross profit contribution refers to a 
percentage of the sale price. In dollar terms, gross profit and markup refer to the same 
amount. For example, a ring costing $100 is marked up 100% to sell for $200. The gross 
profit contribution of $100 is calculated by dividing the cost price by the sale price and 
pressing the percentage button ($100 ÷ $200 = 50%).

With some reluctance, the jeweler agreed to forward the sample information 
the following week.
By the time we met again, the accountant had prepared the analysis 
(Table 8-1).
Surprised to see the range in gross profit per sale, the jeweler asked, “Where 
do we go from here?”
I said, “Well, let’s start tracking from tomorrow by comparing the average 
gross profit contribution with a target average contribution per sale. We call 
it TARI, short for target average rate index. It is a benchmark.”
The jeweler nodded, and I continued. “All you need to do is note the sales, 
cost of goods sold, and the number of sales on this format and e-mail it in 
once a week. The accountant will input it to the software and return the 
results back the next day. That will give you an up-to-date fix on where you 
are compared with target.”

3It is worth noting that the sample analysis could have extracted the number of items sold 
per sale, seeing as a sale frequently includes more than one item. In the case of comparing 
two or more retail outlets of similar products, the items per sale can be a very useful 
comparison of merchandising techniques. Volume of sales can be similar, but gross profit 
per sale noticeably different, because one outlet is more conscious of the added value per 
sale than the other.
4The average sale in Table 8-1 is $30.62 ($7,900 ÷ 258); the average number of sales per 
day is 43 (258 ÷ 6 days).

Chapter 8 | Jeweler’s Changed Focus Turns Red into Black
58
The accountant handed him several sheets preprinted with the format.
“What’s my target, then?” the jeweler asked.
“Good question,” I replied. “We need to decide that before you go.”
After projecting the likely expenses and adding a desirable net profit for the 
year ahead, we got to the point of dividing the resulting target gross profit by 
an estimated number of sales to arrive at a TARI (Table 8-2).
“What number of sales shall we target?” I asked.
Raising his eyebrows, the jeweler looked at his wife. “What do you think?” 
he asked her. “I think we’ll hit $500,000 in revenue this year, but how many 
individual sales?”
“Well,” she said, “depending on the tourist buses, some weeks we would have 
over 500 and some weeks under 200. I wouldn’t really know until I checked 
the figures.”
I pointed out the sample analysis in Table 8-1 indicated a daily average of 
43 sales.6 “Assuming you are open for business for, say, 350 days of the year, 
43 multiplied by 350 is 15,050 sales. So let’s target 15,000 sales to start with. 
Once we get some feedback we can adjust targets as required to achieve 
the desired bottom line. As you can see, if our guesses are about right, we’ll 
need an average contribution per sale of about $13.33 to cover expenses and 
­provide a nice profit.”
The accountant reached for the Action Sheet (Table 8-3) and began to spell 
out who was to do what by when.

I asked the accountant to let me know how things developed. However, it was 
several months before we had occasion to speak, and it was then he told me 
the jeweler had turned the corner and had in fact achieved a contribution per 
sale of closer to $14.
Always intrigued at how managers achieve nice boosts to contribution, I asked 
if he would get the jeweler to give his perceptions of what had made the 
difference.
“I’ll try,” he said, “though I doubt we will get a response.” But as it happened,  
a response did come from the accountant within a week or two.
The accountant told me over the phone, “He likes the idea of monitoring 
progress weekly and is currently running ahead of target. The reasons he gives 
are as follows.”
The accountant started to paraphrase an e-mail he was reading:
“Likes the idea of having a yardstick by which to gauge performance on weekly 
basis. It gives his management function some structure. Information obtained 
has assisted in:
Developing product mix (to improve gross profit)
• 
Formulating a pricing policy better reflective of costs
• 
Obtaining better feedback on the effectiveness of  
• 
marketing activity
Obtaining better feedback on effectiveness of sales staff
• 
Obtaining a better understanding of the cycles that affect 
• 
his business
“He believes ‘the process has been valuable and helped increase profit and 
give direction.’”

I subsequently learned the jeweler had stood up at a client taxation seminar 
held by the accountant and spoken enthusiastically of the help he had 
received.
“It was a bit embarrassing, really,” the accountant explained with a smile in  
his voice.
Case Comment
I was fortunate to interview this jeweler in conjunction with an accountant 
familiar with the CBA approach. He did not push for analysis of historical 
data to analyze past performance. He knew from experience the data would 
be fragmented, tax oriented, and unreliable as a guide to targeting future 
performance.
He was also well aware it was best to start with a sample of sales as a basis 
for planning ahead, and then move on to capture actual data going forward, so 
the real picture would emerge over the ensuing weeks.
The sample does not pinpoint productivity in the same way as in a manu-
facturing or service business, where the key activity relates more to man or 
machine hours. Where data is available, it is possible to make comparisons 
with other similar retail businesses to assess staff effectiveness. Known as 
Interfirm Comparison, the data will normally provide an indication of sales 
per person employed.
Many retailers maintain records of number of sales made and can easily derive 
their average sale. However, there are numerous occasions on which discounts 
are applied in an attempt to increase the number of sales and boost the over-
all contribution without realizing the overall impact on the bottom line.
Caught up in day-to-day merchandising, buying and restocking, supervising 
staff, serving customers, banking receipts, and paying bills, it is not difficult to 
lose track of the contribution per sale and in doing so, the bottom line.
A day-by-day comparison of gross profit contribution per sale with TARI, 
together with a comparison of the cumulative number of sales against  
target, kept the jeweler focused and motivated (Table 8-4).

Improving Profit

The effect of failing to complete a record such as Table 8-4 was driven home 
when reviewing client financial statements as part of a one-day workshop with 
some 20 clients.
One of the clients was the proprietor of an upmarket ladies’ boutique. Her 
financial statement indicated no gross profit contribution at all. In other 
words sales equaled purchases; there was nothing left over to cover expenses, 
let alone make a profit.
“How did this come about?” I asked her.
“I don’t really know,” she replied. “It was my first year in business and I wanted 
to make a name for quality and service at reasonable prices.”
“Were you discounting a lot?” I queried.
“Oh yes, it’s a necessity in the boutique business.”
“How much did you mark down when you discounted?”
“Fifty percent mostly,” she said with a naïve smile.
“And how much did you markup purchases?”
“One hundred percent on average, I suppose”

She blushed a deep red.
Later in the day, I spoke to the accountant about her problem. He said he had 
given her some advice about which books to keep when she started. But in 
his view, she couldn’t afford to pay for more than the mandatory annual tax 
return, so he left her alone.
“Well, now she knows what her problem was,” I said. “She should do better 
going forward.”
This brings us to a real-life case study of a small business that drives home the 
importance of maintaining focus on the levers of activity and contribution.

Upmarket Café 
Learns How to 
Stay on Track
Two friends in the hospitality industry open a 
café in an upmarket suburb and hit problems 
on the opening day. Fortunately, they had a 
wise mentor
The day arrived for opening. Jane and Ruth had combined forces to prepare 
for this day, when their new café would open its doors. Everything was brand 
new, from the café building itself to the tables, chairs, cutlery, crockery, and 
sparkling kitchen, replete with the latest equipment and a shining extraction 
flue over a gleaming white cooking range and oven.
They had prepared the menu very carefully. Their café was to be smart and 
casual in line with the suburb’s upmarket image. And the menu had to fit the 
image—gourmet but not exclusively so, with prices pitched to match the type 
of customer they hoped to attract.
In addition to their combined experience as executive chef and assistant man-
ager of a major city hotel, they were particularly fortunate to have a CPA

64
friend, skilled in contribution-based activity analysis, who had insisted they 
prepare a financial projection of their expectations.
Following discussions with wholesale food and beverage suppliers, they made 
a careful research of similar cafés in the city and suburbs to gain an idea of the 
average price per serving.
They decided to plan for an average sale of $10; this would leave them an 
average gross profit contribution per sale of $7 after paying $3, or 30% of the 
$10, for the cost of food and beverage supplies (Table 9-1). Note that these 
were averages; someone spending $20 for lunch is balanced by another buying 
a cup of coffee to go.
Their next step was to work out how many sales or covers they would need 
in order to meet their expenses and make a profit.
Apart from rent, which was a known amount, the balance of expenses such as 
wages, leasing, insurance, repairs and maintenance, replacement of breakages, 
electricity, phones, and so forth, were guesstimates that would need adjust-
ment as the picture became clearer down the track.
Having ignored a full wage for themselves in expenses, they now took account 
of their own needs, as well as including a 25% return on the overall investment 
of $140,000 (Table 9-2).

TARI, to emphasize its benchmark status.

“They were a bit put off when they saw they would need 30,000 servings to 
achieve target. It gave them some sleepless nights,” their CPA mentor informed 
me later. “But when we broke it down into daily bites, they began to relax.”3
Their next step was to decide how many of the year’s 365 days the café would 
open for business. What did the other cafés do? Did they open on public 
holidays, Sundays, Easter, and Christmas? When they thought about this, they 
realized they didn’t really know.
More days of market research was undertaken before they decided the 
café would open for 338 days. They targeted an average daily contribution 
­accordingly (Table 9-3).
The opening day brought a touch of mayhem. Over 150 customers were 
served, one part-time employee failed to turn up, the health inspector con-
demned the flue over the stove, and the dishwasher overflowed across the 
kitchen floor.
As if that were not enough, even though the total contribution for the day 
was well above expectations because of the numbers, they found the average 
contribution per cover was $6.13 compared with the TARI of $7.
Concluding that this was mainly due to the sale of menu items at the lower 
end of the scale and determined to get closer to their TARI of $7, they sat 
down at midnight and rewrote the menu.
Failing to reach the $7 target the next day, they again stayed up late and 
rewrote the menu, and again the third and the fourth nights until they got  
it right.
Eighteen months later, while enjoying a coffee in the café, I asked Ruth how 
things were working out. She told me they now employed six part-time staff

3The joint proprietors were not in a position to realize how fortunate they were to have

and had managed to get the cost of provisions down from 30% to 23% of 
sales by buying directly at the markets. They were still monitoring the  average 
contribution and the number of covers daily and accumulatively as well as 
keeping a firm grip on expenses. She showed me some figures she’d been 
studying that proved she had a good grasp of what it takes to succeed in 
 business (Table 9-4).
Case Comment
While serving gourmet food and brewing top-grade coffee was fundamental 
to the success of this business, the difference from the norm was that the 
proprietors knew the financial outcome they wanted, and what was needed 
to attain it.
Targeting a net profit of $85,000 on top of all expenses to achieve an annual 
gross profit of $210,000, and breaking it down across an estimated number 
of units (covers) into a target contribution per cover, is the easy part of the 
exercise.
The real difficulty is the follow-through.5 Not many show the determination 
of these two proprietors, who were prepared to sit down after a tiring day 
and make it happen.

5As I mentioned in Chapter 5, a well-accepted adage in management consulting is that 
“genius is 20%, implementation 80%.” In other words, there are many brilliant ideas, but the 
battle is only won in following through with the daily discipline of making them happen.

Improving Profit

Sustaining the connection between a cash ring-up and the bottom line calls 
for a disciplined and ongoing commitment. Occasions will arise when the 
value and the point of the exercise will be questioned. It is then we need to 
be reminded of the underlying principle at work.
What exactly is this principle? It was a question that plagued me in my early 
days of working with numerous businesses across the country. To know it 
worked was one thing, but why?
The following real-life case study helped me resolve the “why?”

Diesel Repair 
Shop Rescued 
from Sand-Up- 
Hill Country
A top sales engineer deciding on a change of 
lifestyle takes over a diesel repair business.  
As the business heads into liquidation, his wife 
discovers the way out
After two days’ conducting workshops for 40 business clients of an 
accounting practice, I was ready to fly home, when John, one of the part-
ners, said, “There’s one client I really wanted to attend the workshop.  
He needs it more than any of the others, but he refused on the grounds he 
was too flat-out.”
10
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 10 | Diesel Repair Shop Rescued from Sand-Up-Hill Country

The accountant sighed, then said, “Fact is, he is heading down the tubes faster 
than a rabbit down a burrow and needs help badly. When his wife rang to 
apologize, I told her if she could get him into the office at 7:00 a.m., I would 
try to persuade you to stay another night.”
He went on to tell me the client and his wife had sold their city home two 
years prior to buying a diesel repair business with a three-bedroom home and 
a few acres of land attached, mortgaging themselves heavily in the process.
The husband had been a sales engineer with a major company in the city, but 
he loved to get his hands dirty playing with diesel engines. Unless a miracle 
occurred, it looked like they would be bankrupt within a matter of weeks.
“Hmm,” I said. “Sounds as though he’s in sand-up-hill country.” Although trying 
to sleep in a motel room fronting a noisy highway was no inducement, I agreed 
to stay the extra night.
In the morning, I headed for the conference room at John’s office and found 
the couple already seated at the table, the wife making small talk with John. It 
was obvious from the outset the husband was not interested in advice from a 
so-called expert and resented being there.
In his mind, the solution to their financial problems lay back in the workshop 
fixing up diesel engines of trucks and fishing boats. That is where the action 
was, and that is where the money was to be made if they were to have any 
chance at all at clawing back their debt-ridden business.
His wife smiled an apology for him, as he sat hunched over the table, head in 
hands.
“How busy are you?” I asked.
She said, “We are very busy.”
“Leaving out the cost of parts, what do you charge for an hour’s work? “
“Thirty dollars,” she said.
“How many hours are you open for work in the average week?”
“Oh, I don’t know exactly,” she replied, “but he works very long hours.”
“Well let’s say 60 hours a week, or 3,000 hours a year,” I ventured.
“He works day and night and all weekends” she said, nudging him to respond. 
He emitted a faint groan.
I wrote on a sheet of paper in front of them:
3,000 hours × $30 = $90,000
“Did you get anything like this last year?”
“Oh no!” she exclaimed. “Nothing like that.”

“You actually billed $42,000,” said John, looking at the accounts. “$12,000 for 
the cost of parts and $30,000 for labor.”
“We certainly didn’t!” she said adamantly.
“Well, you did bill $42,000. You were paid $22,000 and the balance of $20,000 
is in accounts receivable,” said John.
“Accounts receivable?” she queried. “Do you mean farmers?” referring to the 
great majority of their customers.
“If you billed $30,000 for labor, and worked 3,000 hours, either you must have 
charged closer to $10 an hour, or some 2,000 hours were not billed,” I said.
“No,” she replied. “I do all the billing, and we never charge less than $30 an 
hour.”
“In that case, you charged out only 1,000 hours to bill $30,000—or roughly 20 
hours a week. You must have many interruptions?” I quietly suggested.
“Oh yes, the phone never stops,” she said.
“Don’t you take messages?”
“Yes, but they’re all urgent and they want to talk to him right away.”
I wrote PHONE on a sheet.
“Any other interruptions?”
“Oh yes, the farmers,” she said.
“What about the farmers?” I asked.
“Well, they walk straight into the workshop and start talking. Maybe they want 
an exhaust pipe welded or something. He has to stop what he is doing and 
attend to them and afterwards they say, ‘How much?’ and he says, ‘A couple 
of dollars’ and they say, ‘Put it on the account.’
“And farmers do talk slowly,” she added as an afterthought.
I wrote FARMERS on the sheet.
“Anything else?”
“Well, there’s the garage mechanics,” she said.
“What about them?”
“They come straight into the workshop and ask for advice.”
“Why do they do that?”
“Well, he’s a top diesel man, the best in the region. He can pick a problem in an 
engine as the truck comes up the hill to the workshop, just by listening to it.”

She looked at her husband with a touch of pride. Hunched over the table, he 
was silently shaking his head, anxious to be back in sand-up-hill country.
“Do you mean he can do the work in half the time of the average mechanic?” 
I asked.
“A quarter,” she said.
“In that case,” I replied, “he could charge $60 an hour and still be cheaper than 
the average mechanic.”
“Bullshit!” rang through the air like a shotgun, expressing pent-up disgust and 
disagreement over what was taking place, as though to suggest that if he 
charged $60 an hour he would be laughed out of business overnight.
Seeking a solution to what seemed to be a hopeless situation, I addressed  
the wife.
“Do you think that if the interruptions could be fixed, such as putting netting 
around the workshop to force farmers and garage mechanics through the 
office entrance, and getting customers to realize he will take messages and 
ring them back after say, 4:00 p.m., that you could extract 7 billable hours a 
day?” I asked.
“If you could do that for a 5-day week, plus say 5 hours on Saturday, it would 
mean 40 billable hours. And if you upped the $30 to $40, that would bring in 
$1,600 a week or close to $80,000 a year from hours charged.”
She nodded somewhat uncertainly. “If something could be done about the 
interruptions, I suppose we could.”
I went to the whiteboard and laid out the plan (Table 10-1).

She smiled, and I wasn’t sure whether she was merely being polite or maybe 
glimpsing a possible means of escape from a situation that was threatening the 
demise of what had once been a happy family unit.

We used an Action Sheet  (Table 10-2) to spell out who was to do what. She 
agreed to accept responsibility for extracting the 40 hours and billing at aver-
age contribution rate of $40 a week plus the cost of parts. John elected to

Saying goodbye to John later, I expressed a sense of my inadequacy concerning 
the interview. The wife in particular, I felt, was expecting a lot more from the 
visiting “expert.”
A few months later, I bumped into John at a conference. “How are they going?” 
I asked.
“Keeping their noses in front. The simple formula seems to be working,” said 
John with a smile.
About 18 months later, John told me they were out of their troubles and 
going well.
“By the way,” he asked, “what did you mean when you told me he was in 
sand-up-hill country?”
I said, “That’s the place where you shovel all day with a shovel full of holes. 
It’s not very productive, but you do go home feeling something good must 
have happened, because you are exhausted from a hard day’s work.”
“Oh, I see.” said John. “Sounds like a typical tax practice to me.”

Case Comment
Because this particular interview took place very early in my outreach to 
business, some time passed before I came to understand and grasp the impor-
tance of what had transpired.
In reviewing the interview, I recalled the target set for the wife was a weekly 
one. That was a little unusual bearing in mind that at the time, I only thought 
in terms of monthly feedback.1
I think it was because I couldn’t imagine her informing her husband on the 
last day of the month, probably around midnight as he eased his tired body 
between the sheets, that he had only completed 140 hours this month and 
would need to do 180 next month to catch up.
Apart from the unlikelihood of catching up on a 20-hour backlog, I could only 
guess his response to such an approach. However, there was a good chance of 
catching up on a week’s deficit of, say, 4 hours.
Weekly feedback was obviously important and that would have played a part 
in their recovery, although that in itself was not an adequate explanation for 
the turnaround. There was something more, and it only occurred to me some 
months later.
In addition to ordering parts, preparing invoices, chasing debtors, handling 
demands of the bank and suppliers, coping with phone calls, and other numer-
ous events in the day-to-day life of business, she was also chief cook and 
bottle washer, bed maker, and mother to two small children. She was doing 
everything she could as best as she could, and all the time fighting a growing 
sense of depression as she saw their life savings fading away with no light at 
the end of the tunnel.
The truth was that although every activity mattered in one way or another, she 
had no awareness of the key activity fundamental to their survival: 40 billable  
hours at $40 a week.
It was only when she focused on extracting 7 billable hours a day from her 
husband and invoicing them out at the rate of 40 hours a week plus cost of 
parts that the business began to get on track.
The term Contribution-Based Activity encapsulated the concept: the contribution  
being $40 and the activity 40 billable hours. Simple enough, yet so fundamentally  
important, as the garment manufacturer was to discover in the next chapter.
1Because I had been nurtured on traditional financial statements, the importance of weekly 
feedback did not really take root so easily. I had thought my push for more frequent 
feedback of quarterly and even monthly statements, comparing actual with budget, was a 
fairly advanced concept at the time!

Caught up in the traditional approach to 
pricing, the owner and sales manager are 
excited about applying the concepts opened up 
by CBA/TARI.
A partner of the accounting practice drove me to his client’s clothing factory and 
introduced me to a smilingly alert owner and his attractive designer wife. After  
the formalities and a tour of the factory, we settled down in the conference room.
“How do you price your garments?” I asked.
“Well, we go to the larger retail outlets and check the selling price of say, a 
pair of shorts, then we’ll come back and work out how much we can make 
them for in addition to making a profit for us as well as the retailer.”
The owner put several costing sheets on the table. Each listed the garments 
made, the material type and size, along with the type of accessories, such as 
buttons, zippers, cotton thread, buckles, and so forth.

A percentage was added to the cost of material and accessories, and a rate 
per minute was applied to the time. The result was known as “the cost,” to 
which a 40% markup was then applied. Table 11-1 provides an example.

“Why 40 percent markup?” I asked.
“That’s to cover overhead and profit,” he replied.
“And do you find the overhead and profit are being covered as the year pro-
gresses?” I queried.
“Well, not really, I guess. That’s one of the reasons we are having this chat!”1
“How many are employed in making the garments?”
“We employ 30 people full time as well as subcontractors.”
“What level of productivity are you getting from the in-house staff?”
“We have the completed garments tallied each day and know exactly how 
many minutes have been put into them. It works out to 7 hours and 44 minutes  
of an 8-hour day, or 93 percent,” he said proudly.”2
Ninety-three percent was surprising. I asked, “You’re sure the estimated 
times for garments are not too generous?”
1 Applying 40% markup to a garment is based on the assumption it will cover overhead and 
profit. Obviously, if the cost of garments is down due to less demand or cheaper materials, 
the 40% markup will only partially cover overhead and profit; thus the need for tracking 
weekly and accumulatively to compare actual results with target.
2It is interesting to note that the financial impact of the daily and accumulated tally 
of garment numbers in the factory will only be reflected in the monthly financial and 
management account summaries presented toward the middle of the following month to 
which the data refers. That makes it difficult to correct course in a timely fashion.

77
“No,” he said. “We test the times across several mock-ups to work out the 
best way of handling the flow of work beforehand.”
I continued. “It appears the subcontractors produce about two-thirds of the 
output at a rate of 20 cents a minute.”
The accountant chimed in. “That’s right—the 20 cents takes into account both 
in house and out of house production.
“I see,” I said. “Let’s see what the average gross profit contribution per minute 
was last year.” I went to the whiteboard (Table 11-2).

After a moment, the accountant spoke. “Are you including the subcontractors 
as part of labor expense?”
“Yes,” I replied.
“Why? Shouldn’t you include the cost of subcontractors with the cost of 
materials?”
It was a good point; subcontractors would normally be ranked as suppliers to 
a business.
3Contribution refers to the amount left over from a sale after paying the supplier. Normally 
referred to as gross profit or gross profit contribution, it is used frequently throughout this 
book to emphasize the reality that a business is not in business to pay a supplier, but to 
cover its own expenses and make a profit.
4The two key drivers of any business relate to billed units of activity multiplied by the 
average contribution per unit. A unit in this business—garment making—refers to a minute 
of time. Thus a reference to unit-contribution refers to the contribution per minute. In 
retailing, by contrast, a unit will refer to a sale or cash ring-up; in manufacturing and service, 
a unit will normally refer to a production- or machine-hour.
5Includes the subcontractors at $1.2 million (6,000,000 minutes × 20 cents).

“Normally I would agree with you,” I replied. “But on this occasion, the sub-
contractors are supplying 6 million or two-thirds of the 9 million minutes 
driving output. At 20 cents a minute—or $12 an hour—they are being paid 
much the same wage as the in-house staff. Apart from that, I am presuming 
some of the garments you produce are made by a combination of in-house 
and out-of-house?”
The accountant’s brow furrowed in thought as the owner nodded agreement.
I continued. “Let’s see how 43 cents unit-contribution compares with the 
unit-contribution in a sample of the current range of garments,” I suggested, 
drawing up columns on the whiteboard, as they made ready to call out the 
numbers for Table 11-3.

“We’ll take the cost of materials from the invoice sale price and divide the 
resulting contribution by the number of minutes to make. That will give us a 
fix on the unit-contribution for comparison with last year’s unit-contribution 
average of 43 cents.”
The owner scratched his head. “How come we have an overall average  
contribution of 43 cents a minute compared with a range of up to 70 cents 
in the sample?”
“Doesn’t the 43 cents depend on the number of units sold in each style, so 
that if more are sold of, say, styles 144 and 153, the average will fall?” replied 
the accountant.

Improving Profit
79
We agreed it might be informative to multiply the number sold in each  
style by the minutes and calculate the total contribution per garment style 
rather than the contribution per single garment. However, given the software 
limitations, it would be a lengthy process. So we moved on to consider  
the significance of the variety of gross profit contributions per minute stemming 
from the different garments.
We called in the sales manager to take part in the discussion. He was espe-
cially intrigued by the range of numbers. Pointing to style number 167 and 
its contribution of $18 per garment, he asked, “Does that mean if I sell 1,000 
units of 167, we get a gross profit contribution of $18,000?”
I nodded.
“If I'd known that last week,” he continued, “I could have won an order for 
1,000 of 167. As it is, we lost it because we could not get the price down 
enough to beat the competition.”
“Why?” I asked.
“Our policy only allowed me to drop 10 percent, and I needed to drop 20 
percent. But even with a 20 percent price reduction, we would still have made 
a gross profit contribution of $14,400.”
He looked over at the owner. “Boss, this is great stuff!” he exclaimed. “It's 
going to make all the difference to our sales. Now I’ll know what to push and 
what not to push.”
Pointing to style number 114, with a contribution of $7, he asked, “If I sell a 
thousand of 114, we get a gross profit of $7,000, even though both have taken 
up much the same time to make?”
I assured him that was the case and explained that, as long as he kept the 
overall contribution target in view, to which all styles contributed, they would 
stay on track. The key for an increased bottom line was to push the styles 
with the higher contribution and work out ways and means of raising the unit 
contribution from the lower contributors by better buying of materials or 
more efficient processes.
With that, we agreed to project an increased net profit for the year ahead, 
upping the target average unit-contribution from 43 cents to 48 cents.  
I explained that we would refer to the 48 cents as the target average rate 
index—TARI—a benchmark against which the contribution per minute from 
the various styles would be compared, quote by quote or invoice by invoice.
“But,” the accountant said, “our expenses will no doubt rise next year. Even 
with a contribution of 48 cents, maybe we won’t improve profit.”

Chapter 11 | Garment Maker Multiplies Net Profit by 700%

“Good point,” I said. “Let’s take a closer look.” We ran through all the expense 
items from the previous year. Maintaining staff numbers at the same level, 
we ended up increasing last year’s $3,800,000 in expenses by 5 percent to 
$3,990,000.
We also assumed we could maintain in-house productivity at 93% and  
produce the same output of 9 million units as per the previous year.  
Table 11-4 shows the target plan.

“That’s a $230,000 increase on last year’s net profit of $100,000. It’s a bit opti-
mistic, don't you think?” the owner queried.
“I reckon we can get it,” said the sales manager, smiling enthusiastically. “Now 
that I know where we are going, we can soon work out what we need to sell 
to get there.”
“Just for fun,” said the owner, “let’s see what kind of sales we’d need if we 
remain stuck at the same 43 cents.” I sketched out what unit activity, mea-
sured in number of minutes, would be required to achieve the same net profit 
at last year’s unit contribution of 43 cents. (Table 11-5)

81
Remaining at 43 cents per unit, and targeting the same net profit as in 
Table 11-3, called for close to an additional 2 million units to achieve the 
same outcome.
“I’m shocked,” said the owner.
“Yes,” I said. “It really drives home the importance of the two levers—activity 
and contribution. If you can’t get one to move, try the other. But in this case it 
looks far more likely that you’d be able to get the 48 cents’ contribution than 
having to increase output by a couple of million minutes.”
I explained the key to success was to capture invoiced sales, contribution, and 
unit output, weekly and accumulatively, and then compare them to the target.8
“How,” asked the owner, “might we get from 43 cents to 48?”
I said, “You have several options at your disposal:
“Push for more sales of those garments contributing 
• 
more than 43 cents,
“Review times to make garments contributing less than 
• 
43 cents, or
“Review material supplies to reduce buying price where 
• 
possible.”
During the ensuing three years, the firm went on to treble sales to $18 million, 
boosting net profit to $1 million, and using the funds to build a state-of-the-art 
factory containing the very latest technology coupled with outstanding work-
ing conditions for the employees.
It was then that import duty was reduced to the point where cheaply  
produced garments from overseas created such pressure on prices that, had 
the proprietors lacked a clear idea of where to direct their energies, they 
would have gone under. As it was, in order to sustain profitable growth, they 
subcontracted offshore.

The folly of inflexible discount policies that inhibit sales

The clarity achieved by separating the cost of materials from

The contribution per unit per style of garment in Table  11-3 came as a  
surprise to a management steeped in a traditional approach to costing and 
pricing based on percentage markups on materials and labor prior to adding 
a further 40% markup to cover overhead and profit. The approach masks the 
contribution per unit of activity—in this case a minute of time. In doing so, it 
obscured an important decision-making tool.
In the next chapter, you’ll find a real-life case study that reinforces the method-
ology underlying invoice analysis. It explains how gross profit contribution per 
key unit of activity is obtained from the analysis, and how that information can 
be used to pinpoint the actual level of activity (productivity) in a business.

The production manager put the problem down to the new computer system 
installed at great expense 18 months earlier. The consultant that sold the deal 
as being the latest and the best on the market was still working on it. The 
software pumped out information by the ream, but the detail was so extensive 
that it masked a clear view.
The marketing manager felt the problem lay in production, which, ever since 
the new computer system was installed, hadn’t kept time sheets. As he saw 
it, there seemed to be no control over employee hours anymore, resulting in 
quotes that had become increasingly uncompetitive.
The accountant was of the opinion the new system was really quite effec-
tive because it could give any variety of report. The problem, in his view, 
was that the consultant had yet to complete certain adjustments. As a 
result, he was unable to extract relevant information about contractual 
commitments. He agreed the loss was serious, but in his view it lay outside 
his area of responsibility. He believed the problem was most likely due to a 
declining economic environment.
I happened to be in the accountant’s office when one of the company’s sales 
representatives walked in to discuss a potential order. Following an exchange 
of formalities, I asked him how he worked out the price for a job.
“I have a price list for the parts and the costing section works out the hours 
needed to set up and install the system,” he replied.
“Do you compare the quoted times with the actual times?” I asked the 
accountant.
“Not really,” he replied. “The production manager says the work is carried out 
as quickly and efficiently as it can be done, so he doesn’t take any notice of the 
quoted times, although he does input the completed times.”
“And the system doesn’t carry out a check of actual times with quoted times?”
“Not yet. The consultants say they are working on it.”
My discussions with the owner revealed a different perspective from that of 
the accountant. He said the business was needed a new plant and equipment 
if it was to remain competitive, but that called for capital injection. Given the 
state of the company’s accounts, the bank had severely restricted all credit 
facilities.
I reviewed all the financial reports provided and noted that they summarized 
results in traditional management-accounting format, complete with variances 
from budget for labor, Materials, and expenses. Even with interpretation, the 
reports lacked relevance to the pressing needs of management for a forest-
level view.

The previous year’s financials revealed that a gross profit contribution of  
$5 million, calculated as sales less cost of materials, failed to cover expenses, 
resulting in a net loss of $200,000.
I asked for a representative sample of invoices that would list the sales price, 
the cost of purchases, and preferably the quoted rather than the time-sheet 
hours (Table 12-1).1
1Quoted hours are invariably less than time-sheet hours. See chapter 5 for an example of 
what tends to happen with time-sheet hours.

The analysis revealed an average gross profit contribution per unit-hour of 
$155.
Dividing the total contribution of $5 million by $155 per hour provided  
a close guesstimate of hours charged out for the period (Table 12-2).

The CEO looked shocked that at 50% productivity, the company was billing 
for only four hours of labor each eight-hour day. The marketing manager nod-
ded agreement, the production manager frowned in disbelief, and the accoun-
tant queried the reliability of the invoice sample.
I pointed out that regardless of the reliability of the sample, there was little 
to be gained by spending time and money delving into historical records. 
The true situation would be revealed over the next few weeks as we tracked 
actual results against target.
It was time to plan ahead by projecting expenses, adding the desired net profit 
and targeting an increase in productive hours from four to five hours per 
eight-hour day (Table 12-3).
Because of the targeted increase in chargeable hours, the target average  
unit-contribution—referred to as the target average rate index or TARI2—of 
$135, was $20 under the average gross profit per hour of $155 from the invoice 
sample.
This led to heated debate about which benchmark should be adopted: $135 
or $155?
I pointed out that it would be unwise to track against a benchmark lower than 
the one showing up in the sample. To put their minds at ease, we analyzed an 
additional sample of 20 invoices and confirmed the initial sample by coming 
up with $155.
2So named to identify its status as a benchmark or index; not to be confused with “cost.”

Improving Profit
87
Using $155 and improving productivity from four to five hours a day would 
provide an additional contribution of $800,000, boosting overall contribution 
from $5,200,000 to $6,300,000.
“I don’t see how we are going to get the work,” said the CEO, to a chorus 
of agreement.
“Why don’t we just start and see what happens?” I suggested, knowing from 
experience that once they started tracking quotes against the TARI bench-
mark of $155 and an average weekly target of 905 hours, they would achieve 
the competitive advantage necessary to secure additional work—subject of 
course to getting the supervisor and other key players on their side, a process 
that called for weekly action meetings.3
It was time to introduce the Action Sheet, without which nothing of conse-
quence would happen (Table 12-4).

Tracking invoiced sales, gross profit, and hourly rates weekly and accumula-
tively slowly but surely brought the business back on track.4
Quotations were compared with the TARI benchmark for the contribution 
rate per unit-hour before they were sent out and again before they were 
committed to production. The managers closely examined rates that showed 
less than $155 to see if (a) the hours could be reduced by examining ways and 
means of improving efficiency or (b) the cost of purchases could be reduced.
By the end of six months, the company started to earn a profit and by year’s end, 
profit was close to $350,000, or $50,000 in excess of the 12-month target.
3For more on the role of action meetings, see Chapter 22.

Chapter 12 | Switchboard Manufacturer Climbs into the Black 
88
Asked what they put the improvement down to, the CEO gave the following 
reasons:
Confidence when they quote because they can compare 
• 
hourly quote rates with TARI
Speed, because they get weekly as well as accumula-
• 
tive results each Friday after closing the books on 
Wednesday
Knowing the bottom line when quoting puts them well ahead of their 
competitors.
Case Comment
The company appeared to be a busy enterprise that manufactured spe-
cialized switchboards for sale as well as contracting to install, repair, and 
maintain them.
The receptionist gave a strong impression of efficiency; the corridors leading 
to the offices were brightly painted and the floor tiles gleamed from their 
early morning polish.
The offices were equally impressive, as was the welcome from the CEO and 
line management. At that first meeting, there were no overt signs of a dysfunc-
tional management pulling in different directions. That only became apparent 
during individual interviews.
The fact that each of the line managers had a different view as to why the 
company was unprofitable was a clear indication of poor cohesion, inevitably 
leading to a lack of direction and focus.
There was a sense that the new software being installed would provide all 
the answers. But as is so often the case, without cohesive input by the key 
players, new software only serves to exacerbate rather than eradicate an 
existing weakness.
In any event, the software, programmed to deliver feedback according to 
accepted accounting methodology, albeit more expeditiously than its fore-
runner, was already proving to be a problem by virtue of the sheer volume 
of output.
The accountant tacitly accepted a situation in which quoted times for  
jobs were never matched with actual times in the time sheets because the 
production manager had no confidence in the quoted times. This was not 
atypical of manufacturing businesses, where output is dependent on the  
production manager, who becomes highly dependent on his subordinate engi-
neers as years pass and he fails to keep up with the latest technology.
o

The invoice analysis brought a touch of reality, as management viewed the 
range of unit-contributions and came to realize the level to which produc-
tivity had fallen. With confidence shaken, it was timely to plan ahead and 
develop a target.
While acknowledging the feasibility of improving productivity from four to five 
billable hours per eight-hour day, they were tentative about the likely level of 
demand for the increased output.
Without weekly meetings and action assigned to whom and by when on an 
Action Sheet, there was no way they would have brought off such a successful 
turnaround. Knowing it would be fatal to walk away and leave them to com-
plete the Action Sheet, I arranged to be at the first four meetings, following 
which I had the secretary e-mail copies weekly.5
Step by step, as line managers began to get weekly feedback6 and could see the 
impact of their decisions, they began to cohere and operate as a team.
The growing recognition of interdependence brought a deeper appreciation of 
one another’s roles and the problems encountered. For example, armed with 
a newfound understanding of contribution as distinct from sales, marketing  
initially discounted sales with a unit-contribution7 in excess of $155.
This in turn put more pressure on production, pushing the plant into over-
time, increasing wages, and lowering the overall average unit-contribution.
The weekly action meeting brought these matters and other problems into 
the light and became instrumental in resolving them. The company moved 
forward as a result.
Businesses dependent on production output tend to defer to the produc-
tion manager, often to the detriment of the bottom line. The impact of this 
becomes more apparent in the next chapter.
5Chapter 22 provides examples of the quiet yet persistent pressure of the Action Sheet 
on participants to complete a task they have agreed to undertake.
6 The accountant had arranged for weekly and accumulative analysis of invoices to compare 
the actual unit-contribution with TARI.

Immersed in baking and distributing  
750 products from meat pies to crumpets,  
it came as a shock when management caught 
a glimpse of the woods from down in the trees.
The management committee, composed of department heads, sat around the 
boardroom table. The CEO had called them together at 10 minutes’ notice to 
hear what I had to say, and it was apparent they resented the short notice.
He invited me to speak freely and openly about my findings to date. As I had 
been walking around and speaking with a variety of managers and supervisors 
for the past two days, I had already met most of them. But the gray-haired lady

closeted in a back office, from whom I had gathered the details resulting in the 
information I was about to use, was not among them.
“I have taken a look at the range of 750 products, and I’d like to demonstrate 
a technique which identifies potential winners and losers and gives a clear 
message to marketing and production in the process.” I looked around the 
table to gauge interest.
“To start with, perhaps you could give me some idea of what you consider to 
be your most profitable product?” I asked.
“Crumpets” was the unhesitating and almost universal response. It was under-
standable; the winter season was in full swing and crumpets sold well in cold 
weather. They were a comparatively cheap food to produce, being little more 
than a light flour mixture pitted with holes and passed over a gas heater at 
the rate of 12,000 an hour.
“And the next most profitable?” I asked
Answers varied, ranging from meat pies, lemon tarts, and sandwich cake to 
sausage rolls.
“Well, ignoring the quantities sold for the moment and looking purely at the 
gross profit contribution per production man-hour, sausage rolls make the 
largest contribution at $250 per man-hour, followed by meat pies at $200, 
crumpets at $77, with sandwich cake as low as $25.”
They sat and stared in stunned silence as I wrote the amounts on the 
whiteboard.
“How did you arrive at that information?” the CEO asked.
“The costing lady had all the information about the man-hours required to 
achieve each product as well as the cost of ingredients. It was a matter of get-
ting a simple program written to extract the cost of ingredients, and dividing 
the resulting contribution by the number of hours involved. The result was 
gross profit contribution per man-hour.”
“I’m sorry, but I still don’t quite understand,” said the CEO
I responded, “Well let’s look at meat pies. A pie wholesales at 68 cents and the 
ingredients cost 18 cents, leaving a contribution of 50 cents. The plant churns 
out 10,000 an hour, which makes for a contribution of $5,000 per hour. With 
25 staff involved in hands-on production of pies, the contribution works out at 
$200 per man-hour.” I wrote it out on the whiteboard (Table 13-1).

Improving Profit
93
The CEO looked puzzled. “I think I can grasp that, but how could the 
crumpets’ contribution be so low considering they use a lot less labor 
than meat pies?”
“I agree,” the production manager said in a tone of annoyance. He had 
been experiencing difficulty holding back. “The fact is, the contribution on 
most of the products is much the same based on 70 percent markup on 
factory cost.”
“What do you mean by factory cost?” I asked him.
“Ingredients, direct and indirect labor, supervision, power, depreciation on 
plant, repairs, and maintenance, rent, phones, and so on.”
“And how do you apportion these costs to the various products?” I asked.
“Direct costs such as ingredients, power, and labor go to the product and 
the rest are spread in proportion to the direct labor. We also apply a small 
markup to make a factory profit.” He looked around the table before adding, 
“And the factory has never failed to make a profit.”
“You say 70 percent is applied to all factory costs to arrive at the selling price, 
yet the selling price is pretty well dictated by the market, isn’t it?” I asked.
“Mostly it is,” said the CEO, steeped in the traditional approach to costing 
and pricing.
The meeting adjourned for lunch, during which time we went down to the 
crumpet line and saw crumpets being packed by hand as they came off the 
line. “They used to be machine packed into four a pack, but when we went to

six a pack and then eight a pack to meet the competition, we had to use hand 
labor,” said the foreman. “It’s slowed us down quite a bit.” The production 
manager looked stunned.
After lunch, to avoid getting lost in the detail of costing and pricing issues,  
I suggested we look at the matter from a different angle altogether and went 
to the whiteboard.
“The sales target for next year is $30 million. If we take out $10 million for 
ingredients and packaging, we are left with $20 million gross profit. You are 
planning on paying for 220,000 direct labor hours, and you are estimating that 
75 percent of these hours, or 165,000, will be productive.” I wrote it down 
on the whiteboard (Table 13-2) and divided $20 million by 165,000 hours to 
arrive at $121.

“This means that we need an average gross profit contribution of $121 per 
hour. We call it target average rate index, or TARI, to emphasize it is a bench-
mark and not a cost. Do we agree?” I looked around the table to see if they 
were with me.
“I don’t see the point,” grunted the production manager. “Where do factory 
costs, direct or indirect, come into that?”
“Excluding ingredients and packaging, all operational costs plus the planned 
profit are included in the gross profit contribution of $20 million. The $121 is 
the average contribution per hour based on 75 percent productivity. We need 
3In this case, the “unit” of activity is a man-hour. There are numerous activities taking 
place in most businesses, but there is a key driving activity fundamental to the rest; in 
manufacturing, a unit of that activity will normally be a production-hour (whether by man 
or machine). In retailing it will be an invoiced sale or a cash ring-up.

to establish a simple program which will track the output hours as well as 
the contribution per hour. We should be in a position to summarize the data 
weekly and accumulatively and know where we are week to week compared 
with the plan.”
“But what about the considerable variation in contribution from product to 
product that you pointed out?” asked the CEO.
“That’s the very point of the exercise,” I replied, pleased that he had raised 
the matter.
“With the TARI benchmark of $121, we are in a position to compare the 
actual contribution from any combination of the 750 active products and see 
if we can establish a direction for marketing or production or both.”
I pointed to the whiteboard where I had listed the various contribution rates 
per production hour—rolls at $250, meat pies $200, crumpets $77, and sand-
wich cake $25. “Compared with a benchmark of $121 per hour, what are 
these figures telling us?” I asked.
“Flog sausage rolls and meat pies,” said the marketing manager, sensing a pos-
sible removal of the shackles on pricing, which had held back marketing initia-
tives in the past.
“Boost efficiency in crumpets and get out of sandwich cake,” the accountant 
offered.
The production manager had difficulty in restraining himself. “If you think you 
can get more efficiency in the crumpet line short of half a million on new plant, 
good luck to you.”
Using an Action Sheet (Table 13-3), we agreed on who should do what by 
when and concluded the meeting.

On a subsequent visit, I learned that the production manager had resigned to 
spend more time with his family. It was understandable. Overseeing an output 
of 750 products a day would drive most to an early retirement.

Chapter 13 | Baker Identifies W here the Rubber Meets the Road
96
The finance manager had taken refuge in computer printouts, and the market-
ing manager, having won the battle to cull several low-selling products, pushed 
sausage rolls and meat pies and boosted profit to unprecedented levels. The 
CEO was pleased, but wondered why all this had not been explained before. 
It seemed so simple.
An interesting hangover from the traditional management-accounting 
reports surfaced a little further down the track. Based on the new produc-
tion manager’s belief that he could benefit from the available capacity and 
boost meat pie production with only a marginal increase in power costs, 
marketing made a deal—without seeking approval from the accountant—to 
sell meat pies to a supermarket chain at 50 cents, or 18 cents less than the 
normal wholesale price.
One Saturday morning, following a major promotional campaign, 120,000 pies 
sold, and the customers were still screaming for more when an ashen-faced 
production manager decided enough was enough, and threw the switch on a 
pastry-encrusted plant and a dough-splattered crew.
After deducting additional power and ingredient costs, the contribution to the 
bottom line from the exercise approximated $35,000.
However, the software, programmed to calculate discounts from the whole-
sale selling price of 68 cents, totaled a discount of $21,600 (Table  13-4), 
which in the traditional accounts presentation to the board of directors 
some weeks after the event, indicated that marketing had, in one hit, used up 
the budgeted discount for the whole year, leaving an ugly red deficit in the 
variance column.

Comparison of the net contribution of $35,000 with $36,300 (based on a 
TARI of $121 × 300 production-hours4) suggests the order was worth the 
effort, particularly when taking the favorable publicity into account.
However, from that time on, despite earnest attempts from marketing to 
explain the profitability of the exercise, there was a strict prohibition on 
repeating such an exercise—which, viewed philosophically, only serves to 
highlight the need to get the CEO on one’s side beforehand.
Case Comment
Having established a TARI benchmark of $121 against which the contribu-
tion of each of 750 products could be measured, software was developed 
to extract the contribution from invoiced sales, for weekly and accumula-
tive comparison.5
Sales reps were allocated an annual contribution target broken down to an 
average contribution per week, based on achieving an average contribution 
margin of 67%—the percentage relationship between $30 million sales and 
the $20 million contribution target (Table 13-5).
4Calculated from 25 persons to a shift times 12 hours at the rate of 10,000 pies an hour.

Table 13-5 illustrates a contribution margin of 67%, in line with the overall 
target contribution margin. On paper, the reps would appear to be on target.
However, the same analysis reveals an average unit rate of $95—a cause for 
concern should this become an ongoing trend. The sales manager would want 
to know what products BK is promoting compared with LP. It would be neces-
sary to follow through on a weekly basis for the reps to grasp the need for 
pushing products exceeding the TARI of $121 per hour.

7Although paid by the company, auditors check the accuracy and integrity of the financials 
on behalf of the company’s shareholders and lenders. If they undertake management advice 
for the company they audit, they tread a fine line between the role of auditor and adviser, 
where conflicts of interest can and do arise—a conflict well portrayed in the rise and fall 
of Arthur Andersen. During an audit, although they are technically well placed to identify 
actual or potential problems and draw them to the attention of the company, their focus 
is strictly defined by the audit brief.
Table 13-5 also highlights the benefit of measuring performance against 
TARI, in this case based on production -hours in addition to a desired con-
tribution margin.
This business operated state-of-the-art software when it came to taking 
phone orders. Twenty-one phone receptionists keyed in orders received 
from school, factory, and office canteens, hotels, supermarkets, milk bars, cafés, 
delicatessens, and the like.
The software extracted the ingredients required for each order and accumu-
lated a total ingredient quantity of flour, meat, sugar, butter, eggs, milk, and so 
forth, ready for the 7 p.m. arrival of bakers and pastry cooks.
As products streamed off the production lines, they were sorted and 
matched with orders, allocated into districts, and sent for dispatch to wait-
ing delivery vehicles.
Without knowledge of the hours required per product, there was no simple 
way of identifying the level of productivity at which the plant operated.
Had it not been for the conscientious gray-haired costing clerk, hidden 
away in a small back office and neglected by all and sundry as a bygone relic, 
the information about costs of ingredients, packaging, and standard produc-
tion times would not have been accessible without major expenditure of 
time and effort.
During one of my visits, a young, fresh-faced audit team from a major account-
ing firm proudly explained that their audit software was capable of identifying 
up to 96% confidence level in a sample audit check. They also pointed out a 
hardware box sitting on top of the computer mainframe. It was extracting 
selected data for a business intelligence system installed by the consulting arm 
of their firm as a means of providing management with various key perfor-
mance indictors about the business.
Asked if they knew how the actual output compared with the potential output 
of the plant, they shrugged their shoulders. Asked if they knew how much 
waste product was dumped into a huge bin in the factory for removal twice a 
week, they had no idea. Neither item was on their audit checklist.7

Improving Profit
99
Nor, it seemed, was it on anyone’s check list within the company. While the 
dump truck’s collection of waste was known, the amount dumped was not. 
In the time available, I was unable to find out if there was a provision in the 
accounts for wastage.
Inquiries made of the dump truck operator revealed that 12 tons of waste 
product was dumped weekly. Composed mainly of strips of dough trimmed 
from long lines of pie pastry and sausage rolls, the amount was calculated to 
be worth close to $1 million, or 5% of total cost of ingredients. Whether the 
accounts provided for 5% of wastage of ingredients, I was unable to ascertain 
in the time available.
In the following chapter, we look at pricing as related to productivity through 
the eyes of a typical architectural practice.

Architectural 
Practice

A variety of hourly charge rates based on 
salary levels, coupled with dysfunctional time 
sheets, were creating a major distraction until 
the partners were shown a new way.
Operating an upmarket architectural practice in the heart of the city, the 
partners of Smith and Co. were experiencing problems finding enough cash 
to pay wages and other expenses. They put this down to delays in sending out 
invoices for design and supervision work already carried out.
Believing the cause of the problem to be related to poor time-sheet control, 
they had gone out of their way to employ a strongly recommended clerical

assistant to ensure all time sheets were maintained correctly and on time. 
Despite all their efforts, daily completion of time sheets was still falling way 
behind.
Again and again, right in the middle of major design work, they had to put 
down their tools and spend valuable time checking work in progress in order 
to justify billing clients. In the eyes of the firm’s partners, what was needed was 
an improved time-sheet system. They asked me if I would be able to help.
It didn’t long to realize the time sheets were only a symptom of a deeper 
underlying problem.

The planned total charge-out times for partners and staff members amounted 
to 14,800 or 65% of paid hours. Multiplying the hours by the relevant hourly 
charge rates resulted in potential fees of $2,007,000.
Comparing potential fees with actual fees highlighted the real problem 
underlying the scarcity of cash (Table 14-2).

The fact that it took only a few minutes to demonstrate their productivity was 
running at a low level only exacerbated their discontent with the performance 
of the practice.
Rather than spend time looking back over somewhat fragmented and unreli-
able data, we agreed it would be more cost efficient to plan ahead and track 
results on a weekly basis. This would provide accurate information as well as 
highlight problem areas inhibiting progress.
I suggested they target an average fee of $142, which I referred to as a target 
average rate index, or TARI, to emphasize its statistical status. A TARI of $142 
for an average weekly billing of 330 hours would ensure a gross revenue close 
to the annual target of $2,102,310 (Table 14-3).

“Not sure we really understand what all that means,” they said.
“It means that you are tracking an average of 330 hours by a TARI of $142 an 
hour weekly. It means that when you price your work in future, you divide the 
anticipated fees by a TARI of $142 to calculate the hours the job should take.”
“But what if we use the juniors more than the seniors? The average rate will 
be much less than $142.”
“It may, if you were able to track the individual hours that closely—which 
hasn't yet been possible despite all your efforts.
“On average, the $142 will be close to the mark. Assume you quote a fee 
of 10 percent of a $2,620,000 estimated construction cost. You divide your 
potential fee of $262,000 by $142 and work out that you need 1,845 hours. 
You project those hours over the various stages of design and supervision and 
commence monitoring the job weekly and accumulatively.” I laid this all out on 
the whiteboard (Table 14-4).

I suggested a weekly meeting of the key players would be necessary to review 
progress. At the meeting, they would need to review the hours spent on a job 
for comparison with the hours allocated. Where the times were in excess of 
expectations, they would estimate the time to complete. The meeting would 
serve to identify constraints and decide how to overcome them in order to 
meet target. It would also help them understand that watching the hours 
spent on a project and comparing it to the target was something that needed 
to become second nature for all in the firm. I laid out a scheme for tracking 
jobs (Table 14-5).

This in turn called for a daily collection of time-sheet hours, without which 
the firm would be back to square one. Recording times in a diary as one or 
two advocated would not ensure daily completion when times were freshly 
in mind.
I introduced the Action Sheet (Table 14-6) as a tried and tested way of getting 
the desired response. Knowing from experience it would take up to three 
weeks to bring about the changes, I arranged to attend the first three meet-
ings to ensure the process grooved in correctly.

The meetings were attended by the two partners and four team leaders 
­heading up the various jobs.
It took three weeks of sustained pressure by the partners to get the message 
through to staff that they needed to be serious about tracking hours before 
the process finally grooved in and control over billings was established.
As focus came to bear on the various jobs, hidden benefits emerged, such as 
a discussion of ways and means of reducing hours by varying the design to 
achieve greater efficiency and still maintain quality. The tone slowly but surely 
changed from one of laissez-faire or “she’ll be right” to one of “how can we 
do this better?”
The firm overshot the annual target net profit by $75,000.
Case Comment
Architects are introduced to the calculation of fees during their university 
years. In essence, they are taught to work out a charge rate by multiplying the 
basic wage by a factor based on the relationship of wages to total revenue.

Chapter 14 | Architectural Practice Eradicates a Malignant Cancer 
106
Thus, a practice with wages of $400,000 and budgeting for a $1 million in 
revenue would multiply each dollar of wage by 2.5. It means that a junior get-
ting, say, $17 an hour would be budgeted to charge out at $42 an hour, while 
a senior getting $100 an hour would be charging $250.
This approach is common to similar professions and is based on a theoretical 
assumption that a fee charged to a client reflects the level of skill and experi-
ence involved. In other words, a junior charging $42 an hour will take roughly 
six times longer than the senior charging $250 an hour.
For a client paying the fee, it is of little consequence who did what as long 
as the job is completed satisfactorily and is in line with the quote. It is of no 
satisfaction to the client to be told a job has gone over quote because a senior 
had to spend more time on it than a junior.
Computerized time sheets with associated charge rates make it a very simple 
matter to print out a list of charge rates on any job at any particular time, 
providing the times are up to date. In the final analysis, there will be additions 
and deductions—known as write-offs—due to poor work, incorrect times, or 
failure to input times, which can create major problems of reconciliation.
Thus the need for:
Weekly meetings with key staff in conjunction with an 
• 
Action Sheet1
Weekly tracking comparing actual times with the target 
• 
on each job
Weekly tracking comparing actual billings with target 
• 
billings2
A TARI benchmark that averages the various charge rates 
• 
and simplifies the process of targeting and tracking, sus-
taining a clear view of the business from down in the 
trees that deals with the infinite complexities attending 
day-to-day events.
Done consistently, these things make it hard to miss target revenue and profit.

Accounting 
Firm Wins by 
Losing a Third 
of Its Fees
Losing a client to a departing staff member 
is an ever-present concern for professional 
firms—a problem this practitioner succeeded 
in overcoming.
When the two partners of Jones & Associates reflected on the profession’s 
advertising slogan, “Not Your Average Accountant,” they considered their 
practice to be well above the average.
They practiced out of an upmarket office and ensured the latest magazines 
were available in a foyer staffed by a chic receptionist. They also offered regular 
seminars on matters related to client concerns, including taxation, retirement, 
15

Chapter 15 | Accounting Firm Wins by Losing a Third of Its Fees
108
financial planning, computerization, management advice, and general consulting. 
Actively involved with community organizations, clubs, and church groups, they 
prided themselves on their marketing outreach.
Two matters, however, caused them nagging concern: the poor state of the 
bottom line when the time came to split profits two ways, and the potential 
loss of clients to departing staff members.
The individual share was only half of what partners of the other main practice 
in town took home. They knew this because of information passed on by the 
software consultant servicing both practices.
They reviewed their hourly charge rates, which were worked out in the tradi-
tional manner by multiplying salaries by 2.5; but as the fees were already higher 
than the other practice, the feeling was that they could not be increased.
This in turn made it difficult to reward existing staff members by paying them 
above-average salaries, a problem exacerbated by the recent departure of a 
long-serving staff member along with three valued clients.
They asked me if I could help.
“What are your total expenses?” I asked them as they handed me a large file 
of financial statements.
“Total expenses for the past year amounted to $2,200,000,” said the junior 
partner.
“And what net profit did you end up with?”
“Close to $200,000, or about $100,000 each before tax,” he added.
“And what surplus or net profit would you like to see to split between the 
two of you?”
“Well, we would like to see $300,000 each before tax, or $600,000 in total. 
Currently we’re not getting anywhere near that.”
I went to the whiteboard (Table 15-1).

“So we are looking for a gross revenue of $3 million?” I asked, adding an 
expected rise in the cost of living index to the expenses and increasing the 
net profit to achieve the desired surplus of $600,000. “How many hours do 
you expect to bill to achieve that in the year?”
“We hope to get at least 64% of paid hours.”
Paid hours for all the firm’s employees totalled 31,250. Multiplied by 64%, the 
target billable hours worked out to 20,000, which divided into $3 million to 
give an average of $150 an hour (Table 15-2).
“It seems you are looking for an average of $150 an hour. Based on a 45-week 
year, it points to weekly average gross fees of 445 billed hours that, multiplied 
by $150, comes to nearly $67,000.”
I explained the target average fee of $150 is best referred to a “target average 
rate index,” or TARI for short, to emphasize it is a benchmark and not a fee 
or a cost.
“Even if we hold expenses down to last year’s amount, I don’t see that we 
can get anywhere near the targeted gross fees,” the senior partner said with 
a sceptical note in his voice. “I think our real problem is having to write off 
a proportion of the invoiced amounts. I wouldn’t be surprised if the total 
amounts to at least 10 percent or even 15 percent of the gross revenue.”
“Yes,” added the junior partner, “some of the work should really be done in 
less time and we really can’t bill the clients for our slow work rate.”
“Well,” I said, “let’s see what last year’s productivity looks like if we apply the 
TARI of $150 to total billings.”

I went to the whiteboard and wrote down the following (Table 15-3):
“I see what you mean about having to write off a proportion of the invoiced 
bills,” I said.
“Exactly,” the senior partner exclaimed. “It seems to me we need to get on 
top of that matter before anything else.”
“That will be no problem,” I responded. “When you are about to bill a client, 
you divide the amount of the bill by the total number of hours spent by the 
various staff members as indicated in the software, and work out the average 
rate achieved.”
I continued: “If it is under $150, you may want to review the time taken. If it is 
over $150, so much the better. Ideally, you will set a target of hours to com-
plete the job before handing the job to a staff member.”
One of the partners wondered whether they then needed to track hours on 
a daily basis.
“Yes,” I said. “By midday each Thursday, you tally up the hours and rates to 
be invoiced out by 5 p.m. Friday in order to meet the hours targeted for the 
week. You write it up on the whiteboard in the staff room. If you look like 
you’re under target, the staff will know what to do, particularly if they are 
placed on a bonus for every hour billed over target.”
I discussed various ways of providing incentives to staff to sustain their inter-
est and loyalty to the firm, and suggested they might think about giving certain 
staffers one-third of fees generated over and above 30 full hours of weekly 
billing.
The junior partner objected. “But that means letting the staff know the details 
of practice billings.”
I smiled. “What they don’t know they make up. Fear of their full participation 
will hold back the potential of the practice. The aim should be to harness their 
undivided input and energy. That is achieved by teamwork, with the whole 
practice focusing on target and cooperating to that end.”

“But we only bill at the end of each month, and our software system only gives 
monthly reports.” The junior partner sounded worried.
“Why wait until the end of a month if the job is ready for billing today? Try 
to bill weekly. Apart from improving your cash flow, you will maintain a firmer 
grip on hours and rate if they are monitored week by week.”2
He continued to voice objections. “What about work in progress? Our hours 
may be spot on or over the target hours for the week, but they can’t be billed 
because jobs are not completed.”
“We are talking about billings only. If you use work-in-progress hours, you will 
have discrepancies when it comes to finalizing the account, bearing in mind 
you write off some of those hours if you feel the client may react adversely. 
Besides,” I continued, “work in progress hours will tend to even themselves 
out when the time comes for billing. You will find write-offs will gradually fade 
away altogether as your team becomes focused on targeting how long a job 
should take before it is started.”
I pointed out that nothing would happen unless they introduced an Action 
Sheet to monitor progress with the key staff on a weekly basis.3
The phone rang on the senior partner’s desk. It was from the bright recep-
tionist to say the taxi had arrived to take me to the airport.
Case Comment
As often happens, ambitious staff wanting a greater slice of the action leave 
for greener fields, and despite all contractual agreements they inevitably take 
some clients with them.
Conscious of this, the partners—once the write-off problems were under 
control—gave the staff the opportunity to earn a third of their billings and 
work largely at their own pace, with the proviso that they bill a minimum of 
30 hours a week, net of any write-offs.
In the next six months, the practice increased its billings by 20% over the same 
period in the previous year and went on to outdo the targeted net profit per 
partner.
The 9-to-5 syndrome faded as staff began to enjoy the incentive of getting 
one-third of their individual charge-out rate for every hour billed over their 
personal 30-hour target, in a system where hours over the target were cred-
ited and hours under were debited, based on a three-month cycle.
2Table 1-2 illustrates a simple format for tracking weekly results for comparison with 
target.

Within a year, the firm became the most profitable of all practices in the 
two-partner category.4 It was a pleasure to visit and share in the positive and 
energizing atmosphere.
Software companies have long targeted the public accounting profession as a 
prime market for practice software and for the potential influence a practice 
has on its business clients. As a result, systems for timekeeping and charge-out 
rates have been fine-tuned to a high degree of sophistication. Time is usually 
costed and based on a minimum of 6-minute units, or 10 units an hour.
While the collation of times and the associated charge rate per client is a 
simple matter of inputting the client code, the actual billing is frequently sub-
jected to the “feel” test. Is the bill too high and should it be written down? 
Or too low and should be written up? What was it last year? Has the client 
enjoyed an especially good year?
A practice targeting hours before processing the work will be in a position to 
compare target hours with time-sheet hours as per the computer printout.
If the practice has adopted TARI, it will be in a position to compare both time 
and rate for individual billings.
As most practices rely on monthly feedback from their software, there is sel-
dom any weekly and accumulative comparison of time and rate charged with 
TARI. Reviews, if any, are held two to three weeks into the subsequent month, 
by which time it becomes all too difficult to recover from a poor result.
The legal practice in the following case study provides a change of pace.
4Interfirm comparison of accounting practices is made available within the profession.

Legal Firm 
Transfers 
Productivity to 
the Bottom Line
Uncovering a major roadblock to productivity 
spurred this legal practitioner into clearing the 
backlog of files from the office floor.
When I first met Bill, he had been running his legal practice for 15 years or so. 
He said the pressures were unceasing and wondered how he could continue. 
Every year, he told his wife and children the need to work nights and week-
ends at home would cease and that things would get better.
As time passed, he employed additional staff to ease the burden and eventually 
a partner. If anything, the pressure increased.
I urged him to make the effort to attend a forthcoming Legal Practice 
Conference I had organized, and he promised to try. To my surprise he did 
16

Chapter 16 | Legal Firm Transfers Productivity to the Bottom Line
114
attend, and I called on him some weeks later. The first thing I noticed was the 
absence of stacks of files that had previously cluttered the desk and floor of 
his office.
“What happened?” I asked.
“Well, the main thing that hit me,” said Bill, “was that legal practices with the 
same staff and partner numbers as mine were bringing in double the fees, 
some treble. Mine was easily the lowest in fees per staff member. I think they 
called it ‘inter-firm comparison.’ I could not understand it, since we are so flat-
out all the time and charge scale fees for most work, and I didn’t seem to be 
doing anything noticeably different from the rest of them.”
I nodded and he continued. “One of the speakers mentioned a study carried 
out by IBM, which showed the average typist only typed 8 words a minute 
during a typical day, due to many interruptions and so forth. It gave me an 
idea, so when I got back to the office I collected the printouts of all the work 
produced in my absence and counted the words input by the five clerical staff. 
Would you believe it worked out at 4 words a minute?
“Have a look at this.” He drew out a sheet of paper from the drawer showing 
his analysis along the following lines (Table 16-1).

I wondered if he appreciated that he had applied a classic piece of manage-
ment science to his practice by undertaking such an objective measurement 
of activity.
He went on with growing excitement. “I called in Joan, the senior clerk, and 
put it to her that her team was inputting data at the rate of 4 words a minute. 
She would not have it at all. She said she and the others did at least 65 words 
a minute. I showed the evidence and pointed out how phone calls, cups of 
coffee for clients, and trips down the street for this and that eroded the time 
available for typing.

115
Improving Profit
“I went out and purchased two Dictaphones,1 one each for my partner and 
me and five transcribers, one for each clerk. I dictated my letters from then 
on and handed them to Joan, who organized the staff.”
“How did that work out?” I asked.
“Well, it saved at least half the staff time previously taken up having to take 
notes. But they certainly didn’t like the idea of being glued into earphones 
all day; they took days off for dubious sickies, banged doors loudly, stopped 
making tea and coffee, and generally made life pretty unbearable. In fact, it 
got so bad that my partner rang me late one evening and asked me to put 
everything back the way it had been because he couldn’t stand it any longer.  
I agreed, and would have done so, but for an emergency court case that  
came up and I forgot all about the office for a few days. By the time I got back 
into harness, it had all seemed to come together, with the staff settled in to 
the new regime.”
He leaned over the desk as though to emphasize the point: “Would you 
believe that I’m getting my letters back for signing on the same day that  
I dictated them?”
Waving an arm around to indicate a desk and floor now clear of files, he said, 
“I used to keep all the current files around me so as not to lose track.”
“You mean you were unable to retrieve files easily?” I asked.
“No, it wasn’t retrieval so much as keeping in touch with matters dictated that 
would come back to me for signing anything up to two weeks later. If I kept 
the file in the office, I would know it was waiting for a letter or a note.”
“What do you intend to do now to make sure things don’t slip back?” I queried.
“I’m going to look at improving the accounts to see if we can do interim  
billing instead of waiting until matters have reached a conclusion, many months 
later.” He spoke as a man with renewed energy, new life, and a motivation to 
grasp it. His enthusiasm was infectious.
“You know, Bill, you didn’t have to wait for 15 years and an almost failed family 
life and business to go with it.” I said.
“Well if someone had told me about 8 words a minute 15 years ago, I guess  
I wouldn’t have gone through all the pain.”
1Yes, this case happened well over a decade ago. However, I have it on good authority that 
there are still a lot of Dictaphones in use by old-school attorneys who have not caught 
up with the times.

Chapter 16 | Legal Firm Transfers Productivity to the Bottom Line
116
“I’m not referring to the 8 words a minute, helpful though that has been. I’m 
referring to setting up a clear target of what you need to achieve to cover 
expenses, including a reasonable take-home salary plus some profit.”
“I can only do my best.”
“Well, let’s look ahead and see if we can pinpoint what that ‘best’ represents 
in terms of profit to two partners.”
“Happily,” he agreed.
“First step is run through the expenses.” Referring to previous statements, we 
wrote down every item according to Bill’s estimates for the year ahead. The 
total came to $850,000.
“What would you like to make to cover partner salaries and profit for blood, 
sweat, tears, and risk?” I asked.
“A bit more than last year?” he said tentatively.
“A lot more if you consider the increased productivity you have released.  
If you only achieve an extra 10 hours a day from your five staff, think what  
that means over 12 months!”
Looking at the resources available to achieve these fees, I suggested the two 
partners target 1,500 billable hours each, and that five staffers could target 
average billable hours of 1,400 hours each, making a total of 10,000 hours 
(Table 16-2).

2In some legal practices, the partner’s charge rate is inclusive of input from support 
staff—thus the $400 per hour should Bill and his partner wish to operate along those 
lines. However, their preference was to include the support staff in order to encourage a 
greater sense of participation in a team effort.

“The target average fee of $120 is the TARI or target average rate index we 
discussed at the conference, do you remember?”
“Yes, of course—you rubbed it in enough! It’s a benchmark for comparing our 
fees. The average hourly rate of $120 across the board seems to be about 
what we are getting on scale fees,” he said.
I elaborated: “The difference now will be the level of productivity. Right now 
we need to establish a simple feedback system to capture your billings on a 
week-by-week basis.”
“I understand,” said Bill, “but we usually send out our bills at the end of each 
month, and some matters can’t really be billed until they are finished. In any 
case, we don’t always use hours to work the fees out. We sometimes apply 
the fee scales indicated by the Law Society.”
“It would help your liquidity to bill where possible at the end of each week 
rather than wait for the end of the month,” I replied. “As for tracking the 
hours when using scale fees, this can be done by dividing the billing by $120 to 
calculate what accountants call standard hours.”
“But what about work in progress—surely that represents hours of input?”
“Yes it does, but you can’t pay bills with work in progress.”
I showed him a weekly performance summary sheet that would enable him to 
track results against target each week and accumulatively.
“Is this a sort of interfirm thing?” he asked.
“No, Bill. This has to do with achieving the potential of this business, given 
its expense structure and partner take-home expectations. It could well be 
that the resulting average gross fee per staff member is comparable with the 
average for the profession, but bear in mind the interfirm data is a statistic of 
a collection of firms operating in a variety of locations and with a varying mix 
of work.”
Bill’s eyes lit up as he began to understand that, just as he increased the ­typist’s 
productivity, by tracking hours he could legitimately increase the number of 
hours billed.
I continued: “The target billings of $1,200,000, represent a first cut, as it were. 
As the weekly information feeds back, the picture will become clearer, and 
enable a second or third cut to be made. Meanwhile, you need to track weekly 
and accumulatively along the following lines” (Table 16-3).

  If the hours have not been tracked, then the fees are divided by TARI to provide calculated 
or “standard” hours.
I wrote out an Action Sheet, and pinpointed who was to do what and by when.
Case Comment
Charge-out rates, calculated and applied in similar fashion to accountants and 
architects, would quickly drive managing partners into the trees, where they 
tend to get lost in the detail. Thus, the need for a sustained view of the woods, 
such as TARI provides.
Even if time sheets are not kept, fees divided by TARI will provide an over-
view of “standard” hours, which, if accumulated by the week, will very quickly 
pinpoint the level of chargeable hours compared with available hours. For 
example, assume fees charged out this week amounted to $2,400. Dividing 
this by a TARI of $120 would indicate 10 “standard” hours billed.
Assume after 4 weeks the accumulation of weekly fees amounted to $9,600; 
dividing by $120 would indicate a billing of 80 “standard” hours in total, com-
pared with a target of, say, 120 billable hours (4 weeks × 30 hours a week).
Once a main source of fees in many legal practices, conveyancing (doing the 
legal paperwork relating to property sales) has been subjected to fierce com-
petition, putting practices under financial pressure. So the need for targeting 
and tracking revenue has become a growing imperative for profitable survival.

Noting the likely time a matter will absorb and multiplying by TARI will pro-
vide an estimate of the likely fee. Comparison of the estimate with the final 
fee will focus attention on where the rubber meets the road.
As the following real-life case illustrates, the effectiveness of such an approach 
is not limited to professions such as architecture, accounting, and law.

Contractor 
Increases Strike 
Rate to 1 in 4
A large air conditioning group teaches its 
contractors how to quote to win installations. 
One contractor quoted differently
A manufacturer of commercial and home air conditioning units was conduct-
ing two-day seminars in five states. A total of 120 installation contractors 
attended.
The purpose of the seminars was to improve management skills related to 
finance, systems, marketing, staff motivation, and training. The manufacturer 
believed that improving these skills would strengthen the contractors and 
ultimately help them sell more of their AC units.
The manufacturer had called me in to participate. To drive home the differ-
ence between the traditional approach to quoting a job and quoting a job 
based on the concepts underlying Contribution-Based Activity, I asked the 
participants to individually work out and hand in a quote for the installation of 
a commercial unit costing the contractor $3,000 and requiring an estimated 
six production-hours to install.
17
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 17 | Contractor Increases Strike Rate to 1 in 4
122
Using the method advocated by the manufacturer, participants marked-up the 
cost of the unit by 33%, and added a cost to cover labor along the lines shown 
in Table 17-1:
Quotes ranged between $4,100 and $4,600. Asked how they worked out 
their hourly charge rates, they said they applied a percentage to the hourly 
wage to cover overhead. It was noticeable that across all participants, neither 
the wage rate nor the added percentage varied significantly.
It happened to be on the final day of the five seminars when, among the quotes 
handed in, was one for $3,480.
It was so different that I asked the contractor concerned to identify himself 
in order to explain how he arrived at such a low rate compared with his 
colleagues.
A tall, suntanned contractor in his mid-thirties stood up. “I owe it to my 
accountant,” he said. “I used to mark up like all the others and I was winning 
about 1 in every 15 quotes. One day, he suggested I compare quotes with a 
targeted average hourly rate as a benchmark, the same as he did. He called it 
the TARI approach or something like that. In this case, where no special prob-
lems were involved, I merely used the average rate.”
“The accountant was referring to the target average rate index, or TARI for 
short,” I explained, delighted to hear of an accountant “out there” who had 
grasped the concept and applied it to his clients’ quotes.
“Would you like to tell us how you worked out your benchmark rate?” I asked 
him, offering him the marking pen and indicating the whiteboard.
He walked to the front of the class confidently. “We worked out what my 
expenses were likely to be for the year,” he said as he took the pen, “and 
added a good profit to it. We divided the total by the hours I thought we 
would be charging out for the same period.”

Table 17-2 shows what he put up on the board.
He said, “That’s why my quote came in at $480 plus the cost of the unit. Six 
hours by $80 were based on two to inspect and quote, four to install.”
“Has it made a difference to your strike rate in quoting?”
“Yes, I now win one in four, and I’m well ahead of target for the year.” he 
smiled broadly as he sat down.
“Hang on,” said a voice loudly from the back of the room. “So you don’t add 
any mark up to the unit? Why not?”
The gentleman stood up again. “Because when I did, I might win on some jobs 
with expensive equipment and lose on others with cheaper equipment. It was 
pot luck, really. Apart from that, I was quoting against other contractors who 
marked up their equipment in the same way. That was why I was only winning 
1 in 15 quotes compared to 1 in 4 now; it’s because I know what I need for 
an hour on the job.”
I then asked him how he kept track of hours charged out. “The accountant 
gets me to put the hours on the copies of each invoice with the cost of the 
material, and I drop them over to him once a week. He works out how I am 
going against target and keeps me apprised.
“You don't keep the records yourself, then?”
“I started to, but I fell behind until I lost track. He keeps me up to it.”
I referred the group to an example of the tracking matrix in the seminar notes 
(Table 17-3).

Case Comment
I was asked to address a meeting of the plumbing industry, some of whom 
were also engaged in installing air conditioning as well as all manner of pipe 
laying. There were about 270 in attendance. Handing out blank sheets of paper, 
I asked them to write out a quote for a job for which the materials and parts 
cost $2,000 with an estimated labor time of 10 hours. The quotes were col-
lected and summarized during the coffee break.
When they had settled back in their seats, I asked those with an hourly rate 
exceeding $80 an hour to indicate by raising their hands. No hand was raised 
and there was general laughter as though I must be dreaming to think they 
had an hourly rate that high.
I then asked for those with an hourly rate exceeding $60 an hour to raise 
their hands. More laughter and no hands raised.
At rates exceeding $50 an hour, a few did raise their hands.
At rates exceeding $40 an hour, hands went up everywhere.
“Well, you would be interested to know the average hourly rate for the 130 
quotes handed in was $100,” I told them.
There was stunned silence. “All of the quotes without exception marked up 
the materials with an average of 33%, making $660 contribution. If we divide 
that by the 10 hours we get an additional contribution of $66 an hour. When 
this is added to what you call your hourly charge-out rate, which averages $35 
to $40, you can see how the result works out to $100-plus.” I wrote it on the 
whiteboard (Table 17-4).

I couldn’t help wondering why we have allowed ourselves to be so deluded 
by the traditional accounting approach; we can no longer see the woods for 
the trees.
As with any business, the objective is to cover expenses and make a profit. 
The traditional approach to achieving that objective is to add a percentage 
markup to materials plus a planned number of billable hours.
Jobs with less material content taking 10 hours result in less contribution than 
jobs with high material content taking the same time.
To the extent that planning an hourly charge rate for the year ahead calls for a 
guesstimate of the cost of materials used in the previous year, there is further 
uncertainty. This is particularly the case if tracking results against plan, or is 
not carried out weekly and accumulatively.
A business operating without a markup on materials, and focused on targeting 
and tracking enough billable hours weekly and accumulatively to achieve the 
desired contribution, is far more likely to succeed.
In the final analysis, as this and other case studies reveal, providing a clear 
focus on the two levers of contribution and unit activity is far more likely to 
result in achieving and sustaining a competitive edge.
As I prepared to leave the venue that day, a plumber stopped me. “Can you 
spare a minute?” he asked. “They talked about the need to market your busi-
ness today and I can’t see how that’s possible with the work my firm does.”
“What sort of work do you do?” I queried.
“Plumbing, but mainly underground, you know, sewage piping.”
“What buildings have you worked on around here?”

He thought for a moment. “Well, there’s the IBM building,” he said, referring 
to a state-of-the-art local skyscraper.
“Great,” I replied. “Put a photo of it on a flyer to advertise your firm.”
“But we only worked on the piping system below ground!”
“All the more reason for the photo,” I said. “Who would want to work in a 
building with no toilets?”

Hot Bread Baker 
Discovers More to 
Bread than Flour
Until he came face-to-face with the added 
value in bread and sausage rolls, the proprietor 
was actively seeking additional products to 
boost the bottom line
Ushered in by the accountant, the baker came into the conference room 
accompanied by his wife, looking a little tired and weary. It was late ­afternoon, 
and he had been up since before dawn in his bakery. A residue of flour  
whitened his eyebrows and clung to the back of his arms.
The previous evening, I had addressed a client gathering of an accounting prac-
tice and he was one of several requesting an interview.
He kicked off the conversation. “I came to see what you reckoned about my 
idea of leasing a pie-making machine. I can get one that makes 4,000 pies an 
hour, and they reckon I can flog them to a wholesaler for 70 cents each. Make 
a fortune. What do you reckon?”

“Who is ‘they’?” I asked, knowing 70 cents was above the price paid by ­retailers, 
let alone wholesalers.
“The machine people,” he fired back. “They should know, being in the business 
an’ all that.”
“Well, before going into that, do you think we could spend a moment look-
ing at what you do right now?” I said, steering him away from what I decided 
would be a prolonged and futile debate. “How many do you employ?”
“Me and an apprentice pastry cook in the back, and the wife and a part-time 
assistant in the shop.”
“How many loaves of bread do you make in an hour?” I queried.
“A hundred-ten,” he said without hesitation.
“And what do you sell a loaf for?”
“A dollar-sixty.”
“And how much do the ingredients cost?”
“Twenty-four cents.”
I wrote the figures on the whiteboard (Table 18-1).

“That works out at $150 gross profit an hour or $75 per man-hour if we take 
account of the apprentice,” I observed. “What about bread rolls—how many 
of those do you make in an hour?”
“Six hundred sixty-six,” he said without a second’s thought, “and they sell for 
30 cents and the ingredients cost 4 cents.”

129
Improving Profit
I multiplied 26 cents by 666.
“That works out at $173 gross per hour, or $86.50 per man-hour,” I said. 
“What about sausage rolls?”
His response came like shots from a gun: “Six hundred an hour selling for 90 
cents and ingredients 10 cents.”
“That works out at $480 gross an hour or $240 per man-hour,” I said, mul-
tiplying 600 by 80 cents and dividing by 2. The accountant, who had been 
observing quietly to this point, permitted a faint smile to crease his features.
“Ah, but the lamingtons are my best bet!” the baker exclaimed. Lamingtons 
are a traditional Australian dessert. “I’ve got a wholesaler who’ll take all the 
lamingtons I can make.” His eyes lit up at the thought.
“How many do you make?” I asked
He had to stop and discuss that with his wife, who had been sitting placidly 
beside him.
“Two hundred-fifty an hour,” he said, “selling for 65 cents retail and 25 cents 
wholesale. Ingredients, 8 cents.”
“How many do you sell retail compared with wholesale?” I asked.
“Probably three-quarters wholesale and a quarter retail.”
I quickly calculated the outcome as I went to the whiteboard (Table 18-2).

“Given it takes you and the apprentice to produce a batch, if you sold the full 
250 output wholesale it works out to approximately $42 or $21 contribution 
per man-hour.” I did the math on the whiteboard:
250 × 17 cents = $42.50 ÷ 2 = $21.25 per man hour

Chapter 18 | Hot Bread Baker Discovers More to Bread than Flour
130
“If you sold the lot retail it works out to $142.50 or $71.75 per man-hour.” 
I did the math once again:
250 × 57 cents = $142.50 ÷ 2 = $71.25 per man hour.
He looked dumbfounded until he remembered something: “Ah, but I’ve got 
plans for a machine that will make them a lot faster!”
I ignored that for the time being. It was time to plan ahead. Given the fragmen-
tary data available, there was little point carrying the analysis any further.
We reviewed the expenses of the total bakery and, excluding ingredients, 
arrived at a guesstimated $125,000. His profit the previous year amounted to 
$25,000. However, given the obvious potential, he was inspired to project a 
bottom line of $100,000, making a target gross profit of $225,000.
Given a total availability of 4,500 hours in the bakery, and his belief that 75% 
of those hours would be productive, we targeted 72% or 3,250 hours for the 
planned period, amounting to a TARI of $69.23 or close to $70 per man-hour 
(Table 18-3).

I pointed out that the target average contribution, better known as the target 
average rate index or TARI, is in effect a benchmark against which the unit-
contribution of other products can be compared. “I can see that,” he said 
peering at the figures, “but I think we’re going to need the pie-making machine 
to get a $100,000 profit!”
“Did the pie machine company guarantee to buy the output for 70 cents a 
pie?” I asked.
“Well, more or less,” he said.
“Not really, dear,” his wife noted in a gentle tone.
“Well, they said there would be no problem,” he added sternly.
I suggested that a pie machine capable of turning out 4,000 pies an hour would 
probably cost between $250,000 to $500,000, depending whether it included 
the preparation of the pastry, associated fillings, pie molding, and heating facili-
ties. The leasing cost alone would be in the region of $50,000 to $100,000 a 

131
Improving Profit
year; and if—as was likely—the pie machine company failed to buy the output, 
it would be necessary to take on at least one and more likely two sales rep-
resentatives to sell the pies.
“Before making any decision about the pie machine or, indeed, the lamington 
machine,” I concluded, “what say we track results daily for a while, and see 
how the business performs against target?”
The baker’s wife nodded, and he sighed in reluctant agreement.
Picking up the Action Sheet (Table 18-4), we decided who should do what  
by when.
The baker agreed to keep a daily record of the product baked and numbers 
sold, and to e-mail the results each week to the accountant, who would enter 
the data and e-mail back a comparison with target.
We then scheduled a meeting with the accountant in four weeks to review 
progress and make any necessary adjustments to the plan, including the TARI 
of about $70 per hour.
Knowing the baker would have difficulty in designing an appropriate format to 
record production and sales, the accountant agreed to prepare the sheet and 
deliver it the following day.
Case Comment
It is doubtful if more than one baker in a thousand has a clear picture of con-
tribution per hour5 of baking input. As a result, it becomes largely a matter of 
bakers’ instinct as to additional products taken on or rejected.
While this baker agreed to target an output absorbing 75% of available hours, 
he really had no idea of his current level of productivity.

In this case, he was selling output at retail price in the shop front. That made 
all the difference. Had he been selling at wholesale prices, the contribution 
would have been much less.
It was a simple matter to draft a matrix comparing actual output with each 
hour of input. (Table 18-5).6

The key to making it happen would be implementation: everything would be 
dependent upon the level of persistence the accountant exercised in extracting 
the weekly record.
Fortunately, the accountant seemed quite confident. “I don’t expect too much 
trouble collecting the data,” he grinned, nodding toward an attractive junior 
staff member with a bright, smiling personality. “I’ve got my best new recruit 
on the job.”
6This matrix is of course adaptable to many businesses.

133
Improving Profit
The accountant told me later in the year that the process of relating daily 
output to contribution per man-hour had boosted the bottom line and refo-
cused the client’s ambition for expansion to one of experimenting with ways 
and means of improving the contribution.
In all, a positive outcome for the business, for the accountant and not least, the 
baker’s wife who, over the years, had become immune to her husband’s bright 
ideas and carried on as best she was able in the front of shop.
The next chapter demonstrates how a bright idea by a CEO of a major corporate 
can also go astray.

Window 
Manufacturer’s 
Flawed 
Foundation
The fabricator who put the window frames 
together was the most productive of anyone 
on the assembly floor. It wasn’t his fault the 
method of assembly was inefficient
Having successfully acquired a patented aluminum extrusion for making alumi-
num window frames with greater structural strength, a nationwide company 
established a new plant complete with factory, production, engineering, fabricat-
ing, marketing, and distribution staff, and commenced an extensive advertising 
campaign.

Chapter 19 | Window Manufacturer’s Flawed Foundation

Consultants were commissioned to set up appropriate systems and proce-
dures, from the acquisition of raw materials to the installation of finished 
products in buildings.
Twelve months down the track, orders were few and far between and the 
marketing team was under scrutiny by the CEO. He knew the product was 
new, but it had been tried and tested and was well accepted in Europe.
He accepted that the lead time in getting any new product on the market 
varied, but with the heavy advertising expenditure over the past year, coupled 
with all the promotions that had taken place, it was time to expect a greater 
flow of orders than they were getting.
He did not agree that the price tag was too high. That had been well and truly 
looked at by the finance team.
I was introduced to this debate as a trainee consultant attached to the senior 
consultant on the job. He gave me a stopwatch and, as an exercise, told me to 
“work study”1 the window frame-making process going on in the plant. Apart 
from my need for training, it was a useful way of getting me out of the senior 
consultant’s hair for a week or so.
I was introduced to an employee engaged in fabricating large aluminum frames 
for a major urban building project. The foreman explained to him that it was a 
matter of me getting on-the-job work experience and that there was nothing 
sinister in my noting the time it took for each step of the process.
After five days of work studying what seemed to be a laborious process of 
assembling one window frame a day, it was time to compile a report on my 
findings for the senior consultant. I collated all the data and averaged the times 
for each movement from the point of taking the extrusions from the rack to 
a completed frame.
Apart from gaining a fairly accurate assessment of the assembly process, I also 
gained an insight into the life and times of a friendly fabricator.
In the plant engineer’s office, I set up a scaled-down representation of the 
fabrication on the basis of one quarter-inch on the board representing 36 
inches in the plant.
I hammered in four 2-inch nails to represent the two trestles on which the 
window lengths were placed for riveting with inlays and end pieces.
I hammered another nail in to represent the washroom location, and another 
for the extrusion rack where the aluminum lengths and inlays were stacked 
each morning, ready for assembly.
1Work study involved looking at the method of construction as well as the timing of each 
activity involved.

137
Improving Profit
Taking a ball of string, and referring to my work-study sheets, I began tracing 
the pathway of the fabricator, as he picked up a length of aluminum, placed 
it on the trestles, riveted it to a crosspiece, walked down to the other end 
and repeated the process. Occasionally he would drop tools for a visit to the 
washroom, now represented by that nail on the drawing.
The ball of string ran out and I tied the end onto a new ball. When the sec-
ond ball of string ran out, I had to ask the foreman to send down the road for 
additional balls. Meanwhile, I replaced the 2-inch nails with 4-inch nails.
I continued the process until the string ran over the 4-inch nail heads and 
longer nails were needed to replace them. It took 12 balls of string woven 
backward and forward over 6-inch nails to complete the miniature replica of 
fabricating one window frame. The result looked like a nest of spiders had 
spun a huge pyramid on the drawing board. I calculated the distance walked 
to be five miles.2
The senior consultant was not amused. “You must have included assembly for 
five days instead of averaging the times!”
I assured him the times and method had been averaged to represent one 
window.
Word got around, and the factory manager came to look at this phenomenon 
displayed in the drawing office. When he saw it, he shrugged his shoulders 
and walked off without a word. Every day he parked his car in a corner of 
the plant and walked past the fabrication process, but apparently saw nothing 
untoward.
My friend the fabricator who worked on the window was astounded that he 
walked five miles a day. He wondered if that was the cause of his varicose vein 
problem and railed against the length of string that tracked his visits to and 
from the washroom.
During their three weekly visits to the plant, the finance and marketing direc-
tors made a point of checking out this piece of research they had heard about, 
and they wanted me to explain it to them.
The finance director studied it carefully and looked puzzled, while the market-
ing director began to get excited. “I’d like one of these made up for each of 
my reps,” he said.
“Why so?” asked the finance director.
“Well, when people see what goes into making these windows, they’ll under-
stand why it takes so long and costs so much!”
2Or eight kilometers.

Chapter 19 | Window Manufacturer’s Flawed Foundation
138
Challenged by the whole exercise, I spent time working out a preassembly 
method that cut the distance the fabricator walked down to half a mile, and 
the assembly time by two-thirds.
To me it was a revelation. Here was a nationwide corporation embarking on 
a major campaign at no small expense, and yet at the very foundation was a 
serious crack undermining its potential. Everybody saw it, but nobody really 
saw it. It was all too familiar.
In retrospect, it seemed extraordinary that no one had checked with their 
European counterparts to find out how they put their windows together, or 
even how long the fabrication of various configurations should take.
Had they done so, it would have been possible to establish a targeted gross 
profit contribution benchmark per hour3 as a focus for quoting and pricing 
decisions.
Case Comment
Both the factory and production managers parked their cars in a corner of 
the factory and walked past the window fabrication every day. Anxious to get 
to their desks to tackle the daily workload, they saw it, but did not see it as 
it really was.
The senior consultant of the consulting firm, my training supervisor, was up to 
his eyeballs working with the production manager scheduling purchases and 
calculating logistics for a nationwide push of the product. He also did not see 
the problem.
The finance and IT departments were busy preparing a more updated accounts 
package to cope with the expected demand, and therefore the thought never 
occurred to them.
The marketing department, whose enthusiasm had been somewhat dented by 
production delays on large buildings, was “head down and tail up” working up 
a long-term promotional strategy for tackling the small-home market, which 
they hoped would develop sales in non-structural aluminum windows.
Had I known then about contribution-based activity, target average rate index 
(TARI) benchmarks, invoice sampling, and so forth, it would have been but a 
matter of minutes to identify and illustrate the weakness threatening survival 
of a potentially profitable business.4
3Best known as target average rate index, or TARI, to emphasize its benchmark status.
4Failure to seamlessly relate the fabricator’s $20 hourly wage to the gross profit contribution 
per hour remains a blind spot at the heart of current commercial information systems to 
this day.

Improving Profit
For example, assume the target contribution of the window frame department 
was $2,000,000 and the unit of activity driving fabrication was a production-
hour contributing $100 an hour (Table 19-1).

Is it likely management would not have been so casual about a fabrication 
process taking three times longer than it needed to, had they been aware of 
the connection between a targeted $100 contribution and a $20 per hour 
wage.5
In such a case, because the process was taking at least three times longer 
than intended, the targeted contribution of $100 would have been reduced to 
$336—a result that would have become apparent within a week or two.
As a result of the work study, the fabrication process was changed, output 
improved, expenses were contained, and profits began to flow.
It remains a matter for reflection as to whether the positive reaction by 
the decision makers would have been so immediate, had it not been for the 
extraordinary sight of 6-inch nails covered with the equivalent of five miles 
of string.
5In Chapter 4, the financial implications of failure to grasp the connection between wage 
and contribution for the same production-hour is driven home to the CEO.
6$100 ÷ 3 = $33.33.

Contractor 
Discovers a New 
Way Home
From the design to the completed house, all  
looked good on paper, but slippage was occurring.  
Figuring a way to make the supervisors more 
accountable turned the situation around
The contractor was angry. “I sold and built 75 homes last year, all selected 
from one of our designs, all subcontracted out to the trades, and all, in ­theory, 
giving me a 10 percent margin. At an average of $13,300 for each home,  
I should have made a million to cover office overhead and profit.”
“What did you make?” I asked from the other side of a very large teak desk.

“Nowhere near enough to keep the bank off my back! The account is a quar-
ter of a million worse off than this time last year.”
“Do you have much owing to you?”
“Receivables are about level with payables,” he sighed.
“Are you paying more for your materials and subcontractors than you 
planned?”
“The estimator reckons we are on track, but I don’t know whether he can 
keep up with it. I mean, he’s got all his quantities and prices on tap, and orders 
the materials to site and so on, but the accounts do not always identify what 
went where, and everything is put into the one bucket.”
He paused to contain his exasperation, then continued. “He complains that he 
doesn’t get informed about what is happening on site, and in any case, we are 
always pressing him for a quote for a potential buyer. We might win one out 
of five quotes. It’s pretty tough competition out there.”
I asked, “How many additional houses could you have built if you had won 
more quotes?”
“Any number,” he said. “It’s a matter of employing another one or more 
supervisors.”
“How many houses can a supervisor handle?” I asked.
“That depends on the design, local terrain, and location. Some are way out of 
town and take half a day traveling to get there and back. I’d say ours are pretty 
flat-out handling 15 a year each.”
It was a scenario where phones rang ceaselessly. Subcontractors had to be 
kept busy or they would be unavailable when required, the right materials had 
to be on site on time, and work had to be coordinated to meet scheduled 
council inspections or be held up.
Predesigned plans needed to be adjusted to meet varying ground levels and 
soils in different locations, progress payments had to be attended to, and dis-
contented customers placated. This often required adjustments to plan—
despite the most comprehensively prepared contracts—leading to additional 
unpaid work. Things had gotten out of control.
“Let’s look ahead,” I said, “and quantify where we’d like to be in a year’s time, 
and then decide how we are going to get there.” I reached for a blank sheet 
of paper.
I continued: “We’ll list the overheads you have mentioned and guesstimate any 
increases or decreases in the expenses needed to keep the office open and 
the business functioning at its current level.”

143
The projected overhead expenses of $750,000 included salaries for five super-
visors, the estimator, accountant, receptionist, two sales reps, and two clerical 
assistants.
When I asked the contractor for input about a desirable net profit, he shrugged 
his shoulders and dubiously agreed to my suggestion of $250,000, giving a 
planned gross profit of $1,000,000 (Table 20-1).

“Normally,” I said, “when tracking actual results against planned results,  
we would identify the desired average contribution per unit of key activity. 
One view of the key activity here could be the number of houses. Assuming 
the same number as last year, that would mean a benchmark of $13,333 per 
house, for example (Table 20-2).

I explained that the average contribution of $13,333 would be referred to as a 
“target average rate index,” or TARI, to emphasize its benchmark status.
“We just add 10 percent to the total cost,” he said, “and it comes out pretty 
close to that number.”
“Well, adding $13,333 is not too different from the way you have been  
operating—looking to get a margin on each house sufficient to cover expenses 
and profit. The idea of a margin on top of costs is fair enough, but its success 
is dependent on how effectively costs are controlled. Obviously, when costs 
end up close to, or more than, the contract price of the house, you are in 
trouble.”
“Tell me about it!” the contractor said with a grin, finally loosening up a bit.
1Contribution, frequently referred to as gross profit, is the sum left over to cover expenses 
and profit after paying for materials.

“A more effective approach is to identify the supervisor’s time as the key 
activity. In this case, five supervisors would have an estimated chargeable time 
of, say, 6 hours a day for 5 days a week for 45 weeks.2 This amounts to 1,350 
hours per supervisor or 6,750 hours for five supervisors. We can work out a 
TARI benchmark accordingly” (Table 20-3).
“Translating this back into plain language and given an estimated 75 houses,  
it means each supervisor has an average of 90 hours per home to make up the 
chargeable hours of 1,350 hours per supervisor,” I explained.
“I wouldn’t have thought we need 90 hours’ supervision for every house,” the 
contractor said, in contradiction to his earlier remarks about 15 houses a year 
per supervisor. “I’m surprised to hear it. After all, the sub-trades have been 
with us long enough to know what we expect. We plan six weeks per house 
and I would expect an average of eight hours’ supervision a week would be 
maximum. It’s not as though every house is a new design.”
“Do you mean your supervisors are underemployed or could manage to 
supervise more houses?” I asked.
“Well they always seem to be flat-out so I can’t say they are underemployed. 
I guess I haven’t really had time to put my mind to the matter, what with the 
downturn of the economy, inflation, bank pressures, and so on.”
I said, “If the supervision hours per house should be closer to 50 hours as you 
indicated, it suggests the supervisors are somewhat unproductive.”
“How so?”
I pulled out a clean sheet of paper and began writing (Table 20-4).
252 weeks, less 4 weeks’ annual leave, 2 weeks’ (10 working days) public holidays, and  
1 week’s sick leave.
3The key unit of activity is one hour.

Improving Profit
145
Driving home the need to look more closely at productivity, I compared the 
50 supervisory hours per house with both the available hours and the paid 
hours.
“Well, at least on paper, there would seem to be supervisory time available for 
more houses,” I pointed out.
He looked puzzled. “What do you suggest?”
“I suggest we make the supervisors more accountable for their time,” I said. 
“On the face of it, you don’t need five of them, but before doing anything 
about that, let’s give them a target of 50 hours a house, based on 8 hours a 
week for 6 weeks. We can track results and get a fix on the average contribu-
tion per hour achieved by each of them.”
“I’m not sure how they will go along with it,” he said.
“Well, let’s try and see how it goes,” I replied, making the point that a supervisor 
was standing in much the same place as an independent building contractor 
and, as such, would be well placed to earn a bonus per completed house once 
the contribution exceeded target.
The first step was to develop a target average rate index (TARI) based on  
50 supervisory hours per house as the key units of activity (Table 20-5).

He agreed to track hours and contribution over a four-month period and  
I explained it would come to nothing without a weekly action meeting with 
the five supervisors.

It was apparent that:
1.	 Two supervisors were underperforming in comparison 
with the other three.
2.	 Three supervisors were taking firmer control over the 
estimating, purchasing, and construction process.
3.	 It would be feasible to offer a bonus incentive to super-
visors achieving in excess of 11% contribution margin  
on cost.

Improving Profit
147
4.	 Targeting 50 hours by a TARI of $267 per house was  
providing a much-needed focus for the business as a 
whole.
5.	 There was a sense of direction and purpose beginning to 
take hold in the minds of the key players.
Supervisors had viewed their role as that of supervising construction to 
acceptable levels. Although the length of time to complete a house mattered 
in the context of achieving a profitable outcome, there was no specific time 
factor involved other than “let’s get it done without too many delays.”
With the 50-hours-per-house approach, their individual focus changed from 
“getting things done” to “how can we best get things done within a time frame 
of 50 hours?”
The supervisory role changed to that of a building contractor whose bottom 
line and cash flow6 depended on maximizing the efficiency and coordinating 
the input of various sub-trades. In this case, the bottom line was the incentive 
bonus.
The method proved so effective in gaining control and winning more quotes 
that the company completed 92 homes in the target year without any increase 
in staff except for the addition of an assistant estimator. Net profit came in at 
$340,000.
“Next year,” the contractor told me, “we’ll do better. I am determined to get 
the cash flow under control so that we can improve on our purchasing costs. 
At present we’re paying top rates for materials because we can’t pay in 30 
days, but at least we know the way and how to get there, and that’s the main 
thing.”
Under the circumstances, I could only agree.
Case Comment
At the heart of every business, large or small, lies a key driver of activity. There 
are many drivers and numerous activities, but there is a key driver fundamen-
tal to the others.
In this case, it would be reasonable to presume the key driver relates to the 
number of homes built, but on second thought, we can see the key driver is 
more connected to control of the building process rather than the house 
itself, which is the outcome.
6Cash flow refers to the need to balance the flow of cash payments with the flow of cash 
receipts.

Assigning a target contribution value per hour to the supervisors recognizes 
that they are in the driver’s seat and accountable for achieving the desired 
outcome.
Targeting and tracking in this manner focused the attention of management 
and supervisors on the value of an hour of supervisor time and what was 
needed to achieve its full potential. The following case study of a hairdress-
ing salon clearly demonstrates that for a business to succeed, technical skill, 
however brilliant, requires focus on the value of time.

Since they started paying employee wages using their own credit cards, the

Struggling to keep the business alive after a sudden collapse of the tourist 
trade due to a disaster, they had moved to a more fashionable location. The 
new salon had a basement for shampoo and head massage, a ground floor for

cutting, a first floor for coloring, and a second floor for beauticians’ treatment. 
However, the rent was double that of the previous location.
Anthony, the hairdressing partner and winner of the Hairdresser of the Year 
Award, attracted top staff and celebrity customers, including models, televi-
sion and radio stars, senior executives, and leading socialites.
No one looking at the business from outside would have thought that it was 
experiencing financial difficulties, or that David, the partner in charge of admin-
istration, kept up his long-haul flight attendant’s role in order to provide cash.
It was through a chance meeting with one of their customers that I met the 
partners and accepted their invitation to run a health check on the salon.
A 20-minute on-the-spot analysis revealed the salon was charging out an aver-
age of $81 per hour for a daily average of 3 hours, 51 minutes per hairdresser 
(Table 21-1).
Given an approximation of an average hourly charge rate,2 it was possible 
to get a fix on productivity by referring to the previous year’s financials 
(Table 21-2).

Bearing in mind the hairdressers were paid for 8 hours a day, the news came 
as a shock to both partners, who were under the impression that, if anything, 
they were understaffed and unable to make appointments for potential clients 
at the busy times.
Times for appointments were reviewed and the hour allocated to a cut was 
reduced to 45 minutes. Certain staffers objected strongly, claiming it would not 
be possible to maintain the high level of service if they had to speed up a cut.
Further investigation revealed the one-hour appointment for a cut included a 
15-minute shampoo and head massage treatment undertaken by an appren-
tice. The hairdresser was in fact waiting for the customer at an empty chair 
during this time. The actual cut was completed in 45 minutes.
Allowance was made for the initial massage and shampoo by booking the 
appointment for the customer 15 minutes ahead of the appointment for the 
hairdresser.
Further revenue erosion was abated when aspiring models were informed 
that their discounts of 50% would be cut back to 25%—with barely a reduc-
tion in business.
Deciding the partners should be averaging closer to $90 an hour, and budget-
ing for an increase in expenses and profit, we roughed out a target for the year 
ahead (Table 21-3).

Tracking daily and weekly performance for comparison with TARI, David, in 
conjunction with senior staff with whom he shared results, developed an 
increasingly clear focus on where the rubber met the road.
Taking advantage of Saturday morning staff meetings prior to opening the 
doors for the day, he introduced Action Sheets (Table 21-4), pinpointing who 
was to do what by when. The staff entered into the exercise with growing 
enthusiasm, particularly when they saw their ideas for achieving added value

emphasis was placed on welcoming and friendly support, making use of exist-
ing amenities such as tea, coffee, Champagne, or beer for refreshment, as well 
as three new computers for customers eager to check e-mail or Facebook.
The theme came through loud and clear: “We Care!”
Results after the initial four weeks revealed the salon was achieving an aver-
age of $108 at 4 hours, 5 minutes a day per hairdresser. It was a substantial 
improvement over a TARI of $90, although it fell below the 5-hours, 22-minute 
target.
Feeling he was finally getting a grip on the business and that a great burden 
was slowly but surely lifting from his shoulders, David caught fresh enthusi-
asm. No longer wanting to escape from a depressing financial environment, he 
applied for and received approval from his airline to take a four-month leave.
Results after eight weeks revealed the salon was achieving an average hourly 
rate of $119 with an average output per hairdresser of 5 hours a day.
For the first time since the downturn in tourism, the salon made an opera-
tional profit for the month, enough to pay wages to the partners and begin to 
pay down the credit card debt.
Results after 12 weeks showed an operational profit of $17,100 with an aver-
age hourly rate of $127.
“I used to walk around the salon and chat with staff and customers,” said 
David, “but I became so worried about the finances and the possibility of clos-
ing the doors that I shut myself in the office away from it all. It was too painful 
to do anything else. Now I can see where we are going.”
David elaborated: “TARI gives me focus and the Action Sheets give me the 
means of making things happen. We used to take minutes at staff meetings and 
nothing ever happened. I asked our accountant years ago for input on how to 
improve the business. He only ever said, ‘Make more money.’ Which, when you 
come to think of it was the way to go. At least now we know how.”
Case Comment
At the outset of my involvement, the business was using popular salon soft-
ware to record and track appointments and times per staff member along with 
payments in and out. They relied on their external accountant for the typical 
account information needed for compiling and filing annual tax returns.
Hourly rates varied from $350 down to $50, and there was a fair degree of 
discounting—especially for actual or potential celebrities. While there was a 
general awareness of the time a haircut, shampoo, or coloring should take, there 
was no follow-through to relate those times with actual times taken by staff.

The salon would appear to be busy all day and all week, but without a means 
of comparing scheduled or standard times per appointment against actual 
times, it was not possible to overcome the problem, the symptom of which 
was falling cash levels.
Once the level of productivity was made known and a TARI established, it 
became a simple matter of daily and weekly tracking against target to get the 
salon back on course. In conjunction with weekly feedback on customer ser-
vice, the reality of being a “caring salon” was reflected in additional appoint-
ments and improved productivity.
David considered the Action Sheet a key to the turnaround, because it gave 
him the means of making things happen so that well-meaning intentions by 
staff to do this or that could actually be followed through.
Before wrapping up the Case Studies selected for this book, we will look 
more closely at the Action Sheet as a means of making things happen.

Multi-
Department Store 
Whitewashes the 
Past
It was hammered home to me that genius might 
be 20% of an idea, but implementation is 80%. 
This assignment demonstrated a tried-and-tested 
technique that made things happen
The client company was a major retailer in the city and had been for the past 
hundred years. They operated a city store and three suburban stores, employ-
ing 64 buyers for 64 departments staffed in turn by 2,000 employees.
As agreed upon between the company and a senior consultant, my assignment 
was to improve the goods flow throughout the main city store. Goods were 
offloaded from trucks at the basement Receiving Room from a lane that ran 
22

under the building from one busy street to another. It seemed the delay in 
getting the goods to the departments, spread over four floors, was causing 
frustration.
While reviewing the problem during my first week, I spoke with several buyers 
and came across a listing of the daily sales target for each department. Sales 
for the day were increased by adding a percentage to sales for the same day in 
the previous year. The increase was said to be due to inflation.
Sales measured in dollars were climbing in the inflationary climate that pre-
vailed, however, masking a problem. During conversations with several buyers, 
it appeared the number of sales had been falling and, in the absence of any 
report providing a comparison of numbers for the company as a whole, the 
matter had continued unnoticed.
Taking time off from the goods-flow traffic, I drew up a simple format and 
spent an hour or two in the company’s office accessing sales volumes and 
numbers over a two-year period for the 64 departments (Table 22-1).

After bringing the problem to the attention of the senior consultant, he per-
suaded the company to change direction to tackle the unit decline.
I was upgraded to an office next to the patriarch managing director on the 
fifth floor. It was a freshly painted ex nineteenth-century washroom, furnished 
with a walnut desk and swivel chair. The building was old and lifts stopped at 
the fourth floor, encouraging a fair degree of exercise as I went up and down 
to meet with buyers and work on developing new budgets aimed at increasing 
the number of sales.
Under threat of serious malformation by my consulting supervisor if I should 
fail to hold a formal action meeting each week with the managing director and 
his team of general managers, I complied reluctantly, for it seemed that action 
was always on me. I created an Action Sheet (Table 22-2) in anticipation of the 
next meeting.

After four weeks had passed, and I had prepared budgets for 34 departments 
with 30 to go, the supervising consultant, who visited once a week and chatted 
with the management, told me the client was dissatisfied with my progress. 
In their view, they were paying top dollar to the consulting firm, and they 
expected to see more for their money.1
Although agreeing with my protest that I was flat-out, he said I needed to do 
something to make them feel they were getting their money’s worth while I 
was still working on the budgets.
When I asked for his suggestions as to what I should do in addition to what I 
was already doing, he shrugged his shoulders as he hurried away and said, “I’m 
sure you will work out something.”
As I came to work the next day and entered the store via the Receiving Room 
entrance, I noticed the lane had been blackened with the carbon exhaust, dust, 
and dirt of the past hundred years. I had been in the lane several times before, 
but this was the first time I really saw it looking so black and grimy.
At the next action meeting, I decided to bring the matter up by noting 
“Receiving Room Lane” as an item in the Action Sheet.
After we had dealt with budgets and nominated the departments to be 
reviewed during the subsequent week, the managing director eyed the lane 
item (Table 22-3) with raised eyebrows.

1It was a concern no doubt exacerbated by my having to present the long-serving company 
secretary with a weekly invoice on behalf of my consulting group for my 40 hours of input. 
In comparison with his own weekly paycheck, the amount would have been a source of 
considerable stress. It was also 10 times my own paycheck!

There was a long, loud silence as I could hear them thinking: “$XXX a day and 
he wants to whitewash the lane.”
The managing director sighed audibly and looked over his glasses at the direc-
tor of Store Maintenance. “Will you attend to that, George?”
George looked up from his doodling, a little taken aback at this sudden turn 
of events. “All right, Dad.” His tone was distinctly casual.
“When will you do it, George?” I asked, writing his initials in the By Whom 
column and poised to add the date.
“Oh, next week I suppose.” He watched me inscribe the date accordingly.
During my upstairs-downstairs budgeting activity the following week, I hardly 
had time to notice what was happening, if anything, in the lane.
At the next meeting, after the budget items were dealt with, we arrived at 
the item “Receiving Room Lane.” There was dead silence as all eyes looked at 
George. It had not been done and all those present knew it hadn’t been done, 
including George, who was hoping it would go away.
“When will you do it, George?” I asked with pen poised ready to enter  
the date.
“Oh, next week. Yes, next week” said George.
I carefully noted the date (Table 22-4).

When the matter was raised again the following week, nothing had been done. 
The MD beamed a steely eye at George.
“What happened, George?” he queried.
“I got caught up with a problem at one of the stores,” he said lamely.
“When will you do it, George?” I asked, poised to note the date on the Action 
Sheet.
His father appeared unusually ruffled as the pressure mounted on George as 
well as his fellow directors. It was about then that I came to appreciate the 
value of the Action Sheet.
At the next meeting, the budgets were dealt with as usual. The whitewashing 
of the lane seemed to stand out more than ever, for we all knew it remained 
untouched by human hand, and George was conspicuous by his absence.
After 42 years successfully withstanding many an onslaught, George knew 
from experience that what might seem urgent today, invariably faded in the 
face of inaction. However, the Receiving Room Lane would not go away and 
he was at a loss for how to handle it.
The focus on departmental budgets seemed to melt away in light of the more 
pressing matter of the lane.
I had just arrived at the basement entrance to the store on the Saturday  
following George’s no-show and saw the managing director arrive in his  
chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce.
The Rolls glided into the lane and stopped. The chauffeur opened the door 
and assisted his passenger out of the car before opening the trunk to extract 
two pots of whitewash along with two large brushes. Opening a pot, he stirred 
the contents while his passenger struggled into a pair of white overalls.
To my surprise, the 80-year-old managing director, more than ready for action, 
started sloshing whitewash onto the walls of the lane.

Word of what was going on in the lane spread like wildfire throughout the 
store. Directors, general managers, and store executives appeared from 
everywhere. Uncertain of the outcome, I discreetly withdrew to the sound of 
George crying, “Dad! Dad! For goodness’ sake!”
On Monday morning, the lane was almost blinding in its whiteness—an 
extraordinary transformation from its previous state. Employees heading into 
the lane on their way to clock in at the security entrance were shocked, many 
thinking they had entered the wrong lane.
I could sense a change of attitude toward me from all the staff, as though they 
now appreciated I was really worth the money my firm was charging. This was 
especially so when the General Manager called all the buyers together and 
informed them I enjoyed the complete confidence of the Board.
For me, it was a revealing insight into the power of the Action Sheet, and I 
began to use it freely. There were 10 controllers in charge of the 64 buyers 
and I started weekly action meetings with them, getting agreement on who 
was going to do what by when.
I encouraged the buyers to have fortnightly meetings with their departments 
and send me copies of the Action Sheets. However, it was not until staff at the 
grassroots level realized they could put items on the agenda for discussion 
and action that they too began to appreciate the value of the exercise. For 
example, an employee wanting to bring up a matter as simple as a new lock 
for the staff room toilet door would contact a clerk in the secretary’s office 
to have it noted on the relevant Action Sheet.
In nine months, the company turned the corner and began to pick up on unit 
volume and gross profit contribution as weekly feedback relating to the num-
ber of sales, average sale, and contribution per sale was brought to the notice 
of staff in each department.
They came to see themselves working together as a team to achieve the 
desired target, while the Action Sheets provided a vital channel through which 
communication was maintained and action brought to pass. While awareness 
of the need to tackle the falling unit volume was vital to the exercise, imple-
menting the changes necessary to bring it about was the key to success.
Two years later, I bumped into James, the National Promotions Manager, in a 
busy street not far from the store.
“How's it going, James?” I asked.
“Fantastic!” he exclaimed in his happy-go-lucky way. “Fantastic!”
“What do you put the success down to?” I queried.
“No question, no question, at all!” he said, pumping my hand. “Those little 
sheets you put us on to . . . what were they called . . . Action Sheets. Yes that’s 
it, Action Sheets!”

He took off as I called out, “Are you still keeping them?”
“No need,” he yelled above the noise of passing traffic. “Everything’s all  
right now!”
Case Comment
Important as CBA/TARI is to any business, it is unlikely to groove into the 
daily routine without a systematic approach to its implementation.
Of all the tools available to management, the Action Sheet has to be rated high 
on the list. Without it, all the good ideas for improving performance will fall 
down for lack of a means of implementation.
Seven aspects of the Action Sheet are worth noting:
1.	 You must have consensus. The person nominated for the 
action must be at the meeting and in agreement.
2.	 Limit discussion on any item to five minutes at most. For 
­example, an item such as “falling sales” can be dealt with 
by asking for a report laying out the relevant facts. This 
approach helps the meeting focus on the first step and 
avoids the stress of trying to resolve problems at the 
meeting.
3.	 Note that the Action Sheet puts a clearer focus on the 
issues involved. For example, “Bank complaining about 
slow repayments” may have more to do with collecting 
accounts receivable, so a discussion about the bank man-
ager could be well off track.
4.	 Calls for action that fall on “everybody at the meeting” 
pinpoint nobody in particular and are unlikely to achieve 
the desired result.
5.	 Number items according to date, so when they are car-
ried forward it becomes evident how long they have 
remained on the agenda.
6.	 Meetings chaired by a senior manager will not necessarily 
achieve the desired input from less-senior staff. Better to 
get the staff to conduct the meetings among themselves, 
with occasional visits by senior management.
7.	 Staff wishing to place items on the agenda need to be 
able to do so without fear of repercussion. A neutral staff 
member should be nominated as a recipient for items.

Although this case preceded the crystallization of the concepts underlying 
CBA and TARI, to the extent that it aimed at increasing the number and  
contribution value of sales, it was heading in the right direction.
This brings us to the next chapter, in which senior business executives  
from 14 different businesses examine the relevance of CBA/TARI as applied 
to their business.

Senior executives from companies varying in size from branches of  
multinationals to small and medium enterprises attended a week-long resi-
dential program on the relevance of Contribution-Based Activity for bottom-
line improvement.
Highly intrigued, they speculated on how the concepts might be applied to 
their own circumstances.
They were encouraged to try it for themselves, and if so inclined, to submit  
their findings, so that others might benefit from the exploration of CBA 
and TARI.
Although the findings have been summarized for the sake of brevity, they 
remain faithful to the wording in the transcripts of participants, whose names, 
along with their companies, have been changed to ensure confidentiality.
Unless otherwise stated, the variety of currencies involved have been approxi-
mated to their value in US dollars.

23.1 Vehicle Manufacturing
Bill Jones is on the management team in the production division of Company M,  
which manufactures vehicles for domestic and export markets. As a first step 
in applying the CBA/TARI concepts he has learned about, he decides to carry 
out an invoice analysis of the best-selling vehicles (Table 23.1-1).1

“I noted the invoice analysis revealed interesting variations, with gross profit 
[GP] percentage ranging from 22% to 29%. Seeing I had assumed the GP 
would be much the same, this was a bit of a surprise!
“Recalling the suggestion that we should look ahead and push the boundaries  
a bit, reducing the cost of materials by 5%, I projected a scenario where the 
products sold at an average gross profit contribution margin of 29%, with 
marginally fewer hours for manufacture (see Table 23.1-2).
1Invoice and material prices are net of tax.

Improving Profit

“The average increase in gross profit contribution of close to $522 per vehicle2  
with an output of 200,000 vehicles would mean an additional contribution 
exceeding $100 million (200,000 × $522 = $104,400,000). Improving effi-
ciency by achieving a 5% reduction in the number of production hours would 
potentially improve output by 10,000 cars (200,000 + 5% = 210,000), boosting 
contribution by a further $40 million depending on the product mix.3
“I know it must look a bit like pie in the sky,” Bill wrote, “but it is the first time 
I have been able to get a clear look at the whole picture. Whenever I want to 
get information, I only need to access the software and ask the question to get 
a ream of data. But that is the problem; it doesn’t give me a simple overview.

“In the time available to date, I have not been able to obtain estimates of 
the cost of implementing such an invoice analysis and tracking procedure, 
but whatever the cost, it is necessary to help focus attention on such key 
information.”
23.2 Manufacturing and Distribution
John Smith is assistant chief finance officer of Company Y, which is involved in 
manufacturing and trading. The manufacturing company sells products to the 
trading company, and the latter sells them to distributors.
Analysis of Invoices: Results and Potential Utility
“Approximately 200+ invoices to customers are issued monthly, with every 
invoice including from 20 to 40 lines (different products in different quantities).  
For the analysis, I took 10 invoices. The sample (Table 23.2-1) was chosen 
­randomly, but in such a manner that would include sales to different types of 
customers in different regions (urban and rural).

“The average sale of the sample, $28,264 ($282,624 ÷ 10), multiplied by the 
number of invoices for the period, is within 4% of actual sales for the same 
period and proves the sample is representative.

Improving Profit

“The analysis shows significant spread of gross profit, depending on the distrib-
utor. To determine a clear trend, more detailed analysis is required; however, 
even this small sample highlights the most profitable and the least profitable 
of the distributors, depending largely on their location.
“However, this analysis shows weak areas that should be addressed. Taking 
into account that the least profitable distributor for the company is also the 
most expensive in terms of delivery, the sales force should be oriented on 
improving customer orders in terms of portfolio mix; the task directly related 
to this is to increase demand in retail.
“My recommendation is to set a gross-profit-contribution target margin per 
invoice for sales force and measure their performance according to this target.  
I would recommend upgrading the existing system so that it would be able 
to generate such reports on a regular basis. Technically it is possible, as all 
necessary data are already contained in the system. Monitoring average gross 
profit per item as well as per invoice will be a valuable tool for sales managers, 
allowing them to identify problematic distributors/retail customers. It can also 
be an instrument of measuring performance of sales force.
“This analysis, conducted on a regular basis, should help the company to achieve 
improvement of portfolio mix that was recommended in previous reports.”
Conclusion and Recommendations
“I found the cost system of the company adequate and ensuring correct  
calculation of product costs. As regards the management information system, 
it needs improvement directed on integration of different sources of data 
into a single system and decreasing manual workload. This issue needs to be 
addressed to the IT department.
“I also recommend carrying out invoices analysis (namely calculating average 
gross profit per invoice and per item) on a regular basis through automated 
process in the accounting system. This analysis should serve as a basis for 
improving portfolio mix.”

Manual Analysis	
“I’m going to carry out manual analysis of the customer’s invoices for one 
month. This timeline was selected because of the large amount of invoices 
during a year. This sampling should represent the company’s sales. For rep-
resentation of the overall picture, I decided to include at least three invoices 
from each sales division (Table 23.3-1).
“To check that samples are representative, total gross profit contribution for 
the period was divided by the average gross profit per sale. The result is close 
to the genuine number of sales that were made in that month. The sample 
highlights the distributor with the highest average gross profit, as well the 
distributor with the lowest.
“The account system currently being used, if upgraded to the CBA system, 
will seriously improve the allocation of overheads, taking account of the 
­distribution expenses related to high and low performers.

“Moreover, implementation of an invoice analysis review on a regular basis 
could assist in focusing management’s attention on roots of possible per-
formance limiters as well as acting as basis for internal benchmarking tool 
between sales divisions.”

  It is important to remember that a shift from the traditional system calls for education of 
personnel and will take time.
Conclusion and Recommendations
“Without accurate allocation of overheads relating to distribution, it is a 
hopeless task trying to determine a product’s profitability. Classical accounting  
systems do not reflect real cost consumption and therefore represent dis-
torted information used by management for development of tactical and stra-
tegic decisions. The cost of mistakes is high.
“It is necessary to upgrade the current system. In a market showing little 
growth, when a company cannot sell more than market can consume, contri-
bution-based activity accounting becomes essential to sustaining a competitive 
advantage. Taking into account the low cost of implementation and absence 
of serious changes in user’s interface, the upgrade can be implemented less 
than in six months. Moreover, cost of upgrade includes incorporation of the 
production and sales departments into the financial system. At the second 
stage of the project it is possible to introduce benchmarking tools based on 
the invoice analysis.”
23.4 Software Development
Sam Betts heads up the support team of XYZ, a branch of a multinational 
software development and outsourcing company focused on delivering quality, 
cost-effective software solutions.
“My branch of the company is primarily involved in marketing and support-
ing products as well as upgrading and developing progams. I carried a sample 
invoice analysis” (Table 23.4-1).

“The range of gross profit per item is quite significant. Older agreements with 
fixed rates yield lower gross profit in comparison with newer agreements 
where higher rates were negotiated.
“Some jobs even result in negative gross profit, which reveals that some urgent 
steps must be taken to bring them back to path of profitability. Rate increases, 
lower expenses, and better control over overhead will help to achieve better 
financial results on projects.
“Based on the results of the analysis, it can be observed that there are inaccu-
rate results from current manual reporting processes. To solve this problem, 
the company should invest in a new software system that will connect all 
pieces of information together and allow it to get more informative and timely 
management accounting reports.”
Conclusion and Recommendations
“XYZ’s pricing and productivity is based on a billed consulting hour. The 
hours are reported by employees via a time tracking system, then manually 
transferred to Excel spreadsheets, and along with other expense and revenues 
they are used in developing charge rate formulas.

“Based on the analysis results, it is clear that three cornerstone pieces of 
information—actual reported time, expenditures, and revenues—will par-
ticipate in generation of the management reports. All three will have to be 
connected via software system, eliminating risk of human error, and allowing  
timely access to the reports. This will make the profitability calculation 
easy and transparent not only to top management but also to department 
managers.
“The analysis also revealed that some projects are not performing well, and 
actions will have to be taken to bring their financial results back on track.
“Overall, the process should be more streamlined and automated whenever 
possible. The expense for implementation of such a software system will be 
more than justified.”
23.5 Engineering and Design
Jan Jensen is the CEO of ABZ Company, which provides detailed engineering 
and design services for the mega-construction industry.
“ABZ provides its clients with high-quality technical documentation devel-
oped in the Nupas-Cadmatic CAD/CAM system. The fixed price for each 
project is calculated on the basis of estimated man-hours multiplied by ABZ’s 
hourly rate. Thus, sales are measured in hours. The demand is very high; ABZ 
literally may sell as much as it produces (subject to quality). Market conditions 
are favorable, so ABZ may slowly but steady increase its sales tariff. Therefore 
the strategic goal of ABZ is continuous growth.
“Engineering capacity is computed based on the average ‘effective working 
hours’ per engineer.”
Analysis of 10 Invoices
“The results of a manual analysis of 10 representative invoices are found in 
Table 23.5-1.

Chapter 23 | 14 Businesses Explore CBA/TARI 
172
“The average gross profit calculated from the representative invoices is 31%. 
Apart from giving a close approximation of the average gross profit per hour—
approximately $71—the sample also revealed a wide range of contributions 
per project. It varies from 27% to 48%, which indicates different levels of prof-
itability provided by different projects.”
Average Gross Profit and Gross Profit per  
Man-Hour Comparison
“Dividing the total gross profit of the company for the past year by average 
gross profit per production-hour, I received a result that is not very close to 
the actual number of hours sold. However, I would not doubt that the sample 
of 10 invoices is representative. This discrepancy was most likely caused by 
a transition of business where the man-hour allocation to the projects was 
disturbed. Otherwise the comparison of total hours sold versus total actual 
production hours in this example proved that they are very close.”

Comparison of Total Hours Sold vs. Actual  
Production-Hours Paid
“A further comparison of total hours sold versus total actual production-
hours billed showed a variance of 4% to the benefit of the first. ABZ has spent 
a lot of man-hours for training of personnel additional to the budget, which 
included a cost for trainers, study material, and travel (when activities were 
held outside ABZ premises). So in light of these facts, ABZ productivity was 
relatively high.
“I will now be more considerate toward gross profit contribution values, 
whereas previously, I have just reduced ‘net sales’ by ‘cost of goods sold,’ not 
thinking of what cost was included! Moreover, I would also review actual ver-
sus potential outputs differently. With time, ABZ will be able to collect more 
statistical data for such analysis, which I think shall be considered when making 
appraisal of company performance.
“With regard to financial planning, I would approach development of pro forma 
statements differently. Instead of projecting increase of sales in money terms,  
I would adopt the target average rate per hour system,4 which allows balanc-
ing prices and expenses much more effectively.
“The most valuable advantage of the financial plan developed using an hourly 
tariff framework would be the possibility of using it for managerial control of 
planned values. It could be used for internal benchmarking as well.”
Need for Purchase of New Software 
“Reforming the existing reporting system will be impossible without IT support. 
Thus, ABZ management shall consider purchase of a suitable package that 
would dramatically enrich ABZ organizational capital and improve planning, 
controlling, and accounting processes.
“It will provide timely and reliable information to all users and particularly to 
the accounting department, which in turn will provide top management with 
information crucial for decision making.”
23.6 Property: Real Estate
Jeremy Cantrell is CEO of GGD Inc., a corporation founded with the sole 
purpose of holding and managing residential real estate properties.
4The reference “target rate per hour system” is to “target average rate index,” or “TARI” 
for short, which combines the key activity driver—in this case, man-hours—with is linked 
to the target average gross profit contribution per man-hour.

“Until present day, the company has no staff besides the owners of the 
­company. The directors feel that it is more economically viable to outsource 
activities such as accounting, tax preparation, and janitorial/maintenance tasks 
that occur every year.
“Presently, the company maintains three properties that have been acquired 
since inception. For the purpose of this report, the previous two years are 
going to be taken into consideration; thus statistics are available only for two 
out of the three properties.”
Invoice Analysis
“As mentioned, the business in question doesn’t produce invoices, and income 
is being paid directly as a result of executed lease; moreover, the amount of 
income received every month is exactly the same.
“Table 23.6-1 analyzes the last 10 rents paid and the number of square feet of 
space being rented.

“In the table, cost price included real estate taxes, condominium assessment, 
and mortgage interest for each individual property, all taken from the Profit 
and Loss Report figures. Total gross profit contribution posted for the year 
was $5,130, and total sales revenue made that year was posted as $28,140.
“Dividing the total gross profit by the average gross profit contribution per 
square foot5 came to $0.1825 (Table 23.6-2).
“The sample very closely matches the total space rented of 28,140 square 
feet! What’s interesting is that the table reveals the gross profit per square 
foot of space for each individual property, showing that despite the small prof-
itability of the entire business, one of the units is actually not profitable at all, 
and even considering the probability of modest appreciation of the price on 
the real estate market, it’s losing about $2,124 a year!
“This means that cost of sales (real estate taxes, condominium assessment, 
and mortgage interest) is greater than the rent moneys it brings in. For it 
to become profitable, given the current expense levels, it must bring a rent 
greater than cost of sales each month—at least $1,077.
“This analysis is an eye-opening view into the profit of each individual con-
tributing real-estate asset. The analysis gives a drilled-down picture of what 
the business consists of. At the end of the day, it’s visible that the company is 
in the business of obtaining revenue from renting square feet of space, which 
is the ultimate atomic unit; knowing the average gross profit contribution per 
square foot, it’s much easier and clearer to calculate total revenue that the 
business can achieve if changes are made.
“All of the above figures should ideally have been visible from day one of oper-
ations, but it was not clear in our minds what was needed; and in any case, our 
existing software would not have been able to produce the goods. Now that 
we know what we are looking for, inquiries so far have not proved fruitful.”

23.7 Packaging: Production and Distribution
Ray Spence is the financial director of STB Company, producing packaging and 
goods for everyday use.
“Sixty percent of the goods sold are locally produced, and the 40% balance of 
goods are imported. Main customers include food producers who need pack-
aging (business to business), wholesale distributors, and key retail accounts.”
Invoices Analysis and Comments on  
Received Results
“In our financial plan, there are 954,000 pieces of goods with $0.45 as average 
Gross Profit per piece. Assuming 50 weeks, the average number per week will 
be 19,080 pieces and the average weekly gross profit contribution $8,586.
“We are taking $0.45 as our Target Average Rate Index or TARI as a benchmark. 
I completed a manual analysis of 10 invoices (Table 23.7-1). These 10 invoices 
represent one week of invoices, which makes the picture even clearer.”

“The analysis indicates the following:
“Gross profit contribution per week is higher than 
• 
planned, which is the result of increasing of sales per week  
(21,000 pieces instead of planned 19,000 pieces).
“Gross Profit % per item is almost on the target level 
• 
15%, one of the most important indicators for us.
“Average Gross Profit per item is almost on the target 
• 
level of $0.45 per item, which is a prime indicator for us 
and one we would like to control.
“Analysis of gross profit per piece per separate customer 
• 
can be compared on a weekly and accumulative basis 
with TARI as in Table 23.7-2.”
“The total results per week give management an opportunity to check the 
gross profit contribution per week with target as well as the gross profit con-
tribution per item with the target. We are also able to check the number of 
items sold, as this also has to be controlled.
“This report has to be accepted by our company to make it easy for manage-
ment to focus on what really matters. This is valid in cooperation with well-
controlled inventory and receivables levels, for purposes of ensuring adequate 
cash flow.
“By upgrading existing software, we can do this report. That is actually the 
advantage of this report—simplicity and transparency. Going further in 
our conclusion and recommendations, we have to focus on efficiency and 
control.

She commences with a sample analysis of 10 loans (Table 23.8-1).
Loan #2 was not paid off by customer because of fraud. That’s why the 
loan amount was added to the total cost. Table 23.8-2 shows the sample is

Results of the Analysis
“The numbers are very close, meaning that these 10 invoices are representa-
tive. The total number of loans revealed from this analysis (23,392) gives us an 
opportunity to compare it with the budgeted sales amount (23,820). In case 
of deviation, we may react quickly in advance to improve the situation before 
the end of the year.
“This analysis could be very helpful since it is an additional tool for evaluating 
the gross profit margin for every customer/loan. It could also be useful for 
defining groups of customers with different profitability. Then I could select 
customers with small or even negative profitability and at the end increase 
overall profit margin.
“Such analysis on the customer level is not possible to conduct manually 
because the bank has hundreds of thousands of customers. Information about 
the loans, customers, and costs is spread among several operating systems used 
in the bank. These systems are not connected with each other, and the data is 
in different formats. The only solution is to implement special software.”

“Multiplying the net interest in the sample by the number of loans for the 
month of October, the net interest income will be $27,771,000. This is very 
close to the actual net interest income earned in October of $28,394,000.
“This analysis confirms the need to revisit our plans and restructure business 
processes in order to gain target margin and profitability.”
Contribution-Based Activity System and Application 
of Target Average Rate Index in the Bank
“Applying the Contribution-Based Activity (CBA) system to the financial plan 
for the year ahead, it is possible to develop a Target Average Rate Index (TARI) 
per $1,000 loan that could be considered by the bank’s management as a 
benchmark and taken into consideration in assessing performance.
“Following this calculation, the interest rate for every credit agreement must 
be set at the level that at least contributes to the bank’s profit not less than 
the TARI benchmark.
“In order to implement appropriate analysis of credit agreements and control 
their contribution to the Bank’s profit, it is necessary to upgrade the existing 
software. The software program should calculate contribution of each credit 
agreement and make a comparison with the TARI. If the contribution is below 
TARI, the program must refer to management for confirmation or change of 
conditions for the loan.”
23.10 Automobile Distribution
Nigel Smith is the CEO of ZZZ Car Sales, a large dealership involved with 
sales and after-sales service of new and used cars.
“The invoice analysis (Table 23.10-1) focuses on the sale of one brand of 
vehicle based on data drawn from a daily sales report.”

Improving Profit

“In analyzing 10 invoices, I discovered the average gross profit margin of 10 
sales is 6.61%. On a daily basis, the salesperson has no financial information in 
the daily sales report, so I have included the column (bank interest) to show 
the interest payment for loan money calculated from the quantity of days in 
stock per car at a bank interest rate of 25% per year.
“The income of the sales department is negative when you take account of 
the bank interest being $78,729 compared with the gross profit of $55,917. 
On a daily basis, unaware of bank interest, the salesperson gives a discount to 
customers.
“If we divide $743,670, the total gross profit of the selected brand, by the 
average gross profit per sale from the invoice analysis (743,670 ÷ 5,592), we 
see that 133 units were assumed to be sold during the year. I can say that the 
sample of 10 invoices was representative, because the sales were 145 units.
“The 10 invoices show the levels of discounts are very wide and illogical. The 
best way to keep control of GP is to implement the process of weekly moni-
toring. First, it is necessary to determine the targeted level of gross profit per 
unit and provide weekly comparison of the result, providing early alert for 
relevant and timely correction.
“Establishing a target average gross profit contribution as a benchmark for the 
sales department would be a significant step forward. It would make a weekly 
appraisal of performance straightforward and simple.”

23.11 Household Equipment
Steve Crane is the marketing manager of VVV company, which imports, ware-
houses, and distributes household equipment.
Table 23.11-1 samples 10 typical invoices.
“To be sure that our extracts are representative, I divided the total gross 
profit for the last year by the average gross profit per sale:
“Gross profit ÷ Average gross profit per item = 308,470 ÷ 5.16 = 59,781 
pieces.
“We sold 59,910 pieces last year. That means that illustrated invoices are 
really representative.
“This analysis helps us to control the gross profit received from every sold 
item to the planned average gross profit. The gross profit per invoice identi-
fies the priority of the sales strategy by indicating which segments are most 
profitable for the company.

“There is additional useful information in the table. If we divide total gross 
profit by average gross profit per invoice, we will have the total quantity of 
transactions made:
“Gross profit $308,470 ÷ ($820.49 ÷ 10) = 3,759 invoices.
“This result is close to the actual figure, and thus we once again confirm 
that our extracts are representative. From this analysis we can approximate 
how many invoices we can expect in the following year in accordance with 
a planned profit level. That allows us to estimate expenses connected with 
order processing. Thus, we could use this information as part of the process 
of financial planning.
“As we have seen, the proposed reports could be very useful for the 
­decision-making process, financial planning, and other activities in the com-
pany. It should be also very evident that preparing these reports does not 
involve a lot of time.
“An upgrade of our primary software system will reduce the working hours 
required for order processing and report preparation, resulting in an increase 
in total productivity without the need for additional personnel expense.
“The sales force can then strive to achieve planned gross sales, of course, but 
they can also use the planned average gross profit per sale (TARI) to guide 
them.
“Comparing results with TARI helps us identify which products are the most 
profitable and which clients bring most profit to company. This will help our 
sales force to identify products and clients segments on which they have to 
focus their attention. In consequence, we could achieve the highest results.”
23.12 Specialized Farming Equipment
Marianne Angostini is the CEO of NNN company, which distributes, installs, 
and services technological equipment for farms involved in specialized plant-
ing and harvesting. It purchases, distributes, and installs products from differ-
ent international suppliers.
Marianne commences with an invoice analysis of the key products (Table 23.12-1).

Chapter 23 | 14 Businesses Explore CBA/TARI 
186
“The calculation of gross profit margin from 10 analyzed invoices resulted in 
16.09%, which is close to the company’s overall gross profit of 17%. It indicates 
the sample of 10 invoices was representative.
“The analysis shows that it is most profitable for the company to sell product C, 
as its cost price is not high, the time needed for installation is low (2–4 days, 
in comparison to 35–60 days for Product A), and the number of technicians 
required is not labor intensive.7
“Also the demand for product C is quite stable and in certain times of the 
year is very high. To illustrate, let’s take an example. We can sell 13 of product 
C to receive the same gross profit of 1 product A. But to sell 1 product A, we 
need to spend much more time than we do to sell product C.
“As for improvements in software, I can see that an upgrade will help the 
company to significantly improve gross profit performance, compared with 
the system now in use.”

23.13 Importing and Distributing
Michael Howe is the marketing manager for JKL, a company importing and 
distributing products to the final customers through a dealer network.
Table 23.13-1 shows an invoice analysis for the company’s three main direc-
tions: (1) consumer products, (2) professional products, and (3) spare parts.
Consumer Products
“In the table, we can see that the levels of gross profits are very wide, rang-
ing from 3% to 24%. The average gross profit is about 8%, and average gross 
profit per item is $27.33. The consumer product range is very sensitive to the 
prices, and in previous years the company used different discount programs to 
boost sales, which from one side can increase the turnover but from another 
side can decrease company gross profit.

“Invoices 9 and 10 represent one of our discount programs; as a result, we had 
small gross profit but big turnover. Also, the company was selling out the old 
products from our stock by means of reducing price. This action helped us to 
decrease stock expenses and increase turnover, but the gross profit on these 
sales was not very high. Invoice 8 represents the selling out of old models.”   
Professional Products
“Professional products are more expensive than consumer products and the 
gross profit is also higher. The reason is that all consumer goods are sold 
from shops, whereas professional products need to be demonstrated, requir-
ing additional expenses, managerial qualification, and effort. In the table we can 
also see that the level of gross profits range from 15% to 30%. The results of 
this are games with discount in order to boost sales.

Spare Parts
“We can see that the average gross profit margin spare part is 34%, which is 
obviously higher than in selling consumer and professional goods. The com-
pany understands that in the current economic climate, a customer will prefer 
to repair the old than pay for new equipment.
“Based on this prediction, the company expected an increase in selling spare 
parts and decided to increase the price accordingly with a resulting increase 
in gross profit contribution, where we see a fluctuation of from 30% to 40% 
due to discounting.
“The invoice analyses show me that all three segments are heading in totally 
different directions from the company’s official position relating to gross profit 
contribution, gross profit margin percentage, gross profit per item, and pricing 
policy in general.
“Based on that, I find it very important that management redesign our cur-
rent reporting system in order to see separate reports on each of the three 
product segments. I see that is also very important that an individual target 
average rate index—TARI—be established as a benchmark for each segment 
in order to compare the received result with TARI at weekly intervals, and if 
necessary provide preventive action.

23.14 Commercial Vehicle Sales
Nick Bronsen is the marketing manager for BBB, a company importing com-
mercial vehicles and overseeing their sales through the dealers’ network. In 
addition, the company provides spare parts, after-sales service, and sales of 
used trucks.
Nick analyzed 10 representative invoices in Table 23.14-1.
“The annual gross profit margin taken from the accounts is 14.55%.
“The average value of the sample invoices is 14.06%. The difference is 0.49%, 
or in percentage terms 3.4%. So our result deriving from 10 invoices is close 
to being representative and serves our purpose.”

Gross Profit per Sale
“In the Invoice Analysis, we see that levels of profitability are quite different. 
Analyzing this situation I found the following main reasons:
“Profit depends significantly upon the range of vehicle. 
• 
For example, invoice A*80/, with minimum level of gross 
profit 6.37%, refers to the sale of a heavy truck. At the 
same time, this invoice has one of the highest unit price, 
whereas absolute value of gross profit of $3,792 corre-
sponds to $3,818 of invoice A*85/07 with gross profit % 
equal to 16.95%.
“Profitability also depends upon the type of buyer. There 
• 
are sales to the dealers, but there are also sales to the final 
customers, mainly owners of big fleets, and key accounts. 
Discounts to the clients are significantly lower than dis-
counts given to the dealers. It corresponds to the differ-
ence in profitability equal to 4.5% of gross profit %. As an 
example, we could look at invoices A*81/ and A*85/.”
Suggestions for Financial Planning and Existing  
Corporate Software
“On the basis of the analysis, we have seen that profitability of the company 
is subjected to several important parameters: types of products, levels of dis-
counts, et cetera.
“The difference in gross profit performance per sale can be very high in abso-
lute and percentage value. In such a situation, it becomes very important 
to carry out a correct commercial policy, taking into consideration market 
opportunities, dealer activity, and desirable profitability of the company.
“For financial planning, I would suggest changing our current approach to the 
basic information and reporting system.
“Right now we make two kinds of budgets: commercial people plan unit and 
model sales, whereas financial people plan annual gross profit (AGP).
“In general, commercial people do not care about AGP, and financial people 
do not care about units and models. It is clear that such a situation is mislead-
ing. That is why I would suggest modifying the existing planning system and 
developing new software, which could give us a possibility to plan our activity 
as a whole.”

Chapter 23 | 14 Businesses Explore CBA/TARI

“The useful and logic solution could be implementation of Contribution-
Based Activity with corresponding Target Average Rate Indexes. The CBA is 
able to establish capacity utilization along with an overview of contribution 
of services, products, and customers, in a matter of minutes from a sample of 
invoices.”
Comment
These 14 “findings” highlight the value of reviewing and analyzing a represen-
tative sample of invoices.
Each participant saw added value in establishing a target average rate index 
(TARI) as a basis for pricing and monitoring output.
In each case, the insights gained pointed to a need for more relevant feedback 
from existing information systems.
Several of the preceding 22 chapters have pointed to the importance of what 
amounts to a “keyhole” view of a business, by means of an invoice analysis. 
We have also seen that the insight gained is but the first step on the road to 
putting CBA/TARI concepts into play. The hard part is sustaining a disciplined 
follow-through to make it happen.

1For those looking to compare CBA with systems such as Absorption Costing, Marginal 
Costing, or Time-Based ABC, the key difference lies in CBA’s focus on tracking the targeted 
number of unit-contributions required to cover expenses plus profit. Costing systems 
focus on the accuracy of the unit cost and assume management will apply a markup 
percentage to cover profit.

Diagnosing Problems
Using a real-life case study, participants in accounting firm–sponsored work-
shops in several Western, English-speaking countries were invited to assume 
they were interviewing the manager of a print-jobbing firm in an attempt to 
diagnose the cause of his problem.
The manager said he was adding 25% to all jobs to cover profit, but had ended 
the past two years with less than a 5% net profit.
Presented with a summarized profit-and-loss trend (Table A-1), and assuming 
no change in work in progress or stock on hand, participants were asked to 
write out their initial diagnostic question.
Of the 1,754 responses handed in:
• 
1,262, or 72%, queried the increased level of expenses and 
asked for more details,
• 
351, or 20%, queried the increased cost of materials and the 
level of markups,
• 
88, or 5%, queried a variety of matters ranging from product 
mix to market competition, and
• 
53, or 3%, queried the level of productivity and asked for 
­staffing details.

Identifying Productivity
Asked what role they thought the level of productivity would play, there was 
general agreement that it would be an important factor, but given the infor-
mation available, there was no way of identifying it, and nobody was aware of 
any simple cost-effective technique that would enable a comparison of actual 
output with input.
It was time to demonstrate such a technique. Using a representative sample of 
invoices, billed production hours were extracted from job sheets and analyzed 
as shown in Table A-2.
With a gross profit contribution of $800,000 for the most recent year and 
an average gross profit contribution of $50 per billed hour, it was possible to 
provide a close estimate of hours billed:
Gross Profit Contribution $800,000    = 16,000 hours
$50.00
The printing firm employed 18 for hands-on production, which, with overtime, 
amounted to 36,000 hours available for charging to jobs.
Productivity 16,000 hours × 100    = 44.44%
36,000 hours
8 hours × 44.44% = 3 hours, 33 minutes billed hours per day per production

It was apparent that if the business broke even at 44% productivity, billings  
at 60% productivity, using similar charge-out rates, could potentially result in 
an additional $280,000 contribution to the bottom line—less any additional 
variable costs such as power.
(60% × 36,000 hours) = 21,600 hours
• 
(21,600 hours – 16,000 hours) = 5,600 hours
• 
(5,600 hours × $50) = $280,000
• 
Knowing the level of productivity opens up the possibility of securing ­additional 
business at contribution rates lower than $50 and achieving a ­substantial 
profit.
Establishing TARI for a Manufacturing Business
The Invoice Analysis demonstrates the relationship between financial and 
physical “levers” of contribution2 and productivity at play, the timely man-
agement of which is fundamental to profitable performance of any business, 
whatever its classification.
A significant advantage of this approach is the ability to start tracking actual 
results for comparison with a target (TARI—Target Average Rate Index) at 
the outset, without the need to spend time analyzing past results.
Unfortunately for business in general, current commercial software does 
not make it easy to relate the contributions flowing from an invoice with 
the relevant units of activity in order to demonstrate unit-contribution for 
comparison with TARI. Rather, invoicing systems extract typical invoice data 
from financial files that remain separate from the job files in management 
accounts.
As a result, extensive management feedback reports, covering variances from 
target in productivity and material usage, normally presented well after the 
month to which the data refers, tend to play little part in the daily business of 
quoting and pricing.
Yet at the time of quoting, pricing, or invoicing, knowing whether a contribu-
tion is above or below a target contribution can prove instrumental to sur-
vival and profitable performance.
The first step is to establish a benchmark, and for this we will use a jobbing 
company, HICo (Table A-3).
2Gross profit contribution = sales less materials or goods at cost. Also referred to simply 
as contribution.

Improving Profit
197
In order to emphasize its statistical status as a benchmark, target average 
contribution is referred to as the target average rate index.
Comparing the contribution per hour of an invoice with a TARI of $60 
(Table A-4) raises the question as to how the outcome could have been 
improved at the time of quoting.
Could the work have been done in 100 hours rather than 120? Could materi-
als be acquired at a better price than $2,000—say, for $1,800?
One thing is for sure: it is not possible to improve on an unknown, so if the 
unit contribution of an invoiced sale cannot be compared with its TARI equiv-
alent, it is unlikely there will be any change for the better.
Achieving Competitive Advantage
Important as it is to compare the average unit contribution3 of a job with 
TARI, it is equally important to do so in full knowledge of the total contribu-
tion of all jobs invoiced in the target period.
This means recording billings so that the total contribution as well as the aver-
age unit contribution can be compared with target on an accumulative basis. 
Table A-5 provides an example of HICo a few weeks down the track.

Results to date show HICo is $1,050 ahead of target contribution and billing 
65 more hours at a rate very close to the TARI of $60.
The company is in a position to get a foot in the door of a desirable customer 
by intentionally underquoting, in the knowledge that it:
a)	 Can afford to underquote by up to $1,500 without 
impacting target contribution,
b)	 Has the advantage over a competitor of knowing where 
it stands in relation to its bottom line when quoting.
Simple as it is, achieving competitive advantage calls for the discipline involved 
in identifying and tracking billed output weekly and accumulatively. Because 
current commercial software, driven largely by traditional accounting meth-
odology, does not seamlessly connect the invoiced amount with the unit of 
activity (a billed production-hour in the case of HICo), it will be necessary to 
input the connection manually or develop software to do it.
Establishing a TARI for a Retail Business
Similar methodology applies in RTCo, a hypothetical retail or wholesale outlet, 
where sales are priced by marking up the cost of goods sold. In order to meet 
the desired profit for a given period, the retail outlet will need to make as 
many sales as necessary to provide the overall contribution needed to cover 
in-house expenses plus profit.

The targeted number of sales will be confined to the capacity of staff to handle 
throughput. Interfirm comparison data provides an indication of productivity 
levels for the type of outlet—such as gross sales per staff member or a target 
of four sales an hour (Table A-6).
Sales for a day or a week can then be compared with TARI (Table A-7).
Undershooting TARI by $5 a sale indicates the need to review what is hap-
pening on the shop floor. Is markup being correctly applied? Is discounting 
taking place? What stock is the store promoting at the expense of the more 
profitable items?
In the case of retail, where software is programmed to reveal the unit4 con-
tribution as a percentage to sale, there is the same absence of perceived need 
to compare the unit financial contribution with a target, whether singly per 
transaction or accumulatively by the day or week.
As data is built up day by day or week by week, the invoice analysis will pro-
vide a summary of sales that allows one to compare the average contribution 
per sale with TARI as well as the number of sales with target. Table A-8 pro-
vides an example.

Contribution percentage on cost of goods is 3 percentage points below tar-
get, possibly due to discounting or inadequate markup; the number of sales 
is also down 24 from target. The good news is that the sales are $933 higher 
than target, resulting in an average contribution greater than target, suggest-
ing more aggressive salesmanship, improved product mix, or maybe pruning 
lower-priced items from the inventory.5

Accuracy of Sample Using Invoice Analysis
The reaction of a client viewing hourly contributions ranging from $40 to 
$89 as in XYCo (Table A-2) is invariably one of surprise if not shock, and the 
question arises as to whether such a small sample of invoices could provide a 
reasonably accurate representation of the whole—particularly in the case of 
high- and low-value products or departments/branches involved in different 
activities.
While the selection of a “representative” sample is rightfully subject to criti-
cism as being highly subjective, inputting more invoices can easily dispel con-
cerns about the reliability of data.
Use of a representative sample of invoices to identify actual output for com-
parison with input, checked for reliability,6 has proven to be an effective 
diagnostic tool, applicable across the spectrum of business categories from 
manufacturing, trades, contracting, and hospitality to the service professions.
In the case of a business marketing high- as well as low-value products, expe-
rience suggests that in the first instance, it is enough to take a sample across 
the range and review whether a more departmentally specific approach would 
have greater relevance.
For example, in a business with several branches and invoices ranging in price 
from $100 to $100,000, the average contribution of $6,000 is purely a statistic, 
but is nevertheless a basis upon which each branch could begin the process of 
tracking and improving the branch average contribution per sale.
Sustaining Competitive Advantage
Given increased output because of an improved level of productivity, can 
the average contribution per unit of output be sustained in a competitive 
market?
As we have seen, the average contribution is the average of a range of contri-
butions. Awareness of such a range invariably prompts a search for ways and 
means of maximizing the highs and minimizing the lows.
6Reliability, or confidence level, can be checked by comparing the contribution percentage 
of the sample with the percentage in the profit-and-loss statement, or by comparing the 
average contribution of the sample with the overall average contribution obtained by 
dividing total contribution by the total number of invoices.

Appendix A | Questions Answered

In the case of XYCo, the unit average gross profit contribution of $50 revealed 
in the invoice analysis (Table A-2) reflects the pricing and productivity of past 
performance in which output rated 44% or 16,000 hours out of a potential 
36,000 hours. Looking ahead to an improved performance in output, the ques-
tion arises as to whether the average of $50 per unit is sustainable in the 
event of targeting say, 20,000 billable hours?
As we saw in the case of Job 143 in Table A-4, in cases where the quoted gross 
profit contribution per hour of $47 falls below a TARI of $60, production 
times and/or the cost of materials would be reassessed. A manager in conjunc-
tion with the supervisor could work out ways and means of completing the 
job in closer to 100 hours:
(120 hours × $47) = $5,640. (100 hours × $60) = $6,000.
It is this step-by-step approach to quoting and pricing in conjunction with 
tracking actual hours charged and billed to jobs on a week-by-week basis that 
begins to impact the bottom line, slowly at first and then quite dramatically. 
For example, in Table A-10, using a TARI of $50 based on 400 billed hours a 
week, we compare actual results with target actual after 5 weeks.
Now let’s look at the 10-week period in (Table A-11).

The overall contribution is ahead due to an increase in the unit contribution, 
while units of activity have yet to reach target. It demonstrates a general rule 
that it is easier to improve unit contribution than overall productivity; the  
latter invariably requires more time. In other words, focusing on improving 
work method and efficiency per job can improve the the contribution for the job. 
But improving billed output overall calls for scheduling of job throughput with 
minimum of delay between jobs—a process that doesn’t happen overnight.

Definition  
of Terms
Activity refers to the key activity fundamental to and driving all other activi-
ties. It can be the billed production-hours1 or minutes, number of sales, meals 
(covers) served, tons per mile, skins tanned, and so forth.
Actual vs. Potential refers to the actual output of a business compared with 
its potential output, given the available resources of personnel, equipment, and 
technology.
Added Value refers to the amount added to the cost of materials/goods 
toward covering expenses plus profit. Applied as an add-on to cost of materi-
als/goods, it is also referred to as Gross Profit or Gross Profit Contribution 
or, simply, Contribution.
Average Rate Index (ARI) refers to the average of units of activity derived 
from analyzing past performance. It is historical fact, not targeted. (See Target 
Average Rate Index.)
Capacity refers to the output potential of a business. For example, “At 80% 
of capacity, the business produces 8,000 widgets,” meaning that at 100% capac-
ity, the business is capable of producing 10,000 widgets.
Chargeable Activity is the same as billed or Invoiced Activity.
Contribution refers to the amount added to the cost of materials/goods 
toward covering expenses plus profit. Total contribution for a period, divided 
by planned or targeted number of units of activity, results in a target average

A P P E N D I X
1A production-hour (or minute, etc.) only becomes an effective unit of activity if it is billable. 
In other words, a unit of activity makes no contribution to the bottom line unless it is billed.

Appendix C | Definition of Terms

contribution per unit—known as target average rate index (TARI), to 
emphasize that it is a benchmark against which quoted or priced unit-contri-
butions can be measured or compared.
Efficiency of an action or a process will impact productivity. A business can 
increase productivity by improving the work method and reducing the time 
involved in carrying out an activity. (Chapter 19 provides a good example).
Gross Profit in this book refers to the margin between sales and cost of 
goods or materials. It is often referred to as Contribution or Added Value. 
There is no universal agreement on the definition of gross profit. In manu-
facturing and similar businesses, it is frequently defined as sales less (cost of 
materials + factory-on, or variable, costs). Can also be defined as expenses + 
profit, where expenses and profit refer to operational expenses and profit and 
exclude cost of goods or materials and outsourced work.
Invoice/Invoice Activity is the same as billing; it refers to the amount charged 
out to customers. Tax is excluded when analyzing invoices or billings.
Net Profit refers to the bottom line after all operational and nonoperational 
income and expenditure is accounted for.
On-Costs refers to costs that are added on such as rent, power, depreciation, 
and so forth.
Output Activity refers to the units of key activity, such as hours, minutes, 
number of sales, meals (covers), or room-nights, that can be charged and 
invoiced. It is often referred to as “productive or billed units of activity” as 
compared with “available units of activity.”
Profit refers to the bottom line, or what is left over after all operational 
income and expenses are accounted for.
Productivity refers to output, measurable as billed units of output as a per-
centage of available units of output. The more efficient the process, the more 
the output per unit of input.
Rate is short for the gross profit per unit of output activity.
Revenue is sales by another name, often used by professional businesses that 
bill fees.
Target Average Rate refers to the average gross profit contribution per unit 
of output activity that has been planned as a target benchmark. See Average 
Rate Index (ARI).
Target Average Rate Index (TARI) is the same as Target Average Rate, 
but with Index added to emphasize its status as a benchmark and not a cost 
to be applied.
Unit refers to a single unit of output activity such as a production- (person) or 
machine-hour or minute, a sale, a meal (cover), a ton per mile, and so forth.

The Business 
Wheel
A wheel that operates around a well-maintained hub (Figure D-1), with spokes 
of even length and at even tension, is far more likely to perform in a balanced 
state than a wheel with uneven spokes under varying tension that put undue 
pressure on the hub.

Figure D-1. The Business Wheel with well-balanced spokes. TARI = Target Average Rate Index 
(Target Average Gross Profit Contribution per unit of Targeted Output Activity1). Contribution 
refers to gross profit (or added value) calculated as sales less cost of goods or materials used.
1Output activity refers to physically measurable units of key activity traceable in output, like 
minutes, hours, number of sales, meals (covers), tons, kilometers, cans of beans, and the like.

Appendix D | The Business Wheel
210
Lacking awareness or feedback on what really drives the hub of business, the 
great majority of business wheels remain elliptical, resulting in stress on all 
parts. This occurs when one department pulls ahead of the others. For example, 
maybe marketing gains orders at a discount with special credit arrangements. 
That puts pressure on supply, cash flow, and the bottom line. Or production 
races ahead of demand and fills the warehouse with expensive inventory, put-
ting pressure on marketing, purchases of materials, and cash flow.
Such actions inevitably impact the hub of a wheel targeted to cover a certain 
distance (gross profit contribution) at an average speed (TARI).
Check Your Wheel!
After explaining to 12 senior managers how various departments act as spokes 
around a hub, I asked them to view their businesses in a wheel format, grading 
each departmental spoke on a 1–10 scale and joining the points together.2
The illustrations speak for themselves (Figure D-2).
Figure D-2.  Uneven spokes result in businesses that don’t roll smoothly into the market
2A preceding exercise conducted with this group called for the spokes to be labeled a little 
differently from the pie chart in Figure D-1, but the essential idea remains.

Improving Profit
211
Participants in the exercise headed up various functional departments such 
as finance, production, marketing, and human resources, which would have 
influenced their ratings to some degree. For example, the production execu-
tive would be likely to favor production over marketing and vice versa. Even 
so, extraneous economic factors aside, a balanced performance points to a 
meaningful correlation between a profitably performing hub and spokes under 
equal tension.

Epilogue: Why 
Contribution 
Metrics? 
As a young man, I loved heading down to the sea in ships that made their 
way to distant ports of the world to trade cargoes of many kinds. Once we 
were clear of the noise, smells, pollution, and turmoil of port and out to sea, a 
smooth and steady rhythm settled upon the ship. Leaving loved ones behind, 
we went about our duties dulled by sweet sorrow until awaking like new 
beings to the movement of long swells beneath the keel, albatross soaring on 
a gentle breeze, and luminous stars in a clear sky.
An influence stronger than the sea drew me ashore where, like a fish out of 
water, I floundered in a strange and hostile environment. Someone said, “Study 
accounting by correspondence,” and that is what I did, disliking the subject so 
much that I worked all hours to qualify in record time.
Once qualified as a CPA, the college asked me to take on the job of a state 
principal. I quickly accepted and in my enthusiasm for the course, I enrolled 
a record number of students—so many that the CEO asked me to explain 
my methods to the other principals. When they discovered I had nothing to 
impart about techniques of marketing or salesmanship, but was merely oper-
ating out of enthusiasm, their ballooning interest deflated.
Seeking truth, I studied all the subjects in philosophy and political science, 
qualifying with a bachelor of arts degree and a Commonwealth Government 
prize. Truth still elusive, I signed on for a thesis on the subject of Jean-Jacques 
E

Epilogue | Why Contribution Metrics? 
Rousseau’s political obligation and the general will. Upon completing the the-
sis and getting no closer to truth with an MA in philosophy, I joined an interna-
tional consulting group, hoping at least to find the truth about big business.
I learned that big business was in most cases an amalgam of branches or 
departments, and that success within a business had as much to do with nepo-
tism and politics as competence.
Responding to the call for those with practical as well as academic qualifica-
tions, I took on a role as senior lecturer in accounting and business studies in 
a university offering degrees “similar to but different from” traditional univer-
sities. The university gained a reputation for graduating “practically oriented” 
students, and I became head of school, developing contacts with businesses 
locally and nationally. In those days, corporate planning was the flavor of the 
month and we were able to get the attention and active participation of CEOs 
of major industries in the first Corporate Planning Conference held in the 
country.
Offered a foundation chair as professor and head of the Department of 
Accounting and Business Studies at the University of Technology in Papua 
New Guinea (PNG), I signed a five-year contract. Once I was in situ, the posi-
tion opened up active participation with the United Nations Committee on 
Small Business Development in South East Asia, and I was invited to join the 
country’s National Economic Advisory Council.
In an attempt to reconcile the significant differences between a Western-driven 
approach to business development with local cultural attitudes, I completed a 
PhD on a strategy for small business development in PNG.
The end of the contract coincided with the need for our son to attend high 
school, so my family relocated to a research position in a university town 
back in Australia. The research focused on small-medium enterprises, and it 
was here that I came to see what we were teaching in accounting and finance 
had little relevance to the management decision-making needs of business in 
general, small or large. How best to identify and then resolve those needs was 
to absorb my time and energy in the years ahead.
In the process, I came to see that business was as much a part of the main-
stream of life as art, science, sports, or philosophy. It provides food to eat, 
facilities to communicate, transport for trade and travel, gas, electricity, water, 
houses, and hospitals. It can be likened to a bloodstream, sustaining life as we 
know it on this planet, with shortage and starvation arising from natural or 
artificial blockages.
I saw that failure of a business follows a long period of stress for owners, man-
agers, and families; for staff and their families; for unpaid suppliers and their 
families; and, to a lesser degree, the surrounding community. Moreover, I saw 
the cumulative effect of many failures influencing the medical, social, economic,

and spiritual well-being of a nation. I saw millions upon millions of dollars 
raised in search of cures for cancer, but little research into the malignancy of 
problems at work and in business as a prime source of cancer in the human 
body.
Conversely, I saw how the success of a business, arrived at by honest endeavor 
and competent management, does more for the well-being of a nation than 
any tonic medicine has been able to devise.

The Apress Business Team

This book is dedicated to my wife Carolyn,  
without whose love, patience, and prayerful  
support, along with Paul and Suzy’s belief that the 
concepts in this book are “awesomely simple” and 
should be made known to businesses everywhere,  
it is unlikely this book would have been written.

Foreword
I first met Keith when he was delivering a seminar on his approach to improving 
business performance, which is the subject of this book. I was interested by his 
claim that you could manage a business by focusing on two key levers, which, if 
correctly identified, could help you steer the business to growth and prosperity.
I had by that time been instrumental in improving the performance of many 
blue chip companies while working for a leading international business 
consultancy group. As a result, it seemed clear to me that improving business 
performance was not entirely straightforward and required the knowledge 
and experience of the complete range of functional and process management 
disciplines, which I had acquired over the years.
I found his concepts interesting, but, like many people who are first introduced  
to this approach, I did not really grasp the underlying principles, and so 
concluded it was too simplistic to have any meaningful application in my 
world of business (where I believed the problems were much more complex 
and thereby required more sophisticated solutions).
It was about a year later that our paths crossed again while he was working in 
the UK, applying his ideas. He persuaded me that if you could create the right 
focus in business, develop an expectation of success, and create a simple 
plan that linked activity to financials, this would in itself deliver significant 
improvement in profitability. I agreed to try his concepts on the business  
I was currently consulting, even though I was incredulous at his claims of the 
scale of improvement.
Over the next few weeks, Keith would constantly remind me about TARI, 
saying, “Just trust me and follow the process and you will see the profit 
improvement you seek.” This was an act of faith, as this process was so 
different from the well-established approaches to business improvement that 
had delivered so much success for my colleagues and me.
What I experienced was a revelation. The owner, who had low aspirations 
and a lack of direction, saw his business transformed in less than a year into 
a dynamic operation with a growth in profitability I would only expect to see 
in a Disney movie. I became a firm believer in Keith’s concepts, but surprised 
it had taken me so long to grasp such an obvious truth. Even then I was not 
convinced the concepts would work in larger organizations.

Foreword 
Sometime later, I was consulting with a much larger business that was losing 
money and ridden with debt. We were working on many issues that needed 
to be resolved. One evening, while I was discussing the issues over a glass 
of wine with Keith, he suggested I apply his concepts to this company. I was 
skeptical whether we would get much benefit for the effort we would need 
to invest in this larger and more sophisticated organization, although I could 
see merit in doing some product analysis.
The journey that followed was different from what I had expected. What I 
had not realized was that the ability of the various departmental managers 
to contribute was being clouded by their functional performance measures 
and the opaqueness of costing and financial systems. (This was not the first 
time I had come across senior business managers who could not relate the 
profits on a financial statement to their own activities.) What was more, the 
company’s workers at all levels down to the shop floor wanted the company 
to survive, but did not have the focus or the understanding of how they could 
contribute to making the company a success.
Keith’s concepts provided the company with this much-needed focus and 
empowered the organization very quickly. Sales and production worked 
on business activity levels; designers redesigned product with marketing 
using the added-value-per-hour concept; sales became much more effective 
in managing product margins; shop floor operators could directly relate 
their efforts to the company’s profitability; and managers had a simple and 
understandable way of driving the business forward that related their efforts 
to the profitability of the business. In three years, the debts were cleared and 
the company was making healthy operating profits.
I believe Keith’s work will one day be regarded as a landmark contribution 
to business owners and managers around the world. I encourage you to 
read this book, and I hope that you will find the success that I have found by 
applying Keith’s concepts to your organization.

Acknowledgments
A grain of sand can achieve little or nothing by itself, but in conjunction with 
many other grains it can be used to build dams, erect houses, and construct 
highways; so it is with ideas. Without the active support of members of 
the accounting profession concerned about doing more for their clients, 
the concepts underlying CBA and TARI, described in this book, would have 
remained just an idea. 
I acknowledge in particular:
The original group of 17 who came together at St John’s College, University 
of Queensland, and who opened up their practices to permit access to their 
clients.
My computer partner, Trevor Watters, a member of that original group and an 
accountant turned software guru, whose unique skills made the development 
of software available, initially for the accounting profession and subsequently 
for the business end user.
David Hartley, developer of the world’s first professional accounting system, 
who made it possible for me to address those accountants from which the 
original group was selected and who has continued to provide valuable 
assistance over the years. 
Several hundred partners of accounting practices worldwide who willingly 
gave time and energy to actively introduce the concepts to their client base.
Owners and managers of businesses, small and large, who have participated 
and enjoyed the benefits firsthand.
And not least, I want to acknowledge Jeff Olson, editor, whose sharp eye and 
mature empathy for the subject matter has been instrumental in shaping the 
contents for layperson as well as professional; Rita Fernando, coordinating 
editor, whose cheerful support guided the process; and James Fraleigh, copy 
editor, whose eye for detail is beyond remarkable! Thank you Jeff, thank you 
Rita, thank you James, and thanks to members of the team standing behind 
you. Please know you are all truly appreciated.
On behalf of myself and the unnumbered businesses that will find new 
strength, direction, and purpose from applying the concepts contained in this 
book, I salute you all.
