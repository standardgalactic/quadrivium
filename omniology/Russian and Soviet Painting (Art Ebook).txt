Xhis
third
exhibition
in the
cultural exchange be-
tween the Museums of the Soviet Union and The Met-
ropolitan Museum of Art, presented first in New York
and later in San Francisco, encompasses the full range
of painting in Russia from the fourteenth century to the
present. The selection begins with icons in which the
formal and hieratic style of the Byzantine tradition
is
wedded
to
a uniquely Russian
lyricism;
it continues
through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when
Russian painting was closely allied to European move-
ments such as Romanticism and Realism, yet was in-
vested with
a
distincdy
national
character
in which
religious mysticism
easily
coexisted with
reportorial
objectivity. The selection continues with the emergence
of abstraction in the early years of the twentieth cent-
ury and concludes with examples of Soviet
Socialist
realism.
An exhibition of Russian and Soviet painting of this
scope and this magnitude has not heretofore been seen
in the United States. For this reason alone the occasion
is one
of historic importance
to both
Russians and
Americans.
It becomes increasingly clear that Russia,
along with her accomplishments in literature and music,
produced a visual art of the highest caliber. Of course,
Russian art contains its own idiosyncracies, especially in
its
relation
to
Russia's
social and
political history
from the princes of ancient Russia
to Catherine
the
Great, from Alexander
I to the 1917 Revolution and
through to today. But beyond the specific historical and
national connotations of the paintings on view, they
carry a particular resonance for the American visitor.
We are struck by the close and curious parallels between
the development
of the Russian
style and our own
artistic
traditions,
especially
those
of the
nineteenth
century. These points of convergence suggest a major
field for inquiry and future research
The
exhibition
is
being held
at the Metropolitan
Museum concurrently with The Glory of Russian Cos-
tume, the second show of the
cultural exchange
(its
counterpart from the Metropolitan to the Soviet Union
is an exhibition of pre-Columbian gold). The concur-
rence provides a dramatic opportunity for one to gain a
broader, fuller picture of Russian life and art during a
period of centuries.
In exchange for this exhibition of Russian and Soviet
painting the Metropolitan will be sending to museums
in Leningrad, Moscow, and Minsk
an exhibition of
American painting entided Representations of America,
organized by the Metropolitan with the cooperation of
The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. The plan-
ning
of
this
exhibition
has
been
done
by
Henry
Geldzahler, Curator of Twentieth Century Art, with the
assistance of the staff at the Metropolitan, in collabora-
tion with Ian White, Director, The Fine Arts Museums
of San Francisco, and Thomas Garver, Curator of Ex-
hibitions, The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.
The success of our exchange program would have
been impossible without the support of Petr Demichev,
Minister of Culture of the USSR, and the cooperation
of the Ministry of Culture. Vladimir Popov, Deputy
Minister of the Ministry of Culture, and Alexander
Khalturin, Head of the Arts Department of the Minis-
try of Culture, conducted negotiations with Philippe de
Montebello and me.
Anatoly Djuchev, Head of the
Foreign Department
at the Ministry of Culture, was
also very helpful in the planning. James F. Pilgrim, the
Metropolitan's
Deputy
Vice-director
for
Curatorial
Affairs,
assisted
at various
stages of the negotiations.
Victor Sakovich, Cultural Counselor of the Embassy
of the USSR in Washington, Ivan A. Kouznetsov, Con-
sul-Designate of the Consulate General of the USSR in
New York, and Peter Solmssen of the U.S. Department
of State have been very
7 helpful.
I would like to mention in particular the generosity
and cooperation of P.
I. Lebedev, Director of the State
Tretiakov
Gallery, Moscow,
Vitalii
Manin, Deputy
Director of the Tretiakov
Gallery, and V A.
Push-
kariev, Director of the Russian Museum, Leningrad.

Most of the paintings in the exhibition come from these
two museums.
Special thanks must go to John E. Bowlt, Associate
Professor at The University of Texas at Austin, who
served
as
special
consultant
for
the
exhibition.
His
expertise
in the history of Russian painting has been
invaluable, and we are grateful to him not only for his
translation of the Russian text of the catalogue but for
compiling the bibliography and writing the foreword.
Coordination of the exhibition
at the Metropolitan
was the responsibility of Katharine Baetjer, Associate
Curator of European Paintings. John Buchanan, Special
Assistant to the Director, Herbert Moskowitz, Associ-
ate Registrar, Dianne Dwyer, and Alain Goldrach, As-
sistant Conservators, and Herbert F. Schmidt, Manager,
Design Department, were
all most helpful. A special
note of appreciation goes to Vera K. Ostoia, recently
retired from the Department of Medieval Art, and to
Natalie Spassky, Associate Curator, American Paintings
and
Sculpture, who could be counted on for
instant
translations of documents submitted in Russian.
Russian

Painting
at
the
Metropolitan
Museum,
as well as the exhibition of pre-Columbian
Gold in the Soviet Union were made possible by a grant
from the Alcoa Foundation. The Metropolitan Museum
is deeply grateful to the Foundation, and especially so
to its president, Arthur M. Doty, who will retire at the
end
of
1977
after
years
of leadership
in advancing
business support of the
arts, both in this country and
abroad

Foreword:
Between East and West

last time
that the American public viewed
a
large exhibition of Russian art from the Soviet Union
was
in
1924 when
the
Russian
Art
Exhibition was
mounted at the Grand Central Palace, New York. Al-
though
Igor
Grabar,
the
artist and
critic and
chief
curator with the exhibition, asserted that there "wasn't a
single negative evaluation," 1 the exhibition had a very
mixed reception. Americans then had little idea of what
to expect from Russian art and, in any case, the political
overtones (the exhibition opened only seven years after
the Bolshevik coup) were particularly resonant. Unfor-
tunately, more than
fifty years
later, we
still lack an
essential understanding of the development of Russian
art. True, within the last few years American galleries
and museums have organized a number of exhibitions
related to various aspects of Russian
art, but by and
large these have treated of specific periods such as the
ancient Russian icon or the twentieth-century avant-
garde. The current exhibition encompasses all the prin-
cipal trends of Russian and Soviet painting, although
the exigencies of transportation, material condition, and
other factors have prevented the inclusion of certain
desirable works. Repin's celebrated Volga Boatmen and
Vrubel's Demon Downcast are among the works affected
by the inevitable restrictions, but despite these gaps the
exhibition does provide a reliable synopsis of the gen-
eral evolution of Russian and Soviet art.
One of the most intriguing facts about Russian art is
that,
apart from the
disciplines of icon painting and
wood-carving,
its
stylistic
traditions
do
not
deviate
radically from those of the European schools, at least
during the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries. Fur-
thermore,
a number of close
parallels
exist between
Russian and American
art of the same
period. The
artistic correspondences
that
spring
to mind—Boro-
vikovsky
and
Gainsborough,
Venetsianov
and
the
Barbizons, Borisov-Musatov and Maurice Denis—offer
material for comparative research, but at this juncture
more questions will be raised than answered.
It
is curious to recall that none of the great Russian
portrait-painters of the late eighteenth and early nine-
teenth centuries—Rokotov, Levitsky, and Borovikov-
sky—ever visited western Europe and that, in the case
of Rokotov and Borovikovsky,
their
artistic training
was of a rather desultory kind. Against the nondescript
background of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth
centuries, a time of troubles in art as much as in politics,
this
trio of
artists
appears
as
a sudden and
brilliant
constellation.
As
in
the
case
of Gainsborough
and
Romney, so here the level of technical accomplishment
was of the highest. Strange as it may seem, a measure of
this bravura returned to Russian art only in the early
twentieth century with the set and costume designs of
Diaghilev's
Ballets Russes (1909-29).
It
is
really no
great
distance from
Levitsky's
histrionic
portrait
of
Catherine II to Bakst's splendid occult symmetries for
Scheherazade and the Firebird.
The
parallel between the Russian portrait-painters
and
the European
tradition
is
not
a
fortuitous
one.
Artists from France, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Brit-
ain resided in Russia for various lengths of time during
the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and
the Academy of Arts
in
St. Petersburg was virtually
controlled by foreign masters, including, for example,
the versatile George Dawe, who managed to produce
over four hundred portraits of Russian generals for the
Winter Palace between 1819 and 1828. Throughout the
nineteenth century, too, Russian artists— consciously or
unconsciously—maintained a close aesthetic link with
the West.
It
is not
difficult to recognize points of re-
11

semblance between Aleksandr Ivanov and the Naza-
renes, between
Briullov and
Gericault,
just
as
it
is
possible to discover organic connections between Push-
kin and Lord Byron or Gogol and Dickens.
It
is one
thing to enumerate such stylistic convergences, another
to
elucidate
the
reasons
for them. However,
careful
examination
of
just
one
concurrent
development,
namely the formation and extension of the Russian and
American luminist tradition in the mid- and late nine-
teenth century, might delineate some of the common
motives
responsible
for
the
frequent
coincidence
of
style between East and West.
Among the most evocative paintings in this exhibi-
tion are the nineteenth-century landscapes of Kuindzhi,
Levitan, Savrasov, Shishkin, Soroka, and Vasiliev. The
viewer may well be reminded of the achievements of the
Hudson River School, although the Russians were too
elemental, perhaps
too
romantic,
to warrant
a
close
proximity
to
Bierstadt, Church, Heade, Kensett, and
Lane.
Still,
there
are
interesting
parallels:
both
the
Russians and the Americans were exceptionally sensi-
tive
to
the
effects of natural
light on
landscape,
all
shared a similar "stereoscopic" vision of reality, and all
seemed to revere the majesty and "transcendentalism
1 '
of nature. There were also more concrete reasons why
Russian and American artists of the 1860s- 70s devel-
oped
in
similar directions: both groups found them-
selves on the peripheries of the European Academy and,
to a considerable extent, at loggerheads with
it. Inevita-
bly, they endeavored to create an alternative tradition
which, both in Russia and in America, led immediatelv
to
the establishment of national
schools of painting.
Consequently, the topographies of the respective coun-
tries,
containing
the
broad
horizons
and panoramic
vistas so loved by the luminists, came to play a distinct
and national role in contradistinction to the Mediterra-
nean
Arcadia
repeated
endlessly
by
their
romantic
predecessors.
Moreover,
both
the
Russians
and
the
Americans were interested in photography and, in some
cases, they worked as retouchers; they kept abreast of
the rapid scientific progress being made in physics and
optics, and in greater or lesser degree derived part of
their inspiration from the traditions of naive painting
operative in both countries. Soroka's work, for example,
relies on
a charming fusion of the Russian primitive
tradition (as seen, for example, in tray painting and the
palekh, or enameled boxes) and the Western academic
discipline. It is a fusion of styles that amazes us all the
more by its resemblance to the an of George Bingham.
Still, in the luminist achievement, pride of place must
go to the Ukrainian Kuindzhi whose Birch Grove
is a
spectacular piece of pictorial engineering. Nineteenth-
century viewers w
Tere so affected By this painting that
some
"stood open-mouthed
before
it,
while
others
wept."-
This East-West coincidence of artistic ideas was also
very
evident
in
the
twentieth
century. The Russian
symbolist poets and painters were well versed in the
literature of the French decadents and the
art of the
nabis. The influence of French cubism on the nascent
avant-garde in Russia was, of course, appreciable. Ital-
ian futurism was
well known both
in image and
in
idea—and perhaps the poet Benedikt Livshits was not
far wrong when he asserted that "Rayonism, with which
Larionov tried to outstrip the Italians, fitted into Boc-
cioni's
vest pocket." 3 But
(as
Livshits
also
said) the
Russians did retain an appreciation of material, of the
expressive qualities of the artistic medium
itself, that
Western
artists lacked. When Vladimir Burliuk rolled
his canvases in the
soil of his garden, when Malevich
painted his clean planes of Suprematism, when Tatlin
and Rodchenko
carefully assembled
their
reliefs and
constructions from pure textures of wood and metal,
they were extending this "culture of materials" (to use a
catchword of the early Soviet years). Only in isolated
instances,
did
the Western
avant-garde
manifest
the
same serious and exclusive concern with the physiology
of art. To a considerable degree, the artists of the Rus-
sian avant-garde rediscovered material through
their
deep interest in the
arts and
crafts of ancient Russia.
Goncharova and her colleagues were quick to "shake
the dust from
[their] feet and leave the West,""
4 and to
transfer their allegiance to the systems of the Russian
icon, the peasant broadside (lubok), the painted sign-
board, and the like. Their popular derivation is apparent
both in their choice of theme (Goncharova's Washing
Linen), and in their treatment of it (inverted perspec-
tive, monoplanar imagery);
it
is apparent above
all
in
their vital response to the material of paint,
its plastic-
ity,
its luminosity,
its textaral compounds. This redis-
covery of paint, very
noticeable
after the drab
color
scales of the Russian realists, is one of the most striking
characteristics
of
the
Russian
avant-garde.
Petrov-
Yodkin's Bathing of the Red Horse is a superb example
12

of this new awareness of Russia's pre-Petrine
artistic
tradition: not only does
it depend on the same dense
body color of the old Russian
icon, "but also
(as Dr.
Sarabianov points out in his Introduction)
it contains a
deep mythological and philosophical value.
If color was the primary element
for Goncharova,
Kandinsky, Larionov, Lentulov, Malevich, and Petrov-
Vodkin, then line and linear expressivity was the domi-
nant concern of Soviet painters in the 1920s and early
1930s, whether in the documentary pictures of Brodsky
or in the works by the painters of OST—one of the
most original but least explored phenomena of twenti-
eth-century Russian art. Fortunately, OST
is well rep-
resented
in
this
exhibition by
its
founder-members:
Deineka, Goncharov, Pimenov, Shterenberg, and Via-
lov. Deineka and Pimenov,
in
particular, were
influ-
enced substantially by modern Central European
art:
Deineka's Defense of Petrograd, for example, derived its
iconography
from
Ferdinand
Hodler's
Auszug
der
Jenaer Studenten zum Freiheitskampf von 1813 (1908);
Pimenov's
skeletal
pictures of athletes and
industrial
workers owed much to Otto Dix, whose work he saw
both
in reproduction and
at
the two
exhibitions
of
German art in Moscow in 1924 and 1925. While sup-
porting a figurative style, the OST artists endeavored to
create a vigorous and resilient form that would express
the new era of Socialist construction. Although there
were
lugubrious
themes
(Pimenov's
war
scenes,
Goncharov's Death of Marat), and although elements
of surrealism were not uncommon
(especially
in the
work of Barto,
Luchishkin, and Tyshier, not repre-
sented in this exhibition), the OST artists aspired to-
ward a positive and assertive portrayal of reality. Unlike
the German expressionists, they distorted form not to
parody negative features, but to emphasize the impulse
and potential of the new Soviet technology. Unfortu-
nately, OST was
short-lived, and while traces of
its
influence showed in Drevin and still show in Tyshler, it
had ended
its innovative period by 1930.
Curiously enough, the dynamic, early period of So-
cialist realism (the 1930s)
is not treated extensively in
this exhibition, although the large canvas Higher, Ever
Higher! by Riangina epitomizes the grand, ambitious
principles of the Socialist realist program. Perhaps more
than any other movement in modern art, Socialist real-
ism is the victim of an intricate and misleading mythol-
ogy, and
it
is
difficult now
to
sift
artistic
fact from
pblitical fiction (and vice versa). Actually, the aesthetic
credo of Socialist realism,
ratified
in
1934, contained
some very significant and innovative ideas, especially in
its advocacy of the need to depict "reality in its revolu-
tionary development," to use "labor as a central hero,"
to apply "typicality" as a primary principle, and so on.
Whether or not we like the interpretations and exten-
sions of this program
is another matter, although, of
course, there were "good" and "bad"
Socialist
realist
paintings,
just as there were "good" and "bad" social
realist paintings
in America during the same
period.
Like their predecessors in OST, Riangina and her col-
leagues
strove
to
transmit
the
idea of the imminent
fulfillment of a Utopian dream through the lyrical dis-
tortion of reality. Socialist realism of the 1930s was a
visual
rhetoric, and
its
flights of fancy are rarely en-
countered
now.
Only
in
isolated
cases,
as
in
Pok-
hodaev's First Rendezvous.
"Soyuz" and "Apollo," do
we again perceive the romance and rhapsody of early
Socialist realism.
The condition of contemporary Soviet painting
is
self-evident and needs
little commentary. After a long
period of isolation, Soviet art has once again returned to
the international arena, although on a level vastly dif-
ferent than
that of the
1920s.
Despite
their
various
national
derivations, the new Soviet painters favor
a
lyrical and contemplative style that depends very little
on the original tenets of Socialist realism. They now
reside in some curious twilight zone midway between
Hans Makart and Norman Rockwell, and they exert a
subtle attraction to many people whether in Moscow,
Paris, New York, or Tokyo. Golden Harvest, Construc-
tion
Workers,
Under Peaceful Skies—this
is
the new
international style.

Russian
and Soviet Painting
DMITRII VLADIMIROVICH SARABIANOV
Vs
isitors to this exhibition will see about 150 works.
Of course, this
is not really enough to provide a true
representation of the development of Russian painting
from the Middle Ages to modern times. Nevertheless,
one can gain a general idea of the processes of Russian
painting,
its achievements, and
its distinctive national
image.
Needless to say,
it is very difficult to locate qualities
that are germane to all—or almost all—phenomena of
Russian art. At best, such qualities would prove to be
too abstract to be at all meaningful. There is, however,
one exception to this
rule. People often speak of the
anthropocentrism
of Russian
art and
literature
and,
most certainly, there is some truth in this point. This is
probably the only general characteristic that we could
locate in most important phenomena of Russian artistic
culture. Indeed, whether we turn our attention to an-
cient icon painting
in which God or
a
saint appears
before
us
in the
guise of man, imbued with
all our
human
virtues and
qualities, whether we
study
the
18th-century portraits that penetrate so deeply to the
spiritual and physical beauty of their model, whether we
examine the 19th-century paintings in which the artists
seek to resolve the social contradictions of their time, or
whether we concern ourselves with works from more
recent times in which the artists endeavor to praise man
the pragmatist— in all cases we encounter a deep inter-
est in the most essential spheres of human
life. In
all
cases, the ideals of the Russian artist are bound up with
an elevated moral conception of the human personality.
Russian culture attained this humane condition after
a long and tortuous path.
It was a
difficult path that
began at the dawn of the Russian state. Ancient Russia
(Rus)
took from Byzantium
the
Eastern
variant
of
Christianity and, therewith, the bases of medieval cul-
ture. Due to the Mongolian and Tartar invasion, ancient
Russia for a long time was denied progress.
Still, this
tragic fact of Russian history did, ultimately, have a
positive ending: Europe was saved from the barbarians.
And
then
ancient
Russia
gathered
her
strength,
straightened her back, and drove forth the
strangers
from her soil. Even so, until the very end of the 17th
century, Russian culture remained part of a medieval
system and did not witness the true Renaissance. Only
at the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th century
did Russian culture suddenly take a leap forward: it was
a cultural revolution that paralleled that of the Western
European Renaissance. The reforms that took effect at
that time reverberated immediately through the whole
of Russia and affected her culture, her economy, and the
life style of the most diverse social classes. Thereafter,
the destiny of Russian culture was a complicated and
intricate one. Russian culture assimilated the experience
of the West, attempted to catch up with the West, and
overcame many difficult obstacles. In some cases, im-
portant problems were left unresolved. Different tend-
encies of cultural development and diverse movements
of literature and
art seemed to run contrary
to each
other and destroyed any
logical,
sequential develop-
ment. Movement forward became spasmodic, at times
too hurried and always uneven.
Russian art was always accompanied by such difficul-
ties. And perhaps
it
is thanks
to them
that Russian
painting witnessed that very human interpretation of
the fundamental questions of life referred to above. On
the other hand, from the beginning of the 18th century
onward, Russia kept abreast of Western Europe. Rus-
sian painting went through more or less the same stages,
15

manifested
itself in the same styles and movements as
were
evident
in
the
important
Western
European
schools.
Still, in Russian art we should look not for a reflec-
tion of the West, but, above
all, for a reflection of the
national spirit. When compared to the French and Ger-
man schools, Russian painting seems,
at times, to be
more
restrained,
less
brilliant, but
it always contains
deep inner significance.
We can try to find the distinctive features of Russian
painting
in many spheres— in
its
iconography, form,
and meaning. But surely the most important element is
the very ethos of its art, one that encompasses
all the
mentioned spheres, one
that
is always inwardly con-
nected to the destiny of the nation, to its national char-
acteristics, and
to
the
idiosyncracies of the
national
genius.
This ethos was fully visible in ancient Russian paint-
ing. From
its very beginning, Russian icon painting
(despite the fact that it derived entirely from the princi-
ples of Byzantine painting) displayed its unique charac-
teristics. Moreover, it often happened that certain works
created by the Byzantine masters actually became com-
ponent
parts
of the
history of Russian
painting and
became important elements in the artistic life of ancient
Russia. This was the case, for example, with the Our
Lady of Vladimir (an icon of the late
1 1th or early 12th
century) and with
the works of the Byzantine
artist
Theophanes the Greek, who,
in Novgorod and Mos-
cow, found
a second home and
a wide scope for
his
artistic activities. Ancient Russia reprocessed this for-
eign
experience,
she
dictated her own conditions
to
those who came from afar bringing her their creative
strength, and, ultimately, she selected exactly what she
wanted.
The
visitor to
this exhibition will be able to view
works of the 14th and 15th centuries. These were pro-
duced
at
a time
of great tension and excitement
in
Russian life, at a time of great creative impulse.
It was
then that ancient Russia was gathering her strength to
shake off the Mongol and Tartar yoke,
it was then that
the Russians scored their
first great victory, one that
determined their subsequent successes in winning back
their land and driving out the foreigners. The ecstatic
tension
in the painting of Theophanes the Greek was
replaced by the radiant clarity and harmony of Andrei
Rublev.
But,
despite
their
antithesis
to one another,
these two great painters joined forces in resolving rather
similar problems. It was at that time that the specifically
Russian form of the altar screen was born—the icono-
stasis
with
its
large
deesis
tier. The
idea
contained
here—of the presence of the saints before the face of
Christ—was an allegory suggesting the unity of soul
and heart, will and aspiration of people then experienc-
ing the need for national unity.
Several of the icons on display carry the imprint of all
these tendencies. The Archangel Michael of the
late
14th century (one of the masterpieces of icon painting
from that period) provides us with an accurate impres-
sion of the art of the pre-Rublev period. Our Lady of
the Don, which appeared at the end of the 14th century,
is related to the Theophanes tradition in Russian paint-
ing and
is, apparently, the replica of a renowned icon
produced by the Theophanes circle. In comparison with
the austere Byzantine models, this icon expresses more
readily the simple feelings of man.
The large nine-icon deesis
tier with
its full-length
figures
also
relates precisely
to
this period, the
15th
century.
In ancient
Russia
at
this time
this kind of
composition was especially popular;
it was established
in the Moscow circle of Theophanes and Rublev and
then spread to other schools. Novgorod artists gave
it
their own interpretation.
Many of the icons shown here are imbued with the
idea of the spiritual perfection of the hero, of his inner
beauty, of qualities that were to constitute a model for
all. The sacred and the profane, the
celestial and the
mundane come close to each other here, they are condi-
tions
that
interpenetrate. The very harmony of
this
integration often lends the painting a particularly high
artistic quality:
it is at this juncture that Rublev's paint-
ing emerges as the ideal. Inasmuch as Rublev's painting
was
itself the
expression of an extremely important
trend in ancient Russian
art and, secondly, exerted a
profound
influence on
the whole
process
of ancient
Russian painting for many years to come, its reflections,
so to speak, illumine many icons of the 15th and 16th
centuries.
The selection of the icons here was made so that the
visitor
to
the
exhibition would be
able
to
acquaint
himself with the themes that were popular
in ancient
Russia and with the ways in which they were treated.
For example, we find the depiction of Boris and Gleb:
they were the first Russian saints, brothers who, for the
16

people of that time and for their descendants, were not
just two men, pure in heart, but also martyrs for the
cause of Russian unity.
Boris and Gleb are generally
depicted on horseback.
The horse, as a matter of fact, became
a "popular
hero"
in
the
painting
of ancient
Russia. The
horse
appeared as a friend and ally of man, as his helpmate in
battle (St. George and the Dragon), as a domestic animal
indispensable to man and blessed with his own patron
saints (Florus and Laurus). All these images carry the
mythological conceptions of man peculiar
to
ancient
Russia. Not by chance did Petrov-Vodkin, at the begin-
ning of the 20th century, turn his attention to the horse,
the beloved hero of the ancient myth, imbued with the
noble
qualities
of splendor,
majesty, and
beauty.
In
doing
this, Petrov-Vodkin was
striving to revive the
mythological process of thought.
This mythological
sentiment
also permeated
other
icons such as the fabulous The Prophet Elijah and the
Fiery Chariot and the "historical" Battle Between
the
Men ofNovgorod and the Men of Suzdal. In the Battle,
art historians often see the beginning of the historical
genre, but this view can be justified only in part. This
was a time when Novgorod was trying to preserve
its
independence of Moscow, a city that had already as-
sumed
the
glory
of Vladimir
and
Suzdal.
For
the
Novogorod
painter who
created
this
icon
then,
the
earlier victory of Novogorod over Suzdal was a kind of
historical analogy. But in deference to the laws of me-
dieval
art he could not
depict
a
historical
scene
as
such—so he depicted a miracle because, according to
tradition,
the
principal
part
in
the
battle had been
played by an icon that had put the enemy troops
to
flight. The
artist arranged his narrative in three hori-
zontal bands, imbuing it with distinctive visual mythol-
ogems—the brave horsemen attacking the enemy, the
forest
of lances
raised high above
the
warriors,
the
silhouette of the "holy city" defending itself against its
enemies. Each of these images is archetypal, and analo-
gies can be found in the ancient tales, the byliny (tradi-
tional heroic poems), and the legends.
In the
17th century icon painting began to lose
its
former qualities of generalization,
ideality, and com-
pleteness. Gradually, the old characteristics disappeared
as new ones took
their
place. Art began
to turn
to
tangible
reality.
It became more loquacious.
Painters
began to admire detail, they often ceased their search
fox holiness and beauty and came to prefer
a purely
aesthetic principle. Not only new iconographic systems,
but also new branches and genres of art appeared. One
of these was the parsuna, a primitive form of the por-
trait. The parsuna preserved
certain elements of the
iconic convention
(despite
a more
naturalistic, more
concrete depiction of man) and also, in many cases, the
technique of icon painting (egg tempera on board). One
example of this kind of parsuna is the portrait of Prince
Skopin-Shuisky. The parsuna was clearly symptomatic
of a time of transition:
it seemed
to
crystallize
that
moment when Russian painting was awaiting decisive
changes and the discovery of a completely new path of
development.
But before we pass on to a discussion of this new
path,
let us say a few words about the carved panel
representing
Saint
Ermolai.
This
piece
represents
a
whole area of ancient Russian art: wood sculpture. iMost
of the works in this idiom date from the 16th and 17th
centuries.
To a certain extent the very existence of these splen-
did works by masters of ancient Russia disproves the
traditional notion that before the 18th century there was
no sculpture in Russia. True, in centuries prior to that
we do not encounter such a "boom" in sculpture as we
do in architecture and painting. But this gap was filled,
so to say, by remarkable artifacts containing concepts
peculiar to the common people and relying on the very
technique of woodcarving. These artifacts represented a
Russian tradition of long standing.
It was a tradition
belonging
to
a country covered
in
endless
forests,
a
country that regarded wood as its chief building mate-
rial.
The transition to a new system at the end of the
1 7th
century was not unexpected. During the 15th and 16th
centuries, within the general framework of medieval
thought,
certain
aspects Russian painting had
shared
a common basis with the ideals of the Renaissance. In
the
17th
century some
analogies with
the European
baroque could be found. But at the end of the
1 7th and
beginning of the 18th century this parallel movement
with the Western European
schools
ceased, and
the
Russian school became
part of the general European
development. The
Russian
school now outgrew
the
obsolete dogmas of medieval thought and made use of
the abundant experience that
Italy, France, Germany,
Holland, and other countries had already had. Aided by
17

them, Russian art joined the main stylistic directions of
the 18th century, the baroque and the classic.
One of the most interesting products of the transi-
tional period is the Portrait of Yakov furgenev, painted
anonymously at the very end of the 17th century. This
portrait expresses the individual characteristics of the
sitter with particular acuity, although the general struc-
ture in the painting relies on the iconic convention: the
local
color of the garments and the monoplanar and
graphic qualities of the imagery. When one compares
the portraits of the second half of the 18th century with
the Yakov Turgenev and other pieces from the Petrine
era, one
is amazed
at the dynamic pace with which
Russian
painting
was
then
advancing.
Three
artists
denote
the
apogee
of
this
advancement—Rokotov,
Levitsky, and Borovikovsky.
Of the three, Rokotov seems the most inspired. The
emotional inflections of his models are delicate, almost
elusive, and they seem
to
reflect that process of self-
awareness
that Russians
experienced throughout
the
18th century; it was a process that terminated later, with
the Pushkin era, when Russian romanticism was nearing
its end. Rokotov lifts the veil from our darkest secret,
the recesses of the
soul. But
a mystery remains con-
cealed behind some strange invisible screen,
it lives on
in the eyes of Rokotov's
sitters. Rokotov
reveals the
beauty of man through his own pictorial equivalent of
this
spirituality: he constructs his gentle and precious
color
scale on
a complex of tones
that
"slide" and
interfuse.
A rather different quality
is identifiable with Levit-
sky. He embodied that Renaissance pathos
for com-
prehending man and his world that was so characteristic
of the
entire
18th
century
in
Russia.
Levitsky
was
remarkably accurate in depicting what he saw. This was
true both of his human characters and of the concrete
world before him. He seemed
to touch the
silks and
satins
with
his
hands,
his
artistic
fingers seemed
to
brush against the delicate surface of skin.
In their art Rokotov and Levitsky seem to represent
two sides of the 18th century. They express an interest
in the beauty both of the spiritual and of the physical,
two conditions, of course, that intertwine and commu-
nicate
in the very craft of art. But both Rokotov and
Levitsky have their own specific centers of gravity.
Borovikovsky was a product of the turn of the 18th
and
19th
centuries. He adhered
to
specific
types of
portraiture, but always expressed a softness of emotion
not only in his treatment of character but also in his
subtle perception of colors and
skillful harmonies of
them. Subsequent generations of artists benefited from
Borovikovsky's fruitful approach to painting.
Eighteenth-century painting in Russia included not
onlv the portrait, but other genres—landscape, histori-
cal painting (which was considered the most important
genre), and domestic genre. There were definite accom-
plishments in all these disciplines. Nonetheless, in com-
parison to the other genres, the
portrait achieved an
extraordinarily high point of quality. This was very
logical. When art was confronted with the possibility
7 of
fathoming the concrete world, man proved to be at the
center of this world. This tradition was maintained in
the romantic painting of the first twenty or thirty years
of the 19th century. There
is no example of the early
romantic portraitist Kiprensky in this exhibition, but
this absence is compensated for by the two portraits by
Briullov: one of these—the portrait of Strugovshchi-
kov—is among the greatest attainments of late romantic
painting in Russia. Strugovshchikov's complex person-
ality, full of contradictory thoughts and experiences, is
disclosed with such persuasiveness that we see before us
the true image of a Russian intellectual of the 1830s-
1840s.
Perhaps the most important phenomenon of Russian
19th-century
painting
was
the
work
of
Alexandr
Ivanov. His
art was permeated with an intense pro-
phetical mood and profound
philosophical
ideas.
In
Ivanov was distilled the whole range of problems con-
fronting the
19th century. On the one hand, Ivanov
drew certain inferences from the artistic process of the
first
half of the
century; on
the
other, through the
various facets of his own artistic legacy, he pointed to
different phases in the subsequent development of Rus-
sian art. On the crest of a wave, Ivanov seemed to look
both forward and
backward,
belonging
both
to
the
future and to the past.
Visitors to the exhibition will see only a few works of
Ivanov, and they will be unable to form a comprehen-
sive idea of his art. But they will be able to perceive and
to
feel
one
important
characteristic
of
the
artist.
Whether in a large painting, a small landscape, a sketch
or
a
study, whether
in
a
watercolor
or
a
drawing,
Ivanov— always and in
all places—was a man of wis-
dom, heroic but serene. The great he could recreate in
18

the small, the image of the whole world he could depict
in a fragment of nature.
Briullov and Ivanov were of academic background,
although both of them overcame the academic routine
and "exploded"
it from
within.
Meanwhile,
various
trends had begun to develop in Russia during the first
twenty or thirty years of the 19th century. One such
trend derived from Tropinin and Venetsianov and his
pupils. Certain points of contact with romanticism can
be observed in Tropinin's work, while Venetsianov has
something in common with the German humanists of
the
1830s. Venetsianov reveals a beauty in the simple
world of the Russian
countryside,
in the
life of the
peasants, and
in Russian
nature. Without embellish-
ment, he imbues the simplest elements of the world
with their own independent value.
Soroka, Venetsianov's
pupil, assumed
his mentor's
poetic vision of nature. His landscapes and unpreten-
tious genre scenes depict lads fishing or interiors inhab-
ited by groups of individuals conversing or contemplat-
ing. They have a naive charm.
The
Venetsianov
interpretation
of genre
painting
held sway in Russian painting right up until the mid-
19th century. But as early as the 1840s, critical realism
began to affirm itself in its early, or perhaps one might
say, poetic stage. The only consistent supporter of this
trend was Fedotov. He began his artistic career with a
passive,
uneventful
observation,
and,
in
his
subject
matter, avoided the element of conflict and vivid ex-
pression. But he soon switched to the satirical narrative
and to the methods of caricature. Then he changed his
orientation again: he
left caricature behind and came
back
to
his
essentially
lyrical
interpretation. But he
combined this with a criticism of the laws of life itself
and with a tragic sentiment.
Fedotov
is
rightly considered
a forerunner of the
realists of the
late nineteenth century
7
. But he
differs
from them by virtue of the poetic sense of his
art.
In
the
1860s
critical
realism assumed
the
role of
denunciator. Artists exposed the powers that be, they
sympathized with the poor and the weak, they shared
the
suffering
of
the
"humiliated and
the
insulted."
Perov carried out his program of denunciation with a
series of paintings directed against the clergy, the most
daring of which was
his Easter Procession.
First and
foremost, the realist artists of the 1860s expressed their
ideals in the domestic genre. The portrait, the historical
painting, and the landscape took a secondary position:
their turn would come.
It came in the 1870s and 1880s, the highpoint of the
so-called Wanderers, artists who created their own as-
sociation and embarked upon an extensive program of
education and enlightenment through
the length and
breadth of Russia. With the Wanderers came the final
stage in the development of critical realism (one could
call
it the objective stage). The genres stood almost on
an
equal
footing:
the domestic
genre,
the
historical
genre, the portrait, the landscape
all found a place in
the general system of Russian painting of the 1870s and
1880s.
Realist
art, by
its very
idea, takes
facts from
surrounding life and resolves social problems explicidy,
not
implicitly.
So
it found
its
fullest
expression
in
paintings dealing with actuality and in the genre tradi-
tionally called "domestic." With realism, however, this
genre ceased to simply moralize on domestic issues, but
earned the right to be called a social genre.
Repin became the principal supporter of this genre.
He faced his contemporary reality fairly and squarely,
he derived his subject matter and imagery from
it and
addressed
himself to
the main problems of Russian
social life. He was interested in human relationships as
they manifested themselves in moments of antagonism
and conflict; he was drawn to mass scenes. His aim was
to depict the world in
all
its complexity and contra-
dictoriness. In characterizing his people, in creating his
portraits, Repin endeavored to penetrate
to the most
infinitesimal details, to motions of the soul hardly no-
ticeable at first glance. Repin attempted to embody his
ideas in an authentic style of painting entirely subordi-
nate to his observation of life and constructed according
to his consistent and intense study of objective reality.
Surikov's art marked another highpoint in the devel-
opment of realism during the late 19th century. Surikov
was a historical painter par excellence. With his inner
eye he could imagine scenes from the past as
if they
were happening now. Still, Surikov not only obeyed his
imagination, but also pondered long over a composition
or an image before constructing and organizing
it. He
was
interested
in
the
decisive moments
of
Russia's
history. The conflicts during the Petrine reforms, the
schism
in
the Church,
the
struggle
of the common
people for their rights and their interests— such were
the themes of his paintings. Because of this, Surikov
occupied a very distinctive position in European paint-
19

ing of the late 19th century since the European histori-
cal genre was at that time controlled by the conventions
of the Salon.
Each genre that was used at all extensively in realism
of the
late
19th century absorbed the peculiarities of
this movement. Vereshchagin reformed battle painting
by subordinating all artistic means at his disposal to his
fight against war and by revealing
all the horrors that
war
brings
with
it.
Kramskoi,
Perov,
Repin,
Yaro-
shenko, and Ge made
radical changes
in portraiture,
changing
it into a programmatic genre, into a specific
platform
for advocating
the contemporary hero—the
man of the people or the thinker, the fighter for justice,
the pragmatist, the creator. As a genre, the portrait best
satisfied the
artist's new
interest
in the positive hero
whose
aspirations had already replaced the mere de-
nunciations and exposes of the 1860s.
The landscape also responded to these new demands,
although perhaps not quite so directly: pictures of na-
ture aroused positive feelings,
a love for one's native
country. The Wanderers— Savrasov, Shishkin, Vasiliev,
Kuindzhi, and many
others— ratified
a new kind of
landscape painting, one that required a narrative
ele-
ment. Nature and human life were presented as a unity.
Mother Russia—in everyday life, in her most mundane
manifestations—became the subject of landscape paint-
ing. The most diverse
artists developed
their
talents
within this general framework.
Savrasov was
a
lyrical
painter. He
cultivated
the
"landscape of mood," and favored the kind of painting
that could evoke an idea by feeling. In many cases, these
were pictures of specific scenes of nature, but they were
linked by an invisible strand to the whole of Russia.
In
contrast
to
Savrasov,
Shishkin
loved
the
epic
motif. He liked to
try to transmit what he saw with
extreme
accuracy,
with
every
fragment
and
detail
painted
in. The graphic element
is the dominant force
in his paintings.
Vasiliev was closer to Savrasov. There were moments
when he was carried away by the romantic impulse, but
his main theme was
the
essential movement
of na-
ture—changes in the weather, rain, and storms.
Thanks to his support of romanticism, his attraction
to
light
effects,
and
to
specific
natural
conditions,
Kuindzhi produced his own distinctive version of the
landscape.
In
this
respect, Kuindzhi occupied an un-
usual position inasmuch as the romantic tradition had,
essentially, been disrupted with the hegemony of criti-
cal realism.
Levitan's work marked the conclusion of the devel-
opment of the realist landscape of the Wanderers. As a
pupil of Savrasov, he took many elements both from his
mentor and from many other predecessors. He synthe-
sized
the
results and
created
a new kind of
lyrical,
philosophical landscape. Levitan did much to assimilate
the methods
of plein
air painting, and many
of his
works can be associated with the early phase of Russian
impressionism. However, some of his works—for ex-
ample, Above Eternal Peace— anticipated post-impres-
sionist movements, especially the style moderne.
Thanks to Levitan, Russian painting moved toward
an important turning point in
its evolution, although
Levitan himself died before he could resolve the crisis.
The
artists who brought Russian painting to the final
stage of its pre-Revolutionary development were Serov,
Korovin, and Vrubel. Their independent careers began
as early as the 1880s and encompassed the beginning of
the 20th century. This was a time of an intense resur-
gence
of Russian
painting. The most
diverse trends
were united by a general artistic impulse, by the artists'
creative
activity-, and by
intense group involvement.
At the end of the
19th century most young
artists
began by attempting to reject the literary themes of the
Wanderers and to find instead a spontaneous vision of
nature. The result was impressionism. Korovin was its
principal supporter and he remained loyal to this artistic
credo until the end of his days. He cultivated the form
of the etude and integrated a system of impressionist
painting with its strokes of pure color, its intricate color
mixes, and its orientation toward the decorative. Subse-
quentiy, this decorativism became virtually the national
characteristic of Russian impressionism.
V. Serov, an outstanding
artist of the late 19th and
early
20th
century,
related
his
creative
experiments
both to the problems of impressionism and to the style
moderne, then
in
its
first stage of development.
Still,
Serov had an original
artistic individuality, an excep-
tional
talent, and
this enabled him
to assume
a
very-
special position in the history- of national and interna-
tional
art.
Serov's
artistic evolution was of particular
significance to the whole of Russian painting. His early
works were permeated with a spontaneous feeling for
nature, they relied on a wide diapason of color and on
intricate color transitions; his late works depended on
20

strict
calculation and were
constructed
according
to
linear silhouette, all-encompassing linear rhythm, and
well-defined strokes of color. In his late portraits Serov
applied
certain formulas: he often used them for the
heroic or beautiful
effect, but sometimes he also used
them for the ironic or the grotesque. The artist used the
devices of metaphor and comparison. He used thick
layers of color, "wrote
testimonials,"
created
a new
concrete
reality while
still relying on the material of
everyday
life. In his thematic works, Serov preferred
mythological subjects and painted them in the form of
panneaux.
Vrubel's work, regardless of subject, is permeated by
the sense of myth. More often than not, Vrubel chose
mythological heroes for his paintings, giving preference
above
all
to
the Demon and the Prophet. He could
imbue nature with a mysterious force and man with a
restlessness of spirit. Among his contemporaries Vrubel
was the most consistent in his search for, and attainment
of,
a new
system;
he
eschewed
impressionism
and
turned directly to the painterly form of the style mod-
erne with
its
color
for
color's
sake,
its pronounced
decorative structure, and
its stylized combinations of
color. If Serov evolved from the 19th to the 20th cen-
tury, Vrubel leapt into a new era; his development was a
more decisive one,
it was irreversible.
Korovin, Serov, and Vrubel were associated with the
group known
as
the World
of Art, which played
a
formative role in Russian artistic life at the turn of the
century. The art of the World of Art members is char-
acterized by an interest in the theatricality of life, retro-
spectivism, a keen sense of style, and a refined artistic
skill. Stage and book design, the monumental and the
applied arts as a whole occupied an important place in
the work of the World of Art artists—something that
testified to their attraction toward synthetic art forms
and to Gesamtkunstwerk.
Artists of other groups that
began to coalesce in the mid- 1900s carried on the en-
deavors that the World of Art artists had
first under-
taken.
The
first of these was the Blue Rose,
a group of
artists
who
united
under
the
banner
of
Borisov-
Musatov (who had died shortly before). The Blue Rose
included
artists such
as Kuznetsov,
Sarian, and Kry-
mov, and Petrov-Vodkin was also close to them. They
contributed to the one and only Blue Rose exhibition of
1907 and then to the exhibitions organized by the jour-
nal called the Golden Fleece. Larionov and Goncharova
were also represented at the Golden Fleece exhibitions.
Historians of Russian
art regard Musatov and
his
disciples as second-generation symbolists. Vrubel was
the first symbolist in Russian painting, and his younger
colleague, Musatov, presented a softer, more contem-
plative
version
of symbolism.
As
a
rule,
Musatov
painted
fairly
large compositions
containing two
or
more
figures. Amidst
these
his heroines appeared
in
deep
reflection or moved
in some
silent
procession,
acting and yet inactive. Musatov's paintings are melodic
and
musical, and
his
melodies move by
crescendo,
diminuendo, and pause. Indeed, Musatov himself wrote
of
his
intention
to
bring
painting and music
closer
together.
Kuznetsov
assimilated
this
restrained
style
from
Musatov.
It was
a
style
that had
left impressionism
behind and had alighted upon a kind of reserved dec-
orativism. Kuznetsov's best works treat of the steppes
beyond the Volga and of Central Asia, for, like Gau-
guin, he found in distant places a salvation from urban
civilization. In these paintings Kuznetsov adhered to a
consistent iconographical scheme and repeated typical
scenes from the life of the inhabitants of the steppes. In
their simple manifestations of ordinary life Kuznetsov
found a kind of perfection and an inner conformity.
Petrov-Vodkin
took
a
different
property
from
Borisov-Musatov—the tendency to transform concrete
reality which, with Petrov-Vodkin, developed into an
artistic code. The artist's mythological perception dic-
tated the evolution of his symbolist world view. He
himself created myths, he created heroes who needed no
documentary verification, who were far from the mun-
dane
sentiments
of everyday
life. For
example,
the
symbol that Petrov-Vodkin uses in his Bathing of the
Red Horse cannot be reduced
to any one
particular
concept:
it has many meanings. The color, the perspec-
tive, the system of plastic values in this picture acquire a
symbolic meaning and, at the same time, transmit the
idea of a radical restructuring of the traditional view of
the natural world. The artist uses only local color and
his perspective
is a "spherical" one.
In 1910 the symbolists were replaced by the artists of
the Knave of Diamonds group, artists who rejected all
their predecessors—the Wanderers, the academic paint-
ers, the World of Art artists, and the Blue Rose sym-
bolists. In most cases, the artists of the Russian avant-
21

garde were associated with the Knave of Diamonds,
although the most progressive of them did not stay in
the society for very long. But some artists were loyal to
the Knave of Diamonds until
its termination in 1918
and, through
their
art, determined
its conformity of
style. And this style can be defined as the integration of
the principles of Cezannism and early cubism with the
national
traditions of icon painting and
the popular,
primitive arts and crafts. Among the artists who sup-
ported this direction were Lentulov and Falk, both of
whom are represented
in
this exhibition. Each
inter-
preted this general Knave of Diamonds program in his
own way. Falk was attracted to the primitive arts only
for a short time and then created his system of "lyrical
cubism": in this he used cubist devices for the sake of
lyrical or psychological expressivity and, thereby, pen-
etrated to the plastic essence of painting. In his large
panneaux, paintings dedicated to the themes of ancient
Russian architecture, Lentulov applied the traditions of
icon
and
fresco
painting;
simultaneously,
Lentulov
demonstrated that he was aware of the accomplishments
of Delaunay and other French artists.
Among the organizers of the Knave of Diamonds
were Larionov and Goncharova. However, they shortly
left the society and began to organize their own exhibi-
tions,
attracting
a number
of young
artists
to
their
cause. These exhibitions propagated the ideas of neo-
primitivism, Rayonism, and cubo-futurism. Larionov
was captivated by Russian provincial life, he painted his
Barber pictures, his provincial dandies and their ladies,
and then went on to paint his Soldier series. Larionov
delighted in the lubok (a folk cartoon reminiscent of the
old English broadside) and the handmade toy; he paro-
died them, but—and this is very important—he did not
stylize them; on the contrary, he endeavored to view life
through the eyes of a real, popular, primitive artist. In
this way Larionov combined
the primitive approach
with an exquisite sense of painting and an accomplished
technique.
Goncharova
left her own
distinctive mark on neo-
primitivism. This was evident from her perception of cer-
tain elements of the Russian icon, from her heightened
expressivity and ecstatic rendition of imagery. Together
with Larionov, Goncharova, so
to
speak, resurrected
the domestic genre, and,
in so doing, made extensive
use of pictorial narrative, scenes from peasant life, and
other national themes traditional for Russian painting.
Neo-primitivism was, to some extent,
a branch of
expressionism, of which Kandinsky provided one ver-
sion. His art signified the organic link between Russian
and German artistic culture. His works in the exhibition
were painted
just when the
artist was developing
his
synthetic interpretations of nature-to an extreme point:
beyond this lay abstract expressionism.
The works
of Malevich and
Tatlin,
and
also
of
Rozanova and Popova
(influenced by
the
first
two),
represent the
final
stage
in the development of pre-
Revolutionary painting. Malevich pursued his own ar-
tistic path, experiencing the influence of impressionism,
then the style moderne, cubism, cubo-futurism and, ulti-
mately,
suprematism,
which
he
formulated
himself.
Malevich
passed
through
these
stages
extremely
quickly. His suprematist phase was related to his estab-
lishment of new ideas—of how to overcome terrestrial
gravity, weightlessness, the plastic condition
in outer
space.
Malevich,
as
it
were, was
presenting
certain
proto-elements of painting out of which painting was to
be created anew.
Even before he had begun his counterreliefs, Tatiin
demonstrated an unusual constructive sense in his han-
dling of form. Subsequently, he rejected depiction on
the canvas and began
to
create
objects
in which he
found the correlation of materials, surface coloration,
the logic and expediency of form to be of particular
interest. This was the point of departure of construc-
tivism,
destined
to follow
a long path
in
the whole
evolution of European art.
During the years prior to the Revolution, Russian
painting contained many contradictions.
Its develop-
ment was a complex one: progressive tendencies alter-
nated with reactionary ones. The October Revolution
resolved many of these contradictions, it confronted art
with new demands and directed it along a new path. At
the same time, many of the progressive traditions were,
indeed, assimilated and continued.
From the very start Soviet art established a close link
with the life of the people, of the new Socialist Repub-
lic. Art endeavored to come to grips with the practical
realities of life. The task was not easy: the vast masses
had to be introduced to cultural values; art had to be
invested with educational and pedagogical functions; art
had to be enlisted so as to create a new environment. So,
in the early years, those art forms that could best fulfill
these demands were favored and promoted—the politi-
22

cal poster, monumental sculpture, agit-design and dec-
oration of the cities. Many painters, graphic artists, and
sculptors
were
only
superficially
involved
in
these
media, but many others did try to implement them
and with
great enthusiasm.
After
this,
as
Soviet
art
evolved, it returned increasingly to traditional forms, so
that by the 1920s easel painting was already occupying
an auspicious position.
This
exhibition
includes many
pre-Revolutionary
artists who,
in Soviet times, discovered new themes,
new images, and,
in many
cases, rephrased
their old
vocabulary. Kustodiev would seem to be one of these.
To his depiction of the old world of provincial Russia
with its merchants and merchants' wives, with its festive
carnivals and bazaars (the
artist painted these themes
before the Revolution when he was
a member of the
World of Art), Kustodiev added the symbolic image of
the Bolshevik, an image born of the new era.
Konchalovsky, one of the organizers of the Knave of
Diamonds, continued to experiment as a cubist in his
portrait of the violinist Romashkov. Yuon had always
gravitated towards impressionism, although with a dec-
orative tendency. But after the Revolution he continued
to develop
this
pictorial conception and,
at times, to
combine
it with elements of the new reality.
Filonov, who had begun his innovative career in the
1910s,
continued
to
advance
during
the
1920s
and
1930s and to perfect his analytical method, which he
had
already
proclaimed
before
the
Revolution. He
painted pictures full of symbolic meaning and often of
tragic intensity.
The 1920s witnessed the formation of several move-
ments which competed—and sometimes polemicized
with each other. Each declared
its own program. The
Association
of
Artists
of
Revolutionary
Russia
(AKhRR) declared itself to be the heir to the traditions
of the Wanderers even though
it advocated "heroic"
realism. The AKhRR artists documented the character-
istics of the new
life, recorded its new manifestations,
although their actual method of painting remained tra-
ditional. Visitors to the exhibition will see a number of
works by these artists, for example, Brodsky's portrait
of Lenin in the Smolnyi, Grekov's Gun Carriage and
Riangina's genre scene Higher, Ever Higher!
Artists representing another direction, those of the
Society of Easel
Artists (OST), pursued other
aims.
They
wished
to
resolve contemporary themes by
a
contemporary form of easel painting. To this end, they
drew
on
the
achievements
of
Russian
and
Western
European
art of the early 20th century, especially ex-
pressionism. Shterenberg, whose painting The Agitator
is shown here, was the permanent leader of OST.
Still,
the most popular artist of this group was Deineka, who
achieved fame during the 1920s thanks to many paint-
ings, but especially to his Defense of Petrograd. Deineka
invested his picture with a dynamic rhythm and created
an image of fearlessness and courage.
Visitors will also find two more important and typical
works by the OST group—Pimenov's Give
to Heavy
Industry
and
Goncharov's
Death
of Marat.
These
paintings are characterized by an intense expressiveness
resulting sometimes
in anatomical
distortion, by
the
emphatic gestures of the figures, and by the dynamic
style identifiable with OST.
Among the other artists who developed their talents
during the 1920s and 1930s, mention should be made of
Drevin. His works are close to those of the OST artists,
although they
are distinguished by
a more painterly
style. His pictures are dominated by the spontaneous
movement of paint, and the depicted objects seem to
emerge from this elementalness as
if by magic.
Soviet painting of the
1930s owed
a
great deal
to
those
artists who had matured before the Revolution
and who were now given the opportunity' of applying
their realist style to contemporary needs. In this con-
text, Nesterov should be considered
a
central
figure.
After many years of silence, he suddenly produced a
series of very
interesting
portraits
that recreated the
image of man the creator. His portrait of the sculptress
Mukhina relies on a firm sense of structure,
is distin-
guished by its severe plasticity, and expresses through a
convincing use of composition and color the energy and
creative impulse of the subject.
During the 1930s and 1940s Grabar and
S. Geras-
imov continued to develop their art while relying on the
impressionist
tradition. Both
artists enjoyed painting
subjects
of the
historical and genre
type.
But
their
favorite kind of painting was,
as
it had always been,
their
native
landscape,
which
they
interpreted
with
delicate, lyrical feeling.
Plastov,
the peasant
painter, was
also
close
to the
impressionist tradition. He first achieved renown in the
1930s and, up until the 1970s, continued to occupy a
central position in artistic life. He lived his entire life in
23

his native village and derived his themes, his motifs, and
images
from
this
environment.
Their
veracity
and
credibility
constitute
the most
endearing
quality
of
Plastov's work.
The
distinguishing
feature
of Soviet
painting
has
been
its
multinationality, something
that was already
apparent in the early years. Before the Revolution some
of the republics had not known professional painting,
but during the 1920s and 1930s their own artists came
to the fore, contributing
to the establishment of new
national schools of art. Many of the republics, for ex-
ample Armenia and Georgia, could boast artistic tradi-
tions of long standing and mature development. Each
time these
traditions changed
in accordance with the
new demands of the new era, they did so in a distinctive
and
original
manner.
But
the
objective
in
all
cases
remained the same: art became an important factor of
life; it established a profound, essential connection with
life and formulated a method whereby art could reveal
the important moments of contemporary reality.
All the national schools developed quite forcefully
and, eventually, acquired common meaning and value.
In
this
respect,
the
1960s and
1970s
are
especially
significant. During these years each national school has
made
its contribution to the panorama of Soviet paint-
ing. The artists of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have
played a major role in certain areas of Soviet painting.
The painters of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan have
introduced the decorative principle, a romantic elation,
and an austerity into Soviet
art. Ukrainian and Mol-
davian
artists have produced
interesting
results from
their examination of the sources of popular, primitive
art. The
artists of White Russia have been much
in-
volved in the theme of the Second World War with its
tragic and heroic episodes. Each of the Central Asian
republics has given us outstanding painters. They have
always derived their inspiration from their local envi-
ronment, the specific features of their surrounding na-
ture,
the
national
character of their
people, and the
traditional forms of their applied arts.
To
a certain extent this process coincided with the
development of a young generation of painters who
made their mark in the late 1950s, who achieved recog-
nition, and who today determine the general character
of Soviet painting. This generation of painters estab-
lished
itself as the proponent of the so-called "severe
style." Later on this style was mollified and
its adher-
ents began to treat of lyrical themes. Zarin, Ossovsky,
Salakhov, and Muradian (all included in the exhibition)
represent this trend, although, of course,
it
is not lim-
ited to their work alone and one could cite other names
as additional examples. All these artists aspire to make
maximum use of the medium of painting, its plasticity,
color, composition, and linear structure, and they aspire
toward
this
each
in
his own way. They founded
a
movement that proved to be important for Soviet art,
one that now receives the support of our younger gen-
eration of painters. Only a few of the latter are included
in this exhibition, since their art has yet to formulate its
method and
its
style. But
it
is clear that their art has
potential.
Obviously, it is wrong to apply just the one criterion
of the Russian national tradition to the whole of Soviet
painting.
But
this
tradition
is
directly
linked
to
the
painting of Soviet Russia and indirectiy to that of the
other republics. It is important that each national school
develop its own traditions, for these traditions interact,
allowing artists to share their experiences. Surely,
it is
this that guarantees the future progress of art.

UNKNOWN ARTIST.
Portrait of Yakov Fedoro-
vich Turgenev (16??-95). Not later than 1695
Oil on canvas, 105 x 97.5.
Inscription at top: Yakov Turgenev.
Accession:
1929.
Russian Museum. Inventory No. Zh-4902.
Turgenev was a member of Peter the Great's so-called
"Very All-Drunken and Wild Assembly of the All-
Joking Prince, Daddy of Them All. " Peter formed this
association from members of his entourage.
It played an
important part in the buffooneries and ceremonies that
accompanied the court entertainments.
Turgenev com-
manded a company in
the so-called Kozhukhov Cam-
paign—grandiose military maneuvers that Peter orga-
nized on the outskirts of Moscow in 1694.
Turgenev
celebrated his ma>riage in January 1695. He died shortly
thereafter.
This portrait
is part of the so-called Preo-
brazhenskii Cycle (named so from the Preobrazhensku
Palace where the portraits were hanging in the 18th cen-
tury). The artist, presumably Russian, was probably one
of the masters working in the Armory in Moscow.
The
work shows many characteristics of the traditions of
ancient Russian painting. Some scholars ascribe the work
to Ivan Adolsky-Bolshoi (date of birth unknown, died
1750 or later).
