GO! AII In One Key Features
Technology on the Job
Ethics
Informs students about how the technologies they are studying in the chap­
ter relate to jobs—and specifically to the job that is the focus of the chapter. 
Students see how important it is to have specific computer skills to succeed 
in a variety of jobs.
TECHNOLOGY 
ON THE JOB
As a Marketing Assistant in the field of en­
tertainment, you need both marketing skills 
and technology skills. Because companies 
are striving to understand their customers 
and respond to customer needs quickly, 
you also need Internet skills and social net­
working skills. Review the list of technol­
ogy skills recently posted for a position of 
Marketing Assistant. Are you surprised at 
the level of technology required? Do you 
already possess any of these skills? Indi­
viduals in this type of position often travel, 
so knowledge of portable devices, backup 
procedures, and network attached storage 
(NAS) or Internet storage is critical in order 
to maintain communication with team mem­
bers and guarantee the availability of data.
Try to gain as much experience in these
areas as possible.
Technology skills recently posted for a
Marketing Assistant position include:
• Developing media packs and organiz­
ing conferences and trade shows.
• Serving as liaison between advertis­
ing agencies and the company, print 
suppliers, freelance talent, and various 
marketing services.
• Preparing press releases, company news­
letters, and event announcements.
• Updating company headlines and news 
in the corporate Web site.
• Assisting in promotional strategies.
Fast Forward
Addresses emerging technologies related to the chapter content. Current 
research findings and companies that are working on these technologies 
are spotlighted so students can see the practical applications of these new 
technologies.

FCC's B r o a d b a n d  A c c e s s T a r g e t
Networking and using the Internet for 
communication, education, and commerce 
will continue to increase. In a bid to en­
sure broadband access to all people in the 
United States within a decade, the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) has 
set a 4 Mbps download target for univer­
sal broadband. This project will cost S23.5 
billion. Although nearly 200 million Ameri­
cans had broadband access in 2009, there 
were still approximately 100 million that 
did not. The FCC plan is to plug the gaps 
in the current infrastructure and establish 
DSL, 4G wireless, or satellite coverage—
depending on the location— in underser­
viced areas.
Download speed of 4 Mbps is not fast by 
current standards, but for those with no ac­
cess or poor access, this will be an improve­
ment. Additionally, this plan seeks to provide 
improved service over the next decade to 
100 million homes in the United States by in­
creasing download speeds to 100 Mbps and 
upload speeds to 50 Mbps. The FCC project 
is just a goal and is not mandated. However, 
the plan should get a boost toward its goal, 
because Google plans to release its own 
1Gbps fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network in 
locations across the United States.
Provides an ethical perspective on deci­
sions and situations that involve computers 
and technology. The student is challenged 
to consider “what if” type questions by 
asking what he or she would do in certain 
situations. This feature prompts thoughtful 
discussion and debate.

USB flash drives are very popular, but 
many experts worry that they pose a 
great security risk. Some companies 
are so concerned about corporate es­
pionage that they disable USB ports 
to prevent the unauthorized copying 
of data. Even so, many people carry a 
lot of critical or personal data on their 
USB flash drives. What are the implica­
tions if the device is lost? Should USB 
drive manufacturers be required to pro­
vide a means of securing these devices 
or some type of registration process? 
With such processes in place, a lost de­
vice could be returned to the manufac­
turer and matched to the owner. What 
actions should individuals take to safe­
guard their data? Is hooking a USB flash 
drive to your backpack or keychain a 
very good idea? If you found a USB flash 
drive and did not know who it belonged 
to, what would you do? What should 
you do?
Green Technology
Suggests eco-friendly solutions to living and 
working with technology, from actions stu­
dents can apply on their own to those that are 
i n i t i a ted by compa n ies an d o rga nizat ion s i n a n 
effort to preserve the environment.
More than 700 million inkjet and laser 
toner cartridges are sold every year. 
What happens when they are empty? 
Although many organizations and retail 
stores have recycling programs, every 
second nearly eight used cartridges 
are thrown away in the United States— 
approximately 875 million pounds of en­
vironmental waste each year! So what 
can you do? Take advantage of your 
local recycling program. Keeping them 
out of the waste stream reduces toxic­
ity levels and saves landfill space. Addi­
tionally, a half-gallon of oil is saved for 
every toner cartridge you recycle!

Objective 1 | 
Understand 
Computers: 
Yesterday, Today, 
and Tomorrow
As a freelance Interior Designer, you have 
just accepted a project to work with an ar­
chitectural firm that has a combination of 
old and new computer equipment. You are 
working specifically with three individuals 
who use both desktop units and mobile 
devices. You need to be sure that all of 
the programs that the project requires 
are compatible with all systems. Where 
do you start?
Computers are an integral part of 
daily life; depending on your age, you may 
not even remember a time without them. 
Think about it, how many technology- 
based applications or devices do you use in 
a day? Do you know how many of these ap­
plications or devices did not exist 10 years 
ago? How many do you think will be in use 
10 years from now? From the following list 
of computer applications and devices, how 
many have you used?
• Word processor: A popular application 
that you use to create documents and 
to automatically check spelling and 
grammar in a document.
• Internet: A connected system of com­
puters with which you search for in­
formation and which enables activities 
such as social networking.
• Online banking: An Internet applica­
tion provided by a bank that enables 
you to open an account, transfer 
money from one account to another, or 
pay a mortgage— all from the comfort 
of your own computer or mobile device.
• Online classes: Instruction offered, 
over the Internet, using learning man­
agement software such as Blackboard, 
Moodle, or Pearson’s MylTLab. and 
which enables you to communicate 
with your instructor and other stu­
dents in the class.
• G PS systems: Computing devices that 
provide driving directions from your 
current location to a destination that 
you enter, and can provide information 
about local restaurants, gas stations, 
fast-food chains, and even the phone 
number for your favorite pizza place.
• ATMs: An automated teller machine 
that connects to the database of bank­
ing institutions with which you can 
perform financial transactions from 
public places.
• Mobile phones: Your favorite telecom­
munication device that, in addition to 
communication, also provides conve­
niences such as a calculator, a calen­
dar, and Internet connectivity.
You use computers at home, at work, 
and in school; they are embedded in your 
car, your phone, and your camera. The 
real power of a computer is when you use 
technology to collect information and then 
share that information with others locally 
and globally, and use the information to 
make decisions. It is useful to look back at 
the events that led up to the current state 
of technology and then look forward to 
future technological advancements to see 
how they relate to your education and your 
future employment.
Concept 1.01 Taking a Brief 
Look Back
Looking at the past clarifies the pres­
ent and directs your future. Think about 
changes that have occurred in your life as 
a result of technological innovations in the 
past decade. Then think of your parents 
and how the changes in technology over 
the past three decades have affected them.
In the 1980s, only the U.S. govern­
ment and large universities were able to 
access the Internet— including e-mail. Cell 
phones were just coming into use. Fax 
machines were the fastest way for most 
businesses to share documents across dis­
tances. The World Wide Web would not 
become viable until 1993. Today millions 
of people around the world use the Inter­
net in both their professional and personal 
lives. Cell phones, laptop computers, and 
the need for instant connectivity are a 
vital component of daily mobile life. G PS 
units guide travelers to their destinations. 
Retail e-commerce, which did not begin 
until 1995, had sales of $32 billion in the 
third quarter of 2009, and is projected to 
grow to $203 billion by 2013.

Concept 1.04 Understanding 
the Computer: Basic Definitions
A com puter is an electronic device that 
performs the four basic operations that com­
prise the inform ation processing cycle 
(Figure 1.5). The four basic operations are:
• In put: The action of entering data 
into a computer; for example, typing 
your login ID.
• Processing: The manipulation of the 
input—data— by a sequence of instruc­
tions that converts the input into infor­
mation. Information is data converted 
into a meaningful format. Examples of 
processing would be aligning the return 
address in a letter that you are typing 
in Microsoft Word, using a function to 
average a column of numbers in a 
Microsoft Excel worksheet, or searching 
a database to confirm a login ID number.
• O utput. The display of the informa­
tion; for example, the realigned return 
address in your letter, the computed 
average of the numbers in your work­
sheet, or the confirmation of the entry 
of a valid login ID.
• S torage: The action of saving 
information for later use.

noticeable role in your life it is harder to 
understand the difference between the 
appropriate and inappropriate use of these 
technologies. Even trying to decide on the 
type of computer to purchase for your 
daily life can be an overwhelming task 
(Figure 1.4). But the more you understand 
and learn about computers the less 
mysterious and confusing they will 
seem and the better prepared you 
will be to make technology-related 
decisions.
Objective 2 | 
Identify Computer 
Fundamentals
In your job as a freelance Interior 
Designer, you want to develop a list 
of the programs, the operating systems 
they are compatible with, and the 
hardware specifications each requires 
for both yourself and your clients.
This will determine if any programs 
need to be eliminated or any hardware 
updated before the project begins.
Where do you start?

Input Data: login ID

Store on the hard 
disk the ID of user 
and time of login
FIGURE 1.5 The infor­
mation processing cycle is 
the sequential path that data 
travels from input through 
output.
Because these operations depend on 
one another, the information process­
ing cycle, commonly abbreviated as the 
IPOS cycle, is always performed in this 
sequence.
A com puter system, also referred 
to as a system, is a collection of related 
components that work together to accom­
plish a task. A computer system has two 
categories of components—hardw are 
and softw are. A computer system’s hard­
ware includes all the physical components 
of the computer and its related devices. 
The system  unit is the base unit of the 
computer and is made up of the plastic or 
metal enclosure. The system unit houses 
the m otherboard and the integrated 
p eriph erals. The motherboard is a circuit 
board that connects the central process­
ing unit, which is anchored to the board 
along with other system components.
The central processing unit, also referred 
to as the CPU, acts as the brain of the 
computer by controlling all the functions 
performed by the other components, and 
processing all the commands it receives 
from software. Integrated peripherals are 
the devices embedded within the system 
unit case and generally include the power 
supply, cooling fans, memory, CD or DVD 
drive, and internal hard drive. Hardware 
also includes the periph eral devices— 
components outside the system unit that 
are connected physically or wirelessly 
to the system unit and motherboard.
Peripheral devices include such things as 
keyboards, mice, monitors, printers, speak­
ers, external webcams, external modems, 
and external storage devices (Figure 1.6).
A computer system’s hardware must 
have software— also referred to as pro­
grams— to function. Software is a set of 
instructions that tells the hardware how 
to perform a certain task. The two primary 
types of software are:
A pplication softw are includes all 
the programs that direct the computer 
to carry out specific tasks; for example, 
doing word processing, playing a game, 
or computing numbers on a worksheet. 
Often, multiple programs are integrated 
to create an application; for example the 
programs to check spelling, check gram­
mar, locate synonyms, and insert a header 
or footer are combined with many other 
such programs to create a word processing 
application.
System softw are includes the pro­
grams that enable the computer’s hard­
ware to work with and run the application 
software, which is computer software 
that your computer uses to accomplish 
specific tasks like word processing or 
accounting. System software is the inter­
face between you and the other programs 
and the computer's hardware. There are 
two categories of system software— 
operating system s and system  u tilities. 
The operating system, also referred to 
as the OS, is a computer program that

manages all the other programs on your 
computer, stores files in an organized 
manner, and coordinates the use of the 
computer hardware such as the keyboard 
and mouse. Because of the operating sys­
tem, you do not have to interact directly 
with the hardware— other than clicking 
the mouse button or pressing keys on the 
keyboard— to complete tasks. Common 
operating systems include Microsoft W in­
dows 7, Microsoft Vista, Microsoft W in­
dows XP, Linux, Mac OS X Snow Leopard, 
and Mac OS X  Lion. Due to advances in 
both hardware and software, new ver­
sions of operating systems are released 
frequently; for example, the next version
Cable or DSL modem
of Microsoft Windows will be available in 
2012, and Mac OS X Lion was released in 
2011. New releases of operating systems 
typically improve performance and accom­
modate new hardware devices. System 
utility programs differ from operating sys­
tems in that they aid in the maintenance 
of your system, your individual devices, 
or your installed programs. Examples of 
system utilities include backup programs, 
hard disk cleanup tools, and antivirus 
software. You could compare a computer 
system to an aquarium. The computer 
hardware is the fish tank, the operating 
system is the water, and the software ap­
plications are the fish (Figure 1.7). Fish

Concept 1.06 Transforming 
Data into Information: 
Processing
Processing transforms your data into 
information—data that is organized in 
a useful manner. During the processing 
step of the information processing cycle, 
the computer’s processing circuitry 
(Figure 1.9)— the central processing unit 
(CPU)— receives directions from the oper­
ating system software and the application 
software to perform operations on the data 
you input. The C PU  is sometimes referred 
to as the microprocessor or just processor.
The C PU —a single chip located on 
the motherboard— is often referred to as 
the brain of the computer; however, com­
puters do not actually think. A computer 
is capable of performing only repetitive 
processing actions organized into an 
algorith m — a series of steps that describe 
what a computer program must do to 
solve a logical or mathematical problem 
or to perform a task. After an algorithm 
is developed and approved, it is coded into 
a language that the computer hardware 
understands, tested for accuracy, and be­
comes the program or software that the 
system uses to solve that problem.
Because the C PU  must juggle multiple 
input and output requests at the same 
time, it uses m em ory— a device where in­
formation can be stored and retrieved—in 
the form of high-speed m em ory chips to 
store program instructions and data so it 
can move between requests quickly.
A memory chip is an integrated circuit 
devoted to memory storage. A typical

ON THE JOB J
The job responsibilities of an Adminis­
trative Assistant might surprise you. In 
most positions of this type, the require­
ments to create and modify documents 
such as invoices, reports, memos, let­
ters, and financial statements using word 
processing, spreadsheet, database and 
other software such as Microsoft Of­
fice, QuickBooks, or other programs are 
typically listed in the top three required 
skills. Additional skills required include: 
the ability to conduct efficient research 
and searches; compile data and prepare 
papers for consideration and presenta­
tion to the Executive Director and Board 
of Directors; set up and coordinate meet­
ings and conferences including verifying 
attendance via e-mail or other electronic 
means; and preparing and electronically 
distributing agendas for meetings. Re­
cent job postings for this position indicate 
experience with both Windows and Mac 
OS operating systems as a requirement. 
Are you surprised at the level of familiar­
ity with technology that is expected from 
a candidate for an Administrative Assis­
tant position? Evaluate your own creden­
tials. Could you apply for such a position? 
If not, what courses should you take to 
prepare yourself for jobs that require 
computer skills?

cannot survive without water, just as 
software applications cannot function 
without an operating system. Without 
the water and fish, an aquarium is an 
empty box—without an operating system 
and application software, a computer is 
also an empty box.
Concept 1.05 Getting Data 
into the Computer: Input
You input d a ta — numbers, words, 
pictures, or sounds that 
represent facts about 
people, events, things, 
or ideas— into a com­
puter for processing 
by using input de­
vices. The most com­
mon input devices are 
the keyboard and 
mouse (Figure 1.8).

computer contains several types of mem­
ory on the motherboard, the most impor­
tant of which is random  access m em ory 
abbreviated as RAM. RAM temporarily 
stores the programs and data with which 
the C PU  is interacting. RAM is also 
referred to as primary memory or tempo­
rary memory. RAM is temporary because 
it does not retain any content when power 
is interrupted or turned off.
Concept 1.07 Displaying 
Information: Output
You experience output through output 
devices such as a monitor, printer, or 
speakers that enable you to view, see, and 
hear the results of processing operations 
(Figure 1.10).
FIG U RE 1.10 The display on a monitor or a paper 
printout is the most common output.
Concept 1.08 Holding 
Programs and Data for 
Future Use: Storage
Think of the task of typing data in a word 
processing program such as Microsoft Word. 
While you are typing, your data— input—is 
held in RAM until you save and name your 
document. When you save your work, 
your computer uses a storage device—
hardware that retains your programs 
and data even when power is disrupted 
or turned off. Storage devices, also re­
ferred to as secondary storage, can be 
both integrated and external peripherals 
(Figure 1.11), depending on whether you 
want the information you are storing to 
remain on the computer at which you are 
working or needs to be portable and trans­
ferable to another computing device. The 
internal hard disk on your system holds all 
the programs— both system and applica­
tion software— and data that are intended 
to remain within your computer system. 
This storage device is usually an integrated 
peripheral, which means it is mounted 
inside your system unit’s enclosure. It is 
not visible and most often never replaced.
If you have a lot of data that you want to 
be portable, or if you want to back up criti­
cal data, you can use a nonintegrated hard 
disk connected to the system unit by a 
U SB  cable. These external storage devices 
are often colorful, fit into an average sized 
eyeglass case, and are economical. If your 
file sizes are smaller, but you still want 
your data to be portable, use a CD, DVD, 
media card, or USB flash drive— a small 
data storage device that plugs into a com­
puter’s U SB  port—instead of an external 
hard drive ( Figure 1.12). U S B  is an acro­
nym for universal serial bus, which is a 
standard for data transfer when connect­
ing peripherals to a computer.
The U S B  flash drive is very popular.
It is small and often referred to as a 
thumb drive because it is about the size 
of an adult’s thumb. Additionally, a U SB  
flash drive can store up to 256 G B of 
data—the equivalent of approximately 
365 CDs or 51,000 images— uses 
solid-state technology, conveniently 
plugs into a computer’s U S B  port, is 
easy to use, is rewritable, and is 
inexpensive.
FIG U RE 1.11 Hard 
drives can store very large 
quantities of data, making 
them the media of choice for 
activities that generate large 
files like movies, pictures, 
and backups.

Concept 1.09 Moving Data: 
Communications
C om m unications, in the digital sense, 
is the high-speed exchange of information 
within and between computers or other 
communication devices. Communication is 
vital to our increasingly global and mobile 
society. You depend on the easy transfer of 
information from your computer or smart­
phone to the server that hosts your Web 
site, from a school computer to the one at 
your home, or from your iPad to a company 
server. To communicate, computers must 
be connected to a network by a commu­
nications device, which is a hardware 
component that moves data into and out of 
a computer. These include modems, cables, 
ports, and devices like smartphones, tablets, 
and notebooks. Two or more connected com­
puters are called a network. You create a 
network so that you can share information 
and also share computer resources such as 
printers and other input/output devices.
Most computers are equipped with a 
m odem , which is short for modulator/de­
modulator. A modem is a communications 
device that converts data from one form 
into another. A modem enables the com­
puter, which is a digital device, to access 
data through non-digital media such as

telephone lines, cable, satellite, and cellu­
lar connections. Many computers have in­
ternal modems for dial-up Internet access 
over a standard telephone line. External 
modems provide high-speed access to the 
Internet via cable, D SL (digital subscriber 
line), or satellite.
Another important communication de­
vice is the network interface ca rd —also 
referred to as NIC— which is a hardware 
component that connects a computer to a 
network. The network interface card is usu­
ally located within the system unit. Many 
computers already have the N IC  integrated 
into the motherboard, but external NICs 
can be plugged into a U S B  port or inserted 
into a specially designed slot. NICs can con­
nect to wired or wireless networks.
Concept 1.10 Examining the 
Information Processing Cycle 
in Action
The following example illustrates your role 
and the computer’s role in each step of the 
information processing cycle (Figure 1.13):

paper for a class. You know it has mis­
spellings and grammatical errors, but

your word processing program’s spell­
ing checker at any time to help correct 
the errors. The document that you are 
typing is the input.
• Processing: A spelling checker pro­
gram uses the computer’s ability to 
perform processing operations to con­
struct a list of all of the words in your 
document. The program compares 
your words against its own dictionary 
of correctly spelled words. If  you use a 
word that is not in the computer’s dic­
tionary, the program flags the word as 
a misspelling.
The computer’s spelling checker 
program does not have the intelligence 
to check your spelling. Rather, it simply 
flags words that do not match any of the 
words in its dictionary. Such a program 
will not flag the word sign as misspelled 
even though you intended to type sing 
a song rather than sign a song, because 
both words are contained in the program’s 
dictionary. Your own knowledge and proof­
reading skills are still required.
• Output: The result—the output—of the 
spelling checker processing operation is 
a document containing words that are 
flagged as being possibly misspelled. 
Word processing programs typically 
flag possible misspellings with a red 
wavy line under the word. Many words 
that are flagged as misspelled are actu­
ally spelled correctly; they are simply 
not in the program’s dictionary.
• Storage: After you correct any mis­
spellings in your document, you save 
or store the revised document to the 
integrated hard disk or an external 
portable storage device.

Recognize Operating 
Systems and Their 
Functions
In your job as a freelance Interior De­
signer, you realize you have an older 
version of an operating system than 
members of the architectural firm with 
whom you are working on this project. 
You want to upgrade your system but are
hesitant because your other projects are 
still in progress and clients associated 
with them are still using the older sys­
tems. You need to know how an update 
to your system will affect the files associ­
ated with your other projects. Where do 
you start?
Recall that system software includes 
all the programs that provide the infra­
structure and hardware control necessary 
for the computer and its peripheral de­
vices. System software tells the computer 
how to be a computer. Some system soft­
ware works without any action on your 
part, and some requires your guidance 
and control.
Recall also that system software has 
two major components—the operating sys­
tem and the system utilities.
The operating system manages the 
resources of a computer; its primary func­
tions include:
• Starting the computer and transfer­
ring files from the storage device to 
RAM memory
• Managing programs that are active or 
running in the background
• Managing random access memory 
(RAM ) to optimize its use
• Coordinating tasks including the com­
munication between input and output 
devices and programs
• Providing a user interface to allow for 
easy and seamless communication be­
tween you and your computer
Thus, a computer must have an operat­
ing system to coordinate the interactions of 
its hardware components and to coordinate 
the interaction of the hardware with the 
application software. The operating system 
software is typically stored on the comput­
er’s hard disk, although it can be stored and 
transferred from a U SB  drive, CD, or DVD. 
On some small handheld computers and 
smartphones, the operating system is held 
on a memory chip within the system unit.
You can think of the operating system 
as a traffic officer standing at a busy inter­
section (Figure 1.14). Imagine the traffic 
at a downtown intersection at rush hour, 
and you will have a good idea of what it is 
like inside a computer. Bits of information 
travel around at incredible speeds, sent 
in different directions by the operating 
system, the electronic equivalent of a 
busy traffic officer. Impatient peripherals 
and programs are honking their horns 
trying to get the officer’s attention. Then

the city’s mayor—you—wants to come 
through right now. Just like a traffic officer, 
the computer’s operating system—stand­
ing at the intersection of the computer’s 
hardware, application programs, and you— 
keeps traffic running smoothly.
Concept 1.11 
Starting the 
Computer
When you start a computer, the operat­
ing system is transferred from a storage 
device, such as the hard disk, into the 
computer’s RAM (random access memory). 
RAM is a form of volatile m em ory, which 
is storage that is very fast, located on the 
motherboard, and whose content is erased 
when the power goes of!’. RAM stores the 
programs you are using and computer files 
on which you are working, for example, a 
Microsoft Word document. The process of 
loading the operating system into memory 
is called booting. A cold boot refers to 
starting a computer that has not yet been 
turned on. A warm  boot refers to restart­
ing a computer that is already on. A warm 
boot, also called a restart, is typically re­
quired afler installing new software, after 
an application stops working, or when 
your system becomes unresponsive. On
a computer running the Microsoft Windows 
7 operating system, you can perform a re­
start by following these steps (Figure 1.15):
1. Click the Start button.
2. Click on the right arrow located to the 
right of the Shut down button.
3. Click Restart.

3. Load OS.
With both types of booting, the com­
puter copies the kernel—the central part 
of the operating system that manages 
memory, files, and devices; launches appli­
cations; and allocates system resources— 
from the hard disk into the computer’s 
RAM memory. Because the kernel remains 
in RAM  during the time a computer is 
powered on, it is referred to as being 
m em ory resident. Less frequently used 
portions of the operating system are stored 
on the hard disk and retrieved as needed, 
and thus are referred to as nonresident 
because they do not reside in memory.
The booting of a system, whether it is 
a cold or warm boot, is a step-by-step pro­
cess (Figure 1.16):
1. Activate the basic input/output system 
(BIO S)
2. Perform the power-on self-test (POST)
3. Load the operating system into RAM
4. Configure and customize settings
5. Load needed system utilities
6. Authenticate the user
The following sections discuss each of 
these boot steps in detail.
Leaving a computer running when it 
is not in use is wasteful. By default, a com­
puter running Windows 7 and Windows 
Vista will go into sleep mode after a period 
of inactivity, saving its owner $70 or more 
in annual energy costs. There are three

energy states you can adjust in Windows 7 
to help conserve energy.
• Use the sleep sta te  to transfer the 
current state of your computer to 
RAM, turn off all unneeded functions, 
and place the system in a low power 
state. Returning from the sleep state 
is faster than returning from hiber­
nate state because the computer’s set­
tings are held in RAM  memory.
• Use the hibernate sta te  to save 
battery power. Primarily for use in 
laptops, this state saves your open 
documents and programs on your hard 
disk and then turns off your computer. 
When you restart your system, all 
windows and programs that were open 
restore automatically.
• On a desktop computer, use the 
hybrid sleep state. This state com­
bines sleep and hibernate. It places 
open documents and programs in both 
RAM and on your hard disk, and then 
places the system in a low power state 
so you can resume your work quickly. 
If power is suddenly terminated, your 
work can be restored. The hybrid sleep 
state is usually turned on by default 
on most desktop computers.
To access the settings for sleep and 
hibernate states in Windows 7, click the 
Start button, click Control Panel, click 
System and Security, and then click Power

Step 1: Activate the BIOS and 
Setup Program
When you first turn on or reset a PC, 
electricity Hows from the power supply 
through the system. When the C PU  re­
ceives the signal that the power level is 
sufficient, it is directed to the BIO S ROM

for the start of the system’s BIO S boot pro­
gram. The BIOS (basic input/output sys­
tem) information is permanently written 
in the computer’s ROM. ROM. or read- 
only m entory, is nonvolatile memory lo­
cated on the motherboard that is not easily 
edited and keeps its content even when 
the system powers off. BIO S data consists 
of descriptions of the equipment that your 
system contains, typically the CPU, hard 
disk, RAM, and video component— equip­
ment you do not usually replace. The op­
erating system then uses the B IO S data 
to control those devices. Other external 
devices that you change frequently, such 
as jump drives and speakers, are not run 
by BIO S, but are controlled and accessed 
by the operating system directly. After the 
BIO S is located, you may briefly see the 
BIO S screen, a text-only screen that pro­
vides information about BIOS-controlled 
devices (Figure 1.19). B IO S information 
should not be changed by an amateur; 
making an incorrect change will cause 
your system not to boot.
Step 2: Initiate the Power-On Self-Test
After the BIO S instructions are loaded 
into RAM memory, a series of tests are 
conducted to make sure that the computer 
and associated peripherals are operat­
ing correctly. Collectively, these tests are 
known as the power-on self-test (POST). 
Among the components tested are the 
computer’s main memory (RAM), the 
keyboard, mouse, disk drives, and the hard

disk. If any of the power-on self-tests fail, 
you will hear a beep, see an error message, 
and the computer will stop. You can often 
correct such problems by making sure 
that components, such as keyboards, are 
plugged in securely. If you cannot correct 
the error, count the number of beeps, call 
technical support, and convey the number 
of beeps and the error message.
Step 3: Load the Operating System
After the power-on self-test is successfully 
completed, the BIO S initiates a search 
for the operating system. On most PCs, 
the operating system is on the computer’s 
hard disk. If other possible locations for 
the operating system exist such as an opti­
cal drive, a floppy drive, or a hard disk, 
BIO S will specify these options and the or­
der in which they are to be searched.
When BIO S locates the operating sys­
tem, it loads the operating system's kernel 
into RAM  memory. At that point, the oper­
ating system takes control of the computer 
from BIO S and begins loading system con­
figuration information.
Step 4: Configure the System
In Microsoft Windows, configuration infor­
mation about installed peripheral devices 
and software is stored in a database called 
the registry. The registry also contains in­
formation about your personalized choices, 
such as background graphics and mouse 
settings.
After the operating system’s kernel is 
loaded, it checks the system's configura­
tion to determine which drivers and other 
utility programs are needed. A d river is 
a program containing instructions that 
make a peripheral device, like an external 
hard drive, printer, or DVD player, usable 
by an operating system.
Windows and Mac operating systems 
are equipped with plug-and-play (PnP)
capabilities, which automatically detect 
new PnP-compatible peripheral devices 
that you might have installed while the 
power was switched off, load the necessary 
drivers, and check for conflicts with other 
devices. Peripheral devices equipped 
with PnP features identify themselves 
to the operating system and require no 
action by you.
Step 5: Load System Utilities
After the operating system detects and 
configures all of the system’s hardware, 
it loads system utilities such as speaker 
volume control, antivirus software, and 
power management options. In Microsoft 
Windows, you can view available custom 
configuration choices by right-clicking the 
icon of the feature you want to reconfigure. 
The icons are located in the notification 
area on the right side of the Windows 
taskbar and also on the Control Panel 
that you can access from the Start menu 
(Figure 1.20).
Step 6: Authenticate a User
When the operating system finishes load­
ing, you may see a request for a user name 
and password. Through this process, called 
authentication  or login, you verify that 
you are the person who is authorized to 
use the computer.
Most consumer-oriented operating 
systems, such as Microsoft Windows and 
the Mac operating system, require or 
highly recommend that you supply a user 
name and password to use the computer.
A p ro file , a record of a specific user’s 
preferences for the desktop theme, icons, 
and menu styles, is associated with a user 
name. If you set up a profile for yourself, 
your preferences will display on the screen 
after you log in.
On multiuser computer systems such 
as your college lab or office, you must have

trator to access a computer. Your account 
consists of your user name, password, and 
allotted storage space. This information is 
stored in a user folder or user directory.
After the operating system is loaded 
and running, the next task that the oper­
ating system must perform is to manage 
applications.
Concept 1.12 Managing 
Applications
Running and managing applications is an 
important task of the operating system.
Operating systems are referred to 
as m u ltita sk in g  operating system s 
because they permit more than one ap­
plication to run at the same time and can 
manage multiple applications running 
simultaneously. The operating system is 
able to switch between applications as 
needed. For example, you can run Micro­
soft Word and Excel at the same time. 
When you are using Word, it is active and 
is referred to as the foreground a p p li­
cation. Excel is inactive, although it is 
running, and is referred to as the back­
grou nd application , as indicated by its 
appearance on the desktop (Figure 1.21).
A clear measure of an operating sys­
tem’s stability is the technique it uses
to handle multitasking and thus avoid 
conflicts among open programs. Modern 
operating systems use p reem ptive m ul­
tita sk in g —an environment in which 
programs do not run from start to finish 
but are interrupted or suspended in order 
to start or continue to run another task. 
Each task receives a recurring slice of 
time from the CPU. The time slice may 
or may not be the same for all programs. 
When one task uses its time slice or is 
interrupted by a task of higher priority, 
the task is suspended and the other task 
starts. This method of multitasking en­
sures that all applications have fair 
access to the CPU.
Concept 1.13 Managing 
Memory
Your computer programs would run very 
slowly if the operating system had to con­
stantly access the program instructions 
from their storage location on the hard 
disk. To ensure that programs run quickly, 
operating systems use the computer’s 
RAM  as a buffer—an area that temporar­
ily holds data and instructions. Because 
the computer’s operating system is re­
sponsible for managing this memory area, 
it gives each running program, and some 
devices, a portion of RAM, and then keeps

the programs from interfering with each 
other’s use of memory (Figure 1.22).
For example, if you give a command 
to print three documents one right after 
another, while the printer is printing the 
first document, the second and third docu­
ments are held in the print buffer. The 
documents wait in the buffer until the 
spooling program —a program that mon­
itors the print requests in the buffer and 
the busy state of the printer— indicates 
that the printer is available. Then the 
second document moves from the buffer to 
the printer. This process continues until 
the print buffer is empty. For this reason, 
turning off the printer to stop the print­
ing of a document will not work, because 
turning off the printer does not empty the
computer’s print buffer. When you turn 
the printer on again, the documents in 
the print buffer continue to print. To stop 
documents in the print buffer from print­
ing, follow the steps in Figure 1.23.
Modern operating systems can artifi­
cially extend the computer’s RAM by using 
virtu al memory—a technique that uses a 
portion of the computer’s hard disk as an 
extension of RAM. Program instructions 
and data are divided into fixed size units 
called pages. If memory is full, the operat­
ing system starts storing copies of pages 
in a hard disk file called the sw ap file, 
thereby creating a temporary storage space 
for instructions that the operating system 
can access as you do your work. When the 
pages are needed, they are copied back into

RAM (Figure 1.24). The process of transfer­
ring files from the hard disk to RAM and 
back is called paging.
Although virtual memory gives you 
more memory than the amount of RAM in­
stalled on your computer, excessive paging— 
referred to as thrashing—can slow down 
your system over time.
Concept 1.14 
Coordinating Tasks
Your operating system coordinates tasks 
involving input and output devices, and 
also enables communication with these de­
vices and the programs in use.
Most operating systems come with 
device drivers for popular input and out­
put devices. Device drivers are programs 
containing specific instructions to allow 
a particular brand and model of input or 
output device to communicate and func­
tion properly with the operating system. 
Printers, scanners, monitors, speakers,
and the mouse all have drivers. 
Hardware manufacturers usu­
ally update their drivers when 
new operating systems become 
Document 
available and make the up­
grades available on their Web 
site. When you change devices 
within the Windows operating 
system, the Windows Update 
feature automatically detects 
new hardware and installs the 
required driver.
Concept 1.15 Providing the 
User Interface
For you, the most important function of an 
operating system is providing a user inter­
face—the part of the operating system that 
lets you interact with the computer and 
the programs—that is efficient and easy to 
use. Three types of user interfaces include 
the g raph ical user interface, the menu- 
driven user interface, and the command 
line user interface (Figure 1.25).
By far the most popular user interface 
is the graphical user interface, which is 
commonly abbreviated GUI and pronounced 
GOO-ee. You are probably familiar with 
this interface, which uses graphics and the 
point-and-click technology of the mouse to 
give commands to the operating system and 
your application programs. By using this in­
terface, you work with icons, small images 
that represent computer resources such 
as programs, data files, and network
transferred data or 
program instructions

Objective 4 | Utilize 
Standalone Operating 
Systems
In your job as a freelance Interior De­
signer, you frequently visit the office of 
your clients and those with whom you 
partner on some projects. You need a 
new portable computer system, because 
your current laptop computer is out­
dated. Although an iPad or netbook is 
appealing, you are unsure of the compat­
ibility of the operating systems on these 
devices with the operating system on 
the desktop in your office. Where do 
you start?
A standalone operating system works 
on a desktop computer, laptop, notebook, 
or any portable computing device. The 
term standalone indicates that it does not 
need to be connected to any other system 
or computer to run. Almost all of the oper­
ating systems in the standalone category 
are enhanced with enough networking 
capabilities and connectivity options to 
allow them to manage a home or small 
business network; these options are usu­
ally installed when the system is pur­
chased. The key word here is small.
Concept 1.17 Using Microsoft 
Windows
Microsoft Windows is by far the most 
popular group of operating systems in this 
category. Since its introduction in 1985, this 
operating system, known simply as Win­
dows, has gone through a number of itera­
tions and is the most widely used operating 
system in the world. The first quarter of 
2011, however, saw Window’s usage drop 
below 90 percent of the market. The reason 
associated with this statistic was the in­
crease in use of mobile devices and operating 
systems like iOS and Android. To view a 
compressed timeline highlighting some key 
developments in the Windows operating sys­
tem, see Figure 1.29. A more detailed time­
line is available at w w w .com puterhope 
.com /history/w indow s.htm .
M icrosoft W indows 7 was released 
in late 2009 and is available in six differ­
ent versions: Starter, Home Basic, Home 
Premium, Professional, Enterprise, and 
Ultimate (Figure 1.30). All versions of W in­
dows 7 claim to be more efficient than its 
predecessor, Windows Vista, performing 
equally or better on the same hardware, 
and resolving the compatibility issues that 
existed between applications. The next 
version of Windows will release in 2012.

Windows 7 Editions
Edition
Features
Windows 7 Starter
Designed for small laptop computers. This edition must be preinstalled on systems and is not 
available for individual purchase.
Windows 7 Home 
Basic
This is the other non-premium edition and is available only in emerging markets, not in the 
United States, Canada, Europe, and other developed nations. It is more graphically interesting than 
Starter but lacks premium features like Windows Media Center.
Windows 7 Home 
Premium
This is the entry-level edition for most consumer PCs. It has the full Aero interface—translucent 
design, subtle animation, and additional colors—and includes Windows Media Center.
Windows 7 
Professional
This is the preferred edition for businesses and advanced home users. It builds on Home Premium 
and runs a remote desktop server, encrypts files, and makes network folders available offline.
Windows 7 Enterprise
Enterprise and Ultimate editions have most of the same features, but the Enterprise edition is geared to 
companies and organizations that have users and systems to manage. It is available through volume licensing.
Windows 7 Ultimate
The Ultimate edition is for the high-end user, gamer, and multimedia professionals. It includes 
BitLocker disk encryption, which also works on USB flash drives.

Windows 7 includes features to make 
using your system and its components 
simpler. See Figure 1.31 for an overview of 
some of these features.
The next version of Windows will include 
file download verification, a built-in PDF 
reader, a history vault that will take a snap­
shot of your entire hard drive and let you re­
store your system easily to a prior state, and 
multi-touch screen capability. Additionally, 
rather than requiring multiple versions for 
different devices, this next version of 
Windows will have a single version to run on 
all devices—laptops, tablets, and desktops.
Windows 7 Features That Make Using Your System Simpler
Feature
Description
Aero
A feature that enables subtle animations and translucent glass windows that can be custom colored. It also 
enables live previews of programs on the taskbar by simply moving the mouse over them.
Jump List
A list activated by right-clicking an icon on the taskbar or the Start menu. The options in the list are specific 
lo the icon clicked. By selecting an option in the jump list, you are taken directly to that location.
Peek
A feature that makes all open windows transparent enabling you to see through them and view all icons and 
gadgets on your desktop. Point to the end of the taskbar to enable this feature.
Pin
The action of dragging your favorite program from the desktop to the taskbar or Start menu. Removing it from 
the taskbar or Start menu is accomplished by dragging it off the taskbar.
Shake
A way to focus on only one window on a cluttered desktop. Click on the title bar of the window you want to focus 
on and shake your mouse. All other windows, except the one your mouse is on, will disappear. To restore all 
windows, shake the mouse again.
Snap
A technique to resize open windows by dragging them to the edges of your screen.
Windows
Search
A feature activated by typing a description of what you want to locate in the search box located at the bottom of 
the Start menu. The results will be a list of relevant documents, pictures, music, and e-mail that match your search 
term. Because most people store data on several devices, Windows 7 can search external hard drives, networked 
PCs, and libraries—a Windows 7 feature that groups related files together regardless of their storage location.

Concept 1.18 Using MAC OS
The original Macintosh operating system, 
called Mac OS and released in 1984, was 
the first operating system to popularize 
the graphical user interface. Although Ap­
ple eventually lost market share to Micro­
soft, the Apple Macintosh has a large user 
base and they are avid fans of the system. 
Many people prefer the Mac OS for its 
stability and ease of use, although the in­
terfaces of Macs and PCs are very similar 
(Figure 1.32). Operating systems for the 
Macintosh were numbered as Mac OS 8, 
Mac OS 9, and Mac OS X (X for the Ro­
man numeral 10). Newer versions of Mac 
OS X have, in addition to their numeric 
identification, names associated with large 
cats. Mac OS vlO.O is Cheetah and Mac 
OS vl0.6 is Snow Leopard. For a detailed 
explanation of Mac OS X, go to w w w  
.apple.com /m acosx/w hat-is/.
Mac OS X Snow Leopard, released in 
2009, occupies up to 50 percent less RAM 
than the previous version. It includes a 
more I’esponsive Finder, a Put Back option 
to return deleted items to their original 
location, more reliable ejection of external 
drives, faster shut down and wake up, four 
new fonts, 80 percent faster Time Machine 
backup, increased Airport signal strength 
for wireless networks, and built-in support 
for Microsoft Exchange Server 2007.
Mac OS X L ion , Apple’s newest op­
erating system released in 2011, claims to 
have over 250 new features. Go to http:// 
w w w .app le.coni/m acosx/w hats-new / 
featu res.h tm l to view details on this 
new and more intuitive operating 
system.
Concept 1.19 Using Unix
UNIX is a pioneering operating system 
that was developed at A T&T’s Bell Labo­
ratories in 1969 and continues to define 
what an operating system should do and 
how it should work. Pronounced YOU-nix, 
it is a free operating system, defaults to a 
command line interface, features preemp­
tive multitasking, and is installed primar­
ily on workstations. An online tutorial on 
U N IX  is available at w w w .ee.surrey 
.ac.uk/T eaching/U nix,
Concept 1.20 Using Linux
In 1991, Finnish university student Linus 
Torvalds introduced Linux, a freeware oper­
ating system for personal computers. Linux 
is open source software, meaning that its 
source code— the code of the program itself— 
is available for you to see and use. Users of 
open source software are invited to scrutinize 
the source code for errors and to share their 
discoveries with the software’s publisher.

Sugar is a version of Linux developed by the 
company Red Hat that focuses on activities 
rather than applications and is used in an 
initiative known as One Laptop per Child or 
OLPC. The goal of OLPC is to provide low- 
cost, low-power, rugged and connected 
notebook computers to the world's poor­
est children. The aim is to encourage self- 
discovery, collaboration, and self-empowered 
learning.
The OLPC idea was founded by Nicho­
las Negroponte and others associated with
FIGuRE 
3 Simple images make navigation 
easy and language neutral.
MIT Media Lab in conjunction with several 
corporate partners including Google, AMD, 
and Red Hat— one of the largest providers 
of open source solutions. There is inequity 
in computer equipment and computer- 
related knowledge between developed, 
developing, and underdeveloped nations. 
Initiatives such as OLPC attempt to close 
this gap.
Figure 1.33 illustrates some of the first 
images a child will see using an OLPC 
computer. The letter X with an O on top 
is symbolic of a man; other symbols stand 
for home, friends, and community.
Although support for OLPC is strong, 
there are still some obstacles, for exam­
ple, getting Internet connectivity to some 
of the remote and poorer regions of the 
world. Some say that without Internet ac­
cessibility in the poorest regions, the com­
puters given to the children will not close 
the knowledge gap. Instead, they say the 
project will increase toxic waste due to dis­
carded computers that either do not work 
or are in need of repair. What do you think?
Three things make Linux desirable: It 
is powerful, runs on all computers, and is 
free. Linux brings to the PC many features 
similar to those found in commercial ver­
sions of U N IX , including multitasking, vir­
tual memory, Internet support, and a GUI. 
Although Linux is powerful and free, some 
versions are proprietary or are available 
for a fee. Because Linux is not a commer­
cial product with a single stable company 
behind it, many corporate chief informa­
tion officers do not want to adopt it to 
manage their systems and users. For the 
latest in Linux news and developments,

Concept 1.21 
Comparing 
Windows, MAC OS, and Linux
Traditionally, computer users have had 
two major platforms to choose from—a 
Mac or a PC. Your system’s platform  is 
determined by the combination of micro­
processor chip and installed operating 
system. Depending on which operating 
system is loaded, your system is simply 
referred to as a Mac or a PC.
As the Linux operating system 
becomes more popular, some people 
may want to consider this third 
alternative.
Linux can be installed on a Mac 
or a PC, and because it is open source 
software, cost is not an issue. Addition­
ally, because very few types of malware 
are targeted at Linux systems, they 
are more secure. Casual computer users 
are unlikely to use a Linux system be­
cause it lacks a structured computer 
support system and because setting 
up and maintaining a Linux system 
requires a higher level of computer 
knowledge.
PCs still dominate in both consumer 
and business use, have the largest portion 
of the market, are the choice of corporate 
America, and tend to be cheaper in terms 
of both hardware and software. There is
24 
G O ! AH In  One | Chapter I: Computer History, Fundamentals, and Operating Systems

also a much larger selection of software 
products to choose from for PCs than there 
is for Mac or Linux systems. In recent 
years, Apple, through its humorous I am a 
Mac, I am a PC commercials, has tried to 
move PC users to Macs by promoting the 
idea that Macs are easier to use.
Figure 1.34 illustrates differences in 
the use of the three main operating sys­
tems as of May 2011.
Concept 1.22 Understanding 
Server Operating Systems
Server operating systems are operating 
systems installed on the server computer 
of a network and designed with specific 
instructions for delivering programs and 
data over the network. Normally they are 
complete operating systems with a file and 
task manager. Additional features like a 
Web server, directory services, and a mes­
saging system are often included.
M icrosoft W indows Server 2008 is 
an upgrade to Microsoft Windows Server 
2003 and is the most current version of a 
sophisticated operating system specifically 
designed to support client/server comput­
ing systems in an enterprise environment. 
Servers are special computers used to 
manage resources on a network, including 
printers, file storage, and Web sites.
Other server operating systems 
include:
• U N IX  and Linux, which are also cat­
egorized in the standalone section. 
They are referred to as multipurpose 
operating systems because they fall 
into both categories.
• Netware by Novell, which is a client/ 
server system that manages con­
current requests from clients and

known for its scalability— the ability 
to expand.
Mac OS X Server, by Apple, supports 
an unlimited number of users and is 
suitable for big companies and IT de­
partments as well as small businesses 
and retail stores.
Concept 1.23 | Understanding 
Embedded Operating Systems
Embedded operating systems are special­
ized operating systems designed for spe­
cific applications. They are usually very 
compact and efficient. They also eliminate 
many features that non-embedded com­
puter operating systems provide because 
the specialized application has no need for 
them. PDAs, cell phones, point-of-sale de­
vices, DVDs, industrial robot controls, and 
even modern toasters that control the tem­
perature based on bread type are examples 
of devices that contain embedded systems 
(Figure 1.35). Some of the more common 
embedded operating systems installed on 
handheld devices are Microsoft Windows 
Mobile, Windows CE, Palm OS, Android, 
and iPhone OS.

Researchers at Bionic Vision Australia (BVA) 
have produced a prototype of a bionic eye 
implant that could bring limited vision to 
the blind by 2013. With the Australian gov­
ernment contributing $40 million to the 
research, the timeframe and continual im­
provements on the prototype look promis­
ing. Here is how the system works:
• A camera is mounted on top of a pair of 
glasses.
• The images are sent to a small proces­
sor housed in a unit about the size of a 
cell phone and carried by the individual.
• The processor, with the help of an em­
bedded operating system, sends a 
condensed image to the chip directly 
implanted onto the retina.
• The chip stimulates the visual neurons 
that, in turn, send rough images to the 
brain for processing.
The challenge in the bionic eye is not to 
get the signals to the brain— that has been 
accomplished— but to improve the resolu­
tion and detail of that signal (Figure 1.36). 
The implication for visually impaired indi­
viduals is beyond anything ever hoped 
for. What are some of the possible appli­
cations for those of us with sight? Think 
about having text magnified without a 
magnifying glass, shading your eyes from 
bright light without having to wear sun­
glasses, and Mom actually having eyes in 
the back of her head. Although the imme­
diate excitement is sight for the blind, who 
cannot help but take that glimpse into the 
future?
Designed for smartphones and PDAs, 
M icrosoft W indows M obile provides a 
user interface for simplified versions of 
Windows programs, such as Microsoft’s 
own Office applications. You can create 
documents on the go and then transfer 
them to a desktop computer for further
processing and printing. Personal informa­
tion management tools, such as a calendar 
and address book, along with an e-mail cli­
ent and a Web browser are included along 
with support for handwriting recognition 
and voice recording. Windows Mobile ver­
sion 6.x will not be upgraded. Rather, it

has been superseded bv Windows Phone 7, 
a mobile operating system designed for 
both the consumer and the business mar­
ket. It has the ability to combine calendars 
into one color-coded image, run Microsoft 
Office and Xbox Live, and use a single 
stroke to send an e-mail.
W indows Em bedded Com pact, one 
of the early embedded operating systems, 
was introduced in 1996 as Windows CE. 
Used by consumer electronic devices like 
handheld PCs, video game players, digi­
tal cameras, and industrial products like 
barcode readers, it is characterized by 
low overhead device drivers and a built-in 
power manager.
The Palm  OS was initially developed 
by Palm Inc. for personal digital assistants 
(PDAs) in 1996. It was designed to use with 
a touch screen running a graphical user 
interface and comes with a suite of personal 
information management applications. The 
most current versions power smartphones 
like the Palm Pixi that runs on the Palm 
webOS platform and responds to a multi- 
touch screen and natural gestures.
Google released an operating system 
for mobile devices, A ndroid 2.2, in 2011. 
The operating system supports CDM A— 
Code Division Multiple Access— and 
provides a higher screen resolution. Sup­
porting CDM A enables carriers such as 
Verizon to sell Android phones. Android 
phones use a touch-screen scroll system 
with which you can scroll to the left and 
right, creating the same three divisions— 
left, center, and right—on your portable
device that you have on a computer 
monitor.
Apple’s iPhone uses iOS (Figure 1.37). 
A new version of this popular operating sys­
tem, iOS 5.0, was released in 2011. Some 
features of the current version include:
• Genius Mixes: Automatically gener­
ated music mixes based on what types 
of music are already in your library
• Genius Recommendations: Sugges­
tions for applications— referred to as 
apps—based on those you have al­
ready downloaded
• Saving video from mail and MMS: 
Multimedia message service—directly 
into Camera Roll
• Save as New Clip option: Enables you 
to keep your original video and save 
the new version when trimming a 
video on the iPhone 4Gs
Objective 5 | Use

In your job as a freelance Interior Designer, 
you have noticed that your desktop com­
puter system seems slow while performing 
tasks like saving a document and multi­
tasking. You have been too busy to perform 
a backup and virus check like a friend 
recommended. As the lead designer on this 
project, you have the final version of many 
of the developed designs. You must back 
up, check for viruses, and defragment your 
hard disk. Where do you start?

FIGURE 1.39 Backing 
up applications and data is 
an important part of main­
taining a viable computer 
system. You can guarantee 
that backups are performed 
on a regular schedule if you 
use the automatic backup 
feature in Windows 7.
System utilities
FIG URE 1.38 Some utilities run only when 
selected; others can be programmed to run on a 
regular schedule.
System  u tilities—also called util­
ity programs—are programs that work 
in tandem with the operating system and 
perform services that keep the computer 
system running smoothly. Sometimes 
these programs are included in the operat­
ing system; sometimes you must purchase 
them from other software vendors. They in­
clude programs that perform such tasks as:
• Backing up system and application files
• Providing antivirus protection
• Searching for and managing files
• Scanning and defragmenting disks 
and files
• Compressing files so that they take up 
less space on storage media
• Providing additional accessibility utili­
ties to meet the needs of individuals 
with special needs
You can access these utilities by 
opening the Start menu, selecting All 
Programs, selecting Accessories, and then 
from the Accessories submenu, selecting 
System Tools (Figure 1.38). Or, on the 
Start menu, click Control Panel, and then 
click System and Security.

computer’s hard disk to backup devices 
such as flash drives, CDs, DVDs, an 
external hard drive, or an online storage 
location. Using backup software is an es­
sential part of safe, efficient computer use. 
If your hard disk fails, you can recover 
your data from the backup disk you create 
with this utility (Figure 1.39).

Backup software can run a fu ll 
b a ck u p , which includes all files and 
data on the entire hard disk, or an in ­
crem en ta l backup. In an incremental 
backup, the backup software copies 
only those files that have been created 
or changed since the last backup 
occurred.
D rive im aging softw are goes beyond 
backups and creates a mirror image of the 
entire hard disk—including the operating 
system and applications, as well as all files 
and data. In the event of a hard disk or 
computer system failure, you can use the 
drive image to restore the entire system. 
Windows 7 provides a solid and simple 
drive imaging solution but lacks some fea­
tures of other independent programs. You 
will be asked to set the destination storage 
device— a hard drive, DVD, or a network 
drive. A brief wizard walks you through 
the necessary steps.
Concept 1.25 Using Antivirus 
Software
A n tiviru s softw are protects a computer 
from computer viruses. Such software 
uses a pattern-matching technique that 
examines all of the files on a disk looking 
for virus code signatures. One limitation of 
such programs is that they can detect only 
those viruses whose signatures are in their 
databases. If your system becomes infected 
by a virus that is not in the system’s da­
tabase, the virus may not be detected. Be­
cause of this shortcoming, many antivirus 
programs now include programs that mon­
itor system functions to detect abnormal 
behavior and stop the destructive activi­
ties of unknown viruses before they start. 
Microsoft Security Essentials is a free 
antivirus program that provides real-time 
protection against viruses, spyware, and 
other malicious software without slowing 
down your system.
Concept 1.26 Searching for 
and Managing Files
Another important system utility is the 
file m anager, a program that helps you 
organize and manage the data stored on 
your disk. The file manager enables you to 
perfoi-m operations on the files and folders 
created on your computer’s storage devices. 
For example, you can use a file manager to 
make copies of your files, manage how and 
where they are stored, and delete unwanted 
files. Operating systems usually come with
a file manager program. Windows 7 and 
Vista use Windows Explorer and Mac OS X 
uses Finder.
On a large hard disk with thousands 
of files, the task of finding a needed file 
can be time consuming and frustrating if 
you try to do it manually. For this reason, 
most operating systems include a search 
u tility , with which you can search an 
entire hard disk or any indexed network 
storage device for a file. In Microsoft 
Windows, search is integrated into every 
Windows Explorer window. Here you 
can query for files in a number of ways, 
including by name, date, and size. The 
Spotlight utility in the Mac OS performs 
similar tasks.
Concept 1.27 
Scanning and 
Defragmenting Disks
A disk scan n in g p ro g ra m , also known 
as an error checking program, can detect 
and resolve physical and logical problems 
that can occur when your computer 
stores files on a disk. The Mac OS X 
scanning utility is called Disk Utility.
One physical problem that a scanning 
program might detect involves an irregu­
larity on the disk’s surface that results 
in a bad secto r— a portion of the disk 
that is unable to store data reliably.
The scanning program marks and locks 
out the bad sector so that it is no longer 
usable.
A disk clean u p u tility  differs from 
a disk scanning program in that it does 
not correct any problems. Instead, it 
improves system performance and in­
creases storage space by removing files 
that you no longer need. Without your 
knowledge, some programs create tem­
porary files on the hard drive to perform 
actions that improve the performance of 
the program. These files are automati­
cally removed when the program is prop­
erly closed. A power outage can cause 
these files to remain on your hard drive 
and waste valuable storage space. A disk 
cleanup utility will search for and delete 
these unusable files along with any files 
in the Recycle Bin.
As you use your computer, it creates 
and erases files on the hard disk. The result 
is that the disk soon becomes a patchwork 
of files, with portions of files stored in differ­
ent places. This slows disk access because 
the system must look in several locations to 
find all of a file’s segments. A disk with data 
scattered around in this way is referred to

as being fragm ented. Disk defragm enta­
tion program s are utility programs that 
reorganize data on the disk so that file 
pieces are reassembled as one chunk of disk 
space, which decreases disk search time 
(Figure 1.40).
Concept 1.28 Using File 
Compression Utilities
Most downloadable software is com­
pressed. A file com pression u tility  
enables the exchange of programs and 
data efficiently by reducing the size of 
a file by as much as 80 percent without 
harming the data. Most file compres­
sion utilities work by searching the file 
for frequently repeated but lengthy data 
patterns and then substituting short 
codes for these patterns. Compression 
enables faster downloads, but you must 
decompress a file after downloading it. 
When the file is decompressed, the util­
ity restores the lengthier pattern where 
each short code is encountered. Both 
compressed and decompressed files can 
be saved and opened on a computer sys­
tem, but a file must be decompressed 
prior to use if changes that are made to 
that file are to be saved.
Most compression utilities also can 
create archives. An archive is a single file 
that contains two or more files stored in a 
compressed format along with additional 
information about each file— like the 
name and file lengths—so that proper
reconstruction is possible. Archives are 
convenient for storage as well as file- 
exchange purposes because as many as 
several hundred separate files can be 
stored in a single archive unit. To edit 
and save the changes to any file in the 
archived packet, you must first restore 
the packet to its original format.
To compress— also known as zip— a 
file or folder in Windows 7 or Vista, right- 
click it and choose Send to Compressed, 
also called zipped, folder. This action 
creates a new zipped file with the same 
file name. There are several ways to 
decompress, or unzip, a zipped file.
One way is to double-click the file and 
use the Extract all files button. Another 
way is to right-click the zipped file and 
click Extract All.
Concept 1.29 Using 
Accessibility Utilities
Accessibility utilities make computing 
easier for individuals with special needs. 
Windows 7 includes the following utili­
ties, which are accessible from the Control 
Panel in the Ease of Access category:
• Magnifier: Increases the size of a por­
tion of the screen to make reading 
easier for the visually impaired
• On-Screen Keyboard: A keyboard that 
displays on the screen that you can 
then use by clicking the mouse on 
desired keys

• Speech Recognition: A program with 
which you can use your voice to 
control your computer and dictate 
documents
• Narrator: A basic speech program that 
reads aloud everything on the screen
Concept 1.30 Performing a 
System Update
Microsoft provides an operating system 
update service called W indows U pdate 
that keeps your operating system up 
to date with fixes— also called service 
packs— and protections against external 
environment changes. If you are using 
Windows 7, you can ensure that your 
operating system is current by opening 
the Control Panel’s System and Security 
category, clicking Windows Update, and 
setting Windows Update to automatically 
download and install updates at a time of 
your choosing. You can also get more in­
formation at Microsoft’s Security at Home 
page at w w w .m icrosoft.com /p rotect.
Besides system utilities, there are ad­
ditional ways to safeguard your data or 
take care of operating problems.
Concept 1.31 
Troubleshooting 
a Computer
Everyone experiences computer problems 
once in a while. Review the following prob­
lems and possible causes that can help you 
solve many common problems:
• If your computer fails to start 
normally, you may be able to get it run­
ning by inserting a boot disk — also 
called an emergency disk. The boot disk 
is a storage device, like a U S B  drive, 
CD, DVD, or network device, which in 
case of an emergency or boot failure, 
can load a reduced version of the oper­
ating system for troubleshooting
purposes. Consult the documentation 
that came with your computer on how 
to create a boot disk.
• When you have finished using the 
computer, be sure to shut it down 
properly. Do not just switch off the 
power.
• In Microsoft Windows, you might en­
counter a configuration problem that 
typically arises after you add a new 
peripheral device such as an external 
hard drive or new printer to your sys­
tem. Such additions might cause con­
flicts that could interfere in the boot 
cycle. Conflicts can often be resolved 
by starting the computer in Windows 
safe m ode, an operating mode in 
which Windows loads a minimal set of 
drivers that are known to function cor­
rectly. Within safe mode, you can use 
the Control Panel to determine which 
devices are causing the problem. You 
access safe mode bv pressing the F8 
key repeatedly during the startup 
process— before the Windows screen 
with the logo displays. Safe mode will 
reset or report any conflicting pro­
grams or device drivers. After the 
reset is complete, shut down the sys­
tem, boot up normally, and then cor­
rect any conflicts that were not reset 
in safe mode (Figure 1.41).
It is exciting to purchase a new com­
puter. Understanding the processing cycle, 
the installed operating system, and utility 
programs will help you to keep it running 
smoothly. You will be able to maximize 
your systems capabilities, eliminate down 
time, and overall be more productive.

Chapter Summary
Computer History, Fundamentals, 
and Operating Systems
• A computer system is an electronic device along 
with a collection of related components that per­
form the information processing cycle: input, 
processing, output, and storage.
• A system includes both hardware— the physical 
components such as the system unit, keyboard, 
monitor, and speakers— and software—the 
programs that run on it.
• In a typical computer system, a keyboard and a 
mouse provide input capabilities. Processing is 
done by the microprocessor (C PU ) on programs 
and data held in RAM (random access memory). 
You see the output on a monitor or printer, and a 
hard disk is typically used for long-term storage.
• System software has two major components:
(1) the operating system and (2) system utilities. 
The operating system coordinates the functions 
of the computer’s hardware and provides support 
for running application software. System utilities 
provide such features as backup, defragmentation, 
and file compression.
• An operating system acts as an interface between 
you and the computer’s hardware. Its five basic 
functions are starting the computer, managing ap­
plications, managing memory, coordinating tasks, 
and providing a means of communicating with you.
• When you start or restart a computer, it reloads 
the operating system into the computer’s memory.
A computer goes through six steps at startup: loading 
the BIO S, performing the power-on self-test, loading 
the operating system, configuring the system, load­
ing system utilities, and authenticating users.
• The three major types of user interfaces are 
graphical user interfaces (GUIs), menu-driven user 
interfaces, and command line user interfaces.
• Operating systems fall into three categories: stand­
alone, server, and embedded. A standalone system 
does not need to be connected to any other system 
or computer to run. A server system, on the other 
hand, works in a network with other units and 
peripherals. Embedded operating systems are not 
designed for general purposes but rather for the 
specific conditions and actions of the device that 
they are embedded within.
• The major strength of Microsoft’s Windows operat­
ing system is that it has dominated the market 
for more than 15 years and is installed and main­
tained on approximately 90 percent of the personal 
computers in the world.
• Essential system utilities include backup software, 
antivirus software, a file manager, search tools, 
file compression utilities, disk scanning programs, 
disk defragmentation programs, and ease of access 
utilities for those with special needs. Additionally, 
features like Windows Update keep your operating 
system up to date with fixes— service packs— or 
protections against external environment changes. 
These features are also available for a Mac in the 
Mac OS X  Toolbox or the Utilities folder.

Most digital cameras store pictures on a 
CompactFlash memory csrd or a
Secure Digital ISO) card When you’ra ready to vmv, organize, or pnnt your pictures 
you'll need to import the pictures to your computer. Then you can erase the pictures 
on the memory card and use it to take a new batch of pictures.

There are two mam ways lo import pictures:
• Connect thr* u m m  directly. You can import pictures by connecting the 
camera directly to your computer using a universal teual bus (USB) cable 
With this method, your camera must be turned on, to importing pictures twill

Objective 1 | Create a New Folder and Save a File on
a Removable Storage Device
A program is a set of instructions that a computer uses to accomplish a task, such as word processing, 
accounting, or data management. A program is also referred to as an application.
Windows 7 is an operating system developed by Microsoft Corporation. An operating system is a computer 
program that manages all the other programs on your computer, stores files in an organized manner, allows you 
to use software programs, and coordinates the use of computer hardware such as the keyboard and mouse.
A file is a collection of information that is stored on a computer under a single name, for example, a text 
document, a picture, or a program. Every file is stored in a folder— a container in which you store files—or a 
subfolder, which is a folder within a folder. Windows 7 stores and organizes your files and folders, which is the 
primary task of an operating system.
| Variations in Screen Organization, Colors, and Functionality Arc Common in Windows 7
Individuals and organizations can determine how Windows 7 displays; thus, the colors and the organization of various elements on the screen 
can vary. The basic functions and structure of Windows 7 are not changed by such variations. You can be confident that the skills you will prac­
tice in this textbook apply to Windows 7 regardless of available functionality or differences between the pictures in the book and your screen.
Activity 2.01 
Turning On Your Computer, Logging On to a Windows 7 User Account, 
and Exploring the Windows 7 Environment
In this activity, you will turn on your computer and log on to Windows 7. If you are the only user of your own 
computer, you can disable the logon process if you want to do so. In most organizations, you will be required to 
log on in some manner.

N ote | Comparing Your Screen with the Figures in This Textbook
Your screen will more closely match the figures shown in this textbook if you set your screen resolution to 1024 x 768—this is optional. At other 
resolutions, your screen will closely resemble, but not match, the figures shown. To view your screen’s resolution, on the desktop, right-click in 
a blank area, click Screen resolution, and then click the Resolution arrow. To adjust the resolution, move the slider to the desired setting, and 
then click OK.
If necessary, turn on your computer and monitor.
The Windows 7 screen displays and indicates the names and pictures associated with all activc user accounts.
There are several editions of Windows 7. The editions you might see commonly in the United States arc Home 
Premium, Professional, Ultimate, and Enterprise. For the tasks you complete day to day, all of the functionality exists 
in all of these editions.
If there are two or more users on the computer you are using, point to your user account name to display a 
glow effect, and then click your user account name or its associated picture. If necessary, type your password 
in the Password box, and then click the circled arrow to the right of the Password box—or press (Enter).
__
N ote | Differing Logon Procedures and Passwords
Depending on whether you are working on your own computer, in a college lab, or in an organization, your logon process may differ. If you 
have a different logon screen, log on as directed and move to Step 3 of this activity. On your own computer, use your own user account name 
and password. If no passwords are set on your computer and you do not need to log on, you are ready to begin Step 3.

In the lower left corner of your screen, move the mouse pointer over— point to—the Start button 
and 
then click—press the left button on your mouse pointing device—to display the Start menu.
The mouse pointer is any symbol that displays on your screen in response to moving your mouse.
The Start menu has three parts: The large left pane displays a list of some installed programs, which might be customized 
by your computer manufacturer, and the All Programs button. The Search box enables you to look for programs and 
files on your computer by typing search words in the box. The right pane provides access to commonly used folders, tiles, 
settings, and features, and an area where you can log off from Windows or shut down (turn off) your computer.
Compare your screen with Figure 2.4 and take a moment to study the parts of the Start menu described in the 
table in Figure 2.5.
In Figure 2.4, portions of the Start menu are transparent; for example, you can see parts of the desktop design behind 
the right pane of the Start menu. If your version of Windows 7 has this capability and it is enabled, and if your 
computer system’s graphics hardware supports transparency, you might also notice this transparent effect.

Objective 3 | Display Libraries, Folders, and Files in a Window
A file is the fundamental unit of storage that enables Windows 7 to distinguish one set of information from 
another.
A folder is the basic organizing tool for files. In a folder, you can store files that are related to one another. 
You can also put a folder inside of another folder, which is referred to as a subfolder. You can create any number 
of subfolders, and each can hold any number of liles and additional subfolders. Windows 7 arranges folders in a 
structure that resembles a hierarchy—an arrangement where items are ranked and where each level is lower in 
rank than the item above it. In this manner, a hierarchy gives a visual representation of related files and folders. 
The hierarchy of folders is referred to as the folder structure. A sequence of folders in the folder structure that 
leads to a specific file or folder is a path.
A library is a collection of items, such as files and folders, assembled from various locations; the locations 
might be on your computer, on an external hard drive connected to your computer, or on another computer in
Project 2A: Using Windows 7 | G O ! A ll In  One

your network. A library provides a single access point from which you can open folders and files from different 
locations.
Activity 2.05 
Displaying Libraries, Folders, and Files in a Folder Window
When you open a tolder or library, a folder window displays. The folder window is the one feature you will 
use most often in Windows 7. A lolder window shows you the contents of a folder or library. The design of 
the folder window helps you navigate— explore within the folder structure for the purpose of finding files and 
folders— Windows 7 so that you can save and locate your files and folders efficiently. In this activity, you will open 
a folder window and examine its parts.
1 
On the taskbar, click the Windows Explorer button ^ \J to display the Libraries window.
Windows Explorer is the program within Windows 7 that displays the contents of libraries, folders, and files on 
your computer, and also enables you to perform tasks related to your files and folders such as copying, moving, 
and renaming.
2 
In the right portion of the window, under the text Open a library to see your files anil arrange them by folder, 
date, and other properties, double-click Documents. Compare your screen with Figure 2.19, and then take a 
moment to study the parts of the window as described in the table in Figure 2.20.
The window for the Documents library displays.

Parts of the Documents Library Window 
j
Window Part
Function
Address bar
Displays your current location in the file structure as a series of links separated by arrows.
Back and Forward buttons
Provide the ability to navigate to other folders you have already opened without closing the 
current folder window. These buttons work with the address bar; that is, after you use the 
address bar to change folders, you can use the Back button to return to the previous folder.
Column headings
Identify the columns. By clicking on the column heading, you can change how the files in the 
file list are organized; by clicking on the arrow on the right, you can sort items in the file list.
File list
Displays the contents of the current folder or library. If you type text into the Search box, only 
the folders and files that match your search will display here—including files in subfolders.
Library pane
Enables you to customize the library or arrange files by different file properties—information 
about the files, such as the author, the date the file was last changed, and any descriptive tags 
(a property that you create to help you find and organize your files) you might have added to 
the file. This pane displays only when you are in a library, such as the Documents library.
Navigation pane
Displays Favorites, Libraries, a Homegroup if you have one, and an expandable list of drives 
and folders in an area on the left side of a folder window. Use Favorites to open your most 
commonly used folders and searches; use Libraries to access your libraries. If you have a folder 
that you use frequently, you can drag it to the Favorites area so that it is always available.
Preview pane button
Opens an additional pane on the right side of the file list to display a preview of a file (not a 
folder) that you select in the file list.
Search box
Enables you to type a word or phrase and then searches for a file or subfolder stored in the 
current folder that contains matching text. The search begins as soon as you begin typing, so 
for example, if you type G, all the files that start with the letter G will display in the file list.
Toolbar
Provides buttons with which you can perform common tasks, such as changing the 
appearance of your files and folders, copying files to a CD, or starting a digital picture slide 
show. The buttons change in context with the type of file selected; for example, if a picture file 
is selected, different buttons display than if a music file is selected.
Figure 2.20
Move your fbl pointer anywhere into the navigation pane, and notice that a black arrow 
displays to the left 
o(Favorites, Libraries, and Computer, to indicate that these items are expanded, and a white arrow [M  displays 
to the right of items that are collapsed (hidden).
You can click these arrows to collapse and expand areas in the navigation pane.
In the navigation pane, under Computer, click your USB device one time to display its contents in the file list. 
Double-click the go_aio_student _data_files folder, and then compare your screen with Figure 2.21.

Objective 4 | Start Programs and Open Data Files
W hen you use the software programs installed on your computer, you create and save files— the documents, 
worksheets, databases, songs, pictures, and so on that you need for your job or personal use. Thus, most of your 
work with Windows 7 is concerned with locating and starting your programs and locating and opening your files.
Project 2A: Using Windows 7 | G O ! A ll In O ne

You can open your data files from within the program in which they were created, or you can open a data file 
from a tolder window, which will simultaneously start the program and open your file.
Activity 2.07 
Starting Programs and Opening Data Files
One way to start a program is from one of the three areas of the Start menu: the upper left, which displays the 
programs you have pinned there for easy access; the bottom left, which displays programs that you have recently 
used; or the All Programs list.
1 
Be sure the flash drive containing the student data files is inserted in your computer. From the Start 
menu 
point to All Programs, locate and click the Accessories folder, and then on the displayed list, 
click Paint. Compare your screen with Figure 2.25.
Paint is a program that comes with Windows 7 with which you can create and edit drawings and display and edit 
stored photos. Recall that All Programs lists all of the programs available on your computer. If your list of programs 
is larger than the window, a scroll bar displays so that you can scroll the list. Names that display a file folder icon to 
the left will open to display the programs within the folder.

| If  you are working on a computer that is not your own, for example in a college lab, plan your time 
to complete Project 213 in one working session.
Because you will need to store and then delete files on the hard disk drive of the computer at which you are working, it is recommended that you 
complete this project in one working session—unless you are working on your own computer or you know tluit the files will be retained. In your 
college lab, it is possible that files you store will not be retained after you log off. Allow approximately 45 to 60 minutes to complete Project 2B.
Objective 6 | Copy Files from a Removable Storage Device 
to the Hard Disk Drive
Data on a computer network can be accessed by employees at any of the hotel locations through the use 
of sharing technologies. For example, SharePoint is a Microsoft technology that enables employees in an 
organization to access information across organizational and geographic boundaries.
Activity 2.12 
Copying Files from a Removable Storage Device to the Documents Library 
on the Hard Disk Drive
In this activity, you will copy the data files from your USB drive to the Documents library.
1 
Be sure the U SB drive where you have stored your student data files is inserted. On the taskbar, click the 
Windows Explorer button 
to display the Libraries window.

Chapter

Objective 7 | Navigate by Using Windows Explorer
Managing your data—the files and the folders that contain your files— is the single most useful computing 
skill you can acquire. Become familiar with two important features in Windows 7 if you want to manage your data 
easily and efficiently—the Windows Explorer program and the folder window. Recall that a folder window shows 
you the contents of a folder.
Activity 2.13 
Pinning a Location to a Jump List
Navigation refers to the actions you perform when you display a window to locate a command, or when you 
display the folder window lor a folder whose contents you want to view. In this activity, you will practice various 
ways in which you can navigate by using Windows Explorer.
On the taskbar, click the Windows Explorer button ^ . In the file list, double-click Documents to display the 
contents of the Documents library in the file list.
In the file list, point to the Bell_Orchid folder, hold down the left mouse button, and then as shown in 
l-igure 2.34, drag the selected folder down to the Windows Explorer button i 
until the ScreenTip Pin to 
Windows Explorer displays. Release the mouse button.

4  
Click anywhere on the desktop to close the Jump List, and then Close S
I  the Documents window.
5 
On the taskbar, right-click the Windows Explorer button1 
I to display the Jump List. From the 1’inned area, 
click BeIl_Orchid.
Use the taskbar—rather than the Start menu—as often as you can to start programs and navigate to specific files 
and folders. Doing so will increase your efficiency, because it eliminates extra clicks that are necessary to display 
the Start menu.
Activity 2.14 
Navigating by Using the Address Bar
A primary function of your operating system is to store and keep track of your files. A file folder on a disk in 
which you store files is referred to as a directory. The location of any file can be described by its path. Recall that a 
path is a sequence of folders— directories— that leads to a specific file or folder.
1 
In the address bar, click the location icon one time, and then compare your screen with Figure 2.36.
The path that describes the folder’s location displays and is highlighted. The path begins with the disk, which is 
indicated by C:—the main hard disk drive of your computer.
Following the disk is the sequence of subfolders, each separated by a backslash (\). On the C: hard disk drive, the 
folder Users contains your personal folder. Your personal folder contains the Documents library, which contains the 
BelljOrchid folder that you copied there.
Figure 2.36

Path describes folder's 
location (your path 
may differ)
2 Click in a blank area of the file list to cancel the display of the path.
3  
In the navigation pane, under Computer, click your C: hard disk drive. In the address bar, notice the hard disk 
drive icon that displays as the location icon— a small Windows logo may display there. In the navigation pane, 
click your USB flash drive, and notice the location icon.
The location icon changes to depict the location being accessed.
On the address bar, click the Back button [fa two times or as many times as necessary to redisplay the 
Bell_Orchid folder window.
Recall that the Forward and Back buttons enable you to navigate to locations you have already visited. In a manner 
similar to when you are browsing the Web, the locations you have visited are stored in a location history, and you 
can browse that location history by clicking the Back and Forward buttons.
To the immediate right of the Forward button, locate and click the Recent Pages button Q. Compare your 
screen with Figure 2.37.
The Rccent Pages button displays a list of recently accessed locations, and the current location is indicated by a 
check mark. By clicking an item on this list, you can move to a recently accessed location quickly. The list is limited 
to the current session; thus, only locations you have accessed since starting Windows Explorer display on the list.

N ote | Different W ays to Navigate Your Computer
There is no corrcct way to navigate your computer. You can use any combination of techniques in the navigation pane, the address bar, and in 
the file list of a folder window to display the location you want.
v------------------------------------------------------ ---- -------------------------- ;_________________)
Objective 8 I Create, Name, and Save Files
In many programs, for example in Paint and the programs in Microsoft Office, the program opens and 
displays a new unnamed and unsaved file. As you begin creating your file in the program, your work is 
temporarily stored in the computer’s memory until you initiate a Save command, at which time you must choose 
a file name and a location that is reachable from your computer in which to save your file.
For saving files or opening existing files, Windows-based programs use a set of common dialog boxes. These 
are dialog boxes provided by the Windows programming interface that enable programs to have a consistent 
appearance and behavior. This means that in such dialog boxes, you will find navigation tools that are essentially 
the same as those in a Windows 7 folder window.
Activity 2.15 
Pinning a Program to the Taskbar
For programs that you use frequently, it is useful to pin the program to the taskbar. The more you perform 
tasks from the taskbar, the more efficient you will become. Performing tasks from the taskbar reduces the number 
of times you must display the Start menu.
1 
From the Start menu 
locate the Microsoft Word program on your system; the program might already 
be displayed on your Start menu, or you might need to locate it by displaying the All Programs menu and 
opening the Microsoft Office folder.
2  
Point to the program name, and then as shown in Figure 2.38, drag the program to the taskbar. Release the 
mouse button when the ScreenTip Pin to Taskbar displays. (If the W ord program is already pinned to the 
taskbar on your system, skip this step.)
For programs you use frequently, pin them to the taskbar in this manner.

Using the technique you just practiced, pin the Excel program to the taskbar, and then click anywhere on the 
desktop to close the Start menu. Compare your screen with Figure 2.39

Activity 2.16 
Naming and Saving Files in Word
In this activity, you will create a W ord file to be stored in an existing folder.
1 
On the taskbar, click the Word icon H3 to start the program. If necessary, on the Home tab, in the Paragraph 
group, click the Show/Hide button I ^ I to display formatting marks. Then, on the View tab, in the Show group, 
be sure the Ruler check box is selected. Compare your screen with Figure 2.40.

Across the top of your keyboard, locate the function keys numbered F I to FI 2, and then press [F12I to display 
the Save As dialog box. Compare your screen with Figure 2.41.
In the Microsoft Office programs, IF121 displays the Save As dialog box. The Save As dialog box is an example of a 
common dialog box; that is, this dialog box looks the same in Excel and in PowerPoint and in most other Windows- 
based programs. In the Save As dialog box, you must indicate the name you want for the file and the location where 
you want to save the file.

In the Save as type box, notice that the default file type is a Word Document. In the File name box, notice that 
W ord selects the first characters of the document as the default name.
Recall that many programs use the Documents library as the default storage location; however, you can navigate to 
other storage locations from this dialog box.
5 
Be sure the text in the File name box is selected— highlighted in blue; if it is not, click one time with your 
mouse to select it. Type Europe Project as the File name. Then in the lower right corner of the dialog box, 
click Save to save the file in the Documents folder.
The Word document is saved and the file name displays in the title bar of the Word window.
6 
Close ll^3wll the W ord window.
More Knowledge | Rules for Naming Files
Consider these rules when naming files:
• File names usually cannot be longer than 255 characters.
• You cannot use any of the following characters in a (lie name: \ / ? : * “ >< |
• File names must be unique in a folder; that is, two tiles of the same type—for example two Excel liles—cannot have the exact same name. 
Likewise, two subfolders within a folder cannot have the exact same name.

Objective 9 | Create Folders and Rename Folders and Files
As you crcate tiles, you will also want to create folders so that you can organize your files into a logical folder 
structure. It is common to rename files and folders so that the names reflect the content.
Activity 2.17 
Creating Folders and Renaming Folders and Files
In this activity, you will create, name, and rename folders to begin a logical structure of folders in which to 
organize the files related to the European hotels project.
1 
On the taskbar, right-click the Windows Explorer button | j J  to display the Jump List, and then under Pinned, 
click Bell Orchid.
2 
In the address bar, to the right of Bell_Orchid, click ►, and then on the list click Corporate. To the right of 
Corporate, click ►, and then click Information_Tcchnology. To the right of Information_Technology, click ►, 
and then click Future_Hotels.
Some computer users prefer to navigate a folder structure using the address bar in this manner. Use whichever 
method you prefer.
3 
Be sure the items are in alphabetical order by Name. At the right end of the toolbar, click the View button 
arrow I & ’ [ and if necessary, set the view to Details.
This view is useful when you are organizing files and folders.
N ote | Date Modified and Other Details May Vary
The Date modified and some other details shown in the figures may differ from what displays on your screen.
4 
On the toolbar, click the New folder button. With the text New folder selected, type Paris and press [Enter]. Click 
the New folder button again, and then type Venice and press (Enter]. Compare your screen with Figure 2.42.
Notice how the folders automatically move into alphabetical order. Notice also that when you have both files and 
folders in a folder, the folders are listed first.The default organization of a file list in Windows 7 is to list folders first, 
in alphabetical order, and then files in alphabetical order.
Figure 2.42
New folders

Objective 10 | Select, Copy, and Move Files and Folders
To select is to highlight, by clicking or dragging with the mouse, one or more file or folder names in the file 
list. Selecting in this manner is commonly done for the purpose of copying, moving, renaming, or deleting the 
selected files or folders.
Activity 2.18 
Selecting Groups of Files or Folders in the File List
The techniques you will practice in this activity apply not only to Windows 7, but also to lists of files that 
display in other applications.
1 
W ith the Future_Hotels folder open, in the file list, click the W ord file Architect_Search one time to select it. 
W ith the file name selected, hold down (Shift), and then click the Excel file Financials, Rome. Compare your 
screen with Figure 2.43.
This technique, commonly referred to as Shift Click, selects a consecutive group of files or folders. To select all 
the items in a consecutive group, you need only to click the first item, hold down [Shift), and then click the last item 
in the group.

Copying Files
When you copy a file or a folder, you make a duplicate of the original item and then store the duplicate in 
another location. In this activity, you make copies of the Staffmg_Plan file, and then placing a copy in each of the 
two folders you created— Paris and Rome.
1 
With the Future_HoteIs folder open, in the file list, point to the file Staffing_Plan and right-click. On the 
displayed menu, click Copy.
The Copy command places a copy of your selected file or folder on the Clipboard where it will he stored until you 
replace it with another Copy command. The Clipboard is a temporary storage area for information that you have 
copied or moved from one place and plan to use somewhere else. In Windows 7, the Clipboard can hold only one 
piece of information at a time. Whenever something is copied to the Clipboard, it replaces whatever was there 
before.
2 
At the top ot the file list, point to the Paris folder, right-click, and then click Paste. Then double-click 
the Paris tolder to open it. Notice that the copy ot the Staffing Plan file displays. Compare your screen

More Knowledge | Copy and Move Files by Using Two Windows
To copy or move files using two windows, open two instances of Windows Kxplorer, and then use the Snap feature to display both instances 
on your screen. Then use drag and drop; use copy (or cut) and paste commands to copy or move files or folders into a different level of a folder 
structure, or to a different drive location.
Activity 2.21 
Copying Files to a Compressed Folder
To compress is to reduce the size of a file. Compressed files take up less storage space and can be transferred 
to other computers, for example in an e-mail message, more quickly than uncompressed files. Because pictures are 
typically large files, it is common to compress graphic files like pictures. When the picture is expanded, there will 
be no loss of visual quality.

Project 2C: Browsing the Web with Internet Explorer 8 | G O ! A ll In One

Objective 11 | Search the Internet
The Internet can connect you to a vast amount of information, but first you have to find the information 
that you need. From within Internet Explorer, there are two ways in which you can search for information on the 
fnternet without navigating to a specific Web site. The easiest method is to type a search term in the Search box in 
the upper right corner of the Internet Explorer screen. A search term is a word or phrase that describes the topic 
about which you want to find information. You can also type a search term directly in the Address bar.
Activity 2.22 
Searching the Internet
A search provider is a W eb site that provides search capabilities on the web. The default search provider in 
Internet Explorer is Microsoft’s Bing.
1 
On the taskbar, click the Internet Explorer button 1W |. if a Welcome screen displays, close it. In the upper 
right corner, locate the Search box, and then at the right end of the box, click the Search arrow ▼. Compare 
your screen with Figure 2.49.

Note | If Bing Is Not Your Default
It Bing is not the default, sel it as the default lor this project as follows: On the displayed menu, click Find More Providers, and then click Bing 
Search. Click Click lo Install, and then click Add. Then, click the search arrow, click Manage Search Providers, click Bing, and then in the lower 
right corner, click Set as default. Click the Close button.
2 
With Bing set as your default search provider, click in a blank area of the screen to close the Search menu, and 
then click in the Search box.
3  Type the following, including the quotation marks: “carpet safety” and then press (Enter). In the list of results, 
notice that your exact term carpet safety displays in bold.
Bing displays the search results, and on the right, displays sponsored links—paid advertisements shown as a links, 
typically for products and services related to your search term. Sponsored links are ihe way that search sites like 
Bing, Google, and others earn revenue. On the left, related searches are suggested.
Use quotation marks to search for specific phrases. Surrounding terms with quotation marks limits the search results 
to only those Web pages that contain the exact phrase that you typed. Without the quotation marks, the search 
results will include any page that contains the terms that you typed, regardless of the order of the words.
4 Open a New Tab I LT I, in the Address bar type epa carpet safety and then press (Enter).
When you type a search term directly in the Address bar, Internet Explorer tries to find a URL that matches; if it 
cannot do so, the default search provider conducts the search.
5 Start 
the Snipping Tool program and create a Full-screen Snip. Save the snip in your All In One Chapter 2 
folder as a JPEG file with the name Lastname_Firstname_2C Searches Snip Close O
 the SnippingTool
mark-up window. Hold this file until you complete Project 2C, and then submit it as directed by your instructor.

Close E 3  Internet Explorer.
Objective 12 | Use Tabbed Browsing
A Web browser is a software program that you use to display Web pages and navigate the Internet.
Internet Explorer 8 is the W eb browser software developed by Microsoft Corporation and that is included with 
Windows 7. Browsing is the term used to describe the process of using your computer to view Web pages. Surfing
72 
G O ! All In One | Chapter 2: Use Windows 7 to Manage Files and Programs and to Browse the Internet

refers to the process of navigating the Internet either for a particular item or for anything that is of interest, and 
quickly moving from one item to another.
Activity 2.23 
Using Tabbed Browsing
Tubbed browsing is a feature in Internet Explorer that enables you to open multiple Web sites in a single 
browser window. You open each new Web page in a new tab, and then switch among your open W eb pages by 
clicking the tab that displays in the upper portion of the screen. The advantage to using tabbed browsing is that 
you have fewer items open on the taskbar. In this activity, you will conduct research on the new hotel in Miam i.
1 
On the taskbar, click the Internet Explorer button 
I
The home page that is set on your computer displays. On your computer, home page refers to whatever Web page 
you have selected—or is set by default—to display on your computer when you start Internet Explorer. When 
visiting a Web site, home page refers to the starting point for the remainder of the pages on that site.
2  
At the top of your screen, click in the address bar to select (highlight) the current Web address, and then, type 
www.usa.gov and then press Enter. Notice the U R L in the address bar. and then compare your screen with 
Figure 2.50.
The Web site for the United States Government displays. By typing in the address bar, the new URL opens and the 
original URL—whatever your home page site was—closes.
A URL contains the protocol prefix—in this instance http—which stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP 
represents the set of communication rules used by your computer to connect to servers on the Web. Internet 
Explorer defaults to the http prefix, so it is not necessary to type it, even though it is part of the URL for this site.The 
protocol prefix is followed by a colon and the separators //. A URL also contains the domain name— in this instance 
www.usa.gov. A domain name is an organization’s unique name on the Internet, and consists of a chosen name 
combined with a top level domain such as .com or .org or .gov.
Figure 2.50

A leii | W eb Sites Update Content Frequently
As you progress through the projects in this chapter, the pictures of various Web sites in this textbook may not match your screens exactly, 
because Web site administrators frequently update content. This will not affect your ability to complete the projects successfully.
3  Click in the address bar to select the U R L text, and then type osha.gov/SLTC/lead and press (Enter).
The acronym www, which stands for World Wide Web, is used for uniformity on the Web. You can usually omit 
typing www and its following dot, because most Web servers are configured to handle a URL with or without it. If a 
Web page does not display without typing www, retype the URL and include www.
4 
Click the New Tab button [ 3  one time. Compare your screen with Figure 2.51, and then take a moment to 
study the parts of the Internet Explorer window in the table in Figure 2.52.
The screen for a new tab displays, and in the address bar, about.Tabs is selected. This What do you want to do next? 
page will display a list of sites that you have opened and then closed during this session, which is useful if you have 
closed a browser window by mistake and want to go back to it.

Activity 2.24 
Using the Tab List, Quick Tabs, and Shortcuts 
to Navigate Among Open Tabs
When you have multiple Web pages open at once, each one is displayed on a separate tab. When many Web 
pages are open and the width of each tab is decreased, it may become difficult to determine which tab represents a 
specific site. In this activity, you will practice various ways to navigate the open tabs to find the one you want easily.

On the left end of the tab row, click the Tab List button 0, and then compare your screen with Figure 2.54.
The Tab List displays. When multiple tabs are open, the Web site name on each tab is truncated—cut short. By 
clicking the Tab List button, you can see a list of all open Web sites, in the order they were opened, and you can see 
the complete name of each Web site that is open on a tab. Additionally, the highlighted section indicates tabs that 
are visible on the tab row—tabs outside of the highlighted area. From this list, you can click a site to move to another 
tab, regardless of whether the tab is visible on the tab row.

The Favorites Center is a list of links to Web sites that is saved in your Web browser. Saving a W eb site as a 
favorite allows you to return to it quickly. Returning to the site requires only one or two clicks instead of typing 
a complete URL. You can create a folder to organize your favorite links into groups that are meaningful to you. 
Then, you can either open one site from the folder, or open all the sites in the folder with a single click.

channels one can have with customers. Blogs represent your voice that tells the world what you do. On a blog, you 
share your ideas and explain how you solve real problems for real customers.

Objective 1 | Create an Outlook Account
Microsoft Outlook 2010 has two functions: it is an e-mail program, and it is a personal 
information manager that enables you to store information about your contacts, your 
View 
video on the 
daily schedule, your tasks to complete, and other information that you need to access.

or in MylTLab
| Starting Project 3A
Because Outlook stores information on the hard drive of the computer at which you are working, it is recommended that you schedule enough 
time to complete Activities 3.01-3.09 in one working session, unless you are working on a computer that is used only by you. Allow approxi­
mately one hour for these activities.
Activity 3.01 
Creating a User Account in Windows 7
A user account is a collection of information that tells Windows 7 what files and folders the account holder 
can access, what changes the account holder can make to the computer system, and what the account holder’s 
personal preferences are. Each person accesses his or her user account with a user name and, if desired, a 
password, to access his or her own desktop, files, and folders.
| To Protect Your Existing Outlook Information, Create a New Windows 7 Account.
It is recommended that you create your own Windows 7 user account so that your screens will match the figures in the textbook and so that you 
do not delete personal Outlook information that you already have on your own computer.
Some Windows 7 features are available only to users who are logged on with an administrator account; for example, only an administrator can 
add new user accounts or delete user accounts. If you are logged on with administrator rights, you can complete the steps in this activity. If you 
are in a classroom or computer lab, check with your instructor for permission lo create an account.
1 
From the Start menu 
display Control Panel, and then under User Accounts and Family Safety (or User 
Accounts), click Add or remove user accounts—enter the password if prompted.
2 In the lower portion of the screen, click Create a new account.
The Create New Account window displays. T he default user account type is a Standard user, as indicated by the 
selected option button. Once created, the new user account name will display on the Windows 7 welcome screen and 
in the Start menu when this account holder is logged on.
3 In the New account name box, using your own first and last names, type Firstname Lastname (or a variation of 
your name if this is your own computer and you have already used your own name as the primary user) and 
then compare your screen with Figure 3.2.

4 ("lick the Create Account button, and then Close ll^Ml the Manage Accounts window to create the new account.
5  On the Start menu (0, point to the Shut down arrow, and then compare your screen with Figure 3.3.
Figure
Shut down menu

6 
Click Switch user. When the Welcome screen displays, click the new account that you just created, and then 
wait a few moments until Windows 7 prepares your new desktop.
Activity 3.02 
Creating an Outlook Account and Exploring the Outlook Window
Outlook uses an e-mail profile to identify which e-mail account you use and where the related data is stored. 
When initially configured, Outlook creates a single profile. You might choose to create separate profiles to keep 
your work data and personal information separate.
1 
On the Windows taskbar, click the Start button ©  to display the Start menu. Locate and open the program 
Microsoft Outlook 2010.
The Microsoft Outlook 2010 Startup Wizard displays to configure Outlook 2010 in your new user name account. 
Ak-rt | Did Microsoft Outlook Open without Displaying the Startup Wizard?
If Microsoft Outlook was previously configured on your system or if you were unable to create the user account in Activity 3.01, Outlook will 
open without displaying the Startup Wizard. To create the user account, click the File tab to display Backstage view, and then on the Info tab, 
under Account Information, click Add Account to open the Add New Account dialog box. Then, continue with Steps 3 through 9.
2 In the Microsoft Outlook 2010 Startup dialog box, click Next two times.
The Add New Account dialog box displays for you to create an e-mail account to complete the activities in this chapter.
3 In the Add New Account dialog box, in the Your Name box, using your own name, type Firstname Lastname. In 
the E-mail Address box, type Firstname Lastname@GOMAIL.com
4 In the lower left corner, click the Manually configure server settings or additional server types option button, 
and then compare your screen with Figure 3.4.

G O ! All In One | Chapter 3: Communicating and Networking with Outlook, Skype, Linkedln, and Squarespace

5 Click Next two times. If necessary, set the Account Type to POP3. In the Incoming mail server box, type
GOMAIL.com and in the Outgoing mail server (SMTP) box, type PHMAIL.com Under Logon Information, in the 
User Name box, type your Firstname Lastname and in the Password box, type 123456
Note | GOMAIL.com and PHMAIL.com Are Fictitious Domains.
GOMAlL.com and IM IMAIL.com arc fictitious domains used only for this activity.
6 In the right column, click to clear the check box to the left of Test Account Settings by clicking the Next button. 
Click Next. In the screen indicating Congratulations! click Finish to return to Outlook.
7 Click OK to close the User Name dialog box. If a Microsoft Hotmail Connector dialog box displays, click No.
If the Welcome to Microsoft Office 2010 dialog box displays, click Use Recommended Settings, and then click 
OK. If a User Account Control dialog box displays, click Yes—or type your admin password and click Yes.
Outlook configures your account, and the Outlook window displays.
8  Compare your screen with Figure 3.5, and then take a moment to study the description of the screen elements 
in the table in Figure 3.6.
Your Outlook screen might differ from the one shown in Figure 3.5. The appearance of the opening screen depends 
on settings that were established when Outlook was installed on the computer you are using. A Send/Receive error 
may display at the bottom of your Outlook window as a result of the fictitious e-mail address used.

Objective 3 | Send and Receive E-Mail
To send an e-mail message, you must know the recipient’s e-mail address. There 
are two parts to an e-mail address, with each part separated by @—known as the at sign.
The first part is the user name of the recipient. The second part of the e-mail address is 
the domain name. A domain name is the host name of the recipient’s mail server. For 
example, if the mail server is MSN Hotmail, the domain is hotniail.com.
Activity 3.06 
Configuring Outlook for Sending and Receiving Messages
If your computer is connected and online—connected to your organization’s network or to the Internet— 
Outlook’s default setting is to send messages immediately when you click the Send button in the Message form. 
Copies of sent messages are then stored in the Sent Items folder. If you are offline—not connected to a network or 
to the Internet—messages are stored in the Outbox.
View the video on the 
Companion Web Site 
or in MylTLab
\ In This Activity, You Will Configure Outlook to Store Sent Messages in the Outbox Instead of 
Actually Sending the Messages.
In this activity, you will configure Outlook to store all your sent messages in the Outbox instead of actually sending the messages from your 
GOMAIL account. You will be handling the e-mail activities of Lucy Burrows. You can create and send her messages even if your computer is 
not actually connected and online.

| Does your Ribbon look different?
The size of the Outlook window determines how much information displays with each command on the Ribbon. Depending on your screen 
size and resolution, you might notice both icons and words for all commands or only the icons for certain commands.
3 
In the To box, type LDennison@LanceConst.com
This is the e-mail address of the recipient. Notice the syntax—the way in which the parts of the e-mail address are 
put together. The user name is to the left of the @ symbol, and the domain name is on the right. If another student 
has used this computer, you may see Mr. Dennison’s e-mail address display in blue.
4  In the Cc box, click to place the insertion point, and then type STarasov@MidNYChamber.org
This sends a courtesy copy, or carbon copy, of the message to the address specified in the Cc box. In both the To and 
the Cc boxes, you can enter multiple addresses, separating each address with a semicolon. Send a courtesy copy to 
others who need to see the message.
Project 3A: Client Communication | G O ! A ll III One 
103

More Knowledge | Carbon Copies
Old-fashioned carbon paper is rarely used anymore, but the term carbon copy lias remained. Sometimes Cc is referred to as a courtesy copy. 
Sometimes people will just say “I cc’d (pronounced see-seed) you on an e-mail.”
5  Press (Jab] one time to position the insertion point in the Subject box, type Chamber of Commerce presentation 
and then press [Tabl.
You can move the insertion point from one box to another either by clicking in the box or by pressing [Tab!
Note | Underlined E-mail Addresses
Outlook may display an underlined e-mail address alter you type it in the box. Outlook remembers previously typed addresses, and this change 
in its appearance shows that this address has been used before, either by you or a previous user. Your system may also be set to automatically 
underline all e-mail addresses that use correct syntax.
6 With the insertion point in the message area of the Message form, type Lance, and then press (Enter) two times.
This is the beginning of your message. It is considered good etiquette to address the recipient(s) by name. Keep your 
messages short and to the point. It is usually helpful to the recipient if you restrict your message to only one topic.
7 Type I just received confirmation from the Chamber of Commerce; they would like to have us speak at one of 
their upcoming meetings. Let’s arrange a time for you, Sandra, and me to meet and discuss which meeting is 
best and select a topic.
As you type, the insertion point moves left to right. When it reaches the right margin, Outlook determines whether 
the next word will tit within the established margin. If the word does not fit, the insertion point moves the whole 
word down to the next line. This feature is called wordwrap.
8 Press |Enter| two times and type Please check your schedule for next week so we can finalize the plans quickly.
To leave a single blank line between paragraphs, press |Enter| two times. Keep paragraphs short and single-spaced with 
a double-space between them. Do not indent the first line of paragraphs, and press (Spacebar) only one time following 
the punctuation at the end of a sentence.
Press (Enter] two times, type Lucy and then click somewhere in the text of the message. Review the message to 
check for errors, and then compare your screen with Figure 3.22.
Always double-check the addresses of your recipients to avoid either the return of the message or delivery to the 
wrong person. Edit and proofread your messages carefully. Messages containing errors reflect poorly on you, the 
sender.

Your lines of text may 
wrap differently

More Knowledge | Sending a Message without a Subject
Outlook displays a message box if you do not enter a Subject for an e-mail message before clicking Send. The message box allows you to go 
back to the e-mail form and enter a subject or send the messages without one. A subject makes it easier for people who receive your messages to 
quickly know the contents. It is a good idea to include a brief, meaningful subject for your messages.
11 In the Navigation Pane under your account, locate and then click the Outbox folder. Compare your screen 
with Figure 3.23.
The contents of the Outbox folder display. When the Outbox folder contains unsent messages, the folder name is 
displayed in bold followed by the number of items in brackets.

Activity 3.08 
Opening and Responding to an E-mail Message
Messages you receive are stored in Outlook's Inbox folder. Each message displays the name of the message 
sender, the subject, and the date and time sent. You can respond to a received message by either replying to the 
message or forwarding the message to another individual. In this activity, you will work with messages that are in 
your Inbox. You will also work with different types of received messages.
1 
In the Navigation Pane, under your account, click Inbox, and take a moment to study the messages shown in 
Figure 3.24.
In the Navigation Pane, the number in parentheses to the right of Inbox displays the number of unread messages. 
The Inbox pane lists the message header for each message. Message headers include basic information about an 
e-mail message such as the sender’s name, the date sent, and the subject. The message header for an e-mail that has 
not yet been read or opened displays in bold, and the icon al the left shows a closed envelope. After a message has 
been read, the bold is removed, and the icon changes to an open envelope.

More Knowledge | Forwarding E-Mail Messages
You can forward an e-mail message you receive to someone else—commonly referred to as a third party. This is called forwarding. However, do 
not forward messages to others unless you are sure the sender of the original message would approve of forwarding the message. On the Home 
tab, in the Respond group, click the Forward button. You do not have to open a message to forward it. A Message form displays. Outlook adds 
the prefix FW: to the subject and title of the message. The text of the original message is included in the message area of the form.

Activity 3.09 
Printing and Deleting Messages
Recall that Outlook organizes its information in folders. To print information in Outlook, each folder type has 
one or more predefined print styles associated with it. A print style is a combination of paper and page settings 
that determines the way items print.
After you read and reply to a message, it is good practice to either delete it or store it in another folder for 
future reference. When you delete a message in your Inbox folder, Outbox folder, or any other mail folder, it is 
placed in the Deleted Items folder. Items remain in this folder until you empty them from this folder, at which 
time they are permanently deleted. This is helpful in case you delete a message by mistake; you can still retrieve it 
from the Deleted Items folder until that folder is emptied. In this activity, you will print Lucy’s Outbox and one of 
her sent messages before deleting the Inbox messages.
1 
It necessary, in the Navigation Pane, click Outbox to display the Outbox folder. Click the first message in the
Outbox one time to select it.
2  From Backstage view, click Print and notice that Memo Style is selected.
Memo style is the default print setting; it prints the text of the selected items one at a time. Use Memo Style to print 
individual items, such as an entire e-mail message.
/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ^
Note | Account Names in Printouts
Depending on the print style you use. your printout may include the name associated with the e-mail account that you are using on your 
computer. In Memo Style, the name associated with the e-mail account displays in bold just above the header.

More Knowledge | Using Outlook Web Access
If you have an Exchange Server e-mail account, you may be able to use Outlook Web Access. This feature enables you to access your Microsoft 
Exchange Server mailbox from any computer that has an Internet connection by using your Web browser. Outlook Web Access is a useful 
program for individuals who work in different computer environments, such as Apple Macintosh or UNIX. It is also useful for individuals 
who require remote access. Outlook Web Access is usually set up by a network administrator or Internet service provider. You must have an 
Exchange Server e-mail account to use Outlook Web Access.
Objective 4 | Make Calls Over the Internet Using Skype
| To Communicate Using Skype, You Must Identify and Then Work with a Partner.
When completing Activity 3.10, identify a classmate or friend who has or can set up a Skype account. Then, partner 
with this individual to complete the project. You will both need to be online at the same time, but you do not have to 
be in the same location.
Skype is a software application with which you can make voice calls, make video calls, transfer files, or send 
messages—including instant messages and text messages—over the Internet. It is free to set up a basic account, 
and you can pay tor more sophisticated services such as those you might need in a business. Skype functions 
through a peer-to-peer network. In a peer-to-peer network, individuals communicate directly with each other 
rather than through a central server. Free services include calls to other users within the Skype service, one-to-one 
video calls, instant messaging, and screen sharing. Other services, for example calls to landline and mobile phones, 
can be made for a fee.

Objective 6 | Create and Maintain a Web Site and 
Blog with Squarespace
Blogs shaped early social media and are even more important now, because a blog is your 
online voice to tell the world about your business or your capabilities. Squarespace, according 
to their own site, is “a fully hosted, completely managed environment for creating and 
maintaining a Web site, blog, or portfolio.” Squarespace provides templates and tools to help 
you plan and create your site without hiring a Web designer. You can try Squarespace for free 
for a limited time, which provides you an opportunity to see if you like the platform. After the 
trial period, Squarespace charges for its services, but the price is quite affordable. Consider a 
platform like Squarespace if you have a business or service that requires an online presence.

Objective 1 | 
Categorize 
Computers
In your job as a Production Manager for 
a comic book publisher, your company is 
providing you with a new computer. The 
IT Department has asked you to identify 
the type of computer equipment you need. 
Your daily tasks include scheduling proj­
ects, estimating the cost of projects, setting 
quality standards, monitoring production, 
communicating with other departments, 
and adjusting publishing schedules. When 
selecting a computer, you must evaluate 
how you use your computer—including 
security concerns—and then match that 
evaluation to computers that are available 
in the price range set by the IT Depart­
ment. Where do you start?
Concept 4.01 
Identifying 
Computers for Individuals
Your personal computer—usually referred 
to as a PC—meets your individual comput­
ing needs or, when connected to a network, 
enables you to communicate and collaborate 
with others. The two most commonly used 
personal computers are categorized by their 
operating system—either the Microsoft 
Windows operating system or the Apple 
Macintosh (Mac) operating system. Comput­
ers that use the Microsoft Windows operat­
ing system are manufactured by companies 
such as Dell, Gateway, Sony, and Lenovo. 
Because the first PCs were made by IBM, 
they were termed IBM-compatible—and 
sometimes you still hear that term. Comput­
ers that use the Apple Macintosh operating 
system are made only by Apple.
You can categorize personal 
computers by size, power, and

Because enterprise operations typically 
use more files and large databases for 
activities like customer transactions and 
employee information, enterprise employ­
ees need systems that compute faster and 
have more storage capacity.
Professional workstations 
(Figure 4.3) are high-end desktop 
computers with powerful processing 
and output capabilities that are used by 
engineers, architects, circuit designers, 
financial analysts, game developers, or 
other technical professionals. A profes­
sional workstation might function inde­
pendently, but usually it is connected to 
a network. Because of its enhanced fea­
tures, a professional workstation is 
more expensive than a consumer desktop 
PC such as one you might purchase at 
Best Buy. Manufacturers of professional 
workstations include HP, Dell, 
and Lenovo.
Servers (Figure 4.4) are computers 
equipped with the hardware and software 
that store and make programs and data 
available if you are connected to it via a

network. A server is not designed for in­
dividual use. Servers are typically located 
in a centralized location and are about the 
size of a file cabinet. You connect to a net­
work on a client. which can be a desktop 
PC, a notebook, a netbook, a workstation, 
or a terminal—an inexpensive input/ 
output device consisting of a keyboard and 
video display but that has little process­
ing capability. A client can be designated 
as a fat client if it accesses the server 
for data but does its own processing or a 
thin client if it relies on the server for its 
processing ability. When you use a client 
and a centralized server, your system is 
referred to as a client/server network. 
The top two server manufacturers are Dell 
and IBM.
Minicomputers or midrange serv­
ers are servers that fall between worksta­
tions and mainframes and are about the 
size of a single- to four-drawer file cabinet. 
You would use this type of computer in 
situations that need to handle 4 to 200 
clients. The demand for minicomputers 
has decreased as workstations have be­
come more powerful and mainframes, less 
expensive. Minicomputer manufacturers 
include IBM and Sun Microsystems.
Mainframes or enterprise servers 
(Figure 4.5) are powerful servers that 
execute many computer instructions con­
currently. This type of computer is stored 
in a secure, climate-controlled room and 
services hundreds of thousands of clients 
at the same time. Large mainframe com­
puters process transactions such as airline

thousand to millions of dollars, and can fill the wall of an 
average size room.
reservations, bank transactions, or 
registrations for students at a college. 
Manufacturers include IBM, Fujitsu, 
and Amdahl.
You probably have never seen a 
supercomputer (Figure 4.6), which is 
an ultrafast system that processes large 
amounts of scientific data, often for the 
purpose of identifying underlying pat­
terns. A supercomputer can be a single 
computer or a series of computers working 
in parallel. You would find a supercom­
puter stored in secure, climate-controlled 
rooms, performing mathematical calcula­
tions at lightning speed. A supercomputer 
focuses on executing a few sets of instruc­
tions as fast as possible, and performance 
is measured in petaflops—the equivalent 
of one quadrillion calculations per second 
or 150,000 calculations for every human 
being on the planet per second. Supercom­
puters are valuable in computing calcula­
tions for weather predictions and space 
flight.

Objective 2 | 
Understand and 
Relate Computers, 
Society, and You
In your job as a Production Manager for a 
comic book publisher, you must develop a 
presentation about using computers in the 
workplace for the members of your produc­
tion team. You need to convey information 
about avoiding improper use of company 
computers, for example, inserting im­
proper or confidential content into e-mail 
messages or posting—as an employee—on 
social media sites like Twitter and Face- 
book. You also want your team members 
to use the most current techniques to com­
municate with customers and with other 
employees. In your presentation, you want 
to focus on current trends, mobile comput­
ing, and the lifespan of digital information 
and its possible effect on current and fu­
ture employment opportunities. Where do 
you start?
Computers are tools that should help 
you be more productive, creative, and ef­
ficient. Using a computer should reduce 
the amount of time you need to collect, 
organize, and process data and help you 
share the resulting information. Rather 
than going to the mall to buy the latest 
movie on DVD, you can purchase it or 
even view it online. Organizing your music 
or movie collection requires no physical 
actions—your computer and a database 
program make it possible to organize 
your entire collection by title, artist, re­
lease date, or genre while at a friend’s 
house or on vacation. There is no need to 
wait for movie reviews to come out in the 
newspaper—you just go online to find the 
latest reviews from critics and other mov­
iegoers, or watch the trailer yourself. You 
use a Facebook post, a blog entry, a Web 
page, or a tweet to invite or inform fam­
ily and friends of your plans. Do you ever 
consider the amount of time you save and 
information you share during one day by 
using computer devices?
Your computer, with appropriate soft­
ware, can carry out tasks on all types of 
data. That is why you see a penetration of 
computers into almost every occupational 
area and, as of 2009, into 80 percent of 
U.S. households. This is a significant in­
crease from 49 percent in 2001 and 2002. 
In other words, four out of every live 
households in the United States have a
computer. However, computers are still 
not readily accessible in some segments 
of society.
Concept 4.03 Recognizing 
the Digital Divide
The more educated you are and the more 
money you make, the more likely you are 
to own a computer and have Internet ac­
cess. The Pew Internet and American Life 
Project in December 2008 confirmed that 
95 percent of college-educated individuals 
in the United States use the Internet, but 
only 53 percent of individuals with a high 
school education do so. Statistics also exist 
to support age and race as factors affecting 
U.S. computer use.
This disparity in computer ownership 
and Internet access, known as the digital 
divide, is not limited to any single 
nation. It is a global social phenomenon 
that raises the ethical question of univer­
sal access for information. The ability to 
access this information places some indi­
viduals at an advantage, while those that 
cannot access it are at a disadvantage, 
thus creating the divide. You can research 
government and educational programs 
working to bridge this gap to get an idea 
of some attempts to provide computer 
access for all.
Concept 4.04 Using Social 
Networks
Originally social networking seemed to be 
directed toward communication or enter­
tainment—not toward increasing your in­
formation or learning. That has changed. 
Companies, universities, and nonprofit 
organizations now use social networking 
sites to gather input, collect your ideas for 
future products and events, and make use 
of videos and games to get you to connect 
with their brand. It would be a mistake for 
you to dismiss these types of sites or appli­
cations as child’s play. You can review 
results from surveys provided by a For­
rester Research Report in Figure 4.7.
These summarizations substantiate that 
the contact between adults on these sites 
and the amount of information shared 
daily is real, on the rise, and reaching a 
population demographic that is significant.
Social networking sites are online 
services that initially were created to fos­
ter relationships among people but now 
have extended their usage to promote 
business, events, bands, and other such 
entities. Statistics from the June 2010

A quarter of adults publish a blog—entries 
that resemble journal notes—and upload

YouTube is the most recognized and popular 
video broadcasting site. Others include Flickr 
Video, Vimeo, Metacafe, and Videojug.
Nearly 60 percent of adults maintain a profile 
on a social networking site.
I he most popular social networking sites are 
Facebook and Twitter.
Approximately 70 percent of adults read 
blogs, tweets, and watch UGC (user­
generated content) videos.

You can find blogs on almost any Web page and 
on any topic. Radio and TV stations, as well as 
political sites, are popular for hosting blogs to 
collect opinions.
UGC videos can be posted on individually 
created Web pages or, for viewing by a larger 
audience, on You l ube.

Concept 4.05 Working 
Collaboratively
Collaboration is working together with 
others on a common endeavor, as when 
you and one or more of your classmates 
work together on a class project. Comput­
ers facilitate collaboration. For example, 
in law enforcement computers are used 
to communicate between jurisdictions 
permitting national and global exposure 
of events and to access and edit shared 
reports, files, and criminal databases like 
the Automated Fingerprint Identification 
System known as the AFIS (Figure 4.9).
Collaboration software—also re­
ferred to as groupware or workgroup 
support systems—is software that helps 
people work together to complete a shared 
task or achieve a shared goal. By using col­
laboration software, you can share ideas, 
create documents, and conduct meetings, 
regardless of location or time zone. Exam­
ples of collaboration software include:
• Microsoft SharePoint: Collabora­
tion software for an enterprise that 
makes use of Web sites so individuals 
can share information, manage docu­
ments, and publish reports.
• Google Docs: An online, real-time 
group of collaboration tools that pro­
vides access to a Web-based word pro­
cessor, spreadsheet, graphic program, 
and a presentation program. Multiple 
approved users can edit the same file 
at the same time, assuring that you 
are always viewing the latest edits.
• Wiki: A collection of Web pages to 
which you can contribute or modify 
content if granted access. Wikipedia is 
one of the best known wikis.
• Google Groups: A free service pro­
vided by Google that permits group 
members interested in discussing a 
common topic to collaborate on shared 
Web pages; set group pictures, colors, 
and styles; and upload and share indi­
vidually created work. You can save, 
print, and present the finished product 
on your own computer.
Concept 4.06 Recognizing 
Advantages and Disadvantages 
of Computer Use
Computers offer you many advantages and 
communication options, but as a respon­
sible computer user, you should also be 
aware of the disadvantages. Review both 
columns of the table in Figure 4.10.
Speed is one of the greatest 
advantages of your computer. It 
can perform, in a few seconds, 
calculations that would take you 
days. So much information is gen­
erated from computers that it is 
easy for you to succumb to infor­
mation overload—a feeling of 
anxiety and incapacity when you 
are presented with more infor­
mation than you can handle. Ac­
cording to research from the firm 
Basex, which chose information 
overload as its 2008 Workforce 
Problem of the Year, dealing 
with a constant stream of e- 
mail messages, phone calls, text 
messages, and tweets resulted in a loss of 
28 percent of the workday in the United 
States This equates to eight to ten hours a 
week per worker and approximately $600 
billion in lost productivity in a single year.
Cost is a factor you must weigh 
against your computer’s performance—the 
combination of processing power and the 
amount of random access memory. In gen­
eral, the faster your system runs and the 
more random access memory installed, 
the more your system will cost. You should 
weigh the costs against the benefits and 
needs on a case-by-case basis.
Hardware reliability and accuracy are 
two more advantages of computers. Com­
puters almost always respond when turned 
on, and provide you with consistent results 
for repeated calculations. Your computer 
can transcribe your speech with an accu­
racy of 95 percent or more. In fact, almost 
all computer errors are actually caused by 
Haws in sollware or errors in the data sup­
plied by the person using the computer.
Lastly is our need to be connected to 
the Internet as well as to each other. The

Are you familiar with the sayings Seeing is 
believing and A picture is worth a thou­
sand words? In the context of a courtroom, 
these words gain strength. Add the ability 
to use technology to magnify voices, pro­
vide testimony via webcam from a witness 
confined to a hospital bed, use a translator 
through videoconferencing, and digitally 
reproduce the scene to provide a reenact­
ment of the event. Maybe it sounds like 
an episode from your favorite crime in­
vestigation show. But this is no television 
episode. With jurors traditionally having 
information organized for them in bulleted 
lists, slide shows, and presented in visual
images, the atmosphere of the conven­
tional courtroom, which is based on oral 
delivery and inaccurate sequencing of 
information, can be confusing. In the 
future, expect more visual aids in the 
courtroom to help jurors organize the data. 
Headsets will enable jurors to replay parts 
of the testimony, or using 3D goggles 
jurors can review a video clip or simulation 
or revisit the actual scene of the crime. 
Attorneys, paralegals, and administrative 
assistants of the future will have to com­
bine their legal and technical skills to not 
only present the information, but to pres­
ent it in a visual and audio manner that 
best suits their objective.

downside of all this digital information 
sharing is the security of that information 
and the headaches it can cause if it falls 
into the wrong hands. Along with comput­
ers’ strengths and weaknesses, consider 
some additional points in your quest to 
become a responsible user.
Concept 4.07 Using Computer 
Hardware
One way to get comfortable with your com­
puter is to read any instructions on main­
tenance and operation that come with it. 
Then create a safe and healthy work area 
by following these tips:
Place your computer equipment in a 
secure position so it will not fall or 
cause an accident, use a surge protec­
tor, and avoid plugging too many de­
vices into the same electrical outlet. 
Leave plenty of space around your 
computer equipment for sufficient air 
circulation to prevent overheating. 
Make sure computer cables, cords, and 
wires are fastened securely and not 
left where you could trip over them or 
where they could cause a fire.
Keep your computer area free of dust, 
food, and liquids. Moisture, static 
electricity, and magnetic interference 
affect your system’s performance.
Equally important to a safe working 
environment is the use and arrange­
ment of your devices, equipment, and 
lighting. These can make a big impact 
on your physical health.
Ergonom ics is the field of study 
that is concerned with matching your 
posture and body design to your equip­
ment and your work environment. Ergo­
nomics takes into account your limitations 
and capabilities to ensure that the tasks, 
equipment, and overall environment suit 
you (Figure 4.11). The most common 
injuries related to extended computer 
use occur to the wrist and back. Carpal 
tunnel syndrome—also known as cu­
mulative trauma disorder or repetitive 
strain injury—is a condition caused by 
repeated motions that damage sensitive

nerves in your hands, 
wrists, and arms and can 
be caused by prolonged 
keyboard use. This injury 
can be serious enough to 
require surgery. Using an 
ergonomically designed 
keyboard keeps your wrists 
flat, reducing—but not 
eliminating—your chance 
of an injury (Figure 4.12).
You might also purchase 
an ergonomic desk chair 
if back injury is a concern.

Concept 4.08 Recognizing the 
Risks of Using Flawed Software
Computer hardware can be amazingly reli­
able, but software typically contains some 
errors, which are referred to as bugs.
Many programs contain millions of lines 
of computer programming language code 
(Figure 4.13). With so many lines of code, 
bugs are inevitable.
On average, commercial programs con­
tain between 1 and 7 errors for every 1,000 
lines of code. This means that your ATM 
program is likely to have approximately 
360 errors in its code, and an IRS program 
over 400 thousand errors. Fortunately, most 
errors simply cause your programs to run 
slower or perform unnecessary tasks, but 
some errors cause miscalculations or cause 
your system to become nonresponsive.

F I G U R E  4 .1 4  Subway and train systems, like the Intercity Express 
(ICE) in Cologne, Germany, use safety-critical software for guidance that 
must be of the highest standards and bug free.
Bugs in a word processing program 
are not life threatening, but a bug in a 
mission-critical or safety-critical system, 
like air traffic control and commuter train 
guidance, can create a disastrous event 
(Figure 4.14). You might wonder how such 
events are avoided. Safety-critical systems 
are designed to higher quality standards 
and more intense testing to reduce errors 
and increase stability.
Concept 4.09 Identifying the 
Impact of Computer Use
You would probably agree that computers 
and the Internet have improved your quality 
of life. Consider the effect of technological 
developments for the disabled (Figure 4.15).
While equipment in Figure 4.15 may 
not exist in your school, the integration of 
individuals with special needs into your 
regular classrooms and workforce environ­
ments requires that computer access be 
provided for these individuals. Advance­
ments in this area include:
The Americans with Disabilities Act 
of 1990: This act mandated that both

or output.

public and private entities provide 
computer access to individuals with 
disabilities.
• Kindle 2: The release of this device 
by Amazon in 2009 took e-readers to 
a new height with the addition of the 
text-to-speech feature.
• Computer controlled devices: Individu­
als with physical disabilities benefit 
from the use of computer controlled 
treadmills and muscle stimulators, 
and by engaging in video game thera­
pies that enhance coordination and 
muscle strength.
• Neurally controlled artificial limb: The 
Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (DARPA) is working on an ex­
tremity that will hook up directly into 
severed nerves. It will feel, look, and 
perform like your natural arm and en­
able full motor and sensory capability.
What about general computer-based 
training and learning opportunities? Have 
you taken advantage of e-learning at your 
college? E-leaming is the use of comput­
ers and computer programs to replace
traditional classrooms and the time-place 
specificity of learning. How about taking 
an online class? These are newer computer- 
based approaches to learning. You might 
want to research the options offered at your 
school and see if any suit your learning style.
Concept 4.10 Recognizing 
the Effects of Computers 
on Employment
Your computer skills are very important to 
your future. The use of computers creates 
new job opportunities, and thus creates a 
need for a computer proficient workforce. 
The state of Wyoming has a workforce 
planning Web site that contains computer 
skills needed by the workforce, and these 
are outlined in five proficiency levels. This 
list can help employers assess their needs 
and employees assess their skill level.
Using computers to complete your 
work is only one area of computer applica­
tion in the workplace. Advanced technol­
ogy can also free you from occupations 
with hazardous working conditions and 
ones with repetitive tasks, which make
TECHNOLOGY 
ON THE JOB
In many jobs, em ployers require you to 
accomplish tasks by using a computer. As 
a Production Manager for a comic book 
publisher, you not only need to know tradi­
tional planning techniques, but also how to 
use software applications to schedule and 
to organize and analyze tasks, deadlines, 
and resources. As a manager, you have the 
additional responsibility of keeping digital 
information confidential and secure. The 
W yom ing workforce planning W eb  site 
at http ://w yom ing w orkforcep lannin g . 
state. wy.us/wyoming_competencies/ana- 
lytical/basic_computer_skills.htm ranks the 
skills necessary for a Production Manager's 
position as a proficiency level 5, the high­
est level. In this ranking system, essential 
computer skills are associated with a spe­
cific computer application. For example:
• Word processing skills include: set­
ting defaults, creating cross refer­
ences, working with endnotes and 
footnotes, creating and using mac­
ros, and displaying content in tables.
• Spreadsheet skills include: knowing 
when and how to use functions and 
formulas, creating and using mac­
ros, using data analysis tools and ad­
vanced filters to sort through data 
and extract information, creating links 
to external sources of data for quick 
retrieval, and designing appropriate 
charts.
• Database skills include: designing, de­
veloping, protecting, and replicating 
complex databases with macro mod­
ules; using features like queries and 
reports to provide uncluttered and 
readable output; and controlling data 
accuracy through data validation tests.
Go to the W yom ing workforce plan­
ning W eb site or search for other work­
force d evelo p m e n t sites, and then 
evaluate your own computer skills against 
the information you find. In which profi­
ciency level do you rank? What courses do 
you need to advance your proficiencies?

workflow safer and more efficient and 
which increase productivity. Automation, 
the replacement of human workers by 
machines and computer-guided robots, is 
taking over many manufacturing jobs once 
held by people (Figure 4.16).
In addition to seeing robots in an in­
dustrial and manufacturing setting, in your 
future, you will see robots playing a more 
important role in daily activities. The robot 
named ASIMO (Advanced Step in Innova­
tive Mobility) is the result of more than 
two decades of experimentation by Honda 
engineers (Figure 4.17). It has human-like

flexibility and endless possibilities. Ifyou 
visit Disneyland in Anaheim, California, 
you can see ASIMO in action at the Honda 
ASIMO Theater in the Innoventions attrac­
tion. ASIMO is still a work in progress.
Another not so visible effect of tech­
nology on your employment is the glo­
balization of jobs. An example is creating 
a product by assembling pieces of that 
product produced in different locations or 
in one or several different countries. The 
term outsourcing, the subcontracting of 
portions of a job to a third party to reduce 
cost, time, and energy, is closely related to 
globalization. In December 2010, Investors, 
com cited that 1.3 million additional West­
ern jobs will vanish by 2014 due to the 
accelerated movement of work to offshore 
locations. Outsourcing alone is not the only 
cause of job loss; some studies argue that 
increased productivity is an associated 
cause. Increasing U.S. productivity by as 
little as 1 percent can eliminate up to 1.3 
million jobs per year. Structural unem­
ployment results when technology makes 
an entire job category obsolete. Ifyou lose 
a job because of structural unemployment, 
you most likely are not going to get it back; 
you will need to seek retraining.
Consider this: Half of all the jobs that 
you will see advertised in 10 years do not 
exist today. So, how will you survive— 
and flourish—in this changing computer- 
driven economy? To survive, you must 
understand technology, accept that edu­
cation is a lifelong process, and adapt 
quickly to change.
Concept 4.11 
Identifying 
Responsible and Ethical 
Computer Behavior
You probably use a computer and 
a cell phone to send e-mail, text 
messages, and maybe even tweets 
throughout the day. All of this 
seems fine within your own per­
sonal space. Do you stop to think 
about how your use of computer de­
vices and the Internet really affects 
you and those in your school, your 
workplace, your family, your com­
munity, and the environment? Con­
sider the following good practices:
• Do not talk on your phone 
or send text messages while 
driving.
Be aware of the people around you; they 
do not want to hear your conversation,

or see your e-mail.
• Recycle your paper 
and printer car­
tridges to protect the 
environment.
• Properly dispose of, 
recycle, or donate your 
obsolete computer 
equipment, also called 
e-waste (Figure 4.18).
• Extend your ethical 
standards of right and 
wrong to your use of 
computers. Ifyou are 
unsure of an action, research com­
puter ethics, which is a branch of 
philosophy that deals with computer- 
related moral dilemmas to guide your 
decisions.
• Do not participate in digital piracy, 
the unauthorized reproduction and 
distribution of computer-based 
media. This action is viewed in the 
same way as photocopying a book
or taking a DVD from a store 
without paying, and is currently 
blamed for a global loss of more

• Monitor the amount of 
time you spend at your 
computer to avoid 
experiencing levels 
of depression and 
loneliness.
Objective 3 | Protect 
Privacy in Cyberspace
In your job as a Production Manager for a 
comic book publisher, you are in charge of 
planning, coordinating, and publishing a 
manuscript that will result in a finished 
comic book. You must use e-mail and other 
electronic tools to communicate with col­
leagues and independent contractors. You 
are concerned about sending sensitive 
and personal information—for example, 
contracts that contain social security 
numbers—and you want to maintain a 
high level of security on all communica­
tion. Where do you start?
Of all the social and ethical issues 
raised bv the use of computers linked by 
the Internet, the threats to your privacy 
and anonymity are among the most seri­
ous. Government-sponsored sites, like the 
Identity Theft site hosted by the Federal 
Trade Commission (Figure 4.19) and www 
.idtheft.gov, your one stop source for gov­
ernment information about identity theft 
(Figure 4.20), offer you practical advice, 
display privacy alerts, and report on cur­
rent privacy issues.
Privacy, as defined by U.S. Supreme 
Court Justice Louis Brandeis in 1928, 
is “the right to be left alone.” Applied to 
technology, privacy refers to your ability to 
restrict or eliminate the collection, use, and 
sale of confidential personal information. 
Some privacy advocates, like the Electronic 
Frontier Foundation (EFF), have developed 
a Bill of Rights for Social Network Users. 
You can apply the principles in this bill to 
anyone who posts information on a server. 
The rights that the EFF proposes include:
• The right to informed decision making— 
You make the choices about who 
sees your data and how it is used, and

cle old computers, printers, monitors, 
batteries, and other types of e-waste.

Web sites should provide a clear inter­
face that allows you to do so.
• The right to control—You maintain 
control over the use and disclosure of 
your own data.
• The right to leave—You can transfer 
your data to another site in a usable for­
mat and delete, not just disable, all data 
or the entire account from the database.
Concept 4.12 j Collecting 
Information without Consent
You may be willing to divulge personal 
information when you see a need for do­
ing so. For example, when you apply for a 
loan, the bank can reasonably ask you to 
list your other creditors to determine your 
ability to repay.
Companies that maintain databases 
may claim that they sell your informa­
tion only to legitimate customers such as 
lending institutions, prospective employ­
ers, marketing firms, and licensed private 
investigators. They insist that these firms 
are highly ethical, have security measures 
in place, and do not release your informa­
tion to the general public. However, no 
matter how secure data appears, there 
are always people seeking to violate your 
security. An open global forum 
called PCI Security Standards 
Council, founded by several fi­
nancial organizations in 2006, 
develops and implements secu­
rity standards to protect your 
bank account data. Go to www 
.usa.gov/About/Privacy_ 
Security.shtm l for information 
on use of data obtained from 
this government sponsored Web 
site (Figure 4.21).

1. Enter a URL into the address

• Online retail sites

What troubles privacy advocates is the 
tactic of tracking cookies to gather data 
about your browsing and shopping hab­
its—without your consent. Several Inter­
net ad networks, for example DoubleClick, 
drop a cookie on your computer’s hard 
drive that tracks your browsing habits 
and preferences as you move through Web 
sites that contract with the ad network. 
When you visit another site, the cookie is 
detected, read, and the ad network selects 
and displays a banner ad—an ad that is 
not actually part of the Web page but is 
supplied separately by an ad network— 
that matches the products you 
were browsing.
In response to concerns that such 
tracking violates your privacy, ad networks 
claim that they do not link the collected 
information with your name or address. 
However, current technology would enable 
these firms to do so—and privacy advo­
cates fear that some of them already have.

The term ubiquitous computing re­
fers to a trend in which you no longer inter­
act with one computer at a time but rather 
with multiple devices connected through an 
omnipresent network, enabling technology 
to become virtually embedded and enabling 
you to interact seamlessly with devices you 
use. The proponents of this technology say 
that this type of computing is more natural. 
They envision a system where billions of 
miniature, ubiquitous intercommunication 
devices are scattered worldwide. An example 
of the use of ubiquitous computing would be 
the automatic adjustment of an environmen­
tal setting, like heat, in your office.
An active badge is a small device you 
wear that transmits a unique infrared sig­
nal every 5 to 10 seconds. Networked sen­
sors detect the signal and acknowledge your 
location, thus allowing e-mail, phone calls, 
or messages to be forwarded to you 
wherever you are. You already accept 
the idea of receiving e-mail anywhere; 
after all, that is already a feature 
of portable communication devices.
However, have you thought about the 
electronic trails that your movement 
creates? You might be uncomfortable 
knowing that these trails can pinpoint 
your exact location through the day.
The use of radio waves to track a 
chip or tag placed in or on an object 
is referred to as radio frequency 
identification or RFID. RFID tags 
(Figure 4.24) often substitute for 
bar codes for inventory control in

sertion of RFID tags into 
credit cards and passports 
has raised suspicion about 
the ethics of their tracking

Technology provides a means of sur­
veillance that is invisible and ever pres­
ent. Even devices that are installed for 
your protection can be manipulated and 
becom e mechanisms of surveillance. 
Recently the FBI served OnStar with a 
court order to give the agency access 
to the passive listening feature embed­
ded within OnStar devices. Such access 
would enable the FBI to record conversa­
tions held in a vehicle. OnStar filed a suit 
and won, after a two-year court battle. 
The ruling in OnStar's favor, however, 
was not on the grounds of invasion of 
privacy. Instead, the court ruled on the 
fact that the use of the passive listening 
feature would disable the emergency 
calling feature and this would constitute 
a breach of the consumers' contract. How 
do you feel about the use of such devices 
for surveillance? When do such actions 
become a violation of privacy? How pri­
vate are your private conversations?

quire you to have direct contact or line-of-

is not deactivated, the object’s movements 
can continue to be tracked indefinitely.

Person ID
Another example of this is the insertion of 
microchips into pets and other livestock. It 
has even been used for people. The RFID 
chip can include human contact informa­
tion and health records; for an animal, the 
chip can contain owner information and 
vaccination data.
Privacy advocates have been con­
cerned about the use of encrypted, pas­
sive RFID tags in your U.S. passports 
for several years (Figure 4.25). The tag 
contains the same information included on 
your actual passport—name, nationality, 
gender, date of birth, and place of birth of 
the passport holder—as well as a digitized 
signature and your photo. The government 
asserts that the RFID tag does not broad­
cast a signal and can be read only within 
close proximity of special scanning devices. 
However, a new passport card approved in
2008, as part of the Western Hemisphere 
Travel Initiative for travel to Mexico, 
Canada, Bermuda, and the Caribbean, has 
an unencrypted chip that can be read from 
up to 30 feet away. This raises serious 
concerns that your identity could easily 
be stolen or your location tracked without 
your consent or awareness.
Now that you can identify some of the 
privacy threats posed by technology and 
the Internet, consider ways to protect your 
own privacy.
Concept 4.14 j Protecting 
Your Privacy
Protecting your privacy rights as a U.S. 
citizen is a controversial topic. Market­
ing industry spokespeople and lobbyists 
argue that the U.S. government should 
not impose laws or regulations to protect 
consumers’ privacy. They argue that the 
industry should regulate itself. Privacy ad­
vocates counter that technology has out­
paced the industry’s capability to 
regulate itself, as evidenced 
by the widespread 
availability of highly 
personal information 
on the Internet.
Most agree 
that your indi­
vidual rights 
should be 
protected in 
some manner, 
but the defini­

able levels

varies widely. Some pieces of legislation 
currently in place are detailed in the table 
in Figure 4.26.
Some independent groups, such as 
the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), 
which is a leading global trade association 
with headquarters in New York City, are 
attempting to enforce a basic code of ethics 
among its membership. The organization 
tracks policy issues that affect the direct 
marketing community, operates the Web 
site https://ivivw.dniachoice.org/dnia/ 
memberlhome.action that permits you 
to opt out of unwanted commercial mail­
ing or opt in for mailing that you do want, 
and takes steps to ensure that your confi­
dential information does not fall into the 
wrong hands.
Be aware that many of the most ag­
gressive Internet-based marketing firms 
have no ties to or previous experience with 
the DMA, and several opt-out systems on 
the Internet are already used for fraudulent 
purposes. For example, e-mail spammers 
typically claim that you can opt out of mass 
e-mail marketing campaigns. But when you 
respond to such messages, you only succeed 
in validating your e-mail addresses, and 
the result is often a major increase in the 
volume of unsolicited e-mail you receive. A 
report from TRACE Laboratories at M86 
Security for the week ending July 24, 2011, 
revealed that India and Russia (Figure 
4.27) were the leaders in relaying spam— 
unsolicited messages sent in bulk over elec­
tronic mailing systems—and that messages 
touting pharmaceutical products accounted 
for 58 percent of all spam.
In the United States, the CAN-SPAM 
Act of 2003 provided the tools to combat
spammers. The Federal Trade Commis­
sion (FTC) and the Department of Justice 
have primary jurisdiction over spammers, 
but other agencies, including states and 
ISPs, can also prosecute them. The legis­
lation has been criticized because it pre­
vents states from enacting tougher laws, 
prevents you from individually suing 
spammers, and does not require e-mailers 
to request permission before sending 
messages. Additionally, it may be ineffec­
tive against foreign spammers who are 
outside U.S. jurisdiction. Although many 
contend that the act is just a drop in the 
bucket, the monetary threat the CAN- 
SPAM Act can impose on a violator can

itself'be a deterrent. In 2008, MySpace 
successfully sued the so-called “Spam 
King” Sanford Wallace and a business 
partner for violations of the CAN-SPAM 
Act. A federal judge awarded MySpace 
close to $230 million; the award is signifi­
cant although it is doubtful the money 
will ever be collected.
Although privacy on the Internet 
may be a concern for some, it has not 
slowed down e-commerce. The Internet 
retail sector continues to thrive. The Cen­
sus Bureau records show that, despite 
economic issues, the estimate of U.S. re­
tail e-commerce sales for the first quarter 
of 2010 was $38.7 billion, an increase of 
1.5 percent from the fourth quarter of
2009. Most of the popular commercial 
Web sites try to relieve your online secu­
rity fears by creating privacy policy pages 
that explain how they collect and use 
personal information about site visitors. 
Many also display privacy seals from 
third-party vendors such as TRUSTe, 
WebTrust, or the Better Business Bureau 
as a sign that they comply with the ven­
dor’s privacy standards and regulations.
Until laws are passed that will protect 
basic privacy rights, it is up to you to safe­
guard your data on the Internet. To do so, 
follow these suggestions:
• Surf the Web anonymously by using 
software products such as Anony­
mizer’s Anonymous Surfing (w w w  
.anonym izer.com  ) or devices such as
the IronKey Secure USB flash drive 
(w w w .iro n k ey .co m ), which includes 
special security software to protect 
your data and encrypt your online 
communications (Figure 4.28).
• Use a throwaway e-mail address from 
a free Web-based service such as 
Google’s Gmail (w w w .g o o g le.com ) 
for mailing lists and chat rooms.
• Instruct children not to divulge any 
personal information online without 
first asking a parent or teacher for 
permission. Reliable Web sites like 
w w w .u s-cert.gov provide informa­
tion on keeping children safe while 
on the Web and on other issues of 
Internet privacy and digital security 
(Figure 4.29).
• Do not fill out site registration forms 
unless you see a privacy policy state­
ment indicating that the information 
you supply will not be sold.
Do you know that all new cell phones 
in the United States must have GPS aware­
ness? This means that your phone can be 
located, usually within 30 feet, by law en­
forcement and emergency services person­
nel when you dial 911. Some services, such 
as Where (formerly known as uLocate) and 
BrickHouse Security child locator, provide 
the exact location of a cell phone. Such a 
service is useful when a parent is trying to 
keep track of a child, but it can be intrusive 
when an employer uses it to track an em­
ployee using a company cell phone.
FIGURE 4.28 Devices 
like the IronKey Secure USB 
flash drive include special 
security software to allow you 
to surf the Web privately and 
securely while protecting your 
identity and data.

Wtiat is cyboibuttying?
Cyberbullying refers to practice of using technology lo harass or ouiiy someone else Bullies used to be restricted to 
memods such as pnystcat intimidation, postal mail, or the telephone Now developments in electronic media offer forums 
sucti as email instant messaging weo pages ana digital pnotos lo add to the arsenal Computers cell phones and PDAs 
are current tools that are being used to conduct an old practice
Forms of cyberbullying can range in severity from cruel o< embarrassing rumors lo threats, harassment, or stalking It can 
affect any age group, however, teenagers and young adults aie common victims and cyberbullying Is a growing problem in 
schools
Why has cybetbuRylng become such a problem?
The reiatrve anonymity of me internet is appealing for bullies because it enhances me intimidation and mattes tracing me 
activity more difficult Some bullies also And it easier to be more vtoous because mere is no personal contact unfortunately 
the internet and email can also increase Ihe visibility of me activity Information or pictures posted online or forwarded in 
mass emails can reach a larger audience faster than more traditional memods, causing more damage lo me victims And 
because of me amount of personal Information available online, bullies may be able to aibitrarily choose their victims
Cyberbullylng may also indicate a tendency toward moie senous behavioi While bullying has always been an unfortunate 
reality, most bullies grow out ot it Cyberbullying has not existed long enougn to have solid research, but mere is evidence 
that It may be an early warning for more violent behavior
How can you protect yourself or your children?
• Teach your children good online habits - Explain Ihe nsks of technology, and teach children howto be responsible 
online (see Keeping Children Safe Online for more information) Reduce their risk of becoming cyberbutlies by 
selling guidelines for and monitoring their use of me internet and other electronic media (cell phones. POAs etc)
• Keep lines of communication open Regularly talk to your children about their online activities so mat they feel
Some software is so powerful that it 
will send a notification to the home unit 
whenever the cell phone leaves a desig­
nated geographic area. This type of loca­
tion-aware tracking software is already in 
use by the criminal justice system to keep 
track of offenders who are sentenced to 
home detention. The subject is fitted with 
an ankle or wrist bracelet, and then the 
software is set to trigger an alarm if the 
wearer strays from the designated area.
In the area of health care, these bracelets 
keep track of Alzheimer’s patients. Re­
cently MIT students developed programs 
using GPS capabilities for the Android mo­
bile OS by Google. One program enables 
you to change your phone’s settings as 
your location changes, so it will automati­
cally be silent in a movie theater or class­
room but will ring when you are outdoors. 
Another program will remind you that 
you need to pick up milk as you pass by 
the store.
When using a shared system, an 
important concern is creating and keep­
ing your passwords private. A password 
is designated as a strong password if it 
contains a sequence of numbers and char­
acters that is difficult for someone to guess, 
For example, your password should 
contain at least fourteen characters,
include both uppercase and lowercase 
letters, and include some numbers and 
special characters. Additionally, your pass­
word should not be a recognizable word or 
phrase; not be the name of a person, pet, 
or item close to you, and not be a string of 
numbers like your social security number 
or birth date.
The longer the user login and pass­
word, the more time it takes for someone, 
or some program, to guess it (Figure 4.30). 
Use online strength testers to evaluate

Web sites or circulate offensive jokes via 
e-mail may be creating a hostile environ­
ment for other employees— and that could 
result in a lawsuit against the company.
To protect your privacy at work, con­
sider the following measures:
• Do not use your employer’s services like 
telephone or e-mail for personal purposes.
• Be aware of shoulder surfing —the 
attempt by an individual to obtain 
information by watching your moni­
tor and keyboard strokes— usually by 
looking over your shoulder.
• When entering a secured area that 
requires authorized access, be aware 
of anyone who is attempting to 
ta ilg a te — enter with you to avoid 
using the appropriate check-in or 
authorization procedure. Tailgating 
can also be extended to electronic 
entry and occurs when you do not log 
out of a system and another person 
sits down and begins to work under 
the guise of the authorized user.
• Assume that everything you do while 
you are at work may be monitored.

C ybercrim e refers to crimes carried out 
by means of the Internet. A new legal 
field—cyberlaiv— is emerging to track

In 2006, the United States ratified a 
treaty known as the Convention on 
Cybercrime. This treaty, which was devel­
oped by the Council of Europe, is the first 
international treaty to address the issues 
and concerns surrounding cybercrime. Its 
goal is to provide guidelines for consistent 
cybercrime legislation that is compatible 
with other member countries and to en­
courage international cooperation in these 
areas. Many government agencies, such 
as the Department of Justice at w w w

Concept 4.15 Categorizing 
Computer Crime
Anyone who wants to invade or harm your 
computer system can use a variety of tools 
and tricks. Ifyou pay close attention to 
your system’s behavior and the activities 
of others that use it, you can avoid becom­
ing a victim of computer crimes.
Imagine that your phone rings and 
the caller is a collection agency demand­
ing immediate payment for a bill that is 
past due for a $5,000 stereo system. You 
cannot believe what you are hearing, be­
cause you always pay your bills on time, 
and you have not purchased any stereo 
equipment lately. What do you think is 
going on?
Such a call could indicate that you 
have been a victim of iden tity th eft. one 
of the fastest growing crimes in the United 
States and Canada. Identity theft happens 
when a criminal obtains enough personal 
information to impersonate you. With a 
few key pieces of information, such as 
your address and Social Security number, 
and possibly a credit card or bank account 
number, an identity thief can open a credit 
account, access your bank account, open 
accounts for utilities or cell phones, or 
apply for a loan or mortgage—all in your 
name!
How do criminals get this information? 
Some identity theft does not even involve 
computers. Disgruntled employees may 
physically steal information from their com­
pany, thieves may steal your mail or wallet,

or a neighbor or business competitor may 
dum pster dive— go through your garbage 
to obtain personal or sensitive data.
In a ph ish in g  attack, a “phisher” 
poses as a legitimate company, like a 
bank or credit agency, in an e-mail or on a 
Web site in an attempt to obtain personal 
information such as your Social Security 
number, user name, password, and ac­
count numbers. Because the communica­
tion looks legitimate, you comply and the 
phisher now gains access to your accounts.
M alw are, short for malicious soft­
ware, is a general term that describes 
software designed to damage or infiltrate 
a computer system without the owner’s 
consent or knowledge. Malware is used to 
commit fraud, send spam, and steal your 
personal data. It includes spyware, com­
puter viruses, worms, and Trojan horses. 
Although the United States was the big­
gest source of malware activity in 2009 
(Figure 4.34), the exploits of those in other 
countries can have equally devastating 
consequences.
Spyw are is software that can collect 
your personal information, monitor your 
Web surfing habits, and then distribute 
this information to a third party. Some of 
its less destructive activity can make your 
computer seem sluggish or crash more of­
ten, increase the frequency of pop-up ads, 
make unauthorized changes to your home 
or search pages, and cause the appearance 
of new browser toolbars.
Some spyware, such as adw are, 
generates pop-up ads and targeted 
banner ads, and is usually considered 
to be a nuisance rather than mali­
cious. However, keyloggers, which 
can record all the keystrokes you 
type— such as passwords, account 
numbers, or conversations— and then 
relay them to others, pose a more 
dangerous security threat.
How does spyware enter your 
system? It is often distributed when 
you download free software or in­
fected files. File-sharing sites are no­
torious for this. However, clicking on 
a pop-up ad can also install spyware, 
and visiting an infected Web site can 
trigger a drive-by download.
Your best defense against spy- 
ware is to:
• Install an antispyware program 
and update it frequently.
• Use a firew a ll, a program or de­
vice that allows you to access the

on the information bar, because it gives 
you options about how to handle 
the incident it is reporting. Both brows­
ers also offer built-in antiphishing fea­
tures to help protect you from known 
phishing sites. Firefox will display a 
warning dialog box when you attempt 
to access a phishing site, and IE  uses a 
color-coded Security Status bar. In IE, a 
green security status bar indicates that 
the site is secure; yellow indicates the site 
might be suspicious; and red identifies a 
site known to pose a threat. A white sta­
tus bar simply means that no identity in­
formation is available. However, the lack 
of a warning color or dialog box does not 
guarantee that a site is safe; you should 
still practice safe surfing methods.

On your own system, a virus spreads 
by simply opening an infected file or pro­
gram. On a network or someone else’s 
system, a virus spreads by copying an 
infected file or program to a U SB  drive, CD, 
or DVD and then giving it to someone. When 
the storage media with the infected program 
or file is inserted into the uninfected system, 
the infected file opens and the infection 
spreads to this system (Figure 4.36).

How Viruses Work
1. The virus arrives on your 
system, most often through 
an e-mail attachment.
2. The virus is activated by 
opening or running the 
attachment and spreads 
to other documents on 
your system.

3. The virus can spread through 
a network connection, 
forwarded e-mail, or use of 
a portable storage device 
with the other computer.
4. The payload is triggered and 
performs its programmed activity, 
which can be a simple joke or the 
destruction of data on your system.

To prevent a virus from infecting your 
system, follow these tips:
• Never open an e-mail from an un­
known sender.
• Never open an e-mail with no subject.
• Never open an attachment unless you 
first pass it through a virus-checking 
program.
• Never open an attachment with a file 
extension of dat, exe, or scr.
• Never trust an e-mail with two or 
more “R E ” entries in the subject line.
Some viruses are nuisances or 
pranks; others can corrupt or erase your 
data or completely disable your com­
puter. One very dangerous virus is the 
boot sector virus, which propagates by 
an infected program, but only installs it­
self on the beginning tracks of your hard 
drive where code is stored that automati­
cally executes every time you start your 
computer. Another, named Disk Killer, 
can wipe out all of the data on your hard 
drive.
S pim  is a spam text message sent 
on a cell phone or an instant messaging 
service. In March 2008, a spim message 
was sent to more than 200 million mobile 
phone users in China during just one 
day.
Rogue program s, which have gained 
attention in the last five years, are not
harmful by themselves. Rather, they use 
a false advertisement or bogus malware 
scan results to scare you into purchasing a 
fake anti-malware program to remove the 
made-up security threats it claims to have 
found on your system (Figure 4.37).
A logic bomb is hidden computer 
code that does not replicate but sits dor­
mant on your system until a certain event 
or set of circumstances triggers it into 
action. That action, or payload, is usually 
malicious and devastating to your sys­
tem. An example of a trigger could be the 
removal of an employee from a database, 
an action implying that the employee has 
been terminated.
A tim e bomb is a hidden piece of 
computer code set to go off on some date 
and time in the future usually causing 
a malicious act to occur to your system. 
Time bombs are less sophisticated than 
logic bombs, because they are not pro­
grammed to be activated by a specific 
trigger.
A worm  is a program that resembles 
a computer virus because it can spread 
from one computer to another. Unlike a 
virus, however, a worm can propagate 
over a computer network and does not re­
quire an unsuspecting individual to open 
a file or execute a program or macro. It 
takes control of affected computers and 
uses their resources to attack other net­
work-connected systems. Newer worms

have begun infecting social networking 
sites such as MySpace and Facebook, re­
trieving user information and passwords 
and then directing users to phishing
sites.
A d en ia l o f service (DoS) a tta ck
is a form of network vandalism in which 
an attacker attempts to make network 
services unavailable to legitimate users 
of the service by bombarding the services 
with meaningless data. Because network 
administrators can easily block data from 
specific IP addresses and halt this type 
of attack, hackers commandeer as many 
unprotected computers—called zom bies— 
as possible to launch their attack swiftly 
and aggressively. The term zombie is 
appropriate because the computers do only 
what the controller, the zombie master, 
tells them to do (Figure 4.38). The com­
mandeered computers form a botn et, 
short for robot network, referred to as a 
zombie army. This, in turn, is controlled 
by a bot—short for robot—which is an 
automated program that connects the 
commandeered computers to the control­
ler. A controller is usually a server with 
some type of real time activity like Inter­
net Relay Chat that is under the power 
of a botnet controller—the initiator of the
attack. When multiple networked systems 
are involved in such an attack, it becomes 
a d istrib u ted  den ial o f service (DDoS) 
attack. Criminals also use botnets to 
send spam, host phishing attacks, and 
spread viruses and other malware. Syn 
flooding is a form of denial of service 
attack in which a hostile client repeatedly 
sends SYN (synchronization) packets to 
every port on the server, using fake IP 
addresses, which uses up all the available 
network connections and locks them up 
until they time out.
A rootkit is a malicious program 
disguised as a useful program; however, it 
enables the attacker to gain administrator- 
level access to a computer or network. 
Rootkits often facilitate the creation of a 
botnet by allowing an attacker repeated 
and undetected access to the compromised 
system.
A Trojan horse is a program 
disguised as a useful program, but 
instead, contains hidden instructions to 
perform a malicious task. Sometimes a Tro­
jan horse is disguised as a game or a utility 
program that you find appealing. Then, 
when you begin running the game, you 
discover that an entirely different program 
was loaded.

N EC  Japan released a new identification 
technology capable of detecting, in a mat­
ter of seconds, copies of videos illegally 
uploaded to the Internet. The problem of 
video copyright infringement has tradition­
ally been addressed by manual inspection. 
However, with the ever-growing quantity 
of pirated movies and TV programs, man­
ual detection is impossible. According to 
NEC, their new technology has a detection 
rate of 96 percent and an error rate of 5 in 
1 million. The technology uses a video's fin­
gerprint or signature generated from each 
frame of the video based on the difference 
in luminescence between subregions on
that frame. The signature of the suspected 
video is compared to the original, and an 
unauthorized duplicate is identified.
How do you feel about your uploaded 
videos automatically being scanned without 
your consent? Is it ethical? Are there ways 
this technology could be used that may not 
be as well intentioned? Because the sale, 
purchase, or even the use of pirated cop­
ies is illegal, how do you view this method 
of detection as a deterrent to piracy? Do 
you think this new technology is going to 
be enough to discourage the pirates, or 
will it just cause them to develop pirating 
techniques capable of circumventing this 
procedure?
Softw are p ira cy  occurs when you, 
without authorization, copy or distribute 
copyrighted software. This can be done by 
copying, downloading, sharing, selling, or 
installing multiple copies onto your per­
sonal or work computer. What you might 
not realize— or not think about—is that 
when you purchase software, you are actu­
ally purchasing a license to use it, not the 
actual software. That license is what tells 
you how many times you can legally 
install the software.
Piracy can be intentional or unin­
tentional. Regardless of intention, the 
Business Software Alliance (BSA), an anti­
piracy industry group, in its annual report 
issued on May 12, 2011, stated that the 
worldwide piracy rate doubled since 2003.
In dollars, that means that software theft 
exceeded $59 billion in commercial value.
The Prioritizing Resources and 
Organization for Intellectual Property 
(Pro-IP) Act of 2008 strengthens civil 
and criminal penalties for copyright and 
trademark infringement, substantially 
increases fines, and allows officials to 
confiscate equipment. W hat about shar­
ing programs without money changing 
hands? That is also illegal— and subject 
to similar penalties: Under the No Elec­
tronic Theft (N ET ) Act, profit does not 
have to be a motive in cases of criminal 
copyright infringement.

puters to perform crimes are detailed in

The use of Internet stock trading sites, 
chat rooms, and e-mail to give false praise 
to worthless companies in which an

the hacker manipulates his own packet 
header to mimic that of the trusted source. 
The recipient is tricked into responding to 
a false source.
Hacking goes beyond public sites.
A few years ago, a 23-year-old hacker 
known as RaFu downloaded about 43 M B 
of data from a top-security N ASA server, 
including a 15-slide PowerPoint presenta­
tion of a future shuttle design. Then he 
sent the plans to a Computerworld re­
porter as proof that the N ASA system was 
not secure. In many cases of hacking, the 
consequences can be damaging. Recogniz­
ing the danger, the federal government, 
through The United States Computer 
Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), 
lias emergency-response teams ready to 
fend oil'attacks on critical systems. Inter­
nationally, a group of security specialists 
are using honeypots—computers baited 
with fake data and purposely left vulner­
able—to study how intruders operate in 
order to prepare stronger defenses 
(Figure 4.41).
C rackers. also called black hats, 
are hackers who become obsessed—often 
uncontrollably—with gaining entry to 
highly secure computer systems. Their 
intent is to destroy data, steal informa­
tion, and perform other malicious acts. In 
June 2007, Chinese crackers were able to 
breach an unclassified e-mail system in 
the Department of Defense, affecting more 
than 1,500 users and shutting down the 
network for more than a week. In an at­
tack on the Epilepsy Foundation’s forums, 
crackers posted hundreds of pictures and
Other types of activities that use the 
Internet to advertise or hype their scam 
are shown in Figure 4.40.
Concept 4.16 Identifying 
the Attackers
A surprising variety of people can cause 
security problems, ranging from prank­
sters to hardened criminals. Some attack­
ers are out for ego gratification and do 
not intend any harm. Others are out for 
money, on a misguided crusade, or are just 
plain malicious.
Accessing someone’s computer without 
authorization is illegal, no matter what 
the motivation might be. H ackers are 
computer hobbyists who enjoy pushing 
computer systems—and themselves— to 
their limits. They experiment with pro­
grams to try to maximize performance and 
attack the weaknesses and loopholes in a 
system’s security with the goal of improv­
ing security and closing the gaps. Hackers 
subscribe to an unwritten code of conduct, 
called the hacker eth ic, which forbids 
the destruction of data. Cybergangs are 
groups of hackers working together to 
coordinate attacks, post online graffiti, 
or engage in other malicious conduct. IP 
spoofing , an activity associated with 
hackers, is done by sending a message 
with an IP  address disguised as an incom­
ing message from a trusted source. The 
hacker must first locate a packet header 
of a trusted source, a portion of an Inter­
net protocol packet that precedes its body. 
After a trusted packet header is located,

repeatedly harass or threaten a person

women, particularly women in college.

lifetime.
Cyberdating sites have become an­
other avenue for predators to locate new

profiling to match potential mates. The 
downside is that it is difficult to check 
someone’s cyberidentity against his or her 
actual identity because most are based on 
user-provided information (Figure 4.42).

FIG U RE 4.43 This survey 
used a random sample of 
approximately 4,000 youth 
between the ages of 12 and 
18 from a district in the south­
ern United States. Data was 
collected in February of 2010 
from 41 different schools.
C yberbu llyin g  involves situations 
in which one or more individuals harass 
or threaten another individual less capa­
ble of defending himself or herself by us­
ing the Internet or other forms of digital 
technology. Cyberbullying can include 
sending threatening e-mail or text mes­
sages or assuming someone else’s online 
identity for the purpose of humiliating or 
misrepresenting him or her. In a weird 
twist of fate, the woman who created a 
fake MySpace profile of a 16-year-old 
boy to start an Internet relationship 
with Megan Meier, the Missouri teen 
who hanged herself after receiving hurt­
ful messages, is now believed to be the 
victim of a cyberbullying impersonator 
herself. The online harassment laws that 
were passed after Meier’s death may now 
be used to help the middle-aged woman, 
who many believe was responsible for 
the 13-year-old girl’s suicide. This is not 
an isolated example. The Cyberbullying 
Research Center noted that 20 percent 
of the students they surveyed experi­
enced cyberbullying in their lifetime 
(Figure 4.43).
Now that you have examined the 
types of perpetrators who pose a risk to 
your online privacy and safety, in the 
next objective, you will look more closely 
at the growing risks to equipment and 
data security.
Objective 5 | Make 
Security a Priority
As the Production Manager at a comic book 
publisher, you are required to hold meet­
ings at hotels and conference centers away 
from corporate headquarters. At those 
meetings, you must use wireless networks 
that are not supported by your company. 
You want to write a memo to your team 
members regarding the security risks of 
logging into unsecured wireless networks 
and the necessity of installing a firewall on 
their portable devices. Where do you start?
Concept 4.17 Recognizing 
Security Risks
A com puter security risk is any event, 
action, or situation—intentional or not— 
that could lead to the loss or destruction 
of your computer system or the data it 
contains. Some research indicates that 
security breaches may cost billions of dol­
lars per year because of their impact on 
customer service, worker productivity, and 
production delay.
Wireless LANs—local area networks— 
pose a challenge to the security of your sys­
tems. H otspots, locations like a coffee shop 
or restaurant that provide Internet access 
for devices fitted with wireless technology,
Objective 5: Make Security a Priority | G O ! All In One

are especially unsecure. Unlike wired 
networks, which send traffic over private 
dedicated lines, wireless LANs send traffic 
across shared space— airwaves. Because 
no one owns the space that airwaves travel 
across, the opportunity for interference 
from other traffic is great, and the need for 
additional security is essential.
Security methods for wireless networks 
include WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), 
WPA (W iFi Protected Access), and WPA2. 
W E P  was the earliest of the three and has 
several well-known weaknesses, but it may 
be the only option for some devices or for 
older equipment. W PA was developed to 
provide a stronger level of security, and 
W PA2 improves on W PA ’s abilities. WPA2 
provides confidentiality and data integrity 
and is far superior to W E P  because it uses 
A E S  (Advanced Encryption Standard) to 
provide government-grade security. The 
need for wireless security is great, and 
more powerful security systems continue to 
be developed. If you access a wireless net­
work, you should implement the security 
that is currently available so your system is 
at least protected from the casual hacker.
A new trend in Internet fraud is vaca­
tion hacking. Travelers are targeted by 
cybercriminals who create a phony W iFi hot 
spot, called an evil tw in, with names simi­
lar to a legitimate airport, hotel, or fast food 
hot spot. Ifyou are on an evil twin and enter 
personal information, like a bank account 
number and password, your information 
will be captured by the evil twin’s develop­
ers and can be used to access your account.
According to one estimate, 80 percent 
of all data loss is caused by company 
insiders. Unlike intruders, employees
have many opportunities to sabotage a 
company’s computer system, often in ways 
that are difficult to trace. Although incom­
ing e-mail is routinely scanned for threats, 
outgoing mail is often overlooked, allowing 
employees to easily transfer data. Simi­
larly, employees can p o d  slu rp —use U SB  
drives, iPods, or other removable storage 
media to create an unauthorized copy of 
confidential data. Employees can also cre­
ate trap doors—security holes through 
which they can reenter, without authen­
tication, after leaving the firm. Steps that 
companies can perform to deter data loss 
are listed in the table in Figure 4.44.
The espionage threat goes beyond na­
tional borders. Nations bent on acquiring 
trade secrets are always trying to break 
into corporate and government computer 
systems. According to a recent estimate, 
the governments of more than 125 coun­
tries are actively involved in industrial 
espionage. Congress enacted the Economic 
Espionage Act of 1996 to help companies 
protect themselves. But many companies 
do not take advantage of the Act, except as 
a last resort. Companies worry that news of 
such a theft may damage their reputation. 
To view a segment of an award-winning 
video on industrial espionage titled “The 
Red Balloon," go to www.tscmvideo.com/.
The use of information technologies to 
corrupt or destroy an enemy’s information 
and industrial infrastructure is called infor­
mation warfare. A concerted enemy attack 
would include electronic warfare, which is 
the use of electronic devices to destroy or 
damage computer systems; network 
warfare, which is hacker-like attacks on a 
nation’s network infrastructure, including

tural sabotage, which is attacks on com­
puter systems that support transportation, 
finance, energy, and telecommunications. A 
country’s information can also be destroyed 
by an attack with actual explosive bombs di­
rected at computer centers. According to one 
expert, a well-coordinated bombing of only 
100 key computer installations could bring 
the U.S. economy to a halt.
Once every two years, the DHS and 
US-CERT coordinate a national simulation 
known as Cyber Storm to assess the ability 
of the United States to identify mid respond 
to a critical cyberattack. Cyber Storm III, 
held in September 2010, involved 8 cabinet 
level departments, 11 states, 12 interna­
tional partners, and 60 private sector com­
panies. The exercise simulated an attack on 
telecommunication centers, the Internet, and 
control systems and examined participants’ 
strategic decision making ability in accor­
dance with national procedure (Figure 4.45).
Concept 4.18 Protecting Your 
Computer System
Several measures can safeguard computer 
systems, but none of them can make a com­
puter system 100 percent secure. A trade-off
exists between security and usability: The 
more restrictions imposed by security tools, 
the less useful the system can become:
Power surges caused by lightning storms 
or fluctuations in electrical currents and 
power outages can destroy sensitive elec­
tronic components mid result in data loss.
You should use an uninterruptible power 
supply (UPS), which is a batteiy-powered 
device that provides power to your computer 
for a limited time when it detects an outage 
or critical voltage drop, to safeguard 
your equipment and data (Figure 
4.46). Many companies have electric 
generators to run large-scale computer 
systems when the power fails.
Because many security problems 
originate with stolen passwords, 
strong passwords and user authen­
tication are required to control au­
thorized access to computer systems.
The most secure authentication 
approach is biom etric au th en tica­
tio n . the use of a physical trait like 
hand geometry or a retinal scan to 
identify an individual (Figure 4.47).
A firewall is a computer pro­
gram or device that permits your com­
puter to access the Internet but severely 
limits the ability of outsiders to access

puter for a limited time during

implement a firewall through software, 
hardware, or a combination of both. Fire­
walls are a necessity, but they provide 
no protection against insider pilferage.

Concept 4.19 Safeguarding 
Yourself and Your Data
Besides protecting your system from intru­
sion or attack, it is just as important to 
shield your personal data from thefl and 
yourself from a cyberattack. Following the 
old cliches of the real world, such as Don't 
talk to strangers and If someth ing sounds
Communications leaving a 
network exists freely.
Communications entering network from an outside 
network must first pass firewall security options.
Objective 6 | Encrypt 
Data
In your job as a Production Manager at a 
comic book publishing company, you just 
learned that the company’s computers 
experienced a security breach. Your super­
visor wants all communications between 
managers and their support team mem­
bers to be encrypted. You need to convey 
this information to all team members and 
include additional information on public 
key encryption, how it works, and why it is 
important. Where do you start?
Encryption refers to a coding or scram­
bling process that renders a message unread­
able by anyone except the intended recipient. 
Until recently, encryption was used only by 
intelligence services, banks, and the military.
E-commerce requires strong, unbreak­
able encryption; otherwise, money could 
not be safely exchanged over the Internet. 
But now, powerful encryption software is 
available to the public, and U.S. law en­
forcement officials and defense agencies 
are concerned. Criminals, including drug 
dealers and terrorists, can use encryption 
to hide their activities. In the aftermath of 
the September 11 terrorist attacks, U.S. 
officials revealed that the terrorist net­
work had used encrypted e-mail to keep 
their plans and activities secret.
Concept 4.20 j Understanding 
Encryption Basics
To understand encryption, 
try this simple exercise: 
Consider a short message 
such as I love you. Before 
it is encrypted, a readable 
message such as this one is 
in plaintext—information 
a sender wants to send to 
someone. To encrypt the 
message, take each char­
acter and substitute the 
letter that is 13 positions to 
that character’s right in the 
26-letter alphabet. When you 
reach the end of the alpha­
bet, continue counting from 
the beginning. This is an 
example of an encryption 
key, a formula that makes a
160 
GO! All In One | Chapter 4: Computer Hardware, Privacy, and Security

plaintext message unreadable. After applying 
the key, you get the coded message, which is 
now in ciphertext—the result of encryption 
performed on plaintext. The ciphertext ver­
sion of the original message looks like this:
V  Y B I R  LB H
Of course this string of characters 
makes no sense; that is the purpose. No one 
who intercepts this message will know what 
it means. Your intended recipient, however, 
can tell what the message means if you 
give him or her the decoding key, in this in­
stance, counting 13 characters down (Figure 
4.49). When your recipient gets the message 
and decrypts it, your message displays as:
I  LO V E  YOU
With sym m etric key encryption, the
same key is used for encryption and decryp­
tion. Some of the keys used by banks and 
military agencies are so complex that the 
world’s most powerful computer would have 
to analyze the ciphertext for several hun­
dred years to discover the key. However, 
there is one way to defeat symmetric key 
encryption: stealing the key, which is known 
as key interception. Banks deliver decryp­
tion keys using trusted courier services; the 
military uses trusted personnel or agents.
Concept 4.21 
Using Public Key 
Encryption
Public key encryption is considered one of 
the greatest and also most troubling scien­
tific achievements of the twentieth century. 
Public key encryption, also called asym ­
m etric key encryption, is a computer se­
curity process in which two different keys
are used. There is an encryption key— 
referred to as the pu blic key—and a de­
cryption key— referred to as the priva te 
key. The use of two different keys safe­
guards data and provides confidentiality. 
The way it works is that people who want 
to receive secret messages publish their 
public key, for example, by placing it on a 
Web page or sending it to those with whom 
they want to communicate. When the pub­
lic key is used to encrypt a message, the 
message becomes unreadable. The message 
becomes readable only when the recipi­
ent applies his or her private key, which 
nobody else knows, and thus guarantees 
confidentiality (Figure 4.50).
Public key encryption is essential for 
e-commerce. For example, when you visit a 
secure site on the Web, your Web browser 
provides your public key to the Web 
server. In turn, the Web server provides 
the site’s public key to your Web browser. 
After a secure communication channel is 
created, your browser displays a distinc­
tive icon, such as a lock in the address bar; 
or, the address bar may turn green. Now 
you can supply confidential information, 
such as your credit card number, with a 
reasonable degree of confidence that this 
information will not be intercepted while it 
is traveling across the Internet.
You can use public key encryption to 
implement digital signatures, a technique 
that guarantees a message has not been 
tampered with. Digital signatures are im­
portant to e-commerce because they enable 
computers to determine whether a received 
message or document is authentic and in 
its original form. A digital signature can be 
compared to the sealing of an envelope with 
a personal wax seal. Anyone can open the en­
velope, but the seal authenticates the sender.

Public key encryption also enables 
d ig ita l certificates—a method of 
validating a user, server, or Web site.
For a user, a digital certificate validates 
identity in a manner similar to showing a 
driver’s license when you cash a check. For 
example, to protect both merchants and 
customers from online credit card fraud, 
Visa, MasterCard, and American Express 
collaborated to create an online shopping 
security standard for merchants and cus­
tomers called secure electronic tran sac­
tion (SET) that uses digital certificates. 
They enable parties engaged in Internet- 
mediated transactions to confirm each 
other’s identity. For a server or Web site, 
a digital certificate validates that the Web 
server or Web site is authentic, and the 
user can feel secure that his or her inter­
action with the Web site has no eaves­
droppers and that the Web site is what it 
claims to be. This security is important 
for electronic commerce sites, especially 
ones that accept credit cards as a form of 
payment.
Objective 7 | Identify 
Technologies That 
Prosecute Computer 
Crime
In your job as a Production Manager for 
a comic book company, another manager 
informed you that a document related to a 
change in the layout of one of the compa­
ny’s projects was forwarded to an individ­
ual at a competitive firm who also happens 
to be one of your clients. You want to write 
an e-mail to members of your project group 
regarding the importance of document 
security. You want to make them aware of 
the irreversibility of actions like forward­
ing an e-mail to an inappropriate party. 
Where do you start?
Concept 4.22 Defining 
E-Discovery
E-discovery, an abbreviated term for elec­
tronic discovery, is the process in which 
documents that exist in electronic form are 
searched for, located, and obtained for the 
purpose of being used in a civil or criminal 
case. Electronic documents include e-mails, 
voice mails, instant messages, e-calendars, 
audio files, data on handheld devices, ani­
mation, metadata, graphics, photographs, 
spreadsheets, Web sites, drawings, and 
other types of digital data. E-discovery is 
a $2 billion industry, and qualified profes­
sionals are in demand. E-discovery profes­
sionals use technology to identify, collect, 
process, review, and produce electronic evi­
dence usable in court cases.
Concept 4.23 Investigating 
Computer Forensics
Computer forensics, a complex branch of 
forensic science, pertains to legal evidence 
found in computers and digital storage me­
dia. This field requires careful preparation 
and procedural strictness. Because of the 
scope and technical requirements of this 
field, there are many subsections such as 
firewall forensics and mobile device forensics. 
However, all have the same purposes: to ana­
lyze computer systems related to court cases, 
evaluate a computer after a break-in. recover 
lost data, and gather evidence against an 
employee by an employer. Software develop­
ers have created several forensic tool kits to 
help in the logical and procedural accumula­
tion of evidence in this field. These kits spell 
out proper procedure and contain forms to 
correctly document every action and event 
involving a piece of digital evidence, guaran­
teeing its authenticity, accuracy, and thus its 
reliability as evidence.

Chapter Summary
Computer Hardware, Privacy, 
and Security
• There are two major categories of computers: 
computers for individuals and those for organiza­
tions. Types of computers for individuals include 
personal computers (PCs), desktop computers, all- 
in-one computers, notebooks, subnotebooks, tablet 
PCs, and handheld computers including PDAs and 
smartphones. Types of computers for organizations 
include professional workstations, servers, mini­
computers, mainframes, and supercomputers.
• Computers have advantages and disadvantages. 
Advantages include speed, memory, storage, hard­
ware reliability, accuracy, and assistance to those 
with disabilities. Disadvantages include informa­
tion overload, expense, data inaccuracy, unreliable 
software, viruses, software piracy, identity theft, 
loss of jobs, and health problems.
• The use of social networking sites such as Face­
book, MySpace, Linkedln, and Twitter is growing 
daily. Businesses realize the power of such sites 
and use them to analyze their customers, keep an 
eye on competitors, and connect customers with 
their brand.
• Computers are creating new job opportunities, 
shifting labor demand toward skilled workers, 
helping people complete their work, freeing work­
ers from occupations with hazardous working con­
ditions, making workflow safer and more efficient, 
and increasing productivity.
• Being a responsible computer user means respect­
ing others when using technology and sharing 
resources, recycling computer hardware, being
aware of technology overuse, and staying informed 
about changing technology and its effect on the 
environment.
• Sensitive personal information, such as Social 
Security numbers, can be collected through 
cookies and embedded R F ID  tags without in­
forming the owner and countering your right of 
anonymity.
• Computer crimes include identity theft; malware, 
including spyware and viruses; rogue programs, 
time bombs, logic bombs, worms, botnets, zombies, 
and Trojan horses; fraud and theft; password theft; 
salami shaving and data diddling; forgery and 
blackmail; cyberstalking and cyberbullying. Inter­
net crimes— cybercrime— include shilling, rip and 
tear, pump and dump, and bogus goods.
• Computer criminals include hackers, crackers, 
cybergangs, virus authors, swindlers, shills, cyber­
stalkers, cyberbullies, and sexual predators.
• No computer system is totally secure, but using 
safe surfing guides, an uninterruptible power sup­
ply (U PS), strong passwords, biometric authentica­
tion, encryption of sensitive data, and an installed 
firewall are all ways to increase your computer 
security.
• Encryption, essential for e-commerce and online 
banking, makes use of encryption keys to encode 
and decode information traveling over a network 
making it unreadable by anyone except the in­
tended recipient.
• Electronic discovery and computer forensics are 
both facilitating the detection, apprehension, and 
conviction of cybercriminals.

Teamwork
1. E rg o n o m ics As a team, use a search engine to 
locate three Web sites that contain information 
about the ergonomics of setting up computer work­
stations. Prepare a report that covers the following:
1) define the term ergonomics, and then list five 
items that should be ergonomically designed in a 
computer station for the user’s health and comfort;
2) for three of the five items, find two retailers that 
sell suitable ergonomic products; 3) describe the 
products, explain how they will ergonomically cor­
rect or prevent a problem, and the cost. Cite your 
information sources.
2. D atab ase S e c u r ity  As a team, develop a list of 
ten databases that team members use within a 
given week. Ask each team member to rank his or 
her login name and password for each database as 
strong, mild, or weak based on what you studied 
in this chapter. Additionally, ask each team mem­
ber when he or she last changed passwords. Collect 
this information and organize it in a Word table or 
Excel worksheet. Summarize your findings on the 
use of databases, strength of passwords, and fre­
quency of password changes below your table of 
data. Do you think your findings are representative 
of your age group and region as a whole?
3. E le c tr o n ic  M o n ito r in g  Traffic congestion in 
Hong Kong is a serious concern to commuters, en­
vironmentalists concerned about air-born pollu­
tion, and the government’s Transport Department. 
Certain areas of the city that draw tourists get ex­
tremely congested at peak times during the day. 
One suggested solution is to charge the owners of 
private cars to drive in these tourist zones during 
peak times. Registered car owners would display 
a scannable chip in the car’s windshield, and then 
the chip would be scanned when a vehicle enters a 
restricted zone and the individual would be billed. 
Extensive use of these roads could also result in ad­
ditional charges for overuse. As a team, list three 
positive aspects of this system and three negative 
aspects. Discuss how this system might invade the 
privacy of a driver. Identify any barriers that might 
deter this plan. Report your team’s stand on the 
plan in a one-page, double-spaced report.
On the Web
1. C le a n , Q u a r a n tin e , or D e le te ?  Investigate 
three antivirus programs; state the options each 
provides, especially any option other than clean, 
quarantine, or delete; and then explain what each 
option actually does to the infected file. Determine 
the type of malware each option is best suited to 
contain. Present your research in a PowerPoint 
presentation of five to ten slides. Remember to cite 
the sources of your information.
2. Red F lags R u les Use a search engine to find in­
formation about the Red Flags Rules, which require 
financial institutions and creditors to develop and 
implement identity theft programs. Explain three 
components of the rules, who must comply, and any 
flexibility that there might be in this policy. Pres­
ent your findings and cite the sources of your infor­
mation in a one-page, double-spaced report.
3. P resid en t’s T ask F orce on Id en tity  T heft Use
a search engine to identify the year that the Presi­
dent’s Task Force on Identity Theft was created. 
What was the mission of this organization? Who 
are the members? What has the task force accom­
plished since its inception? Present your findings in 
a one-page, double-spaced report.

the video, use a search engine to locate sources of 
information about how to dispose of e-waste prop­
erly. List three options that your community, local 
retailers, or nonprofit organizations provide. Indi­
cate if their advertisements or Web pages display the 
environmental problems associated with improper 
disposal. Include such topics as fees associated for 
disposal, designated drop-off sites, and the method 
that each uses to dispose of collected e-waste. Pres­
ent this information in a one- or two-page, double­
spaced report.

of Facebook or another popular social media site. 
Describe two security breaches involving social net­
working sites that occurred in the last two years 
and how long it took to identify them. Find statis­
tics on the amount of information that was com­
promised and the response that the manager of 
the site issued. As a team, come to a consensus on 
the initial statement in this question: Are privacy 
and social networking incompatible? In a one-page, 
double-spaced paper, respond to the question.

Objective 2 | Enter and Edit Text in an Office 2010
Program
All of the programs in Office 2010 require some typed text. Your keyboard is still the 
primary method of entering information into your computer. Techniques to edit— make 
changes to— text are similar among all of the Office 2010 programs.
Activity 5.02 
Entering and Editing Text in an Office 2010 Program
1 
In the middle of the PowerPoint Slide pane, point to the text Click to add title to display the |_kj pointer, and 
then click one time.
The insertion point—a blinking vertical line that indicates where text or graphics will be inserted—displays.
In Office 2010 programs, the mouse pointer—any symbol that displays on your screen in response to moving your 
mouse device—displays in different shapes depending on the task you are performing and the area of the screen to 
which you are pointing.
2  Type Oceana Grille Info and notice how the insertion point moves to the right as you type. Point slightly to the 
right of the letter e in Grille and click to place the insertion point there.
3  
On your keyboard, locate and press the [Backspace) key to delete the letter e.
Pressing [Backspace] removes a character to the left ot the insertion point.
4 
Point slightly to the left of the / in Info and click one time to place the insertion point there. Type Menu and 
then press [Spacebar] one time. Compare your screen with Figure 5.4.
By default, when you type text in an Office program, existing lext moves to the right to make space for new typing. 
Default refers to the current selection or setting that is automatically used by a program unless you specify otherwise.

Press [Delete) four times to delete Info and then type Plan
Pressing (beletel removes—deletes—a character to the right of the insertion point.
6 W ith your insertion point blinking after the word Plan, on your keyboard, hold down the [Ctrll key. While 
holding down (CtrQ, press @  three times to move the insertion point to the beginning of the word Grill.
This is a keyboard shortcut—a key or combination of keys that performs a task that would otherwise require 
a mouse. This keyboard shortcut moves the insertion point to the beginning of the previous word. A keyboard 
shortcut is commonly indicated as [Ctrl] + Q  (or some other combination of keys) to indicate that you hold down the 
first key while pressing the second key.
7 
W ith the insertion point blinking at the beginning of the word Grill, type Palm and press [Spacebar].
8 Click anywhere in the text Click to add subtitle. W ith the insertion point blinking, type the following and 
include the spelling error: Prepered by Annabel Dunham
9  
W ith your mouse, point slightly to the left of the A in Annabel, hold down the left mouse button, and then 
drag—hold down the left mouse button while moving your mouse— to the right to select the text Annabel 
Dunham, and then release the mouse button. Compare your screen with Figure 5.5.
The Mini toolbar displays commands that are commonly used with the selected object, which places common 
commands close to your pointer. When you move the pointer away from the Mini toolbar, it fades from view.
To select refers to highlighting, by dragging with your mouse, areas of text or data or graphics so that the selection 
can be edited, formatted, copied, or moved. The action of dragging includes releasing the left mouse button at the 
end of the area you want to select. The Office programs recognize a selected area as one unit, to which you can make 
changes.

10 With the text Annabel Dunham selected, type your own firstname and lastname.
In any Windows-based program, such as the Microsolt Office 2010 programs, selected text is deleted and then 
replaced when you begin to type new text. You will save time by developing good techniques to select and then 
edit or replace selected text, which is easier than pressing the iDeletel key numerous times to delete text that you do 
not want.

11 Notice that the misspelled word Prcpered displays with a wavy red underline; additionally, all or part of your 
name might display with a wavy red underline.
Office 2010 has a dictionary of words against which all entered text is checked. In Word and PowerPoint, words 
that are not in the dictionary display a wavy red line, indicating a possible misspelled word or a proper name or an 
unusual word—none of which are in the Office 2010 dictionary.
12 Point to Prcpered and then right-click—dick your right mouse button one time.
The Mini toolbar and a shortcut menu display. A shortcut menu displays commands and options relevant to the 
selected text or object—known as context-sensitive commands because they relate to the item you right-clicked.
Here, the shortcut menu displays commands related to the misspelled word. You can click the suggested correct 
spelling Prepared, click Ignore All to ignore the misspelling, add the word to the Office dictionary, or click Spelling 
to display a dialog box. A dialog box is a small window that contains options for completing a task. Whenever you 
see a command followed by an ellipsis (...), which is a set of three dots indicating incompleteness, clicking the 
command will always display a dialog box.
13 On the displayed shortcut menu, click Prepared to correct the misspelled word. If necessary, point to any 
parts of your name that display a wavy red underline, right-click, and then on the shortcut menu, click Ignore 
All so that Office will no longer mark your name with a wavy underline in this file.
Objective 3 | Perform Commands from a Dialog Box
In a dialog box, you make decisions about an individual object or topic. A dialog box 
also offers a way to adjust a number of settings at one time.
Activity 5.03 
Performing Commands from a Dialog Box

Objective 4 | Create a Folder, Save a File, and Close 
a File
A location is any disk drive, folder, or other place in which you can store files and 
folders. Where you store your files depends on how and where you use your data. For 
example, for your classes, you might decide to store primarily on a removable USB flash 
drive so that you can carry your files with you. Although the Windows operating system 
helps you to create and maintain a logical folder structure, take the time to name your files 
and folders in a consistent manner.
o

Activity 5.04 
Creating a Folder, Saving a File, and Closing a File
Office 2010 programs use a common dialog box provided by the Windows operating system to assist you in 
saving files. In this activity, you will create a folder on a U SB flash drive in which to store files. If you prefer to 
store on your hard drive, you can use similar steps to store files in your Documents library.
Insert a USB flash drive into your computer, and if necessary, Close 
the AutoPlay dialog box. If you are 
not using a USB flash drive, go to Step 2.
As the first step in saving a file, determine where you want to save the file, and if necessary, insert a storage device.
At the top of your screen, in the title bar, notice that Presentation I - Microsoft PowerPoint displays.
Most Office 2010 programs open with a new unsaved file with a default name—Presentation/, Documents and 
so on. As you create your file, your work is temporarily stored in the computer's memory until you initiate a Save 
command, at which time you must choose a tile name and location in which to save your file.

In the upper left corner of your screen, click the File tab to display Microsoft Office Backstage view. Compare 
your screen with Figure 5.8.
Microsoft Office Backstage view is a centralized space for tasks related to file management; that is why the tab is 
labeled File. File management tasks include, for example, opening, saving, printing, publishing, or sharing a file.
The Backstage tabs—Info, Recent, New, Print, Save & Send, and Help—display along the left side. The tabs group 
file-related tasks together.
Above the Backstage tabs, Quick Commands—Save, Save As, Open, and Close—display for quick access to these 
commands. When you click any of these commands, Backstage view closes and either a dialog box displays or the 
active file closes.
Here, the Info tab displays information—info—about the current file. In the center panel, various file management 
tasks are available in groups. For example, if you click the Protect Presentation button, a list of options that you can 
set for this file that relate to who can open or edit the presentation displays.
On the Info tab, in the right panel, you can also examine the document properties. Document properties, also known 
as metadata, are details about a file that describe or identify it, such as the title, author name, subject, and keywords 
that identify the document’s topic or contents. On the Info page, a thumbnail image of the current file displays in the 
upper right corner, which yon can click lo close Backstage view and return to the document.

Above the Backstage tabs, click Save to display the Save As dialog box.
Backstage view closes and the Save As dialog box, which includes a folder window and an area at the bottom to 
name the file and set the file type, displays. When you are saving something for the first time, for example a new 
PowerPoint presentation, the Save and Save As commands are identical. That is, the Save As dialog box will display 
if you click Save or ifyou click Save As.
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------\
N ote | Saving Your File
After you have named a file and saved it in your desired location, the Save command saves any changes you make to the file without displaying 
any dialog box. The Save As command will display the Save As dialog box and let you name and save a new file based on the current one— in 
a location that you choose. After you name and save the new document, the original document closes, and the new document 
based on the 
original one— displays.

is stored displays. Above the Backstage tabs, click Close to close the file. In the message box, click Save to save 
the changes you made and close the file. Leave PowerPoint open.

Objectives | Add Document Properties and Print a 
File
The process of printing a file is similar in all of the Office applications. There are 
differences in the types of options you can select. For example, in PowerPoint, you have 
the option of printing the full slide, with each slide printing on a full sheet of paper, or of 
printing handouts with small pictures of slides on a page.

Companion Web Site 
or in MylTI.ab
Activity 5.05 
Adding Document Properties and Printing a File
| Are You Printing or Submitting Your Files Electronically?
Ifyou are submitting your files electronically only, or have no printer attached, you can still complete this activity. Complete Steps l -9, and then 
submit your file electronically as directed by your instructor.
1 
In the upper left corner, click the File tab to display Backstage view. Notice that the Recent tab displays.
Because no file was open in PowerPoint, Office applies predictive logic to determine that your most likely action will 
be to open a PowerPoint presentation that you worked on recently. Thus, the Recent tab displays a list of PowerPoint 
presentations that were recently open on your system.
2  
At the top of the Recent Presentations list, click your Lastname_Firstnanie_5A_Menu_Plan file to open it.
3 
Click the File tab to redisplay Backstage view. On the right, under the screen thumbnail, click Properties, and 
then click Show Document Panel. In the Author box, delete the existing text, and then type your firstname and 
lastname. Notice that in PowerPoint, some variation of the slide title is automatically inserted in the Title box. 
In the Subject box, type your Course name and section number. In the Keywords box, type menu plan and 
then in the upper right corner oi the Document Properties panel, click the Close the Document Information 
Panel button
Adding properties to your documents will make them easier to search for in systems such as Microsoft SharePoint.
4  
Redisplay Backstage view, and then click the Print tab. Compare your screen with Figure 5.12.
On the Print tab in Backstage view, in the center panel, three groups of printing-related tasks display—Print, Printer, 
and Settings. In the right panel, the Print Preview displays, which is a view' of a document as it will appear on the 
papier when you print it. At the bottom of the Print Preview area, on the left, the number of pages and arrows with
which you can move among the pages in Print Preview display. On the right, Zoom settings enable you to shrink or 
enlarge the Print Preview. Zoom is the action of increasing or decreasing the viewing area of the screen.

From Backstage view, you can save an Office file as a PD F file. Portable Document Format (P D F ) creates an image of your file that preserves the 
look of your file, but that cannot be easily changed. This is a popular format for sending documents electronically, because the document will 
display on most computers. From Backstage view, click Save & Send, and then in the File Types group, click Create PDF/XPS Document. Then

Memo
TO:
Laura Mabry Hernandez, General Manager
FROM:
Donna Jackson, Executive Chef
DATE:
December 17, 2014
SUBJECT:
Cheese Specials on Tuesdays
To increase restaurant traffic between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., I am proposing a trial cheese event In 
one of the restaurants, probably Orlando. I would like to try a weekly event on Tuesday evenings 
where the focus Is on a good selection of cheese.
I envision two possibilities: a selection of cheese plates or a cheese bar—or both. The cheeses would 
have to be matched with compatible fruit and bread or crackers They could be used as appetizers, or 
for desserts, as Is common in Europe The cheese plates should be varied and diverse, using a mixture of 
hard and soft, sharp and mild, unusual and familiar
I am excited about this new promotion. If done properly, I think It could increase restaurant traffic in the 
hours when individuals want to relax with a small snack instead of a heavy dinner.
The promotion will require that our employees become familiar with the types and characteristics of 
both foreign and domestic cheeses. Let's meet to discuss the details and the training requirements, and 
to create a flyer that begins something like this:
Oceana Palm Grill Tuesday Cheese Tastings

Objective 6 I Open an Existing File and Save It with 
a New Name
In any Office program, use the Open command to display the Open dialog box, from 
which you can navigate to and then open an existing file that was created in that same 
program. The Open dialog box, along with the Save and Save As dialog boxes, are referred 
to as common dialog boxes. These dialog boxes, which are provided by the Windows 
programming interface, display in all of the Office programs in the same manner. Thus, the 
Open, Save, and Save As dialog boxes will all look and perform the same in each Office program.
Activity 5.06 
Opening an Existing File and Saving It with a New Name
In this activity, you will display the Open dialog box, open an existing W ord document, and then save it in 
your storage location with a new name.

| Do You See a Message to Enable Editing or Enable Content?
In Office 2010, some files open in Protected View if the file appears to be from a potentially risky location, such as the Internet. Protected View 
is a new security feature in Office 2010 that protects your computer from malicious files by opening them in a restricted environment until you 
enable them. Trusted Documents is another security feature that remembers which files you have already enabled. You might encounter these 
security features ifyou open a file from an e-mail or download files from the Internet. So long as you trust the source of the file, click Enable 
Editing or Enable Content—depending on the type of file you receive—and then go ahead and work with the file.
5 
Click the File tab to display Backstage view, and then click the Save As command to display the Save As 
dialog box.
The Save As command displays the Save As dialog box where you can name and save a new document based on the 
currently displayed document. After you name and save the new document, the original document closes, and the 
new document—based on the original one—displays.
6 
Navigate to the location in which you are storing your projects for this chapter— the location where you 
created your All in One Chapter 5 folder. In the file list, double-click the necessary folders and subfolders until 
your All in One Chapter 5 folder displays in the address bar.
7 
Click in the File name box to select the existing file name, or drag to select the existing text, and then using 
your own name, type Lastname Firstname_5B_Cheese_Promotion
As you type, the file name from your 5A project might display briefly. Because your 5A project file is stored in this 
location and you began the new file name with the same text, Office predicts that you might w'ant the same or similar 
file name. As you type new characters, the suggestion is removed.
8 
In the lower right corner of the Save As dialog box, click Save; or press (Biterl. Compare your screen with Figure 5.17.
The original document closes, and your new document, based on the original, displays with the name in the title bar.

Objective 8 | Perform Commands from the Ribbon
The Ribbon, which displays across the top of the program window, groups commands 
and features in a manner that you would most logically use them. Each Office program's 
Ribbon is slightly different, but all contain the same three elements: tabs, groups, and 
commands. Tabs display across the top of the Ribbon, and each tab relates to a type of 
activity; for example, laying out a page. Groups are sets of related commands for specific 
tasks. Commands— instructions to computer programs— are arranged in groups, and 
might display as a button, a menu, or a box in which you type information.

15 On the Ribbon, under Picture Tools, click the Format tab.
| The Size of Groups on the Ribbon Varies with Screen Resolution
Your monitor's screen resolution might be set higher than the resolution used to capture the figures in this book. At a higher resolution, the 
Ribbon expands some groups to show more commands than are available with a single click, such as those in the Picture Styles group. Or, the 
group expands to add descriptive text to some buttons, such as those in the Arrange group. Regardless of your screen resolution, all Office com­
mands are available to you. In higher resolutions, you will have a more robust view of the commands.
16 In the Picture Styles group, point to the first style to display the ScreenTip Simple Frame, White, and notice 
that the image displays with a white frame. Watch the image as you point to the second picture style, and 
then to the third, and then to the fourth.
This is Live Preview, a technology that shows the result ol applying an editing or formatting change as you point to 
possible results—before you actually apply it.
17 In the Picture Styles group, click the fourth style— Drop Shadow Rectangle—and then click anywhere outside 
of the image to deselect it. Notice that the Picture Tools no longer display on the Ribbon. Compare your

On the Ribbon, click the Home tab, and then in the Paragraph group, click the Center button [* ] to center the 
paragraph.
Alignment refers to the placement of paragraph text relative to the left and right margins. Center alignment refers to 
text that is centered horizontally between the left and right margins. You can also align text at the left margin, which 
is the default alignment for text in Word, or at the right margin.
3  
On the Home tab, in the Font group, click the Font button arrow
At the top of the list, point to
Cambria, and as you do so, notice that the selected text previews in the Cambria font.
A font is a set of characters with the same design and shape. The default font in a Word document is Calibri, which 
is a sans serif font—a font design with no lines or extensions on the ends of characters. The Cambria font is a serif 
font—a font design that includes small line extensions on the ends of the letters to guide the eye in reading from left 
to right.
The list of fonts displays as a gallery showing potential results. For example, in the Font gallery, you can see the 
actual design and format of each font as it would look if applied to text.
4  
Point to several other fonts and observe the effect on the selected text. Then, at the top of the Font gallery, 
under Theme Fonts, click Cambria.
A theme is a predesigned set of colors, fonts, lines, and t ill effects that look good together and that can be applied to 
your entire document or to specific items. A theme combines two sets of fonts—one for text and one for headings. In 
the default Office theme, Cambria is the suggested font for headings.

lrom the paragraph where the insertion point is positioned. Information about the Format Painter and how to turn 
it off displays in the status bar.

copy. When you copy text or graphics, a copy is placed on the Office Clipboard and the original text or graphic 
remains in place. When you cut text or graphics, a copy is placed on the Office Clipboard, and the original text or 
graphic is removed— cut— from the document. After cutting or copying, the contents of the Office Clipboard are 
available for you to paste—insert— in a new location in the current document, or into another Office file.

paragraph.
2 On the Insert tab, in the Illustrations group, click the Picture button. In the Insert Picture dialog box, navigate 
to your student data files, locate and click jpg05C^Rock_Climber, and then click Insert.
Word inserts the picture as an inline object; that is, the picture is positioned directly in the text at the insertion point, 
just like a character in a sentence. Sizing handles surround the picture indicating it is selected.
3 
If necessary, scroll to view the entire picture. Notice the round and square sizing handles around the border 
of the selected picture, as shown in Figure 5.47.
The round corner sizing handles resize the graphic proportionally. The square sizing handles resize a graphic 
vertically or horizontally only; however, sizing with these will distort the graphic. A green rotate handle, with which 
you can rotate the graphic to any angle, displays above the top center sizing handle.

Activity 5.19 
Wrapping Text Around a Picture
Graphics inserted as inline objects are treated like characters in a sentence, which can result in unattractive 
spacing. You can change an inline object to a floating object— a graphic that can be moved independently of the 
surrounding text characters.
1 
Be sure the picture is selected—you know it is selected if the sizing handles display. On the Format tab, in the 
Arrange group, click the Wrap Text button to display a gallery of text wrapping arrangements.
Text wrapping refers to the manner in which text displays around an object.

Activity 5.29 
Aligning Text
Alignment refers to the placement of paragraph text relative to the left and right margins. Most paragraph text 
uses left alignment— aligned at the left margin, leaving the right margin uneven. Three other types of paragraph 
alignment are: center alignment—centered between the left and right margins; right alignment— aligned at the 
right margin with an uneven left margin; and justified alignment— text aligned evenly at both the left and right 
margins. See the table in Figure 5.62.
r 
—* 
Paragraph Alignment Options
Alignment
Button
Description and Example
Align Text Left
Align Text Left is the default paragraph alignment in Word. Text in the paragraph aligns 
at the left margin, and the right margin is uneven.
Center
m
Center alignment aligns text in the paragraph so that it is centered between the left and
right margins.
Align Text Right
a
Align Text Right aligns text at the right margin. Using Align Text Right, the left margin,
which is normally even, is uneven.
Justify
v
n
The Justify alignment option adds additional space between words so that both the 
left and right margins are even. Justify is often used when formatting newspaper-style 
columns.
Figure 5.62
Scroll to position the middle of Page 2 on your screen, look at the left and right margins, and notice that the 
text is justified— both the right and left margins of multiple-line paragraphs are aligned evenly at the margins.
On the Home tab, in the Paragraph group, notice that the lustify button L=J is active.
In the paragraph that begins Every spring, students vote, in the first line, look at the space following the word 
Every, and then compare it with the space following the word Trustee in the second line. Notice how some of 
the spaces between words are larger than others.
To achieve a justified right margin, Word adjusts the size of spaces between words in this manner, which can result 
in unattractive spacing in a document that spans the width of a page. Many individuals find such spacing difficult to 
read.
Press (Ctrf) + [AJ to select all of thejext in the document, and then on the Home tab, in the Paragraph group, 
click the Align Text Left button
Press [Ctrl j + (Home). At the top of the document, in the left margin area, point to the left of the first paragraph— 
Associated Students o f Laurel College— until the E l  pointer displays, and then click one time to select the 
paragraph. On the Mini toolbar, change the Font Size to 26.
Point to the left of the first paragraph—Associated Students o f Laurel College— to display the I# l pointer again, 
and then drag down to select the first two paragraphs, which form the title and subtitle of the document.
On the M ini toolbar, click the Center button [»] to center the title and subtitle between the left and right 
margins, and then compare your screen with Figure 5.63.

Activity 5.30 
Changing Line Spacing
Line spacing is the distance between lines of text in a paragraph. Three of the most commonly used line 
spacing options are shown in the table in Figure 5.64.
r 
1
Line Spacing Options
Alignment
Description, Example, and Information
Single spacing
The text in this example uses single spacing. Single spacing was once the most commonly used 
spacing in business documents. Now, because so many documents are read on a computer screen 
rather than on paper, single spacing is becoming less popular.
Multiple 1.15 spacing
The text in this example uses multiple 1.15 spacing. I he default line spacing in Microsoft Word 
2010 is 1.15, which is equivalent to single spacing with an extra 1/6 line added between lines to 
make the text easier to read on a computer screen. Many individuals now prefer this spacing, even 
on paper, because the lines of text appear less crowded.
Double spacing
V ___
The text in this example uses double spacing. College research papers and draft documents that 
need space for notes are commonly double-spaced; there is space for a full line of text between each 
document line.

the Home tab, in the Paragraph group, click the Dialog Box Launcher [j],
2

Objective 17 | Create and Modify Lists
To display a list of information, you can choose a bulleted list, which uses bullets— 
text symbols such as small circles or check marks— to introduce each item in a list. You 
can also choose a numbered list, which uses consecutive numbers or letters to introduce

each item in a list. Use a bulleted list if the items in the list can be introduced in any order; use a numbered list for 
items that have definite steps, a sequence of actions, or are in chronological order.
Activity 5.32

Creating a Bulleted List
In the upper portion of Page l, locate the paragraph that begins Volunteering to help, and then point to this 
paragraph from the left margin area to display theLil pointer. Drag down to select this paragraph and the 
next five paragraphs.
On the Home tab, in the Paragraph group, click the Bullets button 
bulleted list.
to change the selected text to a
The spacing between each of the bulleted points changes to the spacing between lines in a paragraph—in this 
instance, 1.15 line spacing. The spacing after the last item in the list is the same as the spacing after each paragraph- 
in this instance, 6 pt. Each bulleted item is automatically indented.
On the ruler, point to the First Line Indent button [31 and read the Screen l ip, and then point to the Hanging 
Indent button 0 .  Compare your screen with Figure 5.69.
By default, Word formats bulleted items with a first line indent ot 0.250 and adds a Hanging Indent at 0.50. I he 
hanging indent maintains the alignment of text when a bulleted item is more than one line, for example, the last 
bulleted item in this list.

Word uses predictive logic to determine that this paragraph is the first item in a numbered list and formats the new

to a tab, and the AutoCorrect Options button displays to the left of the list item. The tab is indicated by a right arrow 
formatting mark.

Click OK. On the ruler, notice that the left tab marker at 3.5" no longer displays, a right tab marker displays at 
6", and a series of dots— a dot leader—displays between the columns of the list. Notice also that the right edge 
of the column is even. Compare your screen with Figure 5.77.
A leader character creates a solid, dotted, or dashed line that fills the space to the left of a tab character and draws 
the reader's eyes across the page from one item to the next. When the character used for the leader is a dot, it is 
commonly referred to as a dot leader.

line. When you press Enter, the insertion point moves down to a new paragraph in the 
same cell. You can also insert text from another document into a table cell.

borders. A border at the top and bottom of the resume, however, is attractive and adds a professional look to the 
document.

of the upper left corner of the table to display the table move handle 0 .  With the \  pointer, click one time to

Objective 4 | Create a New Document from an 
Existing Document
A template is an existing document that you use as a starting point for a new document.
The template document opens a copy of itself, unnamed, and then you use the structure— 
and possibly some content, such as headings— as the starting point for a new document. All 
documents are based on a template. When you create a new blank document, il is based on 
W ord’s Normal template, which serves as the starting point for all new Word documents.
Activity 6.10 
Creating a Letterhead
A letterhead is the personal or company information that displays at the top of a letter, and commonly 
includes a name, address, and contact information. The term also refers to a piece of paper imprinted with such 
information at the top.
1 
Start Word, and in the new blank document, be sure that formatting marks and rulers display. On the Home 
tab, in the Styles group, click the More button \[\. In the displayed gallery, click the No Spacing button.
Recall that the default spacing for a new Word document is 10 points of blank space following a paragraph and line 
spacing of 1.15. The No Spacing style inserts no extra space following a paragraph and uses single spacing.
Using the No Spacing style allows you to format a letter as outlined in Business Communications texts.
2 Type the following, pressing (Enter) at the end of each item:
Tina Nguyen
1776 Atwood Avenue, Madison, Wl 53704 
(608) 555-0347 tnguyen@alcona.net
3 If the e-mail address changes to blue text, right-click the e-mail address, and then from the shortcut menu, 
click Remove Hyperlink. Compare your screen with Figure 6.15.

Objective 6 | Use the Proofing Options
W ord compares your typing to words in the Office dictionary and compares your 
y jcw t|le vjdco on t|ie
phrases and punctuation to a list of grammar rules. Words that are not in the dictionary 
Companion Web Site
are marked with a wavy red underline. Phrases and punctuation that differ from the 
or in MylTLab

grammar rules are marked with a wavy green underline. W ord also compares commonly misused words with a set 
of word usage rules, and marks misused words with a wavy blue underline; for example, the misuse of their, there, 
and they’re. However, Word will not llag the word sign as misspelled even though you intended to type sing a song 
rather than sign a song, because both are words contained within W ord’s dictionary. Your own proofreading skills 
are still required to edit documents accurately.
Activity 6.17 
Checking Spelling and Grammar Errors
In this activity, you will practice with different methods to correct spelling and grammar errors.
| Spelling and Gram m ar Checking
If you do not see any wavy red, green, or blue lines under words, the automatic spelling and/or grammar checking has been turned off. To ac­
tivate it, display Backstage view, click Options, click Proofing, and then under When correcting spelling in Microsoft Office programs, select the 
first four check boxes. Under When correcting spelling and grammar in Word, select the first four check boxes, and then click the Writing Style 
arrow and click Grammar Only. Under Exceptions for, clear both check boxes. To display the flagged spelling and grammar errors, click the 
Recheck Document button, and then close the dialog box.
1 
Position the body of the letter on your screen, and then examine the text to locate green, red, and blue wavy 
underlines.
A list of grammar rules applied by a computer program like Word can never be exact, and a computer dictionary 
cannot contain all known words and proper names. Thus, you will need to check any words flagged by Word with 
wavy underlines, and you will also need to proofread for content errors.
2 
In the paragraph that begins With a permanent, locate the word temporery with the wavy red underline. Point 
to the word and right-click to display the shortcut menu, and then compare your screen with Figure 6.25.

More Knowledge | Suppressing the Page Number on the First Page
Some style guidelines require that the page number and other header and footer information on the llrst page be hidden from view—suppressed. 
To hide the information contained in the header and footer areas on Page l of a document, double-click in the header or footer area. Then, on 
the Design tab, in the Options group, select the Different First Page check box.
Objective 9 | Insert Footnotes in a Research Paper
Reports and research papers typically include information that you find in other 
sources, and these must be credited. W ithin report text, numbers mark the location of 
notes— information that expands on the topic being discussed but that does not fit well 
in the document text. The numbers refer to footnotes— notes placed at the bottom of 
the page containing the note, or to endnotes— notes placed at the end of a document or 
chapter.
Activity 6.24 
Inserting Footnotes
Footnotes can be added as you type the document or after the document is complete. W ord renumbers the 
footnotes automatically, so footnotes do not need to be entered in order; if one footnote is removed, the remaining 
footnotes renumber automatically.
1 
Scroll to view the top of Page 2. Locate the paragraph that begins Consumers and businesses. In the seventh 
line of text, toward the end of the line, click to position the insertion point to the right of the period after 
followed.
2 
On the References tab, in the Footnotes group, click the Insert Footnote button.
Word creates space for a footnote at the bottom of the page. Footnote I displays in the footnote area, and the 
insertion point moves to the right of the number. A short black line is added just above the footnote area.
3  Type Tennessee, for example, imposes penalties of up to $10,000 for providing false information regarding the 
recycling of hazardous waste.
This is an explanatory footnote; the footnote provides additional information that does not fit in the body of 
the report.
4  
Click the Home tab, and then in the Font group, notice that the font size of the footer is 10 pt. In the Paragraph 
group, click the Line and Paragraph Spacing button, and notice that the line spacing is 1.0— single-spaced— 
even though the font size of the document text is 11 pt and the text is double-spaced, as shown in Figure 6.37.

Activity 6.25 
Modifying a Footnote Style
Microsoft W ord contains built-in paragraph formats called styles— groups of formatting commands, such as 
font, font size, font color, paragraph alignment, and line spacing—which can be applied to a paragraph with one 
command. The default style for footnote text is a single-spaced paragraph that uses a 10-point Calibri font and no 
paragraph indents. M LA  style specifies double-spaced text in all areas of a research paper. According to the M LA  
style, first lines of footnotes must also be indented 0.5 inch and use the same font size as the report text.
1 
Scroll to view the bottom of Page 2. Point anywhere in the footnote text and right-click, and then from the 
shortcut menu, click Style. Compare your screen with Figure 6.38.
The Style dialog box displays, listing the styles currently in use in the document, in addition to some of the word 
processing elements that come with special built-in styles. Because you right-clicked on the footnote text, the 
selected style is the Footnote Text style.

Objective 10 | Create Citations and a Bibliography
in a Research Paper
When you use quotations from or detailed summaries of other people’s work, you 
must specify the source of the information. A citation is a note inserted into the text of 
a report or research paper that refers the reader to a source in the bibliography. Create 
a bibliography at the end of a document to list the sources referred to in the document. 
Such a list is typically titled Works Cited (in M LA  style), Bibliography, Sources, or 
References.
View Ihe video on the 
Companion Web Site 
or in MylTLab
Activity 6.26 
Adding Citations
When writing a research paper, you will likely reference books, articles, and Web sites. Some of your research 
sources may be referenced many times, and others only one time. It is necessary to create each source only one 
time, and it will be available for use throughout the document. Then, at the end of your paper, you will be able to 
generate the list of sources that must be included.
1 
Press (CtrFI + [Home] and then locate the paragraph that begins Making a commitment. In the third line, following 
the word capitalism, click to position the insertion point to the right of the quotation mark.
The citation in the document points to the full source information in the bibliography, which typically includes the 
name of the author, the full title of the work, the year of publication, and other publication information.
2 
On the References tab, in the Citations & Bibliography group, click the Style button arrow, and then click MLA 
Sixth Edition (or the latest edition) to insert a reference using M LA  style.
3 
Click the Insert Citation button, and then click Add New Source. Be sure Book is selected as the Type of Source. 
Add the following information, and then compare your screen with Figure 6.40:
Author:
Hirshberg, Gary
Title:
Stirring it Up: How to Make Money and Save the World
Year:
2008
City:
New York
Publisher:

In the MLA style, citations that refer to items on the Works Cited page are placed in parentheses and are referred 
to as parenthetical references—references that include the last name of the author or authors and the page number 
in the referenced source, which you add to the reference. No year is indicated, and there is no comma between the 
name and the page number.

o f this source. C om pare your screen with Figure 6.41.
7 
Click OK to display the page num ber of the citation. Click outside of the citation box to deselect it. Then type 
a period to the right of the citation, and delete the period to the left of the quotation mark.
In the MLA style, if the reference occurs at the end of a sentence, the parenthetical reference always displays to the 
left of the punctuation mark that ends the sentence.
8 
In the next paragraph, which begins Government contractors, click to position the insertion point at the end 
of the paragraph, but before the period.
9 
In the Citations & Bibliography group, click the Insert Citation button, and then click Add New Source. Click 
the Type of Source arrow, scroll down as necessary, and then click Web site. Add the following inform ation, 
and then Click OK to close the Create Source dialog box and add the citation:

Inserting Page Breaks
In this activity you will insert a m anual page break so that you can begin your bibliography on a new page.
1 
Press [Ctrl) + I End I to move the insertion point to the end of the docum ent. Notice that the insertion point 
displays at the end of the final paragraph, but above the footnote— the footnote is always associated with the 
page that contains the citation. Press (Ctrl) + (Enter) to insert a m anual page break.
A manual page break forces a page to end at the insertion point location, and then places any subsequent text at the 
top of the next page. Recall that the new paragraph retains the formatting of the previous paragraph, so the lirst line 
is indented.
On the ruler, point to the First Line Indent button [2], and then drag the First Line Indent button to the left to
0 inches on the horizontal ruler.
Scroll as necessary to position the bottom  ot Page 2 and the top of Page 3 on your screen. C om pare your 
screen with Figure 6.42, and then Save jfl] your docum ent.
A page break indicator, which shows where a manual page break was inserted, displays at the bottom of the Page 2, and 
the footnote remains on the page that contains the citation, even though il displays below the page break indicator.

Summary
In this chapter, you created a table, and then used the table to create a resume. You created a 
letterhead template, and then created a document using a copy of the letterhead template. You 
created a cover letter for the resume, moved text, corrected spelling and grammar, and used the 
built-in thesaurus. You also created a short resume using a template, and saved the resume as 
a Web page. You created a research paper using the MLA style, including a header, footnotes, 
citations, and a bibliography, and changed the footnote style. You created a newsletter that used 
multiple columns. You added a column break, a page break, and a manual line break. You added 
special font effects, and added a border and shading to a paragraph. Finally, you used the Mail 
Merge Wizard to create a set of mailing labels for the newsletter.

Objective 1 | 
Recognize the 
Difference Between 
Human and Computer 
Representation of 
Input
In your job as a M arketing A ssistant for 
an entertainm en t company, the M arketing 
Director has e-mailed you some questions 
about the compat ibility of your notebook 
com puter system  with the newly purchased 
software th a t tracks projects. You wore 
a little uncertain on the term s bit, byte, 
megahertz, gigahertz, RAM , and cache. Af­
ter reading the e-mail, you decide to inves­
tigate the relation of these term s to your 
system ’s components. Where do you start?
C om puters need data to work w ith, 
and th a t data m ust be represented in a 
specific way for the com puters hardw are 
to accept and use it. The norm al char­
acters or sentences you input are not 
actually w hat the com puter reads. For 
example, when you press a key on your 
keyboard and the letter Z displays on your 
monitor, the information does not actually 
move through your com puter as the letter 
Z. Instead, the letter Z is passed through 
your system  as a unit of inform ation called 
a bit, which is a contraction of the term  
binary d ig it. A bit is a single circuit, or 
path, th a t either contains a current or 
does not. To visualize a bit, the binary dig­
its of 0 and 1 are used. The O ff state, the 
mode when current is not flowing through 
the circuit, is represented bv the digit 0. 
The On state, the mode when current is 
flowing through the circuit, is represented 
by the digit 1. A bit is the sm allest piece 
of data a com puter can process. The use 
of 0 and 1 help you visualize the on and 
off state. For the computer, however, it is 
the presence or absence of current flowing 
through the circuitry th a t the com puter 
system  detects (Figure 7.1).
Concept 7.01 
Representing 
Data as Bits and Bytes
Com puters represent num bers and char­
acters by sensing the current as it moves 
through a group of bits. W hen you press 
a key on your keyboard, an off/on p at­
tern  of curren t, unique to th a t character, 
passes through this bit group. The rep re­
sentation of th is pattern, a strin g  of

Think of a bit as a light switch. Both 
a light switch and a bit have the same two 
states, off and on. If a com puter system 
used one bit—one sw itch—to transfer 
data, your keyboard would be limited to 
two keys—one key whose value would be 
represented by the num ber 0 and no cur­
rent in the circuit (off) and another key 
represented by the num ber 1 and current 
passing through the circuit (on). If your 
system  had two switches, your keyboard 
would be lim ited to four keys represent­
ing the four possible states of current in 
the two circuits—both switches on, both 
switches off, the first switch on and the 
second switch off, or the first switch off 
and the second switch on. How do you 
determ ine the num ber of possible com­
binations of on/off patterns? The result 
of the form ula 2", where n is the num ber 
of switches, will provide you w ith the 
num ber of possible com binations of cir­
cuit states for n switches. Consider th at 
your keyboard can contain from 128 to 
256 different characters, including all the 
letters of the alphabet in both uppercase

and lowercase, the num bers 0 through 9, 
and punctuation m arks. So how many 
sw itches, or bits, are needed to represent 
your entire keyboard? The answ er is 8 
because 28 = 256.
A byte, a group of eight bits, is used 
to rep resen t one ch aracter of data, such 
as the letters of the alphabet (like the 
ch aracter Z uppercase and lowercase), 
the num bers 0 -  9, and the m ost com­
mon punctu atio n  sym bols. Because one 
byte rep resen ts one ch aracter on your 
keyboard, the byte is used as the unit to 
express the am ount of inform ation your 
com puter’s storage device can hold. For 
exam ple, one of your typical college es­
says contains 250 words per page, and 
each word contains, on average, 5.5 
ch aracters. Therefore, one page contains 
approxim ately 1,375 characters. In other 
w ords, you will need about 1,375 bytes of 
storage to save one page of your essay.
Because a bit is one component of a 
byte, you m ight ask if the term s are in ter­
changeable. The term s are used to pres­
ent different types of inform ation. Bytes 
express storage capacity, and bits— Is and 
Os—are commonly used for m easuring 
the d ata tran sfer rate of com puter com­

m easurem ent units, th a t describe rapid 
data tran sfer rates. These units corre­
spond roughly to 1 thousand, 1 million, 
and 1 billion bits per second. These term s 
refer to bits per second, not bytes per sec­
ond (Figure 7.3).
Bytes commonly m easure data stor­
age. The m easurem ents—kilobyte (KB) 
for one thousand bytes, m egabyte (MB) 
for one million bytes, gigabyte (GB) for 
one billion bytes, and terabyte (TB) for 
one trillion bytes—describe the am ount 
of data a com puter is m anaging either in 
RAM memory or in longer-term  storage 
such as a hard disk, CD, DVD, or USB 
drive. Figure 7.4 displays these units 
and the approxim ate value of text data 
for each. For these units, the equivalents 
of a thousand, a million, and so on, are 
not exact; rounding num bers has become 
acceptable. For exam ple, a kilobyte is 
actually 1,024 bytes.
This inform ation is useful when you 
buy a new com puter and you need to de­
term ine the size of the storage devices 
you need. Most hard drives on computers 
available for sale hold gigabytes and tera­
bytes of data. In anticipation of continued 
data use and storage needs, term s already 
exist for representing even larger units. A 
petabyte is 1 quadrillion bytes, an exa­
byte is 1 quintillion bytes, a zettabyte 
is 1 sextillion bytes, and a yottabyte is
1 septillion bytes (Figure 7.5).

Concept 7.02 Processing Very 
Large and Very Small Numbers
W hen you need to represent and process 
num bers w ith fractional parts such as 
1.25 or num bers th a t are extrem ely large 
such as in the billions and trillions, com­
puters use flo a tin g  p o in t sta n d a rd .
The term  floating point suggests how 
this notation system  works: There is no 
fixed num ber of digits before or after the 
decimal point—thus the word float, so 
the com puter can work with very large 
and very sm all num bers by shifting the 
decimal point. Floating point standard 
requires special processing circuitry em ­
bedded w ithin the CPU—the processor or 
microprocessor.
Concept 7.03 Converting 
Characters
Most of your daily com munication uses 
w ritten text not num bers. So how are 
characters converted into bytes?
C haracter code is an established pro­
cedure used to create bit patterns for the 
letters, numbers, and symbols on your key­
board called characters. Depending on your 
system, the conversion from your visible key­
board character to the internal bit pattern 
used by the computer for that character is 
done by one of three different character cod­
ing formats: ASC II, EBCDIC, or Unicode.
The most widely used character code is 
ASCII (pronounced ASK-ee)—the American 
Sta n d a rd  Code for Inform ation Inter­
change. The ASCII character code is used in 
computers that make information available 
over the Internet. ASCII uses seven bits and 
can thus represent 128 (27 = 128) different 
characters. A variation of ASCII code, called 
Extended ASC II (see Figure 7.6), uses eight 
bits and allows 128 additional characters— 
logical symbols such as >= and the fractions 
1/2 and 1/4— for a total o f256 (2s = 256). In 
both systems, the first 128 codes represent 
the same characters. Go to w w w .asciitable. 
com  to view the complete ASCII and Ex­
tended ASCII listings. EBCDIC (pronounced 
EBB-see-dic)—Extended Binary Coded 
Decim al Interchange Code—is another 
eight-bit character code format used in IBM 
mainframe computers and some midrange 
systems.
Although ASCII and EBCDIC provide 
enough bits to represent all characters 
in the English language and some for­
eign language symbols, neither one has 
enough binary com binations for some 
E astern languages and historic symbols 
th a t exceed 256 characters. A new coding 
system —Unicode—is becoming popular. 
Unicode uses 16 bits, can represent over 
65,000 characters, and can symbolize the 
entire world’s w ritten languages. The first 
128 codes in the Unicode system  represent

How is non-character input like im­
ages or biom etric data like a fingerprint

are usually used to convert and interpret

the Elements of the 
System Unit
In your position of M arketing A ssistant in 
an entertainm ent company, 
you m ake use of both a desk­
top unit at your office and a 
laptop com puter when you are j 
on site at a client’s office or 
trade show. The media pack-

-  
sented on your older desktop 
system. When you called the 
IT departm ent for help with 
this issue, they w anted to 
know how many available expansion 
slots your desktop system unit has.
They say th at adding a sound board 
and subwoofer to your desktop unit will 
improve the sound. You are a little unsure 
about how to respond to their question. 
W here do you start?

The system  u n it is the boxlike metal 
or plastic case th at provides a clean and 
cool environm ent for your com puter’s main 
hardw are elem ents and a sturdy frame for 
m ounting internal components (Figure 7.8).
The system un it case was originally a 
horizontal design created to lie on top of 
your desk. Today, non-mobile system units 
are housed in a tow er case, which has 
a vertical design enabling it to sit on the 
floor next to or under your desk. A sm aller 
version of the tow er th a t has less internal 
space for components is called a m in i­
tow er case.
In a laptop com puter or a personal 
digital assistant (PDA), the system unit 
contains all the com puter’s components, 
including input compo­
nents such as a keyboard 
and output components 
such as the display. If 
you need to ensure ac­
cess, identification, and 
security, biom etric authen­
tication devices such as 
fingerprint readers, retina 
scanners, and face recogni­
tion system s can be embed­
ded into your system unit 
(Figure 7.9).
System units also vary in their form  
fa cto r—a specification for how internal 
components such as the m otherboard are 
mounted inside the system  unit.
Concept 7.04 Looking Inside 
the System Unit
Ifyou open your system  unit, regardless of 
the m anufacturer or type of computer you 
own, you will see the m otherboard, power 
supply, cooling fan, internal speakers, in­
ternal drive bays, external drive bays, and 
various expansion cards (see Figures 7.10 
and 7.11).
The following overview of these basic 
components will help you identify and 
clarify the purpose of each:
• M otherboard: This is the large cir­
cuit board located w ithin your system 
unit to which all other com ponents are 
connected. It contains a chip referred 
to as the com puter’s cen tra l process­
ing u n it (CPU)—the brain of the 
computer. All other components, such 
as disk drives, m onitors, and printers, 
exist only to bridge the gap between 
you and the CPU.
• Power supply: This transform s the 
alternating current (AC) from standard

needed for the com puter’s operation. It 
also steps the voltage down to the low 
level required by the motherboard.

for the beeps you bear when the com­
puter stalls up or encounters an error. 
For other sound, such as playing music 
or watching YouTube, your computer in­
cludes a sound card and external speak­
ers for better quality sound.
D rive bays: These are the slots th a t 
accomm odate your com puter’s 
storage devices such as the hard disk 
drive, CD drive, or DVD drive.
Internal drive bays accommodate

m odate drives th a t are accessible from 
the outside— a necessity ifyou need 
to insert and remove a DVD from 
the drive.
E xpansion slots: These are recep­
tacles th a t accept additional circuit 
boards or expansion cards. E xpan­

Objective 3 | Identify 
Components of the 
Motherboard
In your job as a M arketing A ssistant with 
an en tertainm ent company, you have 
received an e-mail from the M arketing Di­
rector listing new software specifications 
for system s in the M arketing Division. You 
know th a t the components of your portable 
system  need to m eet or exceed the soft­
w are specifications. W here do you start?
The motherboard within your system 
unit is a circuit board—a large flat piece of 
plastic or fiberglass that contains thousands 
of electrical circuits etched onto its surface. 
The circuits connect numerous plug-in re­
ceptacles th at accommodate your computer’s 
most important components, such as the 
CPU and RAM, which communicate through 
the centralized circuitry em lidded within 
the motherboard. Most of the components on 
your motherboard are an integrated circuit 
(IC), also called a chip. They carry an electri­
cal current and contain millions oi transis­
tors. A transistor is an electronic switch, 
like the light switch discussed earlier in this 
chapter, which controls the flow of electri­
cal signals through a circuit. Transistors are 
made out of layers of 
special material, called a 
sem iconductor, that 
either conducts electrical 
current or blocks its 
passage through the 
circuit. Semiconductor 
material, like silicone, 
produces the off and on 
impulses that represent 
your keyboard charac­
ters within your system.

processor—th a t is an incredibly complex

integrated circuit chip th a t performs many 
different functions depending on the in­
structions sent to it by the program you 
are running. The CPU is the most impor­
tan t elem ent of a com puter in term s of its 
overall performance. M any electronic and 
mechanical devices you use daily, such 
as sm artphones, calculators, automobile 
engines, and industrial and medical equip­
m ent, contain em bedded processors. 
These processors are program med to per­
form only the tasks intended to be done by 
th at specific device.
Concept 7.06 Checking 
Processor Slots and Sockets
The CPU is an integrated circuit of in­
credible complexity th a t plugs into a 
m otherboard in m uch the sam e way th at 
other integrated circuits do—through a 
series of pins th a t extend out from the 
bottom of the chip. However, only special 
slots and sockets can accommodate CPUs, 
because CPUs are larger and have more 
pins than m ost other chips. Additionally, 
CPUs generate so much heat th a t they 
could destroy them selves or other system 
components. The CPU is generally cov­
ered by a h ea t sin k , a heat-dissipating 
com ponent th a t drains h eat from the chip 
through a sm all auxiliary cooling fan.
The latest high-end CPU s include their 
own built-in refrigeration system s to keep 
these speedy processors cool.
Concept 7.07 Understanding 
the Instruction Set
Every processor perform s a fixed set of op­
erations, called instructions. One instruc­
tion might be to retrieve a character from 
the com puter’s memory and another might 
be to compare two num bers to see which is 
larger. A processor’s list of instructions is 
called its in stru ctio n  se t, and is unique 
for th at processor. This is why a program 
th at runs on a W indows-based PC may not 
run on an Apple Mac—the two computers 
have a different type of processor.
Concept 7.08 Moving Through 
the Machine Cycle
Every CPU contains two subcom ponents— 
the control unit and the arithm etic logic 
unit. Both components play a p art in the 
four-step process called the processing 
cycle or m achine cycle. The control 
u n it, under the direction of an embedded 
program, switches from one stage to the
308 
GO! All In One | Chapter 7: System Components, Input / Output Devices, and Storage Devices

next and performs the action of th at 
stage. The four steps of the m achine 
cycle are:
• F etch  retrieves the next instruc­
tion from the program stored in 
the com puter’s RAM memory lo­
cated on the m otherboard.
• D ecode takes the fetched instruc­
tion and tran slates it into a form 
th a t the control unit understands.
• E xe cu te perform s th e requested 
in stru ctio n  using the a r ith m e ­
tic logic u n it (ALU) to perform  
a rith m e tic  operations, which

m ultiplication, and division, and

• Store holds the results in an internal 
register—a location on the CPU—for 
further use by the CPU or a location 
in RAM.
R egisters are tem porary storage areas 
located w ithin a microprocessor. Even 
though the word store is used when de­
scribing th eir function, they are not con­
sidered as p art of memory and act more 
like a digital scratch pad. Some registers 
accept, hold, and transfer instructions or 
data, and others perform arithm etic or 
logical com parisons at high speed. Reg­
isters work extrem ely fast, in fact at the 
sam e speed as the CPU into which they 
are embedded.
These four steps of the machine cycle, 
or processing cycle, can be grouped into two 
phases: the instruction cycle (fetch and 
decode) and the execution cycle (execute 
and store). Today’s microprocessors work 
so fast th a t they can go through this entire 
four-step process billions of times per second 
(Figure 7.14).
Concept 7.09 Enhancing the 
Microprocessor's Performance
The num ber of transistors and the closer 
they are in proximity to each other w ithin 
a processor have a large effect on the per­
formance speed of th a t processor. Some 
additional features that affect the proces­
sor’s perform ance include:
• P ipelining: A technique th a t feeds a 
new instruction into the CPU at every

instruction from memory

into a form the CPU understands

from personal computers to mainframes. What differs is the speed at which the 
cycle is performed.
step of the processing cycle so th at 
four or more instructions are worked 
on sim ultaneously. Pipelining can be 
compared to an auto assem bly line 
in which more than one car is being 
worked on at once. Before the first 
instruction is finished, the next one 
is started. Figure 7.15 visually

differentiates between a processing 
cycle without pipelining and with 
pipelining.
• P a ra llel processing: A technique 
in which more than one processor 
executes two or more portions of a 
program  at the sam e time. You will 
find parallel processing on system s 
th a t run program s th at perform many 
com putations, such as sim ulations or 
graphic processing software. These 
processors m ight be w ithin one sys­
tem , on the sam e m otherboard, or on 
independent system s networked with 
sophisticated distributed processing 
softw are (Figure 7.16). The idea is to 
speed up the execution of a program  
by dividing the program into m ultiple 
fragm ents th at can execute sim ulta­
neously, each on its own processor. 
Parallel processing should not be con­
fused with m u ltita sk in g , a process by 
which the CPU gives you the illusion
of perform ing instructions from mul­
tiple program s at once when in reality, 
the CPU is rapidly sw itching between 
the program s and instructions. Most 
com puters th at you use at home and 
at work have one CPU.
• M ulti-core processors: These sys­
tem s attem pt to correct the slowdown 
th a t occurs in the processing cycle 
when the CPU is held up by waiting 
for instructions and data from slower- 
running RAM or a hard disk. In dual­
core and quad-core processors, access 
tim e is reduced and overall process­
ing tim e improved because while one 
core is busy executing an instruction, 
another can handle incoming stream s 
of data or instructions. The idea is 
th a t “two hands are better than one.” 
AMD and Intel offer multi-core 64-bit 
processors. To use a dual-core or quad- 
core processor to full capacity, your 
system  m ust use a compatible operat­
ing system and application software. 
Otherw ise only one core will be rec­
ognized, and the processor will never 
work to its full potential.
Concept 7.10 Reviewing 
Popular Microprocessors
The most commonly used microprocessors 
are those in IBM-compatible computers, also 
called PCs, and Macs. Most PCs are powered 
by chips produced by Intel and AMD. Figure 
7.17 shows how popular microprocessors for 
PCs have improved over time.
In 2010, Intel released the Core i7 Ex­
trem e Edition microprocessor with a clock 
speed of 3.3GHz. Since 2003, Intel has 
been concentrating on producing proces­
sors th a t are suited for specific computing

Deciphering 
the Chipset and the Input/

A nother key m otherboard component is 
the c h ip se t, which is a collection of chips 
th a t work together to provide the sw itch­
ing circuitry needed by the microprocessor 
to move data throughout the com puter. 
One of the jobs handled by the chipset is 
linking the microprocessor’s system  bus 
w ith the com puter’s in p u t/o u tp u t (I/O) 
b u s, which refers specifically to the 
electrical pathw ay th at extends beyond 
your m icroprocessor to com m unicate with 
your input and output devices. Typically, 
the I/O bus contains expansion slots to ac­
commodate plug-in expansion cards.

bus th a t connects devices like hard drives 
and sound cards to the faster m icroproces­
sor system  bus. M any m otherboards still 
contain an Industry Standard A rchitecture 
(ISA) bus and have one or two ISA slots 
available. Most include an accelerated 
graphics port (AGP) designed for video 
and graphics display. The microprocessor 
is ju st one of several chips on your com­
puter's m otherboard. Among the others 
are those th a t provide the com puter with 
various types of memory.
Concept 7.12 Understanding 
Memory
M emory refers to the chips, located on 
your motherboard or w ithin your CPU, 
th at retain instructions and data to be ac­
cessed by the CPU. As you run a program, 
the instructions and data are loaded from 
a perm anent storage device, such as your 
hard drive, into memory chips on your 
m otherboard. From here, other components 
of your system access this information via 
the data bus. So you might ask, is informa­
tion actually in a system in two places at 
the same time? Yes, the main reason for 
w hat appears as a double set of informa­
tion is th at the access time from memory on 
your m otherboard is significantly less than 
the access tim e from your storage device, 
like a hard drive, and decreased access tim e 
improves overall system performance.
Concept 7.13 Recognizing the 
Importance of RAM
The large, rectangular memory modules 
housed on your com puter’s motherboard 
contain random  access m em ory (RAM). 
RAM is nonperm anent memory; its con­
tents are erased when the com puter’s 
power is switched off either on purpose or 
accidentally. RAM is used to:
• Receive and hold the program instruc­
tions and data you are currently using
• Provide those instructions and data to 
the CPU when needed
• Hold the results of the CPU’s process­
ing until an instruction is received to 
transfer it to a printer or perm anent 
storage device
RAM is referred to as random access 
because any storage location can be ac­
cessed directly w ithout having to go from 
the first location to the last in sequential 
order. RAM organization is often compared

Memory addresses

to post office boxes (Figure 
7.18). Each location has a 
memory address th a t en­
ables the location to be found 
and the content w ithin to 
be accessed directly. O ther 
forms of storage, such as 
the hard disk and CD-ROM, 
are also accessed directly or 
randomly—out of sequential 
order—but the term  random 
access is never applied to 
these forms of storage.
O f the different types 
of RAM available, the new est and fastest 
PCs contain eith er DDR2-SDRAM (dou- 
ble-d ata-rate two synchronous dynam ic 
RAM) or DDR3-SDRAM. RAM appears in 
the form oi m em ory m odules or m em ­
ory c a rd s , which are sm all circuit boards 
th a t hold several RAM chips and lock 
into special slots on the m otherboard. 
RAM m odules are usually d u a l in lin e 
m em ory m odules (DIMM) th a t have 
a 168-pin connector and a 64-bit data 
tran sfer rate. T heir predecessor, single 
in lin e  m em ory m odules (SIMM), 
used a 7‘2-pin connector and a 32-bit 
d ata tra n sfe r rate.
How m uch RAM does a com puter 
need? In general, the more RAM the bet­
ter. C u rren t operating system s require 
a m inim um  of approxim ately 600 MB of 
RAM but m ost system s come w ith 2 GB 
and an option to have more installed.
If your RAM fills up, what happens? 
Your operating system will make use of 
v irtu a l m em ory, whereby the operat­
ing system  looks at the contents of RAM 
to identify data that has not been used 
recently and copies this data onto a sec­
tion of the hard disk th at the operating 
system  delegates for this purpose. This 
action frees up space in RAM so you can 
load a new application or add more data to 
a program  currently in use. However, ac­
cessing data on a disk drive is much slower 
than using RAM, so when virtual memory 
kicks in, your com puter may seem to slow 
to a crawl. To avoid using virtual memory, 
choose a system w ith at least 2 GB of RAM.
Concept 7.14 Understanding 
Cache Memory
RAM is not fast enough to support the 
processing speeds of newer superfast 
microprocessors such as the Intel Core
i7 Extrem e Edition or the AMD Phenorn
X4. These microprocessors use cache 
m em ory to function at m axim um  speed. 
Cache memory is a sm all unit of ultrafast 
memory built into or near the processor 
th a t stores frequently or recently accessed 
program instructions and data. Cache— 
pronounced CASH—memory is faster than 
RAM, but it is also more expensive. Al­
though the am ount of cache th a t comes on 
a system  is relatively sm all compared with 
RAM, cache memory greatly improves the 
com puter system ’s overall performance be­
cause the CPU retrieves d ata more quickly 
from cache than from RAM.
Cache is identified by its location rela­
tive to the CPU. There can be three levels 
of cache in a system:
• Level I (LI) cache. Also called p ri­
m ary cache, this is a unit of 4 KB to
16 KB of u ltrafast memory included 
in the microprocessor chip th at runs 
at approxim ately 10 nanoseconds. A 
nanosecond is one-billionth of a second. 
Prim ary cache is the fastest memory.
• Level 2 (L2) ca ch e: Also called sec­
ondary ca ch e, this is a unit of up to 
512 KB of u ltrafast memory that can 
be located w ithin the microprocessor 
but further from the registers than 
Level 1 cache, or on a separate cache 
chip located on the m otherboard very 
close to the microprocessor. It runs at
20 to 30 nanoseconds.
• Level 3 (L3) cache: This cache is found 
on some systems with newer micropro­
cessors like Intel’s Xeon processor that 
are in some servers and workstations.
It is located outside of the processor on 
a separate cache chip on the mother­
board very close to the microprocessor.
Keeping the Level 2 and Level 3 cache 
as close as possible to the microprocessor 
improves overall system  performance 
(Figure 7.19).
Now th at you know the different levels 
of cache th at can be em bedded within your 
system  and w here they can be located, how 
does your com puter access the information 
in cache? There is a sequence th at 
the CPU (microprocessor) follows when 
looking for an instruction or data. If the 
next instruction or data to be fetched is 
not already in a register, the CPU—the 
microprocessor—attem pts to locate th at in­
struction in Level 1 cache. If it is not located 
in Level 1 cache, the CPU checks Level 2 
cache. If the instruction is not in Level 2 
cache, then it checks Level 3 cache if any

FIG U RE 7.19 
The close 
proximity of cache to the 
CPU is one reason why 
accessing information 
from cache is quicker 
than from RAM.
Level 3 cache exists on the system. If the 
command is not already loaded into one of 
the cache chips, then the CPU m ust make 
the longer and slower trip and check RAM.
Because cache is part of the micropro­
cessor or the m otherboard, it cannot be 
upgraded. For this reason, it is im portant 
to check the am ount of the various lev­
els of cache on a system  when you buy a 
com puter.
Concept 7.15 Examining ROM 
and Other Types of Memory on 
the Motherboard
If everything in your RAM chips is erased 
when the power is turned off, how does the 
com puter sta rt up again? The answ er is 
read-only m em ory (ROM), a type of non­
volatile memory in which essential startu p  
instructions are prerecorded by the m anu­
facturer of your system and not erased 
when the system  is shut down. Here are 
some of the more recognized program s 
stored in ROM:
• BIO S. The basic in p u t/o u tp u t sys­
tem —the first code to run when your 
system  is powered on. BIOS checks 
and initializes devices such as your 
keyboard, display screen, and disk 
drives.
• B ootstrap Loader. A program  th a t 
locates the operating system on your 
hard drive and loads it into RAM.
• CMOS or com plem entary m etal- 
oxide sem iconductor: Controls a va­
riety of actions including starting the 
power-on self-test and verifying th a t 
other components of the system  are 
functioning correctly.
• P O ST , also called the power-on self­
test: A program , activated by CMOS, 
th a t checks the circuitry and RAM, 
m arking any locations th at are defec­
tive so th a t they are not used.

In your job as a M arketing A ssistant for 
an entertainm ent company, you observed 
at a recent convention th a t many atten d ­
ees were using sm artphones, notebooks, 
and netbooks to take notes and record

W here do you start?
On the outside of a typical tower com­
puter system unit, you most likely will find:
• The front panel w ith some buttons and 
some lights
• The power switch
• Connectors and ports for plugging 
in keyboards, mice, m onitors, and 
speakers
Your front panel may have a drive 
a ctivity light, which lights up when your

Concept 7.16 Distinguishing 
Between Connectors 
and Ports
A connector is a physical receptacle ei­
th er on the system  unit or extending from 
an expansion card. Plugs for different de­
vices are inserted into the connectors and 
are som etim es secured to the connector 
by th u m b screw s—sm all screws th a t are 
usually attached to the plug and secure 
the plug to the system  unit or expansion 
card. Figure 7.20 sum m arizes the connec­
tors you m ay find on your com puter’s case. 
Most of these connectors are on the back 
of the case, but on laptop and notebook 
com puters (Figure 7.21), it is common Lo 
find connectors on the front or side to pro­
vide easier access.
The word connector and port are often 
confused. A p o rt is the electronic pathway 
or interface for getting information into 
and out of the computer. A port alm ost 
alw ays uses a connector, but a connec­
tor may not be a port. For example, a 
telephone jack is ju st a connector—not 
a port. The two words are often used 
interchangeably.
Concept 7.17 Recognizing the 
Versatility of USB Ports
You can connect a variety of devices with 
USB (universal serial bus) p orts, in­
cluding keyboards, mice, printers, and 
digital cam eras. A single USB port can con­
nect up to 127 different peripheral devices, 
elim inating the need for ports th at work 
only with specific devices (Figure 7.22).
USB 2.0 ports, the current standard, 
use an external bus specification that sup­
ports data transfer rates of 480 Mbps—480 
million bits per second—between the com­
puter and its peripheral devices. A USB 
port does not transfer data between devices 
within the system. Some advantages of 
USB ports include hot sw apping  and 
support (or Plug-and-P lay (PnP). Hot 
swapping is the ability to connect and dis­
connect devices w ithout shutting down your 
computer. This is convenient when you are 
using portable devices th at you want to 
disconnect often, such as a digital camera. 
Plug-and-Play refers to a set of standards, 
jointly developed by Intel Corporation and 
Microsoft, which enable a computer to au­
tomatically detect the brand, model, and 
characteristics of a device when you plug it 
in and configure the system  accordingly.
If your com puter does not have enough 
USB ports for your devices, you can

W hat is next in 
j;,
USB development? Look 2 
for USB 3.0 standard in ~ 
the near future. Known 
as Super Speed USB,
USB 3.0 is expected to 
use a fiber optic link to 
attain a data transfer
rate of 4.8 Gbps—up to 10 times faster than 
USB 2.0, be compatible with older versions, 
and continue to provide the same benefits 
while consuming less power.
Concept 7.18 Using FireWire 
(1394 Port)
In 1995 Apple introduced FireWire, an in­
terface Apple created and standardized as 
the IEEE 1394 High Performance Serial Bus 
specification. A FireWire connector, similar to 
a USB connector, offers a high-speed connec­
tion for dozens of different peripheral devices 
(up to 63 of them) and enables hot swapping 
and PnP. However, it is more expensive than 
USB and is used only for certain high-speed 
peripherals such as digital video cameras 
and audio data that need greater throughput 
(data transfer capacity) than USB provides 
(Figure 7.24).
FireW ire 400 has a 
data transfer rate of 400 
J  
Mbps; FireW ire 800 of­
fers 800 Mbps. The next 
generation, FireW ire 
S3200, is expected to 
tran sfer data at 3.2 Gbps.
Although some experts 
consider FireW ire tech­
nologically superior to 
USB, the popularity and 
affordability of USB 2.0, 
coupled with the prom ­
ise of the faster USB 3.0 
interface in the near future, lead most to 
believe th a t the 1394 FireW ire standard 
may fade away.
Concept 7.19 Understanding 
Video Connectors
Most com puters use a video adapter— 
also referred to as a video card—to gener­
ate the output th at is displayed on the 
com puter’s screen or monitor. On the back

of the adapter, you 
will find a standard 
VGA (video graphics 
array) connector, a
15-pin connector th at 
works with standard 
cathode ray tube (CRT) 
m onitors. With LCD 
monitors, a D Vl (dig­
ita l visual interface) 
port is used. On some 
com puters this video 
circuitry is built into 
the m otherboard and 
is called onboard video with a connector 
th at extends from the back of the system 
unit case.
Concept 7.20 Managing 
Additional Ports and 
Connectors
You may find additional ports and connec­
tors on the exterior of a computer’s case or on 
one of the computer’s expansion cards:
• Telephone connector The typical modem 
interface, a telephone connector—called 
R J-11—is a standard modular telephone 
jack that will work with an ordinary 
telephone cord.
• Network connector: Provided with net­
working adapters, the network con­
nector—called an R J-45 or Ethernet
port—looks like a standard 
telephone jack but is bigger 
and capable of much faster 
data transfer.
• PC card / Express Card 
slots: Normally found on 
laptop computers, PC 
Cards originally known 
as the PCMCIA card 
(short for Personal Com­
puter Memory Card In­
ternational Association) 
or its successor the
ExpressCard, are 
credit card-sized devices that fit into 
a designated slot to provide expanded 
capabilities such as wireless communica­
tion, additional memory, multimedia, or 
security features.

with sound cards—adapters th a t 
provide stereo sound and sound syn­
thesis—as well as Macs with built-in 
sound, offer two or more sound

Legacy technology refers to technology, 
devices, or applications th at are being 
phased out in favor of more suitable re­
placem ents like USB and FireW ire ports 
th a t provide greater flexibility and faster 
d ata tran sfer rates. Although legacy tech­
nology may still work on older system s, it 
may not work on newer ones. Figure 7.25

Input Devices
In your job as a M arketing A ssistant for 
an entertainm ent company, at a recent 
m anagem ent m eeting you noticed th at 
a colleague was m aking use of several
input devices on her laptop computer.
You noticed she was using a wireless opti­
cal mouse and a virtual laser keyboard. 
Because the portability of both would 
enhance your presentation to clients, you 
w ant to find out more about these devices. 
W here do you start?
In p u t refers to entering data and in­
structions into your computer for process­
ing. You can do this through several input 
devices, hardw are components that make it 
possible for you to get data and instructions 
into RAM, or tem porary memory, where it is 
held while you work with it (Figure 7.26).
Concept 7.22 Examining 
Keyboards
A keyboard is an input device th at uses 
switches and circuits to tran slate key­
strokes into a signal a com puter under­
stands. Most keyboards have the same 80 
keys—the letters of the alphabet, num ­
bers. punctuation m arks, control keys, 
and function keys. The purpose of func­
tion keys change with the program  in use. 
E nhanced keyboards contain additional 
keys, such as media control buttons th at 
adjust speaker volume and access the opti­
cal disc drive, and Internet controls that 
open e-mail, a browser, or a search window 
with a single keystroke (Figure 7.27).
How is a keyboard connected to your 
com puter system? Keyboards are usually 
connected to the com puter through a cable 
with a connector. Laptop and notebook 
computers, in which the keyboard is part of 
the system unit, use internal connectors.
W ireless keyboards are increasingly 
popular; they connect to your computer 
through infrared (IR), radio frequency 
(RF), or Bluetooth connections instead of 
physical cables. IR and RF connections 
are sim ilar to w hat you would find in 
your television rem ote control. W ireless 
keyboards are battery powered and the 
signals they em it are detected by either 
a built-in receiver or a receiver th at is 
plugged into a USB port.
Applications can m ake use of special 
keys on your keyboard to facilitate scroll­
ing, cursor movement, and increase your 
productivity. Figure 7.28 displays a list of 
these keys and their associated function.
Additional keys you m ight be fam iliar 
with and use on a regular basis include:
• Cursor-movement keys. also called ar- 
row keys: A set of four keys located to 
the left of the num ber pad th at move the 
insertion point up, down, left, or right.

unless you hold them  down and press 
another key. By keeping a modifier 
key pressed down and hitting another

Microsoft Office application, press­
ing C trl + S (the + notation 
m eans to hold down the Ctrl 
key w hile pressing the S key) 
saves an active document, and 
W indows + L locks the screen 
quickly.
Because of their sm aller size, 
some laptops and netbooks 
have more compact keyboards.
All of the sam e functionality 
is provided through the use 
of an additional Function key 
labeled as Fn in combination 
with other keys. One notice­
ably m issing elem ent of these 
keyboards is a num eric key­
pad. Instead, the keys labeled
7, 8, 9, U, I, O, J, K, L, and M
typically act as a num ber pad when 
they are struck while the Fn function 
key is held down (Figure 7.29).
A keyboard th a t displays on a 
touch-sensitive screen is referred to as a 
soft keyboard or on-screen keyboard. 
W ith such keyboards, a full set of keys

iting features such as cut, copy, and paste 
w ith a sim ple touch on the screen. These 
features m ake texting and using your 
sm artphone an easier and more intuitive 
experience.
A m ini-keyboard  is an option avail­
able on m any sm artphones and portable 
devices. This is a keyboard th a t has a key 
for each letter of the alphabet. It is usually 
hidden when the phone is held in a verti­
cal position, but slides out when you repo­
sition the phone horizontally.
A keyp a d  is a sm aller and more com­
pact keyboard found on sm artphones. On 
this device, each key represents m ultiple 
letters. You need to strike a key one to 
four tim es to get the desired character en­
tered as input. Figure 7.30 illustrates the 
keyboard options on sm artphones. With 
a 107 percent increase in text m essaging 
from 2008 to 2009. and 2.5 billion text 
m essages being sent daily in the United 
States alone, it is no surprise th a t when 
you choose a sm artphone, the type of key­
board m ight be an im portant factor.
A virtu a l laser keyboard is a full- 
size keyboard projected on alm ost any su r­
face by a device about the size of a small 
cellular phone and works 
w ith portable devices like 
PDAs and sm artphones. It 
works by monitoring the 
motion of your finger 
m ovements to determ ine 
the key th at you struck.
You can set it to generate 
the clicking sound produced 
on a regular keyboard. Vir­
tual laser keyboards are 
currently not very common; 
however, they are another
alternative to enhance productivity when 
using a portable device (Figure 7.31).
There are substitutes available if a 
conventional keyboard does not work for 
you; for example:
• A flexible keyboard has the size
and layout of a standard PC keyboard 
but weighs only 250 gram s, is 
foldable, and completely sealed 
m aking it perfect for use in factories, 
wet areas, and retail environm ents 
(Figure 7.32).
• The Ergodex DX1 is a 
recently developed input 
system  th a t differs from 
your standard keyboard. 
It is available with 25 to 
50 keys and an 11-inch x 
9.3-inch pad you connect 
to your com puter through 
a high-speed USB connec­
tor. Using its M anager 
application, you can 
m anipulate the location 
of the keys to create a

and respond to the program you are using. 
Pointing devices can also be used as a pen­
cil or brush to input lines and shapes in 
graphic program s.
The most widely used pointing device is 
the m ouse; a palm-sized device th a t moves 
about on a clean, flat surface. The direction 
and speed of the mouse is m irrored by the 
on-screen pointer, and other actions are ini­
tiated by using buttons located on the top 
or on the side of the mouse.
V ariations of the mouse include:
• An optical mouse, which makes use of 
an LED (light-em itting diode) light on 
the underside of the mouse and a small 
cam era th at takes continuous images 
of the changes in the surface under the 
mouse as it is moved (Figure 7.37).
• Notebook users may like the travel 
m ouse, a pointing device half the size 
of a norm al mouse, but w ith all the 
sam e capabilities.
• The w heel m ouse, developed by 
Microsoft, includes a rotating wheel 
to scroll text vertically w ithin a docu­
m ent or on a Web page.
• The w ireless mouse, also called a 
cordless m ouse, elim inates the cord 
and transm its infrared or radio sig­
nals (RF) to a base station receiver 
on the com puter. The infrared mouse 
requires line of sight to the receiver.
w hereas the RF variety 
uses radio waves th a t 
tran sm it in a w ider pat­
tern allowing the mouse 
to be positioned further 
from the system  unit.
• An a ir  m ouse is a 
m otion-sensing device 
th a t recognizes the typi­
cal forward, back, left, 
and right motions made 
by a mouse. This device 
does not need to rest on 
a surface to function. In­
stead, it works as it moves 
through the air. This al­
lows for other directions 
of motion, like up and 
down, to be programmed 
to control such media ele­
m ents as volume and fast 
forw ard.
Although the mouse is the most popular 
pointing device, there are alternatives that 
work well when desktop space is limited or 
nonexistent or for actions th at are associated 
with gaming, ATMs, and managing hand­
held devices. You might be fam iliar with 
some of the following input, alternatives:
• A tra ckb a ll is a stationary pointing 
device th a t contains a movable ball 
held in a cradle. The on-screen pointer 
moves by rotating the ball with your 
fingers or palm . From one to three 
keys can be located in various posi­
tions to perform the equivalent of a 
click and right-click.
• A p o in tin g  stick is a pointing device 
th at looks like a pencil eraser usually 
positioned between the G, H, and B 
keys on notebook com puters.
• A to u ch p a d , also called a trackpad. 
is a small, stationary, pressure-sensitive, 
flat surface located on a notebook. An 
area is set aside along the right and 
bottom edges of the pad to accommo­
date vertical or horizontal scroll op­
erations created when you slide your 
finger in these reserved sections.
• A variation of the touchpad is the 
click w heel, a pad th a t looks like 
a circle and uses a circular motion 
to move through song lists, movie 
lists, or photos. The click wheel is the 
method of navigation on the iPod and 
the iPod touch.

• Com m and system s recognize only a 
few hundred words and elim inate 
using the mouse or keyboard for 
repetitive commands like open file 
or close file.
• Discrete voice recognition system s are 
used for dictation but require a pause

FIG U RE 7.41 Scanners convert not only written or 
printed documents into digital data, but also convert other 
items like photos and film negatives.
A sca n n er is an autom ated form of 
input th a t copies anything you enter on a 
sheet of paper, including artw ork, hand­
w riting, and typed or printed text, and 
converts the content into a graphic image 
for input into a computer. The scanner 
does not recognize or differentiate the type 
of m aterial it is scanning. Everything is 
converted by default into a graphic 
b itm a p p ed  im age, a representation of 
an im age as a m atrix of dots called picture 
elem ents (pixels). All images acquired by 
your digital cam era and camcorder, scan­
ner, and screen capture program are b it­
m apped images. Scanners can use optical 
ch a ra c te r recognition (OCR) software 
to convert scanned text into a text file in­
stead of a bitm apped image.
There are several types of scanners 
(Figure 7.41):
• Flatbed scanners copy item s placed on 
a stationary glass surface. They are 
good for books or other bulky objects 
or docum ents th a t you do not w ant to 
bend.
• Sheet-fed scanners use a roller m echa­
nism to draw in m ultiple sheets of 
paper, one sheet at a time, and are 
useful for high-volume scanning.
• Film scanner takes an image from a 
film negative or a slide, digitizes it 
into bitm ap format, and sends it to 
the com puter to be edited, enhanced, 
saved, and outputted.
• H andheld scanners are sim ilar to 
sheet-fed scanners in th at the item 
to be copied m ust pass through the 
scanner. They are sm all, portable, and 
used to copy business cards, receipts, 
m agazine articles, sm all photos, or 
business docum ents.
• 3D scanners analyze real-world input by 
collecting information on the item being 
scanned, including shape, appearance, 
and color. A three-dimensional model of 
the image is generated by the scanner. 
This type of scanner is popular in video 
game design, production quality control, 
medicine, industrial design, and in the 
entertainm ent and movie industry.
O ther exam ples of input devices 
include:
• A handheld or desktop-m ounted bar 
code reader can scan an item ’s U ni­
versal Product Code (UPC). Bar codes 
are used to update inventory, ensure 
correct pricing, and track packages.
• Have you ever taken a test and used a 
no. 2 pencil to fill in your answers on 
a grid-like Scantron test form? A spe­
cial scanning device called an optical 
m a rk reader (OMR) scans the m arks 
made by your pencil and compares 
your answ er against a Scantron form 
with the correct answ ers subm itted by 
your instructor.
• Radio frequency identification technol­
ogy uses an RFID  reader to detect ra­
dio signals em itted from a tag placed 
on an item. The signal em itted by
the tag is picked up by RFID readers 
mounted on a wall and does not have 
to be scanned by a handheld scanning 
device. The tags are inexpensive and 
can be embedded w ithin the packaging 
of the product (Figure 7.42).
• M agnetic-ink character recognition

input characters printed w ith special 
ink like those on the bottom of your 
checks and some billing statem ents. 
When the check or statem ent is re­
turned to the creator, the num bers are 
scanned by an MICR reader and input 
into the com pany’s data system . No 
hum an entry is needed and thus no 
hum an error occurs.
A m a g n etic stripe card reader can 
detect and read information stored 
on m agnetic strips th at are usually 
located on the back of credit cards, gift 
cards, and other cards of sim ilar use.
A biom etric input device uses physi­
cal or chemical features of an individ­
ual’s body to provide a unique method 
of identification. The device analyzes a 
feature, for example, a fingerprint, reti­
nal pattern, or voice pattern, to identify 
the owner as a legitimate user (Figure 
7.43). M any laptops are equipped with 
biometric fingerprint to serve as a 
means of identification and authentica­
tion, and also to act as a theft deterrent. 
Devices like a d ig ita l cam era and 
d ig ita l video cam era input images 
and video into your system  directly 
through a USB or FireW ire port.

O u tp u t devices enable people to see, 
hear, and even feel the results of process­
ing operations. The most widely used out­
put devices are m onitors and printers.
Concept 7.25 Analyzing 
Monitors
M onitors are screens th a t display your 
data and processed inform ation, which is 
called output. The screen display, called 
soft copy, is not a perm anent record. To 
perm anently keep the inform ation dis­
played on your screen, you m ust save it to 
a storage device or p rin t it. Printed output 
is often called h a rd  copy.
There are two basic types of monitors: 
the big cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitors 
th at are very bulky and are usually con­
nected to older desktop computers, and the 
thin, popular liquid crystal display—LCD— 
monitors like those th at accompany newer 
desktops and all-in-one units. The LCD is 
also incorporated on notebooks, handheld 
computers, and sm artphones (Figure 7.44).

flat-panel displays, have largely replaced

CRT monitors. An LCD screen is a grid of 
pixels—a term  shortened from the words 
picture element. A pixel is the sm allest 
single elem ent of a display. A florescent 
panel at the back of the system generates 
light waves to make the images and colors. 
These waves pass through a layer of crystal 
solution. The electric current moves the 
crystals and either blocks the light or lets it 
through, thus creating the images and col­
ors viewable on the display (Figure 7.45).
You m ight be surprised to find th a t an 
LCD display is not your only option. OLED 
(organic lig h t em ittin g  diode) displays 
are becoming popular. Unlike LCDs, which 
require backlighting, OLED displays are

plates of glass called the seal and substrate 
(Figure 7.46). These displays are extremely 
thin and lightweight, and produce out­
standing color, contrast, brightness, and 
viewing angles. Sales for OLED displays 
hit 1 billion in 2009 and are predicted to 
exceed 6 billion by 2015.
Flexible OLED displays (FOLED) 
will revolutionize the advertising and mo­
tion picture industries and increase the 
ease and portability of output (Figure 
7.47). FOLED displays can be paper-thin 
and appear as posters on walls. In addi­
tion, these displays can be made so small 
and flexible th at they can be worn on your 
w rist and used to watch a movie or surf 
the Web. If you think th a t the possibilities 
for entertainm ent are endless, ju st imag­
ine the m ilitary and security applications 
th a t will develop from this technology.
Concept 7.26 Classifying 
Printers
P rinters produce a perm anent version, or 
hard copy, of the output on the com puter’s 
display screen. Some of the most popu­
lar printers are inkjet printers and laser 
printers.

pensive nonim pact printers th a t produce

sm all jets onto a sheet of paper, creating 
the desired character shapes.
A laser p rin te r is a high-resolution 
nonim pact printer th a t uses an electro­
static reproductive technology sim ilar to 
th a t used by copiers (Figure 7.49). U nder 
the p rinter’s computerized control, a laser 
beam creates electrical charges on a ro­
tatin g  print drum . These charges attract 
toner, which is transferred to the paper 
and fused to its surface by a h eat process. 
Laser printers print faster than inkjets; 
some laser printers can produce 60 or 
more pages per minute. Black-and-white 
laser printers are increasingly affordable 
and generally have a lower per-page p rin t 
cost than inkjet printers.
T herm al-transfer p rin ters use a 
heat process to transfer an impression 
onto paper. There are two types of therm al 
printers. Therm al-wax transfer print­
ers adhere a wax-based ink onto paper, 
w hereas direct therm al printers burn dots 
onto coated paper when the paper passes 
over a line of heating elem ents. Therm al 
p rinters are popular for mobile printing, 
for exam ple, generating an in stan t receipt 
for a car rental or a traffic ticket by police 
officer (Figure 7.50).
F I G U R E  7.. 1 
Plotters are useful for printing oversized 
output such as maps, charts, and blueprints.
Photo p rin ters are either inkjet or 
laser printers and use special inks and 
good-quality photo paper to produce pic­
tures th a t are as good as those generated 
by commercial photo developers.
A p lo tter is a printer th at produces 
high-quality images by physically moving 
ink pens over the surface of the paper. A 
continuous-curve plotter draw s maps from 
stored data such as those used by cartogra­
phers and w eather analysts (Figure 7.51).
Concept 7.27 Examining 
Additional Output Devices
In addition to m onitors and printers, 
several other m ethods of obtaining 
output from your com puter system  exist, 
including the following:
• Speakers: All com puter systems include

More than 700 million inkjet and laser 
toner cartridges are sold every year. 
What happens when they are empty? 
Although many organizations and retail 
stores have recycling programs, every 
second nearly eight used cartridges 
are thrown away in the United States— 
approximately 875 million pounds of en­
vironmental waste each year! So what 
can you do? Take advantage of your 
local recycling program. Keeping them 
out of the waste stream reduces toxic­
ity levels and saves landfill space. Addi­
tionally, a half-gallon of oil is saved for 
every toner cartridge you recycle!

Concept 7.28 Distinguishing 
Between Memory and Storage
To understand the distinction between 
memory and storage, think of the last 
tim e you worked at your desk. In your file 
draw er, you store all your personal items 
and papers, such as your checking ac­
count statem ents. The file draw er is good 
for long-term  storage. When you decide to 
work on one or more of these item s, you 
take it out of storage and put it on your 
desk. Com puters work the sam e way.
W hen you w ant to work with the contents 
of a file, the com puter transfers the file 
from storage to a tem porary workplace 
called RAM (random access memory).
Concept 7.29 Understanding 
Hard Disk Drives
On alm ost all computers, the hard disk 
drive is by far the most im portant stor­
age device. A ha rd  disk drive—or simply 
h a rd  drive—is a high-capacity, high­
speed storage device, usually housed in the 
system unit, th at consists of several high 
capacity, rapidly rotating, magnetically 
coated disks called pla tters on which your 
programs, data, and processed results are 
stored. To communicate with the CPU, 
hard disks require a hard d isk control­
ler, which is an electronic circuit board that 
provides an interface between the CPU and 
the hard disk’s electronics. The controller 
may be located on the computer’s m other­
board, on an expansion card, or within the 
hard disk.
The com puter’s hard disk, also referred 
to as secondary storage or fixed storage, 
can also be categorized as both random 
access and magnetic storage. A random  
access storage device can go directly to 
the requested data without having to go 
through a sequential order. M agnetic stor­
age devices use disks th at are coated with 
magnetically sensitive m aterial and use 
a read/w rite head to record information 
by transform ing electrical impulses into 
a varying magnetic field. As the magnetic 
m aterials pass beneath the read/write head, 
this varying field forces the particles to be 
rearranged in a meaningful pattern of posi­
tive and negative magnetic indicators th at 
represent the oil’and on bit patterns used 
to represent data. This operation is called 
writing. When reading, the read/write head 
senses the recorded pattern and transforms 
this pattern into electrical impulses that are 
decoded into text characters.
How does the read/write head know 
where to look for data in order to access it 
randomly? To answer this question, you need 
to know a little about how stored data is 
organized on a disk. Disks are formatted— 
physically laid out—in circular bands called 
tracks. Each track is divided into pie-shaped 
wedges called sectors. Two or more sectors 
combine to form a cluster (Figure 7.55).
To keep track of w here specific files are 
located, the com puter’s operating

system  records a table of inform ation, like 
a directory, on the disk. This table contains 
the nam e of each file and the file’s exact 
location, actually the cluster, sector, and 
track it is located on the disk. The current 
system  for Windows NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 
and Windows 7 is known as N TF S (new 
technology file system ). Its improved 
security and encryption ability provide 
another layer of protection for stored data.
Factors th a t affect a hard disk's per­
formance include:
• O bstacles, such as a dust or smoke 
particle, on the disk surface th at cause 
the read/w rite head to bounce on the 
disk surface, preventing accurate 
reading or writing.
• M ajor jolts, such as one caused by 
dropping or severely bum ping a com­
puter while the hard disk is running. 
This action could cause a head crash, 
the dragging of the read/w rite head 
across the hard disk surface, resulting 
in had sectors—areas of the disk th a t 
have become dam aged and can no lon­
ger reliably hold data.
• Access tim e, which is the amount of 
time it takes a device from the request 
for the information to the delivery of 
that information. Ac­
cess time includes the
seek tim e, the time it 
takes the read/write 
head to locate the data 
before reading begins.
• Position ing p er­
form ance, which is

drive activity until

positioned the read/write head 
so th at it can begin transferring 
data.
• T ransfer perform ance,
which is the tim e it takes the 
read/write head to transfer data 
from the disk to random access 
memory.
Besides a hard drive being 
used for storage in your personal 
computer, it can also be used on a 
larger scale as network attached 
storage (NAS) and remote stor­
age. N etw ork a tta ch ed  storage 
(NAS) devices are becoming more 
a cluster, 
popular as the dem ands for data 
storage increase. NAS devices 
consist prim arily of hard drives 
or other media used for data storage, are 
attached directly to a network, and are 
accessed by com puters on the network. Re­
m ote storage, som etim es referred to as an 
Internet h a rd  d rive . is storage space on a 
server th at is accessible from the Internet. 
In most cases, you subscribe to the storage 
service and agree to ren t a block of storage 
space for a specific period of time. Instead 
of sending e-mail attachm ents to share 
with family and friends, you might simply 
post the files to the rem ote storage site and 
then allow them  to be viewed or retrieved 
by others. You m ight save backup copies 
of critical files or all the data on your hard 
disk to your Internet hard drive.
The key advantage of this type of re­
mote storage is the ability to access data 
from any location and from any device that 
connects with the Internet. The concerns 
about using remote storage center on such 
issues as data security, data corruption, and 
the possibility that the company offering the 
Internet storage may go out of business.
Concept 7.30 Examining 
Portable Storage Options
Although hard disks are currently the main 
storage media on most systems, newer por­
table devices are im portant 
in our mobile society. Port­
able storage (remov­
able storage) means 
that you can remove the 
device from one computer 
and insert it into another 
computer. A flash drive 
refers to a type of storage 
device that uses solid-state 
circuitry and has no mov­
ing parts (Figure 7.56). A

TECHNOLOGY 
ON THE JOB
As a Marketing Assistant in the field of en­
tertainment, you need both marketing skills 
and technology skills. Because companies 
are striving to understand their customers 
and respond to customer needs quickly, 
you also need Internet skills and social net­
working skills. Review the list of technol­
ogy skills recently posted for a position of 
Marketing Assistant. Are you surprised at 
the level of technology required? Do you 
already possess any of these skills? Indi­
viduals in this type of position often travel, 
so knowledge of portable devices, backup 
procedures, and network attached storage 
(NAS) or Internet storage is critical in order 
to maintain communication with team mem­
bers and guarantee the availability of data.
Try to gain as much experience in these
areas as possible.
Technology skills recently posted for a

• Preparing press releases, company news­
letters, and event announcements.
• Updating company headlines and news 
in the corporate Web site.
• Assisting in promotional strategies.
Flash drive is also known as a solid-state 
drive (SSD) and uses flash m em ory, which 
is nonvolatile, memory that stores data 
electronically on a chip in sections known 
as blocks. Rather than erasing data byte by 
byte, flash memory uses an electrical charge 
to delete all of the data on the chip or just 
the data contained in a specific block, which 
is a much faster method than other types of 
storage use. Because of their lack of moving 
parts, lower power consumption, and lighter 
weight, flash drives are becoming an alterna­
tive to hard drives.
USB flash drives, also known as 
m em ory sticks, thum b drives, or ju m p  
drives, are one of the most popular portable 
secondary storage devices because of their 
small size and universal ease of use. USB 
flash drives work with both the PC and the 
Mac. No power supply or device instructions 
are needed; ju st plug it into a USB port 
and it is ready to read and write. USB flash 
drives come in different designs and novelty 
shapes; m any include security and encryp­
tion software to help protect your data in 
case the drive is lost (Figure 7.57).
CD drives and DVD drives are re­
ferred to as optical storage devices. O pti­
cal storage devices use tightly focused laser 
beam s to read m inute patterns of data en­
coded on the surface of plastic discs (Figure 
7.58 ). The format of a CD or DVD includes 
microscopic indentations called p its th at 
scatter the laser’s light in certain areas. 
The drive’s light-sensing device receives no 
light from these areas, so it sends a signal
*  I
to the computer th at corresponds to 
a 0 in the com puter’s binary num ­
bering system. Flat reflective areas 
called lands bounce the light back 
to a light-sensing device, which sends 
a signal equivalent to a binary 1.
Several types of optical read/write 
media and devices are available. Many 
PCs include a com bination drive th at 
reads and w rites CDs and DVDs. For 
this reason, these storage devices are 
a popular, cost-effective alternative me­
dium for backup and storage purposes. 
Looking at each a little closer should help 
you clarify their features. Notice th at 
when the storage m edium  is optical, the 
correct spelling is disc. M agnetic storage

the following devices:
• CD-ROM (short for com pact disc

USB flash drives are very popular, but 
many experts worry that they pose a 
great security risk. Some companies 
are so concerned about corporate es­
pionage that they disable USB ports 
to prevent the unauthorized copying 
of data. Even so, many people carry a 
lot of critical or personal data on their 
USB flash drives. What are the implica­
tions if the device is lost? Should USB 
drive manufacturers be required to pro­
vide a means of securing these devices 
or some type of registration process? 
With such processes in place, a lost de­
vice could be returned to the manufac­
turer and matched to the owner. What 
actions should individuals take to safe­
guard their data? Is hooking a USB flash 
drive to your backpack or keychain a

drive and did not know who it belonged 
to, what would you do? What should

is th at they are relatively inexpensive.
• CD-RW (short for co m p a ct d isc-

• DVDs come in two standards. The first 
(newer) format is the DVD+ (DVD

two types of discs, DVD+R and the 
DVD+RW. DVD+R is a recordable 
form at th a t enables the disc to be w rit­
ten to one tim e and read m any times. 
The DVD+RW is a recordable format 
th at enables the disc to be rew ritten to

• The second DVD format, which is older, 
is the DVD- (DVD dash) standard. 
DVD-R operates the same way as 
CD-R; you can write to the
disc once and read from it many times. 
With DVD-RW, you can write to, erase, 
and read from the disc many times.
One of the new est forms of optical 
storage is Blu-ray, also known as Blu-ray 
Disc. The nam e is derived from the blue- 
violet laser beam s (blue rays) used to read 
and w rite data. The B lu-ray Disc (BD) 
form at was developed to enable recording, 
rew riting, and playing back of high-defi- 
nition video (HD), as well as storing large 
am ounts of data. The form at offers more 
than five tim es the storage capacity of a 
traditional DVD.

Anticipating 
Future Storage Options and 
Problems
In response to the explosive dem and for 
more storage capacity, designers are creat­
ing storage media and devices th at store 
larger am ounts of data and retrieve it 
more quickly. Examples of these trends 
are:
• H olographic storage uses two laser 
beam s to create a pattern on photo­
sensitive media, resulting in a three- 
dim ensional image sim ilar to the 
hologram s you can buy in a novelty

your system’s RAM memory.
shop. Although still under develop­
m ent, it is anticipated th a t this 3-D 
approach will enable much higher- 
density storage capacities enabling 
you to store 50,000 music files on an 
object the size of a postage stamp!
• The Eye-Fi w ireless m em ory card 
is a storage device for digital photog­
raphy th a t uses w ireless circuitry to 
connect w ith your PC or send pictures 
directly from your digital cam era to 
your favorite online photo site.
• R acetrack m em ory, under develop­
m ent by S tu art Parkin and his col­
leagues at IBM's Almaden Research 
Center, uses the spin of electrons to 
store information. This allows the 
memory to operate at much higher 
speeds than today’s storage media, 
which is a boon for transferring and 
£ 
retrieving data. It is anticipated th a t 
racetrack memory will consume much 
less power, and could enable iPods 
to store 500,000 songs instead of the 
-5 
40,000 th at the largest units can h an ­
dle today.
Any secondary storage device, like a 
USB drive or a hard drive, will at some 
point get dam aged or lost and be irretriev­
able. As a wise com puter user, you m ust 
have a backup strategy in place and use it.
A backup  is a copy of program s, data, and 
inform ation saved on one secondary stor­
age medium th a t is duplicated to another.
Backing up on a regular schedule could 
avoid the loss of critical data and inform a­
tion that, in a business environm ent, could 
lead to lost revenue.

Chapter Summary
System Components, Input/Output 
Devices, and Storage Devices
• The basic unit of inform ation in a com puter is 
the bit—a single circuit whose electrical state is 
represented by th e binary digits of 0 or 1. A se­
quence of eight bits, called a byte, represents the 
basic letters, num bers, and punctuation m arks 
of most languages. Bits are used to describe data 
transfer rates, w hereas bytes describe storage 
capacity.
• The system  unit contains the m otherboard, mem­
ory, circuits, power supply, cooling fan(s), internal 
speakers, drive bays for storage devices, and ex­
pansion cards.
• The com puter’s m otherboard contains the micro­
processor, the system  clock, the chipset, memory 
modules, and expansion slots.
• The com puter’s central processing unit (CPU) pro­
cesses data in a four-step m achine cycle using two 
components: the control unit and the arithm etic 
logic unit (ALU).
• The perform ance of the m icroprocessor is deter­
mined by the num ber of transistors, their proxim­
ity to each other, processing speed, the data bus 
w idth and word size, clock speed, operations per­
formed per microprocessing cycle, the use of paral­
lel processing, and the type of chip.
The com puter’s main memory is random  access 
memory known as RAM, and holds programs, 
data, and instructions currently in use for quick 
access by the processor.
Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 cache, physically 
positioned w ithin or close to the CPU, operates at 
speeds faster than RAM and holds d ata accessed 
by the processor.
Read-only memory (ROM) holds prerecorded sta rt­
up operating instructions.
A variety of ports and connectors enable peripheral 
devices, such as USB drives, external hard drives, 
digital cam eras, and iPods, to function effectively. 
The com puter’s main input devices are the key­
board and mouse.
Monitors display data and processed inform ation. 
Types of monitors include CRT, LCD, and OLED. 
Printers are output devices th a t produce hard 
copy. The most popular printers use inkjet or laser 
technology.
Storage devices save program s, data, and inform a­
tion on storage media th a t retain inform ation even 
when the power is switched off. Storage devices 
include hard disk, CDs, DVDs, and solid-state 
devices as USB, (lash drives, ExpressC ards, flash 
memory cards, and sm art cards.

In the lower right corner of the screen, in the horizontal scroll bar, click the right scroll arrow one tim e to shift 
column A out ol view.
A column is a vertical group of cells in a worksheet. Beginning with the first letter of the alphabet, A, a unique letter 
identifies each column—this is called the column heading. Clicking one of the horizontal scroll bar arrows shifts the 
window either left or right one column at a time.
3 
Point to the right scroll arrow, and then hold down the left m ouse button until the colum ns begin to scroll 
rapidly to the right; release the m ouse button when you begin to see pairs of letters as the colum n headings.
4  
Slowly drag the horizontal scroll box to the left, and notice that just above the scroll box, ScreenTips with the 
colum n letters display as you drag. Orag the horizontal scroll box left or right—or click the left or right scroll 
arrow —as necessary to position column Z near the center ol your screen.
Column headings after column Z use two letters starting with AA, AB, and so on through ZZ. After that, columns 
begin with three letters beginning with AAA. This pattern provides 16,384 columns. The last column is XFD.
5 
In the lower left portion o f your screen, click the Sheet2 tab.
The second worksheet displays and is the active sheet. Column A displays at the left.
6 
In the vertical scroll bar, click the down scroll arrow one tim e to m ove Row 1 out ot view.
A row is a horizontal group of cells. Beginning with number I, a unique number identifies each row—this is the row 
heading, located at the left side of the worksheet. A single worksheet has 1,048,576 rows.
Project HA: Sales Report with Kmbedded Column Chart and Sparklines | GO! All In One

7  
In the lower left corner, click the Sheetl tab. Use the skills you just practiced to scroll horizontally to display 
column A, and if necessary, row 1.
The first worksheet in the workbook becomes the active worksheet. By default, new workbooks contain three 
worksheets. When you save a workbook, the worksheets are contained within it and do not have separate file names.
Objective 2 | Enter Data in a Worksheet
Cell content, which is anything you type in a cell, can be one of two things: either a 
constant value—referred to simply as a value—or a formula. A formula is an equation that 
perform s mathem atical calculations on values in your worksheet. The m ost com m only used 
values are text values and number values, but a value can also include a date or a tim e o f day.
Activity 8.03 
Entering Text and Using AutoComplete
A text value, also referred to as a label, usually provides inform ation about num ber values in other worksheet 
cells. For example, a title such as First Q uarter Accessory Sales gives the reader an indication that the data in the 
worksheet relates to inform ation about sales of accessories during the three-m onth period January through March.
1 
Click the Sheetl tab to m ake it the active sheet, if necessary. Point to and then click the cell at the intersection 
of column A and row l to m ake it the active cell— the cell is outlined in black and ready to accept data.
The intersecting column letter and row number form the ccll reference—also called ihe cell address. When a cell is 
active, its column letter and row number are highlighted. The cell reference of the selected cell, A l, displays in the 
Name Box.
2  
W ith cell AI as the active cell, type the title Texas Spectrum  Wireless and then press [Biter]. C om pare your screen 
with Figure 8.7.
Text or numbers in a cell are referred to as data. You must confirm the data you type in a cell by pressing [Enter] or 
by some other keyboard movement, such as pressing [Tab] or an arrow key. Pressing [Enter] moves the active cell to the 
cell below.

Auto Fill generates and extends a series of values into adjacent cells based on the value of other cells. A series is a 
group of things that come one after another in succession; for example, January, February, March. The Auto Fill 
Options button displays options to fill the data; options vary depending on the content and program from which 
you are filling, and the format of the data you are filling. Fill Series is selected, indicating the action that was taken. 
Because the options are related to the current task, the button is referred to as being context sensitive.

In the column heading area, point to the vertical line between column A and column B to display the 
pointer, press and hold dow n the left m ouse button, and then com pare your screen with Figure 8 .11.
A ScreenTip displays information about the width of the column. The default width of a column is 64 pixels. A pixel, 
short for picture element, is a point of light measured in dots per square inch. Sixty-four pixels equal 8.43 characters, 
which is the average number of digits that will fit in a cell using the default font. The default font in Excel is Calibri 
and the default font size is 11.
Drag to the right, and when the num ber of pixels indicated in the ScreenTip reaches 100 pixels, release the
m ouse button. If you are not satisfied with your result, click U ndo

Point to ccll B3 and then drag across to select cells B3, C3, and D3. C om pare your screen w ith Figure 8.12.
The three cells, B3 through D3, are selected and form a range—two or more cells on a worksheet that are adjacent 
(next to each other) or nonadjacent (not next to each other). This range of cells is referred to as B3:D3. When you 
see a colon (:) between two cell references, the range includes all the cells between the two cell references. A range 
of cells that is selected in this manner is indicated by a dark border, and Excel treats the range as a single unit so you 
can make the same changes to more than one cell at a time. The selected cells in the range are highlighted except for 
the first cell in the range, which displays in the Name Box.

Objective 3 | Construct and Copy Formulas and 
Use the SUM Function
A cell contains either a constant value (text or num bers) or a formula. A form ula is an 
equation that perform s m athem atical calculations on values in other cells, and then places 
the result in the cell containing the form ula. You can create form ulas or use a function —a 
prew ritten formula that looks at one or m ore values, perform s an operation, and then 
returns a value.
Activity 8.07 
Constructing a Formula and Using the SUM Function
In this activity, you will practice three different ways to sum  a group of num bers in Excel.
1 
Click cell B8 to m ake it the active cell and type =
I he equal sign (=) displays in the cell with the insertion point blinking, ready to accept more data. All formulas 
begin with the = sign, which signals Excel to begin a calculation. The Formula Bar displays the = sign, and the 
Formula Bar Cancel and Enter buttons display.
2 
At the insertion point, type b 4  and then com pare your screen with Figure 8 .15.
A list of Excel functions that begin with the letter li may briefly display—as you progress in your study of Excel, you 
will use functions ot this type. A blue border with small corner boxes surrounds cell B4, which indicates that the cell 
is part of an active formula. The color used in the box matches the color of the cell reference in the formula.

A border of another color surrounds cell B5, and the color matches the color of the cell reference in the active 
formula. When typing cell references, it is not necessary to use uppercase letters.
At the insertion point, type +b6+b7 and then press [Enter!.
The result of the formula calculation—170279.1—displays in the cell. Recall that in the default General format, 
trailing zeros do not display.
Click cell B8 again, look at the Formula Bar, and then com pare your screen with Figure 8.16.
The formula adds the values in cells B4 through B7, and the result displays in cell B8. In this manner, you can 
construct a formula by typing. Although cell B8 displays the result of the formula, the formula itself displays in the 
Formula Bar. This is referred to as the underlying formula. Always view the Formula Bar to be sure of the exact 
content of a cell—a displayed number may actually be a formula.

displays in cell D8. The = sign signals the beginning of a formula, SUM indicates the type of calculation that will 
take place (addition), and (D4:D7) indicates the range of cells on which the sum calculation will be performed. A 
ScreenTip provides additional information about the action.

9  Look at the Form ula Bar, and notice that the form ula also displays there. Then, look again at the cells 
surrounded by the m oving border.
When you activate the Sum function, Excel first looks above the active cell for a range of cells to sum. If no range is 
above the active cell, Excel will look to the left for a range of cells to sum. If the proposed range is not what you want 
to calculate, you can select a different group of cells.
10  Press |nter) to construct a form ula by using the prew ritten SUM function.
Your total is 259652.9. Because the Sum function is frequently used, il has its own button in the Editing group on 
the Home tab of the Ribbon. A larger version of the button also displays on the Formulas tab in the Function Library 
group. This button is also referred to as AutoSum.
11 Notice that the totals in the range B8:D8 display only one decimal place. Click Save [U
Number values that are too long to fit in the cell do not spill over into the unoccupied cell to the right in the same 
manner as text values. Rather, Excel rounds the number to lit the space. Rounding is a procedure that determines 
which digit at the right of the number will be the last digit displayed and then increases it by one if the next digit lo 
its right is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Activity 8.08 
Copying a Formula by Using the Fill Handle
You have practiced three ways to create a form ula—by typing, by using the point-and-click technique, and by 
using a function button from  the Ribbon. You can also copy formulas. W hen you copy a form ula from  one cell to 
another, Excel adjusts the cell references to fit the new location of the formula.

Click cell E3, type Total and then press [Enter).
The text in cell E3 is centered because the centered format continues from the adjacent cell.

l_AltJ + L^J is the keyboard shortcut for the Sum function. Recall that Kxcel first looks above the selected cell for a 
proposed range of cells to sum, and if no data is detected, Excel looks to the left and proposes a range of cells to sum.

Objective 5 | Chart Data to Create a Column Chart 
and Insert Sparklines
A chart is a graphic representation of data in a worksheet. D ata presented as a chart is 
easier to understand than a table o f num bers. Sparklines are tiny charts em bedded in a cell 
and give a visual trend sum m ary alongside your data. A sparkline m akes a pattern m ore 
obvious to the eye.
Activity 8.11 
Charting Data in a Column Chart
In this activity, you will create a column chart show ing the m onthly sales of accessories 
first quarter. A colum n chart is useful for illustrating com parisons am ong related num bers.
1 
Select the range A3:D7. Click the Insert tab, and then in the Charts group, click Column to display a gallery of 
C olum n chart types.
When charting data, typically you should not include totals—include only the data you want to compare. By using 
different chart types, you can display data in a way that is meaningful to the reader—common examples are column 
charts, pie charts, and line charts.
2 
O n the gallery of colum n chart types, under 2-D Column, point to the first chart to display the ScreenTip 
Clustered Column, and then click to select it. C om pare your screen with Figure 8.23.
A column chart displays in the worksheet, and the charted data is bordered by colored lines.

pointer, and then drag the upper left corner of the chart 
just inside the upper left corner of cell A10, approxim ately as shown in Figure 8.24.
Based on the data you selected in your worksheet, Excel constructs a column chart and adds category labels—the 
labels that display along the bottom of the chart to identify the category of data. This area is referred to as the 
category axis or the x-axis. Excel uses the row titles as the category names. On the left, Excel includes a numerical 
scale on which the charted data is based; this is ihe value axis or the y-axis. On the right, a legend, which identifies 
the patterns or colors that are assigned to the categories in the chart, displays.
Figure 8.24
Legend represents green 
bordered cells
C olum ns represent 
blue bordered cells

called x-axis, represents

On the Ribbon, locate the contextual tabs under Chart Tools— Design, Layout, and Format.
When a chart is selected, Chart Tools become available and three tabs provide commands for working with the 
chart.
5 
Locate the group o f cells bordered in blue.
Each of the twelve cells bordered in blue is referred lo as a data point—a value that originates in a worksheet cell. 
Each data point is represented in ihe chart by a data marker—a column, bar, area, dot, pie slice, or other symbol in a 
chart that represents a single daia point. Related data points form a data series; for example, there is a data series lor 
January, for February, and for March. Each data scries has a unique color or pattern represented in the chart legend.

O n the Design lab of the Ribbon, in the Data group, click the Switch Row/Column button, an d  then com pare 
your chart with Figure 8.25.
In this manner, you can easily change the categories of data from the row titles, which is the default, to the column 
titles. Whether you use row or column titles as your category names depends on how you want to view your charted 
data. Here, the president wants to see monthly sales and the breakdown of product categories within each month.

Entering Data by Range
1 
Select the range B4:D9, type 1126 and then press (Biterl.
The value displays in cell B4, and cell B5 becomes the active cell.

After you enter the last value and press (Enter), the active cell moves to the top of the next column within the selected 
range. Although it is not required to enter data in this manner, you can see that selecting the range before you enter 
data saves time because it confines the movement of the active cell to the selected range.

Activity 8.20 
Copying Formulas Containing Absolute Cell References
In a formula, a relative cell reference refers to a cell by its position in relation to the cell that contains the 
formula. An absolute cell reference, on the other hand, refers to a cell by its fixed position in the worksheet, for 
example, the total in cell EIO.
A relative cell reference autom atically adjusts when a form ula is copied. In some calculations, you do not want 
the cell reference to adjust; rather, you want the cell reference to rem ain the same when the form ula is copied.

Click cell F4, type = and then click cell E4. Type / and then click cell EIO.
The formula =E4/E10 indicates that the value in cell E4 will be divided by the value in cell EIO to display the 
percentage by which each product’s Total Retail Value makes up the Total Retail Value for All Products.
The result will be a percentage expressed as a decimal.
Press (Biterl. Click cell F4 and notice that the form ula displays in the Formula Bar. Then, point to cell F4 and 
double-click.
The formula, with the two referenced cells displayed in color and bordered with the same color, displays in the cell. 
This feature, called the range finder, is useful for verifying formulas because it visually indicates which workbook 
cells are included in a formula calculation.
Press (Enterl to redisplay the result o f the calculation in the cell, and notice that approxim ately 8% o f the total 
retail value of the inventory is m ade up of A ntenna Signal Boosters.
Click cell F4 again, and then drag the fill handle down through cell F9. C om pare your screen with Figure 8.41
Each cell displays an error message—#D/W0/ and a green triangle in the upper left corner of each cell indicates that 
Excel detects an error. Like a grammar checker, Excel uses rules to check for formula errors and Hags errors in this 
manner. Additionally, the Auto Fill Options button displays, from which you can select formatting options for the 
copied cells.

Click cell F5, and to the left of the cell, point to the Error Checking button 1^ W1 to display its ScreenTip— The 
formula or function used is dividing by zero or empty cells.
In this manner, Excel suggests the cause of an error.
6 
Look at the Formula Bar and exam ine the form ula.
The formula is =E5/E11. The cell reference to E5 is correct, but the cell reference following the division operator (/) 
is Ell, and El 1 is an empty cell.
7  
Click cell F6, point to the Error Checking button 1^ 'I  and in the Formula Bar exam ine the form ula.
Because the cell references are relative, Excel builds the formulas by increasing the row number for each equation. 
But in this calculation, the divisor must always be the value in cell EIO—the Total Retail Value for All Products.
8  
Point to cell F4, and then double-click to place the insertion point w ithin the cell. W ithin the cell, use the 
arrow  keys as necessary to position the insertion point to the left of EIO, and then press fF4~ 1. C om pare your 
screen with Figure 8.42.
Dollar signs ($) display, which changes the reference to cell EIO to an absolute cell reference. The use of the dollar 
sign to denote an absolute reference is not related in any way to whether or not the values you are working with are 
currency values. It is simply the symbol that Excel uses to denote an absolute cell reference.

For each formula, the cell reference for the Total Retail Value of each product changed relative to its row; however, 
the value used as the divisor—Total Retail Value for All Products in cell FIO—remained absolute. Thus, using either 
relative or absolute cell references, it is easy to duplicate formulas without typing them.
More Knowledge | Calculate a Percentage if You Know the Total and the Amount
Using the equation amount/total = percentage, you can calculate the percentage by which a part makes up a total—with the percentage format­
ted as a decimal. For example, if on a test you score 42 points correctly out of 50, your percentage of correct answers is 42/50 - 0.84 or 84%.
Objective 10 | Edit Values in a Worksheet

Objective 14 | Use COUNTIF and IF Functions and
Apply Conditional Formatting
Recall that statistical functions analyze a group o f m easurem ents. A nother group 
of Excel functions, referred to as logical functions, test for specific conditions. Logical 
functions typically use conditional tests to determ ine w hether specified conditions—called 
criteria—are true or false.
Activity 8.30 
Using the COUNTIF Function
The COUNTIF function is a statistical function that counts the num ber of cells w ithin a range that meet the 
given condition—the criteria that you provide. The CO U N TIF function has two argum ents—the range of cells to 
check and the criteria. In this activity, you will use the CO U N TIF function to determ ine the num ber of seasoning 
products currently available in inventory.
1 
In the row heading area, point to row 9 and right-click to select the row and display the shortcut menu. Click 
Insert, and then press (J4j two tim es to repeat the last action and thus insert three blank rows.
IF4 I is useful to repeat commands in Microsoft Office programs. Most commands can be repeated in this manner.
2 
From the row heading area, select rows 9:11. On the Home tab, in the Editing group, click the Clear button 
and then click Clear Formats to rem ove the blue accent color in colum ns D and E from  the new rows.
When you insert rows or columns, formatting from adjacent rows or columns repeats in the new cells.
3 Click cell E4, look at the Formula Bar, and then notice that the argum ents of the SUM function ad justed and 
refer to the appropriate cells in rows 14:68.
Excel adjusts the cell references to A14.A68 after you insert the three new rows.
4  
In cell A10, type Seasoning Types: and then press (Tab).
5 
W ith cell BIO as the active cell, on the Formulas tab, in the Function Library group, click the More Functions 
button, and then display the list of Statistical functions. Click COUNTIF.
Recall that the COUNTIF function counts the number ot cells within a range that meet the given condition.
6 In the Range box, click the Collapse Dialog button fS^l. select the range G14:G68, and then at the right end of 
the collapsed dialog box, click the Expand Dialog button Ik3l. Click in the Criteria box, type Seasoning and 
then com pare your screen with Figure 8.61.

Activity 8.31 
Using the IF Function
A logical test is any value or expression that you can evaluate as being true or false. The IF Junction uses a 
logical test to check w hether a condition is m et, and then returns one value if true, and another value if false. For 
example, C14=228 is an expression that can be evaluated as true or false. If the value in cell C14 is equal to 228, 
the expression is true. If the value in cell C14 is not 228, the expression is false. In this activity, you will use the IF 
function to determ ine the inventory levels and determ ine if m ore products should be ordered.
1 
Click cell H I3, type Stock Level and then press (Biterl.
2  
In cell H 14, on the Formulas tab, in the Function Library group, click the Logical button, and then in the list, 
click IF. Drag the title bar of the Function Arguments dialog box up or dow n to view row 14 on your screen.
3 
W ith the insertion point in the Logical_test box, click cell AI4, and then type <125
This logical test will look at the value in cell A14, which is 228, and then determine if the number is less than 125. The 
expression <125 includes the < comparison operator, which means less than. Comparison operators compare values.

Activity 8.32 
Applying Conditional Formatting by Using Highlight 
Cells Rules and Data Bars
A conditional form at changes the appearance of a cell based on a condition—a criteria. If the condition is 
true, the cell is form atted based on that condition; if the condition is false, the cell is not form atted. In this activity, 
you will use conditional form atting as another way to draw  attention to the Stock Level o f products.

A data bar provides a visual cue to the reader about the value of a cell relative to other cclls. The length of the data 
bar represents the value in the cell. A longer bar represents a higher value and a shorter bar represents a lower value. 
Data bars are useful for identifying higher and lower numbers quickly within a large group of data, such as very high 
or very low levels of inventory.

Objective 19 | Enter Dates, Clear Contents, 
and Clear Formats
Dates represent a type o f value that you can enter in a cell. W hen you enter a date, 
Excel assigns a serial value—a num ber—to the date. This makes it possible to treat dates 
like other num bers. For example, if two cells contain dates, you can find the num ber of 
days between the two dates by subtracting the older date from the m ore recent date.
View the video on the 
Companion Web Site 
or in MylTLab
Activity 8.41 
Entering and Formatting Dates
In this activity, you will exam ine the various ways that Excel can form at dates in a cell. Date values entered in 
any of the following form ats will be recognized by Excel as a date:
Format
Example
m/d/yy
7/4/12
d-mmm
4-Jul
d-rmnm-yy
4-J ul-12
mmm-yy
Jul-12
O n your keyboard, (Z) (the hyphen key) and 0  (the forw ard slash key) function identically in any o f these 
form ats and can be used interchangeably. You can abbreviate the m onth nam e to three characters o r spell it out. 
You can enter the year as two digits, four digits, or even leave it off. W hen left off, the current year is assum ed but 
does not display in the cell.
A tw o-digit year value of 30 through 99 is interpreted by the W indow s operating system as the four-digit years 
of 1930 through 1999. All other tw o-digit year values are assum ed to be in the 2 1st century. If you always type year 
values as four digits, even though only two digits may display in the cell, you can be sure that Excel interprets the 
year value as you intended. Examples are show n in Figure 8.78.

4  At the bottom  o f the dialog box, click OK. Click cell A19, type 8-7-14 and then press [Enter).
Cell A 19 has no special date formatting applied, and thus displays in the default dale format 8/7/2014.
| T he D ate Does N ot D isplay as 8/7/2014?
Settings in your Windows operating system determine the default format for dates. If your result is different, it is likely that the formatting of 
the default date was adjusted on the computer at which you are working.
5  Click cell A19 again. H old dow n [Ctrij and press CD (sem icolon) on your keyboard. Press (Enter) to confirm  the 
entry.
Excel enters the current date, obtained from your computer’s internal calendar, in the selected cell using the default 
date format. I Ctrl I + [Tj is a quick method to enter the current date.
6  
Click cell A 19 again, type 8/7/14 and then press (Enter).
Because the year 14 is less than 30, Excel assumes a 21st century date and changes 14 to 2014 to complete the four­
digit year.
7 
Click cell A16, and then on the Home tab, in the Clipboard group, click the Format Painter button [ S\. Click 
cell A19, and notice that the date form at from  cell A16 is copied to cell A19. Save jJ j your w orkbook.
Activity 8.42 
Clearing Cell Contents and Formats
A cell has contents—a value or a form ula—and a cell may also have one or m ore formats applied, for exam ple, 
bold and italic font styles, fill color, font color, and so on. You can choose to clear—delete—the contents of a cell, 
the formatting of a cell, or both. Clearing the contents of a cell deletes the value or form ula typed there, but it 
does not clear form atting applied to a cell. In this activity, you will clear the contents of a cell and then clear the 
form atting o f a cell that contains a date to see its underlying content.
1 
In the Online Sales worksheet, click cell Al. In the Editing group, click the Clear button [^]. O n the displayed 
list, click Clear Contents and notice that the text is cleared, but the orange form atting rem ains.
2  Click cell A2, and then press iDeletel.
You can use either of these two methods to delete the contents ol a cell. Deleting the contents does not, however, 
delete the formatting of the cell; you can see that the orange fill color format applied to the two cells still displays.
3 
In cell A l, type Online Sales and then on the Formula Bar, click the Enter button 
so that cell A l rem ains the 
active cell.
In addition to the orange fill color, the bold italic text formatting remains with the cell.
4  
In the Editing group, click the Clear button Q , and then click Clear Formats.
Clearing the formats deletes formatting from the cell—the orange fill color and the hold and italic font styles—but 
does not delete the cell’s contents.
5  
Use the same technique to clear the orange lill color from  cell A2. Click cell A16, click the Clear button 0 ,  and 
then click Clear Formats. In the Number group, notice that General displays as the num ber form at of the cell.
I he box in the Number group indicates the current Number format of the selected cell. Clearing the date formatting 
from the cell displays the date’s serial number. T he date, August 3, 2014, is stored as a serial number that indicates 
the number of days since January 1, 1900. This date is the 41,854th day since the reference date of January 1, 1900.
On the Q uick Access Toolbar, click the Undo button @  to restore the date form at. Save HI your w orkbook, 
and then com pare your screen with Figure 8.80.

Objective 1 | Chart Data with a Pie Chart
A pie chart shows the relationship of each part to a whole. The size o f each pie slice is 
equal to its value com pared to the total value of all the slices. The pie chart displays data 
that is arranged in a single colum n or single row, and shows the size ot item s in a single 
data series proportional to the sum  of the items. C onsider using a pie chart when you 
have only one data series to plot, you do not have m ore than seven categories, and the 
categories represent parts o f a total value.

Select the range A5:A10, hold down I Ctrl |, and then select the range C5:C10 to select the nonadjacent ranges 
with the program  nam es and the projected expense for each program .
To create a pie chart, you must select two ranges. One range contains the labels for each slice of the pie chart, and the 
other range contains the values that add up to a total. The two ranges must have the same number of cells and the 
range with the values should not include the cell with the total. The program names (Police, Fire, and so on) are 
the category names and will identify the slices of the pie chart. Each projected expense is a data point—a value that 
originates in a worksheet cell and that is represented in a chart by a data marker. In a pie chart, each pie slice is a 
data marker. Fogether, the data points form the data series—related data points represented by data markers—and 
determine the size of each pie slice.
9 
W ith the nonadjacent ranges selected, click the Insert tab, and then in the Charts group, click Pie. U nder 3-D 
Pie, click the first chart— Pie in 3-D— to create the chart on your worksheet.
10 On the Design tab, at the right end o f the Ribbon in the Location group, click the Move Chart button. In the 
Move Chart dialog box, click the New sheet option button.
11 In the New sheet box, replace the highlighted text Chart 1 by typing Projected Expenses Chart and then click 
OK to display the chart on a separate worksheet in your workbook. C om pare your screen with Figure 9.5.
The pie chart displays on a separate new sheet in your workbook, and a legend identifies the pie slices. Recall that a 
legend is a chart element that identifies the patterns or colors assigned to the categories in the chart.
A chart sheet is a workbook sheet that contains only a chart; il is useful when you want to view a chart separately 
from the worksheet data. The sheet tab indicates Projected Expenses Chart.

The mathematical formula rate = am ount o f increase/base is used to calculated the percentage rate of population 
increase lrom 1970 to 1980. Ihe formula is applied as follows: First, determine the amount of increase by subtracting 
the base— the starting point represented by the 1970 population—from the 1980 population. Thus, the amount of 
increase = 118,072 -  115,241 or 2,831. Between 1970 and 1980, the population increased by 2,831 people. In the 
formula, this calculation is represented by C6-B6. Second, calculate the rate—what the amount of increase (2,831) 
represents as a percentage of the base (1970’s population of 115,241). Determine this by dividing the amount of 
increase (2,831) by the base (115,241). Thus, 2,831 divided by 115,241 is equal to 0.02456591 or, when formatted as a 
percent, 2 %.
10 In the Formula Bar, locate the parentheses enclosing C6-B6.
Kxcel follows a set of mathematical rules called the order o f operations, which has four basic parts:
• Expressions within parentheses are processed first.
• Exponentiation, if present, is performed before multiplication and division.
• Multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction.
• Consecutive operators with the same level of precedence are calculated from left to right.
11 Click cell D7, type = and then by typing, or using a com bination of typing and clicking cells to reference them, 
construct a form ula sim ilar to the one in cell C7 to calculate the rate of increase in population from  1980 to 
1990. Com pare your screen with Figure 9.25.
Recall that the first step is to determine the amount of increase—1990 population minus 1980 population—and then 
to write the calculation so that Excel performs this operation first; that is, place it in parentheses. The second step is 
to divide the result of the calculation in parentheses by the base— the population for 1980.

Because this formula uses relative cell references—that is, for each year, the formula is the same but the values used 
are relative to the formula’s location—you can copy the formula in this manner. For example, the result for 1990 
uses the 1980 population as the base, the result for 2000 uses the 1990 population as the base, and the result for 
2 0 10 uses the 2 0 0 0  population as the base. The formula results show the percent of increase for each 1 0 -year period 
between 1970 and 2010. You can see that in each 10-year period, the population has grown as much as 14%—from 
2000 to 2010—and as little as 2%—from 1970 to 1980.

More Knowledge | Use of Parentheses in a Form ula
When writing a formula in Excel, use parentheses to communicate the order in which the operations should occur. For example, to average 
three test scores of 100, 50, and 90 that you scored on three different tests, you would add the test scores and then divide by the number of 
test scores in the list. Ifyou write this formula as =100+50+90/3, the result would be ISO, because Excel would first divide 90 by 3 and then 
add 100+50+30. Excel would do so because the order of operations states that multiplication and division are calculated before addition and 
subtraction.
The correct way to write this formula is =(100+50+90)/3. Excel will add the three values, and then divide the result by 3, or 240/3 resulting 
in a correct average of 80. Parentheses play an important role in ensuring that you get the correct result in your formulas.

10 Without typing a com m a, in cell B14, type 152126 and then press [Enter].
The comma displays even though you did not type it. When you type a number and include a formatting symbol 
such as a comma or dollar sign, Excel applies the format to the cell. Thus, ifyou delete the contents of the cell and 
type in the cell again, the format you established remains applied to the cell. This is referred to as format as you type.

cell, but the num ber in cell B6 leaves a small am ount o f space on the right edge.
When you type commas as you enter numbers, Excel applies the Number format, which does not leave a space at the 
right of the number for a closing parenthesis in the event of a negative number. This is different from the format that 
is applied when you use the Comma Style button on the Ribbon or Mini toolbar, as you did for the numbers entered 
in row 6 . Recall that the Comma Style format applied from either the Ribbon or the Mini toolbar leaves space on the

Activity 9.14 
Calculating a Value After an Increase
A growing population results in increased use of city services. Thus, city planners in O range Blossom Beach 
m ust estimate how m uch the population will increase in the future. The calculations you m ade in the previous 
activity show that the population has increased at varying rates during each 10-year period from  1970 to 2 0 10, 
ranging from a low' of 2% to a high of 14% per 10-year census period.
Population data estim ates suggest that future grow th will trend close to that of the recent past. To plan for 
the future, Ms. Darius w ants to prepare three forecasts of the city’s population based on the percentage increases

in 2 0 0 0 , in 2 0 1 0 , and for a percentage increase halfway between the two; that is, for 8 %, 1 1 %, and 14%. In this 
activity, you will calculate the population that would result from  an 8 % increase.

Click cell C14. Type =b14*(100%+$b$11) and then on the Formula Bar, click the Enter 
b u tto n  to display a 
result o f 164296.08. Com pare your screen with Figure 9.28.
This formula calculates what the population will be in the year 2020 assuming an increase of 8 % over 2010’s 
population. Use the mathematical formula value after increase = base x percent for new value to calculate a value 
after an increase as follows:
First, establish the percent fo r new value. The percent fo r new value = base percent + percent o f increase. The
base percent of 1 0 0 % represents the base population and the percent o f increase in this instance is 8 %. Thus, the 
population will equal 1 0 0 % of the base year plus 8 % of the base year. This can be expressed as 108% or 1.08. In this 
formula, you will use 1 0 0 % + the rate in cell B1 1, which is 8 %, to equal 108%.
Second, enter a reference to the cell that contains the base— the population in 2010. The base value resides in cell 
B14— 152,126.
Third, calculate the value after increase. Because in each future 1 0 -year period the increase will be based on 8 %—an 
absolute value located in cell B1 1—this cell reference can be formatted as absolute by typing dollar signs.

This formula uses a relative cell address—B14—for the base-, the population in the previous 10-year period is used in 
each of the formulas in cells 1)14:F14 as the base value. Because the reference to the percent o f increase in cell B11 is 
an absolute reference, each value after increase is calculated with the value from cell B1 1. The population projected 
for 2020—164,296—is an increase of 8 % over the population in 2 0 1 0 . The projected population in 2030— 177,440— 
is an increase of 8 % over the population in 2 0 2 0  and so on.

More Knowledge | Percent Increase or D ecrease
The basic formula tor calculating an increase or decrease can be done in two parts. First, determine the percent by which the base value will 
be increased or decreased, and then add or subtract the results to the base. The formula can be simplified by using (1+amount of increase) or 
(1-amount o f decrease), where 1, rather than 100%, represents the whole. Thus, the formula used in Step I of Activity 9.14 could also be written 
=b!4*(l+$b$ll), or =(b!4*$b$l l)+b!4.

If a form ula depends on the value in a cell, you can see w hat effect it will have if you 
change the value in that cell. Then, you can copy the value com puted by the form ula and 
paste it into another part o f the worksheet where you can com pare it to other values.
Activity 9.15 
Answering What-lf Questions and Using Paste Special
A growth rate of 8 % in each 10-year period will result in a population o f alm ost 207,000 people by 2050. The 
city planners will likely ask: What if the population grows at the highest rate (14%)? What if the population grows 
at a rate that is halfway between the 2 0 0 0  and 2 0 1 0  rates ( 1 1 %)?
Because the formulas are constructed to use the growth rate displayed in cell B11, Ms. Darius can answer these 
questions quickly by entering different percentages into that cell. To keep the results of each set of calculations so 
they can be compared, you will paste the results of each what-if question into another area of the worksheet.

Activity 9.17 
Formatting Axes in a Line Chart
An axis is a line that serves as a frame of reference for measurement; it borders the chart plot area. The plot 
area is the area bounded by the axes, including all the data series. Recall that the area along the bottom of a chart 
that identifies the categories of data is referred to as the category axis or the x-axis. Recall also that the area along 
the left side of a chart that shows the range of numbers for the data points is referred to as the value axis or the 
y-axis. In this activity, you will change the category axis to include the names of the 10-year census periods and 
adjust the numeric scale of the value axis.
1 
Be sure the chart is still selected— a pale frame surrounds the chart area. Click the Design tab, and then in the 
Data group, click the Select Data button.
2  On the right side of the displayed Select Data Source dialog box, under Horizontal (Category) Axis Labels, 
locate the Edit button, as shown in Figure 9.37.

On the chart, notice that the blue line—the data series— does not display in the lower portion of the chart. 
Then, on the Layout tab, in the Axes group, click the Axes button. Point to Primary Vertical Axis, and then click 
More Primary Vertical Axis Options.
In the Format Axis dialog box, on the left, be sure Axis Options is selected. On the right, in the Minimum row, 
click the Fixed option button. In the box to the right, select the existing text 0.0, and then type 100000
Because none of the population figures are under 100,000, changing the Minimum number to 100,000 will enable 
the data series to occupy more of the plot area.
In the Major unit row, click the Fixed option button, select the text in the box to the right, and then type 
10000 In the lower right corner, click Close. Save 0  your workbook, and then compare your screen with 
Figure 9.40.
The Major unit value determines the spacing between tick marks and thus between the gridlines in the plot area. 
Tick marks are the short lines that display 011 an axis at regular intervals. By default, Excel started the values at zero 
and increased in increments of 20,000. By setting the Minimum value on the value axis to 100,000 and changing the 
Major unit from 20,000 to 10,000, the line chart shows a clearer trend in the population growth.

Activity 9.18 
Formatting the Chart and Plot Areas
An Excel chart has two background elements— the plot area and the chart area— which by default display 
a single fill color. To add visual appeal to a chart, you can insert a graphic image as the background. When 
formatting chart elements, there are several ways to display the dialog boxes that you need. You can right-click 
the area you want to format and choose a command on the shortcut menu. In this activity, you will use the Chart 
Elements box in the Current Selection group on the Format tab of the Ribbon, which is convenient if you are 
changing the format of a variety of chart elements.
1 
Click the Format tab, and then in the Current Selection group, point to the small arrow to the right of the first 
item in the group to display the ScreenTip Chart Elements. Compare your screen with Figure 9.41.
From the Chart Elements box, you can select a chart element so that you can format it.

8. Connect System Requirements and Software Versions (p. 479)
In This Chapter
As the Sales Operations Manager for a sporting goods com­
pany, some of your responsibilities include the supervision of 
sales performance and profitability objectives. This includes 
resolving technical problems; confirming that hardware and 
software is updated, licensed, and properly maintained; and 
anticipating technical and sales problems to take proactive 
measures. Additionally, you must use productivity applications 
to forward data and communicate with corporate headquarters, 
regional directors, and sales personnel.
In this chapter, you will review popular productivity pro­
grams, examine the capabilities of each program, and differ­
entiate between commercial, shareware, freeware, and public 
domain software. This knowledge will help you to determine the 
right application for all the tasks at your job and in your day-to- 
day life.

Objective 1 | Identify 
General Purpose 
Applications
As the Sales Operations Manager at a 
sporting goods company, you know that 
you will make use of word processing, 
spreadsheet, and database programs ev­
ery day. You also want to understand the 
purpose and use ol'other types of applica­
tions and determine if they can help you 
decrease repetitive tasks and quicken your 
response time to communications. Where 
do you start?
Concept 10.1 
Identifying 
General Purpose Applications
G en eral purpose ap p licatio n s are
programs you use to accomplish fre­
quently performed tasks. These tasks 
include writing documents, working 
with numbers, keeping track of informa­
tion, developing multimedia and graphic 
content, and using the Internet. These 
applications were once found only on 
home and business computers, but now 
they are on your mobile devices and 
media-specific technology such as iPods. 
Figure 10.1 lists types of general-purpose 
application software, including some 
applications that work through and run 
from the Internet.
Objective 2 | 
Differentiate Between 
Productivity Programs
As the Sales Operations Manager at a 
sporting goods company, you have just 
been assigned two assistants to help with 
the new sales promotion in the northeast 
and southwest regions. Both assistants 
are knowledgeable about computers and 
are adept with mobile devices. Both will 
travel extensively within their respective 
regions. To communicate with these as­
sistants when they are traveling, you want 
to use a shared calendar and programs 
that are accessible on portable devices.
To manage the new sales promotion, you 
want to use computer programs to allocate 
responsibility for tasks, to collaboratively 
edit promotional material, and to view and 
adjust milestones for this project. Where 
do you start?
• Word processing
• Spreadsheet
• Database
• Presentation
• Project management
• Personal information management
• Desktop publishing/Multimedia authoring
• Image and animation creation and editing
• 3-D rendering
• Audio editing
• Video editing
• E-mail
• Web browsers
• Internet messaging
• Video conferencing and IP telephony
• Web-hosted applications
• Spyware, adware, pop-ups
• Personal finance
• Tax preparation
• Home design and landscape design
• Computer-assisted tutorials
• Computer-assisted referencing—encyclopedias, maps
• Games
FIGURE 10.1 Application software can be categorized based on use.
The most popular general-purpose 
applications are p ro d u ctivity program s. 
which help you work more efficiently and 
effectively on both personal and business- 
related documents. Productivity software 
includes word processors, spreadsheets, 
databases, presentation, project manage­
ment, and personal information man­
agement programs (Figure 10.2). These 
programs are valuable regardless of the 
subject matter. For example, a word pro­
cessor is equally valuable for typing a 
term paper for your history class, writing 
a letter to a family member, or creating 
the agenda for an important meeting for 
you r job.
Learn to use the right application 
for the task. You could use Excel for a 
presentation, but it is much better 
to use PowerPoint as the presentation 
program and import Excel spreadsheets 
and charts into it. There are several 
companies that create programs for 
home and business productivity.
Objective 2: Differentiate Between Productivity Programs | GO ! All In One

FIGURE 10.2 Productivity 
programs include Microsoft 
Word for word processing, 
Microsoft Excel to create 
a spreadsheet, Microsoft 
Access to create and man­
age a database. Microsoft 
PowerPoint to develop pre­
sentations. Microsoft Project 
to oversee project progress, 
and Microsoft Outlook to 
manage your e-mail and 
calendar.
Figure 10.3 lists these applications by tvpo, 
along with some of the manufacturers, and 
is followed by a brief overview of Microsoft 
Office 2010, a group of productivity 
applications chosen most often by home and 
business users. Microsoft Office, according 
to Microsoft, is installed on over 1 billion 
computers worldwide.
Concept 10.2 Reviewing 
Microsoft Office 2010
The latest version of the popular application 
known simply as “Office” is Microsoft Office 
‘2010. Some of its new features include:
• The change of the Office Button to a 
tab on the Ribbon labeled “File”
• The ability to customize the 
Ribbon
• The option to capture and insert 
screen shots
• Enhanced multimedia editing in 
PowerPoint
• Stronger security settings that include 
“Restrict Editing” and “Block Author” 
modes, both added to enable or restrict 
users working on a collaborative project
These are just some of the upgrades in­
cluded in Office 2010 productivity pro­
grams. One feature that has not changed 
significantly is the shared office interface 
that most Office applications possess 
(Figure 10.4).

FIGURE 10.5 The new 
Team Planner Tools feature 
in Project 2010 displays 
tasks and resources— 
including people— in a 
view similar to an Outlook 
calendar.
Microsoft Word is a full-featured word 
processing program that, along with other 
Office applications, uses a common user in­
terface— the Ribbon. Word’s opening screen 
mimics a blank sheet of paper on which 
you create your document. Word is often 
the first application you learn, and using 
it at a basic level to create short letters, 
memos, and reports is an easy process.
Microsoft Excel, a popular business 
and personal spreadsheet program, also 
uses the common user interface—the 
Ribbon. A spreadsheet program records 
numeric data used it in calculations and 
performs m odeling—also referred to as 
w h at-if an alysis—to take current infor­
mation and use it to predict things that 
could happen in the future. Perhaps you 
have already used popular Excel features 
such as formulas, functions, charts, Pivot­
Tables, and PivotCharts.
Microsoft Access is a database man­
agement system (DBM S), a software 
application designed to store your data 
in tables, create relationships between 
tables, and then generate forms, queries, 
and reports to present your data in an 
informative and attractive manner. The 
power of Access is its ability to connect 
data in different tables and in different 
databases. This connectivity eliminates 
repeated searches in different locations, 
saves time, and enables you to generate a 
single report from multiple sources.
You might be familiar with Microsoft 
PowerPoint, a popular program among stu­
dents and individuals who need to create 
and deliver presentations. When you open 
PowerPoint, you will see the common user 
interface— the Ribbon—and a blank slide. 
The slide acts like a canvas on which you 
organize text boxes and graphics to pres­
ent your ideas. Be caref ul not to get caught 
up with all of the animation and transition 
effects offered by this application. The slide­
show is a backdrop and enhancement to your 
content; it should not be the main feature.
Microsoft Project is often a require­
ment in graduate management programs. 
It is a productivity program that has more 
utility for a business user than the home 
user. It provides an environment for the 
overall management of one or more proj­
ects that can vary in complexity. This pro­
gram offers such features as:
• A timeline that tracks due dates, mile­
stones, and deadlines
• A team-planning capability that, by 
simply dragging and dropping, creates 
a team with the right individuals and 
resources
• A portfolio manager that monitors the 
allocation of scarce resources and cur­
rent project costs
Project 2010 includes the Ribbon user in­
terface (Figure 10.5).

Microsoft Outlook manages your e-mail, 
your contacts, and your calendar. Recent 
features include conversation grouping 
and a “think before you send” warning that 
displays when you select the “Reply to All” 
option in an e-mail. A large majority of 
enterprises worldwide use and depend on 
Outlook for both internal and external com­
munication. With Microsoft’s acquisition of 
Skype, you can use Outlook for video confer­
encing. You will be surprised at how easy it 
is to let Outlook organize your life.
Objective 3 | Identify 
Media and Graphic 
Software
As the Sales Operations Manager for a 
sporting goods company, you must oversee 
all new sales campaigns. The latest prod­
ucts target the young adult market and 
the campaign is filled with multimedia 
advertisements and computer-enhanced 
images of the products. You need more 
information on graphic formats and the 
application programs required to edit and 
enhance images. Where do you start?
When discussing applications, m edia 
refers to the technology that encompasses 
pictures, sound, and video. Most media and 
graphic software applications are referred 
to as m ultim edia programs, because they 
enable you to incorporate more than one 
of these technologies. Do you think that 
graphics, sounds, animations, and video do 
a better job than simple text to engage you 
in a topic? These features, which once were 
considered entertainment or amusement, 
are now standard components of business, 
advertising, and educational programs 
(Figure 10.6).
Some multimedia applications offer 
interactivity by which you can choose your 
own path through the presentation. This 
creates different outcomes for each viewer, 
enabling the learner to view the possible 
outcomes of decisions and the associated 
consequences. Interactivity is a big factor 
in the popularity of the Web. In fact, the 
Web could be viewed as a gigantic interac­
tive multimedia presentation.
Concept 10.3 Clarifying 
Compression and 
Decompression
Your computer can work with art, photo­
graphs, videos, and sounds. When these 
multimedia resources are stored in digi­
tized liles on your computer, they require 
large amounts of storage space. To use the 
space on your hard disk efficiently and 
improve file transfer speeds over the Inter­
net, most multimedia software programs 
reduce file size by using codecs, the tech­
nical name for compression/decompression 
or code/decode algorithms.
Codecs use two different approaches to 
compression. By using lossless com pres­
sion, the original file is compressed so 
that it can be completely restored, without 
Haw, when it is decompressed. By us­
ing lossy com pression, the original file 
is processed so that some information is 
permanently removed from the file. Lossy 
compression techniques eliminate infor­
mation that is not perceived when you see 
pictures or hear sounds, such as very high 
musical notes that are outside of the fre­
quency range for most users. A hybrid of 
these two techniques is used in the area 
of medical imaging. For these images, a 
lossless compression scheme is needed 
in the region of interest while a lossy

compression scheme is suitable for 
image sections in nonregions of 
interest.
Why do we need codecs? W ith­
out the use of codecs, downloads 
would take three to five times lon­
ger than they do now because the 
files would be significantly larger. 
How many codecs are there? Un­
fortunately, there are hundreds 
of codecs; some are for audio and 
video compression, whereas others 
reduce the size of streaming media 
over the Internet. Ifyou download 
frequently, you probably use five 
to ten different codecs on a regular 
basis. Common codecs you might 
recognize include MP3, WMA, 
RealVideo, DivX, and XviD.
How do you know which codec 
decodes which files? Right-click the 
file and select Properties', in the 
Properties dialog box, the Details 
tab indicates the file type and thus 
the codec (Figure 10.7). If your 
system cannot open the file, record 
this code and then use a search 
engine to locate a download.
Concept 10.4 Designing 
with Desktop Publishing 
and Paint Programs
Programs in this category create 
newsletters, product catalogs, ad­
vertising brochures—documents 
that require unusual design and 
layout not normally provided by a 
word processor. From these 
types of programs, you can 
print or save documents in 
formats that you can send to a 
professional printer. Microsoft 
Publisher is an entry-level 
desktop publishing program 
that has the familiar interface 
of other Microsoft products.
Use paint programs 
to create bitm apped 
g rap h ics— also called raster 
g rap h ics—which are images 
composed of tiny squares or 
dots that correspond to one 
pixel. Recall that a pixel is 
the smallest addressable ele­
ment of a display device. The 
Windows operating system 
includes the Paint program 
that you can use to create this 
type of graphic (Figure 10.8).
466 
GO! All In One | Chapter 10: Using Application Software as Productivity Tools

F IG U R E  10.9 This 
enlargement is an 
illustration of pixels.
Paint is great for beginners and provides a 
tool panel with features that allow an im­
age to be cropped, colors altered, and areas 
erased. If you are looking for more advanced 
features, you can purchase a professional 
paint program to create a wider scope of ef­
fects through a more enhanced tool panel.
Editing a pixel-based image requires 
you make a selection before applying an 
edit or change. This action is similar to 
selecting text in a Word document and 
then applying bold formatting; however, 
selecting a graphic or a portion of a graphic 
is not as straightforward as making a 
selection in a Word document. Enhanced 
graphic programs have tools to ease this se­
lection process. When editing an image, you 
need to zoom in at a high viewing level as 
seen in Figure 10.9. Then the pixels become 
more apparent and appeal- to have the Jag- 
g ie s , a jagged edge between contrasting 
colors. When you resize a bitmapped or ras­
ter image, the computer must calculate or 
“guess”—either where to add pixels when 
enlarging the image size— or where to 
throw away pixels when shrinking the size 
of an image. Thus, the image can lose clar­
ity because it is losing image information as 
the computer makes its best “guess” based 
on surrounding pixel information.
Is it possible to convert an image from 
one graphic format to another? Yes, it is 
possible, in some graphic applications, to
convert a graphic in one format to another 
format through the Save As command. 
Figure 10.10 provides a list of the stan­
dard formats in which the Paint programs 
can save your work.
Use im age editors—sophisticated 
versions of graphic programs— to edit and 
create images and save them in a variety 
of file formats. Free programs like Picasa 
and G IM P, designed for personal and 
home use, incorporate automated image- 
processing algorithms to add a variety of 
special effects, remove blemishes, crop por­
tions, and adjust coloring to photographic 
images. Programs like Adobe Photoshop, 
which include the capability of paint soft­
ware and image editors, in the past were 
used primarily by professionals. But the 
popularity of photo editing has forced com­
panies to create simpler interfaces such as 
Adobe’s Photoshop Elements that enable 
you to create a professional finished photo 
or image without the cost and learning 
curve of complex software (Figure 10.11).
Concept 10.5 Using Graphic 
Programs
Vector graphic programs that create vec­
tor g rap h ics are math based. If you 
remember your high school days of math, 
a line segment was defined as having at 
least two points. Therefore, the rules for

drawing in a vector program require that 
you define the points to draw line seg­
ments which are known as paths. The 
graphic program stores the paths as math­
ematical equations. When you enlarge 
or shrink a vector graphic, the program 
needs only to recalculate the math for the 
line segments or paths you created. Thus, 
clarity is perfectly maintained regardless 
of resized dimensions. For this reason, 
illustrations such as clip art and logos 
are often designed in vector programs 
(Figure 10.12).
Professional drawing programs such 
as CorelDRAW Graphics Suite and Adobe 
Illustrator save files by outputting instruc­
tions in Po stScrip t, which is an auto­
mated page-description language (PDL). 
Page description languages describe image 
elements as geometric objects such as lines 
and arcs and consist of commands given by 
the program and carried out by the printer 
to precisely re-create the computer image 
on a printed page. PostScript is the printing 
and image standard used by corporations 
and publishers.

practice to become 
proficient. Figure 
10.15 lists some cur­
rent applications for 
drawing, image edit­
ing, and photo editing.
FIGURE 10.13 Ray tracing is a technique that uses color and color intensity 
to create the illusion of light and makes drawn images appear more realistic.
FIGURE 10.14 CAD diagrams 
vary in complexity and purpose but 
provide detail and depth that other 
drawing programs lack.
Concept 10.6 Simplifying 
Three-Dimensional Rendering 
Programs
A 3-D rendering program adds three- 
dimensional effects to graphic objects. The 
results are strikingly realistic. Objects can 
be rotated in any direction to achieve the 
exact result the artist is looking for.
Rendering software no longer requires 
a high-powered engineering worksta­
tion; high-end desktop computers are 
suitable. One rendering technique, ray 
tra c in g , adds amazing realism to a 
simulated three-dimensional object by 
manipulating variations in color intensity 
that would be produced by light falling 
on the object from multiple directions, 
which is the norm in the real world (Fig­
ure 10.13). Detailed steps to create night 
lighting using ray tracing can be found

Computer-Aided Design (CAD) 
Programs
Programs in this category create sophis­
ticated 3-D rendering images frequently 
used by engineers to design entire struc­
tures and by scientists to display cell 
structure. These computer-generated dia­
grams (Figure 10.14) can range from some­
thing as simple as the design of a new nut 
or bolt to the design of a bridge, security 
system, shopping complex, or visual rep­
resentation of DNA molecules. These are 
more complicated drawing programs and

ation as well as animation.
Professional animation programs like 
Adobe Plash provide sophisticated tools 
for creating animations (Figure 10.16). The 
main restricting feature of this program 
is that it creates a p ro p rietary file , a file 
whose format is patented or copyright pro­
tected and controlled by a single company. 
To view these files on the Web, you need a 
special free plug-in program, a program 
downloaded from a Web site that extends 
the ability of your Web browser usually to 
enable multimedia features. Shockwave 
Player and Flash Player from Adobe and 
Silver light from Microsoft are examples of 
common plug-ins.
Concept 10.9 Using Audio 
Editing Software
A variety of programs are available for 
capturing and processing sound for multi- 
media presentations, including sound mix­
ers, compression software, bass enhancers, 
synthesized stereo, and even onscreen mu­
sic composition programs. Most programs 
include options to create unique music 
mixes, record podcasts, convert between 
file formats, filter out background noise 
and static, and edit content through cut, 
copy, and paste features. Recent reviews at

Sound files contain digitized data in 
the form of recorded live sounds or music,
which are saved in one of several standard­
ized sound formats. These formats, dis­
played in Figure 10.17, specify how sounds 
should be digitally represented and gener­
ally include some type of data compression.
There are over a dozen formats for 
stream ing audio, accessing sounds that 
play almost immediately after you click an 
audio link on a Web page, without wait­
ing for the entire file to download. Popular 
formats include RealNetworks' RealAudio, 
streaming MP3, Macromedia’s Flash, Di­
rector Shockwave. Microsoft’s Windows 
Media, and Apple’s QuickTime. More re­
cent streaming audio formats synchronize 
sounds with events on a Web page, such as 
RealMedia G2 with S M IL  and Beatnik’s 
Rich Music Format (RM F). To hear some

Description
MP3
A patented audio sound lile format that uses lossy compression and enables you to compress 
CD-quality digital audio by a ratio of 12:1.
Windows Media 
Audio (WMA)
A Microsoft proprietary data compression tile format, similar to the MP3 format, that produces 
files smaller in size, requires less processing power, but generates the same audio quality. WMA is 
one of the most popular audio tile formats.
WAV
The default Microsoft Windows sound lile format uses the .wav extension (short for “Wave 
Sounds”). It can be saved with a variety of quality levels, from low-fidelity mono to CD-quality 
stereo. WAV sounds usually are not compressed, so they tend to take up a lot of disk space.
Ogg Vorbis
An open source, patent-free, professional audio encoding format similar to MP3 but about 20 
percent smaller.
Musical Instrument 
Digital Interface 
(MIDI)
A language that enables the creation of an electronic instrument sound out of an acoustical 
instrument. MIDI tiles, generally small in size, contain a text-based description that tells a 
synthesizer when and how to play individual musical notes. MIDI sound samples of an instrument 
can be added to a MIDI song file, allowing overlapping and stacking of instrument sounds.

Elements, and Creator. Video editors also 
enable you to save video files to some or all 
of the following video file formats:
• Moving Picture Experts Group 
(M PEG ): A family of video file formats 
and lossy compression standards for 
full- motion video.
• QuickTime: A video file format de­
veloped by Apple Computer. If plays 
full-screen, broadcast-quality video as 
well as CD- and DVD-quality audio. It 
is widely used in multimedia CD-ROM 
productions.
• Video for Window: The original video 
lile format for Microsoft Windows, 
Video for Windows is often called AVI 
(Audio Video Interleave). This format 
is still widely used but is inferior to 
the new MPEG-4 standard.
Because a huge amount of data must be 
stored to create realistic-looking video 
on a computer, all video file formats use 
codec techniques. For the best playback, 
your computer should have a special video 
ad ap te r, an expansion board that pro­
vides display capabilities. These adapters 
have hardware that decodes videos at 
high speed.
Stream in g video, accessing video clips 
almost immediately after you click a video 
link on a Web page, without waiting for the 
entire file to download, is made possible 
by streaming video formats. These formats 
rely on compression, low frame rates, and 
small image size to deliver your video over 
the Internet, which does not have sufficient
bandwidth—signal-carrying capacity—to 
disseminate broadcast-quality video. A 
popular streaming video site is YouTube.
Concept 10.11 
Using 
Multimedia Authoring Systems
Use authoring tools to create multimedia 
presentations. These tools enable you to 
specify which multimedia objects to use, 
how to display them in relation to each 
other, how long to display them, and how 
to enable the end user to interact with the 
presentation (Figure 10.18). To take full 
advantage of an authoring tool’s capabili­
ties, you might have to learn a scripting 
language— a simple programming lan­
guage. Leading authoring packages for 
home or educational purposes include 
iMovie by Apple and Windows Live Movie 
Maker; at the professional level, Adobe 
Director is state of the art.
Many commercial authoring tools, 
such as Adobe Director, save output in 
proprietary file formats. To view Adobe 
presentations on a Web site, you must 
download and install a plug-in. The World 
Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the organi­
zation that sets Web standards, recently 
approved a simple multimedia scripting 
language called Synchronized M ultim e­
d ia In teg ratio n  Language (S M IL ).
This language displays Web pages in 
a standard manner without the use of 
plug-ins. Although the idea is a good one,

Concept 10.12 Reviewing Web 
Page Authoring Programs
The Adobe Creative Suite media develop­
ment kit is a combination of programs that 
create multimedia Internet applications. 
Productivity programs like Word and 
Excel have options to save your work as a 
Web page, and this works fine for a begin­
ner. Adobe Creative Suite has three core 
programs with advanced capabilities for 
Web page development:
• Dreamweaver: An environment in 
which you develop Web pages visually 
or directly in code and provide the con­
nectivity to other languages used in 
Web interactivity and design.
• Flash: A platform to create animation 
and interactivity that can be added to 
Web pages.
• Fireworks: A program that provides 
an interface that enables the creation 
of highly optimized graphics that can 
be embedded within Web pages and 
portable devices.
If you are a Mac user, visit w w w . 
apple.com /ilife to learn about Apple’s 
multimedia iLife suite, with which you 
can create music with GarageBand; in­
tegrate and organize your music, photos, 
and home videos with iTunes, iPhoto, and 
iMovie; and share your creations over the 
Internet on a Web site created with iWeb.
Programs of this type are frequently 
updated and new ones are always entering 
the market. The lines between many are 
blurred because video editors can now edit
sound and sound editors can edit video. 
Figure 10.19 provides a list of some of the 
products available in this advanced media 
authoring and editing group.

Recognize 
Applications That 
Run from the 
Internet
As the Sales Operations Manager for a 
sporting goods company, you are excited 
that the sales resulting from your promo­
tional event exceeded corporate projec­
tions. You have been assigned two new 
assistants to help you expand the promo­
tion. You and your new assistants must 
be in contact throughout the day and you 
must all be able to share and update docu­
ments and data. You want to be able to 
do this by using Web-based applications. 
Where do you start?
There are many types of Internet 
applications. Some work through the In­
ternet, using it as the transport medium. 
Others actually run from the Internet, us­
ing programs that reside there.
Concept 10.13 Relying on 
Web-Based Applications
Many applications are Web based; that is, 
they are accessed over a network like the 
Internet. Examples include e-mail clients

As the Sales Operations Manager for a 
sporting goods company, you and your 
team have just ended a meeting about mar­
keting strategies for the new line of young 
adult, ecofriendly products. Your assistants 
support a viral marketing campaign that 
includes street teams in the major targeted 
cities. The street teams will be selected 
from Facebook subscribers who like your 
company’s Facebook page. Each team will 
have a leader who will receive communica­
tion and guidance from a promotional staff 
member through either a popular home 
or educational program or a social media 
site. The idea of using a Web-based game 
centered on the street team’s location and 
activities was suggested as a means of
getting consumers involved in promoting 
the products. Where do you start?
General-purpose software also in­
cludes home an d  ed u catio n al pro­

useful for less complex or more personal 
activities like personal finance and tax

street maps (Figure 10.21), computer-

Concept 10.15 Interacting 
through Computer Games
Computer games are a large and growing 
business. The worldwide video game in­
dustry predicts a continuation of the video 
game boom, with total sales growing to 
$68.4 billion by 2012. This highly profit­
able industry got its start in the 1970s, 
when the earliest computer video games 
appeared in lounges and gaming arcades. 
Then video games entered the living room 
with the advent of Atari, Nintendo, and 
Sega console game players, which are 
special-purpose computers designed to dis­
play their output on a TV screen. Games 
soon migrated to personal computers—and 
from there, to the Internet.

D oes th e video gaming industry have an 
ethical obligation to produce gam es that 
have less violent and add ictive co n te n t? 
Gam ing has becom e a method of entertain­
m ent, with at least half of the individuals 
that you m eet having tried to play one at 
least once. But is it really entertainm ent? 
En tertainm en t is an act that should relax 
people and take their mind off their trou­
bles. Serious gam ers, the ones that play 
for hours, do not seem to be getting en ­
tertainm ent in the traditional sense of the 
word. W atching some "gam ers" as they are 
called, you might see signs of frustration 
and irritation.
O fte n  th e  gam es have activities that

thousands of game players located anywhere 
in the world simultaneously in a virtual 
world that continues to exist even after 
the player has signed off. In these games, 
the graphical images are controlled by 
other players rather than by a computer. 
Combining a rich 3-D graphical virtual en­
vironment with multiplayer thrills, these 
types of games are attracting increasing 
numbers of users. M a s s iv e ly  m u l t i p l a y e r  
o n l i n e  r o l e - p l a y i n g  g a m e s  (M M O R P G s )  
are an extension of multiplayer online 
gaming in which the participants assume 
the characteristics of a predesigned char­
acter or a self-designed character and play 
the game as that character. These virtual 
worlds are often hosted on servers main­
tained by the software publisher. You can 
access some of these games directly online 
without any special equipment other than 
a Web browser, whereas others require a 
locally installed game package to speed 
up processing. An interesting positive ele­
ment of M M ORPGs is that they encourage 
the player to progress to higher levels, 
promote team building, and frequently 
necessitate seeking other players whose 
skills and abilities complement those of 
your character to attain a strategic ad­
vantage. Examples of such games include 
EverQuest and World ofW arCraft.
Objective 6 | 
Differentiate Between 
Application Types
As the Sales Operations Manager for a 
sporting goods company, the idea of incor­
porating a game into the next sales promo­
tion with the street team and perhaps some 
use of G PS monitoring seems feasible. You 
schedule a meeting with your team to de­
termine if any marketing promotions have 
tried this type of activity. If so, you want to 
know who developed the game, did it come 
packed with other computer-based activi­
ties relative to the promotion, and was the 
campaign successful? Where do you start?
Concept 10.16 Separating 
Custom from Packaged 
Software
C u s t o m  s o f t w a r e  is written for special­
ized fields or businesses and is tailor- 
made to suit their exact needs. Custom 
applications can be created by an in-house 
software development team or commissioned
to an external developer. Either way, the 
cost of a custom program is much higher 
than general-purpose, off-the-shelf applica­
tions. Examples of areas that make use of 
custom software include military projects, 
billing needs of medical offices, restaurant 
management systems, and occupational 
injury tracking software.
On your own computer, you probably 
use p a c k a g e d  s o f t w a r e , which is soft­
ware purchased off the shelf that is aimed 
at fulfilling the needs of the general public 
including the basic home and business 
user. Although packaged software provides 
settings to customize certain features, it 
is immediately useful in a wide variety 
of contexts. Packaged software is much 
cheaper than custom software.
In addition to the choices of custom or 
packaged software, you have three other 
options when purchasing software: stand­
alone programs, integrated programs, and 
software suites.
Concept 10.17 Evaluating 
Standalone Programs, 
Integrated Programs, and 
Software Suites
A s t a n d a l o n e  p r o g r a m  is a program 
that does not require any software other 
than the operating system to run. Many 
software programs like Word and Excel 
can be considered standalone programs.
A plug-in, which will not run unless an­
other program is already installed, is not 
a standalone program.
An i n t e g r a t e d  p r o g r a m  is a single 
program that manages an entire business 
or set of related tasks. It combines the 
most commonly used functions of many 
productivity software programs, like word 
processing, database management, spread­
sheet, accounting, and customer service, 
into one single application. Integrated 
programs, such as Microsoft Works, offer 
easy-to-learn and easy-to-use versions of 
basic productivity software. The functions 
offered by an integrated program, called 
m o d u l e s , share the same interface, enable 
you to switch among them quickly, and 
are not available as standalone programs 
(Figure 10.23). A complaint about these in­
tegrated modules is that they lack features 
that provide advanced capabilities.
A s o f t w a r e  s u i t e , sometimes called an 
o ffic e  s u i t e , is a collection of individual, 
full-featured, standalone programs possess­
ing a similar interface and a common com­
mand structure, which are bundled and sold

investigate the license and registration 
agreements necessary to deploy the 
software. Where do you start?
Concept 10.18 Reviewing 
Licenses and Registration
A s o f t w a r e  l i c e n s e  is a contract dis­
tributed with a program that typically 
gives you the right to install and use the 
program on one computer (Figure 10.24). 
Typically, to install a program on more 
than one computer, you must purchase 
additional licenses. However, some pro­
grams allow home users to install soft­
ware on one or two additional computers. 
Always read the license to be sure.
Organizations such as colleges and 
universities often purchase s i t e  lic e n s e s . 
a contract between the software publisher 
and the organization that enables the or­
ganization to install copies of a program 
on a specified number of computers. Site 
licenses offer large organizations multiple 
software licenses at a slightly reduced cost.
You usually have to v a l i d a t e  your 
software—verify that it is a legal copy by 
providing a special code or product key be­
fore you can use it. You may also be asked to 
register your software. Doing so may provide 
you with product news, upgrade notices, and 
qualify you for technical assistance.
Concept 10.19 Commercial 
Software, Shareware, Freeware, 
and Public Domain Software
P u b li c  d o m a i n  s o f t w a r e  is software that 
is expressly free from copyright. You can do 
anything you want with it, including mod­
ify it or sell it to others.
C o p y - p r o te c te d  s o f t w a r e  
programs include some 
mechanism to ensure that 
you do not make or run 
unauthorized copies. There 
are three types of copy­
protected software:
• C o m m e r c ia l s o ftw a r e ,
which must be purchased. 
The current trend is to 
make those programs 
available as an online 
download or initially as 
shareware, to give the 
potential customer a trial 
period. After the trial 
period is over, you can 
pay for the program di­
rectly on the Web site and 
download an official copy.

GO! All In One | Chapter 10: Using Application Software as Productivity Tools

• S h a r e w a r e , which is more of a market­
ing method than a type of software. You 
are permitted to have a set period of 
time in which to “try before buying” the 
program (Figure 10.25). If you like the 
program after using it for a specified trial 
period, you must pay a registration fee.
• F r e e w a r e , which is given away for no

you cannot sell it for profit.

System Requirements 
and Software Versions
As the Sales Operations Manager for a 
sporting goods company and the individual 
directly responsible for the viral market­
ing campaign, the Information Technology 
Department has asked you to set the mini­
mum system requirements that the street 
team game in development should require. 
You need to do some research before you 
reply. Where do you start?
When you buy software, your computer 
system must meet the program’s s y s te m  
r e q u i r e m e n t s —the minimal level of equip­
ment that a program needs in order to run. 
Foi- example, a program may be designed to 
run on a PC with an Intel Core i3 processor, 
a CD or DVD drive, at least 1 G B of RAM, 
and 50 G B of free hard disk space. Ifyou 
are shopping for software, you will find the
S o ftw a r e G o in g  G reen
A recent survey by PricewaterhouseCoo- 
pers revealed that 60 percent of technol­
ogy manufacturers are developing green 
products and services, using recycled or 
recyclable materials, and creating packag­
ing that meets or exceeds global environ­
mental standards. For example, Microsoft 
has eliminated the use of PVC in their pack­
aging, and M cAfee encourages users to 
download their software, thereby eliminat­
ing the need for packaging. Do you want 
to do your part? If you have old copies of 
software on CD, stacks of obsolete floppy 
disks, or other unwanted computer acces­
sories, GreenDisk at www.greendisk.com 
will safely and responsibly dispose of them 
for you for a small fee.
system requirements printed somewhere on 
the outside of the box or online through a 
link that is usually called “system require­
ments.” It is usually better if your system 
exceeds these requirements, especially 
when it comes to memory and disk space.
You have probably noticed that most 
program names include a number, such 
as 6.0, or a year, such as 2010. Software 
publishers often introduce new versions of 
their programs, and these numbers help 
you determine whether you have the latest 
version. In a version number, the whole 
number, such as 6 in 6.0, indicates a major 
program revision. A decimal number indi­
cates a m a i n t e n a n c e  r e l e a s e — a minor 
revision that corrects bugs or adds minor 
features. The year 2010 would indicate the 
year the software was published.
B e t a  v e r s i o n s  of forthcoming pro­
grams are versions in the final phases of 
testing, and are sometimes available for 
free. Beta users are usually sophisticated 
users that try out these preliminary ver­
sions and tell the publisher about any ma­
jor issues so they can be fixed before the 
applications are officially released.
Concept 10.20 Installing 
Software Upgrades
S o f t w a r e  u p g r a d i n g  describes the pro­
cess of keeping your version of an applica­
tion current with the marketplace. Some 
upgrades are small changes called patches; 
sometimes they are major fixes called ser­
vice releases or service packs. Microsoft 
software has a built-in capability to auto­
matically check with Microsoft’s Web site to 
determine whether updates are available.
Concept 10.21 
Distribution 
and Documentation
Before high-speed Internet connections 
became commonplace, most software was 
available only in shrink-wrapped packages 
that included floppy disks or CD-ROMs 
containing the program installation files. 
Using high-speed Internet connections to 
distribute software is cheaper for the com­
pany and often more convenient for you.
Most software provides some type of 
d o c u m e n ta tio n , a collection of printed or 
online material that provides instructions and 
brief tutorials. Many programs also have Help 
screens that enable you to consult all or pail of 
the documentation on your computer screen.

Chapter Summary
Using Application Software as 
Productivity Tools
• General-purpose applications are useful to accom­
plish frequently performed tasks.
• Productivity programs are general-purpose ap­
plications that help you work more efficiently and 
effectively on both personal and business-related 
documents.
• Media refers to technology that presents information. 
This technology encompasses pictures, sound, and 
video. Most media and graphic software are referred 
to as multimedia programs because they enable you 
to incorporate more than one of these technologies.
• Most multimedia software programs reduce file 
size by using codecs, the technical name for com­
pression/decompression or code/decode algorithms. 
Two common codes are lossy and lossless.
• Applications that run from the Internet reside 
on a remote server and are accessed through the 
Internet. This technology makes file sharing and 
collaboration easier. Examples include Windows 
Office Live and Google Docs.
Home and educational programs are used for less 
complex or more personal activities like personal 
finance and tax preparation software, home design 
and landscaping software, computerized reference 
information, and games.
Custom software is tailor-made for specialized 
fields or businesses, while packaged software is 
purchased oft'the shelf and fulfills the needs of the 
general public.
Types of applications include standalone programs, 
integrated programs, and software suites.
Software must be licensed, validated, and usually 
registered.
Publishers introduce new or updated versions of 
their software periodically. In a version number, 
the whole number, such as 6 in 6.0, indicates a ma­
jor program revision. A decimal number indicates 
a maintenance release.
Software that is public domain software—free 
from copyright or copy protection—contains some 
mechanism to ensure that you do not make or run 
unauthorized copies.

Teamwork
1. A p p lic a tio n s for a W eb D ev elo p er As a team, 
consult the college catalog and interview faculty 
in the computer and graphic art departments of 
your college to create a list of courses and applica­
tions that a student interested in developing Weh 
pages or becoming a Web developer should take. 
Use a Word table to list the courses, the prerequi­
sites, the software for the course, and the number 
of credit hours. Then, consult local job listings and 
list at least five jobs in Web development, the name 
of the employer, and the required skills. Do you 
think your college’s offerings match up with the job 
requirements? Present your findings at the bottom 
of the Word table.
2. U se a P h o to  E d itor Download the current ver­
sion of Google’s Picasa photo editor. Then, use a 
digital camera to take a series of photos or use a 
team member’s photos and experiment with some 
of Picasa’s photo editing features. After making a 
change to a photo, save it with a new name so that
the original is unaltered so that you can compare 
the before and after versions. Select at least five 
photos and record the changes made to each photo, 
the Picasa feature you used, the level of difficulty 
your team assigned to the use of that feature, and 
what your team thought of the finished image. At­
tempt to make at least one collage, and learn how 
to create an album. Insert before and after pictures, 
a summary of the features you used, and their level 
of difficulty in a PowerPoint slide show. Conclude 
the show with the features your team thought pro­
duced the best results.
3. It T a k e s M ore T h an  th e  A p p lic a tio n  As a
team, research the qualities of a good business pre­
sentation. From the ones located, select eight that 
the team believes would have the greatest effect on 
the overall quality of a business presentation. Use 
your findings to create, as a team, a high-quality 
PowerPoint presentation demonstrating your eight 
features. Remember to cite your references.
On the Web
1. A  Look B ack in Tim e It is easy to take for granted 
the programs that we use today and complain 
about all of the features that they lack. Visit http:// 
r o y a l, p in g d o m . co m /2 0 0 9 /0 6 /1 7 /first-v ersio n - 
of-todays-m ost-p op u lar-ap p lication s-a-visu al- 
tour/, and review the 1.0 version of today’s popular 
programs. From this site, select five programs 
with which you are familiar, and then in a table or 
spreadsheet, list each program and the features of 
each that are still in use today. In the same table 
list the features that have changed or been added 
to make the programs suitable for today’s users. Fi­
nally, make a wish list of the features that you would 
like to see each application include in future ver­
sions. Explain how your suggested features would 
improve the overall objective of the application. Ap­
propriately title your report, and submit your table 
or spreadsheet with your insights and assessments.
2. G am in g P o p u la rity  Using your favorite search 
engine, locate references that contain statistics 
on gaming. Present your findings in a one-page, 
double-spaced report. Remember to cite your refer­
ences. Attempt to locate such information as:
• The average hours a week a gamer spends 
playing video games
• The number of female versus male 
gamers
• The percent of U.S. households that play 
video games
• The average age of a gamer
• Some of the benefits of gaming
• Some of the problems associated with 
gaming
3. F ree P erso n a l In form ation  M a n agers Do you
want some free or inexpensive software? The Inter­
net is frequently used to distribute shareware and 
freeware applications. Go to w w w .y ah oo.com  and 
type freeware in the Search box at the top of the 
window. Browse some of the more than 242 million 
sites returned by your search. Perform a more lim­
ited search to zero in on free personal information 
management programs. Download two programs. 
Use both and critically compare their interfaces, e- 
mail, contacts, and calendars. Include the product 
names, the U RLs from which you downloaded the 
product, the file size, comparisons of the interfaces, 
and your assessment of functionality in a one-page, 
double-spaced summary report.

Ethics and Social Media
1. Sh arew are Have you ever downloaded shareware 
software or the beta of a program and after the free 
preview period realized that it still worked; so you 
continued to use it? In both cases, you probably had 
to agree to some type of usage statement limiting 
the time you can use the program to the specified 
free period. By continuing to use the program, you 
are violating this agreement. Using your favorite 
search engine, find three actions software compa­
nies are taking to reduce this violation of share­
ware agreements. Include your ethical stand on 
the continued use of a shareware program that has 
expired and an explanation of the three steps you 
located that are being taken by software companies 
to deter this behavior in a one-page, double-spaced 
summary report.
2. V iral M a rk etin g  The use of viral marketing as 
a multimedia and interactive method of promot­
ing products has become popular. Both its suc­
cesses and failures have been documented. First, 
locate a valid definition for viral marketing. Then, 
using a search engine, locate three viral market­
ing attempts that were successful and three that 
were not successful. In a slide show of five or more 
slides, indicate the year of each event and how suc­
cess or failure was determined. Conclude your slide 
show with your views on this type of multimedia 
advertising.

Activity 11.02 
Entering Presentation Text and Saving a Presentation
On startup, PowerPoint displays a new blank presentation with a single slide— a title slide in Normal view.
A presentation slide—similar to a page in a document— can contain text, pictures, tables, charts, and other 
multimedia or graphic objects. The title slide is the first slide in a presentation and provides an introduction to the 
presentation topic.

Activity 11.05 
Increasing and Decreasing List Levels

a larger text size.

Objective 13 | Remove Picture Backgrounds and 
Insert WordArt
To avoid the boxy look that results when you insert an image into a presentation, use 
Background Removal to (low a picture into the content of the presentation. Background 
Removal removes unwanted portions of a picture so that the picture does not appear as a 
self-contained rectangle.
WordArt is a gallery of text styles with which you can create decorative effects, such as shadowed or mirrored 
text. You can choose from the gallery of WordArt styles to insert a new W ordArt object or you can customize 
existing text by applying W ordA rt formatting.

Objective 1 
Understand the 
Internet
As a Library Assistant at a college, you 
frequently conduct a presentation entitled 
Introduction to the Library, which is re­
quired for all new students. You want the 
Internet portion of your presentation to 
include an overview of the Internet’s archi­
tecture. You also want to emphasize how 
easy it is to access the Internet regardless 
of computer type or computer operating 
system. Where do you start?
The Internet, also called the Net. is 
a global computer network made up of 
thousands of privately and publicly owned 
computers and networks that grew and 
interlinked, over time, into one giant net­
work. In short, the Internet is a network of 
networks.
The idea of connecting computers of 
different designs and over distant loca­
tions started in the 1960s with the U.S. 
Department of Defense and a project called 
A R PA N ET, which stands for Advanced Re­
search Projects Agency Network. The pur­
pose of the project was to create a form of 
secure communication for military and sci­
entific purposes and to create a method for 
transferring such communications between 
computers. The outcome of the project was 
a network that consisted of four computers 
located at the University of California at 
Los Angeles, the University of California 
at Santa Barbara, the University of Utah, 
and Stanford Research Institute. In turn, 
each of these four computers— referred to 
as nodes— connected hundreds of other 
computers to the net­
work. What you know 
as the Internet is 
the offspring of the 
A R PA N ET  project.
To learn more about 
the history of 
the Internet, go 
to w w w .iso c.

shtm l.
The Inter­
net is composed 
of more than
750 million 
™
hosts. A host 
is a computer 
that can receive
requests and reply to those requests. These 
hosts are interconnected and geographi­
cally spread out over the world. Figure 12.1 
provides a simplified image of a single 
network that is set up to provide its users 
with access to the Internet and any of the 
Internet’s hosts. A study done by the Inter­
net Systems Consortium substantiates the 
rapid growth of the Internet by citing an 
increase of over 208 million hosts between 
2008 and 2010.
The Internet began as a commu­
nication and file exchange network for 
government agencies, scientific research 
groups, and academic institutions.
Now the Internet has grown into a 
tool for everyone to discover and explore 
information, buy and sell products, 
take classes, and socialize with friends. 
As a global leader in measuring the 
digital world, comScore, Inc. indicates 
from its surveys that the global Internet 
audience— defined as users ages 15 and 
older— exceeded 2 billion unique visitors 
as of March 2011. This includes the use 
of both home and work computers. The 
leap to 3 billion users is expected to 
come quickly.
Concept 12.01 
Exploring the 
Internet
Nobody owns the Internet. It is a network 
in which every connected computer can 
exchange data with any other computer 
on the network. The term cyberspace 
captures the concept of the intangible, 
nonphysical territory that the Internet 
encompasses. The networks that make up 
the Internet are not maintained by one 
company or organization. Instead, the

puter to the Internet.
Internet is maintained by a conglomerate of 
volunteers across the world. Some govern­
ing bodies restrict control and/or provide 
equipment. But the majority of network 
servers and connectivity equipment are 
provided by universities, telecommunica­
tions companies, businesses, corporations, 
and services that sell Internet access. It 
really is amazing that it all works!

Concept 12.02 Investigating 
Internet Architecture
The I n t e r n e t  b a c k b o n e , the main 
high-speed routes through which data 
travels, is maintained by n e t w o r k  s e r v ­
ic e  p r o v i d e r s  ( N S P s )  such as AT&T, 
Sprint, Verizon, B B N , and U U N ET . The 
equipment of these providers is linked at 
n e t w o r k  a c c e s s  p o i n t s  ( N A P s )  so that 
data may, for example, begin its journey 
on a segment maintained by AT&T but 
cross over to a Sprint segment in order 
to reach its destination. Between your 
computer or business network and the 
Internet backbone are r o u t e r s , special­
ized devices that connect networks, locate 
the best path of transmission, and ensure 
that your data reaches its destination 
(Figure 12.2).
Concept 12.03 Understanding 
Interoperability
The Internet does more than allow you 
to freely exchange data among millions 
of computers; it provides you with the 
ability to exchange data regardless of the 
brand, model, or operating system of the 
computer you are using. This capability is 
called i n t e r o p e r a b i l i t y . When you access 
the Internet using a Mac, for example, you 
contact a number of computers that may 
include other Macs, Windows PCs, U N IX 
systems, smartphones, and even main­
frame computers. You do not know what 
type of computer you are accessing and it 
makes no difference.
How is the Internet’s interoperability 
achieved? The T C P / I P  ( T r a n s m i s s i o n  
C o n t r o l  P r o t o c o l !  I n t e r n e t  P r o to c o l)  
suite, which is a set of standard methods 
to package and transmit information on 
the Internet, enables interoperability 
(Figure 12.3). When you access the 
Internet, usually through an Internet 
access provider, your computer is sup­
plied with a copy of the TCP/IP programs. 
The TCP/IP suite employs a two-layer 
communication design. The T r a n s m i s s i o n  
C o n t r o l  P r o t o c o l  ( T C P ) , manages the 
disassembling of a message or file into 
smaller packets that are transmitted over 
the Internet and then received by a TC P 
layer on the destination computer that 
reassembles the packets into the original 
message. The lower layer, the I n t e r n e t  
P r o t o c o l  ( I P ) , handles the address part 
of each packet so that it gets to the right 
recipient.

Objective 2 | Evaluate 
Internet Connectivity 
Options
As a Library Assistant at a college, you 
serve on the college’s Technology Commit­
tee. The committee is investigating meth­
ods to establish Internet connectivity on a 
new rural extension site designed to reach 
a community approximately 60 miles from 
the main campus. The committee wants to 
be sure that the Internet connection can 
support all of the college services and ac­
commodate all students, especially those 
using older computers. Where do you start?
When you access the Internet, it is 
referred to as going online. You usually do 
not connect directly to the Internet back­
bone. Instead, you usually connect to an 
Internet access provider that in turn con­
nects you to the backbone via some type of 
wired or wireless connection.
Concept 12.04 Investigating 
Internet Access Providers
Intern et access providers are companies 
or businesses that provide access to the 
Internet either for free, for a fixed monthly
charge, or for an itemized per use fee.
Som e of th e roles and responsibilities of an  
access provider include:
• Providing and maintaining a connec­
tion to the Internet
• Supporting the hardware and software 
needed to service the connection
• Protecting their site and network 
from external threats such as viruses, 
hacker attacks, and other illegal 
activities
• Providing 24-hour customer service 
and technical support
Access providers fall into three categories: 
Internet service providers, online service 
providers, and wireless Internet service 
providers.
An Internet service provider (IS P ) 
is a company that provides access to the 
Internet. Initially, they provided no ad­
ditional services, but now ISPs have 
features to make them a one-stop source 
for Internet services. There are both local 
and national ISPs, each having various 
services and pricing. Ifyou are looking for 
an Internet service provider, consider The 
List, a buyer’s guide to ISPs that you can 
access at w w w .th e list.c o m .
E n e r g y -Aw a r e C o m p u t in g
It is easy to think of the Internet as just 
something out there, an intangible, hav­
ing no effect on our physical world. In 
reality, 2009 estimates indicate that In­
ternet data centers worldwide consumed
2 percent of global electricity production. 
Most of the energy was used to power 
forced-air cooling systems in the data cen­
ters. One data center operator compared 
the heat emitted from a rack of servers in a 
data center to the amount of heat emitted by 
a 7-foot stack of toaster ovens. The energy 
to cool such centers probably did not come 
from green sources and cost $30 billion.
A nother way to cool the data cen­
ters is under developm ent. This new 
idea is to use water, not air, to cool the 
com puting environment. W ater cooled 
to 6 0 °C - 7 0 °C  (1 58°F), which is cool
enough to keep the processing chips be­
low their maximum heat of 85°C (185°F), 
will be pumped through tiny channels in 
the com puter systems of the data cen­
ters and will absorb heat from the metal 
along the way. The working model, named 
Aquasar, develop ed  by IBM  Zurich and 
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology 
Zurich (ETH), will be located on the ETH 
cam pus. In this prototype, the w ater used 
to absorb the heat from the computer sys­
tems will release that heat into the building 
and then recirculate to cool the computer 
system. It is estimated that this system will 
reduce the carbon footprint of the ETH 
cam pus by 85 percent and save up to 
30 tons of carbon emissions a year. For 
more inform ation, go to w w w .yo u tu b e

An online service p rovider (O S P ) is a
for-profit firm that provides a proprietary 
network and offers special services that 
are available only to subscribers. Members 
may participate in instant messaging, chat 
rooms, and discussions, and take advan­
tage of fee-based content such as maga­
zines and newspapers. When they began, 
online services provided a large amount of 
content that was accessible only by those 
who subscribed to that online service, 
whereas ISPs predominantly served to 
provide access to the Internet and gener­
ally provided little exclusive content of 
their own. The distinction between these 
two services has become less defined as 
OSPs today offer Internet access and ISPs 
offer more user services. Popular OSPs are 
M SN  and AO L (Figure 12.4).
A wireless Internet service pro­
vider is a local or national company 
that provides wireless Internet access to 
computers and other mobile devices, such 
as notebooks and smartphones. Some fa­
miliar providers are AT&T, T-Mobile, and 
Verizon Wireless. Requirements for a wire­
less connection include a portable device, 
an internal wireless adapter or a U SB  port 
for connecting an external adapter, and
a wireless Internet access plan from a 
provider. Wireless connectivity for por­
table devices in your home or office is usu­
ally provided through a wireless router 
located in close proximity and connected to 
your provider.
Your access provider furnishes you 
with a modem, or some other type of hard­
ware, that enables access to the Internet 
backbone. Essentially, the provider acts 
as your access ramp to a highway; in this 
case, the highway is the Internet back­
bone. Your provider usually charges a 
monthly fee for Internet access, like the 
fee you pay to use some expressways.
Now that you can distinguish between 
access providers, focus on the types of 
physical connections used to gain entry to 
the Internet.
Concept 12.05 Understanding 
Connection Options
In addition to obtaining an Internet account, 
you must decide how you will access the 
Internet. Be aware that the access speed 
advertised by an Internet access provider is 
often a maximum and your usage will prob­
ably never reach the advertised figure. Your

access choices typically include the options 
shown in Figure 12.5.
• Dial-up access: Ifyou are searching 
for an affordable connection solution 
and speed is not a high priority, then 
a dial-up provider will likely meet 
your needs. A dial-up connection does 
not require any special hardware; it 
uses your existing phone jack and 
dial-up modem configurations. The 
downside of this type of access is the 
speed; it is the slowest of all Internet 
services.
• Digital subscriber line (DSL): A D SL 
connection offers faster access speeds 
than dial-up, while making use of or­
dinary phone lines with the addition of 
a special external modem. One draw­
back of D SL is that service does not 
extend more than a few miles from a 
telephone switching station or central 
office (CO).
• Cable access: Many cable TV compa­
nies provide permanent online con­
nections and offer high-speed Internet 
access, comparable to— and sometimes 
surpassing— D SL speeds. No phone 
line is needed, but a cable modem is 
required.
• Satellite access: If  your geographi­
cal area has been overlooked by D SL 
and cable providers, go outside. If 
you have a clear view of the sky, 
then you can most likely get high­
speed satellite Internet service!
The connection to your high-speed
satellite service is comprised of 
both indoor and outdoor equipment. 
Outside, there is an antenna and 
electronics to transmit and receive 
data, along with a connection to a 
small, unobtrusive dish. This equip­
ment connects to an indoor receive 
unit (IR U ) and indoor transmit unit 
(IT U ) that connect to your computer 
through a simple U S B  connector. 
Satellite is more costly than cable or 
D SL, but if you live in a rural area, 
it might be a viable alternative to 
dial-up.
• Fiber-optic service: Fiber-optic lines 
running directly to the home provide 
users with an incredibly fast Internet 
connection, easily surpassing other 
access methods. Fiber-optic service 
is rapidly becoming a challenger to 
D SL and cable providers, especially 
in the suburbs. However, this service 
is still unavailable in many cities and 
rural areas and is usually offered by 
a limited number of providers. No 
modem is needed, but fiber-optic 
cable may have to be installed to 
and within your home.
If you do not need a constant, daily Inter­
net connection, some businesses offer spe­
cial leased lines for companies, educational 
institutions, and large organizations. In­
ternet access is attained through the 
organization’s network and is usually 
free to the users because the company or 
institution pays the bill.

Objective 3 | 
Differentiate Between 
the Internet and the 
Web
As a Library Assistant at a college, your 
presentation to students must include in­
formation about how to navigate the Web 
and you want to encourage students to try 
different browsers. Where do you start?
W hat is the difference between saying 
I ’m on the Internet and saying I'm on the 
Web? The Internet and the Web are not 
the same thing, although we think of them 
that way. Recall that the Internet is a 
network of hardware—computers, cables, 
and routers—through which any computer 
can directly access other computers and 
exchange data. The W o r ld  W id e  W e b —or 
W e b  or W W W —is a portion of the Internet 
that contains billions of documents. Think 
of the Internet as the physical connection 
of millions of networks, like an interstate 
highway. The Web uses the Internet as 
its transport mechanism to distribute its 
collection of documents or resources. The 
Web uses the Internet architecture to 
move information in the same way that
cars and trucks use an interstate to move 
goods and people (Figure 12.6).
Just like the Internet, no one owns the 
Web. Standards and guidelines related to 
all aspects of the Web are published by the 
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an 
international organization based in Cam­
bridge, Massachusetts. Visit w w w .w 3 .org  
to review the mission of the W3C, a list of 
its 316 members, and Internet standards. 
Besides the W3C, Figure 12.7 lists organi­
zations that contribute to the development 
of the Internet and Web and describes the 
organization’s mission.
Concept 12.06 Viewing 
Content on the W eb
The documents that comprise the World 
Wide Web and are transported over the 
Internet are called W e b  p a g e s . Each page 
is a document or information resource 
created using H y p e r t e x t  M a r k u p  L a n ­
g u a g e  ( H T M L ) or E x t e n s i b l e  H y p e r te x t 
M a r k u p  L a n g u a g e  ( X H T M L ) . HTM L is 
a language that uses a tag system of code 
to create Web pages. In this system, text 
is surrounded by a pair of markers called 
tags. One tag starts the feature and an­
other indicates where it is to stop. The 
pair of tags describes how the text located

X H T M L  combines the flexibility of 
H TM L with the addition oi E x t e n s i b l e  
M a r k u p  L a n g u a g e  (X M L ), a language 
that enables Web page developers to create 
their own set of rules to define how data 
is to be represented on the Web. The rules 
created are included in the Web page and 
used by your browser to interpret the code 
correctly and display the page accurately.
A W e b  b r o w s e r  is a free program in­
stalled on your computer that displays a 
Web document by interpreting the H TM L 
or X H T M L format, enabling you to view 
and activate features that appear on that 
page. One of the most used features of 
markup languages is h y p e r t e x t , a feature 
that enables objects like text, pictures,
music, and programs to be linked to each 
other. It works by means oi h y p e r l i n k s — 
also called l i n k s — which are elements in 
an electronic document that act as the 
connector to another place in the same 
document or to an entirely different docu­
ment. Typically, you click on the hyperlink 
to bring another object into view (Figure 
12.8). When related Web pages are linked 
together by hyperlinks they create a W e b  
s i t e . A Web site typically contains a h o m e  
p a g e —also called an i n d e x  p a g e —which 
is a default page that displays automati­
cally when you enter a site at its top level.
Concept 12.07 Choosing a 
Browser
There are several browsers that you can 
use to navigate the Internet. You might 
even have more than one installed on your 
system and alternate between them. 
Figure 12.9 displays the five top browsers 
in use worldwide from June 2011 to 
Ju ly 2011. Each browser has variations 
in terms of its interface and features as 
described in Figure 12.10.

Popular Browsers and Their Features
Browser
Features
Internet Explorer 
(IE)
Internet Explorer, the browser installed on most newly purchased 
computers, offers some premier features:
• Extensive parental controls that can be customized.
• A variety of security and entertainment add-ons.
• A smart toolbar that offers search suggestions.
• The ability to pull a tab off the browser and pin it to the taskbar, ifyou 
are using Windows 7.
Firefox
Firefox, known for its speed and intuitive interface, also includes:
• The ability to group tabs together without opening a new window.
• Pin tabs as apps, which shrinks the tab to the si/.e of an icon and moves 
it lo the left of the tab bar. Pinned tabs can remain pinned over browser 
sessions.
• Consolidated menus to give the site more space.
Google Chrome
Chrome touts its speed and ability to make complex features easy to use.
Features include:
• Visual sampling of your most visited sites every time you open a new 
tab including most used search engines, recently bookmarked pages, 
and closed tabs. (Internet Explorer 9 includes a similar feature.)
• Tabs can be rearranged or dragged out of the browser to gather 
multiple tabs into one window.
• Every tab you use is run independently in the browser, so if one 
application crashes, others are unaffected.
• Bookmarking is accomplished by clicking a star icon at the left edge of 
the address bar.
Safari
Safari, which lacks some features like parental and antiphishing controls, 
was originally for Macs but is now also available for PCs. Features include:
• The Mac look and feel in the Internet environment.
• Tabbed browsing.
• Spell checking for all fields.
• Snapback—a temporary marker that enables you to return to a Web page.
Opera
Some features unique to Opera include:
• Duplicate this tab, a feature that avoids cutting and pasting the URL in 
the address bar.
• Fit to window width.
• Nicknames for collections of sites.
Figure 12.10
All five browser program s open the 
sam e way and use sim ilar features, such 
as tabbed browsing, navigation buttons, a 
search box, an address bar, and a statu s 
bar, as shown in Figure 12.11. All brows­
ers also have the ability to cache— m eaning 
store— Web page files and graphics on a 
com puter’s hard drive. When you browse 
a Web page for the first time, a copy of 
the page is stored on your hard drive in 
a storage space referred to as brow ser 
cache. If you attem pt to retrieve the page 
again, the brow ser does not go back to the
Internet, but instead retrieves the page 
from the browser’s cache. This elim inates 
excessive round trips to the server, dis­
plays the page for you faster, and reduces 
Internet traffic. However, ifyou are visit­
ing a news provider’s Web site th at is con­
stantly updating current stories, browser 
cache is not an advantage, because you do 
not w ant to view old news. This problem 
has been solved by including directives, 
referred to as freshness indicators, at the 
beginning of Web pages, images, and other 
features, th a t specify how long the page

the page w ithin the allotted time, the 
page is retrieved from the browser’s cache; 
otherw ise the round trip is made back 
to the originating server and a new page 
displays for you.
A few problems still exist in the distri­
bution of Web content; for example:
• Some HTML tags are only viewable 
in one browser or another. The only 
solutions th a t an HTML w riter has 
are to avoid using those tags, use
those tags and provide a message that 
the page is m eant for one browser 
or another, or w rite m ultiple pages 
and direct readers to the appropriate 
pages. W ith XHTML, however, ifyou 
need to define a tag for clarity across 
different browsers or create a new 
m arkup tag, you define the tag in an 
XHTML module and use it in your 
page as you would any other HTML 
tag. The brow ser interpreting the page 
reads the definition of the tag and 
presents it as defined. This feature

Video-on-demand (VOD) delivered wire­
lessly over the Internet is creating net­
work slowdowns and congestion. There 
was a 63 percent increase in VOD users in 
the fourth quarter of 2009. Due to the in­
creased demand for this service, its large 
swings in bandwidth, and excessive de­
mands on a server, VOD can affect the per­
formance of not only the video customer 
but also network applications. To accom­
modate this form of transmission, wire­
less networks need higher frequencies and 
wider bandwidth. Electrical engineers from 
the University of California San Diego are 
working to develop technologies for the 
network of the future. The key to creating 
higher frequencies and wider bandwidth is
advances in silicon-based circuits that op­
erate at millimeter and microwave frequen­
cies. Research at the university is focused 
on advanced radio-frequency CMOS chips, 
planar antennas, and system-level design 
that will increase data transfer 10 to 100 
times, yet maintain the same energy con­
sumption. Lawrence Larson, who leads the 
Radio Frequency Integrated Circuit (RFIC) 
group, captures the potential of the new 
technology by comparing the current con­
nection and transport ability between your 
smartphone and tower to a drinking straw. 
He claims that this technology will be the 
equivalent of replacing the straw with a fire 
hose. This analogy provides a visual image 
for the projected increased bandwidths 
and speed that research promises.

m akes a page truly com patible w ith all 
browsers. As stated earlier, the agency 
responsible for standardizing HTML 
and XHTML is the World Wide Web 
Consortium  (W3C).
• Not all links work. The author of a 
Web page can delete the link or move 
it at any tim e w ithout notice. For 
this reason, dead lin ks—also called 
broken lin k s —which are links to 
docum ents or features th a t have dis­
appeared or been moved, are common 
on the Web.
• No individual or organization vali­
dates inform ation posted on the Web. 
When you create a hyperlink to a Web 
site you did not create, investigate the 
credentials of the source and the ac­
curacy of the content. This is critical to 
the integrity of your own Web site or 
Web page.
• Basic Web pages are not expensive 
to create or host. This has led to the 
proliferation of Web content and to 
inform ation overload. The Web 
content creator can supply too 
m uch data, more th an  w hat is 
necessary to su b stan tiate a point. 
You, as a Web searcher, can get 
caught up in a search and become 
sa tu ra te d  w ith content and lose 
focus.
Concept 12.08 Connecting 
with W eb Servers
Web sites and th e ir associated im ages 
and scripts are housed on Web serv ers, 
a com puter ru n n in g  special softw are 
th a t enables it to respond to requests 
for inform ation or accept inform ation. 
M illions of Web servers are located 
all over the world. W hen you en ter 
the Web address of a Web site or click 
a hyperlink on a Web page, you are 
req u esting inform ation, a Web page, 
from a server. More complex is a re­
quest from an online shopping site 
for a list of sw eatsh irts available in 
size M edium . In this case the server 
accepts your inform ation, searches 
a datab ase of products stored on 
th e server or a storage device connected 
to the server, and then displays the 
products th a t correspond to your 
request. If th e inform ation is not 
found, the server responds w ith an 
erro r m essage.

Concept 12.09 | Examining the 
Parts of a W eb Address
To locate a resource on the Web, you m ust 
know how to find the Web server on which 
it resides. Every host, com puter, server, 
device, and application th a t communicates 
over the Internet is assigned an Internet 
Protocol address (IP address)—a nu­
merical identification and logical address 
assigned to devices participating in a com­
puter network. The IP address consists of 
four groups of num bers separated by peri­
ods. The value in each group ranges from
0 to ‘255. As an example, 64.12.107.131 is 
one of the IP addresses for www.aol.cotn.
IP addresses are either static or dy­
namic. A static IP address never changes 
and is the type used by most m ajor Web 
sites. A dynam ic IP address is autom ati­
cally assigned to a com puter when you log 
on to a network. Internet service providers 
(ISPs) are assigned dynam ic IP addresses 
th a t they, in turn, dispense to you, their 
customer. Although this num eric system  
works well for com puters, it does not work 
as well for people. It is much easier to use 
a U niform  Resource Locator (URL)—a 
string of characters th at precisely identi­
fies an Internet resource’s type and loca­
tion. Typing www.aol.com is easier than 
rem em bering and typing 64.12.107.131.
A complete URL has four parts: pro­
tocol, domain nam e, path, and resource/ 
filename. Each component provides a 
piece of data needed to locate the site 
(Figure 12.12).
Protocol, the first part of a complete 
URL, specifies the H ypertext T ransfer 
Protocol (HTTP), which is the Internet 
standard th at supports the exchange of in­
formation on the Web. The protocol name 
is followed by a colon and two forward

slash m arks (//). You can generally omit 
the http:// protocol designation when you 
are typing the URL of a Web page, because 
the browser assum es th at you are brows­
ing an unsecured hypertext Web page. For 
exam ple, you can access Pearson’s Web 
site for the GO! series by typing w w w . 
p earson high ered.com /go. Most brows­
ers can also access information using 
other protocols such as FTP (File T rans­
fer Protocol), which transfers files from 
one com puter on the Internet to another; 
POP (Post Office Protocol), which is used 
to receive e-mail; and HTTPS (H ypertext 
T ransfer Protocol Secure), which is used 
when the content being transferred re­
quires encryption 
and a secure iden­
tification of the 
server such as is 
required for finan­
cial transactions.
The second 
part of a complete 
URL specifies 
the Web site’s 
dom ain nam e, 
which correlates to 
the Web server’s 
IP address. The 
domain nam e 
has two parts: a 
host nam e and a 
top-level domain 
name. Some do­
main names also 
include a prefix, 
the most common 
of which is www. 
The host nam e is 
usually the nam e 
of the group or 
institution hosting
the site. The top-level dom ain (TLD)
nam e is the extension—such as .com or 
.edu—following the host nam e and in­
dicates the type of group or institution 
to which the site belongs. This two-part 
identifier is used by the Internet in the 
D om ain N am e System  (DNS), which is a 
system  th at links domain nam es with their 
corresponding num erical IP addresses and 
functions like a phone book for the Inter­
net. The Domain Name System  enables 
you to type an address th a t includes letters 
as well as num bers; for exam ple pearson- 
highered.com instead of 165.193.140.24, its 
IP num erical address. Through a process 
called dom ain nam e registration, indi­
viduals and organizations register a unique 
domain nam e with a service organization 
such as InterNIC, and are assigned a 
unique Internet address (IP address) that 
will be associated with th a t domain name. 
You can use your favorite search engine to 
search for domain nam e registrars to find 
sites th a t provide this service. One exam ­
ple is w w w .hover.com —a registrar that 
is inexpensive and easy to use.
A domain reveals a great deal about 
where a com puter is located. For Web sites 
hosted in the LTnited S tates, top-level do­
main nam es—th e last p art of the domain 
name—indicate the type of organization to 
which the Web site belongs (Figure 12.13). 
O utside the U nited S tates, the top-level 
domain indicates the nam e of the country 
from which the Web site is published or of 
which the owner is a citizen, such as .ca 
(Canada), .uk (United Kingdom), and .mx 
(Mexico). For more inform ation on domain 
names, visit the In tern et Corporation for 
Assigned Names and N um bers (ICANN) 
at w w w .ican n .org.
The third part of a complete URL. 
the p a th , specifies the location of the
562 
GO! All In One | Chapter 12: The Internet and World Wide Web

docum ent on the server. It contains the 
docum ent’s location on the com puter, 
including the nam es of subfolders if any.
In the exam ple in Figure 12.12, the path 
to the student contact page on the Web 
server at w w w .p earson h igh ered .eom  
is student.
The last part of a complete URL, the 
resource or file n a m e , gives the nam e 
of the file resource you are accessing. A 
resource is a file, such as an HTML file, a 
sound file, a video file, or a graphics file. 
The resource’s extension—the p art of the 
file nam e after the period—indicates the 
type of resource it is. For example, HTML 
docum ents have the .htm l or .htm  exten­
sion. M any URLs do not include a resource 
nam e because they reference the Web 
site’s home or index page.
Concept 12.10 Surfing 
the W eb
Once you have subscribed and connected 
to an In tern et service provider and down­
loaded and opened a browser, you are 
ready to su rf the Web. To access a Web 
page, you can do any of the following, as 
illustrated in Figure 12.14:
• Type a URL in the address bar.
• Click a tab in the browser window. 
Most m ajor browsers offer tabbed 
brow sing, which is a feature th a t 
opens new Web pages as tabs w ithin 
one window instead of a new window 
for each page. This enables you to 
have several Web pages open at once 
and switch quickly between them . The 
tabs are not visible in Figure 12.14 
because the History list is extended.
URL in address bar 
History List
Favorites
• Click a hyperlink. H yperlinks are 
usually underlined, but som etimes 
they are embedded in graphics or 
highlighted in other ways, such as 
with shading or colors. Most browsers 
indicate the presence of a hyperlink 
by changing the on-screen pointer
to a hand shape when it is over a 
hyperlink.
• Use the H istory lis t, which is a list of 
previously visited Web pages. It is ac­
cessed in Internet Explorer by clicking 
the arrow to the right of the address 
bar and in Firefox by selecting the 
H istory option on the menu bar. Both 
browsers then display a drop-down list 
from which you can select a Web page.
• Make use of the Favorites or Book­
m arks feature. This feature, called 
Favorites in IE and Bookmarks in 
Firefox, is located on the m enu bar. 
When selected, you can m ark a Web 
page th a t you visit frequently. To 
return to th a t page later, click the 
Favorite or Bookm arks option and se­
lect the Web page nam e from the drop­
down list. Favorites can be grouped 
into categories.
After you have browsed the Web and 
accessed Web pages, you m ay w ant to 
download or upload data. In the process 
called d o w n lo a d in g , a docum ent or file 
is transferred from another com puter to 
your com puter, for exam ple when down­
loading music from iTunes. Your com puter 
is the destination; the other com puter is 
the source. In the process called upload­
ing. you transfer files from your com puter 
to another com puter, for example, when

you upload a video you created to YouTube. 
When uploading, your computer is the 
source and the other computer is the des­
tination. You download and upload files 
when using a Web-based course m anage­
ment system such as Blackboard or MyltLab. 
These system s allow you and the instruc­
tor to interact in classes delivered entirely 
online or to supplem ent a face-to-face class. 
As a student using one of these systems, 
you can download course notes or applica­
tion files to your own computers. When you 
complete an assignm ent, you can upload 
the completed assignm ent to a drop box 
folder for your instructor to grade.
No m atter how fam iliar you are with 
the source, you should use caution when 
downloading files of unknown origin from 
the Web. If you download software from 
a site th a t does not inspect files using 
up-to-date antivirus software, you could 
infect your own com puter with a virus.
Be sure to use an antivirus program to 
check any software or data files th a t you 
download. For a Windows-based PC, use 
Microsoft Security Essentials, which is a 
free program .
Concept 12.11 
Getting and 
Sharing Information on the 
Internet
Sometim es the best way to get information 
online is from an individual or agency that 
is also online and com m unicating or con­
tributing through an online feed, conversa­
tion, or Web posting.
One way to keep up with news, 
w eather, and sports is by using R eally 
Sim ple Syndication (RSS). After you set 
up a connection to a Web site th at provides 
an RSS feed, you will receive constant 
updates over the In tern et from th at site 
w ithout any further action on your part. 
The URL or Web page th a t allows its up- 
to-date inform ation to be published on an­
other Web site is said to be syndicated.
So how does RSS work? A Web page 
th at displays constantly changing data 
m aintains a list of RSS feeds. Individuals 
interested in getting updated information 
from locations on the list can, through an 
RSS feed, select sources from the list and 
receive the updated inform ation on their 
own Web page. There are hundreds of Web 
sites th a t provide RSS feeds, for example, 
the New York Times, the BBC, Reuters, 
and many blogs. If your site will be up­
dating several feeds, you can use an RSS 
aggregator—a program  th a t remembers 
your subscription list, checks each site on 
a regular basis, alerts you if new informa­
tion has been published, and organizes the 
results for you (Figure 12.15). Many RSS 
aggregators are available through your 
browser. Some are even integrated into 
your e-mail, and others are standalone 
applications. For exam ple, Outlook 2010 
includes an RSS aggregator.

word for fast—is a sim ple Web page th a t 
can be public or restricted to specific m em ­
bers, and on which any visitor or m em ber 
can post text or images, read previous 
posts, change posted inform ation, and 
track earlier changes. No elaborate coding 
is needed; ju st click to post, click to refresh 
the page, and you are done. Inform ation 
referenced from a public wiki should be 
verified through another source because 
entries can be made by anyone and the 
content is not always verified.
A nother way to share inform ation on­
line is by using a blog, which is short for 
Web log. A blog is the Internet equivalent 
of a journal or diary. Bloggers post th eir 
thoughts and opinions, along w ith photos 
or links to interesting Web sites, for the 
entire world to see. Over 1 million blogs 
are posted on the Web. Some are m eant 
for family and friends; some offer run­

may be just w hat you need! A podcast is a 
digital file that contains audio, images, and 
video and is available as a download from 
the Internet or is released periodically by

Posted today. July 29 20U by The JobsBloggers
It's hard to believe summer is drawing to a 
close already, This year, we were lucky enough 
to host more than 1000 summer interns, 
representing the world s top universities and 
worbng on technologies Irom Azure to Xbox-
last night we kicked back and celebrated our 
latest intern class hard work and amazing accomplishments withj 
a party at Seattle s Woodland Park Zoo. One of our favorite

U sing hyperlinks on a reliable Web 
page could be a start. Some Web sites 
offer a subject guide, a list of subject- 
related categories such as business, news, 
or trends that, when selected, displays a 
page of related links (Figure 12.17). These 
guides do not try to include every Web 
page on th e World Wide Web, but they 
offer a selection of high-quality pages th at 
represent some of the more useful Web 
pages in a given category. If you are ju st 
beginning your search for information, a 
subject guide is an excellent place to start.
A p o rta l is a Web page th at acts as 
a gatew ay to many diverse resources and 
presents those sources in an organized 
way. It enables you to locate fast-breaking 
news, local w eather, stock quotes, sports 
scores, and e-mail. Portal sites usually use 
indexes and lists of links to provide a jum p­
ing-off point for your search. Sites such as 
MSNBC, AOL, iGoogle, and USA.gov are 
exam ples of portals (Figure 12.18).
A side effect of your search method is 
the clickstream  you generate, the trail 
of Web links you followed to get to a par­
ticular site. In tern et m erchants are quite 
interested in analyzing clickstream  activ­
ity so th a t they can do a better job of ta r­
geting advertisem ents and tailoring Web 
pages to potential customers.
Ifyou cannot find the inform ation you 
are looking for using any of the m ethods 
above, try using a search engine.
Concept 12.13 Using Search 
Engines
You have probably heard of Google,
Yahoo!, Bing, and Ask. Knowing how to 
use these search engines effectively, and 
also knowing their lim itations, can greatly 
increase your chances of finding the spe­
cific inform ation you w ant.
Search engines are programs that 
use databases of the Web pages they have 
indexed to locate information you requested 
in a search bar on th eir Web site. To add 
pages to their databases, search engines 
make use of com puter programs, referred 
to as spiders, to roam the World Wide Web 
via the Internet, visit sites and databases, 
and keep the search engine’s database of 
Web pages up to date. AJso known as crawl­
ers, knowledge hots, or knowbots, they ob­
tain new pages, update known pages, and 
delete obsolete ones from the database’s in­
dex. Most large search engines operate sev­
eral spiders all the time. Even so, the Web 
is so enormous th at it can take six months 
to cover the content, resulting in a certain 
degree of antiquated results. Such outdated 
results produce lin k rot—hyperlinks that 
no longer work because Web pages have 
been removed or restructured. Such links 
can make a Web search frustrating and 
tedious.
Google is at the top of the list of favor­
ite search engines. Figure 12.19 displays

A ugust 2010 statistics on the popularity 
of the five core search engines. You might 
wonder why there is more than one search 
engine. Each search engine uses a differ­
ent strategy to locate Web content and 
thus retu rn  different results. Some search 
engines are special purpose engines and 
only return search results for a specific 
targ et like music, movies, or employment. 
Refer to the list of search engines in
Figure 12.20, try  a few, and see if the 
results are w hat you expect.
To use a search engine, type one or 
more words th a t describe the subject you 
are looking for into the search text box and 
click Search or press Enter. Generally, it is 
a good idea to type several words—four or 
five—to reduce the results displayed.

duce unsatisfactory results? The problem

Often a search produces a large and 
varied num ber of results. There are some 
search techniques th a t can help zero in on 
your target inform ation.
Concept 12.14 Mastering 
Search Basics
By learning a few search techniques, you 
can greatly increase the accuracy of your 
Web searches. Search operators, which 
are symbols or words used to refine a search, 
can be helpful. Although specific methods 
may vary, some or all of the following tech­
niques will work with most search engines.
W ildcards, also called truncation  
symbols, are symbols such as * and ? th a t 
take the place of characters in a search. 
W ildcards help you improve the accuracy 
of your searches and are useful ifyou are 
unsure of the exact spelling of a word. For 
example, the search term  batik* m ight 
return bank, banks, banking, bankruptcy, 
bank account, and so on.
lies in the ambiguity of the English lan­
guage. Suppose you are searching for infor­
m ation on the Great Wall of China. You will 
find some information on the ancient Chi­
nese defensive installation, but you may also 
get the menu of the Great Wall of China, 
a Chinese restaurant; information on the 
Great Wall hotel in Beijing; or the lyrics of 
Great Wall of China, a song by Billy Joel.
Full Web search engines generally do 
not index specialized information such as 
nam es and addresses, job advertisements, 
quotations, or newspaper articles. To find 
such information, you need to use special­
ized search engines. Examples of such 
specialized search engines include Indeed, 
a database of more than 1 million jobs, and 
Infoplease, which contains the full text of an 
encyclopedia and an almanac (Figure 12.21).
You can save the results of your 
searches—the Web pages you visit by 
following the resulting links of a search 
engine— to your hard drive by using your 
brow ser’s E°ile, Save As m enu sequence. 
Ifyou do not w ant or need the entire Web 
page, you can right-click the elem ents of 
the page and choose from a variety of op­
tions; for example, Save Target As, Save 
P icture As, Print Target, P rint Picture, 
E-m ail Picture. You can also use your

A nother way to improve the accu­
racy of your searches is through phrase 
searching, which is generally performed 
by typing a phrase within quotation 
m arks. This tells the search engine to re­
trieve only those documents th at contain 
the exact phrase rath er th an  some or all of 
the words anyw here in the document.
W ith m any search engines, you can 
improve search performance by specifying 
an inclusion operator—a symbol in a 
Web search string, usually a plus sign— 
th at instructs the search software to
display only results th a t contain the word 
or phrase following the inclusion operator. By 
listing several key term s with this search 
operator, you can isolate pages th at con­
tain only one or more of your target term s. 
If the list of retrieved docum ents contains 
many item s th a t you do not w ant, you can 
use the exclusion operator—a symbol 
in a Web search string, usually a minus 
sign—th a t instructs the search software 
to omit displaying results th a t contain the 
word or phrase following the exclusion 
operator (Figure 12.22).
F IG U R E  12.21 Special­
ized search engines, like 
Infoplease, provide access to 
selected reference tools and 
resources.

Environmental concerns generate a lot 
of interest. Now there is even a green 
search engine—Green Maven at www. 
greenm aven.com . Use it to find environ­
mentally conscious Web sites and news.
You can also find a variety of ecologi­
cally and socially conscious search en­
gines that donate to causes based on the 
searches people run. Two such engines 
are Ecosearch at w w w .ecosearch .org 
powered by Google and GoodSearch 
at w w w .goodsearch.com  powered by 
Yahoo! There are, however, many other 
such sites. Use them as you would your 
normal search engine, and you will get 
great results. Do not just click to donate. 
Without attempting a legitimate search, 
you will jeopardize the relationships that 
enable such sites to fund their initiatives.
Concept 12.15 Conducting 
Boolean Searches
In m ost search engines, you can conduct 
B oolean searches, which use logical op­
erators—AND, OR, and NOT—to link the
words you are searching for. By 
using Boolean operators, you can 
add precision to your search results.
The table in Figure 12.23 provides a 
few exam ples.
W hen used to link two search words, 
the AND operator retu rn s only those 
docum ents th a t contain both words, ju st 
as th e plus sign does. If your search 
retrieves too few docum ents, try the 
OR operator. This may be helpful 
when a topic has several common 
synonym s, such as car, auto, automobile, 
and vehicle. U sing the OR operator usu­
ally retrieves a larger q uantity of docu­
m ents. If you w ant to exclude unw anted 
docum ents, use the NOT operator. This 
operator om its an>r docum ents containing 
the word preceded by NOT, ju st as the 
m inus sign does.
M any search engines th a t support 
Boolean operators allow you to use paren­
theses to place one search string inside 
of another, a process called nesting. 
W hen you nest an expression, the 
search engine evaluates th e expression 
from left to right and searches for the 
content w ithin the parentheses first.
Such expressions enable you to conduct 
a search w ith unm atched accuracy. To 
learn more about search engines, their spe­
cialized capabilities, and specific examples

Concept 12.16 Critically 
Evaluating W eb Pages
After you have found information on the 
Web, you m ust evaluate it critically. Any­
one can publish information on the Web; 
many Web pages are not subject to the fact- 
checking standards of newspapers or m aga­
zines. Although you can find excellent and 
reliable inform ation on the Web, you can 
also find pages th at are biased or blatantly 
incorrect.
As you are evaluating a Web page for 
possible use or reference, read with a criti­
cal eye and ask yourself these questions:
• Who is the author of this page? Is the 
author affiliated with a recognized in­
stitution, such as a university or a well- 
known company? Is there any evidence 
th at the author is qualified and possesses 
credentials with respect to this topic?
• Does the author reference his or her 
sources? If so, do they appear to be from 
recognized and respected publications?
• Who is the Web page affiliated with? 
Who pays for this page? The associa­
tion between the page server, sponsor, 
and author should be credible.
• Is the language objective and dispas­
sionate, or is it strident and argum en­
tative? Is it w ritten in a form and level 
th a t suits the target population?
• W hat is the purpose of this page? Is the 
author trying to sell something or pro­
mote a biased idea? Who would profit if 
this page’s information were accepted as 
true? Does the site include links to
external information, or does it reference 
only other pages within the site itself?
• Does the information appear to be 
accurate? Is the page free of sweeping 
generalizations or other signs of shoddy 
thinking? Do you see any misspellings 
or gram m atical errors th at would indi­
cate a poor educational background?
• Is this page current? The information 
should be up to date.
Concept 12.17 Using the Web 
for Your College Assignments
Finding inform ation on the Web can help 
you as a consum er to locate products, and 
it can also help you as a stu d en t to locate 
authoritative online sources and m aterial 
in published works.
M any respected m agazines and jour­
nals have established Web sites where you 
can search back issues, which gives you 
the power and convenience of the Internet, 
plus m aterial th a t is more reliable than 
the average Web page.
Keep in mind th at the Web is only one 
of several sources you can and should use 
for research. M any high-level research 
tools can be found in your institution’s 
library such as EBSCOhost, LexisNexis, 
and other professional databases. Check 
your library’s home page to find out w hat 
Internet services are available.
Also, try Google Scholar at http:// 
seholar.google.com  to search for scholarly 
literature from many academic disciplines 
and www.USA.gov for information on govern­
ment agencies and services (Figure 12.24).

Concept 12.18 Citing Online 
and Offline References
Including citations in your work is an im­
portant way to honor copyright and avoid

Guides site at w w w .Iib .b erk eley .ed u / 
H e lp /g u id e s.h tm l to learn how to cite on­
line and electronic resources properly.
Application developers like Microsoft in­
clude reference options within their current 
word processing programs. Such features 
prompt you to input the necessary informa­
tion into a form that the application then for­
m ats into the style you select, usually APA 
or MLA for college papers (Figure 12.25).

Internet Services
In your job as Library A ssistant at a col­
lege, you have been asked by several fac­
ulty mem bers to assist them  with their 
Web sites. In particular, they w ant to 
include In tern et services in th eir sites. 
W here do you start?
An In tern et service is a set of stan ­
dards, also referred to as protocols, th at 
define how two types of program s—a cli­
ent, such as a Web browser th a t runs on
the user’s com puter, and a server—can 
communicate w ith each other through the 
Internet. By using the service’s protocols, 
the client requests inform ation from a 
server program th a t is located on some 
other com puter on the Internet.
In the past, browsers such as Netscape 
N avigator and the Mozilla Suite were 
distributed as softw are suites th at in­
cluded client program s to handle e-mail, 
newsgroups, and chat services, as well as 
browsing. C urrent browsers, including In­
ternet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, 
and Safari for Macs, operate as standalone 
programs. Although it is still possible to 
obtain client software for some of these 
services, many of them  are Web based 
and do not require any special software to 
use. However, you may need to install an 
appropriate plug-in to ensure full function­
ality. Figure 12.26 lists a selection of com­
monly used Internet services.
Concept 12.19 Staying in 
Touch by Using E-Mail
The most popular Internet service is e- 
mail. E-m ail, which is short for electronic 
m ail, is a system th a t enables you to send 
and receive messages over a network. 
E-mail is an indispensable tool for busi­
nesses and individuals due to its speed, 
convenience, and its ability to be saved, 
searched, and retrieved. Text m essaging 
is often preferred over e-mail because of 
its immediacy in communication. Both 
e-mail and text m essaging are preferred

for interpersonal w ritten communication, 
far outpacing the old-fashioned paper let­
ter sent by the U.S. Postal Service.
When you receive an e-mail, you can 
reply to the m essage, forward it to some­
one else, store it for later action, or delete 
it. In addition to w riting the text of the 
e-mail m essage, you can form at the text, 
check its spelling, organize your e-mail 
into folders, and include an e-mail a t­
tachm ent (Figure 12.27). An e-m ail a t­
ta ch m e n t can be any type of com puter 
file—docum ent, photo, audio, or video— 
th a t is included with an e-mail message.
If you receive an e-mail message contain­
ing an attachm ent, your e-mail program  
displays a distinctive icon, such as a paper
clip, to notify you. E-mail usually arrives 
a t the destination server in a few seconds. 
It is then stored on the server until the re­
cipient logs on to the server and downloads 
the message.
To send an e-mail, you need to know 
the recipient’s e-mail address. An e-m ail 
address is a unique cyberspace identity 
for a particular recipient th at follows the 
form myname@ somedomain.com. The com­
ponents of an e-mail address are the user 
nam e or other identifier, the nam e of the 
domain th at is hosting the e-mail service, 
and the top-level domain th at identifies the 
provider’s type of institution. For instance, 
you can send m ail to the president of 
the United States at the e-mail address
Procedure for sending an e-mail attachment

president@ whitehouse.gov. In this instance, 
the user nam e is president, the domain 
is ivhitehouse, and the top-level domain 
is .gov, which indicates government. See­
ing someone’s e-mail address can be very 
revealing!
If you typically send e-mails to the same 
group of people frequently, consider creat­
ing a distribution list, which is a grouping 
of individuals in your list of contacts, all of 
whom you w ant to send the same e-mails.
E-mail has many benefits: It is inex­
pensive, fast, and easy to access; enables 
collaboration; creates an electronic paper 
trail; and saves paper.
Be aw are of potential problems with 
e-mail. Som etim es e-mail system s fail 
to properly send or receive mail. A ttach­
m ents may not be delivered or they may 
be blocked by e-mail system adm inistra­
tors as potentially unsafe. M essages can 
become corrupt and may not display prop­
erly. Som etim es, ifyou do not regularly 
check your m ail, your Inbox may overllow, 
which causes m essages received past the 
overflow point to be bounced out of the box 
and never delivered.
P erhaps the w orst thing th at can hap­
pen w ith e-mail is th a t you hastily send 
a m essage th a t you later wished you had 
not. Or, you use the Reply All or Forward 
feature to send inappropriate or irrelevant 
m essages th a t can em barrass you or th at 
inconvenience the receiver.
Concept 12.20 Using Instant 
Messaging
W hat is faster than e-mail and more conve­
nient than picking up the phone? The an­
sw er is in stant m essaging—referred to as
IM—system s th at alert you when a friend 
or business associate who also uses the IM 
system  is online. You can then contact this 
person and exchange m essages and attach­
m ents, including m ultim edia files.
To use IM. you m ust install instant 
messenger software from an instant mes­
senger service, such as AOL’s AIM or 
Microsoft's Live M essenger, on your com­
puter. You can use IM system s on any type 
of computer, including handhelds. Many 
IM services also give you access to informa­
tion such as daily news, stock prices, sports 
scores, and the w eather, and you can keep 
track of your appointm ents. There is no 
standard IM protocol, which means that 
you can send messages only to people who 
are using the sam e IM service th at you are.
A th reat to the use of IM is a phenom­
enon known as sp im m in g , spam that ta r­
gets users of instant messaging. Spimming 
is Lo IM as spam  is to e-mail. Be very care­
ful about opening files or clicking on a link 
sent in an instant m essage by an unknown 
sender.
Concept 12.21 
Connecting by 
Using Social Networks
Social netw orking is a way to build and 
expand online com m unities. Originally 
such sites were created to foster relation­
ships am ong people but since have ex­
tended their usage to prom ote business.
On a social netw orking site like Facebook, 
Google+, or MySpace, you can create an 
online profile, invite friends and acquain­
tances to join your netw ork, and invite 
their friends to join too. The table in 
Figure 12.28 provides a brief description 
of the most popular social network sites.
Popular Social Networking Sites
Social Site
D escription
Facebook
The largest of the social networking sites and useful to keep in touch with friends and family, post photos, 
share links, and distribute information with people you identify as friends. Businesses use Facebook to promote 
themselves and their products in a less formal manner for significantly lower cost than traditional advertising.
Linkedln
A professional social networking site on which you post your professional profile and resume, connect 
with colleagues, and seek advice from experts.
MySpace
A social network that promotes itself as a fan powered social entertainment destination with a major 
focus on music.
Twitter
A free, real-time blogging system in which you send and read short messages of up to 140 characters. You 
look up the Twitter accounts of friends or notable people and indicate that you want to become a follower 
and view their Twitter posts, which are called tweets. For example, if you are a fan of major league 
baseball, you might follow a sports news writer who reports on your favorite team.

of A m erican adults 29 years of age and 
younger use social netw orking Web sites. 
S tatistics like th is fuel the concern over 
security and the need to educate young 
adults on the use and possible repercus­
sion of postings placed on such sites.
Once posted, pictures and content are 
easily shared and distributed to others, 
som etim es with detrim ental effects. You 
should give thought to the inform ation 
you publicly display and consider the 
possible consequences. If you are search­
ing for em ploym ent, m ake sure th a t your 
social netw orking site is not offensive. 
Em ployers are researching candidates’ 
Facebook sites to gain insight into a
potential em ployee’s personality and 
behavior.
Concept 12.22 Joining 
Online Discussions on 
Usenet
U senet is a w orldw ide com puter-based 
discussion system  accessible through the 
Internet. It consists of thou san d s of topi­
cally nam ed new sgroups, which are dis­
cussion groups devoted to a single topic. 
A new sgroup typically requires partici­
p an ts to use a program  called a news 
reader. Each new sgroup contains 
articles th a t users have posted for all 
to see. U sers can respond to specific 
articles by posting follow-up articles. 
Over tim e, a discussion th read  develops 
as people reply to th e replies. A th rea d  
is a series of articles th a t offer a continu­
ing com m entary on the sam e specific 
subject.
U senet newsgroups are organized into 
the following m ain categories:
• S tandard newsgroups: You are

newsgroups. Figure 12.30 lists the 
standard newsgroup subcategories. 
Alt newsgroups: The alt category is 
much more freewheeling. Anyone 
can create an alt newsgroup, which 
explains why so m any of them  have 
silly or offensive names.
Biz newsgroups: These newsgroups 
are devoted to the commercial uses of 
the Internet.
The easiest way to access U senet is 
through Google Groups h ttp ^ /g ro u p s. 
google.com . You can read and post 
m essages, but be careful w hat you post 
on Usenet. W hen you post an article, you 
are publishing in the public domain. 
Sometimes articles are stored for long 
periods in W eb-accessible archives.
A m essage b o ard  is sim ilar to a 
new sgroup, but it is easier to use 
and does not require a new sreader.
M any colleges and universities have 
sw itched to m essage boards for this 
reason.
Concept 12.23 Using 
Electronic Mailing Lists
E lectro n ic m a ilin g  lists are a v aria­
tion of e-m ail th a t allow s for the auto­
m atic d istribution of m essages to all 
individuals on a m ailing list. It consists 
of a list of e-m ail addresses of the sub­
scribers, th e e-m ail m essages sent to 
those subscribers, and a reflector—a 
single e-m ail address th a t receives or 
creates th e e-m ail and sends a copy of it 
to all subscribers. Because the m essages 
are tran sm itted  as e-m ail, only individu­
als who are subscribers to the m ailing 
list receive and view th e m essages. Some 
colleges and u niversities host electronic 
m ailing lists th a t include all registered 
stu d en t and sta ff to provide notification 
of security issues on cam pus or w eather 
closings.
Concept 12.24 Making Phone 
Calls Using VoIP
VoIP (Voice over In te rn e t Protocol)
enables you to speak to others over a 
broadband In te rn e t connection instead 
of over a traditional analog phone line 
(Figure 12.31). One advantage of VoIP is 
th a t the telephone calls over the Internet 
do not incur a surcharge beyond w hat 
the user is paying for In tern et access, 
much in the sam e w ay th a t you do not 
pay for sending individual e-m ails over 
the Internet. W hat do you need to use 
VoIP? This form of com m unication re­
quires a broadband In tern et connection, 
a VoIP service provider, and a norm al 
telephone w ith a VoIP ad ap ter or a com­
puter with supporting softw are. C alls to 
others using the sam e service are usually 
free, w hereas calls to those using other 
services can vary. M any businesses are

Concept 12.25 Transferring 
Files Using File Transfer 
Protocol
File T ra n sfe r Protocol (FTP) is one
way to tran sfer files over the Internet, 
and it is especially useful for transferring 
files th a t are too large to send by e-m ail. 
A lthough you can use special FTP client 
softw are, such as W S_FTP Home, you 
can also tran sfer files to and from an FTP 
server sim ply by using your brow ser or 
W indows Explorer. FTP can tran sfer two 
types of files: ASCII and binary. ASCII 
files are text files while binary files are 
files saved in the file form at of the appli­
cation used to created them .
In most cases, you need a user nam e 
and a password to access an FTP server. 
FTP services are built into such academ ic 
interfaces as Blackboard and used by a 
stu d en t to upload his or h er assignm ent 
to the designated link or drop box for 
your course.
Objective 6 | Evaluate 
E-Commerce Sites
In your job as a Library A ssistant at a 
college, m any students are interested in 
f•-commerce—the use of networks or the 
Internet to carry out business. You have 
been asked to create a slide presentation 
to dem onstrate the use of e-commerce for 
students. W here do you start?
A large portion of Internet traffic and 
Web sites are associated with e-commerce. 
Commerce refers to the selling of goods or 
services with the expectation of m aking a 
reasonable profit. Electronic com m erce 
or e-commerce is the use of networks or 
the Internet to carry out business of 
any type. Many e-tailers—Web-based

the Web, you will stop mid make a purchase.
E-commerce supports many types of 
traditional business transactions, includ­

accessible to anyone w ith an Internet 
connection and a Web browser.
Concept 12.26 Identifying 
Types of E-Commerce
There are three types of e-commerce:
• W hen a business uses the Internet 
to provide another business with the 
m aterials, services, and/or supplies it 
needs to conduct its operations, they 
are engaging in business-to-business 
(B 2B) e-commerce. For instance, the 
popular office supplies chain Staples 
has a B2B division th a t operates the 
Web site w w w .sta p le sa d v a n ta g e . 
com  for mid-size and Fortune
1000 companies.
• The online exchange or trade of 
goods, services, or information be­
tw een individual consum ers is 
consum er-to-consum er (C2C) 
e-commerce. Often C2C e-commerce 
involves the use of an interm ediate 
site, such as the popular online auc­
tion destination eBay. O ther C2C 
sites include craigslist and Amazon 
M arketplace.
• When a business uses the Internet 
to supply consum ers w ith services, 
inform ation, or products, they are 
engaging in business-to-considiner 
(B2C) e-commerce. B2C is essentially 
the sam e as shopping at a physical 
store—you have a need or w ant, and 
the online m arketplace offers products 
and solutions. The prim ary difference 
is th at B2C e-commerce is not place- 
or time-specific.
The FTC pursues vigorous and effective 
law enforcement for consum ers and busi­
nesses (Figure 12.33).
Concept 12.27 Avoiding 
E-Commerce Hazards
Although there are m any benefits to en­
gaging in e-commerce, it also entails risks. 
These risks include identity theft, personal 
inform ation exposure, money loss, and 
being taken advantage of by unscrupulous 
retailers. To protect yourself, be sure to 
create user nam es and passw ords care­
fully, avoid doing e-commerce w ith little- 
known companies, and use caution when 
giving out your credit card inform ation— 
do so only on secure sites.

Objective 7 | Practice 
Appropriate Internet 
Behavior
In your job as Library A ssistant at a 
college, you have been asked to speak 
to student groups regarding proper eti­
quette in electronic com munications 
and social netw ork postings. W here do 
you start?
Concept 12.28 Practicing 
Netiquette
Courtesy is not required when using In­
tern et services but, as in the real world, it 
can create a difference in the im pression 
you m ake and contacts you keep.
N e tiq u e tte , short for Internet eti­
quette, is the code for acceptable behavior 
and m anners while on the Internet. The 
basic rule is this: talk to others the sam e 
way you would w ant them  to talk to you. 
Some more specific, useful rules of neti­
quette for e-mail, chat rooms, in stan t 
m essaging, and message boards include 
the following:
• Keep the message short.
• Avoid sarcasm  or the use of phrases 
or words th a t could offend the 
reader.
• Read the message before sending or 
posting it, correcting spelling and 
gram m ar m istakes.
• Do not type in all capital letters 
because th a t is interpreted as 
yelling.
• Do not assum e th a t everyone knows 
w hat IM acronyms such as BRB (be 
right back) and LOL (laughing out 
loud) mean.
• Avoid sending a fla m e—a m essage 
th a t expresses an opinion without 
holding back any emotion and th at 
m ay be seen as being confrontational 
and argum entative.
W hen you follow the rules of netiquette, 
you m ake a good im pression.
Concept 12.29 Insisting on 
Safe Surfing
There are ju st as many hazards online 
as there are in the real world. The added 
online elem ent is th at individuals are
difficult to recognize due to the anonym ity 
the Internet provides.
By taking some sim ple precautions, 
you can m ake your In tern et experience an 
enjoyable and safe activity. Follow these 
precautions:
• Never give out identifying 
inform ation.
• N ever respond to suggestive messages.
• Never open e-mail from an unknown 
source.
• Never allow a child to make arrange­
m ents for a face-to-face m eeting alone, 
for any reason, w ithout being accom­
panied by an adult.
• Rem em ber individuals online may not 
be who they seem.
• Set reasonable rules and guidelines for 
com puter use by children.
• Make using the com puter a family 
activity.
Additional online hazards to avoid include 
m alw are, identity theft, th reats to you 
and your family, and unscrupulous 
vendors.
Concept 12.30 Avoiding 
Malware
M alware refers to softw are program s 
designed to dam age a com puter system. 
Exam ples of m alw are events include 
deleting files on a hard drive, removing di­
rectory inform ation, gathering data from 
your system  such as Web sites you visited 
and account num bers or passw ords th at 
you typed. U nfortunately, there are indi­
viduals out there with m alicious intent— 
and you m ust be prepared. You can keep 
your system  free of m alw are by installing 
antivirus and antispyw are utilities on 
your com puter. These utility program s 
will seek and destroy the m alw are pro­
gram s they find on your com puter.
Concept 12.31 
Protecting 
Your Identity
More than half a million people find them ­
selves victims of identity theft each year. 
N othing is more fru stratin g  than having 
to spend the tim e and energy to clean up 
the mess created by a loss of identification.

PIN num bers you key in at ATMs. When 
shopping w ith an e-m erchant for the first 
time, look for the secure Web site features 
before entering any personal or credit 
card inform ation. These features usually 
include one or more of the following:
• https:// in the address of the site instead 
of the usual http://. The added s stands 
for secure site and means that the data 
is encrypted all the way from your com­
puter to the computer that receives it. No 
other computer will be able to read your 
input as it passes along the Internet.
• A site seal provided by a security ven­
dor, such as VeriSign, GeoTrust, or 
SSL.com.
• A locked padlock symbol somewhere 
on the Web site that, when double­
clicked, displays details of the site’s 
security. Be sure the logo is not ju st an 
im age and a fake.
• The logo from other site security enti­
ties, such as Verified by Visa.
• A message box that notifies you when 
you are leaving or entering a secure site.
In addition to these visible identifiers, 
investigate feedback provided by previous 
purchasers or any comments by the Better 
B usiness Bureau. You should shop only 
on Web sites th at enable you to view their 
privacy policy.
Concept 12.32 Protecting 
Children in Cyberspace
S tatistics support the growing use of 
social netw orks, chat rooms, and other 
forms of anonym ous comm unication by 
m inors. There are creative protections
to insulate youth from cyberstalkers, 
cyberbullies, and other online predators.
A couple in Fanwood, New Jersey, 
contacted CyberAngels at w w w . 
cyb eran gels.org, which is a volunteer 
organization of thousands of Internet 
users worldwide, after their computer- 
addicted 13-year-old daughter ran away 
from home. The group’s purpose is to pro­
tect children in cyberspace, and they used 
their netw ork to identify the child’s online 
contact and eventually located the child.
The In tern et can be dangerous for 
children of all ages. C yberbullying 
and cyberstalkers can targ et anyone.

Chapter Summary
The Internet and World Wide Web
• The Internet is the network of netw orks th at, 
because of its interoperability and use of TCP/IP 
transm ission protocol, enables connected com put­
ers to exchange data regardless of model, brand, or 
operating system.
• You access the Internet through an Internet access 
provider. Access providers fall into three catego­
ries: Internet service provider (ISP), online service 
provider, and wireless Internet service provider.
• You connect to an access provider by using a tele­
phone modem, a digital subscriber line (DSL), a 
cable modem, a satellite, or a fiber-optic cable.
• The World Wide Web is a global system  of billions 
of hypertext documents, called Web pages. These 
docum ents connect to each other through hyper­
links, use the Internet as a transport m echanism , 
are w ritten in HTML or XHTML, and are dis­
played by a browser.
• Inform ation on the Web can be located by entering 
the URL—Web address—in the address bar of the 
browser, by general surfing, by using searches with 
search operators to get more specific results, and 
using sites and technology th a t allow the sharing 
of inform ation w ith other Web users, such as RSS 
feeds, blogs, and wikis.
• Features of a reliable Web source include an 
author w ith credentials, the affiliation of the Web 
site w ith the host, the objectivity of the m aterial 
presented, the overall purpose of the site, and the 
accuracy and currency of the inform ation.
• Popular Internet services include e-mail and in­
stan t m essaging (IM) for sending m essages, In te r­
net relay chat (IRC) for text chatting, chat rooms, 
social netw orking sites for online com m unities, 
discussion groups, newsgroups, VoIP, m essage 
boards, and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for file 
exchange, and e-commerce.
• There are three types of e-commerce: business-to- 
business (B2B), consum er-to-consum er (C2C), and 
business-to-consum er (B2C).
• W hen using the Web, be courteous and respect the 
rules of netiquette.
• Follow safe surfing guidelines, avoid m alware, 
change your passwords frequently, never enter your 
account num ber unless you are on a secure site, 
w atch the computer usage of your children, and 
install software to protect your children from cyber­
stalkers, cyberbullies, and undesirable Web sites. 
W hen conducting online business, be aw are of secu­
rity indicators on Web sites conducting e-commerce, 
and perform transactions only w ith secure sites.

1. B lo g g in g  for B e g in n e r s Go to w w w .b lo g g e r , 
com /start and create a blog. Plan to add content 
every day for one week. E ach day record some in­
form ation about your classes and about your expe­
rience in using a blogging site, the features of the 
site th a t you like or do not like, and an evaluation 
of your experience. Invite some of your classm ates 
to participate in the blog. Your blog will be your re­
port, so make it detailed and professional. Provide 
your instructor with the blog address so he or she 
can follow the postings.
2. U sin g an A ggregator U se a search engine to lo­
cate free aggregators, and then select one to use in 
this exercise. Aggregator sites usually have catego­
ries like news or sports th a t contain several Web 
sites having RSS feeds. Select a category, and then 
view the individual subscriptions th a t are available. 
Use the Add option to subscribe to a feed, and in­
clude a few of your own preferred Web sites (ESPN, 
USA Today) with RSS feeds in the subscription list. 
When they appear, locate the manage subscription 
option and organize the ones you added by placing 
them  into existing categories or by creating a new 
separate category. Delete a few of the ones th a t are 
in the category you chose. Investigate some of the 
other features of th e aggregator. T here is usually
an option to retu rn  to a hom e page, some way to 
track your reading trends, and even a way to share 
your reader w ith others. A fter using the program 
for several days, review your experience. In a one- 
page, double-spaced paper, describe the aggregator 
site you chose and explain why you chose that site. 
Also discuss how easy or difficult th e site was to 
use, the num ber of feeds you received, and whether 
or not you would use such a program . Include any 
other observations and bits of advice for another 
user. Remember to cite your references.

Ethics and Social Networks
1. In te r n e t E th ic s Using a search engine, identify at 
least two Web sites that facilitate music downloads. 
Review th eir policy, legal statem en ts, and agree­
m ents. Who is liable if the sharing done on their site 
is found to be illegal? Are there any fees to subscribe 
to or use the site? In w hat country is the site being 
hosted? A ttem pt to locate statistics on the num ber 
of m usic downloads and the loss of revenue to the 
music and related industries related to downloading 
m usic files. In a Pow erPoint presentation, review 
your findings for these and other related issues you 
discover in your research. Suggest two viable solu­
tions th a t you see as a compromise to this ongoing 
controversy. Remember to cite your references.
2. S o cial N e tw o rk s W ith business using social n et­
w orks as an inexpensive m ethod of a d v ertisin g , 
some prom otional techniques have been very suc­
cessful and some a total flop. U sing th e In te rn e t 
and a search engine, locate a t least th ree business 
Facebook sites th at have successfully used th is so­
cial netw ork for advertising or to have custom ers 
successfully interact w ith th eir product. T hen lo­
cate at least three business Facebook sites w hose 
strateg y  failed. In a slide show of seven slides or 
more, state the nam e of the business, describe the 
type of cam paign they developed, and point out the 
reasons for success or failure. R em em ber to cite 
your references.

Job Focus: Database 
Technician for a College
In This Chapter
In this chapter, you will learn how a Database Technician at a college uses Microsoft 
Access 2010 to assist students and faculty in organizing related information. Access 
is a powerful program that enables you to organize, search, sort, retrieve, and present 
information in a professional-looking manner. You will create new databases, enter data 
into Access tables, and create a query, form, and report—all of which are Access objects 
that make a database useful. You will also sort Access database tables and create and 
modify queries. To convert data into meaningful information, you m ust manipulate your 
data in a way that you can answer questions. One question might be: Which students have 
a grade point average oj 3.0 or higher? With such information, you could send information 
about scholarships or internships to selected students.
At the end of this Unit, following Chapter 14, you will have an opportunity to 
complete a case project that focuses on the career of a Library Assistant at a college.

Objective 1 | Identify Good Database Design
A database is an organized collection o f data—facts about people, events, things, or 
ideas—related to a specific topic or purpose. Inform ation is data that is organized in a 
useful m anner. Your personal address book is a type of database, because it is a collection 
ol data about one topic—the people with whom you com m unicate. A sim ple database of 
this type is called a Jlat database because it is not related or linked to any other collection 
of data. A nother exam ple of a sim ple database is a list of movie DVDs. You do not keep 
inform ation about your DVDs in your address book because the data is not related to your addresses.
A m ore sophisticated type ot database is a relational database, because m ultiple collections o f data in the 
database are related to one another; for example, data about the students, the courses, and the faculty members 
at a college. M icrosoft Access 2 0 10 is a relational database management system—also referred to as a DBMS— 
which is software that controls how related collections of data are stored, organized, retrieved, and secured.
Activity 13.01 
Using Good Design Techniques to Plan a Database
The first step in creating a new database is to determ ine the inform ation you want to keep track of, and then 
ask yourself, What questions should this database be able to answer for me? The purpose o f a database is to store 
the data in a m anner that m akes it easy for you to get the inform ation you need by asking questions. For example, 
in the Contacts database for Capital Cities C om m unity College, the questions to be answ ered m ight include:
How m any students are enrolled at Capital Cities C om m unity College?
How many faculty m em bers teach in the A ccounting Departm ent?
W hich and how m any students live in A rlington, Virginia?
W hich and how m any students have a balance owed?
W hich and how m any students are m ajoring in Inform ation Systems Technology?
Tables are the foundation o f an Access database because all of the data is stored in one or m ore tables. A table 
is similar in structure to an Excel worksheet; that is, data is organized into rows and colum ns. Each table row is a 
record—all of the categories of data pertaining to one person, place, thing, event, or idea. Each table colum n is a 
field —a single piece of inform ation for every record. For example, in a table storing student contact inform ation, 
each row form s a record for only one student. Each colum n form s a field for a single piece of inform ation for 
every record; for example, the student ID num ber for all students.
W hen organizing the fields of inform ation in your database, break each piece of inform ation into its smallest 
useful part. For example, create three fields for the nam e of a student—one field for the last nam e, one field for the 
first nam e, and one field for the m iddle nam e or initial.
The Jlrst principle o f good database design is to organize data in the tables so that redundant—duplicate—data 
does not occur. For example, record the contact information for students in only one table, because if the address for a 
student changes, the change can be m ade in just one place. This conserves space, reduces the likelihood of errors when 
recording the new data, and does not require rem em bering all of the different places where the address is stored.
Ihe second principle o f good database design is to use techniques that ensure the accuracy of data when 
it is entered into the table. Typically, m any different people enter data into a database—think of all the people 
who enter data at your college. W hen entering a state in a contacts database, one person m ight enter the state 
as Virginia and another m ight enter the state as VA. Use design techniques to help those who enter data into a 
database do so in a consistent and accurate m anner.
Normalization is the process o f applying design rules and principles to ensure that your database perform s 
as expected. Taking the tim e to plan and create a database that is well designed will ensure that you can retrieve 
m eaningful inform ation from  the database.
I he tables of inform ation in a relational database are linked or joined to one another by a common field—a 
tield in one or m ore tables that stores the same data. For example, the Student C ontacts table includes the Student 
ID, nam e, and address o f every student. The Student Activities table includes the nam e of each club, and the 
Student ID—but not the nam e or address—ot each student in each club. Because the two tables share a com m on 
field—Student ID —you can create a list of nam es and addresses of all the students in the Photography Club.

Objective 2 | Create a Table and Define Fields in a 
New Database
There are two m ethods to create a new Access database: create a new database using 
a database template—a preform atted database designed for a specific purpose—or create 
a new database from  a blank database. A blank database has no data and has no database 
tools; you create the data and the tools as you need them . Regardless of the m ethod you use, 
you m ust nam e and save the database before you can create any objects in it. Objects are the 
basic parts of a database; you create objects to store your data and to work with your data.
The m ost com m on database objects are tables, forms, and reports. T hink of an Access 
database as a container for the objects that you will create.

Activity 13.03
Assigning the Data Type and Name to Fields
After you have saved and nam ed your database, the next step is to consult your database plan, and then create 
the tables in which to enter your data. Limit the data in each table to one subject. For example, in this project, 
your database will have two tables—one for student contact inform ation and one for faculty contact inform ation. 
Recall that each colum n in a table is a field and that field nam es display at the top of each colum n. Recall also that 
each row in a table is a record—all of the data pertaining to one person, place, thing, event, or idea. Each record is 
broken up into its smallest usable parts—the fields. Use m eaningful nam es lo nam e fields; for exam ple, Last Name.

N otice the new blank table that displays in Datasheet view, and then take a m om ent to study the elem ents of 
the table’s object window. C om pare your screen with Figure 13.7.
The table displays in Datasheet view, which displays the data as columns and rows similar to the format of an Excel 
worksheet. Another way to view a table is in Design view, which displays the underlying design—the structure— of 
the table’s fields. The object window displays the open object—in this instance, the table object.
In a new blank database, there is only one object—a new blank table. Because you have not yet named this table, the 
object tab displays a default name of Table 1. Access creates the first field and names it ID. In the ID field. Access 
assigns a unique sequential number—each number incremented by one—to each record as it is entered into the table.

screen with Figure 13.8.
Data type is the characteristic that defines the kind of data that you can type in a field, such as numbers, text, or 
dates. A field in a table can have only one data type. Part of your database design should include deciding on the data 
type of each field. After you have selected the data type, you can name the field.

Using the technique you just practiced, create the rem aining fields as follows by first selecting the data type, 
then typing the field nam e, and then pressing (Enterl. The field nam es in the table will display on one line.
The ZIP/Postal Code field is assigned a data type of Text because the number is never used in a calculation. The 
Amount Owed field is assigned a data type of Currency; the Currency data type describes monetary values. Access 
automatically adds a U.S. dollar sign ($) and two decimal places to all of the numbers in the fields with a data type of

Renaming Fields and Changing Data Types in a Table
Click anyw here in the text ID. O n the Fields tab, in the Properties group, click the Name & Caption button. In 
the Enter Field Properties dialog box, in the Name box, change ID to Student ID and then click OK.
The field name Student ID is a better description of the data in this field. In the Enter Field Properties dialog box, 
the Caption property is used to display a name for a field other than that listed as the field name. Many database 
designers do not use spaces in field names; instead, they might name a field I.astName—with no spaces—and then 
create a caption for that field so it displays with spaces in tables, forms, and reports. In the Enter Field Properties 
dialog box, you can also provide a description for the field.
In the Formatting group, notice that the Data Type tor the Student ID field is AutoNumber. Click the Data Type 
arrow, click Text, and then com pare your screen with Figure 13.10.
In the new record row, the Student ID field is selected. By default, Access creates an ID field for all new tables and 
sets the data type for the field to AutoNumber. The AutoNumber data type describes a unique sequential or random 
number assigned by Access as each record is entered. By changing the data type of this field from AutoNumber to 
Text, you can enter a custom student ID number. When records in a database have no unique value, for example the 
names in your address book, the AutoNumber data type is a useful way to automatically create a unique number so 
that you have a way to ensure that every record is different from the others.

Activity 13.07 
Importing Data from an Excel Workbook into an Existing Access Table
W hen you create a database table, you can type the records directly into a table. You can also im port data 
from  a variety of sources. Im porting is the process of copying data from  one source or application to another 
application. For example, you can im port data from a W ord table or an Excel w orksheet into an Access database 
because the data is arranged in colum ns and rows, sim ilar to a table in D atasheet view. In this activity, you will 
append—add o n —data from an Excel spreadsheet to your 13A Students table. To append data, the table m ust 
already be created, and it m ust be closed.
1 
In the upper right corner o f the table, below the Ribbon, click the Object Close 0
 button to close your 13A 
Students table. Notice that no objects are open.

the records to an existing table, or link the data from Excel to a linked table. A link is a connection to data in another 
file. When linking, Access creates a table that maintains a link to the source data.

Currently your database has only one table, so no other tables display on the list. However, when a database has 
multiple tables, here you can select the table to which you want to append records. The table into which you import

Objective 3 | Change the Structure of Tables and 
Add a Second Table
Recall that the structure of a table is the underlying design, including field nam es 
and data types. You can create a table or m odify a table in D atasheet view. To define and 
m odify fields, m any database experts prefer to w ork in Design view, w here you have m any 
additional options for defining the fields in a table.

Activity 13.08 
Deleting a Table Field in Design View
In this activity, you will delete the Middle Initial field from  the table.
1 
Click the Home tab, and then in the Views group, click the View button arrow.
There are four common views in Access, but two that you will use often are Datasheet view and Design view. On the 
displayed list, Design view is represented by a picture of a pencil, a ruler, and an angle. When one of these four icons 
is displayed on the View button, clicking the View button will display the table in the view represented by the icon. 
Datasheet view displays the table data in rows and columns.
2  O n the list, click Design View, and then com pare your screen with Figure 13 .18.
Design view displays the underlying design—the structure—of the table and its fields. In Design view, you cannot 
view the data; you can view only the information about each field’s characteristics. Each field name is listed, along 
with its data type. A column to add a Description—information about the data in the field—is provided.
In the Field Properties area, you can make additional decisions about how each individual field looks and behaves. 
For example, you can set a specific field size.

3  In the Field Name colum n, to the left of Middle Initial, point to the row selector box to display the 0
 pointer, 
and then click one tim e to select the entire row.
4 
On the Design tab, in the Tools group, click the Delete Rows button, read the message in the message box, and 
then click Yes.
Deleting a field deletes both the field and its data; you cannot undo this action. Thus, Access prompts you to be sure 
you want to proceed. Ifyou change your mind after deleting a field, you must add the field back into the table and 
then re-enter the data in that field for every record.
Activity 13.09 
Modifying a Field Size and Adding a Description
Typically, m any individuals enter data into a table. For example, at your college m any Registration Assistants 
enter and m odify student and course inform ation daily. Two ways to help reduce errors are to restrict w hat can be 
typed in a field and to add descriptive inform ation.

In the low er portion of the screen, under Field Properties, click Field Size to select the text 255, type 2 and then 
com pare your screen with Figure 13.19.
Field properties control how the field displays and how data can be entered in the field. This action limits the size 
of the State/Region field to no more than two characters—the size of the two-letter state abbreviations provided 
by the United States Postal Service. However, this does not prevent someone from entering two characters that are 
incorrect. Setting the proper data type for the field and limiting the field size are two ways to help to reduce errors.

In the State/Region row, click in the Description box, type Two-character state abbreviation and then press (Enter].
Descriptions for fields in a table are optional. Include a description if the field name does not provide an obvious 
explanation of the field. Information typed in the description area displays on the left side of the status bar in 
Datasheet view when the field is active, providing additional information to individuals who are entering data.
4  
Click in the Student ID field nam e box. Using the technique you practiced, in the Field Properties area, change 
the Field Size to 7
By limiting the field size to seven characters, which is the maximum number of characters in a Student ID, you help 
to ensure the accuracy of the data.
5  
In the Student ID row, click in the Description box, and then type Seven-digit Student ID number

Click in the Faculty Advisor ID field nam e box. In the Field Properties area, change the Field Size to 8 In the

7  
O n the Q uick Access Toolbar, click the Save button |td] to save the design changes to your table, and then 
notice the message.
The message indicates that the field size property of one or more fields has changed to a shorter size. If more characters 
are currently present in the Student ID, State/Region, or Faculty Advisor ID than you have allowed, the data could be 
truncated—cut off or shortened—because the fields were not previously restricted to a specific number of characters.
8  
In the message box, click Yes.
Activity 13.10 
Viewing a Primary Key in Design View
Primary key refers to the field in the table that uniquely identifies a record. For example, in a college 
registration database, your Student ID num ber uniquely identifies you— no other student at the college has your 
exact student num ber. In the 13A Students table, the Student ID uniquely identifies each student.
Project 13A: Contact Information Database with Two Tables I (JO! All In One 
599

W hen you create a table using the Blank database com m and, by default Access designates the first field as the 
prim ary key field. It is a good database design practice to establish a prim ary key for every table, because doing so 
ensures that you do not enter the sam e record m ore than once.
1 
W ith your table still displayed in Design view, in the Field Name colum n, click in the Student ID box. To the 
left of the box, notice the small icon o f a key, as shown in Figure 13.20.
Access automatically designates the first field as the primary key field, but you can set any field as the primary key by 
clicking in the box to the left of the field name, and then clicking the Primary Key button.

Adding a Second Table to a Database by Importing an Excel Spreadsheet
Many M icrosoft Office users track data in an Excel spreadsheet. The sorting and filtering capabilities of Excel 
are useful for a sim ple database w here all the inform ation resides in one large Excel spreadsheet. However, Excel is 
limited as a database m anagem ent tool because it cannot relate the inform ation in m ultiple spreadsheets in a way 
in which you could ask a question and get a meaningful result. Data in an Excel spreadsheet can easily become 
an Access table by im porting the spreadsheet, because Excel’s form at of colum ns and rows is sim ilar to that of an 
Access table.

O n the Ribbon, click the External Data tab, and then in the Import & Link group, click the Excel button. In the 
Get External Data -  Excel Spreadsheet dialog box, to the right of the File name box, click Browse.

Activity 13.12 
Adjusting Column Widths
By using techniques sim ilar to those you use for Excel worksheets, you can adjust the w idths o f Access fields 
that display in Datasheet view.
In the object window, click the object lab for your I3A Students table.
All ot the columns are the same width regardless of the amount of data in the field, the field size that was set, or the 
length of the field name. If you print the table as currently displayed, some of the data or field names will not fully 
print until you adjust the column widths.
In the field nam es row, poin t to the right edge of the Address field to display the pointer jEL and then 
com pare your screen with Figure 13.24.

The column width of the Address field widens to fully display the longest entry in the field. In this manner, the width
ol a column can be increased or decreased to fit its contents in the same manner as a column in an Excel worksheet. 
In Access this is referred to as Best Fit.
Point to the Phone Number field nam e to display the 0
 pointer, right-click to select the entire colum n and 
display a shortcut m enu, and then click Field Width. In the Column Width dialog box, click Best Fit.
Scroll to the right until the last three fields display. Point to the E-mail field nam e to display the) 4 ] pointer, 
hold down the left m ouse button, and then drag to the right to select this colum n, the Faculty Advisor ID 
colum n, and the Amount Owed colum n. By double-clicking the 0
 pointer on the right boundary of any of 
the selected colum ns, or by displaying the Field W idth dialog box from  the shortcut m enu, apply Best Fit to 
the selected colum ns.
Scroll all the way to the left to view the Student ID field. To the left o f the Student ID field nam e, click the 
Select All button O . Click the Home tab, and in the Records group, click the More button. Click Field Width, 
and in the Column W idth dialog box, click Best Fit. In the first record, scroll to the right as necessary, click in 
the Amount Owed field, and then com pare your screen with Figure 13.25.
In this manner, you can adjust all of the column widths at one time. After applying Best Fit, be sure to click in any 
field to remove the selection from all of the records; otherwise, the layout changes will not be saved with the table. 
Adjusting the width of columns does not change the data in the table’s records; it changes only the display oi [he data.

Note | H eaders and Footers in Access O bjects
The headers and footers in Access tables and queries are controlled by default settings; you cannot add additional information or edit the infor­
mation. The object name displays in the center ot the header area with the date on the right— that is why adding your own name to the object 
name is helpful to identify your paper or electronic results. The page number displays in the center of the footer area. The headers and footers in 
Access reports and forms, however, are more flexible; you can add to and edit the information.

Objective 4 I Create and Use a Query, Form, and
Report
A query is a database object that retrieves specific data from  one or m ore database 
objects—either tables or other queries—and then, in a single datasheet, displays only the 
data that you specify. Because the word query m eans to ask a question, think o f a query as 
a question form ed in a m anner that Access can answer.
A form  is an Access object with which you can enter data, edit data, or display data 
from  a table or a query. In a form , the fields are laid out in an attractive form at on the screen, which m akes 
w orking with the database easier for those who m ust enter and look up data.
A report is a database object that displays the fields and records from  a table or a query in an easy-to-read 
form at suitable for printing. Create reports to summarize inform ation in a database in a professional-looking 
m anner.

Activity 13.14 
Using the Simple Query Wizard to Create a Query
A select query is one type of Access query. A select query, also called a simple select query, retrieves (selects) 
data from  one or m ore tables or queries and then displays the selected data in a datasheet. A select query creates 
subsets otdata to answer specific questions; for example, Which students live in Arlington, VA?
I 
he objects from  which a query selects its data are referred to as the query’s data source. In this activity, you 
will create a sim ple select query using a wizard. A wizard is a feature in M icrosoft Office program s that walks you 
step by step through a process. The process involves choosing the data source, and then indicating the fields you 
w ant to include in the query result. The query—the question that you w ant to ask—is W hat is the name, complete 
mailing address, and Student ID of every student?
1 
( .lick the Create tab, and then in the Queries group, click the Query Wizard button. In the New Query dialog 
box, click Simple Query Wizard, and then click OK. C om pare your screen with Figure 13.30.

Click the Tables/Queries arrow, and then click your Table: 13A Students.
To create a query, first choose the data source—the object from which to select data. The name and complete 
mailing address of every student is stored in the 13A Students table, so this table will be your data source.
3 
U nder Available Fields, click Student ID, and then click the Add Field button [ > 1 to m ove the field to the 
Selected Fields list on the right. Point to the Last Name field, and then double-click to add the field to the 
Selected Fields list.
Use either method to add fields to the Selected Fields list. Fields can be added in any order.
4 
By using the Add Field button I > J  or by double-clicking the field nam e, add the following fields to the 
Selected Fields list: First Name, Address, City, State/Region, and ZIP/Postal Code. C om pare your screen with 
Figure 13.31.
Choosing these seven fields will answer the question, Wlmt is the Student ID, name, and address of every student?
606 
GO! All In One | Chapter 13: Create, Query, and Sort an Access Database; Create Forms and Reports

5  
Click Next. In the Simple Query Wizard dialog box, click in the What title do you want for your query? box. 
Edit as necessary so that the query nam e, using your own last and first nam e, is Lastname Firstname 13A All 
Students Query and then com pare your screen with Figure 13.32.
6  
Click Finish.
Access runs the query—performs the actions indicated in your query design by searching the records in the data 
source you selected, and then finding the records that match specified criteria. The records that match the criteria 
display in a datasheet. A select query selects—pulls out and displays—only the information from the data source 
that you requested, including the specified fields. In the object window, Access displays every student record in 
Datasheet view, but displays only the seven fields that you moved to the Selected Fields list in the Simple Query 
Wizard dialog box.
7  
If necessary, apply Best Fit to the colum ns and then Save the query. Display the query in Print Preview. 
C hange the Orientation to Landscape, and then create a paper or electronic printout as instructed. Close the 
Print Preview.
8  
In the object window, click the Close Object button 0
 to close the query.
Activity 13.15 
Creating and Printing a Form
O ne type o f Access form  displays only one record in the database at a time. Such a form  is useful not only to 
the individual who perform s the data entry—typing in the actual records—but also to anyone w ho has the job of 
viewing inform ation in a database. For the viewer, it is much easier to look at one record at a tim e, using a form , 
than to look at all of the student records in the database table.
The Form  com m and on the Ribbon creates a form  that displays all o f the fields from the underlying data 
source (table)—one record at a time. You can use this new form  im m ediately, or you can m odify it. Records that 
you create or edit in a form  are autom atically added lo or updated in the underlying table or tables.

Open [»] the Navigation Pane. Increase the w idth ot the Navigation Pane so that all object nam es display fully. 
Notice that a table displays a datasheet icon, and a query displays an icon of two overlapping datasheets.

Objective 7 | Create Table Relationships
Access databases are relational databases because the tables in the database can
relate—actually connect—to other tables through com m on fields. After you have a
table for each subject in your database, you must provide a way to connect the data in

related tables, and then define table relationships. A relationship is an association that you 
or jn MylTIab
establish between two tables based on com m on fields. After the relationship is established,
you can create a query, a form , or a report that displays inform ation from  m ore than one table.
Activity 13.20 
Creating Table Relationships and Enforcing Referential Integrity
In this activity, you will create a relationship between two tables in the database.
1 
Double-click your 13B Instructors table to open it in the object w indow  and exam ine its contents. Then open 
your 13B Schedule table and exam ine its contents.
In the 13B Instructors table, no two instructors have the same Instructor ID since Instructor ID is the primary 
key field. In the 13B Schedule table, Schedule ID is the primary key field. Every scheduled course section during 
an academic term has a unique Schedule ID. The 13B Schedule table includes the Instructor ID field, which is the 
common field between the two tables.
2 
In the I3B Schedule table, scroll to the right to display the Instructor ID field, and then com pare your screen 
with Figure 13.40.
Because one instructor can teach many different courses, one Instructor ID number can be present many times 
in the 13B Schedule table. This relationship between each instructor and the courses is known as a one-to-many 
relationship. This is the most common type of relationship in Access.

Point to the title bar of the Show Tabic dialog box, and then drag dow n and to the right slightly to m ove the 
Show Table dialog box away from  the top of the Relationships window.
Moving the Show Table dialog box enables you to see the tables as they are added to the Relationships window.
In the Show Table dialog box, click your 13B Instructors table, and then at the bottom  of the dialog box, click 
Add. In the Show Table dialog box, double-click your 13B Schedule table to add the table to the R elationships 
w indow . In the Show Table dialog box, click Close, and then com pare your screen with Figure 13.42.
You can use either technique to add a table to the Relationships window. A Jleltl list—a list of the field names in a 
table—for each of the two table objects displays, and each table’s primary key is identified. Although this database 
currently has only two tables, larger databases can have many tables. Scroll bars in a field list indicate that there are 
fields that are not currently in view.

Ifyou double-click a table more than one time, a duplicate field list displays in the Relationships window. To remove a Held list from the Rela­
tionships window, right-click the title bar of the field list, and then click Hide Table. Alternatively, click anywhere in the field list, and then on 
the Design tab, in the Relationships group, click the Hide Table button.
6  
In the 13B Schedule field list—the field list on the right—point to the title bar to display the [§] pointer. Drag 
the field list to the right until there is about 2 inches between the field lists.
7  
In the 13B Instructors field list—the field list on the left—point to the lower right corner o f the field list to 
display the H  pointer, and then drag dow n and to the right to increase the height and w idth of the field list 
until the entire nam e of the table in the title bar displays and all of the field nam es display.
This action enables you to see all of the available fields and removes the vertical scroll bar.

Note | The Field That Is Highlighted Does Not Matter
Alter you rearrange the two field lists in the Relationships window, the highlighted field indicates the active field list, which is the list you moved 
last. This is of no consequence for completing the activity.
9  
In the 13B Instructors field list, point to Instructor ID, hold down the left m ouse button, and then drag down 
and to the right into the 13B Schedule field list until the 
pointer’s arrow  is on top of Instructor ID. Then 
release the m ouse button to display the Edit Relationships dialog box.
As you drag, a small graphic displays to indicate that you are dragging a field from one field list to another. A table 
relationship works by matching data in two fields—the common field. In these two tables, the common field has the 
same name—Instructor ID. Common fields are not required to have the same names; however, they must have the 
same data type and field size.
1 0  Point to the title bar o f the Edit Relationships dialog box, and then drag the dialog box below the two field lists 
as shown in Figure 13.44.
Both tables include the Instructor ID field—the common field between the two tables. By dragging, you create the 
one-to-many relationship. In the 13B Instructors table, Instructor ID is the primary key. In the 13B Schedule table, 
Instructor ID is referred to as the foreign key field. The foreign key is the field in the related table used to connect to 
the primary key in another table. The field on the one side of the relationship is typically the primary key.
11 In the Edit Relationships dialog box, click to select the Enforce Referential Integrity check box.
Referential integrity is a set ot rules that Access uses to ensure that the data between related tables is valid. Enforcing 
referential integrity ensures that an instructor cannot be added to the 13B Schedules table if the Instructor ID is not 
included in the 13B Instructors table. Similarly, enforcing referential integrity ensures that you cannot delete an 
instructor from the 13B Instructors table il there is a course listed in the 13B Schedule table for that instructor.

A join line—the line joining two tables—displays between the two tables. On the join line, 1 indicates the one side of 
the relationship, and the infinity symbol (°°) indicates the many side of the relationship. These symbols display when 
referential integrity is enforced.

Activity 13.21 
Printing a Relationship Report and Displaying Subdatasheet 
Records
The Relationships window provides a m ap of how your database tables are related, and you can print this 
inform ation as a report.
1 
W ith the Relationships window open, on the Design tab, in the Tools group, click the Relationship Report
button to create the report and display it in Print Preview.
2  On the Print Preview tab, in the Page Size group, click the Margins button, and then click Normal. If instructed 
to do so, create a paper or electronic printout of this relationship report.
3  
On the Quick Access Toolbar, click the Save button 0
 to save the report. In the Save As dialog box, click OK to 
accept the default name.
The report name displays in the Navigation Pane under Unrelated Objects. Because the report is just a map of the 
relationships, and not a report containing actual records, it is not associated with any of the tables.
4  
In the object window, Close [ 3  the report, and then Close [* ] the Relationships window.
5  
From the Navigation Pane, open your 13B Instructors table, and then Close [ji| the Navigation Pane. For the
first record—Instructor ID 1224567—on the left side of the record, click the plus sign (+), and then com pare 
your screen with Figure 13.46.
Plus signs to the left of a record in a table indicate that related records exist in another table. Clicking the plus 
sign displays the related records in a subdatasheet. In the first record, lor Deborah Fresch, you can see that related 
records exist in the 13B Schedule table—she is teaching five LGL courses that are listed in the schedule. The plus sign 
displays because you created a relationship between the two tables using the Instructor ID field—the common field.

Objective 8 | Sort Records in a Table
Sorting is the process of arranging data in a specific order based on the value in a field.
For example, you can sort the names in your address book alphabetically by each person’s 
last name, or you can sort your DVD collection by the date of purchase. Initially, records 
in an Access table display in the order they are entered into the table. When a primary key 
is established, the records display in order based on the primary key field.
Activity 13.22 
Sorting Records in a Table in Ascending or Descending Order
In the following activity, you will determine the departments of the faculty in the Business and Information 
Technology Division by sorting the data. You can sort data in either ascending order or descending order. 
Ascending order sorts text alphabetically (A to Z) and sorts numbers from the lowest number to the highest 
number. Descending order sorts text in reverse alphabetical order (Z to A) and sorts numbers from the highest 
number to the lowest number.
1 Notice that the records in the 13B Instructors table are sorted in ascending order by Instructor ID, which is 
the primary key field.
2 In the field names row, click the Department arrow, click Sort A to Z, and then compare your screen with 
Figure 13.47.
To sort records in a table, click the arrow to the right of the field name in the column on which you want to sort, 
and then choose the sort order. After a field is sorted, a small arrow in the field name box indicates its sort order. 
The small arrow in the field name points up, indicating an ascending sort; and in the Ribbon, on the Home tab, the 
Ascending button is selected.
The records display in alphabetical order by Department. Because the department names are now grouped 
together, you can quickly scroll the length of the table to see the instructors in each department. The first record 
in the table has no data in the Department field because the Instructor ID number 9999999 is reserved for Staff, a 
designation that is used until a scheduled course has been assigned to a specific instructor.

Activity 13.23 
Sorting Records in a Table on Multiple Fields
To sort a table on two or more fields, first identify the fields that will act as the outermost sort field  and the 
innermost sort field. The outermost sort field is the first level of sorting, and the innermost sort field is the second 
level of sorting. For example, you might want to sort first by the Last Name field, which would be the outermost 
sort field, and then by the First Name field, which would be the innermost sort field. After you identify your 
outermost and innermost sort fields, sort the innermost field first, and then sort the outermost field.
In this activity, you will sort the records in descending order by the department name. Within each 
department name, you will sort the records in ascending order by last name.
1 
In the Last Name field, click any record. In the Sort & Filter group, click the Ascending button.
The records are sorted in ascending alphabetical order hy Last Name—the innermost sort field.
2 Point anywhere in the Department field, and then right-click. From the shortcut menu, click Sort Z to A. 
Compare your screen with Figure 13.48.
The records are sorted in descending alphabetical order first by Department—the outermost sort field—and then 
within a specific Department grouping, the sort continues in ascending alphabetical order by Last Name—the 
innermost sort field. The records are sorted on multiple fields using both ascending and descending order.

3 Display Backstage view, click Print, and then click Print Preview. In the Page Layout group, click the Landscape 
button. In the Zoom group, click the Two Pages button, and notice that the table will print on two pages.
4 On the Print Preview tab, in the Print group, click the Print button. Under Print Range, click the Pages option 
button. In the From box, type 1 and then in the To box, type 1 to print only the first page. If directed to submit 
a paper copy, click OK or create an electronic copy as instructed. To create a PDF of only the first page, in the 
Data group, click PDF or XPS, click the Options button, and then indicate Page 1 to 1. In the Close Preview 
group, click the Close Print Preview button.
5 In the object window, Close Q*] the table. In the message box, click Yes to save the changes to the sort order.
6 
Open 0  the Navigation Pane, and then open the 13B Instructors table. Notice the table was saved with the sort 
order you specified.
7 
In the Sort & Filter group, click the Remove Sort button. Close 0  the table, and in the message box, click Yes 
to save the table with the sort removed. Close [«] the Navigation Pane.
Generally, tables are not stored with the data sorted. Instead, queries are created that sort the data; and then reports 
are created to display the sorted data.
Objective 9 | Create a Query in Design View
Recall that a select query is a database object that retrieves (selects) specific data from 
one or more tables and then displays the specified data in Datasheet view. A query answers 
a question such as Which instructors teach courses in the 1ST department? Unless a query 
yjew t|lc vjtieo on the 
has already been set up to ask this question, you must create a new query. A query is useful 
Companion WebSite 
because it creates a subset of records—a portion of the total records—according to your 
or in MylTLab 
specifications and then displays only those records.
Activity 13.24 
Creating a New Select Query in Design View
Previously, you created a query using the Query Wizard. To create complex queries, use Query Design view. 
Recall that the table or tables from which a query selects its data is referred to as the data source.
1 On the Ribbon, click the Create tab, and then in the Queries group, click the Query Design button. Compare 
your screen with Figure 13.49.
A new query opens in Design view and the Show Table dialog box displays, which lists both tables in the database.

2 In the Show Table dialog box, double-click 13B Instructors, and then Close the Show Table dialog box.
A field list for the 13B Instructors table displays in the upper area of the Query window. The Instructor ID field is the 
primary key field in this table. The Query window has two parts: the table area (upper area), which displays the field 
lists for tables that are used in the query, and the design grid (lower area), which displays the design of the query.
| Is There More Than One Field List in the Query Window?
Ifyou double-click a table more than one time, a duplicate field list displays in the Query window. To remove a field list from the Query 
window, right-click the title bar of the field list, and then click Remove Table.
Point to the lower right corner of the field list to display the [\| pointer, and then drag down and to the right 
to expand the field list, displaying all of the field names and the table name. In the 13B Instructors field list, 
double-click Rank, and then look at the design grid.
The Rank field name displays in the design grid in the Field row. You limit the fields that display when the query is 
run by placing only the desired field names in the design grid.
In the 13B Instructors field list, point to First Name, hold down the left mouse button, and then drag down 
into the design grid until the 
pointer displays in the Field row in the second column. Compare your screen 
with Figure 13.50.
This is a second way to add field names to the design grid.

5 In design grid, in the Field row, click in the third column, and then click the arrow that displays. From the list, 
click Last Name to add the field to the design grid, which is a third way to add a field to the design grid.
6 Using one of the techniques you just practiced, add the Office Phone field to the fourth column and the 
Department field to the fifth column in the design grid.
Activity 13.25 
Running, Saving, Printing, and Closing a Query
Recall that after you create a query, you run it to display the results. When you run a query, Access looks 
at the records in the table (or tables) you have included in the query, finds the records that match the specified 
conditions (if any), and displays only those records in a datasheet. Only the fields that you have added to the 
design grid display in the query results. 'I he query always runs using the current table or tables, presenting the 
most up-to-date information.
1 
On the Design tab, in the Results group, click the Run button, and then compare your screen with Figure 13.51.
This query answers the question, What is the Rank, First Name, Last Nunie, Office Phone number, nnd Department 
of all of the instructors in the 13B Instructors table? The five fields that you specified in the design grid display in 
columns, and the records from the 13B Instructors table display in rows.

2 On the Quick Access Toolbar, click the Save button 
In the Save As dialog box, type Lastname Firstname 13B 
Instructors Query and then click OK.
Save your queries il you are likely to ask the same question again; doing so will save you the effort of creating the 
query again to answer the same question.
3 Display Backstage view, click Print, and then click Print Preview. Create a paper or electronic printout if 
instructed to do so, and then Close Print Preview.
4 
Close 0  the query. Open 0  the Navigation Pane, and then notice that the 13B Instructors Query object 
displays under the 13B Instructors table object.
The new query name displays in the Navigation Fane under the table with which it is related—the 13B Instructors 
table. Only the design of the query is saved. The records still reside in the table object. Each time you open the query, 
Access runs it again and displays the results based on the current data stored in the related table(s).
Objective 10 | Create a New Query from an Existing 
Query
You can create a new query from scratch or you can open an existing query, save 
it with new name, and modify the design to suit your needs. Using an existing query 
saves you time if your new query uses all or some of the same fields and conditions in an 
existing query.
View the video on the 
Companion Web Site 
or in MylTLab
Activity 13.26 
Creating a New Query from an Existing Query
1 
From the Navigation Pane, open your 13B Instructors Query by either double-clicking the name or by right- 
clicking and clicking Open.
The query runs, opens in Datasheet view, and displays the records from the 13B Instructors table as specified in the 
query design grid.
2 Display Backstage view, and then click Save Object As. In the Save As dialog box, type Lastname Firstname 13B 
Instructor IDs Query and then click OK. Click the Home tab, and then in the Views group, click the View button 
to switch to Design view.
A new query, based on a copy ot the 13B Instructors Query, is created and displays in the object window and in the 
Navigation Pane under its data source—the 13B Instructors table.
3 
Close |ji| the Navigation Pane. In the design grid, point to the thin gray selection bar above the Office Phone
field name until the | * | pointer displays. Click to select the Office Phone column, and then press iDeletel.
This action deletes the field from the query design only—it has no effect on the field in the underlying 13B 
Instructors table. 'I he Department field moves to the left. Similarly, you can select multiple fields and delete them 
at one time.

4 From the gray selection bar, select the First Name column. In the selected column, point to the selection bar to 
display th e ®  pointer, and then drag to the right until a dark vertical line displays on the right side of the Last 
Name column. Release the mouse button to position the First Name field in the third column.
To rearrange fields in the query design, select the field to move, and then drag it to a new position in the design grid.
5  Using the technique you just practiced, move the Department ticld to the left ot the Rank field.
6 From the field list, drag the Instructor ID field down to the first column in the design grid until the B  pointer 
displays, and then release the mouse button. Compare your screen with Figure 13.52.
The Instructor ID field displays in the first column, and the remaining four fields move to the right. Use this method 
to insert a field to the left of a field already displayed in the design grid.

7 On the Design tab, in the Results group, click the Run button.
This query answers the question, Wluil is the Instructor ID, Deportment, Rank, Lust Name, and First Name for every 
instructor in the I3B Instructors table? The results of the query are a subset of the records contained in the 13B 
Instructors table. The records are sorted by the primary key field—Instructor ID.
8  From Backstage view, display the query in Print Preview. Create a paper or electronic printout if instructed to 
do so, and then Close Print Preview.
9 
Close [*] the query, and in the message box, click Yes to save the changes to the design. Open 0  the 
Navigation Pane.
The new query name displays in the Navigation Pane under the related table.
Objective 11 I Sort Query Results
You can sort the results of a query in ascending or descending order in either 
Datasheet view or Design view. Use Design view if your query results should display in a 
specified sort order, or if you intend to use the sorted results in a report.
Activity 13.27 
Sorting Query Results
In this activity, you will save an existing query with a new name, and then sort the query results by using the 
Sort row in Design view.
1 On the Navigation Pane, click your I3B Instructor IDs Query. Display Backstage view, and then click Save 
Object As. In the Save As dialog box, type Lastname Firstname 13B Department Sort Query and then click OK. 
Click the Home tab, and then drag the right edge of the Navigation Pane to the right to increase its width so 
that the names of the new query and the relationship report display fully.

On the Design tab in the Results group, click the Run button.
In the query result, the records are sorted in ascending alphabetical order by the Last Name field, and two instructors 
have the same last name of Widimer.
On the Home tab in the Views group, click the View button to switch to Design view.
In the Sort row, click in the First Name field, click the Sort arrow, and then click Ascending. Run the query.
In the query result, the records are sorted first by the Last Name field. If instructors have the same last name, then 
Access sorts those records by the First Name field. The two instructors with the last name of Widimer are sorted by 
their first names.
Switch to Design view. In the Sort row, click in the Department field, click the Sort arrow, and then click 
Descending. Run the query; if necessary, scroll down to display the last records, and then compare your screen 
with Figure 13.54.
In Design view, fields with a Sort designation are sorted from left to right. That is, the sorted field on the left becomes 
the outermost sort field, and the sorted field on the right becomes the innermost sort field. Thus, the records are 
sorted first in descending alphabetical order by the Department field—the leftmost sort field. Then, within each 
same department name field, the last names are sorted in ascending alphabetical order. And, finally, within each 
same last name field, the first names are sorted in ascending alphabetical order.

Objective 12 I Specify Criteria in a Query
Queries locate information in a database based on criteria that you specify as part 
of the query. Criteria—the conditions that identify the specific records for which you 
are looking—enable you to ask a more specific question. Therefore, you will get a more 
specific result. For example, ifyou want to find out how many instructors are in the 1ST 
department, limit the results to that specific department, and then only the records that 
match the specified department will display.

Activity 13.28 
Specifying Text Criteria in a Query
In this activity, you will create a query to answer the question How many instructors arc in the 1ST Department?
1 
Be sure that all objects are closed and that the Navigation Pane is closed. Click the Create tab, and then in the 
Queries group, click the Query Design button.
2 In the Show Table dialog box, Add the 13B Instructors table to the table area, and then Close the Show Table 
dialog box.
3 Expand the field list to display all of the fields and the table name. Add the following fields to the design grid 
in the order given: Department, Instructor ID, Rank, First Name, and Last Name.
4  In the Criteria row of the design grid, click in the Department field, type 1ST and then press (Enter). Compare 
your screen with Figure 13.55.
Access places quotation marks around the criteria to indicate that this is a text string—a sequence of characters. Use 
the Criteria row to specify the criteria that will limit the results of the query lo your exact specifications. The criteria 
is not case sensitive, so you can type ist instead of 1ST.

| Do Your Query Results Differ?
Ifyou mistype the criteria, or enter it under the wrong field, or make some other error, the result will display no records. This indicates that 
there are no records in the table that match the criteria as you entered it. If this occurs, return lo Design view and reexamine the query design. 
Verify that the criteria is typed in the Criteria row, under the correct field, and without typing errors. Then run the query again.

Specifying Criteria Using a Field Not Displayed in the Query 
Results
So tar, all ot the fields that you included in the query design have also been included in the query results. It is 
not required to have every field in the query display in the results. In this activity, you will create a query to answer 
the question, Which instructors have a rank of Professor?
4
5
Close [«J the Navigation Pane. Click the Create tab, and then in the Queries group, click the Query Design
button.
From the Show Table dialog box, Add the 13B Instructors table to the table area, and then Close the dialog box. 
Expand the field list.
Add the following fields, in the order given, to the design grid: Instructor ID, First Name, Last Name, and 
Rank.
In the Sort row, in the Last Name field, click the Sort arrow; click Ascending.
In the Criteria row, click in the Rank field, type professor and then press [Enterl.
Recall that criteria is not case sensitive. As you start typing professor, a list of functions displays, from which you can 
select if including a function in your criteria. When you press [Biterl, the insertion point moves to the next criteria box 
and quotation marks are added around the text string that you entered.
In the design grid, in the Show row, notice that the check box is selected for every field. Run the query to view 
the query results.
Nineteen records meet the criteria, and the records are sorted in ascending alphabetical order by the Last Name field.
Switch to Design view. In the design grid, under Rank, in the Show row, click to clear the check box. Compare 
your screen with Figure 13.57.
Because it is repetitive and not particularly useful to have Professor display for each record in the query results, clear 
this check box so that the field does not display. However, you should run the query before clearing the Show check 
box to be sure that the correct records display.

Activity 13.30 
Using Is Null Criteria to Find Empty Fields
Sometimes you must locate records where data is missing. You can locate such records by using Is N u ll— 
emply—as the criteria in a field. Additionally, you can display only the records where a value has been entered 
in a field by using Is Not N ull as the criteria, which will exclude records where the specified field is empty. In this 
activity, you will design a query to find out Which scheduled courses have no credits listed?
1 
Click the Create tab. In the Queries group, click the Query Design button. Add the 13B Schedule table to the 
table area, Close the Show Table dialog box, and then expand the field list.
2 Add the following fields to the design grid in the order given: Subject, Catalog#, Section, Course Name, and 
Credits.
3 In the Criteria row, click in the Credits field, type is null and then press (biterl.
Access capitalizes is null. The criteria Is Null examines the field and looks for records that do not have any values 
entered in the Credits field.
4  In the Sort row, click in the Subject field, click the Sort arrow, and then click Ascending. Sort the Catalog# field 
in Ascending order. Compare your screen with Figure 13.58.

Creating Table Relationships
In this activity, you will create a one-to-many relationship between the 13C Athletes table and the 13C
Scholarships Awarded table by using the common field—Student ID.
1 Click the Database Tools tab, and then in the Relationships group, click the Relationships button.
2 In the Show Table dialog box, Add the 13C Athletes table, and then Add the 13C Scholarships Awarded table to 
the table area. Close the Show Table dialog box.
3 Move and resize the two field lists to display all of the fields and the entire table name, and then position the 
field lists so that there is approximately one inch of space between the two field lists.
4 In the 13C Athletes field list, point to the Student ID field. Hold down the left mouse button, drag into the 13C 
Scholarships Awarded field list on top of the Student ID field, and then release the mouse button to display the 
Edit Relationships dialog box.
5 Point to the title bar of the Edit Relationships dialog box, and then drag it below the two field lists. In the Edit 
Relationships dialog box, be sure that Student ID is displayed as the common field for both tables.
The two tables relate in a one-to-many relationship—one athlete can have many scholarships. In the 13C Athletes 
table, Student ID is the primary key. In the 13C Scholarships Awarded table, Student ID is the foreign key.
6 In the Edit Relationships dialog box, select the Enforce Referential Integrity check box. Click Create, and then 
compare your screen with Figure 13.62.
The one-to-many relationship is established. The I and °o indicate that referential integrity is enforced, which 
ensures that a scholarship cannot be awarded to a student whose Student ID is not in the 13C Athletes table. 
Similarly, you cannot delete a student athlete from the 13C Athletes table if there is a scholarship listed for that 
student in the 13C Scholarships Awarded table.

Using Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are symbols that evaluate each field value to determine if it is the same (=), greater 
than (>), less than (<), or in between a range of values as specified by the criteria. If no comparison operator is 
specified, equal (=) is assumed.

Activity 13.35 
Using the Between ... And Comparison Operator
The Between ... And operator is a comparison operator that looks for values within a range. It is useful when 
you need to locate records that are within a range of dates; for example, scholarships awarded between August
1 and September 30. In this activity, you will create a new query from an existing query, and then add criteria 
to look for values within a range of dates. The query will answer the question, Which scholarships were awarded 
between August 1 and September 30?
1 On the Navigation Pane, click the 13C $300 or More Query object to select it. Display Backstage view and click 
Save Object As. In the Save As dialog box, type Lastname Firstname 13C Awards Aug-Sep Query and then 
click OK.
Click the Home tab. Open the 13C Awards Aug-Sep Query object, Close |_^J the Navigation Pane, and then 
switch to Design view. From the 13C Scholarships Awarded field list, add the Award Date as the fourth field in 
the design grid.
In the Criteria row, click in the Amount field, and then delete the existing criteria so that the query is not 
restricted by amount. In the Criteria row, click in the Award Date field, type between 8/1/16 and 9/30/16 and 
then press (Biterl.
In the selection bar of the design grid, point to the right edge of the Award Date column to display the 
pointer, and then double-click. Compare your screen with Figure 13.65.
I he width of the Award Date column is increased to lit the longest entry, enabling you to see all of the criteria. 
Access places pound signs (#) around dates and capitalizes between and and. This criteria instructs Access to look 
lor values in the Award Date Held that begin with 8/1/16 and end with 9/30/16. Both the beginning and ending dates 
will be included in the query results.

Objective 14 | Use Compound Criteria
You can specify more than one condition—criteria—in a query; this is called 
compound criteria. Compound criteria use AND and OR logical operators. Logical 
operators enable you to enter criteria for the same field or different fields.
Activity 13.36 
Using AND Criteria in a Query
Compound criteria use an A N D  condition to display records in the query results that meet all parts of the 
specified criteria. In this activity, you will answer the question, Which scholarships over $500 were awarded for 
Football?
1 On the Ribbon, click the Create tab. In the Queries group, click the Query Design button. Add the 13C 
Scholarships Awarded table to the table area. Close the Show Table dialog box, and then expand the field list.
2 Add the following fields to the design grid in the order given: Scholarship Name, Sport, and Amount.
3 In the Criteria row, click in the Sport field, type football and then press [Biter].
4 In the Criteria row, in the Amount field, type >500 and then press [Enter). Compare your screen with Figure 13.66.
You create the A N D  condition by placing the criteria for both fields on the same line in the Criteria row. The results 
will display only records that contain Football A N D  an amount greater than $500.

Activity 13.37 
Using OR Criteria in a Query
Use the OR condition to specify multiple criteria for a single field, or multiple criteria for different fields when 
you want to display the records that meet any ot the conditions. In this activity, you will answer the question, 
Which scholarships over $400 were awarded in the sports of Baseball or Swimming, and what is the award date of 
each?
1 Click the Create tab. In the Queries group, click the Query Design button. Add the 13C Scholarships Awarded 
table. Close the dialog box, and expand the field list.
2 Add the following four fields to the design grid in the order given: Scholarship Name, Sport, Amount, and 
Award Date.
3 In the Criteria row, click in the Sport field, and then type baseball On the or row, click in the Sport field, type 
swimming and then press [Enterl. Run the query.
The query results display seven scholarship records where the Sport is either Baseball or Swimming. Use the OR 
condition to specify multiple criteria for a single field.
4 Switch to Design view. In the or row, under Sport, delete swimming. In the Criteria row, under Sport, delete 
baseball. Type swimming or baseball and then in the Criteria row, click in the Amount field. Type >400 and 
then press Inter). Increase the width of the Sport column. Compare your screen with Figure 13.67.
This is an alternative way to use the OR compound operator in the Sport field. Because criteria is entered for two 
different fields, Access selects the records that are Baseball or Swimming and that have a scholarship awarded in an 
amount greater than $400. If you enter swimming on the Criteria row and baseball on the or row, then you must 
enter >400 on both the Criteria row and the or row so that the correct records display when the query runs.

GO! All In One I Chapter 13: Create, Query, and Sort an Access Database; Create Forms and Reports

Objective 15 I Create a Query Based on More Than
One Table
In a relational database, you can retrieve information from more than one table. Recall 
that a table in a relational database contains all of the records about a single topic. Tables 
are joined by relating the primary key field in one table to a foreign key field in another 
table. This common field creates a relationship, so you can include data from more than 
one table in a query.
For example, the Athletes table contains all of the information about the student athletes—name, address, 
and so on. The Scholarships Awarded table includes the scholarship name, amount, and so on. When an athlete 
receives a scholarship, only the Student ID field is included with the scholarship to identify who received the 
scholarship. It is not necessary to include any other data about the athletes in the Scholarships Awarded table; 
doing so would result in redundant data.
Activity 13.38 
Creating a Query Based on More Than One Table
In this activity, you will create a query that selects records from two related tables. The query will answer the 
questions, W hat is the name, e-mail address, and phone number of athletes who have received swimming or tennis 
scholarships, and what is the name and amount of the scholarship?
1 Click the Create tab. In the Queries group, click the Query Design button. Add the 13C Athletes table and the 
13C Scholarships Awarded table to the table area, and then Close the Show Table dialog box. Expand the two 
field lists, and then drag the 13C Scholarships Awarded field list to the right so that there is approximately one 
inch of space between the field lists.
The join line displays because you previously created a relationship between the tables. It indicates a one-to-many 
relationship.
2 From the 13C Athletes field list, add the following fields to the design grid in the order given: First Name, Last 
Name, College E-mail, and Home Phone.
3 In the Sort row, click in the Last Name field. Click the Sort arrow, and then click Ascending to sort the records 
in alphabetical order by last name.
4  From the 13C Scholarships Awarded field list, add the following fields to the design grid in the order given: 
Scholarship Name, Sport, and Amount.
5 In the Criteria row, click in the Sport field. Type swimming or tennis and then press (Enter].
6 In the design grid, increase the width of the Home Phone and Scholarship Name columns to display the entire 
table name on the Table row. If necessary, scroll to the right to display the Home Phone and Scholarship Name 
fields in the design grid, and then compare your screen with Figure 13.68.
When extracting data from multiple tables, the information on the Table row is helpful, especially when different tables 
include the same field names, such as address, but different data, such as a student’s address or a coach’s address.

7 
Run the query, and then compare your screen with Figure 13.69.
Information for eight student athletes displays. The First Name and Last Name fields are included in the query 
results even though the common field—Student ID—is not included in the query design. Because Student ID is 
included in both tables, and a one-to-many relationship was created between the tables, the Student ID field is used 
to select the records in both tables by using one query. Two students —Carla Reid and Florence Zimmerman 
received scholarships in both Swimming and Tennis. Recall that one student athlete can receive many scholarships.

Objective 17 j Use Calculated Fields in a Query
Queries can create calculated values that are stored in a calculated field. A calculated 
field stores the value of a mathematical operation. For example, you can multiply two 
fields together, such as Total Credit Hours and Tuition Per Credit Hour, to get a Total 
Tuition Due amount for each student without having to include a specific field for this 
amount in the table, which reduces the size of the database and provides more flexibility.
There are two steps to produce a calculated field in a query. First, name the field that 
will store the calculated values. Second, write the expression—the formula—that performs the calculation. Each 
field name used in the calculation must be enclosed within its own pair of square brackets, and the new field name 
must be followed bv a colon (:).

For each scholarship received by student athletes, the Capital Cities Community College Alumni Association 
will donate an amount equal to 50 percent of each scholarship. In this activity, you will create a calculated field to 
determine the additional amount each scholarship is worth. The query will answer the question, W hat is the value 
of each scholarship if the Alum ni Association makes a matching 50% donation?
1 
Close [«] the Navigation Pane, if necessary, and then click the Create tab. In the Queries group, click the Query 
Design button.
2  Add the 13C Scholarships Awarded table to the table area, Close the Show Table dialog box, and then expand 
the field list. Add the following fields to the design grid in the order given: Student ID, Scholarship Name, and 
Amount.
3 In the Sort row, click in the Student ID field; sort Ascending.
4 In the Field row, right-click in the first empty column to display a shortcut menu, and then click Zoom.
The Zoom dialog box gives you more working space so that you can see the entire calculation as you type it. The 
calculation can also be typed directly in the empty Field box in the column.
5 In the Zoom dialog box, type Matching Donation:[Amount]*0.5 and then compare your screen with Figure 13.73.
The first element, Matching Donation, is the new field name where the calculated values will display. Following 
that is a colon (:), which separates the new field name from the expression. Amount is enclosed in square brackets 
because it is an existing field name in the 13C Scholarships Awarded table; it contains the numeric data on which 
the calculation will be performed. Following the right square bracket is an asterisk (*), which in math calculations 
signifies multiplication. Finally, the percentage (0.5 or 50%) displays.

Switch to Design view. Select the Sum function, and then Run the query.
Access sums the Amount field for all records and displays a result of $10,750.00. The field name, SumOfAmount, 
displays. This query answers the question, What is the total dollar amount of all the scholarships awarded?
Activity 13.42 
Grouping Data in a Query
Aggregate functions can also be used to calculate totals by groups of data. For example, to group (summarize) 
the amount of scholarships awarded to each student, you include the Student ID field, in addition to the Amount 
field, and then group all of the records for each student together to calculate a total awarded to each student.
1 Switch to Design view. Drag the Student ID  field to the first column of the design grid—Amount becomes the 
second column. On the Total row, under Student ID, notice that Group By displays.
This query groups—summarizes—the records by Student ID and calculates a total Amount for each student.
2 
Run the query, and then compare your screen with Figure 13.78.
The query calculates the total amount of all scholarships for each student.

Create a Crosstab Query
A crosstab query uses an aggregate function for data that can be grouped by two types 
of information and displays data in a compact, spreadsheet-like format. A crosstab query 
always has at least one row heading, one column heading, and one summary field. Use a 
crosstab query to summarize a large amount of data in a small space that is easy to read.
Activity 13.43 
Creating a Crosstab Query Using One Table
In this activity, you will create a crosstab query that displays the total amount of scholarships awarded for each 
sport and for each team—women’s or men’s.

Content-Based Assessments
Summary
Microsoft Access 2010 is a database management system that uses various objects—tables, forms, 
queries, reports—to organize information. Data is stored in tables in which you establish fields, set 
the data type and field size, and create a primary key. Data from a database can be reported and 
printed. Sorting data in a table reorders the records based on one or more fields.
Use queries to ask complex questions about the data in a database in a manner that Access can 
interpret. Save queries so they can be run as needed against current records. Use queries to limit 
the fields that display, add criteria to restrict the number of records in the query results, create cal­
culated values, include data from more than one table, and to display data grouped by two types of 
information.

Query and then switch to Design view. Redesign the 
query to answer the question, What is the Grant Name, 
Department, Award Amount, and Award Date for grants 
sorted first in alphabetical order by Department and then 
in descending order by Amount? Display only the fields 
necessary to answer the question and in the order listed 
in the question. With Normal margins, create a paper or 
electronic printout as directed. Close the query, saving 
changes to the query design.
7 Open the Navigation Pane, open 13E Grant Sort 
Query, and then Close the Navigation Pane. Save the 
query as Lastname Firstname 13E Private Grants 
Query and then switch to Design view. Redesign the 
query to answer the question, What is the Grant Name, 
Department, Award Amount, and Award Date for grants 
that have a Type of Private, sorted in alphabetical order 
by Grant Name? Do not display the Type field in the 
query results; display the fields in the order listed in
the question. With Normal margins, create a paper or 
electronic printout as directed. Close the query, saving 
changes to the query design.
8  Create a query in Query Design view, using the 13E 
Organizations table to answer the question, What is the 
Organization Name, Contact Name, and Contact Phone 
where the Contact Phone number is missing from the 
table, sorted in alphabetical order by the Organization 
Name? Two records meet the criteria. Save the query as 
Lastname Firstname 13E Missing Phone# Query and 
then create a paper or electronic printout as directed. 
Close the query.
9  Open the Navigation Pane and widen it so that 
all object names display fully. In Backstage view, click 
Close Database, and then click Exit. As directed by your 
instructor, submit your database and the seven paper or 
electronic printouts—relationship report, sorted table, 
and five queries—that are the results of this project.

Start Access. From your student files, open the 
al3F_Events_Clients database. Save the database
in your All In One Chapter 13 folder as Lastname, 
Firstname_13F Events_Clients and then enable the 
content. In the Navigation Pane, Rename the table by 
adding Lastname Firstname to the beginning of the 
table name.
2 Import the el3F_Rental_CIients Excel spreadsheet 
from the student data files that accompany this textbook 
into the current database as a new table. Designate the 
first row of the spreadsheet as column headings. Select 
the Rental Client ID field as the primary key. Name the 
table Lastname Firstname 13F Rental Clients and then 
widen the Navigation Pane to display fully the two table 
names. Open both tables and examine their contents to 
become familiar with the data. In the 13F Rental Clients 
table, apply Best Fit to all of the columns. Close both 
tables, saving changes, and then Close the Navigation 
Pane.
3 Create a one-to-many relationship between the 13F 
Rental Clients table and the 13F Events table based on 
the Rental Client ID field, and then Enforce Referential
Integrity. One rental client can have many events. Create 
a Relationship Report, saving it with the default name. 
Create a paper or electronic printout as directed, and 
then Close all open objects, saving changes if prompted.
4 Create a query in Query Design view using the 13F 
Events table to answer the question, What is the Event 
Name, Rental Client ID, and Rental Fee for events with 
fees greater than or equal to $500, and in which Facility 
was the event held displayed in ascending order by Rental 
Client ID ? Display the fields in the order listed in the 
question. Eleven records meet the criteria. Save the query 
as Lastname Firstname 13F Fees $500 or More Query 
Create a paper or electronic printout as directed. Leave 
the query open.
5 Using the 13F Fees $500 or More Query object, 
create a new query, and save it as Lastname Firstname 
13F Afternoon Events Query Redesign the query to 
answer the questions, Which Events were held in the 
Afternoon between 7/1/16 and 8/31/16, in chronological 
order by date, what was the Rental Fee, and what was the 
Event ID ? (Hint: Open the 13F Events table to see how
the Time field data is stored.) Do not display the Time 
field in the results, and do not restrict the results by 
Rental Fee. Four records meet the criteria. Create a paper 
or electronic printout as directed, Close the query, and 
Save changes to the design.
6 Create a query in Query Design view using the 
I3F Events table to answer the question, Which Events 
and Event Types were held in either the White Sands 
Music Hall or the Theater that had Rental Fees greater 
than $500? Display the fields in the order listed in the 
question. Three records meet the criteria. Save the query 
as Lastname Firstname 13F W S and Theater Over $500 
Query and then create a paper or electronic printout as 
directed. Close the query.
7 Create a query in Query Design view using both 
tables to answer the question, Which Events were held 
on one of the sports fields, for which Renter Name, and 
what was the Rental Fee in order of lowest fee to highest 
fee? (Hint: Use a wildcard with the word Field.) Display 
the fields in the order listed in the question. Five records 
meet the criteria. Save the query as Lastname Firstname 
13F Field Usage Query and then with Normal margins, 
create a paper or electronic printout as directed. Close the 
query.
8 The college Alumni Association will donate money 
to the Building Fund in an amount based on 10 percent 
of total facility rental fees. Create a query in Query Design 
view using the 13F Events table to answer the question,
In ascending order by Event ID, what will be the total 
of each Rental Fee if the Alumni Association donates an 
additional 10% of each fee? (Hint: First compute the 
amount of the donation, name the new field Donation 
Amount and run the query to view the results. Then 
calculate the new rental fee and name the new field 
Rental Fee with Donation) Run the query.

Mastering Access | Project 13G Academic Scholarships (continued)
1 
Start Access. From your student files, open the 
al3G_Academic_Scholarships database. Save the 
database in your All In One Chapter 13 folder as 
Lastname Firstname_13G_Academic_Scholarships and
then enable the content. Rename both tables by adding 
Lastname Firstname to the beginning of the table name, 
and then widen the Navigation Pane to display fully the 
object names.
2 Open the two database tables to become familiar 
with the data. Close the tables, and then create a one- 
to-many relationship between the 13G Students table 
and the I3G Scholarships Awarded table based on the 
Student ID field, and then Enforce Referential Integrity; 
one student can have many scholarships. Create the 
Relationship Report, and create a paper or electronic 
printout as directed, saving it with the default name. 
Close all open objects.
3  Open the 13G Scholarships Awarded table, and then 
Sort the appropriate fields in Ascending order so that the 
records are sorted by the Major field, and then, within 
each Major, the records should be sorted by Scholarship 
Name. Create a paper or electronic printout in Landscape 
orientation. Close the table, and do not save changes to 
the table design. Close the Navigation Pane.
4  Create a query in Query Design view using the 13G 
Scholarships Awarded table to answer the question,
In alphabetical order by Scholarship Name, what is the 
Amount and Major for scholarships less than or equal 
to $500? Display the fields in the order listed in the 
question. Twenty records meet the criteria. Save the 
query as Lastname Firstname 13G Scholarships $500 or 
Less Query and create a paper or electronic printout as 
directed. Close Print Preview, and leave the query open.
5 Using the 13G Scholarships $500 or Less Query,
create a query. Save the Object As Lastname Firstname 
13G Scholarships 4th Qtr Query and then redesign the 
query to answer the question, Which scholarships were 
awarded, in chronological order by Award Date, between 
10/1/16 and 12/31/16, for what amount, and what was 
Student ID  of the student? [Display the fields in the order 
listed in the question, display only the fields listed in the 
question, do not restrict the amount, and sort only by 
date. Seven records meet the criteria. Create a paper or 
electronic printout as directed. Close the query, saving 
changes.
6 Create a query in Query Design view using the I3G 
Scholarships Awarded table to answer the question, 
Which scholarships were awarded for either CIS or 
Math majors for amounts of more than $250, listed in 
descending order by amount? Display the fields in the 
order listed in the question. 'I"wo records meet the 
criteria. (Hint: If three records display, switch to Design 
view and combine the majors on one criteria line using 
OR.) Save the query as Lastname Firstname 13G CIS or 
Math More Than $250 Query and then create a paper or 
electronic printout as directed. Close the query.
7 Create a query in Query Design view. Use the 13G 
Students table and a wildcard to answer the question, In 
alphabetical order by City and in alphabetical order by 
Last Name, what are the Student ID, City, First Name, 
and Last Name of students from cities that begin with 
the letter F? Display the fields in the order listed in the 
question. Six records meet the criteria. Save the query as 
Lastname Firstname 13G Cities Query Create a paper or 
electronic printout as directed. Close the query.
8  Create a query in Query Design view' using the 
13G Students table and all of the table’s fields to 
answer the question For which students is the Z IP Code 
missing? Four students are missing ZIP Codes. Save 
the query as Lastname Firstname 13G Missing ZIP 
Query and then, with Normal margins, create a paper or 
electronic printout as directed. Close the query. Using 
the information that displays in the query results, an 
enrollment clerk can use a reference to look up the ZIP 
codes for the students and then enter the ZIP codes in the 
student records in the underlying table.
9 For each scholarship, the college Foundation Board 
will donate an amount equal to 25 percent of each 
scholarship. Create a query in Query Design view. Use 
both tables and calculated fields to answer the question,
In alphabetical order by scholarship name, and including 
the first and last name of the scholarship recipient, what 
will the value of each scholarship be if the Foundation 
makes a matching 25 percent donation? (Hint: First 
compute the amount of the donation, naming the new 
field Donation and then calculate the new scholarship 
value, naming the new field Updated Value)
Run the query, switch back to Design view, and as 
necessary, change the properties of all the numeric fields 
to display in Currency format with 0 decimal places, and

by using Windows Live SkyDrive, create and store Office Web Apps 
documents, and communicate by using email and instant messaging. 
As a Windows Vista or Windows 7 user with an Internet connection, 
you have access to Windows Live Essentials, 
a set of free programs available for download.
In this chapter, you will learn how a College Library Assistant 
creates a free Windows Live account and uses its SkyDrive to store 
Microsoft Office documents on the Web. You will also see how a 
College Library Assistant uses Microsoft Office Web Apps to create, 
edit, store, and collaborate on documents in a cloud computing 
environment. Additionally, you will learn how a College Library 
Assistant creates a OneNote notebook and stores it on the Web. 
Because the daily operations of organizations increasingly rely on 
real time collaboration by sharing information on the Web, it will 
be valuable for you to practice using these tools and applications.
You might already be familiar and comfortable with cloud-based applications in the area of games and 
entertainment.

Objective 1 | Create a Windows Live Account
| When you reach Activity 14.03 of this project, identify a classmate with whom you can partner to 
complete the project, and then set a time and place to work together.
In Objectives 3 through 5 ot this project, which includes Activities 14.03 through 14.08, you will benefit from working together with a classmate 
to exchange emails, share calendars, and use instant messaging. Identify a partner now, and then with him or her, agree on a convenient time 
and place to work through Activities 14.03 through 14.08. You will need approximately 30 minutes.
Windows Live is a collection of programs and services for individuals that work together, and which includes 
Hotmail email, SkyDrive, Office Web Apps, Windows Live Messenger instant messaging (IM ), applications such 
as Photo Gallery and Movie Maker, and mobile phone applications. Office Web Apps are the online companions 
to Microsoft Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. You can use Office Web Apps to create, access, share, 
and perform light editing on Microsoft Office documents from any computer connected to the Internet and using 
a supported Web browser—software that displays Web pages, for example, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and 
Chrome.
One way to think about all of the Windows I.ive technologies is to consider the platform —the underlying 
hardware or software for a system—on which you might use them, for example on the Web, on your PC, or on 
your smartphone.
Windows Live Programs and Services
On the Web as an online 
service
On your PC (desktop, laptop, 
netbook, tablet) as a Windows 
application
On your smartphone
Windows Live Home view, Profile, 
Hotmail, People, Calendar, Photos, 
Events, SkyDrive, Groups, and Office 
Web Apps.
V
The suite of programs referred to 
as Windows Live Essentials, which 
includes Messenger, Mail, Mesh, 
Writer, Photo Gallery, Movie Maker, 
Bing Toolbar, and Family Safety.
The mobile programs and services 
that enable you to access Hotmail, 
Messenger, music, and games, as well 
as photos from your smartphone.
.j
Windows Live provides free access to these online services and applications to make communication, sharing, 
and storage easy and accessible. You must create a Windows Live ID —an account with which you can sign in to 
the Windows Live technologies—to access and use these features from any of the three platforms.
Activity 14.01 
Creating a Windows Live Account
In this activity, you will create a Windows Live account ifyou do not already have one.
| Do you already have a Windows Live ID?
Ifyou already have a Windows Live account and ID, you can skip this activity and begin with Activity 14.02.

Start your Web browser, navigate to http://explore.live.com and then compare your screen with Figure 14.2.
Information about the various services within Windows Live is constantly being updated by Microsoft, so your 
screen may not match exactly the one shown in Figure 14.2.

2 Locate and click Sign up for Hotmail, click in the Windows Live ID box, and then type the name you want to 
use as your Windows Live ID, for example Firstname_Lastname using the underscore instead of spaces. In 
the second box, click the arrow, and then click live.com.
The live.com designation is considered to be more modern than ihe hotmail.com designation, although you can use 
either. The system will check the availability of your selected address. If the first address is not available, try variations 
using your middle initial, last name first, and so on, until you have a logical address that includes your name.
Note | Be Sure You Have an Email Address for Professional Messages
11 is a good idea to create an email address to use professionally, for example, when contacting potential employers. If you have an email address 
with a cute or descriptive name, for example, luv2dance@capccc.edu, use it only to communicate with friends and family.
3  Create a password. Type an alternate email address or choose a security question for password reset in a 
manner similar to Figure 14.3.
A strong password uses a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in 
a character string so it will be hard to guess and therefore will keep your account secure. A weak password—one 
that is short and consists of only letters in a single case—can compromise the security of your data because it is easy 
to guess.

4 Fill in the remainder of the form and the CAPTCHA in a manner similar to Figure 14.4.
A CAPTCHA, which is an acronym tor Completely Automated Public Turing Test To Tell Computers and Humans 
Apart, is a program that protects Web sites against hots by generating and grading tests that only humans can pass. 
A bot is a program that can run automated tasks over the Internet, typically at a higher rate than would be possible 
for a human alone. Humans can read distorted text, like the text shown in Figure 14.4, but current computers 
cannot.
By including a CAPTCHA, the site prevents bots from signing up for thousands of email accounts every minute— 
only a human can obtain a tree account. You can find many other reasons to use a CAPTCHA at www.cdptchn.net

applications, some advertising may display.

Activity 14.02 
Creating Your Windows Live Profile
Because you will use Windows Live to communicate and share information with others online, you should 
create a profile to identify yourself in a manner appropriate for the particular account. You might have a profile 
on other social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, or Linkedln. Those profiles, however, are for different 
purposes and include different types of information. Consider the level of detail you want to provide in a profile. 
In Windows Live, and in most other profiles, you can modify the profile settings and details.
1 If necessary, sign in to your Windows Live account. In the upper right corner of your window, click profile, 
review the privacy settings, and then compare your screen with Figure 14.6.
The profile window displays so you can secure your Windows Live account at an appropriate level before entering 
information. The Public setting provides unlimited access to everyone; it allows everyone to search for you, see your 
profile, and see your Windows Live activity and stored files. The Limited setting protects your online activity and 
content. It allows everyone to search for you, but you must allow them to view your online activity and content. The 
Private setting restricts everyone from searching for you or seeing anything online unless you have allowed them to 
do so. From the profile page, the privacy settings can be changed at any time by clicking the Privacy settings menu.

Objective 2 | Send and Receive Email
Windows Live Hotmail is a free Web-based email provider—there is no software to download or install on 
your computer. Em ail is a method of exchanging messages via the Internet where the message resides in the 
recipient’s mail box until he or she signs in to read it. Windows Live refers to the Microsoft email service called 
Hotm ail, whether you are using an @live.com or @hotmail.com Windows Live ID. Accessing Hotmail enables 
you to create a customized environment for handling, sending, and receiving email messages.
Activity 14.03 
Using Hotmail
In this activity, you will customize your email window.
| Identify a classmate with whom you can partner to complete Activities 14.03 through 14.08 of this 
project, and then set a time and place to work together.

email to proofread email messages to be sure they are written in a professional and concise way. All errors should be corrected m the 
subject line and message before a message is sent tf a message is sent with errors, rt can reflect negatively on the sender.

More Knowledge | What Are Some Good Email Practices?
• Subject lines that indicate the content of the email 
I lelp your email recipient know what the content of your email is by typing 
a clear and concise subject line.
• Revising the subject line if the topic changes—If you want to reply to a message but your reply is on a different topic, change the 
subject line accordingly.
• Single-topic content—Your email message should be about the topic in the subject line and nothing else. Ifyou need to communicate 
about another topic, send another email with a clear subject line.
• A conversational tone that is informal, but not too informal -Write your message in a friendly tone, but avoid being as casual 
as you would be with your friends or family members. Within an organization, email messages are considered business communications.
• Concise writing -Write your message concisely. Get to the point without wordy phrases.
• Including only a few short paragraphs—If you cannot convey your message in a few short paragraphs of no more than two or three 
sentences each, you should probably call the person or meet with him or her.
• Proofreading—Re-read your message to make sure you have not made typing errors or omitted words that would change the context of 
your message entirely.
• Never using all capital letters—Writing in all capital letters is considered to be shouting. Additionally, it is very difficult to read 
messages in all capital letters.
• Attaching indicated attachments -An embarrassing yet common error is to indicate that you are attaching something and then 
forgetting to attach it. Then you must send another email with the attachment.
. Never clicking the Send button without a final check -Before clicking the Send button, re-read your message for clarity and 
appropriateness, take out any unnecessary text, attach any attachments, and be sure you have used the correct email addresses.

3 Click the Share this calendar option button to display sharing options.
The default option for sharing is to share your calendar privately with friends and family by adding people with 
specific rights. Other options include sending a link to contacts so they can view' your calendar without a Windows 
Live ID and making your calendar public for anyone to see on a Web site or through a search engine.
4 Click the Add people button to see a list of your contacts, and then select your partner’s email address. At the 
bottom of the window, click the View details arrow. Compare your screen with Figure 14.23.
Be cautious with the information you share. Ifyou allow friends to have any editing rights, they can add, change, or 
delete items in your calendar. You must monitor your calendar carefully to meet deadlines. If you share only viewing 
rights, you can choose what others can view—details about the events, free/busy times along with titles and locations, 
or only the free/busy times. Each of these options restricts a little more of what you are sharing.

Objective 5 
Use Windows Live SkyDrive
When you crcate your Windows I.ive ID, you get a Windows Live SkyDrive, which is a free file storage and 
file sharing service. You also have access to Office Web Apps. To use Office Web Apps, you must store your 
document in a compatible shared location.
In an organization, the compatible storage location for your Office Web Apps documents could be in a 
SharePoint library. SharePoint is a related group of technologies from Microsoft for collaboration, file sharing, and 
Web publishing within organizations. As an individual, your compatible storage location is a Windows Live SkyDrive.
Using Web servers on the Internet—for example, SkyDrive or a SharePoint library—to store files and run 
applications is referred to as cloud computing. By using SkyDrive or a SharePoint library, your documents are 
easy to access from anywhere and easy to share with others—regardless of whether you have a PC or a Mac, and 
regardless of whether you have a version of Microsoft Office on your computer.
Activity 14.09 
Creating Folders and Storing Documents on SkyDrive
By storing files on your SkyDrive, you can access them from anywhere that you have Internet access and a 
supported browser. In this activity, you will create a new folder in your SkyDrive and upload two documents.
1 Start your Web browser, navigate to www.live.com and sign in to Windows Live. At the top of the window,
click SkyDrive. Compare your screen with Figure 14.34.

Objective 6 | Use Office Web Apps to Create 
and Edit a Word Document
Office Web Apps are the online companions lo Microsoft Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote 
that enable you to create, access, share, and perform light editing on Microsoft Office documents from any device 
that connects to the Internet and uses a supported Web browser; for example from a laptop, a netbook, a tablet, a 
MAC, or a smartphone. Office Web Apps are available in two ways—either in Windows Live by signing in with 
your personal Windows Live ID or on a SharePoint site for individuals in organizations that have installed and 
configured Office Web Apps on a SharePoint site.
Personal use of Office Web Apps is free, and requires only a Windows Live ID and a computer with an 
Internet connection and supported browser software; for example, Internet Explorer 7 or later, Safari 4 or later, 
or Firefox 3.5 or later. Business use of Office Web Apps requires a SharePoint site with appropriate software and a 
SharePoint user ID provided by the organization.
You do not need to have Office 2010 installed on your computer to use Office Web Apps. If you have Office 
2010 installed, you have seen that the Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote programs include commands for 
saving files directly to your SkyDrive or to a SharePoint site.
Activity 14.10 
Creating a New Word Document in Office Web Apps
You can navigate to a SkyDrive folder and create a new document in that folder. The New menu is available in 
any SkyDrive folder.
| To complete this project, you must complete Project 14A.
Because you will use the same W indows I ive ID and the folders you created in Project I4A, be sure you have completed Project 14 A before you 
begin this projcct.
1 Open your browser, go to live.com and then sign in with your Windows Live ID. At the top of the window, 
click SkyDrive. Click your CapCCC Bookclub folder to make it the active folder. Near the top of the window,

2  In the Name box, with Documentl highlighted, using your own name, type Lastname_Firstname_14B_Book_ 
Suggestions and then at the end of the Name box, notice that your document will be created in the file format 
used by Word documents in Office 2010—the .docx file format.
Because Office Web Apps use the standard file formats of the desktop version of Office 2010, you will have high- 
fidelity viewing ol documents. That is, in documents created in the full desktop version of Office 2010 and then 
opened in the corresponding Office Web App, you will see images, footnotes, table borders, text effects, and so on, 
even though some of these more sophisticated features are not available in Office Web Apps.

in Windows Live
One advantage to using Office Web Apps is that you can share and work with others on the Web. Those with 
whom you share and collaborate need not have Office installed, can work on a PC or a Mac, or can be using an 
earlier version of Office.
You can maintain a single copy of a document and share it with others by sending a link to it. Those with 
whom you share can access the document in their Web browser and also in their desktop versions of Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, or OneNote.

Summary
In this chapter, you created a Windows Live ID and profile to use with Windows Live and Office 
Web Apps. With your Windows Live ID, you were able to communicate with others via email us­
ing Hotmail, send instant messages using Messenger, and manage and share calendars with a Hot­
mail Calendar. Your account also includes access to Windows Live SkyDrive, where you can store 
documents of any type—including those you create using Office Web Apps. By using the features 
of Office Web Apps, you get browser-based viewing and editing of your Office documents from 
anywhere that you have a Web connection. Ifyou have Microsoft Office 2010, you can save your 
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents directly from your Microsoft Office programs to Sky­
Drive, which is the free online storage service you get when you create a Windows Live ID. If you 
have an earlier version of Office, you can upload Office documents to SkyDrive, and if you have 
no Office, for example ifyou are using a Mac, you can use your Web browser to create new Office 
documents in SkyDrive.

In This Chapter
As a Director of Sales for a hotel that is part 
of a global chain, your success depends on your 
ability to sell rooms and meeting space. This will 
require you to work with your Marketing Depart­
ment and to connect with perspective customers 
quickly. Your connection will most likely be in digi­
tal form—an e-mail, Facebook reply, or a response 
to an entry in the hotel’s blog. You will need to be 
knowledgeable of these methods of communication 
and know how to access them and create replies.
In this chapter, you will learn the fundamentals 
of networking, which is the feature of computers 
that enables connectivity and communication. By 
using computer networking, you will be able to max­
imize technology to successfully perform your job.

Objective 1 
Examine Network 
Fundamentals
As the Director of Sales for a hotel that is 
part of a global hotel chain, you communi­
cate with clients who are planning large 
events such as weddings, business meet­
ings, and conferences. You conduct your 
communications with clients by using 
e-mail and wireless technologies. Some­
times you must redirect clients to a 
member hotel that is larger, has more 
appropriate space or amenities, or that 
has enough available rooms. Communica­
tion with clients that is fast and secure is 
critical to what you do. You need to under­
stand network and communication termi­
nology so that you can explain the value 
and importance of these communications 
to your staff. Where do you start?
Computer networking is essential 
to both business and home users. As an 
informed and literate computer user and 
employee, you must know enough about 
networking to understand the benefits and 
potential problems of connecting comput­
ers. Organizations spend billions of dol­
lars on networking equipment each year 
to create centralized pools of information 
and connect international offices with the 
goal of increasing service and profit. These 
organizations are looking to employ indi­
viduals who understand basic networking 
concepts, know how to utilize this technol­
ogy, and are able to discuss problems and 
suggest improvements.
Concept 15.01 
Overviewing 
Networks
A network is a group of two or more com­
puter systems linked together to exchange 
data and share an Internet connection and 
resources, including expensive peripherals 
such as high-performance laser printers. 
Just a few years ago, computer networks 
for business and organizations had only 
two classifications—local area networks 
and wide area networks—that were based 
on the size of the geographical region that 
a network spans. Now, additional catego­
ries have evolved:
• A local area network (LAN) uses 
cables, radio waves, or infrared signals 
to link computers or peripherals, such 
as printers, within a small geographic 
area, for example, in a building or a
group of buildings. LANs are typically 
owned and managed by a single 
person or organization.
A wide area network (WAN) uses 
long-distance transmission media, 
like satellites and leased lines, to link 
computers separated by a few miles 
or even thousands of miles. A WAN is 
a geographically dispersed collection 
of LANs (Figure 15.1 >. The Internet is 
the largest WAN; it connects millions 
of LANs all over the globe. Unlike 
the Internet, which is not owned by 
any individual or organization, some 
WANs are privately owned.
A metropolitan area network 
(MAN) links a city or town, and is 
usually larger than a LAN but smaller 
than a WAN. Typically, a MAN is 
owned by a single government or or­
ganization, for example, a network to 
connect Fire Stations across a region 
or county, or a network that supports 
a site like 511NY (www.511ny.org/ 
traffic.aspx), which informs travelers 
of statewide traffic conditions.
A campus area network (CAN) 
links a college campus or business 
park. A CAN is smaller than a WAN 
and is created by connecting several 
LANs (Figure 15.2).
A personal area network (PAN) 
connects an individual’s own personal 
communication devices, like a note­
book, cell phone, personal digital as­
sistant, and portable printer. A PAN 
is typically arranged within a range 
of 30 feet or less and usually involves 
wireless technology.

Concept 15.02 Clarifying 
Communication Devices
Any type of network requires communica­
tions devices to convert data into signals 
that can travel over a physical wired or 
wireless medium. Communication de­
vices include computers, modems, routers, 
switches, hubs, wireless access points, and 
network interface cards. These devices 
transform data from analog to digital 
signals and back again, determine effi­
cient data-transfer pathways, boost signal 
strength, and facilitate digital communica­
tion (Figure 15.3).
Any device connected to a network 
is referred to as a node, and can be any 
computer, peripheral, or communica­
tion device. Each device on the network

has a unique logical 
address, or name, 
assigned by the soft­
ware in use as well as 
a unique numeric or 
physical address built 
into the hardware. This 
physical address is also 
referred to as the data 
link control address, 
data link control I con­
nection identifier (DLCI), or media access 
control (MAC) address. Depending on the 
format of the network, the physical ad­
dress or logical address can be used to 
identify a device.
A computer must have the electronic 
components to physically connect to a 
network. These components can either 
be built into the motherboard or located 
on a network interface card (NIC). A 
NIC is an expansion board that fits into 
an expansion slot, or adapter, that is built 
into the computer’s motherboard. Current 
computing and communication devices 
most likely will come with some means of 
wireless connectivity. The three common 
means for a device to connect wirelessly to 
a network include a USB wireless network 
adapter, a wireless PC card adapter, or 
wireless capability built into the mother­
board’s chipset (Figure 15.4).
A USB wireless network adapter is 
a communication device that plugs into a 
USB port and usually provides an intui­
tive graphical user interface (GUI) for easy 
configuration. This device is the same size 
as a USB flash drive or thumb drive. It is 
ideal for the traveler and notebook user.
A wireless PC card adapter, approx­
imately the size of a credit card, is inserted 
into a slot on the side of most notebooks 
that do not have wireless capability

embedded on its chipset. The card adapter 
has a built-in WiFi antenna that provides 
wireless capability and LED lights that in­
dicate whether the computer is connected.
Ifyou are purchasing a new notebook, 
you might want to look for one in which 
the wireless technology is built into the 
chipset, providing fast wireless connectiv­
ity without the hassle of having to insert 
an external peripheral. The chipset is a 
group of integrated circuits located on 
the motherboard, developed for a specific 
microprocessor (CPU), and that cannot be 
removed or upgraded. A chipset’s primary 
function is to connect the microprocessor 
to all other components of the computer. 
For more detailed information on the 
chipset, visit http://computer.howstuff- 
works.com /m otherboard3.htm .
In addition to your data passing 
through a NIC card or wireless adapter to 
get to and from a network, your data has 
probably also passed through such devices 
as modems, routers, switches, hubs, and 
wireless access points on its network jour­
ney from source to destination.
A modem is a communication device 
that sends and receives data from one 
transmission system to another. On the 
sending end, a modem uses a process 
called modulation to transform the com­
puter’s digital signals into signals appro­
priate for the transmission system being 
used. On the receiving end, the process 
used is demodulation, whereby the
Wireless connectivity 
provided on the 
embedded chipset
receiving modem transforms the signal 
from the transmission system back into 
a digital form that a computer can un­
derstand. The term modem comes from 
combining the words modulate and de­
modulate. In its early stages, a computer 
sending digital data would pass it through 
a modem that would modulate the digital 
data into analog form, permitting it to 
travel over telephone lines. On the com­
puter receiving the data, a modem would 
demodulate the analog signal into the 
digital form enabling it to be understood 
by the receiving computer (Figure 15.5). 
Today your modem connects your com­
puter to an Internet service provider (ISP) 
that in turn connects you to the Internet. 
Your modem still modulates a signal when 
sending and demodulates the signal when 
receiving. In the case of a fiber-optic trans­
mission, a modem modulates the digital 
signal into light signals and demodulates 
light signals to digital signals.
The data transfer rate, the rate at 
which two modems can exchange data, 
is measured in bits per second and is re­
ferred to as the bps rate. Often, a single 
message travels over several different 
wired and wireless transmission media, 
including telephone lines, coaxial cable, 
fiber-optic cable, radio waves, micro­
waves, and satellite, before it arrives at 
its destination.
A hub is a simple, inexpensive device 
that joins multiple computers together
FIG URE 15.5 
Early 
modems transformed the 
computer’s digital signals 
into telephone analog 
signals and transmitted 
them through the telephone 
system. On the receiving 
computer, a modem would 
demodulate the analog 
signal back to a digital 
signal.

in a single network but does not manage 
the traffic between the connections, which 
usually results in frequent collisions. 
Switches are more intelligent than hubs. 
Instead of just passing data packets along 
the network, a switch contains software 
that inspects the source and target of a 
data package and attempts to deliver it to 
that destination. By doing this, a switch 
condenses bandwidth and has better per­
formance than a hub. Switches and hubs 
move data only between devices w-ithin a 
single network. A router is a more com­
plex network device that provides intel­
ligent network management; it has the 
capability to inspect the source and target 
of a data package and determine the best 
path to route data. A wireless access 
point, also known as an AP or WAP. con­
nects wireless devices to a wired network. 
Usually this technology is embedded 
within wireless broadband routers that 
also include a switch to connect your wired 
Ethernet devices and a router to permit 
all devices to share a cable, DSL, or FiOS 
Internet connection (Figure 15.6).
Concept 15.03 Utilizing a 
Network Operating System
Each computer on a network must include 
software that enables the computer to con­
nect to the network and exchange data 
with other computers. This capability to 
configure a system to connect to a network 
is built in to modern operating systems.
On business networks, you can expect 
to see one or more dedicated servers, a 
computer or device with software that 
manages network resources like files, 
e-mails, printers, and databases. The 
most common type of server is the file 
server, a high-capacity, high-speed com­
puter with a large hard disk. A file server 
is dedicated to make program files and
data files available to those users on a 
network that have been granted access 
permission. The file server is where the 
network operating system (NOS) is 
installed. A network operating system dif­
fers from the operating system you use on 
your PC or notebook, because a network 
operating system contains instructions 
enabling data transfer and application 
sharing among computers and other de­
vices connected in the netw'ork. A network 
operating system requires installation 
by a skilled technician. Network operat­
ing systems like SUSE Linux Enterprise 
Server, Microsoft Windows Server 2008 
R2, and Mac OS X Lion Server provide the 
following:
• File directories that make it easy to 
locate files and resources on the LAN
• Automated distribution of software 
updates to the desktop computers on 
the LAN
• Support for Internet services such 
as access to the World Wide Web 
and e-mail
• Protection of services and data located 
on the network
• Access to connected hardware by 
authorized network users
a>
V I  4 4
In addition to a net­
work’s special hardware 
and software, people 
are also necessary for 
the proper functioning 
of a network. Network 
administrators, some­
times called network 
engineers, install, 
maintain, and support 
computer networks 
(Figure 15.7). They in­
teract with users, handle 
security, and trouble­
shoot problems.
A network adminis­
trator’s most important 
task is granting access 
to the network. This 
includes setting permis­
sions for which files, 
folders, and network de­
vices each network user 
has the right to access, 
based on such items as 
the division of the organization where the 
user is employed, the level of security clear­
ance the user holds, and the confidentiality 
of the data itself.

Objective 2 | Assess 
the Structure and 
Value of Networks
As the Director of Sales for a hotel that is 
part of a global hotel chain, you recently 
participated in a regional sales meeting.
A topic that was discussed in depth was 
the creation of a single networked regional 
calendar that displays all conference res­
ervations at all of the chain’s hotels within 
a region. The Regional Director of Sales 
thinks this will speed up the process of di­
recting customers to available accommoda­
tions in the hotel chain that are available 
and match the clients requested services. 
Your experience indicates that this would 
involve constantly updating the calendar 
on the corporate network in order to avoid 
embarrassment caused by incorrect or 
omitted entries. You want to point out the 
pros and cons of this new plan. Where do 
you start?
Concept 15.04 Reviewing the 
Pros and Cons of Networking
When you connect two or more computers, 
you see gains—especially with regard to 
efficiency and costs. For example, you can 
expect to see:
• Reduced hardware costs: The sharing 
of equipment like high-capacity print­
ers and storage devices in a network 
reduces the cost of purchasing dupli­
cate devices.
• Reduced software costs: Network 
versions of applications installed on 
a file server can be accessed by the 
number of users that the purchased 
network license specifies. Purchas­
ing software this way is usually less 
expensive than purchasing individual 
copies.
• Reduced, secured, and centralized 
data management: With data stored 
on a central file server and access 
secured by restricting accessibility 
and editing features on a user by user 
basis, an organization can enforce 
strong passwords, maintain a backup 
schedule, and permit a single data 
file to be accessed and edited by mul­
tiple users.
• More extensive collaboration: Networks 
enable colleagues to communicate
and work as a team without time and 
location constraints.
There are also some risks when imple­
menting a network, for example:
• Loss of independence: Network users 
must follow the restrictions imposed 
by the network administrator.
• Loss of privacy: This risk applies to the 
use of any employer-owned equipment, 
not just the use of a network. If the 
employer owns the equipment, the em­
ployer owns the data on the equipment.
• Increased socialization resulting in a 
decrease in productivity: If e-mail and 
instant messaging are permitted on
a network, the social communication 
between employees usually increases. 
The result is a decrease in productiv­
ity. Often an employer will limit social 
networking features and even block 
Internet access.
Objective 3 | 
Implement Local Area 
Networks
As the Director of Sales for a hotel that is 
part of a global hotel chain, you want to 
expand your hotel’s conference facilities 
and Internet hot spots. You must make a 
presentation to the corporate Vice Presi­
dent of Sales to support your proposal to 
expand and upgrade the hotel’s network. 
Where do you start?
Recall that a LAN is a network of two 
or more computers, in a close geographi­
cal setting, connected together to facilitate 
communication with each other and with 
peripheral devices such as a printer or 
cable modem (Figure 15.8).
LANs transform individual hardware 
devices into what appears to be one gigantic 
computer system. From any computer on 
the LAN, you can access any data, software, 
or peripherals such as fax machines, print­
ers, or scanners that are on the network.
With a wireless LAN, users ac­
cess and connect to other devices on the 
network through radio waves instead of 
wires. Wireless LANs are useful when you 
need to move around in or near a building. 
In hotels, for example, wirelesses LANs 
notify housekeeping staff about room 
checkouts and bookings.

FIGURE 15.8 
Setting up a LAN in a hotel enables 
anyone in any room to access the connected devices 
located anywhere in the hotel.
Many wireless LANs ensure security 
with a radio transmission technique that 
spreads signals over a seemingly random 
series of frequencies. Only the receiving 
device knows the series, so it is not easy to 
eavesdrop on the signals. A conscientious 
user should still use encryption software 
to guarantee a higher level of protection. 
Wireless LAN signals have an effective in­
side range of between 125 and 300 feet but 
can be shorter if the building construction 
interferes with the signal.
Whether wired or wireless, LANs can 
be differentiated by the networking model 
they use: peer-to-peer or client/server.
Concept 15.05 Joining a Peer- 
to-Peer Network
In a peer-to-peer network (P2P), all of
the computers on the network are equals, 
or peers—that is where the term peer-to- 
peer comes from. They are generally used 
in small offices or home networks, do not 
require a NOS (network operating system), 
and can be set up through options available 
in current standalone operating systems.
On a P2P network, there is no central 
controlling unit; each computer user decides 
which files, directories, storage devices, 
printers, and scanners they want to share 
with other network users (Figure 15.9).
P2P networking gained notoriety when 
Napster, a peer-to-peer music file-sharing
FIGURE 15.9 
A peer-to- 
peer home network
site, was sued for copyright infringement.
Since then, other sites, like Kazaa and 
LimeWire, which claim their P2P network 
is just like sharing a music or movie CD 
with a friend, have also lost similar battles 
with the entertainment industry. Current 
proposed legislation is seeking to hold 
colleges and universities responsible for 
monitoring students’ download activity.
Additionally, ISPs are in contention with 
Web sites like BitTorrent, a P2P site that 
consumes large amounts of bandwidth by 
sharing videos and thus causing other us­
ers to experience excessive delays.
However, not everybody wants to stop 
P2P music swapping. Some artists offer 
free downloads hoping that fans will share 
the files with friends and buy more songs.
Some companies are even sponsoring 
music downloads that link their products 
with promising new groups and build 
goodwill as the music of the new group 
moves from computer to computer. The 
P2P network model is the foundation of 
legitimate companies like Skype (www. 
skype.com ) that uses P2P technology to 
provide voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) 
phone service to their users (Figure 15.10).
Ifyou decide to join a P2P network, 
give some thought to privacy and security.
Ifyou are a Skype user and you are not be­
hind a firewall, there is a good chance that 
your computer will be utilized as a super­
node without your knowledge. You might 
have to disable some security features on 
your system in order to make use of some 
offered features. Read all of the informa­

Concept 15.06 Connecting to 
a Client/Server Network
The typical corporate or university LAN 
is a client/server network, which in­
cludes one or more servers as well as 
clients (Figure 15.11). Some common 
servers on a client/server network include 
those that provide e-mail, file storage, 
database storage, and facilitate commu­
nication with other networks, including 
the Internet. A client can be any type of 
computer—PC, Mac, desktop, notebook, 
or even a handheld device—that is con­
nected to a network and contains the 
software that enables it to send requests 
to a server. It can connect via modem, a 
physical Ethernet connection, or a wire­
less connection. The client/server model 
works with any size or physical layout of 
LAN and does not tend to slow down with 
heavy use.
Concept 15.07 Recognizing a 
Virtual Private Network
Many businesses have extended their 
network structure from an intranet, a 
password-protected network controlled 
by the company and accessed by em­
ployees, clients, or vendors, to a virtual
private network (VPN). A VPN
operates as a private network over 
a public network, usually the In­
ternet, making data accessible to 
authorized users in remote locations 
through the use of secure, encrypted 
connections and special software 
(Figure 15.12).
Concept 15.08 Examining 
LAN Topologies
Network topology is the physical 
arrangement of computers in a local 
area network (LAN) and methods by 
which the arrangement manages the 
problem oi contention—the conflict 
that occurs when two computers try 
to access the LAN at the same time. 
Contention sometimes results in col­
lisions. the corruption of network 
data caused when two computers 
transmit simultaneously.
In a bus topology, every device 
is attached to a common cable or pathway 
referred to as the bus (Figure 15.13). At 
the end of the bus, a special connector 
called a terminator signifies the end of 
the circuit. In a bus topology, only one de­
vice can transmit at a time. If more than 
one device tries to send data at the same 
time, each device waits a small random 
amount of time and then attempts to re­
transmit the data. Other limitations of a 
bus topology include length restrictions 
because of the loss of signal strength and 
limits as to the number of attached de­
vices because of increases in contention 
caused by each added device. To resolve 
contention problems, networks use some 
type oi contention management—a 
plan of action to follow when a collision 
occurs. On the plus side, bus networks 
are simple, reliable, and easy to expand. 
The bus topology is practical in a rela­
tively small environment such as a home 
or small office.
A star topology solves the expansion 
problems of the bus topology with a cen­
tral wiring device, which can be a hub, a 
switch, or a computer (Figure 15.14). Add­
ing users is simple; you run a cable to the 
hub or switch and plug the new device into 
an available connector. Star networks also 
use a contention management plan to deal 
with collisions. The star topology is ideal 
for office buildings, computer labs, and 
WANs. The downside of a star topology is 
that the loss of the hub, switch, or central

network.
With a ring topology. all of the de­
vices are attached in a circular wiring 
arrangement. This topology is not in com­
mon use today. It provides a unique way to 
prevent collisions (Figure 15.15). A special 
unit of data called a token travels around 
the ring. A device can transmit only when 
it possesses the token. The ring topology 
is well-suited for use within a division of
a company or on one floor of a multi-floor 
office building.
Concept 15.09 Examining LAN 
Protocols
In addition to the physical or wireless 
transmission media that carry the net­
work’s signals, a network also uses pro­
tocols. Protocols are a set of standards or 
rules implemented by hardware, software, 
or a combination of the two, which enable

network-connected devices to communi­
cate with each other.
Protocols can be compared to the 
manners you were taught when you were 
a child. When you were growing up, you 
were taught to use appropriate comments, 
such as “It’s nice to meet you,” when you 
met someone in a social situation. The 
other person was taught to reply, “It’s nice 
to meet you too.” Such exchanges serve Lo 
get communication going. Network proto­
cols are similar. They are fixed, formalized 
exchanges that specify how two dissimi­
lar network components can establish a 
communication.
All of the communication devices in a 
network conform to differenl protocols. A 
single network may use dozens of protocols.
The complete package of protocols that 
specify how a specific network func­
tions is called the network’s protocol 
suite. The protocol suite is a compo­
nent of the network architecture— 
the design of the communication sys­
tem including the backbones, routers, 
switches, wireless access points, ac­
cess methods, and protocols.
Because they are complex com­
munication systems, networks use a 
network architecture that is divided 
into separate network layers. Each 
network layer has a function that can 
be isolated and treated separately 
from other layers. Because each 
layer’s protocol precisely defines how 
each layer passes data to another 
layer, it is possible to make changes 
within a layer without having to re­
build the entire network.
To understand the layer concept, 
remember that protocols are like good 
manners, which enable people to get com­
munication going.
For example, suppose you are send­
ing an e-mail message and imagine that 
each protocol is a person, and each per­
son has an office on a separate floor of 
a multi-storv office building. You are on 
the top floor, and the network connection 
is in the basement. When you send your 
message, your e-mail client software calls 
the person on the next floor down: “Ex­
cuse me, but would you please translate 
this message into a form the server can 
process?” The person on the floor below 
replies, “Sure, no problem.” That person 
then calls the person on the next floor 
down: “If it is not too much trouble, would 
you please put this translated message

in an envelope and address it to such- 
and-such computer?” And so it goes, until 
the message finally reaches the physi­
cal transmission medium, the hardware 
layer, which connects the computers in 
the network.
At the receiving computer, the op­
posite happens. The message is received 
by the hardware in the basement and is 
sent up through each layer. The message 
is taken out of its envelope, translated, 
and handed up to the top floor, where it is 
acted on.
To summarize, when sending a net­
work message it starts at the top of the 
protocol stack of layers and moves down 
through each layer until it reaches the 
bottom, physical medium. Because the 
layers are arranged vertically like the 
floors in an office building, and because 
each is governed by its own software, the 
layers are called a protocol stack. On 
the receiving end, the process is reversed: 
The received message goes up the protocol 
stack. First, the network’s data envelope 
is opened, and the data is repeatedly 
translated until it can be used by the 
receiving application. Figure 15.16 
illustrates this concept.
By far the most popular LAN standard 
for large and small businesses is Ethernet.
According to International Data Corpo­
ration (IDC), approximately 85 percent 
of all installed networks use versions of 
Ethernet.
Ethernet uses a protocol called car­
rier sense multiple access/collision de­
tection, or CSMA/CD. Using the CSMA/ 
CD protocol, a computer looks for an op­
portunity to place a data unit of a fixed 
size, called a packet, onto the network 
and then sends it on its way. Each packet 
contains a header that indicates the ad­
dress of the origin and destination of the 
data being transmitted. Every time a 
packet reaches its destination, the sender 
gets confirmation and the computer waits 
for a gap to open to send off another 
packet. Devices such as routers read the 
address of a passing packet and direct 
the packet along to the next device, 
routing it toward its destination. 
Occasionally, two devices send a packet 
into the same gap at the same time, 
resulting in a collision and the loss 
of both packets—but only for the mo­
ment. When packets collide, the comput­
ers that sent them are instantly 
notified, and each chooses a random 
interval to wait before it resends the 
packet. This approach helps prevent 
network gridlock.

Chicago's Museum of Science and In­
dustry has on display a modular urban 
home that is both smart and green. 
This house is networked to monitor 
gas, electric, and water to minimize us­
age and maximize comfort. In addition 
to being smart, the house is environ­
mentally friendly, and it is manufac­
tured and decorated from recycled and 
reusable resources. In homes like this, 
the electrical monitoring system will 
turn up the thermostat a few degrees 
or turn off the water heater to con­
serve energy. View a slide show of the 
Smart Home: Green + W ired at w w w

smart-home/. Houses like this are also 
being tested in Toronto and may be 
extended to Baltimore and Boulder in 
the future.
Although early versions of Ether­
net (called 10Base2 and 10Base5) used 
coaxial cable in bus networks, the most 
popular versions today are Ethernet star 
networks that use switches and twisted­
pair wire. Currently, three versions of 
Ethernet are in use: lOBase-T (10 Mbps), 
Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps, also called 
100Base-TX), and Gigabit Ethernet. The 
newest version, 10 Gigabit Ethernet, is 
making possible next-generation appli­
cations such as cloud computing, server 
virtualization, network convergence, and 
multicasting.
These superfast connections are often 
used to create large metropolitan and re­
gional networks because they prevent data 
bottlenecks. To learn more about Ethernet, 
check out Charles Spurgeon’s Ethernet 
Web site at h ttp ^ /w w w .etherm anage. 
co m /eth ern et/eth ern et.h tm l. The site 
covers all of the Ethernet technologies in 
use today and includes a practical guide 
for do-it-yourselfers. Figure 15.17 provides 
a comparison of several popular LAN 
protocols.
WiFi is a wireless LAN standard that 
offers Ethernet speeds through the use of 
radio waves instead of wires. Devices with 
WiFi technology need a wireless access 
point or a wireless router to communicate 
in general or access the Internet. Wire­
less routers sold for home use contain a 
wireless access point inside the router.
The router also has an omnidirectional 
antenna to receive the data transmitted 
by wireless transceivers. External WiFi 
transceivers connect to desktop comput­
ers through USB wireless adapters or PC 
adapter cards; however, today most lap­
tops are equipped with built-in wireless 
network adapters or with wireless capabil­
ity on their chipset.
WiFi uses the IEEE 802.11 wireless 
networking standard (Figure 15.18) and 
transmits on the 2.4-GHz or 5-GHz radio 
frequency band. There are currently 
three popular IEEE 802.11 standards.
The 802.1 lg standard is the most common, 
with 802.1 In and 802.11 r being the 
newest standards. IEEE 802.16e and 
IEEE 802.16 are becoming two promising 
technologies for broadband wireless access 
systems. Figure 15.19 displays the stan­
dards and the network for which each is 
best suited to serve.
Although WiFi is convenient, 
there are some security risks.

data. To safeguard your network, do the 
following:
• Always use firewall software and 
updated antivirus and antispyware 
software.
• Change the router’s default network 
name, also known as an SSID, and the 
default password.
• If possible, turn off SSID broadcast ing 
to avoid detection by hackers.
• Ensure your router’s software has 
been upgraded to the most recent 
version.
• Turn on WPA (WiFi Protected Access) 
to enable encryption.
• Turn on MAC (media access control) 
address filtering so only authorized 
devices can gain access.
Similarly, when using a public wire­
less Internet access location, known as a 
hot spot, you should take the following 
precautions:
• Be aware of your surroundings— 
ensure no one is watching over your 
shoulder for log-on and password 
information.
• Be sure to log on to the correct wire­
less network, not a look-alike or so- 
called evil twin network.
• Disable file and printer sharing.
• Do not transmit confidential data, 
but if you must do so, be sure to use 
encryption.
• Turn off your wireless access when it 
is not in use.
Whether wired or wireless, LANs en­
able an organization to share computing 
resources in a single building or across 
a group of buildings. However, a LAN’s 
geographic limitations pose a problem. 
Many organizations need to share com­
puting resources with distant branch of­
fices, with employees who are traveling, 
and with people outside the organization, 
including suppliers and customers. This 
is what wide area networks (WANs) are 
used for—to link computers separated by 
thousands of miles.

As the Director of Sales for a hotel that 
is part of a global hotel chain, corporate 
management liked your plan for a
networked regional calendar and wants 
to expand that idea into a weekly report 
on all business and conference bookings 
across the entire hotel chain worldwide.
You have been asked to assist in the 
implementation of the plan across the en­
tire global chain of hotels. You must study 
the differences between WANs and LANs 
and wired and wireless network security.
Where do you start?
Like LANs, WANs have all of the 
basic network components—cabling, 
protocols, and devices—for routing infor­
mation to the correct destination. WANs 
are like long-distance telephone systems.
In fact, much WAN traffic is carried by 
long-distance voice communication pro­
viders and cable companies. So you can 
picture a WAN as a LAN that has long­
distance communication needs among 
its servers, computers, and peripherals.
Special components of WANs differenti­
ate them from LANs—point of presence 
and backbones.
Concept 15.10 Defining 
a Point of Presence
To carry computer data over the long 
haul, a WAN must be locally accessible.
Like long-distance phone carriers or In­
ternet access providers, WANs have what 
amounts to a local access number, called 
a point of presence. A point of presence 
(POP) is a wired or wireless WAN net­
work connection point that enables users 
to access the WAN. To provide avail­
ability to it users, WANs have a POP 
in as many towns and cities as needed.
However, in many rural areas, POPs may 
still not be available, reducing a poten­
tial subscriber’s choices and ability to 
connect.
Concept 15.11 
Transmitting 
via Backbones
The LANs and WANs that make up the 
Internet are connected to the Internet 
backbone, which refers to the collection 
of high-capacity transmission lines that 
carry Internet traffic. A variety of physi­
cal media are used for backbone services, 
including microwave relays, satellites, and 
dedicated telephone lines. Some backbones 
are regional, connecting towns and cities 
in a region such as Southern California 
or New England. Others are continental, 
or even transcontinental, in scope 
(Figure 15.20).

those in transcontinental 
destinations.
Concept 15.12 Examining 
W A N  Protocols
Like any computer network, WANs use 
protocols. The Internet, the most popular 
WAN, uses more than 100 protocols that 
specify every aspect of Internet usage, 
such as how to retrieve documents through 
the Web or send e-mail to a distant com­
puter. Internet data can travel over any 
type of WAN because of Internet protocols. 
Collectively the Internet protocols are
called TCP/IP. an abbrevia­
tion for Transmission Con­
trol Protocol (TCP)/lnternet 
Protocol (IP).
The Internet Protocol 
(IP) is the lower and most 
fundamental layer of the 
TCP/IP suite of protocols.
It handles the addressing 
scheme embedded within 
each packet transmitted 
over the Internet enabling 
each packet to reach the 
correct destination. IP is 
a connectionless protocol; 
that is, two computers do 
not have to be online at the 
same time to exchange data. 
The sending computer just 
keeps trying until the mes­
sage gets through.
Because IP enables di­
rect and immediate contact 
with any other computer on 
the network, the Internet 
bears some similarity to the telephone sys­
tem, although the Internet works on dif­
ferent principles. Every computer on the 
Internet has a unique Internet address, 
or IP address, similar to a phone num­
ber. A computer can exchange data with 
any other Internet-connected computer 
by “dialing” its IP address. Currently an 
IP address, in Internet Protocol version 4 
(IPv4), is 32 bits long, written in decimal, 
and has four parts that are separated 
by periods such as 128.254.108.7. The

FCC's B r o a d b a n d  A c c ess T a r g e t
N etw orking and using the Internet for 
communication, education, and commerce 
will continue to increase. In a bid to en­
sure broadband access to all people in the 
United States within a decade, the Federal 
Comm unications Commission (FCC) has 
set a 4 Mbps download target for univer­
sal broadband. This project will cost $23.5 
billion. Although nearly 200 million Ameri­
cans had broadband access in 2009, there 
were still approximately 100 million that 
did not. The FCC plan is to plug the gaps 
in the current infrastructure and establish 
DSL, 4G wireless, or satellite coverage—
depending on the location— in underser­
viced areas.
Download speed of 4 Mbps is not fast by 
current standards, but for those with no ac­
cess or poor access, this will be an improve­
ment. Additionally, this plan seeks to provide 
improved service over the next decade to 
100 million homes in the United States by in­
creasing download speeds to 100 Mbps and 
upload speeds to 50 Mbps. The FCC project 
is just a goal and is not mandated. However, 
the plan should get a boost toward its goal, 
because Google plans to release its own 
1Gbps fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network in 
locations across the United States.

successor to IPv4 is IPv6 and is 128 bits

parts separated by colons such as 3ffe:190 
0:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf.
The Transmission Control Proto­
col (TCP) is the higher layer of the TCP/ 
IP layer of protocols that delines how one 
Internet-connected computer can contact 
another to exchange control and confirma­
tion messages. You can see TCP in action 
when you use the Web; just watch 
your browser’s status bar. You will 
see messages such as “Contact­
ing server,” “Receiving data,” and 
“Closing connection.”
WAN protocols are based on 
either circuit- or packet-switching 
network technology, but most use 
packet switching. The Internet uses 
packet switching, whereas the public 
switched telephone network (PSTN) 
uses circuit switching. Still, the In­
ternet does for computers what the 
telephone system does for phones—it 
enables any Internet-connected com­
puter to connect almost instantly 
and effortlessly with any other Inter­
net-connected computer anywhere in 
the world.
In circuit switching, the 
method used in the public switched 
telephone system, there is a direct 
connection between the communi­
cating devices. Data is sent over a 
physical end-to-end circuit between 
the sending and receiving comput­
ers. Circuit switching works best 
when avoiding delivery delays is 
essential. In a circuit-switching 
network, high-speed electronic 
switches handle the job of establish­
ing and maintaining the connection.
In packet switching, the 
method used for computer commu­
nication, no effort is made to create 
a single direct connection between 
the two communicating devices. The 
sending computer’s outgoing mes­
sage is divided into packets (Figure 
15.21). Each packet is numbered 
and addressed to the destination 
computer. The packets then travel 
to a router, which examines each 
packet it detects. After reading the 
packet’s address, the router consults 
a table of possible pathways that the 
packet can take to get to its destina­
tion. If more than one path exists, 
the router sends the packet along 
the path with the least congestion.
The packets may not all take the same 
path or arrive in the order they were sent, 
but that is not a problem. On the receiving 
computer, protocols put the packets in the 
correct order and decode the message they 
contain. If any packets are missing, the re­
ceiving computer sends a message request­
ing retransmission of the missing packet.
So which type of switching is best? 
Compared with circuit switching, packet

ETAfter reading the packet’s address, the router consults a table of possible paths to 
the packet's destination. If more than one path exists, the router sends the packet 
along the path that is least congested.
On the receiving computer, 
protocols put the packets 
in the correct order and 
decode the message 
they contain.
Dear Carol,

switching has many advantages. It is more 
efficient and less expensive than circuit 
switching. Additionally, packet-switching 
networks are more reliable. A packet- 
switching network can function even if 
portions of the network are not working.
Packet switching has some drawbacks. 
When a router examines a packet, it delays 
the packet’s progress by a tiny fraction 
of a second. In a huge packet-switching 
network—such as the Internet—a packet 
may be examined by many routers, which 
introduces a noticeable delay called 
latency. If the network experiences 
congestion (overloading), some of the 
packets may be further delayed, and the 
message cannot be decoded until all of its 
packets are received. For these reasons, 
packet switching is not well suited to the 
delivery of real-time voice and video.
Objective 5 | Set Up 
a Home Network
As the Director of Sales for a hotel that 
is part of a global hotel chain, you have a 
new laptop computer and iPad to use when 
you are away from your office. In your of­
fice, you have a desktop computer that is 
hard-wired to the Internet but you want 
to use your portable devices on your patio, 
in your home office, and while traveling. 
Where do you start?
Setting up a home network is not 
difficult, and the advantages are well 
worth the effort. By the end of 2012, it
is estimated that there will be more than 
160 million home networks in place world­
wide, and as many as 70 percent of them 
will be using wireless technology. A home 
network, also referred to as a home 
area network or HAN, is a personal and 
specific use of network technology that 
provides connectivity between you and 
devices located in or near your residence.
It enables you to quickly and conveniently 
share files and resources by using net­
work connections between computers and 
peripheral devices. In a HAN, the connec­
tions between devices can be wired, wire­
less, or a combination of the two.
Concept 15.13 Clarifying 
Wired Home Networks
A wired network is the network of choice 
for those that transfer large files where 
speed is a priority. Wired home networks 
are not as popular due to the inconve­
nience of physically pulling wire to each 
device on the network and the low cost of 
a wireless network setup. Still, learning 
to set up a network and understanding 
how it works can be helpful, because most 
home networks are a hybrid network—a 
combination of both wired and wireless 
technology (Figure 15.22).
Ethernet, the communication stan­
dard for home networks, uses packets to 
send data between physically connected 
computers in a network. The most popular 
type of Ethernet wiring is twisted-pair 
wire. Home networks use either the Cat-5 
or Cat-6 version of twisted-pair wire.
FIGURE 15.22 
The 
hybrid home network usually 
includes a wired network 
router that contains a 
wireless access point.
724 
GO! All In One | Chapter 15: Computer Networks and Communication

These wires are connected 
by RJ-45 connectors, which 
look like large telephone 
jacks. Cat-5 wire transfers 
data at speeds of up to 100 
Mbps; Cat-6 transfers data 
at speeds of up to 1,000 
Mbps (1 Gbps).
The simplest form of 
Ethernet network links 
different computers with 
a connecting switch or 
router. See Figure 15.23 
for an example of a simple 
Ethernet network. In this 
example, the computer 
can send a message to the 
notebook or the printer by 
way of the router. Routers 
and switches are available 
in many configurations.
Most have 4 to 12 ports.
The majority of home net­
works use a 100Base-TX 
router that is capable of 
a transfer rate of 100 Mbps (100 million 
bits per second). A more expensive option 
is to upgrade to a lOOOBase-T router with 
a transfer rate of 1 Gbps. Also known as 
gigabit Ethernet, lOOOBase-T is useful 
when transferring large amounts of data, 
such as digital multimedia.
In an Ethernet network, each net­
worked computer must have an Ethernet 
network adapter, also called a network 
interface card (NIC). Most newer comput­
ers already include a NIC, but a NIC can 
also be installed as an expansion card on an 
older system.
Concept 15.14 Simplifying 
Wireless Home Networks
Although several wireless network stan­
dards are currently available, WiFi is the 
wireless standard used for home network­
ing. Established wireless network stan­
dards ensure that companies that build 
wireless connecting devices do so in com­
pliance with strict definitions and rules. 
Ultimately, three factors determine which 
standard best suits your needs—the cost 
of the hardware or software, the speed at 
which data can travel over the network, 
and the range within which you can reli­
ably transmit between devices.
Ilome WiFi networks are wireless net­
works in which each computer on the net­
work broadcasts its information to another 
using radio signals. WiFi networks use

communications devices called network 
access points, also referred to as wire­
less access points (Figure 15.24), built 
into home wireless routers, to send and 
receive data between computers that 
have wireless adapters. Network access 
points enable you to move a laptop with 
a wireless adapter from room to room or 
to place computers in different locations 
throughout a house.
A peer-to-peer relationship exists 
among all of the computers in most wire­
less home networks. This means that all 
the computers are equals, or peers, with no 
particular computer acting as the server. 
However, some home wireless networks can 
also be of the client/server type. In a client/ 
server home network, each computer com­
municates with the server, and the server 
then communicates with other computers 
or peripherals. All peripherals in a wireless 
network must be within the router’s range, 
which is usually 100 to 300 feet, depending 
on the building’s construction and thickness 
of the walls, floors, and ceilings.
WiFi networks use the 802.11 wire­
less transmission specifications. Although 
some older systems may still use the

capable of data transfer rates of up to
54 Mbps. The 802.1 In can operate in both 
the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio band, and 
the average data transfer rate is about 
300 Mbps.
Wireless networks are gaining in 
popularity because of their ease of setup 
and convenience. There are no unsightly 
wires to run through the home, and 
you are no longer limited to working 
in just one location. However, there 
are some disadvantages to wireless 
networks:
• Newer laptop computers are usually 
equipped for wireless access, but older 
notebooks may require the addition of 
a wireless adapter card.
• Wireless networks may be affected 
by interference from other devices 
such as microwave ovens and cord­
less phones. Additionally you might 
find that reception can be a problem 
if the radio waves are unable to pass 
through interior walls.
Security slot
• Conversely, because 
radio waves are able to 
pass through walls, it 
is important to take ap­
propriate measures to 
safeguard your privacy 
from someone passing 
by outside your home.
In the future, home 
network systems will al­
most certainly be wireless 
and have the capability 
to adapt to new tech­
nologies as they develop. 
Currently, knowledge of 
both wired and wireless 
technology is essential to 
seamlessly integrate con­
venience, simplicity, and 
long-term cost savings.

Understand Data 
Transmission
As the Director of Sales for a hotel that is 
part of a global hotel chain, you are updat­
ing your sales presentation for business and 
corporate clients to include an overview of 
the network capabilities of your conference 
center. Your understanding of such techni­
cal terms like bandwidth and throughput 
must be refined and phrased in such a way 
that clients of all technology levels are com­
fortable with this portion of your sales pre­
sentation. Where do you start?
Communication is the process of 
electronically sending and receiving mes­
sages between two or more computers or 
devices regardless of the distance between 
those devices. The sending device initi­
ates the transmission, while the receiving 
device accepts the transmission and re­
sponds. Communications can be split into 
two parts: the message—also referred to 
as data, information, or an instruction— 
and the communications channel also 
referred to as the link. The communica­
tions channel is the transmission media 
over which the message is sent from one 
location to another.

Real-world 
analog signal
Digital signal
Digital signal
Real-world 
analog signal
Signals in the real world, like sound 
and light, are analog signals—continuous 
waves that vary in strength and quality. 
Before these real-world signals can be 
used by digital equipment, like a com­
puter, the signal must pass through an 
analog-to-digital converter. An analog- 
to-digital converter (ADC) is simply 
a microchip that contains the circuitry 
to convert an analog signal into a digital 
signal. A digital signal is one that in­
cludes discontinuous pulses in which the 
presence or absence of electronic pulses is 
represented by Is and Os. In reverse, when 
a computer signal must be sent out to 
the real world, for example as sound, the 
digital signal must pass through a digital- 
to-analog converter. A digital-to-analog 
converter (DAC) is a microchip that 
contains the circuitry to convert a digital 
signal to analog (Figure 15.25).
In communications, both analog and 
digital signals move data over communica­
tions channels. The conversion from analog 
to digital or digital to analog is normally 
not something you can detect or must be 
concerned with. However, ifyou have ever 
scanned an image, recorded your voice, 
used VoIP on your computer, or talked 011 
a phone, you used an analog-to-digital con­
verter. Likewise, ifyou have ever listened 
on the phone or played a CD. you made use 
of a digital-to-analog converter.
A codec, short for code-decode algo­
rithm, is responsible for the conversion 
between analog and digital signals. Codecs 
accomplish the conversion by sampling the 
analog signal several thousand times per 
second. A common audio codec, the G.711 
codec, samples the audio 64,000 times 
a second. It then converts each sample 
into digitized data and compresses it for 
transmission. When the samples are reas­
sembled, the missing pieces between the 
samples go undetected by the human ear. 
The most common codec for VoIP samples 
the analog signal 8,000 times a second. Be­
cause a digital signal is discrete, composed 
of 0s and Is that are sampled from an 
analog signal, the data arrives in a much 
clearer format. The receiving end knows 
exactly how to reconstruct the data back 
into its original form (Figure 15.26). Digi­
tal signals also transfer much more data 
than analog and at much greater speeds. 
For instance, digital TV systems can now 
deliver more than 500 stations across digi­
tal cable.
Concept 15.15 Assessing 
Bandwidth
Bandwidth refers to the theoretical maxi­
mum amount of data that can be trans­
mitted through a given communications 
channel at one time—usually per second.

Two factors affect bandwidth: the physi­
cal characteristics of the transmission 
medium and the method used to represent 
and transmit the data. For analog sig­
nals, bandwidth is expressed in cycles per 
second, or hertz (Hz). For digital signals, 
bandwidth is expressed in bits per second 
(bps). Throughput, often used incorrectly 
as a synonym for bandwidth, is the actual 
amount of data that is transmitted. It is 
almost always lower than bandwidth, es­
pecially with wireless communications.
Broadband is a communication 
transmission that uses a wide band of 
frequencies to transport high volumes 
of data at high speeds, typically greater 
than 1 Mbps megabits per second (Mbps). 
Cable TV uses broadband transmission. 
So how much bandwidth do you need? 
Conventional dial-up connections to the 
Internet use a relatively low bandwidth 
of 56 Kbps or less. Although cheaper, 
most users find this painfully slow when 
searching the Web. Through the practi­
cal comparisons provided in Figure 15.27, 
you should get an idea of what increased 
bandwidth can do for such Internet activi­
ties as streaming music or video. Stream­
ing is the ability to hear or see content 
while it is being downloaded from a Web 
site instead of waiting until the download 
is complete.
Consider the following guide:
• For normal use, from most providers,
1 Mbps offers the best balance be­
tween cost and performance.
• For e-mail and viewing Web pages but 
not streaming audio or video, then 256 
Kbps to 512 Kbps is adequate.
• For gaming, a 2 Mbps connection or 
faster is necessary.
• To share a connection between two or 
more computers, a minimum of a
4 Mbps connection is necessary to 
take advantage of music or video 
on demand or digital broadband 
Internet TV.
Broadband digital connections are widely 
available in the United States. A study 
in June 2010 indicated that 62 percent of 
broadband subscribers in the United States 
subscribe to a wireless broadband plan.

fields generated by other devices like

electric motors and power lines. Twisted­
pair is an inexpensive medium with band­
width too low to simultaneously carry video, 
voice, and data. Twisted-pair wiring carries 
data at transfer rates of less than 1 Kbps.
Concept 15.17 Reviewing 
Variations of Twisted-Pair
Cat-5 cable, short for Category 5, is the 
fifth generation of twisted-pair data com­
munication cable. Cat-5 cable contains 
four pairs of twisted-copper wire and 
supports speeds up to 100 Mbps over a 
maximum distance of 100 m (328 feet). 
However, only two of the four pairs of 
wires are actually used for most network 
communications. A newer variation of the 
Cat-5 cable, Cat-5e, short for Category 5 
enhanced, uses all four wire pairs, en­
abling speeds up to 1.000 Mbps (1 Gbps) 
over a short distance. This enhanced me­
dium is backward compatible with ordi­
nary Cat-5 (Figure 15.28).
Cat-6. short for Category 6, is the 
sixth generation of twisted-pair cable and 
is backward compatible with Cat-5 and 
Cat-5e. It contains four pairs of copper 
wire like the previous generation, utilizes 
all four pairs, supports speeds up to 1 
gigabit per second (Gbps), expands avail­
able bandwidth from 100 MHz for Cat-5e 
to 200 MHz, and has superior immunity 
from external noise.
Concept 15.18 Advancing to 
Coaxial Cable
Coaxial cable, familiar to cable TV 
users (Figure 15.29), consists of a center

copper wire surrounded by insulation, 
which is then surrounded by a layer of 
braided wire. Data travels through the 
center wire, and the braided wire provides 
a shield against electrical interference 
(Figure 15.30). Coaxial cable carries data 
at transfer rates of up to 52 Mbps to an 
Internet service provider but no more 
than 10 Mbps to individual computers. In 
contrast to twisted-pair, coaxial cable al­
lows for broadband data communications. 
Your home is probably already wired with 
coaxial cable ifyou subscribe to a cable TV

data by means of pulses of light. 
Fiber-optic cable (Figure 15.31) 
provides transfer rates of 10 Gbps 
(gigabits per second) or more. A sin­
gle fiber-optic strand is composed of 
three parts: the core, the cladding, 
and the buffer coat (Figure 15.32). 
The core is a thin glass or plastic- 
center through which the light 
travels. The cladding is the optical 
material surrounding the core that 
reflects the light back into the core. 
The plastic coating that protects the 
fiber from moisture and damage is 
the buffer coat. Besides increased 
speed, additional benefits of fiber-optic 
cable include:

access point, which sends and receives data 
between computers that contain wireless 
adapters. Access points are usually built into 
wireless routers. Wireless media is essential 
in situations where installing cables is im­
possible, the costs of wired media are prohib­
itive, or the popularity of portable computing 
devices mandates a wireless environment.
• Light pulses are not affected by ran­
dom radiation in the environment.
• Fiber-optic lines have a significantly 
lower error rate.
• Fiber-optics can span longer distances 
before needing expensive repeaters to 
boost the signal.
• Security breaches in a 
fiber-optic line can be 
easily detected.
• As compared to coaxial 
cable, installation is sim­
plified due to the reduced 
weight and size of fiber­
optic cable.
Wireless media do not use solid 
substances like twisted-pair, 
coaxial, and fiber-optic cables to 
transmit data. Rather, wireless 
media send data through air or 
space using infrared, radio, or 
microwave signals. To use these 
wireless transmission media, a 
computer system must also use a special com­
munications device called a wireless
Cladding —

Concept 15.20 Understanding 
Infrared
If you use a remote control to change tele­
vision channels, you are already familiar 
with infrared signaling. Infrared is a 
wireless transmission medium that carries 
data via beams of light through the air. No 
wires are required, but the transmitting 
and receiving devices must be in line of 
sight or the signal is lost. When the path 
between the transmitting and the receiv­
ing devices is not obstructed by trees, hills, 
mountains, buildings, or other structures, 
infrared signals can work within a maxi­
mum of about 100 feet.
To use infrared 
technology with your 
computer system, you 
need an IrDA (infra­
red data association) 
port (Figure 15.33). You 
may have encountered 
an IrDA port on a mo­
bile computing device 
or wireless peripheral 
such as a PDA, digital 
camera, laptop, mouse, 
printer, or keyboard. 
Wireless technology, and 
to some degree Blue­
tooth, has replaced this 
technology.
Concept 15.21 
Reviewing 
Radio Transmissions
Radio transmissions offer an alternative to 
infrared transmissions. You probably have 
experienced one type of radio transmission 
by listening to your favorite radio station. 
But you may not realize the impact that 
radio waves have on your daily life or on 
society in general. All kinds of gadgets— 
from cell and cordless phones to baby 
monitors—communicate via radio waves. 
Although humans cannot see or otherwise 
detect them, radio waves are everywhere.
With radio transmission, data in 
a variety of forms like music, voice con­
versations, and photos travels through 
the air as radio frequency (RF) signals or

radio waves via a transmitting device and 
a receiving device. Instead of separate 
transmitting and receiving devices, radio 
transmissions can also use a wireless 
transceiver, which is a combination trans- 
mitting-receiving device equipped with an 
antenna. Data transfer rates for wireless 
devices have the potential to reach up to 3 
Mbps for cell phones and up to 250 Mbps 
for wireless networks.
A major disadvantage of radio trans­
mission is susceptibility to noise and 
interference. One of radio’s advantages 
is that radio signals are effective at both 
long range between cities, regions, and 
countries and short range within a home 
or office.
WiFi is a popular wireless network 
technology that uses radio waves to pro­
vide high-speed Internet and network con­
nections for home systems, laptops, video 
game consoles, and other enabled wireless 
devices. WiFi can be based on any of the 
IEEE 802.11 standards and communi­
cates through radio frequency technology, 
with ranges reaching 300 to 500 feet. The 
cornerstone of a WiFi system, like other 
wireless systems, is the access point that 
broadcasts a signal that devices equipped 
with wireless network adapters detect.
Bluetooth is a short-range radio 
transmission technology that does not 
require direct line of sight and has 
become very popular in recent years 
(Figure 15.34). Bluetooth technology relies 
on a network called a piconet or a PAN 
(personal area network) that enables all 
kinds of devices—desktop computers, mo­
bile phones, printers, pagers, PDAs, and 
more—within 30 feet of each other to com­
municate automatically and wirelessly.
Concept 15.22 Managing 
Microwaves
Microwaves are the upper part of the 
radio frequency spectrum and are electro­
magnetic radio waves with short frequen­
cies that travel at speeds of 1 to 10 Mbps. 
Microwaves are used to transmit data 
from a source Lo a receiving site in wire­
less PANs like Bluetooth, wireless LANs 
like WiFi, wireless MANs, and wireless 
WANs. Using relay stations similar to 
satellite dishes, including an antenna and 
transceiver, microwave signals are sent 
from one relay station to the next. Micro­
waves get weaker as they get farther away 
from their source, must travel in a straight 
line, and cannot be obstructed by buildings,
m
OJ
hills, and mountains. Thus, relay stations 
are positioned approximately every 
30 miles—the line-of-sight distance to 
the horizon—or closer if the terrain blocks 
transmission. To avoid obstacles, micro­
wave relay stations are often situated on 
the tops of buildings or mountains (Figure 
15.35). Microwaves are used in weather 
monitoring, air traffic control, speed limit 
enforcement, and missile 
guidance systems.
The advantages of microwave trans­
mission include the elimination of a wired 
infrastructure, enabling cellular telephone 
networks and connectivity in areas where 
the use of physical wires is impractical or 
impossible, and providing security through 
encrypting data as it is transmitted.

Disadvantages include the 30-mile line-of-

magnetic interference, and costs of maintain­
ing the multitude of relay stations it takes to 
transfer messages across long distances.
Concept 15.23 Investigating 
the Use of Satellites
Satellites are essentially microwave relay 
stations in space positioned in a geosyn­
chronous orbit that matches the satellite’s 
speed to that of the Earth’s rotation. Thus, 
satellites are permanently positioned 
with respect to the ground below. Data is 
transmitted by sending and receiving mi­
crowave signals to and from Earth-based 
stations (Figure 15.36).
Direct broadcast satellite (DBS) is 
a consumer satellite technology that uses 
a reception dish to receive digital signals 
at microwave frequencies directly from 
geostationary satellites broadcast at a 
bandwidth of 12 Mbps. Increasingly, DBS 
operators offer Internet access as well as 
digital TV service. The delay caused by the 
distances that data must travel in a satel­
lite Internet connection is called latency.
A good overview of a DBS can be 
found at w w w .groundcontrol.com /

htm . Broadband access is still not avail­
able in many rural or other low-population 
areas, so many of these areas are prime 
candidates for DBS.
What is it about wireless connectivity 
that is so interesting? Well, one answer is 
that wireless technology removes place- 
specific restrictions—the need to be in a 
certain place to receive a service. Some
forms of wireless technology allow you to 
be wherever you choose and still have the 
ability to be connected.
Concept 15.24 Communicating 
Via the Public Switched 
Telephone Network
Although many components of the 
conventional phone system have been 
enhanced, until all devices have been 
replaced with digital equivalents, limita­
tions still exist.
The public switched telephone 
network (PSTN) is the global telephone 
system, a massive network used for data 
as well as voice communications, com­
prising transmission media ranging from 
twisted-pair wire to fiber-optic cable. Some 
computer users derisively (and somewhat 
unfairly) refer to the PSTN as plain old 
telephone service (POTS). The derision 
comes from most analog telephone lines 
being based on standards that date back 
more than a century. Although a few 
parts of the PSTN remain based on ana­
log communications, many sections of the 
system have been switched over to digital 
communications.
Those still using analog devices 
today include many homes and small 
businesses. These telephones are linked 
to subscriber loop carriers by means of 
twisted-pair wires. A subscriber loop 
carrier (SLC) is a small, waist-high curb- 
side installation that connects as many 
as 96 subscribers; you have probably seen 
one in your neighborhood. The area served 
by an SLC is called the local loop. When 
the analog signal reaches the SLC, it is 
converted to digital form and remains that 
way throughout the PSTN network.
From the SLC, the digital signals are 
routed via high-capacity fiber-optic cables 
to the local exchange switch, a digital 
device capable of handling thousands of 
calls located in the local telephone com­
pany’s central office (CO). From the local 
phone company’s CO, the call can go any­
where in the world. It can continue on 
the digital portion of the PSTN’s fiber­
optic cables or be converted to radio 
waves and sent out over cellular networks 
(Figure 15.37).
Although analog connections still ex­
ist, digital telephony, a system in which 
the telephones and transmissions are 
digital, is the trend. Compared with ana­
log devices, which are prone to noise and

interference, digital phones 
offer noise-free transmission 
and high-quality audio.
Because long-distance 
lines must handle thou­
sands of calls simultane­
ously (32 calls per second,
24 hours a day, 7 days a 
week in the United States), 
a technique called mul­
tiplexing is used to send 
more than one call over a 
single line. The electrical 
and physical characteristics 
of copper wire impose a limit of 24 multi­
plexed calls per line, whereas fiber-optic 
cables can carry as many as 48,384 digital 
voice channels simultaneously. In contrast 
to the analog local loop, most long-distance 
carriers use digital signals so that they 
can pack the greatest number of calls into 
a single circuit.
The last-mile problem is the term 
that refers to the inability of homes or 
businesses to access the PSTN’s high­
speed fiber-optic cables and the bottleneck 
of data on the last mile of twisted-pair 
phone lines that connect homes and 
businesses.
However, with telephone companies 
replacing analog local loop technology with 
digital technology such as FiOS, the last- 
mile problem might soon be solved in your 
neighborhood!
residence. This last 
section of the circuit is 
referred to as the last 
mile. Technologies that 
help bridge that gap, 
known as last-mile 
technologies, include 
digital telephone stan­
dards such as DSL that 
use twisted-pair wiring, 
as well as high-speed 
wired services such as 
coaxial cable and FiOS 
(Figure 15.38).
Digital subscriber line (DSL), an­
other method of Internet access available 
in the United States, is also called xDSL. 
This term refers to a group of related 
technologies, including ADSL (asymmet­
ric digital subscriber line), SDSL (sym­
metrical digital subscriber line), HDSL 
(high bit-rate digital subscriber line), and 
VDSL (very high bit-rate digital subscriber 
line)—all forms of Internet ac­
cess. DSL technologies, in gen­

features of each type of DSL presented in 
Figure 15.39 provides clarification.
To use DSL, you must have a DSL 
phone line and a DSL service subscription. 
Unlike conventional telephone service, 
which is available to almost any home, DSL 
service is limited by the distance from the 
CO, or telephone switching station, to your 
home. You also need a DSL modem. which 
is similar to a traditional telephone mo­
dem in that it modulates and demodulates 
analog and digital signals for transmission 
over communications channels. However, 
DSL modems use signaling methods based 
on broadband technology for much higher 
transfer speeds. DSL service is now stan­
dardized so that almost any DSL modem 
should work with the wiring your telephone 
provider uses. However, it is best to buy 
a DSL modem that your provider recom­
mends. Although DSL service is more ex­
pensive than dial-up, it is usually cheaper 
than other broadband access options, such 
as cable or fiber-optics (Figure 15.40)
Internet access via cable-based broad­
band is usually provided by your local 
cable TV company. This type of Internet 
access reached approximately 41 million 
subscribers in the United States in 2009.
When cable and cabling equipment 
for TV were originally installed in homes, 
signals ran in only one direction—to the 
home. When the Internet became popular, 
the cable companies invested tremendous 
amounts of money in equipment and cable 
to enable two-way communication to cap­
ture the Internet market.
For computer users, these services 
offer data transfer rates that exceed the
speed of DSL. Cable modems, devices 
that enable computers to access the In­
ternet by means of a cable TV connection, 
now deliver data at bandwidths of 1.5 to
6 Mbps or more, depending on how many 
subscribers are connected to a local cable 
segment. Bandwidth across a cable con­
nection is shared among subscribers who 
are connected to the cable company in 
local groups. Ifyou are lucky enough to 
have subscribers in your group who do not 
use much bandwidth, you can experience 
impressive speed—up to 20 Mbps—while 
using the Internet.
Gaining in popularity as a last-mile 
technology is fiber-optic cable. Fiber-optic 
service, or FiOS, is not currently available 
in many rural areas but in suburbs and 
outlying areas of cities where the instal­
lation of fiber-optic cable is less difficult 
to install, this option is becoming more 
popular.
A leased line, sometimes called a 
dedicated line, is a connection set up by 
a telecommunication carrier and is usu­
ally a permanent fiber-optic or telephone 
connection that enables continuous, 
end-to-end communication between two 
points. Larger organizations, such as 
ISPs, corporations, and universities, con­
nect using leased T l lines, which are 
fiber-optic or specially conditioned copper 
cables that can handle 24 digitized voice 
channels or carry computer data at a rate 
of up to 1.544 Mbps. If the Tl line is used 
for telephone conversations, it plugs into 
your phone system. If it is carrying data, it 
plugs into the network’s router. The price 
ofTl lines ranges from $1,000 to $1,500 a

As the Director of Sales for a hotel th a t is 
part of a global hotel chain, you have been 
asked for additional input regarding the 
plans to enhance electronic communica­
tions in the hotel’s guest rooms and confer­
ence facilities. You w ant to stay ahead of 
your competition, so you w ant to review 
current requests and also include new 
technologies and incorporate the capability 
to connect future devices into the expan­
sion design. W here do you start?
The world of wired and wireless appli­
cations is receiving more attention every 
day. You cannot open a magazine, su rf the 
Web, or watch TV w ithout seeing ads for 
the latest wireless solutions.
Concept 15.26 Experiencing 
Internet Telephony
Internet telephony is the use of the In­
ternet for real-tim e voice communication, 
commonly known as VoIP (Voice over In ­
ternet Protocol) . You can place calls via 
the Internet in a variety of ways, but first 
you will need a com puter equipped with 
a microphone, speakers or headphones, 
an Internet connection, and a telephony- 
enabled application such as Skype. From 
December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010, 
Skype has increased registered users from 
474 million to 663 million and had net 
revenues increase from $719 million in 
2009 to $860 million in 2010. Visit www. 
skype.com  for the latest inform ation and 
charges for this service.
The basic idea of In tern et telephony 
has an enorm ous advantage—the Internet 
does not rely on sw itches to route mes­
sages like the PSTN does, and it is cheaper 
to operate. Providers can route dozens, 
hundreds, or even thousands of calls over 
the sam e circuit. M any conventional phone 
companies already send voice calls over 
the Internet. You may have actually expe­
rienced VoIP w ithout even knowing it.
If you and the person you are calling 
have a digital video cam era or a w ebcam . 
you can converse through real-tim e video­
conferencing. A webcam is an inexpensive, 
low-resolution digital video cam era th a t 
is integrated into a notebook com puter or

sits on top of a com puter m onitor. Vide­
oconferencing , also called Web confer­
en c in g , is the use of th is digital video 
technology to tran sm it sound and video 
images to facilitate online, virtual m eet­
ings through which two or more people 
can have a face-to-face m eeting even 
though they are geographically separated 
(Figure 15.42). To learn more about tele­
phone technology from w iring a system  to

Stream ing video was not practical 
for home viewing before broadband and 
cheap, powerful com puters became avail­
able for the home m arket. Now, stream ing 
video sites such as YouTube are some of 
the m ost visited sites on the Internet. As 
popular as YouTube is for viewing videos, 
it has a file size limit of 2GB. An altern a­
tive to viewing clips of your favorite tele­
vision program s on YouTube is In tern e t 
TV —the ability to view television shows, 
videos, and movies over the Internet, 
for no additional cost, via download or 
stream ing video. The benefit of this type 
of viewing over YouTube is th a t the con­
ten t is provided by the original source, so 
copyright is not an issue; there is no lim it 
on length; you have a variety of selections 
from which to choose; and there is no time 
restriction on when you m ust watch the

Concept 15.28 Considering 
Satellite Radio, GPS, and More
M any applications use satellite technol­
ogy, including air navigation, TV and radio 
broadcasting, and videoconferencing. 
S a te llite  radio broadcasts radio signals 
to satellites orbiting more than 22,000 
m iles above the E arth. The satellites then 
tran sm it the signals back to a radio re­
ceiver. U nlike ground-based radio signal 
tran sm itters, satellite radio is not affected 
by location, distance, or obstructions. Be­
cause of their great height, satellites can 
tran sm it signals to a radio receiver w her­
ever it m ight be located.
Sirius XM Radio Inc. is one of the larg­
est satellite radio subscriptions companies 
providing more than 100 channels of dif­
ferent genres, including continuous music, 
sports, news, and talk programs. Satellite 
radio uses portable receivers th a t plug 
into your home or car stereo, so it is totally 
mobile and transportable to wherever you 
happen to w ant to listen. Sirius now
offers Backseat TV, which 
stream s live TV broadcasts 
to subscribers who have 
video receivers in their 
vehicles.
H ughesNet is a nation­
wide provider of high-speed 
Internet by satellite. After 
your satellite dish is in­
stalled, you can send and 
receive secure Internet ac­
cess through your satellite 
modem (Figure 15.44).
G PS (Global Position­
ing System ) is another 
example of satellite technol­
ogy. It functions through a 
cluster of 27 Earth-orbiting 
satellites (24 in operation 
and 3 extras in case one 
fails). Each of these 3,000- to 
4,000-pound solar-powered 
satellites circles the globe 
at an altitude of 12,000 
miles, m aking two complete 
rotations every day. The 
orbits are arranged so that 
at anytime, anywhere on 
E arth, at least four satellites 
are “visible’' in the sky. A 
GPS receivers job is to locate four or more 
of these satellites, figure out the distance to 
each, and use this information to deduce its 
own location. Most systems are accurate to 
within 109 yards; some systems boast a 164- 
yard range (Figure 15.45).
A GPS receiver can be either handheld 
or installed in a vehicle. N avigation sys­
tem s in rental cars are a typical applica­
tion of GPS. O nStar is a m ultifaceted GPS 
communications system  th a t enables driv­
ers to talk to a service representative to 
obtain driving directions and information 
on hotels, food venues, and the like. Driv­
ers can also use O nStar to notify the po­
lice, lire departm ent, or am bulance service 
in case of an emergency. Through in-vehicle 
sensors, it can even detect when a car 
has been involved in an accident. Finally, 
O nStar can also aid a driver experiencing 
minor inconveniences, for exam ple, by un­
locking car doors should a driver acciden­
tally lock car keys inside (Figure 15.46).
GPS units for cars have become more 
mobile. Many different models can be easily 
attached to a dashboard and moved from 
one vehicle to another. Some units can even 
convert maps from road maps to walking 
maps that list house num bers and specific 
points of interest. You can update the

G PS devices can be extremely useful to 
individuals who are lost, trying to navi­
gate through an unfamiliar neighborhood, 
' or looking to avoid a traffic jam. But this 
same technology can also be viewed as 
an invasion of privacy. Taxi cab drivers in 
New York City are protesting against the 
installation of G PS units in all cabs citing 
the fear of constant surveillance. Large
trucking firms are using units to keep 
track of drivers and inform them of alter­
nate shorter routes or possible delays 
while in route. Some see the use of G PS 
units as a technological advance in provid­

together of products such as PCs and tele­
phones. This trend could be signaling the 
end of the traditional public switched tele­
phone network.
C ellular telephones are computing 
devices. Although cell phones started out 
as analog devices (1G, for first genera­
tion), the current generation of wireless 
cell phones (4G, for fourth generation) are 
all digital system s th a t provide high-speed 
access to tran sm it voice, text, images, and 
video data. They are now referred to as 
sm artphones and integrate mobile phone 
capability, com puting power, and Web 
access. For more inform ation, dates, and 
features of each cell phone technology gen­
eration, refer to Figure 15.47.
In 1971, AT&T built a network of 
tran sm itters th a t autom atically repeat 
signals. This netw ork of transm itters, 
which are called cell sites. broadcasts 
signals throughout specific, but limited, 
geographic areas called cells. When call­
ers move from cell to cell, each new cell 
site autom atically takes over the signal to 
m aintain signal strength. But who or w hat 
monitors your cell phone’s signal strength 
so th at you have the best reception? That's 
the job of the m obile sw itch in g  center 
(MSC). and each cellular netw ork contains 
several MSCs th at handle com m unications 
w ithin a group of cells (Figure 15.48). Each 
cell tower reports signal strength to the 
MSC, which then sw itches your signal to 
w hatever cell tower will provide the 
clearest connection for your conversation.

MSCs route calls to the gateway 
mobile switching center (GMSC), which 
in turn sends calls to their final destina­
tion. If the call is headed for a land-based 
phone, the GM SC sends the call to the 
PSTN. Otherwise, it forwards the call di­
rectly to another cellular network.
Terrain, weather, antenna position, 
and battery strength can all interfere and 
affect signal strength. However, there
may be times when you have recharged 
your battery, have clear weather, and are 
standing at the top of a hill— and still can­
not achieve a good signal. Cell coverage 
is not perfect, and cellular networks have 
holes— areas in which you can’t send or 
receive calls.
MSCs are also key players in a widely 
used cellular service called SM S—short 
messaging service—which you probably

Chapter Summary
Com puter Networks and 
Communication
• C om puter netw orks link two or more com puters so 
they can exchange data and share resources.
• Local area networks (LANs) serve a building or 
an equivalent region. Wide area netw orks (WANs) 
span m ultiple buildings, states, and nations. A 
WAN can be viewed as a geographically dispersed 
collection of LANs. Additional network designations 
include the m etropolitan area network (MAN), the 
cam pus area network (CAN), the home area net­
work (H A N ), and the personal area network (PAN).
• A peer-to-peer LAN does not use a central control 
unit. It is m ost appropriate for sm all netw orks of 
fewer th an  10 com puters. C lient/server networks 
include one or more file servers as well as clients 
such as desktops, notebooks, and handheld devices. 
A virtual private netw ork operates as a private 
netw ork over a public netw ork, usually the Inter­
net, m aking data accessible to authorized users
in rem ote locations through the use of secure, en­
crypted connections and special software.
• The physical layout of a LAN is called its network 
topology. The three different LAN topologies are 
bus (single connections to a central line), star (all 
connections to a central switch), and ring (tokens 
carry m essages around a ring).
• Protocols are the rules th a t define how network de­
vices can communicate w ith each other. The most 
widely used LAN protocol for wired netw orks is 
E thernet. The most commonly used wireless proto­
col is 802. llg .
• WANs and LANs have all the sam e basic 
com ponents—cabling, protocols, and routing 
devices. But a WAN is different in th a t it has a 
backbone, high-capacity transm ission lines, and 
points of presence—connection points th a t enable 
users to access the network.
• WAN protocols include circuit sw itching and 
packet switching. C ircuit sw itching creates a
perm anent end-to-end circuit th a t is optim al for 
voice and real-tim e data. Packet sw itching does 
not require a perm anent sw itched circuit and can 
funnel more data through a m edium  w ith a given 
d ata tran sfer capacity.
• Home area networks can be w ired, w ireless, or
a hybrid and have a peer-to-peer or client/server 
relation.
• Bandw idth refers to the m axim um  data transfer 
capacity of a communications channel and is m ea­
sured in H ertz (Hz) and bits per second (bps).
• To tran sm it digital data over dial-up phone lines, 
it is necessary to use a modem. On the sending 
end, the modem m odulates the signal (transform s 
it into analog form). On the receiving end, the mo­
dem dem odulates the signal (transform s it back 
into digital form).
• Com m unications require physical m edia, like 
tw isted-pair wire, coaxial cable, and fiber-optic 
cable, or wireless media like infrared, radio, m i­
crowaves, and satellite. A dditionally, WiMAX and 
MMDS are wireless technologies used to transm it 
signals over large geographic areas.
• The public switched telephone netw ork (PSTN) is 
the global telephone system  used for both data and 
voice. This system  usually sends transm issions 
across media ranging from tw isted-pair to fiber­
optic cable and m akes use of a modem to convert 
between analog and digital signals.
• Last-m ile technologies refer to th e technologies, 
like DSL, cable, leased lines, SONET, FIOS, 
and WiMAX, th at bring data into your home or 
business.
• W ired and wireless applications like VoIP, GPS 
system s, videoconferencing, fax transm issions, and 
satellite radio help com m unicate, collaborate, en­
tertain, and share text, graphics, audio, and video.
• Convergence refers to the use of technology to 
facilitate the coming together of products such as 
PCs and telephones.

Teamwork
1. Your Cam pus Area N etw ork As a team , or in 
subgroups, interview  th e IT sta ff a t your college 
and inquire about the physical layout of your cam ­
pus network (CAN). How m any local area networks 
(LANs) are connected? W h at is th e topology of 
each LAN? Are all LANs w ired, or are some w ire­
less? How many routers/sw itches/hubs compose the 
CAN? W hat netw ork operating system  is running 
the CAN? Ask these and any additional questions 
th at help you understand the configuration of your 
school’s netw ork. U sing M icrosoft’s Visio or any 
o ther draw ing program , create a diagram  of the 
CAN. Subm it the diagram  and a one-page, double­
spaced paper th a t com bines the questions asked 
and the answ ers received th a t led to your network 
diagram .
2. Toys to Tools As a team , investigate the use of 
cell phones in the area of education. Use your own 
school as an example. Inquire about courses and in­
structors that use cell phones or other digital tech­
nology in th e ir classroom s like blogs, w ikis, and 
tweets. Investigate how they incorporate it into the 
subject m atter. Use online references for additional 
exam ples and ideas. As a group, come up with a list 
of five w ays in w hich cell phones (including text 
and picture m essaging) or other digital technology
can be helpful in learning. P resen t your best five 
in a PowerPoint presentation and indicate w hether 
the team  felt the idea w as w orkable and how it 
would help or h inder learning. Rem em ber to cite 
your references.
3. Creating Your Own B usiness Assume the mem­
bers of your team  are going to create a small busi­
ness selling item s on e-Bay for individuals th at are 
not com puter confident. Come up w ith a company 
nam e, statem en t of policy, services th a t you will 
provide, and fees th a t you will charge. Initially, 
there will be three individuals in th is sm all busi­
ness: a secretary, an e-Bay expert, and a photog­
rap h er th a t will take im ages of th e products and 
post them  on e-Bay. As a team , decide w hether a 
wired, w ireless, or hybrid netw ork would best suit 
this com pany and its th re e  em ployees. Use any 
draw ing program  th a t th e team  m em bers are fa­
m iliar w ith to create a diagram  of your dream  of­
fice suite. Include the num ber of rooms needed, the 
com puter equipm ent needed by each individual, 
and a schem atic of the ideal netw ork. M ake sure 
the diagram  is detailed and clearly labeled. U sing a 
word processor, organize all of this inform ation into 
a one-page, double-spaced report. Subm it both your

Web to obtain the education and/or certifications re­
quired, the level or years of experience needed, and 
a range of possible salaries for this type of position. 
Compile your information in a word processing doc­

3. Technology and Your R esponsibility GPS units 
were instrum ental in locating and leading to the res­
cue of an experienced hiker lost in the A ustralian des­

D eath Valley National Park in California in A ugust 
2009 is blam ing a GPS unit for providing her with 
faulty directions that led her and her son to a desolate 
and extremely remote region of the park. After several 
days, she and her son depleted their w ater supply. Her 
11-year-old son died. She places blame on the GPS pro­
vider. Using the Internet and other reliable forms of in­
formation, research cases in which technology helped 
people and cases in which it has been used inappro­
priately or relied on when common sense should have 
prevailed. When is an incident the fault of the provider 
and when is it the fault of the hum an operator? W hat 
are the lim its of technology and whose responsibil­
ity is it to know those lim its? W hat can the technol­
ogy provider do to disclaim responsibility? W hat can 
the user do to validate reliability of, in the case of the 
Death Valley episode, navigational instructions? Pres­
ent your findings and opinions in a one-page, double­
spaced report. Remember to cite your references.
Ethics and Social Media
1. H iring a Ilacker Although the practice has been 
going on for some time, the ethics of hiring a former 
hacker as a security consultant always seems to be 
a touchy issue. There are strong opinions on both 
sides. U sing th e In te rn e t and any o th er reliable 
sources of research, locate two hackers th a t have

Objective 1 | Create a OneNote Notebook
OneNote is a M icrosoft application with which you can create a digital notebook that gives you a single 
location where you can gather and organize inform ation in the form  o (notes. A note can include typed text, 
handw ritten text ifyou have a tablet PC, pictures and graphics—including images and text that you capture from 
W eb pages—audio and video recordings, and docum ents from other applications such as W ord or Excel.
The advantage to using O neN ote—instead of paper notes and notebooks—for all of your inform ation is 
that you can use powerful search capabilities to find inform ation in your notebook quickly. You can also share a 
O neN ote notebook with others, or store your notebook on the Web so that you can view and edit your notes from 
any com puter with an Internet connection.
Activity 16.01 
Exploring OneNote
OneN ote is an integrated part of M icrosoft Office 2 0 10, so if you are fam iliar with the M icrosoft Office 
system, you will recognize the Ribbon and tab layout as being sim ilar to w hat you have used in W ord, Excel, and 
so on. You will also see that m any of the form atting com m ands you use in these applications perform  similarly in 
OneNote. In this activity, you will exam ine the elem ents o f the O neN ote window.
1 
On the W indow s taskbar, click the Start button O , and then locate and open Microsoft OneNote 2010.
2  C om pare your screen with Figure 16.2, and then lake a m om ent to study the O neN ote w indow  elements 
described in the table in Figure 16.3.
In OneNote, a notebook is a collection o f liles organized by major divisions and stored in a com m on folder. 
O neNote includes one pre-made notebook named Personal, which contains one section— the General section. A 
section is the prim ary division o f a notebook, identifying a main topic and containing related pages o f notes. A page 
is a subdivision o f a section w'here notes are inserted. T h in k  o f a section just like the tabbed sections you would have 
in a three-ring notebook, and think o f a page just like the paper pages you have in a notebook.

It can be difficult to find the exact notes you want when you have a lot of information stored in notebooks. 
Note tags can help you locate specific information quickly. A note tag is both a descriptive term representing a 
category, such as Important or To Do, and a related icon that can be associated with a specific note.
Activity 16.13

list, click the Food Safety Project page tab.

container.
