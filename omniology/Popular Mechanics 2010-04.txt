what 
do you 
think?
Coal Fired 
I agree with your hypothesis 
from ‚Äúe Myth of Clean Coal.‚Äù 
It‚Äôs simply an oxymoron; by its 
very nature coal is dirty. e 
government also creates 
monÔ¨Ürous waÔ¨Üe by requiring 
ethanol addition to gasoline and 
by subsidizing other alterna-
tives that make no Ô¨Ånancial 
sense. e vocal and irrational 
drive to do these things has a 
negative economic impa. 
More of us need to obje to 
these impositions. anks for 
the attention to such matters.

Robotic AÔ¨Äection 
I truly enjoyed Erik Sofge‚Äôs 
February Ô¨Üory, ‚ÄúCan Robots 
Be TruÔ¨Üed?‚Äù e author, 
however, seemed a little 
surprised by the idea that 
people would rea positively 
to a robot‚Äôs Ô¨Çuttering eyes and 
other social features. I would 
point out that sociology, 
anthropology and psychology 
all reveal that humans do this 
quite regularly with animals‚Äî
people consider them friends 
and attribute anthropomor-
phic qualities to them. So if 
humans fall in love with 
animals, why not fall in love 
with robots? 
JERRY ROSONKE
MANSFIELD, SD
I enjoyed your Ô¨Üory on robots 
and agree we should be 
concerned about machines that 
give the outward appearance of 
feeling and thought, but do not 
aually feel or think. Morality 
derives from the assumption of 
mutuality of experience: If I hurt 
another person, he feels pain as 
I would; if I am kind to him, he 
feels pleasure as I would. Is it 
wise to create insensate 
objes toward which we will 
dire our aÔ¨Äeions when 
these objes have no experi-
ence of empathy?
e creation of conscious-
ness is so diÔ¨Écult that some 
artiÔ¨Åcial-intelligence research-
ers seem to take the attitude, 
‚ÄúIf I can create a machine that 
appears to love me, does it 
matter whether it aually 
does?‚Äù We muÔ¨Ü consider the 
implications of robots without 
true consciousness, and 
prepare to adjuÔ¨Ü our culture 
and moral codes accordingly.

‚Üí Human beings have been Ô¨Üaring at the conÔ¨Üel-
lation Ursa Major, which contains the Ô¨Üar group 
commonly called the Big Dipper, for thousands of 
years, but it Ô¨Üill holds a few secrets for aÔ¨Ürono-
mers. With the naked eye, ancient sky watchers in 
Arabia could see that one of the Dipper‚Äôs seven 
Ô¨Üars, Mizar, has a companion called Alcor. Over 
the centuries, improving telescopes revealed 
more Ô¨Üars in the cluÔ¨Üer. Late laÔ¨Ü year, two 
independent teams of aÔ¨Üronomers deteed a 
sixth Ô¨Üar near Mizar in the middle of the conÔ¨Üel-
lation‚Äôs handle, bringing the total number of Ô¨Üars 
in the Big Dipper to 12.  ‚Äî JOE PAPPALARDO

A seismic Ô¨Üudy begun over a decade ago has Ô¨Ånally 
settled a long-Ô¨Üanding debate about the source of 
YellowÔ¨Üone‚Äôs geothermal heat, and suggeÔ¨Üs there‚Äôs much 
more magma lurking in the subterranean supervolcano than 
previously thought. GeophysiciÔ¨Üs funded by the National 
Science Foundation used data from 200 seismic sensors that 
measured the waves from 800 earthquakes between 1999 
and 2005 to trace the magma. Since seismic waves travel 
more slowly through hot rock than cold, the researchers were 
able to outline the shape of a magma pit, located 400 miles 
below the surface, that curls about 150 miles northweÔ¨Ü of the park. e Ô¨Ånding 
contradis claims that a shallow pool of churning rock fuels YellowÔ¨Üone‚Äôs 
volcanism, and means any future eruption will be more severe.  ‚Äî ALEX HUTCHINSON

e two moÔ¨Ü observant scouts

e civilian mechanics at Annis-
ton Army Depot in Alabama 
usually only Ô¨Åx vehicles for the Army, 
not design them for the Marine Corps. 
But as Marines push into conteÔ¨Üed 
areas of AfghaniÔ¨Üan, their engineers 
face a persiÔ¨Üent threat from roadside 
bombs. e mechanics at AnniÔ¨Üon 
saw they could build a safe ride for 
these military engineers by adding 
oÔ¨Ä-the-shelf equipment to an M1A1 
Abrams battle tank. e result, called 
the Assault Breacher Vehicle (ABV), 
maximizes the depot Ô¨ÜaÔ¨Ä‚Äôs experi-
ence at Ô¨Åxing the M1A1 and their 
ability to mount heavy engineering 
equipment, including a 12-foot 
plough, onto its hull. e Army 
donated excess tank parts from its 
inventory to create the ABV. 
A	er about two years of trials and 
training, the Marine Corps delivered 
the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü ABVs late laÔ¨Ü year to 
southern AfghaniÔ¨Üan, where they 
quickly saw aion clearing improvised 
explosive devices (IEDs) from the 
roads leading to the Taliban Ô¨Ürong-
hold of Now Zad in Helmand province. 
e Breacher crew‚Äôs preferred 
method of clearing the roads involves 
shooting an MK155 linear charge‚Äîa 
nylon rope beaded with 1750 pounds 
of explosive C4‚Äîso that it lies across 
the unpaved roadway, and then 
detonating the line to create a safe 
path more than 300 feet long and 50 
feet wide. e syÔ¨Üem was designed 
in the 1960s to defeat pressure-
fused mines, but is Ô¨Ånding a new use 
in clearing IED-infeÔ¨Üed roads. 
Intercepted enemy radio transmis-
sions, quoted in a Marine Corps 
release, indicate that the enemy Ô¨Çed 
Now Zad as the explosive Ô¨Ürings 
erupted, saying, ‚ÄúGet out, the big 
boom is coming!‚Äù

When Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü responders arrive at 
a mine disaÔ¨Üer or a building 
collapse, communicating with viims or 
other rescuers is usually impossible 
because radio waves can be blocked by 
metal, earth and Ô¨Üone. Even sites with 
low-frequency emergency radio syÔ¨Üems 
suÔ¨Äer from slow data transfer that 
reÔ¨Üris use to simple text messages. 
But a novel syÔ¨Üem being developed by 
Ferro Solutions of Woburn, Mass., 
transmits voice signals with magnetic 
waves that travel through solid matter 
more easily than do radio signals. 
Typical radios send signals on 
eleromagnetic waves that oscillate at 
speciÔ¨Åc frequencies. Engineers at Ferro 
developed a portable communicator 
that translates these undulating waves 
into signals carried by magnetic Ô¨Åelds 
with resonant frequencies that 
compatible radios can pick up through 
hundreds of yards of obÔ¨Üruions. e 
digital voice signal Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü passes through a 
transducer made of a composite that 
melds piezoeleric material (which 
generates a voltage when it deforms) 
with a magnetoÔ¨Üriive metal (which 
changes shape when it‚Äôs exposed to a 
magnetic Ô¨Åeld). e transducer converts 
the radio signals into magnetic ones; 
another reverses this process when the 
signals reach the other radio.

can use to clear

rescue operations 
at mass casualty

gineers equipped 
with these radios 
could Ô¨Üay in con-

2.   Magnetic waves pass easily through hundreds of yards of solid material.

which he hears as a voice, and he responds with his position.

 Smart bicycle wheels have regenerative braking, 
which can charge a battery when the rider brakes, 
providing power to an eleric motor. But a brilliant bike 
wheel, like the one created by MIT researchers, can also 
report data about the world it rides through.  e 
Copenhagen Wheel, named for its initial teÔ¨Üing ground, 
communicates wirelessly with an iPhone mounted on 
the handlebars to measure speed, diÔ¨Üance and 
pollution.  And if a thief tries to Ô¨Üeal it, the wheel locks 
and sends a text message to its owner.  ‚Äî A.H.

2005. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve told the Haitian govern-

it could produce a 7.2 magnitude event 
or larger,‚Äù Calais says. ‚ÄúUnfortunately our 
number is fairly close to what happened.‚Äù 
Earthquakes can‚Äôt be prevented, but 
even impoverished nations can prepare 
for them. For the moÔ¨Ü part, Haiti failed 
to take aion. ‚ÄúYou can identify the few 
buildings that are critical‚Äîthat have to 
Ô¨Üand up in the face of a large earth-
quake, like hospitals and schools, from

Port-au-Prince that collapsed was a

Grim Viory for 
Rocket Rebels
 
Ending months of speculation, 
President Barack Obama in Feb-
ruary released his plan for NASA‚Äôs 
future‚Äîa plan without a return to 
the moon. e budget kills all 
spending on the ConÔ¨Üellation 
program, a Bush adminiÔ¨Üration plan 
to build a cra called the Ares I to 
deliver supplies and Ô¨ÜaÔ¨Ä to the 
International Space Station. 
According to the axed plan, a second 
heavy-launch syÔ¨Üem called Ares V 
would be used for longer trips to the 
moon, aÔ¨Üeroids or Mars. NASA critic 
Ross Tierney should have been 
overjoyed to hear the news of 
ConÔ¨Üellation‚Äôs demise. Tierney 
teamed with moonlighting NASA 
engineers to create 
an alternative they 
called Jupiter Dire. 
(PM covered the 
debate in February 
2009.) e rival 
design reuses space 
shuttle parts to save 
development time and coÔ¨Üs. 
Tierney‚Äôs hopes that the adminiÔ¨Üra-
tion would embrace the Dire plan 
were bolÔ¨Üered when he was invited 
to a meeting at NASA to present the 
scheme to agency oÔ¨Écials. But when 
the adminiÔ¨Üration released its 
budget‚Äîtwo weeks aer the 
January meeting‚ÄîDire was also 
seemingly rejeed. e budget slates 
$3.1 billion of research funds to 
inveÔ¨Üigate a new heavy-li rocket, so 
unless Congress or a big contraor 
adopts the Dire plan‚Äôs design, it will 
be as dead as the Ares vehicles it was 
meant to replace. ‚Äî DAVE NOLAND
e 2009 teÔ¨Ü launch of NASA‚Äôs 
Ares 1 may be its only Ô¨Çight.

good Samaritan to jump-Ô¨Üart your vehicle are the times you are

 Considering all the hype and specula-
tion that preceded the launch of the 
Apple iPad, it‚Äôs easy to be let down by its 
shortcomings: No webcam? No Flash 
support? No SD card slot, no multitask-
ing? Another deal with AT&T?
But to focus on the quibbles ignores 
the larger significance of the machine. 
The iPad succeeds mightily at carving 
out a niche in personal computing where 
there was none before‚Äîa light-duty 
media and reading device with all-day 
usability (Apple claims 10-hour battery 
life) that is far more portable than a lap-
top (1.5 pounds, 0.5 inches thick), yet 


more capable than a smartphone.
Remarkably for Apple, the iPad‚Äôs 
hardware design is somewhat conserva-
tive‚Äîessentially a large-format iPod 
Touch. Yet the 9.7-inch 1024 x 768 pix-
el, multitouch screen makes reading 
e-books, watching movies and viewing 
photos a far more satisfying experience 
on the iPad than on its smaller cousin.
The iPad may not seem so revolu-
tionary for long, however. Unlike the 
iPhone, which was two generations 
ahead of other smartphones when it 
was launched, the iPad is simply the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü 
big player in what is bound to be a 
crowded category by the end of the year. 
The multitouch user interface on the 
iPad is slick, but there are other touch-
friendly operating systems out there 
(Android, Windows 7), and Apple‚Äôs not 
the only company with tablet dreams.

lighting can) come 
with a 20-watt 
speaker built right 
in. e speaker 
units are 
completely 
contained: ey 
require no wiring, 
receiving their 
signal from the 
base Ô¨Üation over  
a 2.4-GHz 
radio-frequency 
conneion. Volume 
and lighting are 
controlled via a 
small remote  
that can handle 
two zones.

Counter
Viewer
 A gloriÔ¨Åed 
alarm clock? 
Sorta. An 
app-capable 
tablet? Kinda. A 
kitchen-ready 
digital recipe 
viewer? Perhaps. A 
touchscreen 
piure frame? At 
times. Enter the 
curious case of the 
Sony Dash 
($200)‚Äîa 7-inch, 
Wi-Fi-enabled 
touchscreen device 
designed to Ô¨Üream 
information (such 
as news, weather 
and recipes) and 
handle lightweight 
apps and games. 
Sure, there‚Äôs little 
this thing can do 
that can‚Äôt be done 
on countless other 
gadgets, but 
between the 
bedside table, 
kitchen counter 
and living room 
coÔ¨Äee table, we‚Äôre 
going to bet that 
not even Sony 
knows all the uses 
people will come 
up with for it. 
Finer  
Grinder
 Between 
grinding down 
welds, knocking 
ruÔ¨Ü oÔ¨Ä salvaged 
ironwork and 
shearing oÔ¨Ä bolt 
shas, the 6-inch 
angle grinder sees 
its share of grit. 
e engineers at 
Fein discovered 
that when the 
tool‚Äôs power 
switch is exposed 
to this damaging 
detritus, it can 
eventually seize up 
and cease to 
funion. For the 
Fein WSG 
14-150T ($250), 
they solved the 
problem with an 
unusual switch 
that aivates via a 
pinch to the tool‚Äôs 
opposite sides.

 GREENER CLEANER 
Made using nontoxic ingredients 
in a secret Manhattan lab, Green 
Depot‚Äôs home-brewed cleaners 
reduce ecological impact as well 
as elbow grease. The recipe for 
the window cleaner eschews 
ammonia and alcohol in favor of 
‚Äúcompletely biodegradable surfac-
tants,‚Äù and the tub and tile cleaner 
works its fume-free magic through 
the power of a low-pH organic salt.
  THE  
 REEL DEAL 
Dual gears Ô¨Üore 
energy the way a 
Ô¨Çywheel does in the 
blades of Fiskars‚Äô 
new Momentum 
mower, which 
devours debris that 
would jam a typical 
reel. e blades also 
Ô¨Üay sharper‚Äî
revolving and 
Ô¨Üationary blades 
oen collide on 
each turn, but these 
work like scissors, 
passing each other 
at 0.003 inches. 
Clever blade-spool 
design lets the 
mower Ô¨Çush-cut 
edges typically 
trampled beneath 
the wheels. 
  SYCAMORE  
 SYRINGE 
e Deep Drip 
1-inch-diameter 
Ô¨Üake delivers 
water and fertilizer 
where they‚Äôre 
needed: to tree 
roots, via a 
perforated hollow 
spike hammered  
2 feet into the soil 
surface. A Ô¨Üudy  
by Cal State‚Äì
Fresno‚Äôs Center  
for Irrigation 
Technology found 
the Ô¨Üake to be 
more eÔ¨Äeive 
than surface  
water at 
saturating the  
root zone while 
reducing runoÔ¨Ä 
and soil erosion.
  GET IN 
 ON THE  
 GRAYWATER 
MoÔ¨Ü graywater 
draining from a 
sink or shower can 
be reused, with a 
little scrubbing, as 
garden irrigation. 
Few syÔ¨Üems 
accomplish this 
task as simply as 
the one from US 
HydroTech, which 
pumps graywater 
through layers of 
Ô¨Åltration media to 
clear the water of 
soap and debris 
without chemical 
treatments. 
Developer Ed 
Bertain claims the 
syÔ¨Üem can handle 
up to 69.3 gallons 
per person, per 
day. Combine it 
with a colleion 
tank, which can 
also be set up to 
catch rainwater.

 SUPER CAULK 
This spray-foam latex seals gaps too big for caulk to Ô¨Åll. Installers
use a gun rigged to a mixing machine to blast Energy Complete
into framing transitions, such as where plates and joists meet. And
while caulk loses its hold under pressure changes, latex permits a
bit of building movement‚Äîenabling it to withstand the big bad wolf
of blower-door tests. Plus, it installs faster than ‚Äúa guy with just a
little tube,‚Äù Owens Corning‚Äôs Karel Czanderna says.

 MainÔ¨Üreamer
It‚Äôs no longer a surprise when a new Hyundai is fully competitive with other vehicles 
in its class. Hyundai certainly builds solid vehicles, and the all-new Tucson rolls in the 
crowded and competitive crossover pack. Riding on a 103.9-inch wheelbase and 
Ô¨Üretching 173.2 inches long overall, the new Tucson Ô¨Åts right in with other players 
such as the Honda CR-V. Every Tucson gets a 176-hp 2.4-liter Four, and moÔ¨Ü will be 
paired to a six-speed automatic. e engine is relatively smooth and delivers its power 
seamlessly. e rear-seat legroom is generous for the class. It‚Äôs comfortable and 
reÔ¨Åned, but a little unexciting‚Äîin sum, it‚Äôs normal. Hey, we‚Äôve been spoiled by some 
really brilliant Hyundais lately, including the Genesis Coupe.  ‚Äî JOHN PEARLEY HUFFMAN

Conceptual Brilliance
e basic engineering concept of 
the Audi e-Tron goes back at leaÔ¨Ü 112 
years to young Ferdinand Porsche‚Äôs Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü 
design, the 1898 SyÔ¨Üem Lohner-
Porsche that put eleric motors in each 
of the four wheel hubs. And that‚Äôs 
essentially how the e-Tron is built. Audi 
trimmed down an R8 chassis for this 
concept, swapping out the V8 engine for 
100 lithium-ion cells Ô¨Üacked juÔ¨Ü behind 
the cockpit. Press the Ô¨Üart button and 
the information screen rises in front of 
the driver. No sound. No indication that 
the car is ready to move. No nothing. But 
snick the shi wand into ‚Äúgear‚Äù and 
lightly touch the accelerator, and the 
e-Tron really moves‚Äîthe four motors 
combine to produce 313 hp. At speed 
you hear a pronounced whoosh and whir 
as those motors spool up. It turns out 
the audio-eÔ¨Äes engineers in every 
Hollywood sci-Ô¨Å movie were right about 
the sound eleric cars would make in 
the future. Expe to see a produion 
version by 2012.  ‚Äî J.P.H.

Ô¨Üretches to see if Kawasaki‚Äôs new 
136-hp Z1000‚Äôs overseas-Ô¨ÜreetÔ¨Åghter 
Ô¨Çavor hits a sweet spot on our soil. 
Dew-dampened leaves littered the 
roughly paved coil of road. And without 
the luxury of adjuÔ¨Üing the suspension, 
the Z1000 initially felt too tightly wound. 
Turn-in was abrupt, and the chassis felt 
unsettled midcorner, leading us to tread 
cautiously on these unfamiliar twiÔ¨Üies. 
Fine-tuning the suspension, however, 
tamed much of the bike‚Äôs edginess, 
enabling us to push the $10,499 Z1000 
hard over some of SoCal‚Äôs beÔ¨Ü

well-suited to the engine. Short gear

PM‚ÄôS RESIDENT ASTRONAUT 
SAYS DRASTIC BUDGET  
CUTS LEAVE NASA ON A 
PATH TO NOWHERE. 
resident Obama released his Ô¨Åscal year 2011 
budget on Feb. 1, and his policy for NASA‚Äôs human 
spaceÔ¨Çight program puts the nation on a course to 
second-class status in space. Instead of setting our 
national sights on the moon, nearby asteroids or 
more distant destinations such as Mars, the presi-
dent is declaring that human spaceÔ¨Çight is unim-
portant to U.S. interests.
He‚Äôs not saying so directly. But his budget 
actions speak loudly. He has canceled NASA‚Äôs 
next-generation Constellation program, including 
the Orion spacecraft and the two rockets that were 
designed to return American explorers to deep 
space (see ‚ÄúMission: Moon,‚Äù March 2007). 
A little history: In the past 20 years, under three 
different administrations, NASA has lost more 
than 25 percent of its buying power. Despite those 
cuts, the agency managed to operate the shuttle 
and build the International Space Sta-
tion (ISS). But it lacked a long-term 
goal in space. That lack of direction 
and the failure to replace the vulnera-
ble shuttle led in part to the Columbia 
accident in 2003 that killed seven of 
my colleagues. 
Now, seven years later, the budget 
shows that the president has already

Space Station, 2001.

forgotten the lessons of Columbia. 
Without a goal worthy of the serious 
risks of human spaceÔ¨Çight, we will 
be putting our astronauts in danger 
to do nothing more than crew a 
research outpost. Even though I 
helped build the space station, it is 
not an ultimate destination. The ISS 
is merely a steppingstone to more 
ambitious exploration.
It is true that President Obama 
inherited a Constellation program‚Äî 
a return to the moon and deep 
space‚Äîthat the Bush administration 
had underfunded by more than 35 
percent since its inception in 2004. 
Because of that lack of support, Con-
stellation is badly behind schedule. 
Those delays also raised costs for the 
development of the Ares I booster. Yet 
in October NASA successfully Ô¨Çew an 
early version of Ares I. While not a 
long-term successor to the shuttle, 
this rocket, with adequate funding, 
could be in service to the ISS by 2015, 
restoring our own access to space. 
The new budget seems merely an 
attempt to disguise the demise of U.S. 
leadership in space. The president 
does away with the Orion spacecraft 
and its Ares I and Ares V rocket boost-
ers. The abrupt cancellation of the 
Constellation program means the 
U.S. no longer wishes to send its 
explorers to the frontiers of knowl-
edge and the heights of space-faring 
skill. We are deliberately choosing to 
have no better space capability than 
Russia, China or India.
During the peak of the shuttle pro-
gram in the 1990s, we launched six or 
seven shuttles and about 40 astro-
nauts per year into orbit for scientiÔ¨Åc 
and defense purposes. Starting next 
year, and for the foreseeable future, 
just four Americans will make it into 
space annually‚Äîas passengers on 
foreign rockets. Is this a bold new 
course for the nation?
After the shuttle orbiters retire, by 
early 2011, American astronauts will 
rent seats on Russian rockets headed 
to the space station. We won‚Äôt Ô¨Åeld an 
alternative spacecraft for Ô¨Åve years or 
more. Instead, the president will farm 
out the nation‚Äôs access to low Earth 
orbit to commercial Ô¨Årms. None of the 
industry rockets NASA has ordered to 
deliver cargo to the ISS has yet Ô¨Çown, 
and betting our nation‚Äôs sole access to 
space on industry‚Äôs ability to replicate 
50 years of NASA experience on the Ô¨Çy 
is unwise. The agency should Ô¨Åeld its 
new crewed spacecraft as quickly as 
possible, then move to commercial 
Ô¨Årms once they have a proven record 
of reliable cargo services. 
While NASA hopes its commercial 
effort will produce a ship that can 
service the ISS, the end of Constella-
tion defers indeÔ¨Ånitely the building 
of a heavy-lift rocket. Without such a 
Saturn V‚Äìclass launcher, Americans 
will never get out of low Earth orbit 
(where we have been marooned for 
nearly 40 years). Instead, the Ares V 
heavy lifter has been replaced with 
‚Äúresearch and development‚Äù on 
building such a vehicle‚Äîsomeday. 
With no ability to launch humans 
past the ISS, we will watch, helpless 
to follow, as China pursues its deter-
mination to be the next nation to 
send its explorers into deep space. 
The president‚Äôs rejection of a clear 
goal to send humans into deep space 
by a date certain eliminates a future 
in space for the brightest of our young 
scientists and engineers. The space- 
talent pool began emptying this win-
ter, as promising innovators turned 
to careers in other industries. What 
student would pursue a career in 
space science or astronautics with the 
knowledge that the country deems 
leadership in space unimportant? 
The president appointed his 
Augustine Committee last May to 
review the nation‚Äôs human spaceÔ¨Çight 
plans. Of their recommendations, he 
accepted the move to put our human 
access to space on a commercial foot-
ing, with great uncertainty as to safety, 
schedule and cost. If this effort fails, 
the nation has no backup plan.
But the president rejected the most 
important of the Augustine observa-
tions‚Äîthat a great nation must fund 
an exploration program worthy of its 
vision. In fact, the committee recom-
mended an extra $3 billion per year to 
renew NASA‚Äôs human exploration 
efforts. The president‚Äôs team, how-
ever, chose to add only a billion dol-
lars annually, missing a chance to 
remedy past underfunding and take 
the U.S. forward in space. Although 
the administration borrowed $787 bil-
lion last year for stimulus spending, 
Ô¨Ånding $3 billion this year to stimu-
late our high-tech economy and talent 
pool proved impossible. 
By proposing a budget for NASA 
that barely exceeds inÔ¨Çation, and fail-
ing to renew a commitment to send 
the U.S. beyond low Earth orbit, the 
administration is turning away from 
the dominance in space technology 
America has enjoyed since Apollo. 
This nation once put its confident 
footprints on the moon. Following 
the president‚Äôs misguided course, we 
will trudge in retreat from the fron-
tiers and promise of space.

life-threatening accidents, thanks 
you survive if disaster strikes.
It was New Year‚Äôs Day, 2005. Sam Kavanagh, Matt Schuyler, Blake 
Morstad, Jason Thompson and Chris Maki had snowmobiled 20 miles, 
then climbed an additional 5 miles with gear to ski the remote slopes of 
Montana‚Äôs 9334-foot Mount Nemesis. The group had skied the same 
route the previous day, and spent the night in a remote, backcountry

yurt. Equipped with shovels and locator 
beacons, Kavanagh and his friends were 
experienced backcountry skiers‚Äîin fact, two 
were certiÔ¨Åed EMTs. They knew to ski within 
the trees and to avoid steep slopes.
The tragic irony of the day was that it was 
24-year-old Morstad who triggered an 
avalanche. Morstad had a master‚Äôs in ava-
lanche studies. He was also an incredible 
athlete who pushed his physical limits, and at 
the end of the day he had wanted to try one 
more run a little higher on the open slope.  
‚ÄúWhen I saw the powder cloud coming,‚Äù 
Kavanagh recalls, ‚ÄúI grabbed the biggest tree I 
could Ô¨Ånd and held on.‚Äù The violent rush of 
snow blasted him off the tree. He heard a snap, 
and then began cartwheeling 60 yards down the mountain 
before coming to rest on a rock outcropping. ‚ÄúI looked down 
and my boot was turned 180 degrees, and 4 inches of bone was sticking through 
my ski pants,‚Äù he says. The break had created a 17-inch rip through Kavanagh‚Äôs 
lower leg, and he was bleeding heavily.  
Despite his injuries, Kavanagh set his locator beacon to search, turned his leg 
around to the normal position, then slid down the mountain to help locate 
Morstad. Schuyler, Thompson and Maki, who were unharmed, worked quickly to 
dig Morstad out, but it was too late: He was dead from blunt-force trauma.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really notice the pain until I saw Blake,‚Äù Kavanagh says. ‚ÄúThen I 
heard this voice in my head telling me that if I closed my eyes, that would be me 
dying. Keeping my eyes open was me deciding to stay alive.‚Äù 
It took 2 hours to drag Kavanagh 400 yards through armpit-deep snow from 
the avalanche site to the yurt. His friends attempted to reset Kavanagh‚Äôs leg, but 
the swelling was too great, so they created a makeshift compression pack using a 
Therm-a-Rest pad and duct tape.
The next morning, Maki and Schuyler skied out to get help while Thompson 
took care of Kavanagh. Losing blood and in shock, he desperately needed evacua-
tion. Rescue helicopters attempted to land that afternoon, but bad weather 
turned them back‚Äîforcing Kavanagh to spend a second night in the yurt.
To get through the night, Kavanagh relied on sheer willpower. ‚ÄúOnce you‚Äôve 
made the decision to live, you have to embrace it,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI visualized going 
home and being with my wife. And I never once doubted I could make it.‚Äù
The next day a helicopter crew from Malmstrom Air Force Base Ô¨Ånally 
reached the site and picked up Kavanagh by hovering above the deep snow. By 
the time he reached the hospital, it had been 48 hours since the accident. ‚ÄúI had 
lost more than half my blood and my kidneys were shutting down,‚Äù he recalls. 
Kavanagh lived, but his lower leg had to be amputated. Yet he remains a 
world-class athlete. In 2008, he won the U.S. Paralympic National Champion-
ships in track cycling, and he is currently ranked Ô¨Åfth in the world.  
If you‚Äôre in an 
avalanche, there‚Äôs a 50 
percent chance you‚Äôll 
die. If you survive 
without major injuries 
but are buried, your 
chances of surviving go 
up to 90 percent, but 
only if you‚Äôre dug out 
within 15 minutes. After 
that, it gets deadly 
quickly. Skiing solo? 
Chances are you‚Äôll die. 
So you need at least 
one partner, a locator 
beacon, a shovel and a 
probe. The No. 1 
survival tip: If you‚Äôre in an 
area that has recently had 
avalanches, you‚Äôre in 
dangerous terrain. Get out.  
‚ÄúPeople become 
euphoric in the 
backcountry,‚Äù says 
Mark Staples, an 
avalanche specialist at 
Gallatin National Forest 
Avalanche Center.  
‚ÄúThey lose sight of 
danger. Snowpack 
changes daily, and a 
span of just 10 feet can 
have different 
conditions. We see 
people skiing on slopes 
right next to avalanche 
slides all the time.‚Äù

 ¬ö  N A M E    GARY BABINEAU 
It was hot on the first day of August 2007‚Äî90 degrees, 
even at six in the evening. Gary Babineau, then a 24-year-
old terrazzo worker, had just finished his day hauling 
100-pound bags of rock in a windowless building, so he 
took his shirt off and rolled down the windows as he  
drove home in his blue Chevy pickup. Minneapolis rush-hour trafÔ¨Åc was heavy. 
Babineau drove northbound onto the eight-lane I-35W bridge just as several 
sections broke off and fell onto the banks of the Mississippi River, killing 13 
people and sending 145 other casualties to area hospitals. 
‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt even make a noise before it collapsed,‚Äù Babineau recalls. ‚ÄúIt just 
fell away.‚Äù Part of the bridge split in two right under his truck, sending it into a 
35-foot nose-dive as it chased the road deck straight to the ground. Babineau‚Äôs

face slammed into the steering wheel before the airbags deployed. His truck 
landed on the edge of the fractured roadway, bending its frame at a 20-degree 
angle like a fortune cookie and breaking the drive shaft. ‚ÄúI thought my back 
had snapped in two,‚Äù Babineau says. ‚ÄúSo I started to wiggle my toes to make 
sure I wasn‚Äôt paralyzed.‚Äù
As Babineau reached for his door handle, he could hear the wild screeching 
of tires right above him where what was left of the bridge now hung precipitous-
ly. Then one car skidded over the edge and crashed next to Babineau‚Äôs pickup. 
He balled himself up and stayed as low as possible in his cab. Then came 
another screech and another crash, then a third. Then silence. He opened his 
door and looked up to see a white sedan that had managed to stop before 
landing on him. It had been 10, maybe 15 seconds since the collapse.
Babineau approached a woman who was in a car in front of him. They were 
both stuck on the collapsed section of bridge and wanted to get off. Nobody 
knew what had happened, or if it was going to get worse. Would the rest of the 
bridge collapse? Had it been a bomb? Babineau and the woman made it to the

side of the bridge and were climbing off when Babineau heard children scream-
ing and crying. He looked over to the southbound lanes and saw a school bus 
that appeared to be teetering on the edge. He ran under the bridge and climbed 
up to the bus, working with a few other survivors to help more than 50 children‚Äî
many of whom were injured‚Äîget off the bus, off the bridge and onto safe 
ground. It took just 3 minutes to evacuate the children. 
Babineau returned to help others, but by that time, emergency crews were 
ordering civilians to stand back. As Babineau made his way to the top of the 
bridge, the rush of adrenaline began to wear off. He sat down, and the pain set in. 
It hasn‚Äôt really left him since. He has a partially compressed spine and several 
crushed disks. Some mornings it hurts just to put on his socks.
It all happened so fast, but when Babineau thinks about that day, the 
reasons for his actions are clear: ‚ÄúI had my Ô¨Årst child on the way,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd 
what made me want to get off that bridge was that I wanted to live. But what 
made me go back was knowing that if my child was on that bus, I would want 
someone else to do the same for them.‚Äù

¬ö  L O C A T I O N    GULF OF MEXICO 
¬ö  N A M E    TRESSELL HAWKINS 
Last August, Tressell Hawkins, Curtis Hall and James 
Phillips set off from Matagorda Bay, Texas, on Phillips‚Äôs 
23-foot catamaran, a Carolina Skiff Sea Chaser, for an 
overnight sport-fishing trip among the Gulf of Mexico‚Äôs 
offshore oil rigs. After dark, the group fell asleep drifting 
within sight of the Tequila rig some 80 miles offshore. As they slept, a bilge 
pump failure caused seawater to Ô¨Çood into the catamaran‚Äôs port sponson. ‚ÄúI 
woke up and put my foot down into knee-deep water,‚Äù Hawkins says. ‚ÄúI was 
yelling, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre in the water!‚Äô‚Äù 
Phillips dove for the VHF radio to make a distress call, while Hall reached 
for the ignition, hoping to gun the engine and force water out the back of the 
boat. But before they could do anything, the catamaran Ô¨Çipped and tossed 
them into the ocean. The three men scrambled atop the hull and spent the next 
dark hours in a state of stunned silence, steadily drifting south. 
When the trio didn‚Äôt return home the next day as sched-
uled, Phillips‚Äôs wife Shane called the Coast Guard to report 
them missing. The Coast Guard scrambled cutters, a Falcon 
jet, helicopters and a C-130 Hercules out of Clearwater, Fla., 
running a methodical search-and-rescue grid over some 
86,000 square miles‚Äîan area larger than Utah. ‚ÄúWe found 
nothing‚Äînot a life jacket, not a cooler, not a seat cushion,‚Äù 
recalls Capt. Marcus Woodring, commander of the Coast 
Guard‚Äôs Sector Houston-Galveston. 
On day three, the castaway Ô¨Åshermen saw a helicopter, but

After the I-35W bridge 
collapse, Gary Babineau 
acted courageously and 
helped save more than 
50 children. He also 
avoided a classic 
mistake by staying in his 
truck until the crashing 
around him stopped. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs instinctual to get 
out of your car,‚Äù says 
Sgt. Doug Sheets, an 
accident investigator 
with the California 
Highway Patrol. ‚ÄúBut 
that‚Äôs how people get 
killed.  You can take a pretty 
big hit in a car if you‚Äôre 
wearing a seatbelt, but you 
don‚Äôt want to be outside 
unprotected if a Freightliner 
is coming at you.‚Äù 
Sheets suggests rolling 
down your window 
before making any 
moves. ‚ÄúYou can hear 
accidents unfolding,‚Äù he 
says. All quiet? Then 
make a break. ‚ÄúEven if 
your car has four Ô¨Çat 
tires, drive out of the 
way,‚Äù Sheets says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 
easier for investigators 
if you don‚Äôt, but 
nobody‚Äôs going to blame 
you if it saves your life.‚Äù

they had already shot off all the boat‚Äôs Ô¨Çares and couldn‚Äôt send a signal. The men 
had set up the boat‚Äôs blue Bimini top on the hull of the boat as cover from the 
sun, a move that, in retrospect, they realize may have rendered them invisible to 
planes in the vast blue ocean. Over the next few days it‚Äôs estimated the boat 
drifted another 100 miles south. 
The August sun was blistering lips, arms and legs. Their skin began to crack 
and tear apart. To escape the heat the men spent hours bobbing in the water 
alongside the boat. This undoubtedly delayed the extreme dehydration that could 
otherwise have killed them. But it also came with a price. The men were stung by 
jellyÔ¨Åsh, and the saltwater began eating away at their open wounds. During the 
cold nights, the three stayed in the 80-degree water, Ô¨Çoating there to keep warm. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think any of us slept for more than 15 minutes at a time,‚Äù Hawkins says.
For food and water, the crew had salvaged two bags of chips, a pack of Double-
mint gum, a box of crackers and 2 gallons of drinking water that was contami-
nated with gasoline when the boat Ô¨Çipped . They exhausted the food supply 
within three days, and the tainted water was making them ill.

guys didn‚Äôt have that 
would have really helped 
us Ô¨Ånd them is an 
EPIRB,‚Äù says Coast 
Guard search-and-rescue 
coordinator Denny 
Ernster‚Äîusing the 
acronym for Emergency 
Position-Indicating 
Radiobeacon.  ‚ÄúWith the 
automatic beacons, 
when your boat tips 
over, the unit 
dislodges itself, floats 
to the surface and 
sends out a signal. 
Then we know exactly 
where you are, and 
there‚Äôs no range 
limitation on them.‚Äù 
The internationally 
recognized frequency for 
both boat and airplane 
beacons is 406 MHz. 
Older models use a 
different frequency, and 
the satellite system that 
supported them has 
been shut down. Time  
to upgrade.
By the fourth day, life aboard the 
capsized boat had become a blur. 
Minutes melted into hours; the group 
hit a psychological bottom‚Äîand  
the men started hallucinating. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd 
Ô¨Çip open my hand like a cellphone 
and start talking,‚Äù Hawkins recalls. 
At one point, Phillips stood up and 
said he was going to the store, then 
walked right off the boat. ‚ÄúWe all had 
our moments of weakness,‚Äù Hawkins 
says. ‚ÄúOne day I would completely 
freak out about not being found, but 
then James and Curtis would help me 
calm down. Another time they would 
be freaking out. We helped each 
other work through it. That‚Äôs how we 
survived out there.‚Äù 
On day Ô¨Åve, Phillips noticed a 
hose Ô¨Çoating on the ocean surface. It 
led to the boat‚Äôs submerged 30- 
gallon wash-down tank, which is 
used to hose off Ô¨Åsh slime. When the 
men sucked water from the tank and 
found that it was uncontaminated, 
they knew their lives had been saved. 
‚ÄúThat water felt like molasses on a 
cold day,‚Äù Hawkins says. ‚ÄúI could feel 
it going through my body.‚Äù 
The Coast Guard suspended its 
search on day seven. But the trio‚Äôs 
second lucky break came when their 
boat caught a current that sent it 
slowly northwest back toward the 
Texas coast. 
Finally, after eight days, Hawkins 
and his friends saw a boat. ‚ÄúCurtis 
and James were yelling and acting 
crazy, but I thought we were just 
hallucinating,‚Äù Hawkins says. One of 
them set off a Ô¨Åre extinguisher they‚Äôd 
been saving. The signal worked. 
Eddie Yaklin, a car dealer from 
Kingsville, Texas, who was out 
Ô¨Åshing oil rigs himself, brought his 
58-foot Riviera alongside the turtled 
hull and helped the men aboard. En 
route to a rendezvous with a Coast 
Guard vessel, Yaklin cooked the 
survivors a steak dinner.
Tressell Hawkins and his 
Ô¨Åshing buddies were lost 
at sea for eight days, but 
they could have been 
rescued in a hurry with 
the right technology.

s DOG ATTACK 
s POISONOUS SNAKES 
Every year, 8000 people are bitten by snakes‚Äîdrunken men are 
statistically over-represented‚Äîbut few bites are fatal. To check if 
you‚Äôve been bitten by a poisonous snake, look for a pair of deep 
puncture marks. Swelling will be quick, so remove constricting 
items such as jewelry. Now, try to stay calm and keep the bite 
below heart level as you head to the nearest hospital.  What about 
slicing the bite and sucking out the venom? It doesn‚Äôt work,  and 
you might slice into something that can‚Äôt be easily repaired.

s MAJOR WOUND 
Apply direct pressure by clamping your hand on the wound, then 
elevate the injury above the heart to slow blood Ô¨Çow. If bleeding 
continues for 30 minutes, use clothes to wrap the site in a 
pressure dressing.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt keep checking to see if it‚Äôs working, 
even if it‚Äôs bloody‚Äù says Dr. Jeff Gutterman, a fellow of the 
American College of Emergency Physicians. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a classic 
mistake.‚Äù  If the bleeding doesn‚Äôt stop after another 30 minutes, 
tie off the wound a few inches above the site. If you get emer-
gency help within several hours you probably won‚Äôt lose the limb. 
s DROWNING 
Drown-prooÔ¨Ång is a technique developed in the 1940s by 
legendary Georgia Tech swim coach Fred Lanoue. It enables you 
to stay alive for hours without exhausting yourself. Here‚Äôs how it 
works:  Most humans are naturally buoyant‚Äîwe float,  but just 
below the surface. So rest by Ô¨Çoating facedown in the water with 
arms out, scarecrow-style. Every 15 seconds, raise your arms to 
the surface, then push down. The motion causes your head to 
rise above the surface long enough for you to take a breath.    
s LIGHTNING 
s HYPOTHERMIA 
Rule No. 1: Exercise if you‚Äôre freezing cold. It will warm you up. 
Rule No. 2: Disregard rule No. 1 if you‚Äôre in the water. With 
hypothermia, blood vessels constrict, reducing the supply of 
warm blood to the skin. That keeps internal organs warm‚Äîwhich 
is what you want. But forcing those vessels open by exercising in 
the water pushes the warm blood to the surface, where it quickly 
gets chilled.  If you‚Äôre immersed in water, stay still. 
Wild-animal attacks will get you on the Discovery Channel, but 
they‚Äôre extremely rare. Dog bites send 885,000 people to the 
doctor every year.  ‚ÄúNever run from an aggressive dog,‚Äù says 
Jeremy Talamantes of K-9 Behavior Services. ‚ÄúIf you do, you‚Äôre 
just bait.‚Äù  Conventional wisdom cautions people to freeze, but 
Talamantes takes it further. ‚ÄúYou want to stand your ground, puff 
yourself up and yell, ‚ÄòGet back!‚Äô That‚Äôs going to hurt the dog‚Äôs 
conÔ¨Ådence, and most times it‚Äôll stay back.‚Äù 
Some 600 people are struck every year; about 60 are killed. 
First, the common-sense rules:  Don‚Äôt be‚Äîor be near‚Äîthe tallest 
object around,  and get rid of metal objects that are in contact 
with your skin. As a last resort, experts suggest squatting with 
just the balls of your feet on the ground. Cover your ears, close 
your mouth and eyes, and hope the bolt rolls over you.

¬ö  L O C A T I O N    DENALI NATIONAL PARK, ALASKA 
 ¬ö  N A M E     DAN MCGREGOR 
It was around seven in the evening last October, and 
backpackers Jesse Hoagland and Nick Rodrick were 
preparing to spend their first night in the Denali  
backcountry. The two had driven all the way from New 
Hampshire on a cross-country road trip, and were  
enjoying the solitude of the park‚Äôs Igloo Creek campsite‚Äîat least until Dan 
McGregor stumbled toward their campÔ¨Åre. ‚ÄúIt was like something out of a 
horror movie,‚Äù Hoagland recalls. ‚ÄúHe was totally burned up. His whole body 
was black and charred. He had a 
Ô¨Çannel shirt on and a T-shirt 
underneath, but they were mostly 
burned away. He was in bad shape.‚Äù
Hoagland and Rodrick gave 
McGregor some bananas, a granola 
bar and Gatorade. After apologizing 
for eating all their food, McGregor 
told the campers he was a pilot for 
Denali Air and then explained what 
had happened the day before. He had 
been Ô¨Çying famed wolf biologist 
Gordon Haber around the park, 
tracking the Toklat wolf pack via 
radio telemetry. As McGregor and 
Haber buzzed over the Wyoming 
Hills, the single-engine Cessna 185 
was buffeted by a severe downdraft. 
McGregor struggled with the 
controls, but he was unable to pull 
the plane out of its dive before it

crashed against a steep slope near the East Fork of the 
Toklat River.
According to a National Transportation Safety Board 
report on the incident, when McGregor regained 
consciousness, the plane‚Äôs cabin was Ô¨Ålling with 
smoke. As the pilot tried to Ô¨Åght his way out of the 
plane, he called out to Haber but heard no response. 
Once clear of the wreckage, McGregor tried to work his 
way back into the cabin through the baggage door to 
save Haber, but by then the Ô¨Åre was too intense. 
The two men had known each other well and had 
Ô¨Çown together often, and Haber‚Äôs death was a crushing 
blow to McGregor. Now he was faced with the prospect 
of dying himself from exposure. His ankles and face 
were bloodied and badly bruised, and he was burned 
from head to toe. He spent the night at the crash site, 
using the Ô¨Çaming wreckage to fend off hypothermia. 
The next morning, McGregor weighed his options. He was convinced his 
locator beacon had been destroyed by the crash. In fact, McGregor‚Äôs plane was 
equipped with an outdated beacon. Even if the device had survived the impact, it 
wouldn‚Äôt have been able to communicate with the current emergency rescue 
satellite system. The C-130 search-and-rescue plane sent from Anchorage didn‚Äôt 
pick up its signal either. A low-lying fog that morning obscured the crash site, 
complicating the search.  
Given those factors, McGregor decided to hike out over terrain he knew well. 
He slogged 7 miles south, following the East Fork until he reached a primitive 
park road. He followed it 8 miles east to the Igloo Creek campsite. Ironically, 
around 3 pm, a Civil Air Patrol pilot had sighted the downed Cessna and radioed 
the Alaska State Troopers. A trooper then landed a plane nearby and hiked to the 
crash site. He reported back that he had found human remains. Word quickly 
spread that both Haber and McGregor were dead.
Finally, McGregor trudged into camp, crying out for help. ‚ÄúHe was cold,‚Äù 
Hoagland remembers. ‚ÄúHe practically stood in the Ô¨Åre he was 
so cold.‚Äù After feeding the pilot, the two campers packed up 
their gear and walked him 5 miles to their van, which was 
parked at the Teklanika River campground. ‚ÄúHe kind of 
shufÔ¨Çed because his ankles hurt so much,‚Äù Hoagland says, 
‚Äúand his shoes were practically melted away.‚Äù 
McGregor was Ô¨Çown to Harborview Medical Center in 
Seattle, Wash., where Hoagland and Rodrick visited him. 
McGregor has not commented publicly about the crash, but 
he told PM that his skin grafts have been successful and his 
other injuries are healing. He is still coming to grips with 
the loss of his friend and neighbor. But he hopes that 
someday lessons learned from his experience may save 
someone else‚Äôs life.  FC

Peter Kummerfeldt, 
former director of 
survival training at the 
U.S. Air Force 
Academy, sees Dan 
McGregor‚Äôs miracu-
lous post-plane-crash 
hike to survival as the 
exception to the rule. 
‚ÄúYou hear a lot about 
tenacity in survival 
situations like these,‚Äù 
Kummerfeldt says. 
‚ÄúThis guy had it, but 
you don‚Äôt know who 
else has it until 
something bad happens. 
I like to take tenacity out of 
the survival equation. Your 
best bet is always staying 
with the plane. It‚Äôs just easier 
to find a plane than 
a person.‚Äù 
Plus, that plane, if it 
isn‚Äôt too badly 
damaged, has 
resources: shelter, 
fuel for Ô¨Åres and foam 
rubber for insulation. 
‚ÄúAnd you don‚Äôt need to 
spend thousands on 
gear,‚Äù he says. Case 
in point: a 50-gallon 
trash bag. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 
windproof and 
waterproof. In the 
bottom corner, cut a 
hole big enough to slip 
your head through, 
then place the bag 
over your body.‚Äù

¬í OUT ON A LIMB WITH A MOUTH FULL OF NAILS, ONE DAD SUSPENDS A SHACK 

7 FEET ABOVE HIS BACKYARD. 
common-sense rule of treehouse construc-
tion: Make it lightweight. So I felt some stirrings of anxiety 
when the stocky, bearded sawmill owner pulled up to the house 
with a Ô¨Çatbed trailer stacked with oak timbers. Full of water, 
densely grained and smelling like bourbon, the rough-cut fram-
ing lumber I‚Äôd ordered spanned 18 feet and looked like bridge 
supports. As we ofÔ¨Çoaded the Ô¨Årst 2 x 8, each of us taking an end 
in hand, I smiled doggedly to mask the strain I felt. He peered 
over the garden fence past the lilac bushes, and politely asked, 
‚ÄúWhat kind of treehouse are you building?‚Äù
One thing was certain: It wouldn‚Äôt look much like the rickety 
aeries of my childhood, hammered together out of whatever

construction scraps and packing 
crates we neighborhood kids could 
scrounge up. (The most ambitious of 
these was a three-story fort spanning 
a creek and topped by a crow‚Äôs-nest 
made from an old kitchen chair 
nailed to the trunk.) This time, I‚Äôd 
enjoy the advantages of milled lum-
ber and a carpenter‚Äôs square and 
level, not to mention power tools. Yet 
I hoped to match the spirit of those 
earlier tree forts with a rustic struc-
ture where my children could waste 
their afternoons dreaming up rules 
to games I‚Äôd never understand or 
even hear about.
As kids, my friends and I never 
bothered with plans. We had an abun-
dance of trees and were eager to start 
hammering. Today, there are exactly 
four mature trees in our backyard. I 
consider them all irreplaceable‚Äîat 
least in my lifetime‚Äîso after decid-
ing to build a treehouse, I thought long and hard about 
where to put it. The ideal host was a 70-foot-tall Kentucky 
coffee tree standing alone in a corner of our small lot. It rises 
15 feet before its trunk sprouts into a balanced, oval-shaped 
crown that filters sunlight through its leaves like flour 
through a sifter.
As an adult and a conscientious neighbor, I also thought 
hard about what the treehouse would look like. I wanted 
something that would not seem out of place in the historic 
Virginia downtown where we live. No cheap-looking ply-
wood box or precious playhouse on stilts would do. The 
structure would be modest in size, and the materials would 
have an outsize effect on how it looked. I asked my friend 
John Foster, a capable craftsman who built the log cabin 
where he lives, for advice.
‚ÄúI‚Äôd use green oak,‚Äù John said, gazing up at the tree. The 
timbers would be strong and rot-resistant, and they‚Äôd age 
beautifully, he explained. As proof, he pointed me to the bed 
of his pickup truck, which held a 4 x 6‚Äìinch oak beam that 
he uses for skidding landscaping boulders. ‚ÄúSee that old 
timber? That‚Äôs been bouncing around back there since I 
built my house,‚Äù he said. Fresh from the sawmill 20 years 
ago, the green oak had grown silvery gray with a rough, 
raised grain‚Äîa handsome piece of wood, I had to agree. It 
didn‚Äôt occur to me to ask how much green oak weighs. 
                                                                                                                           is a lot like any 
other construction project, with one main difference: 
Instead of a foundation, a treehouse rests on a platform. 
The platform should be sturdy enough so that whatever sits 
atop it‚Äîgingerbread Victorian, open-sided play hut or, in 
my case, rustic cabin‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt attach to the trunk. That 
minimizes damage to the tree and keeps the swaying on a 
windy day from prying apart the structure. It also, frankly, 
is a mark of craftsmanship‚Äîthe difference between bang-
ing together boards as a kid and doing it right, with a mea-
sure of adult skill and judgment.
If you‚Äôre building high off the ground across several 
trees, even your platform needs to allow for tree movement. 
You can either install an expensive system of treehouse 
cables and bolts or rig your own free-Ô¨Çoating beam. If the 
tree is mature and sturdy and your platform rests in the bot-
tom eighth of the tree, you can use a Ô¨Åxed platform. I modi-
Ô¨Åed a classic design, sketching plans for an 8-foot-square 
platform that would surround my tree at a height of 7 feet.
That was plenty high for my son, Luther, and daughter, 
Eliot, ages 10 and 7, respectively. During the planning 
phase, I let them climb a ladder to the mark on the trunk 
where the Ô¨Çoor would go. When I held up the 3D cardboard 
model I had made, their eyes lit up. But to be honest, I had 
no idea how they would respond once it was built. Society 
has changed since the freewheeling 1970s, when my boy-
hood friends and I roamed the neighborhood, scavenging 
construction sites for scrap lumber and nails like cul-de-
sac Robinson Crusoes. Would my kids take to the tree-
house, or would they prefer to stay inside playing video 
games and snapping together Legos?
Seven feet may not sound very high, but working overhead 
made bolting my platform beams to the tree a major chal-
lenge. My anxiety over handling all that heavy lumber eased a 
                                ¬í e scrap-wood citadels of my childhood (above, le) lacked a certain 
sophiÔ¨Üication that comes with aual planning. Aer Ô¨Üruggling to 
draw my new design on graph paper, I built a model out of cardboard 
(above), specifying details like a Dutch door, lap siding and an 
observation deck on one side. I used a chain hoiÔ¨Ü and ropes (right) to 
help position the green oak framing before bolting it into position.

bit after I cut the beams down to 8-foot lengths with my cir-
cular saw. Still, each one weighed probably 100 pounds. 
What saved me was a chain hoist, a gadget most often used 
by shade-tree mechanics to lift engine blocks out of cars. I 
borrowed one from John, who uses it to lift stone for his 
landscaping jobs. The mechanical advantage of the gear dif-
ferentials made raising my beams as easy as tugging on the 
chain with two Ô¨Ångers. And the ratcheted brake prevented 
the load from slipping backward. The hoist did the work of 
two men, never faltering and never once complaining.
That was fortunate, since I mostly worked alone. This 
was too big a job for Luther and Eliot. They helped in small 
ways‚Äîhanding me tools, picking up dropped nails with a 
magnetic sweeper‚Äîbut they preferred to stay on the ground, 
hammering scrap wood into sailboats and slingshots. It was 
refreshing to know that their prepackaged, adult-designed 
games were sitting untouched inside.
To minimize my impact on the tree, I anchored each of 
my four crossbeams with a single 3‚ÅÑ4-inch lag screw. To those 
beams, I attached rim joists and Ô¨Çoor joists. Using green 
oak meant that I had to predrill everything. Otherwise, I 
would never have been able to drive my nails home in that 
dense wood. Or I‚Äôd have split the grain trying. Even the big-
gest deck screws I could Ô¨Ånd seemed too thin and brittle for 
such formidable lumber, so instead I bought a couple of 
5-pound boxes of zinc-dipped 20d nails. The going was slow, 
but I soon found my rhythm with drill and hammer. 
Once my platform frame was complete, I began install-
ing 2 x 6‚Äìinch tongue-and-groove yellow-pine Ô¨Çoorboards. I 
knelt on loose boards, tapping each plank into place with a 
rubber mallet and then nailing it 
home. Soon I had enough floor in 
place to form a stable perch. I worked 
around the tree, leaving a 2- to 3-inch 
gap between it and the Ô¨Çoor to allow 
for growth. I top-nailed the floor 
using square-headed cut nails. It was 
easier than nailing through the 
tongues. Plus, the old-fashioned 
technique added character‚Äîa touch 
that pleased me, though it would 
probably be lost on the kids. 
                                    between my tree-
climbing childhood and late adoles-
cence, I briefly developed a fear of 
heights. During a clandestine ascent 
of a water tower during my senior 
year in high school, I froze 10 rungs 
up, palms clammy, ground spinning below. Three weeks 
later, I followed friends up the same ladder, forcing myself 
not to look down. But then, after a few more climbs, once to 
the top of the domed reservoir (kids, don‚Äôt try this at home), 
my fear seemed to evaporate in the warm midnight air‚ÄîI 
had simply been out of practice. 
When I began building my kids‚Äô treehouse, I felt out of 
practice again. Though my extension ladder hardly com-
pared to the water tower, scaling it one-handed while lug-
ging the chain hoist or a 2 x 4 made my knees wobbly. I 
eventually grew comfortable. Still, I decided to adhere to 
another basic rule of treehouse construction: Build on the 
ground. You‚Äôre faster and more efÔ¨Åcient in close proximity 
to your tools, lumber and sawhorses. And face it, no matter 
how fearless you are working perched at precarious 
heights, the fewer trips up and down a ladder, the safer 
you‚Äôll be. Real treehouse pros (and today, there are more of 
these than ever) trim out entire wall sections, including 
framing, siding, molding and glass windows, before hoist-
ing them up to the platform. 
Not knowing exactly how my walls would meet up, I 
didn‚Äôt go that far. I did frame three of my four walls on the 
ground, then raised them with the chain hoist. Once every-
thing was aligned, I nailed the plates to the Ô¨Çoor. Connect-
ing the rear butt wall between the pair of side walls made 
me momentarily curse my decision to use green oak. I was 
just able to Ô¨Åt my drill and 6-inch bit between the studs. 
Face-nailing the 20d nails was even more awkward.
The job got frustrating once I started working up high, 
building the fourth wall and roof rafters. Like some kind of 
Newtonian poltergeist, gravity spilled nails, tipped boards 
over the edge and tugged my power cord to the ground, forc-
                                           ¬í My daughter Eliot (le) performed a supervisory role during 
the conÔ¨Üruion. When conÔ¨Üruing the roof, I Ô¨Çashed the gap 
between the cedar shakes and the tree using a truck tire‚Äôs inner tube, 
secured with a bungee cord (above, le). A ruÔ¨Üic ladder made of 
¬æ-inch nylon rope and 1¬æ-inch dowels provides access‚Äîor, when 
hoiÔ¨Üed up, thwarts invaders from terra Ô¨Årma (above, right).

Midsize sedans blend so seamlessly into the American automotive landscape that you may 
never really notice them. They‚Äôre pragmatic transportation vessels that competently and 
anonymously troll freeways and mall parking lots. These high-quality sedans provide 
roominess, comfort, efÔ¨Åciency and plenty of luxury features‚Äîall at an affordable price. 
So it‚Äôs no surprise that in 2009, midsize sedans were the single largest volume segment, 
with nearly 20 percent of the market. Accordingly, this segment is a critical battleground, 
with many new sedans hustling to catch our attention. We knew it was time to see if the

NissanAltima Inching up in 
sales volume for the past half-decade, the Altima has become a 
thorn in the side of Honda and Toyota. Restyled for 2010, the 
Nissan is the lightest car here by 100 pounds. And engineering 
out the excess weight in a design is the gift that keeps giving. 
The Altima was the quickest to 60 mph (7.72 seconds) and 
returned the best fuel economy (32.4 mpg). 
While the scales suggest a Ô¨Çimsy structure, the Altima feels 
solid and well-built. The interior layout is refreshingly simple, 
with high-quality materials used throughout. The Altima‚Äôs 
continuously variable transmission (CVT), the only available 
transmission, was not our favorite. The engine has plenty of 
torque, but it drones in the upper rev range, an unpleasant 
aspect that the CVT intensiÔ¨Åes. But at least there is a manual 
mode, and we tended to use it during spirited driving. 
newcomers could match the perennial top sellers.
We started with the segment‚Äôs three most popular cars‚Äî
the Nissan Altima, Toyota Camry and Honda Accord‚Äîand 
drove them alongside Ô¨Åve challengers: the Mazda6, Ford 
Fusion, Suzuki Kizashi, Chevy Malibu and Subaru Legacy. 
We ran them through our tests, a day of hard driving in the 
hills near Los Angeles and a 360-mile fuel-economy loop. 
Since four-cylinder engines and automatic transmissions 
make up the majority of the sales in this class, we ordered 
each car that way. Instead of ranking these very similar  
vehicles in a Ô¨Ånishing order, we decided to call out the 
combination of each car‚Äôs strengths and represent them as 
icons. So, here are eight of the top four-door sedans in 
America‚Äîand what they do best.
The Altima was a little reluctant to change 
direction, with excess body roll and slower 
steering than, say, the Mazda. It doesn‚Äôt want 
to hustle. But around town, outside the 
conÔ¨Ånes of our test course, we found the 
Altima to be very reÔ¨Åned and comfortable. 
ToyotaCamry
Since the beginning of this century, the Camry 
has been the country‚Äôs best-selling car more 
years than not. It‚Äôs sensible, roomy and 
well-built. But driving the Camry is a slightly 
less exciting activity than toasting a piece of Wonder bread. 
Frankly, we need more Ô¨Åber. 
It‚Äôs not that the Camry doesn‚Äôt do its job effectively. It was 
one of the quicker sedans, yet still delivered an above-average 
31.5 mpg. It‚Äôs also exceptionally quiet and serene inside. Only 
the Honda Accord has a roomier back seat. 
The interior that was once lauded for its quality feel now 
seems cheaply made, with poor panel Ô¨Åtment and low-rent 
materials. To be fair, the Camry is value-priced, but it‚Äôs also the 
only one riding on 16-inch wheels with hubcaps.
We could forgive those sins, but the rest of the car is a big 
slice of ho-hum. If you push the Camry hard, the connection 
between man and machine feels as though it‚Äôs separated by a 
layer of molasses. Its pillowy body motions reminded us of 
yesteryear‚Äôs land yachts. If there‚Äôs a payoff to this performance, 
it‚Äôs the extremely plush ride and hushed interior.

The Camry sealed its reputation some two decades ago with 
a reliable and competent sedan in a market Ô¨Ålled with 
lackluster cars. The world has caught up, and Toyota has 
faltered. The Camry was recalled in January and its production 
halted to Ô¨Åx a sticky throttle. It‚Äôs time for Toyota engineers to 
remind us why the Camry deserves its top-selling status.
FordFusion Sheet metal can be 
deceiving. The Ford Fusion, recently refreshed for 2010, 
shares its platform and engine with the Mazda6. Perhaps 
that‚Äôs why the two cars went through the slalom and lane-
change tests at the same speed. Yet the Ford is the smoother 
operator in the real world. ‚ÄúThe Ford has 85 percent of the 
Mazda‚Äôs poise, but with better ride quality,‚Äù one tester said.
Another critical difference: fuel economy. The Ford‚Äôs 
six-speed automatic (Mazda offers Ô¨Åve speeds) helped it to top 
the Mazda by more than 3 mpg in our testing. However, 
shifting that six-speed manually is akin to operating a 
three-speed automatic from the 1970s. Your only choice is a D 
or L position on the shifter. Does the L stand for Lame?
Ford‚Äôs updated look is handsome. But inside, the dash is 
plain and uninspired. Still, the interior has plenty of handy 
storage nooks. On a twisty road you notice the lack of support 
from the park-bench-Ô¨Çat front buckets. Upside? They are 
mounted high, leaving room for back-seat passengers‚Äô feet. 
The new Fusion is a tremendous value. Yet there‚Äôs 
blandness to this car. It‚Äôs almost like a generic version of the 
Mazda6
It‚Äôs rare when exceptional 
cars remain largely undiscov-
ered. But that‚Äôs the case with 
the Mazda. And it‚Äôs aÔ¨Üonish-
ing considering that this may 
be the beÔ¨Ü all-around sedan.
is is a sporty machine, with 
light, dire Ô¨Üeering and a 
chassis that always feels 
planted. e responses are 
Ô¨Çuid, and the Mazda is eager 
to Ô¨Çy through curves. It‚Äôs clear 
this sedan spent many 
development miles clipping 
apexes. But unlike some, 
there‚Äôs no price to pay for its 
lively, fun-to-drive spirit. e 
Mazda has a resilient ride that 
absorbs bumps with muted 
thumps. Mazda got the 
details right: e shi	er glides 
through its detents, juÔ¨Ü like 
one on a Mercedes-Benz. And 
when revved hard, the engine 
sounds expensive. e only 
downside to this powertrain 
was the unimpressive fuel 
economy. e interior is one 
of the quieteÔ¨Ü here, and  
only NBA-size passengers 
would need more legroom. 
is car is a good deal too.  
A loaded Grand Touring  
model can be had for about 
$27,000. e Mazda6 proves 
that midsize sedans don‚Äôt 
have to be the automotive 
equivalent of Ambien.

Top Pick

Mazda. The Fusion lineup, however, includes a hybrid version 
that Mazda doesn‚Äôt offer. While hybrids are not in the scope of 
this test, the gas‚Äìelectric Fusion is noteworthy among its peers 
and deserves a mention. It transparently delivers nearly  
40 mpg in everyday driving and, like the rest of the lineup, 
favors comfort, ride quality and efÔ¨Åciency. 
Suzuki Kizashi Unlike all the 
other players in this test, Suzuki has never had a credible entry 
in the midsize sedan segment. Yet this is not a clone of an 
established model. Nope. Suzuki went its own way and built 
an incredibly sporty sedan at an eye-popping low price. 
There‚Äôs no mistaking this car‚Äôs sporting character, thanks 
to the aggressive bodywork and the dual exhaust. It‚Äôs eager for 
action‚Äîlike a frothy-mouthed pit bull at the end of a leash. 
The Kizashi is the only car here with big 18-inch wheels, 
and it cut a precise curve, clawing the pavement with 0.87 g‚Äôs 
worth of grip. It was over 10 mph faster through the lane 
change than the Toyota Camry. That‚Äôs astonishing. The 
steering is quick and sensitive‚Äîthe perfect conduit to the 
front tires. Our tester costs just $22,489‚Äîthe lowest here‚Äî
and did not feel stripped down. The cloth seats felt two rungs 
higher in quality than the Toyota‚Äôs. It also came with dual-
zone climate control, rear air vents and iPod integration. 
But the Kizashi isn‚Äôt exactly the teacher‚Äôs pet. This sedan 
offers plenty of uplevel features, but they are delivered in a 
package that somehow feels less expensive. More importantly, 
Since the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü Accord arrived 
here in 1976, it has slowly 
and Ô¨Üeadily Ô¨Üeamrolled over 
the competition to become a 
benchmark. is lateÔ¨Ü 
version‚Äîthe eighth 
generation‚Äîis the only car 
here that‚Äôs oÔ¨Écially classiÔ¨Åed 
by the EPA as a large car. But 
big is okay when hauling the 
family is the objeive. e 
Accord‚Äôs rear seat trumps the 
reÔ¨Ü. Two six-footers could 
spend hours back there. e 
2.4-liter hums smoothly, and 
though the gearbox lacks a 
sixth gear, it Ô¨Üill hit 32 mpg. 
e suspension is Ô¨Årm in all 
the right ways, communicat-
ing the road surface up into 
your hands but Ô¨Åltering out 
the rough edges. e Accord 
doesn‚Äôt have an overtly 
sporty feel, but it can run a 
canyon road without 
shouting about its capability 
through the bullhorn of a Ô¨ÜiÔ¨Ä 
ride. Inside, the Accord is a 
little, yes, boring. But the Ô¨Åt 
and Ô¨Ånish top the class, and 
the front seats occupy the 
pole position for comfort. 
Our $25,340 teÔ¨Üer lacked 
some features, like heated 
seats, that others oÔ¨Äer at a 
similar price. But there‚Äôs a 
reason so many buyers 
choose the Honda Accord: It 
handles every chore with 
solid competence.

the Suzuki is smaller. The rear seat is comparatively tight, and 
there‚Äôs less room in the trunk. Still, the Kizashi is an entertain-
ing sedan at a rock-bottom price. 
Chevrolet Malibu
GM might be Ô¨Åghting to rebuild itself after a tumultuous year, 
but the Malibu is a key example of the company‚Äôs design and 
engineering chops. The exterior has tight proportions with 
just the right amount of dazzle, and was chosen as best- 
looking by our younger voters. Inside, there‚Äôs an upscale vibe. 
The smooth motor is exceedingly quiet and employs 
fuel-saving direct injection. Chevy channels the 169 hp 
through a six-speed automatic, which helps the Malibu hit  
33 mpg on the EPA highway cycle. (It was only a midpack  
30.3 mpg in our testing.) The Malibu weighs nearly as much as 
the Subaru, but from behind the wheel it feels relatively light. 
It‚Äôs surprisingly agile, belying the unspectacular handling-test 
results. The Malibu‚Äôs ride was as plush as the Camry‚Äôs, but 
without syrupy responses. The Chevy always feels engaged and 
ready to frolic, and the electric power assist dials up the right 
amount of effort. The wheel also has handy switches to 
manually control the transmission. 
That stylish, gently sloping rear glass leaves a small, 
mailbox-like trunk opening. So this sedan wouldn‚Äôt be our 
Ô¨Årst choice for a trip to Home Depot. Still, the Malibu was one 
of the best-balanced cars here, blending handling, quietness 
and comfort into one very sleek and affordable package. 
SubaruLegacyIn dismal 
2009, when the country‚Äôs auto sales tumbled by about a third,  
Subaru was the success story, notching a 15 percent gain, 
thanks in no small part to the new Legacy.
Subaru, like Mazda, has long been in the hunt for a midsize 
sedan with mass appeal. But in the past, both cars were just a 
bit too small. No more. The Subaru has grown up. 
The 170-hp boxer engine is inherently smooth and barks a 
throaty tune, but it could use some extra low-end torque. A 
six-speed manual is the standard gearbox, but ours had the 
optional CVT. This transmission takes its time to switch ratios 
and helped make the Subaru the slowest here, but the deÔ¨Åcit 
is negligible in this class of vehicle.  
Yes, the all-wheel-drive Legacy is a bit heavy compared to 
some, and the driveline has more inherent drag. But it still 
returned 31 mpg on our route, about average for this group. It 
also feels very solid, not unlike a German sedan. The suspen-
sion tuning mimics the Honda‚Äôs‚Äîinitially supple yet 
buttoned down once the twisties get tight.  
The interior is inviting and feels richer than that of most 
cars here. The steering wheel wears a pair of paddles for 
manual shifting, and the ignition switch has a lighted ring for 
nighttime viewing‚Äîa nice touch. The front seats were tops in 
all-day comfort‚Äîthe rear ones just short of the Accord‚Äôs. 
The Legacy is large enough and comfortable enough to 
steal sales from the mainstream players. But it hasn‚Äôt lost the 
personality that makes Subarus such interesting cars.

shows just how 
closely these cars 
are matched when it 
comes to perfor-
mance. In terms of 
full-throttle 
acceleration to 60 
mph, less than 1 
second separated 
these cars. The 
spread in fuel 
economy on our PM 
test loop was less 
than 4 mpg, and the 
difference between 
the heaviest and the 
lightest car was a 
mere 220 pounds. 
That reÔ¨Çects not

become, but also 
how important the

can be. Though we 
didn‚Äôt rank these

ometimes you have to destroy your lawn in order to save it. If 
years of weeding, fertilizing and fussing have failed to prod your 
patch of turf to perfection, it‚Äôs time to change tactics. PM con-
tributing editor Jim Gorman advises a brutal but effective strat-
egy: Kill off the insipid sod entirely, then start fresh. The result 
will be a lush, healthy lawn that knows who‚Äôs boss.
Weeds invade when the 
lawn itself isn‚Äôt healthy. 
Killing the weeds without 
healing the lawn means 
you‚Äôre only treating the 
symptoms.

THE FIRST STEP IS ADMITTING YOUR LAWN HAS A 
PROBLEM. LOTS OF THEM, ACTUALLY: WEEDS, 
BARE SPOTS, THATCH. PEOPLE ARE TALKING. BUT 
ARE YOU READY TO EMBRACE THE TREATMENT? 
I‚Äôm one of those grass guys. You probably know 
the type. House surrounded by a shag carpet so 
deeply green it verges on blue. Not a weed in sight. 
There‚Äôs a grass guy or two in every neighborhood. 
In mine, they call me ‚Äúthe grass whisperer.‚Äù 
Looking at my lawn, you‚Äôd think I toil relent-
lessly from April clear through to Thanksgiving, 
or pay a small fortune to a lawn service. The truth 
is, I don‚Äôt do either.

Solarization is hard 
work. e plaÔ¨Üic muÔ¨Ü 
be sealed tight to 
prevent heat and water 
vapor from escaping. 
Dig a trench around the 
lawn and use the soil to 
weigh down the plaÔ¨Üic. 
Also use bricks and 
landscape fabric pegs.
e old lawn won‚Äôt go quietly. 
You have to kill it. We scalped it 
low and hard using a lawnmower,  
soaked it with a sprinkler to a 
depth of several inches and then 
suÔ¨Äocated it under rows of plas-
tic sheet. Gruesome but eÔ¨Äeive. 
Except for a weekly mowing, a few squirts of 
weed killer now and then and a well-timed hit of 
fertilizer every autumn, I do little more than 
accept compliments from passersby. I don‚Äôt con-
stantly water, overfeed, aerate, douse with 2,4-D, 
degrub, defungus or dethatch. If I do have a prob-
lem with my turf, it‚Äôs that mowing is sometimes 
difÔ¨Åcult because of how dense the grass grows. I 
know, I know: Shut up. 
To own a good-looking lawn that‚Äôs 
practically on autopilot is a dream 
widely held. The reality is that getting 
to that point requires hefty machin-
ery, callus-inducing labor and an 
enhanced understanding of your 
lawn as a miniature ecosystem. 
Take it from me, it‚Äôs worth it. 
Four years ago the front yard of 
my new home was an unsightly 
mess. Aboveground there was an 
assortment of aggressive weeds. Below 
ground, the soil was compacted by heavy 
construction equipment and depleted of vital 
nutrients. Rather than launch a multiyear cam-
paign to coax life out of the few remaining blades 
of grass, I instead hit the ‚Äúrestart‚Äù button and 
killed my old lawn. 
For reasons mostly practical and somewhat 
philosophical, I wanted my new turf to fend for 
itself against pest and weed invaders. I am not a 
Kool-Aid drinking member of the organic lawn-
care movement, with its earnest advice to make 
‚Äúpeace‚Äù with weeds. But if I am going to resort to 
pesticides or herbicides, I want it to be in 
response to a particular emergency, not as a 
matter of routine.
Healthy lawns need a lot less human interven-
tion than we lavish on them. Set a new lawn on 
the right path at the outset with plenty of organic 
goodness and busy microorganisms in the soil, 
then feed it regularly with mulched clippings and 
autumn leaves, and it will do Ô¨Åne. 
A total yard renovation isn‚Äôt something entered 
into lightly. But in a variety of situations it makes 
sense, according to Peter Landschoot, a turfgrass 
scientist at Penn State University. ‚ÄúIf your lawn 
keeps dying or deteriorating, if your grass is very 
coarse-textured and clumpy or it continuously

are nothing like your father‚Äôs. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs varieties 
are more disease-resistant, they have better tex-
ture, density, color and uniformity, and they tol-
erate drought, cold and wear better than those of 
30 years ago,‚Äù Landschoot says.
LAWN FORENSICS 
YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS KILLING YOUR LAWN. 
BUT WHAT? SCIENCE HAS THE ANSWER, AND THE 
ODDS ARE GOOD THAT THE CULPRIT IS DEPLETED 
AND UNHEALTHY SOIL. 
On a cool morning in early August, in the midst 
of one of the wettest summers in memory, our 
lawn redo project got underway. Not with the clat-
ter of machinery or clank of garden rakes hitting 
pay dirt‚Äîplenty of both would follow soon 
enough‚Äîbut with me lifting small scoops of soil 
from the Aires‚Äô front lawn. These I sent off for 
develops leaf diseases, then it‚Äôs probably time to 
start a new lawn,‚Äù he says. And to that do-over list 
I‚Äôd add a lawn that‚Äôs more weeds than grass. 
The front yard of my neighbors Kevin and 
Karlyn Aires was a prime example of a lawn gone 
past the tipping point. From the street it looked 
respectable, especially after being mowed. Up 
close, however, the picture wasn‚Äôt so pretty. 
Much of the ‚Äúgrass‚Äù was a wide-leaf, clumpy fes-
cue variety called Kentucky 31, commercially 
available decades ago and now deemed worthy 
only of highway medians. Broad-leafed weeds 
like plantain, dandelion and white clover had 
established major beachheads. And undesirable 
and impossible-to-eradicate grassy weeds like 
nimblewill and orchardgrass were on the loose. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of mowing weeds,‚Äù Kevin told me 
one day. With barely any bribing, he and Karlyn 
agreed to submit their lawn to a total renovation 
by Popular Mechanics. And why not? They had 
nothing to lose. 
Starting over would allow the Aires to rectify 
their lawn‚Äôs soil structure and soil health and 
trade in their Dodge Dart‚Äìera grass for the Lexus 
GS 460‚Äìlevel performance churned out by busy 
grass breeders. Indeed, modern grass varieties

analysis at the agricultural extension service at 
Penn State University. 
Before planting a new lawn, it‚Äôs vital to under-
stand why the old one failed. A modestly priced 
soil analysis (pay extra to test levels of organic 
matter) is your best forensic clue. ‚ÄúWas the soil 
low in nutrients, too acidic, did tree limbs over-
grow and create too much shade, was there too 
much foot compaction?‚Äù asks Dennis Martin, a 
turfgrass specialist at Oklahoma State University. 
‚ÄúWithout modifying those conditions, a lawn 
renovation doesn‚Äôt solve your problems.‚Äù 
Just as in painting a house, almost all the 
hard work in replanting a lawn lies in the prepa-
ration. But it is also crucial to schedule the job 
properly. The process begins by pinpointing  
the sweet spot on the calendar for seeding in 
your area, then working backward. In the cool-
season grass zone, which I inhabit (generally 
north of a line drawn between San Francisco and 
Philadelphia), seed should be in the ground 
between the last week of August and the Ô¨Årst two 
weeks of September. In the transition zone (the 
area between a line drawn from San Diego to 
Myrtle Beach, S.C., and south of the boundary 
described above), seed should be sown in mid- to 
late September. Warm-season grasses are 
another beast altogether. In the arc from south 
Texas to Florida, seed or plugs go down in late 
spring to early summer. 
Why plant cool-season grass types like blue-
grass and fescue late in the growing season? Turf 
scientists advise it because competition from 
weeds will be nil, you won‚Äôt have to spend as 
much time watering, and grass naturally devotes 
its energy at that time of year toward building  
all-important root structure. For warm-season 
grasses like zoysia and Bermuda grass, seeding 
needs to happen when the grasses are in their 
active growth phase, which comes before the 
summer heat arrives in full.  
Figuring that the active phase of our lawn 
renovation‚Äîfrom killing off the old lawn 
to putting seed in the ground‚Äîwould 
gobble up at least four weeks‚Äô time, I 
knew we had to have all of our sup-
plies and equipment on hand and 
be ready to go by early August. 
A key decision in the planning 
process is selecting the right type 
of grass to grow. In this, your state 
cooperative extension service‚Äôs web-
site is an excellent resource. There 
you‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd the results of Ô¨Åeld trials of 
speciÔ¨Åc cultivars under growing condi-
tions that closely approximate yours. For 
instance, Penn State University‚Äôs cooperative 
extension details the performance of Tomahawk 
e Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü Ô¨Üage of 
solarization kills 
everything but a 
few hardy survivors 
here and there. 
Yank these weeds 
or grass sprigs by 
hand. If a shrink-
wrapped lawn isn‚Äôt 
for you, two applica-
tions of a herbicide 
like Roundup spaced 
two weeks apart 
will also work. 
SOLARIZATION, STAGE ONE
SOLARIZATION, STAGE TWO
Roll up plaÔ¨Üic and set it aside. Till 
the lawn under, adding amendments 
if necessary, then rake and roll the 
lawn to smooth and gently compa 
it. Complete the kill by putting the 
plaÔ¨Üic down for a second time.

RT and 67 other tall fescues and 103 bluegrasses. 
For even more timely results on the very latest 
seed varieties, go to the National Turfgrass Eval-
uation Program‚Äôs website (ntep.org) and scan  
the results of turf trials from 30 locations around 
the country. 
For the Aires‚Äô lawn, same as mine, we chose a 
mix of turf-type tall fescues. Deep-rooted, heat-
tolerant and slow-growing up top, tall fescues 
require less watering and mowing than Kentucky 
bluegrass. They also demand less fertilizer and 
aren‚Äôt prone to thatch buildup. Perfect, in other 
words, for a low-maintenance lawn in southeast 
Pennsylvania. Fescues falter the farther north you 
live, where Kentucky bluegrass thrives. 
To purchase elite performance seed varieties 
suited to your particular climate and soil type, 
you‚Äôll probably need to look beyond local nurser-
ies and big-box home centers, where one-size-
Ô¨Åts-all mixtures are the rule. Web-based Seed-
SuperStore and Seedland offer many of the best 
varieties singly and in blends. Turf experts like 
Landschoot and Martin advise planting no fewer 
than four or Ô¨Åve varieties of a particular type of 
grass (e.g. Kentucky bluegrass) to avoid mass die-
off caused by disease or weather extremes. 
DIE, LAWN, DIE 
NOW IT‚ÄôS TIME TO GET MEDIEVAL ON YOUR SORRY 
EXCUSE FOR A LAWN. A NICE DOUSING OF 
ROUNDUP WILL DO THE TRICK. SO WILL PLASTIC 
SHEET AND LIBERAL APPLICATIONS OF SUNLIGHT. 
If you ever want to get a rise out of the neighbors, 
wrap your front yard in plastic. That‚Äôs what we 
did when it came time to kill off the Aires‚Äô old 
lawn. As I unrolled plastic sheeting under a blaz-
ing summer sun, dog walkers paused and land-
scape contractors drove by at a crawl. Normally, 
I‚Äôd terminate a lawn with two sprayings of a 
broad-spectrum weed and grass killer such as 
Roundup, spaced two weeks apart. The first 
spraying kills most of the lawn. The followup 
application catches any survivors. Then you wait 
at least 10 days from that last shot of Roundup 

88  A P R I L  2 0 1 0   |   P O P U L A R M E C H A N I C S . C O M
before planting seed. 
Kevin and Karlyn Aires, being organic gar-
deners, weren‚Äôt having any part of Roundup. (I 
did my best to explain that Roundup is actually 
quite environmentally friendly, but they didn‚Äôt 
see it that way.) Without that chemical cudgel, 
our best weapon was solarization, by which the 
lawn and any weed seeds lurking in the soil are 
steam-heated into oblivion after one month 
beneath a layer of clear plastic. Done correctly, 
solarization sterilizes the top 6 inches of soil by 
raising temperatures above 140 degrees Fahr-
enheit. We weren‚Äôt so lucky. 
It took 17 man-hours of labor to 
cover the 1500-square-foot lawn  
in plastic and seal it tight at  
the edges with excavated soil. 
Then the rains returned and 
the clouds lingered. The  
maximum temperature we 
achieved was 105 degrees, 
just enough to kill the exist-
ing grass, but not hot enough 
to force dormant weed seeds 
to germinate and die off. Our 
plan was also hampered by the 
fact that the 3-mm plastic we pur-
chased‚Äîdescribed as ‚Äúclear‚Äù on the 
label‚Äîwas actually closer to white. And that 
meant that even when the sun did shine, those 
rays tended to reflect off the sheet rather than 
baking the soil underneath. Final analysis: Solar-
ization is not worth the effort unless you‚Äôre a die-
hard environmentalist, or you like attention. ‚ÄúIt 
was great fun giving passing neighbors something 
new to talk about,‚Äù Kevin says in retrospect. 
How you go about handling the next stage of  
a lawn renovation‚Äîpreparing the soil for  
seeding‚Äîwill depend on the results of your soil 
test. If the test shows your soil is in good shape 
and needs no amendments, then consider your-
self lucky. You can quickly prepare a seedbed 
employing the same method used at Penn State‚Äôs 
turf research farm. Chew the lawn up by making 
eight to 10 passes with a rented core aerator. 
Apply seed-starter fertilizer as necessary. Then 
break up the plugs and furrow the lawn with a 
vertical mower, also known as a dethatcher. Make 
two to four passes in a crisscross pattern to kick 
up more dirt for better seed contact. 
Better-quality dethatchers also function as slit 
seeders, laying down seed in a narrow furrow. If 
your machine has that capability, now‚Äôs the time 
to make use of it. Otherwise, broadcast seed 
using a lawn spreader.
On my neighbors‚Äô lawn, because of dips and 
bumps that needed leveling, we instead rented a 
6-hp rototiller to loosen the soil. A rototiller has 
Cover the seeded 
area with hay (dried 
grass) or Ô¨Üraw 
(dried grain Ô¨Üalks). 
Either works as 
mulch but muÔ¨Ü 
be certiÔ¨Åed from a 
Ô¨Üate agricultural 
department or other 
organization to be 
free of weed seed. 
Keep the lawn moiÔ¨Ü 
for the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü three 
weeks, applying 
extra water if condi-
tions are especially 
hot or windy. Avoid 
forming puddles.
AT LAST, GRASS SEED
COVER UP
Aer enduring comments and 
queÔ¨Üions from neighbors, it feels 
good to spread seed. Do less vis-
ible areas Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü to perfe an even 
spread pattern. Twenty seeds per 
square inch is ideal coverage.

the advantage of thoroughly mixing lime, fertil-
izer and any other amendment into the top 6 
inches of soil. The disadvantage is it leaves plenty 
of rake work in its wake. Ideally, one should use a 
sod cutter to remove the layer of dead grass and 
weeds before tilling. Clumps of dead vegetation 
made raking and grading much more difÔ¨Åcult. 
It‚Äôs necessary to pack down a lawn that‚Äôs been 
rototilled. Rake it smooth, then use a lawn roller. 
You want to be able to step on the soil when it‚Äôs 
dry and not sink in. In our case, we put the plastic 
down a second time and seeded after we removed 
the plastic. If you‚Äôre not solarizing, spread seed, 
then drag a metal leaf rake across the lawn in sev-
eral passes at right angles to mix dirt and seed. 
Spread by hand a mulching layer of straw that‚Äôs 
certiÔ¨Åed to contain no weed seeds. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt put on 
too much. You want to see a little of the soil 
through the mulch,‚Äù Landschoot says. We used 
salt hay, a weed- and seed-free mulch available in 
the Northeast. Mulch prevents seed from wash-
ing away in a heavy rain, retains soil moisture and 
shields seedlings from blazing sun. Now, pass 
over the lawn with the lawn roller Ô¨Ålled partially 
with water to establish good contact between 
seeds and soil. 
The rest of the operation involves daily to 
twice-daily watering to keep the topmost layer of 
soil moist. We experienced every grass guy‚Äôs worst 
nightmare the night after planting: an unex-
pected torrential rainfall. In the deluge, seed 
migrated into clumps, leaving some areas bare. 
But after the seeds germinated, we simply 
reseeded the bald spots. 
By late fall the lawn was thick, green and uni-
form. Come summer, it will be ready for heavy 
trafÔ¨Åc. And then the Aires will learn that, with the 
hard work over, they can best appreciate their 
new lawn the way I do mine: watching it grow 
from the comfort of a lawn chair.

WE BATTLE THROUGH A JIGSAW SHOWDOWN. BY ROY BERENDSOHN
 Few things are as useful around 
the house and shop as a jigsaw. It‚Äôs a 
hacksaw, a fine woodworking tool 
and a rough-cutting conÔ¨Üruion saw 
rolled into one. It makes straight, 
curved and beveled cuts, and does 
work that would be diÔ¨Écult to accom-
plish by hand‚Äîsuch as cutting square 
holes in a panel. 
We gathered six of the biggeÔ¨Ü and 
tougheÔ¨Ü jigsaws we could Ô¨Ånd. en 
we teÔ¨Üed them using a fresh bimetal 
Lenox blade in each. At the end of the 
day, we had a clear winner and some 
close contenders. Here‚Äôs our report.

packs a fair amount of 
common sense‚Äîthe blade 
orbit is controlled with a 
lever on the side of the saw 
marked 0 to 3, and to 
release the blade, you simply 
pivot the blade guard 
forward. ere‚Äôs not a

Dislikes: e saw lacks 
tool-free shoe adjuÔ¨Üment.
Likes: is is a saw for the 
reÔ¨Ü of us. If you don‚Äôt use a 
jigsaw every day, then you‚Äôll 
appreciate the little chart on 
the side that matches 
cutting speed/orbital aion 
to the material. Need to 
pivot the shoe? JuÔ¨Ü swing 
the large lever beneath the 
motor. And no need to guess 
about the shoe angle. It‚Äôs 
clearly indicated on the 
shoe‚Äôs arch-shaped top.

Floating a  
Shelf Idea
Q 
I‚Äôm fascinated with 
Ô¨Çoating shelves. I‚Äôve built 
one‚Äîit looked okay, but a 
little rough. What‚Äôs the right 
way to do this? 
qq mqqq	
A Ô¨Çoating shelf is nothing more than a hollow box 
built out of plywood and pine. e box‚Äôs top and 
bottom panels reÔ¨Ü in rabbets cut into the sides 
and front, which are mitered at the front corners. 
e wall cleat is a piece of 2 x 4 sawed to width.
by Roy Berendsohn
A 
Floating shelves are making a 
comeback. I‚Äôm not sure when they 
Ô¨Årst came into being, but PM was cov-
ering them as early as the 1950s. Like 
many old ideas, they‚Äôve received a 
boost as new homeowners have dis-
covered their clean and simple look.
One basic execution is to bore a pair 
of holes into wall Ô¨Üuds, insert metal 
bars or wood dowels into the framing 
and slip a solid wood shelf over the sup-
ports. e problem with this design is 
that the holes in the framing and the 
shelf have to be very carefully bored so 
they are parallel to one another and in 
the same plane. Otherwise the shelf 
won‚Äôt easily slip over the supports.
Our design (shown at right) has more 
parts, but it‚Äôs still easy to build and 
inÔ¨Üall. It‚Äôs forgiving of small inaccura-
cies in construction and installation. 
Build the shelf, which is nothing more 
than a small hollow box, and test 
Ô¨Åt the wall cleat in it. en simply attach 
the wall cleat to the Ô¨Üuds, slip the shelf 
over it and screw the shelf to the cleat. 
Although it‚Äôs ideal to mount the cleat to 
two Ô¨Üuds, you can also attach it to a 
Ô¨Üud on one end and use a hollow wall 
anchor at the other end.
Pulling Up a Seat

on all three toilets in our house, but 
the nuts holding them in place are very

on one side and almoÔ¨Ü none on the 
other. How can I get the old ones oÔ¨Ä?
e plumber probably attached the seat 
and lid before installing the toilet. 
Removing them someday was going to 
be somebody else‚Äôs problem. You can 
do the same thing in reverse, but that‚Äôs 
the hard way to go about it.
My faÔ¨Ü and painless method is to 
remove the lid, then saw the head oÔ¨Ä 
the seat bolt using a reciprocating saw 
and an 8-inch, 18-tpi (teeth per inch) 
metal-cutting blade. Flex the blade so 
that it cuts the head of the bolt juÔ¨Ü a 
hair above the porcelain surface. is 
requires a few things: a Ô¨Üeady hand, a 
good saw (one with plenty of power and 
very little vibration) and a flexible 
bimetal blade. Don‚Äôt skimp on the saw 
or the blade‚Äîyou can easily snap the 
blade when it‚Äôs halfway through the 
bolt, or get it Ô¨Üuck. I use a Lenox blade 
chucked in a Milwaukee Super Sawzall. 
Works like a charm and takes about 20 
to 30 seconds per bolt. One other tip: 
I‚Äôve seen plumbers pull this oÔ¨Ä without 
leaving the tinieÔ¨Ü scuÔ¨Ä on the porcelain. 
But when I do it, I prote the top of the 
bowl with a Ô¨Ürip of elerical tape. Still, 
if you scuÔ¨Ä the bowl slightly, don‚Äôt worry. 
e marks come oÔ¨Ä with a damp cloth 
and a gentle abrasive cleanser like Bon 
Ami or Bar Keepers Friend.
If you don‚Äôt own a top-quality saw, 
try using a deep-well socket Ô¨Åtted on a 
socket wrench to turn the nut oÔ¨Ä the 
bolt. Using an articulating universal 
joint or an extension on the socket may 
help you get at the troublesome nut 
more easily.
Finally, if all else fails, hose the bolt 
threads down with a spray lubricant like 
Liquid Wrench or WD-40, then patiently 
turn the nut oÔ¨Ä the bolt, one tiny twiÔ¨Ü 
at a time. Do that once, though, and a 
reciprocating saw will suddenly seem 
like a bargain.

e Varnish Truth
I‚Äôm buying my son an unÔ¨Ånished pine 
bed. I‚Äôm debating whether I should use 
a Ô¨Üain Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü and then apply a Ô¨Ånish on 
top of that, or whether I should juÔ¨Ü 
apply a clear coating. Also, I‚Äôm 
wondering about the choice between 
shellac and varnish. Which is beÔ¨Ü?
ere‚Äôs no single right answer here‚Äî
there are dozens of diÔ¨Äerent ways to 
Ô¨Ånish even a simple proje. So, I‚Äôll out-
line the three moÔ¨Ü basic approaches.
‚ÜíStain and clear coat This will 
require that you apply a Ô¨Üain (or wood 
dye) and at leaÔ¨Ü three coats of Ô¨Ånish, 
each carefully abraded to smooth out 
irregularities and duÔ¨Ü specks. e Ô¨Üain 
or dye can be a gel or a liquid. As to its 
chemistry, it can be formulated with 
alcohol, petroleum solvents or water. 
e same holds true with the topcoat, 
applied over the Ô¨Üain or dye. It can be a 
gel, or a liquid formulated with alcohol, 
petroleum solvents or water.
My favorite method is to wipe on a 
gel Ô¨Üain and then wipe on several coats 
of gel varnish. It‚Äôs easy, it highlights the 
woodgrain and there‚Äôs minimal mess.
‚ÜíTinted clear Ô¨Ånish is is simply 
a clear Ô¨Ånish with a dye or Ô¨Üain added. 
You brush it on, let it dry, abrade it per 
the directions and apply subsequent 
coats. e more coats you apply, the 
more you obscure the woodgrain.
‚ÜíClear Ô¨Ånish is is the simpleÔ¨Ü 
route. You brush on or wipe on multiple 
coats of a gel or a liquid clear Ô¨Ånish, 
abrading carefully between coats. 
Although this Ô¨Ånish doesn‚Äôt highlight the 
woodgrain the same way a Ô¨Üain does, 
it can be very attraive.
You ask a good queÔ¨Üion about the 
diÔ¨Äerence between varnish and shellac, 
a conÔ¨Üant source of confusion. A var-
nish is any clear or slightly amber coat-
ing. Chemically, it can be one of a num-
ber of different compounds in which 
globules of resin are suspended in a sol-
vent‚Äîwater, alcohol or a petroleum-
based liquid. When you spread the 
material on a proje, you dramatically 
increase the exposure of its resin and 
solvents relative to the surrounding 
atmosphere. is causes the solvent to 
evaporate (or volatize) into the air. e 
resin globules coalesce and harden, 
forming a plaÔ¨Üic Ô¨Ålm. (To reduce air pol-
lution from volatile organic compounds

Grounding prevents 
a conduor not 
meant to carry 
current (such as the 
metal side of a 
clothes dryer) from 
causing injury if it‚Äôs 
energized by a 
frayed hot wire. In a

conne back to the 
grounding bus of 
the breaker panel. 
From there, the 
syÔ¨Üem is grounded 
to the earth via 
buried ground rods. 
NEUTRAL AND
  HOT WIRES
Current Ô¨Çows from 
the panel toward the 
load along the hot 
wires and returns 
along the neutral. 
Each hot wire‚Äôs 
copper tip ultimately 
connes to its 
control switch at the

Arc-fault-circuit-

Ventricular Ô¨Åbrillation, the erratic, lethal spasm that occurs as 
electric current passes through the heart, happens when both of a 
person‚Äôs hands touch hot and neutral conductors, causing the 
current to complete its circuit through the chest. In a ground fault, 
current can Ô¨Çow into a single hand, zapping the heart as it passes 
through the body on its way to the ground. When changing live 
fuses in the old days, electricians worked with one hand while 
keeping the other in their back pocket‚Äîthis spared the heart by 
isolating the current to the nerves of the one hand in the fuse box.

THE SMART  
GRID IN YOUR 
BASEMENT
Found in electrical reference books everywhere, the Ohm‚Äôs law 
wheel simpliÔ¨Åes conversions between watts, volts, ohms and amps. 
The most important calculation for a consumer is voltage times 
amperage, which equals wattage‚Äîan appliance‚Äôs power require-
ments‚Äîand the basis of the unit in which electricity is sold.  
Watts (W) = voltage (E) x amps (I). 
Example: A 240-volt eleric water heater, drawing 18.75 amps 
current, consumes 4500 watts. (Used for an hour, it consumes 4.5 
kilowatt-hours, or kwh.) At a U.S. average of 11 cents/kwh, about 50 
cents buys an hour of full-tilt water heating.

‚Üí In a power outage, a backup generator provides elericity to designated 
circuit breakers. Natural gas or propane fuels the generator‚Äôs engine, which 
spins an alternator to create a magnetic Ô¨Åeld that sends current to the home. 
It‚Äôs critical that no elericity from the generator back-feeds to the grid‚Äîlines-
men working to reÔ¨Üore power could be elerocuted. An automatic transfer 
switch isolates the generator‚Äôs elericity to keep it oÔ¨Ä the grid until power is 
reÔ¨Üored. en the generator shuts down and the transfer switch reverses.
‚Üí Solar panels and wind turbines feed DC power into an inverter, which 
converts it to AC for home use. AC and DC disconne switches allow parts 
to be isolated for service. ese syÔ¨Üems conÔ¨Üantly back-feed to the grid, 
but during a blackout‚Äîto some grid-tied cuÔ¨Üomers‚Äô surprise‚Äîtheir power 
can‚Äôt be used. One solution: Store power in a battery backup syÔ¨Üem. 
Inverters like Outback Power‚Äôs Flexpower One cut equipment coÔ¨Üs with 
prewired battery conneions and circuit breakers. New micro-inverters 
convert DC to AC at the panel, eliminating DC wiring runs. 
As home-brewed electricity gets 
more sophisticated, expect to see 
items now sold as separate 
hardware‚Äîsuch as solar panel 
inverters and AC/DC disconnects, 
or generator subpanels and 
transfer switches‚Äîmerge into 
single, standard parts, which are 
easier to install and understand.

dation drain syÔ¨Üem or a lawn surface. 
For example, you can‚Äôt discharge wash-
ing machines or dishwashers into them 
to reduce the load on a septic syÔ¨Üem.
By the way, if you‚Äôre like me, you 
probably wonder if there isn‚Äôt a better 
name for these Ô¨Üruures. Maybe yard 
drain or some other descriptor is more 
apt, since all a drywell does is a as a 
subsurface basin that holds water until 
it can percolate into the ground. 
In general, it‚Äôs best to keep dry-
wells as far from the foundation as 
possible to prevent water from migrat-
ing into the basement or crawlspace. 
A 10-foot minimum is a good rule of 
thumb. Also, it‚Äôs a good idea to line 
the well with geotextile Ô¨Ålter fabric to 
prevent Ô¨Åne soil particles from clog-
ging it. Once clogged, it won't dis-
charge water into the soil. Finally, 
check with your municipality whether 
it‚Äôs necessary to pull a permit for this.

worth inÔ¨Üalling one in my attic. I live 
in Texas, and you would think that it 
makes sense in a hot and sunny 
climate like this one.
Yes, a radiant barrier can reduce heat 
transfer from the attic to the room 
below if the attic is poorly insulated. It 
may cut energy coÔ¨Üs from 5 to 12 
percent by bouncing as much as 
95 percent of the heat out of the attic 
and into the atmosphere outside. A 
number of Ô¨Üudies, including some per-
formed by the Florida Solar Energy 
Center, have shown the benefit of 
these barriers when the attic is insu-
lated to a level of R-19 or less. eir 
beneÔ¨Åt declines the more the attic is 
insulated and is essentially nonexis-
tent when the attic is insulated to 
R-30 or above.

when using a varnish, look for prod-
us labeled Low VOC or No VOC.)
Shellac is a natural or slightly 
amber clear coating formed from the 
dried secretion of the lac bug. Some-
times it‚Äôs called shellac varnish. e 
material is dried, cleaned, ground up 
and thinned with alcohol. Durable and 
faÔ¨Ü-drying, it‚Äôs among the oldeÔ¨Ü of 
wood Ô¨Ånishes. It can be easily dam-
aged by water, however, including the 
condensation that comes oÔ¨Ä a damp 
glass. Many other types of varnish 
(including those formulated with poly-
urethane resins) are far more mois-
ture-resiÔ¨Üant than shellac.
Washer Woes
We have a two-year-old dishwasher 
that up until recently performed 
very well. Now this $800 appliance 
is noisy and the dishes come out 
damp. at‚Äôs bad, but what‚Äôs worse 
is that the dishwasher also gives oÔ¨Ä 
a dank odor. We thought the 
problem might have something to 
do with our inÔ¨Üantaneous gas 
water heater, which was also giving 
us problems. We‚Äôve replaced that, 
but it‚Äôs had no eÔ¨Äe.
My Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü guess was that the appliance 
has a bad heating element, but that 
wouldn‚Äôt explain why it‚Äôs noisy, so I 
called Chris Hall, president of repair 
clinic.com, a Web-based provider of 
repair information and replacement 
parts. ‚ÄúWashers that don‚Äôt get enough 
water have the symptoms you 
describe,‚Äù Hall says. ‚Äúey‚Äôre noisy and 
have poor wash performance.‚Äù The 
solution may be to replace the water 
inlet valve. ‚Äúat o	en solves a hoÔ¨Ü of 
dishwasher problems,‚Äù he says.
e valve is aivated by a solenoid, 
a simple eleromagnetic gate. When 
the coil in the solenoid is energized, 
the valve is open and it admits water. 
But if there‚Äôs a break in the solenoid 
coil or if the valve is plugged with min-
eral deposits, the dishwasher will per-
form erratically. Food will be only par-
tially removed from the dishes, and the 
food particles that are washed off 
won‚Äôt be suspended in enough water 
to be Ô¨Çushed out of the appliance‚Äî
hence the naÔ¨Üy odor. Finally, low water 
volume inhibits detergent aion, and 
this can cause water to cling to the 
dishes rather than sheet oÔ¨Ä, so 
the dishes come out damp.
Drywell, Good Well?
My yard gets Ô¨Çooded from 
runoÔ¨Ä Ô¨Çowing out of my 
gutter downspouts. I was 
thinking of inÔ¨Üalling two 
drywells, one at each 
downspout. A neighbor told 
me they are illegal. Is a 
drywell a bad idea? Why 
would it be illegal?
A drywell can be as simple as a 
gravel-Ô¨Ålled pit or it can be as 
complex as a perforated con-
crete vault with dimensions 
speciÔ¨Åed by the municipality. In 
moÔ¨Ü cases, drywells are legal, 
but many municipalities do 
have rules that govern their 
design and use. Typically, wells 
can‚Äôt receive water from any-
thing other than a roof, a foun-

Saggy-Door Blues
REPLACING WORN-OUT DOOR-HINGE BUSHINGS IS QUICK, INEXPENSIVE‚Äî
AND WILL MAKE YOUR DOOR SHUT LIKE NEW. BY MIKE ALLEN
Late, late, late for work. The 
clock is ticking, so you sprint from the 
parking lot to the oÔ¨Éce building at top 
speed‚Äîand hope you don‚Äôt lose your 
shoes. You take one laÔ¨Ü glance across 
the lot to check on your car, and see 
that your driver‚Äôs door is open. Rats. 
You double-time to the car and slam 
the door‚Äîwhich simply bounces back 
open. A second attempt, mightier 
than the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü, only bounces it back fur-
ther, right into your knee. Ouch. You

hip to click it shut. What a pain. Guess 
what? Your door hinges are worn out.
How Much?
 A mechanic, supposedly a good, 
honeÔ¨Ü one, had told the driver of this 
‚Äô90s Jeep Grand Cherokee that the 
door hinges needed to be replaced, and 
that Jeep didn‚Äôt make the parts any-
more. Used hinges were ordered from a 
salvage yard, and the bill was eÔ¨Üimated 
to come in at $400 to $500. 
We‚Äôll give the mechanic some credit 
(his expertise is in engines, brakes and 
suspensions, not bodywork) for being 
honeÔ¨Ü in his eÔ¨Üimate. But we knew bet-
ter. Cutting out the old hinges and weld-
ing in new ones would probably cost 
about that much, but it wasn‚Äôt neces-
sary. Why spend a couple of days replac-
ing the hinge when all that‚Äôs worn 
out are some simple bushings? A 
trip to the NAPA auto parts Ô¨Üore 
and a few minutes of browsing 
the catalogs turned up a Dorman 
part number speciÔ¨Åc to our Jeep. 
And plenty of other vehicles were 
liÔ¨Üed, all the domeÔ¨Üics and Asian 
and European cars as well. 
In fa, the dimensions‚Äîthe 
inside and outside diameter of 
the bushings, the pin diameter 
and the overall length‚Äîare liÔ¨Üed 
in the catalog. If there isn‚Äôt a kit, a 
clever Saturday Mechanic could 
probably mix and match enough 
parts to Ô¨Åx darned near any door. 
A minute‚Äôs worth of detective 
work proved that the pin on our 
Jeep was 0.372 inches, nomi-
nally 3‚ÅÑ8 of an inch. And the outer 
diameter of the bushings was 
0.503 inches, a nice press-Ô¨Åt for 
a half-inch hole. Yours will be sim-
ilar but probably not the same.
try a kinder, gentler slam, and realize 
the end of the door has sagged a good 
inch from its original position. e only 
way to close the door is to use both 
hands on the handle (chipping a Ô¨Ånger-
nail) and li	 the 75-pound door up until 
the latch matches the height of the 
door Ô¨Üriker, and then bump it with your

1. Got the 
door-hinge repair 
kit in hand, and a 
jack or a faithful 
minion to support 
the door for a few 
minutes?  The only 
real hard part of 
this procedure is 
removing the old 
pin, which has 
probably been 
peened over to 
keep it from 
coming out.   
We tried a grinder, 
a cold chisel and a  
Ô¨Åle on the 
hardened pin, and 
ultimately used a 
carbide burr on a 
die grinder to 
remove the pin‚Äôs 
lip. You could use a 
cutoÔ¨Ä wheel on a 
Dremel tool to cut 
the pin in half, as 
well. Wear eye 
proteion.
2. en  we simply 
tapped the pin 
out with a punch,  
although here we 
show you how to 
do it on a hinge 
removed from  
a wrecked car. 
3. Once the pin is 
loose you can 
unbolt the inner 
hinge half from 
the car‚Äôs A-pillar 
and remove it to 
the workbench.

shop, and lifted the open door up 
slightly with a Ô¨Çoor jack to unweight 
the hinge. No Ô¨Çoor jack? A Ô¨Üack of 2 x 
4 scraps or a scissors jack will do. Even 
a patient assiÔ¨Üant who doesn‚Äôt mind 
reverse-curling a car door for 10 min-
utes or so will do. Don‚Äôt let the door 
hang by only one hinge, leÔ¨Ü the remain-
ing hinge bend.
Some OEM door-hinge pins are 
retained by E-rings or cotter pins, mak-
ing their removal trivial. JuÔ¨Ü pop out 
the cotter or E-ring, and push the hinge 
pin out. Ours was swaged into place, 
requiring us to grind the head of the old 
pin down. If you plan on rebushing a lot 
of doors, there are special tools to press 
the pins out. Regardless, you‚Äôll need to 
remove the pin somehow.
With the pins tapped out, it‚Äôs a sim-
ple task to remove the inner hinge by 
unscrewing the bolts that hold it to the 
A-pillar. Press or tap the new bushings 
into the removed hinge half. InÔ¨Üalla-
tion is the reverse of this procedure. 
With a friend or a jack holding the door 
so all the holes line up, tap the pin into 
place. Odds are the pin is tapered 
slightly to help get it Ô¨Üarted. Lightly 
tighten the hinge bolts.
Our Jeep‚Äôs pin had to be tapped in 
from the bottom, to clear the door 
sheet metal. Although the 
head of the pin was knurled 
to hold it into its gravity- 
defying place, we elected 
for a more positive reten-
tion syÔ¨Üem; we juÔ¨Ü tacked 
it with a MIG welder.
Now close the door. It 
should line up properly with 
the fender or door, front and 
rear. If not, loosen the bolts 
slightly, and reposition the 
inner hinge half to make it Ô¨Åt 
properly. Tighten the bolts.
Belt and 
Suspenders
To repair that top hinge, 
we inveÔ¨Üed a total of about 
10 minutes. Surprisingly, 
the lower hinge bushings 
were very lightly worn, so 
we le	 them alone. If you 
need to tighten up the 
lower hinge, Ô¨Ånish the top 
hinge first, and align the 
door. en tackle the lower 
hinge. There are two rea-
sons for this: FirÔ¨Ü oÔ¨Ä, there 
are probably a bunch of 
wires that run into the door 
to run power windows and 
locks, and you don‚Äôt want 
to have to hold the door Ô¨Üill 
enough to keep from tear-
ing them free as both 
hinges are disconnected. 
Secondly, realigning the 
door will be much simpler 
one hinge at a time.
FC
Lipped Oilite bronze bushings are 
available at induÔ¨Ürial supply houses in a 
dizzying array of sizes. A pair of these 
and a length of bar Ô¨Üock would let you 
make almoÔ¨Ü any car door Ô¨Åt.
We didn‚Äôt need to go to those 
lengths. We found a $6.95 kit for this 
truck at the auto parts Ô¨Üore‚Äîalthough 
we did have to order it. We walked into 
the Ô¨Üore at 8:45 am and had the part in 
our hand right a	er lunch. Nice.
Li	 and Separate
We pulled the truck into the

worn-out bushings 
from the hinge 
half.  e worn 
OEM bushings 
were made of brass 
cloth wrapped with 
some sort of Ô¨Åber, 
and had worn until 
there was 
metal-to-metal 
conta, allowing 
the door to droop 
nearly an inch.
5. e replacement 
bushings are made 
of oil-impregnated 
bronze, and 
promise to outlaÔ¨Ü 
the originals‚Äî
although we can‚Äôt 
really complain 
about the service 
life of door-hinge 
bushings that have 
seen 145,000 miles 
of service in heavy 
urban driving with 
lots of door-opening 
aivity.  We simply 
tapped the new 
bushings into place 
lightly with a 
hammer.  e lip on 
the new bushings 
goes where the lip 
on the old bushings 
was, at the top and 
bottom of the  
hinge arms. 
6. Now you can 
inÔ¨Üall the hinge 
back to the  
A-pillar with the 
bolts Ô¨Ånger-tight. 
With a little help, 
line up the holes 
and tap the  
new hinge pin  
into place.  e  
pin on our Jeep  
had to come in 
from the bottom 
because the door 
sheet metal  
was in the way.

This is one of my favorite com-
plaints about new cars. Specifi-
cally, that manufacturers exclude a  
10 cent zerk fitting on the ball joints 
and steering tie-rod ends of their vehi-
cles. That way, when the grease dries 
out in a couple of years, the joint quickly 
wears out, and you have to replace the 
part. Pumping in a nickel‚Äôs worth of 
grease twice a year would save hun-
dreds of dollars of parts and labor when 
they fail prematurely.
So, I juÔ¨Ü thumb my nose at planned 
obsolescence and add the Ô¨Åttings. (Sur-
prisingly, virtually all replacement fit-
tings‚Äîeven the ones made by the OEM 
suppliers as exa replacements‚Äîhave 
the proper grease fitting in the box 
when you buy them at the parts Ô¨Üore. 
Go Ô¨Ågure.) It‚Äôs easy to do: 
Start by drilling a 3‚ÅÑ16-inch hole in  
the sheet-metal cap on the bottom of 
the joint. Odds are you can do this with-
out removing the part from the car, 
although for some tie-rod ends, you 
might need to unhook them to get 
clearance for the drill to run in Ô¨Üraight. 
Coat the drill with grease and go slowly 
at the end to capture moÔ¨Ü of the chips. 
Now use a small pipe tap that matches 
your Ô¨Åtting to thread the hole. Again, 
pack the Ô¨Çutes on the tap with grease 
to catch moÔ¨Ü of the chips.
Q 
I read in one of your old columns that it‚Äôs possible 
to add a grease Ô¨Åtting to the destined-for-failure 
‚Äúsealed‚Äù ball joints 
on new cars.  
How can I do this?
P H O T O G R A P H  B Y  J A S O N  H A M I L T O N
Now you can juÔ¨Ü thread in the Ô¨Åt-
ting. Be aware there are several Ô¨Üyles 
of zerk Ô¨Åttings. You may need a Ô¨Üraight, 
45- or 90-degree zerk to allow the 
grease gun to hook onto the end of the 
Ô¨Åtting. Don‚Äôt forget the little rubber cap 
to keep the end of the Ô¨Åtting clean. Now 
all you have to do is pump some grease 
into the Ô¨Åtting every 6 months or so. 
Add grease until the boot is turgid, and 
grease is leaking out of the seams. Your 
front suspension will thank you.
Fore!
I have a 48-volt eleric golf cart with 
dead batteries. Can I replace the eight 
6-volt batteries with four 12-volt 
deep-cycle marine batteries? 
Short answer: Yes. As you‚Äôve probably 
Ô¨Ågured, it‚Äôll be a lot cheaper. Long 
answer: You might not want to. 
Okay, you might need to make some 
minor changes to the wiring harness. And 
don‚Äôt forget to tie the new batteries down 
so they can‚Äôt bounce, both as a matter of 
      Many OEM tie-rod ends and  
 ball joints can  
 be drilled and  
 tapped to inÔ¨Üall  
 a grease Ô¨Åtting,  
 which should  
 double their  
 life span.

more rapidly as well, because you‚Äôll be 
asking them to deliver more than they‚Äôre 
‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù with. 
A better alternative would be six 
8-volt Ô¨Çoor-polisher batteries. Unfortu-
nately, that swap won‚Äôt be cheap either. 
Look around for used or even refur-
bished floor-polisher batteries‚Äîyou 
might get lucky.
Drinking Games
e gasoline I use contains approxi-
mately 10 percent methanol. Is it 
necessary to add isopropyl-alcohol 
fuel-line drier to the fuel to remove 
condensed water from the fuel tank?
FirÔ¨Ü oÔ¨Ä, I sincerely doubt your gasoline 
contains any methanol. And virtually all 
of the car manufaurers prohibit the use 
of more than 5 percent methanol in their 
safety and to keep the vibrations from 
cracking the batteries‚Äô internal plates.
ose four marine batteries you want 
to use have substantially less energy 
capacity than the eight 6-volters you‚Äôre 
replacing, unless the 6-volters are pretty 
small. While batteries vary, overall weight 
is a pretty good predior of the energy-
Ô¨Üorage capacity of a Ô¨Çooded-cell deep-
cycle battery. If the capacity of the new 
battery pack is less, you‚Äôll be drawing a 
lot more current, relatively speaking. And 
the battery discharge rate isn‚Äôt linear. 
Drawing 50 percent more current could 
reduce the battery capacity by an 
amount subÔ¨Üantially more than 50 per-
cent. Halving the size of the battery pack 
could reduce your range to only a quar-
ter of the original pack‚Äôs range. The 
smaller battery pack will sulfate and fail

Tighten Your Belt
Poly-V belts seem to laÔ¨Ü 
a lot longer than the 
old-fashioned V-belt ever 
did. It‚Äôs not unusual for a 
belt that uses a spring-
loaded automatic 
tensioner to laÔ¨Ü 100,000 
miles or longer. But like 
any moving part, these 
belts eventually wear out 
too. It‚Äôs easy to see some 
of the signs of imminent 
failure, like weather-
checked rubber or the 
dangling Ô¨Ürings of the 
reinforcing fabric 
whipping around. ese 
both mean it‚Äôs time to 
hang a new belt.
ose are cata-
Ô¨Ürophic failures. Normal 
wear is more insidious. 
e failure mode here is 
that the rubber lining the 
grooves is wearing out, a 
bigger problem for 
vehicles that run in duÔ¨Üy 
or sandy environments.  
A belt can be so worn 
that it Ô¨Üarts to slip, juÔ¨Ü  
a little, before the 
reinforcing cord shows or 
the rubber Ô¨Üarts to look 
like alligator shoes. But 
how worn is worn out? 
Gates Rubber manu- 
faures moÔ¨Ü of the 
replacement belts in the 
U.S. market. ey‚Äôve got 
a clever gauge that will 
tell you when a belt has 
exceeded its wear limit. 
Slide the gauge into a 
groove in the belt and run 
your Ô¨Ånger over the 
groove. If you can feel the 
gauge Ô¨Üanding proud in 
the ribs, Ô¨Åne. If not, time 
for replacement. You can

vehicles. It‚Äôs highly corrosive, and the 
fuel system needs to be specially 
hardened to use it successfully. Sure, 
there were a bunch of M85-capable 
Ô¨Çex-fuel vehicles on the market back 
in the ‚Äô90s, but I doubt many of them 
are still on the road. And I‚Äôm not 
aware of any methanol-blended gaso-
line currently available in the U.S.
So you are probably mistaken: 
Much of the commercially available 
pump gas in the U.S. has ethanol 
blended in as an oxygenate, to lower 
emissions. Regionally and seasonally, 
it can be as much as 10 percent, and 
moÔ¨Ü cars run Ô¨Åne on it.
Consequently, the need for fuel-
line driers like isopropyl alcohol is 
much reduced. Alcohol, whether it‚Äôs 
ethanol, isopropanol or methanol will 
absorb a certain amount of water 
and hold it in solution. A few percent 
of water will then simply be carried 
into the engine, where it Ô¨Çashes into 
Ô¨Üeam harmlessly in the combuÔ¨Üion 
chamber. However, there‚Äôs a point 
where even 10 percent ethanol can‚Äôt 
trap all the water. Add a few drops 
more to a mixture of water, alcohol 
and gasoline that‚Äôs near its satura-
tion point, and a phenomenon called 
phase separation occurs. All of the 
water and alcohol drop out of solu-
tion, leaving a cloudy layer under the 
gasoline. Neither the gasoline nor the 
water‚Äìalcohol mix underneath it will 
burn, so your only recourse is to drain 
the tank and Ô¨Üart over.
Trailing Along
I read your answer in the December 
issue about Ô¨Çasher relays with 
much intereÔ¨Ü. I‚Äôve been able to 
make trailer-light loads a nonissue 
by replacing the trailer‚Äôs tungÔ¨Üen 
Ô¨Ålament bulbs with LED light bulbs. 
e load is so negligible that 
tow-vehicle elerical syÔ¨Üems 
don‚Äôt even know they are there. 
at said, these bulbs are all axial: 
ey shine only Ô¨Üraight out of the 
tip of the bulb. ey work well 
when they point Ô¨Üraight back-
wards, and can hardly be seen at all 
if the bulb is mounted sideways like 
they are in some taillights. As a 
beneÔ¨Åt, the trailer brake lights 
come on a tenth of a second faÔ¨Üer 

I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre sourcing 
your LED bulbs, but I‚Äôve found some 
that have a diÔ¨Äerent light pattern. You 
can get them designed to shine Ô¨Üraight 
back from the socket, or at right angles 
for light fixtures that have vertically 
mounted sockets. ere are even omni-
direional bulbs that work great in trail-
ers or motorcycles that need to be seen 
from the side as well as from behind.
Also, the time diÔ¨Äerence between an 
LED and an incandescent bulb‚Äôs illumi-
nation is more like 400 to 500 millisec-
onds, not just a tenth. Do the math: 
When you slam on your brakes at 60 
mph, that‚Äôs 35 to 44 feet more warning 
for the driver behind you.
Not So FaÔ¨Ü 
Was your advice on recharging a dead 
battery in the December issue 
completely wrong? Aer mulling it 
over for a while, it sure seems so. Let 
me count the ways:
1. A special-purpose charger is 
unnecessary since the alternator‚Äôs 
primary funion is to charge the 
battery. e car runs oÔ¨Ä the battery so 
the alternator is not necessary. I‚Äôve 
driven home without one.
Bosch and ACDelco both suggeÔ¨Ü it‚Äôs 
better to charge a dead battery oÔ¨Ñine. 
e alternator‚Äôs primary funion is not 
to charge the battery, it‚Äôs to provide 
elerical energy to run all of the vehi-
cle‚Äôs syÔ¨Üems. Battery charging occurs 
when there is excess power a	er run-
ning all the accessories.
2. I would never hook up a dead 
battery to a donor car without the 
engine running. You risk having two 
dead batteries. 
e elerical surge when you hook up 
two cars for jump-Ô¨Üarting can damage 
things like Ô¨Üereos and onboard com-
puters. Better to keep both cars shut 
off to isolate the electrical systems, 
then Ô¨Üart the donor car a	er a few min-
utes. It would take hours to deplete the 
donor car‚Äôs battery enough to keep it 
from starting, unless the donor car‚Äôs 
battery is almoÔ¨Ü dead already.
3. I looked at an alternator, and I  
don‚Äôt see where there is room for a 
cooling fan. Why would a spinning 
device need one? And I don‚Äôt see why 
driving at freeway speeds would be 
superior to idling.
than the Ô¨Üandard bulbs. Some of us 
have replaced brake lights with LEDs 
for juÔ¨Ü this reason.
Point well taken about LED trailer 
bulbs‚Äîthese bulbs draw so little cur-
rent compared to conventional incan-
descent bulbs that the Ô¨Çasher doesn‚Äôt 
care, and Ô¨Çash rate is unaÔ¨Äeed inÔ¨Üead 
of looking like a Vegas marquee. When 
you‚Äôre towing a trailer with a bunch of 
diÔ¨Äerent cars or trucks and don‚Äôt want 
to swap out Ô¨Çashers all the time, using 
LED bulbs makes things a lot less com-
plicated. Switching to LEDs is even 
more compelling when you have a vehi-
cle that uses an integrated Ô¨Çasher mod-

Got a car problem?   
Ask Mike about it.  Send your ques-
tions to pmautoclinic@hearst.com or 
to Car Clinic, Popular Mechanics, 300

5899.  While we cannot answer ques-
tions individually, problems of general  
interest will be discussed in  
the column.
e fan is internal, blowing cool air over 
the regulator and diodes. An alternator 
will generate only a small portion of its 
rated output at idle. e regulator and 
diodes aually run much cooler at high 
rpm and high current output (like driving 
at freeway speeds) than at idle rpm and 
low current output (like attempting to 
charge a dead battery by idling a car in 
the driveway).
4. I agree with you Mike, car batteries 
are not designed for deep discharging. 
But a one-time discharge will moÔ¨Ü 
likely have negligible eÔ¨Äe. Aer all, 
there are lead-acid batteries designed 
for deep discharging‚Äîthey simply 
have thicker plates.
It‚Äôs well-documented in the battery 
induÔ¨Üry that even a single inÔ¨Üance of 
deep discharging (below 6 to 7 volts 
open-circuit) will Ô¨Üart the process of 
sulfating, reducing the battery‚Äôs crank-
ing amps, energy-Ô¨Üorage capacity and 
life span. The differences between a 
conventional Ô¨Üarter battery and a deep-
cycle are far more profound than the 
thickness of the plates. e lead alloy is 
diÔ¨Äerent, for one thing. 
Hot Windshield
I have a 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 with 
a 5.9-liter V8. No matter where I put 
the seleor switch to dire heat or 
cool air, it only comes out of the 
defroÔ¨Üer vents. Is this vacuum-driven 
or is there an elerical switch gone 
bad that controls where the air goes?
Your pickup, unlike many vehicles, uses 
elerical auators rather than vacuum 
motors to control the mode doors in 
the HVAC plenum. You may have a prob-
lem as simple as an elerical conneor 
that‚Äôs dislodged or a rod that‚Äôs fallen oÔ¨Ä 
a bellcrank on the mode door. If the reÔ¨Ü 
of the HVAC controls are working, that 
limits your problem to one small area, 
so it should be easy to weasel out.
Struttin‚Äô
I have a 2003 Honda Element and I 
want to replace the rear Ô¨Üruts. e 
lower mounting bolt has ruÔ¨Üed itself 
to the sleeve that goes through the 
rubber bushing. I tried using penetrat-
ing oil, but there‚Äôs no way any type of 
oil is going to soak all the way through 
that whole sleeve. I took the vehicle to 
my local dealer and they couldn‚Äôt get 
the bolt out either. ey said the 
procedure would require cutting out 
the shocks. So my queÔ¨Üion is this, is 
there any reasonable alternative to 
what the dealer is proposing? 
Yeah, that lower bolt on almost any 
shock can be tough. I‚Äôve resorted to 
using everything from a Sawzall to an 
acetylene torch to get these things 
apart. But I‚Äôve never needed to cut the 
mount oÔ¨Ä the control arm. My usual pro-
cedure is to grind oÔ¨Ä the head (assuming 
you‚Äôve got the nut oÔ¨Ä) and the part of 
the bolt Ô¨Üicking out. en, if you bend 
the lower U-shaped mount apart juÔ¨Ü a 
little, you can pry the whole mess out. 
e mount will bend right back when 
you tighten down the new shock.

The completely wireless com-
puter, like the paperless society, is a 
utopian fiction of the technological 
world. Look behind any desk and you‚Äôll 
likely see a rat‚Äôs neÔ¨Ü of power and 
data cables for USB-conneed drives, 
printers, multiple screens, keyboards, 
webcams, mice, digital cameras, cam-
corders, iPods, cellular phones and‚Äî
oh, the irony‚Äîwireless routers. And 
the mess of connections is by no 
means limited to computing devices. 
Audiovisual gear is juÔ¨Ü as bad, if not 
worse. A TV, receiver, disc player, gam-
ing syÔ¨Üem and conÔ¨Üellation of speak-

of wires that juÔ¨Ü determining what is

cause more problems than it solves. 
You‚Äôll juÔ¨Ü be consolidating the tangled 
mess that you already have. Instead, 
Ô¨Üart fresh and unplug everything, then 
group your cables by application (e.g., 
wires that conne your PC and screen). 
If you are setting up your system 
from scratch, think about ordering col-
ored wires from a bulk supplier such as 
monoprice.com. Color-coding wires for 
each component provides quick visual 
reference for your conneions.
Now is also a good time to reorga-
nize your work area. For inÔ¨Üance, if you 
have a few external USB peripherals 
conneed direly to your PC, a pow-
ered USB hub will let you move these 
devices to a less crowded seion of 
desk a foot or two away. en you can 
either tie up the cords for your devices, 
or replace them with shorter ones. And 
if you‚Äôre Ô¨Üill using a corded keyboard 
and mouse, consider ditching them for 
wireless equipment. 
Break Out the Power Ties
 You don‚Äôt need fancy supplies for 
cable management (although, as you‚Äôll 
see, such things can be useful). You 
can tidy things up by simply using twiÔ¨Ü 
ties or zip ties, magic markers and a 
roll of masking tape. 
Separate wires into bundles with 
between three and six cables‚Äîtoo 
many in one group increases the chance 
that you‚Äôll have to cut everything loose 
next time you want to make a change. 
Separate power cables from signal 
cables such as USB and RCA audio. 
MoÔ¨Ü cables are shielded, but it‚Äôs beÔ¨Ü 
not to expose signal cables to excessive 
eleromagnetic interference. 
Start by using the ties to take up any 
slack in the wire length‚Äîbut be sure to 
leave a few inches of play for compo-
nents that need to move around on 
your desk. When using zip or twiÔ¨Ü ties, 
don‚Äôt overtighten, as too much tension 
damages softer cable jackets. Also, 
overtightening twiÔ¨Ü ties can make it 
diÔ¨Écult to cut the cables free later. If 
you can, use the ties to secure wires to 
a leg or the frame of your desk or table; 
letting cables dangle freely puts 
unwanted weight and stress on the 
jacks they plug into. LaÔ¨Üly, use masking 
tape and a marker to label wires (at 
both ends) and power bricks. 
Wrap It Up
 If you are a frequent tinkerer, regu-
lar twiÔ¨Ü and zip ties may be a bit too 
permanent for you, so it might be 
worth a step up to more functional 
cabling solutions. Velcro ties and foam 
twiÔ¨Ü ties allow for some quick-release 
access and are kinder to your cables. 
Wires that you change less frequently 
(such as speaker wire), can be gathered 
together using a mesh sleeving kit  
or split loom (both are also available  
in colors). Got slack le	 over? Wind  
it around a spool-like device known  
as the Cable Turtle, or use a cable- 
organizing enclosure such as the Wire-
Mate (see opposite). 
And if masking-tape labels aren‚Äôt 
pretty enough for you, try pre-printed 
KableÔ¨Çags or color-coded, clip-on Dotz 
Cable IdentiÔ¨Åers (see opposite). 
e Ô¨Ånal opportunity for organiza-
tional elegance comes in your choice of 
power Ô¨Ürip. Pick a model with color-
coded outlets and plenty of space for 
bulky adapters. And get it oÔ¨Ä the ground 
by screwing or zip-tying it to the back of 
your desk or rack.

Modded Machines
A  
Like other video-game consoles, 
Microso	‚Äôs Xbox 360 comes with 
built-in guards that prevent it from play-
ing bootleg copies of games. e moti-
vation for this is obvious‚ÄîMicrosoft 
wants to block pirating‚Äîbut it is 
matched by the desire of some gamers 
to skirt all barriers. Many users have 
taken to modding their machines so 
that they can play bootleg games by sol-
dering in a chip or installing unauthor-
ized firmware‚Äîwarranty-voiding acts 
that may even be illegal under the Digi-
tal Millennium Copyright A.
Well, the empire has struck back. 
Over the paÔ¨Ü few years, Microso	 has 
taken to banning some 
modified machines 
from its Xbox Live 
online multiplayer  
gaming service, citing 
a violation of the con-
sole‚Äôs Terms of Service 
agreement. And in 
November 2009 (a 
date  likely picked to 
coincide with the 
release of mega-selling 
Call of Duty: Modern 
Warfare 2), the company dropped the 
biggest bomb of all, banning a huge 
number of modiÔ¨Åed consoles in one fell 
swoop. Some reports peg the total 
number of newly banned consoles as 
high as a million, although Microso	 
denies that Ô¨Ågure and has not released 
an oÔ¨Écial number (nor will the com-
pany discuss exactly how it detects 
which consoles have been modded). 
And if a console has been banned, it‚Äôs 
banned for good‚Äînot even Ô¨Üripping 
out the mod chip will get it back online. 
is ban is no small deal for Xbox 
360 users. e syÔ¨Üem may lack the 
Wii‚Äôs motion-sensing controller or the 
PlayStation 3‚Äôs ability to play Blu-ray 
movies, but when it comes to online 
multiplayer gaming, it is the undisputed 
leader. In fa, the Xbox Live experience 
is so solid that millions of users willingly

I‚Äôve heard reports that Microso	 has 
banned modded Xbox 360s from its 
Xbox Live online gaming service.  
What‚Äôs the deal with this?

E Ink displays give e-readers epic battery life and are 
easy on the eyes, but they are hampered by slow 
refresh times and currently come only in black-and-
white. at‚Äôs why future devices could feature 
Qualcomm‚Äôs new Mirasol display tech, which matches 
E Ink‚Äôs long battery life and readability with an LCD‚Äôs 
ability to show vibrant color and video. Like E Ink, it

should see it built into e-readers as soon as this year.

MIRASOL

fork over $8 per month (or $50 per 
year) to access the service, despite  
the fa that online gaming is com-
plimentary on the rival Nintendo Wii 
and PS3 consoles. And Xbox Live 
has expanded into more than juÔ¨Ü a 
venue for die-hard Halo and Modern 
Warfare players to duke it out‚Äî
recent updates have given it the 
ability to Ô¨Üream movies from Net-
Ô¨Çix and to access sites such as Twit-
ter and Facebook.
The ban means that anyone 
shopping for a used Xbox 360 faces 
an added measure of risk. Remem-
ber, it‚Äôs the machine that gets 
blocked from Xbox Live, not a user 
or account. Today, there is no way of 
knowing if a second-hand console‚Äî
even one purchased from a legiti-
mate brick-and-mortar retailer such 
as GameStop‚Äîwill be able to 
access Xbox Live. AlmoÔ¨Ü immedi-
ately a	er the lateÔ¨Ü ban was imple-
mented, a torrent of cheap used 
Xbox 360 machines Ô¨Çooded Craigs-
list and eBay, and it‚Äôs likely that 
many of them won‚Äôt be able to go 
online. My advice: Never purchase a 
used Xbox 360 console unless you 
have personally seen it successfully 
log on to Xbox Live. A	er all, even if 
you have no intereÔ¨Ü in online gam-
ing, you may still want to watch 
some NetÔ¨Çix movies.
Sonic Steadiness
When I‚Äôm liÔ¨Üening to music in 
iTunes, some songs will come out 
noticeably louder than others, 
requiring me to conÔ¨Üantly Ô¨Åddle 
with the volume control. Is there 
any way to Ô¨Åx this?
If you‚Äôre anything like me, your digi-
tal music library is full of songs from 
all sorts of different sources. And 
between all these ripped CDs, vari-
ous online music stores and free 
downloads, there‚Äôs really nothing to 
ensure that they all come in at a 
steady volume  level. The result: A 
simple song shuffle can quickly 
transform your quiet evening of 
music into an ear-blaÔ¨Üing race for 
the volume dial.
But there‚Äôs an easy Ô¨Åx (assuming 
the volume diÔ¨Äerence isn‚Äôt too huge). 
Go to your iTunes Preferences menu 

Online backup services have another 
potential problem as well: ere‚Äôs the 
possibility that they will suÔ¨Äer their own 
crashes or data losses‚Äîor simply go 
out of business. And if that happens, 
you‚Äôll deÔ¨Ånitely wish you had a physical 
backup as well.  
So while I encourage you to take 
advantage of online data backup ser-
vices (as long as you are willing to  
pay the $55 to $60 per year that they 
coÔ¨Ü), they should be viewed only as one 
part of your data backup conÔ¨Üellation, 
and not as a replacement for external 
hard drives.  
Padded Content
I heard that the new Apple iPad tablet 
can run regular iPhone apps. Won‚Äôt 
they look really weird on a big screen?
e Apple iPad aually has two diÔ¨Äer-
ent modes that iPhone apps can run in. 
One plays them at their normal size 
within a window, while the other simply 
doubles the number of pixels in order to 
artiÔ¨Åcially force them to Ô¨Åll the iPad‚Äôs 
9.7-inch screen (which is, of course, 
much larger than the iPhone‚Äôs 3.5-inch 
screen). A double-pixeled piure won‚Äôt 
look quite as sharp as an app running in 
a smaller window, but what‚Äôs the point 
of having such a large touchscreen if you 
don‚Äôt use it?   
FC
and sele the Playback tab. From there, 
check the box labeled Sound Check‚Äîit 
will automatically adjuÔ¨Ü the song vol-
umes so they all come out at a relatively 
conÔ¨Üant level. 
Opening Windows
I currently use Apple‚Äôs Boot Camp 
program to run Windows on my 
MacBook, but it requires me to reÔ¨Üart 
my computer to switch between 
operating syÔ¨Üems. Is there a way I 
can run both at the same time?
Apple‚Äôs free Boot Camp program makes 
it easy for users of Intel-based Macs to 
also run Windows on their machines. 
But because Boot Camp requires users 
to reboot the computer in order to 
switch between Windows and Mac OS, 
you will need a third-party program to 
run both at the same time. ere are 
numerous such programs on the mar-
ket, and moÔ¨Ü of them work well enough, 
but I personally like Parallels Desktop 
for its seamless integration of Windows 
and Mac interfaces.
If you‚Äôve already inÔ¨Üalled Windows 
on a Mac using Boot Camp, you won‚Äôt 
need to reinÔ¨Üall it to run other dual-OS 
solutions‚Äîbut getting this set up can 
take a little bit of work. 
ere are basically two approaches: 
One allows you to keep booting through 
Boot Camp. e third-party companies 
behind dual-OS programs supply detailed 
inÔ¨Üruions online for how to do this.
e other option moves the entire 
Windows inÔ¨Üallation away from Boot 
Camp, making it accessible only to the 
new program. To do this, you‚Äôll need to 
download a program called a trans-
porter agent, which is typically oÔ¨Äered 
for free online by the manufaurers of 
dual-OS so	ware. 
Easy Panorama
I love shooting landscapes, but am 
fruÔ¨Ürated by the tedious process 
involved with producing panoramic 
shots. Is there a simpler way of 
shooting these ultrawide photos? 
MoÔ¨Ü cameras produce panoramic pic-
tures by stitching together a series of 
separately shot photos. It works, but it 
takes time, and problems can arise if 
the photos don‚Äôt align perfely. My pre-
ferred method: the unique panoramic 
feature built into some new Sony point-
and-shoots, such as the Cyber-shot 
DSC-HX5V. When you hold the shutter 
button down and sweep the camera 
from side to side or up and down, it 
quickly takes a series of shots using its 
burst mode and automatically fuses 
them together into a panoramic pic-
ture. e camera allows you to capture 
panoramic shots that stretch 270 
degrees‚Äîa range that far exceeds the 
capabilities of moÔ¨Ü cameras.  
Cloud Storage
I‚Äôve read about online data Ô¨Üorage 
services like Mozy. Are these good 
enough to let me ditch my external 
hard drive?
Online data backup and Ô¨Üorage services, 
such as Carbonite and Mozy, have drawn 
a lot of attention lately‚Äîand with good 
reason. For the moÔ¨Ü part, they are very 
good at their primary purpose‚Äîthat is, 
backing up Ô¨Åles on the cloud, so they can 
be accessed from any Internet-enabled 
PC or retrieved in the event your com-
puter goes kaput. But an external hard 
drive is about more than juÔ¨Ü data 
backup‚Äîit‚Äôs about media Ô¨Üorage and 
sharing. And when it comes to this, no 
online service can yet match the plug-
and-play ease of a USB hard drive. ere‚Äôs 
also an issue of speed: Your ability to 
quickly pull a Ô¨Åle oÔ¨Ä the cloud is limited by 
the speed of your Internet conneion‚Äîa 
shortcoming that becomes problematic 
if you are dealing with large movie Ô¨Åles.

ing me down and up my ladder 
over and over. Back on the plat-
form, I‚Äôd reach for my measuring 
tape or pencil and see it lying in 
the grass by my sawhorses. I now 
marched up the 45-degree ladder 
as if up a Ô¨Çight of stairs. Neverthe-
less, I learned to always stow my 
tools in my tool belt and to loop 
the extension cord around a limb.
Things got cramped up there. 
One by one, I nailed the rafters 
atop the stud walls while standing 
inside the 5 x 8‚Äìfoot house, along-
side the mature tree trunk. The 
more rafters I attached, the less 
space I had for swinging my big 
California framing hammer. I felt 
a bit like the storybook Alice after 
she had grown so large her arm 
poked out the cottage window. 
Since the shed roof sloped from 7 
feet down to 5 feet, I kept bumping 
the 6-foot 3-inch high crown of my 
head on the oak rafters. Recoiling 
in pain, I‚Äôd scrape my back or arms 
on the scaly tree bark. 
Once the framing was com-
plete, I drove a borrowed pickup 
truck 30 minutes to Dayton, Va., a 
rural Shenandoah Valley commu-
nity with a large Old Order Menno-
nite population. I passed men in 
straw hats pedaling bicycles and 
driving horse-drawn buggies on 
my way to Martin‚Äôs Native Lumber. 
The warehouse was surrounded by 
what felt like an acre of siding, 
sawn and stacked high overhead, 
open to the sky and surrounded by 
pastureland. Martin‚Äôs had just 
what I was looking for‚Äîmilled 
white-pine barn siding with a 
rough-sawn face. Most of it had 
been sitting in the yard long 
enough to turn a soft gray. When I 
told them I needed something thin 
and light for a treehouse, they 
offered to plane the 3‚ÅÑ4-inch stock 
down to 9‚ÅÑ16 of an inch for a couple 
of pennies more per foot, bringing 
the total price per lineal foot to 50 
cents, one-third the cost of the fan-
cier pine siding from my local lum-
beryard. I ordered the same rustic

pine in a thicker proÔ¨Åle to trim the 
windows, door and corners.
The lap siding went up quickly 
and smoothly. The same was true for 
the roof. I laid cedar shakes over skip 
sheathing‚Äî1 x 4‚Äìinch boards nailed 
5 inches on center across the roof raf-
ters to allow the cedar to breathe. 
Snapping chalk lines, I crabbed 
myself from one side of the roof to 
the other, tacking down the fragrant 
shakes. Having to custom cut each 
shingle to match the contour of the 
curves slowed my progress. But I 
didn‚Äôt mind. That one-of-a-kind look 
is part of a treehouse‚Äôs charm. As 
with the Ô¨Çoor, I left a gap around the 
tree trunk to allow for growth, as well 
as movement in strong winds. 
One afternoon in early August, as 
thunderheads boiled up over the val-
ley, John and I drove to some wooded 
property belonging to his wife‚Äôs fam-
ily. He had a chain saw and loppers. I 
brought along gloves and a curved 
pruning saw. We felled half a dozen 
young red maples, with trunks as big 
around as my forearm. I limbed and 
cut them just as warm, nickel-size 
raindrops began drumming the hood 
of his Ford F-150. Back at the house, I 
cut the poles down to 28 inches and 
nailed them between pairs of 2 x 3s 
to create railing sections. I fastened 
those between 4 x 4‚Äìinch oak corner 
posts for a rustic railing sturdy 
enough to withstand anything my 
kids could dish out. 
By then, much to my delight, 
Luther and Eliot were raring to go‚Äîto 
climb, explore and inadvertently test 
the structural soundness of things the 
way only kids can do. I quickly fash-
ioned a ladder out of wooden dowels 
qq
and nylon rope. To keep the heavy 
hatch from slamming shut on young 
Ô¨Ångers, I strung a counterweight (an 
old railroad hammerhead I found at a 
junk shop) through a small pulley 
above. As the hatch slowly closes, the 
weight rises inside a section of PVC 
pipe. I built a Dutch door and installed 
it between house and porch. Not long 
after I had put my tools away, I found a 
scrawled note on the kitchen counter.
‚ÄúDere Dad,‚Äù it read, ‚ÄúI have gon 
awt to the tree haws, Eliot.‚Äù She and 
her friends Grace and Gillian were 
hauling blankets and books and 
snacks up by rope and bucket. 
‚ÄúI love this transportation!‚Äù Grace 
yelled as she hauled up another load. 
I smiled, realizing this was probably 
the Ô¨Årst treehouse any of them had 
ever seen. A different era. Soon, they 
raised the ladder and battened down 
the hatch, and Luther Ô¨Åred holly ber-
ries at them from below with a home-
made slingshot as shrieks echoed 
through the neighbors‚Äô backyards. 
During the kids‚Äô Ô¨Årst week back in 
school, a late- summer wind blus-
tered up. I raced out back, wobbling 
up the rope ladder and through the 
hatch under the guise of conducting 
a wind-worthiness test. The oak 
framing felt solid underfoot, and I 
smiled, glad to have built with it, 
more glad the construction was done. 
I wedged myself in a corner and rode 
out the gusts. The sky was a crisp 
blue, and sunlight Ô¨Çashed through 
the windows as branches swished 
and whipped. As the timbers creaked, 
I felt both snug and exhilarated to be 
sailing in the wind. For a moment, I 
was untethered, free‚Äîlike a kid in a 
treehouse.

When hot-air-balloon pilot Brooke Owen goes to a party, he can‚Äôt escape work‚Äî
everyone wants to know what a balloon pilot aually does. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an odd job,‚Äù admits 
the 35-year-old, who got his private pilot‚Äôs certiÔ¨Åcation at age 21. In the years since, he‚Äôs 
Ô¨Çown balloons shaped like a tire, the space shuttle and the Canadian maple leaf. Now, he‚Äôs 
a chief pilot for Rainbow Ryders, which carries 11,000 passengers each year 2000 feet 
above the Rio Grande and the Albuquerque area, where they spot mesas, desert foliage 
and coyotes. But what Owen enjoys moÔ¨Ü are the tranquility and unprediability of the 
journey. ‚ÄúWherever the wind blows, that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre going,‚Äù he says.  ‚Äî EMILY HAILE

Owen‚Äôs balloons have up to 
four burners that are capable 
of producing 20 million Btu 
at 100 psi. e burners heat 
the air inside the balloon to 
between 150 and 250 F, giving 
it the li to Ô¨Çy. 
2. q  
ree to four 20-gallon Ô¨Üeel 
propane tanks supply the burn-
ers with fuel. e vapor pres-
sure in the tanks forces the fuel 
through a valve to the burners; 
in cold conditions, Owen adds 
nitrogen to booÔ¨Ü the pressure.

e top of the balloon is made 
of silicone-coated nylon. Closer 
to the burners, it is composed 
of Nomex, a durable heat- and 
Ô¨Çame-resiÔ¨Üant material.  
e envelope holds 120,000 
cubic feet of air, allowing the 
balloon to li approximately 
2100 pounds.

He uses a Garmin GPS unit to 
determine his groundspeed 
and direion of travel.

For landings in high wind, 
Owen uses these lines to open 
a 30-foot-wide valve in the top
