Foreword 
Information technology and communication tools have fundamentally 
changed the way in which humans as well as businesses operate and in-
teract. The caused challenges include automated data processing between 
machines as well as artificial and swarm intelligence being able to draw 
conclusions from a wide range of data. 
The global data flows are exposed to many different legal frameworks of 
sovereign nation states. The lack of legal interoperability leading to a frag-
mentation of the normative environment jeopardizes the success of the 
technologically possible information exchanges. This assessment is partic-
ularly relevant in the field of data protection law. The different levels of 
data privacy rules in the European Union and in the United States of 
America have already provoked many political and legal debates.  
This publication analyses the potential conflicts in the light of their risks to 
enterprises and the way in which US-based cloud providers react to the 
uncertainties of the applicable data protection rules. Furthermore, the 
study provides recommendations on how to navigate the practical chal-
lenges and limitations in this field based on a lack of awareness related to 
the precise consequences of the processing operations within an enterprise 
in view of the given data protection framework. 
The legal considerations are relying on an empirical investigation done 
with US cloud providers. The qualitative interviews conducted during 
July and August 2016 in California were set up in an open format with an 
introductory phase and a subsequent focus an data protection and data 
security issues based on the experience of the interview partner. This (oth-
erwise not chosen) combination of empirical and normative work allows 
the development of new insights into the difficult application of data pri-
vacy laws.

Part 1: Introduction 
A. Trans-Atlantic Privacy Challenges 
Information technology and communication tools have fundamentally 
changed the way in which humans operate and interact over the last dec-
ade. Information that was regarded as private in the past is openly shared 
today on social websites, and the most insignificant things are tweeted to 
the world. In light of these changes, regulators around the world must take 
a step back and assess whether their current legal frameworks with regard 
to data and privacy protection, as well as the rights of individuals, are suit-
able to deal with the new challenges taking shape. These challenges in-
clude automated processing and communication between machines (so-
called IoT devices), as well as artificial and swarm intelligence that is able 
to draw conclusions from a wide range of data touching upon the core of 
human individualism.1  
In particular, the rise of Big Data technologies running on cloud-based sys-
tems has created a significant shift in the ability of technology to under-
mine data protection and the privacy of an individual. Big Data is under-
stood as the processing of large amounts of data which are often 
unstructured.2 Its core ability lies in identifying patters and correlations 
that previously were impossible to identify, for the reasons that the data 
was either unavailable or too costly to process. Today, with the ability to 
use cloud computing and other cost reduction measures, such calculations 
are possible at a fraction of their previous costs.  
The velocity of data growth has made Big Data a necessity in order to deal 
with the sheer volume of the unstructured data created on a daily basis 
and to derive value from it. Unstructured data also allows for a wide range 
of data combinations, thus enabling large corporations to further improve 
their service offerings and efficiency.3 New software technologies are

accurate data but still can be used to refine the results from the huge 
amount of available data.  
Another difference concerns the agreement on how data is analyzed and 
applied. This can occur either with data in rest, meaning already stored, or 
ȃȱȱ¢Ȅȱ ȱit is transferred from the source to the storage medium 
and interpreted during this transfer process in real-time. The power of Big 
Data lies in its ability to split a specific task into smaller tasks that can be 
carried out independently. Results from these smaller tasks are subse-
quently put together in order to reach the final result.  
With regard to data protection, the key question concerns the problem that 
the data which has been processed results in the identifiability of a data 
subject.4 This situation can occur for an individual task or when all the task 
results are compiled together. Sometimes the final conclusion will be too 
general to result in identifiability as it only allows to identify an individual 
in combination with other data. Thus, the circumstances in which data pro-
tection laws will apply can vary significantly depending on the precise na-
ture of the processing operation.  
This publication will introduce the EU and US data protection frameworks 
and current regulatory trends. In doing so, issues that arise out of the con-
flicting views on privacy can be identified. These conflicts are then ana-
lyzed in light of their risks to enterprises and the way in which US-based 
cloud providers react to the uncertainty they create. Furthermore, this 
study will provide recommendations on how to navigate the murky wa-
ters of conflicting practical challenges and limitations. Most of these chal-
lenges are based on a lack of awareness and understanding of the legal 
frameworks of data protection and the precise nature of the processing op-
erations within an enterprise. Thus, one of the first measures that should 
be realized is a basic awareness training that takes into account the indi-
vidual business characteristics. 
In particular, US-based enterprises face a wide array of challenges relating 
to EU data protection laws. These differ depending on the size and type of

the operation. However, compliance with EU laws always increases the 
costs for these enterprises, which is why they need to be closely assessed 
in order to find the most cost-effective solution for the individual business 
operation. This requires a detailed assessment of the personal data pro-
cessing being carried out, as well as the nature of the tasks performed by 
any subcontractors.5 The wide territorial scope of the EU General Data Pro-
tection Regulation mandates US businesses to rethink data protection. Of-
ten the new EU rules will apply to these US businesses because they also 
offer their services to EU customers and collect their data.

tions also increases the complexity of data protection, since the data is of-
ten processed in various locations by several processors.6 Furthermore, all 
mobile applications run on cloud-based systems that communicate a num-
ber of meta- and identifying data in addition to the data processed in order 
to provide the service. This often includes direct personal data. The expan-
sion of cloud technology started to gain momentum in the early 2000s 
when Amazon began to offer the first cloud services as a way of finding 
new uses for its overcapacity outside the requisite peak periods of Christ-
mas and other special holidays. 
B. Characteristics of the Cloud Environment 
Multi-layered environments, such as the cloud, present a unique set of 
challenges from a technical as well as a legal viewpoint. Furthermore, the 
cloud is used for many new technologies, including Big Data or artificial 
intelligence processing.  
I. 
Overview 
Generally the cloud can be grouped into three main service provisioning 
models, which consist of an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as 
ȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮ

On the role of controllers and processors under EU data protection law see e.g. 
Blume, 293 et seq.

Challenges of Trans-border Data Flow in the Cloud, N 1 et seq. 
www.ebook3000.com

B. Characteristics of the Cloud Environment

a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS provides the hard-
ware resources for the processing and storage of the data. PaaS supplies a 
basic software infrastructure on the IaaS, which allows SaaS providers to 
install and run their software solutions. 
These characteristics include:7 
a) On-demand self-service: A consumer can unilaterally provision compu-
ting capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed 
automatically without requiring human interaction with each service 
provider.  
b) Broad network access: Capabilities are available over the network and 
accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heteroge-
neous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, lap-
tops, and workstations).  
c) Resource poolingǱȱ ȱ Ȃȱ ȱ ȱ ȱ ȱ to 
serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different 
physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned 
according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independ-
ence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over 
the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify 
location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or data cen-
ter). Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and 
network bandwidth.  
d) Rapid elasticity: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released 
automatically, to scale rapidly with demand. To the consumer, the ca-
pabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and 
can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.  
e) Measured service: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize re-
source use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstrac-
tion appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, band-
width, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored,

controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider 
and consumer of the utilized service. 
The essential drivers of cloud computing are bandwidth, hardware prices, 
and power supply. Power supply is one of the main factors cloud provid-
ers consider when setting up their cloud infrastructure. This is why many 
cloud server centers are based in the US or other non-EU countries, since 
the EU has one of the highest electricity prices in the world.8 Even in the 
US, electricity prices are a major factor in the decision-making process of 
cloud providers. In some states, prices can differ by over 50%. Cloud pro-
vider pricing reflects these differences as a consequence.9 In Europe, the 
lower electricity prices in the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden are a 
strong factor incentivizing IaaS providers to set up their EU services in 
these countries having also become the locations in which Amazon has set 
up its server centers or is planning to expand its operations.  
For most enterprises, moving data into the cloud presents technical chal-
lenges such as the transfer of data from a mostly proprietary format used 
on internal IT systems to an open format in the cloud. Technical support 
from the cloud provider is essential in enabling a broader acceptance of 
the technology.  
Cloud computing continues to be a diverse business area, as the required 
services of various cloud customers are substantially different from one 
another. For example, the rise of video channels such as YouTube presents 
challenges for cloud systems, which must cope with the huge amount of 
video data that has to be transmitted worldwide. With these develop-
ments, the software underlying the hardware systems is constantly chang-
ing in order to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.10

For example, Amazon´s cloud services are much cheaper in Virgina and Oregon 
than in California. See Amazon Web Services Inc., 'Amazon EC2 Pricing' (2016)

the use of a data centre further away (see e.g. Tim Caulfield).

B. Characteristics of the Cloud Environment

Before assessing legal compliance in any cloud scenario, an in-depth un-
derstanding of cloud services and any ancillary services is essential. As a 
first step, one must determine who is the end user of the service and for 
what purpose the service will ultimately be used. In a multi-layered sce-
nario, such a judgement will be impossible for the IaaS provider to make. 
The SaaS provider is, however, generally in a position to make such dis-
tinctions because it is the last cloud service provider before the service 
reaches the end user. Thus, the burden of compliance on a cloud provider 
should increase the closer the service gets towards the end user and the 
more sophisticated it becomes. 
The risks inherent in cloud computing can be grouped into outsourcing, 
centralization, internationalization, and systemic complexity risks.11 In or-
der to mitigate these risks, targeted solutions both on the regulatory and 
technical side are necessary. The modes of such solutions consist of: 
 direct intervention through regulations, such as the EU General Data 
Protection Regulation; 
 co-regulations, including governmental actors, industry representa-
tives and other stakeholders acting in concert to resolve challenges pre-
sented by new technologies; 
 a self-regulatory approach that enables the industry to set its own 
framework, such as standard contract terms; this approach is informal 
and can adjust very fast to changes in the market; it, however, is also 
subject to stronger market forces. 
All strategies have their own benefits; some excel in market uncertainties, 
while others provide a strong foundation for development.12

Cloud Governance Approaches 
From a governance perspective, the following four characteristics affect 
the regulation of cloud computing:

Cloud Governance Approaches 
 
7 
 Variety in norms: A plurality of state actors, ranging from national gov-
ernment agencies to supranational institutions with formal rule-mak-
ing capacity, have engaged in enacting a diverse set of (partly overlap-
ping or otherwise interacting) norms aimed at regulating certain 
aspects of the cloud computing phenomenon. This has been particu-
larly the case in the US, which lacks uniform laws and competence in 
this regard. 
 Variety in control mechanisms: In addition to traditional, hierarchical 
mechanism of control, legal and regulatory approaches to cloud com-
puting include alternative modes of control, such as market regulation, 
the shaping of social norms, and design requirements. 
 Variety in controllers: While traditional state regulatory bodiesȯsuch as 
government agencies or courtsȯcontinue to play a key role in the con-
text of cloud regulation, important control functions have also been at-
tributed to alternative governance institutions, including standard-set-
ting bodies and trade associations. 
 Variety in controllees: In the cloud computing governance ecosystem, 
businesses that provide cloud services are the key regulatees. However, 
a broader range of actors is also relevant to the outcomes of governance 
efforts, including the government itself, especially where it plays the 
role of a cloud user.13 
Various factors, interests and market forces influence the broader govern-
ance framework of cloud computing. Data protection laws and security 
rules are important aspects of this environment. Broad interest group par-
ticipation plays a relevant role in the developments in these areas. The con-
text in which these laws operate in is also central to their success. For ex-
ample, some areas embrace higher security and data protection standards, 
whereas others are reluctant to adopt these standards and lobby heavily 
against them.  
The regulators have generally two choices when it comes to regulating 
new technologies: either they are able to subsume the technology under

existing laws or they have to create new legislations. The subsumption ap-
proach is difficult to implement because it must be applied to all laws per-
taining to the specific technology, as well as the contracts that are in place.  
Contracts are one of the most innovative tools that can be adjusted to new 
technologies and can then account for new risks and obligations necessary 
in changing contexts. They evolve in line with the demands and develop-
ments of the market.14 Laws, however, are much slower to adjust. This cre-
ates novel cases, particularly in areas involving rights associated with data. 
Examples include copyright laws as well as discovery laws, which have 
determined the boundaries of discovery in the cloud where data is stored 
on various servers and potentially in various jurisdictions. Adaption pro-
cedures on the international level also play an important role, despite not 
being so present in the public eye. 
The US Congress proposed the Cloud Computing Act in 201215 that would 
have addressed a few issues relating to criminal activities in the context of 
cloud computing and the associated damages. For instance, each access to 
a cloud account would have been viewed as a separate offence. Addition-
ally, the minimum compensation for each unauthorized access should be 
500 USD. This was deemed necessary, since the loss is often hard to prove 
when the intended use of the information obtained is not known.16  
This direct intervention into the market by legislators through the law-
making process such as the Cloud Computing Act is generally not consid-
ered to be the most efficient solution. Nevertheless, such an approach is 
required in a limited number of circumstances when incentive-based ap-
proaches would not be successful. This is certainly the case in the area of 
criminal sanctions, penalties and damages. Furthermore, the risk of the 
processing operation must be transferred onto the enterprise that is in con-
trol of the data and not rest with the data subject, who has little or no

power over the actual processing of his or her personal data.17 A positive 
approach would be to influence the market by imposing positive or nega-
tive externalities on certain conducts through, for instance, subsidies or 
taxes.  
III. Political Context of Regulating the Cloud 
In the course of analyzing various forms of regulations and their applica-
bility, the huge influence the political setting has on this development is 
often not sufficiently taken into account. The regulation of such a complex 
area as cloud computing regularly creates tensions resulting in trade-offs 
between different policy objectives. For example, governments seek to en-
sure that consumers can trust any new technology. Otherwise, the service 
will not prevail, and potentially macroeconomic gains cannot be realized. 
At the same time, regulations should ensure that the service offering is safe 
for consumers to use, thus this requires minimum enforcement and control 
mechanisms.18 
The roles of governments are also multifaceted. On the one side, they are 
the regulator of a service. On the other side, they are a user and customer. 
Additionally, various conflicts between competing interests may particu-
larly influence data protection regulations, as governments at the same 
time seek to expand their surveillance capabilities to the cloud. Addition-
ally, the fluidity of technology and the definitions used to qualify it ulti-
mately shape the manner in which it is regulated. Often, legislators refer 
to technical standard-setting bodies when they seek definitions, which 
then grant these organizations some degree of influence over the regula-
tory process.  
Measuring the success of the many regulations and practices applicable to 
the cloud is hard to achieve. This is due to the fact that general agreement 
on the important measuring factors must first be reached, followed by

The users of services and products must be given the tools to firstly under-
stand what processing is carried out and under what circumstances their 
data is at risk. This can be achieved through school education and general 
awareness-raising campaigns with regard to selected issues that pose a 
common threat to individual privacy. In particular, the risk must be high-
lighted that the nudging behavior, which aims at influencing the decision-
making process of individuals without significantly changing their eco-
nomic incentives is not always unfolding.19 This technique can be used to 
increase the privacy of individuals in the context of online media, while 
also encouraging them to reveal more information about themselves and 
their environment.20 The respective tensions need to be taken into account 
in the implementation of technical solutions. 
Behavioral economics has become a core research area and has found its 
first legislative influence in the field of data protection regulation in the 
GDPR of the EU. This new EU data protection law allows for standardized 
icons, which enable users to quickly determine the nature of the processing 
operation and the risk to their personal information.21 Interactions with the 
customer, particularly when data is being generated by devices (IoT data),

will become a core challenge of evolving Big Data and other processing 
operations.  
As a standard, privacy-friendly settings should be the default in any sys-
tem. This is now included in the GDPR as a ȃprivacy by defaultȄ rule.22 
This regulatory action is in line with views expressed by individuals on 
matters relating to the protection of their privacy, namely that they sup-
port measures giving them the choice to select the service that would offer 
them adequate protection.23 In combination with best practices set by the 
industry, such rules can achieve a balanced processing operation, taking 
into account the needs of service providers as well as the right to privacy 
of their customers. 
The research community was one of the first groups to experiment with 
new privacy protections schemes. For example, Harvard ¢Ȃȱ
School of Engineering researched the concept of tagging personal data, 
thus allowing an enterprise to process the data in accordance with data 
protection laws. However, interviews with US-based enterprises have 
shown that the nature of the data is no longer so relevant as companies 
elect to process such data under one universal framework that must then 
meet the data protection standards of the relevant jurisdiction.  
New SaaS applications are emerging which fulfill many of the function re-
quired under the GDPR. These include, for example, a tool which provides 
the procedural compliance manual through a web interface. The company 
compliance officer can log into this system and determine the compliance 
areas he or she wants to address. Afterwards, the selected compliance re-
quirements will be displayed in a workflow, which would allow the user 
to select appropriate internal persons that are able to answer the respective 
compliance questions. This question can be pushed to the person via email. 
The recipient then logs into the system and answers the questions based 
on a scaling of how confident he or she feels that the compliance require-
ment is fulfilled. These answers are thereafter compiled across all business

areas; this process thus enables the compliance officer to have a complete 
overview of the compliance situation in a certain area.  
Based on this information, the compliance officer can then circulate action 
plans to improve compliance in areas identified to be weak based on a pri-
ority list that takes into account human as well as financial resources. Such 
a tool will be the first line of defense once a data protection authority con-
ducts an audit. It will enable the company to prove that it is aware of po-
tential data protection issues and has an action plan or has already taken 
concrete steps to rectify these concerns.  
There are various forms of framing the regulation of digital technology, 
such as cloud computing, Big Data, or the Internet of Things. Previously, 
the regulatory approach has taken the form of constraint on behavior. For 
example, software constraints are viewed as an ex ante constraint of con-
sumer behavior. In contrast, law can act as an enabler of innovation24 if 
contract law does allow the parties of a transaction to set their own require-
ments and obligations according to their needs. On the same level, intel-
lectual and trade protection allow for developments within a basic frame-
work of protection.  
As a third function, the law acts as a leveler between the various market 
forces that create imbalances. This is, for example, the case in the context 
of consumer protection laws. Thus, when enabling technologies, such as 
cloud computing or Big Data, are combined with leveling laws, innovation 
can be fostered and economic progress achieved. At the same time, con-
straints are necessary with regard to privacy protection, such as the provi-
sions on the processing of personal data which have been implemented by 
the GDPR. Ultimately, the interaction of the technology and the various 
forms of law shape the development of a market, such as the EU. In prac-
tice, this three-tiered approach to regulating privacy is most common. This 
is due to the fact that many policy goals try to achieve varying results, and 
the national division of competencies lends itself to a fragmented approach 
to certain issues.

Flexible Laws and Regulations 
 
13 
The US is largely self-regulated with respect to privacy protection. Over 
the last decades, regulatory action has mostly focused on big corporate 
misconduct or misuse of data in which response-specific regulations have 
been enacted for the particular affected sectors (e.g. Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
for financial accounting). Currently, a trend has emerged in the US to re-
quire commercial entities to process personal data in a manner that is rea-
sonable in light of their collection of the said data.25  
II. 
Flexible Laws and Regulations 
The most important driver for a data protecting framework is law. Never-
theless, the foremost problem with a normative order lies in the fact that 
the development of new legal provisions is usually quite slow, whereas 
technological changes happen very fast. Often, law regulates a certain sit-
uation when technology has already introduced new solutions. This regu-
latory time-lag is particularly obvious in the data protection environment.  
Law is usually perceived as a constraint of behavior, but law could also 
enable behavior. In technologically fast-changing environments, emphasis 
should be placed on the enabling function. Therefore, it does not seem to 
be appropriate to only apply old rules to a new problem emerging in the 
context of advanced technologies (subsumption); moreover, it appears 
preferable to ȃȄȱȱal system in view of the new phenomena 
(gradual innovation) or even to design a paradigm change. In other words, 
the legal system should react with the creation of new law.   
Regulating such a volatile concept as digital privacy, however, may prove 
to be an illusion. Technology, as well as changing human behavior, heavily 
weigh on the consideration of privacy. This requires a constant reassess-
ment in light of current market developments. Today, the younger gene- 
ration is viewed as not having an understanding of the basic principles of 
privacy protection.

But the reality is much more refined. Children already learn from an early 
age the effects of using digital media, and they experience these effects 
firsthand. Thus, they are much more aware of the information they make 
available online or through what channels they communicate. Neverthe-
less, laws in the US, as well as in the EU, have recognized the need to pro-
tect children from their actions by requiring the deletion of data that has 
been posted by an underage child upon his or her request.   
Any new regulatory measure must cater to a vast changing digital econ-
omy, and this requires a mechanism that allows for learning and adjust-
ments to new scenarios previously not present. A hybrid approach con-
sisting of industry self-regulation and clear rules within which new 
technologies can develop is necessary. Market-based approaches are seen 
to be the most promising in light of the complexities of privacy protection. 
Nevertheless, regulatory action is also necessary in order to prevent sub-
stantial market failures. These tools should be viewed as complementary 
in achieving an effective framework.  
In order to enable the efficient use of technology to reduce compliance 
costs in both the US and the EU, guidance must be issued by the national 
supervisory authorities in order to allow the legal certainty required for 
the adoption of such tools. On the European level, this can be provided 
through the European Data Protection Board, which is tasked with over-
seeing the harmonious implementation of the GDPR across all EU Member 
States.26 Such an approach requires early interaction with the industry as 
well as with the start-up community in order to enable an efficient and 
focused drafting of guidance that is tailored to the commercial realities and 
reflects the ability of enterprises to innovate. This also incentivizes smaller 
providers to form an interest group, since their influence on the inter- 
national level is relatively small compared to that of large enterprises. For 
example, the German Telekom regularly takes part in data protection  
authority discussions on the EU level.  
Furthermore, it is paramount that the leeway in applying various data pro-
tection and data protection-related laws is exerted with caution in order to 
provide the legal certainty that the market needs to invest resources in the

Overview of Influencing Factors

pillars of a future-oriented framework, namely:27 
 Technology-based models; 
 Market forces; 
 Behavioral factors; 
 Law-based concepts. 
These pillars will be addressed in more detail hereinafter. A combination 
of the four pillars can help to overcome the main challenges that digital 
privacy is exposed to and contribute to a framework that takes the data 
protection interests of individuals adequately into account. 
The subsequent discussion of the privacy/data protection legal environ-
ment in the EU and in the US will be mirrored against these four concepts.

Additionally, these concepts must achieve the following eight core data 
protection principles:28 
 
Thus, when assessing compliance these principles should be reflected in 
the overall goals and procedures of the enterprise. They also form the basis 
of any certification process that a company may want to carry out. 
II. 
Technology-Based Model 
During the last 20 years, technological advances have been very impres-
sive. The networking infrastructure for the transmission of data has be-
come more robust; microprocessors have improved exponentially, even at 
lower costs; storage media are more powerful; networked devices generate 
and capture data through sensors; platforms for home automation are

available; activity trackers enable individuals to monitor their behavior; 
smart vehicle technology is growing; and interoperable platforms inte-
grate manifold devices and data services.29 Due to the far-reaching, fine-
grained information, combined with predictive analytics, the profiling of 
individuals becomes possible. 
The fact that the mentioned technological advances tend to lead to a loss 
of control, as well as to a lack of public trust, however, is counterbalanced 
by the fact that technology is able to contribute to an improvement of data 
protection. For the last forty years, the main measure of protection has 
been the application of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PET). This con-
cept attempts at minimizing the collection and processing of personal data; 
thereby, the functionality of an information system should not be jeopard-
ized.30 The advantages of PET, however, are coming along with certain 
challenges; in particular, the technologically often cumbersome applica-
tion of PET-systems leads to the fact that individuals mostly refrain from 
using PET. 
In the meantime, PET has been further developed as a more general con-
cept encompassing technology aspects of organizational systems. The new 
approach is called privacy by design, embedding the technologies in foun-
dational principles.31 In this way, technical measures protecting the pri-
vacy of individuals are designed in a way that they can play the role of a 
normative code. Notwithstanding the situation that different interpreta-
tions of privacy by design on the implementation level are possible, this 
concept has found its way into legislation.

Data protection objectives can also be realized based on market-oriented 
mechanisms. An important element in the market and between the com-

privacy are not respected, bad publicity will ensue.32 Therefore, data pro-
tection practices acknowledgiȱȂȱȱȱ¢ȱȬ
cies can become a parameter in competition; negative reputational effects 
cause the risk that consumers are diverted to an alternative of a competing 
supplier.33 
In view of this fact, it can be assumed that enterprises are developing new 
business models that improve data protection for consumers and realize 
an appropriate privacy framework. Such business models need to be con-
cretized by self-regulatory measures, such as codes of conduct, guidelines 
of industry associations, and internal data protection management pro-
grams.34 Private regulatory activities are often able to realize a data protec-
tion regime that is oriented towards the fulfillment of practical privacy re-
quirements at reasonable costs. 
IV. Behavioral Factors 
The importance of behavioral factors has increasingly become a research 
topic in the last few years. Indeed, the human elements such as the appre-
ciation of individuals, as well as the demands of civil society, should not 
be underestimated in a technology-oriented world. Consumer demand 
leads to social changes as the use of new digital devices and services has 
dramatically shown, particularly with regard to the younger generation.  
Businesses can integrate behavioral factors into the design of devices and 
services; for example, peer-to-peer transactions and different forms of

settings.36 
However, the acknowledgment of behavioral factors is confronted with 
many complications. Foremost, the problem of incomplete and asymmet-
ric information is already well known and must be taken into account. Fur-
thermore, a privacy paradox exists: even if a large percentage of civil soci-
ety usually declares in surveys not to be willing to share personal data for 
access to free online services, in reality the same individuals behave differ-
ently and share information in an almost unlimited way.37

ondly, international legal instruments (regulations, laws, etc.) encompass 
data protection provisions restricting the processing of personal data.  
The two sources of law do not always fit nicely together. The fundamental 
right of privacy stands in tensions with other fundamental rights, such as 
the freedom of expression or the freedom of information; the specific data 
protection provisions are to be implemented in the given international

and/or constitutional framework and must be brought in line with inter-
national trade rules. The tensions that various frameworks create can be 
exemplified through an analysis of the current developments in the EU 
and the US, which come from hugely different origins.38 
The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and the EU Charter identify 
a fundamental human right to privacy which presents a further frame of 
reference with respect to the limits of data protection infringements. EU 
Member States must adhere to the basic principles of individual privacy 
included in these agreements. However, the boundaries of the general 
principles are not clear, as they are to be determined on a case-by-case ba-
sis, requiring a balancing of the right to privacy against the interests of the 
state. In essence, the GDPR as a secondary law includes practical and tar-
geted rules as to the execution of the primary laws in the European con-
text.39  
The fundamental right to privacy has also gained importance and has been 
the center of attention during the last three years because of a lack of action 
on the part of the data protection authorities. In two landmark decisions, 
the EU Court of Justice has acknowledged a specific right to be forgotten 
(Google/Spain)40 as a new fundamental right and has also invalidated the

22 
This increased importance of the EU fundamental rights approach com-
plements the data protection framework. However, it conflicts with for-
eign laws and regulations and thus will pose a great challenge for busi-
nesses conducting trans-border data transfers. The negotiations on new 
terms succeeding the Safe Harbor Agreement and leading to the new Pri-
vacy Shield highlight the issues arising from both private as well as public 
data access rights in the EU and US.42 In the long run, concepts should be 
explored, creating solutions for how differing data protection laws can in-
teract and grow together. 
The EU has had a leadership role in respect of human rights and privacy 
in the international sphere. Many countries have followed and also imple-
mented data and privacy protection laws mirroring some of the EU provi-
sions. Recently, for example, Indonesia has passed its first data protection

data protection principles, which, for example, require a serious data 
breach to be disclosed to the Office of the Australian Information Commis-
sioner, as well as a notification to the affected individual.43 Despite this 
international progress on data protection, China has passed a new counter 
terrorism law, which requires Internet Service Providers to allow the gov-
ernment access to communications by supplying their encryption keys.

However, the details of the tensions between the free movement of data 
and the protection of personal data are now also slowly being addressed 
by the Commission.45 In January 2017 the EU Commission highlighted the 
effects of the GDPR on the single market as well as the need to push for-
ward with a closer integration in all areas of service delivery across the EU 
Member States.46 In case of personal data, the requirements of the GDPR 
must be fulfilled. More frequently, however, non-personal, machine-gen-
erated data is transferred; in this context, the sharing of data should be 
facilitated and incentivized. 
The DSM Strategy also includes the European Cloud Initiative that encom-
passes topics such as services certification, contracts, switching of provid-
ers and open research facilities; this initiative aims at harmonizing and cre-
ating an EU-wide cloud market.47 These activities show that the free flow 
of data cannot only be perceived as an expression of fundamental rights

fluencing and channeling the information distribution.48 
Transparency is one of the building blocks of such a risk reducing system.49 
While public access rules have been expanded and procedures developed 
for sharing information stored by public agencies, the private sector, which 
impacts private life in a very serious manner through the control of elec-
tronic communication, has largely remained untouched. Furthermore, the 
General Data Protection Regulation will require a minimum mandatory 
disclosure to the data subject if there has been a breach of data security and

transfers should be made public in order to increase competitiveness and 
limit adverse effects.  
Uncertainties surrounding data protection and how it will be applied re-
sult in a failure of trust in Internet-based services on the consumer as well 
as on the business side. A core issue remains the lack of security and com-
pliance and its effects on fundamental rights by potentially allowing third 
parties access to personal or even sensitive data.  
The EU has taken steps to address some of the concerns by implementing 
the Network and Information Security Directive (NIS) in July 2016.51 Op-
erators of critical infrastructures are required to take appropriate action to 
prevent security risks as well as to inform potentially affected parties of 
security breaches.52 As Internet risks spread expediently and affect a wide 
variety of service providers, a timely exchange between private sector ac-
tors and public agencies is necessary in order to identify potential threats 
or risks and to implement appropriate countermeasures.  
The European Cloud Partnership Steering Board (composed of high-level 
representatives of the IT and telecom industry and decision makers from 
governmental IT policy making institutions) highlighted the need for an 
EU-wide cloud procurement strategy by public agencies that will lead to 
common sectorial requirements and thus bolster the EU cloud service pro-
visioning in areas such as eHealth, eGovernment and social care.53 The bar-
rier free transfer of data under such a uniform cloud system will further 
add to the protection of personal data within the EU Digital Single Market.

the EU Data Protection Directive (DPD) 95/46 by the new General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) that will come into force in May 2018.  
The new Regulation contains more than double the amount of provisions 
compared to the Directive. Supposedly, this quantitative increase is due to 
the need for specific protective measures based on the acknowledgement 
that without legislative action, the infringement of personal data is going 
to grow exponentially through new emerging technology, such as Big Data 
or the Internet of Things.54 However, the reality shows that despite the in-
crease in substantive law, over 50 derogations to national laws were in-
cluded, leaving these areas up to individual laws in the EU Member 
States.55 
(2) Based on the changes of the EU data protection framework, the e-Pri-
vacy Directive (EPD)56 that regulates the processing of personal data in the 
communications sector is also undergoing revision. The proposed changes 
that will be newly embedded into a Regulation aim at resolving issues sur-
rounding the scope of the e-Privacy Directive in light of the new market 
and technological reality, enhancing security and confidentiality of com-
munications, as well as addressing inconsistent enforcement and fragmen-
tation at the national level.  
(3) Commercial practice has shown that the use of consent requirements 
under Article 5 of the EPD presents a challenge as most vendors apply a 
take-it-or-leave-it approach, essentially asking the customer to either click 
the appropriate consent button or be blocked from using a site. As this has 
been identified as one of the challenges in maintaining data protection en-
forcement, the GDPR will increase the consent requirements, i.e. the GDPR 
will make it harder for companies to obtain consent for their personal data

which in its practical application has not achieved a balanced result. The 
focus of the revision process, therefore, should be placed on ensuring the 
actual tracking is limited and understandable terms are used when inform-
ing a customer of an underlying processing operation rather than requir-
ing consent. This is because the information provided to an average user 
can by no means be described as informed.  
C. Principles of Data Protection and Privacy in the US 
I. 
Evolution of Data Protection in the US 
With the adoption of the US Constitution, the concept of privacy was fur-
ther expanded from what existed at the time under British law by includ-
ing a constitutional right to protection from unreasonable search and sei-
zure by the government (4th Amendment). In particular, newer case law 
has found a right to privacy in marital relations through the combined 
force of the First, Third, Fourth and Ninth Amendment of the US Consti-
tution.57 In the famous Griswold case, Justice Douglas formed the opinion 
that various constitutional guarantees create zones of privacy and are nec-
essary in order to give the guarantees life and substance. As Justice 
Brandeis later put it in 1928: 
The makers of the constitution sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, 
their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations. They conferred against 
the government, the right to be let alone Ȯ the most comprehensive of rights 
and the right most valued by civilized men.58

Current Data Protection Framework 
 
27 
Thus, the law on privacy has significantly progressed since its first public 
appearance in the famous 1890 Harvard Law Review article of Louis D. 
Brandeis and his fellow Harvard alumni Samuel D. Warren. Both argued 
for the first time in an academic publication that a broader concept of pri-
vacy existed to protect individuals against outrageous and unjustifiable 
infliction of mental distress.59  
Although, at first sight, later cases did not follow this view out of fear of 
the vast amount of litigation and the difficulty in drawing a line between 
public and private figures, it forms a cornerstone to privacy law develop-
ments in the US.60 Today, privacy rights with regard to slander and libel 
are recognized in American state statues as well as in case law. Ten state 
constitutions expressly recognize a right to privacy, whereas this right has 
also been found in states without constitutional privacy protection by way 
of court judgments.61 
Over the last thirty-five years, the USA moved away from the concept of 
property as the basis for the attachment of a privacy right to a more holistic 
and individual focused view.62  
II. 
Current Data Protection Framework 
In the US regulatory supervision of data protection and cybersecurity, is-
sues are governed by states as well as federal agencies. For example, the 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) administers the aspects that relate to in-
terstate trade and commerce as well as any matter concerning the Privacy 
Shield with the EU. The FTC further possesses the power to regulate cy-

ruled. See also Warren and Brandeis, 193 et seq.

FTC Act63 and has expressed its willingness to apply this power more fre-
quently with regard to new technologies. Other regulators such as those in 
the financial sector64 are also stepping up their cybersecurity supervision 
by imposing more frequent audits and conducting regular inspections. 
This trend is expanding from finance into other areas and includes over-
sight bodies from the state and federal levels. Consumer advocacy groups 
also play an important role in this oversight as they regularly bring issues 
to the attention of the public and the courts. 
For companies, US state laws create a great amount of uncertainty and 
compliance costs. For example, data breach notifications vary heavily from 
state to state. Depending in which state an incident has occurred, the re-
quirements to notify various parties differ. For example, California has re-
cently revised its data breach laws, which now require companies with op-
erations in California to consider these new notification requirements, as 
well as their compatibility with the requirements in other states they oper-
ate in.65 The notification requirements must be checked for each state in 
which the company operates, as some states restrict the amount of infor-
mation which can be provided to the data subject.66 
Slowly the scope of privacy regulation is expanding into all sectors. For 
example, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has reclassified 
Internet Service Providers in 2016 so as to allow for their regulation under 
new privacy rules.67 These rules aim at addressing data sharing, data 
breach notification and data protection issues as they pertain to ISP oper-
ations.

The US has seen an increase in class actions for data breaches and a higher 
willingness by affected individuals to claim damages. However, issues re-
main in respect of class certification,68 as most class members usually suffer 
varying types and extents of damages that generally would require a more 
individualized proceeding. Nevertheless, the likelihood of being subjected 
to a class action for a data security breach has significantly grown over the 
last two years. 
Another area impacting EU customers as well as businesses is the issue of 
US discovery rules requiring US-based companies to disclose information 
being governed by EU data protection rules to a US-based counterparty. 
This creates an immensely difficult situation for companies, as they are re-
quired to uphold the laws of both jurisdictions even if they are contrary to 
each other: one requiring disclosure, while the other prohibits it.  
This problem has increased due to the new Cybersecurity Information 
Sharing Act,69 which permits the sharing of information by companies 
with the government undermining the EU Safe Privacy Shield that allows 
personal data transfers from the EU to the US. The Court of Justice of the 
European Union (CJEU) has already highlighted that it will not accept vast 
public access rights to European personal data by US authorities, as it 
would violate EU law and could not be considered to offer an adequate 
protection or sufficient safety.70  
These concerns relating to government access are taken very seriously by 
cloud enterprises.71 On the one side, cloud providers seek expert opinions 
on what their obligations to disclose data are and whether they can object 
ȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮ 
68 
A judge must first certify the class of affected individuals which means that all 
parties that have been damaged are included in this class and they have con-
sented to the class action or elected to opt out.

to a disclosure. On the other side, they demand clearer rules on data dis-
closure by the government.72 The US Patriot Act, the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act, as well as various other federal and state laws, allow gov-
ernment agencies to access data that is being processed on US servers and 
relates to European individuals. As the EU does not have any power over 
such laws, there are only two solutions: either an unrealistic total ban of 
personal data transfers to the US or at least an avoidance of the ability of 
mass surveillance through technical measures, such as encryption.73

strong proponent of abolishing data transfer restrictions. Over the last dec-
ades, it has been largely successful in preventing such restrictions or lim-
iting their effectiveness by offering trade advantages in international treaty 
negotiations in return for reduced transfer restrictions. In particular, how 
data protection measures hinder free flow of data and their conformity 
with the GATS74 has so far not been fully explored.75 However, the prevail-
ing opinȱȱȱȱȂȱȃ¢ȄȱȱȱȱȬ
fully be challenged.76 Until the CJEU recently invalidated the Safe Harbor 
Agreement, even EU law had a workaround that enabled US companies to 
transfer data freely from the EU without any real oversight.77  
D. EU Data Protection Framework 
The EU data protection law developments go back to the post-WWII era, 
characterized by a strong focus on human dignity as part of the German 
Constitution. Based on the fear of a power shift between various govern-
ment branches in Germany, the first data protection laws emerged, such 
as the 1970 Hessian Privacy Protection Act.78

Processing Authorization 
 
31 
In comparison to the more flexible common law concepts, the EU and its 
Member States reinforce traditional notions of consent and notice, which 
have been a requirement of data processing for decades. However, in to-
¢Ȃȱ ȱȱȱȱȱ ȱȱȱȱȱȱȱ, 
these concepts are no longer suited to business operations, thus creating a 
gap between the law and the technology.  
In order to process personal data of EU residents as well as transfer the 
data outside the EU, high data protection requirements apply. For exam-
ple, in order to be able to transfer data outside the EU under the GDPR 
framework, one must first determine an authorization for the initial pro-
cessing and then a justification for the trans-border transfer. 
The following paragraphs will highlight the key provisions of the GDPR 
and the core compliance requirements when processing personal data of 
EU residents. 
I. 
Processing Authorization 
Before turning to the transfer of personal data outside the EU first a pro-
cessing justification must be invokable to use the data. Such a processing 
of personal data under the GDPR is only allowed if either:79 
a) The data is being processed for the performance of a contract; 
b) The data subject has given his or her consent to the processing; 
c) The controller of the data can demonstrate a legitimate interest that is 
not contrary to the fundamental rights of the data subject; 
d) The data is being processed under a public authority or a Member 
State or Union law. 
In light of the complexities of various forms of data processing that can 
ȱȱȱ¢Ȃȱ-layered online environment, appropriate legal 
rules have to be found for each individual processing operation. For US-

D. EU Data Protection Framework 
32 
based enterprises, the processing of personal data of persons in the EU 
must be compliant with these requirements.80  
As the interviews with various cloud and cloud-related businesses have 
shown, often the processor located in the US will be processing the data 
for the performance of a contract of the controller. Thus, the contract 
should include a wide definition of its purpose, so as to allow a wide array 
of processing operations in the performance of the contract. Only when 
this is no longer possible, consent by the data subject will be sought by the 
appropriate clauses in the contract.  
II. 
Processor v. Controller 
The definition of controller is contained in Article 4(7) of the GDPR and 
includes any natural person, legal person or public authority, which (alone 
or jointly) determines the purpose and means of processing of personal 
data. When the processing is determined by EU law, the controller can be 
designated by such law. Thus, to determine whether a party is a controller 
or processor for the purposes of the GDPR a focus is placed on the nature 
of the tasks carried out by the cloud provider and its power to determine 
the means and purpose of such processing.81 
This assessment includes manifold services (IaaS to SaaS) that vary signifi-
cantly in the nature of provider involvement. In addition to the controller 
and processor distinction, another form of provider, namely an intermedi-
ary, should be recognized.82 The Working Paper 196 (WP196) addresses

has already been used, this concept will also be applied to the GDPR. How-
ever, a new element in the controller definition has been added, as the con-
troller must not only determine the means but also the purpose of the pro-
cessing. This raises the bar and reduces the risk of a cloud provider falling 
into the controller definition unexpectedly. 
In a nutshell the legal obligations of the processor can be summarized as 
follows:84 
 Data controllers may only appoint data processors which provide suf-
ficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisa-
tional measures to ensure processing meets the requirements of the 
GDPR. 
 The GDPR gives data controllers a wide degree of control in terms of 
the ability of the processor to sub-contract. In effect, data processors 
require prior written consent. This consent can be general but even 
where general consent has been given, the processor is still required to 
inform the controller of any new sub-processors, giving the controller 
time to object. 
 Data processor activities must be governed by a binding contract with 
regard to the controller. Member State or Union Law can override such 
contracts and provide an independent basis for data processing.

 Processors are under an obligation to maintain a record of all categories 
of processing activities. 
 Processors, like controllers, are required to implement appropriate se-
curity measures. What is appropriate is assessed in terms of a variety 
of factors including the sensitivity of the data, the risks to individuals 
associated with any security breach, the state of the art, the costs of im-
plementation and the nature of the processing. 
 Processors are required to notify their relevant controller of any breach 
without undue delay after becoming aware of it. In order to avoid con-
flict as to what is undue delay the timeframe should be set out in the 
processing contract. 
 Processors are required to appoint a DPO in certain situations, such as 
in case of a public authority or body, and if the data processing activi-
ties require regular monitoring of data subjects on a large scale or if the 
core activities of the processing involve large amounts of special data 
or data relating to criminal convictions and offences. 
 The processor has to exercise a degree of independence from the con-
troller when deciding whether or not it can transfer personal data to a 
third country. While processors are required to follow the relevant data 
controller's instructions with regard to the data processing, they are 
bound by the requirements of the GDPR on trans-border data transfers. 
Thus without a adequacy decision or other exception the processor is 
not allowed to transfer the data broad despite clear instructions by the 
controller. In order to avoid potential conflict the terms of such a trans-
fer should be included in the contract so as to ensure on what transfer 
rule the processor can rely.  
 Approved Codes of Conduct will impose additional obligations on pro-
cessors and as well as allow for them to demonstrate compliance. Thus, 
the contract should highlight which codes of conduct the processor 
should follow in order to avoid potential conflict by using different 
codes of conduct. 

Data Transfers Outside the EU 
 
35 
III. Data Transfers Outside the EU 
Data transfers outside the EU are generally prohibited under the GDPR.85 
However, if a sufficient data protection level is ensured, certain exceptions 
are available. These include first a determination by the EU Commission 
ȱȱȱ¢Ȃȱȱtion law provides sufficient safeguards 
and thus a transfer can be carried out. So far the number of countries out-
side of the EU that have this approval is very limited; the respective list 
includes countries such as Israel and Switzerland but not the United 
States.86  
In addition to this determination, appropriate safeguards such as standard 
contractual clauses provided by the Commission can be used by enter-
prises with their foreign counterparty in order to meet the requirements of 
the EU data protection law. Some US-based SaaS providers and other en-
terprises have opted to give one of their EU subsidiaries the power of at-
torney to enter into these clauses through one general agreement binding 
all EU subsidiaries. However, as this approach only binds the contracting 
party and comes with enforcement issues, the level of protection offered 
by such clauses has come under scrutiny. With regard to the US, a special 
agreement between the EU Commission and the Federal Trade Commis-
sion has been implemented, called the Privacy Shield.87 This agreement al-
lows for data transfers without restrictions to companies that are regis-
tered with the FTC under this scheme. 
The standard contractual clauses currently offer the most efficient and re-
liable way in which corporations can transfer personal data to and from

the US. The argument that has been raised in the literature concerning why 
the standard contractual clauses do not offer the required level of flexibil-
ity does not seem to apply to Human Resource SaaS providers.88  
However, as the data pertains to employees, the union representatives in 
many EU states also try to seek additional assurances as to the safety of the 
data. Often a separate explicit approval is sought from the representatives 
of the employees or the employees directly. Their employment contract 
includes some sort of information and consent for the use of the cloud-
based service.  
Thus, the issue of data protection is often a political one, which means that 
the cloud customer is seeking information and assurances in order to jus-
tify to third parties the processing operation that is not required under any 
law. It then becomes a question of information policy, since most B2B ven-
dors are allowed to process data for a range of purposes that the data sub-
ject ultimately does not know of. The contractual terminology used is often 
very broad and allows for a vast range of processing activities. However, 
this will change with the higher requirements set by the EU General Data 
Protection Regulation.89 
A further alternative is the so-called ȃBinding Corporate RulesǰȄ which en-
sure a high level of data protection throughout the corporate structure of 
companies across various jurisdictions. The downside with this solution is 
the high costs of implementing and maintaining such a framework. How-
ever, it is a good marketing instrument, since it signals to customers that 
the data is secure no matter where it is transferred. Furthermore, security 
aspects are an important factor for top-level executives, as a breach can 
directly affect the further viability of their business operation.90

Information Requirements 
 
37 
IV. Information Requirements 
Under the GDPR, new information requirements have been imposed on 
the controller, in both situations where the personal data is received from 
the individual directly and where the data is acquired from a third party.  
When acquiring personal data from the subject directly, the controller 
must (i) supply its identity and contact information, along with (ii) details 
of the data protection officer or any of the controller´s representative (if 
applicable). Furthermore, (iii) the purposes of the processing, as well as 
(iv) its legal basis must be communicated to the data subject. This can be 
done via standardized icons.91 In the context of the provisioning of cloud 
services: (i) the data subject must be informed about a potential third coun-
try transfer and a reference to the appropriate safeguards as well as (ii) 
about the means to obtain a detailed copy of such transfers. As the US is 
not subject to an adequacy decision, the alternative transfer under the Safe 
Harbor Agreement (or the Privacy Shield in its updated form) must be no-
tified to the data subject. In this context, notice must also be given to the 
data subject of the recipient of personal data.92 
When the data is not obtained from the data subject directly and comes 
from a third-party source, the controller must inform the data subject of 
the aforementioned facts, as well as the recipients or categories of recipi-
ents of the personal data, where applicable.93 Furthermore, it has to pro-
vide information as to the source of the personal data or whether it came 
from a publicly accessible source. To ensure the fair and transparent pro-
cessing of personal data, it must also provide the following information:94 
a) The duration of the storage of the personal data or the criteria for de-
termining such a period; 
b) The legitimate interest for the processing (if applicable);

c) The existence of the right to request from the controller access to and 
rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing 
concerning the data subject; and to object to processing as well as the 
right to data portability; 
d) Where processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of 
Article 9(2), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, 
without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before 
its withdrawal; 
e) The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; 
f) 
From which source the personal data originates and, if applicable, 
whether it came from publicly accessible sources;  
g) The existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, re-
ferred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful 
information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and 
the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. 
Such information shall be provided within a reasonable period after obtai-
ning the data but at latest within one month.95 If the data is used for com-
municating with the data subject, this information must be provided on 
first communication or, in case of disclosure to a recipient, on first disclo-
sure.96 
V. 
Fines and Penalties 
Often the topic of the high fines under the EU General Data Protection 
Regulation is brought up by enterprises and academics when analyzing 
the most important provisions of the GDPR. Although companies fear 
these high fines, they do not perceive them as an immediate threat, as they 
are taking all necessary measures to be compliant with the GDPR and thus

assume that this will shield them from fines relating to the conduct of third 
parties on their systems.97  
The responsibility of ensuring compliance with the obligation of the GDPR 
rests with the management of a company, which must consult with the 
data protection officer on relevant matters.98 Potential criminal liability for 
substantial violations of the data protection laws for commercial purposes 
also create further pressure on the board to ensure a basic level of compli-
ance.  
The GDPR creates two categories of breaches, which differ in the serious-
ness of the breach and the amount of fines that can be imposed. Generally, 
they consist of intentional or reckless non-compliance with the GDPR or 
requirements of the data protection authorities and all other data protec-
tion breaches. The respective maximum fines are 4% of worldwide turno-
ver for the intentional or reckless breach that pose a great threat to the data 
subject and 2% of the worldwide turnover for lesser non-compliance.99 
However, in assessing what fine will be imposed, all relevant factors can 
be taken into account, such as mitigating measures, notice, effect on data 
subjects, and cooperation with the supervisory authorities.

Often, ancient concepts of common law, such as the various categories of 
tortious liability, must be adjusted to new technologies such as Facebook 
or other digital business models.100 The approach to such an application 
varies considerably between courts, for they sometimes are bound by old 
legislation which is not as flexible as the case law but they, nonetheless, 
have to apply to the new technology at hand. This can either be done by 
answering the questions on a very high abstraction level without having 
to deal with the details or determining that the law cannot apply to a given 
circumstance as the technology cannot be addressed by the statute. In these 
cases, the question then becomes whether the court can fill the gap with  
its own common law rules and principles and develop new case law in this 
respect. 
On the federal level, the most important laws relate to the protection of 
health data and financial services. These areas are also the ones in which 
recently more and more class actions have been brought to court. For ex-
ample, in the context of the Fair Credit Reporting Act,101 class actions suits 
have been submitted where a data breach has resulted in a fraud risk that 
needed to be monitored. Often these cases face the challenge of presenting 
damages, as either no damage has yet occurred while the information 
gained by a hacker attack has not yet been made or the connection between 
the hack and damage could not be established.102 Credit cards, other finan-
cial information, and social security numbers are stored in a wide array of 
places, and, thus, the copying of such information could occur in many 
situations that may not be linked to a data breach.  
The federal and state laws discussed hereinafter are the most commonly 
cited statutes that arise in the commercial context and impose significant 
compliance burdens on technological innovative enterprises.

Privacy Act and Wiretap Act 
 
41 
II. 
Privacy Act and Wiretap Act 
1. 
Privacy Act 
Based on the general trend in the 1970s to address issues stemming from 
personal data processing, the first US privacy law, namely the Privacy Act 
of 1974103, was enacted. Its goal was to set a basic framework of personal 
data protection in light of the growing use of computers since the 1960s. A 
second push for new data protection laws was initiated towards the end 
of the 1990s with the wider use of the Internet and database processing 
operations.104 The Privacy Act regulates the disclosure and use of personal 
information by federal agencies. In doing so, the Privacy Act guarantees 
three primary rights:  
1. The right to view records about oneself, subject to Privacy Act exemp-
tions;  
2. The right to request the amendment of records that are not accurate, 
relevant, timely or complete; and  
3. The right of individuals to be protected against unwarranted invasion 
of their privacy resulting from the collection, maintenance, use, and 
disclosure of personal information.  
However, although the Privacy Act is an important law, it only covers a 
small portion of the data processing operations with the bulk being carried 
out in the private sector.  
2. 
Wiretap Act 
The Wiretap Act105 sets out the requirements of tapping certain communi-
cation. It was amended by the Electronic Privacy Act of 1986 with the goal 
to modernize the law in light of new technologies. However, as later cases

have demonstrated, the law is unable to keep up with technological devel-
opments. For example, the case of Joffe v. Google Inc.106 required the judges 
to assess Wifi technology against the old definitions of radio communica-
tion contained in the EPA. Ultimately the court held that Wifi technology 
did not amount to a radio communication.  
III. US Surveillance Framework 
1. 
Patriot Act 
The USA enables access to data through several procedures that vary heav-
ily in terms of their procedures and judicial safeguards, as well as in terms 
of the rights to object to an order. The basis for such measures is found in 
the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Regarding 
measures conducted in the USA, the 4th Amendment to the US Constitu-
tion provides a limited degree of protection against unreasonable interfer-
ence. This protection seems to have been eroded over recent decades. For 
example, decisions such as Smith v Maryland107 enabled the collection of 
phone metadata. An expansive interpretation of the Patriot Act by govern-
ment agencies has also been detrimental to privacy protections. Although 
the then President of the United States has issued a policy order on the 
issue of government surveillance, no legislative instrument has been 
passed to limit the expansive powers of various agencies by narrowing the 
interpretation of key statutory definitions.108 
US surveillance agency were able to access data stored abroad without re-
quiring a warrant or even having to go through the procedure established 
by the Patriot Act109 for access to national data. In these instances, the rights 
of the citizens of the USA, specifically their 4th Amendment right against 
unreasonable search and seizure, are infringed as they are not afforded

protection of any data and communications that are stored or transferred 
abroad. In most parts, the extent of surveillance is unknown.  
Only with Edward Snowden revealing the extent of surveillance has the 
public become aware of these issues. Various members of the executive in 
the US have also raised concerns and spoken before the Senate on the issue. 
In particular, Executive Order 12333, dating back to the Reagan admin-
istration and still in effect today, has been identified as one of the main 
sources for the unfettered access to foreign data by the Executive branch.110 
The rules on foreign surveillance are agreed upon behind closed doors in 
the Executive branch, without even the approval of the secret intelligence 
court which is required in domestic cases.111  
2. 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act 
The Foreign Intelligence and Surveillance Act (FISA)112 was enacted in 1978 
as a response to privacy abuses by government agencies. Although FISA 
was not aimed at allowing domestic surveillance as its main target is for-
eign threats to national security, it has provided much leeway in the past 
for domestic measures. It allows domestic surveillance when it concerns 
the activities of foreign powers on US soil.  
However, the distinction between the sȱȱ ȱȱȂȱ
primary purpose is foreign surveillance and in which it is evidence collec-
tion, subject to domestic court procedures, has been a long-standing is-
sue.113 Foreign surveillance would allow the ancillary use in a legal pro-
ceeding, whereas if the primary purpose was for evidence collection then 
the intercepted communication would be excluded in a criminal court pro-
ceeding. Furthermore, the concept of probable cause was introduced by 
the FISA, which also leaves much leeway in the interpretation of this term.

E. US Data Protection Framework 
44 
Additionally, two new secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courts 
(FISC) were introduced, one at the district level and one at appeals.  
An order by the FISC is required for domestic surveillance conducted for 
the purpose of acquiring foreign intelligence. The definition of foreign 
power importantly includes any group engaged in international terrorism 
or activities in preparation therein. Furthermore, the definition of an agent 
of a foreign power also includes US citizens who knowingly engage in 
clandestine intelligence gathering activities for a foreign power and whose 
activities violate US criminal statutes. This also applies to persons who 
knowingly engage in sabotage or international terrorism or activities in 
preparation of such activities on behalf of a foreign power. Based on these 
wide definitions, terroristic activities will invariably be governed by FISA. 
Therefore, electronic surveillance can be conducted once a court order has 
been sought. 
In 1995, this electronic surveillance power was extended to physical 
searches requiring a showing of probable cause that the target of the search 
is a foreign agent or power. If the probable cause is based on the fact that 
the premises contains foreign intelligence information, it must be owned, 
used, or possessed by a foreign agent or power. Additionally, the president 
has the power to authorize surveillance up to one year without a court or-
der. This requires a certification that the premise to be searched is exclu-
sively controlled by a foreign power, and there is no substantial likelihood 
that the search will involve U.S citizens.  
After 9/11, the Patriot Act aimed at giving the federal agencies the powers 
required to prevent terrorism by enhancing the capacity to share intelli-
gence, removing obstacles to investigating terrorism, updating the law to 
reflect new technology, and strengthening of criminal laws.  
Lowering the requirement from showing that the primary purpose of a 
measure is to obtain foreign intelligence to one of a significant purpose 
also facilitated the approval of surveillance measures by the FISA court. 
Furthermore, in 2002 the line was further blurred when the Office of Intel-
ligence Policy and Review (OIPR) sought to have the protections against 

US Surveillance Framework 
 
45 
information sharing between surveillance agencies and criminal prosecu-
tors, such as the FBI, removed.114 However, this push was only partially 
successful, as the FISA court wanted to prevent these agencies from be-
coming de facto partners in FISA surveillance and searches. Ultimately the 
issue of whether the protection against interaction with criminal prosecu-
tion should be maintained was decided on appeal by the FISA Court of 
Review, which overturned the conservative stance of the FISA Court. It 
highlighted that the Patriot Act sought to enable stronger cooperation be-
tween the various agencies and did not seek to impose the high require-
ment of the primary purpose for an investigation into a foreign intelligence 
claim. 
Since the Patriot Act, the scope of the right to obtain business records from 
a common carrier has also been broadened and includes all tangible things. 
In any case, the Attorney General is still obligated to either approve or 
deny access to the data for the purpose of criminal prosecution. However, 
the applications have never been presented to the defense counsel, as they 
are inspected by the judge ex parte in camera. Further, in those cases in 
which the judge favors the defense, the government has so far always with-
drawn the application. 
In order to rein in the mass collection of data by US surveillance agencies, 
the Freedom Act was adopted. It abolished the phone records collection 
program to a certain extent (although the Government may continue it un-
der different legal means). However, it also distinguishes between 
metadata and the data of the communication, which allows the Govern-
ment to continue to collect the metadata. For a surveillance of the content, 
a FISC order is necessary. In comparison, for metadata the old rule from a 
1978 case115 would apply, which held that this information is voluntarily 
disclosed and thus not subject to protection. This so called third party doc-
trine has since been expanded to many forms of records, such as banking 
records, use of credit cards, surfing habits and information that is shared

with other businesses. In this context, the FBI often uses the National Se-
curity Letters to gather the information without the affected individual 
knowing about it. Thus, a legal challenge to this rule is unlikely to come 
before the Supreme Court anytime soon. 
Based on the lack of control over these measures, privacy advocates en-
courage people to use encryption technology whenever possible. If en-
cryption tools are applied by enough people, this will make the encryption 
of all data impossible for the US surveillance agencies. 
3. 
Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) 
In the period after the US Freedom Act, the surveillance and law enforce-
ment agencies sought to address the regulatory loophole of cybersecurity. 
Thus, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA)116 was introduced 
and passed in December 2015.117 The Act authorizes the sharing of unclas-
sified information among federal agencies, as well as with businesses and 
the public. Classified cyber threat information may be shared outside the 
government only with entities that have appropriate security clearances.  
Privacy concerns arise in particular regarding information sharing provi-
sions which include an immunity clause. The CISA authorizes businesses 
to monitor their information systems and all information stored on, pro-
cessed by, or transiting through the information system, as long as the 
monitoring is for protecting the information or information systems. In do-
ing so they are granted immunity from private or public suits in the per-
formance of their tasks. This sharing includes any cyber threat or related 
information with the Department of Defence including the NSA and the 
Director of National Intelligence.  
ȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮ

The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act was passed as part of the over 2000 
page Consolidated Appropriations Act 2016, H.R. 2029.

A major critic point has been how CISA was passed quietly as part of the Omni-
bus $ 1.1 trillion Spending Bill. See Durden, CISA Is Now The Law: How Con-
gress Quietly Passed The Second Patriot Act, Zero Hedge 2015,

Considering the existing tension with the EU on government access in the 
context of the Safe Harbor agreement, this further expansion of data dis-
closure may present a serious challenge to conformity with EU data pro-
tection laws. For cloud computing providers the new law means that they 
must monitor any threats to their infrastructure very closely and report 
these to the US authorities. However, the risk in the disclosure is not based 
on the information itself, as the immunity would also cover any trade se-
crets, but in a potential loss of consumer confidence in cases where the se-
curity deficits of a cloud provider are brought to light.  
4. 
US Freedom Act 
Based on the outcry of the American and European public against mass 
surveillance, Congress faced pressure to limit the powers contained in the 
Patriot Act. To achieve this goal, the US Freedom Act was passed which 
placed limitations on surveillance and mass data collection. However, the 
bill was strongly watered down from its initial proposal, which had placed

data on the Internet such as social media and other websites will continue. 
Thus, in essence the Patriot Act and the Freedom Act are still very similar, 
as only the way the data is collected and analysed changed, not so much 
their scope. Nevertheless, some positive changes such as an increased 
transparency have been included in the law. These changes require declas-
sification of all significant opinions of the FISA court and provide proce-
dures for questions of law to the FISA Court of Review and the Supreme 
Court.118

many of the old FISA120 provisions still remain in force. For example, the 
requirement to install backdoors into products that US companies offer re-
mains applicable and can be called upon when necessary. Oregon senator 
Ron Wyden, a Democrat on the intelligence committee also expressed his 
scepticism by stating that: 
ȃThis is the only beginning. A lot more will have to be done and a vig-
orous debate about the flawed idea of the FBI director to require com-
panies to build weaknesses into their products is needed. Attempts

because Americans will have their emails swept increasingly up as

In particular, the following changes are noteworthy:122

 FISA creates a new call detail records program that is closely overseen 
by the FISA court. 
 The Act closes a loophole in the current law that requires the govern-
ment to stop tracking foreign terrorists when they enter the USA. This 
provision gives the government 72 hours to track foreign terrorists 
when they initially enter the USA (it does not apply to US citizens) Ȯ 
enough time for the government to obtain the proper authority under 
US law. 
 FISA includes new procedures for the emergency use of Section 215, 
which requires the government to destroy the information it collects if 
a FISA court application is denied. 
The court must now designate at least five individuals who act as amicus 
curiae in FISA proceedings and who can be members of various civil lib-

The use of national security letters has come under strong scrutiny as they are 
provided without a court order and are subject to gag orders that prevent the re-
cipient from speaking about them. This tool has been extensively used in 
2013/2014 against journalists to determine who leaked NSA documents; See

5. 
Use of Metadata 
Currently US surveillance includes the collection of metadata on commu-
nications. Such metadata contains information including the location, date, 
time and duration of a call. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals deter-
mined in May 2015 that this mass surveillance went beyond the scope en-
visioned by the Patriot Act and thus was unlawful.129 However, the ques-
tion arises as to the value of such information. No legitimate arrests or anti-
terror measures have been carried out based on this information. The situ-
ation is rather such that commercial data collectors have more sophisti-
cated and advanced systems of data collection, which allow for much more 
analysis than could ever be done based solely on the metadata. Adding the 
metadata to this mix would potentially increase the accuracy further but, 
considering the available information, it does not seem pertinent to the 
success of US counter terrorism activities. 
However, metadata also presents many opportunities for commercial en-
terprises. For example, the MIT has researched the identifiability of credit 
card metadata in 2015. The researchers studied 3 months of credit card

metadata of 1.1 million people and could prove that four spatiotemporal 
points are enough to reidentify 90 % of individuals.130 These findings are 
central to any argument raised by businesses to anonymize the data to 
share it with other companies. Whether the seemingly existing dichotomy 
of deriving value from anonymized data and effective anonymization can 
be overcome will strongly depend on the development of new technolo-
gies and tools. In particular, the focus of personal data protection and the 
associated definitions should focus more on a quantitative assessment of 
the likelihood of reidentification.131 
6. 
Use of Big Data 
In January 2014, the president initiated a 90-day survey on Big Data to as-
certain the potential effects of this technology and its potential usefulness 
to the government.132 In this survey the authors acknowledge the risk that 
Big Data poses to the individual and the ease with which the government 
can infringe upon personal liberties, either intentionally or otherwise. 
However, they also highlight the immense potential benefit to the govern-
ment for improving the provision of public services, as well as the ease of 
transparency and dissemination of information. In particular, in the areas 
of health and energy vast amounts of data can be pivotal to finding a cure 
for deceases or to saving energy through smarter grids. 
For a US cloud provider offering its services to the US government to carry 
out Big Data calculations, specific indemnities should be sought as it is 
more probable than not that at some point personal data governed by one 
of the specific laws such as the healthcare (HIPAA133) or the financial ser-
vices legislation (Sarbanes Oxley Act134) may affect the processing rights. 
Furthermore, President Barack Obama has made it clear that the govern-
ment will be held to a higher standard for the collection of personal data

ate safeguards whilst advancing the goal of a digital economy which re-
quires a free flow of data. This free flow of data can either be achieved 
through a lack of regulation and limited oversight, or through a system 
which ensures that data protection is minimally invasive to the digital 
economy and functions in an automated and reliable fashion.136 
The open access approach by the Obama administration will inevitably 
raise the issue of whether and to what extent the released data can identify 
an individual. Thus, when entrusted with publishing government data, 
cloud providers should be increasingly familiar and keep up to date with 
the newest de-identification technologies.137 
IV. Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)138 was enacted in 2002 with the goal of ad-
dressing issues that had arisen in the accounting of publicly listed compa-
nies. Sections 302 and 404 relate to the wider field of data protection. Sec-
tion 302 sets out the following compliance requirements: 
 List all deficiencies in internal controls and information, as well as re-
port any fraud involving internal employees; 
 Detail significant changes in internal controls or factors that could have 
a negative impact on internal controls.

Section 404 focuses more on the responsibilities of the management, such 
as: 
 Accountability for establishing and maintaining internal controls and 
procedures that enable accurate financial reporting, and for assessing 
this posture every fiscal year in an internal control report; 
 Attestation by public accounting firms preparing or issuing yearly au-
dits. 
On first sight, these aspects do not fully fit in the scope of data protection. 
However, financial information, which consists of many forms of data in-
cluding personal data, must be kept accurate and up to date, and the re-
sponsibility to ensure this is placed on the management board. Thus, there 
is a certain overlap with what the EU would view as personal data. 
From a data protection compliance view, the established structures for the 
SOX can be used for data protection compliance, since they already estab-
lish communication chains and protocols. This accountability infrastruc-
ture only has to be adjusted for the applicable data protection framework. 
V. 
Selected State Statutes 
Various state laws in the US heavily influence online privacy and con-
sumer protection levels with regard to the use of personal data. For exam-
ple, the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)139 regulates 
the collection of personal information through websites. It requires the dis-
play of a privacy policy that sets out clearly the use of the visitorsȂ or usersȂ 
personal data. Importantly, this law only applies to California residents. 
Hence, website or service operators must ensure that their websites fulfill 
the requirements laid out by CalOPPA when they are used in California. 
Furthermore, Nevada and Minnesota require Internet Service Providers to 
keep certain information concerning their customers private, unless the 
customer gives permission to disclose the information. Both states prohibit

disclosure of personally identifying information, but Minnesota also re-
quires ISPs to get permission from subscribers before disclosing infor-
mation about the subscribers' online surfing habits and Internet sites vis-
ited.140 
In the employment context Delaware law prohibits employers from mon-
itoring or intercepting electronic mail or Internet access or usage of an em-
ployee unless the employer has first given a one-time written or electronic 
notice to the employee.141 The civil penalty for each offence is set at 100 
USD. 
F. International Trade Law and Privacy 
International trade law has grown in importance and, as a consequence, 
also increased its impact on privacy and data protection issues across 
countries. Before turning to the more specific international agreements 
with relevance to the EU and US, the GATS as a multilateral agreement 
governing services must be addressed. 
Since no challenge to an EU Member StateȂs data protection law has yet 
been submitted to the WTO dispute settlement bodies, this analysis is 
mostly hypothetical. At any rate, the WTO panels and Appellate Body only 
apply WTO law and are not bound by other decisions, such as those of the 
CJEU. 
I. 
EU Data Protection Law and GATS

General WTO Law Principles 
The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) forms part of the 
WTO framework that sets out a basic right to equal treatment by the sig-
natory states towards each other. In this context, the assessment of an 
equivalent level of data protection by the EU under Article 25(6) DPD pro-
vides for an argument that WTO members are treated differently. Since

such a complaint has never been brought under WTO law, the jurispru-
dence of the WTO adjudicating bodies, as well as the literature on compa-
rable legal issues, must be carefully analyzed.142 
The US Gambling case made it clear that the GATS applies to the supply 
of electronic services, which is the area most affected by the EU Data Pro-
tection Directive restrictions.143 The WTO/GATS framework implements

EU Data Protection Law and GATS 
 
57 
The transfer of personal data to third countries contains a different treat-
ment according to the data protection level of the country to which the 
data is being transferred. However, the DPD as well as the GDPR do not 
exclusively rely on the origin as the determining factor. Rather, the data 
protection level is at the core of allowing or prohibiting such a transfer. 
Indeed, the Appellate Body has highlighted that it will not take into ac-
count the aims and effects of a measure as no specific authority can be 
found to do so.148 
Certain implementation measures, ȱ ȱ ȱ Ȃȱ ¢ȱ
decision with its differing level, will provide the strongest argument for an 
infringement of the MFN principle. In particular, the Privacy Shield is a 
prominent example of such a sectoral scheme that favors the US. Thus, a 
third country must be given the same sectoral agreement if it can show 
that the same requirements are met as with regard to the US. The GDPR 
will further refine this approach by clearly setting the factors to be taken 
into account in such an assessment.149 
In practice, the DPD rules favor services or suppliers that are based in the 
EU/EEA. Under the GDPR, enterprises that fall under the scope of the 
GDPR may also fall under the third country rules, and this may amount to 
a discrimination, i.e. to a less favorable treatment as the domestic services 
providers. 
2. 
Grounds for Justification of Trade-Restricting Measures 
Apart from the reference to the existence of an economic integration area 
(Art. V GATS) and the right to implement domestic regulation (Art. VI 
GATS) that most likely will not be successful150, the general exception (Art. 
XIV GATS) may be applicable if the EU can show that:

 The GDPR is designed to secure compliance with national laws and 
regulations; 
 National laws and regulations are not inconsistent with the WTO agree-
ment; and 
 The measure at issue is necessary to secure compliance with those na-
tional laws and regulations. 
The burden to prove these elements rests on the EU, which essentially 
amounts ȱȱȃ¢Ȅȱȱrequiring a weighing and balancing of sev-

technical difficulty and costs need to be taken into account when assessing 
whether the other measure would have been reasonable.152  
Furthermore, the chapeau of Article XIV GATS must also be applied,

to ensure consistency of enforcement. Generally, the practice of the WTO 
dispute settlement bodies shows some reluctance in the application of a 
liberally understood chapeau.  
In light of the DPD and later the GDPR, the general exception may be in-
voked because both laws are not in itself inconsistent with the GATS, as

data protection adequacy.153 Rather, the focus is on the fact that the deci-
sion on adequacy is aimed at securing compliance with the principles of 
EU data protection law and is not aimed at discriminating between differ-
ent services and service suppliers. Thus, the necessity test will focus on

whether the law is necessary in order to ensure compliance whilst still be-
ing within the scope of the chapeau.154 
The fact that the Safe Harbor framework is in practice hardly compliant 
with EU data protection law will factor into the balancing exercise under 
the necessity test. It undermines the strength of the EU data protection law 
and, thus, the argument that the measure is necessary in order to ensure 
compliance with the principles of EU data protection law. This is particu-
larly important in light of the CJEU invalidation of the Safe Harbor Agree-
ment and the current challenge to the Privacy Shield Agreement.  
Another key issue in this assessment is the fact that the EU data protection 
law has the most specific protections, meaning that the complaining Mem-
ber could show that there are other less restrictive measures available

sistent application of third country transfer provisions may violate the cha-
peau, for example, when a third country is denied the same framework as 
is present under the Privacy Shield. Additionally, a third countr¢Ȃ na-
tional security measures impact the adequacy assessment, whereas in the 
EU this is not the case even though some EU Member States have similar 
surveillance powers. 
In a worst case scenario, the WTO could find the third country data trans-
fer provisions to be inconsistent with GATS and, thus, requiring the EU to 
modify these provisions accordingly. However, the DPD or GDPR will still

Privacy-Related Plurilateral and Regional Trade  
Agreements 
Some countries are privacy sensitive, as their services sector is heavily af-
fected by other countries´ privacy standards. For example, when the data 
protection in a sector, such as health care, is much higher than the standard 
included in another country´s law, the service providers will have trouble

entering this market as they do not comply with the minimum require-
ments to process health data or even transfer it abroad. Market access re-
quires them to take additional measures to meet the standards of the target 
market, often incurring significant costs in the process.  
Free trade agreements go beyond the basic trade liberalization that is con-
tained in the GATT or GATS with regard to specific areas. Privacy protec-
tion is a particularly important theme for the EU since the Snowden reve-
lations. This has been evidenced by the public outcry to the TTIP 
documents, which showed that the EU was not taking appropriate action 
to ensure the implementation of data protection safeguards. These factors 
ultimately resulted in a shift of positions towards broader public inclusion. 
The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and the 
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) both contain e-
commerce as a new discipline in which market liberalization is to be en-
hanced. Future trade agreements also incorporate a direct recognition of 
privacy and data protection as an important public policy objective and a 
necessary condition for spurring international trade.155 For example, under

step towards harmonizing privacy and data protection regulations via in-
ternational trade law. However, they are a recognition of the rising rele-
vance of their protection for international trade in services.159 
Outside of Europe, the new Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement is 
a recent example of the US position on data flow as it contains a wide scope 
in relation to electronic services. Furthermore, exceptions limiting the ex-
port of personal data must be justified under Article 14.11.3 by fulfilling 
four requirements. These requirements include: (i) a legitimate public pol-
icy objective; (ii) no arbitrary or unjustified discrimination; (iii) no dis-
guised restriction on trade; and (iv) no greater restrictions than necessary 
to achieve the objective of the law.160 In contrast to other international trea-
ties, this Agreement would place the onus to prove the elements on the 
state implementing the law. Based on the unpredictability of the interpre-
tation of these requirements, it is unlikely that an exception would ever be 
granted. Thus, international law-making efforts can have severe repercus-
sions for local data protection laws and must be considered carefully, i.e. 
often fundamental rights are (partly) bargained away for the promise of 
economic benefit. However, the current trend under the new administra-
tion is going away from such international agreements as evidenced by its 
withdrawal from the TPP. It is then likely that no new multilateral agree-
ments will be passed touching upon the issues of data flows.

Part 3: Practical Implementation of Data Protec-
tion Environment 
A. Industry Feedback on Data Protection and Security 
Challenges 
I. 
Interview Set-up 
A wide range of cloud related professionals (both legal and technical) in 
California have been interviewed regarding their experience with data 
protection and in particular the effects of the EU law on their business op-
erations and the industry in general. Hereinafter, the results of these inter-
views will be analyzed and key issues addressed with a special focus on 
the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  
As the challenges differ for various actors, the unique data protection 
problems start-up enterprises face are highlighted at the beginning. Sub-
sequently, larger B2B contracting which makes up a substantial part of the 
cloud market share is addressed. Lastly, a focus is placed on the B2C side 
with offerings directed at EU consumers. Based on this analysis key points 
are identified which warrant further research. 
The conducted interviews address the general perception of data protec-
tion in the context of cloud offerings, such as the weight attached to data 
protection and security, measures taken to mitigate risk, awareness of the 
EU data protection law and customer demand. As litigation and class ac-
tions are an important topic in US law, these factors have also been briefly 
discussed in the context of risk shifting in contract negotiations.  
Generally, US-based cloud enterprises comprising many SaaS (Software as 
a Service) solution providers are aware of the high standards the EU data 
protection law sets. A majority of providers have opted to implement con-
tractual tools, such as the EU standard contractual clauses into their frame-
works. These often larger providers have a certain degree of sophistication 
and thus are able implement measures to satisfy their ongoing compliance 
obligations. Furthermore, data protection is also viewed more as a data

security issue that requires the implementation of security mechanisms, 
including technical and procedural safeguards. All interviewed providers 
had security measures in place that varied according to the nature of their 
data. Nevertheless, they all are aware of the risks that data security 
breaches can cause. 
As the main offering of a SaaS provider is its software, this introduces 
many unknown risks relating to compatibility, updates and other security 
aspects that may materialize at a later point. These risks are a major con-
cern for all of these providers, which they try to mitigate as much as pos-
sible. However, a 100% failsafe software is an illusion. Rather, an approach 
is chosen by start-ups in which a service is launched and then adjusted 
once the customer has conducted an initial assessment of its functionality 
and risks. In this context, the underlying infrastructure has so far been ex-
clusively provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the market leader 
in cloud IaaS through one of its many server centers around the world. 
This ensures that the underlying technical measures to maintain security 
of the service are up to the highest standard, including all necessary certi-
fications that are required for these server centers.  
Thus, the risks of the software are based in its programming and provi-
sioning. All cloud businesses that offer a B2B service have highlighted that 
the data they process is so sensitive that they elect to only process it in a 
private cloud. Where the data is less sensitive, they would be more willing 
to use a hybrid cloud but would seek additional assurances and technical 
safeguards. As hacking of virtual processes has proven to be possible, the 
hybrid cloud option does not seem to be a sensible choice without further 
technological safeguards. 
II. 
Cloud Trends and Challenges 
Cloud-based systems have undergone a strong development since the 
early 2000s. Many cloud providers have emerged that provide the basic 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) on which numerous cloud service provid-
ers have built their business operation. This IaaS market is dominated by 
Amazon Web Service, Microsoft Azure, and Rackspace. They each provide 
a service for a particular cloud business. For example, Rackspace is viewed

as the cloud provider of choice for certain processing operations that re-
quire sophisticated hardware, whereas AWS and Azure offer a more 
standardized and easy to implement cloud environment.  
As companies seek efficiency gains through technology, they also want to 
reduce their operating costs. In order to achieve this goal, flexibility in the 
service provisioning is required as the cloud is a highly complex construct 
that incorporates a highly volatile price structure that needs to be adjusted 
to customer demand.  
1. 
Introduction to Cloud Services 
The cloud industry landscape is highly diverse. It consists of Infrastructure 
as a Service (IaaS) providers, which provide the hardware resources for 
other cloud services, and Software as a Service (SaaS) providers that offer 
their innovative software solutions running on an IaaS cloud. Addition-
ally, constantly new forms of cloud services are being developed. Some of 
these act as intermediary tools which provide a platform based on a IaaS 
cloud for enterprises that do not have the knowledge or do not want to 
expend the resources required to implement a complete environment for 
the software in order for it to run on a IaaS. Thus, these Platform as a Ser-
vice (PaaS) providers bridge this gap by offering a basic software platform 
on which the SaaS provider can simply install its service without having 
to be concerned with managing the underlying IaaS cloud.  
2. 
Costs in the Cloud 
Over the last years, the trend in the cloud market has shifted to more inte-
grated services that offer a full range of tools extending to all aspects of a 
business operation. Furthermore, server centers of the main cloud IaaS 
providers are now established in every region, including special offerings 
for the EU. Previously existing price differences between regional offerings 
no longer play a significant role today, since most large IaaS customers use 
cloud enterprise agreements that calculate costs based on the use of a ser-
vice regardless of location of the service provided.161  
ȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮ 
161 
Interview 3. 

Cloud Trends and Challenges 
 
65 
For smaller customers, the regional offerings are, however, still more ex-
pensive, as the cost to maintain a server center in the EU is higher. The 
price difference between North Virginia and Ireland is around 5-10% for 
small amounts of usage.162 If the data is being processed on the US West 
Coast, then the price is even higher than in Ireland. This just exemplifies 
how close the pricing has become and the options that a customer has 
when deciding where the data should be processed. In particular, when 
the service provisioning does not depend on the fastest possible availabil-
ity, then a location that is cheapest for providing the service can be chosen. 
3. 
Latency in the Cloud 
Latency times are, of course, also a factor in this equation. Latency is the 
time that is required for the data to be processed and returned to the 
sender. The ease of shifting data within the cloud across regions enables 
SaaS providers to improve user experience by storing the data in the region 
the user is currently in and, thus, enabling faster access to the data. This 
ȱȱȱȃȄǯȱ 
However, in doing so, this data may become subject to the EU data protec-
tion law and require authorization for transferring it outside the EU again 
once the individual customer returns to his or her home country outside 
the EU.163  
Furthermore, latency is integral to new services, such as autonomous driv-
ing and other tools that require real-time communication in order to func-
tion properly. In these cases, the servers must be located in the region in 
which the service is offered. Otherwise the latency times would be too 
long. Thus, data protection laws restricting such a free flow of data across 
borders will impose significant obstacles to new technologies, such as au-
tonomous devices, Big Data and the Internet of Things.

4. 
Identifying Personal Data 
Some cloud vendors face the problem of identifying personal data and the 
location of that data at a given point in time. Essentially, these enterprises 
only rely on the login credentials of their customers to determine who the 
individual user is and thus which law applies. However, IP addresses are 
not a good predictor of location, since they can be altered through the use 
of VPN tunnels that are becoming more and more mainstream in order to 
gain access to media content that otherwise would be blocked from access 
in a certain region.164 In particular for smaller SaaS providers, these identi-
fication requirements are hard to achieve because they come at great costs.  
However, new technologies are currently being implemented using artifi-
cial intelligence in order to determine whether data that is being transmit-
ted through a router meets the definition of identifiability contained in the 
GDPR. If the data does allow the identification of an individual, then the 
technology automatically replaces the identifying factor from the data be-
fore it enters the server. The replacement variable is then stored separately 
from the data in a secure server to which the processor of the data does not 
have access. Although this provides a complete protection from the EU 
data protection law, it remains to be seen whether the data is still of value 
and whether the re-identification is still possible after conducting pro-
cessing operations on the data. 
5. 
Security Risks 
Cloud security has grown to be a central topic in determining the future of 
this technology. The risk mainly lies in the hijacking of a user account as it 
allows a party access to nearly all systems. Two factor authentication is 
now the common norm in the cloud environment as it ensures that the 
person is identified not only by the device he or she is using but also by a 
unique token (key).165  
From a security viewpoint, most cloud service providers are taking many 
measures in order to ensure the integrity and resilience of their systems.

Unique Challenges of Start-Ups 
 
67 
Already the large IaaS providers supply the tools and technology to ensure 
a very high level of protection, as they and their customers monitor access 
in order to identify DoS attacks and other treats to their cloud environ-
ment. Furthermore, sophisticated software monitors and limits the actions 
of the cloud customer to ensure that they do not affect the core function of 
the infrastructure in any way.  
III. Unique Challenges of Start-Ups  
Start-ups naturally face many challenges during their first years. These in-
clude financial, organizational as well as regulatory factors that constantly 
pose a threat to the future of the enterprise and must be addressed accord-
ingly.  
1. 
Key Challenge for Start-Ups 
Currently, there is a strong trend in the US business sector to engage cloud 
(start-up) ventures that offer a wide range of ancillary business services in 
the cloud. These services range from entertainment platforms and sched-
uling tools to sophisticated document review systems. However, many of 
these enterprises lack resources (financial and human), and this is why 
they are required to focus their efforts on specific tasks that can be 
achieved with the resources at hand and that are vital to the further sus-
tainability of the enterprise.  
Based on these constraints, data protection is not a predominant issue alt-
hough it is factored into the general security of the service offering. A first 
concern is having a minimal viable service that can be sold to customers 
and generates revenue to sustain further growth and attract investment. 
Additionally, any growth will require the retention of skilled labor. As 
long as the start-up is not processing any special data that is governed by 
specific laws such as financial or health data, any data protection and pri-
vacy measures will not be on the priorities list. 
Most ventures use Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure as their basic 
cloud platform for the supply of their cloud services. In doing so, a mini-
mum standard of data security is already created, as these providers have

A. Industry Feedback on Data Protection and Security Challenges 
68 
implemented sophisticated systems to ensure the security and integrity of 
their server centers that directly benefit their customers. These services al-
low young enterprises to primarily focus on the development of their soft-
ware and the acquisition of customers.  
However, as the interviews with start-ups and consulting firm members 
have demonstrated, some enterprises, in particular business enterprises, 
seek to ensure that the service provided meets certain criteria. Most of 
these criteria can already be satisfied through the IaaS vendors. However, 
in some cases, further safeguards are required. These can either take the 
form of contractual or technical safeguards that then act as a driver for bet-
ter data protection.  
2. 
Entering the EU Market 
Once a US-based SaaS start-up decides to enter the EU market, data segre-
gation becomes an important factor in order to keep EU and other data 
separate for compliance purposes. For cloud start-ups, the environment 
provided by a large corporation such as AWS is essential because it pro-
vides a secure base infrastructure on which the start-up can develop its 
offering and potentially scale its business with limited costs. 166 
Selecting the appropriate cloud provider does not seem to be a major chal-
lenge, as Amazon dominates the market followed by Microsoft. Rackspace 
appears to be the provider of choice when it comes to private cloud ar-
rangements.167 With regard to privacy, their services offering and systems 
are substantially similar. Furthermore, they all use an enterprise agree-
ment which charges the customer based on usage. In particular, AWS and 
Microsoft have regional (generally 4-5; e.g. US/EU/Asia) offerings. Thus, 
data transfers can be restricted to the data centers in one of these regions.

Processing of Sector-Specific Health Data 
 
69 
IV. Processing of Sector-Specific Health Data 
Health data is a very special category of data that is subject to many pro-
tection regulations. Firstly, it is protected as personal data by data protec-
tion law as such and the GDPR that imposes a higher standard on it as 
sensitive data. Additionally, health care laws limit the ability to process 
such data according to EU Member StateȂ law, as well as HIPAA. Further-
more, often credit card or financial information is stolen in the context of a 
security breach, and any potential damage that may result is unknown. 
This is why courts are reluctant to grant any form of compensation going 
beyond a credit monitoring service where there has been no immediate 
damage to the afȱȂȱcredit history or fraud. 
Thus, the first step for any cloud professional is to understand how the 
pre-existing laws may apply to the cloud business model. This includes a 
target approach to the required level of security, which often differs be-
tween compliance professional and information technology security ex-
perts.  
Various laws affect cloud and other service providersȂ obligations to im-
plement security measures.168 However, most of these laws relate to spe-
cific types of data such as financial or health data and are governed by 
separate laws. In the financial sector, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) 
is one of the most important financial regulations covering also the topic 
of information privacy. This includes an obligation to oversee service pro-
viders that regularly include cloud providers. Thus, when selecting a 
cloud or other service provider, the financial market enterprise must en-
sure that the provider can demonstrate appropriate safeguards, including 
contractual rights and duties. However, only reasonable steps must be 
taken to ensure service provider security.169 What is reasonable will largely 
depend on the given circumstances. Nevertheless, clarification taking into 
account the ability to monitor or influence the cloud provider should be 
ȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮ 
168 
Such as financial market regulatiom, consumer protection, data protection and 
communication law.

provided in order to realize the needed market certainty for the wider use 
of such technology. 
Similar risks exist in the content of health data being processed or stored 
in the cloud. US-based enterprises must comply with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act and its subsequent modification by the 
Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health 
(HITECH) Act.170 These laws, similarly to the financial regulation, require 
enterprises to take steps in order to meet the requirements of the law. In 
this context, again the reasonableness of the measures and their appropri-
ateness to protect the health information will be assessed in case of an au-
dit. However, they also include some specific measures, such as regular 
risk analysis, the assigning of unique user names, as well as the action 
taken in response to incidents or threats. 171 Of particular importance is the 
fact that the enterprises transferring data into the cloud will remain liable 
for non-compliance of their service provider. 
Compliance with HIPAA is very costly, which is why Microsoft and other 
cloud providers include specific services and contracts for the provision-
ing of compliant cloud services. For example, Microsoft HealthVault re-
quires the signing of a business associate agreement aiming at ensuring 
that the data will only be used or disclosed in accordance with HIPAA. In 
any case, known breaches must be addressed immediately no matter

In light of the already existing complexity of various new technologies, 
these laws should be amended to ensure clearer rules are used which ena-
ble service providers to understand what their obligations are and how 
they can be met. However, as this process is very slow and inflexible, the

innovative industries have started to implement their own codes of con-
duct that act as a self-regulatory mechanism, which aims at ensuring that 
the government cannot interpret a certain statute differently when all of 
the industry applies it to a new technology in a certain manner.172  
Informing customers and the persons whose data is being processed of 
their rights and obligations after the contract is terminated is also central 
in order to providing the transparency that legislators seek to achieve. 
With this information, service providers could also better assess their com-
pliance situation and design a path to achieving the goals of the law.

Current Developments 
1. 
New Technology 
Cloud applications are extensively used in the Business to Business (B2B) 
context. A vast amount of new services providers have emerged over the 
last five years, which aim at improving the efficiency of business opera-
tions. Generally, the contracting parties in this scenario have a high exper-
tise with regard to the cloud offering and its requirements. They are able 
to understand the international data flows through the cloud services and 
the possibilities available to mitigate risks that both affect legal compliance 
as well as the security and integrity of the system.173  
In the B2B context, the SaaS provider will often reach an agreement with 
the IaaS provider containing a clause allowing it to shift the data between 
server centers of a particular region. This includes a decoupling of the in-
frastructure and a mapping across all contractually agreed jurisdictions.174  
ȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮ

curity in the context of cloud computing see <https://www.pcise-

B. Business to Business in the Cloud 
72 
Furthermore, most enterprises elect to use a private cloud offering as the 
hybrid alternatives still carry a significant risk. The tools offered through 
hybrid clouds are highly effective, for example, in order to manage a pro-
ject. However, the risk lies in the combination of these tools with other 
software, such as an internal communication tool (e.g. Slack) that increases 
the risk of unwanted disclosure of personal or confidential data. These 
tools can be used to breach an otherwise secure system.175 
Although all actors in the SaaS context wish to ensure security, the dichot-
omy of ease of access and security is still hard to bridge. Thus, innovative 
tools often cannot be recommended based on their perceived risk to the 
existing infrastructure and the business operation.  
2. 
Contractual Innovation 
Managing the level of trust between sub-processors is a key topic in deal-
ing with various cloud vendors. This includes regular audits of the busi-
ness partnersȂȱoperations and a contractual requirement that they do the 
same with their respective vendors.176  
One of the trends in relation to data protection has been the use of more 
explicit data security terms in contracts. These include detailed descrip-
tions of security requirements in the form of lists, as well as classifications 
and definitions of data breach scenarios. Such clear terms are necessary as 
the nature of data breaches can be highly complex and involve a number 
of actors. In contrast to the EU, the US system of risk allocation relies more 
on commercial practice than on law.  
However, although many customers seek to get a carve out for data secu-
rity breaches, smaller SaaS providers are not willing or able to take on this 
risk. Thus, innovative approaches are used to get around the limited lia-
bility for data security breaches. These approaches try to introduce essen-
tially the same liability as for data security breaches by claiming a breach 
ȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮ

of confidence based on the disclosure of confidential information to an un-
known third party.177 In most cases, the breach of confidence provisions do 
not contain a liability cap that allows for the introduction of unlimited data 
breach liability through this back door. The only way to counter this situ-
ation is to have a large Annex, which sets out the requirements in order to 
trigger either the data breach or confidentiality provision. Once these have 
been set out, the parties can then agree on a liability cap.  
3. 
Challenges for Cloud Vendors 
Cloud vendors as well as business customers regularly require outside 
specialists who can ensure that their infrastructure and software is secure 
against any external and internal threats. Some of the most important se-
curity trends over the last decade include a growing use of encryption as 
well as the ȃshardingȄ of data across jurisdictions in order to limit the risks 
of potential data loss. Furthermore, government access and the ability to 
track individuals (so called shadows) across the Internet have changed sig-
nificantly.178  
Since Edward SnowdenȂȱǰ enterprises in the online world are 
increasing their data protection through encryption as well as pushing 
back on data request by government agencies. On the user side, technolo-
gies such as Virtual Private Networks (VPN) with cascading functions al-
low a user to obscure his or her location and encrypt any communication.  
All these measures have resulted in overall higher protection of data on 
the Internet than what has been the case in the last 10 years. The awareness 
of the risks of communicating data in an unencrypted fashion has risen 
leading to a higher demand for secure services in all areas of online service.

care and financial services law affect smaller companies. This is where the 
cloud can provide the highest benefit. Cloud-based start-ups now address 
the varying environment and security aspects that must be in line with the 
legal requirements. For example, a mobile device, a cloud server and a lap-
top operate in differing environments.  
Vault is a software that provides one environment for all these platforms 
and allows for secure testing and easier compliance with HIPAA and other 
laws.  
5. 
Transatlantic Cloud Data Centers  
Data centers are subject to three main considerations, including costs of 
running the center, latency times as well as local laws. In the EU, cloud 
providers often opt for Amsterdam as one of the server locations as its laws 
favor cloud computing and its connection speeds are ideal. This also ap-
plies to Switzerland with its good communication infrastructure. How-
ever, costs are higher in Switzerland than in most EU countries. Further-
more, by processing data only in the EU, the redundancy as well as the 
availability would be limited and increased latency is also expected when 
the data is accessed outside the EU. Most US-based vendors now opt to 
categorize their data into non-EU and EU data as currently the EU data 
protection law carries the most restrictions. 
Data center providers have even gone so far as to test underwater data 
centers that would require less power because the seawater takes over 
much of the cooling. These centers can theoretically be placed near any 
coastline, thus raising jurisdictional questions. Based on these technologi-
cal developments, the data protection laws are slowly expanding their ex-
traterritorial reach, starting with the GDPR which subject any enterprise 
that offers good or services to natural persons in the EU to its high data 
protection standard. 
II. 
Ancillary Business Services 
Most US-based companies have adopted a strategy of focusing on their 
core business and obtaining all ancillary tools and services from third

party vendors. This enables them to focus on their own product or service. 
Often other providers will already be able to supply a software module, 
which would otherwise cost a fortune to develop. An example of this is a 
translation tool required for many SaaS applications.179

SaaS Human Resource Tools 
ȱȱ¢Ȃȱȱȱȱȱȱȱȱ
the expectations of employees have grown. In order to ensure a high em-
ployee retention rate, companies must use the most up-to-data human re-
source software. This includes human resource cloud tools such as the Cor-
nerstone offering, which enables all steps from selecting a candidate, 
onboarding as well as compensation management to be carried out in the 
cloud. With these systems, a considerable amount of personal data is being 
processed, including financial, racial as well as other sensitive information.  
As most customers of such systems are large multinational corporations 
that depend on such tools to manage their international workforce effi-
ciently, cross-border transfers of data are often a necessity. For example, 
when an EU subsidiary of a multinational corporation manages its em-
ployee data in the cloud, this information will invariably be transferred to 
the US-based cloud provider at some point. Mostly, these transfers are car-
ried out under the standard contractual clauses exception to the DPD, since 
they are easily implemented and are well known to the vendor as well as 
the sophisticated business clients. 
In the ordinary course of business, the cloud service provider will offer its 
clients alternative locations for the data processing. These locations closely 
mirror the current data protection laws around the world and are divided 
into US, EU and other country offerings. Regularly a combination of EU-
based processing, together with a country that is considered as providing 
adequate protection under EU data protection law, is used in order to offer 
ancillary services. For example, customer support hotlines as ancillary ser-
vices can be located in countries such as Israel (a country considered to 
have an adequate data protection standard), which are closer to the local

customer time zone. The selection of the EU as processing operation is 
mostly viewed as a political and sales issue as there is no technical differ-
ence whether the data is being processed on the US or EU cloud. The cloud 
service provider is bound by the same contractual obligations as when it 
is processing the data in the EU.180  
However, due to US surveillance laws that allow for access to US-based 
data and the geographical limitation of the Stored Communications Act 
(SCA)181 to the US, great differences with regard to public access rights in 
the EU remain. These limitations are based on the outdated nature of the 
SCA, which still works on the assumption of point-to-point data transfers 
and an arbitrary distinction between the duration for which the communi-
cation is stored.  
Thus, when data is stored in the EU, it is generally safer from access by US 
public agencies that seek to access the data under a US court order. Most 
large SaaS providers have evaluated the risk of disclosure under, for in-
stance, the Patriot Act and have determined the risk to be fairly low.182  
Currently, these providers closely monitor the situation in the EU with the 
GDPR, the Privacy Shield Agreement, as well as the Brexit. In any case, 
they ensure to their EU customers that they are prepared to take all neces-
sary steps in order to comply with EU data protection law even if this 
means shifting data from UK data centers to an EU country.  
As the data used in the HR context contains also sensitive personal data, 
the cloud service providers interviewed have opted for their own dedi-
cated servers (separate from other servers), which are provided by a third 
party contractor such as AWS. The SaaS provider also contractually en-
sures that the IaaS provider maintains certain security certifications, such

as the ISO 27 000 certifications183 as well as Social Security Administration, 
and other relevant US and EU certifications. Furthermore, not even the 
coders have access to the data being processed, since this is not required 
to improve system functionality. Data access is closely logged and only 
available to a select number of employees. In any case, these providers 
treat all data as personal data in order to avoid any shortcomings.184  
The continuous and regular evaluation of data protection risks has become 
commonplace in most SaaS settings. Often, a data protection group is es-
tablished that comprises of employees from IT, legal and management 
who meet up on a regular basis to discuss any potential threats relating to 
data protection, privacy, and security. Furthermore, before a new feature 
is implemented, the IT and management team assesses its risks with re-
gard to these factors.185  
2. 
SaaS Application Monitoring 
An infinite number of applications enable businesses to communicate, ap-
praise, market and control their operations. These tools all run in the cloud 
and have the potential to malfunction at any given point for a vast array 
of reasons. Thus, in order to identify issues as fast as possible, SaaS appli-
cation monitoring is an essential element in reducing risk and resolving 
any system glitch that may arise. AppDynamics is one of the most success-
ful cloud providers offering such a service to many different service indus-
tries, including banking, insurance, retail, and wholesale. Two forms of so-
lutions are provided for customers wishing on premises or off-premises 
hosting in the AWS cloud.  
ȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮ 
183 
ISO/IEC 27001 formally specifies a management system that is intended to bring 
information security under explicit management control. Being a formal specifica-
tion means that it mandates specific requirements. Organizations that claim to 
have adopted ISO/IEC 27001 can therefore be formally audited and certified com-
pliant with the standard.

The monitoring system utilizes so-called agents that accompany a process, 
e.g. a java engine, and report information on that process to a central con-
trol element. If a customer selects to have these agents for all of its pro-
cesses, the application provider is able to monitor the performance of the 
entire infrastructure end-to-end. As this service is not concerned with the 
content of the process, the provider does not gain access to it. This is an 
important factor in the design of the system in order to focus on the service 
without the risks that come with unnecessary access. Providers even go so 
far as to contractually oblige their customer not to design an application in 
a manner that would allow them to gain access to the data. The most per-
sonal data that the provider receives is an IP address of a user from which 
certain information may be derived, such as the location of the computer.  
In addition to the main process monitoring tool, another service that di-
rectly analyses log files may also process personal data. This tool mines log 
files for analytic purposes in order to identify issues that may have arisen 
in the use of a service. These logs can contain a wide range of data depend-
ing on how the customer has designed their software. Thus, in order to 
limit risk the customer is contractually prohibited from storing personal 
data or other sensitive data in these files. Furthermore, if such data is in-
cluded, the customer will bear all risks associated with ȱȂ soft-
ware mining this data. From ȱȂ perspective, their engineers ensure 
that they only access the performance data and no other information.

carries a lot less obligations than a controller.186 However, with the GDPR 
the obligations of the processor will also be increased.187  
3. 
Customer Success in the Cloud 
Ensuring the satisfaction of all customers is a key factor to a successful 
business. In order to achieve this goal in the online world, an in-depth un-
derstanding of the needs and issues of customers is necessary, which re-
quires the collection and processing of a vast amount of data. Previously 
customer services were reactionary, meaning that the company only ad-
dressed an issue once it had been raised by a customer. Today, the service 
provider seeks to be more proactive in meeting the needs of its customers 
by offering flexible solutions. 
In order to increase customer satisfaction and providing a tailored service, 
sophisticated data analysis is necessary. This includes data from various 
data silos, including Salesforce, billing records, communication protocols 
and log files. Cloud service providers are able to copy this data into the 
cloud and predict which customer requires what sort of attentions. For ex-
ample, customer retention rates can be increased, as well as tailored service 
solutions offered, based on the need of the customer. Furthermore, dy-
namic pricing can be integrated in order to increase revenue by up-selling 
or cross-selling products and services.  
The use of these innovative technologies is hindered by EU data protection 
law, which sets strict requirements to the processing of personal data and 
its transfer to a US cloud. Thus, a potential solution would be the pseudo-
nymization of the data under which the processing is carried out. Once a 
course of action or conclusion has been drawn, the customer then re-iden-
tifies the person to whom the data applies. 
However, the compliance requirements of the GDPR weigh heavily on any 
innovative form of Big Data analytics, as it carries the potential to identify 
an individual even with anonymized data because of the vast amount of 
data that can be merged and analyzed to determine previously unknown

80 
patterns. Based on these patterns, the re-identification of an individual be-
comes possible.  
For example, an IoT device collects information on the behavioral patterns 
of an individual. This data could be processed very freely in the US as long 
as the customer has consented by, for instance, buying the device or ac-
cepting the terms of service contained in the app he or she downloaded to 
monitor or manage the IoT device. In the EU, this data will likely be 
viewed as personal data based on its potential to indirectly identify an in-
dividual. However, currently the technology and its legal environment are 
still at an early stage. Providers of such services can thus only seek to in-
form the customer as detailed as possible of the risks involved in the col-
lection and processing of the IoT data and its potential to infringe pri-
vacy.188 Securing access to the data and in particular the aggregated data 
from various devices is a key obligations of such data controllers. This 
must be taken seriously, since a data breach can have severe effects not 
only on the individual but also the integrity and security of the backbone 
of the Internet.189 
In particular, the consent and notice requirements contained in Article 5(3) 
Directive 2002/58/EC must be adhered to, which require effective consent 
after obtaining clear and comprehensive information about the purpose of 
the processing.  
4. 
SaaS Legal Services and Discovery 
Over the last years, new service providers have emerged that offer inno-
vative SaaS that allows the managing and storage of legal documents in 
the cloud and the hiring of specialized attorneys on a project basis. Fur-
thermore, new electronic discovery tools are being offered in the cloud.

4.1 
SaaS Attorney Tools 
In international corporations increasingly new SaaS tools are used to in-
crease efficiency of legal processes. These systems often process a wide 
range of data, which includes all data surrounding the efficient billing and 
management of the system and the data that is uploaded by the customer. 
However, this necessarily includes information on the parties as well as 
the nature of the document. With this information, statistics can be gener-
ated for the customer to show what sort of legal services are most com-
monly contracted out or what the average price of a certain task was.  
In order to provide a complete service to the customer, a certain degree of 
analytics is carried out on the metadata of the documents provide as part 
of the service. This enables the SaaS provider to compile a list of how many 
referrals for a particular transaction type came from which business part-
ner. Furthermore, average turnaround time of documents as well as es-
crow percentages are ascertained in order to enable the improvement of 
ȱȂȱȱǯȱ 
At no time does the company want or seek access to the documents that 
are being exchanged, since this is not required for the provisioning of the 
service and would only increase the risks of the business by enticing em-
ployees to monetize this information.  
Based on the requirements related to security, such SaaS offerings often 
run on a secure and reliable AWS cloud. With regard to data protection, 
security issues and a potential data breach are the main concerns for an 
enterprise, as the information that is being communicated through the 
software is the most valuable data a company has. For example, this in-
cludes pending negotiations, intellectual property and other commercially 
valuable information. In order to address these risks, many providers use 
a two-layer authentication in order to ensure that the person logging in is

correctly identified.190 Most of the risks exist at the user end, thus it is es-
sential that all hard drives are encrypted and that the attorneys who are 
not familiar with the newest technology are appropriately trained.  
In order to address some of the issues the market has started to respond. 
(1) The developments in the last years show that the awareness in the mar-
ket of data breach issues has grown and more questions are being asked in 
this regard.191 However, there is a certain limit as to what resources can be 
expanded to protect data. Most providers do their best to ensure the safest 
possible environment for their SaaS applications. Nevertheless, a risk still 
remains, which is why encrypting data not being processed is an essential 
measure for any SaaS provider.  
(2) Exclusion clauses are being used to limit liability outside the control of 
ȱȂȱ ers. Currently, most SaaS start-ups only have a general 
insurance that covers a basic amount for data breaches. However, as these 
smaller SaaS start-ups are growing, they are also looking to increase their 
insurance coverage, including potentially buying specific insurances for 
data breaches.  
But some risks may arise when data that is subject to special laws is being 
ȱȱȱȂȱ¢ǯȱȱ¡, HIPAA data could 
be part of a wrongful employment termination claim and thus included in 
the documents exchanged over the SaaS platform, ultimately making the 
provider subject to this law. The issue is that in this case the provider will 
not know of the HIPAA data and thus not be able to ensure compliance 
with any applicable provisions of the law. 
The EU market currently does not seem to be of interest for SaaS in the 
legal field based on the vast amount of varying jurisdictions and laws. 
Only in ancillary cases, for example the sale of an EU-based company to a 
US company using the SaaS platform, challenges with regard to EU data 
ȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮ

Two-layer authentication requires the user to be identified by his or her device as 
well as password. Thus, a second layer of security is added by sending a tempo-
rary identifier to the device e.g. mobile phone.

protection law may arise. In this situation, data must be transferred to the 
US for due diligence assessments, which are carried out by US-based at-
torneys and accountants.192  
4.2 
Discovery in the Cloud 
Discovery in civil law cases is a fundamental concept of US law. Before a 
trial, the defendant is obliged to hand over all relevant information per-
taining to the claim made. This can entail a wide array of data including 
electronic records. Often, enterprises store and process data all around the 
globe and are not entirely aware of what data is relevant for a case. Thus, 
in order to avoid the impossibility of searching millions of records, sophis-
ticated software with machine learning capabilities is available that can 
enable a fast shifting through such data in order to determine what is rel-
evant for the case at hand. However, the court will usually be required to 
approve a particular system, as there is often a disagreement as to what 
software and search technology to use. In order to level the playing field 
for all claimants and defendants, judges must be appropriately trained and 
keep up to date with technological developments.193  
The discovery process within an international enterprise can be highly 
complex based on the different jurisdictions in which data is stored. For 
example, when a Chinese company has a subsidiary in the US and in Swe-
den, the issue can arise that the parties may want to ensure that no data is 
being transferred to China during the discovery process due to security 
and confidentiality concerns. In these situations, innovative compromises 
have to be reached. When EU data is involved, often waivers are obtained 
from the employees in order to transfer the data to the US and present it 
to the counterparty.  
In the context of third party disclosures, companies will often seek indem-
nities from the court before making a disclosure. However, the argument 
ȱȱȱ¢Ȃȱȱ ȱ ȱȱȱȱdata is disclosed will

Court194 decision may have slightly shifted this position. Nevertheless, as 
in the civil discovery process where mainly monetary disputes are re-
solved, the courts are not bound by the strict rules of criminal procedure.  
A practical example of the boundaries of electronic discovery is the data 
that is being collected in pharmaceutical studies. In these situations, a court 
order is essential in order to protect the confidentiality of the information.  
Vendors of cloud-based electronic discovery services such as Everlaw195 or 
Logikcull196 are closely vetted by law firms, which includes on-site checks 
during which the security and infrastructure are inspected. Sometimes this 
also includes penetration testing carried out by an independent third

cloud solution presents a perfect solution to carrying out international dis-
covery without the need to train the system for each country.  
In order to process the data, the cloud provider must first prepare the in-
formation for its system. However, soon this step will be carried out auto-
matically, allowing the customer to upload any data into the cloud for dis-
covery. Additionally, in order to meet the demand in other counties such 
as Australia, local AWS instances in the cloud are utilized. Maintaining an 
Australian domain requires a registered business, which then raises the

name.  
Running on cloud process for a global operation is currently impossible, 
since national data protection laws in various jurisdictions hinder the data 
transfer. This leads to potentially different search patterns for the same 
case being run in a number of countries. Ultimately, this disjointed pro-
cessing compromises the integrity of the systems although the result may 
be the same.  
Essentially, the machine learning process must be carried out repeatedly 
which leads to unnecessary costs and time consumption. Furthermore, if

data of a company subject to the discovery process is mingled across in-
stances, the accuracy increases. This is in the interest of the court process 
and in the interest of the defendant to avoid unnecessary disclosure. Often 
consent is sought to address this issue.  
However, the amount and types of data are so vast that they may touch 
upon third party rights and thus the consent sought may not be adequate. 
When there is a risk that copyright or intellectual data is involved, systems 
are used that only allow the display of the result of the processing in the 
foreign jurisdiction, as in these cases no persistent storage is created and 
no potential copyright infringement occurs.197 The GDPR litigation excep-
tion also provides for a further mechanism under which the personal data 
can be processed in the context of a litigation.198 
Access to the data is only possible through two-way identification, using 
tokens which ensure that the party gaining access has identified itself 
through the device as well as his or her unique key. On the cloud pro-
cessing level, hardware resources are shared by other instances. The dis-
covery process, however, is protected by an encryption layer that prevents 
access by other instances.  
In addition to the processing of data for discovery purposes, electronic dis-
covery providers are interested in collecting aggregated anonymous data 
in order to improve service accuracy and user experience.  
4.3 
Trends Identified by Law Firms 
Major law firms dealing with international corporations are seeing a 
higher use of escape clauses in contracts, which allow parties to get out of 
M&A deals or other transactions.199 Furthermore, the amount of employee 
records used in employment-related litigation has increased in particular 
with reference to compensation and performance and its comparison to 
others.

If a necessity for a data center in the EU exists, Switzerland is seen as one 
of the top choices as it enables corporations to move data in and out of the 
country easily. However, the higher costs in Switzerland are a certain 
drawback. In relation to Germany, some hesitation exists to move data cen-
ters there, as the German framework is viewed as being too strict. With the 
potential effects of the UK leaving the EU, US-based enterprises are seek-
ing an alternative for UK-based data centers.200 
Law firms are required to use one of the main office products in order to 
draw up their legal documents. The most commonly used software is Of-
fice 365. The cloud solution can be adjusted to the data being processed, 
thus even a HIPAA-compliant offering is made available by Microsoft. 
However, using software remotely still is not an option for law firms as 
this would include the automatic pushing of updates, which could com-
promise the integrity of their systems.201 
5. 
SaaS Communication Tools 
Many new communication tools that are cloud based have been intro-
duced to the market over the last couple of years. Essentially, they all pro-
vide a basic functionality, which is the communication of employees 
within their corporate structure as well as a tool for outside customer com-
munication. Additional features include a linking of these tools to software 
development tools, as well as a wide range of already established services 
such a SMS, Web meeting tools and Email. The service is facilitated by 
transferring the data through the cloud of the CaaS202 provider.  
As this service integrates aspects of a cloud offering and communication 
tools, both data protection laws as well as the laws relating to the protec-
tion of communication such as the E-Privacy Directive apply to these pro-
viders. In this context, US-based companies often have a UK or Irish sub-
sidiary from which they offer their services to the EU market. As some of 
the communications are done not only over the internet but also through

a chat tool, this data must be stored at least for a limited amount of time. 
Due to EU data protection law, this is often done locally as otherwise issues 
concerning trans-border transfers of personal data may arise. However, as 
data may be transferred from the EU to the US, the subsidiary in the UK 
and the US headquarters will have a contract in place containing the EU 
model clauses.  
A major challenge for communication tools which allow employees from 
different locations to send each other information is the fact that such a 
tool may lead to the communication of personal data of customers or other 
parties, which are then subject to EU data protection laws. In order to 
achieve compliance in this regard, the employees receive regular training 
and the functionality across various software programs is limited to the 
extent possible. Furthermore, the EU party contractually assures that such 
data will not be communicated through the tool and that it will indemnify 
the service provider from any claims made. However, the indemnity 
clause is often not an option based on the lack of negotiating power on the 
part of the CaaS provider. Currently, boilerplate agreements are biased in 
favor of the vendors.203 However, in all cases essential elements such as 
certification requirements, compliance undertakings, and security terms 
must be included.  
With regard to government access to data, CaaS providers also strongly 
limit the amount of data they collect unless it is necessary to provide the 
service. However, as the main focus is on facilitating communication, the 
amount of data that needs to be collected is limited. Often a first-in-first-
out approach is chosen for chat functions, where the oldest data is deleted 
first once a set limit of storage has been reached.204 Additionally, sector-
specific data will be excluded from the service through the contract. For 
example, ȱȱȱȱȱȱȱȱȱȂȱ

and this would increase the cost of the service.205

Extension: Public Services in the Cloud 
With the rise of cloud computing and Big Data in the private sector and its 
widespread adoption, government agencies also seek to benefit from this 
technology. Often government agencies have their own servers, which are 
costly to maintain and do not scale easily. The US government has taken 
steps to shift its data processing to the cloud, whilst addressing its risks 
through the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program 
(FedRAMP). As most of the standard terms in cloud contracts are unac-
ceptable to the government, special procurement methods are adopted.206 
Nevertheless, even if a public procurement procedure is used, knowledge 
of the risk management measures and requirements that the government 
must set needs to be retained as otherwise bargaining power will not suf-
fice.  
Often only a smaller number of service providers put in their offer for set-
ting up an IT infrastructure for a public entity as the process is very long 
and tedious. Furthermore, many additional requirements are imposed 
based on stricter data security requirements, whilst at the same time facil-
itating the disclosure of data under a freedom of information request. The 
existing government systems must also be taken into account, which do 
not undergo the faster replacement cycles as in the private sector. 
C. Business to Consumer in the Cloud 
The interaction with consumers who use a cloud service carries many ob-
stacles for cloud providers. These are based on the higher protections af-
forded by various laws, such as consumer protection laws as well as the 
difficulties inherent in understanding legal communications. Thus, mar-
keting services providers generally only offer a limited standardized ser-
vice, which is subject to a standard contract that has been vetted against 
ȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮ 
206 
In particular since the US government is one of the biggest purchasers of cloud 
computing services it has the power to influence the terms. See Fed. Chief Infor-
mation Officers Council, Chief Acquisition Officers Council & Fed. Cloud Com-
pliance Comm., 2 (maȱȱȃȱ Government holds the position

other commonly acceptable terms. Such an approach enables a reduction 
of potential risks as well as taking into account of the lower margins and 
transaction volumes of these contracts. 
I. 
Data Protection Implications 
From a data protection viewpoint, these service offerings to consumers 
pose unique challenges. Firstly, the data that is collected from these indi-
viduals in some form always contains personal data, requiring the cloud 
provider to fulfill notice obligations including information on the nature 
of the processing operation; the rights of the data subject, such as deletion 
and rectification rights; as well as any particular risk arising from the pro-
cessing and the use of subcontractors.  
Furthermore, the data flowing from an individual is mostly not grouped 
into specific categories and the nature generally unknown to the service 
provider. In the commercial context, these factors are individually dis-
cussed, thus resulting in a better understanding and tailoring of the ulti-
mate service use. However, this also depends on the nature of the cloud 
service, as an IaaS provider will generally have less involvement in the 
processing whereas an SaaS provider will provide software tools which 
only allow for certain processing operations. 
Consent in this context is also a major point because the data collected in 
the cloud may be combined or used with other data. The user must thus 
be made aware of such risks to be able to make an informed choice on 
whether he or she wants this to occur. Ownership rights of the uploaded 
data is also a key topic in this context. Often, the right to the data is lost 
when payments are outstanding. Furthermore, the data in the B2C context 
is not retained very long after contract termination, making it hard for in-
dividuals to restore the data. Social media sites also favor storage of the 
user data even when the contract of use is terminated in order for these 
sites to improve their service for other members.207

C. Business to Consumer in the Cloud 
90 
Mostly, the information imbalance as to how the service is provided and 
what the precise nature are of the rights and obligations of the parties un-
der contract limits the ability of the individual to make an informed deci-
sion. With the introduction of the GDPR, these requirements as to the con-
sent of an individual are subject to higher scrutiny.208  
II. 
Consumer Protection 
A wide number of consumer protection laws both in the EU and US apply 
to a B2C scenario. In essence, they aim at ensuring the customer is able to 
make an informed choice as to the service or goods that he or she buys. 
Ultimately, unfair competition by, for instance, not giving required notice 
as to who is operating a website as well as basic contractual terms, would 
fall under this broad scope.  
The FTC takes also a strong stance on these issues by regularly investigat-
ing data security and privacy practices of enterprises. It further issues 
guidelines on specific topics as to what conduct it requires from certain 
service providers. This approach, for example, includes guidance for mo-
bile health app developers. It sets out that an enterprise should endeavor 
to collect as little data as possible to limit its burden to ensure security and 
data protection obligations are met.  
De-identification is then the second step. When data is de-identified, it can-
not be reasonably associated with a particular individual. A key to effec-
tive de-identification is to ensure that the data cannot be reasonably re-
identified. For example, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
regulations require entities covered by the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) either to remove specific identifiers, in-
cluding date of birth and five-digit zip code, from protected health infor-
mation or to have a privacy and data security expert determine that the

allowing for beneficial use. For example, if an app collects geolocation in-
formation as part of an effort to map asthma outbreaks in a metropolitan 
area, the enterprise should consider whether it can provide the same func-
tionality while maintaining and using that information in a de-identified 
form. The risk of re-identification of location data can be reduced by not 
collecting highly specific location data about individual users, by limiting 
the number of locations stored for each user, or by aggregating location 
data across users. 
D. Big Data Analytics Challenges 
The study has shown that enterprises are collecting more and more data 
relating to individuals, which they seek to use in order to improve their 
existing products as well as to develop new products and services. This is 
an overall trend around the world but is particularly dominant in the US 
due to the vast possibilities to use this technology without many re-
strictions.209  
New IoT devices collect more detail-rich data related to human behavior 
and relationships as well as human biology. Such information creates an 
immense potential for researches both within enterprises and public insti-
tutions. At the same time, the tools for data analytics are also improving, 
opening new research possibilities. However, this innovation comes at the 
price of securing the privacy of the individuals whose data is being pro-
cessed and of protecting their personal liberties. The current regulatory 
framework is ill-suited to address these issues and any regulation should 
aim at enabling its use whilst respecting fundamental principles of ethics 
and privacy.210

Research Issues  
1. 
University and Business Cooperation 
Often enterprises pair up with universities and other research institutions 
in order to gain access to the vast pool of resources these institutions pro-
vide. In return, they provide the financial backing as well as the data nec-
essary for the research. However, this approach circumvents the oversight 
that would otherwise by imposed by virtue of a government funded re-
search project. For example, Facebook and Cornell University conducted a 
behavioral study on Facebook by showing users various types of infor-
mation and measuring their mood. As the users were not made aware the 
purpose of this research, the study attracted wide criticism.211  
Another example is Netflix, which made some of its usage data public after 
anonymizing with the aim of improving its service. However, through so-
phisticated algorithms, individuals could be identified. Furthermore, 
GlaxoSmith Kline has also sought to utilize the iWatch data for arthritis 
research. This highlights a clear demand for such data, whilst at the same 
time the risk and compliance requirements are often unclear.212 
2. 
Big Data Research 
Research has demonstrated how challenging privacy is in the context of 
large data sets used in the context of Big Data. These data sets have many 
data points associated with a given record and thus make the record highly 
unique and thus identifiable.213 On the one hand, the technology helps 
daily lives by improving health care, social service, as well as other im-
portant connection in our daily lives. On the other hand, these tools also 
undermine the existing privacy protection laws that are currently in place 
and are eroded by the vast capabilities that are inherent in large data col-
lection.  
ȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮ

Accordingly an approval by an institutional review board should have been 
sought. See Grimmelmann, 219 et seq.

Often data is collected from an enterprise by a third party research team, 
which has no means of informing the potentially affected data subjects of 
the processing operation. Currently, the law mostly regulates the initial 
stage of the data collection and creation but fails to place a focus on the 
subsequent use, such as transformation and dissemination. In these cases, 
data subjects have limited possibilities to revoke, withhold or modify their 
initial consent.214 Thus, technical solutions are necessary, enabling, for ex-
ample, a dynamic consent.215  
In 2014, the disparity between the contractually granted rights to Jawbone, 
a producer of a fitness tracker, and customer perception was suddenly 
brought to light in the minds of its customers. During an earthquake, the 
app registered when a user woke up and the company was able to release 
this data showing how the wearers of the device were disrupted. Up to 
this point, many customers were not aware of the vast amount of data 
these devices communicate to their producers.216  
3. 
Anonymization and Big Data 
Although anonymization and de-identification are brought up as solutions 
to the issue of processing IoT data, these technologies do not present solu-
tions as the amount of data is growing at such a rate that even anonymized 
data can lead to the identification of an individual when combined with a 
number of other data sets from various sources. This has increased the risk 
of violating discrimination laws both in the US, Europe, and Switzer-
land.217 Additionally, the perceived privacy risks may slow down the 
adoption of innovative Big Data processing, which are socially useful or 
help to increase the overall efficiency of an economy.218 In addition to the

privacy concerns, other factors play an important role such as personal au-
tonomy that shapes the Big Data debate.  
Technology is a strong driver of Big Data processing. A key enabling tech-
nology has been the development of cloud computing and dispersed pro-
cessing. Thus, when analyzing Big Data and its effects, one must take ac-
count of the underlying technology and its risks and advantages. Over the 
last years, the interoperability between various Hadoop-based219 processes 
has been improved, thus enabling processing across various platforms and 
higher levels of implementation.220 
A core design element of cloud environments is the security of the data 
environment. In this respect, open source offers some unique benefits, 
since a vast amount of professionals work on improving the system. This 
is not the case within a corporation based on a proprietary system, which 
is subject to resource limitations. Furthermore, one should be aware of the 
difference between hardware and application compliance. For example, a 
cloud infrastructure could be HIPAA compliant based on various technical 
safeguards, but the application running on it may not be HIPAA compli-
ant. Often the requirements as to the application design differ substantially 
from legislation to legislation (e.g. SOX and HIPAA). 
ȱȱ¢Ȃȱbiggest business challenges is to understand how technol-
ogy and, in particular, data processing inside as well as outside a company 
works.  
Some cloud enterprises have started experimenting with technologies such 
as placing server centers under water in order to reduce cost of cooling 
that makes up a significant part of the running costs of a server center. 
ȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮ 
219 
Hadoop is an open-source software framework used for distributed storage and 
processing of very large data sets. It consists of computer clusters built from com-
modity hardware. All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental 
assumption that hardware failures are a common occurrence and should be auto-
matically handled by the framework. 
220 
For example IBM, Hortenworks and EMC Pivotal have implemented such 
measures to ensure a better flow of data between their service offerings.  

Regulatory Gap 
 
95 
Placing these server centers into international waters will create further 
questions as to the applicable data protection laws to these centers.  
II. 
Regulatory Gap 
The main privacy protection framework has been developed in the 1970s 
and is ill suited for the new capabilities that Big Data provides. This in-
cludes the obtaining of consent, as well as the balancing of the risks to the 
individual. Furthermore, the definition of human subjects used in the Fed-
eral Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects further creates challenges, 
as it is very narrow.221 This definition requires some form of interaction or 
intervention by the researcher with the data subject. However, such inter-
action often is no longer required where the data is pulled from, for exam-
ple, social media services.  
Many of these regulatory challenges push the interpretative boundaries of 
current data protection and other laws that apply to the intersection of law 
and technology. But the legislative organs are either lacking the political 
will to face these challenges or the result of the deliberative process is too 
far removed from what the specialists have recommend to be effective in 
practice. Closing any regulatory gap that arises must be as expediently as 
possible in order to provide the market participants with the legal certainty 
they require in order to understand what compliance measures are re-
quired and how they must adjust any new service offering. Antiquated 
laws can thus hinder the development of new technologies and market en-
try by startups and other smaller innovative enterprises.

about at least 1.5 billion people, and Google reaches 90% of Internet users 
worldwide.  
Additionally, a number of unknown companies process millions of per-
sonal data records on a daily basis. A wide range of companies is involved 
in behavioral targeting, using a complex network of data flows. Essen-
tially, a system follows an ȱȂȱȱȱȱ ȱȱȬ
plays targeted advertisement.222  
Data protection laws seek to limit such a privacy infringement by setting 
strict boundaries to personal data processing. But analytics companies are 
becoming more and more creative in avoiding the use of personal data, 
thus falling outside the scope of these laws. However, the European Data 
Protection Authorities, cooperating in the Article 29 Working Party, are of 
the opinion that behavioral targeting generally entails personal data pro-
cessing because companies use the data to single out individuals. The 
Working Party is an independent advisory body and publishes opinions 
on the interpretation of data protection law. Although their opinions are 
not legally binding, judges and Data Protection Authorities often follow 
ȱȱ¢Ȃȱs.223 
At the core of determining whether an analytics processing operation re-
quires the fulfillment of the EU data protection law lies the definition of 
personal data. This applies to (i) any information (ii) relating to (iii) an 
identified or identifiable (iv) natural person.224  
The core issue in making the determination of personal data relates to the 
third element of identifiability. This conclusion heavily relies on the un-
derlying technology and its precise application to a given scenario. Court 
judgements setting out, for example, that IP addresses are personal data 
are not helpful in this regard, as the identifiability relies on who has the 
data necessary for identification. In the IP scenario, this information is only 
accessible and known by the Internet Service Provider but not to the search

account of the actual identification capabilities and the service provision-

IV. Government Data Release 
Big Data is not only a challenge for private enterprises and their compli-
ance with data protection law but also for public agencies which have col-
lected a large amount of data over decades. Only recently with the use of 
new technologies such data can now be processed in the Big Data context. 
Furthermore, the low costs of storing data incentivize such behavior. How-
ever, as the government collects data under law that allows the collection 
for a public purpose, the disclosure of such information to private parties 
that otherwise probably would not have access to the data from individual 
users creates many data protection challenges. 
1. 
United States 
1.1 
Government Data Collection 
In order to promote transparency and accountability, governments are in-
creasingly releasing a wide variety of data they collect as part of their pub-
lic function. In the US, these government data releases can be grouped into 
four broad categories, which consist of: 
 Freedom of Information and Privacy Act requests; 
 Traditional public and vital records; 
 Official statistics; 
 E-Government and Open Government Initiatives. 
Based on the nature of this data, it can be extremely important for research 
and business decisions, since the data allows a better insight into human 
behavior.225 The main question in this context is how a meaningful privacy

protection interest can be achieved. The lack of a clear framework for the 
protection of personal data may lead to a restrictive disclosure of privacy 
sensitive data.226 When privacy laws are circumstantial and open to inter-
pretation, the disclosure does not scale; thus the process of releasing infor-
mation becomes a highly labor intensive task that is slow and costly.227 De-
identification of data by traditional statistical techniques has often proven 
to not provide the required privacy protection.228  
1.2 
Freedom of Information 
When data is released under a freedom of information (federal law) re-
quest, the releasing agency is not required to notify or give the person 
whose information is made available a possibility to object to the disclo-
sure. At the state level, sometimes this right to object is given in narrow 
circumstances. Furthermore, the system is set up to penalize the employ-
ees that do not release information which should be released.  
In contrary circumstances when data should not have been released, no 
such penalty exists.229 However, the Privacy Act of 1974 generally prohibits 
disclosure of records ¢ȱȱȱ ȱȱȱȂȱȬ
sent. If a FOI exception applies, the corresponding Privacy Act exemption 
must be cited and the data released with discretion.230 Although there are 
exceptions to the disclosure such as for national security reasons or the 
data being related to internal personal records, most of the information can 
be requested.  
In deciding to release records, a balancing test has to be carried out. Thus, 
the wider a release request is framed and the higher the likelihood of a

person being linked to the information is, the more the balance favors dis-
closure.231 However, practice has shown that case law has little effect on 
the determinations of officials. Rather, their background and training af-
fect the decision-making.232 Commonly redacted information includes so-
cial security numbers, data and place of birth, as well as medical history.233  
However, in practice the rights of an individual to enforce his or her rights 
under the Federal Privacy Act remain limited through statutory hurdles 
and low damages, which ultimately do not provide the required incentive 
to change public agency behavior.234  
1.3 
Open Access 
In order to use the government data efficiently, analytics enterprises re-
quire open access to the electronic information, which enables the quick 
access and regular updating of their data pool. Previously, this has not 
been the case for all types of data, as various agencies or arms of govern-
ments have different systems and procedures on the disclosure of the data. 
This sometimes leads to unwanted restraints on the data disclosure, such 
as requiring the supply of a new hard drive for copying the data.235 Positive 
examples are the federal agencies that must frequently store requested rec-
ords in electronic reading rooms or libraries and new online platforms for 
receiving access.236  
Today, there is an entire industry dedicated to compiling information from 
public records, adding value and creating new service by combining the 
data with other data. One of the biggest providers of such a service is

Statistical data is also an area of concern for privacy advocates, as it does 
not appear to identify individuals based on the measures that must be 
taken under the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Effi-
ciency Act (CIPSEA).237 However, by combining the statistical data with 
other data sets, identification becomes possible again.

Generally, surveillance measures are only accepted by the Member State 
courts in an individual case based on evidence presented by the prosecu-
tor. The prosecutor must show that there are no other reasonable means 
available to obtain the information sought and specify the duration for 
which the surveillance is granted. Based on these facts the judge will bal-
ance the competing interests of the state against the rights of the individual 
to determine whether a warrant for certain surveillance measures will be 
granted.

E. Discrimination Based on Data 
The ability to discriminate against individual persons or groups of people 
by using technology such as cloud computing, Big Data and IoT presents 
a high risk for any enterprise. Often the discrimination is not fully noticed 
as systems may identify patterns that are used for targeted advertisement 
but result in an effective discrimination of a group of people based on his 
or her race, color, sexual orientation, age, etc. The laws with regard to this 
conduct may allow the affected individuals to bring discrimination law-
suits, which can cost start-ups as well as large corporations millions of dol-
lars. Thus, in addition to potential violations of data protection and other 
laws regulating the use of certain types of data, the result of the conducted 
processing operation and its application to the business may also violate 
anti-discrimination laws.  
I. 
Big Data 
1. 
Key Elements 
The White House has highlighted the potential for discriminatory Big Data 
analytics, as well as its ability to reduce discriminatory practices when ap-
plied correctly.239 In particular, the report includes the fact that predictive 
analysis can be a barrier to entry and thus hardwire discrimination. For 
example, such analytics are already used for credit scoring, which auto-
matically rates the risk of a single mom living in a low-rent neighborhood

E. Discrimination Based on Data 
102 
Thus, when machines make decisions, human control and checks are es-
sential.  
Furthermore, when designing such algorithms accounts of biases must be 
taken. On the positive side, Big Data can also act as a tool to identify bias 
by comparing a huge amount of decisions and predictions and contrasting 
these to certain characteristics. The main categories which can create dis-
criminatory effects are (i) based in the data that is used as input to an algo-
rithm and (ii) the inner working of the algorithm itself. 
When the discrimination results from the data, the source is either:240 
a) Poorly chosen data in which the designer of the system selects what 
data is used but omits other data. This causes a discrimination against 
the omitted class. Such situations can occur when certain data is 
deemed not to be required for the decision but not including it results 
in a discriminatory result.  
b) Incomplete, incorrect, or outdated data, which can be created by a lack 
of technical rigor and comprehensiveness in the data collection. For 
example, the data collected is not updated regularly even though it 
changes frequently.  
c) Selection bias that results in the data sample not being representative 
of a population and thus discriminating against the omitted group. 
d) Unintentional perpetuation and promotion of historical biases derived 
from a feedback loop, causing a bias in inputs or results of the past to 
replicate itself.  
Furthermore, the design of algorithmic systems and machine learning can 
also facilitate discrimination through: 
a) Poorly designed machines systems, which facilitate the finding of in-
formation. If such systems are not kept up to date and account for his-
torical biases within the data or algorithm used, they may produce dis-
criminatory outcomes.

b) Personalization and recommendation services that narrow instead of 
expand user options. For example, when a user receives targeted ad-
vertisements automatically, market segments are excluded, and the 
person is no longer aware of this information. 
c) Decision-making systems that equate correlation and causation. This 
can happen when a system thinks that because two factors occur to-
gether, they must be in a causal relationship. 
d) Data sets that lack information or disproportionately represent certain 
populations, resulting in imprecise algorithmic systems that facilitate 
discrimination because of the flawed input.  
2. 
Credit Scoring 
With the increase in scoring capabilities through Big Data, the risk that a 
person who would otherwise have a good credit will be classed as unscor-
able has risen. Today, electronic systems rely on the data they receive from 
other lenders in order to produce an automated credit decision. However, 
those that do not have loans will not be able to receive a score, as there is 
no data on file and thus will not be granted a loan based on a lack of data. 
As this affects mostly African-Americans or Hispanic-Americans, discrim-
ination is created if no other credit assessment method is offered to account 
for their unique situations.241 However, with the rise of Big Data, new 
methods in assessing credit risks can be developed that take into account 
new data sources that do not limit the assessment to current loans and past 
loans. This fact will benefit low-income borrowers, as with additional util-
ity and telephone bill data 70% of the unscorable files would become scor-
able.242

company seeks to find the perfect candidate that not only has the technical 
skills the company is looking for but also the cultural values of the com-
pany and the nature necessary for the role. Such analytical tools have 
found widespread use today in the pre-selection process. However, often 
the way in which they work or how the final list of candidates is computed 
remains unclear.  
Additionally, by selecting people based on keywords and assumptions re-
lated to their personalities, diversity is reduced when the company only 
seeks out people that are like the employees they already have. Further-
more, factors such as the length of time at a job could discriminate against 
individuals who have been unemployed for a longer period previously.243

the system only provides information on the applicants that all meet quan-
tifiable criteria. Furthermore, new systems that run in the cloud allow for 
a comparison of salaries across various corporate entities in order to ensure 
equal pay and non-discrimination.244  
4. 
Higher Education 
Potentials for unwanted outcomes of Big Data processes are also present 
in the context of higher education. Data that is collected through the en-
rollment process as well as in class can be analyzed to determine whether 
a particular student requires some form of assistance or tailored study. 
However, the same tools can also be used to discriminate against such stu-
dents by denying admission or other opportunities.  
In particular, the US college system, which is very expensive and requires 
students to take out huge loans, can benefit from data analysis. For the first 
time, parents are able to view a nationwide comparison of colleges based 
on an analysis of income after graduation, dropout, loan repayment, as 
well as other data that Big Data tools can help to understand. This enables 
parents and students to determine at what college they receive the most

benefit for their money. They are then able to make an informed choice on 
a college based on their individual circumstances and preferences.  
Big Data technology can also help students learn more effectively through 
tailored instructions based on their level of knowledge and areas that need 
more attention. Georgia State University has rolled out a program in 2013, 
which tracks over 800 risk factors for each student on a daily basis. It aims 
at identifying problems that then can be resolved through proactive 
measures. This approach has resulted in an increase in graduation rate of 
6% and has significantly benefited underprivileged groups, including 
black and Hispanic students.245 Additionally, this tailored care results in 
faster graduation and thus reduced the financial costs for the students. 
In the context of admission procedures, additional data may help in the 
selection process. However, it can also disadvantage poorer applicants, 
since parent income is an indicator for college outcomes. 
5. 
Criminal Justice 
The use of Big Data in the context of law enforcement has significantly in-
creased in the US over the last decade. Technologies that help to catch and 
identify criminals can also be used to make law enforcement accountable 
to their communities.  
Modelling systems can refine the understanding of crime hot spots and 
link crime data to other factors in order to identify measures that should 
be implemented in the community to reduce violence and other risk fac-
tors. De-identified police data as well as other contextual data can be used 
to carry out predictive analyses, which will enable the prediction of areas 
and times in which the risk of crimes is highest. The police is then able to

dispatch additional units to these areas to prevent criminal activities. 
These proactive steps have resulted in large reduction of reported crime. 
In order to reduce the risk of singling out particular communities based on 
individual characteristics, such as race, sexual orientation, religion or in-
come level, the systems and algorithms must be assessed against the risk 
that historical data presents. Feedback loops are able to reduce these risks, 
but they must be carefully constructed. However, the core risks lie in the 
data sources, which are often not up to data or lack the required richness 
and are partially non-complete. 
II. 
Use of Personal Data in Big Data Processing 
The above detailed examples of how Big Data is used are, for the most part, 
not inhibited by data protection laws in the US. However, in the EU, the 
extensive privacy protection framework as well as the data protection laws 
both on EU and national levels place strong limitations on the use of per-
sonal data for Big Data analytics. If the processing is for public purposes 
or in the public interest, EU Member States are granted some leeway in 
implementing their own law that ensures the protection of personal data 
while allowing for this data to be utilized for the benefit of the Member 
State.246  
Although the EU is increasing its stance on a digital economy, Member 
States are still slow to adopt new technology in their public sectors.247 Of-
ten the structures are ill equipped to new changes, and the authorities lack 
the insights necessary to benefit from new technologies such as Big Data. 
Additionally, the data collection in Europe is far more limited than in the 
US, and thus the data required for a detailed and reliable analysis is often 
not available.  
Open government is a core concept both in the EU as well as in the US. 
However, in the EU, information often is not released in an electronic form,

which would allow third party vendors to design and implement services 
that make use of such data. This is partially based on data protection law, 
aiming at protecting personal information when the release of such data is 
sought by the government. In these cases, the data must not contain any 
personal data that would allow the identification of an individual. Only 
when the balancing test between the interests of the public and the data 
subject whose data is contained in the data to be disclosed favors a disclo-
sure can the information be released. This is an individual assessment and 
cannot be conducted by automated means, which results in much of the 
information not being disclosed unless a person seeks access to it under a 
freedom of information request.248  
Thus, in order to use information that is collected and produced in the 
public sector more efficiently, rules must be implemented to allow public 
agencies to increase their efficiency. Naturally this data should only be 
used internally and not given to commercial enterprises. Any results of the 
Big Data processing activities must be made subject to an independent re-
evaluation procedure, which ensures the integrity, accuracy, and reliabil-
ity of the data and also the system that compute any result of a processing 
operation.  
Linking all sorts of government data such as health, financial data and per-
sonal characteristics together increases the overall precision and prediction 
capabilities of the data. Thus, the line is blurring between the various types 
of data which will in the future present significant legal questions in par-
ticular in the US, as these types of information are governed by individ- 
ual and specific regulation. One dataset containing health and financial 
data would, for example, be subject to HIPAA249 as well as the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act250 and other relevant legisla-
tion. Managing the use and interaction of the data as well as the results of 
processing and analysing the data becomes a complex matter, as some of

the recipients may not generally be regulated by any of these laws yet will 
face additional burdens when using or receiving such information.  
In order to be able to address the issues created by Big Data, a better un-
derstanding of the cloud infrastructure underlying such Big Data calcula-
tions is necessary.251 A legal as well as a contractual framework regulating 
cloud provider activities must be in place to ensure a minimum data pro-
tection level is met before the further complexities of Big Data are added 
to the mix.  
However, the reality is such that the data protection level achievable be-
fore the advancements of the cloud and Big Data is no longer practicable, 
because the technological ease of a privacy infringement has exceeded ex-
pectations and, to some extent, gone beyond the ability of governments to 
regulate effectively at national level.252 It is therefore sensible to start tack-
ling these challenges by focusing on regulating the personal data transac-
tions at the lowest level of the cloud first before addressing the technolo-
gies utilizing the cloud further up the service hierarchy.253  
A point of criticism has been the lack of guidance on how broadly formu-
lated privacy principles on which many countries agree can be imple-
mented.254 The local implementation of broad horizontal privacy princi-
ples (in accordance with national interests such as human rights, security 
and cost) has reached its limits with the emergence of new Web 2.0 sys-
tems. Currently the GDPR could set the international data privacy stand-
ard, as there is a lack of movement on the international level by the UN to

Attempts at implementing privacy policy into technology are being undertaken 
by ENISA. However the ineffectiveness of the currently applied anonymization 
technologies in the context of Big Data are questionable (see Danezis and others, 
37). The Article 29 Working Party has also published a statement in this regard:

ment of Big Data on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing

pass appropriate measures. Parallel to the delayed regulation, technical 
think tanks have emerged with the purpose of finding technical solutions 
to the privacy issues created by technologies such as the Internet of Things, 
cloud computing and Big Data. But, the legislative process is too slow to 
keep up with technological development, thus emerging privacy stand-
ards will be driven more by technology than by regulation. Customer de-
mand for privacy will also play an important role in shaping the future of 
how privacy is ensured. 
Regarding the GDPR and current developments in the EU the question 
arises whether the consent and collection focus is still a prudent solution 
as Big Data allows for all sorts of identification scenarios which are not 
covered by the scope of the GDPR at the time of collection. They only arise 
later in the context of processing for statistical purposes. Thus, the legisla-
tor should place a stronger focus on protecting data subjects irrespective 
of whether they have consented to an initial collection. As Big Data pro-
cessing operations make out the bulk of processing in the cloud, emphasis 
must be placed on these questions and on ensuring a harmonization of the 
rules regarding obligations in the context of processing for statistical pur-
poses.255 
F. Compliance and Risk Mitigating Measures 
The increased international regulations have led to higher compliance 
costs as well as to a major complexity in international data transfers. Com-
panies are increasingly facing requirements they currently are not able to 
meet because of the way in which their data collection is set up.256 Thus, 
becoming compliant with all the various data protection laws requires a

255 
Article 89 GDPR allows Member States much leeway in imposing their own re-
quirements.

For example, these particular issues arise in the context of data protection laws 
and the combination of Big Data, resulting in a higher degree of identifiability of a 
person. The initial collection of the data may not have required consent, however, 
based on the nature of the processing conducted at a later time and the result of

step-by-step approach taking into account the areas in which the risk is the 
highest and addressing them first.  
As a consequence of developments towards a more active inclusion of dif-
ferent stakeholders into the rule-making processes, many issues such as 
the models of data privacy governance, their convergence, the need for 
globalized data protection standards, and the regulation of trans-border 
data flows need to be reflected anew.  
I. 
Privacy Management Programs 
The respective refinement and adaption of privacy rules can be carried out 
through the improvement and the practical implementation of privacy 
management programs that enable enterprises to satisfy the regulators and 
supervisors of their compliance with privacy standards. Such programs 
also have the potential to act as a strong marketing instrument since they 
send a signal that businesses care about the privacy of their customers and 
stakeholders by attempting to reduce the risk of a privacy breach.  
The content and structure of such programs can be quite flexible, thus en-
abling the necessary adaptation to the given circumstances. Nevertheless, 
a stronger coordination on the international level as to privacy standards 
seems warranted in light of the great differences in protection levels. In 
particular, the cooperation among data protection authorities from differ-
ent states must be enhanced in order to prevent violations.257 
1. 
Achieving Data Protection Compliance 
Effective data security starts with assessing what information the company 
has and identifying who has access to it. Understanding how personal in-
formation moves into, through, and out of the business and who hasȯor 
could haveȯaccess to it is essential to assessing security vulnerabilities. In 
order to determine the best way to the protection of personal data, the data 
flows must be understood.  
ȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮ 
257 
Galetta and Kloza, N 1 et seq.; Weber, Internationale Trends bei Datenschutz- 
Managementsystemen, 31 et seq. 

Privacy Management Programs

A first step is to establish an inventory of all computers, laptops, mobile 
devices, flash drives, disks, home computers, digital copiers, and other 
equipment to find out where the company stores sensitive data. Also, the 
information should be inventoried by type and location. Personal data is 
stored throughout the business in a number of waysȯ through websites, 
from contractors, from call centers, and the like. No inventory is complete 
until a search has been conducted at every place where sensitive data 
might be stored. 
Once the personal data that is present in the company has been assessed, 
the data flows into, through and out of its various IT systems must be mon-
itored and assessed against the processing justifications necessary under 
the applicable law. The best approach is to determine what information is 
actually necessary to provide the service and not to collect any data that is 
not essential. However, in light of the decreasing costs of data storage, 
many companies take a different approach and collect all data they are able 
to. The ultimate goal is to use this data in the future for yet unknown pur-
poses. This also applies to Apps running on mobile devices, which collect 
much more precise metadata of the user such as geolocation data. Re-
straints should be applied to the use of such data, as liability for data pro-
tection infringements arises very easily in this context. 
A number of steps should be considered in the development of a privacy 
management program. The steps include the development of organiza-
tional privacy policies, standards and/or guidelines which define privacy 
program activities. Such activities include education and awareness train-
ing, monitoring and responding to the regulatory environment, ensuring 
internal policy compliance, setting up data inventories encompassing data 
flows, and classification.258  
Additionally, data protection impact assessments and the required mitiga-
tion measures such as incident response and applicable jurisdictional re-

quirements must be prepared. Such assessments aim at offering the assur-
ance that the system is compliant, which is enforced through external au-
dits.  
2. 
Privacy Operational Life Cycle 
Privacy of any personal data flowing in and out of an organization must 
be ensured throughout the entire life cycle during which the company is 
responsible for it. This requires an assessment of the status quo to establish 
a baseline of the current level of privacy protection. Based on this infor-
mation, targeted education and awareness campaigns can be created.  
The success of such measures has to be monitored and further refined 
through internal policies upon which the employees can rely when carry-
ing out their tasks. From a technical point, the internal data flows must be 
mapped and personal data storage and flow identified. Once this is done, 
responsibility must be attributed to a person who must ensure that this 
data processing operation is data protection compliant.  
The risk assessment will enable the organization to gauge the exposure it 
has and the measure it wants to take to reduce the risk. In addition to such 
measures, insurance is also another tool to further shift liability. However, 
any insurance company will seek the implementation of appropriate safe-
guards to be able to calculate the risks. Thus companies must focus on ful-
filling at least key privacy processing risk mitigation goals. Any strategy 
will be based on a gap analysis that aims at comparing the safeguards al-
ready in place with the ones set either by data protection law or by an in-
surance company, which in most cases are higher than the minimum pro-
tections required by law.  
Compliance with privacy law does not end within the organization but 
also requires a detailed assessment of the contracted service vendors that 
often supply core data processing services. These vendors must also com-

municate who has access to what data and where it is stored or processed. 
In the cloud, this at least means informing the customer which processing 
centers are being used.  

Privacy Management Programs 
 
113 
A core function of the data protection officer in particular in larger compa-
nies is the maintenance of different types of relationships both with inter-
nal and external stakeholders. These aim at ensuring efficient communica-
tion between all parties involved in the internal audit, physical and 
information security environment. With a view to the regulators, a strong 
working relationship with the Data Protection Authorities is essential in 
order to understand what measures are required for compliance. This task 
includes the scope of the contractual requirements when engaging third 
party vendors and their monitoring and auditing.259  
Data Protection Officers, however, should not only focus on risks that arise 
from digital data processing but must also focus on the physical aspects of 
the daily operations. This includes seemingly simple questions, such as 
who has physical access to equipment and how physical data such as doc-
uments are destroyed. As computers have a short lifespan and are regu-
larly replaced, storage media on these devices must be completely erased. 
Physical safeguards, such as the blocking of USB drive insertion, are also 
an important step to ensure intentional or negligent data copying does not 
occur, thus limiting the risk that personal data may leave the company. 
3. 
Communication and Training 
Communicating goals, values, and information pertaining to data protec-
tion and data security to employees in a coherent and receptive manner is 
key in ensuring the data protection management program is reflected in 
daily operations. This includes creating awareness of the organizatioȂȱ
privacy program internally and externally, as well as ensuring policy flex-
ibility in order to incorporate legislative, regulatory, and market require-
ments. Furthermore, developing internal and external communication 
plans to ingrain organizational accountability is an important aspect to fos-
ter the implementation of company values.260

114 
In addition to communication in general, documents in particular require 
focus. For example, a company must identify, catalog and maintain docu-
ments requiring updates as privacy requirements change. The training re-
quirement also extends not only to employees or management but also to 
contractors who ȱȱȱ ȱȱȱ¢Ȃȱ¢ȱǯ  
These privacy policies must translate into operational privacy practices, 
which take form in standard operation procedures covering aspects such 
as data creation, retention, disposal and usage as well as access controls, 
incident reporting and key employee contact details. 
Monitoring the application of various procedures and policies ensures on-
going compliance. This can be done through the use of appropriate appli-
cations as well as through compliance staff. Any compliance measure 
should also be able to adjust to any regulatory or legislative change, and 
such changes must be quickly reported across all relevant divisions. Reg-
ular internal audits must complete any well-functioning compliance sys-
tem.  
4. 
Response to Data Protection Issues 
Responding to various data protection issues brought to the company by 
external parties must be conducted in a standardized and approved form. 
This, for example, includes information requests to which a company is 
subject once it deals with individuals in the EU. If additional access is 
sought, the boundaries of such access and the correction or alteration 
rights should be clearly set out.261  
Overseeing and ensuring data integrity and responding to potential pri-
vacy incidents must also be part of a response plan. The goal of any com-
pliance system should be placed on preventing harm and ensuring ac-
countability. Such a response plan has to be set out the responsibilities and 
roles of key employees. However, it should not only include internal em-
ployees, but third-party stakeholder that influences the personal data pro-
cessing must also be taken into account. 
ȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮȮ 
261 
See for example Article 12-21 GDPR. 

Privacy Management Programs 
 
115 
The communications and public relationship department must also be pre-
pared for a wide array of incidents and for appropriately dealing with such 
situations. Specialized incident oversight teams consisting of IT, legal, and 
communication professional should be tasked with overseeing any inci-
dent and regularly meet to discuss any changes that need to be made to 
the incident response plan. 
Managements should also include the incident response plan into their 
business continuity planning. However, before any response can poten-
tially be taken, the incident must be identified. Thus, a privacy incident 
needs to be defined and classed based on its impact. Following this assess-
ment, a reporting process should be set into action that enables early alarm 
to management. Additionally, detection capabilities such as monitoring 
software should be installed to alert the IT early of any potential breach. 
However, as incidents are not only digital but could also occur in the ana-
log world when an employee causes a breach, appropriate procedures for 
such a situation should also be established. 
From a legal perspective, often incident response plans that include the top 
management are required by law. This is also part of many insurance con-
tracts that pay out in the case of a security breach by a hacker. Such a re-
sponse should also document all actions taken in order to not only satisfy 
the data protection authorities but also further investigate the incident and 
identify the extent of the damage caused.  
5. 
Compliance Toolbox 
In view of the described features of privacy as a fundamental right and the 
application of data protection laws, businesses must develop a strategy for 
complying with the applicable legal requirements from many numbers of 
sources. (i) Organizational rules have to describe the functions of respon-
sible persons and segregate the duties amongst them. (ii) The data protec-
tion policy must describe the security levels and the measures applied to 
achieve such levels. (iii) A project management needs to be implemented 
and conditions for user participation should be established. (iv) A data 
classification scheme is to be developed in order to control access rights.

F. Compliance and Risk Mitigating Measures 
116 
(v) Adequate responsibility measures and surveillance requirements for 
review processes must be introduced. 
Private initiatives such as the implementation of privacy management sys-
tems are particularly important, since it appears unlikely that the gap be-
tween the two major regulatory approaches for data protection regimes 
will be overcome in the near future.262 On the one hand, some countries 
(for example, the Member States of the European Union, Switzerland, and 
Hong Kong) have a comprehensive data protection model, containing core 
principles such as provisions on data processing and international data 
transfers as well as specific rules related to e-privacy measures. On the 
other hand, some countries have implemented a sectoral or self-regula-
tory/co-regulatory model (for example United States and Australia). The 
different approaches will most likely remain in place for the next decade, 
creating challenges for cross-border data flows due to the incoherent levels 
of protection. 
Certifications under Section 5 of Chapter IV of the new GDPR also present 
a step in unifying data protection compliance by having an independent 
third party evaluate a processing operation. These certifications are accom-
panied by an industry-approved code of conduct, which enables standards 
to be created that match the requirement of a subset of processor and are 
tailored to their needs. Furthermore, the EU Data Protection Board (EDPB), 
consisting of the heads of the EU Member State data protection authorities, 
is empowered to issues guidelines for certain processing operations or 
general matters and aims to ensure a uniform application of the GDPR 
across all Member States.263

Contractual Measures 
The companies are generally quite free as to how they want to contract for 
various issues. This includes the data security obligations as well as all as-
sociated liabilities. Furthermore, in addition to data security, a breach of

confidentiality is a second central point that often comes up during con-
tract negotiations. Thus, some companies have opted to have one clause 
for data breaches, which governs incident response as well as notification 
and liability provisions, whereas a lesser number of companies have taken 
it upon themselves to separately define a data security breach vs. a breach 
of confidence based on a disclosure of data. This seemingly became neces-
sary because enterprises that could not recover under the data security 
clause sought alternative means to recoup their loss by arguing that the 
disclosure of the data to a third party was a breach of confidence for which 
the party was ultimately responsible. 
In order to mitigate such a risk, it is advisable to either include the breach 
of confidence into the general liability provisions for a data breach or to 
separately and narrowly define such an incident. Obviously, all employees 
of a cloud provider should sign non-disclosure agreements. Depending on 
the nature of their function, they may gain access to valuable information. 
Some enterprises will also seek to ensure that the cloud vendor does not 
have access to any information and only receives the access to the extent 
necessary in order to facilitate the service. All interviewed cloud vendors 
agreed in this context that they do not want access to the data, since their 
core business is to offer the service they often can provide without access-
ing it. However, some cloud vendors, such as electronic discovery cloud 
platforms, necessarily require access to the data in order to improve the 
service. In these cases, the access must be limited to a certain number of 
employees. Access to all systems should also be logged as to ensure that 
their work environment is safe from unauthorized personnel.  
Most cloud services include to some extent personal data. This is because 
the metadata of tasks being carried out or programs being run (e.g. app) 
can be used to single out an individual user. Other risks are based on the 
data processed in the cloud itself by the cloud customer. However, the 
cloud vendor will seek as little as possible access to it and leave the control 
for altering the data entirely in the hands of its customer. This is particu-
larly important when later the need arises to distinguish the cloud vendor 
from a controller as opposed to a processor under EU data protection law.

F. Compliance and Risk Mitigating Measures 
118 
Achieving compliance in the cloud is a major challenge that requires care-
ful preparation. This includes implementing a compliance checklist that 
accounts for the most important factors, such as data security. Third party 
IaaS vendors, such as AWS or Microsoft, will be able to support this pro-
cess by offering their certifications and external compliance checks.264  
II. 
Non-disclosure Agreements and Internal Protocols 
A core requirement for data protection and confidentiality is the enforce-
ment and control of processes established to protect data within an enter-
prise. This includes strong non-disclosure agreements (NDA) ensuring 
that the data to which employees gain access is not disclosed outside the 
company, as otherwise it would be liable for a substantial sum of money.265  
Internal protocols about how to handle data, including clean desk policies, 
locked containers, screen protectors etc., are an integral part of any risk 
reduction strategy. Most data security breaches are committed by employ-
ees either negligently or intentionally. At the very least, unintentional 
breaches are avoidable through appropriate training.  
III. Updates 
Software updates present both a risk as well as an opportunity to decrease 
exposure. Most updates aim at patching problems that have been identi-
fied and at increasing usability of a service. On the downside, any change 
in a running system may create new problems and open up new intrusion 
vulnerabilities. Often a staggered release across multiple zones is carried 
out in order to identify any glitch that can be repaired before the update is 
rolled out to all customers.  
IV. Insurance 
Insurance is a basic requirement for any company offering services in the 
digital world. This mostly includes the basic general liability insurance,

Insurance

which may cover data breaches up to a certain limited amount. However, 
in practice these limited insurance sums do not cater for the loss that a data 
breach in the cloud could create.266 Thus, when determining what 
measures to take in order to fulfill data protection requirements, security 
breaches should also be considered and the potential loss ascertained. This 
information will then allow the company to seek out the appropriate level 
of insurance tailored to their individual risk profile.  
Cyber risk is now a major threat to businesses. Today, it has become a mat-
ter of how a company manages and responds to cyber risks that counts. 
Companies need to make decisions on which cyber and data risks are to 
avoid, accept, control, or transfer. Data not properly managed can quickly 
become a liability and an expensive direct cost to a company. When a data 
security breach or a cyber-attack happens, the company needs comprehen-
sive cyber insurance protection to help it to respond. These insurance 
schemes are available up to 500 million USD with the average claim being 
around 700 000 USD.267 
Coverages currently available include: Network Security Liability, Privacy 
Liability (Including Employee Privacy), Breach Response, Privacy Regula-
tory Defense, Fines and Penalties, Errors and Omissions, Forensics, Multi-
media Liability, PCI Fines and Penalties, Network Business Interruption, 
Data Loss, Cyber Extortion and Cyber Terrorism. These insurances come 
also with access to a 24/7 team of incident response experts. Often, insur-
ance companies also offer complimentary cyber risk assessments as part of 
their own risk and premium evaluation. 
The number of claims based on data breaches has steadily risen and often 
covers not only financial data, which is mostly securely guarded, but also 
employee records. For example, employee records, including exit inter-
views and disability applications, were leaked from the Little Eagle Casino

in Canada.268 Others include a data breach when an employee copied 600 
health files to a flash drive that was subsequently lost.269 However, where 
the misconduct is intentional and based on a lack of sufficient protection 
tools and procedures, the insurance company is unlikely to cover the inci-
dent. Not even in hacking cases are companies immune, as shown in the 
case of the Israeli company Cellebrite from which over 900GB of data were 
stolen.270 Thus the need for insurance persists across all business sectors 
even in industries which deem themselves to be sufficiently protected 
based on their particular expertise with data security. 
G. Ensuring Data Security 
Cyber security has long been a growing area of concern for many scholars 
as well as enterprises seeking to ensure that data is not accessed by a third 
party that has no rights to the data. Often rules in various jurisdictions of-
fer precise guidance on certain data protection aspects but only vaguely 
highlight the requirement of cyber and data security.271 At one point, the 
concern of legislators was the risk of deciding on a technology by imposing 
fixed requirements. This may defy the purpose of data security, since the 
legislator does not have the capacity or knowledge to determine what se-
curity technology is most appropriate. Such technologies are also under-
going rapid change and may be out of date after a short period of time. 
Thus, enterprises must be able to adjust their security measures in accord-

ance with the technological evolution. What measure is appropriate, tak-
ing into account the risk, costs and benefits, may also vary heavily from 
system to system and should be left to the companies.  
I. 
General Measures 
In Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents 
Act (PIPEDA)272 states that the information must be protected by safe-
guards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. The nature of the 
safeguards may vary depending on the sensitivity, amount, format, and 
distribution of the information as well as its storage method. The methods 
are broadly described and include physical, organizational and technolog-
ical measures. Such a principle-based approach is also applied in the US 
and Australia.  
With the flexibility that such an approach provides comes the lack of pre-
cision required by various industries to draw the legal certainty for their 
compliance measures. In order to address these issues, supervisory author-
ities have published guidance documents and reports based on previous 
cases. For example, the FTC published on 29 July 2016 a guidance on what 
are required in order to meet the level of reasonable and appropriate data 
security practices.273  
In the US, the data security question is governed by the three-prong un-
fairness test from the Wyndham case.274 This includes a cost- benefit anal-
ysis that considers a number of relevant factors, including the probability 
and expected size of reasonably avoidable harms to consumers given a cer-
tain level of cybersecurity and cost to consumers in taking such 
measures.275  
Thus, the test remains as to whether the measures taken by the enterprise 
are reasonable in light of all the facts. In Canada, the focus is placed on

appropriate safeguards. Whether these two standards differ in their appli-
cation must be examined with reference to the respective national law. 
However, on their face they appear to be very similar. In the UK, this 
standard is lower than in Canada as the UK Data Protection Act only re-
quires appropriate measures taking into account the state of technological 
development and the cost associated with implementation. The US FTC 
guidance also includes a cost-benefit analysis in light of the required in-
vestment and its outcome.  
In the LabMD report, the FTC focused on the following factors: 
 Whether the data being processed is sensitive data that requires aware-
ness within the company; 
 Whether there are appropriate processes, procedures, and systems to 
handle information security risks and whether there is internal or ex-
ternal expertise available on this topic; 
 Whether a safeguard assessment is in place that offers the required 
level of safeguards for any processed personal information; 
 Whether a risk balance is in place which adopts safeguards in accord-
ance with the risk. 
Thus, when an enterprise collects a large number of sensitive personal in-
formation, a governance framework is necessary that takes account of the 
abovementioned factors.276 In the Ashley Madison case, the FTC high-
lighted that the company lacked documented policies and practices that 
would have provided clear security expectations. Furthermore, a clear risk 
management process was also lacking. Without such a regular assessment, 
appropriate measures that must be taken in order to reduce security risks 
cannot be determined. If necessary, such expertise must be acquired exter-
nally and should be based on the nature and volume of the processed in-
formation. Importantly, the documented risk management framework

must include a guidance on how the enterprise determines what security 
measures are appropriate to a faced risk. 
Interestingly, the FTC observed that the company had been evaluating ac-
quiring external expertise on data security but that it ultimately decided 
against it. It remains to be seen whether such an evaluation of a need will 
play a role in assessing the measures taken. 
Some practices have become the common standard and must be imple-
mented by all organizations handling personal information, such as multi-
factor authentication. This technology consists of information the user

ent to the user. Many systems only focus on the knowledge part and lack 
the two other elements.277  
Key and password management practices must also be adjusted to ensure 
third party access to the data is impossible. This includes not to store such 
credentials on shared drives and to protect the internal systems suffi-
ciently. Importantly, employees should be limited in their ability to access 
keys and never store any login details in an unencrypted fashion. Once a 
hacker gains access to a system by exploiting a human error, he or she can 
in most cases move very freely between systems as the authentication has 
already taken place.

In addition to the requirements under general data protection law, special 
legislation sometimes applies, such as the HIPAA which requires the iden-
tification of risks and vulnerabilities as part of a general compliance pro-
cedure. From a technological side, the Nation Institute of Science and Tech-
nology provides guidelines regarding risk management in information 
technology systems. As the chart below illustrates, data security violations 
are often based in employee and third party access to the premises and not 
by outside hackers.278

Today, the following measures should be the basis of any risk assess-
ment:279 
 Intrusion detection systems; 
 File integrity monitoring; 
 System penetration testing; 
 Updated virus scanner and regular checks; 
 Manual inspections with written protocols; 
 Effective firewall including data flow monitoring. 
The higher monitoring requirements create challenges with regard to user 
privacy because the monitoring will in one way or another touch upon the 
transmitted data in order to assess whether the data flow is legitimate. 
Thus, although such a measure aims at increasing security, it may well af-
fect privacy.  
Although the guidance provided is very basic, it is a first step towards 
more certainty. However, any of the measures will affect the security 
measures taken by companies offering goods or services online. Often cor-
porate culture is a big part of how management and the enterprise in gen-
eral approach security issues and whether the will to set sufficient re-
sources aside for such measures is present.

Security and the Internet of Things 
The Internet of Things has further increased the complexity of data collec-
tion, transfer, and storage. In this context, new and exciting technologies 
are making life much easier whilst at the same time collecting an increa- 
sing amount of data about the persons within the surroundings of the de-
vice.

The IoT adds new security dimensions to consider. For example, an inse-
cure connection could give a hacker access not just to the confidential in-

work. Furthermore, in the IoT, the risk is not just based in the disclosure 
or deletion of data. If the home automation system is not secure, a criminal 
could override the settings to unlock the doors. For example if a hacker 
were able to remotely recalibrate a medical device Ȯ e.g. an insulin pump 
or a heart monitor Ȯ serious body damage could be caused. 
Thus, when vetting such devices, due attention must be paid to the secu-
rity measures implemented. Based on the complexity of IoT, there is no 
singular checklist that would take into account all the various forms which 
such devices could take.  
A key security challenge in the IoT context is the increase of the overall 
exposure280 to malicious attacks,281 as compared to isolated (i.e. non-con-
nected) systems. This may be attributed to the following factors:282 
Due to the ease and low cost of developing IoT devices as well as to the 
high adoption rate of smart connected devices, the IoT ecosystem will con-
tinue to steadily grow in volume and variety in the coming years.283 Vari-
ous companies and organizations have published projections regarding 
the number of things that will be connected to the Internet in the coming 
years. A conservative prediction by Gartner, highlights that the number of 
networked devices in use worldwide will reach 20.8 billion by 2020.284 
Ȃs estimates are around 50 billion IoT connections by 2020.285 Huawei

While the exact numbers are uncertain, the overall picture is clearly one of 
significant growth.286 The direct result is that there will be a massive 
amount of Internet-enabled devices operating dynamically that will re-
quire a sufficient protection. Due to the fast development of the IoT that 
occurred without appropriate consideration for security issues, smart de-
vices are inherently insecure.287 A 2015 study by Hewlett Packard showed 
that 70 percent of IoT devices contain serious vulnerabilities.288 These vul-
nerabilities stem in particular from the following:289 
 ȱȱȱ¢Ǳȱ¢ȱȱȱȱȱȃ-task-

tional processing power adds cost).290 This means that most devices will 
not support the processing power required for strong security 
measures and secure communication, such as encryption (e.g. an 8-bit 
microcontroller, the function of which is merely to switch lights on and 
off, cannot support the industry standard SSL to encrypt communica-
tions291) and may transmit data in clear text.292 This is, of course, partic-
ularly problematic in the IoT context, given the massive amounts of 
data that are being transmitted between smart devices, the cloud and 
mobile applications.293

use of, lack of periodic password resets and failure to require re-au-
thentication for sensitive data. Weak authentication and authorization 
compromise the entire IoT system.294 
 Insecure Web interface: Security issues with the web interface include 
persistent cross-site scripting, poor session management and weak or 
plain default credentials (which can be exploited by enumerating ac-
counts until access is granted).295 
 Insecure software and firmware: due to resource constraints, most IoT 
devices are designed without the ability to accommodate software or 
firmware updates (which would add cost). As a result, vulnerability 
patching is difficult.296 This is problematic since ȱȱȃ¢ȱȬ

is shifting the security paradigm from hardware to the networks that

point for an attack, which creates a great imbalance in what appears to 
be a cybersecurity arms race: While defenders must secure every single 
part of the ecosystem, all that is needed for an attacker is a single entry

 Encouraging a culture of security within the enterprise, including the 
designation of a responsible security officer and training of staff; 
 Taking into account security as a core component in the design of the 
device (security by design); 
 Implementing an in-depth defense strategy at every layer of the service 
provisioning and data access will also increase overall security and 
limit the potential damages that an intruder could create; 
 Allocating the resources based on the level of risk involved, starting 
with the greatest risk, and allocating resources to subsequent risk miti-
gation measures when they become available; 
 Avoiding default passwords unless consumers are required to change 
these; 
 Implementing automatic encryption that is state of the art and update 
when necessary; 
 ȱ ȃȄȯrandom dataȯto hashed data in order to make it 
harder for attackers to compromise; 
 Using rate limiting, a system for controlling the traffic sent or received 
by a network, to reduce the risk of automated attacks. 
The tension with regard to security is created by the fact that the data of 
these devices should generally be transmitted very freely in order to most 
efficiently use the service.300 In some instances where the collected data 
may be sensitive, a two-factor authentication with a password and token 
seems warranted. Often the main risk for attacks lies in the communication 
and interaction of various IoT devices, which, if not appropriately secured, 
present a loophole through which an intruder can hijack the network of 
IoT devices.  
However, first and foremost, no company may put a IoT device on the 
market that has not been checked for security risks. This request should

not only take into account the device but also how customers are likely to 
use the product, including any surrounding technology which may impact 
ȱȂȱ¢ǯȱ 
Once the initial security is set, companies should also focus on maintaining 
this security level. Regular software updates are commonplace in the IoT 
setting and enable the addition of new services and capabilities. Security 
measures should also be updated as well, so as to ensure that the update 
does not create new security risks that must be addressed before the soft-
ware is automatically pushed onto the IoT devices. Additionally, the own-
ers of the devices must be informed when the devices are no longer up-
dated and the security thus can no longer be ensured. At this point, the 
user must decide whether to retain the old device and accept the security 
risks or buy a new improved device.  
The company manufacturing and installing the software on the IoT device 
should also keep up to date on any identified vulnerabilities that have been 
identified by other market participants. As IoT device manufacturers rely 
on other suppliers for parts or software, these vendors may also present a 
risk. This is due to the fact that the design of their products may also in-
clude flaws that may be exploited, and this is why a register of the supplier 
technology used in the devices should be maintained and regularly 
checked against national vulnerability databases. The supplier should also 
maintain a channel, where security researchers or consumers can reach the 
enterprise about a risk they have discovered in one of its products. Rather

how of third parties to ensure security by paying a reward to the discov-

Labor Law Challenges of IT Sourcing 
 
131 
Finally, security should also be understood as a marketing argument, 
which, if effectively communicated, allows potential customers to feel at 
ease buying a new and exciting technology even if they do not understand 
its precise workings.302 
III. Labor Law Challenges of IT Sourcing 
Not only data protection but also other laws impact the sourcing of IT ser-
vices. In Germany, for example, a strong focus has been placed on regulat-
ing temporary agency work. This affects the common cooperation of exter-
nal vendor personnel with their service partners. The law only focuses in 
this context on the factual daily contract implementation. When an em-
ployee of the IT company is on temporary assignment at a customer´s en-
terprise, this enterprise is allowed to direct this employee although he or 
she is employed by the IT company.  
Based on the increased digitalization, ever more IT projects are outsourced 
and assigned to such contractors. Essentially, these contracts to produce 
work require the contractor to supply a promised work which requires a 
certain degree of distinguishability. Such a contract entails warranty rights 
which the contracting party can rely on if the result does not measure up 
to the set goals.  
Another contract form available is the service contract. This contract has 
the advantage of only requiring the performance of a certain service and 
does not owe a result to the contracting party. Thus, warranty rights only 
apply in a limited fashion. However, the responsibility to carry out and 
organize the service rests with the service provider, and the employees are 
generally not bound by the instructions of the customer.  
In order to avoid any potential conflicts, the contractor should ensure that 
its employees are conducting other work than that of the service provider´s 
employees. Furthermore, a particular difficulty arises in the context of free-
lancers, which generally are working based on a service contract but in 
reality receive instructions on a daily basis by the customer.

G. Ensuring Data Security 
132 
In 2013, the insufficient determination of the assignment models received 
great attention based on several court cases against large German corpora-
tions, including Daimler and Telekom. External contractors were making 
the claim that they were actual employees of these companies despite hav-
ing a contract with their employer service company. The market for tem-
porary employees responded rapidly, and companies started to require ȃto 
seeȄ licenses for temporary agency work. By asking for the ȱȱȃstor-
age licenses,Ȅȱthe companies sought to protect themselves from such cases 
that may arise based on the lack of a temporary contract or a hidden tem-
porary work agency.303  
However, based on a change in law, contractual provisions will no longer 
suffice to safeguard the contracting business against such claims. In these 
cases, penalties, social security, and other payments will be sought form 
the contractors.  
A focus of the case law is placed on highlighting the criteria of integration 
within the work organization and being subject to instructions as a main 
criterion.304 However, the instruction criterion also presents challenges as 
contractors will always need some form of instruction to be able to carry 
out their tasks within a large corporation. In the future, the storage license 
will come to an end, and every contract of this nature must clearly state 
that it is temporary agency work. Furthermore, the contractual details of 
the agreement between the IT service supplier and the customer company 
must be disclosed to the employee.  
However, there are not yet time limits set on these agency contracts. Nev-
ertheless, the contract cannot be for an indefinite period, as this would not 
qualify as a temporary assignment.305 Currently, a new amendment is be-
ing drafted in Germany which would limit such contract periods to 18 
months, requiring at least a three-month gap before an employee could be 
sent to the same customer again. The risk that such an employment con-
tract exceeding the 18 months is invalid will rest on the customer. In such

a situation automatically a new employment contract will be in effect be-
tween the customer of the agency and the employee which has been sent.306  
Importantly, the payment and working conditions must be equal to those 
employees already working for the customer. From an economical per-
spective, temporary agency work is only beneficial as the other party bears 
the burden of a business downturn and the risk of a costly layoff. Im-
portantly, both parties bear penalties when a hidden temporary agency 
contract is found. Thus, they should seek to include as many characteristics 
of the contract type they want to agree upon in order to later argue that 
there is no temporary agency contract. 
As a consequence, when contracting a EU agency to supply IT or other 
staff for a limited duration, any company must closely look to the national 
law on temporary assignments that can place strong restrictions on such 
use. Therefore, acquiring specialized freelance consultants and experts is 
more difficult in the EU than it is in the US, owing to its strong labor pro-
tection laws.

A. Shaping Global Privacy 
134 
Part 4: Outlook on Future Developments 
Technological developments have shaped the last decade significantly 
through the introduction of new communication forms and productive 
tools that are, for most part, based on cloud systems. These tools, however, 
create much uncertainty as to how they operate and as to the underlying 
privacy and data protection implications they create. Often a user of a ser-
vice is not aware of its precise provisioning and thus must rely on the ser-
ȱȂȱȱȱȱ¢ȱǯȱ 
Independent third-party certification of IT systems is a good path forward 
to ensure a more transparent communication of the level of risk involved 
in a service. However, such certifications only provide a determination at 
a given point in time and are only reassessed after a fixed period of time. 
During this intermediary period many changes can occur that have the po-
tential to affect the user of the service. Thus, in addition to the industry 
protection, legal minimum standards should be set on a international level 
in order to ensure that basic measures and protection are implemented. 
A. Shaping Global Privacy 
Many cloud providers and IT industry professional that have been inter-
viewed stated that the EU is implementing the now global standard for 
data protection through its wide extraterritorial application. In doing so, 
their view is that the EU should establish a treaty to which other states can 
become a party in order to resolve some of the conflicts that arise under 
the wide scope of the GDPR. This would allow other states to participate 
in the data protection discussion in a meaningful way as otherwise they 
feel the effects of the GDPR but cannot do much about them.  
A solution on a more international level such as the UN would take too 
much time and would likely be vetoed by one of its Security Council Mem-
bers. Thus a mix of old and new rules, as well as their adjustment to new 
technologies and services, will be the most likely development over the 
next couple of years. Based on the EU and its strong data protection frame-
work, other countries will seek to mirror these provisions to some extent 
in order to be able to also process data from the EU.

In addition to formal legal rules, an international body should be created 
with the goal of harmonizing data protection around the globe and pro-
vide a forum for discussions and development. This is central to demo-
cratic legitimization of any international agreement that may be reached 
later.307 Initially, a synchronization of legal norms not only directly related 
to data protection but also to other factors influencing the ability of data 
protection to work efficiently should be sought. Achieving a balanced ap-
proach between various challenging problems and the trade-offs that are 
necessary must be openly discussed in society, taking into account the ef-
fects on innovative high-tech environments.308 
A hybrid approach to regulating data protection currently presents the 
best way forward, as it takes the need for clear rules as well as the techno-
logical capabilities of various industries into account by enabling them to 
create their own technological and organizational data protection frame-
works that are based on the applicable industry characteristics.  
Future legislation should encompass five categories, including:309  
 a right-to-know legislation that keeps users informed;  
 a prohibition legislation which prevents certain types of collection and 
distribution practices of information;  
 an IT security legislation that provides for the necessary security stand-
ards;  
 a utilization regulation that restricts the use of personal data having 
been collected;

B. Regulatory Efforts 
136 
A common argument brought by industry professionals is that the law 
does not suffice in taking into account the practical needs of the online in-
dustry and the law-Ȃȱȱof technical knowledge. Furthermore, the 
path dependency inherent in the law-making process, as well as the en-
forceability of laws in the international context, raise questions as to the 
effectiveness of the laws and their ability to adjust to market conditions.311 
Standard setting bodies can fill the regulatory gap, which together with 
large corporations also shape the global privacy landscape.  
Thus, the system regulating privacy around the globe is highly complex 
and unclear in many parts. Often the companies collecting information are 
also the creators of new information, making the data cosmos highly multi-
layered and difficult to oversee. Even if measures are implemented, the 
success from both legal and technical perspectives is hard to assess. Ulti-
mately, any approach by either national legislators or on the international 
level should be able to measure success in order to prevent negative con-
sequences to innovation.312  
B. Regulatory Efforts 
On the broader scale, the last decade has demonstrated a strong trend to-
wards using legislation to regulate and reign in cyberspace issues. How-
ever, this has so far not proven to be the best strategy as the evolution of 
technology and the slow legislative process stand in opposition to each 
other. The interviews have also shown that business responds to further 
legislative action in different ways by adjusting their offering or finding 
workarounds. 
As far as the EU General Data Protection Regulation is concerned, many 
yet unclear definitions and rules enable companies to work with the most 
favorable terms until the courts decide to limit their interpretation after a 
couple of years. The issues with regard to personal data transfers to the US 
has been such an example, since enterprises can rely on the Privacy Shield

exception or the standard contractual clauses. However, both do not pro-
vide sufficient data protection and are only a smoke screen used to demon-
strate compliance. 
Many variables play a role in effectively regulating privacy in the digital 
world. These variables include embracing technology and its ability to in-
crease the efficiency of our daily lives. Innovation and technological devel-
opment cannot be stopped, thus legal scholars are tasked with identifying 
what legal concepts are still applicable to the digital age and disregard oth-
ers that must be replaced by new and more appropriate concepts. This is 
highly challenging, as the existing legal norms are based on century-old 
principles and notions such as property which do not easily translate into 
the digital era and often come into conflict with other laws such as data 
protection. Thus, further research on an international level is necessary in 
order to develop new approaches to these issues which present an oppor-
tunity at harmonizing laws at a very high level with regard to new tech-
nologies, such as IoT, Big Data, and artificial intelligence (AI).  
In addition to international efforts, at least a partial societal consensus on 
privacy norms must be reached.313 This consensus on pre-legal norms then 
enters the legal system and interacts with the existing legal norms.314 In 
this context, learning mechanisms are essential in order to bridge the gap 
between the values of society, the regulatory norms in place, and techno-
logical developments. Norms must be designed in a manner that allows 
implementing a plurality of regulatory modes and tools.315 
Enshrining privacy enhancing technologies and privacy by design in the 
normative framework is a godd example of the law setting a basic require-
ment to take privacy into account in the design of a product or service 
whilst leaving enough leeway to enterprises to decide how to best imple-
ment privacy.

B. Interview Summaries 
The following shortened interviews were conducted during July and Au-
gust 2016 in California. The qualitative interviews were set up in an open 
format with an introductory phase which allowed for a description of the 
business operations. Subsequently, the interview was focused on data pro-
tection and data security issues based on the experience of the interview 
partner.  
I. 
Interview 1 (SaaS) 
A: Where do you process data? 
B: Our clients select where they want to have their data processed. We offer 
processing in the US, the UK and India. Some data is also processed in 
Israel as part of the customer service hotline. However, as you know Israel 
is classed as having an equivalent data protection level as the EU and thus 
we can transfer the contract information freely. Currently only one EU cus-
tomer has opted for a US processing operations all others want their data 
processed in the EU. This is mostly a political issue and depends on the 
origin of the company. A US company would naturally be more open to 
processing in the US whereas a EU company want the data to be processed 
in the UK as anything else would be a hard sell. 
A: Do you rely on providers of IaaS or how is your cloud in the US, UK 
and India designed. 
B: We do not use a public cloud provider. All the servers belong to us and 
are separate from other servers. They are provided by a third party con-
tractor. 
A: How do you ensure security of this data? 
B: Our vendor is contractually obliged to fulfill certain security require-
ments in addition to the ISO 27 000 certification. We are also certified un-
der SSA and all other major information security certifications.  

Interview 1 (SaaS) 
 
141 
A: What transfer mechanism under the Data Protection Directive do you 
currently use. 
B: We use the standard contractual clauses as they are simple to implement 
and allow us to transfer the data without restrictions. 
A: Do these clauses provide enough flexibility for you? 
B: Yes 
A: How have your clients reacted to the Snowden leaks and has it affected 
your business? 
B: European clients are mostly more conscious when it comes to data pro-
tection. However, we are dealing with large international corporations 
which are sophisticated and know that we can provide the required pro-
tection. We have also evaluated the risks of disclosure of information un-
der the Patriot Act and see it in reality not as a great issue.  
A: How is your perception of the GDPR and how will it affect your busi-
ness? 
B: We are closely monitoring the EU developments and in particular what 
is happening in the UK. But we already have communicated to our clients 
that we will take every step necessary to comply with the data protection 
laws and we are able to do so. We may need to relocate the data from the 
UK to another EU country if it is no longer considered to be an EU country 
but we will wait until this has played out.  
A: Do you have any issues with identifying personal data or the wide 
scope of the personal data definition under the GDPR? 
B: No, we are able to identify what is personal data. However, we are treat-
ing all data as personal data thus avoiding any issue this way. Addition-
ally, only the people required to have access to data are allowed to access 
it and this is closely monitored. The coders for example do not have access 
to the customer data as this is not required for adjusting the systems.  
A: Have you ever considered using an alternative to the standard clauses? 
www.ebook3000.com

B. Interview Summaries 
142 
B: We had a look at the BCR framework, however, there was no real benefit 
to it and the costs would have been much greater than the standard 
clauses. We will continue to use the standard clauses under the GDPR and 
make adjustments together with our clients should there be changes of the 
terms.  
A: How do you view the GDPR and its extraterritorial application? 
AS: This is my opinion Ȯ The data protection issue is more of a political 
issue. Our EU clients often come to us and say they know the law allows 
for this or that but often they need reassurances for their own internal rea-
sons. Mostly company policy has grown over years and is viewed as the 
law whereas the rules in reality allow for much more. Often German labor 
unions seek additional reassurances which we are more than willing to 
provide. Our view is that we are open about how we process and use data. 
Often we are not required to do so under law but this is not our policy. 
Clients then sometimes are surprised what we are allowed to do but we 
then tell them that all other companies are doing this too but they are not 
telling you. The EU has a high data protection standard which it wants to 
push throughout the world as a global standard. It should stand to this 
position and communicate it that way. There is no way of avoiding it in 
any case.  
A: How do you react to the current legal uncertainty? 
B: Our team meets regularly together with IT and Marketing and we dis-
cuss potential issues and how to approach them. Often the client already 
has done their own homework and informs us how they want certain sit-
uations or issues to be handled.  
A: So you favor a global standard? 
B: Yes this would enable a free data transfer. Preferably it could take the 
form of a treaty by the EU which can then be concluded by other countries. 
On the UN level this seems impossible as it would be vetoed.  

Interview 2 (Consulting)

II. 
Interview 2 (Consulting) 
A: What are the key factors in the design of cloud environments? 
B: A secure data environment is important. Interestingly this can be 
achieved through open source software as 100s of professionals work on 
improving the systems as oppose to a few single programmers within a 
corporation. In relation to HIPAA I have experienced that infrastructure 
compliance does not translate into application compliance with HIPAA in 
particular when it runs in the cloud. Often it is difficult what various laws 
such as SOX require in the design of an application.  
A: Do you have clients that have seen issues with identifying personal 
data? 
B: Yes, data location is always an issue. Often login credentials are used to 
determine who is the individual customer and thus which laws apply. 
However, this is not always a good predictor as IP address can be changed 
through a VPN or someone else could be using a login. These questions 
present an ongoing challenge. In particular for small companies the iden-
tification is a great issue as the systems required are expensive.  
A: What are the concerns of start-ups? 
B: These companies are focused on growth and are mostly not involved in 
EU business from the start. As the company evolves data segregation be-
comes a important factor. The great benefits of the cloud for start-ups is 
the ability to have a base infrastrucutre with all necessary security require-
ments delivered by a single experienced vendor such as AWS with the 
ability to scale according to business growth.  
A: Are the main providers offering the same service or would you select a 
certain provider over another one for a particular processing operation? 
B: AWS and Microsoft are mostly similar, rackspace is probably more the 
provider of choice in the private cloud context. Google is a bit behind. In 
regard to privacy they are the same. They work of an enterprise agreement 
which gives you credit depending on usage etc.  They all provide regional

offerings. AWS has 2-3 server centers in the EU and 2-3 in Asia and pro-
vides 4-5 regional offerings.  
III. Interview 3 (IT Security) 
A: Please describe the trends you have seen in the cloud industry 
B: The trend in the cloud market has gone to more integrated services 
which offer a full range of services including all aspects of a business op-
eration. There has been a growth in the EU server market seeing more 
cloud providers such as AWS and Microsoft establishing server centers 
there. The prices have also significantly gone down. 
A: Would you say there is a big price difference from the EU to US cloud 
server offerings? 
B: No, if there is a difference it is very low. Most international corporations 
have large contracts with AWS which allows them to shift and mirror data 
across the globe and thus no price differentiation is carried out between 
the servers as the agreement is based on the service utilized not the loca-
tion.  
A: How hard is it for a cloud customer to move its processing operation 
across server centers in different countries? 
B: Fairly easy within the cloud offering. With a physical presence in many 
regions the data can simply be shifty through high speed connection in 
seconds. At the end of the day it is the decision of the company where it 
wants to store the data and from which center it can provide the service 
most efficiently. 
A: How does the EU data protection framework affect this process and to 
what extent does it present a challenge? 
B: The main take away would be that smaller companies are not under 
imminent sanctions thus their focus is more on providing the service. 
However in the B to B context it will often be agreed that the data is only 
shifted on servers in the EU. The most important aspect and the area in 
which we are most active is ensuring the appropriate security controls are

implemented in the various cloud systems. This includes decoupling infra-
structure and a mapping across all available (contractually agreed) juris-
dictions. AWS offers 4-7 different deployment models that allow for com-
pliance with the EU data protection la was they allow a sole processing in 
the EU.  
A: Are compliance cost with regard to data protection an issue or can a 
provider such as AWS offer complete packages for smaller businesses? 
B: Yes, costs are always an issue. The EU data protection laws add another 
layer of complexity. For smaller providers having a certified and secure 
structure provided by AWS is essential in being able to prove compliance. 
A: How do you in your daily work ensure the security of your clients cloud 
systems and what do you look out for? 
B: We generally offer everything from a simple check to a full assessment 
which includes policy and procedures, disaster recovery systems. 
IV. Interview 4 (SaaS) 
A: Please briefly explain your business operation. 
B: We store and manage legal documents for big enterprises in the cloud 
and facilitate the hiring of specialized attorneys for various projects. 
A: What types of data do you process? 
B: We process various forms of data. Our job is mainly administrative as 
we facilitate the billing of attorney hours and enable an efficient selection 
process. Our clients upload their data which could be anything from a 
NDA to a sophisticated commercial contract or M&A transaction to our 
cloud server from which our attorneys access the data. This data is siloed 
off from other data to make sure only the client and attorney get access to 
it. We don´t know and do not want to know what is in the documents. We 
only collect the document IDs which contain information on our client and 
the type of document. However, we do not know who the other party is 
nor what the content of the document states.

A: Do you use your own servers or a third party vendor? 
B: The software we use is our, however, infrastructure-wise we use Ama-
zon Web Services.  
A: What is your main concern in relation to data protection within your 
company? 
B: As we are storing a lot of confidential information that contains legal 
privilege as well as commercially valuable information our main concern 
is a data security breach. This is why we vet out attorneys very carefully 
and require them to fulfill a two layer authentication in order to login to 
our systems. Furthermore, they are required to encrypt their hard drive on 
their laptops in order to ensure nobody can gain access to data through a 
lost or stolen device. They receive a list of specific requirements from us at 
the beginning which they must implement and we then check whether this 
has happened. Often there are a few things missing which is based on the 
fact that attorneys are often not so familiar with the technology. Sometimes 
they complain that the login process is too complicated but we then ex-
plain to them the risks involved with the data they handle and that this is 
necessary to protect their clients. 
A: Do you sometimes get push backs from your business clients on how 
you handle data? 
B: Sometimes the more sophisticated clients send us a list with questions 
on our processing operation we must answer. So far everyone was happy 
with the response we provided. Sometimes smaller enterprises raise ques-
tions as to the security of our cloud storage. In these cases we show that 
large international corporations with sophisticated IT and legal teams have 
evaluated and trust the way we handle things. This goes a long way in 
convincing clients. We are in the market for 4 years now and we have ex-
perienced a slightly higher awareness to data breaches. However, as we 
are dealing with large commercial clients they understand the risks in-
volved and that no system is 100% save. Our main concern is that the login 
credentials are shared by our customers within a department and thus this 
could lead to a data breach. We make sure we inform the customer of these 
risks and highlight them in our contract. 

Interview 4 (SaaS)

A: Do you have any exclusion clauses or cloud insurance to limit liability? 
B: We use the standard contractual exclusion clauses which exclude liabil-
ity beyond what is outside our control. We only have a general insurance 
but no special insurance for data security breaches or the cloud operation 
per se. As we are growing this may be something to look into. 
A: How do your clients and their attorneys communicate? Through your 
platform? 
B: We do not have a communication tool on our platform but we are trying 
out Slack (a cloud based communication tool). Most of this communication 
is still done by phone. 
A: Do you carry out any analytics? 
B: Yes, we use the document ID data to compile reports for our clients such 
as how many leads on potential investments a certain party has sent them. 
Additionally we collect information contained on scorecards to calculate 
the average turnaround time of documents such as non-disclosure agree-
ments as well as escrow percentages and so on.  
A: Do you have any sensitive information on your servers such as health 
data? 
B: I would say no. We do not want to know what the documents contain, 
thus I cannot give you a definitive answer on that. Our clients are mostly 
financial institutions, real estate firms, thus it is unlikely that they would 
store such data on our servers. 
A: Are you thinking of expanding to the EU? 
B: We are currently not pushing this actively. Some of our clients have of-
fices in London and would want us to also offer services there but so far 
we have not considered this option as the EU laws are very diverse and 
not an ideal market for us as we seek to process high volume legal docu-
ments. We have had clients dealing with issues in a transaction involving 
a confidential sale of a EU based company and the issues involved in trans-
ferring data for due diligence purposes to the US. But we have not so far

been directly affected by these laws as we only deal in the US B2B business 
currently. 
V. 
Interview 5 (Consulting) 
A: What are the main concerns of your clients in regard to data protection? 
B: We see clients are having various issues with locating data. For example, 
when a Chinese company has a subsidiary in the EU and the US. During a 
discovery process one must analyze the systems and ensure that the data 
can only be viewed on screen in China but no alteration can be made. This 
is a far from optimal solution as one could take a photo from the screen. 
However, the reality is that compromises must be reached. In relation to 
discovery and EU data we had to deal with employee data. In this context, 
a US company acquires waivers from their employees which is generally 
not a problem. However, in the EU specialized labor attorneys are neces-
sary.  
A: Having a look at disclosure and data protection, have you experienced 
problems with third party disclosure? 
B: Yes, we have mostly dealt with this issue by getting to court to grant 
indemnity in certain cases. However, it is easy to argue as third party that 
local laws would be violated by the disclosure. This is a fine line to walk 
and it depends on the circumstances. If you are the party generally you 
will not be able to get away with it.  
A: Yes, the Microsoft case dealing with disclosure of data on an Irish server 
has at least closed the argument of extraterritoriality of the stored commu-
nication. Are there other forms of data that present issues for your clients? 
B: We see issues in relation to health data for example in pharma studies 
which are hard to anonymize. Here a court protection order is essential 
when disclosure is sought during a discovery procedure.  
A: You use a cloud infrastructure for your data?  
B: For discovery we use AWS together with one of the big discovery com-
panies such as EverLaw or Logical. However, we vet every vendor very 

Interview 5 (Consulting) 
 
149 
carefully. This includes onsite checks during which I have a look at the 
security and infrastructure. This includes a security assessment and tech-
nology testing as well as sometimes penetrative testing by a third party.  
A: Do you see trends or changes on the side of your clients with regard to 
data protection? 
B: Most customers use disclaimers with escape clauses which grant them 
the flexibility to react to changes in data protection law in order to get out 
of M&A deals or other transactions. This has become an increased risk in 
the last years. We also see a higher use of employee records in relation to 
a varied number of issues relating to performance or compensation. The 
UK vote to leave the EU has also sparked change and may require a shift-
ing of the server locations to other Member States. 
A: Is there a trend where to move the data in the EU? 
B: Switzerland is generally seen as country where data can be transferred 
in and out easily. There would be some hesitation to move the data to Ger-
many as the framework there is too strict. However, the costs in Switzer-
land are a big factor.  
A: Is there a trend to use more private cloud or do you see an even distri-
bution? 
B: The trend has been to use a private cloud as it is simply more secure. 
There are many public cloud offerings out there which use hybrid cloud 
infrastructure which is anything but safe. These tools are highly effective 
for example there is great project management software out there. How-
ever, the risk is when this is combined with internal communication (i.e. 
Slack) and the risk for unwanted disclosure rises. These tools could be used 
to breach a formerly secure system which is why many large corporations 
have concerns when using these.  
A: Why is the security of these systems not improved? 
B: Mostly these systems are designed by young start-up companies which 
want to provide a service at low cost. This requires hybrid cloud use.  
Furthermore, the dichotomy of ease of access and security is still hard to

bridge. For us as a law firm or out clients we cannot recommend using 
these systems.  
A: How do you protect against unwanted access in your firm? 
B: Our access is on a need to know basis. There have been various cases in 
which first years have left law firms to join investment firms after supply-
ing them with merger information which they gained access to through 
the electronic documents. Today, only a person on a case gets access to it. 
Often our attorneys may not know what other cases the firm handles as 
they do not have access to any case files beside their own cases.  
A: Have there been any changes or reactions after Snowden? 
B: Yes, especially the Panama Papers have had an impact. Since then secu-
rity has been further prioritized in law firms and other companies.  
A: Do you use standard software such as Office 365 in the Cloud? 
B: We use Office storage in the cloud which allows us to store data HIPAA 
compliant. Microsoft provides a good solution in this regard which is ad-
justed to the type of data. However, we have a problem with using the 
software remotely as this allows Microsoft to push updates at their will 
without our approval. This may create problems with our security systems 
or infrastructure and may compromise the integrity of our systems. With-
out a function to object to such updates we cannot use this system.  
VI. Interview 6 (SaaS) 
A: Please explain your business operations, I understand you are provid-
ing a SaaS monitoring service? 
B: We are a leading provider of performance monitoring of applications. 
These services are either provided on premises on the infrastructure of the 
customer or on a SaaS solution in the cloud for which we use AWS. Our 
customers with sensitive data such as banks tend to opt for the on premises 
version of our offering. Let me explain the way in which it works: 

Interview 6 (SaaS) 
 
151 
The so called agents monitor according to the type of service the customer 
has chosen performance of databases, servers, java engines etc. They then 
take the information and send it to the control which is the brain of the 
processing operation. In the most sophisticated version we can monitor the 
performance of the entire infrastructure end to end. However, at no time 
do we see the content that is processed. This is very important to us and is 
implemented in the architecture of the system. We also ensure contractu-
ally that the customer does not design any application to allow us to access 
data.  
For example take the example of an e-commerce shop. It is accessed 
through a browser or shopping app of which we monitor performance. 
The most personal data we get in this context is maybe the IP address of a 
person in order to ascertain the area from which the data originated.  
A: Why did you select the AWS system? 
B: It is the biggest player on the market and offers the full package of price 
security and scalability 
A: Do you have any products that collect personal data or allow for ana-
lytics? 
B: We only have one product that is currently being developed that may 
include a minimal amount of personal data. It is a log product that mines 
the log files for analytics again in order to identify issues. However, in this 
process the mentioned IP addresses as well as geo data is collected. The 
client is, however, able to insert all sorts of information into its log files. 
We are trying to prevent this by clearly stating in the contract that this is 
not to happen and that the client will be liable for any data that comes from 
these files should there be personal data included.  
Some of our clients rely on their own on premises infrastructure and in 
these cases we are bound by their technical constraints. However, we al-
ways contract proactively against access to personal data. In this regard 
our software engineers make sure that our software does not allow access 
to anything else than performance data.

B. Interview Summaries 
152 
A: have you seen any shifts in relation to the contracting with a view to 
data protection? 
B: Yes, data security terms in contracts are becoming much more explicit. 
Often we will see a list in form of an annex including a wide variety of 
scenarios which will be defined as a data security breach as this will ulti-
mately play a role when one of the parties seeks damages. In the US the 
risk allocation is not so much done by law but rather through commercial 
practice. There has been no or limited FTC enforcement in this regard. 
Most vendor contracts seek a carve out for data breaches which ultimately 
shifts the unlimited liability of a security breach on us as service provider. 
We don´t want this risk and we cannot actually take on this risk as it would 
potentially ruin us.  
What we are also seeing is a shift from data breaches to an introduction of 
essentially the same liability through the breach of confidence provisions. 
These breach of confidence provisions do not have a liability cap and the 
client will argue that the breach involved confidential data which will trig-
ger the liability provision.  
Our focus in these cases is to clearly distinguish both a breach of confiden-
tiality and a data security breach. This is done by having a large annex 
which will include all particulars of each available scenario and thus will 
allow a categorization of the risk into two categories for which we then can 
agree on liability caps.  
A: What do you in relation to the EU data protection framework? 
B: We have a subsidiary in the UK which carries out the privacy protection 
audits. We have acquired a form for these procedures which lists all the 
steps and factors we need to account for. In the transfer context we use 
mostly model clauses for controller to controller and controller to proces-
sor contracting when we are engaged as a customer. This includes a de-

ing process, information on what data is collected and transferred to whom 
and where. Often arguments arise in the classification of service providers 
where it is unclear whether a party is a controller or processor. In these 
cases we mostly agree on a processor agreement as both arguments can be 

Interview 7 (SaaS)

made and the contracting party does not want to take on the obligations of 
a controller.  
Our UK subsidiary has received a power of attorney from all EU subsidi-
aries to enter into these model clauses which enables us to only make on 
agreement for the EU.  
A: Have you explored the possibilities of using BCRs? 
B: Yes, we are currently looking into that. However, the downside are the 
costs involved. On the positive side it is a good marketing instrument as it 
signals to our customers that we have one framework for their data pro-
cessing. Our C-Level is also interested in the security aspects of the BCRs. 
One other market trend we have seen is also the uncertainty around the 
steps necessary to achieve compliance and a closer focus on what the ac-
tual product does. Most software developers will now focus on security 
related product features built into the design. This is also a demand by our 
business customers.  
A: Do you see any movement when it comes to analytics or Big Data? 
B: Yes, there is a trend to use more analytics. However, for our service per-
sonal data is not necessary, so we are very free in using Big Data and ana-
lytics. 
VII. Interview 7 (SaaS) 
A: Please describe your service offering to me. 
B: We provide for an electronic discovery platform which enables our cli-
ents to conduct an efficient and targeted discovery process. The data is 
currently supplied to us for preparation and then uploaded into the cloud 
from which the customer can conduct its discovery process.  We are hop-
ing that over the next 6 months we can finalize our preparatory steps such 
as adjusting formats etc. in the cloud without the needs to get the data on 
premises.

I can recommend the Field Guide to Data Privacy Law book by Lothar De-
terman which gives a good example of the compliance issues with regard 
to data protection. 
A: Thank you I will check that one out. How do you approach the issue of 
data protection? 
B: We have encountered various issues in relation to data protection, pri-
vacy and confidential data. Currently we mainly only operate in the US. 
However, as we service large international corporations we also see re-
quests pertaining to other jurisdictions such as the UK and Australia. In 
order to explore these issues we have recently opened a subsidiary in Aus-
tralia with a local instance of our service aimed at enabling electronic dis-
covery in Australia. This instance runs on the AWS systems in Sydney. 
With a tool called NewX we can soon get the data directly and transfer it 
into our system called Everlaw. Some compliance questions that have 
come up so far touch on the unique nature of the national law in Australia. 
In order to have an Australian domain we had to register a business there 
which then must be accompanied by a trade mark.  
A: Where do you feel that data protection may become the biggest concern 
for your business? 
B: Our systems are self-learning and currently this process is hindered by 
boarders as for every instance we must relearn the system. This leads to 
work being done twice and efficiency being lost. When we are able to min-
gle data across various instances the accuracy increases. Also we would 
like to aggregate anonymous data in order to improve user experience. Of-
ten we seek consent for actions that go across jurisdictions. However, as 
the data volume and types of data are so vast the consent may touch upon 
third party rights and thus is not necessarily adequate.  
The recent second circuit decision in the Microsoft case has at least set the 
signal that the courts will reign in the national legislation which intends to 
expand its scope beyond the US. This trend is beneficial for enterprises 
seeking legal certainty as to how to operate and which laws to apply when 
dealing internationally.

through so called tokens.  
With regard to discovery in foreign jurisdiction we have used systems 
were the data is only displayed in a foreign jurisdiction without being 
stored there. This is how we get around the copyright issues as there is no

also enables us to carry out our operations as we process data for the liti-
gation of our clients.  
A: Do any issues arise in the context of processing this valuable client data 
in the cloud? 
B: Mainly the issue that most often is raised related to the security of the 
data. Our data shares the underlying hardware in the cloud however there 
is an encryption layer to prevent the data from being accessed by the other 
instance.  
A: How do you account for the data protection and compliance risks in 
your contracts? 
B: We generally use compliance checklist in order to limit our exposure. 
However, the power to shift liability comes down to leverage meaning 
which party wants the contract most.  In any case the processing infrastruc-
ture must be ready for review which is why the AWS ensures that it main-
tains certifications and other documents enabling an assessment of com-
pliance with security, data protection and other relevant laws.   
As we are working with some of the major corporations we are able to 
leverage their contracts with AWS in order to get better prices for our 
cloud instance. AWS already provides the best protection which provides 
immediate compliance with most of the important laws.  
Our main concern at the moment lies in the fact that we need access to the 
data for cloud development whereas our clients want to ensure restricted 
access. In order to address the issues raised by our access we have strong 
protocols and NDAs in place which ensure that our team does not disclose

B. Interview Summaries 
156 
any information.  As part of our security strategy we conduct external pen-
etration testing and we also have a protocol in cases of breaches as well as 
with regard to the notification requirements.  
Another point is the need to update the software. We routinely push up-
dates into the cloud in order to improve service quality and reduce risks. 
If one of our clients would not want the update we could no longer ensure 
the security of the system. We also work with staggered releases which 
start with the US and then expand to the EU. By the time the EU version is 
released we will already have eliminated some of the issues that may have 
presented themselves in the US version.  
A: Dou you have any insurance against risks? 
B: We have general liability insurance however for the future we may look 
at further insurance options.  
A: How did you develop your software? Did you rely on any third party 
software? 
B: We started off with a blank sheet and programmed our own software. 
Of course we rely on other software which we license because it would not 
make sense for us to develop it. For example language recognition tools 
which can translate or identify language are already developed and are a 
commodity for which we would pay. This allows us to focus on the core 
of our business which is to develop the most efficient and reliable elec-
tronic discovery tool.

B: We are a Cloud Communications provider that offers a wide range of

B: Yes we currently have a UK product.  Our ecosystem consists of the 
server connection, devices used on premises and the endpoint. At some 
stage a local storage may also come into play.  
A: How do you achieve compliance with the EU data protection laws? 
B: For any transfers of EU data to the US we use the model clauses which 
enables us to offer customer service from the US for our EU customers.

your communication tool GLIMP. One of the UK employees communi-
cates consumer data to a customer representative of the same company in 
the US. This would require a separate justification which falls outside the 
scope of your contractual clause. How do you ensure against such use? 
B: Such a use if of course a problem which we cannot totally control. Of 
course our contract will prohibit such a transfer and our employees are 
also informed not to use the tool in such a way. However, we have very 
little power to prevent such a use. This obligation rests on our contracting 
party to ensure that it complies with the data protection laws.  
A: How do you perceive liability in your contracts? 
B: The boilerplate agreements are always in favor of the vendors. We look 
for certifications, security terms as well as compliance undertakings with 
regard to privacy when negotiating a contract. Interestingly the EU has 
evolved around protection of a person whereas the US data protection has 
focused on industries.  
A: Are you concerned about the fines in the GDPR? 
B: They are surely an important factor but we are trying our best to be 
compliant. These fines are only attributed if a party has not taken the nec-
essary action whereas we are doing our best to comply. We therefore do

not see the risk of a third party creating liability for us by using our service 
to be a major concern.  
A: How do government access rights impact your business? 
B: This is of course a concern that we take very seriously. We encourage 
clear procedures for government requests and appropriate safeguards. 
However, we also limit the amount of data that we collect. Generally we 
only collect metadata and not the communication itself. In our chat func-
tion the rule is general first in first out which means that the customer sets 
the maximum storage it wants. Once this is reached the last message send 
will be deleted and so on. 
We also prohibit certain types of data such as health related data. If they 
want to use this type of data we will terminate the service as otherwise the 
costs of the service provisioning would eat of any revenue. If they want 
HIPAA compliance a new contract must be entered with higher costs and 
the appropriate safeguards. 
A: So where are your servers located and what service do you use? 
B: Our EU servers are located in Switzerland and Amsterdam. The main 
reason for these centres are the central location and the good internet con-
nectivity as well as local laws.  
A: Where do you see the biggest challenges for data protection and your 
industry for the future? 
B: The challenge with data is to understand and know what a company is 
doing with it. The cloud technology as well as the evolution of mobile de-
vices make it increasingly difficult to understand how the data processing 
is carried out and what data is combined with other data sets. BigData and 
IoT devices will enable formerly unseen connection and analytics which 
could be used for good and bad. However, it should be left to the individ-
ual to decide to be subject to such a processing.

ing used more widely. This means that individuals are using alternate ali-
ases and accounts for different actions which leads to the erosion of pri-
vacy to a certain point. Also a change in security through more 
sophisticated encryption which is virtually unbreakable has become the 
norm in communication. Intelligence folks track individuals so called 
shadows which is becoming increasingly difficult. Thus the topic of attrib-
uting data to an individual is a core concern in this area. I would recom-
mend the book Hide behind the shadows which addresses these issues.

the data needs to be stored for liability and redundancy across various data 
centers.  
A: Would it be possible to store cloud data only in the EU or are there other 
factors to consider?  
B: If the data would only be stored in the EU the redundancy and availa-
bility would be limited. This is the great challenge between technology and 
the needs of the law. 
A: From a compliance perspective what are the main challenges for tech-
nology companies? 
B: The main issues surround the question of who, what when and where. 
The attribution aspect of data is important for choosing the correct laws. 
Then there is the law itself with the issues of subject matter jurisdiction. 
Here in the US the various state laws differ substantially. Mostly custom-
ers segment data into EU and non-EU customer data. Even US data is often

Interview 10 (SaaS) 
A: Please describe your company and the service you offer quickly. 
B: We are a SaaS provider which offers a customer success platform in the 
cloud. Do you know what customer success is? 
A: No, please explain it to me. 
B: It is similar to customer support however customer support is reactive 
whereas our service is proactive. It monitors customer variables and deter-
mines which of the customers the company should approach. We try to 
influence three main areas. These include customer renewal and retention 
rates, the up-selling or cross-selling of services and the identification of 
customer advocates which the customer can use for testimonials or other 
promotional efforts. 
We have been developing our systems over the last 5 years, identified that 
the currently used tools are rudimentary and do not use the available tech-
nology for improving customer experience. Our software consists of a 
dashboard which allows customers to run a wide range of analysis. The 
software is plugged into various data silos and draws its information from 
a wide source of applications such as salesforce, billing, CRM etc. It com-
bines this data into one application for analysis and gives a 360 degree 
view which can be used for predictive technologies.  
A: So I assume you also process a lot of personal data? This data is stored 
locally or copied and processed in the cloud? 
B: Yes, we process various forms of data including billing records, access 
data etc. which all in some form or another contain personal data. The data 
is transferred from these data silos and processed through our software in 
the cloud. We work with AWS as most cloud enterprises do. 
A: Is your offering currently only US based or are you already processing 
EU data or thinking of entering the EU Market?

B: We currently have around 20 large US based corporate customers and 
just signed a German customer.  
A: What measures are you considering in complying with the EU data pro-
tection laws? 
B: Anonymization could be a solution for us as we are able to process the 
data without knowing who the customer is. Of course, our client would 
need to be able to ascertain who an individual is once we have identified 
a customer for some sort of action. However, for our processing it is not 
relevant.

A: Are there aspects that differ for small companies and large corporati-
ons? 
B: Compliance in terms of HIPAA and SSD are expensive. This affects 
small start-ups stronger than large corporations. Especially the setting-up 
costs are an important factor for these smaller companies. This is where 
the cloud provides the highest benefit. There is a start-up that now deals 
with the issue of varying environments and the security aspects of it, For 
example the mobile device, cloud server and a laptop run a different en-
vironment of the same instance. The new software called Vault allows for 
the same environment on all devices which enables secure testing and ea-
sier compliance with HIPAA etc. It significantly reduces the costs of ensu-
ring the integrity and security of a process on various devices.  
Netflix has come into trouble by anonymizing data and making it public 
to improve their service. However, even this data could be traced back to 
an individual through sophisticated systems. GlaxoSmith has also laun-
ched a program to use the iWatch data for arthritis research. This shows 
the demand for the data but the risks and compliance requirements are 
often unclear.

In terms of the segmentation of data the onus is on the engineers to ensure 
that this is carried out appropriately. Often engineers will not let custo-
mers use android devices for example salesforce does not allow this as the 
software is open source and highly insecure.  
A: What would you require of a cloud operation? 
B: Cloud Security is central: One of the main risks is the hijacking of a cloud 
account as it allows the party access to nearly all systems unless they are 
walled off. SSH and VPN must be used. Two factors authentication is the 
standard used in the industry to ensure safety of the login. One credential 
is persistent and the other changing. Furthermore, databases are no longer 
pull-down databases as they are coded and only allow the copying of 
certain information. Regular security audits are also standard including 
PIA.   
Our customers include the Top 10 list of the FBI which means if these are 
subject to a data breach they would affect national security. We have 
rented around 80 AWS servers in a private cloud. 
Currently we also have a EU project which focuses on animal health in 
which we design a research platform for electronic data collection and ana-
